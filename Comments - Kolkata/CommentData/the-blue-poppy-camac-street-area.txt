This restaurant is located in the Sikkim house. The place is mostly filled with college students and nearby residents or the guests staying in the guest house. The decor of the place is okay. The taste of the food is not bad but the hygiene should be taken care of. Our food had to be replaced due to low hygiene. Food is good.

Located in Sikkim house this place is always crowded with college goers and nearby residents. Come in here if you're fond of pork! They are really awesome at making pork"! Here the dishes I tried-
1. Chilli pork- In one word awesome! Nice chunk of fatty pork cooked till perfection.
2. Pork fried rice- another dish for pork lover
3. Veg Noddles- nothing special normal that you get everywhere
4. Pepper chicken- the taste of pepper is nice but it could've been better.
5. Pan fried chicken momo- another great dish! Must try for momo- lovers!
Overall a great place for your hunger satisfaction but the only problem is they don't serve you glasses unless you ask for one!

If you are looking for Chinese cuisines at pocket friendly deals, this is the place for you! I went there with three of my friends today and they served the perfect food to satisfy our cravings. What I really like about this restaurant is the location, the ambience and their minimal-time delivery of food. The staffs were extremely co-operating and quick. 
Now coming to the food, we ordered: 
1) Chicken Hakka Chowmein
2) Egg Fried Rice
3) Chilly Fish
4) Pepper Chicken
5) Chicken Pan Fried Momo
6) Virgin Mojito as appetizer.

Pepper Chicken was exceptionally delicious. Virgin Mojito was equally refreshing. The Momo preparation was good too. The foods both quality and quantity wise were very impressive. Had great time there. Coming soon again. ‚ù§

The Blue Poppy has always served quality food at reasonable prices. Having visited this place a couple of times, I'd say they're pretty consistent and serve great food! There's a long queue during the lunch hour! Over the various visits, the dishes I've had were:

1. Chicken Clear Soup: 4/5 Loved this. Not bland at all, mildly flavoured, wish it had a little more chicken though.
2. Pan-fried chicken and pork momos: 3.75/5. Crisp outside and succulent, with plenty of delicious filling, inside- tossed in a tangy sweetish spicyish sauce. The momos themselves are fantastic. The sauce is very tomato-y and has the consistency of ketchup. I only wished it was a little textured, say with roasted sesame or bits of chopped garlic, or something like that. That aside, it's great!
3. Chicken and Pork Phaley: 4.5/5. Crisp, juicy, delicious. Nothing much to say, loved it. The pork variant comes with a little less filling than the chicken variant.
4. Singapore Chicken: 3.5/5. The chicken pieces were smaller than regular size, and the gravy was okay- slightly sweet but more on the spicy side.
5. Orange Chicken: 1/5. Nope. Just, nope. The gravy tasted like a spicy variant of thick orange juice. Absolutely not recommended.
6. Chili Pork: 3/5. It was alright, but I've had better. This one lacked seasoning, and tasted bland, at times.
7. Mixed Fried Rice: 4/5 Just right! There was lots of it, and everything was well seasoned and great.

Other than the food, the place is clean, and well maintained. The staff is friendly, and the service is quick. All in all, a good deal!

Went to this place last night , named The Blue Poppy , famous for its diverse and mouth-watering cuisines . We ordered a veg steam momos and veg chilli garlic Meifoon . Within 2-3 minutes momos was served with three kinds of sauces, Staff was quick and friendly . I must tell you that the sauces at this place were great , I never had such tasty yet spicy sauces and of course the momos was the showstopper . After momos veg chilli garlic meifoon was served , it looks like noodles but it‚Äôs actually rice noddles , very thin and deliciously cooked with mild flame with garlic , onion , capsicum and carrot . The veg chilli garlic meifoon was although tasty but you‚Äôll love it more if you have it with their spicy range of sauces . 
Must recommend this place for a cosy dine out , pocket friendly and satisfactory food .

Situated on Middleton street, stone‚Äôs throw away from Loreto back gate. I‚Äôve only had a chance to try 3 items here, namely;
~ Veg pan fried Momos in hot garlic sauce- decent but too saucy and they weren‚Äôt kidding about the HOT sauce. 
~ Veg fried Momos- personally not a big fan,it was crispy but very greasy. The condiments were too spicy. 
~Veg Chilli Garlic Noodles- now they serve hakka chow which is slightly fatter. Not a bad dish but i wish i opted for something else. 

Overall its a busy eatery, fairly reasonable , could use a few more hands and a lil decking up.Also you might have to share your table if you are sitting alone But i suppose it works better for Non- vegetarians more since they have a loyal customer base.

Visited the place because had heard a lot about it from friends and colleagues. Ordered Egg Mehfoon, Hongkong rice and Chilli Chicken for the two of us. Quantity was good and taste was up to the mark as well. The pocket pinch was quite less considering the quality and quantity of food served. Would definitely recommend this place to someone looking for good Chinese at a decent budget.

Well, simply put, one of the best belly-filler options when it comes to a light wallet and a big appetite... 

Go for the momos, and some of the better(if not the best) helpings of noodles in the city. The pork used might be of inferior quality (I prefer my pork less fatty) but that's just my preference, so if it floats your boat, go for it...

As far as the ratings go:
Food: 7/10
Service: 6/10
Ambiance: 5/10 (takeaway's a better option)
Pricing: 9/10

The all time favourite restaurant situated near maidan station and within a limited budget. The place where we could spend quality time with quality food or if we are looking for perfectly cooked pork dishes this is the right place to go.
Here they have no themed design interior but authentic in taste. We ordered their  chilli pork and mixed fried rice and lime juice. Since we were 3 person and already had some street food before going to this place so the quantity was enough for 3 of us. The quantity is quite good and the price is reasonable and satisfactory. 
The food tasted yummy, their chilli pork was perfectly good with perfect amount of spice to make it wonderful. The quantity of meat was good. The fried rice was hot and tasted and smelled just perfect. The staff was friendly and courteous. The overall it made us feel welcomed and homely.
Overall a must visit for all foodies.

Pocket frndly place for Chinese lovers!! Food is praiseworthy . The service was late but good! We took steamed chicken Momo which was very good , the chicken wanton was also nice. The veg fried rice was better than the pork fried rice. Coming to chicken , the Manchurian was nicely done . The Singapore chicken can be improved. The staff was friendly. Ambience is a little dim but enjoyable! Nice place altogether for food as well as gossip! So, Chinese lovers just bump in and give it a try!!!!

Feeling hungry around Camac Street?
Low on cash?
Blue Poppy is your call. A small but well accommodated restaurant located on the first floor of Sikkim House.

Food:
Tried Egg Fried Rice and Chilly pork. The chilly pork was out of the world. Pork was well cooked and you don‚Äôt have to jeopardise your set of canines, had pork fat attached along with, exactly the way I like my Pork.
Egg fried rice needs no mention, delicious as usual.
A plate of Egg Fried Rice and Chilly Pork would suffice two people.

Pros:
‚Ä¢ No extra tax
‚Ä¢ Super cheap

Cons:
‚Ä¢ Crowd in rush hour

Suggestion:  Try Fried Pork Momo and Fried Wantons.

Bill came around ‚Çπ340 for two (as I already mentioned no tax included).
Recommended.

They need to work on their service we weren't even provided with a glass of water.We were asked to order in 5 mins as the kitchen was about to close.So we ordered in haste.Chicken and veg momos,Chilli Garlic Chowmin and Sichuan Chicken was our order.Chicken momo was amazing,Veg momo was equally bad.It had no veggies only onion.Chowmin was moderate and boneless chicken had bits of bone in it.Highly overrated place.

I have to agree that this is one of the good joints to have a quick feed for momo and Chinese dish. Recently I enjoyed the mixed fried noddles Hakka and all the 3 types of momos prawn , chicken and pork . I also ordered chilli garlic prawn.
The only thing I would like to see change is prawn that was battered in sauce. While eating it I had the tail of the prawn that gave my mouth a wake up as I did not expect it attached . I recommend taking the tail out when battered in flour so that it does not cause unnecessary trouble while enjoying the food üòâ overall a nice place üëçüèæ

Whenever I crave for Chinese food I go to this place. This place is completely pocket friendly and the taste of their food give the feeling of authentic chinese and tibetan dishes. Now coming to the ambience, it is just like other common chinese restaurants. My personal favourite is mixed meifoon and rum chicken. Mixed meifoon taste so good that side dish can be optional to take. And rum chicken tastes different from regular chicken from regular restaurant.  Will surely visit this place in future many more times.

Went there today for lunch. The guy who took our order was friendly and helpful so that's a plus. We ordered Chicken pan fried momo, chicken fried rice, veg meifoon and Singapore chicken. The momos arrived first. They were spicy succulent and exploded in our mouth with a bunch of perfectly blended flavors. I would recommend the pan fried momos of this place. The rest of the dishes however were bland. I just liked the meifoon a fair bit because it was light and subtle. The chicken side was almost tasteless. And the fried rice was just mediocre. Overall a mixed experience.

I was introduced to this place by a friend who knows bhutanese food well and swears by this place. Over many visits I've had a lot of their offerings. So here's my review-

Food- You go to Blue Poppy for its food and while I'm not in love with it, I feel they do a decent job for the price. I've had Rice, Ema Dasi (cheese gravy) ,Pork Shapta, Momo (Chicken and Pork), Pan Fried Momo (Chicken and Pork) Phalay( Chicken) Noodles, Chicken Mensetse Soup, Noodles and Chilli Chicken. I've also had the Nepali Thali ( Rice ,Gundruk ,Kinema, Pork Curry).
I hated the Nepali Thali but i wont base my rating on it because it is probably an acquired taste.
The pork shapta was delicious juicy pork and the ema dasi is something that takes some time to get used to especially since you're having cheese with rice, but once you get a hang of it , it is heavenly. I didnt like the Chicken Mensetse soup as it was very very bland. The momos had juicy filling and was no Hut too big or small. The pan fried momos were friend momos dipped in sauce that you get everywhere. The noodles and chilly chicken were generic.

Service- The staff is not attentive and it takes a lot of effort to get their attention. Food arrives quickly though

Ambience- Very basic. Gets a bit uncomfortable in summers despite the AC. The place is always crowded so expect a lot of noise. The cheap quality plates and glasses and the refilled mineral water bottles are a big thumbs down.

A hidden gem, it is certainly not but its worth giving a try mainly because of the very competitive pricing and the quantity they offer.

If u want to have  good food,u may visit this place...though the ambience isn't gorgeous but this place strikes my mind when it comes to pocket friendly Chinese and Tibetan meals..we ordered :
1. Fried pork momo -it was tasty but couldn't differentiate between the taste of pork and chicken
2.mixed fried rice- nothing extraordinary but good enough and sufficient for two
3.chilli pork - i ordered "dried" and i liked it..you may try it too
4.honey garlic prawn - won't recommend..go for some other preparation as they put a lot sweetness and hamper the dish
The menu lacked desserts
Well recommended to students specially, according to my experience

The restaurant, in the first floor of Sikkim House, lists a wide variety of Nepali, Bhutanese, Tibetan and Chinese cuisine. Went in with a lot of expectations but was left dissapointed by their lack lusture service. We ordered Momo, Mixed hakka noodles and Pork Hot Garlic.. while the momo tasted good, the chicken being very tender, I am left wanting for more in the other two dishes. The restaurant is nothing much in terms of look, feel and decor but offers a wide variety of selection. Would like to try it some other time

This place is inside the Sikkim House, Camac Street, Kolkata. Quite small but amazing quality food and quantity is also sufficient. Pocket friendly, this place makes amazing Chicken Kothay momos (might be wrong with the name) but basically it is blend of steam and fried momos in one momo. The photo has been added. The Chicken Meifoon, Hot Garlic Chicken and Chicken sweet corn soup were also of great taste. Guys go and hit this place real soon of you haven't yet done the same ;)

Excellent food. Non pretentious. Good service. Place can be a lot cleaner. Been coming here for years. This place has better dim sums than most fancy places opened recently. Their menu is very extensive. Only downer is they shut very early. Last order is at around 9:30 pm. Highly suggested are the steamed dumplings sums. Chili sauce is to die for.  If you can't handle too much spice, order a maza before hand.

A nice restruarant...authentic chinese...a bit difficult to locate from the outside.you have to go to 1st floor of sikkim house at russel street.Food quality is above average.A very pocket friendly restruarant.Dry chillie pork is a must order here.You can also get served some delicious momos here.

When you need to satisfy your immense crave for momos, Blue Poppy surely won't disappoint you!

The pan-fried momos were extraordinarily good! The spicy garlic sauce in which it was dipped it, deserves a 5/5!

The ambience was quite good and even the service was a quick one!

A must try for momo lovers!

Simply loved the food here. This being a part of Sikkim House served authentic dishes which are very rarely known to us. Whenever my Sikkimese friends came down to Kolkata or when our budgets were low we would make ourselves comfy on the food served here. There was only 1 outlet during my time, now I see its grown to 3. Loved you , miss you....

Blue poppy has an amazing cuisine of Chinese as well as Tibetan food. It serves the best Chicken Momo's and chutnis . Yes it's true !
Well i had a big fat lunch, which included Veg Mushroom Hakka  Noodles, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken Manchurian, Crispy Chilly Babycorn and Chicken Momo's.
It is a good place to eat but the ambience is not good. The restaurant should look after the place well.
Overall it's an average place to go.

I love going back to this place for it's food quality and quantity off-course. :) This place is still the front runner when it comes to Pocket Friendly Chinese & Tibetan Meals. Almost tried every items on the menu and still hoping for some new surprises on my next visit.¬†
But few set backs are there as well and I think management should look into this. .
1: Plate sizes are really small and think they have changed it.¬†
2: They must consider Card payment option because this is not possible every time to carry hard cash if you are going in a large group.¬†
3: Please take care of the Air Conditioning.

I am not very fond of Chinese but my friend suggested this place. The ambience is pretty average (seemed little shabby to me coz of it's dim lights).
We ordered:
 Chicken steamed Momo- I expected better as it has a good name for serving authentic Chinese food. 
Pepper fried chicken (dry) - average.
Pork chilli garlic chow: this was good.
All items were light and decent in taste.
Prices are reasonable. 
The staff is attentive but they are too casual in serving food. It has more of an informal approach.

Quite a moderate experience. We had high expectations from this place, but somehow it lacked the overall pleasant experience. We ordered Chicken Steam Momos and Mixed Thukpa. The sauces were not seasoned so well, just because it's a chilli sauce doesn't mean you won't add anything but chilli. The soups along with the Momos were bland as hell. No taste whatsoever. The saving grace was the Thukpa. The noodles and the soup tasted nice. Staff was courteous enough. The tables are a bit too big, so you may have to sit a bit away from your friend to have to actually talk a little louder which is uncomfortable. Pocket wise, it's same as Tibetan Delight but the latter tastes better. Overall, a good spot for College students for a light lunch or hangout.

Situated at the 1st floor of Sikkim House near Maidan Metro, Camac Street, it's a pocket perfect restaurant for authentic Tibetan food.
I visited this outlet two times and worth it.
Lets talk about the food.

1. Chicken and Pork Pan fried Momo with Hot Garlic Sauce: I'm requesting every foodie or non-foodie, please been there and try it. 6 pieces of good size deep fry momos, with an excellent homemade hot garlic sauce. Just heavenly for momo lovers. I had it two times and felt that same happiness.

2. Mixed Maifoon: Actually it's rice noodles. Too thin noodles well cooked with vegis and good amount of non-veg items.

3. Mixed Rice: Ordinary mixed fried rice. Tastes good.

4. Dry Chilli Chicken: 6 pieces of chicken tossed in sauces with onions and capsicum. Nicely cooked and deserves a try.

5. Dry Chilli Pork: Please...... For god sake...have it. Excellent taste. Good amount of meat with fat portions. Nicely cooked with sauces. Loved it.

6. Lemon Fish: Tastes sweet. With a good flavor of lemon. Well cooked and soft pieces of fish.

Try to be there again soon.

A small and cozy food joint located on the first floor of sikkim house near maidan metro stn.. just a few mins walk from the metro gate no. 3.. This place being a speciality tibetian and Chinese food joint drags a lots of office goers and students as it is a pocket friendly restaurant..

We had ordered mixed chilli garlic chowmin and Singapore chicken.. Both was really good in taste.. and the quantity was enough for 2.. A good food joint without a load on your pocket..

They don't chrge any gst.. The prices are Inc.  Of taxes..

Located just near Maidan Metro station this place is a paradise for Chinese cuisine and Pork lovers .The more I visit this place the more I get inclined towards it. The signature dishes of this place are 
1) Pork Shapta 
2) Momos 
3) Mixed Fried Rice 
4) Chowmein .
The place is affordable and the delivery I'd quite fast as well.

I visited this branch twice, and had completely contrasting experiences. The first time I went, it was on a December evening. It was fully crowded, but we luckily got seats. The thenthup, thukpa and fried rice were amazing. The momos and chicken side dishes were average and a little disappointing. Service was bad. One staff member was a little rude and inhospitable. Still, I was determined to revisit.¬†The second time I visited, it was a busy Puja afternoon. Had to wait for 25 minutes to enter, and the kitchen was about to close. We ordered Baby corn, Chicken soup, Veg hakka noodles and chilly chicken. Except noodles, each dish was horribly prepared. The soup was too bland; The baby corn was disgusting. The chilli chicken was flavourless and uncooked. Ultimately, it was a thoroughly disappointing lunch and we left unhappily.

Let us consider all the factors one by one.
1. Coming to the ambience of the restaurant, it was pretty good compared to other mid range restaurants. The place was small but the environment amiable enough. The waiters were also friendly. Only thing was that , they forgot to serve us a glass of water -__-
2. Now coming to the main part. The FOOD. The one factor which surpasses others when it comes to restaurants ! Well in this category, the restaurant fails pretty badly. Leaving the momos aside, other dishes were abysmal starting from the noodles to the chicken preparations. 
.
.
We ordered a dish named On Chicken, hoping to taste something new. But to our surprise it tasted like fried meat balls inside a FANTA like juicy syrup. That was just the beginning. Then we order Chili chicken, hoping at least this would be good enough to satisfy our wants. But our bad, it tasted like fried chicken pieces dipped in chili sauce. Plus they even forgot serve us water in glasses. 
From that day onwards, we decided to avoid this restaurant whenever we go out. We even wanted to post a message in the sarahah account of this restaurant, only if this restaurant had one XD
.
.
Hence, this incident explains the poor rating !

Service: not good.Food wasn't served to our plates.Glasses weren't given,just a big bottle of water.
The food came out quick enough,though.
Taste: nothing remarkable,like last time.Not bland,just okay.I had particularly loved their RUM CHICKEN,even that didn't titillate our taste buds, like it did last time.
Quantity: exactly enough for 4persons with small appetite.70 rs on an average for one normal glass of flavoured soda, was a bit much.
Price: reasonable but considering the quantity given,it's on higher side.

Located at the first floor of Sikkim House , Middleton Row this is a popular joint in the locality. The sitting area is small & devoid of much decoration yet it is comfortable . The joint is frequented mostly by college & Office goers in the Camac Street / Park Street area . Have had momos on a few occasions & it is quite famous among the visitors . Today had the following items : 
Vegetable Hakka Chow : The dish is of good quality though the quantity of vegetables should be increased . The quantity is sufficient for a person & at their price it's definitely value for money .
Chilly Pork : Quantity is again sufficient . The pork pieces had lost their juices a bit & had become chewy which was a tad disappointing . The crunchy capsicum & onion pieces added nice taste to the dish .  
Overall a good & pocket friendly restaurant .

LOCATION-easy to reach.if u are travelling by metro den just use gate no3 exit..walk straight for about 5-7mins..in ur rit side you'll have the sikkim house.It's situated in the 1st floor of this building.
I have gone there for about 9to 10 times.and just loved it.It's a must try place for the pork and the momo lovers.
I have tried-momos,soups,pork,chiken,fish itens,rice,noodles.
Must try-momos of any kind,wonton soup,chilly garlic rice,chicken,pork sapta(i just love it).also pepper chicken is good,fish items are also nice.
IT'S A TAX FREE RESTAURANT
Staffs are well behaved,foods are served with not much delay.Busy in luch time.ambience is not that great though.

This was my second time... ambience was good... staff was very humble....must try for chinese lovers.. had ordered 
Chicken wantons- they come 1 inch size n are about 8 to 9 in a plate.. they r tasty no doubt but price was a bit high for dose miniature wantons

Chicken thukpa- gravy was very thin n lacked salt a lot ... very light in taste... a very healthy dish though...

Baby corn hakka chow - the best of all d dishes super yummy had big slices of baby corn which was a plus point...the serving is enough for two people

Veg manchurian- it was soft n tasty but were small n 6 in number gravy was too much not at a reasonable price...

Should try once..

One of the best momos i had here. Pork Momo in Blue Poppy (Sikkim House) is just outstanding. If one love chinese, i.e. Noodles, you can opt for mixed noodles where you'll definately going to get Egg, Chicken, Prawn and Pork (optional).Apart from Noodles, one can also opt for Rice. Side dish such as Chilly Pork, Chicken Hot Garlic, etc. will make your mood awesome.¬†If want to order soup, never ever drop an opportunity to order Chicken WANTON soup, you'll just fall in love with it.¬†No tax on food.¬†And the quality is just superb. Quantity is more than enough.¬†

Cost for 2 : will not exceed more than Rs 600.

The destination for pork fixes in the city. The unadulterated joy can never be defined - it has to be felt. We binged on pork - pork kothay, mixed thukpa with pork, mixed fried rice with pork again, and the signature dry chilli pork!! This is sheer haven.

Blue Poppy has over the years, and generations now, been a favourite. On a Thursday evening at 9, the 5 if us had to wait for a table. The food compensated for the wait. But wish there was at least a fan in the waiting area. Sorry, but we were so busy eating, that we forgot the pictures.@

Went there with my school friends, a group of 7 people, so had the liberty to order many items and taste their varieties. We ordered "pan fried pork momo with hot garlic sauce" for starters and frankly just blown away by the taste! What a start! Then we ordered "american chopsuey" "mixed fried rice" "chilli pork" "mixed cantonese chow" "hot garlic chicken" " lemon chicken". The last item namely " lemon chicken" was the only let down amongst all these wonderful dishes. With a moderate ambience and cordial staff members our visit was not bad at all!

Specially for pork lovers!!
Tried their Fish Manchurian, that too is out of the world!
This place is famous for its never ending queues, but the food wins over all the frustrations!
It belongs to the genre of those old chinese restaurants who doesn't really care much about the ambience or the staff's behaviour because they are pretty confident that they can make you turn up a million times with just their food!
Yes, The Blue Poppy does just that!
Good for a group of friends or colleagues looking for top class gastronomic delights who would not care much about the lack of luxurious comforts.
Personally, I'm going to visit this place a trillion times! *_*

‚àö Good Quality Food.
‚àö Very much Pocket Friendly. ( It's damn cheap)
‚àö Not so small, not so big Sitting Area.
‚àö Staff Behaviour: Friendly.
‚àö Good Location.

Food items tasted here:

Chicken Fried Wontons : Small , Fried wontons..Little bit oily though! Okay types, nothing more to add on this particular dish!

Steam Pork Momo: Momo is always a good idea. Solid chopped and highly minced Pork wrapped in a thin coating of flour based wrapper. Properly cooker and highly delicious! 

Prawn Manchurian: The perfect dish that goes with any kinda rice. Prawns are of very big sizes..Bigger than the normally available in restaurants. Properly cooked to give a nice texture to the red gravy. No of prawns and the sizes of the prawns deserved to be mention particularly. Paisa wasool dish!

Sweet and sour Pork: As suggested by the staff, but it turns out to be the most horrible dish of that day. Cube pieces of Pork along with sweet n sour combination turned out to be a disastrous dish. Pork was not well cooked. Not at all good. A typical smell was coming from this Pork dish.

Chicken Fried Rice: Long rice grain, good to taste. Visible chicken chunks, satisfied with the quantity they served too. More than enough for two persons.



Highly Recommended! Do visit this place !

Am sorry to say the standard has gone down considerably.. Just purchased a plate of chicken Momo which was okayish..but we were shocked to see the quantity of chilly mushrooms..there were hardly 6 small pieces of mushrooms (that too 3cut in halves to make 6) with 2-3 onions and capsicum in the entire platter.. The Thai soup was inadequate as well.. Not even half a container.. Quantity has gone down drastically.. What a shame.. Never again for me.

Located in the famous Sikkim House building, the place is a bit difficult to find especially for people who are new in kolkata.

Now, lets talk about its ambience first. The place is a very peaceful and quite one with some nice decor which gives you good feel of an authentic chinese restaurant.

Coming to the food, you will be left with no regrets after the end of your meal. The quality of food is very good with some nice variety of soups to start with.

Lastly the place is very hygenic but the service they provide is a bit disappointing.

If you want to try authentic momos then this is the place! So far the best momos I have ever had. Authentic Sikkimese and Tibetan cuisines are right here! The dishes are drool worthy starting from a varied range of thalis to momos,thukpas,Chinese chicken dishes,noodles and much more. If you want to get the real taste of momos then visit this place as soon as possible! I had rum chicken also, which was superb. The service is fast and friendly. The place is quite spacious. Crowded almost every time with people though you can wait outside. The ambiance is great in short very friendly and home kind of atmosphere! Definitely one of my favs! :)

The blue poppy is located in a very prominent position in the heart of the city with mostly visited by college goers and office workers.
They offer a variety of tibetan dishes at a pocket friendly price.

This place is crowded on most days when one has to wait for about 15mins before getting a seat.
By the food makes the wait worth it.
The momos have always been great so last time when I ordered for the Chicken fried momo,the experience wasn't any different. They were perfect as usual.
But this time I tried something for the first time here,which is the pork thukpa and I must mention this,I did not like the thukpa at all because there was a certain smell to it which made me nauseated and I couldn't have it any further.I hope they look into it and improve the quality and taste of the pork thukpa.

But I would still be going back for their momos :)

This is my favourite place when it comes to Chinese food. Situated near Maidan Metro, this place is a hidden gem! Well lit place, well behaved staff and good food. 
I've tried the Veg and Mixed Hakka noodles, their garlic chicken and some other chicken variants, Chicken pan fried momo in hot garlic sauce and normal steamed momos as well. 

The food is incredible! Also they serve a nice amount of rice or noodles. The momos taste great and the best part is they don't levy any taxes üòÅüòÅ Big plus point for students like me!

It is no doubt a pocket friendly restora.. Ambience is so so. I liked the chicken pan fried momo.. It has a total tibetan flavour which I got in Gangtok only. Then after we took a mixed noodles.. I must say the noodles quality was really down trodden...with that we took Singapore chicken which was not worth enough.. Only the momo and baby corn crispy I liked... Lastly we were eating and some people were waiting.. So one lady (probably the restaurant owner)told us to finish our food asap which was disheartening... We waited long but how can a person say another to make it fast in case of eating????üòìüòì

I just had one dish from this small, homely restaurant in Middleton Row - a plate of Pork Momo.
Its a masterpiece. Soft, with tender pork, just the right amount of onions and spices, cooked to perfection.
To be polished off with that fiery sauce that they serve! Hope for more visits in future for the other Chinese dishes!
P.S. : thumbs up for being pocket friendly!

Blue Poppy is a treasure tucked away on the first floor of Sikkim House. They have been serving the same humble food for years and they have been doing it well.
Everything you try will be delicious - vegetarian or non vegetarian.The momos are probably one of the best in the city. The pork momos are great. We also love the pan fried momos and kothay. The other dishes are amazing as well but nothing beats the momos here.
The place is busy every time of the day. Service is decent and the servers are polite and attentive.
This place is an absolute favourite of mine so this review probably sounds a little biased (full disclosure) but this place is an absolute gem and a must must try!

The name and description of the place seemed inviting enough for me to drop in a visit for dinner one evening. The restaurant is slightly cramped and especially on a weekend evening it is difficult to find a free table. The service is prompt and friendly. We ordered a plate each of chicken steamed momos and chicken pan fried momos and chicken shyapta with Tibetan buns. The steamed momos were reallyyyyy good. The pan fried momos not so much. They were more sweet than spicy and the sauce seemed to be made of just tomatoes. The shyapta was okayish but I have had better ones in kolkata. The typical chilli chutney was so spicy that we went through four bottles of mirinda during the meal. Gotta try the pork momos next time!

After hearing a lot of good reviews of this place thought of trying it out and I must say it did not disappoint me at all. On entering the place one might have a negative impact as it does in no way look like anything more than a office canteen. But the variety of food served is in no way less than any good joint. I ordered chicken clear soup and went on to have this place's signature dish of chicken shapta and chilly pork with mixed hakka chow. The quantity I must say is on the lower side. Three bowls of chow is sufficient for 4 people. But quanlity wise it was great. And with respect to the cost its even greater. And one thing to notice is that they don't have any added taxes. Its the first place since 1st of July I didn't have to pay any GST. Staff behavior is good if not great. But one could argue that the authority could upgrade the interior as lighting is not upto the mark as some tables have very dismal lighting and feels like you are having food in a road side dhaba.

Wanton tasted rubbish.
Chicken shafta n meifoon was really delicious.It tasted absolutely awesome.Fried rice was not extraordinary although it tasted good.Overall a very good restaurant to try out Chinese and tibetian delicacy.Pocket pinch for those 4 items is only Rs.660.Another good thing they do not charge extra tax.

The place is little confusing as there was no hording and the restaurant is in the 1st floor of the building. In the ground floor there is a office! So they should put a board writing the direction
Now the restaurant is normal . there was no such decorations and staffs were so careless! 
We ordered chicken soup , chicken fried rice and orange chicken and limka
They gave all the items all together! 
The soup was a bowl of water with some chicken pieces and some spring onion! -_-
Now the rice was okay as well as the chicken item. But still nothing was up to mark
The quality and quantity both is needed to be increased

'The Blue Poppy' is famous for its authentic and delicious Chinese and Tibetan dishes. Finally,I was able to visit last week with my friends.

It is located on the first floor of 'Sikkim House'.A five minute walk from Maidan metro will take one here.

We went for Pan fried chicken momo and frued pirk momk first. The pan fried chicken momo was delicious but could have been a bit spicier.The fried pork momo was delicious to say the least which ked us to order more pork dishes for our main course.

Next we went for egg-chicken hakka noodles,mixed noodles,pork shapta and rum.chicken.One bowl of  oodles was enough for two people.The pork of the pork shapta was s bit chewy but delicious. The name rum chicken is misleading as it did not have a hintbof rum in it,but it was delicious.

The staff was well-behaved and amiable in nature.I will definitely visit again.

During a college break when you run and can‚Äôt find good food that's very sad. But St. Xavier's people are very lucky since they have a perfect option for retreat. Whether you have 50 or 60 still you can get food here. Sikkim House is a Sikkim Government run stay. It has a restaurant named Blue Poppy. It is a perfect college hangout destination. Serving hot tasty and cheap food. Featuring food from North Eastern States and Bhutan. Since this is a government based enterprise, They do not charge VAT hence the food cost is significantly reduced. So what is the best things you should have. Being a Vegetarian I can only comment on that.

1.Veg. Steam Momo Rs. 80

2. Panfried Veg Momo in hot garlic Sauce Rs. 100

3.Veg. Phalay ( These are like big stuffed parathas stuffed with the momo filling) Rs. 60

4. Veg. Thentuk ( Square shaped flat noodles in a sikkimese soup) Rs. 100

5. Hakka Chow Rs. 90

6. Chilly Garlic Rice Rs 100

7. Chilly Garlic Noddles rs. 100

8. Chilly Babycorn Rs. 100

9. Veg Munchurian Rs. 90

I usually try out steamed rice, plastered with Ema Dasi/ Q Dasi , wantons, fried momos, and all types of chicken dishes, coupled with a bottle of 7up or sprite. I really love this place.

Located in the Sikkim House building and easy to locate from Maidan Metro Station towards the Jeevandeep gate.
Coming to food,we tried a Bhutaneese dish Q-dasi which was prepared with cheese chili and potato,tastes more of a soup;it was good when served hot.And to main dishes we ordered Chili garlic pork chow,mixed cantoneese chow,pork fried rice with side dishes Singapore fish and Rum Chicken.Though we came to know Rum Chicken had no such gravy and it served the purpose of our starter.
The quantity and quality appealed us.Rum Chicken and Q-dasi were our new try and was good indeed.Mixed cantoneese chow had a bit of gravy and Singapore fish was not so spicy.
And coming about price;its so very pocket friendly even after having from refreshing drinks to trying out so many dishes.
Small joint with no such decor but a pleasant ambience.

The Blue Poppy inside the Sikkim House building is almost diagonally opposite to the Loreto College back gate. Due to its proximity and of course amazing pan-fried momos, this place is always buzzing with students. 
The best part is it's very pocket friendly and one cannot complain about the quantity. I could never finish my lunch here on time and therefore always ended up parcelling my food specially the yummylicious baby corn. :) 
Shoutout to all all those who cross Middleton Road in Hunger.. Please drop in here! It's worth it.

So I dropped in yesterday with my friend for some pork. Haven't had it in a while. 
It's not at all hard to locate. It's on the 1st Floor of Sikkim house in Middleton Street. 
The decor is okay-ish and a bit dark on the inside. We settled for some Mixed Pork fried rice, Chilly pork and Schezwan pork. The rice was very well prepared with ample amount of chicken and pork. I really loved the Chilly pork which was dry and a bit tangy. Could have been a bit more spicy. But the Schezwan pork was very bland and I didn't like the taste of it. And most of the items on their menu are shredded and not whole pieces. I had better pork in my previous encounters. Overall the food was okay-ish and can't really say much about the ambience cause it sucked.

Had heard a lot about this place from friends and acquaintances , so it was surely on my bucket list.
For a first timer , the outlet is a bit hard to locate, being on the first floor of Sikkim House without any billboards outside. However overall my first visit was definitely a great one. 

Food : We ordered two items. The Fried Chicken MOMO and Chicken Thukpa. 
MOMO(8 pc serving): Pretty good. The filling was moist and tasty. The covering was well Fried. A bit on the costly side , considering other Kolkata MOMO outlets.
Price:140‚Çπ
Thukpa: Dish of the day for us. The serving was pretty large even after we shared only 1 plate. Noodles were  nicely moist and easy down the throat. The broth was superb.
The Ambience should probably be improved. But overall a good experience. Definite 2nd visit.a

Really pleased with the food and the service. Quality is good and quantity is also enough for two persons. We had Chicken Wontons, mixed fried rice and Singapore chicken. A bowl of Singapore chicken contained 6 big pieces of chicken along with gravy. The mixed fried rice was full of chicken and prawn. The decor is rather simple. Only thing is that this place is a bit tricky to locate, first you have to locate the Sikkim House and then ask anyone there, they will direct you to this restaurant. One of the best restaurant in Kolkata that serve authentic Chinese food.

Food is great. Service also prompt. Didn't like the prawn item but chicken was good. Rice and noodles are good and the momos are great. The prices are quite satisfactory.

What can i say about this place... The most important thing is the way they cook..and how quick they do it.
The phalay was filled with meat n fried gently so it tasted darn good. And not that spicy.
Stir fried greens... One of my favorite for generations..garlicky..soft...crunchy greens..who would even think that a meat lover is saying all these..
Q dasi... The difference maker. And the most lonely dish in the cuisine i think...melting cheese gravy in red chilli flakes along with boiled potato... This dish is always on my list whenever i visit the place...
Mix thukpa... Stick to basics...bland...nutritious...meaty...veggies...broth...bough to life in tibetian way...excellent.
Mix chilli garlic noodles...well what can i say..if you have gone through the menu and still couldn't decide shit.. Then go for it... I'm sure the quantity is quite enough for two...well balanced spicing on request...not oily as well.
The people don't serve food on your plates..so always be prepared for that...this a joint..not a fine dine restaurant...
Overall...I'm always a fan of this place if you are looking for authentic tibetian...

Located in the first floor of Sikkim House, The Blue Poppy is one of the best authentic Chinese restaurants of Kolkata. The place is moderately large in size and serves authentic Chinese dishes. We had Pork Momos which was recommended by Zomato and it tasted very good. The Pork Mantsetse Soup was fantastic to taste. They serve it quite large enough to fill the appetite of 2 people and the taste of the dish completely took us in. Would definitely visit again. It is worth mentioning that the restaurant remains closed from 4-5 and it starts emptying at about 3. So it's advisable not to visit around that time.

This place has the best pork shapta and momos in Calcutta. Kothays are great as well. There are a number of Tibetan dishes to choose from and if you love spicy food this place is probably one of the best.

With the sun rays trying to almost consume you in a Calcutta summer, me and my friend made our way to Blue Poppy for lunch. This was my second visit, the first time was just a pan-fried momo meal. This time it was different. Pork wantons was our starter while some lime soda our drink.
Then came the veg fried rice, ample quantity of it. Sides were Pork Shapta and Fish Manchurian. The Manchurian was tasty while the pork was very spicy. So spicy that I had to order another sweet lime soda. But the place is, as you'll find out, value for money. Good food at relatively lower prices. Will visit again.

Probably the cheapest eatery serving Tibetan in the city, considering their quality and quantity.
The chicken dishes are actually tasty and not dry and fibrous like most places. Pepper chicken has become my new favourite thanks to them. Also loved the gravy Chow..add a little vinegar,and it tastes like heaven.
The gravy of the pan fried momos were however a let down, being just a combination of tomato sauces with no spice or chopped veggies.
The shyapta on my first visit long back was a little dry , will definitely go back to try it again, along with their thukpas. 
The place is always bustling with customers so you might have to wait for a table.

Walking around camac street you could have never guessed such an authentic Chinese cuisine joint that to located in interiors of sikkim house. Typical old school hangout place with great choice of momos, noodles and many more. Another thing if budget is a constraint you should definitely try this place since this does not burn a hole in your pocket. We tried out momos, noodles, one of their speciality that is Shapta. Loved this place and would highly recommend anyone who is a die hard momo lover like I am and does not like WOW MOMO :)

It's a restaurant in the Sikkim house just off camac street in the lane leading to Jeevan Deep. A little difficult to locate the place as no sign board is there. One has to locate Sikkim house and then enter the building to locate a restaurant in the first floor of the building without a single sign board saying the name of the place! Usually flocked by office goers who go there for a meal. If you are going with a big group, be prepared you will have to work a little before you can arrange a seat for everyone. Coming to food, nothing extraordinary. We had pan fried momo, mixed fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. Sweet and sour chicken didn't taste like sweet and sour. There was nothing sweet and sour in the dish. The mixed fried rice was a bit low on quantity and the pan fried momo was just about fine. The ambience of the place nothing extraordinary and might get devoid of food so you better be lucky. Overall not a must go restaurant but a fine one.

A small cozy restaurant with various options to try. Value for money food as portions are quite enough. I ordered pan fried pork momo in hot garlic sauce and veg meifoon with Chicken Manchurian. Momos were really good with little bit crispy. I liked the rice noodles as they were light on stomach. If you are planning for lunch then try and reach there by 1-1:15 pm as you'll have to wait for sometime after that since it is lunch hour in offices and many college students also come to this place :p

Well this chineese food joint is situated inside Sikkim House..the decor and ambience is not so flambouyant and sophisticated...the service is quick but the the staff could be better trained and informed since the guy serving us couldnot differentiate between pork fried rice and chicken fried rice...the food is nice...we had singapore chicken which was spicy and manchurian chicken which was nonspicy but both were delicious...the fried rice was cooked well but could taste a little bettr...the major postive is that the price is on the lower side and it is a good choice for sudden eating out plans like it was with me....

The rum chicken is a delight and I would personally recommend everyone to try this one here. Also tried the chilli pork but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. But still the pork was very much eatable. The price is also quite cheap and no extra taxes. Overall a good experience.

Blue poppy is situated inside manipur house and has a good parking space. It is a small place with lots of varieties. It is my fav place to go anytime. I like chicken momos, (fried, pan fried and steamed). I ordered prawn chow..which Is simple chow noodles with prawns that is cooked very well.Another option is chilly garlic chow but it is a bit spicy. Another good point is that that their service is instant. I would love it if they have a good chutney with momos because the chutney they serve is full of chilly flakes and is very very spicy. Overall a nice place.

Low on cash but desperate for some good food, The Blue Poppy is the first place that comes to my mind. Been to this place numerous times, lost the count. Its located on the first floor of the Sikkim House.

Coming to food, the place serves quality chinese cuisines, famous for pan fried momos, chili pork etc. Also tried their meifun, chopsey, fried rice, chili chicken, never disappointed.

Much recommended...

If one is looking for some authentic chinese or tibetan delicacy at a reasonable rate, then this is one of the best places in Kolkata. It's an eating joint in Sikkim House. There are three braches of The Blue Poppy, I visited only one branch (the camac street branch) till now. It's a walking distance from maidan metro station. It's an air-conditioned small resturant with nice ambiance.
Okay, now coming to the main part, and undoubtedly that is food. I visited this place for once that's why couldn't try many items and even couldn't try any pork item. I tried chilli garlic noodle which was really tasty and spicy, though I made it too spicy by adding their special red chilli sauce, which is just too much spicy. Try this sauce, spicy food lovers. As side dish, ordered Singapore chicken which was ok ok type. After that, comes the dry chicken manchurian. Dry chicken manchurian became the champion! That was really yummy with some tender chicken pieces and fried minced onion, garlic, ginger, spring onion. I liked the dry chicken manchurian the most. So this was all for the food part.
 Now coming to their service. The service is one of the best things about this place as that was really fast. Their fast service won my heart as I was really hungry. Last but not the least, there is no tax! Yes, you read right!
I'm sure about one thing and that is, I will definitely visit this place as soon as possible as they serve some good authentic Chinese food at reasonable rate and even without any tax.

                        Food is ok & nothing great, never liked the food here, but have to with my momo loving friends.. the restaurant is value for money for the location.

Most of the stuff like soup, thukpa etc. whenever i have tasted is very bland in taste. You need to add sauces & spices to it to make it eatable..

If you are planning to go during lunch time, always hit the restaurant at 1 pm otherwise, you'll have to wait in long queue..

Located right opposite to Loreto College, a very popular joint among the students of Loreto and Xavier‚Äôs, the kudos of the food motivated me to check out the momos' of this place. Had ordered for pan-fried chicken momo. In addition, yes, the momos were delicious! The sauce preparation was just Awesome!!!! Although a very small joint, which can hardly accommodate too many people, but considering its cosy and friendly environment people love rolling in. Prices are steep; otherwise, it is a thumb up!

Probably not at the most conspicuous location, since it is inside Sikkim House, the Blue Poppy offers good food, cozy environment and is actually pretty popular. Pan fried monos with the hot spicy sauce is not for the faint-hearted! The chilli pork, while being somewhat less in quantity, was good to eat with all the veggies.
As a whole, it's worth visiting more than once.

I have visited all the 3 outlets and loved them. I visited this outlet on christmas eve and had to wait for half an hour to get a table. Service was quite good. We had ordered fried chicken momo, mixed fried rice, chicken egg hakka chow, pepper chicken , garlic chicken and fresh lime soda. If you love tibetan food then you must visit this place.

During lunch time this place gets crowded. However I tried steamed chicken momos, fried chicken, chicken hakka noodles, garlic chicken, chilli baby corn etc. The dish I liked most is their chicken momos. It is served with a spicy chutney...goes well with plain soft drinks. This place is a must try for momo lovers. üòä

The 8 pieces of juicy momo is heavenly. A must try for all.  The mixed noodles along with chilli chicken is tasty. Other than that, chinese items they provide won't really disappoint a food lover. Absolutely worth it. The prices are reasonable also. Recommended.

Blue Poppy is one of my favourite restaurants and is located just opposite to my college. I keep going there and always order momos, wantons, noodles, fried rice etc. The food is really good and addictive according to me. It serves authentic Chinese dishes and all the dishes that I have tasted till date, I have no complains. The service is really impressive and the price is very reasonable. 
Blue Poppy is more like a hangout place for me as I get to sit with my friends with good food. If you are passing by Russell Street, then you must visit this restaurant.

One of my favourite destinations to satisfy my crave for good food.

Don't have sufficient money?  No worries, Blue Poppy to the rescue. 
300 bucks and 2 people will be able to easily fill their stomach with food.

Have been here for several times and never left the place with a heavy heart. Very reasonable place with a proper environment.  The only backdraw is, they take a bit of time to serve your order. But you know as they say, "slow and steady wins the race!"
They definitely win the race of filling your heart and tummy with joy.

If you take my words, I would ask you to order manchurian pork and chilli garlic mixed rice.
You can thank me later. üòä

We ordered hot garlic chicken, the chicken  was stale, cold, gravy is tasteless, filled with tomato ketchup. No garlic anywhere! Fried rice quantity was too less for 2 people. If you want to eat cold and quick food, visit. Otherwise spare yourself the horror.

We ordered panfried pork momo in hot garlic sauce which was probably the best pan-fried momo I have ever tasted. Next for mains we ordered chilly garlic noodles and pepper chicken . Chilly garlic noodles was an absolute delight to the taste buds and the pepper chicken was a perfectly completenting it. Prices are very reasonable.

The blue poppy been in the town for years now but sadly, it is not the same anymore. The quantity decreased as well as its quality. Today we ordered for pan fried pork momo and it came with plenty of tomato ketchup on it which is not at all tasty. Then we ordered for mix fried rice which is alright, chilli pork and Singaporean chicken. Both were alright. The service was quick but however, it was not the same for hakka noodles that we ordered. We waited for a long time, around 20mins for hakka noodles for it to come. It was below expectation and it wasn't anything great. We were still not full ( 4 of us ) so we ordered two more plates of pork steamed momo which were by far, the best. The bill came around rs1500. Reasonable price if divided among 4, service was great. Food? So-so. It fell in terms of quality of food.

Perfect.... Just perfect fried momo.... Crisp and thin crust and just enough spicy stuffing and no oil dripping. Not only the fried ones, even the boiled and pan saut√© ones.... Just perfect.

Thukpa... Again perfect and original... Not just some noodle in some chicken broth.

Gravy noodles... Again so different from the others... Pure boiled gravy... Mix it up with crispy chilli pork... Awesome.

Shapta, meifoon, phalay and so on.... Each one is perfect.

And finally the best.... Dry chilli pork.... With the right mix of lean and fat meat, with pieces of fried chilli, onion, pepper, garlic.... It is just awesome... Take home and try alongside chilled beer.

I have come here n number of times for 3 years when my office was in Minto park. 

The service is warm. Although I don't know the waiter's name but he has never called to recognize me and smile. 

The decor is Sikkimese.

Just keep note it remains closed between 4 to 5 pm and one one particular Sunday that I do not remember.

Blue Poppy is a pocket friendly chinese and tibetian food joint.
The ambience is okayish, not too good, but the staffs were cordial.
As it is a chinese food joint it was mandatory to order momos. Their chicken pan fried momos are awesome, it's spicy but very very delicious.
We had ordered Chicken American Chopsuey, and we were very disappointed after having it. Somehow I felt that the gravy wasn't cooked properly and the sauce was sweet.
The Chicken Meifoon was good and for side dish we had taken Chicken Hot Garlic, which went well with the meifoon.
You can vist the place for good chinese food.

We had Noodles, Momo & chilly chicken, Chicken Pork. Noodles was average. Momos were great. Chilly pork is just yumm!! But Chilly chicken was too dry. Will again visit for the Chilly Pork & momo.

Visited this restaurant one month ago by a suggestion of one of my foodie friend. As I‚Äôm the great fan of Tibetan dishes, he suggest me to go and try their some popular dishes.

Location ‚Äì Easy to find. Locate the Gate no 3 of Maidan Metro and take the lane towards the Vardhan Market. After few step, you can see Sikkim House at the right foot. Blue Poppy is at the first floor of that building. As there is no such Banner or display board, so you might face a little trouble finding this restaurant for the first time.

Ambiance and Management ‚Äì Classy look with hanging Chinese lantern light from roof and basic chair table sitting arrangement. When we reached there it was almost 7:30pm but is was full so we have to wait for table, this shows how much popular the restaurant is! Service is quick, the stuff who gave us menu card was very polite and very suggestive also.

Menu & Food ‚Äì Blue Poppy provides a wide variety of Chinese, Tibetan, Nepali dishes. But from all of them we ordered Pan Fried Chicken Momo in Hot Garlic Sauce as a starter and Egg Noodles, Veg Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken.

Pan Fried Momo ‚Äì It was taken as per suggestion of the waiter boy. He said that it is hot favorite item there, so we order this one. Eight pieces big sized chicken momo were there. Momos are well fried in crispy way and also well dipped and cooked in Hot garlic sauce.

Fried rice and Noodles ‚Äì Both are very lite in nature. No excess oil was there and cooked in very well manner. In Veg Fried Rice less amount of veggies are there but egg noodles was just perfect. One thing which is very much noticeable is that the quantity of each main course item. The quantity in not sufficient for two persons. For one person it might goes well but not for two. Overall ok.

Chilly Chicken ‚Äì Now came the most worst part. When the item to our table it was dry chilly chicken. No sign of gravy, just some chopped onion, capsicum and six pieces mid sized chicken was there. Chicken pieces are ok, cooked well but lack of gravy make this one a worst one. It was totally unexpected from us.

With all the item mentioned above, it cost around 500INR, which is pretty decent one in term of amount. But when it comes about quantity The Blue Poppy failed to keep its expectation. In conclusion I want to say that Office area, quick bite item and low cost of every item is the main UPS for this restaurant. I personally think if they look about the matter of quantity, it will be great. Overall ok ok type dining experience. Nothing great.

Mouth watering pork shapta. Momos were amazing as the skin was thin and the stuffing was done generously.  Fried pork momos and chicken fried rice is what we happily indulged in.  Excellent service guys :)

Located at the 1st floor of sikkim house, middleton row, this place boasts for having large no. of customers swarming in all day. They serve the best steamed momos presently in the locality. I also tried my first non veg momo here. They are delicious, i should say. Shezwan noodles n soups are also its speciality. The rated are also very reasonable. The ambience is not so good but the service is nice.

The Blue poppy is located on the opposite road of Vardhan Market at Camac Street area. 

It mainly serves Chinese & Tibetan dishes.

Ambience is nice with sitting arrangements  but there is always a rush here.

Service is bit slow.

Tried Crispy Baby Corn &  steam Chicken Momo. Both were nicely made and were palatable. Momo had nice stuffings too. Sauce provided with momo was also tangy.

Prices are reasonable.

A decent place to have food .

Was really disappointed with this place....Had heard a lot about this place but when I visited it didn't live up to my expectations. The place was crowded and there was waiting. Eventually when we got a seat we had to share a table with some others! ( Not agreeable). The ambience also was a let down, somewhat shabby,not maintained well. It's named Blue Poppy, which is a beautiful exotic flower, but the restaurant doesn't live up to its name at all.!! The food was okayish. The veg steamed momos were great with the Chilli Momo sauce. My friends also praised the chicken momos.  In mains the veg Hakka noodles were also ok. The fried rice was good. The chicken side dish which my friends ordered was not to their liking. It was too watery,the gravy should have been thicker!! There was no service to speak of, the servers just came and put everything on the table, we had to serve ourselves!!

The Blue Poppy is my favorite momo joint in the city. Located near City Center 1 and Middleton Row, it serves momo cravings throughout the city. 
I first came across this little unassuming Tibetan restaurant just outside my school while exploring the neighborhood. And once I tasted their pan fried momo with garlic gravy, I became an instant regular at Blue Poppy. Their momos are to die for. I also love the other Tibetan delights they offer. The staff is good and service is quick. 

The Cons: The restaurant is pretty small and therefore always crowded. I wish the owners invested more on the decor and silverware. The silverware reminds me of roadside eateries and makes the food look less appetizing. The biggest problem I feel is that The Blue Poppy does not accept cards, only cash. 

Reasonably priced, Blue Poppy offers an array of Tibetan and Nepali Food. It is a must-try for all momo lovers.

Went to Blue Poppy finally. Very near to Maidan metro station, its easy to find. Situated on the first floor of Sikkim house. Its got a capacity of around 50 people. The staffs were very courteous. Requested for a Nepali non veg thali and Pepsi. It was served pretty fast. The food was cooked and had the same flavor as I had tasted in Nepal. But this was much towards home cooked / simple food rather than a restaurant kind with loads of garnish. Food is sufficient for 1person. The pork curry was yumm. Will surely visit again and try the other cuisine they serve. 
PS they are closed from 4pm till 5pm

I had this place on my wishlist for a long amount of time & finally i had the opportunity to visit this lovely place. Located on 1st floor inside sikkim house, the place has decent sitting capacity of around 25-30 covers. Be wary of queues specially on weekend during lunch time.

Anyways we got our place instantly & the ambience was very pleasant overall. We ordered the following:-

1. Steamed chicken momos - It had 8pcs of decently sized soft warm momos. The filling was tasty & had pure chicken bits. The condiment momo sauce gave a spicy kick to our taste buds.

2. Chicken chilli garlic rice - Quantity wise this should serve 2 people adequately unless you are a glutton. The taste was superb. The rice had a good aroma along with the contents of the dish. Chicken & egg bits were in generous amounts. Loved the dish.

3. Chicken meifoon - Again very good in terms of quantity served. The meifoon was surely the star of our main course. It had proper taste of chinese hand made noodles. Again the contents of the dish were very generous. Recommended dish!!

4. Dry chilli pork - Dish of shredded dry pork made with onions,chillies & capsicum. The pork was tad overcooked due to the dry texture as per our requirement but overall the dish was spot on. Loved this as well.

The main attraction of this place would be the menu pricing & the value for money which it provides. Ot just cost 300 per head for our meal. One issue for me was the service since we had a mixed experience of it. The serving of food was on time but we were left to plead for water glass since we weren't provided any initially. That could be improved a bit but otherwise no major complains as such.

the food is good when you want to eat in a low budget on a regular basis. bt the consistency in taste and quality is poor. somedays its good, sometimes great to awful (on my recent visit). the momos n wantons are generally good.the dip in taste or quality is in the main course. on a less spicier side try Singapore chicken. chilli garlic chicken is good on the spicier side. thukpa i somehow wont recommemd here.

Its a bit diffiuclt to find; get down at Maidan metro station and walk towards Rabindra Sadan. You will have to take a left. Sikkim House is the landmark you have to ask people for. Famous for their pan fried momos in hot, tangy, dry sauce, they are a no-frills, serious Chinese-Tibetan-Nepali cuisin restaurant, originally meant for the Sikkim guest house. The decor is very basic. Overall the place is amazing, though it is difficult to find a table. The service is good, but you will usually find this place crowded. The prices are very, very reasonable.

Undoubtedly, the BEST place in Kolkata that serve pork items. Not only that, their chicken items are equally good. Though they have recently increased their price tag, yet, it is acceptable compared to the quality and quantity. My recommendations here would be Pork Steamed Momo, Dry Chilly Chicken, Pork Shapta.

Again this place comes under authentic Chinese and Tibetan Eateries and the pros is very pocket friendly.
Quick Service, Hot Food are the usb of this place.
Ambiance is just simple. But you are just going to love the food.

Cons: This place is so over-crowded that you will need to wait in a long queue.

This place is great if you want cheap and good food. The restaurant is as cosy as a living room in a Sikkimese locality. They serve food without any hurry . It goes without saying you must start with a plate of steam momo chicken/pork followed by a thai soup. You may go for another plate of the same depending on the amount of hunger. We tried both wanton and Phalay but , wantons were good , although they were a folded version of fried momo but the phalay was mindblowing ! Then we ordered Pork Shapta an mixed fried rice. Pork Shapta won my heart. ¬†In short it is a place which can be visited again and again when you have a 'big hunger'

This friendly little restaurant located at Sikkim House, Russel street focussed on Tibetian cuisine.It‚Äôs a small joint with a very simple d√©cor and friendly staff. It is usually buzzing with people and you might usually have to wait. The menu is extensive offering a wide variety of dishes to choose from. I‚Äôm totally in love with the Pan fried momos, yummilicious. Even the steam one is also worth a go. The piping hot soups they serve are a great way to start and I would definitely like to recommend the Chicken Hot & Sour soup. From the main course section the mixed chowmein and chicken fried rice deserves special mention along with the Chicken/Pork Shapta. That‚Äôs an absolute delight. Even the Dry Pepper Chicken can also click your taste bud. The portion is very good but they lack in sevice. This place is really light on your pockets and is definitely close to heart.

Among ¬†the busier streets of the town lies a place catering flavours of the beautiful Himalayas and its more beautiful people...

Today's list included :

As recommended by a friend, we had Pan Fried Pork Momo in Hot Garlic Sauce... And, believe or not, your taste buds will surely get to know a new level of hotness when you are too busy gulping it down!!!!!!

Now, in the main course, we ordered Mixed Meifoon and Rum Chicken...
Meifoon was pretty good both in quantity and quality...

But, the Rum Chicken was a kind of a serendipity for me...¬†
The inexplicable essence of rum fused into deepest of layers of chicken left me bewildered... And the alcohol lingered for so long in my olfaction, it seemed non-perishable...

Ambience is okayish with lot of northern people gathering in here, the service is good and last but not the least, the food is really cheap!!!!!!!!!

I couldn't help myself to take a note to visit here again...

Pan fried momo stood out as the best here. Fried momo was ok, didn't like the pan fried though.  Noodles were tasty and high on chilli level. Make sure you order some coke before hand. Recommended to add some deserts to the menu.

I visited the place on this new year's eve by having a conception of how good their salt lake branch is,but i hate to say that i was utterly disappointed. They are known for good Chinese food but shame on them for maintaining such a low food quality. At first we ordered crispy baby corn,  which was just some boiled baby corn dipped in sauce of low quality with very less quantity. Then we found out that it was also cold. We also ordered mixed Chinese chopsuey and except carrot and green capsicum there was no other vegetables in it and the noodles was pretty thin. We had to waste most of the food for it's poor quality. They also don't have any proper bill. I think if they do some analysis then they will find out that there are really some depreciation regarding their customer satisfaction.

Well I visited this place a few days ago, in a hunt for good food at a reasonable price. To begin with, in spite of it being lunch time and being crowded, the staff was cordial and did help us in placing our orders. The place is well kept and clean though a bit dingy. We had ordered pan fried momos in garlic sauce which was pure delicacy and then we had ordered chilly garlic fried rice and Singapore chicken and two soft drinks. For a person who loves spicy the Singapore chicken was not at all that spicy,though they had said it would be quite spicy, the chilly garlic rice was quite good. In brevity the food was good does justice to the price.

Sikkim House houses Blue Poppy, a tiny but crowded outlet serving Asian fares. While it's very popular among office goers, I wouldn't recommend taking time out to visit because it's just average in its category.

Their Pan Fried Pork Momos in Garlic Sauce are very good but one might find the sauce a bit sweet if they aren't used to it. Their Ema Dasi is a bit cheesy for my liking and I'm not sure how it's actually supposed to be.

All said and done, visit this place only if you are around this area.

The Blue Poppy on the first floor of Sikkim House, Camac Street Area, is to me an overhyped place by what I have personally witnessed. Leave the decor and the ambience, the place does not serve even tasty food.¬†
We were three dropping into the outlet when we ordered for Chicken Thai Soup, Chilly Chiekn Dry and Chicken Shatpa with the white rice bun (forgot what it's really called) ! The Thai soup was mechanical and was not upto the mark. The Chilli Chicken dry was disappointing, however the saviour was the Chicken Shapta. The bun accompanying it was soft and succulent too. Loved the taste and authenticity of it.¬†
Coming to the service, it was also not worth mentioning and the staffs were lackadaisical. Overall, not a worthy experience and they still have a lot to improve. All the best team !

I had wanted to come here for a really long time. We ordered a pan fried pork momo in hot garlic sauce, a dry chili pork, a mixed hakka noodle and a hot garlic chicken. The portions served were generous and worth the money spent. The momos were crispy and yet had lots of gravy. However their "hot garlic" sauce should be renamed as "sweet tangy" sauce as there was nothing remotely hot or garlicky about it. The dry chili pork lacked flavoring, but it was not a bad dish, I liked it. The fried rice was pretty good. The hot garlic chicken was once again neither hot, nor garlicky, but it definitely was well cooked and juicy. Hence, I felt that the food was over hyped but it's definitely worth a shot.

Blue Poppy is arguably the best Momo restaurant in Kolkata. But, do not stick to Momo and Thukpa alone. But, do not stick to just Momo and Thukpa alone. Try the other Tibetan specialities like Mentsetse or Phakthuk - not available elsewhere. The former is a flat noodle soup and the second is a handmade shell-shaped noodle. It is a great place for Pork lovers. The adventurous can try the Sikkimese Dalla Chilli pickle.

Blue Poppy has been in my radar for quiet a long time. Visited twice in their Sikkim House outlet off Middleton Street. The very celebrated Pork shapta failed to amaze as the pork pieces were extremely dry and tight, however the sauce in which it was made was good in taste. The pork momo, mixed noodles and chicken side dishes were just ordinary. Interior is nothing notable and the service was dismal. However, it's a pocket friendly joint with some signature Nepali and Bhutanese cuisine.

This is that one place in the city that you should definitely not miss. Though its known for the amazing momo's, I haven't tried them but instead I have tried the rice, Chilly Chicken and also the Singapore Chicken. Though I didn't quite like the latter, the simplest of dishes here seem great. Adding to that, it is very affordable. The service is not very great. However, the quantity they provide will definitely satisfy you. They could do a little more on the ambience. I always look forward to another visit to this place and this time surely for the momo's.

Good food at good pricing with good quantity. But the service is terrible.i feel they only like to serve northeastern people properly. We ordered two plates of momo as starters and fried rice and pork shaypta as main course.after around 20 minutes they gave us the main course. When we asked about the momo they seemed to have forgotten about it.fine , that's still okay but we're the customers they should've atleast apologised for the inconvenience. But no,instead their attitude was terrible and all they said was " ha dekhte hain " and after another 20 minutes we got our momo that also after constantly asking for it. They act like they are doing you a favour by serving but we're paying.we're not asking for free food. Their attitude is terrible , this "dont give a shit " attitude is just not acceptable.

This is my favourite food joint for authentic chinese and Tibetan delicacy. Situated right in the Middleton row in the first floor of Sikkim House, this place is a highly popular for its affordable yet lip-smaking taste, serving a wholesome quantity of food. 
I have been a regular visitor and this place never fails to cheer me up! 
Chicken shapta, chicken steam momo, chicken thukpa, and schezuan mixed fried rice... These are my favourite dishes but since I am a spicy food lover, I have a special weakness for this place's chicken shapta. 
In all, this place deserves a full 5 out of 5 rating, being absolutely a place for value for money!

This place is undoubtedly crowd's favorite. They make amazing pork Momos. I ordered Thukpa. It was good not extra ordinary though. But the Momos are actually nice. Price is reasonable. You can drop in if you are near maidan area. ‚ò∫

Blue Poppy never disappoints me in terms of taste. Visited this outlet for the 1st time, was a bit confused about the timings as Google showed closing time as 3:30 pm while in Zomato, it was 4 pm; but reach just in time and was not left to starve üòâ that afternoon. Remember to be in time as they close exactly at 3:30 pm and don't entertain an request for entry - DISCIPLINEü§ò!

Being said that their service is also very prompt and very cordial staffs.

Let's move over to food now:

‚Ä¢ Pan Fried Pork Momo with Hot Garlic Sauce: My all time favorite and a must try, check the üì∑, self explanatory!

‚Ä¢ Veg Garlic Hakka Chow: Tastes good ( I'm not a chow fan though) üì∑

‚Ä¢ Ginger Chicken (Gravy): A bit bland but I loved the very 'not so spicy' üå∂ taste üì∑

Overall the portions were sufficient and food was tasty!

Ambience was a bit disappointing as I felt the restaurant was poorly lit and needs more lights.

And here comes the snapshot of my experience:

Food: 3.5/5
Ambience: 2/5
Hospitality: 3/5
Cost: 3.5/5

The Blue Poppy is a no frills, unlicensed, low cost restaurant on the first floor of Sikkim House on Middleton Row. It‚Äôs famous for its Nepalese dishes, primarily its steamed and pan friend wontons or momos, and also for its pork and Chinese-Indian (Chindian) dishes, soups and noodles in particular. Service is efficient but far from friendly. The food is good but not nearly as good as some of the ratings and reviews suggest. Without wanting to sound insensitive, students, accustomed to ‚Äòroughing it‚Äô a little, will feel right at home here. Worth a visit.

Waste NOT. Want NOT.

The Blue Poppy at Middleton Road is and always will be my answer to "Where do we eat?"
The food is wholesome and the amount is generous just like the people who serve you there. Great ambience and the food no doubt stands true to the flavour of its origin. I personally love dipping kotheys into a bowl of hot Emma dasi, the combination is unbeatable.
I being a vegetarian find plenty of options and I don't mind ordering the same dishes over and over again.

Used to be a huge fan of this place. For their pan fried momo, pork shapta and Q Dasi. This is the place where I first experienced the different types of Thukpas. And all used to be great. But that was long time ago.

Now their Q Dasis are not smooth and the thukpas have deteriorated. Also they try to avoid taking orders of the Thukpa varieties, other than the plain one mostly. 

Service is also an issue here. They put off lights and start closing down when people are still eating. In all we have lost a once favourite place of ours.

Located on the first floor of sikkim house. Unless you have been here before or with someone who has been here, you might not find it. Given there is no mention of the name outside or anywhere. Inside, the staff wear 'blue poppy team' tees. They were courteous. On a regular weekday even, the footfall is pretty decent. U might have to wait a few minutes outside on the chairs.
Coming to the food, ordered chicken steamed and fried momos. They were delicious. The pork,chicken and prawn side dishes were really good. The quantity of mixed veg hakka noodles was adequate in comparison to the mixed veg fried rice. But all the dishes ordered were delicious.
Plus point- reasonable prices. did not burn a huge hole into our pockets.

Had a disappointing experience at the blue poppy, had heard a lot about it from friends and family but had a pretty disappointing experience the time I visited.

Ordered fried mushrooms, which tasted deplorable at the best, the steamed momos were nothing out of the ordinary as described by friends, maybe the hype and expectations killed it for me, no worries, next time I won't have any and hope to be surprised! :)

This place serves some of the best Pork dishes I have had in Kolkata..¬† Be it Pork momo's or Chilli Pork.. Full of flavour, and the momo's are juicy.. The red chilli sauce that goes along with the momo's is probably one of the spiciest in town.. AND I LOVE IT !!! But, apart from their Pork dishes, even the regular Chowmein, American Chopsuey and Hot n Sour Soup taste really good... Comfort food at its best !!!!

Had Pan Fried chicken momos, Fried chicken momos, Chicken Meifoon, Chicken Manchurian and chicken Fried Rice. All were very good specially the Momos. They make the best momos in town! Both quality and quantity is satisfying.  Quite Affordable.

Have wanted to try out this place for a long time now, and the alibi of Bhai Phota was perfect to get food from here. After gorging on the food, I am glad to say that my 100th review on Zomato is for Blue Poppy. The Chicken Steamed Momos were just awesome. Pepper Chicken and Chilli Chicken were great too. The Chow ( Hakka and Cantonese) were standard. But the show stopper of the day was their soup which goes by the name of Emma Da Se. A thick soup consisting of Molten Cheese and Chillies, this delectable, mouth watering item was unique in its own way. Can say that I have tried out many different types of soup at pretty renowned places, but this dish is way above all.....Be it the flavours, creativity, the aroma.....you name and this amazing item has it all. Simply hats off to the Chef for this item alone. Well, all foodie folks out there, you must make it a point to try out this dish. Service is good. Packaging of food is excellent too. Will be back here pretty soon for the other stuff and definitely 'The Soup'.

This place has a big reputation and it was a big let down.
1. Chicken momos were too sweet and way to much drenched in tomato sauce than it should be. Didn't feel like having a good momo although the fillings were good, sadly this good filings got wasted by the use of too much tomato sauce.
2. Chicken mehfun was okay but the chicken curry was horrible. Extra fried in the sides and salty.
3. The noodles which was covered with gravy felt like made with jelly made with way too much cornflower! :(
A big let down.

The Blue Poppy is always a delight. I visit this place with my friends often and love the pan fried momos in tomato garlic sauce the most. Also try the garlic fried rice and veg kothay momos for a delicious meal. Though I'd rate it high on taste, hygiene might not be one of the USPs for this place. Although the staff is almost friendly and they try their best, the overall cleanliness of the restaurant needs improvement.

As this is a budget eatery, I am not going to get into the 'complain about the ambience'. I'l be happy with whatever I get. hell, they have an AC :DHad ordered different flavoured fried rice. I am not happy with either the quantity and the quality. the amount of vegetables used is very minimum in the rice. The noodles was bad. For 120 rs, it looked and tasted like street side noodles. I have had better noodles at Denzong.Had ordered honey chicken, It was tasty, but chicken pieces a bit under cooked. The singapore chicken was tasty. But had only two pieces of capsicum in it. They depend highly on dry red chillies for the spicy flare in food. If too much red chillies gives you a bad stomach day the next morning, avoid this place.Behala parnashree has two budget chinese resturants called Haochi and chopstick. I'd rather stick with them from now.

This restaurant is located in Sikkim house and isn't that difficult to locate. Once u locate Sikkim house go up to the first floor of the building and you will find the restaurant..
I went there with a friend of mine for a quick grab and go bite, but the aroma of the food was such that we ended up ordering a proper lunch.
The restaurant is air conditioned and the staff is well behaved and helpful enough to gude you through the menu.
----------------
----------------
We order the following items from the menu:

Pan fried veg momo in hot garlic sauce: this is undoubtedly the best dish. It was hot, tangy as well as spicy. I cannot have enough of this dish. It playfully plays with your palate and teases it till you are bombed with the superb flavours in it. It really does pack quite a punch.

Cantonese style egg noodles: the noodle was refreshing, simple yet it packed just enough flavours ti not be bland... But we had this just after having the momo...so it seemed comparatively a bit nok spicy and non tangy.

Chili pork dry: it was spicy and quite nice except the fact that all the pieces of pork weren't uniformly cooked. Some were juicy and tender whereas others were a bit chewy.

Garlic pepper fish dry: it was good.. The fish was really fresh and there were right pieces of fish in the dish it was really value for money... But amount of garlic and diced bel pepper was a bit to much. The garlic onion and veel peppers could have been fried a bit longer... But it was a good dish.

Pork Shapta dry: it tasted amazing, but the pork was a little bit chewy.

Fried vegetable wanton: the veggies inside were soft and tasty... A little bit more masala inside Would have been nicer. The best thing about the wantons was their crispness.

Singapore fish : the fish was very fresh and tasty and the coating of corn flour on the outside of the fish was very light...It was almost transparent. I ordered both the dry and gravy variety of this dish, and neither disappointed me.
----------------
----------------

The ambience of the place is good and the place is value for money. But be careful of the fact that they close the restaurant by 3:30-4!! You won't get server if you are late. So be on time.
Do give this place a try... Because seldom i find places we the aroma of the food makes you hungry... And the plate full of momo was just delicious enough to try out this place once again.
Cheers!!

I ordered some Chinese recently from this outlet of The Blue Poppy and wasn't too pleased with the taste despite reading positive reviews about it. My lunch consisted of Hakka Noodles paired with Chilli Pork and I was left hugely disappointed by the latter's taste. The noodle, however, although nowhere near succulent, had an enjoyable flavor to help gorge on the pork.¬†
Can't comment on the ambiance since it was a Swiggy order, but definitely willing to try other offerings of this popular eatery.

The Blue Poppy is in Sikkim House, Middleton Street. Ordered the chicken momos and thukpa. The outer layer was thin, the filling was generous and tasted good too. However, the restaurant had a bad smell and looked too shabby. Pocket friendly.

The Blue Poppy is one of the best place in the town for momos. Located about 5mins walk from Maidan Metro. Their momos are very delicious. Be it Chicken pan fired or Pork momo they are just wonderful. I could never have enough of them. And after having a plate you will feel like ordering another.
The Chinese dishes are fine. Soups are good. And the place has a very simple decoration with good staffs.
Their prices are very affordable that too in place near Park Street area.

We also had pan fried momo which was EXCEPTIONALLY good & guys.. You must try it! The sad part is the place is not too big & hence can accommodate only a small crowd.

Was introduced to this place about 6 years back when I was very new to the city and was missing the taste of Chinese from my northeastern roots. The place was a complete delight  and continues to be. Reasonable prices, quality food, basic ambience but tidy ...and very well behaved staff.

This is Sikkim's gift to us calcuttans. Blue poppy has been around for many moons with an unwavering commitment to quality. The momos and thukpas are all right I guess but nothing beats the chilly pork and honey chicken. Now that you can get it delivered I am in seventh heaven.the place is really easy on the pocket and best when you need to feed a truckload of people.

The blue poppy was chosen as our destination for a birthday treat....we were totally drenched by the time we reached there..got our seats and were seated...there were 6 of us and one of our friend was on his way...since the staff were insisting that we place our order,we ordered two plates of pan fried chicken momos and a chicken mushroom soup....the momos were listed as one of the best items of blue poppy..so I had very high expectations from this dish....8 pieces of momos were served in each plate...stuffing was okay..what I did not like was the sauce.i could only find tomato sauce...the soup was better than the momos .. we kept our fingers crossed and hoped that the main course would be better...but alas..it was just not our day...we ordered chicken fried rice ,mixed noodles without pork...sweet and sour chicken ,garlic chicken in hot and sweet sauce,rum chicken. .well by the look itself all the 3 side dishes looked the same....sweet and sour chicken was better than the other two..my friends kind of hated it..noodles and rice was okay quantity wise...ambience was okay...but the waiters were quite rude..yeah they were..service was prompt..we went for a fag..they literally wanted us to clear the table indirectly ...even though no one was waiting outside...I am quite disappointed with  blue poppy...I had high expectations from this place and it was@ a complete let down for me..I have had better Chinese definitely and I'm definitely not coming back..cz I could not find anything that would drag me to this place again...

Even on a rainy day this place remains full. We went for lunch and had Chicken wonton soup, pan fried chicken momo with hot garlic sauce, mixed American chopsuey. The quantity is perfect for 2 persons. The food tasted awesome. The service was quick. The price pocket friendly. We are planning to visit soon.
........................................................................................
This was my third visit. This time we had chicken sweet corn soup. Soup required additional dose of salt, pepper, suace etc. Main course were chicken chilli garlic noodles, egg chicken fried rice, chicken in hot garlic sauce. Noodles tasted really good, spicy. Rice was ok. Quantity wise both were enough for 4 people. We were disappointed from the hot garlic chicken. This dish tasted good enough from the sweeter side. The gravy was hot, but the 6 chicken pieces were cold inside. Anyway we didn't complain. Service was good and price reasonable as usual.

Located just opposite to Middleton Chambers.. From Vardaan Market, walk towards Maidan Metro Station and this falls on your left at the Sikkim House. 
The look of the restaurant didn't impress, however the food did. 

Food: The best momos I've had in a long time. However, other chinese delicacies aren't that pleasing. But keeping in mind the price, I wouldn't want to complain. 
Ordered Steamed momos at first, which we loved. Mixed Fried rice, Garlic chicken next. 

Pocket friendly place. And the menu, tax inclusive which came upto Rs. 430 for us. Happy Dining!

This little restaurant is located inside the Sikkim House. Thanks to a friend I finally got to visit this place for a lunch last week. And man oh man what food! We ordered their Thukpa which is a Tibetan noodle soup, Singaporean chicken and simple veg fried rice. (My mouth is already watering again from mentioning these food items. I dunno about yours.) The Thukpa was the item I tried for the first time as my friend recommended it and it was delicious. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the soup was wow. The soup is supposed to be watery so no issues there. The veggies and chicken were fresh and tasty to the core. Now the Singaporean chicken is highly recommended. It's a bit spicy yes but if you like it hot this is a must-have too. The chicken balls were bigger than you find in your average shops. Delicious!!! The chicken was juicy and spicy and the gravy was excellent too. The Veg fried rice was simple and wholesome. The simplicity if the fried rice helped the Singaporean chicken to shine and spark in my palate. However the quantity of the rice was a bit less for two adults. But if you're looking for light lunch what we were served was close to perfect! I would definitely go there again with my other friends. (I'm thinking about the food and my mouth won't stop watering.)
P.S Sorry I don't have pictures of the Singaporean chicken about and veg fried rice. The awesomeness lies in the food and not in the looks. Inner beauty?

The ideal college student lunch hub, Blue Poppy is famous for its momos. The chicken kothay momos are the perfect blend of steamed and fried. For the more adventurous there's the pan fried momos in garlic sauce. What's great is even when home delivered, the food remains hot and as delicious. There isn't a lot of seating and the place is very popular around lunch time so make sure you get there early (although service is super fast). The best part - you can gorge on the best momos in town without burning a hole in your pocket

If momos are your kinda thing, this place should surely not be given a miss.
Ambience wise, a pretty shady joint that it looks, ends up hosting people from all walks of life- and that's probably because the love for food brings them all together. 
Their menu spread is like holding a holy guidebook for the carnivores. But it also has lots to offer to the vegetarian lot. 
What I completely swear by here is their vegetarian steam momos, that you could dip in their bad-ass spicy momo dip that's unlike any other. Their Tomyum soup is also a perfect thing to begin with if you're into good spice. 
You'll be pleasantly surprised with their dish quantities which could fill at least 4 instead of 2, when it comes it their vegetarian fried rice and vegetable manchurian.  
Another thing that I recommend is the Q-Dasi, a Bhutanese dish that's particularly different and the lime cola. 
One piece of advice: Always check your momo filling before you decide to pop it, simply cause there have been instances, wherein my friend was served the chicken momo instead of the vegetarian one. 
Overall, I thoroughly recommend it!
Wish they did something about the interiors as well.

U will feel bored inside. The staff are late in taking orders and sometimes they even forget. Plz dont go here. Not worth your hard earned money.

Located on the first floor of the Sikkim House, The Blue Poppy seemed to be a crowd favorite. Even without any noticeable branding outside, it attracted a consistent flow of office-goers and college students.The reason for its fan following was easy to decipher, it served good food at a reasonable rate. We ordered Thai chicken soup, pork shapta, fried chicken momo, mixed fried rice, pork meifoon, pepper fish, and cold drinks and it all came down to 1170 with taxes. The food was good enough to satiate my Chinese craving. The waiters however, need to be slightly more attentive. One of them inadvertently ignored us when we called him to our table and then brought in one cold drink instead of the ordered three. Even with that, this place has an undeniable charm and I would love to go back.

Have tried the steamed mono
Pan fried mono
Hakka chowmin
Fried rice
Chicken hot garlic 
Chicken with vegetables 
Food tastes awsome 
Ambiance is plain 
It's an non-ac restaurant 
But quantity is less the above food fell short for three people as the rice and noodle quantity was too little.
PS: the first time I went there was shejwan chicken and it surprised me it wasn't red in colour rather it was a pan fried with dried red chilly......it wasn't in the menu when I visited recently....
That shejwan is better than any other I ever had .

If you love momos and you are in Kolkata, then u must visit Blue Poppy. I can tell you their momos are the BEST not only in Kolkata but certainly best in India. It's difficult to get a place here during lunch hours and evening time till dinner, so would suggest u book a table and then visit. I have been visiting them for last 8 years atleast and have never been disappointed. I must say they have some excellent pork preparations along with thalis and their Chinese food. Off late they have opened multiple branches.

I never miss out an opportunity visiting them even today while I am in kolkata.They have been awarded best restaurant awards many times by Times Food..Cheers to Blue Poppy team!!!. Keep it coming

SO the other day I went to this¬† beautifully decorated place in Russell Street which brought in memories of my last trip to Sikkim particularly Gangtok where the small restaurants are exactly decorated the way it is here. Anyways coming back to the food,¬† in one word it was fantastic. My friend suggested me this place first and I was reluctant to visit but then I changed my mind and tried it out. The fried rice in particular and add to that the schezwan sauce is a deadly combo. We tried out Singaporean Chicken and Chicken hot garlic about which I would like to add that the Singaporean Chicken was something worth trying. For starters we took the trademark dish, The Pan Fried Momo which is a must for everyone whenever they visit the place. Overall ambience-wise, food-wise a perfect place to try out authentic Chinese at a reasonable price.

This is the go-to place for all you momo lovers. They serve absolutely authentic momos. However, you will mostly have to wait in a long queue since this one is quite popular amongst the college goers . I personally love their Kothay- these ones are momos fried at the base unlike the fried momos which are deep fried. Their Pork dishes are good..portions are sumptuous. Do try out the Nepali thali!

After a tiresome day,my friends and I ran towards this restora like hungry foxes. It was a rainy noon and obviously ¬†the lunch time.Undoubtedly, Reading reviews and watching pics of the restora attracted us to it.
But above all,the 'restora is in sikim house' it gave us the hope of having some authentic dishes from hillside. when we entered the joint,that was 75% filled,we managed to have a table somehow. very clean and simple decor inn-side. Ac was active. chinese lantern hanging from ceiling made a fuzzy environment. Our order was simple- GARLIC HAKKA NOODLES,HAKKA MUSHROOM NOODLES,LEMON CHICKEN AND PORK MANCHURIAN. we also order Green Apple soda and Blue Lagoon Soda. The dishes came,PORK ¬†was toooooo much. immediately i announced it as the 2nd best pork place of kolkata. lemon chicken wasnt upto par,neither the noodles. if I have to come back here,i will come for pork without doubt.

One of the best place for authentic Tibetan dishes in the city. Their momos with thin crust and excellent stuffings are delicious be it steamed or pan fried. CHILLI PORK is superb. Different types of soup and thukpa are also authentic.
Staffs are helpful and quick in service though appearance is not smart.
This place is difficult to locate. Though it is in the 1st floor of Sikkim house near to maidan metro, jebandeep gate, there is no banner or direction. Even in the entrance of it, no logo or banner is there. For first time goers it is better to take help from the locals.
Price: value for money considering both quality and quantity.

Located in Sikkim House, this is at a walking distance from the Maidan metro station and the Jeevandeep building. This is where I tasted pork kothay momos and absolutely loved it. We had regular Chinese food over here and it really tasted good. Would like to re-visit and try out the Tibetan and Bhutanese dishes they offer. And it is really so pocket-friendly (brings a huge grin on my face!).

Phaley was good but the crust was little thick. I would recommend to visit this place. Good behavior along with a good service. 
Will love to visit again. 
Only thing is this place is closed for just 1 hour I.e., 4pm-5pm.

Have been really wanting to go to this place for a very very long time. Had the steamed momos and the veg chilli garlic noodles. Absolutely loved each and every bite of the food. The momos were the correct size and just yum. I was a little put off to see the rate which was 110 per plate. But then when the dish came, there were 8 pieces of momos which made it absolutely worth the price. (Most places give 4/5 PCs at the same rate)
The noodles too, were delicious. So a pocket friendly place for great food.

I think one of the best chinese in kolkata. Located on the first floor of skkim house this little joint is always full of people. There was a small queue and it took barely 10 minutes for us to be seated. 
The restaurant though small is very clean amd the tables are placed with sufficient distance from each other for enough seating room.
Comming to the food, orderd the pan fried chicken momo in hot garlic sauce, chilly garlic mixed chowmin, cantonese mixed chowmin and chilly pork. All the dishes were awesome espicially the momo and pork.
The staffs are courteous and fast .......
Overall a place to have some good chinese food at very decent price.

With long pending reviews to write about,it s best to start with the sweeter side of memories. I have visited this place more than once and to mention, their consistency is a full on plus point. 
The location is a bit tough to figure out for unacquainted chaps¬† and hence the regular visitors of the joint includes loyal customers including college and office goers from the local thoroughfare. So, if you are visiting the place anytime during the lunch hours and even till evening, you should be prepared for at least a 10-15mins wait. 
Coming to the food, these people serve simple chinese food with good care, such that even the basic staple becomes a palatable delight. Among the soups, I had the chicken wanton soup and chicken thai soup, both of which were good to taste with fine balance of ingredients. The thai soup is not much spicy and the wantons were really well made. Veg fried rice,chicken fried rice and chicken hakka noodles were tasty to say the least. Chilli chicken, singapore chicken,pepper chicken and lemon chicken were the main course poultry items I had till date. Among then pepper chicken and lemon chicken are the better ones as per my view. Specially lemon chicken had the perfect balance of the sweet and tangy flavor which is most often tripped on one or the other side at many places in town. Overall, the guys here are on their toes always, with swift service, prompt help and good food to their tow. The other very good thing for this place is their prices which have always been on the lower side and never burns a hole in the pocket.
Re-visit is a sure choice for this place. #HappyEating

Heard a lot about this place and went to see what the hype was all about. Well it did not disappoint me. 

Fried Chicken Momo was not as good as I expected. But it was not bad.
Chicken Sweet Corn Soup was tasty. 
Chicken Fried Rice tasted very nice.
Chicken Hakka Noodles was wholesome as well. 
The dish I did not like was Pepper Chicken. It was bland I felt. Maybe Schezwan would have been a better choice. 

The place itself is difficult to locate for a first timer. There is no mention of 'The Blue Poppy' anywhere except the Menu Card and the t-shirts of the staff. You have to go inside Sikkim House and travel upstairs to reach the restaurant. 

Nevertheless I would recommend this to fellow food lovers.

It is an art making momos.They cannot be overstuffed with veggies.. so heavy that you think twice before you pick the next one.Blue Poppy is an instituion when ut comes to momos.This small little place above Sikkim House is a hidden gem, serving those light fluffy momos nice and spicy with the fiery chilli sauce. You wont be the only table ordering it umpteen number of times.The pan fired momos are the best in Kolkata. The other must tries are veg thukpa, soupy noodly bowl of deliciousness, veg manchurian, hakka noodles, garlic noodles. They are just superbly made.
Decently priced is just the icing on the cake.
You gotta eat here.

Blue Poppy or commonly known as Sikkim House is one of the few places in Kolkata which serve good Chinese Food. Have been here quite a number of times and they haven't disappointed even once. The last time I went with friends, we ordered Veg Steamed Momos, Veg Hakka Chow and Spicy Mixed Veg in Hot Garlic Sauce. The momos were decent enough, nothing very extraordinary. However, the main course dishes were beyond excellence! The way they make their noodles is unbeatable and surely the best I have ever had. The curry was properly cooked and quite delicious with the perfect balance of sweet and spice! All in all a satisfying experience! Recommended!

Vegetarian can avoid this place.Blue Poppy/Sikkim House specialize in momos/hakka noddles and other north-eastern food..The place is actually good for Non Vegetarians/North Eastern Indians which is very much apparent from the menu.Well there is hype that Momos are very good here.I didn't like that much.They don't even food provide soup with Veg Momos.Apart from this Veg Indian Thali was not up to the mark.Rice was of inferior quality.In nutshell I didn't find anything interesting in this much hyped place.Maybe they have lowered the quality recently.Inside sitting was average.

Located in the Sikkim house this joint offers the authentic taste of nepali and Sikkimese food. We have ordered for Nepali Thali along with the momos and pahley. Thali was too authentic so it didnot liked by my taste buds. But full marks to momos and pahley. Overall nice experience

I was lured to this place by the hype of the momos they serve.

It is located conveniently. From Miadan Metro Station, take Middleton Street, and keep walking straight to find Sikkim House. After entering through the front gate, walk straight, enter a building, go to its first floor to find this restaurant.

It was a winter afternoon, and we had to enlist our name to get a table. It took more than 30 minutes to get one. Once we entered we found it to be a simple restaurant decorated with Chinese lanterns and a few other articles. We ordered the following:

1. Pan Fried Chicken Momo: It was extremely delectable. Big pieces of momos glazed with a spicy sauce, with good amounts of fillings. I'd rate it 4.5/5.

2. Chicken Hakka Noodles: It was fine. For 2 people, the quantity is fine, and it had generous amounts of chicken pieces, fried eggs, and veggies. However, it was quite evident from the smell and taste, that it was made in a not-so-good oil. 3.5/5.

3. Szechuan Chicken: I'm not sure if this was mentioned in the menu, but they said they'd prepare it in szechuan sauce. But what we got wasn't anywhere near to the Szechuan Chicken we know of.  It was a very light and mild gravy. 3/5

CONCLUSION: It is a simple restaurant serving palatable Chinese items in generous portions at reasonable prices. It has a few hits and misses here and there, but will continue to remain popular because the foods are really good value for money. Do try their Pan Fried Momos.

Another food memory for me and my friends, The Blue Poppy is undoubtedly the instant go to place to satisfy our Momo cravings. Growing up eating Tibetan food, I can pretty much say their Momos are good if not the best in Kolkata. The total letdown although was the Thukpa and Pan Fried Pork Momo in Hot Garlic Sauce. Didn't exceptionally liked it. The broth of the Thukpa was bland and the pan fried momo had an overdose of garlic and soy sauce. But loved the Nepali Thali which was pretty decent for the price. The owner was kind enough to give me and my friends a second helping of Kinema (fermented soya beans) which we gorged on it as it reminded us of back home. Wanted to try the Shaphaley but never got the chance to taste it since it has to be ordered a day before. If you have ever tasted Ema Datshi in Bhutan or have had Bhutanese friends cook for you the authentic way you'll find that the Bhutanese National Dish, "Ema Datshi" served in the restaurant is a mediocre. But all in all will keep on visiting this place if not for other things but for the Momos no doubt.

I have heard a lot about this place in the past. One fine afternoon, we decided to pay a visit. It is located inside the Sikkim House. Usually remains crowded at peak hours for its fame and name. The decor is soothing. The value for money is good. They offer mouth watering dishes. The quantity of food served has decreased over the years. The service is a bit slow. Never mind, we had a pleasant afternoon. Errr, thumbs up.

I don't know about the Tibetan menu but I can assure you that Blue Poppy is the worst restaurant in Kolkata when you are ordering Chinese food. Through Swiggy we ordered mixed (pork prawn chicken) fried rice, mixed gravy chow and hot garlic chicken.
The fried rice was small in quantity with no trace of pork or chicken though it is supposed to be 'mixed'.
The mixed gravy chow similarly didn't have any pork etc and on top of that the whole thing was like jelly pudding for too much cornflour.
The uniquely worst item was hot garlic chicken which they don't know how to cook. In a small container there were six marble sized chicken in a pool of low brand tomato sauce. It tasted so bad that we couldn't finish those marbles and had to throw it away! Waste of money and a big dissatisfied meal.

A visit to " The Blue Poppy" was long due. It was recommended by some of my friends & I was so happy to finally tick it off the wishlist.¬†
It was a Sunday afternoon & about 30% tables were occupied. However, within an hour the restaurant was full.

¬†Interior is basic & simple.¬†

We ordered steamed chicken momos, chilli fish & a chicken item.¬†
Honestly, I was utterly disappointed.¬†
Also, my friends who had previously been to this place were shocked to find the fallen standards. ¬†

All the items tasted bland. The fried items were soggy and smelt of re-used oil. I don't know whether it was an exceptional incidence or a regular affair.¬†
I really wish the Chefs pay more attention to their culinary skills so that the diners get some quality food.

This place was suggested to me by a friend when I was craving for some comfort food. And bang on, it serves the purpose. Me and my colleagues went there during our lunch hour in office and were ravishingly hungry. We were attended to as soon as we entered and also special mention to the staff who took the pains to explain almost every dish on the menu when we asked what it was. Quickly ordered a veg thali, chicken thali and a bowl of hot flat noodle soup (I neither remember nor can pronounce the names in their menu). Service was quick but there were a few hits and misses in the components overall. Ambiance adds to the theme and is a welcoming change from the other restaurants nearby. Overall good value for money. Definitely worth a visit.

Lip smacking food at lowest possible price. Ambiance is cool. Don't expect any kind of luxury in infrastructure because it has the feel of a canteen but the food they serve is undoubtedly the best in Calcutta and even better than most of the high priced food joints. The pork preparations are marvelous. Even the chicken items are too good in taste. Worth coming back umpteen times to satisfy your lust for delicious Chinese food.

Who doesn't love momos and chowmein.!! And while you are professionals working around Russell street, its bound to be visited once a while. Sadly me staying in Kolkata, I  shamefully admit it was my first visit. Ordered chilli sauce momo n schezwan chowmein. And both had a really good quality, cooked perfectly with right amount of spice. Must say it has become my go to place during office hours of possible. ;) So I recommend trying all dishes. Service was also good with really stress free ambience. Must go. !!

This restaurant is basically a part of the Sikkim house.
I have been there twice.
Try their momos. Doesn't come with a soup bowl, but they present it with a chilli sauce. Trust me, it's the most amazing sauce I have ever tasted. Damn spicy and hot.
We ordered the chicken Chinese chop suey and the American chop suey.
The Chinese one came with white sauce. I really loved it. Great if you're dieting.
The American one comes with an egg poach on top. Has fried crispy noodles and tastes sweet.
I really loved their food and the prices are pretty cheap.

The place is not fancy but is clean and has quick service.

Must haves: Awesome Chilli pork dry, Perfectly made Momos ( in their original flavours- steamed, fried or pan fried) , a bowl of steaming thukpa, Cantonese noodles and Chicken Shapta. Shapta is a stir fry which is hot and spicy but a perfect combination with a mild tasting rice or noodles. While good chinese is readily available, good Tibetan is tough to come by, so go for it!

As I dug into a hearty plate of  steamed pork momos and another bowl of Ema Dasi - I knew instantly why this place is rated as the best Tibetan food joint in town. 

It is unlikely that you are going to get momos with such silky thin skin anywhere else in town. The stuffing is also pretty good, and when eaten with the fiery sauce kept at the table (not the ketchup version some places serve), it is a deadly combination and one that is capable of making water run out of nose.

So right when the heat got too much, I decided to slurp from the bowl some Ema Dasi. Ema Dasi is a wonderful cheese + chilli thick-textured soup, usually had as a side dish with bhutanese cuisine, but my friend

Located in Middleton Row, can be easily found. They have a variety of chinese, tibetian dishes, which tastes really good and is simply so pocket friendly!
The soups are loaded with chicken, and chicken pan fried momo in garlic sauce is an absolute treat!
It will hardly cost even 500 for two!

Did not visit this outlet physically, but got food delivered to a friends place from this restaurant. I had heard its a good restaurant serving beautiful pan Asian food. So, i ordered burnt ginger rice,
Garlic chicken fried rice, honey chicken and chicken shyafley. The quantity of the rice was decent, chicken pieces in honey chicken were average but coating was too hard to chew. Both the rice had its unique taste of burnt ginger and garlic-y. The chicken shyafley was show stealer with its spicy and perfect taste. Quantity was so much that both of us could not finish.
Looking forward to visit this outlet someday soon!

Okay so visited the restaurant today, after trying the food here im cutting down my review rate to 3.0, the reason are mentioned as below.
We ordered pan fried momo in hot garlic sauce, chicken meinfoon, veg cantonese noodles, chicken shyapta.
Momo in hot garlic sauce tasted like momo in hot tomato sauce, it was too sweet. Secondly, Cantonese noodles was prepared with cheap quality cornflour hence the glutens formed jelly instead of a nice gravy, also the vegetables added a raw smell to the noodles. The shyapta had burnt pieces of hard chicken.
Need to say more? Everything had a hint of sweetness to the food. For some weird reason! I think you should serve proper food to your every customer, if there has been any discrimination from your side today which we are unaware of! 
Did not expect such bad quality food. Plus everyone was hurrying to shut the place down as it was half an hour left to 4.( closing time of this place till 5)

The blue poppy in Middleton Row boasts of two things.... one, great location and two, and more importantly, great food!!! I took my friend to The Blue Poppy... shelled within the Sikkim House the decor is just like the one in salt lake, simple and traditional. My friend from the hills liked the steamed and pan fried chicken momos though he said the filling should be more fresh, but then he is used to home grown poultry and veggies.... to me it tasted like umami on a plate.... I ordered my favourite, the mixed thukpa!!!! Warm, comforting, and delicious. And stuffed with hand made noodles, veggies, chicken, prawns and pork.... absolutely mind blowing.... 
Statutory warning: they take the last order for lunch at 3:30.... so make sure you make your way to the place before that!!!!

Visited this place on 4th June 2016. Firstly the service is very poor. I had to ask the service people to serve us water. They gave 2 bottles of normal water. Then I had ask them to provide us glasses. Poor pathetic service. Biggest drawback. Pan fried momo was fried and dipped in tomato sauce as commented earlier by another person. Noodles were tasty but I think they use tomato sauce for every preparation. The name should have been red poppy instead of blue poppy. Food was very spicy and not at all recommended for children. We ordered food which was served later we found that the quantity was not sufficient as compared to other Chinese restaurants. That's why the rates are low. Later we ordered meifoon which never came and we had to wait for more than 20 mins resulting in cancellation of the order. A big disappointment.

Went to this place on 31st of december 2015.
People say the food is very good and its cheap.
But its not that actually.
Each plate of momo s costed more than 100.
I ordered a pan fried momo and it was just fried momos dipped in tomato sauce. Atleast it tasted like that.
Moreover they made us wait for a long time.
Negative marks for that one.
The quantity of fried rice is low.
I kinda liked the chilly pork.. but he dint.
So this place tanked for us.

If you are crazy for Tibetan food, Blue poppy should be your perfect destination for a gastronomic delight. Great food at a very reasonable price is the main attraction

As it is situated in the 1st floor of Sikkim house Middleton street,with no visibility from outside everyone in the city might not be aware of its existence. But  you visit once and you will surely be tempted for multiple visits. During peak lunch hours the place is crowded and its difficult to get a table. Several people sitting outside in the waiting area in front of the door can be seen.

I have tasted steamed as well fried momos, Thukpa and Phaley. The momos have rich stuffing. The sauce is fiery and it will bring tears to your eyes. One plate momo  can be shared by two and so is Thukpa. They will divide Thukpa into two bowls if asked for. All the items are mouth watering. I am yet to taste the Chinese items. 
I have found the service a bit slow most of the times. They will not even give you drinking water unless asked. Nothing much is there to mention about the ambience. Simple tidy interiors is just comfortable enough to relish the food.

My rating for this outlet swoops down to a 2.0 from a 4.0 only because of one complain that I have. The servers close down the outlet before the specified time and blatantly refuse to entertain customers. This has not happened with me once or twice, but on three occasions! Twice in the evening, at 3:50pm and 3:53pm; and once at 9:24pm. They refuse to even pack the food. Very disappointed with this certain issue. Please look into it.

The Blue Poppy has been catering to our Chinese food cravings ever since we were in college and had lighter pockets. This place holds the accolade for making our adventurous lots make their first acquaintance with pork with their inexpensive spicy tasty pork shapta. We learnt what meyfoon was and how to hold chopsticks here! 
Years have gone by and we friends still pay visits to relive old times. <3 the filling thukpa, the mixed friend rice and of course the park shapta. Momos aren't too nice but.

At last could visit this much awaited foot joint in Sikkim house,russel street,just in the premises of my office,ing VYSYA bank,t tried to visit several times as it was just nearby but destiny had to wait,could visit it after failed attempts 6 times,due to its location it always remains crowded and we have to stand with the ticket number to get ourselves a seat,nevertheless waiting 10-15 min is worth the wait as the food you get in there is awesome,tukpas are the best in the world,momos are reasonable good but not as better as their thukpas,pan fried variety is very tasty and spicy,other dishes taste good but you can get it better in other Chinese restaurants,apart from the Tibetan food,the Chinese variety is just worth a mention.You have to finish the food as fast as you can as others wait for their turn to get a seat.

This restaurant is famous for momos, yes. But seeing the pork menus I couldn't resist myself. Had ordered Chilli Pork and  Pork Chowchow Rice. The quantity is okay for two people and the cost is pocket friendly. The taste of the food is perfect and you get to enjoy a variety preparations of pork there. One of the better restaurants in the Park Street area. Always a good option to visit there with friends. Also, not forgetting to try the momos on my next visit there.

It was the day when KKR was to play against GL in IPL. We three friends were supposed to go to Eden Gardens so we decided to do a late lunch before going for the match. I searched zomato and came across this place and decided to go for it. It took us sometime to find this place as it does not have any signboard. You just need to ask directions for Sikkim house. It is a very small restaurant maybe with a sitting capacity of 30. Very homely decor which makes you feel good on entering. We ordered chicken sweet corn soup as starters. Its was really good with good amount of chicken and egg. Then for main course we went for mixed Friedrice and mixed meifoon. Both the dishes tasted really good. The rice was well cooked and the meifoon was also soft and really tasty. But only problem I found is with the pork pieces. They were undercooked and hard. For side dishes we ordered hot garlic chicken and chicken shapta. Special mention was the shapta. It was amazing but really spicy. It is a must have if you happen to visit this place. The hot garlic chicken was moderately spicy and was good too. But for me chicken shapta was highlight of the meal. The food was very cheap. It costed us only about 1000 rupees for 3.The service was quite good and the waiters were very polite. It is an authentic Chinese and Tibetian restaurant. My taste buds were greatly satisfied and would definitely visit again.

Located in Little Russell Street, have been here many times with friends and colleagues. It's inside the Sikkim House. Very simple place. They serve very nice momos, Chilli garlic noodles and crispy Chilli babycorn. Pocket friendly place for a good meal.

If you want good food and do not want your pocket to go lighter, this is the best place to be. Many of my friends had highly praised this place so one summer afternoon there I was. Do not go by the ambience because that is definitely deceiving. I had pork momo (haven't had such delicious momos in a looooong time, in fact it was so good that I even ordered a second plate) chilli pork and gravy noodles. I loved the food and would definitely visit it again.

After hearing so many positive reviews about this place from fellow foodies in zomato I decided to drop in at this place for late lunch with my friend.It's near maidan metro but very tricky to find.It's located in the first floor of sikkim house but there was no visible board in display for this restaurant.The place was almost full except a table for 2 in the corner.We were asked to sit there by the staffs.Their warm hospitality reminded me of sikkim a lot.They were typical friendly,nice and caring people from hills. :)

But the sad part is that I wasn't completely satisfied with food here.I had expected a lot better from this place.
We ordered their much popular pork steamed momos for the starter along with crispy chilli babycorn.

Pork steamed momos-They were good.Coating was not too thick and filling was adequate and tasted good on its own.But to be honest I find other outlets making better(juicier and succulent) steamed momo(Hamro momo,Momo I am,Denzong kitchen).But what I loved about it is the momo sauce.It was very very hot..just the way it is supposed to be.I warn that its not at all for the faint hearted.I loved it absolutely.It was authentic.Exactly like the sauces I had at siliguri,darjeeling and sikkim.

Crispy chilli babycorn-It was very good.It was crunchy..tossed in an amazing sauce which gives sweet sensation to your tongue first and later the hit of spice kicks in.It was the best part of the meal today.

For the mains we ordered Mixed Cantonese Chow(it had egg,pork and shrimps) and chilli pork dry.

Mixed Cantonese Chow-Portion was quite big.It was very hearty kind of meal.The shrimp and pork pieces were well cooked.Gravy was good but a bit on the blander side.A bit more seasoning would've lifted up this dish.

Dry chilli pork-This was a complete disaster.I didn't expect that the blue poppy will go wrong with this dish.Pork was way too overcooked..resulting it to be hard,rubbery.We couldn't complete this dish because towards the end it became worse.

I will still comeback here for light evening snack just to taste few more tibetan delicacies from this place but I doubt whether I'll try the main course here again.

A small outlet in Sikkim house on Middleton row. Very close to maidan metro. Visit this place only if you are a momo lover. They serve by far the best chicken momos in the city. The filling inside is well made and they are consistent with their quality. The virgin mojito is nowhere close to the mojito and rest of d food is average. One can go here to hang out with friends and have a light meal anytime. For momos this is d best !!!

I loved this place, though the friend I was with didn't quite like the idea of plastic glasses for drinking water! The place is small and at a comfortable distance from Maidan metro.
- Coming to their food, they "look" like they are specialised in Chinese and boy they are good. This outlet is operated solely operated by Sikkimese and are dong pretty well, if you are expecting to get back Rs 5 change from your bill, sorry you get a Happydent instead!! :-p
- Quality and taste is above average but quantity is really half of what you would expect from a "full plate"
- Pricing is pocket friendly so you can always have that extra friend tag along
- Final verdict, try it, I believe its pretty worth it for the price

This just popped up on my feed and I was surprised to see that I have never reviewed it. It was my favourite haunt a student on limited budget. Out of curiosity, I checked their menu and again, I'm shocked to see nearly no price hike. Next time I'm in Kolkata, I'll definitely pay a visit and slurp up a bowl of thukpa again!

The Chinese food here is pretty good but I judge everyone who comes here just to eat Chinese food. My earnest request to them is to try out their delicious Nepali and Bhutanese food. The pot stickers are better than any momo you have eaten, you have to trust me on this one. The shyaphale is a bit oily but if two are sharing, you can eat it without feeling queasy. The ema dasi is hot and I just love it. The thukpas are made of thick, I suspect handmade, noodles which taste so much better than those processed ones. But do eat up quick or they become fat and sticky! The pork curries are spicy and go well with thukpas.

Above all, a big thanks to Blue Poppy for introducing me to a less celebrated cuisine of my neighbouring contries.

Its a nice place...though litte bit tricky to find as its in d frst floor of Sikkim House...We ordered 1 plate chicken steamed momo,1 plate chicken pan fried momo,1 tom yum soup... 1 plate chicken fried rice,1 singapore chicken... 
The steamed momos were small in size... and the red chutney dat accompanied the momo was could-make-u-cry spicy... beware of that...
I personally loved thepan fried momo... correct amount spicy, perfectly juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside fried in awesome sauce..
I couldnot have the soup, soup isnot recommended here,as the soups d8dnot have any particular taste of its own...
But the fried rice was awesome...Yu should not miss the fried rice of this place...non oily and great taste... andthe singapore chicken was also different...a good different

One of the best places to hog on Tibetan and Chinese cuisine without hurting the pocket ! I have been coming here since college days and have never been disappointed with the quality of food and service.¬†

Their signature dishes include Steamed and pan fried momos, chili pork, Thukpas and Shaptas.¬†
They also prepare decent chinese items like noodles and fried rice but people generally come here for a quick snack rather than a full fledged meal.¬†
My favourite has to be the pan fried chicken momo. Its simply delicious.¬†

Cost for two should be around Rs500

Visited this bustling joint with my friends after long hours at college. It was lunch time, the place was completely packed with hungry people like us and we had to wait for some time to get a table for 6. And boy! The food! The delicious food was absolutely worth the wait. We ordered pork thukpa,  chicken thukpa, garlic pepper rice, chicken hakka noodles, chilli pork and rum chicken. The thukpa was extremely filling with adequate quantities of chicken and noodles in it. The chilli pork was well cooked and the rum chicken was an absolute delight. Price was a bit high but the food is worth it. Will be visiting this place again!

When i was introduced to this place the place was a lot cheaper. And were far less crowded. Now its becoming popular and you have to literally fight to get a seat. But once u get in the feeling is very homely. The pork momos with hot garlic sauce triggers your taste buds in the most fascinating manner.
             The meifoon will completely blow your mind and so does the chilli pork dry. The garlic pork is also very saliva extracting. And there are enough chicken dishes if you are not fond of the pig's meat. Though i personally never had a lot of them. Its basically a pork fest there for me. But as there is no liqour at your disposal you may find it less liberating. But the food will pacify u in all the right ways.
         Overall the experience will be good. Though a faster service and a more decorated interiors would have added to its tally.

Honestly, A bit overrated I must say in terms of food quality. It's plain and simple, nothing exciting about it, and to top that off, almost everyday there are queues forming outside and it takes a lot of time to enter. Staffs are so so, not too friendly, mostly verging on the irritating kind. The only thing good is that the quantity they serve, but the quality is not up to par. Honestly you can get a lot of good restaurants in that area if you're looking for food chinese food

The blue poppy is the sort of restaurant that people would appreciate with a medium budget. Specially good for students and first times. It is a bit difficult too locate and is not the most eye pleasing ambience. However the food is amazing special fried momos/dumplings. People abroad visiting Kolkata must try the momos from here. There are lot of variations on other dishes although it's difficult to be incisive between almost similar dishes. It has a more rustic feel even though it is in the middle of the city.

The quality of food has deteriorated over time especially when it comes to pork dishes. They give a lot of fat pieces‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ not only in the side dishes but in the main dishes as well. Again when it comes to the chicken dishes they only give six pieces @ 150-170 while other restaurants serve you at least 8. But their kotheys are really brilliant‚Ä¶. one of the finest I ever had. The ambience is pretty decent & they don‚Äôt charge any VAT or service tax.

Love all the pork dishes. Tried out Tibetan cuisine for the first time here and i must say, it was a mouth watering experience. Chicken/pork shapta is what you should go for if you like some spice in your life. The staff was courteous, ambience was relaxing, and food was delicious. So nothing to disappoint. We have never had to wait. But try to avoid the rush around 1- 2 pm.

The Blue Poppy is present at the Sikkim House, but you won't know it's there because there isn't any signboard or anything. You just have to be aware of it. 
The steamed momos here may be priced a little high, but they taste authentic and great. The schezwan pan fried momos have a delicious sauce, and the fried wantons are crispy goodness too. Great place for momos, and affordable, considering the locality.

Pork hakka chow paired with either Singapore chicken or Garlic fish is another great combination to try out.

Thanks to a friend, I came to know about this place. Sikkim House is a small restaurant which can be a bit difficult to spot. But when you actually enter, you see lots of people sitting and eating there! I went there with two friends to eat some momos as my friend said it's pretty good. So we'll have two chicken steam momos and one chicken pot stickers. Apart from that we ordered Green Apple Soda and a Virgin Mojito.

Drinks

Green Apple Soda - A nice refreshing drink to beat the heat. The drink had a nice sweet and sour taste which was quite pleasant. Though I don't like the pulpy feeling in my mouth but otherwise it was a good start.

VirginA,so,so,a Mojito - This was a very nice drink! I absolutely loved it! The drink tasted really really amazing! Though both the drinks looked strikingly similar, the tastes were quite distinct but great nonetheless.

Chicken Steam Momos - Really delicious momos. Loved the taste and the sauce here is VERY VERY HOT. It will literally put your mouth on fire! I quite liked it. The momos were a tad bit dry but the taste made up for it!!

Chicken Pot Stickers - These were quite tasty too. They were served quite hot which fired up my mouth even more but I quite enjoyed it!

The prices here are quite cheap and they include all taxes. It's a nice place to come to when you are looking for a nice meal at a low budget!

To start with, I came here with my group on a weekday..it was more or less occupied...Well, this place is spacious with sitting arrangements for about 50 people... Although not much decorated.. With courteous staffs around we placed our order.
‚ô£ For starters :
‚Ä¢ Pan fried pork mono in hot garlic sauce
‚Ä¢ Chicken mushroom soup
Momo was really appetizing with an awesome tangy sauce...which stipulated us to lick our fingers!
Soup was ordinary.
‚ô£ For main course :
‚Ä¢ Chicken Cantonese gravy chow
‚Ä¢ Mushroom shapta
‚Ä¢ Chicken Hakka noodles
‚Ä¢ Chilly pork
‚Ä¢ Mixed Thukpa
Cantonese chow was not authentic...they missed out some flavors.. Could be made better by adding necessary ingredients!
Chilly pork was super tasty! Though few pieces were chewy ...
Mushroom shapta was totally new to me... And I loved every bit of it... Specially the gravy that came with it...so tangy n spicy!
Hakka chowmein was gross!
Thukpa was actually superb.
** What I felt is their Tibetan items are way tastier than their Chinese items. ( totally my opinion)
** Portions were plenty.
So ratings : :
‚ô¶ FOOD : 4/5
‚ô¶ AMBIENCE : 3.5/5
‚ô¶ SERVICE : 5/5
‚ô¶ VFM : 5/5

I am reviewing this just on the basis of one dish that i have everytime i visit this place i e. Pan fried momos in hot garlic sauce.I haven't found a replacement for them.they are just so yummy and perfectly cooked.I had tasted pan fried momos for the first time in the blue poppy and still love it the most having been tried many other momo joints in the city.Though the place is a bit difficult to locate as there are no sign boards for this even outside the restaurant but once you have tasted their food you wouldn't search their replacement anywhere else.So reasonably priced and simple interiors which give an old calcutta feel.Being a vegetarain i get too less options to choose from( dats a drawbacküò¢)
Inspire of it being not advertised you shall have to wait for your turn to get a table coz during off hours and holidays everyone is rushing to the place. A must visit restaurant in the city for everyone who loves Bhutanese and sikkimese food and also for the ones who don't coz they ll end up being one next time.

Blue Poppy is tucked away on the first floor of Sikkim House on Middleton Row. This quaint restaurant is a city favourite for all food North Eastern.

The setup

The air smells of this somewhat mild spicy sweet sauce. The curtains are always down in this low-lit restaurant. While the layout at Blue Poppy is not much to write home about you are for sure going to get this huge smile from Ms. Doma if you care enough to look at her and say Hi! You will find her sitting behind the counter orchestrating the servers, the kitchen - in - between her juggling act with the phone and the bill book. Often during rush hour she moves around helping her staff serving tables. A rare act at restaurants by owners.

Grab a table and settle in. The boys dressed in almost matching black shirts are on the job and waste no time in bringing over a large laminated single page menu. All the plates and soupspoons are plastic. Used over and over again the plates have tell tale signs of feeding thousands of hungry stomachs.

The order

This time around I ordered the chicken momos - steamed to start off with. You just cannot come here and not have the steamed chicken momos. This was to be followed by a serving of thenthuk, chikan shaptak and sweet and sour pork ‚Äì without gravy. A serving of mixed thupka and chicken hot garlic to top all that off.

Verdict

The good folks at Blue Poppy work hard to whip up some good soulful food. After so many visits, we are yet to walk away with a disappointing experience - except that one time when I reached late and they had shut the kitchen! The price at which the food is offered is just perfect for the setting.

The service is as fast as they can keep up with the crowd. It is a small team that comes across more as a family than that of an owner and employee relationship. We have never felt rushed here. Unless of course you just sit there and be a douche during rush hour. We don't want this place to change. Every thing seems to work well and as long as Ms. Doma and her team keep serving the deliciousness.

Heard a lot about this place and was really excited when we went for lunch. I wanted to have a Phaley but was disheartened as I was told its not available. The chicken steamed momos were a bit dry. I have had better momos at other places in Kolkata. We also ordered Chilli chicken dry and Chicken Thupka. Both were ok-ok type. Nothing extra ordinarily special. The price is reasonable.

We ordered mixd rice mixd hakka noodles singapore chkn and chkn hot garlic. I liked all the dishes except the hot garlic chkn it was overloaded with tomato ketchup and had no flavour of garlic at all. Over all it was a good experience.
On my 2nd visit i tried fried pork momo, panfried chicken momo, mixd hakka noodles, rum chicken nd pork shapta. All the items were good. The pork shapta deserves spl mention. And the rum chicken was totally different had a mild orangy flavour.

To begin with, the outlet can seriously do better with a new d√®cor. This was my second visit to this place, fortunately this time around, we got a table. The Steamed Chicken Momo were good; unferstood since specialises in Momos. Singaporean Fried Rice wasn't exceptionally good. It was average. Whereas, the Chicken Manchurian was same as in other places serving Oriental dish. Coupled with a pocket friendly price, it's quite good for grabbing a quick snack. Overall, a mixed experience.

Let's start with no taxes. As it is under Sikkim government's tourism department you won't have to pay taxes. Nice cozy place and much friendly on the pocket compared to other restaurants in the area. During festive seasons the place gets a bit on the crowded side so you may have to wait but on a regular day it is really a nice and peaceful place to enjoy with your loved ones.

One of the best Chinese/Tibetan food joint in the city. Moreover, the prices are very reasonable. Please do not expect great ambiance. The location is very easy to find, its walking distance from maidan metro.¬† 

Now for the food. Well, delicious is an understatement. Most of the things that you will order from the menu will not dishearten you. If you like thai food try Mixed Thenthuk. Its a thick soup with hand-made noodles. Momos are to die for. Also loved the mixed schezwan fried rice and garlic chicken.

This is one of my favourite places since my school days thus definitely featuring in the students fab chart . The review is broadly defined as under the following heads :-

1) AMBIENCE : very cozy and homily atmosphere , if you have visited Darjeeling the environment inside might look familiar .

2) FOOD : wide variety of Indo-Chinese , Tibetan , Bhutanese food feature in the la cart√© menu . Hakka noodles , chilli chicken , Fried rice are really delightful to feast on. But particularly I would like to mention the Pan Fried momos on garlic sauce (chicken or pork) which really brings me to this place again and again.

3) SERVICE : the service is really prompt and the people are really polite and cooperative :-)

4) POCKET PINCH : really affordable and reasonable especially considering the fact that the restaurant is situated in Russell Street.

Being very fond of North East Indian / Tibetan food, i would rate this place highly due to authenticity at affordable cost.
This is not a place to go for chinese food - chinese food here is like any below average cheap chinese joint.
Bhutanese, tibetan food served here is really good - momos ( Pork momo available :) ¬†), thukpa, phalay ( probably the only place in kolkata serving phalay), thenthuk, mentse, bhutanese shapta and datshis are quite good. we usually have momos and menses here.
We also tried Nepali thali non veg (Pork) and it was fine.
best part is that the place is clean - one of the cleanest places in kolkata where you get good momos. usually momo joints in kol are quite unkempt

Nestled in a corner of The Sikkim House..it's quite a revelation! Pocket-friendly..serves real good food..specially the thukpas and momos. The dry variant of chilli pork is a must-try! :)
The service is fine too.
The only downside is lack of advertisement(no hoardings/sign-boards).
Nonetheless,give it a shot!

My first Line for this place - The Best Momos In the City, nobody beats it..The first time I tried it was in 2010 and till today it's the best. I am from the hills, where momos are the best, almost every momo joint in the hills is very good. After innumerable horrible momo joint I was introduced to this place, it's equally good like the hills. Specially the Mirchi Chutney served along with. Nothing else matters.
Nevertheless it's a regular outlet, nothing fancy. It serves quite a many hill dishes, but I Have tried only momos. Pricing is decent cause of the awesomeness of the food.
Service isn't very great but one can manage all that for the momosüòùüòã

Been a regular here since way back.the quality has somewhat gone down. Their chinese is very basic . My momo plate was chipped and faded colour which was a put off. Chicken momos were ok. Chilly chicken had a very ajinamotoy taste to it, noodles had very few veges and only mostly onions. Not worth the long wait on weekends.

No problem....The Blue Poppy caters to your need. It's an awesome place to have a great Chinese meal. The price is extremely reasonable and the quantity is more than adequate. The pan fried momo is tasty. Tried a number of pork dishes...all were delicious. The mixed chowmein contains lots of meat and shrimp. 
On the downside...the decor is plain and practical....but the cordial waiters and the food makes up for it. A must visit to all the food lovers.

Those steamy pork momos filled with juicy minced pork will take you right back to the Himalayas. To any Bhutanese person their Ema Dachhi is kickass; though a bit modified. Also a must try is this Tibetan dish called Pork Shapta which is a roasted and spicy pork preparation. The aroma and the taste go hand in hand. You will be able to taste the smokey roasted flavour of the pork yet enjoy the spiciness of the dish overall. P.s. Roasted pork fat has never tasted this good.
And to any Nepali person.....jaga ko khana ramro cho!
The friendly staff will make you want to come here often. Easy on the pocket too!
If you are a newcomer to Tibetan and Nepali cuisine what better way to explore than to try their Steamed Momos?! Then you may work your way through the Thukpas!! Cheers!

One visit, and this place is pure love. 
Where do I even start? 
From the smiling yet effective waiters to the thin, perfect skin of their momos ( their momos are the best, skill wise and in terms of authenticity). I love the steamed ones, but the fried momos and pan fried momos I wont recommend - not only are they sacrilege to the purity of a momo, the momo dough is just not suited for those atrocities. Stick to steamed momos here, I say. 
I also love all sorts of the nepali-Tibetan food they make, and often will recommend you to try them over their Chinese. That said, their chili garlic noodles are hot, spicy, well fried, and I love that the big prawns they serve you are spotlessly deveined yet are briny and crisp. 
Also their thukpa is huge, flavourful, perfect, and out of the world good when you're down. 
I also am in mad love with their dallay paste, I've never had anything that's close to it ever, and its perfect for chili addicts like me. 
Also their service is warm, effective and fast, the food doesn't bear taxes and I highly suggest this place for a workday lunch. 
And yes, I'll definitely come back!

An amazing and underrated place! It is on the first floor of Sikkim House, near Xaviers and it is impossible to guess that there would be such a great food wonderland from the look and feel of the building from outside.

We ordered steamed chicken momo, pan fried pork momo, chicken thukpa, chicken clear soup, chilly pork, pepper chicken, american chopsuey, mixed friend rice and soft drinks.

The service could be a little slow but with the demand and the crowd, it is but obvious. The food is fantastic and the prices are pretty less and for the delicious food items, the prices are way to less!

The momos are out of the world and that is the best thing I like here. The other food items are amazing and nothing would disappoint you. I have not tried the Nepali cuisine here but the Tibetana nd Chinese are definitely GREAT! :)

The quality of nepali and tibetan food offered here is mind blowing. Overeating becomes your best pal when you are here. My recommendation is the Pan fried Pork momo. The sweet chili sauce in which the momos are cooked does a wonder to my tongue. It's just out of the world.

Few days back, while roaming the streets of maidan at dusk, my wife and I had this awesome desire to munch on some soft delicious momos, luckily I remembered this place which I have been itching to visit for long. 
It is located in the 1st floor of Sikkim house. Sikkim house is located on the opposite side of the Middleton chambers, which is a straight walk from the maidan metro- jiwandwip.
Simple, laid back ambience welcomed us to this place. As planned, we ordered a plate of pan fried momo in garlic sauce along with a bowl of tom yum soup to the friendly looking attendant.
The food came in quickly. The momo coated in red sauce, looked yummy. The tomyam soup on the other hand lacked the lustre of its own self. Whatever it was, it sure wasn't tom yam! There was no dash of sourness, spice or kafir lime leaves in it. Though there was literally big pieces of chicken swimming in it, the soup in general was bland n a downer.
The momo on the other hand looked very appealing n seductive, but overuse of tomato ketchup in making the gravy of the momo made it appalling in the end. Though, I must say the momo was good in general, having soft texture and decent enough fillings of chicken, but the overall package wasn't good enough and too much ketchupish.
I was hungry and decided to order a plate of dry chilli chicken. The dish came soon enough. Again it wasn't upto mark. Lacked the spicy touch, I was looking forward to.
Overall,reading the rave reviews, I had huge expectations from this place, but may be as result of our wrong choice of orders or simply because of sheer bad luck, our taste buds weren't delighted to the taste as expected of this place. It was a huge disappointment.
But I'll personally give this place another try, cos I want to try their steamed momo, thukpa n pork dishes.
It cost us 450 bux.

P.s. I've this awesome idea n interest of finding the most delicious momos/ dumplings made in Kolkata, for that I have to sim
ply try their steamed momos!! I think, that'll fare better than what we had.

Had heard about this place a lot of times so thought of giving it a try.First of all its an easy location.Like i have always said i am not a big fan of the ambience.Its a small place but the service is SUPER FAST which we loved.Now coming to the food we ordered the PORK KOTHAY and it was very impressive cause i finally saw pork in the momo then just onions which is the situation in most of the places.Its quite tasty also since its a bit crispy as it a half fried and half steamed.Then we ordered Chicken hakka chow with Lemon chicken and an Indian thali.The chow was good but the portion was sad.All the dishes in the thali was good. I liked the fact that here you don't have to pay an extra tax with your bill,it's already included in every item.The menu also has Nepalese food which i wasn't sure of so didn't venture out.Over all it was a good experience hope to come back n try the other dishes.

went there after almost 10 years!!! prices have obviously changed but the authenticity of food and the taste remains good..!
Pork Kothay, Pork Phalay, Stir Fired Greens, Pork Shapta, and Mixed Fried Rice!!
Quantity was good and all preparations were an ode to Ladakhi-Tibetan cuisine..!
Pork Shapta and Stir Fried Greens were the stand outs!
I am sure next visit is not 10 years away!!!

Place has a nice ambience.The service is pretty quick. It serves authentic Chinese and Thai food. Something I would add about the thalis offered, the number of items is pretty less compared to the price. The babycorn item was too oily...it was oozing oil. Even they took 10 bucks extra (though a mere amount) in the bill.

Food quality and ambience is good; but i was disappointed by the quality of the thalis they serve. We also tried sweet and sour chicken, chicken egg fried rice, and crispy chilli baby corn. The sweet and sour chicken and the crispy chilli baby corn were extremely sweet as they used tomato sauce generously. I didn't liked the sweetness of these two dishes. Otherwise, it's a nice place for good food.

Awesome MoMos..... ‚ô°
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Kolkata. I often visit this place with my friend. One can have different varieties of momos. I always go for Veg Steamed Momo, and it tastes great. Other than that, thupka and chowmein are my favorite. This place is pocket friendly too. :-)

The best momo's in the city. The joint has the atmosphere of a relaxed college canteen/dining room, which is a good foil for the food that it serves. The prices are fantastic as well.¬†

The pork kothay (had steamed-half fried) are legendary, the mixed greens are also surprisingly enjoyable. Friendly staff and a family-run feel make The Blue Poppy a must visit for the quintessential Calcutta momo experience.¬†

It's located inside Sikkim house - so it really is the real deal.

Honestly it is a little tough for first timers to locate the restaurant.There are no signboards or banners which will lead you to this destination.The food here is just amazing;especially the momos.Had ordered a pan fried chicken momo,fried chicken momo,mixed hakka noodles,mixed fried rice, fish manchurian,schezuan chicken,virgin mojito.The momos,the noodles and the fish manchurain were out of the world.The other food items were also appreciable.We had gone on a busy weekday and guess what the restaurant was full and there were people waiting outside.So the popularity of the food joint is well evident.Would love to pay another visit.

Blue poppy is like those perfect restaurants you want which will serve you momos at it's best and have a pleasant ambiance around .
This place has nothing great in decor and set up but the food is doing a great business here as many people who love authentic momos come here and its pretty cheap and doesn't hurt the pocket in terms of the number of momos they give along with soup . Then another item which you can try here is the thukpa which is very healthy and well prepared , you can also get a soft drink along with these foods to complete your meal stomach full .

Of late I don't visit this place however I am looking for every excuse to indulge in some yummy momos soon and as well as all the other items in the menu .

It's a small place and ambience isn't that good too. But the best place for momo lovers and college and school goers who don't want to spend a lot. Pocket friendly, best momos, quick service and no hurry to leave the table.. What do you want more!

The Blue Poppy is a small restaurant located in the Sikkim House on Middleton Row. Pretty easy to find when you know what you are looking for.

Coming to the restaurant, it was super crowed, presumably the Christmas time rush, but we had to wait nearly 45 mins for an 8 person table to open up.

We had various types of momos, including Steamed Pork momos, which were delicious, and my friends had fried veg and chicken momos.
For the main course, we had Pork Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice and Mixed Fried Rice, along with Honey Chicken, Hot Garlic Chicken and Chilli Fish.

The food was pretty tasty and overall good enough. The ambience was typical small restaurant, nothing to talk about. Price was reasonable, coming in at a total of Rs 2400 for 8 people, and we were fully stuffed by then.

A great variety of taste. Mixed fried rice is a class here. You can add extra chicken/mushroom/pork . much affordable.

For starters, we ordered Fried chicken momo, fried pork momo and fried vegetable momo. I only tasted the fried chicken momo and it tasted good. Whenever I have had fried momo in any other restaurant, they have served it doused in a sauce. For some reason, this place serves it without the sauce.

For the main course, we ordered pork noodles, chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, and vegetable noodles along with Chili Fish, Honey Chicken, Garlic Chicken and Baby Corn as side dishes. There's nothing wrong with the taste of each of these items, they're all fantastic. The Baby corn tastes sweet and isn't crispy at all although it is called Crispy Chili Baby Corn.

I'm disappointed with the quantity they serve. One plate of rice isn't enough for two people, but at the same time, it is too much for just one person. Too less gravy in the side dishes.

I would go back to this place on some other day to try some of their other items and add to this review.

Momos!!!

One of the best places to grab some momos and other sikkim food.¬†

I must caution you that their sauce served with the momo is very very spicy! But thats the best part. (I love spicy food) The tip is to not allow the spice to catch onto your tongue. Once it does - you'll find everything else that touches your tongue to be spicy and that will just ruin all the fun.

I recommend the steamed momos and the kothay(Half fried momos)

Their chinese food is also very good.

The best part is that it is very reasonable! You'll find a lot of young crowd from college and working people.

One of my favourite eateries. I have been dining regularly here for the last 10 years. Even after their success, they have not compromised on the quality of momos, kotheys, thukpas. Also try their chilli pork - its fabulous. I would also recommend the pepper chicken. This is a must visit eatery for all foodies, especially lovers of Thai & Tibetian cuisine.

Not very difficult to find, located on the first floor of sikkim house near vardan market.

The place has minimal decor and the staff are not very friendly. 

I had heard quite good reviews about the place so i had quite high expectations. I ordered for a plate of chicken steamed momos and a plate of mixed noodles. Both were pretty nice but nothing exceptional. The bill was around 620 for 2 of us which I guess is high for a place like blue poppy.

Had heard a LOT about this place. Always thought it was called sikkim house but recently found out it's called the blue poppy. Didn't have much trouble finding the place. People in the area directed us right too it. Anyway went there for lunch. Just got there an hour before closing time. The place was packed so had to wait a while for a table. Didn't have to wait for too long though. We ordered veg steamed momo, veg pan fried momo, veg thukpa and veg chilli garlic chowmin and mojitos. The service is very quick. The momos tasted very good. The sauce. Omg. So hot. Wouldn't recommend people to try it if you can't handle the heat.

The place is a bit crowded but the food is awesome. I went there with my friends and 6 of us ordered a variety of dishes...mixed fried rice, mixed Chinese chopsuey, steamed pork momos, mushroom hakka noodles, chilly pork and pork manchurian. The pork momo was awesome, and the other two pork dishes were well seasoned, the meat was succulent and the gravy had bits of pork fat which made it more tasty. Didn't like the chopsuey that much though. Other dishes were of good quality and quantity was sufficient. The prices were reasonable and after a long time I had a taste of good Chinese and Tibetan cuisine.

I visited this place recently after having read about it a lot on Zomato. Its close to the Maidan Metro Station, on the Middleton Road, behind the Sikkim Place. For a first timer it might be a little tricky to find. The ambience is nice. It isn't a huge place but the staff are very helpful. I had Cantonese Noodles with extra meat toppings. Its was really good. The food was served rather quickly, so no complains there. It is extremely pocket friendly and the quantity and quality of food is very good. So for anyone looking to have decent Chinese food at reasonable price, this is one of the best places.

P.S. - I didn't go through the menu card  carefully but did notice that they offer other Asian cuisines as well. Would hope that Zomato updates this new menu card.

OK..first of all.have been listening about this for sooo longgg..it was so hyped up that I instinctively thought it won't be able to live up to its hype.. But boy was I so wrong.. A shabby place..average ambience it looked from outside .but as we went inside we heard a buzzing crowd who were clearly enjoying their food, and immediately I wanted to order evryrhing. We ordered chicken steamed momos , dry chilli chicken and chicken noodles . the noodles were fine and the chilly chicken was nice..but the momos and that hot sauce just blowed our mind..the momos are even better than what people say about them, soft juicy succulent and that sauce was spicy as hell..yummmy.. .. And the service is good plus its pocket friendly. Too .. Remember it's is closed from 3:30 to 5:00 pm.so make sure to time your self properly.. Finding it is a bit tricky ..but its a must try for evry momo lover EVER!!!!!

A perfect location to pamper your taste buds with Chinese .. It is a small Chinese restaurant, with pretty ordinary interior decoration which serves authentic Chinese cuisine at affordable prices!! That's the whole summary of this place..
After running like madcaps from Esplanade splanade to Park Street at "Bhaiphonta" .. We were having monstrous hunger pangs that even a mouthwatering double cheese chicken burger from a roadside stall also couldn't curb.. So mah chweetttt adorable brother took me for a dinner at this outlet..!!! Bazinga!!! Nice hospitality & decent ambiance with great taste of foods is the main attraction of this place.. The staff is so polite and very cordial.. 
Are you craving for the Tibetan & Nepalese food?? Then this is the place to be ; cause same thing goes for this as well perched in Sikkim House..I am particular about the food..But they Serves the best pan fried momo in town ..
And the best part is about their price rates ; will amaze you, very reasonable and value for money...

4 for services. 4 for food. The most important thing about this place is nepali cuisine. Die for 'em. I am just a lil disappointed by the service actually but then the food is great and in huge quantity. Momo comes without soup, so there is the negative marking for that. Nice ambiance. And great food, i repeat. More than sufficient. Order the chili pork whenever you hit this destination. Good place to catch up with your friends.

Always buzzing with crowd its recommended to book tables beforehand. Try out their momo s and ema and kewa dachi-the best i have since having them in bhutan.ema means   chilly and kewa means potato cooked in gravy made of cottage cheese.pure bliss.staffs are polite and courteous and very prompt. Price is reasonable. Its located in the 1st floor of Sikkim house just beside National Insurance HO in Russel Street.

This is one gem of a restaurant.  No ads,  no boards outside the sikkim house, but yet the place always remains filled! 
Has a good enough seating arrangement. Though be prepared to wait if you're going at peak hours. 
Now the food. Absolutely lovely 
Tried the pan fried and fried pork momos.  Both were a delight. But i prefer the fried ones. 
Next we had a mixed thupka divided amongst two people. Plenty amount.  The soup was really well made, probably the best thupka dish I've had evr had! On the sides we@ ordered Pork shapta. Spicy dish. But most of it was pork fat,  so I didn't like it that much.. Dry chilli pork still remains my favorite here.
And all of this at a very pocket friendly price of less than 200 per head! 
This place calls for repeated visits!

This is a must-visit if you're in Calcutta! Lip smacking, value for money and amazing! Do not judge the food going by it's non-pretentious no-frills decor of simple wooden chairs and tables. Their chili pork is to absolutely die for, so is the kothay! Well almost everything is pretty brilliant! Two main course dishes (noodles/rice/side dish) is enough for 3. Please please make it a part of your next visit to Calcutta if you haven't been there already, and I personally guarantee it's gonna be worth the waiting time! :)
P.S. if you're going for lunch, try to make it before 1, as it gets really crowded around that time on weekdays.

This place is situated inside Sikkim house on the first floor. Said to be a authentic Chinese and tibetain restra. Personally I dint find it to be authentic at all. 
The food is good enough to taste but its the service that disappoints me about this place. They serve in paper plates for most of their items on menu. Further even the crokery if any provided is not clean and very old to say the least. 
To say truly I felt it to be a street food joint within walls to be just named a restra. I give it a 3 star rating just for the food they offer. If to say about the service or the ambience, lets just say, its highly over rated.

Situated at the sikkim house right oppo site to the back gate of Loreto college, this is a place foodies swere by.Service wise they are very helpful and swift. Decor is very basic but it actually doesn't matter as the food is just fab. Also the variety in terms of north-eastern cuisines is quite a choice to be spoilt for. Be it Chinese,Tibetian,Bhutanese they know how to leave a long lasting taste on your palate.We went for Pork and Chicken Steamed momo respectively along with Pork thukpa.

The momos were real good, the stuffing is in good amount and the dough isnt too thick. The Pork Thukpa was real good too,but somehow the noodles have changed earlier they provided thicker noodles this time though the noodles were thin,which I think isn't good as thicker ones are a better choice.

Also I would recommend Chicken/Pork Phaley, Gundruk/Kinema, Singapore chicken,Lemon Chicken,Pepper chiken, Honey Prawn, Chilli Pork.¬†A must visit for the foodie especially those who have a taste for the north-eastern cuisines and also those who are looking for places which are easy on the pocket.

The Blue Poppy is well famous in Tibetan & Chinese dishes & holds a higher rating on Zomato. As a Chinese lover I decided to give it a try.

Location : You need to take a deep breath before searching for this place. If you try to follow the GPS to reach here then you will surely go back home. The location is straight from the Maidan metro to the lane till you see the Vardan Market or Westside. But don't cross the road you can locate The Sikkim House just at your right & your GPS should point that as Blue Poppy. You will not find any banner, poster or lights of Blue Poppy at the Sikkim house but don't hesitate just enter from the right side gate. Go upstairs or take the lift to go to 1st floor & you probably have reached. Even over there you will not find any name banners. I didn't understand why is it so!

Decoration : The restaurant is very simple, small but elegant. Lots of sittings available & they are comfortable too. Clean & hygienic it is. Some Chinese warm white lights gives this place a different look.

Staffs & Management : The staffs were young guys, they behave well, servers you really fast & do recommend their best dishes. Not only that they also take care of the customers about their liking of the foods over here or not.

Foods : Blue Poppy is famous for their Tibetan & Chinese dieses, so as per that we ordered the following...

Egg Fried Rice : The first dish that I tasted over here is Fried Rice with so much expectations. And the expectations fall of just with the first spoon. The rice were well cooked but it was more on the drier side. Very small diced vegetables mixed with that felt good & spices were mixed very properly. The quantity was very less to fill a hungry tummy. Overall the whole thing tasted very average to me.

Egg Hakka Noodles : The Hakka noodles came in the same kind of bowl & it looked very delicious. Just like the Fried Rice the quantity of the noodles were pretty less. The noodles were very thin & quality was good. The vegetable ingredients & spices were well mixed. The noodles tasted me really good & I was feeling the real Chinese for a while. It was kind of drier side but noodles felt good like that & adding some gravy item with that would be pleasure. This noodles impressed me a lot & may be it can make me come over here twice.

Dried Chilli Chicken : Chilli Chicken came in a bowl with only 6 very small pieces & more onion pieces than capsicum pieces. Chicken pieces were little harder than expected & tasted very dry. The whole plate was containing only 2-4 small capsicum pieces that was very odd. The whole thing tasted very garlic that was not so enjoyable with Fried Rice or Noodles & it doesn't impressed me at all.

Pan Fried Pork Momos : This is the dish Blue Poppy is known for, so we decided to order it at last. There was 8 fried momos in a single plate with a saucy gravy on it. The momos were crispy fried outside & juicier inside. Inside of those momos were filled with little less onion pouring than needed where I didn't found much pork pieces. Sizes of the momos were bigger than usual. Where the spicy gravy were very tangy due to use of more sauce than needed. The sauce smells little odd to me. This was making the whole momos tastes over tangy & others spices & pork tastes was almost gone. Somehow I didn't found anything so special to make it more famous.

Prices : First of all they don't take any kind of vat or service tax, so it already becomes affordable in a way. Although the prices on the menu card looks like very balanced & affordable but looking at the quantity of the food then its hard to say that once again.

Conclusion : This hard to find place may be very famous to some kind of people, But personally I felt that this place is overrated. This place is only good for casual dining with friends & expecting a large satisfying dinner can disappoint you a little. If you want to taste something different & hunting for a small evening food then this place is recommend because of its large variety dishes & overall good quality.

It is located at Russell street. Near jevandeep bus stop. After seeing a lot of reviews we finally decided to go there. We ordered vegetable fried rice and hongkong chicken. I must say it was a bitter disappointment for us. The hongkong chicken was more like chilly chicken in a pool full of soya sauce.  The fried rice, however, was undoubtedly good.

Well it was a bit difficult finding this restro!located inside the Sikkim house building with no such hoardings noticeable outside!The restro could be defined with one adjective and that is "ok". The staff is not the most courteous and friendly group.The interiors are not the best you would see and food is just 'okay'.If you are near Middleton road or Russel street you can try this place out!

If you are in Kolkata and craving Tibetan or Nepalese food this is the place to be. They serve, by far, the best momos and chilli pork in the city. However, on a recent visit I found the quality of food to be slightly below the high standards they have set for themselves. We had visited The Blue Poppy for dinner. The momos and the Pork fried rice were top notch as usual, however the chilli pork was not as tender as it usually is. We tried the Chicken TomYum Soup which was very disappointing. The Virgin Mojito had a very synthetic taste. I am sure it was just an off day for them and that they will continue to serve the great quality of food that they usually do.

A great place for satisfying your crave of Chinese and Tibetan food. Serves great Chowmein (also in pork, which is a must have).  The momos are to die for,  go for steamed chicken momo.  But the best is the cheap prices, prices are mostly with Rs 150 which makes your mouth water as soon as you open the card.  The ambience is nothing to write home about,  but its clean,  what else can you expect for the price. Bon appetite

Okay.
I have NO IDEA how this place has got such high ratings.

The food literally ruined our Shashti,because to a foodie eating is a very important part of a Puja outing. :3
The starters were still good. Pan fried momos,crispy baby corn and fried chicken gave us hope.
The side dishes for the main course was a disastrous affair. The lemon fish was so horrible,so much flour used in the coating that it made me feel pukish,the gravy was nice though. The chilli pork couldn't be chewed. The chicken side dishes were bearable still.
Even the fresh lime soda was so bitter.
People would say it's because of the Puja crowd,but that's no excuse.

And the service is bad,just bad. I had called them three to four times to get a reservation. They said they don't have reservations. Now that is completely okay. But they disconnected the phone when I asked them if it was crowded already. The very next moment they stopped receiving the calls. Very bad experience. Not going back for ordinary tasting chinese food just for the price. -_-

I would love to give this place a five on five rating. Located on the first floor of Sikkim House, Middleton Row, this is one of the best chinese restaurants of the city. We went at a peak hour and had to wait outside for about twenty minutes before getting seated. Since they close down the restaurant for an hour from 4-5 p.m for lunch break, we were asked to hurry up with our orders, as it was almost 3:30 p.m when we finally got an entry to the place. They serve excellent food, I must say..
We relished having Chicken Panfried momos and Crispy Chilly Babycorn as starters. The momos were mouth-watering, though a bit spicy.. A plateful of babycorn came is an extremely cute attire...like nowhere I've seen before. We chose hakka noodles (both veg and non veg) , veg fried rice , garlic chicken, singapore fish and chilly pork.   Though I didn't taste the pork, I'm sure it was succulent, since it looked so..and  most importantly my friends, who tasted it, said so. The hot n sweet garlic chicken was yum, tasted great with both rice and noodles. The singapore fish pieces were soft, juicy and tasty, though I didn't like its gravy, much. Since we were super hungry and our time was too short, we gobbled up the food ignoring the burns that we got in our buccal cavities, the food being served too hot! Not to miss out, the bill, which was so less that we initially had the impression that they must have made calculation mistake in a hurry!! It is a must visit for each n every foodie.

Finally manage to visit this place after numerous plannings and deliberations. The food was good. Very good. The pan fried momos were succulent and felt good to consume. The chilli pork was good but could have been better. The quantity is ample. But the waiters were very hasty in their approach and not much amiable. Obe of them was quite rude. Overall the experience was a mediocre one.

After a horrenduous experience at Denzong, my craving for good momo just got increased. And we headed to Blue Poppy today to find out whether the hype is true or as false as that of Denzong's.
Location: It's near the maidan metro station, if you get out by Gate No.1 and keep walking straight, keeping an eye on the left, you reach sikkim house within 5 mins. Blue Poppy is on the 1st floor of Sikkim house.
We reached at around 2 pm and it was full, we had to wait for around 15 mins to get ourselves a table. Their coupon system made it a very hassle free event. Only if they add a fan in the waiting area, it will be better. Once we got in, the ambience and aroma made us all the more hungry. The interiors are done very simply and the lightly lit place makes a homely and cozy atmosphere. 

Service: +1 for their service, it's so fast and efficient, they serve your food within minutes of taking your order. Highly impressed.

Food: We ordered chicken thukpa which they gave us an option of dividing 1 into 2. And it was enough for 2 people. But one negative point was that they divided without noticing the amount of chicken and noodles into the bowls and while one of the bowl had more noodles, the other had all the chicken. :( 
We also ordered chicken steamed momo and yes! After a lot of days,I had momo that satisfied me. At 8 pieces/plate, it is a gorgeous affair. But they can make the chutney a bit less spicy, but then what is momo w/o that hoo... haa...after effects!?
I absolutely loved the place and will definitely be back soon to try out the other dishes. 
P.S they are closed from 4 to 5 pm.

If you want pocket friendly good food this is the place... here i had chicken wonton soup it's very mild with flavours of the pepper, the wontons are soft and the filling was the best of all.. ¬†fried chicken wontons were also awesome the chicken filling inside was very unique and the flavours added was perfect.. the chilli sauce that they serve is mind blowing... pan fried chicken momo.. the filling of the momo were delicious the chicken was juicy and full of flavour but the sauce of the pan fried momo was something unique... ¬†than the egg chill garlic rice was good the amount they serve is more than enough for 2 people.. the rice had a mild flavour of the chilli and garlic which gave a ¬†different taste.. ¬†than chicken meifoon.. this is something i had for the first time.. the thin rice noodles were properly cooked and the way they prepared was just awesome... chicken sapta.. it consists of shreded chicken pieces cooked with onion and capsicum in a thick saucy gravy.. this is also good but nothing extraordinary.. finally last but not the least rum chicken.. this is something i just loved,, it was sweet and sour in taste with a complete different sort of aroma and flavour in it... something i loved.... overall i loved this place.. it might be a bit crowded but its worth spending money here..
Highly recommended!!

This place is located very close to ICCR , and is a five minute walk away from maidan metro station . The restaurant is on the first floor of Sikkim house , and the lunch hours may keep you waiting outside with a token in your hand till your turn arrives . We reached at around 3 pm and had to wait for almost 20 minutes before we got a chance to enter and be seated . The staff here are friendly , and though most of their tables are for 4 or 2 people max , they arranged for our group of 6 with a few extra chairs  . The only problem here seemed to be the timing , which prevents the restaurant from enetertaining guests after 4 pm. So we were told that we couldn't order any more dishes after the first set of food , as it would exceed the time limit. Apart from this the restaurant seemed like a cost place for some great Chinese, and of course pork , which you cannot miss of you're here . They don't serve dessert but you can order sift drinks in 500 ml bottles or glass bottles . The chilli pork here is amazing ! Do not miss it . The pan fried chicken Momo was delicious too ! The crispy chilli baby corn served here looks like a plateful of cute tiny corn balls , and not like the usual longish variety one finds elsewhere . The garlic Hakka noodles went well with the dry chilli pork , which BTW , is very very spicy. Overall , a must visit for every pork lover in Kolkata !

On the 1st floor of Sikkim House, The blue poppy stands as a very ordinary restaurant with standard decor. We ordered Mixed fried rice and Rum Chicken, but i didn't like much either the quality or the quantity! Only the price is reasonable but then the service or the staff isnt well polished. And though mixed fried rice tasted fine but rum chicken was terrible to have.

Situated at the first floor of SIKKIM house so finding this restaurant is too much tricky. We passed two times to finding it and we cannot so after that we tried to ask a security guy and finally found it. 
Ambiance of restaurant is average and they don't serve water to you. You have to buy a mineral water to drink. 
We order mixed fried rice, rum chicken and chilli fish. 
After having the first bite we forgot all the complaints because the taste was so good. This restaurant is very crowdy all the time. So make sure to go before 2 pm because they close 3:30 to 5 pm. We definitely go again and try some other stuffs at future.

For main course we opted for singapore chicken and mixed garlic chilli noodles... good in taste but the mood spoiler? Shredded chicken in noodles were as hard as chewing gum... even the chicken in gravy was nt tender.. hadnt this been the case the visit would have been cherishable... good place for pork lovers!!

This is a really cool place. I love their pork momo and the dry chilli pork. The ambience or decor of this place is not that good but is okay for a small joint. I often visit this place. Recently they have increased the prices of the menus. And the last time i paid a visit their chilli pork did not impress me at all. To much fat and the quality of the pork was really bad. I think their prices are a little high for the type of establishment that is. Places like hungry tide, momo plaza are better choices than blue poppy

This has always been the place I have frequented when,

a) I am hungry
b) I am in and around that area.

The above statements are proof enough to say how good the place and the food is. Suitably priced, happy staff, prompt service and with a decent ambience, Blue Poppy is the ideal place for a quick snack in the evening or a moderately priced dinner/lunch with your folks. 

The Chilli Pork is a must try and ask for the 'fat' ka pieces. Trust me you won't regret these extra calories. 

Only thing is that the toilet can be renovated a little. It is not that clean.

This is one of my most favourite food joints. As this is near my college st. Xaviers, i frequently visit this place. The momos here are to die for..simply delctable. You can go for other chinese options too but you must have the momo first. Chilly pork is also very good. One thing worth mentioning is the behaviour of the staff. The manager took our order. He was so polite. So if you haven't been here before then you have surely missed upon something great. Completely paisa vasool.

Cannot think of a better place to go to for comfort food. Everything here is above average and when i say that I'm talking of the poor performers, most things on there menu will make you want to kick yourself for not getting here sooner. The Must order the kothay in any form. Veg or chicken or pork. Then thank me for telling you. Lol
The people are very sweet. They serve you fast and with smiling faces, now I don't know about you but that's good enough for me. There Thukpa is very good and must be tried. So too the regular steamed momo. After you have eaten your fill and the bill comes in you will be happy to know that not a single hole has been burnt in your pocket. The most value for money place you will go to in the city.

It is decent. Quality is good. So is the quantity. The d√©cor and interiors are well suited to its standards. For a posh area like Russel Street, one should be more thankful than not, to it for holding its price chart reasonably low. 
The taste of the food is like any other standardised Chinese restaurant, and maybe it is not difficult to find another restaurant elsewhere that is cheaper but equally good, but certainly, that place will not be in and around Park Street.

Looking to their interior would make you feel sad as they don't have music or great ambience but their food make the place worth it ! I ordered Steamed momo' and Fried momo' which is simply incredible and the best momo i ever tried in kolkata. Momo's are perfectly steamed! After having bad experiences in some places, finally i had the good qualities of momo which was not overcooked and being a momo lover, i would say it's a perfect place to trounce your momo craving ! #steamed momo is a must try dish with generous quantity ! Quality and price won't let you disappointed. worth visiting!

Kolkata food journey started off with this place and I must say that I consider it a good start. Awesome food at extremely reasonable prices. Pan fried momos were just superb. Clear soup served with momos was pretty decent. We tried chicken in hot garlic sauce and it was an alright dish. Mixed chicken egg pork fried rice were nice. Hakka noodles were good as well. Decent ambience. Prompt Service. Overall 4/5.

Being very close to my college, have frequented this place more so as a last resort than for any eating pleasure. Rates are student friendly but provides average chinese food most times with terrible food few times as well. Expect long delays and bad service.

PORKCRAVINGS
____________________________________________
This one literally is hidden. Ask the watchman at the gate of Sikkim House to avoid confusion.

Decor is nice and cozy. Air-conditioned and decorated with hanging lamps and few Tibetan wall tapestries.

Ordered pork steamed momos, mushroom fried rice & chilly pork.

The rave reviews about the momos here are absolutely justified. The steamed Pork momo was delicious. Soft and succulent. Made me determined to come back and try out the pan-fried momos.

The mushroom fried rice was decent. The mushrooms could have been a bit softer.

Had very hopes for the chilly pork. It was unable to meet them. When asked by the waiter whether i want it dry or gravy, i chose semi-gravy. Loved the fat on the meat but i found the gravy bland. It was also a bit low on salt.

The prices go easy on your pocket and quantity is quite generous.

**Special mention on the authentic Sikkimese flavor of the sauce with the momo. Watch out for the quantity, or the spice will make you weep.

We'd been craving for Chilli Pork for quite a while and after an agonising wait, our plans finally fell into place. 
The Blue Poppy is a quaint, unassuming place situated on Middleton Row where you can just relax with some good food. The servers are friendly and work promptly. 
The food in itself is so good that even if it were served in the desert, you would still go for it! :P

We satisfied our urges, go satisfy yours!

With one of the best Tibetian and Chinese food, this place has always been a favourite of mine. After trying the Salt Lake branch I wanted to check out this branch, which is more nearer to my place. So when I went there today old memories came back. It's similar to the Salt Lake branch with same food and same taste. We ordered fried chicken momos as a starter followed by mixed meifoon and garlic chicken. The chicken had a tomato ketchup rich gravy. Otherwuse the food was perfect. I'd personally recommend to take the dry items instead of the gravy. Overall it's a pocket friendly place with good ambience, decor and service.

This cozy place in the Sikkim House is a must visit place for Tibetan or Chinese food lovers. We had Wantons, Pork Momo, Dry Chilli Pork, Gravy Cantonese Chowmein and Rum Chicken. And the pocket pinch was just ‚Çπ700 for 3 people. I would suggest one should try the Rum Chicken which have the taste our very own 'Old Monk'. And apart from that you can have the usual Phalay or Pork Momo. One can easily distinguish between the Kind of momos or phalay we usually have in the streets in this city and the taste of originality one can have there in Blue Poppy.

This place has withstood all despite being in an obscure location, but how? 
Simply because they serve great tasting food at pocket friendly prices. It is my personal observation that places with low price bracket serve the best food, of course there are exceptions where even the hi-fi ones are also good. But more or less its like Cheap place, great food and Pricey place, shitty food. 
The ambience of the place is pretty much like every chinese mid bracket restaurant, medium light, simple wooden table-chairs and happy waiters. 
The service over here is very good, the wiaters are always on their toes to serve yyou best with a broad smile on their face. 
What I like here are the pepper chicken and the pan fried momos‚Äì simply incredible. 
I've also tried other stuff they serve but almost everything else has resulted jn a disappointment hence nevermind. 
Now why am I overlooking these flaws? Only because the two things which I like are so good that they undermine the flaws completely, one also has to consider the pricing, service, ambience, etc. Hence the above mentioned rating of 4.0
Cheers!

Chilly pork is really good! Not too spicy, not 1000 of different things going on, you will find the taste of real pork, even the pieces of fat taste good (and I don't eat fat anywhere else, but here I make an exception). Really good place with cozy ambience! :) I will keep coming here. :)

Went to this place after college hours with a bunch of friends. It is good to have an affordable chinese joint like this in your college area :D The ambience is very good. The place is a bit dimly lit with chinese lanterns (a plus point)..nice place for a hangout...although they are strict about the timings. I basically wanted to try out the different momos. Steamed momos turned out to be just fine. Wantons were quite tasty. But my personal favourite is pan-fried momos(delicious!). Thukpa is next on the list!

I went here today with my friend, and the 1st thing I must say is, the location is very difficult to crack if you are not well acquainted with the place... I used GPS to get to the location, but despite standing in front of the place, I could not figure out where the restuarant was until I asked someone over there about it... I actually can't even describe the location now... If someone comes with me, I may take him/her again, but can't explain it...
Now coming to the main part, the food!!! We went there in the evening after shopping at Metro Plaza, and so, just ordered a plate of Mixed Fried Rice and Lemon Chicken along with Pepsi... The Fried Rice was served well hot and it tasted good, but not great... The Lemon Chicken was a bit more sweet to my liking, but it was tasty if I avoided the gravy... The main thing was the cost... Including all the stuff, our bill was ‚Çπ300 with no extra taxes over the net amount...
One thing I need to mention is: the behaviour and care, that the waiters were taking, was worth noticing... They took all possible way to please the customers, and were very polite... But they didn't have any fixed uniform to distinguish them from the crowd, even though everybody wore black tees with different graphics or prints...
Overall- A great experience!!!
Thank you üòä

Located on the first floor of Blue Poppy is one of those easy on pocket momo (or proper chinese food if you want) joints that you frequent near the month end if your office is in the AC Market/Russell Street area. 

Exemplary in understatement, the place has never disappointed in providing lip smacking pan fried/steamed momos at affordable prices. Kind of like Jyoti Vihar of Chinese food, only cheaper.

Wanna date your pocket with some hot and sizzling Tibetan cuisine? chalk down the map to Blue Poppy (The Sikkim House), Russel street, a prime location in the city. Don't become judgmental at the entrance of the place, give a try to the delicious food served here. the ambiance is okay occupied by many travelers from Sikkim.

The main attraction of the place are the yummy steamed momos and pan fried momos in hot garlic sauce, which are a must try for any momo lover. this can be followed by chicken clear soup, hot and sour soups here. chicken egg fried rice, chicken noodles, chicken shapta, schezwan chicken were some options opted in the dinner and they turned out to be very tasty, giving the indigenous flavor of the place to a great extent.¬†

i would personally recommend every foodie to visit this place at-least once so as to know what the hype is all about.

I recently paid a visit to this place after reading all the rave reviews here on Zomato. We ordered chicken steamed momos first to be on the safe side, and they turned out to be just fine. Then I asked our server, who was a very polite person, to suggest us a good dry chicken dish and he suggested Singapore chicken. That was a blunder. Six small pieces of very chewy chicken with just a few pieces of raw green bell peppers were served to us in a bowl. On the contrary we were expecting bigger and softer for a price of INR 120. Akshay liked the dish but after having eaten some of the best dry chicken dishes in the bylanes of Elgin road, Behala, Anwar shah road, I had greater expectations from this place, especially going by the reviews here. Maybe it was a bad day by chance , or maybe its just like how it is with most other "famous" places in town, more hype than real taste.  I might have to go back once more  and try more food before I can bring myself to actually like or dislike this place. -- with Akshay Kapoor

The Blue Poppy is located in the 1st floor of Sikkim House in Middleton Row, near Maidan. This is a favourite spot for students who are always low on budgets but high on hopes. The Blue poppy serves quality food with a reasonable quantity at a very decent price. And most importantly, they do not charge anything as a tax outside what is mentioned on the menu. They have a great menu to offer which includes both Tibetan and Chinese dishes. The waiters are very quick and pleasant. We had the Chicken Egg Hakka Chow alongside Sweet and Sour Chicken and one plate of each was enough to be divided among two. We also tried momos and Chicken sweet corn soup. I would personally recommend everyone to have the pan-fried momos.

It was another solo date day! The staff is so polite and very cordial. I liked the spacing. They didn't have any music playing and I like it that way. When it comes to food, it should solely be about food. :D
After reading the many reviews I decided to order pan fried momos. People seem to swear by it. So, I ordered pan fried pork momos. Didn't like it one bit. :/ Too sweet. Too soggy. I am sticking to my beloved steamed momos from now. Then I ordered Pork Chilly. Everytime I see pork Chilly on the menu, I have to try it! It was mind blowing. From the first bite I took, the flavorrr. You HAVE to try it. If you eat pork and come to this place, do yourself a favor try the pork Chilly. 
I packed Alu Dum and Chicken Shapta for dinner. Alu Dum again was a hit with my taste buds. Chicken Shapta wasn't entirely very bad, as a matter of fact it was really delicious but I've had better. :D 
Just so we're clear I'm definitely going back! I genuinely enjoyed this restaurant and I can't wait to try out those steam momos!!

Blue Poppy is the place to go for delicious, cheap Chinese and Tibetean food. I have been here countless number of times during my college and even now this place won't get old.¬†The place looks very plain but is air conditioned. The lady at the counter is very sweet.¬†

Coming to the food, their Pan Fried Momos are one of the best I have ever had and they will customize it slightly if you want. I like mine saucy! I usually consider their Pan Fried Momos to be a benchmark a lot of times while eating out at other Chinese restaurant, but you probably can't get the same kind of stuff everywhere.

My other top picks at this place are the Hakka Chow, Meifoon, American Chopsuey, Rum Chicken, Honey Chicken, Chicken Hot Garlic and Chilly Chicken.

On a scale of 5, my ratings are:

A. Food - 4.5
B. Ambiance - 3.0
C. Service - 3.5
D. Wait Time - 3.5 (they are usually quick)
E. Value for Money - 5.0

With an overall rating of 4.0!

Don't think even once! Just go for it! And Make sure you order their Pan Fried Momos!!

Near maidan metro stn. First floor of Sikkim house. There is nothing as particular about the decorations, regular and neat. The food though is quite good nd at a reasonable price too.  Had pork pan fried momo nd chicken steamed momo as starters. The pan fried momo was class apart and the sauce was delicious. Then took a handmade noodles, one plate was enough for two and pork shapta along with it. The pork shapta was again another delight. The spice were awesome nd the pieces almost melted in the mouth. And all these came within rs550

Though I am a foodie I not a frequent restaurant visiter but once in a while maybe and since I search places from zomato,to eat for sure I felt I ought to share my pleasant experience of the blue poppy. I think four days back,me n my 11 friends went for an outing,unplanned for sure. It was almost by chance we ended up at Middleton road. At first we were unsure about how much it would cost to eat at this place(well we r students n this thing was unplanned after all) nevertheless we went there. At first we were told to wait for 20mins then we got to know it closes at around 3pm(I think 3:30pm) . as it was almost time we thought we won't have much but fortune smiled on us. Unexpectedly we were told to select the dishes n order them n wait.
Now about the place... Aah! The place! Though the place is not that big but the ambience is very pleasing. And The Food... Wahhhhh I can still smell them!!! I honestly forgot the names of the dishes since I am very bad in remembering things but I can assure u all the dishes were mouthwateringly delicious!!! In a word yummy! Pan fried chicken Momo I remembered was awesome, so was the chicken noodles and I forgot the rest of the names. Oh Pork Shapta n there was another pork dish almost looked like chilly pork but I can't recall the name (OK I am not a pork eater ,this is my secnd time after two years)
. these two dishes made my day! Me n one of my friend wanted to taste pork n I can assure u guys, u will fall for them too!!! Each n every dishes were awesome!! Daebak! All I wanna say is,go n eat there n yes the prices are reasonable as well!

One of the few decent places serving authentic Tibetian and Nepali food. Located on the 1st Floor of Sikkim house in Middleton road, I have been frequenting this place for the last 6 years. The quality and taste of the food is just as good as it used to initially except that they have reduced the quantity overall. Cant really complain as it is one of those rare places where they do not tax your bill.¬†
They have done up the decor and replaced the couches with chairs. I miss the soft couches though. The must taste on the menu is the momo- steamed, fried,pan-fried, kothay, all are lip smackingly tasty. The Thukpa too is good. They also have a lot of standard Chinese fare like the Chowmein and Fried rice, but I would suggest that you stick to the momos, thukpas and shaptas in this place as the other items are of a standard quality which you will get in any chinese food joint. A great place for good Tibetian food and you will get a good hearty meal in an affordable price.

The Blue Poppy is located on the 1st floor of Sikkim House. I have heard praises of this place from many of my friends. So i finally visited blue poppy with a friend today around 1pm.

The ambience is very simple. A large room with hanging lamps and the walls covered with curtains. The best part is that it is air conditioned :D The restro was full when we arrived and we were lucky enought that we got our seat instantly.

The menu covers various tibetian delicacies and also some chinese items. We ordered a chicken kothay momo, one egg chicken hakka chow and a pork shapta.

The order was placed within 5 minutes. Kothay momo is basically steamed momos whose one portion is fried. Sounds interesting ! One plate of kothay momo contains 8 momos at just 110 bucks !!! The taste was just amazing. They did provided a a special sauce and tomato ketchup on our table. The sauce was not very spicy and gave a very tangy and delicious taste to the momos. I previously used to satisfy my momo cravings as wow momo coz i believed no one can better momos than them. But blue poppy proved me wrong with larger, tastier and double the number of momos at the same price!!

Next it was time for the main course!! The noodles was served in good quantity which was enough for two of us after having the momo. I wont say the noodles was very good but yes it was tasty and had generous amounts of egg and chicken

Now the pork shapta is too good for words. Not very chewy not very hard just perfect ! Till date this is the best pork dish i ever had. The quantity was good. The pork meat was very succulent and juicy and was a perfect match with the noodles. For pork lovers, its my personal recommendation to have the pork shapta here!! A

Our bill came to INR 400. I actually did not except such good food from blue poppy after reading the negative reviews but the food impressed me in every way. Im surely coming back for the phyalays, thupka and the pan fried momos !!

The question in your mind "I want to have some awesome MOMOS,where to go??"'
The answer to your question is THE BLUE POPPY..
YES,this place serves the best momo in the city of joy..Be it steamed,be it fried or pan fried this place will never let ¬†you down..I personally like their pan fried chicken momos..
This restaurant is located in russel street,at the first floor of SIKKIM HOUSE..The ambiance of this restaurant is okay okay nothing to mention specially but who cares if they are serving you the tastiest momo..
I will personally apologize for not being able to post any photos of momo as i pounced on it as soon as it was served but i will surely afterwards..
Whether its pork/chicken momo,whether its fried or panfried or steamed this place will serve you the best momo..
Coming to some other items of this restaurant..I personally like their pepper fish..its dry,bit spicy but the fish is so soft and will melt in your mouth..tasted good..I personally did not like their mixed noodles dry..Their Chicken Hot Garlic is a mixture of sweet and spicy(this is what they said) but the gravy was a bit tangy..but it complemented the noodles well..They also serve one of the best thukpa in town..The Chicken PHALAY is another awesome thing to have..Its a round dough stuffed with chicken keema deeply fried..its an epic dish to have..And the Blue Lemonade is also good,tasty and refreshing..
Overall its a wonderful place to have some awesome momos..The price is not havy on your pockets..Its very cheap i would say..DONT MISS THIS PLACE..IF YOU MISS THIS PLACE THEN YOU ARE MISSING SOME GOOD MOMOS(Mainly Momo lovers)..

We 12 friends arrived at 3:15 at this place and were asked to wait as the restaurant was full. Then they said at 3:30 they're going to shutdown and they don't have anything except momos. As we were going to leave they called us back and informed they would take the last order 'only for us'! Apart from this weird experience, everything was too good here!
At a rush we ordered: Veg & Chicken fried rice, Veg Meifoon, Chicken Hakka Chow, Chicken Chilly garlic chow, Chicken Manchurian, Honey Chicken and 3 of their trademark dishes- Chicken Kothay, Chilly Pork & Pork Shapta.
Fried Rice and noodles were average, so were the chicken dishes. Chicken Kothay was basically pan fried momo, tasted good.
But the pork dishes were the real showstopper. It was my 1st experience of having pork and it was damn delicious. Those who haven't tasted pork yet should make their debut with these 2 dishes. Chilly pork was sizzling and yummy. Pork Shapta was the 'dish of the day' for me, spongy pork with spicy treatment- a must try for all!

The behavior of the staff was good, the ambiance was nice and most interestingly the prices were pretty cheap. We're surprised for getting such prices at a posh place like Park Street.

Waiting eagerly for the next visit... :)

I will base my review strictly on the chicken Hakka chow and chilli chicken that I had here. The items ordered were strictly average, in fact a few fast food joints serve better Hakka noodles at the said price point. The chicken pieces were chewy and the noodles had a few bits of shredded chicken that were hard as rubber. 
The staff were polite and quick. I would try the momo once, since everyone seems to have great appreciation for the same.

The ambience may not be up to the mark, but the food is good. The pan fried momos have the perfect blend of the ingredients and makes you crave for more. The dry chilli pork is amazing and so are the other pork dishes. The other Chinese items are average.

I've tasted their steamed momo, thukpa, panfried momo, chilli pork and fried mushroom. Probably Blue Poppy serves the BEST pan fried momos and that too at such a reasonable price. A pocketfriendly place to hang out with friends.

Only a shade of what the Blue Poppy on Russell Street used to be. Everything that this joint used to offer seems to have been toned down, bottled, packed, and sent to Salt Lake. It's so weird how different the 3 Blue Poppies are in Kolkata.
This BP on Russell Street is probably still better than it's counterpart in Lake Town, but comes nowhere close to the one in Salt Lake.
Food? Food is fine. Their chow is still pretty good. Their soup is better than average. Their momos aren't the best I've had, but they're edible. Their sides (Pork and Chicken) are below average. Can't argue with their Shaapta either.
Their restaurant decor and seating haven't changed much, if at all. It's still a little crowded and you will need to wait for seats.
Considering all of the above, the Blue Poppy could easily get a 3.5, but their service was atrocious! 10 minutes into our meal we were told to quickly finish up and leave because they needed to close. Irrespective of your repute, you don't do that - ever. They kept reminding us every minute or so, and I can't express how angry it made us. Hope this is looked into.

Blue Poppy still does stand out as an eatery. They close at 4pm, and open at 5 again for their evening session - wish I had known that. Value for money for sure. Their food is cheap, but unfortunately so was their service.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Yessss its a food joint for momo lovers, their pan fried chilli pork momo with hot garlic sauce is one of the best momo i ever had. Me and one of my friend tried this as starter & had mixed noodles. The noodles was okay okay type.
P.S - If you are a momo lover then you should go to this place and grab some momos.

Review 2-
Well no good place should go without a review number two, or three or more like double digits. Do try the pork sorpotel while you are here. The mein foon is an excellent accompaniment. I tried the chicken dimsums this time and they were nice but the pork dimsums take the prize home.
The staff is friendly and you can ask them for the "soup" as an accompaniment, which is basically fresh clean healthy broth.
Can't wait to go back again. 
Review 1- You haven't had dimsums till you have had them in Kolkata and especially at The blue poppy. Popularly known as the Sikkim house, as its a part of the building, this place is a bit hard to find for the tourists.
Once you are here, you feel like you are abroad in one of those tiny Chinese places with the feng shui, the Chinese decor and average table and chairs.
The staff is really sweet and they were even kind enough to pack food and hold it for us till late.
The pork dimsums come with a broth that is irresistible and essential with the burst of chilli from the sauce with the momos.
The pork chilly is worth a try too. As are the pot stickers.

I would have never found this place without the help of Zomato. There isn't a single sign-board or placard to suggest that this place even exists, so if you plan to visit- it is located on the first floor of Sikkim House on Russel Street. Approximately 5 minutes walking distance from Maidan Metro Station.

They have a homely ambience where you can enjoy delicious food with friends and family at jaw-dropping price. The staff is courteous and if you are confused about what to order, do not hesitate before taking their help. They recommended Kothay momos- momos that are fried on one side and steamed on the other and delicious stuff. I have had the best ever thukpa too at their place. 

If you are a pork-enthusiast like me, this is one of the rare places in the city where your taste buds and pocket can both be simultaneously satisfied. I plan to revisit and I hope to have the same wonderful experience.

Well, The Blue Poppy is a small Chinese restaurant. The restaurant is not very hard to locate. It is situated on the first floor @ Sikkim House building. The decor is not much appreciable. The sittings arrangements are most ordinary. The place wont attract you at the first sight. I went there with my better half after a tiring day when our stomach was filled with hunger. The mouth watering Chinese delicacies are worth appreciating. The foods are great in quantity as well as quality in respect to the price. We ordered for a plate of mixed fried rice, chicken hakka noodles , and dry chilli pork. But make sure to visit there before 3:30 pm because the restaurant remains closed from 4to 5 pm everyday. The restaurant is tax free, and pocket friendly. Taking into account the food it serves in respect of the price we hope to visit there again. :)

I had been hearing about this place for so long now, and I did once attempt to go to the Gorkha Bhawan outlet during the pujo for dinner but they were only serving momos so that had to be cancelled. After that I simply didn't get the opportunity but finally I was able to swing by the Sikkim house Blue Poppy a couple of days ago.
Coming to the service, the staff are truly humble and helpful. 
We ordered pan fried chicken momo, pork thukpa, mixed fried rice and rum chicken. My friends did not like the thukpa, saying it was "too mellow in taste", quite honestly I loved the flavour the herbs brought to it. But they should put a little more meat and a little less fat. The fried rice was great and quite generous in proportion. The rum chicken was pretty good too. I do not however understand why everyone keeps talking about the pan fried momo, didn't taste special. According to cost however, the food is unbelievably good.  
The ambience was alright, idk why everyone keeps mentioning it. 
Anyway all in all this place is definitely light on the pocket, also one gets to taste different dishes. I surely want to visit again.

The quantity of the food items is not enough for the price they are charging! And the quality of chowmein was also not nice! The only good part was the Shredded Chicken. It was totally worth it!

Situated right near Maidan metro station and in the vicinity of the St. Xavier's College, this place is always bustling with people. And why not! Nice little place with absolute fanstastic momos and Chinese!

I came to know about this joint from Zomato and eventually decided to plan a meet with an old friend in here. It took a while to find the place since its located on the 2nd floor of the Sikkim House at Russel Street. The interior decor was normal and the ambiance is pretty okay. After all you really shouldn't opt for The Blue Poppy if you're priority is just the classy feel. Rather, The Blue Poppy is about the superior and authentic food that they serve at reasonable prices! We ordered Egg and Chicken Fried Rice, Egg and Chicken Hakka Chow, Chicken Manchurian, Singapori Chicken and Veg Fried Momo for two of us and we were absolutely left spell-bounded at the quality of the dishes. The fried rice was tasty and in good amount; the hakka chow was delectable and the chicken dishes were mouth-watering. You should really try the Manchurian if you're here. The fried momo came after a long wait but it was worth waiting for. Overall, in Blue Poppy, you feel like you're in a small Sikkimese territory where legitimate cuisine is a primacy. The waiters were extremely courteous and even thanked us for dining while we were leaving.

All in all, if you're on a budget but compromising in the taste is not really your thing, you've got to come to The Blue Poppy, simple as that! Have a good day! :)

I had heard about this long time ago and a treat from my bestie landed me up here. On the outside, Blue Poppy doesn't give you a premiere feel and looks quite ordinary. The ambience too isn't upto the mark and seems lazy. But the food and service is something to look forward too. It offers you one of the most prompt service team in the city eateries. We ordered crispy chilli babycorn and chilli mushroom for starters. The babycorn was heavenly and portions were sufficient for five of us.Next was veg and pork steamed momos and only then did I realize why this place is famous for its dimsums. The pork momo was quite well with a large filling proportion which is quite a common complaint with other mono outlets. Next up was egg Cantonese chow,chicken fried rice and Singapore chicken. Singapore chicken was a bit less spicier as is normally expected of the dish. The chow and rice was really well cooked.
The plus point of this place is you get so much for so less ! We were completely full but it dint cost us proportionately high. 
A perfect place for giving away treats and college goers and oh-so-easy-on-your-pocket.
A happy place for happy people.
Definitely worth many more visits
Kudos :)

Found this place thanks to Zomato..or else would have never even known of the existence of the such a brilliant restaurant... We went there for some good food which is easy on the pocket and this place perfectly fits the bill..the ambience is very homely...you would be handed a huge menu...with all kinds of Tibetan, Nepali as well as the Chinese goodies... As it was quite late.. We ordered Mixed Chilli Garlic Chowmien and Pepper Chicken... The chowmein was loaded with chicken, egg and huge pieces of prawn (we ordered it without pork) and it smelt and tasted really good... The pepper chicken had the perfect Chinese flavour... not something made 'Chinese' deliberately like the other restaurants...the meal was fulfilling for the two of us and the bill was just 285!!! I would definitely visit this place again... And next time I waana have some great momos too...

Just the next building from our office and we order chinese from there every now and then.  But lately, the taste of the items are deteriorating. They dont taste as good as they used to. Only the momos, sapta, chillie pork and mensetse have managed to retain their original taste. The taste of cantonese chow, hakka chow, side dishes and soups have drastically deteriorated. Those who love momos or pot stickers should definitely visit there. But I cant say the same for other dishes.

Momos, mixed rice, pork curry, pork chilly! Please pork lovers, make it your moral duty to visit this place.¬†

I had visited this place in my early college days, and it still serves with the same deliciousness, the same homecoming aura.¬†

There can be absolutely no dispute over any of the dishes they prepared.¬†
Some day I will go to Sikkim and sacrifice everything for them.

Momos-top notch
Mixed fried rice-Dry, less spicy, no extra veggies that would interrupt smooth eating, meaty!!
Pork chilly- a different kind. Not the Indian chinese style. More like pork curry with a lot of gravy, but I bet if you're a pork fanatic, you will carelessly gulp it down.¬†

So much so that we ordered another plate of steamed pork momos after we were done with the main course, and at what price???? Sincerely not bothering.

Time for service- Don't bother. They will give you in a flash. even then, you don't mind waiting a few extra minutes for all the madness that's awaiting.

Even my extra quantity cautious girl shared two plates of mixed rice, two plates of pork momos and a plate of pork chilly. What better way to have lunch than The Blue Poppy way!!!

Writing about the blue poppy in Kolkata is a redundant act. I am actually surprised that till now I have not written about it. 

This is obviously a very famous place for soups and momos and thukpas, basically Tibetan food. I wont waste everyones time with this one cause almost everyone in Kolkata knows about this place and has been here. The d√©cor of this place is run down and it looks shady from time to time but then the food compensates for everything and anything they do or don‚Äôt. 

Don‚Äôt expect great service and a great seating. Rather expect awesome food attached to the cheapest prices. According to me th place si a spot where just call for momos and soups and enjoy them to the fullest. The momos are always fresh though I never understood how they manage that and they are big with full stuffing. The soup is also spot on in this place but a special mention to the thukpa which they make on eof the best in kolkata

Whenever I am in the area and a little hugry with 20 mins in hand I make sure to gorge on a plate of momos cause it is just that great.

Expenditure: 450 for 3 people

Ambience/Service : unless specifically given the directions, you'll perhaps never find this place. But somehow that doesn't prevent the crowd from pouring in at all times of the day ( cuz personally I have been subjected to waiting in the queue many a times). Located at the centre of the college/office circle, this place is the perfect hangout for ravenous pool looking for yummy quick bites.
The second floor of Sikkim House - the ambience is not too great. A bland set-up with hardly any decor. The sitting arrangement is rather shabby and the ketchup bottles have been in use for too long now. To be honest, hygiene is not one of their strong points but they make up for it in the food. Lastly, service is prompt owing to the waiting stream of customers.

What to Order: Momos, Phalay, Pork Shapta
Best momos in town. Nothing more, nothing less. The phalay which is a variation of the fried momo is also a favourite.

Went there on last Saturday 13th June 2015. The place is located in the business district. It was not hard to find the place. On Saturday night the place was full. We were lucky to get a table just on our arrival. 
The decor is nothing much to talk about. There are some Chinese and Buddhist wall hanging and the place was sufficiently lit up. 
Just as we ordered out starter a large crowd came in for dinner and all the attention went to them. The fried momo in chilli garlic sauce was absolutely absurd and the dish was cold. It's was just momo in tomato ketchup. When we asked the person about the dish he argued that the dish comes like this only and pointed his finger to a empty chilli garlic pot on the table and asked us to apply that to the momo. But by then we had finished our momo. After the momo we were in a fix whether to have our dinner there or not. However we stayed and ordered mixed thukpa. With the mixed thukpa came a lot full of chilli garlic sauce. We applied the sauce to our thukpa and it tasted awesome. The quantity was huge we share 2 bowl into 4. The  thukpa was full of meat and veggie and it tasted great. Next we ordered the mixed fried rice and chilli pork. The quantity was good. The mixed fried rice tasted very good. The chilli pork was also great. The chilli pork fish had chunks of veggies. The meat pieces were good but few pieces had excess fat. I feel Golden Dragon in Park Street serves better chilli pork. 
The best thing was, when we showed our interest to buy some chilli garlic sauce, they have us 2 packets of chilli garlic sauce as a complement. 
The place is good for hang out with friends and eat reasonably priced Chinese Tibetan Sikkimish, and Nepalese food. 
We had a mixed experience. The price was reasonable, ambiance was nice with a.c. but if you want much better taste but can sacrifice on the ambience and a.c you can visit Tibetan Delight near exide.

Very casual north eastern food...The homely category...just awesome...pork Momo should be one of the best in town, pork curry is awesome. I visited kolkata for last time and had food there for 3 times. It's like a hidden dragon. Try out Pork sapta,sallow fried momo, pork curry...awesome...possibly the best pork I have eaten. Expect a casual dinning and you will get a great fooding satisfection

The food is thoroughly enjoyable. The momos being the highlight of the menu. I cant begin to imagine how may plates of momos they must b making in one day, considered that my 6 yr old alone must've polished off 2 plates single handedly! And with8momos to a plate, that's 16!!!!! Besides the momos, we had ordered a bunch of stuff. The ones deserving a mention would the stir fried greens. These tasted surprisingly amazing! I also quite enjoyed a Burmese dish, the name of which escapes me right now, but it was essentially a soup made of potatoes, cheese and chilli. 
The rest of the food is good but not great.

A small restaurant in a good location serving amazing Chinese food. Personalised service by the lady at the reception taking orders and promptly getting the food served. 

If you are looking for a upmarket fine dining feel, this is not the place to be, but for an elaborate Chinese menu and quality food, rest assured you will love this place. 

Tends to become a little loud if full and with people waiting on your head for the table to be vacated. Very badly lit by tube lights gives a retro feeling of the joints of 90s. 

I am pretty happy if not ecstatic...

This place has been in my wishlist for quite sometime and finally I am able to cross it off the same. Serves great momos. Kothay momos are a must try. Noodles are good both quality ad quantity wise. Now the sweet lime soda could have been better. I have tried out their chilli pork and their pepper fish, the latter stands out in terms of taste. But the show-stopper has to be their Kothay momos. Another thing I feel is, if only there had been few more waiters as otherwise it becomes difficult when I am hungry and continuously asking for the menu card.

For every Momo fan like me, this place is a must visit! Located on the 1st Floor of Sikkim House, it's just a few minutes' walk from Maidan Metro Station. The food is really good and doesn't cost you much. I've visited the place quite a few times and everything I tried tasted great, except for Mixed American Chop Suey(which was kinda extra crispy and extra sweet) and Virgin Mojito( tasted like some kinda 50p wala lemon candy). Afternoons are always extra crowded but judging by the cost or the quality/quantity of food, it's worth the wait. 

Bottom line: A must visit for Momo and other Tibetan food lovers! :)

Awesome place. The momos are worth it. I am not a momo person at all and I have to say I really liked the Pan fried Pork Momo here. Service, ambiance and seating arrangements were upto the mark. A little difficult to find the place at first. The insides are decorated well with a nice quite environment. The food came at reasonable prices and in ample quantities. The hot garlic chicken was disappointing but the Mixed Fried Rice was quite great. The Virgin Mojito was good too though a bit highly priced. Definitely recommened place for a good meal with friends and family. I would definitely go back here when I can. 
JUST DON'T ORDER THE CHICKEN DISHES, THEY ARE CRAP. BTW I WISH THIS PLACE ACCEPTED CARDS TOO.

They serve one of the most delicious "melting in the mouth" steam n pan-fried momos in town and yeah I mean it. And if you are a momo-thukpa-freak, this is it. Another dish worth-mentioning is the Mushroom shapta and would use just one word for this, "killer" ! Reasonable price, freshness, the variety and authenticity make this joint a heaven for foodies.

N.B. I am not much of a pork fan myself but have heard about the lip-smacking chilli pork they serve ;)

Momo and pork fest!!

This outlet is situated on the 1st floor of sikkim house near maidan metro and definitely better than the other two outlets. Went there for the 1st time with high expectations and it did not disappoint at all. Variety of chinese, tibetian, nepalese and bhutani dishes are available and all are reasonably priced. AC dining with medium dining space is available, service is quick.

 We ordered chicken steam momo, chicken fried momo, panfried chicken momo in hot garlic sauce, chili pork dry 1plate each and 2 plates of dry chili chicken. The fried momos along with red hot chili paste are just too good!! That chili paste is so spicy, yumm!! Pan fried momo is good too. But the clear winner is the chili pork dry, awesome taste and quantity! Our total bill came rs 760 only for all these. So if you are in for some awesome chinese and tibetian items at reasonable prices then nothing beats this place. Will be visiting this place again to try their main course.

This joint is Cheap, fast and lip smacking delicious. I have tried almost everything on the menu. Ema dasi, Chilly Pork, Momos both steamed and fried, Pork kothays deserve a special mention. Also their mixed chopsuey is an amazing whole meal by itself. Absolutely worth the money !¬†

So come here and I promise you whatever you order be rest assured you will go back happily fed 9 times out of 10 !

went to this place with a friend for having some evening snacks. heard of this place a lot of times. the ambience was good. first we ordered steamed pork momos. it was awesome. i think this place is the destination of the best momo in the town. if u want to have the original taste of the momo you have to be here. then we ordered chicken fried rice and pepper chiken. the fried rice was average. but the chicken was a different one than the other chinese restaurants ¬†in town. it was well cooked with a combo of sweet and spicy taste. and the main plus point is that these good foods won't burn a hole in your pocket. it is very cheap. a nice place to hangout with groups. i recommend everyone should try the momo especially the pork momos here. if you are looking for chinese food with original taste and reasonable price this should be your destination.

Went to this place with my mom. Highly recommended as this place serves chinese food which actually tastes very close to what you get in restaurants in china and I can say this because I have been to Beijing and Singapore. The staff behavior is very customer friendly and polite. The ambiance is great and the main plus point is you will get good food and good quality and quantity which won't burn a hole in your pocket. We had Chicken Steamed Momos, Mixed Noodles Hakka and Garlic Chicken. The food was absolute great. The Garlic Chicken had a perfect sweet taste neither too much sweet nor too spicy as it should be. The momos are fabulous and the noodles are great. Highly recommended if you are looking for good Chinese food that wont cost you much.

This place came highly recommended and so one day after college me and my friends decided to give it a try. Can't speak for all but my visit has left me questioning the recommendations. Why? Well while the momos were really good the Chopsuey was really soggy. The pan fried momo stands out and delivers every expectations. However being a chinese food lover the chopsuey was a complete let down. The noodles were gluggy and the spread on top of it was really small in portion and asked for some aggressive seasoning. This being said , the Chinese food we are habituated to is only a deformed version and real chinese food is somewhat bland and lacking the heat. So I really speak for myself when I say I wont recommend the chopsuey but definitely the pan fried momos. Visit this place if you are an urdent momo lover.

Disclaimer: I love MOMOS.
And if you are in the same boat as me then go for it at The Blue Poppy. This branch of The Blue Poppy is located at Russell Street (the road opposite to vardaan market). It is basically the in-house restaurant of the Russel street branch of Sikkim House. It is probably their main branch due to its crowded ambience and a very loyal bunch of happy foodies turning up every other day. I have tried their steamed and chicken pan fried momos and I love both. I must admit that I am extremely strict about the sauces accompanying my plate of momos. If I order chicken steamed momos anywhere I always want the typical Chinese, super spicy, fiery red sauce accompanying it. Else my meal is incomplete. The normal ketchup or any other random sauce just doesn't cut in. Probably this is the best part of TBP which I love- their momo sauce is just amazing. Having said that, their pan fried tastes equally good (mind you they do not put any veggies in their gravy, its just light fried and sauce tossed). Their main course dishes are nice too and pretty popular amongst the foodies here. I have eaten both rice and noodles here accompanied by various chicken side dishes at different times. Price is very pocket friendly and Quantity has been more or less consistent. The service is nothing flashy but satisfactory.
Now, even though I love momos, I somehow do not like the authentic taste of Tibetan cuisine or even Tibetan style Chinese. So I generally do not order anything beyond the soups and momos here. For people who dig Tibetan cuisine, do give this place a try. Its more of a college hangout restaurant so you will often spot college students from the neighboring Loreto and St. Xavier's crowding the place.
I would, by all means, highly recommend this place to momo lovers.

Bon App√©tit

I think they serve the best momos in the city. No. In the country. Or maybe in the world. 100 bucks for a plate of pork momos and that's really worth it. I can never have enough of it. So always order a second  plate, after completing one whole sharing with a friend. But their chilli garlic noodles is okay. The clear soup, crispy chilli baby corn are yummm. A must visit for everyone who love pork momos. It's pocket friendly and serves good food. So, two-in-one. Just go and gulp momos. Go! Happy Dining! :)

Blue Poppy is a very well-known restaurant for its Tibetan and Chinese food. So well-known , in fact, that reaching at lunch would inevitably require you to wait in a queue. It's situated inside the Sikkim House, at decent walking distance from the Maidan metro station.
The restaurant is AC and average sized. The food mainly comprises of momos, shaptas, thukpas and noodles. The pork momos are very tasty! At 100 bucks they give 10 pieces. Most of their pork preparations are worth a try. The food is mostly on the spicier side. Though lemon chicken is bland. The pork thukpa I remember was very spicy, but delicious! It's unlike the usual Chinese we come across. However, the chow wasn't that great. Around 500 bucks is more than sufficient for a hearty meal for two people, making the good food experience easy on the pocket!

We sat in one of right sided table for four. For the first time we felt good.

Being a huge 'momo' fan, I decided to visit this place to try out some Tibetan delicacies. Its a small place located at Sikkim house....not very fancy. I ordered fried momo, pork thukpa and chicken gravy noodles. Momos were awesome, so was the noodles. Although I didn't like the taste of thukpa much...the pork was overcooked and it tasted quite bland. Overall I was happy with my experience and intend to visit this place again.....specially for its deliciously yumm momos ??

The tiny Sikkimese cherry-like red chillies that go in to make the extremely hot and spicy 'Dalle Chilli Paste' is what draws me back to The Blue Poppy, I've concluded! Nothing on earth can replace that taste; and nor will it go with any other perfect partner than momos!

Conventional tastebuds that I have, I wouldn't venture beyond ordering their absolutely out-of-this-world plateful of piping hot fried chicken momos (only chicken, and always fried, for me), which are just too divine for words, but only when accompanied by the Dalle Paste!

I haven't had anything else there and don't think I would either, as this is comfort food for me any season of the year! Their fried chicken momos with Dalle Paste are like a marriage made in heaven that I can sneak back to and celebrate, without any occasion - and even slyly all by myself, if I do not have company!

And yes, if you wash down this lethal combination with a chilled Pepsi, you can not only go ahead and order another plate, but also douse the fire that begins to burn inside!

We had to wait for a good one hour before we could get seats. Never before had I seen people crowding in front of an eatery in such large groups on a scorching summer afternoon. Actually we entered in the nick of time. The joint closes doors from 3 to 5 pm.¬†

But, it did not go in vain. The food we had was worth the wait. Coming to the ambience, its a decent sized place on the first floor of the building, with Dalai Lama quotes n other decorations adorning the walls. The waiters were congenial and were eager to suggest us.

And now the big show...yes the food! It was to die for. Pepper prawn and sweet and sour pork, will remember the taste for a long time to come. To be honest it was the best prawn delicacy I had ever. The sweet and sour pork was no less. Thick gravy, generous amount of pork (not too fatty)...... I wouldn't mind waiting again next time I hit this place. The mixed mefoon, however was not upto the mark. Neither taste nor quantity was anywhere closer to the other two items.

It is easy on the pocket and the items are quite cheap. Yes, am definitely paying them a visit again

Now this place is something different and exotic, well atleast to me.My main intention to go here was to eat some pork. I'd rather look at for a beef resto, but pork is close enough and this place did not disappoint. AT ALL.Quite huge portions. We tried the pork Manchurian (nice thin sliced pork pieces¬†with gravy), the sweet and sour pork (nice thin sliced pork pieces¬†with gravy), the fried pork momos, mixed phaktu noodle soup (min flat-like-blanket sized noodles in a beautiful, slightly thick, soup packed with prawns, chicken and pork) and a pork thukpa noodle soup (only pork).The Quantity, the Quality and the Price is absolutely remarkable.This is a small place in a building and it's packed (with waiting outside). The staff is superb as well !!This is a definite place to eat and try out some other type of food.

Blue Poppy is the Momo Cheat Sheet. The ambience can be improved significantly but if it's tough for you to think outside of food, this is the place. The Momos are light teamed up with spicy chutneys. The service won't disappoint. And, what else, they barely burn your pocket.
P.S. Vegetarians, don't be disheartened when your Non-Vegetarian friends tell you about those Pan Fried Chicken Momos. ;)

This used to be one of our favorite joint while we were in college. No place does it better than the blue poppy when comes to streaming hot and freshly made Tibetan food. 
One should try the streamed chicken Momo,pork Momo and thukpa and roasted chilli pork. 
It is the Momo heaven for Momo lovers ??

Elegant place the simplicity of which  may initially want you to underestimate it  but once the food arrives you become an avowed fan. The pan-fried momos in honey chilli sauce is to die for. Absolutely best place for good quality momos in Kolkata. Is easy on the pocket and affordable for students on a tight budget. Staff is pleasant and serves with a smile. Overall great experience and made me go there twice in one week just to have heavenly momos melt in my mouth!

A place that unites porkaholic cheapskates, upscale momo snobs and everyone in between. ¬†And for the depressed lot, try 'Chilli pork Tibetian style'.¬†There's no better way to lose your blues. Long live Blue Poppy!

... the fried rice was a bit different from the ones we get in very normal outlet . All items were good . The staff were too good . Moreover , this place is cheap & picket friendly . Do just don't hesitate to come down to this restaurant at Sikkim House .

My experince at The Blue Poppy has been quite mixed. In my two visits, I have tried their Pork Phaleys, Pork Chilli Garlic Fried Rice, Chilly Pork (dry), Chicken Steamed Momos, Chicken Sweet and Sour and Chicken Thukpa.
The phaley and momo, were disastrous. I didn't expect much from the phaley, but this place is apparently known for it's momos, and it really disappointed me. They were extremely floury and dry, the coating was very thick and there was absolutely no juice inside them. The phaleys were big in size but most of it was coating, there wasn't a lot of filling inside. I have had much better phaleys and momos at a much, much lower price. The thukpa had mixed reactions from us. At the beginning we found it very bland, but added salt and pepper and the different sauces on the table and turned it into something quite delicious. :9 The main courses were, however, a different story. The rice and the chilly pork were like a match made in heaven. They went perfectly with each other. There was a distinct hint of garlic and chilli in the rice which surprisingly did not overpower the pork. And the chilly pork is simply to die for. Highly recommended. The sweet and sour chicken again invoked mixed reaction. It had a slightly crunchy coating which we loved but the gravy was simply too sweet.
It's a really affordable place. I think that is their USP. The chilli garlic rice came at 120. I mean, where would you get food like that at such a low price? The waiters are real nice to you too, always serving with a smile on their face. Being a college student on a budget, I'm definitely coming back for more, hoping The Blue Poppy serves me better next time.

I heard about this place from a long time but didnt have a chance to visit it. So when last week I and my colleague both were craving delicious momo,we unanimously decided on this place. Blue poppy is located inside sikkim house near maidan jeevandeep and can be located quite easily. The interior of this restaurant is clean but it is decorated in a very ordinary manner. But their state of art lies in their culinary skills. Coming to food,the best thing about this place is definitely their momos. Inspite of some fancy momo joints around the city,it is always enjoyable to have the good old steamed momos and pan fried momos sometimes,and blue poppy surely makes you nostalgic. The momos here were delicious. We tried the pan fried chicken momos and their signature steamed momos and both were very tasty. The best part of their momos were that the outer covering of the momos were thin and soft and not at all thick and dry. The pan fried momos were good however I felt that the sauce consisted too much of tomato ketchup,giving it a bit too tangy taste. Among the other dishes we tried the pepper chicken and the mushroom shapta. The former was all right but the clear winner was definitely the later one. Mushroom shapta is basically a spicy starter in which mushroom are seared with onions and chillis and served. This dish just stole the whole show. The spicy and tangy taste of this dish was so perfect that we finished this dish voraciously. The place is extremely economical and pocket friendly. The price of the food items, I personally feel, are extremely low compared to the quality served. My experience in this place was terrific. I am surely going to visit this place numerous times in future....for trying out their other dishes and definitely the mushroom shapta....with

The blue poppy is located so securely that for a first time visitor like me it was quite a task to locate it. It's situated in the first floor of Tibet house and strangely doesn't have a sign board! Ambience is not much to boast of but its obvious that the food speaks volumes seeing the crowd in the small restaurant. 
Well other than that the food didn't dissapoint me at all. We ordered the famous chicken momos and along with it pork chilly pork schezuan and pork pan fried noodles. Yup it was a pork fest! Momos were average maybe coz I have had too many of them at too many places but it wasn't the stand out. Both the pork starters were definitely the star. Cooked well and seasoned perfectly, plus it didn't have extra greens which usually distract me from my meat. So that's a plus. Noodles were good and overall it was a satisfying meal.  Shall visit again to satisfy my pork cravings!

Finally got to try the Tibetan joint , The Blue Poppy . One of the few places in kolkata where you get decent chicken momos  . A serving of the dish consist if 8 pieces of momo and they are great to taste and also tried the chilli chicken  which was good too, but the quantity provided is less and will serve a single person.

As for the ambience of the place, its a dingy little place on the first floor of sikkim house and it gives out the feel as if your in a small hill station cafe without the the view .

All said and done the food is good and also serves pork meat (if your into that ).

Definitely visiting again for the momos.

This place is inside Sikkim house on the 1st floor in Middleton street. Wanted to try food there as heard from few that it was good. 

It's a small place with very average ambience. Nothing great about the sitting and interiors. Waiters are also not dressed up and not very much trained. 

Now comes the food part. It was way beyond my expectations. Tried 3-4 starters and was not good at all. You can get better food elsewhere in the same prices what they are charging. Really disappointed. Will not recommend to go out there.

The Blue Poppy has earned a name for itself for its lip smacking momos and it was great to be here for the first time.Definitely, its not going to be my last
This is going to be a vegan's review of the Blue Poppy.
We ordered the Veg fried momo and Veg wanton soup to begin with.I was having the fried momo for first time and it tasted good but failed to satiate my taste buds.However , the red chilly chutney that is served is hot and an absolute delight.[3.5/5]
The Wanton soup was incredibly tasty.The tender wantons in the clear spring onion dressed soup just left me wanting for more.Its a must try for those who crave for soups that are simple and lack the unnecessary dash of multiple spices.Its the ideal soup one can always have.[5/5]
Next we settled for a plate of veg chilli garlic meifoon and Stir fried veggies in garlic sauce.
The veg meifoon was a pleasant first experience and the thin rice noodles though filling are still light on your tummy.With a good helping of the wonderfully done stir fried veggies in awesome garlic sauce, it scored a perfect 5.
Its was an awesome lunch with the 2 bottles of Pepsi. And the greatest part is it doesn't even cost you a fortune.Highly affordable and good fast service even when all the tables were occupied left a great first impression on me.Am definitely coming back for more.
Its a must try for all Kolkatans who crave good affordable tibetan and Chinese food.

Blue Poppy is a true delight for enthusiastic foodies. Apart from the regular momo and soup spread, which is unavoidable, I highly recommend Pork Sapta, which is great as a starter. Located inside the Sikkim House, their ambience and the decor is very modest. So please don't expect anything fancy here when you are planning one. They only deal with serious taste buds.

After moving to Kolkata from Delhi, I was searching for those killer Pork momos like the ones you get in the Naga & Tibetan outlets in Delhi.. Blue Poppy offered what I needed to satiate my longing for those meaty & juicy dumpling.. It's a no nonsense place, straight to the point Come, relish the food & come again"..  Apart from the momos, even the Nepali non-veg thali is quite appetising. One need not shell out a hefty amount to have a complete & satisfying thali. 
The services at times can take a little time but then it's because of the rush. Been there many a times but I like being old fashioned; I order the same things!!

There is nothing much to talk about ambience.Thats pretty non existent.
The place is in the first floor of sikkim house,and it took me help to find this place out,but it was worth it.The food is very good.The momos are heavenly,especially when had with the fiery red sauce it comes with.Any momos are a must try in this place.

This is the place where I first hanged out with my college buddies. Was totally blown away by the pan fried chicken momos in garlic sauce. Chilli pork too was quite a stunner. As for noodles and fried rice, a bit more quantity per portion would have been much more desirable. If you are a pro, don't forget to order your pair of chopsticks. Meifoon and phalays did not impress me that much. Moreover the menu really lacked good desserts. However the price of the food is absolutely reasonable with no extra taxes tagging along with your cheque. The place is quite spacious but they could really work more on the interiors and the ambience. Overall an above average experience with pocket friendly good food.

Its my kalimpong friend, tanmay, in town. He insisted me to refresh the sikkim memories by treating me to the blue poppy at sikkim house. A small cozy place, where he loves the momo. Oh shit! The momo is here. 

Evra steam momo, evra fried aur evra cilly babycorn with slice, thats what he ordered.

And the steam momo is delicious. The cutney is very spicy though. I like it with ketchup. Fried momo i dont like so much.
Cillybaby corn is also very ordinary. I guess the place is famous for its steam momo. I give it a 3.

A relief place for pork lovers in the city. It is a lovely place to have some chinese food, specially pork items. Momo are good, different fried rice and noddles are also available with garlic fried rice being their best, another item that is quite good is pork garlic and manchurian they are real winner. 

Good food with good quality. Must try pork item with reasonable price list.

Putting this restaurant under "Great Momo's" is so justified. I so love this place. Simple ambience with authentic food. This is my first restaurant where I'd tried Pork Momo's and loved them to the core. You want Chinese? Blindly order.
Can go there anytime again for some Chinese. ;)

This place is located at Sikkim House, near Maidan metro and always has a queue of customers waiting for their turn for a table.
A queue outside a restaurant says how delicious their food is.
They serve the best Momos, and their Pan Fried Momoa and Wanton Soup are my personal favourites and I have at least one of them every time I visit the place.! They are not even pricey.!

Recently tried out pork kothay momo (steamed on top and pot fried bottom)  and chilli pork.  The kothay was really spicy and delicious. But, the chilli pork they served was overcooked because of which the meat became fibrous. But other than that, they have proved again that they serve the best momos in kolkata! 
====================================
Located at the Sikkim house (in walking distance from maidan metro station), this food joint serves one of the best momos i ever had in kolkata. Tried pork fried and pan fried chicken momo, both were utterly delicious. The sauce was authentic momo sauce, unbelievably hot and spicy. Will visit again!

In short this place is HEAVEN for food lovers like us. After searching in zomato me and my friend went in the early evening.
This place is always crowded. Luckily we got two seats. We have ordered for PAN FRIED PORK MOMOS, MIXED HAKKA NOODLES, SINGAPORE CHICKEN. My friend had tried pork for the first time and she liked it. I found that momos were perfectly fried and mixed in tangy sauce. It was too spicy and hot but we loved it.
Hakka noodles was aptly proportioned and full of eggs, shrimps, chicken and pork pieces. My friend found the the SINGAPORIAN CHICKEN too spicy but it was perfectly okay for my taste buds. 6pcs were there in one plate.
Our bill was 370
Pan Fried Pork Momos - 120
Mixed hakka noodles - 130
Singaporean Chicken - 120

Staffs were very kind and courteous. I will surely go back to try few more dishes. It is perfect place for college students like us. Low in pocket and great in tastes!!!!

By any standard, this is THE best momo house in Kolkata. Authentic and with no-fuss, this is the momo in its purest form. The restaurant is housed inside Sikkim House in Russell Street. Since it's govt run, you should be aware that service would be below average. 

But that doesn't really matter. Momos - chicken steam or pan-fried. But far more tasty are the pork momos which are awesome. Pork momos are also rare to find the city. 

Noodles are average, but the Thukpa is awesome. Another hit item is honey prawn (seasoned with sesame seeds). And if you like pork, just do not miss the Chilly Pork. Truly out-of-the-world.

Situated inside Sikkim House. Not very difficult to locate. A very popular eating place amongst students. The decor is kept simple and all the attention is paid to the mind blowing food they serve. Momo is something that one has to try here. Probably the best momo availaible in town.  Other things that is recommended is pork sapta, chow chow rice and the faley. The place is always high in demand. Light on the pocket. Treat yourself here if you are a big fan of momo.:-)

I really didn't know about this place until like a friend took me here. 
Ambience is soft and not much of godly(decorated) like other restaurants. 
The food is really awesome! 
Indeed they are one of the best in town for momos. 
Steamed, fried or pan fried, all variants of momos taste great. Even the the vegetable momo had a distinct flavour in the filling! 
I would definitely suggest this place to other people and every time I visit kolkata I'm giving it a visit. 
The price though is a little bit on the non pocket-friendly side but the quality of food just shadows it!

It is not have a large sitting area..The ambience is good for friends and family‚Ä¶The service time was fast, the food was cheap‚Ä¶

We had ordered:

Chicken Garlic Hakka Chow

Chicken Singapore

Chicken Sapta

The Momos are a must try for everyone..It was delicious‚Ä¶.The chow and chicken side dish was good‚Ä¶The chow was a bit spicy..

The Chicken Sapta was awesome‚Ä¶it is a must try..It‚Äôs their specialty‚Ä¶

I would like to visit the restaurant again for their other dishes..

Coming to the food....momos over here, be it steamed or fried are the best i have tasted :-) a plate comes with 8 juicy pieces. I have also tried the meifoon which is decently cooked. Very reasonable and no tax :-D

Had big expectations considering the rating and occasional word of mouth. But didn't  live up to the expectation. Thukpa was pretty ordinary and so was the chilly pork which is like the home favourite. But the quantity and prices are a big turn on I must say especially the pan fried pork momo which I thoroughly enjoyed. But the strangest thing was that the outlet didn't have a sign board or any directional guide . So ppl visiting for the first time may have some difficulty finding the place. May be it was a temporary thing but I hope they do something about it.. quick.

So, if you want to eat here, try to avoid the afternoon and early evening rush cause it's a famous joint in the area among the office-goers and specially the college students. You should totally try their pork dishes, in particular pork shapta and pork momos. Also, if you like spicy try the Ema Dasi. It's a very informal place, so you can just have a good time over good food.

Although I loved the earlier one. I liked the colorful holders for sauce. Coming to the food. Momos a must try. Steam or pan fried both are great.it makes u cry yet its worth it.tantalizes your taste buds..yummmmm.. The noodles are very nice too.a sumptuous meal.proper Chinese taste. And if u don't like spicy food u can go for food with white gravy.those are good too.waiters are friendly. Always wear a smile on their faces with a very polite tone.I quite like this place.reasonably cheap good food and nice ambience. U may think of it as a cheaper version of barbq.;)

everything starting from the dimsums to the noodles to the side dishes was above average but the place has a shabby appearance to it !!! 
no doubt food is good and quite reasonable and that's the reason why it is heavily crowded during lunch hours !!!

I had been to this joint couple of times now. And I am in love with them, came to know about this place from one of my friends who is very frequent at the Saltlake Blue Poppy branches. I love their Pork dishes, specially the chilli pork which goes very well with Bhuteko bhaat or noodles, also I absolutely loooove their shaptas! Oh man! They are one of a kind, so simple yet so unique. For starters do try their pork momos! And the big plus is the price.. yes they are just really cheap! But the owners or service are not so friendly which hurts i guess.

I have been to Blue Poppy earlier also and the fact that I returned means there must have been something to draw me to the place . To put it in two words -its warmth of the ¬†owner and the serving staff.¬†

FOOD: We ordered steamed Momos - both Veg and Chicken along with Chicken Thupka Soup for the 4 of us - me, my wife and my elderly parents. And followed it up with some Egg ¬†Meifoon and Chicken with vegetables in gravy. The order came in fairly quickly. The momos were soft and hot but I found the Veg Momos a bit dryish and not moist enough. Quite average . The Thukpa soup was nice and flavorful with adequate vegetables. The problem was that the chicken pieces were hard and rubbery which was a turnoff .This usually happens due to putting the raw pieces in stock without searing the chicken pieces so that the juices are sealed within. ¬†
The Egg Meifoon was an utter dispppointment with burnt egg omelette and the rice noodles were raw . We had to send back the dish . To the credit of the server, he promptly replaced it with a Egg Hakka Noodles which were decent .¬†

PLUS POINTS IN FOOD: ¬† The Chicken Momos were very good . The Thukpa was good and so was the Chicken with mixed veg and the Hakka Noodles were also above average.¬†

PLACES OF IMPROVEMENT:¬†
1. Meifoon needs to be seriously looked into.¬†
2. The Veg Momos need to be improved. Incidentally - both veg and chicken Momos had the same shape and design - which could mean that by mistake they could get mixed up and land at the wrong table¬†
3. CLEANLINESS: The lift entrance was blocked with sacks of flour and my mother wo was on a wheel chair could not come out till we called the staff to remove the sacks of flour .¬†
4. Dirty broken chairs and other pieces of furniture are lying outside the restaurant.¬†
5. SOUP BOWLS were scratched and dirty and need to be changed pronto¬†
6. Their is no provision for a wheel chair bound person to reach the restaurant . The staircase on ground floor needs to have a ramp to enable wheelchairs to navigate the same.¬†

COST: Very reasonable . 4 of us had a decent meal for 780/-¬†

CONCLUSION: Would love to revisit.

The first thing that you notice is just how crowded this is. It has a constant stream of customers, mostly in the young, college-going age-group. The restaurant itself is very simple in decor, and as with all good restaurants, the smell of delicious food is what hits your nose as soon as you enter it. We had momos, prawns and chicken, all of which were delicious. Must try with in Kolkata!

I have been there twice..Had momos and thupka. The taste is good but didn't find it to be that special..Would have given more points if soup was served with momos. Also three of us went...we asked for a plate and had to wait for 45 minutes to get the plate despite requesting several times. But it is okay....I guess it was too crowded and so they couldn't pay much attention.

If you are looking for authentic Himalayan cuisine starting right from Tibetan to Nepalese to Bhutanese... then I bet this is the place to be. I have been quite a number of times over here and I must admit that on every visit, I have ended up overeaten, simply because of the food taste. Momos are their speciality and I loved the fried one over the steamed one. No soup is served with it. However, there is a chutney in each table which is the best condiment with it... but beware... it is tooooooo hot.... Also liked the mixed men tse tse along with chicken shapta... all the items were just treat to the taste buds. Service is moderately fast, though the ambience is ordinary. Special note : there is always a queue for the table during lunch for most of the days. Should keep time in hand for the same (average 20 minutes)

The Blue poppy,simply,Mecca of Momo lovers in Kolkata. Located at Little Russell street,on the 1st floor of the Sikkim house,its my favourite after sports/evening relaxing/catching up with friends hangout.You enter to find about 12 tables,seats around 50+ people.The non veg steamed Momos are the piece De resistance. They give you excellent Momo soup as well(only non veg). The pan fried and fried Momos are amazing too, along with the chilly pork,which is amazing to have on a winter day.They serve Chinese food as well,portions are generous and the prices are easy on the pocket. Crispy baby corn is a nice dish,although a bit more crispy would be nice.Smiling waiters and owner, and a warm ambience wants you to re visit this place.

Located on Middleton Row , on the 1st floor of The Sikkim House , 5 mins away from the Maidan Metro station , this joint serves great food at pocket friendly price. They serve a variety of cuisine like Bhutanese,Tibetan , Nepali , Chinese etc. Me and my friends ordered CHICKEN HOT AND SOUR SOUP and PAN FRIED CHICKEN MOMO IN GARLIC SAUCE for starters . The soup wasnt thick enough but it tasted just fine. The momos were good , but seemed to be dipped in excess of tomato sauce . Then we ordered MIXED CHILLI GARLIC RICE , MIXED NOODLES , CHILLI CHICKEN and CHICKEN SHAPTA for main course. The shapta was great and one must give it a try. Overall food was great and it cost us only Rs. 200 per head.

Today we opted to go to this place and it was worth it. This place can be very easily located, take metro and get down at maidan, Take right turn at jeevandeep building and you will get there within 5mins. When we reached it was full, but we did not have to wait long. It was a nice place, I am not saying the ambience was awesome but it was OK, but don't worry it will be compensated by the taste of food. We were 2 and we ordered chicken Thai soup, fried chckn momo, mixed chilli garlic chow without pork(as we don't eat pork) and chicken sapta(it is dry and spicy, highly recommended for those who love spicyyyyyy food) and all the food were equally good in taste and good in quantity and we had all this food only for Rs.480 as they don't charge tax so it is also very pocket friendly. The staffs were very quick in service. So whenever we opt for Chinese, we will surely visit this place.

We love to hang out at The Blue Poppy because it's like this open secret spot if you have a thing for delicious cuisines like Momo, Thukpa, Pork Chilly etc. On the 1st floor of Sikkim House, this quiet little joint is run well by North-eastern staff majorly. Fluent Nepali speaking guy like me would have even more reason to visit frequently. Yes, it does lack a bit on d√©cor and dingy washroom is a let down. But, don't get busy complaining and order all the dishes as pocket pinch is tolerable. Take away is available. Simply put, it's more like the aunty-run college canteen of Tadong in a more posh setting. Go for it!

For me, they make the BEST momos in kolkata. Be it fried, or steamed. Even the pork one's are yum. I would recommend the fried momos. Their noodle soup is also good, though nothing special. A plate has 8 pretty big pieces of momo.You might have to wait a lil to get a table as the place is always crowded. They open at 12:30. It is located inside Sikkim house. Second floor.

The ambiance is very homely and simplicity reflects in every bit of the work they do. I ordered Vegetarian and Chicken Momos along with Green Apple Soda. Both, The veg and chicken Momos were perfectly made - mildly spiced along with the flavor of ginger and garlic shining out bright! The chicken momos are the Best I've had in India, till date. Green apple soda is really good too - better than the regular soft drinks we get, should try.

Other than these, I also ordered the Pan Fried Chicken Momos which were remarkably great. You must order this one if you love spicy Ginger, Red Chillies and Garlic sauce they top it with. But mind you the spice meter is really high about 4.5/5!

Service: 4/5

Ambiance: 4/5

I have visited several times to that region but never had a clue that it existed in that place. The moment I have heard about it, I along with a very close freind of mine gave a visit at that place. Well to be frank at a first glance the place looked nice. Not very much decorated but sober. Our main purpose to visit that place was because of momo. So we ordered a steamed chicken momo along with chicken mushroom soup, chicken fried rice, chicken noodles and hong-kong chicken. To be honest the momo was good but not as i expected. I mean the momo tasted good but i have had better than this. The taste was unable to level with its reputation that it posses. Although i liked the rice the most. The soup & the chicken was also good, but what really disappointed us was the noodles. We were regretting about that particular item. Asked to suggest some spicy side dish & hong kong chicken was suggested by them. But that was not at all spicy. But still tasted good. Well the first impression is important. Though i didn't  get the best one still hoping to have that in the next visit with some more expectation, but don't know whether that will be the last one or not. But i really appreciate that, the cost of the food was moderate, and was really pleased by their hospitality.

Found out this place after a bit of a hassle one winter afternoon. You have to take the gate no 2 of Maidan metro, and then ask around for Sikkim House. The restaurant is on the 1st floor. However, coming to the food. For starters we tried the pan fried pork momo, and ema datshi. Food arrived within about 10 minutes. They have 8 momos in a plate, and they're heavenly in short. Crispy and cooked to perfection, a generous amount of filling inside, and the HOT garlic sauce; an absolute delight. The ema datshi is a bowl of melted cheese with chilies and some seasoning inside, and well, you can never go wrong with cheese. Works wonders as a side dip throughout the meal. For main course, we had mixed meifoon, chilly pork, and pork shapta; with virgin mojito to wash it down. We were considering ordering two noodles for the two of us, since about food none of us is weak hearted, but our waiter strongly suggested against it, saying it'd be too much, and he was absolutely right. ¬†Meifoon was alright, though personally I'd prefer it a bit less oily. The pork items were undoubtedly one of the best in the city. I liked the dry chilly pork better, crispy and a little burnt, bursting with flavors. Dipped in the cheesy emma datshi, you'll feel like the foodie inside you died and went to heaven. The virgin mojito however, was not made with mint leaves as I expected, but an artificial mint flavor. That still tasted good though, and wasn't really a letdown since our purpose for visiting the place was not an authentic virgin mojito. Quantity wise food is great, a plate of momo, one rice/noodles and one side dish is more than enough for two people. We actually over ordered, and had to pack some leftovers home. They were very helpful about that bit too, where most other little places do not entertain such request. A very fine and relishing meal this was. If they would just keep a couple scoops of ice cream for the sweet toothed people, there'd really be nothing more to ask.

I tried all kinds of momos here and i have to admit that they are extremely good with momos. But the only problem you would find here is that by the time you are served the soup, you realize that you are already done with the delicious momos. So that is annoying. Hence their service should improve.

Vo Oooooooo amazing momos fell in love with pan fried veg Momo the day I visited this place.... Till that day I was not much interested in momos..... Their extra spicy chutneys goo really well with those momos... 
Not much variety in veg but lots n lots of options in non veg.... Very very reasonably priced menu... No tax either.... Gud decent place..... Sometimes over crowded with skul students in the afternoon so will have to share your table.... Bt not a problem for such lovely foods at such a price... There moktails r also reasonably gud...

An excellent and spacious restaurant. A nice place to hang out with a small group of friends. Food delivery is fast. And the food is excellent at a very reasonable price. I would say it is cheaper than most Chinese restaurants. And there are no hidden costs. The busboys and waiters are friendly too. People often have to wait outside because of the high number of footfalls in the restaurant. It's famous for its pork service.

A good and pocket friendly restaurant for good Tibetan and Chinese food... The staffs are very humble and well mannered... The only thing you should keep in mind is that do visit the restaurant before 4pm because it closes for 5-6pm and if you visit the restaurant after 4pm then Momo will be the only dish available for you...

The restaurant is just a few minutes walk from the Maidan Metro Station ( Gate No. 2-Jeevandeep). Its located on the first floor of the Sikkim House and has an ample space to fit in 10-12 medium sized tables. We ordered a few glasses of Virgin Mojito to get started. They were very refreshing and light. Then we ordered Pan fried chicken momo in hot garlic sauce, Chicken American chopsuey, Chilli and garlic rice, Pepper chicken for the main course. And then came the delight! I was very impressed with all the preparations except the chopsuey which tasted bland and overcooked. ¬†One of my friends said that the Saltlake counterpart makes better chopsuey. The rice was the best of the lot. Service was very prompt. The ambiance was nice too. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.

A quick meal of pan fried veg momos with hot garlic sauce and veg chilli garlic noodles at this humble outlet of nepalese,bhutanese and chinese food.
Pan fried momos was smeared with this extra sweet sauce which absolutely killed the taste and made it soggy.Either they should give the sauce separately or give less of it.the filling of onions was fresh and nice.

On the other the chilli garlic noodles was just yum..full of veggies unlike most other restaurants..where it is served without veggies.It was quite yum.This place reminded me of my hostel canteen with better hygeine and chilled air conditioner.
Next time i would prefer calling in the food home and would want to try the steamed dumplings.
Absolutely paisa vasool place when it comes to pricing and tax free too.

I had the panfried chicken momo in garlic sauce and it was really good. I would like to recommend the golden fried prawns to everyone. Not the best looking dish but it tasted heavenly. Their food is very filling and comes at a very reasonable price too. I intend to come back here soon and try more out of their menu.

Since this place is close to my Office, I frequently keep sending someone to get a nashe... I visited the place for the first time on Mahashaptami evening. My colleague & I. Started off with Pork Momos. For the Main Course we ordered American Chopsuey, Chilly Pork dry and  Mixed Fried Rice . The Momos were fabulous.. It had that original Tibetian taste... Otherwise what we generally get around is the local version of Momos that are awfully big and over stuffed & have tomato sauce mixed with the chilly paste... I felt really really good after having Momos here.. Pork is my favourite meat and I was so relieved to see that they actually knee how to cook it.. Wherever I eaten Pork in Kolkata, it's either over cooked or under cooked... I was so happy that I'd ordered a Pork dish @The Blue Poppy.. The ambiance is so-so but the service is damn quick and the costs doesn't pinch your pocket... With such awesome food and quick service, who is bothered about the ambience... The food has all your attention :)  :)

Ordered chili gralic rice, chicken sapta, hakka chow and dews. The rice and chow were delicious and perfectly cooked. Though the chicken pieces of sapta were stiff and a bit hard to chew but it tasted good. Overall I liked the place a lot. Will try to visit again when im in maidan area... :)

This one is located inside the Sikkim house near Vardaan market and serves one of the best Tibetan food in Kolkata.. Ambience is quite good.. the place is dimly lit.. It is a very popular joint and for this get ready to wait for a long time during lunch hours specially. They serve the best ever steamed momos in Kolkata whether it is chicken or pork. Another hot favourite is the Pork shapta.. it is spicy as hell with loads of red chillies so people who cant tolerate heat in their food should avoid dis but it is damn good in taste. Liked the thukpas too.. very filling and yummy. In chinese, their chilli garlic fried rice and spicy fish with vegetables are good options..

Well. Mixed review of this place. Tried the Pan fried chicken momos and trust me, they were BAD as in baad. It was like, the momos had simply been doused in tomato ketchup and served. It was sugary sweet. And this too, after having asked them to make it spicier while ordering. Again, when we told them about it, they added a bit of chilly flakes and served us. Sadly, taste remained much the same. Next up was the Veg chilly garlic noodles,  and boy, was it wonderful!  It had distinct flavours and was tasty. The chilly garlic rice with mushrooms was much the same. But the Singapore Chicken was the absolute show stealer. Succulent pieces if chicken in a smoky gravy of bell peppers and red chillies. .. it was amazinnggg. Can still taste it :D would have loved to rate it higher, but the pan fried momos were such a downer. :/

Finally my wishlist comes true. Its truly one of the nearest , cheapest and greatest food joint that is near to our college. And I cannot imagine how I have not visited this as of yet. And finally I did make a move and reached sikkim house in russel street. Climbed up the stairs and there I was outside blue poppy.  It was around 3 30 pm and it was a super peak time at sikkim house. So we decided to go and wait for our turn to come. Waiting outside for 15 minutes I could smell the hot and delicious odour of momos. I was dying outside, cribbing with hunger. When suddenly we were called in. The decor was done wid mat all over the windows and colourful chandeliers gave the restro a very spiritual feel. A faint music or a chant could be added to create the ambience.  Surfed through the menu. My friend told me to go in for the veg momo. I preferred a pork momo. But she insisted we should take it as she knew it tasted great. We ordered and genuinely it tasted heavenly. I cannot imaginr veg momos could ever be so tasty. 8 in number per plate. Enough to feed the hungry dragon in your stomach. But what I felt bad is they should have given a soup along with the veg momo. Then we order for a mixed thukpa. And a chilli mushroom. As my frnd was totally into this "veggie affair" . Another thumbs up. The chilli mushroom.  The spicy and hot mushroom with soy sauces all over and the befitting smoky taste of the iron wok could just any one crave for more and more. But the number of pieces being 5 was too less for two people to share. The mixed thukpa was however satisfactory. I would highly recommend the blue poppy for its vivid tibetian dishes. Though we tried limited. We tasted it in the salt lake outlet. Please do visit the russel street one. Its even better.

I would not suggest the pan fried Momos. The steamed are good enough. Have to go there more than once :)

One of the best momo places in town. This place is pocket friendly and conveniently located. I go there mainly for momos and have had times when I have ordered 3 plates of only momos. It has never disappointed me. Portion size is good and is an idle joint for quick bite since they have a fast service.
What I don't like about this place is that it remains closed between 3 pm- 5 pm. So if you area around the corner in Camac streetshopping till late afternoon and plan to grab a quick bite, this is not the place to rely on.
Go there for the momos, thukpa & noodle soups! Bon appetit

Well, well well heard a lot about this place, finally visited and realized why they are one of the best momo joints in kolkata. Situated on the 1st floor of the Russel street Sikkim House. A nice simple decorated restaurant, full of customers coming and going you need not to sit for a long time. Busy staffs, once you have finished food just pay the bill and walk such attitude reflects in their behavior hence service is pretty fast. Anyways you don't need a plenty time to finish your food cause they are really tasty.

No doubt they serve authentic Nepalese and Tibetan cuisine and indo-chinese foods. tried chicken steam momo and pan fried chicken momos wow simply superb served with clear chicken soup. They use excess tomato sauce in the pan fired momos so that tastes little sweeter not fiery hot. Next, Pork kothey's wow amezing. One of the major difference of their momo's are, they are typically Nepalese momos, a little oily stuffing. liked it. In the main course only tried their mixed Hakka noodles, it was tasty full of chicken,pork,egg and prawns. Virgin Mojito as a drink was also pretty good.

Overall pretty much impressed. And after having all this just paid 560 rupees. Means pocket friendly. Didn't tasted their thupka heard a lot about it. Next time Thupka for sure !! Cheers Blue Poppy !!

I was introduced to this place by my Bestie and i just instantly fell in love with these place. Mainly because it makes us understand the difference between Nepale,Bhutanese, Tibetan and Chinese food. Warning for those people who are habituated in having food in luxurious and picturusque joints, this place in the contrary is the humblest and simplest place i have ever been to with only weapon to bring you back to this place is the taste of its food.¬†
Foods I like:
1) Pork Curry: Its flavours is just ready to explode in your mouth. it has the Distinct flaopur of Star Anas which gives iot a divine twist. (Have it with Plain rice)
2)Pork Shapta: Another pork favourite of mine. this one is an authentic Tibetan Dish....One of the best Pork Dishes of all times.
3)Garlic Fish
4)Pan Fried Pork Momos In Garlic Sauce

I can say it from the top of a mountain if someone wants. THERE AIN'T ANY PLACE IN CALCUTTA THAT SERVES BETTER MOMO THAN BLUE POPPY.
Well, that said and done, what more can I say?
This AMAZING little place serves the best pan fried/steamed momo in this city. The thukpa is just amazing. Even the chinese dishes are mouth-watering.
The quantity is great! Honestly, everytime I go to Blue Poppy with my mom, we end up packing half of the food.¬†
The behaviour of the staff is great too.
I only wish they delivered. :(
Other than that tiny glitch, this place is just too nice. :)

Starting with the good food and good quantity, this place caters is low cost delicious Chinese dishes. Good hospitality,ambience and specially the dishes make me visit this place again and again. It has another branch near CC1 but this particular branch in sikkim house in Russel street, runs the best. U'll feel good about this place and so I recommend my friends to come to dis one especially. My favourite dish being any pork dishes and mojito. Its the only restaurant where I have pork since it cooks beautifully.
In short,  its a #MUST Go from me. \cheers/

Famous for the cuisine that they offer Blue Poppy serves amazing steamed Momos.  I'd come here often after college or during college breaks. 
The huge queues that one witnesses during lunch hours speaks volumes about the "fans" this place has earned over the years.
I have tried their noodles n rice too however nothing beats my love for their Momos. 5 stars for that one item.

So, I visited this restaurant during April with 3 of my friends. The restaurant was close to the Sikkim House. The inside of the restaurant was clean and the seating arrangements were fine. We ordered the pan fried pork momos in garlic sauce and two phalays (we couldn't pronounce it properly to the waiter). The food was nice and the service was quite quick. We loved the eating environment. Nothing fancy, just simple and clean. I loved the momos but one of my friends couldn't handle its spicy nature. It depends on how much you like your food spicy. I'd say, it was okay-ish. The phalays were nice to eat too. The food was cheap too. I'd definitely recommend this to my followers.

Blue Poppy, SIKKIM HOUSE, Kolkata

When asking about new Ghama joints in Kolkata, my nephew Toto was quick to inspire us to visit the Sikkim House, Blue Poppy for a lunch of Momos and Thukpa. Poor chap was down with jaundice and hence could not accompany us. For all the jamai aador ( Food lovingly made for the son in law) my poor wife was grossly neglected. So this was my treat for her to compensate for all that I got in the last 5 days in Kolkata. The menu for both of us would be dedicated to my wife‚Äôs choice of items. With a slight difficulty we found Sikkim House and smelt our way upstairs to the quintessential Blue Poppy , the ultimate sikkimese joint for sumptuous momos in Kolkata.

Entering we found it quite crowded with romantic pairs grabbing cheap sumptuous lunch as well as corporate teams in groups . There was a bunch of north indian friends grabbing the full Thali lunch available at the Blue Poppy. The place was cosy with efficient waiters (only 2) moving around with a purpose. The joint had a cheap Chinese d√©cor with a couple of Chinese if not Tibetian paintings, broad tables, melamine plates and bowls and stiff chairs. 

The menu card was exotically Sikkimese/tibetian and interesting. We asked the waiter for help and ordered the Pan fried Pork Momos in Garlic sauce at Rs.120/- for 10 pieces ( or was it 8 pieces) , One plate of Chicken steamed Momos at Rs100/- for 10 pieces and one plate of Pork Momos at Rs.100/- for 10 pieces. Great thing about the place is the timing of serving and the quantity of serving. First the Pan fried Pork Momos in Garlic sauce arrived, hot and spicy red. I gobbled 2 and was whimpering due to the chilli heat. The waiter suggested Masala Coke to cure the tongue burn ( which I thought was absurd) as masala would help kill the chilli heat to be wiped away from the memory of my tongue by the cold coke. The wife went generous with the sauce whilst I concentrated on the momo. The momos were crisply fried, pork well minced and steamed before stuffing in the momo. The garlic sauce was out of the world but too spicy for me. Next came the steamed chicken momos well steamed to perfection, chicken well minced and cooked in the stuffing and the flour of the momo outer covering well steamed and chewy. Good eaten hot otherwise the momo becomes a bit chewy. The Pork steamed momo was as well cooked to perfection, well steamed. Then we ordered a veg Thukpa of half a bowl each at Rs.100/- along with Pork Shapta Rs150/- per plate. The Thukpa was invigorating and clear with noodles and carrots and a leafy vegetable. Tasty, hint of chilli but yet watery and hot was the Thukpa. The shapta was pork sliced and cooked with spring onions with a slight hint of chilli. We ate till we dropped ! Loved everything about the taste, wholesomeness of the chicken and pork and subtlety of Sikkimese cuisine.

Loved the hospitality, cost and cuisine, will visit the joint every time I visit Kolkata, for sure!!!

Ambience ‚Äì 7/10 cosy

Menu ‚Äì 9/10 

Taste ‚Äì 9/10 Superb flavours and subtle too 

Customer Service ‚Äì 9/10 smart waiters   

Value for Money ‚Äì 10/10 Excellent

Although it is near my college, I did not know about this place until a few ago and I've been frequenting this place ever since. People say it has the best momo in the city, and it probably is correct. Pork steamed momos were very juicy and soft and very well done. The pepper chicken was just lovely, treat to the taste buds. Although it is the pork shyapta that'll make me come back here again and again, it is amazing. It is a must for somebody visiting for the first time. Pork Meifoon and Hot Garlic Pork were pretty amazing too. According to my friend, the thukpa was good, but I personally do not like thukpa so I cannot judge. The pan fried momos need work, as the gravy is not up to the mark.
But on the whole, it was an amazing experience. You cannot expect much in terms of ambiance but the place has a homely feel to it and the staff is friendly. It is a good place to hog after a hectic day at college and it's quite friendly on the pocket.

Although we faced a tad difficulty to find this place, but their mouth watering Chinese offerings made us forget that almost immediately. We visited this pocket friendly Chinese joint twice and both the times we returned with an urge of coming back asap. We had on our first visit, Chicken Thai soup, Chicken Meifoon( Rice Noodles) and Peeper chicken. Each and every preparation was outclassing each other. On another occasion, we tried their Chicken Mushroom soup, Mixed Fried Rice and Singapore chicken. At the end of our meal, we craved for more of these delicacies.
Talking about the ambiance, it does not offer any extravagant indoor and kept it simple but elegant. They surely have paid more attention to the food than decor.

Today I went there with my friend for lunch. This was my regular destination when I was posted in Middleton Row office. If you want cheap yet satisfying lunch, this place was ideal. Service was always friendly with lively ambiance. We started with their ‚ÄòPan Fried Pork Momo in Hot Garlic Sauce‚Äô followed by ‚ÄòGreen Apple Soda‚Äô & ‚ÄòVirgin Mojito‚Äô. Pan fried pork momo in hot garlic sauce looks awesome but while eating I found they used too much tomato sauce and it taste bit sweet. Sorry to say I don‚Äôt like that at all. I immediately inform our server that this was not traditional hot garlic sauce. The server apologies and said that they mix tomato ketchup in hot garlic sauce and if we want he can change the dish. But as we have already eaten half portion, we decided to continue. Green Apple Soda was very average but Virgin Mojito tasted awesome. Then we ordered ‚ÄòChicken Phalay‚Äô to remove the sweetness of tomato ketchup from our tongue. Chicken Phalay tasted really good, crunchy outside and soft, juicy inside. For main course we opted for ‚ÄòPork Nepali Thali‚Äô. Pork Nepali Thali contains ‚ÄòSteamed Rice‚Äô, ‚Äò2 Types of Veg Items‚Äô, ‚ÄòGundruk‚Äô, ‚ÄòKinema‚Äô, ‚ÄòPork Curry (4 Pcs)‚Äô, ‚ÄòPapad‚Äô and ‚ÄòSalad‚Äô. Thali was pretty good especially pork curry, it just melted in our mouth. I don‚Äôt like the nepali dal in the thali, because of its strong flavour.  After finishing the thali my friend was full but I can still felt my hunger. I ordered ‚ÄòPork Shapta‚Äô, which was really well cooked. It captured my taste buds and held them captive.  That alone will bring us back for another visit to dine.

Location: Sikkim House, Russell Street. 

Have visited this outlet quite a few times and the experience wasn't that great as compared to it's former outlet in Saltlake. 
(Reviewed earlier) 

Coming straight to the point, 

Veg Steamed Momos 
Filling was great and the momos were perfectly steamed. 

Veg Thukpa 
Flat noodles served with stock and veggies. 
Was super delicious! 
I even took a parcel away. :-P 

Veg Panfried Momos 
They were a turnoff.¬† 
The sauce in which they were tossed wasn't flavorful.¬†:-\ 
Low on salt and spices. 
I couldn't give it another try, so ain't concrete on my comment.¬† 
Wish to try it once more for an unbiased say. 

Fried Momos 
They were disgusting. 
Dripping oil as you cut through.¬† 
Felt as if the momos were served with an oil-filling! 
Turn off. 

The momo sauce wasn't spicy and was low on salt as compared to the former outlet and other Tibetan serving joints. 

The staff was efficient, but were no ears to the complaints! 
"This is how it's prepared", is what they have as a say. 
As if we customers are having the cuisine for the first time. 

Prices were pocket-friendly,¬†but felt like a pinch thanks to the "great preparations and staff treatment". 

Overall an average experience. 
Two and a half stars from me, 0.5 extra just for the delicious Thukpa.

One of my favorite restaurant for Chinese food . It was life saving place for me when I was in St.Xavier's college in midst of all the costly restaurants of Park Street. You will never guess looking at the building of Sikkim house that there is such an yummy food place.
I loved the Momo platter and always ordered Chicken Hakka Chowmein with Chicken black pepper. Nothing too much ..or too less in taste. Its perfect . Service is great, The staffs are extremely friendly and the food is always within your budget because of No-tax . Enjoy your food there :)

This place is my old favorite for their amazing authentic Tibetan food.I am absolutely in love with their Mixed Thukpa, Steamed Momo, Kotheyes and all the dry pork delicacies they offer. Their Nepali and Bhutani thali is also good.
I have a feeling that if i am not fit means having cold , running nostrils and fever if i have their  mixed thukpa i"ll be alright. if you ask me why .... you know the dish is totally... like a 100%  healthy one dish meal, all the fresh veggies, shrimps, chicken and pork (I asked them to not put pork with fat and they sweetly agreed)  in a light flavorful broth which instantly gives me all that energy I need and to add that super hot red chilly Sauce all the cold and cough in my body even out with the hotness of that sauce.
The quality of food id the same in all their outlets.

Very good food fr very less price.
This place is highly recommended.

This is a place that draws no parallel, no words minced here.

It draws however, large crowds on weekdays & weekends alike. And the reason behind the same is easily ostensible.

Where else in the midst of the hustle& bustle of Park street and Camac street would you get authentic Chinese fare at jaw- dropping low rates?And this is an air- conditioned set- up, mind you, with the ambiance being pretty decent. Indeed, you get chicken& fish side dishes here for as low as Rs. 90, while the other rice& chow dishes are pretty easy on the pocket too. The excellence of their momos need no reiteration, while they also serve up a mean chopsuey with a wonderful poached egg on top to boot. Quantity wise, there isn't any room for sulking, nor would the taste of the dishes disappoint you. I however do think that they can pay more attention towards the freshness of the fish they use in their dishes. Otherwise, everything else is hunky- dory. Yes, this isn't quite the place for fine- dining with your family or partner on a special occasion, but there are several other reasons in place for you to barge in on any given day.
The crowds that throng the place every afternoon& evening is self- explanatory... People love the place, not only for the lip- smacking food on offer but also for the pocket- friendliness of it all. You don't always have to shell out a 1000 rupee note for a good Chinese meal for two at Park street. If you are low on capital& craving for sumptuous Chinese food, look no further than this humble yet adorable joint at Sikkim House!

Once you hear so many and read so much good things about a place then it's hard to not expect big things from there. This's exactly what happened with me on last to last Sunday.
 Yes on a hot hot Sunday afternoon when the Sun was at its scorching best we went there with heart full of expectations and stomach full of hunger. First thing it's not an easy place to find if you are going first time there. It is always advisable to have a good navigation system (which I had) with you. After reaching there we got our seat instantly, rather I should say that we helped us to our seat as there were no one to receive us or to help us. The ambiance of that place will certainly not impress you. I had the misfortune to visit their washroom once. It was certainly grossy  and total messed up. Yaaaak... 
Anyway we noticed that people were starting to fill up the place quickly as a few of them were waiting outside also. Lucky, we were!! We ordered Steamed Chicken Momo, Egg-Chicken Fried Rice, Singapore Chicken and two soft drinks. Taste was certainly good, not overwhelming but good. Although it was spicy and hot...Really hot. 
They served us our food bill even before we finished our plate!! Rush Hour... We understood that they were indirectly forcing us to vacate our table. Finish your food, pay your bill and get out...!! Simple. 
But I must admit that the biggest shock was the bill. Only 380 Rupees!! This is the USP of this place. You won't get such food anywhere in Kolkata in this price. Good place to eat if you want to save your wallet. Best Value for Money Place in Kolkata. Nothing Special other than this. 

P.S. - If you are going there in pick hours like lunch time or dinner time, advance reservation recommended.

The Blue Poppy has many branches though , but this is near the Maidan metro station, inside the Sikkim House.
Well, the food is great.
I really love the pork and chicken dishes out there.
The price is reasonable and its quiet difficult to finish your food as they give at a large quantity.
Momos are great too.
There are funky paper lamps too .
Delicious food and great service.

I went to this place last week. Though I have always had good reviews about about this place, but I was really embarrassed when I took a close friend of mine to try out their Thukpa and chili pork. The thukpa, in a weird way, had a "detergent-ish" aroma. I thought I was having the soup of Surf excel. Next the pork pieces were not tender at all. The soft drink served to us also tasted as if a dollop of sugar had been added to it. On the whole, i had the worst experience ever and my friend had to suffer from stomach cramps for two consecutive days.

One of my favourite eating joints since my college days. Never dissappointed with their food, but their service tends to get a little slow in peak hours. There is usually a long queue during office lunch hours (1pm-2pm). If you want a relaxed meal, it's better to avoid that time slot. Their chicken steamed and pan fried momos are out of the world, two other favourites of mine are chicken mushroom soup which comes with a generous quantity of mushrooms and chicken shreds, and the pepper chicken dry, I recently tried out their chicken shapta which was good but a little too spicy for my taste. 
Overall, it's a great place for good food and pretty much within budget.

Me and my friend came across Blue Poppy on Zomato, thought of checking it out. Our all time chinese favorite is Cantonese noodle and chilly pork and to our surprise it was served within 15 min. One plate of Cantonese noodles is more for a single person. And the pork preparation - they were scrumptious !
The food at The Blue Poppy appears simple, but the flavors have remarkable dept. Pricing is cheap despite its location and quantity is really good. Both of us are big fan of Chinese and this place does tops out list for good quantity and price-wise.

The first thing that comes to mind whenever I think of Blue Poppy are the numerous team lunches that we used to have when my office was located in that part of town. Serving Tibetian, Nepali, Chinese and Bhutanese the food here is absolute value for money. Chinese lanterns hang from the ceiling; there is a minimalistic yet clean ambience to the entire place. 

During winters if you have a knack for cheese and spicy taste do try the Ema Dasi, a creamy cheesy bowl of chilli and cheese. I always opt for the chicken shafale (a round fried puri with a stuffing of pork or chicken) for starters. I also like the chill pork and the mixed meifoon here.

If you are looking for an office lunch or want to bring an old friend to revive the year‚Äôs bygone then this place. But if you are looking for dinner please be prepared to place the last order by 9:45 pm as they shut down early.

We visited for a team lunch on a sunny Sunday.. 

We were told to wait for 5-10 minutes on arrival. They kept their word and called us within 8 minutes. Thumbs up for that!

We ordered 1 plate each of Pan fried veg and non-veg momos in garlic sauce for starters-- it was too tasty but the chilly was a bit higher. For main course we ordered Chicken Manchurian, mixed fried rice, Mixed vegetables in garlic sauce, veg fried rice-- all were too tasty. As i served myself the food on the plate, the aroma won me over.The first bite was heaven! How did i never order this stir fry dish? 

I'd really appreciate if they improve their serving time a bit. It took long to serve the lunch. The toilet was untidy :(. 

The last and most negative was they don't accept any kind of plastic money!

Our order was served within 10mins and as i served myself the food on the plate, the aroma won me over.The first bite was heavan!How did i never before order this stir fry dish? i wondered

Sikkim house blue poppy was one of those college student- friendly places which is close to my heart because of the steamed momos. Loved the momos and whenever i come to any of the branches, i always order steamed momos and nothing else. I die for the momos!!! Worth having and extremely student friendly. Even worth bringing family and friends!

Obviously when you get to hear such nice things about a place you would like to try it out at least once and that's exactly what I did, my first attempt failed because both their salt lake and russell street outlets were closed that particular Sunday nevertheless I didn't give up I went there after a few weeks on a Saturday this time (12/04/2014). Located on the first floor of Sikkim house with a small waiting area this place is nothing fancy when it comes to the decor, simple and neat is what comes to your mind. 
Now comes the tricky part of ordering food from a menu which offers chinese, tibetan and bhutanese cuisine. Anyway I had some items on my mind and I stuck to it which were chicken hot & sour soup, chicken shapta, veg chilly garlic rice and then I thought a visit to this restaurant will be incomplete without a plate of momos (steamed chicken). Needless to say that the quantity served was enough for 2 people and all the items we ordered were really spicy but thats how I like my food so no complaints. This was the first time I was having chicken shapta, its a dry preparation, lots of small chicken pieces and really hot. The momos as expected were soft and generously filled with chicken and with the hot momo sauce tasted good as well. I felt the service was excellent as it was fast and the waiters very extremely polite and with the bill amounting to just Rs 470 or so this place is definitely value for money.

located at the first floor of the Sikkim House,Blue Poppy provides a very friendly atmosphere to all... this was my first visit and i quite liked the place because of its value for money service... we ordered for fried wantons and veg kothay... quality was good and the service was also comfortable... although the place looks a bit shabby but overall we had a lovely experience.. will be visiting this place again :)

Was very excited to eat at his place coz of the good review seen here.

Unfortunately, this turns out to be just an average fast food kind of joint with no surprise element. Service is quite slow.

The good part is its cheap and reasonable.

Best momos in kolkata.Chicken pan fried momos and chicken thupka are my favorite.Quality is really good.Small dim lights from lamp shades makes it a good ambience to have food.

The first thing that comes to mind when I think of the Blue Poppy is Value For Money.It is one of the best Value for Money places in town without a shadow of doubt.

This place is located in the first floor of the Sikkim House in Middleton Row,2-3 buildings in front of the Middleton Chambers.
It is a small restaurant with simple ambience and decor.The interiors are slightly better made up than the outlet at Salt lake near city center.But still the relatively small space coupled with the high popularity of this place make it difficult to get a table specially during the peak hours.

Coming to the food,there are Chinese Tibetan and Bhuatnese items on offer in the menu.Among the items I have had here,the momos,phalleys,kothays,chili pork deserve special mention.They are my favourites here.The momos are nice and soft and perfectly cooked,just like the ones one would get in Sikkim.The chili pork here is not as spicy as some other places and the pork used contains the right mix of meat and fat.These two things make the chili pork here one of my favourites.The other slightly atypical items like the gyathuk and thenthuk(which are similar to the more well known thuppa) and the ema dasi and the q dasi are also very tasty and are surely worth a try.

The best part about this place apart from the food is the pricing.It is very very reasonable.The service is nice and swift too.

Overall this is surely one of the best value for money places which is surely worth recommending.
Enjoy!!:-)

The Blue Poppy is not a restaurant which many people come across. That is because it is inside Sikkim House in Russel Street. However, thanks to Loreto college, I soon came to know about this place and started spending my lunch breaks over there everyday. This is the place you should go to when you have very little money in your pocket. It makes the best momos in Kolkata and their singapore chicken is lip smackingly delicious.

The place is slightly tricky to find .. Its in the lane opposite to vardan market n in the same building as Sikkim house .. There are no signs guiding us there which the owners should consider putting ... Coming to the ambiance the place is nothing great to talk of in terms of decor but the food is pretty nice .. Had just tried chilli mushroom dry .. Steamed momo .. Pan fried momo n veg thukpa all were light good on flavour and decent in terms of quantity .. Will b looking forward to try out more Tibetan dishes ..,  service was good n price is pocket friendly ...

I ordered chilli garlic chowmein, garlic pork and momos one day. After they served all the dishes, I was too confused which one to eat first. All of them were so good, that I not only finished my own stuff, I also took a lot from my friend's plate. This restaurant is the pioneer of momos, chowmeins and any pork items. All the pork lovers must visit this place.

Extreme momo craving in my previous office led me to haunt this place often since it was located very near. The place was small but around 7 in the evenings it was bustling with people. I loved the ambiance. A motley group of people - tables were occupied in fours, twos and sometimes even a single person, busy reading a book while slurping on their yummy thupka. I felt instantly connecting. We ordered the steamed pork momos and panfried ones. And suddenly the adventurer in me, after repeated watching of Cheese Slices on TLC, decided to try the Ema Dasi [Cheese with Chilli]  the national dish of Bhutan. The food was definitely love at 1st taste. It is a great value for money place with the yummiest momos. A must go for momo lovers.

After hearing such good reviews of this place we decided to hit it today with huge expectations,it was in the middleton street in sikkim house's first floor..  and we were not at all dissapointed..it was awesomeee ..we were in the waiting list with other 16 people and had to wait coz the place was crowded for abt 20 minutes ...then we got a chance to enter the restaurant and make ourselves comfortable ..the place had minimum decor with certain quotes  on the walls..
Coming to the food we ordered for mixed rice ,singapore chicken,chicken egg hakka noodles ,fresh lime soda and virgon mojito..i loved the chow it had the perfect flavour and the rice and chow both had adequate amount of chicken and singapore chicken was very tasty and it is a lil spicy and had large amount of chili in it..i liked it coz i love chili in food..
And the drinks were juz perfect i loved the fresh lime soda coz it had the fresh taste of lime and the virgin mojito was sweet in taste has a minty flavour as usual...
The food was awesomeee and the place is pocket friendly our bill amounted to rs.600..and the management were extremely friendly and they care for their customers coz they said 20 minutes to it and they really took 20 minutes..now am a fan of blue poppy and this will be my new destination whenever we wl be in maidan area..i will try their tibretian and nepali dishes..:p

After reading so many reviews about it here in Zomato, finally decided to go for it today :D
Blue Poppy is the national flower of Bhutan :)

Location - Its located at the 1st floor of Sikkim House. Though its a bit difficult to locate, had to ask few people about it. If you are coming by Metro then from Maidan Metro Station(Middleton Street Gate) you have to walk for 5-7 minutes, just crossing the Little Russel Street on your right you find the Sikkim House on your right hand side.

Brief - Today I accompanied TB to Metro Plaza along another beautiful lady friend of mine. After 3 hours of non-stop shopping ( ladies you knw :D ) we felt hungry. So we decided to try Blue Poppy as it was very nearby. 
But as we climbed the stairs of Sikkim House we were greeted by a crowd of atleast 20 people sitting in chairs and adjoining stairs. We were like what's this all about. I went inside the restaurant and the pleasant man smiled at me and said "Aapka Coupon Banadu?" (Shall I make your waiting coupon. He told me that we would have to wait for 20 minutes before getting in. And exactly after 20 minutes he called us.

Ambience - Its not a large place at all. Around 8-10 tables all total. There was no such decoration to mention. 

Things Ordered - We were 3 people, despite my acute demand for Momos, we ordered 1 plate mixed fried rice(without pork),2 plates egg-chicken noodles(hakka),1 plate Singapore Chicken.

The order came within 5 minutes of waiting. The servers were always smiling and were cooperative while I was clicking pics. The rice and noodles had large amounts of chicken and egg. Rice being mixed, had some proportions of prawns as well. The quantity was not huge as Hatari, but were more than enough for 1 person. The Singapore chicken was a spicy affair. It was nicely prepared(6 pieces of chicken). 

We also ordered Virgin Mojito,Fresh Lime Soda(sweet) and a bottle of Slice to quench our thirsts. It was really a humid day today.

Purse Check - The total bill was Rs. 610/- !! Awesome :D

Overall - Good food, good people, fast service and really pocket friendly place. Definitely Highly recommended. Going try their momos soon :P
Cheers, Enjoy !

Best chinese restaurant in Salt Lake, Period. As you enter the joint a rush of authentic chinese/tibetian smell bombards your nose. Pan fried momo's... It's real authentic even if their service takes a lil more time than usual but its only due to the rush. Try any dishes its really tasty. Only complain is that they add  a lil more than whats required in regards to garlic..... enjoy

You've to enter sikkim place and search for this wonderful Tibetan eatery to enjoy perhaps the best Tibetan fare in town. However,stick to the Tibetan and Chinese fare,don't dare experiment with the Nepalese thali.
Ambience 7/10
There is this cosy vibe inside,however,you may be appalled by the decor and it'll appear as a small local eatery with just air conditioning facility.
Food Presentation 7/10
Nothing worth mentioning. A very regular manner.
Food Quality 7/10
I wanted to give a 9 coz i really loved their pork shyapta with rice noodles. Even their momos are excellent. However,my zeal of experimenting everywhere deceived me this time with the pathetic Nepalese thali. Others may like it,but i didn't,unfortunately.
Food Quantity 8/10
The thali was average,but quite filling. The shyapta with meifoon should be sufficient for two people.
Cost Effectiveness 8/10
Prices are quite reasonable,the thali came at less than hundred bucks,other items are also quite economically priced.
Overall 37/50

Blue Poppy - A lovely place to enjoy the Momo's specially. 
-------------
Brief:

I had visited this place with few of my friends today. I entered Sikkim house and walked by straight and den i was like where is blue poppy. Thereafter on asking a lady, she told me 1st floor. I went there and it was jam packed. Had to give my name as there had been waiting list 4. However, after waiting for a long time, got the place. It was altogether a different environment out here at blue poppy somewhere different than the usual restaurants. 
-------------
Food:-

Ordered:-

1) 2 Veg Steamed Momo - 16 pieces of soft momo melting in the mouth was a heavenly experience.
2) Pan Fried Veg Momo - A little crisp on the momo's diced with Sweet Chilli Sauce which tasted much much more on the sweeter side. 
3) Apple Soda - It tasted good. 
-------------
Ambience

The decor was nice. It was more like entering into a different place altogether. 
-------------
Summary:-

Food quality 4/5
Presentation 4/5
Value for money 4.5/5
Taste 4/5
Quantity 4/5 
Ambience 4/5

Conclusion:

A must visit for those who are Momo Lovers. It's a paradise. Next time, i am definitely going to try the Chinese Chowmin/Rice, Thukpa and various other items too. :)

I visited this place recently after having heard of their succulent dumplings a while back. The ambience is quite serene and likeable enough! The visit wasn't planned so I was a little low on cash when I visited so orderded just pan fried pork momo and when they said they did not provide soup with it I ordered the veg clear soup. The staff are polite and the order came soon enough although it was a bit later than I was hoping for. The momos were excellent and the soup, with the addition of a few taste makers, complemented it pretty well too! The price of the items are more than acceptable. So I left the restaurant satieted both hunger wise and taste wise, making a mental note of returning there to try out the kothey and phalay.

There are eateries that are just that, and then there are those, that go on to be something more. The Blue Poppy, located at a posh and accessible location in the hub of Kolkata, at Russel Street is one such place. It is a go-to place for me and my friends. An all time favorite, this dinning room belonging to Sikkim House and serves delicious fares that are not only a delight to the taste buds, but is also a sweet harmony to one‚Äôs wallet. Yes, it is possible to attain a gastronomical nirvana here without blowing up the budget for a whole month. 

One can get a taste of Tibet, China or the far flung North Eastern parts of the country right here, on the menu of the Blue Poppy. So you can gorge on the momos, which is exactly what we did when we visited this once. In fact, when I think of momos, I think of this Blue Poppy. 

When you step into the Blue Poppy, the first thing that will grasp your attention is the colorful Chinese lanterns and wall hangings. It adds a warm welcome to the entire set-up. Seating is modest and the place is spacious. You might want to go with a lot of time on your hand, as you have to beat out other eager foodies standing in the long line that more or less precedes the restaurant. 

Now, there are a variety of momos to choose form. If you are not the adventurous type, you may stick to convention. But, if you are a foodie and like to experiment, then my friend, you are in for a joyride. There is the traditional steamed momo, every momo lovers‚Äô manna from heaven. Following this, the menu expands into the friend momo variants, the kothay and the pan fried ones, which is least to say, a taste bud tingling delicacy. 

Since we were in the mood of experimenting, we ordered the chicken kothay and the pan fried momo, as well as the chicken-pork men tse tse soup. It all went together beautifully, like a piece of an orchestra- synchronized and melodious. The pan friend pork momo and chicken kothay had a beautiful consistency and the meat just melted in the mouth. The men tse tse soup had robust flavors that played riot with out palate. 

To go along with it, we next ordered the chicken phalay and the pork shapta. The chicken phalay was generous with the chicken portions, and the crust was just the right amount of crispy and soft. The shapta was a tad bit on the higher side of the spice-o-meter. But we didn‚Äôt care; it tasted delicious with the phalay. Since we were not in the mood for a full course meal, we refrained from ordering the Chinese staples like noodles and fired rice. But the sides were tantalizing enough. Portions here are generous and filling.

Went to this place with our appetite already full from Jyoti Vihar. Just a casual walk along the Little Russel Street and you are there at the Sikkim House which houses the 'The Blue Poppy'. Loved the tranquility of the place, with all the gentle staff there.
I wasn't in mood for usual stuff, hence I ordered something I never had. We, rather I decided on Pork Manchurian, Pork Fried Rice and Chicken Kothay.

Service was prompt. The kothay arrived quickly. It was a momo pan-fried at the bottom. There was a hot red sauce to accompany with it, but I preferred to do away without it, and it tasted really good. Next came the Pork Manchurian and Pork Fried Rice. The fried rice was as usual, nothing different from the usual chicken one, but with small pieces of pork in it. On the other hand the Pork Manchurian was something  to experiment with. It had sizable chunks of pork and its almost like saying it had two variety of porks in it. Some portions were a bit mild to chew which was ok, but some were very slimy and soft, which didn't appease me at all. 

Had a nice experience and a nice moment overall. The price was reasonable enough. In all a nice place to spend some quality time with good food.

This place is one of our all time favourites. It is actually the Sikkim House's dining room but is open to all, and thankfully so. You can go for the mouth watering momos or the thukpas or the thenthuk or even the Chinese fare. I have tried almost all the things here and the only items I don't particularly like are the meifoon soups. The momos are complete value for money. Eight delicious dumplings at that price is almost unimaginable nowadays. But these guys make it a reality. The fried momos are a bit oily but not as much as Tibetan Delight's. Again my personal favourite is the pan fried ones. The gravy here is a bit sweeter to start with but it is much better balanced and leaves a lasting impression on your pallate. The only shortcoming is perhaps the sauce of the momo here as it occasionally lacks consistency and is a bit too hot on some days. But I never complain about that. Also worth trying are the various noodle soups barring the meifoon which is a bit too bland and does not come with separate condiments or sauces or spices. The Chinese here is also pretty good and must tries are all the pork dishes if you are a fan of that variety of meat. And the value for money here is excellent. The service is efficient and is good enough. Staff are friendly but some of them have a language barrier and sometimes find it difficult to communicate. I love the way the meal ends. You pay the bill and help yourself generously to the concoction of mouth freshner at the cash counter. One more thing I forgot to add was if you are having the momos consider ordering a cold beverage with it because the cool drink really complements the spicy hot momo sauce. Enjoy.

When i think of momos , the first think that comes up in my head is blue Poppy! They have the best momos in town i feel. Also, the ema dasi and pork shapta and noodles are so so delicious. The quantity is good and the prices are easy on your pocket. this is a great place for Momo and pork Lovers. I also like chicken thukpa a lot. i can never really get bored of this place.

The national flower of Bhutan is an extremely difficult flower to grow and if you are a college going foodie in Kolkata then it is extremely difficult to miss! Yes, I am talking of the Blue Poppy.
This outlet of Blue Poppy is larger than its cousin at Salt Lake but is as warm and friendly. I dropped in with my friends a few days back and loved it! There is not much decor and the atmosphere is informal but tidy.
We ordered chicken clear soup, veg mein foon, ginger pepper rice, chilli garlic pork and spicy fish with vegetables. If you have read P.G. Wodehouse (Jeeves) then you must know that even clear soup can bring tears of joy to your eyes. This was one such.
The mein foon was excellent! It was glassy and smooth and tasted wonderful. The ginger pepper rice was a wonderful change from the fried rice that we are so used to having. It tastes wonderfully different. The spicy fish with vegetables had a nice concoction of fish nuggets and veggies but it lacked something to bind it together. It tasted like two different dishes- fish and veggies. 
The chilli garlic pork was a disappointment though. It was extremely saucy and sweet and tasted nothing like chilli garlic.
The staff is friendly and helpful and so are the prices. So are you ready for a heady dose of Blue Poppy?

I visited the place after reading some of the awesome reviews here but sad to say it was a disaster. The pan fried momos tasted like they were tossed in hot n sweet ketchup, the steamed momos had bits of bone and cartilage throughout, the garlic chicken was more like rubber chicken and the hakka was more like burnt oil and noodles. Needless to say I'm never visiting there again.

I will go with a low rating because of a bad experience.

I have noticed that most of the times I have had food packed from here, the experience has been rather disappointing. The time we got chopsuey and stuff packed was awful.

On the day before Christmas eve, we dropped in to order momos and chilli chicken / pork. Took it home and was definitely not happy with what we got. For starters, the pork momo packets weighed almost half of what the chicken one weighed. When I opened the packages the momos were so thin and dry. The taste was not a pleasure like it usually is. The chilli chicken (dry) was of six measly pieces and tasted so bland. The chilli pork (dry) fared no better. More of oil and less of flavour. A lot of fat. While the quantity was reasonable for once, the taste let us down.

On the other hand, we visited last evening and the chicken and pork momos were good like always! I guess they mess up only on take-aways :)



----- 23 Mar, 2013 -----

I have dropped in to Blue Poppy for momos often enough. Had been very impressed with my first visit. Found the quality take a slight plunge and had stopped visiting. For some reason, the food would taste terrible is taken home. The oil in the fried noodles would smell. Couldn't really figure it out. A couple of times the momos were not too great either.

I re-started visiting some time back, though not as frequently as earlier. The momos are back to what they were.

My impressions:

1. Momos are good. its nor gourmet stuff, but at the price, you get to fill your stomach. They serve 8 pieces per plate.

2. The other food tends to be a hit and miss affair at times. The hot and sour soup is at times too sour and at times too bland. No consistency. Same with the noodles... you cannot always be certain how it would be, but not as much as the soup. Some stuff is a little bland so it may not appeal to the lover of streetfood chinese :)

3. The fresh lime sodas tend to be either flat or plain warm at times.

4. Service is a little shaky. Some of the staff are efficient and some are not.

5. The place is clean and airy. Airconditioning works. Not always easy to get place here, which is a good indicator of its popularity.

So it is most certainly worth a try.

Located inside the Sikkim House, Blue Poppy is a rage among the youngsters. For a college-goer budget-friendly and delicious gastronomic delight is always a viable option. Blue poppy ticks the right notes in both these departments. Apart from the usual Chinese one can also go for either Tibetan or Nepali cuisine. However, I would suggest against opting the vegetarian Nepali Thali. It is similar to Bengali cuisine and except for the soya bean there‚Äôs no attraction if one is looking for variation. The place is always crowded and the soaring popularity of the restaurant comes with a price: If you are thinking of having your meal at a leisurely pace then reconsider your decision or just look through the glass door, you‚Äôll find people waiting desperately to finish your meal fast!

Blue Poppy is located at the first floor of sikkim house, but they should put a clear signboard inside Sikkim House. Otherwise for those  people who are going there for the first time , is really tough to find the entrance.. anywasys coming to the food.. they make realllllllly great momos.. their pork kothay is sumthing to die for....  on my last visit i orderd my fav pork kothay , veg steamed momo and some noodles and chicken sides... noodles and chickens are no doubt fine... but the momos are simply one of the bests in kolkata... this place is really good.... the amount of foods they serve is good enough  and Price is very reasonable, probably much on the cheaper side and surely pocket friendly...all the momo lovers should visit this place for once to try Blue poppy's momo and I'm sure they cant stop dropping in again n again....!

Blue Poppy has been serving one of the best momos in town hands down acc to me since atleast a couple of years.

Located in the first floor of sikkim house, they replaced momo plaza as my momo destination on my first visit itself. This outlet is bigger than the other outlet at salt lake. The decor is plain and simple. The staff is polite but not so good enough at times to explain you the preparation of the dish you are enquiring. I have had tough times in ordering the tibetan, bhutanese food since i am not so familiar with the cuisine.

Coming to food, i love the momos be it steamed or pan fried. They are very light, soft and tasteful. These are good enough for a complete meal for me. Another fact about them which i love is that the rates of momo has stayed the same ever since i went there for the first time though in these two years, the popularity has soared new heights. I like the ema dasi as well. The chinese food is average to taste otherwise the servings are generous at reasonable rates. The fried rice is good, hakka noodles is decent. The manchurian or mixed vegetables in hot garlic are my preferred ones for a side dish. The menu is exquisite but the amazing momos hasn't permitted much of experimenting. 

In short, i can have their momos any time any day but other than that, other food items even if not as good, are definitely decent to fill in the space left in tummy after eating the former.

The place is not built like a modern restaurant , it is more like an old style eating house .
Many people would not even know since there are not any boards or signs anywhere .
The taste is authentic Sikkim , steamed veg momos are thin layered unlike many momo joints .
The chutney served along is spicy and blend very well with the momo.
Crispy chilly babycorn though has some extra taste of tomato ketchup 
Overall recommended as the momos make up

Its situated at d 2nd floor of sikkin house.
The decor z very simple.. The waiters r courteous and helpful.. Their service was quick as well.
Coming to food, its awesome. We ordered pork shyapta nd mixed rice noodles. The rice noodles were so thin nd tasted really good. I have never had such thin rice noodles anywhere. But special mention to pork shyapta. Its such a perfect blend of spices.. Describing it z making my mouth water right now.. Pork shyapta z a must try...
If you wanna hav pork den dis restaurant is a must try.

The Blue Poppy

One suggestion I'd like to give to the manager of this restaurant is to put a clear sign inside Sikkim House as to the location of the Blue Poppy. I went on a day where i was really in a hurry and entering the wrong building inside Sikkim House. So as to help anyone who might face the same problem I did here are accurate directions to the restaurant. Enter Sikkim House from the right gate and keep walking straight. do not enter the first building. Go further to the back and enter a hotel of sorts. Climb the stairs to reach the first floor, where the restaurant awaits you.

Decor - The decor is very basic and flat. Its the same things you'll see in almost every other "chinese" store. The waiters know what each order is made from so can help you to decide the order.

Food - I went expecting brilliant food but it was not to be so. My order consisted of - 
1. Pan fried Momo - It was nice and spicy, and there were large portions.
2. Pork Chilli - The pork chilli was inconsistent but good. The pork was excessively  spicy which I liked but may not suit the tastes of other .

Opinion - The food was good and spicy and the service really prompt. That day i ended up reaching for my meet along with having a good tea/dinner. Visit for a good homely meal at a cheap price.

The Blue Poppy at the Middleton Row, bang opposite the Loreto College, back gate is one of the best places that serve Tibetan and Chinese food. 

We ordered Chicken steamed Momo and Chilli Baby corn.
The order arrived in a jiffy. The momos were smoking hot, the moment the fork went into it, rich steamy aroma began to ooze out of it. The minced chicken inside was soft and cooked to perfection. Certainly, one of the best momos in town. 
Next up, was the Chilli Baby corn, it was smouldered in a rich red gravy, the pieces of baby corn were decent. The moment i took a bite, i noticed that it was soft and cooked really well, but it wasn't spicy. It was more on the lines of being sweet and sour. That made it a bit less interesting. 

Over all, it is a very decent place, serving decent quality food at fairly moderate prices. Cheers,

Located within the Sikkim House, it is idle for an afternoon bite or a take-out. You might face some difficulty in locating it but you can ask around for directions and everyone is familiar to the building.
When we arrived the place seemed to be packed full and we had to wait for some time.
The menu is reasonably priced and the food quality is not at all dis approving.
You should try the momos here and the baby corn.
Pros:
Friendly face at counter
Staff is Helpful
Lot of seating accommodation available
Food is great when it comes to quality and quantity.

Cons:
The waiting area needs some modifications.

Whatever else you do at Blue Poppy, try their fried momos. And while you're at it, make sure you turn up a few minutes before noon in order to book your table. Even so, chances are that you will not enjoy a leisurely meal, because as soon as the staff notice that you're done, they begin to nudge you out, politely but firmly. Can't blame them, considering the limited space and the heavy rush. But even if you have time for very little, don't miss Ema Datsi, Shapta Pork, Pork Kothay, and thupka. That's Tibetan fare, mainly, but there are several Bhutanese and Nepalese options for the adventurous eater, too. Prices are extremely reasonable, and the quantities are ample.

Well the ambiance didn't score high for me.. but the food they serve is enough to compensate all the other factors!! The authenticity of the food.. magnificently reflects the fervor of Sikkim... that is heavenly for your taste buds and light for your pockets at the same time.. thus making this an extremely lucrative combo..!! Also what caught my attention is the Zomato Certificate at the entrance.. :D
The momos they  serve is simply fantastic.... infact one of the best in the city. I also tried the choupsey and thukpa and found these loaded with lot of authenticity and simple flavors yet delightful. However there were limited options for beverages and deserts. Pork lovers have a lot to choose from. The service is prompt. They also have home delivery service..
However those expecting a fine dining experience.. it isn't the place for you.. the rest who want to gorge on some delicious..heavenly..& authentic snack/meal..this is it!!

This place is not for you if you are looking for good ambience. The blue poppy serves Tibetan, Nepali and Chinese food. The best thing about this place is that the rates are very reasonable, rather cheap. If you are low on budget, this is the best place for you. The food over there tastes a bit different, maybe because of the love from Sikkim.

It used to be favorite snacks spot when my office was near maidan. Their cooking style reflects authentic touch of sikkim since their chefs are from sikkim itself. Their fried momo tastes awesome, in fact it tastes better than hamro momo's famous momos. Its ambiance is also quiet, placid and hygienic. The red chilli savory chutney they serve with momos will please your palate entirely. If you enjoy spicy dishes then please try Ema Datsi. It's a delectable dish made with bell-peppers blended with grated special parmesan cheese made from yak-milk, and I love it. Another dish is a must try for pork lovers, that is Shapta Pork. It's roasted pork sauteed with shredded dry chillies. (Please don't try ema datshi and pork shapta back-to-back since both are spicy dishes and will blaze your tongue). Needless to mention, their meifoon is tasty too. I personally don't like thupka, that's why never tried their thupka. But my friends love to have it and frequently order for it. Veggies can order for Kinema which is a tasty dish made of fermented soyabeans. Price is very reasonable, probably much on the cheaper side, and quantity they provide with is sumptuous. My rating for Blue Poppy would be 4 out of 5.

A busy day at work made us go without lunch, and by the end of it all, me and the Mister were both feeling ravenous. I had read excellent reviews about this place on Zomato, and we decided to head straight to the first floor of the Sikkim House. We were spoilt for choice, and decided to stick to the Tibetan fare on offer. We ordered the pork kothey, the mixed meifoon soup and two plates of chicken steamed momos. Now the Mister had decided to call it a day off red meat, and refused to sample the pork kotheys at first, but then one bite, and he ended up having five out of the eight kotheys served in a plate. The chicken momos were absolutely perfect, just the right taste and absolutely filling. The meifoon soup was the perfect accompaniment to the momos. However, we were still hungry and ended up going for a chicken phalay. An absolute wonder, my first time with the phalay was a delight to my tastebuds. And to top it all, so extremely pocket friendly for those days when you are just a bit short on the cash aspect. The bill came around Rs. 540 with a Slice thrown in, and both our tummies were extremely happy. Will surely drop in again.

Whenever my taste buds crave for momps, I land up at The Blue Poppy. The Veg. Momo and the Fried Momo reminds me of the momos that we get in Darjeeling. They taste perfect. The sexy Zomato certificate at the entrance speaks about the worth of the place. I also had the Veg. Fried Rice with the chutney and Q Dasi. It tasted bad the first time I had it but the successive attempts made me a lover of this dish. Had the prices been a bit low and had they had the option of home delivery, The Blue 
Poppy would have been a great offer for having lunch or the evening snacks.

Yes, a bottle of cola takes more time to arrive than the pork momos. But hell what, it just gives one enough time to order two plates of pork momos. The menu has some Chinese fare, etc but the pork momo is tops. What makes it special? The thin dough wrap and just about enough onion in the pork mixture. It's inexpensive. And there are enough momos on a plate to fill one's tummy. Only problem: for the uninitiated Calcuttan, it takes a bit of asking on the road to reach this momo spot. Service: 3/5. Momos: 4.5/5. Oh, it's 4.5/5 because I would like a slight kick of garlic.

After reading so many wonderful reviews about this hidden but popular place on Zomato, I couldn't wait for an opportunity to try it out. So, when I was supposed to give my birthday treat to a friend, I promptly decided on this place and told my friend that he could have the treat, only if he could find this place first ! To my relief, we found it quite easily and it wasn't over crowded either. The ambiance is pleasant...so no complaints there.

Now, coming to the food.....even though the menu included Nepali and Bhutanese cuisines...we didn't experiment much and stuck to safer options. We ordered Chicken Kothay, Chicken Egg Fried Rice, Chicken Chilly Garlic Noodles and Singapore Chicken. Service was prompt. The Kothay (momo that is lightly fried on the bottom) tasted awesome with the fiery hot red sauce ! They were certainly one of the best that I've had. The Fried Rice was flavorful and made a good combination with the Singapore Chicken. As both were lightly spiced, they complimented each other well. The Chicken Noodles were in one word- Spicy ! I guess my friend got what he asked for ! With whole red chillies thrown in, it was definitely not subtle. I was so thankful for having a Pepsi by my side at that moment ! 

The quantities were good too...the Rice and the Noodles taken together were more than enough for the two of us. Overall, it was a great meal. A nice place to treat someone ! And yes, the pocket-friendly prices, coupled with the fact that you don't have to pay VAT, leaves you with a smile on your face ! Looking forward to my next visit to The Blue Poppy....4 stars from me. :)

I went to this place  just 2 weeks back with my friends for a birthday treat. Its small and cozy and is a part of the Sikkim tourism. The price is quite low and the food quite good. We ordered a variety of dishes, momos, rice, meifoon, noodles, chicken, pork, and a veg dish named Q Dasi. The meat was well cooked and tender. The momos weren't that good though. The Q DAsi was really delicious. The quantity was huge, two of us could finish one plate of meifoon. Overall a nice plate to go for a lunch with a  low budget.

You will experience sheer delight at having discovered this place-tucked away in the first floor of Sikkim House in a business locality.
A foodies haven,the menu is extensive and you can explore around quite a bit..though its better if you stick to the steamed momos,pan fried momos in gravy (undeniably the best in town),pork shyapta ( double fried but juicy chilli spicy pork),pork phalays (momo's  stuffing in a circular samosa packing),Q-dasi(if you are fond of spicy cheesy soup you can give it a try).Chinese items are better given a miss,similar fare at similar/lower prices can be found elsewhere.
The single complaint i have with this place is the non-existence of hot beverages(on the menu ,but not served) and limited mundane choices for the cold beverages.
The service is prompt and courteous; well-lit, well-spaced seating arrangements.
However,this place is not meant for those looking for a fine-dining "experience" as is quite obvious from the pocket-friendly pricing.

This place is meant for people who know their city and their food.Firstly this is located at  Middleton Row and housed on the first floor of Sikkim House.Now that is some location!!!! Tough to trace out for most people. Happened to visit the place along with my colleagues during lunch hours.I was shocked to find the place jam-packed.Had to wait for a couple of minutes outside in the waiting area.The place is reasonably clean by Govt. canteen hygiene standards.The menu is vast and offers Tibetan, north-east,indianised chinese and some north Indian dishes.Their forte is the momo, thupka and the pork dishes.I tried the chicken sweet corn soup,chicken Hakka chow, chicken pan fried momo and chicken momo in garlic sauce.Must say, found the food to be pretty good especially the momos-perhaps one of  the best momos served in the city.Prices are extremely pocket friendly-that explains the crowd of office-goers and college students .
Special mention: The place also  serves rice and fish thalis-(maach bhaat for bengali folks) :) The ground floor has a Sikkim Govt. tourism stall which provides information on Sikkim and perhaps does bookings as well.

well   all i can say is that when you want to have dumplings , no need to think beyond the blue poppy . when i visited the place i was awestruck by their prompt service & delicious taste of their dumplings ( momos to be more precise ) . we had chicken steamed momos  accompanied by chicken thukpa   & the overwhelming quantity meant that we could not explore more options on the menu . best place for college goers / office goers either for a quick bite or even for a full fledged meal . best part is that unlike other momo joints this place is Airconditioned , which adds to the comfort factor . but you  may have to ask a few people around if you are visiting for the first time as the place is difficult to locate .   a note of caution though , do not expect fine dining here as this place is thronged my mostly young people who do not have a lot in their pockets

Discovering The Blue Poppy at Middleton Road is like discovering a meeting place of one of the secret societies from a Dan Brown novel. And just like a novel telling the story of unearthing century old secret societies becomes an unputdownable read similarly once you discover this place you will love coming back again and again. This is because long after you leave the restaurant the taste of the food served here would linger on..... forcing you to plan the next visit soon.
One of the reasons why The Blue Poppy scores so high among its regulars is the choice of cuisine it offers for both snacks and main course. You may choose from Tibetan, Bhutanese, Nepali, Chinese and Indian delicacies on offer. 
The list of stuffs I like here is long. The juicy steamed Momos or the steamed Momos shallow fired on one side called Kothay are among the must try items here. You may also try Phalays it is another variety of Momo, the only difference is that it is rolled like a stuffed paratha with your choice of Momo fillings inside. The Thukpas here can be your perfect companion for a lazy winter afternoon. Thenthuk, a type of Tibetan flat noodle soup is also yum. 
Nepali cuisine to some extent requires an acquired taste. If you are visiting this place with your friends it would be a good idea to try one Nepali thali, in that way you can get the taste of a different cuisine all together without giving too much pressure on your palate. 
Ema Datshi, a Bhutanese chili cheese stew served here with rice is nice too. The Chili pork here too is a huge hit among pork lovers. The Chopsuey and Meifoon of The Blue Poppy too are a must try. 
Apart from √Ä la carte, the Indian option has thali meals too ensuring you get the taste of home cooked food.
There is nothing much to talk about the d√©cor of this place. The Blue Poppy is simply done, has air conditioning and is neat and clean. The main and the only attraction of this place is the food served here. The service is prompt. But if you are visiting this place during lunch hour on weekdays you will see a crowd waiting patiently for their turn. So ensure you have enough time. 
The only hurdle is to discover this place. It is on the Middleton Road but you will not find it unless you LOOK FOR IT. It has no signboard. In fact even if you enter the building where it is located you may still never know where it is! But once you find this place you would want to come back again and again to this ‚Äòsecret foodie society‚Äô. Only this time Dan Brown would not be around to help you unearth the secrets of this place and your sole clue will be the menu card‚Ä¶..

This place has become one of my favourite haunts....be it for the unearthly momos ,or the pork shapta,or the noodles,
The momos are a must.The sauce they serve for it is especially hot and goes along splendidly.
The noodles are great....I've tried most of them and they did not disappoint me.They also serve meifoon,a queer thin noodle.
Then there is the pork shapta....rich,spicy....i keep going back for more.
The place has timings so you'd better keep that in mind....no VAT so little pocket-pinch.For first-timers,finding the place might be difficult as it is located inside a building in sikkim house.
The place is cozy,the staff is courteous,it remains crowded and you might have to wait a bit,but it'll be worth it in the end.

This place on Middleton Road is a true discovery for foodies. Located within a business compound, don't be apprehensive of the surroundings. Its probably the best choice within a mile if you want both price affordability and quality. Service is uninterrupted and fast. The staff are courteous. The decor is cosy and subtle. In short, everything a good restaurant should be. The I've been here nearly on 4 occasions and I'e found them to be consistent in what they do. One thing which makes them stand out is their respect for the culture and cuisine they represent alongside ensuring that the culinary traditions stay intact. There's a large range of dishes to choose from. 
The place serves a mixture of cuisines, primarily Chinese, Nepali and Tibetan. But the thing to look out for is the Bhutanese dishes which you can get only here. Unfortunately though, they have dropped a number of these dishes in recent times. Still the " q dasi potato with chili " was a delight. Same for the Tibetan " Veg Gyathuk " and the various" Phalays ". Amusingly there are no items on the menu under the heading of Sikkimese. :) On my maiden trip, we had the Meifoon, fine strands of rice noodles that make marvellous chow mein. The accompanying Pork Shapta was thick and spicy, in tune with Sikkimese food. The Pork was juicy and thoroughly cooked.  Avoid the casual snacks and Indian dishes. Not worth the time. 
Chakraborty Tip :  It's the perfect place to take a friend out for a treat. The secret to the tumbling prices across the menu is the fact that the restaurant is directly under the Sikkim State Goverment. Say no to VAT :)

I am a vegetarian so cannot say much about the non-veg items available here, which is pre-dominantly the non-veg restaurant. I mostly go for their momos and Thupkas, which are good and their chutney has always been smoking hot and delicious. The thought itself is mouth watering.

I recently tried their Nepali Thali and can say, that is not for everyone to taste and enjoy as for a few of the items in Nepali Thali, you need to develop the taste. It wasn't worth for me and it almost looked and tasted pale and stale. I had to leave it as it is after a couple of spoons. 

The ambience is normal and nothing great to talk about and considering, it is one of the few authentic Tibetan restaurants in town with an AC, is a good attribute, as the momo sauce can make you sweaty. The prices are affordable and for people who doesn't need a menu to order in a Tibetan restaurant, can have a great time here. 

Special tip - Do not try their crispy chili babycorn also. It is the worst ever I have tasted in my life.

It's the place I go for pork momos. Only problem is management should keep track of which guests is coming first and who is coming later. As Calcutta has many stupid people who think no end Of themselves . they cut the que and help themselves to a table although they know that others had come before. These kind of people really need to be told off. It is this attitude of people that need to change. Everybody has a right to be treated as an equal. Just because guests have the money and have come to be served does not give them the right to treat any one else as inferior. Nothing against blue poppy just please do justice to people who have decency to wait for their turn to get a table.

My friends was talking very highly about this place and dragged me here one day. The first thing I noticed was the place was full and people were waiting outside even at around noon in the middle of the week. We had to wait a while for before we got a seat. Decor wise, nothing much really - simple place. I don't prefer pork so ordered chicken pan fried momos for myself. It was 'okayish'. We also had a fish item which wasn't good. The fish smelt and tasted stale. Better not experiment with other dishes and stick to your momos. Overall, decent place. I'd think twice before coming here personally.

This is one of the better places to enjoy momos.Was referred by  friend and we went there in the evening and were served quite fast.
Located on the first floor of the guest house a Sikkim House, there's nothing exciting about the decor.However the place is clean and ambience is ok for a family.But given the quality of food and value for money I would happily disregard the decor!
We ordered steamed and fried chicken momo and also some variant(forgot the name) that were boiled on one side and fried on the other...that was the best of the lot.Also had gravy noodles which were yummy and chilli pork(I personally am not too big a fan of pork but those who had it said its awesome).
Overall highly recommended.
Timinhs r a bit odd though since they finish off by 830/9 whuch is just during the start of regular dinner hours in Kolkata.They also remain closed on the last Sunday of a month.

I guess i was expecting too much from this restaurant and that's the sole reason i was slightly disappointed. The Nepalese thali was the most disastrous selection by us. The things we liked were the meifoon with pork shapta and chilli pork. Shapta is a variant of chilli pork which tastes better according to me. I had been craving for Tibetan stuff,so as i placed my order i was informed whatever i was ordering were all names of soups(which wasn't mentioned on the menu card ).So it was just chicken steamed momos i enjoyed from their Tibetan fare.

Inexpensive and good food. A must visit for any foodie. I was here this Sunday with my brother and elder sister. And I must say, it blew me away. Now, for  anyone who knows me and my brother, they can vouch for our food expeditions and well our diverse and gigantic tastes. While a bit hesitant with respect to the decor, we ordered mushroom and chicken soup along with a plate of fried pork momos as starters. How would I/we define them? Heavenly of course! The momos were to die for! We followed it up with a plate of pork garlic rice, and a plate of mixed fried rice along with lemon chicken and sweet and sour pork. While initially I wanted to go in for the chilli pork my brother urged me to try the other option out and man was it awesome! The pork garlic rice was cooked to perfection with a finely balanced rice, while I must admit that in comparison, the mixed fried rice, heaped with all the delicacies was in fact a little bit bland. The lemon chicken was light and fresh but the star of the day was undoubtedly the sweet and sour pork. With the right hint of mouth watering combination, it was worth a culinary experience in every sense. For serious foodies, who like their ambience, the loud noise surrounding you might be off putting, but if you have good company and a taste for food, Blue Poppy is excellent and light on the pocket as well. As you can see, all that food cost us a bare 700! I think my brother and I are going to go back there pretty soon!

The simple veg steamed momo.. W. O. W. 
I was downright confused as to what shall I order, so played safe and ordered the steamed momos & it seemed like I'm in one of those shacks enjoying the momos in the mountains.. Not much of a momo lover but this can just win you over!!

However, the crispy chilli baby corn wasn't a win, the momos certainly made up for that. 

Cannot wait to go back n try the rest!!

This place is, hands down, a rare find. Located away from the usual haunts, it's carved a niche for itself in chinese/thai/nepalese cuisine in kolkata. I simply adore their pan fried pork momos, and rice noodles. The soups are also delectable. You cannot give this one a pass.

Like everyone's been saying, this is the ultimate place for momos.....especially the Pan Fried Pork Momo in Garlic Sauce. Absolutely delicious. The remaining dishes range from Tibetan to Bhutanese and Nepali to our well known Chinese dishes.....and at such moderate prices, they are most certainly worth the money. This and its Salt Lake counterpart, are both (for good reason too) really good places to hit with a group of friends, more than once.

Popularly known by the building in which it is housed ("Sikkim House"), The Blue Poppy has become a personal favorite in a short span of time.

1) Decor: Super simple and homely. It is not competing with its fancy Delhi counterparts like Yeti, which is quite okay. The place is comfortable and clean.

2) Food: Absolutely excellent. The steamed momos are a delight while the thukpa here is quite outstanding. The Chinese is pretty good too. I wish they housed tea/coffee 24x7 though (hence the 0.5 stars docked).

3) Pricing: Very very affordable. A meal for two is ~Rs 250.

A special note on the staff and the owner - they're very warm and humble and go all out to make your experience pleasant. 

Do visit The Blue Poppy - it is definitely worth it.

Totally worth your money. All the dishes are tasty and authentic. Do take the advise of the servers regarding some unknown items in the menu - they will gladly oblige and are very helpful. One suggestion for the restaurant - If you could add brief descriptions to the Tibetian and Bhutanies dishes on offer it would be priceless.

One hot and sultry day, my friends and I were so famished by the sun beating down on us that we decided to go in the shaded area inside sikkim house. Little did we realise that there would be a restaurant there to make us feel back alive. One of my friends said that there was a restaurant and I went in hesitating, thinking it to be a bar. Inside we were greeted by a middle aged lady and her sons and daughters maybe. They were all very cordial and gave us comfy sofas to sit on. We ordered anything and everything that they suggested since we were very hungry and famished. They served cold water in Kinley bottles. The decor was impressive. We had a great meal and then came the bill. It was 470 bucks. We were six people sharing the food. This was around 4 years ago when we were searching for jobs. Oh and the kinley bottles were not mineral water but regular water so they were not chargeable. I was looking for the charge of water in the  bill but found none. I cannot remember the dishes to refer but everything tasted authentic. I still remember a friend of mine appreciating the lemon chicken even a couple of hours later. I will surely visit this restaurant again. They have opened up in saltlake. After our shared lunch here, we all got our job offers in quick succession.(might ask them for a fortune cookie :P)

Blue Poppy serves the awesomest momos in the city. The veg pan fried momos with garlic sauce is amazing and so are their steamed ones. The chilly garlic noodles is very good too. Order it with a side dish - Manchurian/mixed vegetables in garlic sauce, and it makes your meal a yummy one totally. The thukpa is a must try too/ 

Overall a lovely place to have good food and not spend much on your meal. The place is small, dimly lit and cozy. The staff serves well, they can do much better on the service and the ambeince though.

The Blue Poppy is a place that is well known for its momos, but much more is available on the menu. Till last year, one could also take pride in its low prices - alas, inflation has caught up. Still, the quantity and quality of the items is well worth the price.

Apart from traditional steamed and fried momos, this place also serves a variety called Kothay, which (as far as I understand) has the bottom of the momo seared, but not to the extent of a pan-fried momo. The sauce they serve with the momos is also very good, containing a fair amount of the viciously hot dallay favoured by Sikkimese and Nepalis.

There are two Bhutanese items - Q Dasi and Ema Dasi - which are quite good. Again, very hot, but worth it. I would also recommend the Gyathuk and the Thenthuks.

The service is slow, so make sure you have enough time on your hands. On weekends, you might have to queue up to get in.

If you ever had a craving for the best momo, one should run towards the Blue Poppy. Pan Fried Momo is their specialty and is finger licking awesome. Even steamed and plain fried momos are very good too. Hangout with friends in the evening and this makes your day. Very good on your pocket too. Nothing to crib about it ever. A weekly affair for me and loving it

If you have the desire to be at a Gangtok eatery but donot have the time to pay a visit, then this place will surely fullfill your apetite. Located right at the heart of the busy Maidan area,near the Maidan metro station,The Blue Poppy is the right choice for good chinese and tibetan food ,at an affordable price. If you have a lust for momos ,then this place is a must try. The best part is that the eatery offers the authentic taste of Sikkim, and even the most common dishes like manchurian and noodles have a very sikkimish taste(kinda makes you nostalgic about Gangtok). Although the interiors might not be attractive ,the service is quiet good. And last but not the least, the price is  very pocket friendly......

If you are thinking momos, this is the place. The restaurant on the second floor, more popularly known as Sikkim House is ure place to be at. Those 8 pieces of momo are way more than worth 100 bucks. Its got ure value for money. But then again the chinese and Nepali cuisine is moderate. The Pan fried momos are more of a desert. Its too sweet for ones liking. However, there isn't a better place for steamed momos! And if u haven't had it, what are u waiting for? Run there. P.S: Pork momos are a touch better. ;) Enjoy.

Well decent food, reasonable price, but what's wrong with the woman with the tattoo. She runs the place alright, but have some basic hospitality. I get that you are a tribal, so am I, but you don't have to behave like one.
Folks, go there to eat food that you are familiar with. Don't get fancied by the exotic names of the food. They will serve you some stale food and cover it up calling it an authentic Sikkimese cuisine. 
I'm a Bhutia but I don't look like one, so they served me some stale T-momos. And they have no shame, no apologies. Instead, you have to pay for the stale food.

P.S. The staff is pretty well mannered and so is the other lady who usually sits at the counter. But beware of the snaky witch.

If perfect momos are what you want than this is your place. It has the best momos I have had. Their pan fried chicken momos are a delicacy and a must have. They serve good chinese food too which would include lovely Fried Rice, Singapore Chicken, Pepper Chicken and chilly garlic chow mein is what you should go for. The place is small but cozy, clean and comfortable. The crowd consists of mostly college students and office workers BUT one thing is why I wouldnt give it a 5 is because of their behaviour. They are quite rude and very unaware of their own restaurants rules and regualtion. Ones we came to eat here we had ordered a soup after we had eaten our meals (aint a crime, right!?) and they were being very late and we did remind the waiter ones but then he serves us the bill and not the soup and then when he asked for it he said it was almost closing time but after exchanging of a few words we got what we wanted and another time we were there at the restaurant at 3.14 and 4pm is their closing time and when we ordered they told us to make sure we order all at ones as they wont take no more orders anymore which was ok and as soon as it was 3.40 they switched off the A.Cs and most of the lights. very uncalled for behaviour. anyway if it wouldnt have been for the good taste, cheap food and the AC we wouldnt have come here during our breaks...

This was the place where my love affair with momos began way back, and I was re-introduced to it in 2008 when a friend insisted on going there. However, on that occasion I fell in love with the Thenthuk, and then began a period of time where all I would order when going to BP would be a bowl of thenthuk, a plate of kothey, and a soda. 

I have also fallen in love with the Ema Dashi (cheese and chilli soup) with the Ting momo, and the Shapta. Ergo, I love Blue Poppy. 

I would recommend the tibetan and bhutanese delicacies here to anyone. they are amazing.

We are quite regular visitors of this place, with our office being just a couple of minutes walk. The place can be a bit tricky to find, located within the Sikkim commerce house, on the first floor. At first it would seem like entering into a ac refreshment room of a railway station or at best an ac dining room of a hotel, no frills and fancy at all. But the food is good. The service can be a bit slow in weekday lunch hours though, and one might have to wait quite a bit to get a table.
the pan fried momos are good. I wont rate them best (momo plaza being my favourite).I love the various kinds of soups they offer, especially the mushroom soup. The fried rice is also quite tasty. and enough for 2, and the price includes VAT, which is reason enough to be happy

After hearing a lot about The Blue Poppy, finally last week I landed at this restaurant, situated at 4/1, Sikkim House, Middleton Street, with two of my friends for a dinner. It is on the first floor of the building. As we opened the door and stepped into the restaurant, we received a greeting smile from the one of the restaurant staff. The ambience is very simple, no fancy decor, lighting or color but the place is very peaceful and pleasing. The seating arrangement is also not very appealing. We took a four-seater table in the middle row and placed our order quickly, which included one plate Chicken Momo (Steam), one Egg Chicken Rice, one Chicken Chow and one Lemon Chicken. One thing I noticed here is that they are very quick in serving orders. While chatting among ourselves after placing the order, I rolled my eyes all around and noticed that on every wall, there is a display of Sikkim art. The lighting arrangement also reflects a Chinese or Tibetan style.  The place seemed very appealing and nostalgic to me as I frequently visit North Bengal and Sikkim. I felt the same culture and ambience here.
As the food was served, I could smell exactly the same flavor as I get in Sikkim. The Momo's were brilliant and I must say that one will rarely find such authentic Nepalese or Tibetan Momo's elsewhere in Kolkata. Excellent! And with Momo's, they also serve authentic Sikkim style hot and red chilli sauce (very common in Sikkim and Darjeeling). For a moment, I felt as if I was in Sikkim. The chow, rice and the chicken preparations were also delicious. No matter how simple the ambience of this place is, they are excellent in preparing authentic Chinese, Tibetan or Nepalese preparations. Also, the quantity of one plate is enough for two people. Overall, this food joint is just superb for all Chinese, Tibetan or Nepalese food lovers!

I am not rating this place 3.5 for the decor or ambience ( which by the way is horrible), nor am i rating it for its wonderful location (just beside my college). The rating is solely for the mouthwatering food available at a very convenient price. Ask the many groups of students who flock here everyday (and practically overcrowd the place). But not just students, this place is a wonderful hangout if you are a foodie and money is tight. I wish i could add a few more points for its location (....this place is very convenient for escaping classes) but i refrain because that would be unfair to other restaurants (sigh...sigh...sigh). In short this is a place that i would recommend to any one and everyone. As for me i will return to this place again and again.

Fried chicken is awesome and Chicken Thai soup is another fantastic one. Its undoubtedly can be the best chinese shop having reasonable prices. The noodles and rice taste great. 

Its located inside Sikkim House. Ambience is average and staffs are well-trained and informative.  You must visit there and i would rate 4.5 for BLUE POPPY.

This is what Kolkata is truly about. A restaurant like the Blue Poppy truly reflects the spirit of Kolkata in a weird way and upholds the image of the Kolkatan foodie. The ambience is not anything like a snazzy high priced modern restaurant, but it boasts of a cozy, cool and mystical decor. And the food is just mesmerizing. 

My suggestions:

1. Shapta
2. Kothay

However, beware of store timings and keep in mind that there is a lot of rush almost all the time. So don't be shocked if you have to wait in a long queue.

To be frank not a good place for vegetarians, as the variety is v.less and food sub par as v.limited choice of side-dishes are ther though the noodles n rice is GOOD.
Where Non- veg i concerned the variety is good, the food tastes good. One can get better chinese food but certain items such as Pepper Chicken and Garlic Noodles are worth every penny and Awesome. But as far as other items are concerned, my rating is AVERAGE.

Pork Shapta was awesome and then Nepalese Thali. The Nepalese thali I didn't find any special. Then fried rice is also pretty good. To top it all there is no tax, the total cost for two with above items were Rs 360. Yes , you read it right.

When you look at food that is full "paisa vasool" in terms of your pocket and tastebuds head out to The Blue Poppy. I love going and eating here with friends because you can relax , stuff your face and chill out all at once ! Needless to say they serve excellent momo's. Especially the chicken/pork steamed and panfired ones which are delicious. Though I have not tried it my veggie friends too love the veg option of the steamed momo's. Their Dry Chilli Chicken is also very good as is the Pork Shapta ... however Pork is a bit on the fatty side. As per the other Zomato reviews the Pork Kothays are super and I llok forward to trying them out: )

Being in the Sikkim House,it gets some attention from Office Staff and is the go to place for Loreto girls.

Their Tibetan pan fried momos may not have been the best , but it was certainly appetising. The Garlic Chicken with the pork chow rice was quite unique and felt like a burst of different flavours in my mouth.

Prices are economical.A wide range of Tibetan and chinese dishes are available in preparations of chicken to pork to fish to veg ! A must visit for Chinese Aficionados.The place is very small , and ambiance barely any !

I am a pure bengali foodie who cares about the quality n quantity not on the decor or ambiance because all the bengali foodies have grown up with old cabins of restors and benches of televaja or moglai shop so we don't care about the decor but on the quality. As we call ourselves foodies, the first preferences is food, regarding with price. The Blue Poppy is the place to got to, if you like Chinese or north eastern food. I visited it last Wednesday and at the entrance I feel the original flavour of a genuine sikimis or khashi or nepali eating house of Shillong,Bomdila, Mirrik areas.The Blue Poppy gets extra marks only for its flavours. Now I come to the main point food though I have not tried their momo as everyone says its good so I go for Pork items such as Shapta and mixed chow. Shapta is really brilliant with its taste,smell, ingredients. Badi(fat) of the pork in shapta is awesome and forced me to compare it with one which I took years back in Tawang Of Arunachal. Now the chowmin - it maintains a standard with the its noodles,eggs,porks etc with cooking also though it is quiet Kolkatan chow but it is good. Now quantity - it is perfect for a male foodie with one plate each and for two women foodie.Lastly its bill will make you smile  
which make you to come here again.

the chicken/pork shapta is simply out of the world.. and they go so well with the steamed buns ting momos.. 

the pan fried momos r a tad bit sweet but once their fiery hot chili sauce is added it simply tasted brilliant

Do speak to Diki for suggestions, she is very warm and always ready to help.

The place has a warm homely ambiance. Good for a lunch out with friends or family. Their momos are really nice and all. They didn't give soup with it though. The chilli pork and Tibetan dishes seemed to be nice, nothing outstanding. But an accidentally ordered dish "Rum Chicken" turned out to be really good. It can serve as a great starter with its playful sweet and spicy taste. One bad side is that the pork dishes have more pork-fat than actual meat. But they taste nice anyway. (we were in a "have loads of pork" mood). Leave out the Pork Manchurian if you don't want to taste pork in light chilly chicken gravy.

I used to love the fact that the place was dimply lit, but now they have brightened it. 
Food is good, no doubt.
The best place to have momos and different genres of food under one roof.

every time  I have visited the place panfried  chicken momo  in hot garlic  sauce  was a must in menu. I've tried the mixed  meifoon ( rice noodles ) and it was good too. schezwam chicken noodles was worth a try. disappointed  with rum chicken and lemony chicken. anyway,the place is cost effective

An ultimate youth hangout spot. Discreetly located inside SIkkim House, the place is a bit difficult to spot. Being closer to the colleges located in that area, it becomes an obvious choice for the college goers.
 The place although decorated with cute, round chinese lamps is dingy. The food here is decent and moderately price. Starting from momos , chilli chicken, fried rice, to dal, roti, papar ,the place has everything. Pork Shapta is a must try. The quantity too is quite generous . However, momos here act as  purgative for me cuz I'm bound to have indigestion everytime I eat the momos here.
 The service is rather quick and fast paced allowing you to relax and be done within an hour. The only unpleasant thing is the stench which greets you as soon as you enter the restaurant. Worth a try if you're looking for a quick lunch.

Momos are really the best part of the food here! You get the most brilliant momos in town. Pan Fried Momos and Chinese at throw away prices. 
Perfect for any student or professionals.. a little strict on the food service timings but once you eat here I am sure you'd not want to eat Momos from anywhere else. 
The Pork Shapta is quite a hit with people but people usually come down for their Chinese food and momos! 
ambiance: 2.5
location : 3
value for money 4
food quality : 3.5
service : 4
overall satisfaction : 3.5 stars

you would not be dissapointed by the food here, for sure!

The Blue Pill

When the pot-bellied taxi driver drives you through the labyrinth around Park Street, taking you to Assam House, Madison Tower and Fire & Ice before finally to your destination, you somehow lose interest in surprises. Like that bollywood heroine stranded at a railway station at night, you start praying for the rest of the day to be boring. Setting out to try an unknown cuisine, this can be very bad attitude. I am glad that "The Blue Poppy" was around, to reinstate my faith in good food and pleasant surprises. 

Far from the madding crowd of the Park Street and surroundings, operating precariously and quite anonymously from the housing complex that Sikkim House is, The Blue Poppy is that little gem which sweeps you off your feet, without even trying to do so. There are no signboards outside. The ambiance is not lavish and the staff doesn't exchange pleasantries or even smile. (I was the unfortunate recipient of a powerful scorn from the receptionist as she said "No Card, Only Cash"). Yet, in many ways, this place reminded me of why people ventured to eat out in the first place - Good food, and the fastest service I've seen in recent times.

Having heard lots about Nepali, Tibetan and Bhutanese cuisines, and having missed a chance to travel to Thimbu last month, I was quite keen to try almost everything on offer.  For once, I was limited only by my appetite, and not my wallet - thanks to the cheaply priced menu. I started with the Chicken Mushroom soup, and was completely blown away by the flavor of mushrooms, and was brought back to my senses by the mediocre chicken. That didn't stop me from emptying my soup bowl in minutes, or ordering 3 more dishes at once. 

First came the Chicken Phalay and then the Pan fried Veg Momos and Baby Corn fry for my veggie friend. Phalay, as the staff explained, is a sort of stuffed paratha, only less oily and entirely devoid of potato. Chicken was ground and cooked with green chilli, onions and a bit of ginger - much like the stuffing for momos.  Although saving my belly for meat, I tasted the veg dishes, and pronounced them good. As the Phalay got over, my table made way for the most awaited dish of the night - Dry Chilli Pork. Quite spicy, and simple - capsicum, onion, green chilli and pork - this, as pointed out by many more experienced foodies before me, is one of the best pork dishes in Calcutta. It easily serves two - that put me in a corner, as I looked at my companion. "Eating out with a pure veggie can be a pain" - she pointed out. I smiled, and focused my attention on the pork. As the spice got the better of me, I became a typical south Indian and ordered curd and rice, reaffirming stereotypes in the process. In a space of 30min came our savior- a fellow mallu returning from his round at the Park St- who finished the Pork, and went a step further, ordering the more spicy "Spicy fish with vegetables" upon my lady friend's insistence. That, to my shock, tasted unbelievably good, despite me being a sucker for bland food.
 
Blue Poppy doesn't look like the place that gives a damn about what people say about them. Me writing a review or not will not change anything in their universe. In any case, the makers of Blue Poppy, if you can hear me - Thank You! Thank you for making great food, serving it fast and serving it cheap!

PS: Despite loving the food, I was surprised by the amount of spice - mostly green chilli- at use.  Did the Buddist monks do it on purpose, to convert all to veggies? One shall never know.

Whenever I'm in a mood to have Chinese food during break hours in college the first name that comes to my mind is BLUE POPPY. I love having the steamed momos served with da yummy soup. The Crispy Chilli Baby Corn is very tasty. The quantity served is worth the price charged for each item. My main course has always been Chicken Hakka Noodles with Gravy Chili Chicken or Chicken Gravy Noodles with Dry Chili Chicken; it tastes great and I love my combo and have never got bored of it.

The Blue Poppy is easily one of the finest restaurants serving Tibetan/ Chinese? North Eastern cuisine. 
The place deserves to be appreciated for its consistency in quality and quantity. I first went there as a college student in 2008 and have gone back at regular intervals ever since.

The place gets two thumbs up.

MUST TRY : Pan Fried Chicken Momos.

The steam momos here are the best that i have had so far.The mein-foon noodle soup is also really good.Absolute value for money and good quality food.
one of the drawbacks is that the AC is positioned in the odd places (like right above the main door) and hence is not as effective as it should be.

Great food. Absolute value for money. What we loved the most was the home style preps, with no ott cornflour gravy that usually ails most Chinese main preps across restaurants. Courteous staff and fast service. We started out with the Fresh Lime Water - refreshing, Fried Chicken Momos - Good, Chicken Kothays - very interesting texture wise, the accompanying red chilli-garlic chutney was superb. For the mains, 3 of us shared - Mixed Fried Rice - very good, Prawn Meifoon Noodles - this we particularly didn't enjoy because of the rubbery chewy texture, but a lot of other customers kept on ordering it. Maybe it's a matter of personal taste. Furthermore, we had Honey Chicken - juicy, succulent pieces of chicken in an aromatic,sweet honey-sesame sauce. And then there was the piece-de-resistance - what this place is most famous for - and justly so - The Pork Shapta - dry chilly pork made the Tibetan way. A whole plate full of crispy, juicy, melt in the mouth tender pork, charred just the right outside, amazingly soft within, in the most awesome chilly spicy sauce. Droolworthy!!!  We ended with another round of Fresh Lime Soda and Cold Coffee. And all this for 3 very hungry people at 1 grand including everything.
Definitely going back soon.

If you can believe in self proclaimed foodies like me then trust me they serve the best momos in town. The restaurant itself is hard to find. If you ask someone for directions to "Blue Poppy" they won't have a clue to what you're asking for. You have to say "Sikkim House" before anyone can give you the right direction. Once you find it, you're in for surprises. The food is wonderful, ambiance okay and the service excellent. Once you're out of it you can't help but think that it's one of the best eateries for the money you've spent.

One of my favourite restaraunts in Calcutta..
The Q dasi and the Ema dasi are to die for if you're a cheese lover.. so are the sublime flavoursome and delicate steamed pork momos, for the meat lovers.. for those who prefer more robust flavours, please go for their dry chilli pork. if you have a cold have the men tse che  (pronounced 'mensisi' and much like the thukpa only with flat noodles in a delicious vegetable broth..), all the pepper will unblock your nose and you'll feel sleepy like a baby after you've gotten through your generous bowl. 
Oh ya, and on rainy evenings, go for the phalays, hot and fried and yummy.

Also the staff is lovely, do make friends with them.
Enjoy your meal!

The blue poppy has a great atmosphere relaxed with low warm lighting and nuteral color tones. Its a little worn around the edges but has the Best Momo's I have had to date. The Pan fried momos are spicy and fantastically flavored! The steamed momos and soups were all hearty and delicious. I only came on zomato to see if they had home delivery :(

The moment you enter this a place a sense of calm takes over. The place is not overdone and  reflects an out of the city charm. The staff is very polite and ever helpful, warning you about some dishes which you might want to experiment but may be a tad too strong for your liking. A visit to blue poppy is incomplete without its perfect momos( the pan fried ones being the most popular). Once you visit this place there are high chances that you'll become a loyalist !!

I have been to Blue Poppy several times and every time the experience has been extremely enjoyable. It serves excellent, mouth-watering, authentic Tibetan food at very reasonable rates. If you ever happen to go there you must order the pan-fried momos and the pork shapta. They are to die for. What is lacking in ambience and decor is more than made up by the courtesy, the charm and the friendliness of the wait-staff. This is not the kind of place you would take your family to or even your date, but it is perfect for a night out with friends (not your ghaas eating friends; but the meat-lovers). The only turn-off for me, about this place, is the limited time for which it is open each day. There have been times when I have traveled all the way from Salt Lake to Middleton Street just to discover that they are closed. So I would suggest that you not go there during odd hours and if you are going then give them a call beforehand just to make sure that they are open.

A meal for two will cost you around Rs.400 or so.
