It is small kiosk serves mostly  chaat, bhelpuri etc. This place is located in the ground floor of CC1, saltlake.
They have two other outlets, one in CC2, rajarhat and another one in Diamond plaza, nager bazar. 
Tried Bhelpuri and kachori chaat. Too good. Perfect if you need some 'chatapata' to eat. Pocket pinch is very reasonable.

This kiosk is located at CC1, Salt Lake.It mainly serves Chaats.

Service is nice.

Tried Raj Kachori , which was huge but it tasted average given the price. Street side stalls serves tastier stuffs than this at a much lower price.

Bhel junction is located at CC1, Salt Lake. It mainly serves tangy chaats.

Ambience is nice & hygienic.

Service is good.

Tried Dahi Papri Chaat, which was sufficient in quantity with nice toppings and tasted nice but a bit overpriced. Street side chaat stalls serves better than this at a much lower price.

All the dishes are over priced and they taste no where close to real indian street food. The quality of ingredients used seems to be quite low. Pathetic customer service too. Would never recommend.

I have tried raj kachori and dahi papri chaat.
I think it can be made better in taste.
It's inside city Centre salt lake.
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.

There used to be a time when I would go to City Centre with my parents and the bhel puri and papri chat of this tiny stall overlooking Inox would be a must-eat. The present scenario seems to be the same, just upside down. Took Raj Kachori and Papri Chaat. 
Papri Chaat barely had any onion or dhania in it - it had simply some cubed potatoes and peanuts mixed with sauce and spread on the papri. Not recommended.
Another try came for the Raj Kachori, which was a huge kachori filled with liquid of tamarind, dahi and spices. It looked like a huge phuchka! Not to mention how sweet it was. Raj kachoris are never so sweet. Equally bad.

Go for a street food wheeley or someone on the roads to experience better street food

Been seeing this outlet ever since it opened, but only tried them twice. Somehow, the idea of wasting money here, when better Bhelpuri joints are available on every looks and corner in entire Salt Lake somehow doesn't persuade me enough!

The Papdi Chats I had tried well were made. Sufficient amount of toppings; tomatoes, onions, peanuts, and the sweet and sour sauce, together formed a lovely concoction of flavors. The pricing here is definitely high and does not warrant frequent visits.

I've had their bhelpuri and papdi chaat (don't even remember whether it was papdi chaat or not) only on two occasions. During one of these, once when I was tired from shopping in Shoppers Stop and roaming around in the mall with cousins who were visiting Salt Lake and to whom I was showing around City Centre, I bought their bhelpuri which we'd wanted to share. My tongue was on fire after a few spoonfuls of the bhel-puri, and my eyes and nose started watering from the extremely hot and spicy flavor even though I can tolerably withstand and enjoy spicy Indian food. I couldn't feel any taste on account of the excruciating spiciness of the chaat. If one's looking for street food and bhel puri, one should try them only if one's got the habit of swallowing hot and spicy eatables.
