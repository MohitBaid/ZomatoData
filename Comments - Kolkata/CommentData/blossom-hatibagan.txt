I didn't find anything extraordinary in this restaurant. The ambience and decorations are good. Service is ordinary... And the food quality is very average. Though the price is reasonable as per with the quantity served but the tastes aren't always satisfying. They serve a Chinese thali which is really good...You get to eat soups, starters, main course and dessert within 600s. Other than that everything is  very very average.

On my last visit, I ordered Chicken sweet corn soup (this is one of my cheats to follow when I am visiting a new restaurant), mixed fried rice and chilli fish. The food tasted good enough with a great quantity. All what I ordered could be easily shared by 2 people quite conveniently. The price is also quite reasonable. Looking forward to visit again. I recommend this eatery to the people who want to taste good Chinese with reasonable price in Hatibagan.

Blossom was my "Man Friday" restaurant since childhood. There was rolls, chinese, Indian, Continental and yes not to forget the tandoor.So much option with good quantity and quality and at very affordable prices. But in recent past, the quality and quantity has gone done and the prices have gone up drastically. With so many joints opening nearby, it has lost the monopoly but downgrading it's quality & service and increased prices it's also losing it's loyal customers too. I can surely say I won't be going back again after my recent disastrous experience.

Once upon a time Blossom was one of the best chinese resturent in north kolkata.Almost everyday one could hardly get a seat without waiting.
Recently I with my friends visited there & we are getting shocked,No other customer was in the resturant except us.
Food are extremely high rated,and the quality of the foods are detoriate rapidly..
Over all Foods are overrated,and quality of food is also very low.

I was introduced to this place back in my college days, and I must say, I still like this place. Located in Hedua, near Scottish Church college, this restaurant is every college-goer's visit worthy. I have been to this place at least 4-5 times till date, and they haven't disappointed me ever. The food is cool, and the prices are quite decent as well. But the thing that attracts me most is the quantity of the food. There are few Chinese dishes that serves up to 12pieces, yes right, 12 pieces. That's really a lot. 

So, if you are planning on going to College Street, and wondering where to have your lunch, you can easily drop by at this place, and have some fulfilling food without spending much.

Though my last visit  was almost two years back, my memories recounted that the food used to be more cheap and the quantity used to be better, but nevertheless a nice restaurant. Decor is fair enough. Though the food quality could be improved as I personally believe it was much better previously. 

Do try out their Kati rolls,  they are brilliant. 

Pocket pinch of around 1200 for 3

 Half of the Special Pujo Menu was not being served at Nabami. One was compelled to choose from half-boiled noodles, overspiced rice and regular protein chunks in unspecified sauces. People who serve here are not ready to respond to your queries. Such service is not worth a penny of what you will end up paying here. Seriously NOT RECOMMENDED.

Total disappointment! No point in visiting this place anymore! Rubbish! No pictures of food were taken as they were too okayish!!!

Have been to blossoms quite a number of times but we went on panchami. The food quality was worst to bad. The service was also poor. When we ordered Indian food, they said they serve only chinese during the pujas. When chinese was ordered, they served it late. However that was considered. Now coming to the food... The noodles was good but the fried rice was extremely bad. It was smelly and in no way tasted like it. When of my friend complained about it to a waiter, his reply was.... As it is pujas, the food quality is not good... I mean who on earth replies like this? just because it is puja... They will serve bad food??  This sort of experience was not expected from blossoms.  Highly disappointed.

Blossom's at hatibagan is famous for its rolls and Kathi rolls.
I haven't visited inside of the restaurant yet . I have just had its rolls which by the way is oh so amazing.
You see the key to a perfect roll is directing the person who is making your roll to according to your needs and likes.
You direct them,they add ingredients according to your wish and Voilà your picture perfect roll is ready.
I just wish they hadn't put so much onions in my roll.
Nevertheless had a great experience at blossoms.
Looking forward to visit here again.

Standards going down down down...

Food: Had been a regular at this place in the last 4-5 yrs. However, visited this place recently for the sake of the old times. Ordered chicken momo, special Blossom noodles and Chicken with baby corn. Momos were fine. But the noodles and the side dish turned out to be absolutely bland and worthless.

Ambience: Located beside the hedua lake near the scottish church college on beadon street, this place is one of the oldest Chinese and north Indian restaurants of this area. Well maintained with nice paintings and lighting, this place used to be a very posh restaurant of this area. However, in my last visit, found the place getting a little shabbier.

Service: Staffs are pretty casual. Serving time is high. Cash n card accepted. 

Overall: Earlier used to be a nice place. Currently, lost its charm and hope it regains its lost charm soon.

It is One of the oldest restaurants in north Kolkata, frequented by young boys and girls from Scottish college. Blossom has been a popular choice of Chinese & North Indian cuisines, for a long time. The takeaway roll counter makes really mouth-watering egg/chicken rolls. The restaurant interiors are simple and cozy and the service is fairly okay. Takeaway food requires a longer waiting time though. The chinese dishes taste reasonably good, specially their prawn items like sweet & sour prawn or golden fried prawns, have very good quality big sized prawns. Since I am a regular at this restaurant for several years I would admit however that their consistency in taste & cooking has dropped a bit over the years. Previously it was much more superior in quality and taste. Nevertheless it still stands as one of the best restaurants among the other options available in and around Hedua/Hatibagan area.

Blossom's used to be a well known restaurant. It still is but the quality of the food is questionable at times. 
A dinner treat, a while back, ended with coke diluted with water. It took us by surprise and frankly, we were disappointed. This was unexpected. The quantity of the food has also reduced.
For those people, wondering whether to visit the restaurant or not, do go but don't expect too much out of it. Even so, you may actually enjoy your visit. 

They have roll counter which was north Kolkata best roll make.

Once upon a time it was one of the best restaurants in the 'hatibagan elaka'.It isnt that good now but still the foods served here is worth trying.Just recently I visited this place and i must is it is still worth going.The ambience isnt that good but the food is still good.
For food I will give this place 4out of 5
For service I will give this place 3out of 5
For ambience I will give this place 3.5 out of 5.
I will recommend you to try the hot and sour chicken soup,the vegetable chicken soup,the crispy baby corn,the hong kong chicken(its the best dish served here I guess),naan with the reshmi butter masala.
This place is worth trying.

We ordered..
Chicken tandoori full plate which includes 4 pcs
Coming to main course-
Mixed chowmien
Mixed fried rice
Schezwan fish
Chilli chicken and
Chinese choupsey

They make Baked fish which is just awesome.. but when i visited i didn't get it as they said that their microwave is not working..
Even for desserts Rangoli wasn't available..
They took time to serve..
And the waiter was full of attitude..
They have one waiter for 4-5 tables which makes it very difficult for the customer to ask and order.

I have visited this place uncountable no of times it's mostly crowded and especially on Sunday one need to wait for quite a while to get in.
Food is good and decent the portions they give are more than enough for 2 people.
They have wrongly listed the price for 2 as 450 rs coz it's not really that cheap. Should have 600-700 for 2.

This place is located near hedua park. From outside it doesn't look like a popular restaurant. When I reached the place, I doubted whether it was the original BLOSSOM. But it z big inside, air conditioned n well decorated. It has two sitting accommodations,  in the ground floor, as well as in the first floor.
Me with two of my friends paid a visit to this place on a Sunday evening during the rush hour. The service was a bit slow, may be because of the customer load!!
We ordered for reshmi kebab n chilli baby corn. Kebabs were awesome, so soft, just melt in the mouth. But the chilli baby corn was not up to the mark, u ll find better in many Chinese joints.
Now coming to the main course- we had mixed schezwan fried rice, blossom special noodles n garlic prawn. I will rate all of them a 5 out of 5. I was so pleased both with the quality n quantity. All these costed us around Rs.1500. So it z quite pocket friendly too.. 
Lastly, I will recommend u all to visit this place for once. It won't disappoint u..😀

Visited this place several times with friends. A nice place to hang out with friends. Coming to the food, was really delicious and their Chinese food is my favourite particularly. Baked fish is divine, and is strongly recommended. Other than this, Chinese noodles or rice are nicely cooked too and quantity is also generous, enough for two. Staff are gentle and helpful, decoration and sitting arrangements are nice. Price is affordable.

Located at Hedua, this restaurant offers Chinese and North Indian cuisines. Chinese dishes are tasty, though not comparable to the specialised Chinese restaurants. Had ordered "Mix Schezwan Chowmein" and liked it. I am absolutely in love with their KEEMA NAAN & KADHAI CHICKEN. It is absolutely fantastic. I suggestion, if you have tried Peter Cat's Chello Kabab, then please don't try it here, you're not going to like it. Blossoms have a roll corner outside, the rolls are tasty. In case you want a quick snack, you can give it a try.

Blossom is my all time favourite. I tasted their food when I was in school. It's a very popular resturant in north Kolkata and no doubt that's because of their food and their service as well. I really like their Chinese food. Go for Fried Rice or Chowmein and Manchurian Chicken or Chilli Chicken whatever you prefer as side dish. The quantity they serve is pretty good. Trust me you won't regret. Their snack items are also good. And last but not the least, their Chicken rolls are to die for!

Location: just opposite to the Hedua Park. 

Ambience: Yet nothing special to mention but not loudy or crowdy. 

Food: as this place is surrounded by many colleges there, so for students it could the best Chinese in their budget. I think that is their USP, otherwise I have experienced far better Chinese than this elsewhere.

This has been a part of our outdoor eating for more than a decade now. It serves Indian and Chinese cuisine pretty well. Their Chinese items are light and the quality has remained consistent all these years. The quantity of their dishes can easily be shared between two people. They introduced chicken pasta long time back and then discontinued suddenly. It was one of my favorite beside baked fish. I would be more than happy if the pasta is re-added into the menu as a permanent item :-) and yes sweetly remembering the vanilla with chocolate sauce in the end!!

Was regular at this place in my college days. Chicken cutlet was huge and tasty. Blossom special fried rice was loaded with chicken eggs mutton and prawns. Chilli prawns were my mother's favourite. With time it has evolved. First it was known for its rolls but now it is a well known eatery in north calcutta. It has a horrible home delivery system. You have to call them constantly to get their call. Chello kebab nd fish augratine was introduced which they stopped serving later on, dont know whether they have started it again pr not. I have many fond memories in this place.

Since I'm here in North Calcutta over a month  I have been to Blossom today. This is not the first time though. Since childhood we are going here but this is a review post renovation, my masi's treat!

Blossom is a hygienic, well-maintained, customer-friendly, 40 seater ac restaurant which prepares good Indian and Chinese cuisine. This is a personal favourite due to various reasons.

The portion they provide are always excess and you might end up taking parcel if you don't have a big appetite. They perfectly maintain their food standard, keeping quality into account. We opted for Kashmiri Polau, Chicken with veggies and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. All the dishes were of non-spicy series yet awesome at taste. This is a must try joint! The staffs are formal and cordial too.

Do visit! Happy eating!

The Ambience is ok , and the place is well maintained with respect to everything.
The food is super awesome , there food make them unique . I have tried there soups , mixed fried rice , mixed chowmein , Manchurian , almost everything in Chinese . There quality and quantity will both suffice you and won't pinch your pocket even .
They lag behind there service abit which needs to be checked . You cannot judge a book by it's cover , applicable for them even . 
Hence will recommend everyone to try this place for there Chinese 😊

While strolling along Bidhan Sarani during the wee hours of afternoon, my heart wanted to have the lunch away from home and hence entered into the "blossom" of peace and sanity.

Placing itself just opposite to one of the sides of Hedua Park, this place is a treat to mind and soul alike. The interior is well maintained and cutely decorated. The staff are extremely calm and well behaved. I used the term 'calm' because you will not see them rushing even at the peak hours and thus one feels at ease. Still, you will find the service pretty decent if not too quick.

The food and its taste are pretty normal and you can term them tasty. It isn't exceptionally out of the world, nor will you feel dejected. The price, considering it an air conditioned restaurant, is okayish. I am commenting on it tasting the Chinese cuisine. However, Thai dishes are available too, which I am yet to taste.

I would like to point out an incident what occurred while waiting for the food. The customer was meant to have been served Chicken Fried Rice, but, due to a miscommunication he was served a Prawn Fried Rice. On realising the error, they apologised numerous times and asked for replacement, but, the customer been kind informed him that he just wanted to make sure that it isn't someone else's order been served (hinting at us) and said he is comfortable with the Prawn, too. At the checkout, the waiter informed at the cash to charge for Chicken Fried Rice, though the Prawn (which they actually had) costs more. This particular gesture owned my heart.

After having our food which consisted of Chicken Fried Rice, Chow Mein and a side dish of Schezwan, experiencing the good hospitality we felt at ease. Taking all the positives vibes from the place, we made our way out.

Being located in such a good location surrounded with school and colleges it is almost overcrowded Everytime. They serve Chinese and Indian in very reasonable rates. Rolls are famous in North Kolkata. Blossom Special Mixed Fried Ride and Dry Chilli Chicken they served is good option for a meal in low pocket pinch indeed.

The food tastes moderate and as a North Kolkata restaurant, one need not worry about the decor. As long as it serves good food and maintains a soothing ambience, it welcomes good crowd. From college students to family, the menu has something or the other to offer everyone.

Its a cozy place with lots of seating. It has got a regular main seating area and another upstair seating area with cozy sofas and huge size tables!
Food is good quality according to price and quantity per plate is sufficient for two. Prices are pretty moderate with overall calm and nice ambience. Staff is courteous but sometimes food takes time to get served. Apart from that everything is pretty fine. You have lots to choose from the menu and it is pretty affordable. One of the most intriguing feature of this place is the thali concept ! There is a chinese thali and an indian thali that contains choices of different chinese dishes and indian dishes respectively  (which is a good combination of different dishes in one menu and is overly sufficient for 2 adults/kind of a buffet menu served on your table)! Overall a nice cozy restaurant, easy to locate, quality food and dining and is quite easy on your wallet ! Recommended !Manisha Das

Review: I went with a lot of expectations and hope, so that I can add a new eating destination to my bucket. I went for evening snacks at around 6-6.30. The interior was decent although it was a bit suffocating initially. We ordered simple chilli baby corn and chicken lollypop. The baby corn was ok types however the lollypop was not at all up to the mark. The vinegar was too much and added sourness to it. 
The coating was a bit on thicker side. Overall I was not satisfied with the good.

I guess you would rarely find someone who has been to this place more number of times than I have been. So please read the full review and have a great time :-)
Okay so first of all this restaurant has 2 parts:
(i) The take-away - Apart from the normal take away there is a counter specially for Rolls. The rolls here are too good, If you are a vegeterian go for the Paneer Roll... Whereas for others try the Egg Chicken...Its better than Chicken or Mutton roll...Don't go for doubles if you are not too sure as they are too heavy and almost equivalent to a meal.
(ii) The restaurant:- (The one in pictures)
This is one of the best places to have Indian in this region. The restaurant isn't that occupied because the area is specially filled with students who prefer having Italian or Chinese more. The Chinese is one area they can greatly improve on whereas you can choose almost any Chicken Dish and you will find it very good.
The staff here are nice and the restaurant is subdivided into 2 floors and you can sit wherever you wish. But do try and stick to the Indian dishes as that is what they are best at.

This place reserves many special memories. We have come here for a number of times during college days. Mainly specialises in Chinese food, also serves Indian. Prefer the first one. The starters are really nice. The staffs are friendly and courteous. Ambience is alright as well.

Nice place with good quality food.. The ambience of this place is good although if u sit in the first floor u may tend to feel a bit claustrophobic as the height of the ceiling is less . The quality of the food is commendable at this price range.

I visited twice over here
The quantity is huge
The food is avg
During my second visit on panchami 2016,  we orderee chicken sweet corn soup,  chicken friend rice and chicken manchurian
The chicken manchurian had an odour which we couldn't eat properly and the rice was below avg
Despite the good quantity the food isn't that much tasty and good for me

I guess you would rarely find someone who has been to this place more number of times than I have been. So please read the full review and have a great time :-)
Okay so first of all this restaurant has 2 parts:
(i) The take-away - Apart from the normal take away there is a counter specially for Rolls. The rolls here are too good, If you are a vegeterian go for the Paneer Roll... Whereas for others try the Egg Chicken...Its better than Chicken or Mutton roll...Don't go for doubles if you are not too sure as they are too heavy and almost equivalent to a meal.

Being the best in location since it is closest to the two great clgs of Kolkata, it attracts a good number of customers daily. Their tandoori chicken is worth mentioning..like the Chinese food served. Their roll counter is also great as it serves variety of rolls and prepares according to requirements.however the stuffs need to be well mannered and efficient.

Blossom is very popular among the college going youngsters of Bethune and Scottish Church. My sister took me fr lunch here once. The place was filled as it was on the day of an occassion. We had to wait outside and then share the table with strangers as there were no smaller tables. This was a little bit of a turn off for me and I hoped the food will change my mind about this place. We had ordered chinese- egg fried rice,hot garlic chicken and chicken hakka chowmein.  It was good. The portions of chicken and egg in the chowmein and rice were on the higher side. The food wasn't very oily which was a plus point. the chicken pieces in the gravy dish were big and not stiff. I have had lunch at restaurants during a festival/holiday when it was overcrowded and never have I been asked to eat quickly and empty the seats by a waiter. I found it really annoying. Overall,good food,rude staff.

The price is reasonable too and quantity is sufficient. I love the item Thai chiken specially in blossom. The good ambience and well mannered staffs also make your mood. Moreover in that are we have so many restaurants and hotels etc but I found this place is the best among those.

My favourite roll shop in Kolkata. Inspite long queues and huge crowd that envelopes this place in the evening, they manage to serve rolls in an organised manner. With a splash of lemon and masala on Raw onion, the filling of the roll comes alive. I absolutely love blossom rolls. I haven't really eaten the North Indian fare that they offer on the first floor. But yeah they do offer a proper seating area with regular north Indian cuisine.

Who knew chicken manchurian contains rotten fish?? Well in Blossoms it does !! We had ordered chicken manchurain for 28 people and all of then contained at-least 50 %  rotten fish and the entire dish smelled awefully bad !! All 41 plates of fried rice were smelling awfully bad ! 
When we confronted them about it, they refused to deal with it and  behaved very rudely .... 
Yes they may serve you good food when you are sitting there, but when you've paid them before hand, well there goes your money and appetite.

Located just at the crossing of Bidhan Sarani and Beadon street this is one of the busy restaurants of North Kolkata. Mostly because of its reasonable pricing and good taste. Although recently they have increased the prices but it still remains pretty within the range of people looking out for good food at economical pricing. 

Their dry chilli chicken is undoubtedly the most famous and selling dish. Today I also had chicken sweet corn soup, fish tandoori and plain Naan. Fish tandoori was tasty and unlike other restaurants they don't use dry chilli but they use green chilli paste. Naan was good and so was the soup. 

Probably the only saddening part is their management. There were 8 waiters which has come down to 2 now. Also 1-2 cooks have left the job thus increasing the pressure of service on the existing stuff and increasing the waiting time. Management seriously needs to address this issue if immediately if they don't want their brand image to go down the drain.

Surprised??? It takes my heart out to rate one of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata '1', but I have to do it in terms of righteousness. The food has always been sumptuous, filling, delicious and very moderate on the pocket.  I am personally fond of the place, as because it associates my college memories, all of us friends used to visit Blossoms, quite frequently, when we could save some pocket money. Especially, their kebabs and the baked fish platter was wonderful, the interior was beautiful, I do not know their present behaviour or rise in price, as because I am in US for the past 1.5 years and I have not visited them since. But the reason why I am rating this place '1' is because of their discrimination with human beings based on their clothing. They prohibit anyone inside, wearing a half pant or a bermuda, and I strictly protest a 'NO' against such orthodox and authoritative propaganda. A teenage girl, visiting the place with her family, wearing a capri pant was turned out; a friend of my husband, living nearby the restaurant, had been there to get a take-away in his home bermudas, and he was asked to leave. Just imagine! who gave them the right to insult anyone??? Disgusting! A public place, especially a restaurant, should welcome guests as the image of Laxmi and Narayan, we have learnt these values as a human being, and today, these management people of restaurants feel they own the area and its laws; they should be shown their place... They are businessmen, should do business, they should not try to be dictators of the society like in ancient days, the Brahmin priests used to be... :/ Neither did they gain anything, nor will these racial, and discriminating people like Mocambo and Blossoms. If they cannot respect humans they won't get any business.

I went only once. food is good and price is also reasonable.But The think that hurts me the most is the behaviour of the staff. The staff who serve the food is just literally begging for tips. They charged the service charge, vat and all after that its my opinion to give the tips or not. When I decided not to give the tips (because of his behaviour) then  he starts teasing me .
This is the horrible behaviour I have faced here. I would never suggest anyone to go there.

I used to come a lot here between 2012-2014. The used to make really good food, in good quantity. And that time the price was also reasonable, and we enjoyed evey visit here.
But recently they have increased their prices by a good margin. And the things are no more same. The quality has also gone down a bit.
Last time i visited they took about 30min to prepare the food. The staffs will give you a stern look if you don't tip them well. So the place now don't feel the same as it used to be few years back.

Blossom is one of those joints which has acquired a legendary status in north kolkata. Cheap and filling, this reminds me of the suburban restaurants that we grew up with. Not much to say about the food. If you belong to south Kolkata, you don't need to visit this restaurant. From North Indian to Chinese to so-called continental- they serve almost everything at a cheap price, so a very common eatery for north Calcutta college students. So, if you're a first year student in one of the north Calcutta colleges and you haven't visited blossom, visit you must!

The chicken and egg noodles we ordered did not have a gravy version , so we opted for hakka . The Schezuan chicken tasted good . The chicken clear soup here tastes good too . Overall , the food here is good , and value for money and the location makes it a popular choice for those Chinese cravings !

Located right at the beginning of a line of restaurants, opposite hedua park, blossom is also likely the best of all the restaurants in the line.
Ambience is good, although occasionally the stuff tends to be rude. The top floor is mostly closed off except during puja s or such rush times.
Food is great in terms of both quantity and quality. Value for money is also great. Chinese, Moghlai both cuisines are well made.
Tried American chopseuy, chelo kabab platter, Thai green curry, nans,reshmi kabab and other dishes including desserts several times.
Worth the money.

Blossom is a very common name among teenager of North Kolkata!!It is a very popular Indian and Chinese restaurant which is serving food @ affordable price for many years! It is also very popular restaurant among the students of nearby school and colleges! As a student of Scottish Church College, I visit this restaurant with my friends wherever there is an occasion like B'day trt or any kinda celebration!

Location is very easy. Just locate Hedua Park and then Bedon St. and you will find Blossom.

Ambiance is good enough. Dim lighting at background and focused light on table makes this place a perfect place for dating also! Service is quick, stuffs are all well dressed, well behaved and helpful enough to select the right dish according to your taste!

Recently I ordered Egg fried rice, Chicken Tikka Kabab, Chilly Chicken and Chicken Manchurian as a Home delivery! The delivery service was prompt, they delivered the food within 30min without any delivery charges! Foods were all well packed , so no issue regarding hygiene!

Chicken Tikka Kabab - 6 pieces Chicken was there and packed with Salad and chatney in an well manner! Chickens are little crispy from outside but juicy from inside. Overall good!

Egg fried rice - Well cooked rice with lots of little pieces of well fried eggs but less amount of veggies are there. Not so oily and tastes good! The amount was sufficient enough for two persons!

Chicken Manchurian - 10 pieces Chicken are there. All are juicy from inside and well cooked! Not so spicy but a good item as a side dish! The greavy is just finger licking, little bit of oily in nature but good!

Chilly Chicken - 10 pieces Chicken are there also! Well cooked and good size of chicken pieces are dipped into spicy oily greavy! Well fried onions, and green chillies are there in the gravy! Overall it tastes really good!

With all the food mentioned above, it cost near about 850INR. Donno why they add vat into it, when it is a Home delivery! But in conclusion, I can say, Blossom is a perfect place for dining and for home delivery also! From August 1, they raised the price for every dish, still it is a affordable restaurant, you can try!

I'll first mention my score allocation: I give half a point to polite and fast service, and quantity of food. And, since I have some fond memories of dining with my grandmother here, I can live with the fact that it gets 1 more point automatically.
I have been to this place quite a few times before - and considering the price, it was one of the best local eateries with a tried and tested menu and good quality, tasty food. I went today to relive some old memories. Sadly, I found that within a matter of less than a decade, it has completely fallen apart. The dining space inside is dark and dingy. Aside from the ground floor, it also has an interior balcony area, but since it was completely dark today, I assumed that portion is now closed, though I later saw a couple going up to sit. Another problem I found with the seating was that for tables and chairs that are fixed, there was an uncomfortably large gab between the two.
First of all, most of the dishes I ordered were not available, even though I went two hours after its opening time. That's one of the worst things that can happen to a foodie. Anyway, I ordered a plate of steamed momo and a chicken sandwich. First, momo. It had everything that can go wrong about a momo - its edges were hard due to overcooking; there was no special condiment and I had to use the chilli sauce at the table; the filling was EXTREMELY oily. It was flavoursome, but completely bland and unseasoned, and the chicken was overcooked and crumbly. The soup was plain water, with a smell of butter.
I thought that the momo dish was a disaster, until the sandwich arrived. Now how do you screw up a sandwich? I'll tell you. Their chicken sandwich had nothing but chicken inside - no mayo, no cheese, nothing moist. The sandwich filling had the taste and texture of chewed up chicken, I'm not kidding. It had NO seasoning smell or taste, and was mushy, dry and disgusting. I had a hard time swallowing it. After two pieces, I decided I couldn't torture myself anymore, and asked them to pack the other two. I mentioned that it had no seasoning. Unfortunately, the packed ones didn't have any added seasoning either. They didn't even cut the edges properly. I have already mentioned the only good things about the place. It saddens me that it's standard has fallen so low.

Now this was a restaurant was a surprise little package for me. I went in with little expectations and came out thoroughly impressed. The food here is excellent and it really doesn't make you feel that you've made an expensive investment. I suggest everyone here to try the mixed fried rice they serve here. It really is the unsung hero on the menu. This nice little place is definitely under my radar from now on.

Blossom is a restaurant which is very close to the heart of almost everyone living in North Kolkata ( vicinity of sovabajar and hatibagan ) .
People have come here to munch from their school days and you can still find people from all generation visitors this outlet now and then . Since i am from South Kolkata , I was only aware of its reputation but never really managed a meal . Today , i was in the vicinity and therefore finally decided to pay a visit .

° Location :- This restaurant is located opposite hedua park . Near to Scottish church college , if you are coming from girish park you can take a direct auto to hedua . Or if you are coming from sovabajar then you can go to star theatre and then a bus or tram . But the stoppage would be Hedua park .

° Ambience :- Okay so the moment I entered the restaurant i felt that the ambience is absolutely perfect for an eatery . They have this sofa styled seatings which is common in American cafes and the lighting is absolutely perfect . But when I sat down I felt that the sofas were really old and was without any maintenance .So that's where I believe they should really look ahead as an improvement .

°Food :- So I had heard a lot about the fact that blossom served good food , so this was an acid test for them to satisfy my appetite :p . We ordered the following :- 

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Tandoori chicken ( 3 / 5 ) :- Had high expectations but frankly i have had better at this price . The size was okay but i was expecting the meat to be tender but it was over grilled . My portion had burnt parts so I had trouble eating . But the flavor was spot on , and at the end it turned out to be average . Maybe it was one off , the people here must have had better tandoori chicken but for now it is 3 out of 5 for me .

2. Mixed fried rice ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- yes a huge rating because I absolutely loved it .No matter how much variety of food you eat , there is nothing better than a good old mixed fried rice.  And they got it spot in both in quantity and quality. It is sufficient for 2 . They served it hot , the dish had enough shrimps , chicken and egg pieces . I can't seem to remember any time when I had a fried rice with so many shrimp pieces . The chicken pieces had a distinct flavor i cant seem to forget . All in all a must try .

3. Half Manchurian chicken ( 3 / 5 ) :- Had 6 pieces of chicken dipped in red Manchurian gravy . But it didn't seem to tingle my taste bud.  The sauce was ketchupy and the chicken pieces were not soft . I am sure they serve better than this but you can skip this one .

4. Rangoli ( 4 / 5 ) :- after completing the wholesome meal , we opted for a desert not known to many . The rangoli is a very generous scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with syrups of different variety and flavors . The different red and green colors of the syrups make it a rangoli . It was a yummy experience and a nice way to end the lunch .

----------------------------------------------------------------

Now let me bring the verdict to the table . I donot know wether this is the popular belief because this is a very memorable place for many people but I think it's time they go for a makeover . The location and the size of this place , i think they have a lot if potential . At least they can improve the seating and go for a menu boost with the regular servings . This place could do a lot more with a magic wand touch . 

A special mention  should go to the person receiving the order and the service was very prompt and courteous . My first one is an average experience in terms of food but i am sure I'll go back for some more .

Blossom is one of the finest and popular restaurant in North Kolkata.

**Location**
It's near to the Hedua park. Nearest landmark would be Scottish church college.

**Experience**
It's an old favorite place where I used to come with my mother. I totally love this place for its food which is mind blowing. Chinese and Indian both the cuisine is available here. They totally do justice to their customer with good food and great service all together.

Must try :
Chicken Tandoori
Thai chicken
Szechuan Chicken
Fried rice

I personally like this place a lot and kind of recommend people to visit this place to enjoy the food. Pricing is reasonable compare to the quality and quantity. Value for money for sure :)

The restaurant is spacious but the tables are a little too high for comfortable eating. The blossoms special rice is delicious and so is their sezwan chicken. The chinese and indian thali has quite a number of items and is very very filling. The tooti-frooti is my personal favourite. the pricing has gone up though. The ambience is soothing but I wish the staff were a little more cooperative.
Tuck in!

Located opposite to the Hedua Park, a nice pocket friendly multi cuisine restaurant providing tasty food in good quantity and quality. They also have a roll counter with huge crowd of college students.
Amongst its dishes, I would say it provides the best Baked Fish in North Calcutta at such a low Price.

not at all satisfying. going there for a quick snack is fine but dinner or lunch is terrible. they have an "okay"-tasting biriyani. but the chinese is trash! they hav a cream-mushroom prawn dish, never eat that! it is soooo bad! tastes like cement in pulses broil and looks like dirty white precipitate of zinc! the food is cold and they take a long time to prepare that deadly-food!

Living in South Kolkata, I have never ventured much to the northern part of the city. My maternal uncles live in North Kolkata and I have heard a lot about Blossom from my cousins. Few days back my relatives took me to Blossom for dinner. It was Monday but the place was almost full. We were a group of four. Three of us had Chinese while my aunt had preferred to have something from the Indian cuisine.  So our order was an assortment of Chinese, Indian and Mughali cuisine.We ordered:
1. Chicken sweet corn soup
2. Chicken Reshmi kebab
3. Chicken Tandoori ( the pieces were huge) 
4. Chicken Fried Rice
5. Chicken Hakka Noodles
6. Chilli Chicken
7. Sweet and sour chicken
8. Tandoori Roti 
9. Mutton Rogan Josh 
10. Tutti Fruity
         All the dishes were very tasty and the quantity was more than sufficient. We had to pack half of our order. It is reasonably priced. The decor is simple. I had no place for dessert but my cousin insisted that I should not miss their Tutti Fruity at any cost. And she was right. It was delicious, full of fruits but very filling.

One of me or my foodie friend groups  frequent hand out dine place was Blossoms. We used to visit this restaurant for last three years , loved the kebabs and chelo kebab there and we used to end with trutty frutty. 
Now let me tell you how from the last three years distinctly they just dropped their brand. 
First the behaviour of staffs, they are not at all cooperative  to get their attention you have to struggle a bit and it'll become worse if you are in weekends. We can understand it's a busy restaurant and they are working whole day but a smiling gesture and good attitude can make it simple but they won't. 
Now about the food, they used to serve awesome kebabs but day by its getting worst to WORSTER (intentionally I used this ) last time we went they literally served us brunt kebab and when  we complained this they didt feel to give us a feedback . Trutty frutty should named with Raw papaya with vanilla ice cream , others fruits are hard to find.
Disappointment  !!!

The first negative point about this place is that have staff who are not at all cooperative and well-behaved! Not all of course! Keeping in mind, "Exceptions are not examples!", I visit this place because of it's delicious delicacies and moderately cheap rates. Recommended dishes are baked fish, pulao and butter chicken ! Must visit for College Street hoppers .. ;)

I've already been in many restaurants but this one is simply a class, I must say. Foods are undoubtedly tasty and prepared with fine care. Tandoori chicken is outstanding...so was the mutton rogan Josh. And the tootyfrooty made the night....it was jst awesome. And surprisingly the prices are also lower than any other places of same standard. The ambience is perfect. Service is also great. It's now in my frequently visited site's list.

Located opposite Hedua near Bethune college this place is famous for their Chinese dishes. The items are priced at a moderate level and doesn't really pinch your pocket and the quality of food is more or less average. The seating arrangement here is a bit uncomfortable if you ask me. And the waiters are quite slow in their service and taking orders.

Never really had the opportunity to dine-in here. I was a regular here for the succulent and delightful rolls. Light and flaky parathas with soft chicken portions. Blossoms were initially known for their rolls. It was perhaps sometimes in the year 2009 or 2010, that they came up with the restaurant. The place is flocked by the local residents as well as the college going lads from Scottish and Bethune.

I visited this place a while back. I was suggested by a friend of mine to try their chinese here.
The interior had a kind of retro look. The seating is not at all comfortable. Either they are too low or they are they are stiff and high.
The other thing which I hated about this place is the waiters are not at all courteous and the basic things like giving us the menu card or serving the glass of water took so long that it was more than 40 mins. Surprisingly the restaurant was almost empty.

But I ignored these these facts while i rated this place as the fried rice and the chilly chicken we ordered was very good and was in good quantity too.

I really liked it.

During my college days this used to be one of my favorite restaurants! It used to be completely full with college go-ers from both Bethune and Scottish. Getting a place here for lunch was basically an impossible task. Coming to the location it's right in front of the hedua crossing so it isn't hard to locate. The decor is a tad too dark for my liking. The food is absolutely amazing! Blossoms is mainly famed for its chinese dishes and i have no complaints as such for any of the chinese items and i usually make it a point to order from their chinese delicacies. There's one minus for me though, most of the days they've been out of almost all of their desserts and we couldn't really taste them. Apart from that, i love everything about this place! Also, i have a lot of happy Bethune memories here :)

Most of the staff over here have been over here for many years. The ambience is goodish, a bit noisy to my liking , they have a sitting arrangement upstairs even
Their tandoori chicken is great , though they dont serve biriyani , thats a let down for many , but on the contrary they serve continental, their chelo kabab can compete with many in the city.
Their tutifruti is also v good to taste

You better not try the Mughlai cuisine there...just because its not an Indian/Mughlai joint. Thr chinese is delightful. However the winner of the day was their Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream...

I really don't know what was I thinking when I decided to pay this place a visit coz clearly , it was not worth it!!!  
The food is okay, nothing great. So is the ambience. But the worst of all is the behaviour of the staff. To put it in simple words, they are RUDE!. 
We had ordered the starters and the main course initially and had thought of ordering the desserts later(which I usually do when I visit other restaurants). So, after finishing off with the main course, when we wanted to order for the dessert , the waiter came wearing an irritated expression and said, "Agey bolte parlen na?!" , meaning ''Couldn't you have said this before?!".... I was plain astonished at his attitude.
And... then came the dessert--a tooty fruity icecream which they had loaded with tasteless non seasonal fruits , and a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  
This was  the worst experience with restaurants in my life so far!!!

Located just beside the Hedua Park. (Where the park starts ! )

The ambience is good. Calm ! 
Seating arrangement is fine, with the dim lights lit.
BUT HOLD ON ! 
*All that glitters is not gold*

Had the Chicken Lollypop, Butter Naan and Chicken Bharta.
Chicken lollypop was not fried properly. It was informed to the staff.
'Lollypop deep fry kiya jata hai. Kaccha nahi hai yeh. Bass fry thoda kam ho gaya.' -This is what he exactly replied. 

Butter naan was fine. Chicken bharta again was disappointing. Generally, chicken is shredded here. Here, it was made into slices, sort of. 

Service is very slow. (For the above mentioned items, we had to wait for 20-25 minutes)

The staffs are not courteous. 

Overall, it's okay to visit. But then you may find some other good restaurants nearby.  :)

Gave my surprise Promotion treat by being my self surprise on the surprise that I got on that day!
I have tried to enter this restaurant last year 2015 on Christmas however it was impossible to get into the with such a long que. So today was the 2nd attempt and it was successful.
1st lets come to the Ambience - It was very good. Liked it with the sitting arrangements as well.
We went there already with a half filled tummy Courtesy Mio Amore! So we ordered lesser food.
Coming to food quality the Mixed chowmein was good with lesser chicken!! The sweet and sour Chicken was Average you can say. One of our veggie friend liked the Paneer item we ordered. Paneer Malaikopta to be precise. The veg fried rice was good. However,
The worse part is - The waiter demanded for a tips when I was about to pay the bill via card. It's a really pathetic experience and something's I've experienced 1-2 times only. I have him the tips but it is not appreciated!!!!!!
Looking at the same other reviews it's looks like the tandoori items are really good over here.
Anyways as the day has been special for me, so no hard feelings.
Would visit here one day again and will order more variety of foods.
Thanks.

The food is okay, nothing great. So is the ambience. But the worst of all is the behaviour of the staff. To put it in simple words, they are RUDE!. 
We had ordered the starters and the main course initially and had thought of ordering the desserts later(which I usually do when I visit other restaurants). So, after finishing off with the main course, when we wanted to order for the dessert , the waiter came wearing an irritated expression and said, "Agey bolte parlen na?!" , meaning ''Couldn't you have said this before?!".... I was plain astonished at his attitude.
And... then came the dessert--a tooty fruity icecream which they had loaded with tasteless non seasonal fruits , and a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  
This was  the worst experience with restaurants in my life so far!!!

Located just beside the Hedua Park. (Where the park starts ! )

The ambience is good. Calm ! 
Seating arrangement is fine, with the dim lights lit.
BUT HOLD ON ! 
*All that glitters is not gold*

Had the Chicken Lollypop, Butter Naan and Chicken Bharta.
Chicken lollypop was not fried properly. It was informed to the staff.
'Lollypop deep fry kiya jata hai. Kaccha nahi hai yeh. Bass fry thoda kam ho gaya.' -This is what he exactly replied. 

Butter naan was fine. Chicken bharta again was disappointing. Generally, chicken is shredded here. Here, it was made into slices, sort of. 

Service is very slow. (For the above mentioned items, we had to wait for 20-25 minutes)

The staffs are not courteous. 

Overall, it's okay to visit. But then you may find some other good restaurants nearby.  :)

Gave my surprise Promotion treat by being my self surprise on the surprise that I got on that day!
I have tried to enter this restaurant last year 2015 on Christmas however it was impossible to get into the with such a long que. So today was the 2nd attempt and it was successful.
1st lets come to the Ambience - It was very good. Liked it with the sitting arrangements as well.
We went there already with a half filled tummy Courtesy Mio Amore! So we ordered lesser food.
Coming to food quality the Mixed chowmein was good with lesser chicken!! The sweet and sour Chicken was Average you can say. One of our veggie friend liked the Paneer item we ordered. Paneer Malaikopta to be precise. The veg fried rice was good. However,
The worse part is - The waiter demanded for a tips when I was about to pay the bill via card. It's a really pathetic experience and something's I've experienced 1-2 times only. I have him the tips but it is not appreciated!!!!!!
Looking at the same other reviews it's looks like the tandoori items are really good over here.
Anyways as the day has been special for me, so no hard feelings.
Would visit here one day again and will order more variety of foods.
Thanks.

the restaurant's been around for many years now.  they provide really great Chinese, Mughlai & Tandoori.  you may be faced with a queue during weekends & holidays given their popularity.  although the restaurant is not very spacious, they have done a great job with their space utilization.  i am a great fan of their vegetable fried rice as am i for the rest of the stuffs they provide.

downside ??   
they will not allow you in if you are in your shorts (i figure there might have been some problem in the past, but they should've dealt with it in a different way.  banning shorts sounds too weird & diktat like)

This place should be awarded for their lip - smacking rolls!! The sauce they use has something magical in it. Eat a roll here once and you will never eat a roll at any other place again. The only problem with this place is, half of the day, the roll counter is closed, this is a real disspointment, they should have a fixed time to keep the shop closed!

Its really a good rated restaurant in North Kolkata. Their butter naan was really different from others. Thats very soft and well tated. I ordered Ginger chicken. Wonderful taste. Next I ordered their Chello Kabab. That is jus 1/4th priced than park street. But tasted really good if you can ask for steamed hot rice in ordering time. In my case they did not serve hot rice. But the kababs were really very good.

Overall love this restaurant for their ambience, behaviour, food quality and quantity

As per the environment is concerned, it is also good with in this budget. They serve the food within minimum time. So no long waits if you are too hungry :P
Which is a good part. But the only thing which is missing, a sit for just two people to have food.

A lovely place in a lovely position which actualy brings a great flavour of north kolkata. If you see this restro from the outside, you won't be able to judge what a lovely pleasure is waiting for you inside. This place gives me pleasure since last 7.5 years and hope this relationship still continues.. While we visited this place 4years back some of the waiters were very rude but, as time flies those things flies from thier mind as well and that would not actualy broke our relationship. We visited here once a month at least. Loved the ambience and also loved the food that are being served. Price in my opinion is quiet relevant in this era of price-hiking.

Oddly enough, this small restaurant gives a bit of that classy experience. Well dressed and polite waiters. Tried three of the kebabs they have in their menu. It was good. Can't say the greatest but the price is not heavy either. Crowd is a mix of college students and regular people. The sitting arrangement is quite comfortable. Fairly lit.

Located at Hedua Crossing opposite Bethune School and near Scottish Church College. Prices are reasonable but (legal) parking is an issue. And both my chilly babycorn and chilly fish were way too spicy for my liking. Ambience and service were decent, but the food itself was not that great. I understand some people prefer spicy food, but what's the point of making it so spicy and oily that it's a tough task to even consume all of the food? Chinese restaurants at Hatibagan (a KM away) are a safer bet if you're roaming hungry in north Kolkata.

I have many memories with blossoms. Just beside my college, Bethune. We used to rush for kathi rolls as one has to stand for a long time and the break was only of 30 mins. Kathi rolls are famous. And when you are inside, chicken tikka butter masala, chicken reshmi butter masala is a must with tandoori roti. This place will always stay close to me. Nice ambience,polite staffs.

They are like my 2nd home . So many memories . So many dinner . I will never forget this one . Its gives a good ol vibes every time I visit there . The staffs are old and experienced .

The ambience . Well no fancy decor no fancy light . Just simple plain restaurant . Overall comfortable 

Well about the food . The maximum time I visited blossom for its tandoori chicken . They made amazing tandoori chickens . I've had every single item on the menu but nothin'  can beat that. And apart from tandoori we like to order chicken 65 Cause they r spicy and Thai chicken cause they use little baby mushrooms , olives , broccoli....and also I live their American Chop suey . 

When I used to visit blossom the food is cheap and so called student friendly . 

You may not like the food as much as do but hey , I love blossoms . 

P.S. You should also try their trooty fruity ice cream :)

North Kolkata's one of the most famous Lover's Point is Hedua & just beside that Blossom is already there to feed the love birds of this place. I was there for one of my friend's birthday party.

Location : Blossom is located just beside the Hedua Park front entrance. Its easy to reach here from Vivekananda Road or Hatibagan.

Decorations & Ambience : Blossom is not that small from inside. It can easily fit more than 70-80 people at once where it also includes sittings from the 1st floor. Both cabin is Air Conditioned & connected by stairs. Comfortable sofas are there to make you relax & have your food, where every table can handle maximum of 6 people at once. Decorations & lights are very old fashioned but elegant on wooded walls. The black & white paintings & some small decorative wooden statue are the things that invites old school environment. Dim Warm White lights makes the environment pretty romantic too. But unfortunately some of the painting focus lights flickers, so it shows they doesn't maintain decorations regularly. Overall clean, hygienic & nice ambience just like you want it to be.

Stuffs & Management : Waiters are well dressed, well behaved & do serve you in good way. Their service is fast too even at opening times when we visited.

Chicken Hariyali Kabab : We took it as a starter. There was 6 pieces of chicken in a plate that looked pretty rich with lots of green leaf sauce on it. Lite fragrance of it impressed us well. It came with another sauce that was of sweet, sour & ginger mixed together but I didn't liked to dip my Kabab to that at all. The chicken pieces were small & little hard but enough soft to chew, feel the test & gulp it. It was kind of Resmi kabab with the added green leaf sauces & spices. It was making this Kabab tasty & I liked it well.

Butter Nan : The nans came in a foil wrapped basket. The first impression was smell, the rich buttery smell impressed me a lot. The sizes of Nan was big enough to fill a large hungry stomach. It was soft & rich in fragrance but the perfect amount of butter used was making it really good to taste.

Paneer Butter Masala : It was very lite on taste. It matched well with butter nan. Paneer pieces were not  fried well, neither the gravy was rich but it felt smooth in mouth. Compare to gravy very less paneer pieces were there in this dish.

Chicken Fried Rice : The fried rice came into a curry pan rather than bowl. The rice grains seems good, but it doesn't smelt well to feel its presence. Very less vegetables were used for the fried rice but good amount of chicken pieces & eggs were there. It was also very lite on taste so you may need some rich gravy item to enjoy this. It was not very oily too.

Thai Chicken : The Thai Chicken came into a bowl with lots of vegetables on it. The gravy was very rich with lots of fried red chillies. Chicken pieces were soft but it was not well marinated with the gravy, so it was hard to find the same taste from inside of the chicken. Vegetables felt very good with fried rice & it tasted on the sweeter side. Although its a Thai dish neither I found any Basil leaf fragrance nor the richness of Thai dishes. The over sweetness of the dish was killing all other tastes of it. But somehow it was enjoyable to taste.

Garlic Chicken : The Garlic Chicken was with smooth gravy. It looked rich. Chicken pieces were soft & it seems that they do use common chicken pieces for their every chicken items. There fore lack of marination makes it hard feel the taste from inside. This dish also tasted to the sweeter side I didn't know why. But somehow I liked it with the fried rice.

Szechuan Chicken : Its a dish that should be very spicy & chillies. But somehow their Szechuan Chicken seems Sweet & Sour Chicken to me. I was bit surprised because their every chicken dish I had tasted were on the sweeter side. Although the chicken pieces that were used was of the previews dishes so it was soft but the taste of the gravy doesn't came from inside. The dish looked very rich & I was kind of liked the new sweet taste of Szechuan Chicken.

Rolls : I had tried their outside roll counter many times & I must say they do make some authentic rolls. Their paratha for the rolls are thin & long. It was not so crispy fried but well fried. The main thing hides into their pouring of the rolls. For veg roll they make a very good pouring inside it with lots of vegetables that feel good every time. Also for Chicken & Mutton rolls the pieces  were soft every time I tasted it.

Pricing : For all of the above mentioned items & for 6 of us the bill was Rs. 1672 in total. The pricing of most of the items are very common with the nearby restaurants of that area. Most of the dishes lied between Rs. 100 - 150. Seeing the quantity & quality I would say it a well priced tag. On the other hand Rolls are very affordable & well priced.

Conclusion : Between too many options available at Vivekananda Road & Hatibagan, Blossom do bless your food experience well. With good quality foods & some unexpected taste of those for a good price at a comfortable dining Blossom is hard to ignore.

The lighting is all very good and place is nice, but cleanliness is an issue. Cockroaches run around the eating area and the staff are not exactly friendly. The prices are really good and pocket friendly. Plus they give a great amount of food, so much that one plate of the Chinese thali is more than enough for two adults. Food tastes good, the baked fish is truly awesome.

The most awesome place to have really good food at a reasonable price.
The waiters are good natured, the ambiance is very good,just that the restaurant is not so big.
It us good enough for a group of six people.
They offer Chinese and Indian Cuisine which are of great taste.
For an advice don't go there alone as what ever you order they will give so much that it's very difficult for one person to finish that much,but if you finish then you can always take the leftovers as parcel.
I am going to this place since my school days,tge place never disappoints me.
They make the most awesome Chicken and mushroom dishes.
Just visit this place and U'll be amazed to have their awesome foods...

Blossoms used to be a very reputed restaurant in northern parts of our town but sadly it has lost it. Ppl still stream in her for frankly lack of proper competition so they also didn't cared to escalate there service with time.
Ambience: Aesthetically nothing much. Spaces are also cramped specially the gallery tables. The restaurant still looked the same( I last ate here 2 yrs ago)
Food: Used to serve good food but this time it was not so. The quantity n taste were lacking.
Service: Nothing significant. Not the warmest service.
Price: Pretty average. Still I wd say higher for the food they serve.
Overall an average place with an above average past reputation but need to rejuvenate soon

Before GST, it had been levying service taxes even on parcels/ takeaways which was ILLEGAL. But now it has stopped the practice. 

My personal favorite from this restaurant in North Indian dishes is Chicken Bharta. Delicious, but barely enough for two people. Their Tandooris, kebabs are very good. Fish tikkas are a must have. 

Among chinese its chicken fried rice and gravy noodles. Enough for two people, laden with vegetables. Don't forget to ask for packets of vinegar and chilli sauce packets IF they don't provide it in the chinese takeaways (they always do). It is well complemented with their chilli chicken, and also a lot of other chicken sides. Chicken sweet corn soup is also good

Their roll counter used to be great but since the change in the staff, I'm not sure if the rolls' taste as good as before. Fatso's has eaten into a significant chunk of their rolls' patrons. Their service is quicker if you place the order on phone and pick it up yourself instead of waiting for delivery. With

This was my first visit to this place. I had heard a lot about it from my friends, saying it is one of the most student-friendly places in Kolkata. And today's visit showed me how right they were. The decor and environment is pretty decent. We were 3 people and had a reshmi kabab, masala kulcha, tandoori roti, butter nan, chicken butter masala and chicken do pyaza. The amount was pretty satisfactory but the bill was so amazing! :P So much food cost only 667/- . Definitely going back again :)

I have been visiting Blossom since my Presi days. A great multi-cuisine restaurant, one of the rare ones that serve delectable Chinese and Indian dishes. My personal favourites are their Chilli Mutton (Chinese Section), Keema Naan and Tutti Fruity Ice-Cream and Chicken Roll at the Take Away counter. When in North Calcutta and in doubt, I'd pop in with my eyes closed!

Located just beside the main road, this place wasn't difficult to find at all. The ambience of this place is fair, nothing exceptional but suits our fancy. We, five severely hungry souls, ordered for Dry Chilli Chicken, Pepper Chicken and Fried baby corn as starters. The quantity of all the three dishes was more than I expected. The Pepper Chicken was the star of the lot. The Chilli chicken was pretty decent too. The baby corn though, was a little dry, not totally up to the mark.
Then we ordered for the main course. Chicken ChopSuey, Chicken fried rice and Garlic chicken and Schezwan chicken as side dishes. The ChopSuey didn't disappoint us in either taste or quantity. The rice, however was slightly undercooked; the quality of it not very good. The side dishes were great. Even though I am not a great fan of the Schezwan sauce, I was impressed by the taste. The garlic chicken was decent too.
The price was well within our budget: 1435 bucks including taxes.
One major negative thing about the place-The waiters are not friendly, borderline rude even. And despite all the VAT and taxes they expect more tips and when not received they pass comments. That's a definite mood spoiler.

Overall a good experience. Will definitely visit again.

A decent place to visit only if you live around Hedua area. Food was just alright. Tried both Chinese and North Indian variety, I would say their North Indian dishes tastes better than the Chinese ones. Price is fairly decent given the quantity of food. Only recommended for casual dining, mostly for college students who have limited budget.

Loved the ambience at first sight.Dim lights and Chilled windows is a sight worth waiting for.Tried the Chicken Chopsuey on one occasion and steamed Chicken Momos on the other.Totally good food,hospitability,hygeine and Maintainance.But Chicken products have a further scope to shine.Chopsuey tasted slightly bland,and momos had really big calories.
Hop in for a fin eve at this Diner.
P.S.-adjacent take-away shop is a heart throb too,for its cheap prices and totally good food

Comfortable cozy place located at hedua. Crowded usually, you'll have to wait for your table. Food is very good over here and also the quantity is more than sufficient, rather to suit the hungry you. Ambience is average. Really liked the crispy chicken starter. One chicken noodles is sufficient for two people. Butter chicken is good. And for dessert, try Twitty fruity.

Blossom hedua is a common and famous place for college students and young generations due to their cheap and good quality food. I am a regular visitor of this place and I would say that it serves the best north Indian and Chinese food in this region ( rajabazar - hedua ). The quality and quantity is moderate and more than enough for two hungry soul. Ambiance is good ,waiters are well trained but need more efficient to handle a huge number of crowd during peak hours.

Food quality is good. Ambience is perfect. But the behavior of the waiter plays a spoiler here. They don't know any manners. I remember a waiters name Raju..he should be thrown out of the restaurant. Dont know basic etiquettes. They lack hospitality. Otherwise food is good. Specially you should try the chicken tandoori.yummy..

It is the go-to place for me and my bestie whenever we want great Chinese food. The food here is very good and the quantity and quality is taken care of very well. It's also very affordable. I've tried the red hot garlic chicken and the hongkong chicken and I loved both, but the latter better! The best part is that they give 12 pieces of chicken which is very rare and which increased my love for this place. The fried rice here is very tasty and if you're short on cash, try their Thalis. They're very good and cheap! The ambience of this place is soothing and that is why we keep coming back to this place! :)

Blossom is situated just beside my college near hedua park. I have chicken roll from blossom whenever I'm hungry during my classes and it tastes awesome. Their rolls can give a serious competition to the best roll corners in the city.
I have been dining at blossom since the last 1 year but I haven't written any review of it. So here goes the review of my today's experience. The restaurant has a pleasant ambience. The sofas are cozy and the interiors have certain paintings.

I generally prefer Chinese over here which is excellent and the best you would get in and around hatibagan. My recommended dishes are chicken fried rice, chilli chicken, Manchurian chicken, schezwan chicken and above all the Thai chicken which I had today. 

I had chicken Hakka noodles with Thai chicken. The noodles were tasty and one plate was sufficient for two of us. The Thai chicken was too good. It had twelve chicken pieces in a tasty and spicy gravy along with veggies, broccoli, babycorn, etc. It was lovely. Till date I always had the chilli chicken here but from today I'm always going to have the Thai chicken here. Its highly recommended.

Overall, blossom is the best restaurant for having chinese food in the whole hatibagan, shyambazar area. They excel in terms of quality, quantity and comfort without making a hole in the pocket.

After a long time I visited this restaurant. The familiar cosy ambience was welcoming. We ordered mixed noodles, thai chicken and chicken with mushrooms. Thai chicken tasted good, mildly spicy in red gravy. Chicken with mushrooms had lesser mushroom more onions in a white gravy. With time they have increased the price but food quantity remained same. In dessert we took tutti fruity. It has nothing special to mention with papaya and pear in vanilla ice cream. All in all a good place to spend with friends and family.

Blossom is located in Hatibagan.I have visited this place two weeks ago.It's a good place for hangout. They serves quality and decent foods.I like their vegetable fried rice, it was wonderful. Fried chicken is mouthwatering, Manchurian is also impressive. But,noodles are not up to the mark I feel.
Ambience is appealing with modernised inferiors , staffs are also well behaved.If you are looking for excellent chinese food in pocket friendly range then try it.

COCKROACH! 

YES! 

YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT!

I found a COCKROACH in my food!

It was on 13th August ! on my BIRTHDAY!

And I got a BRILLIANT GIFT from the BLOSSOMS RESTAURANT!

I was a frequent visitor of this place but till 13th! 

I ordered MIXED SCHEZWAN RICE, FISH MANCHURIAN. 

Now , listen, I found A ROASTED COCKROACH in my RICE!

the FISH was SPOILED totally. 

Still the manager of the hotel had the audacity to charge me the bill of the TENGRI KABAB that I had ordered as starter. All in all, I am never ever going to visit this place again! and none of my friends too. hope you guys wont as well.

One of the most trending restaurant in North kolkata.. Located just adjacent  to hedua Park, the decor is quite simple and ambience is comfortable.. 

Food come at cheap prices and good quantity. Quality is decent too.. The highlight  of the restaurant  is probably  it's Chinese combo n can serve two easily.. Their baked fish is delicious.. 

I would have given them 4 but one thing I dislike is they have a specific  dress code  and it's utterly  a disgrace standing at 21st century..

Favourite food place for the students of North Calcutta. This is situated at such a place where there are many eminent schools and colleges so mainly students visit this place as the price is very cheap and quantity is incomparable with any other resturant but the quality of the food is getting worse day by day. Still if you want to give a treat to friends and budget is low give this place a try. They serve very good rolls too.

Ambience: The place is well crowded and we had to wait for 5min to get our seats. The decor is nothing special bt nothing to complain about.
Food: We had ordered plenty of food from north indian to chinese. We had to wait a lot to get the special kebab platter. Bt it was soo good. Quantity of all the dishes were plenty. The special fish was a delight and came wrapped in a fried egg. Typical indo-chinese taste that we love so much :p
Overall: A budget place which offers huge quantity quality food. I give it a thumbs up!!

This place is a saving grace to satiate your Chinese & Indian food cravings when your pockets are almost empty. Nice and simple interiors with cosy sofas. This place is visited by a lot of couples & also by groups of friends or families. 

Coming to the food, the Chinese preparations like Chicken Sweet Corn Soup and Chicken Fried Rice are extremely delicious. This underestimated place serves one of the best Chicken Fried Rices that I know of. The Chicken Hakka Noodles & Chilli Chicken are decent as well. But I personally dont like any of the other chinese side dishes they offer as I find them to be too sweet for my liking. Among the Indian dishes, the Tandoori Chicken is okayish (it will taste good if you are on a low budget ;) ), the Chicken Reshmi Kebab is good. The Chicken Tikka Butter Masala & the Mutton Kasha are two very tasty main dishes. The naans are soft & huge. The Vanilla Ice-cream with Strawberry Crush is not bad either.

The service is good. The only one thing I dislike about this place is that they do not allow people wearing shorts & bermudas to enter the restaurant & they even have a notice board mentioning this.

All in all, this place will ensure that you can have a good meal, especially when the rest of the restaurant world seems too heavy for your pockets ;) :)

Visited this place on a weekday afternoon...when it was almost empty...ambience is average...quite old..
Coming to food,we tried
Blossoms Special Soup-If you are a health freak,this is the soup to go for since it is very light and contains sumptuous amounts of meat and vegetables..tasted good too.
Crispy Chicken-quite crispy and tasty enough...the quantity being huge...I could just go on eating more.
Szechuan Fried Rice-a bit too...but will be loved by all those who are inclined towards spicy food.
Thai Chicken-This was average..and I didn't find it cooked well enough

We wound up with Tutti-Fruity ice-cream which was quite good..sufficient amounts of ice-creams,fruits and jellies..I found this the best amongst all the other items we ate.

The Chicken Tandoor is great(they have this cubicle in the entrance where they are seen making kebabs).
The kashmiri pulao/Sahi pulao is a must try during winter.
There is a college crowd almost always.The chicken roll is good and is cheap too.
And lastly their best(undoubtedly) - The Bake Fish.Yummy.......it's a must try.But try to avoid it during summer.
Rs 1000 is enough for 3-4 people.

One of the best restaurant I have ever visited. It was the last day of my sem,and naturally I was in excessive happy mood to celebrate it,so my friend took me to this place. The ambience is too good. We ordered for pepper chicken,thai chicken,sch. Fried rice mixed and ice cream at the last. But when they say that the amount of food will be too much for too,trust them. Though we both were too hungry,coudn't finish up the food. The service just took my heart,like when we were ordering so much,they might not have warned us to take less,but they did and their behaviour is too impressive. Regarding the food,from starter to dessert,was a nice experience. Want to visit them again.

The behaviour of the staff out there is too rude. Although this place is 2 minutes away from my college gate, I avoid going to this place mainly because of the arrogant nature of the staffs. This place is not a very good option to enjoy your meal.

Blossoms is all time favorites for north people, specially for college student. Since my school days I have been visiting this restaurant  with parents and friends. The best thing about this place is their consistency of standard,quality and quantity at reasonable price. I always feel like home over here. Good place to have kebabs and  Chinese food in comparatively lower price than the big huts available in other parts of the  town. 
And also their roll counter, it is surely packs a punch to the other bigwigs around the city.

Went there with my friends! Had seen a lot of good reviews so expectations were high & boy did they lived up to it! We had ordered Chinese food mailnly with mixed fried rice and mixed chowmin being the main course with there chicken side dishes! The quality of food was awesome as well as the quantity. The service was great too. The price if the food were not very high in comparison to the quantity and quality. The ambience was nice too! This was my first visit there nd I can say many more visits will follow. Would recommend to all my friends!

Blossom used to be our saviour during our college days as it was located near our college. So whenever we wanted to try chinese food Blossom would be our destination. I loved the chicken soup available here and also the chicken 69 and dry chilly chicken.  Among the main course dishes I particularly liked their szechuan fried rice. There is nothing great in the ambience... it is a typical north kolkata food joint which serves the staple chinese food.

This is a huge crowd-puller in the Hedua park area. They are low in prices,generous in portions and have a respectable ambience,a combination that's guaranteed to bring people in.
I'd personally recommend their chinese fare because their north indian mains never worked for me. Their tandoori kebab is a hit,though...and so is the tutti-fruity ice cream.
A word of advice: NEVER experiment here. I once had a foo-yung here and it was hideous!

We had to wait in the que for around half n hr, while our turn came to occupy the table.. food served, and man!!!!!!!!

Today I've been there with my friends for lunch.Blossom is most popular restaurant at north kolkata.Chinese & north indian both items are available here.Blossom is located at Hedua Park,crossing of Bidhan Sarani & Abheananda Road.I had decided that today I'll be taste here their north indian food,but when I entered this restaurant their staff told me that any north indian dishes are not available now.So chinese is only option.Ambience is good.Atfirst we ordered chicken Hot & sour soup & crispy chicken as a starter.After 5 minutes the food has came.Chicken Hot & Sour Soup is tasty & spicy.Crispy chicken is also tasty.It has 12 pcs chicken.Then we ordered two plates Egg-Chicken Fried Rice,one plate Egg Hakka Noodles with half plate boneless chilli chicken & half plate garlic chicken.Quantity of noodles & fried rice both are very good.One plate is sufficient for two peoples.If you are a big foodie like me then one plate is sufficient for one.Egg-chicken fried rice & Egg Hakka Noodles both are delicious.Chilli Chicken is tasty,but garlic chicken is not so good,gravy of garlic chicken is too much sweet.Atlast we ordered two 300 ml cold drinks.Staffs are polite & well behaved.Service is fast.Price is very reasonable.Next time I'll try here their North Indian food.

Awfully bad waiters! 
I had always gt good recommendations for this restaurant frm close frends. Been there once:  loved the food, the ambience and came back happy. Next time referred the resto to few frends. We all came together.  Ordered a full plate tandoori chicken, rotis, mutton do piyaza n finally tutti fruti. The waiter who was serving us was very rude! His behaviour was very intimidating! The bill amounted to rs 805. We paid by card n came out n gt curt comments frm the same waiter who said indirectly to the others that he wondered y ppl lyk us visited restos. We ignored the comment bt as we were coming out he remarked loudly frm the 1st floor to the doorman that he should not allow such ppl to enter the resto! Such was the behavior of a waiter! Is  paying a tip mandatory? Y do we pay the service taxes then? I always thought a tip is paid because the customer is satisfied with the food n the service.  If I m nt satisfied, y should I pay? Finally, paying a tip is the choice of the customer, not the decision of the waiter or the resto!

Blossom is located in beadon street adjacent to hedua park..This is one of the older and more popular restaurants in this part of kolkata..
They are known for serving quite tasteful indo-chinese dishes apart from the usual indian spread..also their rolls are quite popular and wholesome..
The interior is quite spacious and comfortable..the service is satisfactory..
Coming to the food:
Chicken Tandoori: It was nicely done..marination was perfect..and charred to the right degree..
Mixed Fried Rice: Two portion sufficient for three unless you have an extra large appetite,good portion of proteins,only the quality of rice should be better..
Red Hot Garlic Fish: The quantity was literally huge and enough for three people,however one word of caution don't order this dish unless you love too much chilly and pungent flavour in your food..literally have tears in our eyes..
Hong Kong Chicken: This tasted better, though spicy as well, a bit milder..
Overall the cheque comes to around 1000/- for three of us..Definitely you can give it a try as the food is delicious as well as economic..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 2.5/5

Food-really good.i have tasted tandoori chicken (unique taste, quite different from what I had in mughlai restaurants.worth trying)..baked fish (definitely good taste.one of their signature item.a diet-killing dish, laden with mayo, cream)..garlic chicken (very good.no over-dose of garlic)..chilli chicken (as usual)...manchurian chicken (vintage kolkataiya thai dish)..mixed fried rice (DONT order this.mutton shreds in this dish stinks a lot)...chicken fried rice (very good.one of the best I've had)..onion kasew fried rice (definitely worth trying)..mutton rogon josh (they serve it in a tiny balti, , excellen taste)...tooti frooti ice cream (thumbs up for this one)

Price-reasonable, ideal place for college students

Service-good.prompt

Overall-irrespective of day, month, time, you have to wait for at least 30 mins before getting a seat.its because of inco-ordination & mismanagement. However, because of taste & pricing it is worth visiting repeated times

Fish is great here. Specially the baked fish. We also ordered a plate of chicken tandoori that was nice. But the mixed noodle with gravy was a disaster... So except that medium bump..its a nice place to go to. And by the way its pocket friendly as well. All in all I would give this restaurant a 7 out of 10.

I love Blossom! They make one of the best chicken rolls in all of Kolkata, and their non-veg Indian thali is an insane amount of yummy food for the price. I am yet to try their Chinese dishes, but my experiences with moghlai and Indian have been very satisfactory. Ten points for location and accessibility, a hundred for just the pulao, and I cannot count how many to award their chicken bharta. Everyone flock to Blossom before the weekend ends!!

The place is not one that looks fantastic but watever we have ordered till date is mouth watering. Right from chilly chicken and chicken fried rice to chicken bharta, chicken tikka , chicken reshmi kabab and masala, baked fish. Try any of these and you will not be disappointed. Just a mention that this place serves one of the fluffiest naans in town.

The first really weird thing that caught my eye about this restaurant was the notice outside the entrance prohibiting entry of girls into the restaurant in shorts and skirts. ! I dunno why they put up such a preposterous thing.
Anyway, coming to the restaurant, its a nice place, warm lighting, comfortable sofas and all - all that is required. The food was quite good. We only tried the chinese dishes , they come in good quantity ( a full bowl of garlic chicken comes with 12 pieces! ). So I was very happy with that. They aren't overpriced. I will definitely be going there again to try their mughlai and north indian cuisine.

The most over-rated restaurant that you can find in North Kolkata.Ambiance-Not so much to talk about.Has a pleasant place but half of the time the first floor is closed.And the service is also not 

fast by any means.Food-I had eaten at he first day when it opened.For the first few years it served quality food with good quantity like Singapore Noodles,Cantonese Noodles,Thai chicken or in Indian side like Tandoori chicken,

Nun,Mutton Roghan josh(serves in a small bucket which is innovative) and tutti fruity for desert.But after the first few years the quality of food came drastically and the price went up in the same manner.

It is a good place to give a treat as it will serve food with good quantity but the quality is not up to the mark.And also it has one unique rule to not give permission to enter if a male person not wearing a full pant which is ridiculous in this modern age.

Possibility the worst restaurant I have ever been to. Been here twice. Ever time entered hungry and left cursing. Food is so so. Like any other restaurant u find at the corner of the street. But the worst part is there behaviour. The guard the waiter act as if they r serving u free food. And one more warning don't wear any thing which keeps your knee exposed. Becouse they wont inform you that they have a dress code. They will just stop you at the gate and tell u to **** ***. Most embarrassing dispointing and annoying experience ever. Please avoid at all cost.

Very conveniently located, Blossom serves mouth-watering dishes from chinese to indian delicacies. I absolutely drool over their chicken momos. They are just ssooo good..with generous proportion of chicken filling cooked to perfection! Their tandooris and fried rice varieties are also satisfying and delicious. Prices are quite pocket-friendly. A must-visit for all, specially students of college para! :)

I visited Blossom in 2014,during durga puja. Went there to have dinner with friends.
Though the restaurant was crowded that time because of durga puja,but still we had a very nice expirience!
The ambiance was nice & cozy! Sitting arrangement was very comfortable.
Now,about the food.We were total 6 in number.We ordered mix veg soup,egg chow,mixed rice,naan & Chicken Reshmi butter masala.
The soup was good. Not very spicy,not very plain either. Egg chow was little bit oily though.Mixed rice was good.The naan was so so...
But who stole all the lime light was the Chicken reshmi Butter masala! Nice,soft,flavourful chicken kebabs soaked in a rich delicious gravy! Yummm! Do try it!

And last but not the least.. the price! you can see the menu chart here. So you already know. ;) But tao bolbo... the price here is very pocket friendly! Satisfied! :)

We had chicken tandoori and it was more than what we expected considering what we spent. Rs. 200 for a full plate of chicken tandoori (4 pcs.) is waaaaay better than one could imagine now. Simple and sober ambiance; though it was a little crowded today; but that's acceptable considering the occasion. Maybe it was because of the tremendous pressure, but I didn't like their service much.

I was treated here , despite being very far from my place , i was eventually persuaded by my girl to go. Its not exactly what one would call a fine dine restaurant from the outside, but from the inside its quite chique.

We were 6 persons, we ordered for chilli baby corn as starters which was  ample in quantity and tasty. For mains we ordered 2 mix fried rice, chilli chicken, thai rice, 2 sweet and sour chicken and one chicken fried rice, we also ordered one hariyali kebab. Service was prompt and the kebab was served first, 6 pieces which were tender and succulent. Then the main course was served, the quantity is so much so that one plate can satiate 2 average persons. The rice was loaded with prawns, mutton, chicken in ample quantity, the sweet n sour chickn was soft and the gravy was light in consistency like saucy but delicious. I dint try the chilli chickn as i was alrdy too full, the decor is nice and ambiance is calming.

The bill for 6 came at 1646 which was pretty economical for all that we ate.

The restaurant that we all grew up having food from. 
Since College Street seriously lacks inexpensive eateries for students on a budget, we came to blossom quite frequently. 
The food was fantastic, especially the grilled fish. The quantity always brought a smile on our faces. And the prices were downright ridiculous. 
To this day blossom remains one of our favourite eateries.. Highly recommended

Located right in front of the main gate of Hedua Park, Blossom is still a big hit among the locals and college students for its rolls. The ordering process is a bit tricky and tedious. Go inside the restaurant, pay the amount first and person sitting at the cash counter will give a paper token which you have to give to the chefs and they will keep it in a queue with other such tickets. You may have to stand out for long as this place becomes crowded in the evening. The situation worsens if you try to customize your rolls and request the chefs not to add green chilli or sauces. The crowd behind gets impatient, chefs lose tempers and you'll find yourself in an awkward situation. It's here I've tasted the best Veg Roll of the city. I'm a person who will never try veg food when he's eating out. But this is one of those rare places where I had veg rolls whenever I have ordered.

Apart from their rolls, they have an AC restaurant which serves average quality budget food.

A mediocre sized restaurant,the location of this place won't impress you much,but that impression would reign only till you haven't tasted their utterly delicious dishes,starting from chinese to indian,any preparation that you want. Nothing special about the ambience though the waiters are always ready to help and food is really served well and fast. No complaints regarding quantity or quality. The quantity is enough for two people with good appetite and the quality and cooking would really quite impress you. The money they charge for the dishes is totally worth it. Over all,i loved blossom and would really love to visit again.:-)

Been here many times for one reason only " Sasta aur accha CHICKEN TANDOORI " . Located near Hedua Park , the place is always busy. There is a sign board at the entrance disallowing people wearing halfpants and three quarters with flippers from entering inside ( which I always find humorous ) Great Chinese as well as Indian food at affordable price. Most of the time I order Indian food ,specially CHICKEN HANDI and CHICKEN DO PYAZA which I eat with NAAN. Eating were is incomplete without devouring their TUTI FRUTI .

The food is good. But the service is 3rd class. The waiters & the lady managing the cash are extremely rude & arrogant. They speak like illiterates. Many people including me have been harrased before & they regularly pick up fights & abuse the customers every now & then. Wish the management is improved as it is a potential good restaurant.

Be it college student or some localite, blossom is a nice place to be in.
While taking a stroll towards manicktala from college street came across this restaurant. It is situated just 200m off the vivekananda road towards manicktala.
The restaurant has a takeaway corner too, for rolls,kebabs and mughlai.
 
A nice place for getting cosy with friends, the place has large tables with soft couches. For couples u can't sit opposite, what I found that they tend to seat nearby. The decor had an age old feeling , with paintings on wall.
A very quite inside gives you a very.good ambience. 
 The staff is a bit of a letdown, and it took a hell lot of time to serve food, also self service thing was again not very appealing.

We ordered reshmi kabab as starter and for main dish Chinese chopsuey.
Have to wait a long, the reshmi kabab was tasty, succulent and  6 soft pieces of chicken served with chutneys, well offcorse it wasn't as good as arsalan, but I love in the form it was served, and full marks for it, & are enough to.make you full.
Then came Chinese chopsuey, what's different here that the crispy noodles isnt served with sauce ,but we need to mix it up. However the thin chicken omlette strips were delicious. Coming to.the sauce, all the ingredients were in aplenty, chicken,mushroom,prawns and vegetables. It was a nice crispy and juicy combo.

And all this for a bill of  about 290, which is just quite cheap.

Location - 3/5
Ambience- 3.5/5
Food quality - 3.5/5
Service-2/5

Needs improvement in service, else a good place to be

The ambience of the restaurant is quite decent and nice. The seating arrangement is comfortable as they have couches instead of chairs.

The dishes i had tasted were mixed fried rice, Schezwan chicken and Hongkong chicken.
The Quality of the food was good and every item was delicious. The price is quite cheap compared to the quantity they offer.
To sum up, I'd say that anyone who'd dine here wud atleast leave the place with content (and a completely filled tummy :P ) . This restaurant surely deserves more attention by the food lovers out there..

This restaurants is one of my favourites.
Perfect place for b'day treats and lunch or dinner with friends  . The ambience is nice and the place quite cheerful and comfortable.
This place was introduced by a friend who lives nearby and I have going back again and again and again.
It is very pocket friendly. .sometimes I look twice at the bill after the amount of food we devour.
Thei naans are awesome . .soft and crispy. All the Indian chicken items are good but I would recommend the Hyderabadi chicken and their chicken tandoori kebab. They are really good.The amount they serve in one plate is more than enough for two people.
I would also recommend their baked fish . .with fresh fish fillets always ( surprising ,for a small eatery) and lots of cheese. :)
The service is quick enough and the food is always hot and fresh.
Please do visit this place.

When i was a school kid i always craved to have a meal in this restaurant. Today i am glad to have a meal in this restaurant with a very special one who made it more special visit. About the ambiance The decor was decent. We ordered one chicken mushroom soup chicken momo chicken crispy fry mixed fried rice & hot garlic chicken. The soup & the momo was recommended by my friend & i kept full faith on her, and i am really glad that i did that. & honestly those are the best i have eaten so far in any other places. The soup was really good but the mono was just out of the world. I think i have had the best momo in my life. Wanted to order another plate but just preserved that for another visit. The crispy chicken was good but have to finish it off before it gets cool down. Well about the rice & chicken item both were good but could have been better. I must suggest to everybody that if anybody ever visit that place please order a chicken momo.  Overall a very good place & nobody would regret about visiting this place.

Easily one of the best Chinese food joints in North Kolkata. Any visitor must try Pepper Fish. Order any standard Chinese dish you will not regret. But tandoor dishes are average.

I have been a visitor to this joint since early days when it was house in a small room at the same location. Ever since then I have never been disappointed with Blossom.

i really can't remember exactly how many  times i have been there .. may be countless :p acc to me it is one of the best restaurant in north kolkata .. 

location- oppo hedua park, bidhan sarani

ambience - pleasent , not very decorated but sweet .they have two floor, but they usually open upper floor in special occation like puja, poila boisakh, christmass etc 

food- now the main part, foods are equally good both chinese ao indian,, still some  staple dishes that i preffer here are fried rice, hakka chicken chow ( rs 115) , crispy chicken,  dry chilli chicken (around 12 small pieces is jst rs- 125, taste wise very good, do try this ), chicken tikka butter masala (rs 135), paneer butter masala, and my most fvrt kebab platter containing one tandoori chicken, 2 tengri kebab, mutton seekh kebab, fish kebab each, 3 chicken reshmi and tikka kebab each  and this all cost jst rs around 260 ( without tax ). but it mainly available in lunch time :( 

pricing- under rs- 500 ( with tax ) for a full meal for 2 adult  , but last time i visit i notice they start taking service tax also :(

and one thing ,i personally did't like their mutton dishes , except that a total value of money restaurant , a must try :) they serve roll also outside of the joint.

My review is solely based on the Chinese I tried here. We went during the afternoon and we had to wait for a couple of minutes before we could get a table. We were handed over the menu while we were waiting outside. Thats appreciable. As soon as I entered, I was pretty impressed with the interiors- a dim light spacious room with beautiful ceiling and 7-8 tables. My plan was to taste the famous north indian dishes here but on most of my friends' insistence,  we decided to go with the Chinese cuisine of Blossom. We ordered Chicken Chow Chow Rice, American Choupsey, Chicken with Babycorn. The service was prompt and the staff were kind enough to explain some of the dishes. But my disappointment was the food. The food clearly showed that Chinese is not their area of expertise. None of the dishes tasted that finger licking good though it appeared they have tried their best. Some of them lacked flavours of the veggies and tasted overcooked to me. Even the spices were not in proper amount. And, the amount of babycorn served to us certainly did not justify the price. They lacked crispyness. I would love to visit Blossom again, but never for the Chinese. Will post the photos soon. :)

blossom is situated just opposite to the hedua park and is very near to hatibagan. As it is near to my college, i often visit this restaurant. And I can assure you it IS the most cost effective restaurant in kolkata. the same quantity and quality of food if served in other big restaurants in kolkata, they would probably have charged you double. the ambiance is good, service is okay. food is also good. Here you should try the dessert truty frooty. It is the perfect place to dine after hopping north kolkata pandals in puja.

Another my frnd was giving a bday treat..... Two of us were late and they didnt allow the others to enter which i find utterly irritating

The BLOSSOM situated at hedua park is one of the well reputed restaurant famous for its Chinese cuisines. I recently dined with my whole family along with some of my relatives there( 14 people) . Although the restaurant is not huge in space but it compensates that with its superb food that has a distinct taste. The prices seems to be reasonable. The main dishes which are quite heavy on spices along with its mild appetizers provide a well distribution of taste palette and helps you to enjoy your food.

Dry chili chicken and Chicken reshmi kebab are good starters... In the main course, Chowmein ar Fried rice are decent too.. I liked the Mutton Rara also .. goes very well with Naan or Rotis...

This place serves some great baked fish at a very reasonable price. Not the traditional chunks of fish based within layers of cheese, here they serve 2 big pieces of fish(orly like) in a cheese gravy. They use original beckty for sure and the taste is almost up to the quality of baked dishes in Mocambo. Really worth, though I ain't too familiar with North Calcutta but I have a hunch you would not get this anywhere else in the North. Another dish we ordered was the Blossom special prawn, its basically prawn, capsicum, onion, tomatoes, baby corn etc in a white chinese gravy hidden beneath an omelette. It is sweet and tangy and quite good, only con being so very few pieces of (quite small) prawn in the dish. Also tried the chicken tikka kebab which was good enough. And the tutti-frutti ice cream as dessert, my friend really liked it and myself not a big ice cream person(except ones with brownies or hot chocolate) found it okay.

Overall this place is really worth a try if you are in the neighbourhood just for its baked fish. The other Indian/Chinese dishes which I saw being served up to other guests seemed pretty tasty too, specially the butter nan. Will definitely visit again

This is not just a restaurant to me but a place where I cherish Some best days of my life - my graduation period. Owing to its close vicinity to Bethune, it was always the easiest option to go for. The food quality is quite up to the mark but things can really get better with a bit a quick service. I would also suggest you people to consider the quantity you offer as it certainly  does not run parallel to the high rates charged in addition to VAT.

In my college days, in scottish, blossom was our soul mate. Besides the clg canteen, blossom was our regular spot of visit. Egg rolls, chicken rolls, veg rolls, are in high demand always. And every alternate month we used to dine in. The food quality and quantity were better than many others, which forced us to visit frequently.

This place is awesome when it comes to food and good food. Ambience I'd say not much nice... But the quality of food is very good. I have had food a lot of times here and I have never ever been dissatisfied or disappointed.  it's pretty economic and the fish preparations are outstanding..

We went there during the Pujas of 13-14 for lunch, it was raining heavily n this was the only place to have food which can also serve a pocket friendly nature.. We had to wait for almost 20mins after listing our names..

--Ambience--
Ambience was Ok at that time,but as usual it was Durga Puja so every single restaurant would remain crowded. We even had to share our table with another couple.
But still what i saw i felt the place does have a quality ambience so would love to visit again apart from Puja days.

--Quality n Quantity--
Quality was good, would give 4out of 5.
I feel it could be a little better like the Chicken should be more spicy n the amount of curry should be less
Quantity was huge, we ordered 2plates of fried rice but could only finish one n pack the rest. I recommend everyone to order 1plate at first. Must try the Tandori tikka kabab over there, it was really good considering the price bracket

--Behavior of Staffs--
The staffs were well behaved n despite the huge rush for Puja they served us well n that was really a great positive side.

--Pricing--
The pricing is moderate n if you have a tight budget but you want a quality food this is the place for you. we had 500to spare for lunch n it was more than enough..

Thats everything from my side, would love to visit this place again apart from the Puja hours

2nd Visit -- 5.10.2014
Things we ordered
Chicken Fried Rice * 1 = 115inr
Thai Chicken * 140inr
Plain Nan * 20inr
Total = 275inr
Tax = 39.88inr
Service tax = 15.57
Total = 330.00
This place never fails to delight me n is one of the best resturant which offers food in such low price..

I was a frequent goer of this place on my college days. Three reasons to be mentioned : reasonable rather cheap priced , good chinese , cozy atmosphere..



Have tried almost all of their chinese rice items n gravy dishes.....All are good but mixed fried rice needs to be specially mentioned...



Naans n rotis (tried butter naan, masala naan (as far i can remember it was too good that worth a mentioning) n some roti ) are also nice but don't try their kebabas. just horrible.Tried kebabs for a few times n every time they served dry kebabs :/ ..have tried tutti-frutti ice cream once n that was also the last time as it was unbelievably bad..



sevice was good..



Overall good one....

One of the restro that I regularly dine in. Dont try the thai. Chinese is better here. The kebabs n tandoors r better. Chilli mushroom ..highly recommended.. must try is the baked fish. The chelo kebab is good, though peter cat is the best. But nonetheless one of the finest multi cuisines of north kolkata.  Pocket friendly.

Blossoms is one of my favorite eating point in Kolkata. The baked fish here is too good, and I strongly reco it to everybody. Ambience is good, service is quite quick. Keema Kulcha is another fav of mine, try it with any Indian chicken/mutton/fish item. Sometimes specially in holidays and during evening you may have to wait in the queue.

iv lost count of the innumerable occasions wen after a gruelling day,i landed up at blossoms to gorge on their tasty fare...my staple here was chkn sweet corn soup, chkn fried rice and a chicken in white sauce(mushroom/babycorn)..my bf tho luvs the shahi paneer hre..recently they hav tried to expand the palette by introducing chello kabab and baked fish etc...this is one of the few restos that offer half and full plate dishes... the decor is soothing...such great food at magical price...unbelievable!!

Location: Minutes away from Scottish Church. 

I was introduced to this place by my tutor a few days back. My tutor, tuition mates and I had dropped by this place for lunch. 
Quite surprised to see this place crowded. 
The ambiance isn't that great, is Okayish. 
Anyway who cares about it when the Fooding quality is of such a good standard? 

Yes, coming to the point, 
Chinese and Indian cuisines, both are catered here. We had opted for the Chinese cuisine. 
Quantity and quality haven't been compromised upon. 

- Veg Fried Rice 
Well cooked rice and tossed with juicy veggies.  
A happy rice eater.. :-) 

- Veg Manchurian 
The dumplings were delicious. The gravy tasted amazing. Had the right kick of spices in it! 

Non-vegetarian dishes were also ordered, and since am a vegetarian couldn't eat, but, would like to pen down the feedback by the others: 

- Mixed Hakka Noodles 
Tasted awesome.  
I could see it to be a bit oily. 

- Chilli chicken 
Chicken pieces were succulent and tender. 
Recommended. 

The staff was courteous and efficient when they feel the crowd pressure, else just the opposite, laid back!
Pricing was friendly to the pocket. 

Overall a good experience. :-)

Ever since I came to Kolkata 2 years back, and even before that, this has been one of my favourite haunts. All the time.

Let me come to the point. It is so crowded during weekends that you might even have to wait for 30mins to get in the resturant. But the wait is worth it. 

The ambiance is very good inside and so is the food.

If you go, definitly DO NOT miss the Baked fish and the Tutti Fruity. Both of them are amazing.
As for the main course, it is lovely and goes very easy on the pocket. The food is lovely as is the behavious of the people all around. This is also the haunt of many college students, so expect to get a little bit of shouting and shreiking sometimes, but nothing rowdy or out of the world.

To get a fair idea about the price let me say
1 full and 1 half tandoori chicken, 3 plates of rice, 1 keema naan, 3 plates of side dish, 4 tutti fruity and 2 ice creams cost only 1959 to be exact.

Located just opposite to the hedua park, this is an ideal place for a hangout and great place for a proper foodie.

However it opens at 12pm as per my last knowledge. So in case you reach before that, you will have to return disappointed. 



Whether I would visit again??

I have been doing so all the time and i definitly would.

Now if you have been in blossom 2years back and have given 5.0rating to its food.Forget it!there has been a drastic change in the quality of food and taste.Dont know the reason why.the prises are still reasonable for which people would still love to visit this place still now.I came back here after 2years and I was so dissatisfied.you will find a odd smell in the ambience. The quality of the food is not up to their own marks. So I would change my ratings from 4.5 to 2.5.

Located in a popular spot right opposite to the Hedua Park, Blossom has always been a perfect budget food restaurant. The food is good, but that's all about it. We ordered chicken reshmi kebab as starter because of my friend's indomitable kebab craving. The kebabs were piping hot, succulent and absolutely delectable. For the main course we had chicken-prawn fried rice and red hot chicken (Indianized version, of course) . Both the items were moderately good, with oil on the higher side. The quantities too were perfect. Ambiance is cozy and the staff are uhm, okay too. But just okay. At the end of the meal, we had a decent bill which was absolutely viable for the food. So, all I'd say is visit Blossom for decent food without burning a hole in your pockets.

I had been to this place tons of time for having their awesome rolls but this was the first time I was visiting their restaurant. Going through the reviews and the ratings I had an idea about the food being served here and so some of my friends went to this place last week. I really loved the ambiance of the place. We ordered for Chicken Sweet Corn Soup,Mixed Sczewan Noodles, Mixed Sczewan Fried Rice, Red Hot Garlic Chicken. The order came in within a considerable period of time and was served hot. The soup was good but I was disappointed with the taste of the noodles and the fried rice. This was the first time I had Sczewan noodles and fried rice with only pepper. But the noodles was blending quite well with the Red hot Garlic chicken as it was a bit spicy and had adequate amount of gravy but was not so spicy as the name suggests. So overall my experience in Blossom will fetch them a 3 out of 5.

Every food item of this restaurant is world-class taste and very healthy (Not too rich or digestion problem). The cost of the items are reasonable. The amount of food is also adequate. All Kebab platters and Chinese items are best here. You will become addicted if you regularly visit here and will not like anywhere else to go.

Blossom is a very popular restaurant located near Hedua park opposite Scottish Church College.I have visited this place only once,about a month back.Decent food at reasonable prices is the main attraction of this place.But I felt the quality of the food left a lot to be desired.

It was around 4pm one afternoon when three of us had paid a visit.We were surprised to find the place crowded even at such an odd time.Both the restaurant inside and the takeaway counter outside were packed.It says quite a lot about the popularity of the place.We had to wait for about 15mins before we managed a seat.

All three of us were extremely hungry and I was keen to try the different cuisines on offer and thus our order comprised of chicken tandoori,chelo kebab,mixed fried rice and chili mutton.The food in one word was average.All the items were very average.They were not bad but one can sample much better varieties of the same at many other places.The chili mutton was a huge disappointment.In the end we were looking for some good desserts but the options were very limited in this section.
The one good thing was that the prices were extremely reasonable.The service was decent.The ambience was okay.

In short,I do feel budget restaurants are required and one certainly cannot expect exceptional food at such places but honestly I expected better quality food from such a popular restaurant.

From a pretty decent admirer to total anti Blossom mentality in one day....
Crap....The blossom I knew of during 2008 when I had joined Scottish church for a brief period is not there at all upto the standards it was famous for....
4 of us went for post college lunch there and my my the food was so bad, oh so bad...
The fried rice was the only properly edible thing on our menu...There too the prawn stink made me put them aside, the fish schezuan was smelling so bad we could not eat it...Complained but to no avail, ordered something I remember from my past visit the thai chicken and it was a simple mixture of tomato, chilli and soya sauce....The chicken was hard, coarse, and not at all tasty....Disgusting...
The Manchurian mushroom could have been anything as the taste of the mushroom was so overpowered by the batter and the taste of the gravy  and the smell was strange
The noodles was so strange in smell, smelt of olive oil and a mixture of sunflower oil on the vegetables....My My spare us
One of my worst dining experiences this year if not the worst

Am i biased towards Blossoms ? May be coz im a Scottish church student .............
But dont blame me ..This place serves such mouthwatering rolls that i am compelled to love it . 
Only place where i am contended to eat a veg roll without having the chicken or egg chicken rolls giving me an envious look lol..
The price is so ridiculously low .where do u get an egg chicken roll for 30 these days 
the veg roll is so filling and yet it only costs 18 rs.
the chicken pieces in the rolls are from kebabs so they r extra tasty 
only problem is during lunch break its very congested 
Now for the resturant 
best chicken Manchurian i ever had 
the chow mien is  also very  tasty 
the rates are very reasonable once 9 of us dined and it took us only 950 bucks ( of course we shared the plates the girls cant eat one entire plate of noodles ) 
we also had butter naan it was good 
over all id definitely like to visit this place again and again ....

Blossom is one of the good 'time-pass' food palace in the typical north. We have many encounters with it. Being it Roll to main course, blossom never let us down.
  
  Location: It is exact opposite of hedua park, not in main road but in a bi-lane towards hatibagan.

  Ambiance: Always crowded in the roll section, long long queue sometimes. We have waited 40 minutes once for a 
  simple  Chicken roll. In the sitting arrangement it is well-lit, simple decor. You can also seat in the second floor also.

  Food: We have tested almost all. Being it Indian or Chinese, both are good. But mainly people ordered Indian here.
  In the Chinese section we love Thai fried rice, Blossom Sp. Fish, Almost all chicken dishes. Indian section 
  Chicken  tandoori is absolute must. Various kebabs are also good. Naan, Tikka butter masala all are good. 
  Special mention to their Tuti-fruti. Most of the time it is really good. Quantity is very good. Very good portion.

  Price: It is pretty affordable.
  
  So take a chance and grab the dishes. You will not disappointed.

This restaurant has always been famous for its reasonably priced yet delicious and top quality food. Located minutes away from Scottish church,Blossom had always been in my wishlist for the fact that the chelo kebab platter is served at half the price of the restaurant famous for it,without grossly comprising on the quality. There are these comfortable cushiony six seater tables only,so even if you are alone, you'll have to wait for some time to get a seat,given it's always crowded with college folks. Both Chinese and Indian cuisine will be catered to,and there's this baked fish as the only continental item. The kebabs are a must have here,succulent and decent sized chunks. From the mains,try masala kulcha,it's really low priced and generously stuffed. We had a paneer tikka butter masala alongside,even that was quite good. Overall,this place would definitely leave you satisfied,and I'll be visiting again soon for the baked fish i missed last time. And yes there's a fast food take away counter at the door,you may try that as well in case you're in a hurry!

Blossoms is a favourite when it comes to north calcutta.

Blossoms is a very popular restaurant near hedua which serves chinese and indian cuisine. All the times that I have been here, I stuck closely to chinese because the food is just fabulous. 
Please, do not go by its exterior because it does have a very jazzy look to it.

But once you step in, you are simply going to be blown apart. Sweet and cosy interiors, friendly staff food is overall quite decent and extremely affordable price :)

The fried rice, noodles , chicken and almost everything that you order here will not dissapoint you. 
I was here for a friend's birthday party too, and the food was awesome !

Technically, I have visited this place twice and I absolutely love it. I shall soon pay a visit :D

Cheers!

It is right opposite to the Hedua park at Simla area, (North Kolkata), I've passed by from there many times before but never concerned about it, but on that very day we are thinking of where to get the dinner tonight, and at the time of watching a movie at Star Theater (Hatibagan) we've got a commercial promoting the restaurant during the intermission, and we've decided to finish our dinner over there...

Now lets come to the restaurant part,

Food quality is very good, specially the Indian,
Though the inner decoration is not so much impressive, but seats are comfortable..
Service is also slandered and satisfied..
I was a student then, so I fount the the prices are a little bit costly.. but if I think now, according to the quantity the price is standard.

I had heard about Blossom many a time before from my friends and finally today I went there with my gang...a lovely place with decent ambience and perfect for students. As the cost is within your budget (for students) and quantity is also handful. They serve 11-12 pieces of chicken in few of the Chinese dishes. We tried out THAI CHICKEN, RED HOT GARLIC CHICKEN, KULCHA, EGG FRIED RICE & CHICKEN CHOWMIN. The taste was superb especially the thai and garlic chicken...yummmy taste...loved the place...

Food quality and food quantity is very good. It also has the proper atmosphere where people can go with his/her buddies or family. Chinese section is very good as well as tandoor also. Though i have not tasted all the items still i have that faith that each and every dish will be preferable to the people of kolkata.

One of my favourite restaurant in North Calcutta. Located near the Hedua 4 point crossing, easy to locate. Visited this place number of times and it always feels good to be back here as you can enjoy some good food at an affordable price.

The setting is nice and cozy, definitely of a more family restaurant.  The light is dim but not dark. Their service is not so fast neither too slow, staffs are polite and friendly.

Coming to food, I have experimented with both Indian and Chinese fare, and personally I will go with the latter one, but that doesn’t make Indian dishes less good. Their rice and noodle preparations both are decent which comes in a quantity for two people. Their momos are mention worthy- always fresh and succulent with thin coating and good filling. In Indian, their kebabs are good but they’re too inconsistent with their Tandoori chicken. Chicken butter masala, chicken hyderabadi and chicken tikka butter masala goes well with nan. In desserts, I once tried tuty fruity and it tasted good.

Wiil be back soon..!!!  

It was my favourite joint but recently it has become extremely expensive for people like us . Staff Behaviour has improved significantly.  Coming to the food Chelo Kebab still tastes good while the chinese department has taken a beating in terms of taste and quality.

Blossoms will always be a special place for me because of the innumerable memories I associate with that place for the past 5 years. It is a quaint and cozy little place, very close to Scottish Chruch and Bethune Colleges and is a favourite haunt of all the college goers. The prices are very reasonable and pocket friendly. My favourites are the chicken roll, baked fish, fried chicken momo and Chelo kebab (which is available for half the price most other restaurants charge for the dish. The quantity is the same and the taste isn't very different either.)

Blossom has been my place for rolls since a decade but the place has grown immensely. Started with a roll counter, it has opened a restaurant with a big indian and chinese menu. The roll counter opens around 2 in afternoon and within 10 mins one could see a queue of 10-11 people which speaks volumes of its rolls even after presence of so many roll counters nearby.

The restaurant has sofa seats which are a bit uncomfortable which i dont mind if i get some good food on the run. The indian food is very average and i would suggest to stick to the chinese preparations that are very decent in prices with generous serving and good taste, quality. Fried rice is pretty good.  Chilly babycorn/ paneer is amazing for 100 bucks. Hakka noodle is average though. Starters are ok but overall you could eat you way without spending much.

All in all, a great roll center, if one is ok with that long queue. Indian food deserves a skip but  chinese food is great for such prices. One of the very best places for a chinese food in that location, pretty perfect for a takeaway or home delivery.

This is not a recent but a cocktail review from several whispering memories since 2006.
Blossom was the nearest hangout  from my college Scottish Church, situated just beside Heduya and also at a close vicinity to Bethune college.
At the 1st yr of my MSc (2006) at a very nice evening when we (my past GF and recent best half) first entered in Blossom it was not in present look. A small one room (which is still present but mostly stays closed just at the right side after entry) restaurant with full of tasty menus made our evening awesome. I still remember the menu Mixed fried rice, chilli chicken and coke which was ordered in duplicate. The amounts were soo high that we were not able to eat even a single plate. I became a fan of Blossom. Till date I entered a countless number of times and will continue to do the same whenever I will be in Kolkata. 

Ambiance: Excellent, as I am not able to remember anything bad cause I am nostalgic about the place.
Staff: All the members were and are very humble and careful to their customers. I remember one who delivered food on my 1st entry (sorry to say that I forgot his name) who is still working there. Every time I entered I found that smiling face. Last time I came to know his son passed 10th with 98% marks. Hats off to such a proud father.
Food: I tasted almost all dishes from last 7 yrs. all are awesome. Some of them I specially cherish for are: Mutton fried rice, Blossoms special fried rice, chilly mutton, fried chicken, peeper chicken, red hot garlic chicken. Almost all are great. Sorry to say I never tasted veg dishes so no idea about the taste. Last time I found two new additions in menu Grilled fish and chelo kebab. Grilled fish was little dry I had better taste for this dish in pune and chelo kebab was good enough ( though few better examples are there in kolkata itself). 

Most importantly the rolls sold just outside the entrance of Blossom are mind blowing. Any of these you take even veg ones can take you to heaven. I miss those just wow moments.

Price: Kolkata is the place for food lover because of taste and specially price. All prices are more than up to the mark and the amount for main dishes they use to supply are even higher for two. Hats off.

Verdict: Come every day....ha ha, just kidding I miss this place and I think Many of my friend also cherish the days when we use to fill our stomach and soul with the taste and smell of Blossom.

One of the best place to enjoy a dine out with your friends. It has a cozy atmosphere, good food, well behaved waiters and most importantly u will not feel the pinch in your pocket even after having a sumptuous meal. Try out their Chicken Tandoori, Baked fish and Hyderabadi chicken. Their specially prepared kashmiri polao will definitely tinker your taste buds..and in dessert try out their Truty Fruity. It may not be as well as a Truity Fruity of Amber but still it's more than just good because it comes at just Rs.50!! So basically for those college students who love to hang out in a standard restaurant and at the same time do not want to splurge too much of pocket money, it's a place worth visiting.

One of the favorites. Excellent food and service. Prices are not very high but in the middle range, BUT, the quantity served more than compensate the price issue. If you order a single plate of any main dish, be sure it will be enough to feed two persons sufficiently. The quantity is very generous. Overall good food and quiet pocket friendly with good service and conveniently located near my college. Rather it is a famous food hub for all the College students in the Hedua region.

again have fallen in love with blossoms. last night went there with my boyfriend after being informed that they have introduced 'chelo kabab' a couple of months back, ordered 2. trust me they were so good that you will forget the taste of chelo kabab of that famous restuarant. and its just rs.120/plate. can you believe it? we thought that they will serve us less kababs or the taste won't be that much good as compared to other restuarants. but they served us the same quality and quantity along with 3 chicken kababs, 2 mutton kathi kababs, 1 egg-poach, green salad, steamed rice with butter. we relished the dish, pocket friendly, a complete meal. our stomach was full, the 2 chelo kabab cost us just rs.275 (with tax+vat).

Blossom is near to my college. I am a frequent visitor there. they have kept their price almost the same since the last 4 years. Even today their chicken reshmi kabab costs just rs.95 (6 pieces) which is one of my favourite. Quite pocket friendly for us, students.

A place favourited by my mom. I am a regular visitor of this place. Good food, nice ambience. It is near to my college and place also.  :)  I am always in a process of dining out here or else packing food from here whenever the cook is absent.  :)

This is a really good choice for an afternoon meal. The prices are decent, the amounts are really good, and the interiors, though not too brilliant, are neat and cosy. Often I've had to wait outside for seats.....so I guess that speaks for it's quality. The platters are worth it, as the amounts are essentially enough for two people, especially if u top it off with desserts (my favourite being the Tutty Fruity). The location is really convenient for me too, as its only 10 minutes from college. All in all, a really good place to haunt now and then.

'Good food at reasonable price' - this will sum up what to expect in Blossom- a restaurant located beside Hedua and near Scottish Church College and Bethune College. Visited mostly by college goers, it has a decent ambience and going with family is not a problem. The upper stair remains closed during the day, so it is quite possible that one has to wait for a long time if he visits Blossom at peak lunch hours. Moreover, there are no separate arrangement (table for two) for couples, so they will occupy the seat of six, and a larger group have to wait outside. All tables can accommodate six persons here. 
Both Chinese and Indian foods are worth the value for money. Momo, soups, fried rice, chilly chicken, chicken manchurian, chicken garlic..all will delight your taste buds. Mushroom fried rice is awesome here. And don't forget to taste the Tutty Fruity Ice Cream here, it will act as a perfect conclusion to your meal. 
The support staff are not very modest here and there is a trivial condition: You won't be allowed to enter in half pants or bermudas! God knows why they have problem with these. Can they impose a dress code for customers?
If you can overlook these things, you will enjoy the food here and too at a much cheaper rate compared to other restaurants of same level.

The Description: One of the finest Restaurants at North Kolkata with many quality and quantity. At the Hedua Crossing this place really have something to fulfill your hunger needs. And of course one of the cheapest resto at this place compared to others. It has been in my list always when it comes to dine in. I have visited this place so many times but it never disappointed me.

The Ambience :Beginning with the environment its good and nice. Good accommodation.. downstairs and upstairs sitting facility with full ac. At a table you can have 6 at a time. Place is neat and clean and decor is also looks nice.

The Food: Service of the waiters are satisfactory, they reply well and cooperate. Coming to the Food so Chinese and Indian Food are available here... Mix Fried Rice and chilly chicken is my Fav here. The Tandoori chicken is also satisfactory and i believe in the most cheaper rate till now. The Chicken Sweet Corn soup is a must try here. Its really thick and taste superb. Schwen Chicken is very nice, Spicy with the sour taste of the gravy. Prawn Manchurian is on a disappointing side as the gravy is fine but the pieces are on a smaller side. Chicken Reshmi butter masala is really good. For the veggie you can have the Veg Manchurian gravy for you hopefully it leaves good taste on your tounge.Very very reasonable at the time when food prices are so high. 

The Conclusion: My Review : 5 out of 5. a very good restaurant to visit with cheap price and good food. Specially for students and friends looking for lunch and dinner party. 
Note :The Review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Its such a cute little place. I used to love going upstairs and ordering the momos and Indian food here, and the food is served really fast here. The ambiance is quite cozy and prices are very reasonable as well. However, what I love about Blossom are the chicken rolls. The fragrant paratha, amazingly tender and tasty chicken kababs and a squirt of lime bringing all together made my day a lot of times.

Lets come to food now...The tandoori @Rs.140 is just value for money as a appetizer....i think Indian food is the is trust-worthy....not the chinese....mainly a little disappointed with the staffs.....
But over all very happy with the Indian food here....and without any doubt the tandoori....what we say in Bengali "FATAFATI"....

I had our very common Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken. I found both of them perfect for my taste buds at cheap rate. Yes, the rates are cheap and very pocket-friendly. But, the inside of the restaurant is very congested. Worth a visit if you are around.

What a Mind Blowing experience today, literally so. 
I, alongwith a bunch of hopeful friends went to Blossoms in Hedua for dinner. We ordered Tandoori Chicken & Crispy Chilli Baby Corn for starters. Food came, excitement grew, munching on with full zest when a shockin revelation: A HALF BUTTED SMOKED BIRI SWIRLING AMIDST THE CRISPY CHILLI BABY CORN!
When we confronted the so-called manager of Blossom, she laughed off the matter & decended with terrible attitude, let alone any form of apology.

Keeping in mind you have ample time to spare while munching down your food, Blossom is the place to be. I have been a regular here for the past 1 year, well almost once in two weeks and what I have been greeted with was the value for money. Decorated with a moderate ambiance this restaurant offers really good food at almost half the price comparing other similar eateries else where. I would suggest their tandoori items a must try along with a few Chinese delicacies. Overall blossom doesn't cease to please me every time I plan a visit.
