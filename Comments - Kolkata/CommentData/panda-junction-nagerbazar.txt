The name automatically flashes the image of the dragon warrior eating the dumplings😀 and the service men there could only be imagined as the Kung Fu Pandas😂... Now the dumplings these Kung Fu pandas serve are good. Even the thukpa I tasted once was really tasty.. But the tacos that they added in their menu is not up to the mark, even I can make it. The stuffing of the tacos was a chicken momo. And they charged 30 bucks for the mayonnaise which was used only to decorate the tacos or u can say the chicken momo paratha..

Cheater junction is best described for the outlet. 
Cheat every customer in name of buy 1 get 1. They give less in quantity. Food is also pathetic. Better try Any other known momo outlet. They charge Rs. 60 for 200 ml of drinks which is more costly than nearby other outlet.

I had Burger with french fries and coke. They served Momo burgers like Wow momo but at a higher price. Also the French Fries were not that good. They served it up with just common salt and also it was over fried. They took more around 30mins to serve just 2 burgers which is totally unacceptable.

The price compared to the quality...not at all a match though but two things that are a must try at this place - pan fried momo and cheese momo(steamed)
These two are quiet extra orodinarily good apart from that ,the rest are not quiet upto the mark.

I had visited the Park Street outlet earlier with my sister; it was located at Park Mansion....seems it has downed shutters now. It reminded us of the quick-format Chinese cuisine-chain Panda Express in USA...both of us had already been to its Colorado outlet a year before. We ordered two combos with chowmein, and two varieties of chicken sides-dishes. As a freebie, we also got a wanton platter.....so both of us were pleased as punch :D

Ordered two plates of chicken momo....in front of me they simply put the plates from display rack into the momo steamer....when I asked they said its not my order but I wondered how can a store deliver food from DISPLAY PLATE....
Not sure if I have got from that plate or not but the momo was REAL BAD IN TASTE and had rotten smell....never saw/knew that steam momo can be yellow in color...
Selling food needs honesty and this store lacks it

Visited their outlet at Diamond Plaza with my friends. I was really disappointed by the time they took to get us the food. They really need to improve on that. We had to wait for the food for more than half an hour.  We had ordered Chicken momo, Huanan Chicken Baby corn noodle and chilli fish. The momo was horrible. The coating was very badly done and it just felt apart. though the name of the noodles had baby corn none was found in the dish. The chilli chicken was luckily good. Altogether not a very good experience.

The momos were horrific,  noodles tasted like boiled shit and fries? dude i would love to eat raw potato instead of going there second time.  Not at all worthy of any recommendations.

Horrible! Yes, that's my experience here. Please avoid having momos from this counter and wasting your money. Overpriced. Absolutely no stuffing inside the momos. Drowned in oil, and over-fried to the extent that the momos turned dark brown. Easily the worst fried momos I have ever had at any famous brand outlet. Wasted my 263 bucks for 2 plates Chicken and Capsicum Momos and a cold drink. Furiously disappointed.

The servers at the station are not very attentive and do no hear the desired food orders properly. I wanted plain steamed momo and they added cheese to mine. when I refused they changed the cheese for capsicum but nonetheless it was not what I wanted. The food was good though. The cheese chicken momo was a tad disappointing but it was okay.
