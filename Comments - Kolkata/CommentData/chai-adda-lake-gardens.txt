A very happening but simple place... .an unique combination.  Full of youngsters chilling out on the footpath... Some sitting on cute chairs... Some playing chess... Some smoking with tea... A perfect adda place.. Very much justifying its name... With reasonable price tags... A person with a low mood also can brighten up his evening by not spending much from his pocket.... Food is also nice...

Love the environment and the serving style. Seating is not available that's not good. Beverage items were also good. Will try to come again. Went there for several times. It is nice place for quick snacks.

Amidst a busy place,traffic striken locality this place is really a good place to for a hangout with a very little pocket pinch....a neo generation type of outdoor joint with a variation of delicacies.....take my advice..."feeling bored...dnt know where to go....not much u can spend...no prblm...call a few friends,get a pack of fags....order for a cup of coffee....go on chatting or pati bhashae...adda chaliye jao"....

Snug place with the discomfort of seating. Other than that, if you're a smoker or having a gang but low on budget do consider to pay a visit here. As the seating area is situated on the roofed area outside the shop, expect the hustle of other customers. Great for casual addas and you get to choose from a farely long list of snacks with your cha.

Nice place for having some quick snacks, coffee n tea... No proper seating arrangements are available, only some tools are there for outdoor seating... Nothing to say about the ambience n decor... Staffs are extremely well behaved... I tried some of their ice tea n chocolate brownie... Both were quite good... Most importantly... The place is pocket friendly...

This place is not constant and that is a major issue with me. Some days their sandwiches are crispy grilled and tasty and on the other days they are stale!
One major problem is that though they claim the availability of paytm services,they never accept paytm payment giving one or the other excuse. 

The only reason I am giving them a 3 is because of a chocolate mousse dessert that they serve. Its brilliant. Its a chocolate mousse served in a chocolate bowl with a chocolate spoon. Yes,this deserves a try!

This kiosk is near Lord's more. They have a small open seating area infront of it. On this hot summer season, my friend and I dropped by this place to quench our thirst by ordering a cold cafe and an oreo cold cafe. It was worth the price completely. At 60 bucks only you get delicious cold cafe in a container. Didn't try the other items on the menu. But would surely try them sometime soon.

The first thing I want to say about it is I want to go there again. After an early morning movie time, we found it in a lane of Lake Gardens, Lord's more. A kiosk and some seating arrangements on the foot path, we stopped there to have our breakfast. We ordered for Chiken Pasta in red sauce and a Virgin Mojito but they suggested us to try their Lemonade with mint. And it was worth trying for. Pasta was well cooked and the Lemonade was refreshing and well, this food joint is quite pocket friendly. A lady hosting us was friendly, and her smiling face was a treat to enjoy the food. A lovely place it was indeed.

This is a chai shop near Lord's more. This food joint is more like tea junction chain of outlets with a few more snacks to munch upon. The chai adda special chai is good and so is the chicken club sandwich.

Chai Adda combines sophistication with the traditional Chai-er Dokan culture of Kokata. The vast variety of beverages on offer, especially the multitude of tea varieties is really amazing! I just love visiting this place on a winter evening and have a brownie complemented a steaming hot cup of coffee served in an earthen cup (Bhaar in Bengali). The price is a bit on the higher side but it is made up by the awesome ambience that this place has to offer.
