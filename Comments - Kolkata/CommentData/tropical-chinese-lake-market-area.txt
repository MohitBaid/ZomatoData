Schezwan rice is GREAT. Chicken hot garlic is a combination for those who like it spicy and chicken hong kong style is better for those who prefer little less spice. Quantity is good. Overall good place to eat.

This place is located in lake mall food court.. nothing so special to speak about.. They do serve some good combo's but it's not that tasty.. The sizzlers were not upto the mark.. The noodles were like steamed without any salt or spices.. The chicken pieces
Were not that soft...

But the rice combo is good..

This food stall in Lake Mall has a lot of options including combos and some sizzlers but this weekend we tried out only some starters from here.
We ordered crispy chilli babycorn, chilli chicken dry and drums of heaven.
Except baby corn, the remaining two items were really disappointing. The drums of heaven had a really weird smell about them with too heavy a coating, destroying the taste of chicken altogether. Dry chilli chicken was too much doused with sauces. I could hardly eat it. Quantity is also not good.
I wouldn't eat from here again....

Going by the bad reviews of this place,  I was a bit reluctant about ordering food from this place. Still, taking a chance, we ordered chicken fried rice and chilli fish (dry). And believe it was too good! Only they should improvise on their quantity a bit, because they serve really less at those prices, otherwise tastewise and quality was a big hit!

Well to start with.I've tried their hakka noodles and chilly chicken separately as separate dishes as well as part of combo meal.When you go for separate dishes the quality and quantity is good.But if u avail the meal combos; not only the quantity , the quality also suffers considerably. They give you a really small amount of noodles with four pieces of not so well cooked chilly chicken.I had mixed experience in this outlet.It was good one time and not so good the next.Also the order delivery time is long.

The oriental platter with rice was nice .. the one with the hakka noodles was also nice. The Caribbean drumstick in the platters were tasty and slightly spicy and the chilli chicken was also good.. However the salad was nothing special neither was the veg gravy
The sizzlers were amazing , especially the baby corn given with the sizzler.
Overall worth the money quantity wise 
Taste is okayish

Located in the food court of lake mall, I and my friend went here for lunch. It was my first time here though I tried almost all restaurants in the food court! Well, my friend brought suggested this place and it turned out pretty good except for the chicken's size. We ordered two plates of non-veg(not specifying chicken because we had egg mixed in the noodles) hakka noodles and one plate of chilli chicken. We were on the peak of our hunger so the food was finished within 10 minutes of arriving. The size of the chicken though could have earned the restaurant a complete 5!
Food- 4.5/5
Delivery-5/5!

I dropped by this place with a hungry stomach.I wanted to try the oriental chicken platter but it was unavailable.So I opted for the non-veg combo with fried rice.

Portion was adequate for one soul.The chicken dish was cooked well but could've been spicier.It was no where near to be described as hot chilli chicken.It was rather quite blande.Fried rice tasted okayish nothing extraordinary.

Pricing is really cheap for the portion they provide.Maybe I'll give this place another shot for their sizzler.For now my rating is 3.0 for the average food I had there.

What are you looking for on a cloudy evening with your best friend, a hot and spicy lunch with lots of talk. This outlet is located at the food court (yum street) of the lake mall, kalighat. Not much about the ambience but the food we had was good. We ordered chicken manchurian sizzler with hakka noodles and veg manchurian sizzler with fried rice for my beloved vegetarian friend. Taste was good but not satisfied with the quantity as the amount they charged did not justify with the quantity. The sizzlers were spicy nd smoky. Food court has lots of other outlet but if you wanna try authentic Chinese cuisine then you can try from there.

Ambience: nothing much to speak of, seating in the food court which is too noisy and crowded especially in the evenings and holidays.
Food: Ordinary Tastewise, not bad yet not much to talk about
Quantity: quite less, portion sizes are small probably that's why the price seems reasonable.

This time, it was Pan Fried Fish and Schezwan Chicken. Both of them were awesome. 
餃뀷an Fried Fish(9/10): Delicious and Wonderfully cooked. No bad smell, tender , 8 pieces. 
餃뀪hicken Schezwan(7/10): The fish one was better, thus, this was defeated in taste but still its Good. Tender, well cooked 8 pieces, freshly cooked.

Oriental Chicken Platter was what we ordered :). At Rs 200, they provide a lot for an average person's lunch/dinner.

There was fried rice, chilli chicken, kimchi salad, lolipops. We ordered 2 platters, one with noodles and rice.with another. We were filled and we are definitely coming back to this place to save money and not save space in our tummies.

Well I have been to this place twice. It's located in yum street, the food court of Lake mall. Lake mall Is a few minutes walk from rashbihari avenue. If you are in Lake mall for shopping you surely can dig in to this place.
The food court is quite spacious and you can find place of your choice.  
The staff at the counter of tropical Chinese is quite helpful and well mannered.
The food we ordered for the first time was manchurian sizzler which was quite good.
The second time that we visited,which was just a couple of days ago, we ordered their non veg Combo and dry chili chicken. 
Their non veg combo consisting of noodles, manchurian and kimchi salad was quite good as well. Their dry chili chicken does satisfy your chicken cravings. 
Overall good experiences both the times.

I was feeling hungry and ordered a Chicken Egg Hakka Noodle from here. It was just amazing with the taste and flavours. The amount of veggies, egg and chicken were filled in the noodles was more than the pricing. It costed Rs.130/- inclusive of tax and honestly i believe this was truly exceptional. Quantity is sufficient for two.

For just Rs. 200, you get this amazing chicken sizzler. Noodles, chilli chicken, babycorn, salad forms the whole combo.
Tastes good.

I went to lake mall yum street on astomi evening when it was packed up. Waited for half hour to get a sit. Searching all the outlets there for combo meal as it is cheap and i was hungry. Got puja special chinese combo for 175 bucks. They delivered the food after 40minutes. May be service is slow due to puja rush. FOOD was ordinary,nothing special.I think their nearby Chinese joint is better than them. But as it is during pujo can't expect more.So overall ok.

situated in the Lake Mall's food court "yum street".
we've been there for what feels like a MILLION times & won't think twice to go back for another visit.
first coming to their CHICKEN MANCHURIAN SIZZLER, considering the price, this is GREAT-taste wise & quantity wise. the crispy drums of heaven along with Hakka noodles, chicken manchurian & kimchi salad, fills both tummy & soul.
next, talking about their DRY CHILLI CHICKEN-the crunchy diced chicken pieces tossed in loads of onions, capsicums & garlic, with just the right amount of sauce is a complete win.
the BEST so far is the ORIENTAL PLATTER which consists of decent amount of Veg fried rice, 2 drums of heaven, the stir fried carrot-babycorn-mushroom-brocoli & $ pieces of chilli chicken along with kimchi salad is JUST another filling meal.
yet to try a lot of their dishes but still in daze of these delicacies.

Had a decent combo meal from here today. The Veg Chinese platter comprising of Veg Manchurian, Veg fried rice, and Salad was what I ordered. Food was reasonably good. However, the Manchurian gravy could have been better. It was watery and not very good as a gravy. Rice was fine.
P.S to the staff- Try including a glass of Sprite or Coke with this platter to make it a combined platter.
Thumbs up for the meal.

I've tried Tropical Chinese twice now, and both times I have come out with the same opinion. First day I had ordered a Manchurian sizzler, and the next day, and oriental veg platter. 
What's good here? Hands down the babycorn. It is very well made. However the rest of the dishes leave something to be desired. Portions served were good enough. And I can easily have a full stomach with either of the above mentioned dishes. The Hakka noodles is good too, but it tastes better with Manchurian gravy. The Manchurian / chilli paneer/ salads themselves are mediocre and OK types. Tropical Chinese won't be my first preference if I get Chinese cravings. But if you just wanna enjoy babycorn and Hakka noodles, do give the place a shot.

A decent outlet serving various Chinese foods located at the food court of Lake mall. As the name suggests Yum Street the foods served were absolutely yummy, fitting the name appropriately. We ordered chicken lollipop sizzler. The service was quite fast. They served the hot sizzler plate within 10 minutes. This was my first time of tasting sizzler dish and I found it quite good. The rice had a burnt flavor and the chicken gravy was tasty as well. Overall the dish was good. The prices were reasonable too. I would like to visit this place again for trying something new.

Tropical Chinese is a kiosk in the food court of Lake Mall serving Chinese cuisine. Went to this place few months back for a quick bite in the evening and it was just an ordinary experience.

Location: Lake Mall, Yumm Street

Service: The service was pretty okay. It was fast and the staffs were well behaved.

Food: Ordered a Chicken Oriental Platter and a Chilli Chicken Sizzler. The platter had Drums of Heaven, Salad, Stir Fried Veg, Rice and Chilly Chicken. The quantity was decent. The taste was good but nothing extraordinary. The sizzler was nice and was hot till the end and tasted almost the same.

Last Words: Overall a decent place to have chinese in Yumm Street.

Another day at the lake mall and we tried out this outlet. Wanted to try out the oriental platter but it wasn't available. Hence, had to settle for the chicken manchurian. An wholesome delicious meal for one. Good in taste and adequate in quantity. The sizzler consists of fried rice/noodles, 4pieces of chicken manchurian and 2 pieces of chicken drumsticks. Overall, quite good on a budget.

Located exactly adjacent to Stun The Sun in the food court of Lake Mall, they serve good Chinese food. Have tried in both the joints providing Chinese there, this one is way better. Their sizzlers are good. Prices and service are also okay. Recommended :)

The meal provided by them was tasty. But regarding the quantity it was not at all satisfactory. If you are on the verge of hunger then don't go for this outlet. Otherwise its not that bad in terms of taste. 游땙游땙

This outlet is located in the food court a.k.a Yum! Street of Lake Mall, Lake market. I have visited this store twice or thrice in the past. During my first I went there on seeing an offer of Rs-99/- on any meal. I went here and ordered chicken manchurian sizzler, but they told me it was not available. So, I had to order chilli chicken sizzler... The food came after ten minutes. The dish was delicious. It had noodles, chilli chicken, fried baby corn and kimchi salad. Every item on that dish was delicious. The next time that I went there, I ordered their chowmein, which was good as well. All in all, a good store. It will be a good thing if they can serve all the items in their menu, because I have not yet found their chicken manchurian sizzler.

We ordered for chilli chicken sizzler and chicken manchurian sizzler with rice and noodles respectively. The taste was really good enough and the amount is really 'paisa wasul'..It was full of chicken rice and salad with baby corn.

I am not a great fan of food court eateries but on this occasion i didnt have much of a choice so i decided to give this place a shot. The crispy chilli baby corn was amazing. We also had a chilli paneer& hakka noodles combo which was really well made too. The portion sizes are impressive. Seems like they use fresh ingredients as well. Surely worth a try if you are in the area.

I have been to yum Street quite a few times, but I tried Topical Chinese for the first time. The ' Line Lagao, coz its 99' offer was been applied and I decided to try out the place. We opted for Chicken Manchurian sizzler and drums of heaven.

The sizzler was fine considering the price to be just 119/- but the drums of heaven were more like chicken lollipops. The taste was good, whatever they may call it.

Tropical Chinese is one of the many food outlets inside the Yum Street food court( Lake Mall) We had ordered for Hakka Chowmein and Schezwan Chicken and found the quality to be good. Quantity is slightly on the lower side. Schezwan Chicken was droolworthy. You would find their services slow if you don't have much to talk about with whoever you go with. Prices are okay and no vat charges are included. They occassionally include combo meals in their menu. Ambience is good. Looking forward to visit this place again. :)

My another tryst with the yum street on last Saturday ended with this food joint and in a fiasco.
I ordered a chilli chicken sizzler. They served me the sizzling dish after 15mins from my order placement.
The dish looked good with Hakka chowmien, provided with gravy chicken, crispy babycorn & salad on the sizzling plate. It also tasted okayish till  I was able to bite a piece of the "chilli chicken". It didn't taste like a chilli chicken, moreover it tasted stale n had some weird odour to it. The crispy babycorn was overtly coated n fried. All in all I was disappointed with this excuse of a sizzler.

As per my first visit to this eatery today, I thought it was a pretty good attempt at an authentic Chinese counter. We had ordered for dry chilli chicken, and it tasted totally yummm. I am a die-hard fan of Chinese food, and this small eatery was surprisingly good. The chicken was not very spicy or oily, and yet tasted delicious. Hoping to try some more stuff,on my next visit to Lake mall.

This placed has recently opened up in Lake Mall food court area. I ordered the chilli chicken sizzler here. I have to say the food quality was really good. The babycorn was crispy, tasty and heavenly with just the right amount of sauces. The chilli chicken is the good old traditional Kolkatan chilli chicken you get. The fried rice was good but had a burnt taste maybe because they applied too much heat with the alcohol. The chef is simply human and these types of mistake happens sometimes. But in all it was a wonderful experience and I would love to go back again. 

Recently had the non-veg American chopsuey from this place.. It was horrible. The noodle had a pungent fishy smell to it and I hated it. It's true that some places do deteriorate with time.
