It was my parent's  30th anniversary and since we are strictly vegetarian so i was trying to look for a pure veg bakery and i got this 'joy of baking'. I read the reviews  and i thought to go for it. I ordered a 1pound pineapple cake. And so i found that the reviews  were absolutely  correct. The cake was 'beauty with taste' actually . A perfect pineapple cake with each and every layer of it filled with pineapple slices. I had never eaten a better one.It was absolutely awesome. Thank you 'joy of baking', will surely get to you again soon:)
Everyone plunged to get the cake so i could not take the picture when it was in it's flawless state. Anyways this still looks so üòç beautifull and delicious. Thnx once again:)

Very few people know about this bakery, it's highly underrated. I have tried their cakes on a couple of occasions, and they are to die for! The chocolate cake I find better than most other cake shops in the city. And a plus point is they are eggless! In fact on one occasion there were three cakes from kookie jar, cocoa bakery and joy of baking, the guests preferred the cake from this shop. Its that good! :D

brilliant is the word i would rate them at...ordered for bday cake for wife...who was overwhelmed and surprised seeing the beautiful creation and infact didn't want to destroy the eye catching cake by cutting it.... the finish of the hazelnut and chocolate taste was even better...which melted away in no time..guests loved it...very beautiful and neatly made ...they really bake gr8 and yummy tasting cakes...if you are out looking to surprise someone or treat yourself...certainly get in touch with them..as i would do again...i m not the kind who would sit down and write a review...but this place and the baker most certainly deserves the attention and are full worthy of being mentioned...keep up the gr8 work

Simply the best bakery in kolkata ! They made numerous gorgeous cakes for me and my family. Each cake they created was custom made and was perfect for the occasion . Not only the cakes are eye - catching,  they tastes even better.  My favourites are their black forest n strawberry chocolate cakes which are made with fresh cream and fruits.  Ring them anytime and the yummiest cakes are delivered at your door step. I hope they continue to serve such finger-licking cakes.

If you want a stunning looking cake which tastes even better than it looks then this is your place! Joy of Baking is all about innovative themes, beautifully executed designs and finger-licking taste.
My favourite are their Chocolate Strawberry Cake and Brownies. Everything is priced very reasonably and one will get a quality product at a very reasonable price. I keep going back to this place only because I think all their items are made with a lot of love and affection. I wish I could give this place more than 5!

Cakes / desserts are delicacies which are always kept for the end. The last bite of a sweet completes your meal and gives you a nice feeling. This happens to me whenever i have any cake or dessert from this amazing place "Joy of Baking". My favorite flavors are chocolate strawberry, chocolate truffle, mango gateau, brownie. So whenever i have a craving for cakes or desserts, i simply reach this place. The best part about their items are that they are egg-less. Apart from the taste, the thing that really matters is the gesture and the attempt that one takes to bake each and every cake. And i am too pleased with the effort they take to bake every cake. I give the design, theme, color combination and the exact cake is presented in front of me. So for me, whenever it comes to cakes / desserts, its only Joy of Baking. Keep it up. All the best.

This place makes the best chocolate strawberry cakes I have had and I have had in quite a few countries and cities. My regular flavour with them is chocolate truffle. From midnight deliveries to making any design i ask for. The USP is I can share the cake with my mother and grandparents as it is Eggless but fortunately the taste is better than all the cakes with eggs available in all the bakeries and cake shops. The team of mother and daughter gives great attention to details and always address all my questions with a smile.  Joy of baking is surely spreading joy around my family and friend's stomach and hearts.
