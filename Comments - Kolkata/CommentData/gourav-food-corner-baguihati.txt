I ordered grilled chilli cheese corn sandwich and it was good. Obviously, its true that there's nothing much to describe the place but yes, if you're running low on a budget, you may visit the place for sure.

If you are in the mood for cheap and good food. This is the place to be. Better known for take aways . I had ordered in from this place and hence won't be able to comment on the place and it's decor and ambience. 

The food is what I liked. They have a major snacks menu. I ordered the cheese Vada Pav and the Mixed Sauce Pasta. 

Taste was so so and quantity of the pasta was sufficient for one person. The food was decent nothing much to brag about.

This place is sick and disgusting.... Just don't understand from where have they learnt on their recipes..... Sick food.  Had tried their vada pao and burger which was horrible..... The Patty was smelling badly and the Maggi was all sour in taste.  Just an awful food joint to try or even think of eating food here.  Highly not recommended

Sick place to order food from.... This people tried a lot to copy

Sick place to order food from.... This place tried a lot to copy from the other food joints but I guess they failed miserably..... On v. I. P road there comes this outlet both the menu are exactly the same but they could not copy the taste as well.
Please guys bring in your perfection in copying at least copy and bring your dish to their taste.
Sick food... Sick hospitality..... Sick people

Right near my place and I usually visit here to grab something spicy and filling for my evening snack. This place has variety in their menu (fast food), 
I usually parcel vada pao and it's my favourite :)
We placed order for veg cheese pizza today and it was simply awesome. Thank you for delivering hot, fresh and tasty pizza on time. :)
