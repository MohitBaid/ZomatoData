This place located just opposite deshbandhu park( ladies park entrance gate)..It doesn't have a big sitting arrangement but if you want to taste some good pasta in a reasonable price then this is the place in shyambazar.. I will specially recommend the chicken pasta..A medium plate chicken pasta is enough for a single person..

Located just opposite deshbandhu park, this is one of the sole available street food stall in that place. Serves good food, freshly made, a bit homely. Good for satisfying your junk food cravings.

Went with a cousin of mine. No seating arrangement so only takeaway available. Food quality is good only but the place is not hygienic but the Crispy Chicken was good . An average joint to be honest with decent food items.

I still remember in my college days we used to be here in the evening and have chicken momo and  shezwan noodles.

Less space but a lot o taste. I used to love this place.

Well, this place is pretty close to my place so I am a regular here. Itts a small shop by the road. They mainly serve Chinese. To begin with, I really like their food quality and the quantity of food they serve. If you love spicy food, this is the place for you. I never really liked their vegetarian food though, but you would love their chicken momos. I love their Crispy chicken. Garlic Chicken. Mongolian Chicken. Drums of Heaven. They adjust the spiciness of the food according to your taste. Even though they do not have dry Garlic Chicken in their menu but they make the same on request and its yum. I love their non vegetarian combos as well. Simple hakka noodles with spicy gravy. One not so good thing about this place though is their home delivery service. They say they do home delivery but each time I request for one, they say that they dont have anyone to deliver the food home. So I always have to send someone to pick up the food from the shop. To conclude,I love this place. Their food is really yum for street food and is pretty reasonable. :)
