I tried their Radhaballavi which was served with aloo-torkari and was very tasty. The radhaballavis are kept in a hot-case and are heated in a microwave before serving. However, I didn't find much drop in the taste due to that. I also tried the Baked Rashogolla and that was mindblowing. The shop is very neat and clean. They have a handwash and drinking water facility. Staff was polite and friendly.

Ordered through Swiggy so will directly talk about the sweets

Dahi Vada - This was really tasty
Kesar Ras Malai - Though I have not tasted it but the feedback received from people who eat it was good.
Jalbora - This was awesome but the Jol (read Molasses) was too little in quantity.

Located in new alipore. Its an abode of refreshments for most of the people going towards suruchi sangha during puja. Highly recommended for light snacks and sweet lovers. Moreover it is reasonably cheap and is ideal for people who are short on their budget. It has a wide variety of deserts along with tongue-twisting chats, dahi-bara, dhokla, samosas, bhujias and etc. One can get bite of pastries as well. Moreover the staffs were also good and generous.¬† One can easily get enough stuffs for two at the cost of 100-150.

The only problem is that it do not have any seating arrangements so it becomes a bit crowded during puja time.¬†¬†

So i would suggest all the foodies to go and visit this sweet shop which is economical as well as has a great variety with good taste.

Very nice sweet shop in new alipore area. Great place to have some snacks and sweets as tiffin. Dhokla is very tasty, so as all the sweets. The place previously had price tag, but not now. I request the authorities if they can have price tags, because it is very annoying to ask price everytime.

Service is pathetic though, the counter folks are just too rude and impatient, enough for me to dock a couple points off and want to not visit!

It is not only a sweet shop at New Alipore, but literally a land mark.The Bus stop is identified as Hindustan Sweets .It is a well decorated and very aptly designed outlet in keeping with the times.
So has the variety and decor of both sweets and savory items are in this sweet shop.Propritory packed items like Nimki, Mini Samosa are also available.Enough space is there to stand and eat a few sweets at the outlet, and it is not a pre paid system.
Gajar Halwa is seasonally available and some thing to be savoured. For me Hindustan Sweets is a land mark and a sweet shop with lots of fond childhood memories.

People who don't know about Hindustan Sweets, show a raise of hands. Well, if you live under a rock and don't know what this outlet is, you're missing out on a heck lot of things in life. 

Hindustan Sweets is one of the most popular sweets shop in Kolkata. This joint is located at New Alipore, decorated heavily outside to attract more people. 

Quality of sweets is pretty good here. Although parking is a problem, the food kind of makes up for it. I personally love their Cham Cham.

Have dropped multiple times in their Jadavpur Branch, but managed to come here only once. Situated at New Alipore, one needs to enter from Tollygunge Phari, to reach this shop. Loved the Radhaballavis here and the Rasmalai. A special mention to their irresistible and most popular Cham Cham. The store is clean, with helpful staffs. Although, due to excessive rush, one might need to wait to receive their orders. Prices are decent, and absolutely justifies the quality these people maintain. Although, some people may argue, that the quality has seen a drop over the last couple of years, but even then till now, these guys have no real competition in and around the area they are put up at!

A very good sweet shop located in alipore ( keep going straight towards alipore from tolly phari)
The shop is hygenic and the sweets here are fresh always. Their channa preparations are very delicious. I have been here few times and have tried their chum chum. The Ras malai and chocolate sandesh are also well made. 
They have snacks too here on offer. 
Have even got an assorted sandesh box packed from here on one occasion and the recipient was very happy with the contents and taste of it. 
Prices are decent and this place is a good try for sweets. Another advantage for this outlet is that their are no good sweet shops in the vicinity ( only Gupta brothers if you keep going deeper into alipore)
So no doubt a good option in the area.

Nostalgia is a feel, whenever I visit this eatery. Located at New Alipore, the place brings back the old good school days of mine, where as a hungry student, used to visit this shop located about 200 meters away from my school and had different varieties of snacks and sweets. Although it was a Non Air Conditioned sweet shop back then, today it has redeveloped into a new face and the taste is absolutely the same as ever.

One of the best sweet shops in New Alipore. They make both Bengali sweets which mainly use cottage cheese or cheena and North Indian style sweets using khoya and dry fruits.

First thing first this Hindustan Sweets is not a branch of the Jadavpur Hindustan Sweets. For    a fact it is way better than the latter. In summer season try their wide range of  "abar khabo" mishtis from different Mango Abar Khabo which is my absolute favourite to its Litchi variant then the orange n kiwi abar khabo which are mostly available all d time. Don't go for their malpoas its nt worth it but their rosogollas, rasmalai, ghee laddu  are awesome. In snacks I especially like their panner cutlet n vegetable chop. Their dahi vadas r very sweet. Overall its my fav sweet shop.

The Hindustan sweets brand is an old timer in Kolkata.
I don't particularly like south Kolkata sweets after I had the North Kolkata ones but the ones you get here are not bad. The chocolate sandesh I have tried here were pretty good complete with liquid chocolate.
The rabri was horrible the milk/malai being watery and sickly sweet.I would say don't try it.
The real star however I must say is the radhballabi in the summer and the motorshutir kochuri in winter. They are amazing and whats even more delicious is the alur dom they serve with it.You MUST MUST MUST try it.I have the radhaballabi every week.They cost Rs. 10 each but are totally worth the money.
The good thing about Hindustan Sweets is that they have a diverse range of prodects. .from sweets to packed snacks and savory items like the mini burgers, vada pavs, chinese samosa etc. They are also innovative with the kinds of sweets they serve and they are now making some pretty looking mango sandesh. So have a go!

Southern Calcutta's one of the best sweets joint. That is how I want to portray Hindustan Sweets. Situated nearby my house, this place has always been the destination of our family for sweets and paneer. Each and every sweets item they make will make you crave for more. 

Definitely recommend to people having a taste for sweets.

This is one of the most popular centre for sweet lovers in & around New Alipore. One of the oldest sweet shop in this area which have been takong care of the sweet tooth of the people in this locality. 
Located in the prime location of Tollygunge Circular Road, it boasts of a fairly good amount of variety of sweets & a host of other snacks. 
Let me tell you people, some of the sweets being served here are ABSOLUTELY to die for! The cham cham being my favourite, it is a must try whenver you visit here to satiate your sweet carvings. All the sweets made of gur are too yummy to resist yourself from indulging in them & the rose leaf sondesh is another great option.
The samosas of this joint are also fairly popular & so are the other stuffs such as cutlet & various other sandwiches.
The newly renovated joint with glass panels & air conditioned space gives a refreshing feel to it. Though there is no option to sit & enjoy the food, awesome taste more than compensates for it! 
It takes care of the taste buds of almost all the cultures & communities-be it sweet loving marwadi community of New Alipore or the the bengali community which have a unique taste of their own when it comes to their favourite "Mishti"
So if you are in New alipore, & have yet not had their sweets, please do so at the earliest & for the ones cris crossing the place in the near future, please do stop n pay a visit. You will be rewarded with more than what you would have asked for. Definitely worth you time & money :)

I have grown up eating in this place. It is one of those oldest sweetshops in New Alipore which still remains everyone's favourite. Their key to that has been to always renovate and update itself with what is new. Recently I had their kachori sabzi which was just mouth-watering. 
Sweets are obviously brilliant. The hot gulab-jamuns and lyangcha melt in your mouth. They also have a fair range of innovative desserts that I am yet to try. The rassamalai is the best creamy affair that I have had in a while. 
They have also come up with a fair range of snacks- bara pav, veg burger, veg chowmein. 
It's clean and hygienic and the recent addition of A.C. is a definite plus point.
I only wish there were a few tables of sorts, the ones that are fixed to the wall and you have to stand and eat.

THE SWEET IS ACTUALLY VERY SWEET OUT HERE. NOT THAT YOU'LL GET DIABETIC BUT INSTEAD YOU'LL CRAVE FOR MORE. DO TRY THEIR PANEER CHILLI ROLL. SAMOSAS, AND IN SWEETS JUST GO FOR KESAR CHOM CHOM(CHAMCHAM) AND KESAR RASMALAI. IM WRITING THIS REVIEW AND IM SERIOUSLY CRAVING FOR ONE RIGHT NOW .¬†

Location: New Alipore. 

This sweet shop has been serving people for like ages now and that too in different ways! One, it's counted amongst the legendary sweet shops of Old Kolkata or better to say Calcutta; second, it has served people as a popular landmark to explain routes, third, it has become a public transport stop!
I don't know how could I miss on this place... Staying in this area since childhood and growing up on the sweets and savories from this shop and then also missing on writing about it, a total injustice on my part. 
Earlier, this  outlet was a non-air conditioned outlet with a crazy level of footfall, and, now after its renovation into an air-conditioned modern type outlet, it still has the same level of customer footfall. All thanks to the quality it serves.

About the FOOD, this place has been serving different types of sweets and savories without a dip in their quality level since years.
Visited this place after a couple of months and was sad to know that the Chana dal along with Kachori had been discontinued (it was their best). Now they serve it with potato curry. 
Their sweets are always fresh and delicious, and, the savories taste decent. Known for its sweets, I have always looked up to them for the same. Not much of a fan of their savories except a select few. 

Personal Favorites: 
- Kachagolla (Plain)
- Kachagolla (Gur)
- Kheerkadam
- Chumchum (Malai)
- Abarkhabo
- Rosogolla
- Kaju Barfi
- Chena Payes
- Shankh Sandesh (Conch-shaped Sweet)
- Gulab Patti Sandesh (Rose Petal Sweet)
- Bengali Samosa
- Dhokla

The SERVICE is quick, and, the STAFF are courteous and happy to help.

This place offers their fare at pocket friendly PRICES.

Overall has always been a good experience. :)
- A bit of sadness, missing the Chana dal. :(

Who doesn't know about the legendary "Hindustan Sweets" of new alipore, bus stoppages are named and referred by its name. It is not just a sweet shop but it is also the most preferable option as a landmark to our address. This shop has been in business for ages now and i am regularly visiting it since i was a child. As time has passed this joint has become more effcient in satisfying our preferences. Recently it has been renovated with all modern amenities and has been given a nuclear and fascinating decor. It uses all state-of-the-art technologies in its production and packaging processes. It offers wide varieties of sweets and snacks like- gur sandesh, chenna sandesh, sharbhaja, kalakand, laddoo, motipaak, sankha, jolbhora, kaju barfi, rasgulla, gulabjamun, lyangcha, talsash, rabri, rasmalai etc. Some of the recent editions which evolved are- (strawberry, kiwi, kesar, mango, chocolate, sitaphal, pineapple, cherry etc) abarkhabo sweets; these are indeed awesome in taste and will make you crave for more everytime. Their snack offerings ranges from- paneer cutlet, paneer roll, khasta kachori, samosa, radha ballavi, veg cutlet, veg chop, dahi vada, dhokla etc these are as succumbing as the desserts too. Hindustan sweets is successfully continuing its glorified reign with the same amount of dedication and devotion towards quality as always. We the people of New Alipore are proud and blessed to have such an incredible outlet in our locality.

Hindustan sweets  - The most popular Landmark. :P 
--------------
Brief:
It is located in the main road in New Alipore. They serve sweets, rasgullas and gulab jamuns. They even serve food for bulk orders. However, It has lost it's charm over the years. I remember when i used to be small, my dada used to get the small kachoris and halwa which were packed in brown paper like a pouch. It used to be my favorite and perhaps that's the only reason why i remember Hindustan sweets so well. 
--------------
Pros and Cons: 

Pros:

1) located at the prime location where bus stands are there and public travels regularly.
2) serves a large amount of public
3) sweets and rasgullas are moderately ok.
4) service is moderate

Cons:- 

1) not much of a place to buy sweets from when there are better like Kc das and Chitaranjan
2) lost its charm over the years and faces high competition from SANTOSH sweets opposite to it 
3) food quality has degraded. 
--------------
More info: I perhaps feel they have started with their branch at Spencers, south city basement. I don't have much idea how it works. There were problems in the middle at their sweet shop. But, now they have renovated again.
