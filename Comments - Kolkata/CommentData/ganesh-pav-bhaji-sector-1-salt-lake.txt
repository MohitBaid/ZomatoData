Ganesh Pav Bhaji is a small kiosk in swimming pool area of Saltlake which serves excellent pav bhaji and Vada pav at a reasonable price. 
I have tried this stall a number of times and it never disappoints me. On this particular occasion I tried Vada pav. Vada pav made by sandwiching Vada in between pavs and adding green chutney, garlic chutney and onions. But what makes difference is the powdered chutney made of garlic and coconut. It takes the taste to next level.
Highly recommend this place.
Pocket pinch - 30 per pc.

Pav bhaji, one of the most famous and tastiest Street food of India is very well made at this small stall located in the snack Street area of Saltlake Swimming pool. Starts in the evening and is always very crowded. Two or three seats have been placed but usually people prefer to parcel or taste this marvellous pav bhaji in the seats of their cars. It's a worth visit if one is in the mood to grab something spicy in the evening. :)

They give the best pav bhaji in Salt Lake if you are opting for street food. Nestled in the chaat hut itself, you can savour other dishes from different stalls as well.
