Food quality is standard but one will be hurt with their quantity. High prices with less quantity. Also sit and dine not available. Only take aways.

Earlier there was no seating.
These days due to heavy demand they made seating provisions.
Good chinese food.
Specialist in Chicken drumsticks.
A small cozy place yet delivers good food

I choose Hot Ginger's Banquet Hall for B'Day celebration of my elder son Kaustav on 16th October 2016. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience. The service, ambiance, food quality - all were very good. Would recommend people to explore this place in future. Looking forward to arrange more events in this place moving forward.

I lived nearby and so choose this for a B'Day celebration on 25th September 2016. Because of a relatively new banquet, I was a little bit of sceptical about this place. But the experience was great. Foods are of outstanding quality and me and my wife are overwhelmed by their services. This place was actually recommended by one of my friend who is a fan of this food joint. Later I went there at Durga Puja with our family members and surprisingly found that even in this rush time also they maintain the quality of foods & services. Their Chinese & Kabab variety are simply awesome. And folks, please try the Chicken Tikka Masala once.

In terms of service, management and commitment of Hot Ginger all are very poor. At the time of agreement they commit many things but on the event day they never keep their words.
I booked their banquet hall with food for B'day celebration on 4th September 2016, but their service was very low quality. They opened buffet counter for dinner at 9:10pm where I have repeatedly asked them for 8:30pm. Even they didn't provide the food item what they said at the time of agreement. 2 Food item was missing but they took full money from us. in final bill they added some charges also which was free at the time of agreement.
 When I complained they says it may happen, it is a accident.
 Now from the market I come to know that some other people also face the same thing. this is their practice. It should ban.
