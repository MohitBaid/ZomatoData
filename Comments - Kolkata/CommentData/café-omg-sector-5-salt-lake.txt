Good hangout place for those looking for good hookahs and music. There is no live performance here, but the music being played is amazing. Mind you, the hookah is great. 
Coming to the food, pasta was a tad bit sweet. Pizza was really good with a spungy yet crispy crust. For the main course, we had fried rice and chilly garlic noodles. They were both amazing to have along with Crispy chilly potatoes. There are loads of games available to pass your time with friends. 
Located on the 1st floor of the Infinity Benchmark Building, Opp RDB Boulevard in Sector V.

Whenever i am very tired and want to lie down and relax i visit this place named Cafe OMG.
This isnt really a crowd puller but i find dis place interesting coz of the interiors.
The waiters are very polite and listen to evry bit of what is told to them.
The prices are extremely easy on pockets and is a good place to hangout with friends.
Do try their bruschetta...its yum yum.

Located opposite to the pantaloons, in the infinity benchmark building on the first floor is this place. When you enter you find a very sober ambience perfect for hookah with friends. Tried out the Pan Salsa flavoured chillum, cheese garlic bread and pasta alfredo. The hookah flavour was good and was pocket-friendly. The pasta and cheese garlic bread looked promising, and were. Both tasted good. Would like to taste the pasta again.

Not quite happy with my experience.
The service was really slow. We had a two lime ice tea, one mixed sauce pasta, and an double Apple shisha. Double Apple normal shisha was priced at 270 but the bill came to be 350( They mistook it as an Apple Chillum). We didn't say anything about that.
The total bill was for Rs 989 with all the tax.
Not quite on the affordable side.

Omg! Social is a social media themed cafe. I have a somewhat mixed review of this place.
The ambience is nice but the music could be better and it was difficult to call someone to serve us since we were in the cubicle at the end. Maybe they have a bell but we didn't find one! Otherwise the service is prompt and the staff is helpful.
Coming to the food, we tried the baby corn, pasta and the pizza. The pizza was a little disappointing but the pasta was tasty and had the amount of spice that's "just right". We ordered two drinks - the pan mojito and the Oreo shake - and a sheesha as well. These were much better than the rest and I may go back just for that.
I found Omg! Social to be a good place to hang out but mostly like any other cafe. There's room for improvement but it's worth trying out once.

The ambience was very good. The sitting arrangements were casual and relaxed and you can spend long hours here. We tried arabiata pasta with white sauce, special omg pizza,cold coffee with icecream and cold coffee with blended brownie.

Pasta was ok ,spice was less which didn't suit my tastebuds. It appeared bland after few bites. Pizza was not thin crust and the sides of the pizza were over baked which made it crunchy. Not my preference. The cold coffee with icecream was ok but what impressed me the most is the cold 
coffee with blended brownie. It was awesome...!!!!! There was variation in taste ; it was bitter and sweet all together. A must have imo.

Visited 5days back.. Located at first floor of infinity benchmark we found this place crowded even on a busy Tuesday afternoon at about 3pm.. The music was way too loud for afternoon n although taste of music is very relative but still choice of songs being played needs up gradation.. The shisha tasted good.. After a long time tasted simple n sober cold coffee but the fresh lime soda was way behind being good.. But the cost makes it up for all the negatives with its super affordability

In few words, unethical and arrogant.

Unless you sit down and flip through the menu, you will not understand the menu is vegetarian. The outlet does not announce on its bill board, door or any marketing collateral that it serves only vegetarian food - the customary green dot is not there either. The menu is not displayed outside too, the way many eateries do. Even the servers are pretty unapologetic about it, and say that's how we are.
We went, sat for 20 mins, saw menu and came out. Not a single word of apology from the store.

Have been to this place quite a few times. Its located opposite rdb cinemas. Had read a review of it in telegraph t2 n so i had been waiting to come here.
Its quite a small place but well-lit.

We had ordered baked cheeses balls which were Fantastic! üëè virgin mojito was good too.
Pizza was quite a bit of disaster. Tastelessüëé
The rest of the items we have tasted on consecutive visits have been overall okay

The seating arrangements are sufficient. Though they need to thoroughly clean the sofas n the seats

The staff are polite.
Service is bit slow but i don't really mind waiting.

My BIGGEST problem with this place is their music. They either play only punjabi songs or never-heard-before songs. I've frequently noticed people asking the staff to switch the music off!

Visit this place if you have time on your hands, you want comfortable seats n pocket friendly food.

Good! This cafe located in sector V is really pocket friendly and they serve delicious food and the hookah here is also smooth and the waiters are well behaved. I tasted several items from the menu : OMG special pizza (Amazing!!), corn cheese balls baked (Best ‚ô•), kitkat shake and oreo shake evrything was delicious. 
They lose (0.5) because of there poor service. Improve the service. Otherwise keep on the good work üíØ

I loved this place because of the hookah. The hookah was very smooth , just amazing. We orderd brain freezer. In food we had mushroom pasta in white sauce which was decent enough and mexican rice with jacked potatos which was good. The music track played was amazing. Ambiance is not that great n even the interiors. Nice place to spend time. The prices are also not high.

One of the best places to hang out with your friends. I am a regular here and trust me, this place is awesome just to spend time with your friends.¬†

Food is too good, hookah they make is exceptional, prices are pretty easy on the pocket, nice music and beautiful ambiance. Service is also awesome. I just used to go there, order a hookah( they have got some amazing hookahs) and a dish like pasta or pizza and play UNO for hours with my friends.

A good place in the Salt Lake sector 5 area.

Not huge place , but a cozy set up themed on social media apps. They have cabana style sitting arrangements where each booth has one media theme like whats app, Facebook, twitter, dubsmash, Instagram etc. Great for groups who wants to have shisha. Music is loud and definitely not for cafe conversations .
We tried the MUSHROOMS ON TOAST which were cheese and mushroom topped toasted bread coming in miserly portion. Just two slices of bread with potato chips. Seriously! The CHILLI GARLIC NOODLE was just okay.
So food was not something that impressed us , but yes for a sheesha joint in sector 5 , its quite nice .

Concept based restaurants and cafes are becomimg very popular these days. OMG! Social is one such place. The area of the cafe is not that big. There are around 4 havanas and 3 to 4 other sitting areas. The walls are filled with social media sites wallpapers. They even have cushions with signs of different social media applications.

I tried hookah and my friends ordered some drinks. The most disappointing thing was they didn't have most of the things written on the menu. For hookah, the flavour that we wanted was not available. Same hapened with the moctails.

Finally, we ordered one chilly ginger mojito , one virgin mojito, one kitkat shake and one paan flavoured hookah. The Kit kat shake was delicious. It was a thick shake with lots of kitkat crunches in it. The chilly ginger mojito and the virgin mojito tasted alike but were good. The hookah was fine too.

Overall, a nice place to hangout with friends.

Location - Infinity tower, first floor , opposite RDB cinemas

Ambience- As the name suggests, the interiors of this place is different and well thought of. They have booths of different social medias like Facebook, Instagram, Dubsmash etc.
This place is a Student friendly joint with amazing offers for Hookah and food .
Food - The Mixed Sauce pasta and the Brownie with icecream are two of my favourites from this place and I definitely recommend it. Also a good try would be the Al fungi pizza!
The hookah is great and the staff is extremely friendly!

Had heard about the place from many people...so wanted to visit the place...so finally went to this place on Sunday...and frankly speaking... didn't like the Ambience...Staff was well behaved...but Service was Damn slow...wanted to leave at a point... ordered a plate of Hakka Noodles and Garlicy Mushrooms...and I can guarantee that if you haven't had Mushrooms before....they can make you hate and and never it again...I even asked the staff to do some alterations in Mushrooms as it had no taste and was full of oil...but he refused... don't know why did he do so...and Hakka Noodles...it didn't look like Hakka...it was way too thin to be called Hakka...and Hookah was ok... Only complain is regarding food... specifically Mushrooms...coz I love Mushrooms and try them everywhere I go...so it was the worst experience of my life here... I'll have to think about visiting the place again..!!

We went for a hangout with friends. After getting there and we realised it's a pure veg cafe. This is a big turn-off for bengali foodies like us. 
Tried their chilli paneer, cheese balls and some mocktails. The preparation was good and the mocktails tasted refreshing. 
The couches and cushions need some serious cleanup otherwise the decor was good.

Info :- Is a social networking platforms themed cafe...hence an interesting place to chill out wid ur inner circle..

Positives :- Quality ambience...quality food..courteous staff...fast service..

Negatives :- Though the ambience is good , it is not quite the same as one would expect in a hookah parlour...

What we had :- 1.Margerhita pizza (double cheese) ( was really good..better than any of the pizzas we had tasted in any of the cafes in and around kolkata so far)

2.Vanilla+pan rasna hookah (was mild and enjoyable)

Really worth trying out atleast once..

To be honest, the food is fine here. No complaints.

But, I don't get the theme of this place. The name is Cafe OMG ! Social. You enter, you see a lot of social media themed decor around. BUT you also see Rock Music artists decor on the walls. Plus the cushions have the King and Queen of playing cards on them. The walls have classic Hindi and English movie posters.

Anyways.

A small cafe located in infinity building, serving food and hookah at reasonable rates. We did not try their food yet, but this is quite an affordable place when you are low on cash(esp in this demonitisation phase). They have quite bright lights for a hookah parlor. Seating arrangements are quite comfortable with couches on one side and cabana type gaddas on the other. But the catch is their unhygienic sofas, cushions and everything else. They seriously need a clean up of upholstery, along with floors. This was a huge turn off for me. And the peach iced tea we got was too sweet and did not quite taste upto the mark. Hence a bit disappointed, will be looking forward to improvements.

Suddenly found this place when we wanted to pass some time we had in hand. It's opposite to RDB movie hall, easy to locate. Decoration is quite interesting although need to clean up a little as burnt cover of the mattress and untidy pillow cover was unexpected. We ordered royal paan shisha which was strong & good. Paan ice tea was interesting, cad b shake was also good. Cheese garlic bread was usual. Service was a bit delayed but stuffs are quite friendly. Pocket friendly place to visit.

ALERT: It closes down by 12-12:30.... Don't go there keeping in mind that it'll remain open till 5am... I've been there recently at 2am and had to return back!

I'd been wanting to visit this place since over a year. Finally did so today. Caf√© OMG! Social is located on the 1st floor of the building just opposite to Barbeque Nation. The most notable thing about this place is that it remains open till 5AM in the morning. As the name goes, it is actually based on the Social Media theme. The place is decorated with various Social Media icons such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Dubsmash and so on. I really liked the d√©cor which is quite vibrant and lively. Though not so big, the place provides private booths, each for around 4-5 people, having comfortable seating arrangement with funky cushions. Other seating arrangements are couches as well as a big one which can accommodate upto 10. They play good music over here. Overall, interior and ambience is good.

Coming to food, well we had ordered
Cottage Cheese Pizza (pretty ok)
Family Garlic Bread (quite different as the bread was not baked, the taste was plain ok and the bread served was bland)
Mixed Sauce Pasta (decent)
Corn Cheese Balls (quite good, served with Mayo dip)
Paprika Pizza (was OK, I felt it was a bit too dry)
Crispy Chilli Babycorn (it was yumm)
Ice Cappuccino (pretty decent)
KitKat Shake (quite good!!)
Pan Mojito (unique... First time ever tried Mojito in Paan flavour, was great!!!!)
and a couple of other Mocktails and Sheesha.
So food was a mixture, won't say it was great, yet not even bad. The drinks were though quite good. The rates are quite on the reasonable side.
Won't mind visiting this place again in future!
Allover, a nice and funky place to hang out with friends! :)

Review on 2nd Visit: Some additional points!!
1. I'm simply in love with their seating arrangement....!! Ahh...the more than super comfortable ground level seating area with the cushions.... It surely takes a lot of strength to stop you from lying down!!
2. Their Mixed Sauce Pasta & Chilly Cheese Toast.... Big Muaaahhhhhhh!!!! <3

Review on 3rd Visit: I went over there on my Birthday night for dinner...!! What made me upgrade my review from 4.5 to 5 is the complementary 2 scoops of Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream topped with Chocolate Sauce.... specially for my Birthday! Now, I'm in love with this place!! üòò
On that day itself, I tried their OMG Pasta!! It's heavenly!!!! It's a MUST TRY!! Mixed Sauce Pasta baked in Cheese....yummy!!! Their Chinese Sizzler was also quite good, I mean I loved the Rice and Noodles, though I was disappointed with the Manchurian Dumplings.... they need to work on that!
Thanksss Caf√© OMG! Social for the Ice Cream!! üç®üíùüç®

Coming to food - we  had lasagne;  mexican sizzler ; baked nachos ; cold coffee; mojito ; cafe  omg social special shake and  5 topping pizza!

I loved the pizza and lasagne a lot and mojito was very refreshing!

We ordered Margreata Pizza, Pasta Alfredo and Blueberry Peach Sheesha. The food was too good. I am a pizza lover and I'm not at all disappointed from this place. The interior gives you a soothing feel, peppy music was on, the feel in the cafe was awesome. It's a very good place to hangout with friends. It's a pocket friendly place as well. Loved it.

Location-Sector5,Saltlake.

We went to this place at 11:00pm after a dandiya program at manisquare.It was full and we have to wait for about 15 minutes to grab a table.As the name suggest this whole cafe has been been decorated on "Social" theme.As you enter you will see its entrance been decorated as an iphone lock screen.Inspite of having a smaller area,it has been utilized very well to scrape out most from it.This place has 5 parlour as seating area,each depicting different social media platform along with few separate table to seat.It can accomodate 45-50 people at a time.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place was extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are quite eye-catching and the waiter bell was also a new idea.The seating was also very comfortable and the cushions were extremely adorable.

Service-The service of this place was fast and reliable.Inspite of having such a heavy crowd they served us quite fast.The staff was also polite and cooperative.

Food-The food at this place was good but the sheesha served was quite choking(changed later).We had-
1:Cheese Garlic bread
2:Penne paprika mix sauce
3:Cad-B shake 
4:szechwan noodle
5:Teen paan sheesha
All this was served at a very pocket friendly prices.

Food-4/5
Service-4/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

This place is a must visit and we really appreciate the interiors and price at which the food was served.üòÉüòÉ

Located on the first floor of Infinity Benchmark building right opposite RDB at Sector 5, this cafe impressed us all despite being in the midst of popular peers like Downing Street and Pour House. Omg Social is one of the brightest hookah parlours I've ever come across in Calcutta. The ambience is pretty good with different cabanas dedicated to popular social apps like Dubsmash, Snapchat, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram among the others. We were lucky enough to have got the Dubsmash one which is very cozy and comfortable if you are in a group of 6-7 people.
Coming to food, we ordered an OMG special pizza, Mexican rice and garlic bread. We also ordered the caramel crunch shake, the CadB shake and Nutella shake.
Pizza had mayonnaise on top of it which was the main attraction but it turned out to be average. It can be made better with softer crust and more cheese. Mexican rice was really good - a must try! Garlic bread was again very average and needs to be worked upon. The shakes were good, the nutella shake being the clear winner.
Coming to other pros and cons, a big pro is definitely availability of board games and cards like UNO here. The staff was very courteous too. However, one con was the music they played. Even after requesting the staff thrice to change the sad depressing music that was being played, our request was not fulfilled.
A big thumbs up to this place anyway. Must visit on weekends!

This cafe is totally dedicated to social media! It's quite spacious,where one wall is lined with white sofas and the other wall has 4-5 parlours lined to it with partitions where people can sit in groups. Each parlour is dedicated to depicting popular apps like Instagram,Dubsmash,Twitter,Facebook,Snapchat,etc. The walls are lined with posters based on social media. Even the cushions have logos of various apps on them. The door through which u enter the cafe is made to look like a phone's lockscreen :-p. It all combines to make the place quite cosy,where you can sit with your friends for hours with a hookah and some food. The staff is polite here,which is always a plus point. Also,this place stocks board games. Have tried few hookah flavours here which were good. Haven't actually had anything to eat here yet except waiwai. Overall,I can say is that the ambience wins u over in this place with its quirky 'Social' outlook :-)

Today was probably my 4th visit to this cafe, which was highly disappointing. Previous visits have been great, they have good food, ambience and the hookah is fine, quite reasonable as well. But after today i have hygiene issues. 
We ordered mixed sauce pasta, crispy chilli babycorn, noodles, hookah and three different drinks one of which was green apple icy blend and it had a "fingernail" in it. Yes, sounds disgusting and unbelievable but it's true. However, one of my friends threw it away, i asked the person who took our order to look into it.
They said the person who made it is denying that anything like this could happen but they were ready to replace it. We were getting late so we told them to exclude it from the bill but they refused to do that and nonetheless replaced the drink but it was left on the table because we had to leave. To avoid unnecessary argument we paid and left. 
Even if everything is good but i get "fingernails" in my drinks i don't think i would like to revisit.

Please Push the door to open! ;)
Well I was bit annoyed having returned from Cafe unplugged which was open, dirty, loud, renovations under progress, dark and was expecting something soothing for a hookah.
As I opened the door and walked in, I loved the concept of their seating. Opened my shoes and got on the lounge sofa. Pretty comfortable though. Good and ambient lights. Nice staff. Awesome music played here. Ample privacy.
The Shisha (hookah) was clean and nice. Tried the Kiwi flavor after loads of brainfreezers. Liked it and was light. The food as in Garlic bread and Crispy Babycorn was nice. While the crispiness was limited to few babycorns, not all. :(
The cold coffee was nice again, but not as thick. It was bit light. Please make sure to specify if you are looking for a thicker one instead. They were out of stock on the pizza, as they were short on the pizza base. I generally like the cafe pizzas, which are way different than the domino's, etc. and tastier to my tongue. Will be looking forward for them when I return.
Overall, concept is nice and services are good.

Went here on 18th July ....
The place is socially decorated and looks good. We went at nite arnd 11:30 and surprisingly it was full.
The A.C. wasn't working well and that's why I deducted .5 from rating or else it deserves 4.5
I don't take hookah but my friends said they loved it so I will go with that .
The food
1. Stacked quesadilla was good. Well cooked and taste was also good with proper serving.
2. Cheese Fondue average the cheese was too thin. It was served well and in good quantity but the cheese spoiled it all.
2. Ice tea was awesome. We ordered the paan ice tea and it was just wowww....
3. Cadb shake was also good.
All in all it was a good experience except for the cheese and ac. And was pretty reasonable three people and the bill stacked up only 1000.
Definitely trying this place and would also recommend.

Best part is that it remains open in the dead hours. If you are tired of visiting the other hookah bars late at night, give this a try. They don't serve the best of food but we, the night owls, just need something to eat with hookah and they provide just that. Crowd is not bad here and the music is loud and good.

Everything is good except the food.

This is a new caf√© in the IT district of the city.
Located in the Infinity building, opposite RDB Cinemas; at 1st floor, next to Ocean Grill Restaurant.
The interior and ambience is possibly one of the best in town in terms of theme-based indoor cafeteria.
Cozy sofas and bright interiors.The caf√© is designed,keeping in mind the young generation and their love for social media.
There are individual cabanas dedicated to every social media platform. The interior is quite quirky and spacious. Each table has a board game or a card game for fun-filled engagement as time passes by. The music is perfect and just too good;especially if you are already in a "good" mood. The staff is friendly and attentive. We had a crazy round of dare with everyone in the caf√© and it was fun and absolutely hilarious.

The food isn't good at all.
On the plate: our order of crispy chilli baby corn seemed like an overfried batter of baby corn topped with sesame seeds; little burnt on the inside and was hard to dig in with a fork. The Chinese sizzler was filling; with noodles,fried rice and veg manchurian; but the noodles and rice tasted awful with a strong smell of butter,addition and mixing of improper proportions of spices,traces of undercooking which spoilt the flavour.
Up in the air: The blueberry hookah was mild,which isn't surprising.
In the glass: caramel crunch, cad-b shake and brownie all the way.The sips weren't disappointing though. The mojitos are kickass.
They serve vegetarian food only and they have no plans to serve non vegetarian food in the future. That's not a problem,only if they improve their magic of cooking inside the kitchen and serve tastier things on the plate and improve the taste of their present dishes.

Pocket friendly for sure!
A better alternative to chai break(except food).

Salt Lake Sector V doesn‚Äôt really have shortage of places serving hookah. So opening a normal shisha caf√© is a hefty challenge for any new enterprise. Caf√© OMG Social is located on the first floor of the Infinity Benchmark building, bang opposite to RDB Boulevard, being right in the heart of Sector V. There are quite a few newly opened pubs and cafes situated in close proximity, which act as severe competition and Caf√© OMG Social has to pull up its socks to get going.

The place is relatively smaller than other cafes but the limited space has been managed well in order to scrape out maximum seating capacity possible. There is also cabana type setup of seating. The interiors are bright with vivid use of colours. The icons of various social media websites and apps have been used to good effect while designing the walls.

I had been here on a casual visit with friends on a weekday afternoon and was surprised to see the place almost full. We sat down on the comfy sofas and ordered a Blueberry and a Brain Freezer hookah. The hookah wasn‚Äôt good initially but after a complaint to the staff, they rectified it. We also ordered several drinks, being, Nutella Shake, Kitkat Shake and Iced Tea. Both the shakes were fine and had distinct tastes. The Iced Tea was average.

The service here is satisfactory. They provide for some table games as well. The pricing is also okayish. Overall a nice experience.

Located on the 1st floor of infinity benchmark tower , opposite RDB on the IT hub of Kolkata, this cafe tops my list. With the wonderful decor and cabbanas arranged linearly this place offers the perfect setting. We ordered chilli babycorn, Mexican sizzler, lasagne, KitKat shake, ferrero rocher shake, Choco avalanche and pan mojito. All tastes good but the Choco avalanche was best both in taste and looks. The ferrero rocher shake resembled the KitKat shake, thus was useless to spend 40rs extra. Although both were good. The babycorn was crisp and mouthwatering. Overall this was the best cafe that suited to my pocket providing satisfying taste .

Went there with little expectations. However was pleasantly surprised. Ambience is good with a theme around social networking sites. Small seating area but no compromise on the comfort level. The cabanas look pretty. Food was good and so was the service. Located in the heart of sector 5. Pocket pinch is not very high either. Worth a visit!

This place has a very vibrant atmosphere. With cabanas inside it and the loud music with the hookah and the board games, this is the place if you want to chill out. Hardcore non vegetarians, be warned this is not the place for you.... 
The vegetarian pasta was really good and the pan mojito was different. I also tasted the mango mojito which was good.

The price is definitely a bit on the higher side.

Overall the food gets a big thumbs up from me!

Seating provision is again good and so is the food. The only drawback i felt there was the staff- they were totally understaffed which hampered the services critically otherwise it would have been FULL 5

Location: Salt lake, sector 5. Head towards the RDB boulevard, and enter the huge building right opposite to it. Take the escalator, this caf√© is on the first floor.

My friends frequent this place. So I decided to tag along today for some adda sessions. The entrance glass door is designed as a lock screen. As u enter, to you left you'll find cabanas themed as facebook,instagram,WhatsApp,dubsmash. There are two tvs and the music they play is amazing.

Staff was extremely polite. Not just because my friends come here everyday, but with everyone they were polite and jovial.

We ordered two hookahs on a 1:1 offer. So basically we had to pay for one and the other was free. We relaxed over a session of UNO and Jenga. There are other games as well such as Batlefield, etc.

We weren't really hungry, so didn't order any food, but my friends love this caf√©s food as well.

Great place to chill and the best part is that our bill was a meager 380 bucks(inclusive of tax )! Recommended!

This one has nice quirky interiors. Rather saying, socially sound interiors. Cabanas dedicated to different social networking apps and variety of board games available. We tried pan mojito which was different. Fresh lime and KitKat shake was decent. We tried mexican sizzler which had mexican rice, nachos and sauteed veggies with black beans. It was average. We tried lasagne which was good. Hookah was fine. Service was a bit slow, maybe because the place was full. Prices are pocket friendly.

They have 3 compartments with net curtains draped over where u can get up and sit cross legged, WhatsApp, Snapchat and Instagram compartments (you can also sit there entire day on weekends for some minimum order amount!) They have board games, cards. Now speaking about food, it's simply amazing. Although its  pure veg but food tastes yummy. The mojitos are amazing. Try omg special mojito, pan mojito, omg risotto! Pocket pinch isn't much considering the fact tat prices are all inclusive of taxes. They just take service charge. Sheesha available too

The service is sometime a bit slow when it's too crowded but its obviously normal 
Otherwise is very gud
The staff behaviour and management is really appreciable.
With the offers of this cafe I guess is the best  not only in salt lake but all over the south or any side
I really love the neon ambience 
I love to come with my friends and even if I come alone I don't feel alone
Most importantly this cafe have maintained the standard of the crowd as well as the quality.
Special thankful to Neil and other staff for being very friendly.

The food tasted okay, but it wasn't prepared according to our specifications. We dint really complain, coz the waiters or the staff weren't willing to listen or rather they dint have the time to!! Overall experience wasn't good. We had come for birthday celebrations, but wrapped up fast and chose to hop on to some place else! Very importantly, the cafe staffs need to be trained well.

Located in Sector 5 this place is all abt the social network theme nicely decorated and well thot. You have a bed area wer you can relax and lye dwn and a basic chair table side.. they have calling bells in each table so you dnt have to look around for service persons to call them.. 
Starting with; the food and drinks are normal, nothing new to jwell ur bell the hookah is fairly good.. 
Ratings for the theme and an average service with a not so average quality of food..

Heard about the cafe from few of my friends so decided to visit this cafe. As we entered the cafe we loved the interior such as optimum utilisation of the space, the cabana style of seating, the calling bottom for the stewards. The hookah was really nice and smooth and moreover they have happy hour on hookah which allows you to buy one fruit shisha and get another normal shisha for free which so pocket friendly for college students like us. Food was very good and really liked the staff as they were very cordial and attentive.
We had a good time but there was one major set back which is 2 uncles patrolling the cafe. They were patrolling and then came and sat on the table in front of us. We felt bit uncomfortable as one of them seemed to be of my grandfather's age. Puffing shisha in front of them put me on an embarrassing situation.
Tuesday was my 3rd visit to the cafe and everytime the same uncles were patrolling. This does not go with the culture in which the cafe is made. Hope to see management does something about it.
The starters were good enough. Wi Wi, French fries, OMG Mocktail, Babycorn etc was some of the dishes i tried which was delicious. 
This place is my favourite now.:-) 
Happy times :-)

Neon lights seems to be something impressive..... Crowd is good..... Food is amazing..... Hukka is good too.... Lasts long..... Descent service (it has scope of improvement)....

Ambience: Sexy and Stylish
Service: Good
Hookah: Great
Food: Good
Timing: Awesome

One of the most trending cafe currently in town...

They have done full justice to the name... Lovely interiors to match with the name and thus the ambience is Sexy and Stylish... Needless to say we need more such cafe in Kolkata...

I'v visited OMG Social a couple of times now.. People hv misjudged this place if they judged it based on their first visit on its soft launch. Its upgraded to 3 LED TVs. Its got an awesome location, Unbeatable prices, better selection of food than many of the other shisha joints..

Also worth a mention.. Its open from 11am to 5am! Unique theme and exclusively segregated seating arrangements. Absolutely love that they tried something different with their theme and this is the only place where I don't hv to keep calling the waiter by saying bhaiya or excuse me.. They'v come up with a solution for that with a simple bell. Genius!

People don't need to be harsh with their critic of the food and the staff... Its not a 3 star restaurant!!! Its a cafe with good hookah n food. The staff is polite and quick to serve. Met the owner too.. He's a young guy.. Really sweet and welcoming (cute too!)

All in all... 4.5 for the efforts. Its only going to get better with time. Best wishes!

Avoid to visit this place on weekends!! It's overcrowded, and too smoky. I was so offended to visit this place on a weekend. Management, please work on the ventilation!!
But then I planned to visit on a weekday, this place was almost empty when we entered. They have happy hours (buy a fruit chillam hookah, and get one normal hookah free) from 11 p.m to 6 p.m and then again from 12 a.m to 5 a.m. Yes, this place is opened till 5 in the morning. 
The ambiance is average. An out of the box theme. But the music they play is not upto the mark. Please play some good tracks. 
The food is also average, we had ordered a pizza, cheese garlic bread and lasagne. The cheese garlic bread and lasagne was average, but the pizza was not at all good. It was so hard. 
The hookah lasts for about 50 minutes. 
The seating arrangement is best out here. You can almost sleep there. And they have many board games to play as well, and masks which you can put on for clicking some photos.

I had first heard of this place in t2; and it being very near to my college, I just had to visit it. It's located on the first floor of Infinity Benchmark building, where Mitra Cafe was previously located.
Decor & Ambience :
This cafe will take you by surprise with its quirky 'Social' outlook as they call it. The area has been utilized brilliantly, with 5 parlors depicting our favorite social media apps i.e. Whatsapp, instagram, snapchat, etc. The cushion covers are really adorable ! Other than these parlors there are many comfortable sofas where you can relax.

Food-Drinks-Hookah:
We took the Double Apple Fruit Chillum hookah, and we got another hookah free with it , so we opted for Teen Paan. The hookah flavors were brilliant and dense. They make the fruit chillum hookah really well. We took three drinks as well. One cranberry iced drink, and other two were grape and mango. All the drinks were really fresh ;the Cranberry one is really worth mentioning as they even added some berries in the drink.
Now the food here is vegetarian, but the waiters told us that the non veg menu will be there in a month's time. I'm eagerly waiting for it !
Now since we were from IEM, they gave us 10% students discount. I have been twice here already.
A private party was going on there the second time we went. Well decorated and managed too. A birthday party here would be so cool !

My recommendation:
Console gaming has not started here as of yet. I really look forward to it. A weekly FIFA tournament would really spice up things here.

I am in love with the look and feel of the Cafe its really OMG and you really socialise there so its called Social and This is my second visit and I still in love with the ambience. Coming to the service the staff is very cordial and friendly. I love pan mojito, OMG Shisha which they served with Red Bull , Cheese balls , OMG Special Pizza and Wai Wai Chef Special. One should definitely try all these. I and my friends thoroughly enjoyed the place.I loved the way they serve their customers. I saw one group celebrating their birthday and Cafe OMG arranged for them so well so my next birthday celebration is surely booked there.

Located right at the heart of Sec-V(The hub of it in kolkata).Opposite Barbeque Nation.Its really convinient to locate.Ample spaces to park your vehicles,makes it even more hassle free.Its one of a kind being the first Social Media Themed Cafe i have been to.With lamps and cushions designed with great care resembling the logos of Facebook,Snapchat,Whatsapp etc. Are a treat.The staffs are courteous and friendly.Plus the Monopoly and Uno cards make it an awesome adda and hangout place.Hookahs are at their best and foods' awesome as well.Definite try outs and my favourites would be the Pan flavoured Virgin Mojito (Might be there soon for a refill ),The piZzas' (Thin crust wonderfully made).Awesome vibes from this place unlike others.Here's wishing all the very best to team...Cheerio

The combination of delicious Food, Smokey Sheesha and the bling of Social Media themed interior makes ‚ÄòCaf√© OMG! Social‚Äô a perfect destination to treat your taste buds.  

The Awe struck moment starts from the entrance gate designed as iPhone Lock Screen. As we enter, the interiors will make any person to appreciate the smart thinker, for the Social media theme which now plays an important role in everyone‚Äôs daily life. Logos, hashtags, cushion covers of football clubs, Instagram, Facebook and many more are eye catchy.

They have Cabanas with choice of Social Media theme you love, like Facebook Zone, Instagram Zone, SnapChat, Whatsapp, Dubsmash etc. The uniqueness is the call bell. The logo outside your Cabana flickers when you press the call bell which is a unique way to call your table attendant. So now no raising hands like school or yelling excuse me to draw not only your attendant‚Äôs attention but also of other visitors.

The great taste of food and drinks, perfect concoction of flavors of hookah and Staff‚Äôs friendly nature are the few reasons to list to visit this place again and again. #perfectAdda

Visited Cafe on Saturday with 4 of my Frndz after 7pm

Ambience : Nice Concept with Social Zones, Small Space but Cozy & Spacious.

Staff : They have only 1 staff who is catering to all the tables. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT 

Food : We ordered Masala Chips, Supreme Nachos, Garlic Bread Cheese & Garlic Bread Supreme. It took nearly 20mins to get food rolling to the Table. After a 20mins wait what we got is Masala Chips which was Salty & Others food items were just too Avg to Eat.

Hookah : We ordered Teen Paan Rose. It had no flavour & was a bit chocking.

Bonus to All this : Open Mic with some sick band who were Irritating the Ear Buds out.

Value For Money : We paid approx 1k & i dont think it was worth the amount paid

Would never like to Visit again & would never recommend anyone to visit this Cafe

Cafe omg social is a newly opened cafe in sector 5 in the infinity benchmark building opposite RDB building. The cafe is open whole night till 5am in the morning and it is a great alternative to chai break. As we entered we were amazed by the social media themed interiors, it was very cool and catchy. They have different sections consisting of facebook, instagram, snapchat, whatsapp, dubsmash, etc. Seating arrangement is also comfortable and relaxing. The staffs were cordial and polite and greeted us well. Sheesha is priced very low at 250 rupees and they have happy hours where you get 2 sheesha at the price of one. We ordered royal paan and godfather flavoured hookah and both were great. The mojitos were refreshing and specially the pan virgin mojito which stood out. Coming to food, the prices are very moderate and quantity is also very good. The presentation of food deserves special mention. We tried their cheese garlic bread, pasta, crispy chilli babycorn, veg au gratin and omg special pizza. Though all the food were awesome but the pizza stood out for us. They gave complimentary shots with the bill which was a great gesture. So overall it was a great experience and the place was very awesome. I would definitely visit this place again and would recommend to all.

I'm not going to speak about the interiors, everyone has done that. The interior is very catchy. Although the space of the place is small, it's very spacious (airy) with very comfortable seating.

It is easy to locate. Right opposite RDB, on the 1st floor of the Infinity Building.

Coming to the staff, they are cordial and patient enough to answer you your queries.

Happy Hours are really happy! At ‚Çπ350/-  (excluding tax) they provide you one normal Hukah and a fruit chilling Hukah. That's like a treat for the Hukah lovers.

A bell for calling the staff in each cabana. The interesting fact being that the logo outside the cabana flickers to indicate the staff that you're wanting something. That was unique!

Virgin Mojito Paan based is a must order. Since I came in the afternoon hours, I was too full to try their food, for which I will return to this place.

Overall, a great experience. All credits to the theme and service. Kudos!

The cafe is themed very well with social media applications. Food quantity is really good..coming to the quality of the food..we ordered fruit chillum hookah with gum supari flavour,babycorn,chiili garlic noodles and cookie crunch shake..
‚Ä¢Chilli garlic noodles tasted really nice,
‚Ä¢Babycorn was average..the chef needs to improve it a bit as it was not crispy enough..
‚Ä¢Hookah was really nice..we got a great offer on it.
‚Ä¢Coming to the shake..I must say it was super tasty..I actually ordered 4 of it because it was that tasty..

Prices of all the food was also reasonable..

Overall i would like to tell that it is a great place to hangout with friends. It's a treat for vegetarians as they serve only veg food.

Must visit !üëç‚ù§

The idea of a social cafe was enticing enough to enter this newly opened cafe at sector v. Located inside the building opp the rdb boulevard, this cafe is located on the first floor of Infinity Benchmark. 
On entering the place looked like a usual hookah parlour. 
The management has tried to bring in the concept of emerging social media and how important it has become in our lives with few posters and backlight social media logo boxes. However, overall the decor falls short of expectations.
The owner was very welcoming and hospitable but overall service was very disappointing. 
We ordered for a Royal Paan flavor hookah which was good. 
The nutella shake was nice but a little too sweet for my liking. 
The pizza was a omg special pizza with six toppings namely, Paneer, capsicum, olives, jalapenos, onions and baby corn but mostly some toppings were missing! The pizza was very oily and just about average. 

Our bill was 870 and honestly I didn't find the place value for money. 

I don't think I can recommend the place at the moment. 
The owner/ management needs to make a marathon improvement in terms of food, service and ambiance. 

Good luck!

Omg social is a newly opened cafe and a hookah parlour located in sector 5 in the infinity benchmark building just next to mission cafe.
As the name says OMG SOCIAL the cafe is totally designed and interiorised in the form of social media,that can be seen as soon as you enter the cafe . The cafe is being themed in the form of different social media apps like Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Snapchat,
Whatsapp,Dubsmash.
Its totally a new concept and something really innovative as in today's world people are more of addicted to such apps in our smartphones so in short it can be called a smartcafe with amazing hookah and food...I have been to this cafe couple of times and was always impressed by their hospitality provided by the staffs..
Their seating Arrangements are very very comfortable and that is the best part of this cafe as they provide different sections where a couple of friends can sit chill and enjoy their heart out...
Must try-Virgin mojito PAN based mocktail & their specialised fruit chillam hookah.For all those who haven't yet visited this cafe its a must visit place...

We discovered this place somedays back. It is newly opened Sheesha Joint and cafe. It is located in Sector V area. Well this place is very near to my office. And I have been to this place a couple of times. They have themed the cafe very well with all the social media applications. Once you enter the cafe it sort of takes you to a whole new social media world. The concept looks very innovative. Interiors of this cafe are very nicely done. It's definitely a place to chill after a long day at work. The ambience itself makes you relax.
The staffs and the service providers are very friendly and courteous. 
I have tried the fruit chilam hukkas here ! And they are amazing. All the hukkas here are mind blowing.
Coming to the food part I have had the following things:
‚Ä¢Virgin Mojito - This drink is refreshing and had perfect flavours. Made very well.
‚Ä¢Red Bull Trash Can - This drink was also made pretty well but should have been served in a wide glass since the red bull keeps spilling from the can when it is tilted downwards.
‚Ä¢Cappuccino - The coffee was warm and strong. After a stressful day it's a great escape.
‚Ä¢ Ice Tea - The Ice Tea tasted good but wasn't served chilled though.
‚Ä¢French Fries- The quantity for the French fries was quite filling and the fries were crispy and fresh.
‚Ä¢Veg Platter - Since this place only serves veg so one should try the veg platter which consists of French Fries, Potato Wedges, Veg Tikkies, Fried Babycorn and Garlic Potato Shots served with mayonnaise and sweet chilli dips.

Overall this place awesome! It's surely worth a visit. Treat for the vegans since everything they serve is veg.

Located opposite RDB, sector 5, Saltlake city. New concept cafe, related to social media. Different section, consisting of snapchat, dubsmash, instagram, Facebook. Food quantity and quality was good. Shisha at a reasonable price. Small outlet but worth visiting with the group of friends. Music was good. Staffs were courteous and welcoming. We had ordered for shisha, nachos supreme, Veg. Burger, chocolate milk shake. For shisha they gave neon filter, impressive. Ambience was good. 
Must visit.

Wifi Available (Good Speed)
Open 11 Am to 5 Am

Seating Capacity - The Place has a seating of roughly 45 - 55 Pax. Very Comfortable, Laid back relaxing sections very similar to aqua java ones, including Sofas. Huge Pro is its segregation of tables, thus giving an air of privacy to groups of 4-6 Pax.

Shisha - Priced Very low in comparision to its competeters in kolkata, a mere 250 Rs. Inclusive of taxes, is a huge pro. Shisha lasts for and Average of 60-70 Minutes. No Extra Coal Charges. The smoke is good, but can use a boast now and again. No complaints though.

Food & Bevarage- Awesome Prices, Very Moderate, most helpful towards daily IT crowd of Sec V, who would have avoided the place on a regular basis if it was Pocket Pinching. Taste & Presentation deserve a full 5/5. I have tried there Chilly Cheese Burger, Spring Roll & Pizzas, and had no complaints. In the Drinks Segmant I recommend the Social Signature Mocktail & Shake. No Non Veg is the only con.

Staff - Courteous & Polite, Asks the right questions and delivers on time.

Live Screening - Large LED's Situated all around, so that the fours & sixes are not missed.

Interiors & Concept - 5/5. A unique and innovative design, keeping up with the trends of the social media world is engaging.
Specially Love the Waiter Bell, Kudos on whovevers idea that was. Music System and song selection is great.

Only Advise is a little Crowd Screening during Nights. Cheers.

All in all, despite surrounded by Big Leagues of The Food, Hookah & Alcohol Providers, Cafe OMG Social is going to make a great presence in sector V.

Cheers. Good Luck.

Just dropped in to check out this newly opened cafe...we were a little skeptical about it...and to our surprise the ambience caught our eyes..and we decided to try it out..!! The cabbanas were beautifully designed with the trending social sites and apps...with lovely cushions all related to these sites..!! 
The food we ordered was really good...and service delivered was friendly as well. Definitely this is new in the city and seems quite hopeful...we wish to visit again...!!!

To be honest, even before i entered the cafe i was in awe of it. The gate was stylized as an iPhone lock screen. The ambience is very uber cool with themes youth can easily connect. They have cushion covers of football clubs, cards, instagram, Fb, snapchar, poker n what not. 
But then we ordered hookah, food and drinks. Hookah was good and i really loved the neon filter they provided. Drinks were average but the food.... It was pathetic. Cheese balls lacked liquid cheese fillings, chinese sizzler was as bland as it could get n was not sizzling at all. I could literally use my fingers to eat. Plus they didn't had anything different to offer on their menu.
One more drawback was no IPL streaming available. All in all an average experience.
