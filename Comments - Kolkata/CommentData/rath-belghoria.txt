If you are not extremely hungry, its better to avoid this place.
Ordered egg chow and chili chicken. Both were equaly bad. Even a street food corner is better than  this.

Decent place. Well the place is quite small so the sitting arrangement isn't that great but I have to admit that the food quality is great. From chowmein to fried rice. . . Everything tastes exceptionally good and the place is quite crowded as well.

Very ordinary food. The delivery service is not always good. If high on demand, you will receive one \ biryani after 2.5 hours! In the meantime the owner will not receive your call to give you any information when will the order be delivered!

Very bad food quality and taste. It was good some years back but now it has detoriated.  

They cook very unhealthy food. Too much oil.

Used to be good sit in restaurant when it was opened, on the First floor providing a good view overlooking the Busy streets.
Fall from grace has occurred since then. Poor quality food, poor ambience, poor service poor everything. 
And don't bother getting takeouts either. Biriyani is quite tasteless; If you want rolls, just cross the road and go to newly opened Zaffrani. The cashier lady who sits at the front desk has the most foul attitude ever!

Visit/order for home delivery if and only if you are too hungry and if you don't have any other option. Their food is good sometimes, sometimes they are bad. In fact, most of the times. I had to visit this restaurant or order for home delivery because I had no other option in my area. Their delivery system is good when not on demand. Else, if you order a chicken Biryani at 6 PM, your order will be delivered at 10:30 PM after several calls (my home is only 5 minutes walking distance from the outlet). They need a good manager and a decent cook. I feel sad when I see that they are located in such an awesome spot, but doing so bad in business. :(
