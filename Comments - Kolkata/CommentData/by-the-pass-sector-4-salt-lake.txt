Very bad, mom and roll r really disgusting. 
We eat because we buy and no time to return. 
We don't know they have returned policy or not. 
The cook is really very bad.

Don't know of other food but I am a big fan of their Momo. It tastes magnum. But the only drawback for the rating u see beside is because of the pathetic hygiene. BY The Pass is situated BY a dirty gutter. It smells and the puking-factor is flies hover over the place randomly. Who knows, these flies might be the one from the gutter.

It is a really good initiative.  
I liked their food .. and they are gradually making there place in the area ...  
I think one should try their momo. 
Sometimes I get my meal from their store. And it's Good with a bit of homely touch.
