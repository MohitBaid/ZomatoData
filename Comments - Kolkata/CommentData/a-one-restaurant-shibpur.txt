This place was at a stone throw distance from my school. However, i have been there only once. It is basically a take away join with only 2 tables and few chairs.. Had only tasted their biryani back when i was in school.. It didn't quite appeal to my taste buds.. It was oily and the chicken piece in the biryani was hard.. But given the price, i guess nothing much can be expected..
