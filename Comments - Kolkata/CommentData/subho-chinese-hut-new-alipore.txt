Personally I feel that they should be rated better,the quality and quantity of their food is sumptous compared to their pricing.Very Pocket friendly even for options of a Student Rave

Lots of variety at very low price.
But since the price is low the quality is also not too high.
It is a small food stall. But still has quite a large number of visitors

Delicious food. Reasonable has a new definition over here. And the food is worth the pocket pinch. Pan fried momo and crispy baby corn specially recommended.

Just beside Anamika Roll Centre, This place offers Good Momos, and Noodles. I have tried them a few number of times and I have liked those to be frank. It's a decent food joint with good quality of food. ☺

"You haven't had Chinese food like this in the entire city."
That's what my friend claimed when he was insisting us to come here. And he was right. Subho is a small street side joint which really delivers. On taste basis, I'm tempted to give this place a 5. But the hygiene freak in me doesn't allow it. Anyway the food at Subho is just unbelievably good. It'll leave you wanting for more whether you're veg or non veg. We tried the steamed momos, pan fried spring rolls and the Hakka noodles. Whilst the momos were average, the spring roll was too good. And the Hakka noodles was more of Mongolian noodles and was simply delicious. Do try. The pricing is reasonable as well.

A typical roadside Chinese stall right beside New Alipore Triangular Park and beside Anamika Roll Center....what caught my attention was the mob and the rush and with curious eyes, i found that to be a small chinese food hub....the scene gave three indication, food is  good, cheap and served fast...hence i parked my bike to take a look....they didnt have a menu but when i took a look, it seems like they serve the basic chowmein...fried rice...chicken and momo stuff....atleast most of the people eating around had those in their plates and they were literally hogging them up....lol....apologies for staring at others plates but thats the only option to understand what to order in such places....when i asked for the menu, they said, what do you want....a little confused, i took the safe route to order a plate of steamed chicken momos parcel....and handed over a note of 100....and to my surprise, they returned 60...thats darn cheap, at times so much cheap that i get scared with the contents and ingredients....nevertheless, the momos were made right in front and looked fresh as you can see from the pics....they were quickly packed in a silver foil with a pack of sauce and i left...

coming to the taste of the momos, they were really good...juicy, adequately stuffed with chicken and not cabbage and onions in abundance that i expected at that price....what makes the momos taste great is the accompanying sauce and it was good too in this case...spicy red, gives a kick but then doesnt burn for a long time....i was happy to get to know about this place.....very decent, i will try the other stuff next time but definitely a thumbs up at the first impression......nothing fancy, stand and eat or take away, i love such eateries and this is what makes Kolkata differrent from some of the big metros....i wish people write more about this places....becuase at times the real taste of the city is not in big flasy eateries but in small gems like this.....

It is a food stall right beside Anamika's, outside the Triangular park in New Alipore. I have tried Mongolian and Steamed momos and both were worth having it again. 
The quantity is very much sufficient. Not a great place for dining there sitting over plastic stools, but I always prefer takeaway.

Fabulous momos and Noodles with good ingredients like red cabbage, broccoli , mushroom etc. I like to stand myself and have the noodles and rice made.

Its a take away joint loacted adjacent to triangular park new alipore. Basically a fast food joint . momos were tasty but the noodle was very bland , and chicken pcs were really very small . Overall its good cant expect much at such low prices.
