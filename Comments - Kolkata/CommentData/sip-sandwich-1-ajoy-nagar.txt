It's a small food joint in front of metropolis mall, Hiland Park. We ordered coleslaw sandwich, butterscotch milkshake and cold chocolate milkshake. The food was really good and the price is also reasonable.

I ordered a penne pasta in white sauce with chicken as add-on just now from this outlet. I must say I am quite impressed. I had mentioned in the comments area so that they give generous amount of chicken in the pasta and I wasn't disappointed - I got chicken in almost every bite. Also, the pasta was loaded with veggies - sweet corn, broccoli, capsicum (red, yellow, green) so it tasted yum.

Its a okay type snacks bar. PASTA is good. Sandwiches are little hard to eat. And price is also just okay with respect to quality and quantity. Overall an average remarks for this.

A small kiosk just in front of the big bazar at hiland park. I have availed the services of swiggy twice to try their sandwich & shakes. Till date i have had the following:-

1. Chicken tikka sandwich - A big pair of brown bread divided in 4 pieces stuffed in with chicken chunks,mayonnaise,onion & capsicums. Chicken were rather in scanty & mostly it had the other items. Sandwich was okayish.

2. Cold coffee shake - This was a let down. The shake was way too runny & watery which gave a very bad impression of the drink.

3. Chicken wrap - 2 big pieces of grilled roomali roti stuffed in with large amounts of mayonnaise,chicken,onion,capsicum & tomato. Sadly the content of vegetables was too much to enjoy the wrap. In every bite i only felt crunchy onions. Avoid eating this item.

4. Oreo cookie shake - The name doesn't resemble one bit of what you would get. The drink contains just chocolate syrup mixed with 80% water & 20% milk. Awful to say the lease.

5. French fries - Crunchy & salty just as you would like your ideal fries to be. The quantity was very good. Liked it every bit.

6. Chilli garlic potato pop - Little balls of garlic potato giving a light crunch. Taste wise this was also great to gulp.

Prices are a bit high with the quality they provide. Could be tried once if you are short of options.

Pretty decent food for the price. Chicken Salad, Blackcurrant Smoothie, Fresh Lime soda are the ones I have tried. I have no complaints. Will recommend it to people running on a budget.

Was in that area for work so dropped in at this place for a quickie. Located in metropolis mall this place grabs a good amount of footfall. Tried their corn and cheese sandwich, and broccoli and cheese sandwich. Both were good. Have tried their other outlets as well, equal standard has been maintained.

We were quite happy after seeing an outlet of "Sip and Sandwich" in this area.We were here after our exams at a nearby centre.This joint is quite good for having quick snacks.We had our favourites from this place-
1:Mixed sauce pasta
2:Veg cheese Burger
3:Double Cheese sandwhich

All of them were extremely good in taste.The service and food is still unchanged and hope that they keep it same.
