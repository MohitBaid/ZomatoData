Finally a place serving all the combination of fruits juices, smoothies, detox drinks. I tried Detorade (dates, milk and banana) and Soul serenity from their menu. Both were equally amazing. Best part is that they don't use flavours like other places. It's real fruit to every bit, no water or added sugar. Icing on the cake is their reasonable pricing. It's open till 5am which makes it perfect for midnight smoothies and shakes cravings. It's definitely with a try.

Discovered this place newly opened at a corner near the Pantaloons Building in Sector V.
What me and my friends found is a plethora of tasteful indulgence keeping your healthbuds intact.
The name Medley shines on the menu with combinations and mixes of juices, milkshakes, smoothies, lassi and fruit desserts. We asked the owner to suggest us their best and we were delighted with what we tasted.... the banana mint ride, the sunday fortune, oreo expresso and the parfait delight and to top it all the apple blast milkshake!
The next time you are in that area try this place hidden in a lane with its healty and tasty indulgence.
Note: they are open all night!
