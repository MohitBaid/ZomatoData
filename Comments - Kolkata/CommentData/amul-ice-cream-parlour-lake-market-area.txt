Went Amul Ice Cream Parlour twice till now. From the very first visit during Durga Puja,2017 was planning to give review about it but unfortunately this place was not included on Zomato. But now they finally approved my request to add the place on Zomato.So it's review time :)It's in lake mall,food court.
I had tried Candy Crush and Fruity Rolly(Mango Flavour).
Firstly as the taste of amul base ice cream is heaven so pick any thing from the menu,it won't disappoint u.
Candy Crush(Regular) contains two scoop of ice cream flooded with candies & syrup. It tastes really awesome & for strawberry lover like me,it's just wow👌
I tried friuty rolly(Mango flavour) & it was the first ice cream roll I have tried ever. Mango pulp was real.Trust me from seeing the making of roll,representations to eating the roll,feels like heaven😍
Lastly my friends tried another roll,Oreo Loves Brownie & they also appreciated it as much as I appreciated the fruity rolly.
Service was very first & the people were very helpful.
Love to go again and again😃
So if you are in South Kolkata & planning to eat ice cream,just go for this place💜
And the reason behind not rating 5 because sometimes ice cream rolls are unavailable specifically on morning time,nothing else.
