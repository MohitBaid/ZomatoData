We were so hungry that we ran into this outlet. We ordered cheese grilled sandwich and cappuccino. Cheese sandwich was really good. Quantity and price, both pleased us. Cappuccino was okayish. Fish finger was good and the Masala tea was brilliant. Chicken club sandwich was amazing and the mixed chowmein was conventional. It could have been better, though the ambiance was great.

Located very conveniently for the college goers, this place is great spot for students looking for a considerably cheap caf√© with a good service.

This seems to be a new outlet that has opened up close to Forum Mall on Elgin Road. The other while going to get some documents scanned, I saw this cafe and hence whilst returning, I decided to drop by.

The place was absolutely empty barring two members of the staff. The decor is in need of some serious remodeling as the ambience is just not lively at all! Perhaps increasing the lighting would brighten up the place to make it better! 

I had a look at the menu, which after coming back and checking on zomato I realised is different, and ordered for a Kitkat Shake and a Chicken Grilled Sandwich. 

The Kitkat shake was really amazing! I absolutely loved it and just couldn't get enough of it! A must try! 

The sandwich was next and it was pretty amazing too! The taste was pretty good. Nothing fancy buy simple honest cooking which sometimes is suffice to create magic!

The bill came to just Rs. 205! I was pretty surprised! They do not charge any additional taxes and hence that's just an added bonus. 

The place is a must visit if you happen to be nearby. Do drop in and give this place a try!

Happy Dining!!

Disappointed by the unplanned closure of eggytarrian...we stopped here to feed our hungry souls...
Unaware of the fact that this place is a hookah den..we took a seat..thankfully there were no other customers..
The waiter greeted us and i did struggle to match up with the menu posted in zomato and their original menu..as expected many items were unavailable as stated proudly by the waiter..
Finally we decided to settle for chicken tikka sandwich and grilled chicken mushroom salad..
The prices displayed on the menu were very tempting..
The waiter went inside the kitchen..seemed like he is the cook as well..he came out in a while and served the chicken tikka sandwich which looked good..
Munching the first piece i was a tad bit elated..
The smoked tikka.the onions..a tinge of mustard sauce with mayonese made the stuff good...i liked it..
Next came the grilled chicken mushroom salad...
As cold as ice...the sauce could have been cold but i would hav liked the pasta at room temperature atleast..it was not that bad till i discovered that there were no mushrooms..disappointing..
The bill came with tax added on individual items..i hav never seen such lunacy...
2.5 is solely to the chicken tikka sandwich..
