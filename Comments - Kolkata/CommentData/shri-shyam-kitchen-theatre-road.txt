Fresh, on the go food.
No compromise on the quality and the quantity is sufficient enough. Economical when it comes to the  pocket pinch the taste being worth the price.

Only high price, food taste is not at all good. Arrogant staff, cant even make a proper lassi for which they charge Rs40. Not recommended. Only high price doesnt ensure good taste and high quality.
