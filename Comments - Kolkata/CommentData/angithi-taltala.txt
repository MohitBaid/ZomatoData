Location-S.N banerjee road,Taltala.

Angithi is a restaurant under "Mayur residency".Its a pure vegetarian restaurant which serves north indian and chinese cuisines.The ambiance and service was good but in food we only liked the starters.

Service-The service at this place is fast and reliable but the staff needs to learn how to plate and serve the food properly.For an instance"they plated matar paneer in a dinner plate instead of a serving bowl."

Ambiance-The ambiance at this is clam and soothing.The interiors are extremely simple.

Food-As said we only liked the starters at this place and the presentation need a major improvement.We had-
1:Veg manchurian
2:Hara bhara kebab
3:Chowmein
4:Matar paneer
5:Yellow dal tadka

Food-3.5/5
Service-2.5/5
Ambiance-3.5/5

I have went there with my family for dinner the food was good not a very high but it was average. I tasted there's paneer mughali akbari which was tasted good to us and there paneer butter masala was also good. But I suggest you should go for the paneer mughali akbari which is awesome in taste. The staff's behaviour was okkk.

I stayed at Mayur Residency and hence ate quite a few times at Angithi. Its a pure veg restaurant.Â The buffet breakfast is average. They have the standard poori and partha and one gravy, tomato&cucumber sandwich, cornflakes, and one South indian item which is the only thing that is not set. The fruits are not cut and kept as a whole.
The north indian dishes are good. Paneer butter masala.Tawa roti, palak paneer, mixed veg kofta, tawa roti, french fries are some of the dishes i tried. They were pretty decent, but nothing special.

One of the most horrible experience i had at this restaurant. The food orderd was rubbish. The manchow soup had to be returned twice. The dal was so thin. Just like water. The roti was burnt. It was seriously one of my worst experience. Even the staff wernt courtious. Thumbs down. Improve or close

This place had been on one of my relative's wishlist and finally, here we were for a family dinner.
It's a pure vegetarian restaurant which could easily accommodate around a forty heads.
The ambiance here was a calm and soothing. A place one could opt to unwind.

Straight to the fooding, after contemplating we finalized on the following:

- Veg Au Gratin
It was baked at the perfect temperature with the vegetables in it being fresh and juicy topped with the right amount of cheese on it.
Recommended.

- Hara Bhara Kebab
The kebab was flavorful enough and was griddle-cooked served with sauteed veggies alongside.

- Dal Makhani
The black lentils were cooked properly and it's taste was exactly what my tastebuds recognize as "Dal Makhani".
(Taste preferences might vary from person to person)
Recommended.

- Paneer Butter Masala
The paneer cubes were fresh but, I don't know why the cubes were slightly shallow-fried before being tossed into the flavor-balanced gravy.

- Pindi Chana
The chickpeas were perfectly boiled and were tossed along with Indian kitchen spices and the dish had the yellowish color instead of the usual black. Nevertheless, tasted great.
Recommended.

- Masala Kulcha
Soft-baked bread with a generous amount of flavorful filling.
Great it was to eat.
Recommended.

- Butter Naan
Soft-baked bread with a slight brush of butter.

Although the staff was well-informed, the service out here was drastically slow, inputting bitter-bumps to the whole experience.

A good experience it was in regards to the quality of fooding.
-The Chinese fare awaits a visit.
But, overall was an above-average experience thanks to the service speed.
-Three and a half stars from me. :)
Deducted 0.5 due to slow service.
