Their menu is not updated.I ordered food (Home delivery) from this restaurant considering this menu.But i was charged 40-50% more than what was priced in this menu.Also in my case they charged for chapati with ghee but i received without ghee as I have ordered without ghee but they charged high.i think no one will check each and every box in front of delivery person.when I told them to update their menu they then criticised for the old menu to zomato completely without accepting their mistake.Not happy with overall experience.Also didn't like food quality.

Awesome vegetarian food. The yellow dal is just like that of marwari style with lots of desi ghee in it. The bhindi masala, peas pulav, masala kofta,alu fulgobhi,sev tamatar and kadi pakora r finger liking bit the rest r also good. And the good thing is its cheap and they deliver in stations also. People who r rice addicted must try masala pulao.

The best restaurant, taste-wise near howrah station. Ofcourse the there is no ambiance as it is just like any other station-side restaurant. But it is quite neat and seems hygienic. The service is also good. The food is very good. I loved the sev-tamatar sabji and the ghee roti is almost like home.  also, it gives great value for money. I would recommend it to anyone who wants decent north indian food in vicinity of station.
