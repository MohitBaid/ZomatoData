This is basically the place when you are in low budget...but you still need alocohol, then this is your place....kind of  a coffee house with alcohol being served...if you expecting lots then you dissapointed...cause it's good placs for boozing...not highfy things...interior is just normal...seat capacity is good.... hard drinks  price is too low....thatswhy i like this place.   Coming to the food....we ordered,

1.fried chicken: this dish is good ....capcicum,red vel paper with fried chicken .... chicken was cripsy...itz good... 

Rating: 3.5/5

2.dry chilichicken: it is normal chicken dish...normal chilichicken....tastes not highfy...itz lil bit average....

Rating: 3/5


Ambience is really good....staff behaviour is good...

I heard a lot about this place...maybe it has a good history but now i guess olypub is just overrated..i felt it is just like any other ordinary pub...staffs were friendly in beginning but they didn't like the tips amount and even abused while leaving our table...food was average...steak was chewy and hard

There's that one main attraction which most of us keep in our bucket lists : "Beef steak at Olypub". Ticked it off, but honestly nothing noteworthy or overtly amusing about this place. Overrated to some extent. Just your normal gate-away place(read : pub) on a weekday afternoon.

Visited on 7th Jan with friends, one of the signature places to eat & drink. As usual beef steak was praise worthy. Drinks were pocket friendly. 
But the service was really pathetic. Staffs were not cooperative. When I requested for the bill after payment only as a token of memory, they started making jokes with each other. Otherwise the experience was good.

Finally visited Park Street‚Äôs one of the most popular bars, Olypub. The experience wasn‚Äôt overwhelming at all...the menu was pretty limited...not too many options...we ordered two fresh lime sodas one hamburger steak and one chicken alkiev. We weren‚Äôt happy with the food nor with the service...in the end we ordered fish fingers which didn‚Äôt disappoint us very much tho. The entire bill came upto Rs 746 which is comparatively cheap compared to other Park Street restaurants or bars

Incredibly bad behaviour of the staff. Firstly, we were waiting for the third person to arrive when we were very rudely shifted to another seat by one of the waiters . Then after a lot of calling , the same person ( Waiter number 16)  proceeded to take our order and with a lot of arrogance and time(again) gave us what we wanted. What angered us further was that this waiter then proceeded to take the change and refuse to give it back when we demanded that we had already paid whatever service tax the bar had asked for. Will never be going here again , that's for certain.
The beef steak was the ONLY thing good about this place.

It's probably one of the oldest bars on Park Street and boy do you feel that when you enter!! The place gives a feel of the good old days. There's no such thing as ambience, but the furniture is sure to give you the feeling of a typical country bar. They have a decent collection of liquor and are extremely easy on the pocket. The food is pretty awesome as well. I would recommend one to have the chicken cutlet or the beef steak!! üòç

I went on a very busy day it was the 25th of December '17, their crowd control is very good the service is smart and so are the people working there. I believe everyone wants to talk about the food, which I found to be ok the beef steak was a bit cold and they refused to heat the steak again. But the quality of meat was good and the beer was chilled. Please take your identification papers with you or they won't serve you drinks.

One of the quintessential things to do when you're a localite of Kolkata - come down to this place and have a tub of beer as well as the infamous beef steak accompanied with chicken ala kiev . We were 4 in number , we ordered innumerable glasses of black dog , beer and chicken reshmi kabab . It was the new year's night and the place wasn't full deck but we had our own share of fun giggling our way to an all new year . Of course the drinks had kicked in and brought out our crazy yet best selves . The friendly ambience added to its aura as well as our waiter was great , keeping to our orders and wishes at the very moment . I had fun and look forward to more enjoyable times .

Even though our waiter was pretty courteous to us in the beginning, he refused to take out order of a beef steak towards the end saying that "there were people waiting outside" and thus he couldn't take anymore orders and we should leave. This, when our neighbouring tables had been occupied by people who had been there before we had arrived and who were still there. The people in the table to our sitting were literally just sitting there getting their pictures clicked. Our waiter at one point just came and put the bills on the table and refused to take our order anymore. Sad the service was this bad considering the food was pretty good.

I have no complains with the food here. The steak and Kiev are perfectly delicious. And they are quite affordable as well. However I do have a complaint with the service. The waiters are rude and incompetent. They fail to communicate with their customers. The service is very slow and inefficient. That is an absolute mood killer and I would request  the management to look into the matter.

Oly pub is one of the signature places of Park Street...This pub is famous for serving drinks and food at affordable prices...

I went there in the 31st evening with my buddies...we had to wait about 30 minutes for securing our places...

We ordered dry chilly chicken as a starter...It contained 8 pieces of small size chickens...When we ordered they told us this dish contained 10 pieces of chickens...The taste was not good..Actually its not up to the mark...

Now coming to the drinks...We asked for wine and orange juice...But they had neither wine nor orange juice...So we odered beer,vodka,whisky...

The ambience is average...The service and the food was not up to the mark...

I have heard about the legendary OlyPub in Park Street for many a year now and decided that the final day of 2017 was an appropriate day to give the place a visit. The restaurant is located between The Park and McDonald's in Park Street. We went at around 1 o'clock in the afternoon and hence did not have to wait for finding a seat. The place does have an average amount of seating arrangement which is not too large, nor too small. We were a group of three friends. Majority of the seats were for groups of 4 or more and I did not notice any for a couple of people or so. The first thing which left an impression in me was "Biff Steak" in their menu which I could not accept as OlyPub is a legendary dining place. The booze was quite cheap over here but I was disappointed on not getting Budweiser. So, we all settled for a Carlsberg Elephant each. We decided to try out the Beef Steak and Chicken Ala Kiev which is quite synonymous with this place. The Beef Steak is okayish and is not very spectacular. But I loved the Chicken Ala Kiev and may give another visit just to have this. It was too good and it is fair to say I haven't tasted a better one. I left OlyPub with the final impression of having to pay an extra Rs. 100 due to the negligence of the management which we later rectified, upon which the staff apologized. I hope this was just a one-off day at the legendary restaurant.

If you want cheap booze and good food to accompany it , this park street restaurant is one of the best places . Their beef steak is one of the best in town. The meat is soft and the quantity fulfilling. The place has an old world charm and reminds you of the Park street of the yester years. Also try their chicken ala Kiev . And don't get turned off by a long line outside the restaurant on weekends.

WE WERE 2 PAX. 
This place may be cheap. It may be lingering with old times and college days lingering memories to many. But that does not justify the horrible attitude of serving staff and the gate-keepers. All restaurants have waiting, but elsewhere staff treat you with dignity and nicely. They have a lot to learn, and improve a zillion times. 

We were let in, showed a table which was not cleared,  and as we waited for it to clear they made someone else sit there. We were then asked to go up, where we were again told to go down. This happened thrice. We ultimately came out after 40 minutes of being thrown from here to there and and went to Trinca's Ming Room, where we were welcomed and treated with warmth. Price difference was not much either. 

PATHETIC. Management is non existent, it seems.

Christmas in Park Street had to ge flagged off at Olypub.Well, I would call myself lucky to have found table for 4 inspite of a long lingering queue. We were seated at the downstairs seating arrangement. The place, as usual,was buzzing with people all engaged in happy feasting. Inspite of the heavy footfall, the staff were very polite and patiently attended to us whenever we asked for anything. Hubby took 2 beers for self along with mutton steak and chicken roast for both of us. The chicken roast kept up to our expectations. However, the very famous mutton steak put us down. The flavours that go with mutton wasn't intact much. The steak was more of a mashed vegetables to me.Didnt go for anything more as had already booked a table for dinner somewhere else. Overall, had s great start to yesterday's night with Olypub.

Horrible food... Horrible service. Chicken ala keiv was stinking, mixed grill platter was seen to be made out of leftover chicken and sausage pieces. We visited the place at around 5:30 in the evening and most of the alcohols were already exhausted, leaving us with the option of choosing from a very small range of spirits. While paying the bill, the waiter at service, came and aggressively started demanding tips. Never gonna visit again.

Went to Olypub last October and had to wait for nearly 45 minutes due to duty shifting of the staffs(that's what they said to our repeated requests). Had the beef steak and it was awesome with the mashed potato.A brilliant combination that kind of melts in the mouth leaving a beautiful taste after you had struggled a bit with the beef and fork. The ambiance is nice too. A fan of their beef steak and will go there repeatedly for that only. Doesn't pinch the pocket too much as well.

Went Kolkata for first time and OlyPub was one of the places we visited. The biggest reason for this was the only place which was full in weekdays and even having waiting where all other places were
Dry.

Its a cheap simple Bar. Don't expect too much like Pub. They have two sitting areas one on 1st floor is more decent then ground floor.¬†

you will get all kind of booze in genuine price. A lot of options to choose from menu for food also.
They need to improve their service a bit but that gets compensated with the price they are giving.

Even if this place might not be perfect, it deserves the heart of Kolkata. They have refurbished the upper floor. And who can beat the Chicken a-la Kiev with its oozing butter over the mash potatoes and peas underneath the chicken cone. And the beef steak as well, but remind you it is not in the menu but they always serve it as one of ther signature dishes.

You won't always get all the best of liquors in all categories but good enough to have a good long time of chat with your friends.

Must visit place on Park Street!

Probably one of the cheapest places in the city to have a drink. This place is a savior when you're running low on money. Just order your favorite drink with their ala Kiev and chicken ala olypub and you're good to go. Don't expect high class ambience cuz its very basic but yes its decent and the staff are well behaved. And the best part it will leave your tummy and heart satisfied without burning a hole in your pocket.

No words would be enough for this place...English breakfast at Flurys and The BEEF STEAK(ch√¢teau Briand) along with a couple of Beers at Oly..formerly Olympia....are an indispensable part of Park Street..one would prefer to sit on the first floor which has sofas and a better ambience than the ground floor which is more congested with tables and chairs. Visit on weekday afternoons and early evenings as Fridays as well as weekends will make you stand in a long que :D

My favourite place in the city to have Beef Steak. IT'S THE BEST. It's usually full during the weekends so you have to wait a little but I promise you it's worth the wait.

No words would be enough for this place...English breakfast at Flurys and The BEEF STEAK(ch√¢teau Briand) along with a couple of Beers at Oly..formerly Olympia....are an indispensable part of Park Street..one would prefer to sit on the first floor which has sofas and a better ambience than the ground floor which is more congested with tables and chairs. Visit on weekday afternoons and early evenings as Fridays as well as weekends will make you stand in a long que :D

Went here during pujas of 2014
Had high expectations.
Full 3 stars are for food, which was great. I had chicken a la kiev. 
But the ambience and the waiters really wasn't upto the mark. 
I haven't been there since then. Hopefully they have worked on the condition

A great place to hang out.. beef steak and beer is a must here... Mixed Grill is pretty good ,so are the others... Won't suggest the Indian dishes however... Service is crappy. The waiters keep you waiting... If you are looking for a place to hangout without burning a hole in your pocket this a place is surely a good option....

One of the signature places of Park Street, this pub is famous for serving drinks and food at affordable prices. It used to be an excellent place to hang out with friends and have a chit-chat over a few pegs.

I've been to this place a couple of times but honestly saying, it has lost its old charm and service. Their quality of food has degraded too! You hardly get good choices of drinks and almost always you'll have to end up ordering the brand you don't like.

Last time we went there, like always we had the famous Beef Steak! But the meat was so hard! Ordered beer, Fish Cutlet and Grilled Fish too. The fish items were tasty. Since we were still feeling hungry, we ordered Tandoori Chicken too.

The staffs need to be more courteous. They do not behave well or even answer properly. The ambiance has degraded too. But this place still holds lots of memories with friends.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

So here it goes.
Its a good place to hangout with friends for casual outings.
I have tried their Fried chicken, mutton , alakiev and etc many times.
The service that are provided to their customers are not upto the mark. It needs to improve.

I had heard so much about the place from my bong friends that while visiting Kolkata on way back from Jamshedpur I went with my friend. The Chicken Ala Keiv is the legendary dish that simply blew me away. If one doesnt have a decent appetite would advise them to share it with friends. The ambience of the the place is too lively.

The beef steak has lost its taste.. It used to be really large and juicy.. But it has now turned quite rubbery and sits in a quiet corner of your place along with the dry-ish mashed potatoes.. The chicken a la kiev too has lost its glory.... It was served nearly burnt on my plate and has shrunk in size.. And yes even after the high gst the waiters keep harassing you for a larger tip..

This place has ground and level one sitting interior is normal i mean nothing so impressive.
This place is perfect for drinks. The crowd here is also well behaved. Please don't try their food items. We ordered chicken ala olypub and paneer tikka. I really wish I could abuse the chef like the "NAGARPALIKA" guy. Yes the food was horrible. I knew I shouldn't have expected a lot from this place considering we were not looking for fine dining. This place really needs to work on their staff. They are absolutely lost and half of them were busy among themselves chatting rather than serving the customers. And the staffs are beggars. They won't leave you till you give them gratuity or baksheesh. Even the security guards ask for money. Gst is not added on drinks. Food items are charged with gst separately. Parking is available but at your own risk, someone stole my bike's mirrors last time I visited this place and both the police and parking ticket collector denied that the mirrors were stolen. So be a bit cautious and try to park your vehicles near any stores' cctv cams. It's just a great place to have drinks. "Daaru sasta milta hai bhai aur kya chahiye".

Sheer nostalgia! One of the oldest pubs of Kolkata, still filled with that same ineffable aura. Olypub is the ultimate place for 'happy dining'. Though crowded most of the times, their delivery is prompt. Prices are reasonable too. And the ambiance, as I've already said bears that quaint vintage charm.

Tried out their renowned Chicken Ala Kiev which consisted two chicken pieces accompanied with mashed potatoes and peas. Also I tried their Butter Nan and Chicken Butter Masala. It tasted quite okay but I found it too much oily. But the Chicken Ala Olypub was the best choice and I personally liked it way more than Ala Kiev.

According to me, Olypub is the best place for Continental dishes as they are great in taste and the price surge is low.

Okay. :)

I have been visiting Olypub since 2010 when I first got into college which was at Park Street and hence, my initiation into alcohol obviously had to begin at Oly, the haven for drinkers in Central Kolkata. To be honest, I liked Oly before the renovation. It's not because everything was cheaper or you could smoke inside Oly, that's not it. The reason I say this is because the food has become bloody terrible. I haven't had issues with alcohol. Yes, alcohol pricing is a bit on the higher side if you compare it with the average pricing of all Kolkata dive bars.¬†But, anybody who goes to Oly usually goes for the ambience and the charm which usually appeals to those who have grown up with it, such as me.

For instance, I know, on any given day, I could go to a better joint than Oly, but I stick to Oly because it's familiar. It has a lived-in quality. And also, because they make amazing beef steak. There's no option to dictate how you want the beef to be cooked; it will always come well-done. Actually, the beef steak, today, is the only good thing to eat at Oly. That's the only thing I'd suggest one to have at Oly.

The food is and has always been magnificent out here. The cheap drinks, the steaks , are better than every pub and restaurants out there . The service however, has declined. It seems the waiters have a whole lot of problem with customers they are seeing for the very first time. Other than that, it's worth every second you wish to spend here.

I was with a friend who visited kolkata for the first time and on the very first day we went to park street.
We checked in around 1 pm and there was no one around except some waiters. Even if there were no customers it took them 10 minutes to come to our table serve water.
Oh god someone noticed us ...we were happy....
Waiter: kya chahiye?
Me:pehle pani....
Waiter too another 10 minutes to come with water.
Me: one bira strong and one carlsberg stong
Waiter: khali tuborg strong,kingfisher strong and breezer hai
Me and my friend were thinking what to order he left the table and stood against the wall behind us. Just after 30 secs he vanished and we were waiting for another 10 mins to give order.
Me: ek tuborg strong and breezer
In the mean time we ordered mutton sheekh kebab,chicken sheekh kebab and prawn chilli.
Coming to food it was all horrible.
All the kebabs were full of cheap quality bread crumbs. They were hard ,dry and tasteless. Took one bite and told him to pack those sticks(they are not even qualified to be called kebabs)
Prawn chilli was greasy and too much oily.
Small prawn coated with lot of flour and corn flour and fried with bad oil .
Only good thing was the complementary "chanachur".
So at the end i did not regret coming oly pub although i was staying in kolkata since 5 years.

One of the oldest & pioneers of pub culture and beef steaks not only in Kolkata but in entire India. The main reason for which i love to visit this place is its old world charm, beef steak, chicken ala kiev and ofcourse for boozing in arguably the cheapest price in the city. If you are a steak lover then your life would be incomplete of you dont have steak over here, especially the beef steak which they serve with blanched peas, mushroom and mashed potato.

Gone there to try the much hyped beef steak but was utterly disappointed. 
I have heard from people that their beef sticks are worth a shot but wouldn't find anything like beef stick there in their menu and then i found out it was actually a 'Steak' not a 'Stick'. 
we tried Beef steak, chicken butter masala and naan. The much hyped one was disappointing as the beef was undercooked, dry and impossible to chew, it is served with mashed potato, sunny side up omlette and pees, but rather than giving raw pees they should have served mushy pees which would have complimented it better.
The chicken butter masala was still good.

This is basically the place when you are low on cash but you still neet to booze, you gotta come here. (Nevertheless, don't forget to carry some ID with you.)
Coming to the food, the main attraction here is the beef steak. I also came here for that. I can say, according to the price the beef is okay-ish, but it has room for improvement obviously. Also did I try butter roti with chicken butter masala, in which I found the masala and oil more. We were hungry so we ate whatever it was. But it was not upto the mark.
Its basically a place for friends to hangout, booze nd leisure all at once in low cost.

Historic place. Nice comfortable environment with homely waiters. We ordered Beef Steak, Chicken Sheek Kebab. The steak was so so but chicken sheek kebab wasn't good. The knife was very dull and wasn't sharp enough to cut through the steak properly. They serve the beer with the whole bottle and a glass so there is no way of giving less amount. Overall a nice experience but the infrastructure needs a bit of work.

Complete disappointment is what was received on our last visit to this place. Filled with its history and legacy which it has; it has very little to offer when it comes to presentation, ambience and quality food.

The place is very damp and is in an urgent need of renovation and abit of light.

We had ordered beef steak along with chicken sheikh kebab, here too we were met with disappointment.
The kebab was not crisp and had oil dripping of it, there was a need of 6tissues to soak the oil first before proceeding. Coming to the steak; it was undercooked and the fork and the knife were not able to cut through. I must say irrespective of the fact that it was undercooked, it did taste good on the surface.

The service is an issue here, when asked to re-cook the undercooked stuff, they simply chopped it and offered the same just by hearting it a bit.

Over all it not value for money, given the fact that the food and service is not worth it.

But then again comes its legacy.

P.S: Brighten up abit.

In oly pub today with I was with my friends. The waiters were drunk themselves and they asked us to provide our voter id card whereas some couples who were younger than us came and ordered and they were serving them happlly without bothering them..when we provided our university id they denied to take our order as they were unaware that after 18 rather in 23 years old you can pursue you M.A...they behaved very badly with us indeed... so i have an important question if you guys appoint this type of waiters who doesn't know how to behave with the customers then what is the point to open such a big bar in a area like parkstreet???

Crowded during the evening on weekdays as well as weekends.this one is one of the best food places I have visited. The beefsteak we had was tender, amazingly juicy and succulent. Chicken ala Kiev was fabulous as well. Both of them come with a side of mashed potatoes and boiled peas. 

Apart from the crowd ,there is not really any complain. And then again we are the crowd ,do maybe it is us who is guilty. :)

okay i know how this place has a long legacy to it's name and their celebrated beef steak.. but upon my first visit I did not like this place at all. Me and my friend went there on a rainy Sunday evening. 1st, the ac 1st floor was full. so we had to sit in the ground floor non ac area.. and the crowd there was really bad. Also, the interior was not impressive at all.. it didn't look any bit of a classy restaurant. It was poorly lit and the upholsteries were not much good too.  2nd, the food.. yes we had that beef steak..but again not upto the mark at all.. I didn't like it. Also, the waiters were quite non courteous and unhelpful. overall, I didn't recommend this place at all and I won't like to go for a second visit.

Service is shitty. The waiters and ride and biased and they take a century to take your order and sometimes they get the wrong dishes as well. 
Food- 7/10. Common dishes served, but one can go for the chicken alakiev! When the food and alcohol costs when combined, it's cheap. Alcohol is cheaper and food is slightly on the expensive side.

One of the oldest bar in town, known mainly for its cheap booze and beef steak. Although neither the food nor the booze is cheap anymore this place carries in sheer nostalgia as most of the people have had their first sip of beer over here. This place doesn't need a review for business. It's sheer old school

Location: A 2 minute walk from park street metro station. 

Went there with a friend on choturthi. Had beef steak (ch√¢teau briand ) and white wine. We wanted to have budweiser magnum or Heineken but they were not available so we chose wine. Beef steak was served with mashed potatoes peas and poached egg. Steak was a bit hard to cut into but it was really tender and tasty. They only charged taxes on the food but not on the wine. So that was a good thing. They gave us the menu after some delay but service was prompt. Overall a very good experience and would love to go there again.

Olypub , has made a name for itself.
The best place to sit with friends have some drinks and food.
The place can be easily located in Park Street.
Coming to the food we ordered :
The Chateau Briand( beef steak) is the most popular thing in Olypub and it is mouthwatering. 
And we ordered Chicken Aka Kiev which was also really good.
And hamburger steak(mutton) which didn't taste good. The mutton was over cooked .
Now the drinks :
They pour the drinks in front of you right from the bottle so no complains about the quantity and the price is also affordable.
Highly recommended.

One of my favorite place in the city to chill out with friends. Located in the middle of Park Street, this place is always bustling. The ambience is quite good. Interior is good too. It has two floors (ground floor and first floor). The first floor generally attracts the youth. Must try food is beef steak and Chicken A La Kiev. Beef steak is the signature dish. A pint of beer costs rupees 100 approx.

Best avoided.

I went to this iconic joint with a friend of mine after many years earlier this week hoping to get a good experience. 
We ordered fish finger (okayish), chilli chicken (yuck! We eve@n left the plate half eaten) & prawns (yuck). My friend also ordered a Chateaubriand for himself which was served in the form of Keema! On complaining it was replaced with a solid chunk but the taste wasn't good, so my friend said.

They also seem to doctor the liquor as we found another patron complaining about the liquor quality.

Don't know who runs the show here as all the waiters and managers seemed eager to pass the buck.

This place serve you every peg by pouring it from the bottle right in front of you so no question on the quantity but the ambience is shabby. The food is very disappointing. The chilli fish was too oily and tasted bad. The finger chips is what you have at home as they are soft and doesn't justify the term chips at all.
The bill is served in middle of your meal. The waiters choose to keep standing near the table until they are paid the tips or till you mention them to leave since you are not yet done with you food.

Parkstreet is famous for this one place, olypub. Their specialities are beef steak, chicken alakiev, mixed grill. One of my favourite place in kolkata. You'll get that retro vibes. Wooden sitting arrangements. The stuarts are all dressed up. The price has hiked up compared to before, but still if you are with your old pals this is the place to feel all the nostalgias.

Ordered a Carlsberg beer and the extremely popular Beef Steak! The beef steak was tender and tasted damn good. However the ambience was not what I was expecting. 
Yet worth a visit for the amazing beef steak.

Bill - 845 for two beef steaks and beer.

See. You must understand Oly is a feeling. It is not a pub. No matter how bad is the smell or the service. The beef steak makes up for everything. Make sure to try that. The booze is cheap. To get the true essence of the bar. Try sitting downstairs. Finally.. try going there with friends. It is more of an atmosphere which creates bonds. Me and my friends make it a point to visit Oly whenever in Calcutta.

Kind of a coffee house with alcohol being served.if you go in expecting lots... don't..but the charm of being seated on the same seats where the greatest people of Bengal once sat is something that this place builds on.you can even spot a lady in sari downing booze.lol..nothing much for vegetarians. Beef lovers might absolutely love the steak send with mashed potatoes and peas and mushrooms..they don't know that it goes well with bread..so they can't serve you bread even on requesting them to. Service was prompt and fast enough for a place this huge.the servers would stare at you for tips and so does the security guard. I find this unappealing. This one hence is for the charm that old kolkata had once.

Almost everyday Calcuttan is familiar with this quaint and age old pub located in the heart of Park Street. Oly Pub remains jam packed even on weekdays. You have to stand outside in a queue to get a seat at times. Thus better go there with time to spare. I visited this place a number of time and it didn't disappoint me once. The place is divided into two floors. The staff is polite although service can be bit slow at times. Both the quality and the quantity of the food is good and reasonably priced. Their most popular dish is the beef steak which is much recommended. The ambience is really great and it is definitely a good place to hangout with your mates.

There is a saying about this place , " Coffee house for alcoholics " . Rightly so. No Matter how many places I have been in , how many bars I have drank in. This place will always remain special. Through their ups and downs now seems like they are in a steady place. Beef steak amazing , chicken ala Kiev , mouth watering. The only thing that is disappointing is that they do not accept cards.

Within two hours of lunch (Beef steak and mutton steak for two) both of us had unbelievable
stomach upset (Food poisoning?).

Two of us, not really kolkatans,¬† went to Olypub, for the first time, for lunch.¬† We were the first customers that day (Friday).¬† For any drinks we would like to order from the dog-eared and dirty menu card the reponse was "not available".¬† Ultimately we ordered the two steaks Olypub is supposed to be famous for.
Taste was awful but stomach upset was beyond imagination.¬† 
After payment, one person came and stood with a plate for tips.¬† He went away only after we
paid reluctantly.
Their Kitchen and material quality should be checked by appropriate bodies.

The oldest pub in the city of joy... But I didn't find any reason why it is so popular. There is so much crowd.

The ambience is very poor.
The quality of food is average. Most of the beer üç∫ isn't available though the menu card shows a large variety. Hardly 3-4 beer available.
There is no smoking zone.
Most of all there is no music.

Price is reasonable.

After paying GST you have to pay tips to the waiter without any reason like the old days.

Experience isn't good. But it's ok, when you have small budget.

Before you go to Olypub, you must know what to expect. It has been famous for it's steak and other continental dishes. However, the specialty of Oly pub lies in it's being a local, rather shabby looking bar serving both alcohol and meat beyond chicken for a really reasonable price. The presentation of the food here will not match global standards, but it does not disturb the taste. The food is great. It's a win win for both the restaurant and the customers. I love this place. Although service can always be improved upon, and some more enthusiasm on part of the waiters could be added. So if you are heading there, put your hat aside, and just sit and enjoy your drink and the steak.

This is one of the oldest and famous pubs in Kolkata. It is famous because it is old, or due to its horrible quality of service.
I regret my decision for going to this place.Utterly disappointing service. We had to go to the servers for the orders. Also, we had to remind them about our order.
Beers were not chilled. Most of the beers were not available.
We ordered chicken liver, mixed grill, and chicken Ala Kiev. Did not like the liver preparation. Chicken liver was served with green peas.
The mixed grill was good. It contained pouched eggs, sausage, bacon and few other things.
I have tried various places but never came across a place except for this legendary place which serves continental dishes with boiled vegetables.
There was no music. Moreover, they do not have any smoking zone. 
I never recommend anyone to visit this place.

I had heard about Olypub for a long time and wanted to visit it for sometime. But when I did, I was very disappointed. The only thing good about this place was the low priced alcoholic beverages. 
The food was very,very substandard. 
At first, we ordered the cocktail sausages. Shrunken, overcooked they were. Not a pleasant one.
Then we ordered Roast Chicken. The chicken tasted weird and the french fries were soggy.
At last, we ordered Chicken Reshmi Kebabs. Although not great, it was better than the rest.
Overall, it was not a good experience. Will not visit it again probably. :)

Today I headed to this legendary bar along with a friend of mine for some drinks and snacks.The interior is old fashioned and shabby it gave the feels of an old bar which has not been updated and remains to be the same over the years.Coming to the order,we opted for blenders pride,the drinks were served directly from the bottle in front of us which very few bars do,so that's a plus point for the food we ordered the tandoori chicken which was crispy and tasty served along with onions and chillies.The service was prompt and our server was courteous,the pocket pinch was also relatively low.A great experience visiting the legendary bar of park stree.

FOOD: It is good and affordable, the most famous dish being Chicken Ala Kiev. Priced reasonably at Rs. 200 only, it has two pieces of chicken coating filled with butter, served with mashed, boiled potatoes and yummy peas. The restaurant menu is quite varied and you can try out their other non-veg items like steak too.

DRINKS: This is what Olypub is famous for-drinks at a reasonable price. Though the menu mentions 30ml of some drinks, they only have 60ml minimum. The bar menu is the best, ranging from beer and whisky to rum and red wine-you will get all the brands you want, without making a hole in your pocket. We had 60ml of Old Monk, and GST is applied only on drinks.

AMBIENCE: Located in the "party para" of Kolkata-Park Street, it is one of the most pocket-friendly places to have a booze with your friends! The place is always brimming with youngsters hanging out with their friends and the sitting arrangement is pretty comfy, but could be a little more private.

STAFF: Staff is mostly good at their job, except that there is one waiter who keeps asking for a tips and a guard at the exit who does the same.

All in all, would love to go there again.

One of the best pocket friendly resturants in town to have drinks and good food.
The price of the drinks are pretty cheap in comparison to other places in park street.
The beef steak, chicken ala kiev, chicken liver masala and finger chips are just superb.

Olypub does not need any introduction. It is one of the oldest and cheapest pub in Park Street.  This place is usually always full. It has both AC and Non AC seating.  The AC seating is more sofisticated and is less noisy. The staffs are well behaved but the service is a bit slow. The  ambience is just normal and such distinction in the ambience. 
They didn't had all the liquor mentioned in the menu and they had only 3 types of beer.  So there was very limited liquor to choose from,  this was one major drawback and was not expected from such a famous pub. 
In the food we ordered Chicken Ala Keiv. Trust me this is one of the best dish I have ever had. Inside it there is all butter surrounded by chicken. 
I have become a fan of this place, the drawback is they don't always have all the items in stock which is mentioned in the menu.

went to oly pub on 30.07.2017 sunday at about 1 pm with a friend of mine. what we found there is that this pub is not out of the go... it is aging.when you will be going outstairs you will smell some hillarious odour,no idea from which area...
anyways.. ¬†we ordered-
a pint of red wine,¬†
a bottle of rum.
and some snacks.
¬†the place was nice, though they restricted a huge place,and did not allow to go, the staff was not that much enthusiastic, rather a bit reluctant. the ambience out there reminded us of an old not so popular pub.
so you can opt for that place to have an experience for sure,but dont expect more than that!

This I guess the most popular bar in Kolkata. They have sitting arrangement on 2 floors i.e ground and first floor. This place never remains empty. Well lit, no dim lights, no music, no smoking room. Service is very prompt. One must try mixed grill, it makes awesome combination with beer. Low on pocket.

This is my 2nd visit to this place. Went there on my birthday. It was friday night, the pub was so crowded that we had to wait for 45 min. Nothing was wow about the ambience as this pub is very old. Behaviour of the staff was very friendly.

So coming to food we ordered fried chicken, butter nun, chicken butter masala. Most of the beer in the menu were unavailable. So we end up ordering Kingfisher premium, Breezer & Heineken.
Quality & quantity of all the dishes were good. The price of food & drinks is really affordable. I think this is the most cheapest pub i've ever visited. Would like to visit again. But i would suggest them to renovate the decor.
As we were so busy eating food & gossiping didn't click any picture.

If price is the only parameter, this place can be considered. Neither food nor choice of drinks is worth any mention. Beer was reasonably cold or should I say, warm enough to taste bitter. Food was also quite tasteless. In fact, the tandoori chicken was burnt. So guys, visit this pub during those last few days of the month when salaried guys wait for salary to replenish their bank account üòú.

We went in a group of 4. And we sat on the top floor, I don't know if there is any huge difference in prices. We ordered:
1.Beef steak - Rs 225
2. Chicken Ala Keiv - Rs 200 (must have)
3. Mixed Grilled - Rs 225
All prices are exclusive of taxes. Tax:18%
The alcohol is cheap. Kingfisher pint costs Rs 103 and Old Monk 30 ml was Rs 76, Blender's Pride is Rs. 96 for 30 ml. They only serve 60 ml in your first order though, then you can go for 30 ml.
The ambience was okayish on the top floor, last time I went, I was sitting on the ground section and it was too loud and clumsy. They lose rating all because of the service, there were 2 waiters serving the whole floor. The service was slow. But otherwise, Olypub is the best place to come when you're low on dosh and you want some cheap thrills. Hit the like button and follow if you liked my review :) I usually believe in mentioning the prices. Cheers.
P.s. Check out the pictures of the dishes.

Visited there in a raint day afternoon, walked up to their 1st floor seating arrangement,which is better then the ground floor one.
The alcohol here is no doubt cheap compared to other places.The ambience was good.
We ordered their renowned beef steak and chicken ala keiv,along with alcohol.
The beef steak was average but the chicken ala keiv was really good
The total bill was 950 for two people.
Decent pricing,i would say.
Overall a good place to visit with friends

The most preferred destination/pub of Kolkata. Most famous for beef steak, but some other must tries are chicken ala kiev and liver fry is also something to be tried out. Booze is damn cheap and the best part is taxes are low. The upper lever is air-conditioned. However on weekends and festivals you have to wait for hours and share table. Sometimes even on peak hours. Service is good, and the staff are pretty friendly. If you are visiting Park Street, this pub is a must! Ambiance is also ok. These days smoking is not allowed inside, not even in the alley beside the washroom on upper level. A complete VFM.

Being the torchbearer of the legendary Beef Steak of the city, Olypub certainly has got an identity of it's own. The food has always been so delicious and the typical oldie style of serving makes the ambience an ecstatic one. I highly recommend the Chateau Briand with a peg of whiskey to taste the heaven.

Well this visit was a very interesting one. We were at Rotary Sadan for the screening of our film JANUS at the 2nd Bengal International Film Festival 2017, and we were hell excited. The entire team was there and thus we decided to hang out at a nearby. I had stopped going to olypub in the year 2012 and it was because of an incident I don't wanna discuss. So overcoming the last experience I decided to get in with hope of a better experience and I was not disappointed.  

1. Alcohol and food - the food was better, way better than the last time I tasted Oly food. The Mixed grill is right on track and I believe the goers had experienced it. The Chicken Ala Keiv is the same. I guess what compelled me to go back to this place was this dish. I was missing it . The Beef steak was softer and tastier. 

2. Staff service- The issue I faced last time was surprisingly missing. The courteous and at your service staffs is the new thing I liked about this place. New faced made me happy and their raw behaviour too.

3. The ambience-  changed and renovated. Like it.. happy not to see the dust and smoke inside. it has turned livelier and happier. 

I was a regular in Oly and lost my faith in it with that incident. My visit this time had changed my mind. I congratulate and wish good luck to the management and hope this outlet remains one of the best attractions in Kolkata.

If you want old school vibes and good flat out rates on alcohol and food, this is the place for you. The ambience is crowdy downstairs and little bit chilled on the top floor which is air-conditioned. The charm drives this pub, which is saved by a good food menu along with the bar menu, which doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. Definitely a place to go if you are in Kolkata. A Park Street legend.

Definitely a warm welcome by an Old Classic of Calcutta (this place was legendary before the name Kolkata sufficed) . The place where I would have ended up in college days to grab a snack and enjoy cheap alcohol.

The Steak is out of the world and has a classic Indian touch to it, the meat is juicy and succulent to the last bite served with a side of mashed potatoes and boiled peas with a sunny side up on the surface. Roast Chicken was pretty average with a basic taste. Alcohol is definitely cheap with an avg pint priced at INR 110 inclusive of taxes.

The let down is the ambience and the service quality, the ground floor is definitely a " No Go " it smells bad and looks like an old cranky pub from the 90's. The first floor seating is better and cleaner. The service though is equally bad on any floor and is a let down, be it cleaning the table or returning the change the staff is laid back and takes own sweet time to attend .

All in all the place to be just for gobbling Steak and enjoying a quick beer .

Iconic place to spend your evening with buddies. Dig on their Chicken Ala Kiev, Beef Steak, Kebabs alongwith the drinks of your choice. The crowd comprises of people from varied backgrounds. A touch of nostalgia. It's like the iconic Coffee House of College Street...only substitute coffee here with Old Monks, Beers, Whiskeys & any poison of your liking. Only one point to be considered, carry some cash with you as the joint is known to accept cash payments only (though they had introduced plastic money recently)

Cheap beer. Good food. Indifferent staff. 
That's what Oly is.
I have been here quite a number of times. They don't have most of the stuff on their menu. You will get used to it if you are a regular. 
Coming to food, chicken a la kiev and beef steak are very propular and rightly so ! They are awesome. But what I find surprising is that chicken ala olypub isn't that popular an item. It is one of my favs here. Chicken, cheese and beer. Perfect recipe for a hangout! 
The staff has been the same. They don't care. You almost get a feeling that they themselves are there for a hangout! They sweep the leftovers off the table onto the floor.

Meeting five friends after 11 long years and couple of them even staying in from 11:40 in morning to 10:00 at night. Oh! What a day it was.

The drinks are reasonably priced and the crowd footfall seeing the ratings here is very good. As evening sets in the place is almost full. 

The service leaves a lot to be desired for though. 

We just took drinks, üêî sandwich, üêî chilli boneless and üêî Boti kebab. All of them were good.

Ala Kiev and beef steak r really good and most preferred. Chilly prawn and lamb dishes are also great as starters.
Mostly had starters over there and all are great with drinks. Though ambience is not great, but a pocket friendly place in park Street.

I've visited sooo many times from the 1st year of collage. It is like coffee house with liquor. Beer price was really cheap then. But every year, I've seen a new menu with new prices. Now beer price starts from 190!! Which is really not so cheap! Only 2 or 3 beer can be available among all the names mentioned in menu. Quality of foods are same as coffee house, expensive and "not-so-good". Beef steak is only good among them. Beef is very cheap in other places but here, it's 250!! Quantity is not enough for one person and consists of tasteless peas and mushrooms(don't know why). Only good thing is they will refill your "chakna bowl" every time you ask for. Ambience is perfect for ADDA!!

Are you in a hurry and need your order taken quick, your food brought fast or your bill brought as soon as you ask for it? Do you have someplace you need to get to on time after it? Oly is not for you then. Come here at your leisure..coz the staff works at their own pace. They're not competing for best service award of the year.They'll  bring you a plate of no frills food. The mains are their area of expertise. Ignore the bland sides like the mashed potatoes or veggies they give you with their steak. Come, sit, wait and eat a plate of wholesome delicious food. We had the muttton steak, beef steak and mixed grill platter along with a beer. It was an experience for the taste buds.

And thats the only good thing, everything else needs massive improvement- the food, the service! But I guess you gotta adjust somewhere, can't have really cheap booze and then crib about the service.

Olypub having its legacy over an era at park street as one of the oldest and luxury pubs in town, I personally feel its overhyped. As compared to the different pubs rising and counting, Olypub really needs to be upgraded  to stay in the contest. Outdated furnitures and whole bar is lit up with tubelights, not a great ambience and I bet you will get same food and drinks options in same range but with better ambience if you look out. 
But still a legacy as it is one of the established pubs in the posh street of park street area. Hope for a better experience next time

Always loved the "bachelor's pad" atmosphere at olypub. I genuinely love their preparation of beef steak and chicken ala Kiev.

Always loved the "bachelor's pad" atmosphere at olypub. I genuinely love their preparation of beef steak and chicken ala Kiev. 
All that being said, I believe they need to increase their variations in beer. Everytime I go, they always run out of something or the other in the beer section.

Mutton Seekh kebabs were tasty, while chicken tandoori was a total mess, wasn't even tasting good, 

The manager on the first floor dosent know ne manners, was shouting on top of his voice on the waiters.

Wah! What a pub...this was my first time in a pub though....my boyfriend took me there... thanks to him:*
1. Ambience and seating- large n spacious , could have been a bit more lit but I guess any pub's lighting is as such.
2. Service- 10/10 very courteous, reasonably quick
3. Food: we ordered chicken ala Kiev, beef steak n beer. Chicken ala Kiev was just superb. The steak was a bit hard though. 
Bill was 772. Cash n card both accepted (although it's mentioned in zomato "cash only"). Wonderful experience.

WE have a chicken dish which was obviously beautifully prepared. Then we asked for some chicken tandoori which proved much better than any other opulent outlets. Cheers guys, keep up the hard work and keep it affordable.

Visit this place for its Beef Steak (Which is not easily available in other restaurants) and its decently priced alcohol menu. Don't expect much from the ambiance, the service and the hygiene. This place has its own iconic brand name along with it's central location which are its USP. Nothing more than that, there are better and cheaper alcohol and food options available!

A well known pub from colonial parkstreet area, have been rulling with same repo since early 80's. The 1st experience of bar/pub can be started from this place.. they have both AC and non AC sections.. upstair is equiped with AC,and its better. For 10bottles of beer we paid approx 2300/-Rs. Servvice is good and fast. Enjoyed the place and ovio the beer in a perfect sittingüòçüòú

This is one of those landmark bars that offers reasonably priced alcohol and great food. Been coming every weekend for five years now. Chicken a la kiev used to be so much better. They are not very keen either to improve on their service. 
You need more such no-nonsense sit down bars. They are a scarce in this city.
Overall- a must go if you're around park street

Firstly, most of the drinks from the menu aren't available. Moreover, pubs are for social gathering, and if you burst out in laughter among your friends, you are being requested to leave the place. The manager, the waiters and the security didn't have a proper approach when it came to hospitality towards a lot of people including us and our fellow table mates.

Food (2/5): The beef steak (chateau briand) was fabulous. Apart from that everything was crap. Even the stuff on the same plate as the beef steak which was not the beef steak was such poop. The peas will make you want to vomit.

Service (0/5): I would give it a rating but it was non existent. Such lolz. Scraps from the table were just brushed off onto the floor. A table besides ours was not cleaned for 45 minutes. The 'fresh' beer glass smelt of beer, so I had to have the tuborg straight from the bottle. Also speaking of beer, THEY HAD ONLINE 2 OUT OF THE 18 BEERS THEY MENTIONED ON THE MENU. Similar case with the juices. Just thought you ought to know.

Ambience (1/5): Um. Ew.

Overall: Uh. Don't go.

Cheap booze .. Mouth watering food.. Cordial stuff and old Calcutta charm. After reading these in review after review with photos of mouth watering food both your heart and test buds feel tempted with desire to dive into that cozy , endearing heaven . You reach and push the door of this apparent ancient pub of calcutta, loadad with positive expectation as much as a double cheese pizza with extra cheese .. you enter and as soon as the dense fog of nostalgia lightens you see a place which looks like a smaller version of coffee house only with mirror on the wall and cushioned seats . You hear they have another level . You climb higher because you are culturally trained to always look UP for heavens .. but as you push the more fancy glass door and settle down, the bubble of nostalgia bursts and throws at you a waiter whose nosiness , unprofessionalism and ill manner can give tough competition to the coffee house staff, limited choice of alcohol brands and very oily food. Indeed in our age media has murdered reality . Oly pub taught us that in bitter way .

If I had to review like with rating of 4-5 then that would have been some 8 months ago. Last week I visited with a friend of mine. since we had some work and were hungry too,thought Olypub would be the right place with my previous experience. The staff were polite arranged a seat . ¬†Food ordered were Chicken A-LA Kiev( compulsorily),mutton staek and fish fingers. and 2 Bacardi ¬†Breezer. only thumbs up for fish finger. the steak was well rubbery and hard not be chwed. ¬†the ala kiev taste was bad too. ¬†before my this last visit i checked the reviews (mostly negative) too but still gave a go. and the latest reviewers were right. the management must look into this and sort it out. ¬†hope it helps. ¬†no issues in their food pricing though quiet affordable but you must get what your paying. right?

Nothing exceptionally good it has, yet people as well as me have visited here many a time. Weekends as well as the weekdays evening also see queue outside its entry. This shows its demand.

First of all, this place deserves a thumbs up for maintaining the pocket friendly prices even in today's scenario. Booze is cheaper than probably the whole lot from the shack.
When it comes to food, though I've been here many many times, but somehow I didn't order a variety. Either that special and sumptuous beaf steak or Chicken ala kiev. I once had mutton cutlet here too and it was good.
To sum up, if you need an affordable place with a hint of kolkata-nostalgia, great booze and tasty beaf, this is your spot!

The famous place to grab a plate of steak and beer! The place is always full. It has two floors, yet you have to wait for a seat. The first floor is air-conditioned and more sophisticated, while the ground floor doesn't have any ac and isn't so posh. 
I have had their steak and since I was having steak for the first time, I couldn't judge much. But my brother, who is a frequent visitor, said that their steak quality has degraded. Earlier they used to serve really good steak, and that's how they became famous. 
I hope they get back making steak as they did earlier, because its a favourite place for a lot of people!

Olypub is one of the best place in park street if someone is looking for a bar in cheap cost. Olypub is always crowded because of the above mentioned reason. Staff is not friendly and you may have to wait for some duration before they come to attend you and behavior is also lacks courteousness. Coming to the alcohol most of the drinks are not available only a selected one are available and so as the food. ¬† ¬†
 But still with so much of flaws I'll still go there and will recommend other to go as Olypub is one of the most iconic place in park street area. So definitely a place to hang out with your friend but don't have much expectations.

Food:- 2.5/5

The highlight of this place is obviously the legendary beef steak, the prices of which they keep increasing constantly along with decreasing the size. The one massive problem about Olypub, which absolutely irritates the hell out of me is that they give you butter knives to eat a steak. It takes forever to do that. How am I supposed to cut a steak with a butter knife? Other restaurants have sharper knives for the steaks. So my advice would be to carry a knife without doing creepy things with it :P
Olypub doesnt care about customer service. The waiters are mostly rude.¬†Huge difference in ambiance in ground and first floor. They dont let you sit in first floor if you go with groups of more than 5-6 people which again is a minus. The booze is good and cheap but as many mentioned here the happy hours concept of other bars already give them good competition.

Considering it is a pub and the fact that I fail to appreciate the taste of most of the hard drinks makes a weird combination. No comments on the drinks. However I will add a few lines regarding the food. I have tasted their steaks (mutton and beef) and chicken ala keiv. Mutton steak is good. I found the beef tough. Regarding the ala keiv, the taste of the outer crust somehow did not go well with the delicious tender chicken stuffed inside. The crust tasted like some average fish fry coating whereas the chicken inside was very palatable.

Cheap booze in Park Street....enough said ! However , this place is definitely overrated. The food quality and service ( one of the worst) definitely need to improve ! ¬†Also there is huge difference between the ambience of ground floor and upper floor. The concept of happy hours in several other pubs is giving this place some serious competition in terms of booze prices as well.

Went there 5-6 times from 2015 to 2017.
Last evening went there will my girlfriend and was told we could either share with another couple in the AC section or go to the non AC section. :/ anyway, we shared with another couple.
When asked for Budweiser they said they didn't have. Asked 3-4 other beers they said they didn't have any of them either. Although all were mentioned in the menu!! Very very bad ! They only had KF strong and tuborg. Then ordered KF for myself and vodka w/ lime corandar for my gf. It came with chanachur so that was nice. Told to bring 7up but they forgot for 30mins so had to remind them again.
Ordered cocktail sausages (pork) , which tasted very bad and undercooked. Had to leave out 3 after finishing 5 out of 8 sausages. Then ordered paneer tikka which was even worse and butter naan which was excellent compared to the other food. I'm rating 1.5 just because of the naan otherwise I'd have rated 0. Asked for the bill and they made mistake in returning change. Gave me 1000/- rs less. I had to go to the bar and talk to the manager to get the pending 1000/- rs back.
Even after that while leaving the security guard at the gate shook hands and wouldn't let go until I paid him tips. So I had to shell out another 20/- Rs. Overall a very bad experience in Oly pub this time. Won't go there ever and recommend others to not go as well.

Very chaotic and crowded. It is preferable to reserve your table before arriving, especially on the weekends. The food is delicious, but the service are low. Drinks are available, so overall visit at least once and form your opinion. It may suit your needs and the price is not very heavy on the pocket too.. Have fun.

This review is based on the experience I had 3-4 times that I have been there...
Well while growing up in Kolkata(during my 12th days and graduation holiday trips)‚Äã I always heard about olypub from my friends..So the first time after getting a digicam(2008)and taking some shots of the historical places of Esplanade and surrounding areas I went here to cool our throats...Very very basic one though now I heard there is an ac section as well....So don't expect anything special regarding the decor et al....We Asked for a kf or fosters@ and dat time dey were not having that..And a few other times too I have seen this that they won't have the branded ones and will try to sell the local ones(abviously as they have a better gross margin in them)so anyways the beer or other hard drinks would be served with an ample amount of jhuribhaja and peanut and would be repeated‚Äã if required...For the food part we asked for the beef steak and ala kiev....Both came after 20mins and was good both in taste and quantity...But the waiter literally aksed for a higher amount of tip when we made the bill payment... anyways‚Äã that was way back in 2008-2012....(all my experiences)now one has lot of options in the part of the city.....So if someone really wants to eat the steak or want to see how one of the oldest pub of kolkata luks like can go else can skip this one.....Or probably a one time visit....

The rating is first and foremost for the nostalgia associated with the place... Oly is a place where many a youngster probably had his/her first booze... And the place has not changed... You can keep going back and feel the old charm, the laid back attitude of the waiters, and of course drown yourself in very cheap booze and gorge on the delicacies... The A la Kiev, A la Olypub, the steaks are to die for... In this day and age of pubs and numerous speciality restaurants popping up everywhere, this place still holds its own... And the queues and waiting time on fridays and weekends would just re-affirm that fact...

This place is packed on weekends.....And it is known for its cheap liquor and it's long heritage . The place is a wasted experience for such a rich area it belongs to . Chicken reshmi kabab was the only thing which kept it in the league of a 3 pointer elsewise it was a shear disappointment.

It's a nice outlet to be with your friends for couple of drinks. This not my first time here, and unfortunately the food is not good every time i have been here. They need some serious improvement on food. Ambience is ok types, staff is courteous. The only reason you got 3 star rating from me is because of hospitality. I went with my office colleagues to have drinks and dinner but after ordering starters, we opt to go out for dinner somewhere else.  Veg chana masal qas still good compared to chicken dish.

This place was known for cheap drinks. With my recent visits in a few restaurants in park street, i found the prices higher than the others. The beer was not as cold as it should had it been. Now coming to the food, the food was tasty. Though my first encounter with beef was not smooth. I did enjoy the preparation.

If you're here, don't miss out on the beef steak. The pork sausage is worth giving a try as well. Extremely pocket-friendly and hence is teenagers' most preferred hang-out place. Smokers, though will have a hard time exiting the place each time to have a smoke as they consider smoking inside the pub an "offense". Also don't forget to deposit a security amount to keep your table each time you wish for a smoke.

Oly pub doesn't really need a review. Its a place where everyone in Kolkata has been. The #AlaKiev and #BeefSteak are legendary, there are still no cocktails available, but drinks are really,  really reasonable, so you can buy juices and aerated drinks and come up with your own cocktail! üòÄ 
The ambience is nothing like modern pubs, thus the word 'pub' in the name is a misnomer, it's more like a parar adda session, with great food and drinks, minus the board games!  üòä
One word of caution, if you are planning to go on weekends, go with larger groups as the waiters will not really entertain smaller groups, duos or couples on weekends for whom their standard reply is "Jayega nei!" , even if there is plenty of space inside. Or better avoid weekends altogether, as the waiters can't wait (intended irony! üòÇ) to shove you outside! They can't help it, as there are usually long cues outside

Olypub is the best place to hit in park street as a perpetually broke college student looking for cheap booze and sort of decent food.  
Olypub is always crowded because of the very reasonably priced alcohol. You can get it by the bottle. The place, although located in Park Street, is nothing like it's posh neighbors. Olypub is very crammed and poorly decorated. The staff is always hankering for tips and shamelessly ask for it. The service is prompt, though. 
The accompaniment that comes with the alcohol is good. It is good for large groups and rainy days (money wise).

A crowd favourite in the posh park street area. This place has one dish for which people flock to it regularly and repeatedly(apart from the obvious wide offerings of drinks). That dish is the beef steak. Let me warn food critics, this steak us not your conventional American beef streak. It has been modified to suit Indian palates. So you are in for a surprise I'd you have had it before. Saying that it is pretty good if you are looking for a change.. 
The ambience is nothing spectacular. Pretty much old school kolkata bars.

Was highly disappointed ¬†with the place and it's services . Over year's the quality of the place has fallen in a massive way. Last Saturday I visited this place and it was almost a disaster. First the security guard stopped us from going upstairs which is understandable since there was a queue right in front of us and people have been waiting for a long period of time, secondly ¬†he asked us to go and sit downstairs. So when we approached the door to sit downstairs, the same security guard shouted and told the other security guard who was holding the door's ¬†downstairs's ¬†in a really rude and harsh way to stop us from entering there. So then we waited for sometime in the rain to enter. Then finally we entered the restaurant and we got a pretty much disgusting place downstairs's, the entire place was smelling of toilet. Then comes the drinks and the food, the food was horrible and smelly.
Then finally we paid off the bill and before leaving we had to pay tip to our waiter( who was really understanding and reasonable) and also the security guard.
So the over all experience was horrible and people really need to learn etiquette's over there and also improve the quality of the place which was highly disappointing.

The famous heritage watering hole of Kolkata located in park street...you just need the famous beef steak with the accompanying mashed potato and half boiled peas,chicken ala Kiev, some drinks and good company and ur set for a gala time...there's a uniquely different vibe to this place starting from the gruff but respectful waiters, to the doorman always expecting tips for doing nothing, to the varied crowd(from just passed school students to middle aged uncles to college goers ), to the steps leading to the cozy seating area on the first floor...prices are very reasonable...olypub is olypub

This place used to be frequently visited by me and my friends for a quick booze or the very famous beef steak that they serve here. But a recent experience has left me shocked and I am never visiting this place again. I was accompanied by me and two of my female friends. A group of men who were sitting on the next table kept ogling us and passing comments. The staff noticed all this happening but didn't do anything about it. Worst experience ever.

Visited on the  last Saturday of Feb' 2017. First look inside is like a overcrowded place,  everyone is busy drinking and waiters are busy serving the gigantic crowd, though it was just 5:30 in the evening. We were a group of 5 but two of us reached earlier and went upstairs to book table cos there was a queue. We got the table and waited for others to join us. But the staffs were rude enough to ask us to leave as all of us were not present. Soon our friends joined us. We ordered 3 plates of Chicken ala kiev,  60 ml BP and 2 60ml Bacardi White. They were quick to serve. But the way the served was a major turn off. They are just in too much hurry. We asked them for a regular water and they provided us with a bottle of boiled water. Coming to food Ala kiev was good as expected. Didn't turn out to the best experience.

This place will always hold a special place in my heart. It's not that I started drinking from there and also not that I have been visiting it for years but still there's something about Olypub that draws me towards itself. There may be many modern pubs opening in and around Calcutta but this will always remain special to me. So basically this is the cheapest place in Park Street to booze. I wouldn't recommend this place for a standard lunch or dinner fare but there are some gems hidden in that food menu which you can give a try. Some of them are the famous Beef Steak, Chicken A La Kiev and the Chicken A La Olypub. The waiters there have a strange attitude and won't answer your calls at once and you will have to tip them otherwise you will be met with very dirty looks but I guess that's a part of the charm of the Enigma called Olypub. This place is mostly crowded and If you take my recommendation it's worthy of the wait. Always try for the A/C section. And yes they accept only cash. As for me, I will keep on returning to this place till the day it exists.

Olypub is an iconic pub of entire Kolkata, though located at Park Street of Central Kolkata. The USP lies in cheaper liquor price, ambience of adda and also the great foods. 

Must try: Beef steak, Chicken ala kiev as the starters.

One of the oldest pub in The city of Joy. 

I am  disappointed a lot. 
The service was horrible, very rude.
They serve you cold Sizzlers right taken away from the fridge. 

Though chicken ala Kiev was far better. 
Beers weren't that chilled. My friends complained. 

Beef steak was good. 
But mutton steak was too salty.

We were so pissed we didn't even click pictures as we do every time when we visit a restaurant.

Not expected from you olypub.

Nice place to chill out with friends as it serve alcohol on a low budget. Always crowded and is one of the legendary places to booze in Kolkata. Have been there many times. Tried their beef steak and fish reshmi kebab. Kebab was nice but less in quantity, the steak was a little hard and nothing extraordinary I felt, too much hype about it though. Pocket friendly place to grab a drink i feel.

The hamburger steak and the cutlets that I had ordered  were quite well done, with the meat patty being the right amount of spicy and crispy . The ambience reminds you of the college canteen with people having a chilled beer instead of soft drinks . The place is always crowded and there is a slight 10-15 mins of waiting time involved . Ladies beware this might not be the usual park street ambience that you are likely to experience here. The target audience being college guys with little cash and uncles in need of that pint of  value for money beer. They measure the shot of your poison at your table and will surely give you that college canteen vibes. In one word value for money or should I say bang for the buck.

negatives first : dull ambience, extremely slow service, lacking in hospitality, they don't accept cards yet.
positives : they serve the best Chicken Ala Keiv I have ever tasted. some other favourites are Chicken Ala Oly (or Holy, not sure about the spelling) and Chicken steak. amazing servings and taste and value for money. also it has a certain old school charm that appeals to me. 
Definitely worth a visit when in Kol

On my recent visit to Kolkata, decided to give this place a try. This place was full at afternoon with college students and soon came to know reason behind it. Though located in Park Street area adjacent to The Park, booze provided here is quite cheap as compared to nearby famous places.

The ground floor have a normal seating area while the first one have AC, though both have dull ambiance. Staff is not friendly and you may have to wait for some duration before they come to attend you. That too behaviour lacks courteousness.

We asked for Tuborg strong which they said as unavailable. We then opted for Kingfisher strong and my cousin chose mixed grill which took around 20 minutes to be served. It consisted of potato wedges, saut√©ed veggies, chicken liver fry, bacon strips, mutton sausages with caramelised onion and a fried egg. I thought nothing can go wrong in a grill but the veggies and egg were cold.

Our next option was Miller's and this time I chose for their signature dish, Chicken Ala Kiev. This dish seriously fascinated me. Looks like a regular chicken cutlet but as you cut through, the goodness of butter will spread all over the place. It's served on a bed of mashed potatoes and with a portion of saut√©ed green peas. This dish is worth trying.

We ended up with 100 Piper's on the rocks and the final amount came less than 1k which is not at all bad. So definitely a place to hang out with your friend but don't have much expectations.

Went here with my Friends of a Music Circuit Band for a Hangout Party and was eventually disappointed at first because the Air Conditioner was not working and we had to booze off by the not so soothing air by their Fans..!! Rating goes down here a bit and hence I continue further.. Well that was my first visit to this Restaurant officially as a Zomato User and I have heard about their Signature Dishes and Pocket-Friendly Drinks Menu. Owing to it's fame and ratings from others, I did not find any such amazing interior decorations rather it was a bit dull to be honest. Coming to the Food Joint, We First ordered a bottle of Haywards 5000 Strong along with some Chips to cope up. Next to what we ordered was their Signature Dish i.e. Mixed Grilled Platter along with Beef Steaks, Vegetable Cutlet, Chicken Cheese Omelette and also few more bottles of Haywards 5000 Strong and Thunderbolt Strong. Food was served quite a bit late though the Drink was served fast. Then came the Beef Steaks and the Vegetable Cutlet. I have not tasted those personally though my friends told that it was okay and good but not outstanding though to be honest. Next came in my Chicken Cheese Omelette along their famous Mixed Grilled Platter which contained a preparation with Chicken, Mutton and Pork. To be frank enough, The Omelette was the only item which tasted fantastic and worth money. As I tasted their Signature Dish, I was totally disappointed with their quality. The Chicken and the Mutton was not properly cooked and was over spicy and saucy which made it tasted awful. The Pork fortunately was fresh and okay to be tasted better but the whole dish was a sheer mess and blunder. I was literally out of words which made me give them this poor rating. Though they have another Signature Dish alias Chicken Ala Kiev which I will definitely try out once but honestly speaking, I was not at all satisfied with the food quality that they served with their fame. Coming to the Drinks item, well it was quite cheap and feasible to booze over for a Hangout as this made our group a bit relaxed and satisfied atleast. You can try out the Drinks at a comparatively reasonable price surely. Overall I would give an average rating to this Famous Outlet which may hurt the sentiments of many but atleast I prefer to review these places honestly so that people don't get disappointed and dissatisfied like me and my friends..!! Do try out this outlet everyone..!!

Oly Pub. It goes back to days when you have had your first drink. Those early teenage memories. Located in the uptown bustling Park Street area this place still holds its legendary status. Extremely pocket friendly and have fairly decent food options. However over the period, I believe the place has downgraded a little. The food isn't that good anymore and the servers seem a little less courteous. However, it keeps inviting a stream of people and remains crowded most of the day. Pretty mediocre when it comes to the ambiance and decor but surely the first choice if you are looking for a pocket-friendly bar in the area. Beef steak still remains my favorite from the menu with Pork sausages coming second. Not a big fan of the chicken a la kiev they serve.

It's difficult to find a place in park street which offers fairly priced alcohol, but this is THE place for it. I tried the beef steak and it was AMAZING! absolutely loved it! However, the waiters aren't as courteous as you'd want them to be. You have to wait for fairly long before they attend to you. 
But this place is surely worth a visit and do try the beef steak! :')

Situated in the best location of parkstreet near park hotels this place is very unique. The interiors are very mediocore but what stands out are the food and beverage available at this restaurant.People mainly drink heavy at this place as the rates are a little easy to the pocket. Proceeding towards the food; chicken ala kiev and beef steak is a must try here. Service is pretty quick and will not make you crave for the food long once ordered. All in all i had a decent experience.

The food is so so so shitty. I mean a plate of cheese sandwiches costs 140 rs.  And the dish does not even qualifies to be called a sandwich. I was just packet bread with a half cheese slice. The beef steak was so hard that it literally drained all the calories from my friend in an attempt to eat it.

One of the oldest dine-in's in Kolkata, this place is a pilgrimage to beer and beef lovers. Situated in the heart of Park Street, this pub is a must visit. Beef Steak, Mutton Steak, Chicken Al-a-Kiev are a must try along with the wide range of drinks available. Served by the old schools waiters, just like the good old British colonial days, this place is always house full. The weekends have a foot fall more than it could handle.

Each time I visit Kolkata for my annual vacation, I try to visit some of the iconic places. Being a Bengali but without any prior connection with Kolkata, I had heard only about the places. One of the place is Olypub, as few of Kolkatan friends visit Olypub every time they go to Kolkata.

We (I, my wife, and two couson sisters) went to Park Street on 25th December, and after sonetime decided to go to Olypub. As it was 25th December 7PM, every restaurant in Park Street had long queue outside.

Luckily we managed to go in. We ordered few drinks, two chicken kababs, one fish and chips. Food was pretty ordinary, and could not understand why this place was so so popular. Drinks were also not cheap, but decently priced.

The only positive thing was, drinks were poured generously (for 60 ml portion, you'll get 70-75 ml easily).

It's not the greatest place to go but you don't have that many options in Calcutta. If you are looking for a cheap evening, sit downstairs. If you're looking for atmosphere sit upstairs. Don't think they have all the necessary beer brands available but whatever.

I currently live in Bangalore, basically the Brew Capital of our country and I seriously cannot get used to Olypub. Never even did during my time in Calcutta. I preferred Raul's more.

These guys dilute raw alcohol with water in the bottle...When I challenged them they kept quite and ran away... as it is the behavior of the waiters is horrible..I used to visit this place out of pure nostalgia... but they are thieves.. Even added water to Old Monk Bottle!

The place is overhyped. 
The service is terrible and owing to the fact that you can chill for hours over a couple of drinks at a table, it gets very difficult to find a place.
Had heard a lot about their beef steak. It tasted pretty ordinary. 
The only plus about this place- pocket friendly. And even that most dont agree to. 
All in all, not a place i would visit again.

An age old place quietly fitted in the hustle-bustle of park street, olypub is a favourite place from old generation to the newer generation. How many times you visit this place, you won't help but to love this place more due to an ever present charm of this place.

A popular hub for those who want to enjoy a laid back evening having their drinks. Well my friend & I came here with the same intention. We sat in the ground floor to avoid space crunch in the upper section. We had the following:-

1. Thunderbolt super strong - Good strong beer enough to spin your head.

2. Beef steak - Without even thinking we went straight for this due to the sheer tag of this as their trademark item. The steak was served with caramelized spiced onion, poached egg, mashed potato & boiled peas. The steak though was chewy & uneven in terms of tenderness surely bowled me over due to its taste. The poached egg surely complimented the dish very well.  

The service was very prompt & didn't left any hard feelings. The cost per head was also on the lower side. Overall the experience was a satisfying one.

This restaurant located at Park Street. Olypub is a must visit in Kolkata with friends. This place is a very old and popular joint. It falls in a separate category of bars which caters to all. Serves good food and great drink. The atmosphere is average don't expect anything too fancy and there is no music either. it is a great place to catch quick drinks and enjoy the steak. Overall a good place to hangout with friends.

One of the most pocket friendly places in Calcutta to drink... Mostly good crowd.
The bonus is that the food is decent, which makes it stand out from other pocket friendly pubs.  The beef steak and the chicken a la kiev are winners!
They'll serve you a well done steak unless you ask them for a medium-rare or medium while ordering.. 
Their vegetabme curry is quite flavorful, too.

Never been to any pub before as i dont drink alcohol. But i had heard that the Chicken Ala Kiev served here is good. My friends order beers and whiskies for themselves while i helped myself by ordering a portion of Chicken Ala Kiev and a portion of Chicken Liver Fry. Chicken Ala Kiev was really delicious and i enjoyed eating it. Chicken liver fry had to be shared with 4 other friends thanx to it good taste so i ordered another one for myself. Ambience is okay, remains crowded but one doesnt feel the breach of privacy. People of all ages flocks to this pub. Its a good hangout place for all. Waiters are cooperative but a bit ignorant and casual in nature. Another turn off was the security guards asked for tips while going out in a manner which we didnt like. Overall the experience was okay for a non drinker person like me.

You can see the menu for the prices of alcohol .. They provide alcohol at reasonable rate .. I will get down to food ..

Chicken A La Kiev - Mutton Steak taste good .. I mean average preparation nothing great to mention .. Chilly Chicken is a big NO .. 

Service is slow but the place packs up in the evening so it is fine .. They measure your drink with a brass measure cup which gives the whole experience a great old is gold feeling ..

Overall this joint can get a number of visits out of you .. ‚úî

You feel like having entered a pub in the black and white era when you get in there. No modern or complex decore for them, the waiters moving around in old uniforms, carrying a brass measuring cup with them, wooden furniture - so very classic look. I liked it the moment I stepped in there.

Parking is general roadside fee parking.

It is a busy pub, and the waiters are continuous on their toes. So serving is a bit slow. The waiters are professional. 

We went there in the early evening, so not much crowd as yet.

We went there as my friend wanted me to try out chicken a la Kiev, so we ordered for the same. It arrived two huge deep fried balls, garnished with mashed potatoes and boiled peas. The balls are full of chicken and butter, and tasted good. We also took fried liver, and I liked it better. 

Price is reasonable.

The only thing. Together with the fork and knife, they should include a spoon in the cutlery. It was very difficult to catch the attention of the busy waiters for a simple spoon.

Well , what to say - a visit to kolkata & park street is incomplete without a visit to this place . So even this time, there was no miss. The way they serve their drinks, the CB steak still remains same . This unique Ness makes it a "must visit" place every time we are in the city. We also ordered for a chicken a la Kiev and mutton steak. The mutton steak appears more like a cutlet and to a few it might appear a bit oily. 
By the way, they are gradually adapting to the new modes of payment , but beware the swiping machine might not work , so be ready with back up ( read cash)

Thanks for this pocket friendly and one of the most popular pub on Park Street. 

Very nominally priced and good tasting food, no cocktails but all other standard drinks are available. Okayish ambiance and very bad service. 

We just had few standard drinks for which we had to wait for so long as there are only very few attenders. As suggested by many fellow Zomato foodies, ordered Beef Steak and Chicken Kiev. The meat was very good in both and I especially loved the Chicken Kiev. But the mashed potatoes that came along were terrible. 

The entire dinner and drink was very light on my pocket and had a decently satisfying experience.

Price was also reasonable though we never had any other dishes as just went to taste the beef steak . For the people who love to booze , I think it's a good environment . Overall it was a good experience.

All the park st. Joints are easy to locate, same with this one. And its new year time and no other place in kolkata is better then park street. While visiting park st. We stopped by this pub. But at first thought what is this? A long line of 20 odd people were waiting in a q as if its ration shop. Yes i know its new year time so the rush and oll of that stuff but the authority must take care of the thing they must arrange some special arrangements during this time. After standing for 45 mins (30mins outside 15 min inside) we finally placed our order. The ambience was good but after a drink or two some people used to talk louder thats not a thing you want if you went with your gf/bf but its a good place for friends get together over a beer or so.
Coming to the food its was not that great stuff during the rush they provide us with only cheap quality food. Mutton Hamburger stick was not good chicken ala olypub was a bit of tasty.
NOT RECOMMENDED DURING VACATION OR HOLIDAY OR ANY EVENT.

Food is great. We went with high expectations and they were fulfilled. The staff was a little clumsy but it was perhaps because it was 25th December. Beef steak was extremely well cooked and lived up to it's name. They could do with a few more ladies washroom cause they only have one. Otherwise, we'll maintained and decent pub. Loved it.

Visiting this place brings back lot of old memories.. and this time whilst in Kolkata, dropped by on 2 occasions to specially have the beef steak.
First night was seated on the ground floor and next time around, got seats on the 1st floor area.
The beef steak was awesome. However, amusingly it was the same set of beer that was available and unavailable on both days. We ended up ordering the same brand of beer as it was the only strong beer available. The stock should have been replenished. The service was mediocre which was expected and the ground floor area is very poorly maintained.
Taste: 4/5 (only coz of the beef steak)
Ambience: 3/5

Started as Olympia Bar and Restaurant in 1947 and reborn as Oly Pub in 1981, is famous for its Chateau Briand.

I first heard of it from my dad, but of course he didn't take me there for obvious reasons. Every person who lived and studied in Kolkata will have fond (and embarrassing) memories of this place!¬†It's the place where most Calcuttans (like me) lose their pubescence virginity and try beef for the first time.
This is a place where you'll find a group of people start jamming out of nowhere, this is a place where you get to watch people getting drunk while getting drunk yourself, it is a place with the old Calcutta tag which I so love!

In the first year of college when we started going there it used to be a really dark, morbid place with torn, shabby upholstery and faded walls but of course we didn't care much; We were busy devouring the "forbidden" food. Those are the days when no one needed to provide ID to buy alcohol. But as months went by we became more choosy and stopped going there.

But. Like an year back I started hearing news of a renovated Only Pub, and tbh I was a bit startled with their new d√©cor. Even a few years back it used to remain mostly deserted on weekday afternoons, but since the relaunch it's almost always full with youngsters and loyalists alike.

Though something that hasn't changed a bit is the unfriendly waiters, but I don't really mind that. And trust me the food will soothe the frayed nerves. :3

üî∏ Chateau Briand (Beef Steak) : Their beef steak is one of the best in town. A juicy steak, caramelized onions, boiled peas, mashed potatoes with a mushroom on top. I don't know why, but I like their beef steak way more than

It was a good place. But this time it was a quite bitter experience. When the bill came it was around 4.5k . But we were forced to give the entire amount in cash. Due to demonitisation everybody is facing cash trouble. The restaurant refused to take card payment. I was quite embarrassed this time. I will think 10 times before going to olypub next time.

A decent place for hanging out. The mutton steak was good ( wouldn't say it was great as I personally don't prefer mutton and neither was it that delicious). For some weird reason, we were denied beer since only one of us was above 21. Idk who made this rule in Kolkata outta nowhere, but it was both maddening and perplexing.

Ask anyone who has grown up in Calcutta, they would have a couple of extremely funny tales of this place. Must go at least once before dismissing it for good. The only problem at this place, other than the crowd, is the service.

This was long overdue in my bucket list.. There was a time when Olypub used to be the best place to spend your evenings. The booze was cheap, the food was good and how many places actually served¬†the kind of food which we get nowadays during those times.The food hasn't turned awful thankfully. The steak is still edible and their ala Kiev still manages to pull in customers. They've actually improved in this segment, considering how bad the food was a year or so ago. I wouldn't recommend the food here at all, simply because it isn't even close to as good as some other places.The service is among the worst in Kolkata. The furniture is fine, and the crockery is terrible. For the price, I suppose you're treated to a decent lunch.Be there if you're a Steak Lover for sure....Overall I won't mind visiting this place whenever I feel like having a Beer or two @ Park Street Area Only. Also like taking people who are tourists in Kolkata as this place is quite famous in other parts of India as well.Well I would like to give this place an above 4-Star rating based on the few highlights like its History, few good special recipes, price & Location (Located at a place like Park Street & still offers so many memories)...Cheers...!!!

Olypub falls under those legends which keeps upto the heritage of Kolkata. 
Located at the heart of Park Street.
Apparently, beef steak and beer is what the place is famous for. And here I am, with a mark of strict no to beef.. 
Yet, I found the chicken dishes really nice. Chicken ala Kiev, chicken ala olypub. Real liking to those. 
The place is no shiny gold. But the crowd together, is legendary.

Ask any person out there in the city and they would say that they have been at least once to this place. Revamped and with a new look, i happen to be a regular with once a month visit pending. I am surprised myself that i do not have a review for this.¬†

Well, there is a rush always, and seating depends on ur luck. I have been there at all, from being the first customer of the pub to being the last to leave. Always opted for the seats at the top as it has been a witness to many a love, fight and discussions over a beer or a glass of whiskey of scotch.

We grew up from sharing a beer to ordering two scotches for each of us. Sad that they stopped the smoking zone near the washroom.¬†

Had my first beef steak here and i love their liver preparations.

In keeping with Calcutta tradition, a friend and I went to Olypub, one fine ¬†day. To ¬†a first time ¬†patron it might seem to be an over-hyped restaurant with a almost no patronage from Calcuttans. However, those in the know, ¬†understand that the restaurant has had a bit ¬†of a fall from grace , with a decline in food quality ¬†consequently leading to a declining patronage from Calcuttans. As is generally the norm, we ordered a ¬†Chateaubriand ¬†and ¬†a mix grill platter . The beef, was overcooked and difficult to ¬†carve. The mix grill was a very unassuming dish ¬†with no attribute worth mentioning. The service was pretty quick . The ambiance/decor is ¬†nothing out of the ordinary and speaks to its ¬†name as a public house. It's ¬†a piece of nostalgia in Calcutta's history and definitely one should experience it. However, don't bank too much on such an experience.

This is a nice and pocket friendly restaurant at park street , please dont expect something which a restaurant doesnt promise to. If you wanna drink mainly and pair it with some food thats the best thing. There are two floors the ground floor is larger with a coffee house kinda environment which i thought was better,the 1st floor is smaller ,more of an ordinary restaurant like,sofas and all.
what to do -1)oder drinks mainly with your preffered dishes , this is the best in park street for that.
what not to do- 1) dont go there if you wanna have lunch or dinner ,probably you wont be satisfied.

I am a huge fan of Steak.

Trying Chateaubriand steak at Olypub was like dishonoring the whole concept of steak.

have this¬†Can you tell me which place served rubbery steak with frozen peas and super chilled potato mash.Thought there might have been a mishap and asked the waiter to replace it.This is what he replied " In Olypub we serve steak with cold mashed potato and frozen peas". When we said that , that shouldn't be case as we are regular steak eaters. He replied, "This is Olypub specialty".

I started having steaks in Bangalore where usually the waiters ask how do I want my steak to be. I did not expect that in Olypub as the price was reasonable. But the whole experience did put me in a state of shock.

I left the plate of steak and the mixed grill (the horror on a plate like you see in Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmare) unattended and dashed towards to Flury's.

Sadly the next day my boyfriend got ¬†food poisoning which lasted for quite a few days

So guys, try the "Steak" from Olypub at your own stake.

A cult bar cum restaurant. My personal favourite will definitely be the chicken ala-kiev. That's a real food delight. For drinklovets, it is a good place to go. The only thing which bothers me is a pungent smell which is there whenever I visit.

You shouldn't visit this place if you r only looking for good food. This place is really cheap but it's inexpensiveness comes at the cost of compromise in quality. We had ordered the Beaf Steak ( the dish olypub is famous for ), the chicken al la Kiev, Chicken Do pyaza,  masala kulcha and naan. Beef Steak was very average, so was the a la Kiev. The other chicken dish was really salty and didnt taste good at all. The naan and kulcha was just okay!! 
I wouldn't recommend if you r only looking for good food!

Been planning for a long time to visit this place. Very much disappointed. Slow service, ambiance is not that bad though but the one thing that I really liked about this place i.e. "Cheap Booze". We had chicken do pyaza, masala kulcha, chicken kebab and 2 bottle of Heineken. Food overall average. I haven't found anything special about the food. It's a very cheap place to booze. If you're on a tight budget, you can give it a try.

If you've been to college in Calcutta and haven't visited Oly during your college time, your college life has been incomplete, trust me on this one.

In the middle of park street, it's almost a dream that a restaurant can serve food and alcohol at the rates they do, its cheap and absolutely perfect for college students living life on a budget. Go out here with your friends and just have a blast and be even more surprised that you drank and ate so much but the bill came THAT low.¬†

Remember to go on the first floor, don't expect ambience, don't expect hospitality.

It was a good place some years back, but nowadays everyone know the name called "Olypub", so in the Park Street area it's very popular and i think for the cheap price. So the crowd became horrible.
Otherwise it's a good pub.

One of the very few places in Kolkata where 650 ml beer is served and at really low prices. If you're looking for ambience, this place might not satisfy you but there is something about the place that is comforting and hence the experience here of drinking with a mate could be wonderful. In an area where expensive restaurants and pubs are scurrying down the road, Olypub offers a significant alternative of a cut-price deal. I've never been too fond of their attendants or the hospitality as a whole, but barring that, there's nothing that can ruin the experience of a nice drunken evening with a friend or two. A place where people of every age group are present at all times.

Ordered: 1. Two bottles of Heineken, one miller, one bacardi breezzer, a large peg of blenders pride.
2. Two plates of beef steak, one plate fish reshmi kebab.

Price: There are very few bar in park street who can provide a 650ml beer in this rate. Overall reasonable

Issues: TIP is a big issue over here. I am not saying that taking tip is wrong but one doesn't like to face audacity for not giving tip. They behave like its mandatory and you have no right to seat over there for a long time if you don't give tip(they call it chacha).Though the service is really good but i would like to give away the tip's money to the street kids than giving to a waiter.
Cutting the beef steak with knife and fork was a hard and hectic job.

Overall: satisfied

Location - Just beside oxford bookstore 
Decor - 3.5/5 
Food - we ordered a chicken A la Kiev and it was just awesome , the first bite of the dish was just amazing ; a bite full of happiness , if you order one portion of the dish you get 2 pieces of chicken as shown in the picture served with boiled peas and potato but as you put in your knife and fork into it you will find an explosion of butter that comes out of it which actually enhances the whole taste of it .. just divine you should try it we ordered for dry chilli chicken as well but it was not that great . 
Drinks - the prices if the drinks were quite affordable and were not that pricey 
So altogether it's a 4/5
Service - 3.5/5 
Experience - 4/5 
So if you are looking for a place to go in with your bestie to grab a few drinks and good food then this is one of the place .. do go and order the dish it amazing .. üòäüòä 
Value for money - 4.5/5

This place is well known for its beef steak. I, personally, am not really a beef lover, hence i had chicken butter masala with nun which was not bad! However my guy is madly in love with beef & loves this place for the same which makes me assume that all the good things you hear about this place is well justified. We visited during the festive season because of which finding a place was difficult & we had to sit ourselves in the ground floor which was kind of shabby & crowded. I have heard from my beef fanatic boyfriend that the 1st floor is cosy & the ambiance is better (which is one of the most important factors for me when i choose my restaurant). So I would recommend this place only if beef+beer at a cheap rate is one of the joys of your life. Otherwise.. not really my kind of place.

This place has a nostalgic feel. There are probably a lot of people who had their very first drink right at this restaurant. The interior of the upper floor look quite good after a few recent renovations. The ground floor seemed to be the same last time  I visited. This place is cheat and extremely convenient. Do not expect the food quality to be of really high standards. Food is average as is the service. The security guard will stop and ask you for some tips while you exit the building. Nice place to hangout with friends!

No one comes here for the food, the ambience, the hygiene or cocktails. Alcohol and a stale odour are its USPs. People either continue going to Olypub or they stop. If you have never been there, go there once and then decide which path you want to take.

There was a time when Olypub used to be the best place to spend your evenings. The booze was cheap, the food was good and how many places actually served Chateaubriand? Sadly enough, those days are long gone.

The food hasn't turned awful thankfully. The steak is still edible and their ala Kiev still manages to pull in customers. They've actually improved in this segment, considering how bad the food was a year or so ago. I wouldn't recommend the food here at all, simply because it isn't even close to as good as some other places. But because Olypub boasts an amazing history and you're free to do most anything, does it actually have customers. 

The service is among the worst in Calcutta. They're slightly better than the Coffee House and that's saying plenty. The furniture is fine, and the crockery isn't terrible. For the price, I suppose you're treated to a decent lunch.

I wouldn't recommend Olypub to anyone, unless you're a beef fanatic. The problem with that is we expect people to ask us how we like our steaks. Olypub just skips that step and serves it to you. I've had one which was well done, one which was rare, and a couple other times when I could hear the cow moo. Steaks should be rare, but for pity's sake, ask your customers what they'd like. It's almost blasphemous.

Ambience/Interiors: 3/5
Service: 2/5
Food 3/5

Ahhh, I am frankly a little confused about what to write about THE Olypub. Rather where do I start while writing on it. Do I start on one of those lazy afternoons when we used to visit there for a quick shot of Gin (so that the smell is not there) or a few years back, to one of those evenings where it was probably the only place in Park street where I could have relatively cheap booze with good food. For me, Olypub is the epitome of Park St or is it the other way round ? No, not the overpriced, upmarket cake joints, not those posh restaurants where you have to get in queue just to get in- Oly is one of those places where you feel at home. Its memories revisited.

I won‚Äôt waste time on how to reach and when to reach, because once you reach Park St, Oly is one place which can not be missed. Bang on one of the poshest roads in town, it boasts of a place where one simpleton can have a few booze with one of their many signature dishes and yet not feel murdered because of the price. Let‚Äôs come down to point now.

Just once you get in, hit for the first floor and please be ready to get disappointed because, if it‚Äôs evening time, the place is full. First floor is the place where all the sofas are there. There are 2 sections and I always always prefer the inside one more, for the sheer coziness factor. Settle in and start asking for the waiter. Like any good old fashioned joint, waiters here carry an air of attitude and are not too keen to service. But, after 3-4 regular visits, the attitude will change and the actual service will start. However, order for your booze (you‚Äôre not expecting any fancy cocktails here-right ??? ) and without wasting another moment, order for their Beef Steak. Please forget about the technicalities. Do you really care about whether its a perfect chateau briand cut or why they never asked you whether you want a rare-done or medium done ? Just enjoy the full done heap of meat (with the sunny side on top) that‚Äôll be dumped in front of you with few boiled vegetables and upon asking, the mustard bottle. With barbequed onions and mashed potato (they won‚Äôt serve you more), the sliced heap of beef meat heap is un-parallel.

Off course, while cutting through the slices and gobbling it with beer, you‚Äôll ask for the chicken liver fry. It‚Äôs again one of their specialties. Chicken liver, sauteed with chopped green chilly and onions in a an oily-semi-juicy manner is definitely recommended. Shamelessly, I order a buttered toast with it, simply to polish off the gravy from my plate.

Well, now that you‚Äôre kind of settled, look around. You‚Äôll find lots of your own selves around. At the next table, the kid, who‚Äôs constantly trying to be a hero in front of his girlfriend by gulping the small peg of vodka at one shot and choking at it and the lady looking around proudly ‚Äì isn‚Äôt that you some 15 yeas back ? See that table with the formally dressed middle aged gentleman (with mandatory tie off course) sitting with his lady colleague and enjoying some quality time, stolen from their mundane office life, isn‚Äôt this what you‚Äôre going to be in next 5 years ? Ohhh, by this time, you‚Äôve off course ordered for their chicken a la kiev and it has arrived, so come back to present time and dissect the thing. Just when you put in your knife, the liquid butter starts coming out and you‚Äôll start wiping it with the remaining piece of toast. See, toast is needed. They serve 2 pieces of a la kiev (god knows how at that price) and don‚Äôt mind sharing it with your partner. Experiencing foodgasm ? Go for your first round of smoke and come back. Earlier, they allowed smoking inside only, but like all good things in life, that‚Äôs prohibited now. For ladies, you may smoke in the back-alley in front of the ladies restroom, yes, you do have certain things waived off in life.

Come back and wait for the showstoppers. Yes, there are 2 of them and I guess you‚Äôve placed the order before leaving. The grilled fish and the cocktail sausage platter. Thankfully, they still serve Kolkata vetki. The portion size is getting smaller day-by-day, but who the hell cares. Its grilled to perfection and topped with some strange home-made sweet-tangy goddamn sauce, just to make the whole package more interesting. They serve some boiled vegetables (which I never had) and few pieces of fat, moist, homely finger chips- just the type your mom or wife prepares at home. The cocktail sausage, on the other hand, is a lone warrior. They just come around 8 pieces, without any accompaniments. The bottle of mustard will come handy now, pour some on the plate, roll the sausage in it and with closed eyes, put the whole damn thing in your mouth. Wash it down again with some beer (I guess, like any gentleman, you‚Äôve lost count of how many you‚Äôve consumed and drained out in the ground floor men‚Äôs restroom).

Ok, you can sit for how long you want in here, enjoy, chill. They prefer a laid-back service style here. Watch the young rebel beside you, watch him tear apart the current government over those pegs of Old Monk rum, and smile a little. Recognize him ? Didn‚Äôt you know somebody like him in your college days ?

While coming down, don‚Äôt forget to pack some of the chicken/ mutton patties from the ground floor counter. They make some off the best stuff at around 25/- per piece in town. I would rather suggest, to pacify your wife, pack some- they tend to vanish fast.

I rated it moderate as I personally like visiting this place and lot of fond memories are attached. Although a legendary outlet, but it may not seem very appealing to first goers and honestly it might actually not be. Some of the food here is excellent like the beef steak (absolutely delightful), the chicken ala kiev (outstanding) and the dry chilli chicken which has a special gingery punch to it. Other than that rest of the food is average at best. The liquor is neither cheap nor expensive, one who has been to most bars in the city would know it is moderately priced. There is nothing much of an ambiance, dimly lit sitting arrangement at the top with old sofas. It is comfortable and enjoyable in likeable company. But certainly a great place to relieve nostalgic moments. They dont let you smoke inside by the way.¬†
In short, if you wanna try out the beef steak and the chicken ala kiev, this is the place to be. If you wanna share a moment of the Kolkata culture you can visit this place. You may very well bump into some famous guy or the other as I have many times

Then ultimate den for booze at reasonably cheap rates in and around Park Street area. It has been there for decades maintaining it's brand value. This is more like Kolkata's very own Leopold cafe with its own distinct fame and charm. Recently we dropped in at Olypub during Durga pujo for a reunion with old friends. It was perfect. Maybe the ambience doesn't match upto that of new age pubs and cafes, but then Olypub wont remain the same if anything changes. Specially the delicious beaf steak, Chicken a La Olypub, a La Keif, etc. We went there in a group of 9 and we had beers sufficient enough to use the toilet twice or thrice. üòÇ The total bill came around 10k which was quite reasonable.

Overall, Olypub is there to stay as long as the spirit of Kolkata is alive in the people over here. Its legacy can't be defined by any ratings or reviews. But still if someone overlooks it's vintage charm and legacy, the food & booze deserves a 4 out of 5 and a 3.5 for ambience, staff & hospitality.

A legendary watering hole at Park Street, this pub is a mix of both good and bad.
Let's start with the good first- Food is very good be it Beef Stake, Chicken Ala Kiev, or Chicken - Ala- Olypub and very reasonably priced.Thought do not expect absolute authenticity as mashed potato, boiled vegetables accompanying the main dish would be devoid of Herbs or spices.Portion sizes are rather very good.Coming to the alcohol, the rates are inclusive of taxes & reasonably priced.Pegs are measured in front of customers at the table and poured.This is a good practice.
 Now let's come to the bad portion -  Service is really slow often you have to wait for your turn to be served. They are rather miser with the complementary " Besan ka Gatha" but not a bit shy regarding asking for tip.The door keeper rather behaved like a be@gger for tip, even after R's 20/- was given and three times more was given to the waiter for midiocar service.
The experience at Olypub would have been excellent if not for lackluster service and nagging for tips.Still a 70% marking just for very good food , ease to take ladies at the pub and comfortable seating arrangements with the perfect lighting for pub.
Prices of food items have been increased from October.

I am not that much into alcohol,hence the ambience, the various options on the menu does matter to me. Walked into this legendary pub but found it to be quite average. Nothing special or that great about the ambience or the service nor do they have variety of drinks available on the menu. Maybe this place is so hyped because of the pricing. Seems the pricing never got updated hence the increased football.

I honestly don't know how to review this place! Cause it's the favourite place! The mighty oly pub! But I'm sorry to say it sucks!
It's super cheap! Yes.
The ambience is decent! Yes.
Then?
1. Have you ate the food? We ordered kulcha and look at the pictures! Inside those maida things all you could find is mirchis and peas! That's not how you make kulcha, Sir!
2.Check out the Reshmi kebabs! The layer is filled with ginger, laisan and salt! That is it! That's the only flavour(Raw btw) you'll get for 175 bucks.
3. Oh okay let's move to the cheap alcohol side. There were no beer apart from Haywards strong and something bold! And I am talking about 6.30 in the evening! Sure whiskey's you'll get but that too they only had blenders pride and a little bit of signature. If I really want this many constraints sir I would have stayed back in my home and order from my home only.
4. And this is a personal thing that has happened to me! I'm not sure about the other people! The server that you are seeing in the picture who served us food asked for tip, which is absolutely fine and I gave him a good tip. Even after that he was standing there for more.
The guy who searched for a table for us asked for tip, the guy who hold the door(main gate) called us from the back asking for tip! Is this normal? Cause I have never seen anything like this! Can somebody tell me whether this is a normal thing in here or it just happened to me as I'm not regular! I'm perplexed!

Legendary, excellent location. Quality do not vary even if its a full house. Place for the intellectual bongs , sibling to the great indian coffee house as far as heritage is concerned. Your life is incomplete if you have skipped the place in your lifetime.

If you want to have alcohol without spending a fortune this is the place for you. The best part is you get cheap alcohol and there is no need to hurry. Sit back,relax and enjoy whatever you plan to eat and drink. Food is not something that they expertise in,not that its bad,but you would have better alternatives if only food is taken into consideration. But if you wanna have a steak or roasted chicken with alcohol not many places comes close. Go in there for some cheap alcohol and good starters.

Olypub has received a makeover and I can't say it's something desirable. The old setup had an odd charm. Dingy, sparsely lit, frayed old couches seemed to add to it. Liquor was really affordable. Food quality was not very good, but wasn't really the focus of the patrons anyway. Post makeover the prices have been hiked. I am a mixed grill and beef steak loyalist. Will always be.

Yesterday was probably my fifth or sixth visit to the place. The food is great - on the cheap and I'd definitely recommend it. However, the range of drinks available is very truncated. The entire bar menu seems like a farce since many of the items are not available. Most importantly, and the reason for the revised low rating, the service is ridiculous to the point of laughable. The waiters are extremely sluggish. They don't seem to be listening because they tend to use up their brain power judging the customers. They like checking for ID cards only when it suits them. E.g. yesterday, the place was nearly empty when we went there, so they asked for the ID card. But a week ago, when the place was crowded they didn't bother. Moreover, they only want to see the ID cards if there is a girl in the group, and they are happy just to see her ID card and no one else's. The waiters also have a habit not listening to the women speak. These sexist judgemental people should not be working in a place like Olypub.

It used to be one of my favourite joints but its literally one of the worst places in the city now.the beef steak used to be perfect but over the lsst two years or so the quality has detoriated a lot.the food served is usually cold and almost not edible because it tastes so bad that you'll feel like puking. It's good because of the cheap booze only.food wise , it's one of the worst in the city.

If you are from Kolkata and you haven't sneaked out of school to chug the very first beer in your life at this place, you have missed out on things unpardonable.It's only when we leave the city that we realise that Olypub is always going to be a tiny yet beautiful speck of happiness in our tedious, humdrum yet wreckless existence. The best thing about the place is it's ability to reflect the true spirit of the city. And the variety of people it caters to on an everyday basis would be a whole different story. I have some of the best memories at this place...
The food, right..... Beef Steak, Chicken A la Kiev, Roasted chicken and cocktail sausages!!! Would have given a five if they still let me smoke in the tiny passage on the 1st floor next to the loo! Too bad they don't... Take the fag outside, they say!!

Olypub has acquired a traditional fame among Calcuttan foodies. It does not only allow a cheap but tasty European cuisine on the menu but also is excellent place to hang out with old friends because of the affordable pub menu. We had Mixed grill where sauted vegetables with Chicken, Mutton, Pork is available. Both pork sausage and bacon is present in the dish. Bacon however tasted bit spoiled. Chicken ala olypub was awesome. Best along these dishes will be Red wine. Have fun. During puja its open and better option for lunch as its relatively less crowdy.

Memories of about a decade and a half compelled three of our old-timers to visit the joint last Saturday evening and re-live the era gone by. Continuous drizzle outside promised a great "adda" session for all of us. It was very nice to see the cleaner & hygienic avtaar of good ol' OLY. We started with our favourite Chicken A-La-Kiev and beer. Food quality remains more or less same. Wash rooms for men at the ground-floor is a deterrent , management might consider having one in the 1st floor as well. Lot of memories took 03 of us back to our early days...

Meeting your college/high school buddies after a longtime? This is the place to hangout at, not because its the best in the city but its one of the places where you can laugh & talk all you want without the manager coming up to you and requesting to keep the noise to a minimum. The ambience is quite nice and the music adds to it. The booze is nice but the food could've been better.

Olypub, located near The Park radius is an age old pub place, with cheap beer and other alcoholic drinks. Food here is more or less average here. One thing that this place may want to work on is their  staff. Their dedication towards following the legal age to drink at times gets overboard and comes off as being rude.

One of the oldest bar in the city of joy. The place has been modified recently and have become for family friendly . Great wall decorators. Old English Beats .
One of the best joints for drinking. .
So yesterday visited it .  As usual visiting oly pub an not gulping beef steaks will be stupidity .
So the day menu was beef steaks. Great taste and amazingly cooked well  Chile mutton, usually we stick to chicken but this place gives you a different touch. 
The mutton was very taste. Spicy and crunchy.
Gulped all of them with a bottle of calsburg.    
As usual this be one of the pocket friendly bar cum restaurant the bill was only 1100. Great service and very awesome hospitality.

So one of my friends suggested this place for a group outing and so on sunday we decided to visit here. The place is situated near park street metro to the left side of the main road. They have both ac and non ac sitting arrangements in 1st floor and ground floor respectively. Their sitting arrangements are good..with long sofas and tables...Nothing to mention about the decor with dim lights and clean place.
So now lets talk about the food...
We ordered beer atfirst...the price is very much resonable. I took one pint of beer personally which costed 93with tax. Others went for sharing the 660ml bottles.

For food we ordered chicken aa laa kiev..the legendary beef stake,chicken roast,nan and chicken butter masala. The food was served a long after the beer waa served...but we were too happy and busy in chatting that it didn't bother us that much.
So I had the chicken aa la kiev..which is basically a thin chicken breast covered with a scoop of butter and deep fried. So it had a crispy outer layer,and a flavourful chicken layer inside...and when u cut it...the melting butter comes out....üòÑüòÑüòÑ And that is just pure bliss..üòáüòáü§óü§ó It was served with two decent pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes and peas..I just loved this dish..and it companied very well with my beer.üòçü§ó
The beef stake was also tasty and flavourful...the patty was thick enough...and served with one egg poach on top and peas.üòÉ
What I didnt like that much was thr chicken roast, the amount was not satisfying according to thr price. It also tasted a bit sweeter and dull. üòêüòë
The nun and chicken dish was good..tasty and served hot. With two big pieces of chicken in yummy gravy. I was surprised to see that they also offer indian foods like that. ü§î
So we were super happy with our lunch..and our bill came 2419 with tax for 9people...that includes this much of food and also 3shots of whiskey and one pineapples juice. Overall for me...a great experience with such resonable prices and you can sit there and enjoy your food witg drinks as long as u want. üòä
So I will highly recommend this place to visit. üëçüëç

It's a low lit pub above and brightly lit ground floor.
The roof tells that its a pub of good ole days.
We ordered the following with soft drinks and the final bill was 905.

Chicken ala Kiev: two pieces served with mashed potatoes and boiled peas. The moment you cut molten salted butter flows out from the core. The crust is made of minced chicken with a piece of bone stabbed into to serve as a handle. It tastes wonderful. Good starter.

Mixed grilled platter: here it's served with chicken, mutton, beef and pork with mushrooms and poached egg. It had sausages, liver fries, salami etc. Overall very good in taste.

Chateau Briand (beef): this was the best. The steak was lovely, tender, juicy and delicious. It was served with peas, mashed potatoes,veggies and a poached egg. The steak cut well and wasn't fibrous.

Chicken omelette: it's a regular big sized omelette topped with shreds of boiled chicken. Average in taste.

It's a lovely place to meet your meat cravings at a very economical price at a place like park Street. The dishes are fresh and great.

We prefer sitting in the first floor always. The service is very good . We had ordered a chicken ala kiev which was extremely tasty. It was basically stuffed chicken with butter oozing out of it. This dish is a must try. A lot of options on  beer is also available. Definitely a must visit :)

It is one of the oldest and budget friendly bar in Kolkata. I went there with my friends few days back. The taste of chicke A La kiev and beef steak are just awsome. I just loved it. But somehow they did not have that much stock of drinks which was very irritating. They should look into this.

This place is one of the old place in Kolkata and I was there recently. They doesn't have large collection of alcohols but price is less comparatively for pegs. I will say this is a nice place for hanging out with friends. Also we ordered two starters might be reshmi kabab and chicken sheek kabab which was good in taste. Bad thing is that they took more time to serve foods.

Well this place is famous for the cheap drinks, college crowd and the nostalgia of course. 

No one talks much about the food though, the Chicken A La Kiev is especially good so is the liver fry. 

This place is highly recommended if you are looking for nice evening out with friends at Park Street. Romantic dinners aren't possible here. 

But be prepared to wait for your food orders, the drinks though will be served in a jiffy - quicker service than a theka !!!

Been here a few times. The place is very popular among few office people who come here regularly after work, and seat here for drinks for long time.
Olypub is one of the oldest bar in Park Street. The Ambiance isn't good nor the seating arrangement. Beside this the place remain too crowded in afternoon time to find a seat. And the Staff will not help you to find a seat.
Coming to food, Olypub do lag behind in food quality too. I haven't found anything good here. And the prices are high. I have tasted the Chicken Ala Kiav which was average to taste. Other Chicken dishes are also average.
In the drinks we asked for Carlsburg or Heniken but they had only Touborg and none other beer. Bad here too.
Visit only because this is one of the popular place in town, not for food or drinks.

You must know that Oly pub is neither known for its cleanliness nor for its ambience. But to a Bengali, Oly pub will always be special - be it our first drink or our first beef steak, it was oly pub. The drinks are actually reasonably priced when compared to other bars. The only place that provides you with alcohol at a cheaper rate is an Off shop. They do refill your "chakhna" if you ask them to. The food is not of the greatest quality, however it is eatable. More often than not the dishes are cold. If you are a staunch foodie and have come out of your house just to eat, this is definitely not your stop. This place is for people who wants to drink and also grab a quick bite while they're at it. My recommendation - try the beef steak. It's Kolkata famous.

Oly Pub - One of the oldest pub of Park St.
=====
Intro + Location:

I don't think i need to introduce this pub. Oly pub is quite famous for it's beef steak and reasonably priced alcohol. Off late, there have been a lot of quirky cafes and pubs opening around which is making oly pub fade away in oblivion. It is divided into two sections. The upper section is a little dimly lit and way better than the ground floor one. On my last visit, the staffs were quite rude. This time when i went there, it was altogether better. Nevertheless, it was one of the Family friend's birthday so we went here for some drinks and steak.¬†

However, it is located in Park Street near Moulin Rouge or in the same line where Bar B Q and Kusum Rolls are situated.¬†
=====
What we ordered:

‚Ä¢ We ordered a couple of beers and whiskey. I am a whiskey person so i ordered one BP- Reserve collection. ‚úå‚úå

‚Ä¢ Roast Chicken Half - I had ordered this. It was served with fries, beans and boiled veges. It did not have poach egg unlike other servings. :| It tasted just alright. My friend's had ordered beef steak and mutton steak. The mutton steak had minced mutton.
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Reasonable Alcohol
‚Ä¢ Good steaks
‚Ä¢ Good for group hang outs specially if the hang out is to get crazy
‚Ä¢ Service has improved since last visit few months back
‚Ä¢ Pocket friendly affair @ place like Park Street

Cons:

‚Ä¢ The roast chicken was not at all hot as expected.¬†
‚Ä¢ Not recommended to go on dates. :P¬†
=====
Meal for two: 500-1800 approximately (some may drink more :P) (including alcohol)
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 3/5
Food Presentation 3.3/5
Food Taste 3.1/5
Food Quantity 3.2/5
Hospitality 3.3/5
Ambiance 3.3/5
VFM 3/5
=====
Conclusion:

I personally found this place to be average. The ambiance,service, food, hospitality, etc etc. can be definitely taken to a next level. ¬†:)¬†

Beef steak I didn't find that elegant like it was described to me by obsessed people .. Still you should visit the place for being the part of Calcutta Culture ..

Been there couple of weeks back on a Friday night with my childhood-pal-cum-best-friend-turned-brother! We were there maybe to feel a bit more nostalgic, to pay some sort of tribute to this piece of history at Park Street. But yes we were definitely there for some beef and beer while it was just about to rain outside! Being a Friday night the place was overcrowded, absolutely filled to the brim. We were asked to wait right outside till some good fella decides to get up and head home. After about 10 minutes our turn came and we were asked to step inside and take one small 2 seater table right near the main entrance. The location was not very convenient to carry on any sort of discussion or to have food. The table beside us was almost attached to ours and we felt as if two strangers were sitting right beside us to share some booze. In fact we started chatting with them after a while, but could not carry on for long when we saw them having butter toast with whiskey, it was weird to say the least!
                                          ...

One of the best adda joint a young lad would want to go to. A place that holds the heritage with glory. The service might be slow but make that up with the bill. The waiters might be grim faced, but make that up with the over-pour! That's my ideal weekday joint with school, college or even office friends!

There are various reasons as to why a person visits a bar. Some visits to spend some time off, some to gulp in drinks which makes them be out of control and some just to accompany his friends. I am just the last category of person and a strict non-drinker of alcoholic drinks.
My first visit to this place was almost 6 months ago when two of my friends wanted to try some drinks out and wanted me to accompany them. Despite not liking it, I agreed to their whims and visiting Olypub.
The interior of this place was quite darkish being dimly lit. It had a two storey area and we got seated on the top one. Almost instantly, a person came for order and my friend ordered for themselves two hard drinks. I asked for a mineral water (literally).
The drinks arrived almost instantly and my water arrived a little later than 20 minutes. The whole time I sat there looking here and there and feeling obnoxious about the whole outcome. However, my friends were satisfied. They ordered for other drinks too which too came too fast and then again I reminded him of water which then arrived 5 minutes. After the hour long drinking session, we departed from the place.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) People visit here for 'reasonably priced' alcohol. If you are in need to such things, pay them a visit.

Qs) Why have I rated them 2.5 stars?
Ans) People might argue that being a non drinker, I shouldn't have visited the place at the first place. However, I feel they should be liberal enough to serve each type of customers. I didn't like the way I was ogled at just because I didn't drink anything. Also, there were indirect pressure for tips at each points which is a big turn off. Taking all these factors, I felt it right to award them 2 and a half stars.

It is the place where many people tasted their beer for the first time. So it may be a nostalgic place for many people of kolkata. This was the place where I used to go back in 2013 or 14 for its cheap price of alcohol and chicken ala kiev (the most famous dish of olypub). If it was possible i would have rate 4.5 then. But the recent visits were not a good experience at all.
The first of its drawback is that they don't want to provide you an empty table (in case you are two) even if the crowd is small. They repeatedly tell us to share a four seater table with two other people. I mean you go to such a pub to relax and have drink. You cant share that with totally unknown people. Once we were made to wait for more than 20 mins for a two seater table when we could see many tables were empty and none of them were provided. We were so disgusted that we immediately left the place
Second the waiters have become very rude and will not listen to you even if you calk them ten times. They will come whenever they want and service has become too slow now a days.
Third even if you take glass and glass of alcohol you wont get complimentary snacks more than a single time. You have to repeatedly ask for it and then they will come up at the last moment.
Fourth the tables are not always cleaned and the washrooms are quite dirty and broken. A pub should always have a proper washroom.
Fifth is a very mandatory point that is starting from the waitor to gate keeper everyone asks for tips. Even if you don't see them at the time of entry you will definately see them asking for tips when getting out.
In spite of all these, the place still gather crowd because of the memories one had at their college life and the delicious dishes they serve. Even if you don't booze you can try this place just for the foods
Chicken a la kiev and chicken a la olypub are two of my favourite dishes. Mutton roast, mixed grill, beef steak, hamburger steak and cocktail sausages are few of must try dishes here. But don't try indian dishes. They never made it properly.

The buzz..the adda ambience...mixed with the aura of Park Street culture. The service is a bit slow, may be due to the usual rush...would recommend the management to improve on that. The food quality and value for money is fine. And you get a lot of options for the drinks unlike other places. In all this is a must-visit place in Park Street.

This place is legendary,via word of mouth. There is nothing to be said about the ambience here,its ok at best,filled with small tables to keep your food and booze. Booze here is reasonable. Had gone there on a new years Eve with some friends. I made the mistake of ordering the mutton steak,it was horrible to say the least. But then my friends ordered the famous two dishes of here: Beef steak and Chicken Alaki√©v. The beef steak came with peas,mashed potatoes and a poached egg. It looked and tasted lovely! Although it's quiet a stiff piece of meat and difficult to tear with a fork and eat. The chicken Alaki√©v was good too,with a crispy exterior and butter bathed juicy chicken. This place should be visited in semi large groups,for some adda and moderately priced booze.

Olypub this place is well known to all the college goers and young lads. Most of them had started to drink their first beer here.

Olypub has lost its charm though. Once it was the best now stands in the middle of nowhere still going strong though.

The waiters were never courtesious even if you know them for years

I go there for cheap beer and Beef steak.

Last time I went there I had a small Kingfisher beer,beef steak and club sandwiches.

Except the beef and beer. I didn't like anything.

I went there quite a few times. There are some points which people should know before going:

a) Except beef stake & chicken ala kiev, there food menu specially Indian kebab section is worst.
b) Over the time, quality of food has been degraded.
c) Waiters & manager's behavior is very bad.
d) Decor & washroom quality is poor.
e) They don't except CARD payment.

Overall this heritage park street restaurant is still living in their glorious past & they don't put any effort to upgrade themselves.

First things first. Olypub is not a place for anyone who is looking for ambience or fine service. It is just a watering hole at best. Dont be surprised if you keep calling the waiters and they just walk past you without even caring to respond. But somehow people do keep coming back to this place. Drinks and food are cheaper than most places though there has been an increase in prices of late. Food here is decent. My favorites here are chicken roast, fish finger, chicken a-la Kiev (u get far better a-la Kiev at Mocambo but at a far higher price), mixed grills etc. People also love the beef steak here. Another bad thing about this place is that both the waiters and gate-keepers literally ask for tips.

Most unexpected experience.. Coming to them one by one.
1. When we entered no one was present to offer a table for us. We were looking for a two seaters as we were two persons only. But most of the tables were dirty . As we didn't found any two seater we go for a table of 4 seaters. Most of the 4 seaters were occupied by 2persons as no such gatherings and crowds were there on that day. We asked one staff to clean that table and that person desperately refused us and told(ordered) to share a 4 seater with another couple though most of the tables were vacant. We requested him to give another table for us but he behaved very rudely and moved away . We were standing there and desperately looking for a clean table but no one noticed and helped us.
2. After that we ordered chicken reshmi butter masala and they served oily spicy chicken like chicken curry or you can say a dish with no chicken. Because 2 (with bone) pieces were there where bones only exist. We were about to return that dish and the taste was also not good.
So, overall I can say don't go to this place. Staffs were not good. You will feel insulted when the staff refuse to give you a table and order to share someone else's privacy by sharing their table. And the food quality is not good as per the price.
Just started to hate that place.

Located in park Street, a mere 2 min walk from the metro station, this is one of the oldest hangouts in the city.
The crowd is young n happening, went there on a Saturday evening n had to wait fr about 30 mins before we got a table.
Beef steak is very delicious n well made (forget about rare or medium rare).it comes wd a sunny side up n peas n mashed potatoes.....yum yum..
Chicken a la Kiev is one of their legendary dishes.
Beer is cheap considering other places.
Only downside is they accept only cash n the service could've bn a lil more better... overall a very nice experience...

Booze is cheap by Park Street standard. But I love this place for the food. 

Chicken A La Olypub, Baked fish, Fish Fingers and the old Calcutta style Chilli Chicken are some must try items here. And also the famous beef steak. While here do not forget trying their strong kasundi (Bengali mustard sauce) with the fries.

Ok lets face it.
Oly pub is only famous for two reasons which are the location (Park Street) and the cheap booze.

It is a good place to hang out in groups if you can tolerate the atmosphere around you. The crowd will comprise of mostly college kids and broke or self proclaimed intellectual drinkers.

If you have ever been to the famous Indian Coffee House then this is slightly a notch down place from that with cheap booze and more irritating people.

The food is disastrous especially their beef steak.
Simply putting it they just don't know how to cook a beef steak. And don't even ask me to get into the concept of rear done,half done or over done because they are not familiar with that.

But if you are looking to hang out with a group with cheap booze then you will like oly pub because despite all the things I have stated above,this place has a heart and you will feel it during your visit, as little as it may be.

Oly Pub is one of those age old pubs located in Park Street that has been doing business for over 50 years. Jam packed during any time of the day, Oly provides its customers with pocket friendly alcohol and some few classic dishes which resonate its British heritage. The pub undoubtedly keeps a very low range of alcohol, you would not get good cocktails or wine here, but if you are a college student with a couple of notes in your pocket and a hankering for some booze, Oly is the only deal. I have a personal liking for their beef steak and Chicken ala Oly. I wouldn't vouch for the cleanliness of the place or the magnitude of good service, the dirty glasses are sometimes very offputting. But multiple visits to this place has made it a den of nostalgia for several young and old Bengalis, for Oly has been the little den of new employment/ coming of age revelry for many.

Olypub, much over 60 years old continues to be the favourite place for people looking for beef and beer. A place that finds the young thirsty souls looking for cheap alcohol to the older ones who visit because it's their 'Oly'. So if the legendary beef steak is not your thing, try the chicken a la olypub(chicken lollypops served on a bed of mashed potatoes tossed in white sauce), the mixed grill or the hamburger stake. They are meat- y people and fish is not their thing. The upstairs looks like any regular restaurant unlike the downstairs which has a large canteen like look and feel. They still accept only cash and good service is still something they don't consider your birthright. If you are not someone who enjoys drinking and chattering and nibbling on well done meat, give the place a miss since there are many others waiting to get in.

To be honest.... as a college student.... this was the only pub I could afford in that entire part street area!
I really loved the place and had been a huge fan of the chicken a la Kiev!
The upper floor has a better sitting arrangement than the ground floor!
But the service is horribly slow!
A year ago they had  revamped the place and it looks much better now.
Olypub shall always remain close to my heart .... if not for the food then for the memories attached to it!

Located in Elgin Road, Park street this is awesome specially for meat/ beef lovers. As the area defines this place is always a fab place for food lovers so there is always a problem of getting tables. You have to wait a long specially when you are with your group(Even on week days). We were two and still had to wait and got a shared table. As we had earlier plan we ordered beef steak with beer. Tuborg(strong) was not available so I went with my second choice(Heywards 5000 Bold). The steak was awesome, really enjoyed it. Then we went for whiskey and grilled fish. Olypub's grilled fish is different compare to other outlets. I personally didn't like it. Management level needs to be improved. Overall it was good and I ll definitely give another visit for the steaks only.
N.B. They don't include VAT for liquor.

Trust me take them and enjoy the ambience. Ordered  Chicken Ala kiev,  Reshmi Kabab and Fish munchurian all of which were good. They should increase their stocks of premium Lager beers like Ultra,  Miller,  Heineken and all.

Olypub, the name itself brings a smile to my face. It reminds of me of cheap booze, amazing food, and of course, college. Olypub is not a fancy dining place, and neither is it some cheap drinking hole. It is an experience for first timers and the comfort zone of regulated. And of course, a nostalgia for many.

Young adults of the city flock this place as much as paunchy middle aged men, and even on weekdays be persuaded to wait some time before you bag a table here.

The Anglo Indian styled food is the signature of Park Street, and Olypub‚Äôs too. Their Beef Steak is pure magic, and is very justifiably popular. But their Mixed Grill is no less. The dark BBQ glaze in both is similar, and north are served with generous sides of mashed potatoes and boiled peas. They are classic examples of the fact that good food sells in this city more than fancy presentation.
                                                                ...

Legendary bar in park street area. They serve delicious starters, alcohol is reasonable. The ground floor is a NO GO for people who wants to relax n have a drink. Always ask for the second floor seating. Some waiters may piss you off as they ask for payments or mobile phone to be deposited in case you like to have a smoke outside the restaurant for some time. Ambience of the second floor is very good. The variety of alcohol availability is less. If you are lucky then you might get the one you ordered.

This is not a place for you, if you are looking for a decent ambiance and well trained waiters! Rather, if you're in a mood of hanging out with your close buddies; not really bother about the noise around; ready to sip your drinks from "milk" glass (yes, u heard it right. They serve liquor in milk glasses üòõ ) and you are on a tight budget then this place should be apt for you! The cheerful babble of conversation suffused the busy restaurant. From their limited offered dishes; Chicken A La Kiev & Dry Chilli Chicken are recommended to have alongside liquor. Beef steak is also their signature dish.

The place itself doesn't need any more introduction. Everybody knows it and who doesn't, then it is not their kind of a place. The environment of a cheap college canteen, cheap alcohol (which is not so cheap these days) and good food (the quality had deteriorated these days). I had been to this place for numerous times. Like, their mixed grill, chicken a ala kleiv but didn't liked their legendary beef steak. I have a special liking for their lime cordial, which I just love having with vodka. On the negative side, they don't accept card, which is sometime inconvenient, ¬†service is really slow, and they all except tip for the bad service. Visit if you are in group and want a cheap place in park street.

When it comes to a beer with friends. The first pub that comes to my mind is Olypub. The ground floor is a typical retro bar while the first floor has been renovated. People basically go there to spend some time alone or with friends over a drink. This place has got an all time flow of crowds. Menu is on the cheaper side and is quite affordable. The food served is really very good. Management is kind of okayish. You might not get the proper attention at the first place. I have visited this place innumerable times and everytime its like  the first time. So thinking of discussing matters with friends over a beer, go hit this place.

Beef steak and cheap alcohol ( compared to other restaurants in park street area) .. this is what defines the legendary olypub. Have visited this place on multiple occassions but not after they have renovated this place. Among the food i have tried their beef steak, chicken ala kiev and ham steak but i personally prefer their mixed grill. Good old fashioned decor, nice ambience and good food. Prices are a bit on the higher side lately but  you can try here atleast once if you havent.

Quite a good combination I would say. Mostly college students and office goers visit this place with friends.
Its not really a family friendly restaurant.
The boiled peas with caramelized onions served with the steak really tastes good.
Other than that the restaurant itself is an old and rickety place.
No smoking zone. Have to go outside to have a fag.
The service and the way this place is run is a bit laid back.

Then waiter asked us to pay an amount without showing any bill, after we insist to show us the bill he took nearly about 20min to present our bill and we found that our bill was less than the amount the waiter asked us to pay. Bad ambience. No card acceptance. Dishonest waiters.

My college pals used to swear by the place. When I went in there I knew the reason. There is no point looking for decor here. The place is buzzing all the time exactly like a college canteen. In fact, you are very likely to run into someone you know at any time of the day. The main attraction is of course the cheap booze, but the food is also very very good. Their chicken ala kiev is great, so are the fish fingers. Besides they serve a particular kasundi (mustard sauce) there which is extremely strong and very tasty. I have been told that they make the kasundi themselves. The beef steak is also supposed to be delicious, but I have not had an opportunity to try that yet. The place is extremely pocket friendly.

This legendary place..didn't fail to live up to its name. We had Chicken Ala Kiev and chilled bears...it was ecstatic. The food was fantastic and I think I would remember the taste of that scrumptious for the rest of my life...Good Food, Good bear...what could be wrong...Mazel Tov!!! :)

Situated in the hub of Park Street, this place has a cosy atmosphere. As mentioned by another fellow reviewer, one can laze around at this place as long as they want. The dishes are pocket friendly and won't burn a whole in your pocket. Olypub is a perfect hangout spot from 17-80! But the saddest part is that they don't serve alcohol if you are below 21!

Well it's olypub. A very old joint in park street where they affectionately name their rats . The place used to reek of old world charm. And the water used to be served in used alcohol bottles. But here we are sitting in the newly decorated section upstairs where the irritating white lights have been replaced with cozy yellow ones. The whole decor has been changed to very intimate and cozy setting
. Not that it's bad but then it's not olypub any more. I feel like an old hag terribly clinging on to my old heritage changing slowly but steadily to more structured patterns. The service was slow as usual. Aha.. they didn't change that. Had ordered a beef steak, well not as soft and tender as before but still delicious. Will be sitting in the lower section next time.

This is one of the oldest bar cum restaurants located in Park Street,Kolkata.
This place is famous for beaf steak and reasonably priced alcohol.
During my college days I have went there 2-3 times when I tried only beer with beef steak.

Food:

Few days back I went there with my friends to try out their beef steak but it was not available.
So we ordered 4 Chicken Ala Oly Pub, 1 Fried Prawn, 2 Tuborg beer, 1 breezer and a large peg of Old Monk.
Chicken Ala Oly pub was really awesome. It had two boiled chicken breast pieces served with toasted bread along with mashed potato and green peas. 
Fried prawn was really dissapointing. It had 8 pcs all together but the coating was very oily and not crispy at all. The amount of prawn inside it was really less. 

Service:

This is something which they should really work on. The behaviour was good but they responded very slowly. I have asked for a spoon when I started having my food but they came up with it almost when I was done.

Overall:

Its a good old place in the heart of Kolkata to try out beef steak with alcohol.

Been here quite a few times. They serve alcohol at a low service tax which is the USP of this place. .and u can go out for a puff while having ur time here. A good place to hangout with really nice food items too. As I dont drink I love the sides and the 'chanachur' :P¬†
Beside the main food items my take is a cold drink with ice.

Well one of the oldest pub in the city and situated in the hear if the park street restro chain ...this was one of the most pocket friendly restrobars. Though they have hole the prices after renovating but the service constraint remains. Went there yesterday with a couple of my friends and had to wait for 30 mins straight to even get a waiter to give us the menu card. But needless to say the food they server is absolutely yummilicious. We ordered some pork sausage, beaf steak, mutton steak, roast chicken and fish finger and the oly special  chicken al a Kiev, that was my fav until yesterday when I tasted their mutton steak. It was juicy and served with mashed potatoes and boiled vegetables..makes a complete meal. There bar was not even properly stocked.the only beer they had was thunderbolt.

The ambience of this place is not so upto the mark,it's a small pub and when you enter you may get the strong smell of alcohol,but you mustn't mind that if you're going to visit a pub,I mean people visit a pub for some booze only(or sometimes to accompany friends too).
Now,the service is okay,they try to serve as soon as possible and get away with you as soon as possible too(I mean we stayed for a long time and hence we were presented with the bill 3 times before finishing our food,I presume they thought we had enough and won't be ordering more,but that's not too polite)Now,let's talk about the food,we ordered for chicken reshmi kebab which was really tender and tasty and was served with a bit of salad,good for a start,it had 6-7 pieces of chicken,and then we ordered for mutton steak which had mutton stuffings with something like vegetable and flour(obviously you can't expect a total mutton piece in your steak at that price),it was served with vegetables and french fries. Then they served beef steak(which I didn't taste but I got the review from my friend),it was tender yet solid unlike the mutton steak which was too soft(so we had problem cutting it with fork),it had no stuffing and the steak was purely made of meat(which actually it should be) and was served with peas,mashed potatoes and an omlette on the top
And then came the main attraction of the review,Chicken ala kiev,those who haven't tried it please give it a try you won't repent,and those who've tried they know it's a heaven! The outer crust is made of chicken and looks like a flower bud,and inside of it is hollow and filled with molten butter which tastes so yummy and good that you'll forget every bad experience about this place and only think of trying this item next time again!This is also served with mashed potatoes and chickpeas was a good experience overall,though it's my 2nd visit, I know what to order the next time i visit

The best place in town to have great and pocket friendly drinks with friends.

I love the Chicken Ala Kiev that they serve with mashed potatoes and boiled peas.

Ambience is a disadvantage but who cares when you are with friends.Definitely not recommended for family and couples as they will not enjoy.Another major disadvantage is that they only accept cash.

Nonetheless an absolute winner in terms of location and price.

My dislike for Oly Pub makes me stick out like a sore thumb in any group of friends I happen to find myself with. Definitely pocket-friendly , but that's about it. Glasses are grimy and look as if they haven't been washed since the start of the millenium. The steak here is just about average , nothing to write home about. Overall , not a very attractive proposition .

The place to be during college days and month end times when money runs low but drinks have to continue. Even I used to visit a lot. The cheapest drink hole in park street area. They have renovated the places because a fire had demolished the interiors very badly. 
The upstair seating now is way better with clean floors and clean environment.
But the service and quality of food has gone down beyond imagination.

The place is always crowded and I know my review will not make any change in the system and management because they have already made their name but with such shitty service and attitude, I wonder how much they can stretch the name for profits.
Prices have been hiked in both the food and bar menu. I don't mind paying a big amount but I do expect something decent at least if I am paying so much.

The first starter as suggested by the waiter was fried chicken. 10 small pieces of fried chicken made in Bengali style with bones and few of them burnt was served with few French fries and around 3-4 days old boiled stone cold vegetables which I guess was soaked in water. 
After the first round of drinks were over we wanted repeat of the same drinks. Man they have some attitude problem. They just don't take your order. Here we are wanting to spend money and they are busy chatting and drinking red bull! So we wanted to go for a smoke downstairs and they didn't let all 4 of us go down! If we run away. We offered them deposit money,credit card,pan card and even our bags were kept but no. One had to stay put! Ffed up logic! 
Then came the dry chili chicken. God the road side eatery makes better chili chicken than them. It seems since onions are cheap they just loaded the dish with them. The chicken pieces are over coated with cornflour and no hint of chili whatsoever. Only soya sauce and ginger. 
We had tried 4 times to repeat our drinks. I was calling the waiters on top of my voice but I failed miserably. They just don't want to work it seems. The last item was a plate of French fries as we didn't want to experiment at all any more. 
They had given us a bowl of titbits. Since we were 4 and it was difficult to share it from one bowl as their was 2 tables joined together and all of us couldn't take from it. On asking the waiter to give us another bowl he says they have a shortage of bowls and cannot spare any extra.. while I could see a huge stack of them kept right in front of my eyes!!

The bill came to 2327 for such a horrible experience and the waiter actually was waiting for a tip!!! I did not give a single penny to him. And he kept on waiting for 2-3 mins.
God his audacity.
We left without giving him anything. 
Never will be visiting this place again.
I wish zomato had some way to give negative or at least 0.5.

Olypub is a cozy hangout place among the string of restuarants in Parkstreet! I donot drink so cannot say much about the hard drinks that they serve here! The chicken A La Keiv and grilled chicken are awsome here!! Specially the butter oozing out of Chicken Alakiev is a treat to watch for a foodie like me. üòÇ‚ù§ Cozy and friendly ambience makes Olypub always a favourite! Though the service is quite slow.

LOCATION:

On the prime Park Street stretch right beside Moulin Rouge. Alternately, next to Kusum rolls on Park Street.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Dating back to the British Raj in India, this ¬†popular bar and pub has the old school to feel to it. If you want to know true Kolkata culture from the years gone by step right in and have a look at their menu. It will take you back to the golden era of Kolkata where everything was ¬†influenced by the erstwhile British empire. Interiors during my last visit which was ages back were ordinary. But I hear they have renovated the place and modernized it slightly. Nonetheless, its not the interiors you will seek when you visit the place.

WINE & DINE:

We called for Steak in Black Pepper Sauce, Crispy Fish Fingers and Chicken Reshmi Kebab. This was accompanied by a plethora of alcohol as we were old friends meeting after ages.

The thing which strikes out first about your experience is the amount of alcohol they serve per helping. Surely a small whiskey does not mean a 30ml standard peg here. It was more like 45 ml per small peg which would be great for people looking for cheap drinks on the otherwise expensive Park Street stretch.

The Fish Fingers were ordinary. They were not crispy but they were tasty. They did not serve Mayonaise ¬†and we had to make do with ketch up and mustard.¬†

The Chicken Kebab was also average. It was too dry as a reuslt of being overcooked.¬†

The Steak was little too hard. I feel that steaks should not be taken above Medium. A well done steak hides the quality of the meat used which I fear was the case here. Nonetheless, the suace itself was tasty and it was served with a single side fried egg, some mushroom and peas and a potato mash.¬†

Service was ok. The stewards have been here forever now so they have that typical cranky nature about them. But service is quick and the moto is to keep it simple. No fancy table mats or cutlery. Just good drinks and pub food which should not be analyzed much but should be enjoyed over drinks and good company.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

While I have been quite lenient with my review of the place as well as my score, I would be critical about the fact that cutlery and glasses need to be cleaned better. We had to actually use tissues to do the same on the table because we could see they had not been cleaned properly.

VERDICT:

Don't go there for ambience, food quality, sophisticated crowd, great service or great beverages. Yet this place is full. Thats because of the old world charm this place houses which cannot be replaced with either of the above mentioned points. Go there to feel a part of the Old Kolkata charm. You wont be disappointed.

Popular for its beef stake, mix grill and cheap beer. Usually crowded by office gowers stopping here for there meetings. The ground floor is non ac and the 1st floor has dim lighting and has ac.
The beef stake is not that good as spoken about. The meat is stiff on the top layer and tender at the bottom. Although the taste is pretty good. Its served with mashed potatoes and boiled vegetables. Both of which lack seasoning and presentation.
A better option would be the mix grill which has chicken pieces, sausages, liver and bacon. Quantity wise its alright but not that filling. Bacon has a lot of fat and less meat. The liver served in the dish is soft but has a slight smell to it. Whereas the sausages are reall tasty.
Having your food with a sip of beer would surely make the food more tastier. Its worth going and trying out the place to have an experience.

Everyone from kolkata know this place.
Yes yes you get beef steak here and cheap alcohol. Its very difficult to get a place to sit. As its always crowded with all age group of people...the staff members really don't care about their behavior. Its more like a "mausi ji ka daru ka adda".
Being a steak lover...i don't like the beef steak here coz they serve rump steak and its pretty chewy. It's better to go for standard alcohol and not go for wine. They only keep house wine and if you order for a glass of wine, they serve 60ml( Not Worth It Seriously ).
Its pretty cheap and thats why attracts a lot of college crowd. I have seen people having fights and behaving rowdy in the restaurant after getting drunk. Yes it is a shaddy place.
The biggest drawback is...you have to pay cash. Finally...there is nothing called as ambience in this restaurant.

This place used to be a college time hangout. Easy on pocket, it was a must visit for good food and cheap liquor. Beef steak, mixed grill platter, chicken ala keiv and ham sandwiches happened to be the main attractions.

And when I visit this place after so many years, it is sad to see a place like this has gone down in quality to such a huge extent.

The beef stake has reduced in size and has become horribly chewy and salty. The mixed grill drips down oil and the ala keiv tastes more like bread than chicken.

They have shut down the smocking area at the back and one needs to submit their phones and go out for a smoke.

The old charm is somewhat lost.

Well, we all know what's Olypub famous for. Alcohol, chicken a la kiev, beef steak, mixed grill platter. But, we went on to try not these, but some main course items. Boy, we were disappointed!! Ordered paratha, chicken kebab, chicken dopiaza and vodka. The food was not at all good. So, I would say olypub is good for only alcohol and the snacks items only; hence the rating. Staff and ambience were okay.

Ambience is not so great, it's a joint where you can head over to with your college or school peeps. Beer prices are ok and the beef steak here is a must try.  There's a separate balcony/corridor where you can smoke but no such smoking room . The ground floor is non AC and the first floor is ac. Staff won't give you much attention as the place is always lively and full but there courteous nonetheless

Favorite watering hole since my college days. There have been questions about the food quality and the staff service though. The legendary beef steak has become difficultly masticated. But still there has been no dwindling of the croud. Has had some great memories of the place. An extra credit for that.

What started in 1947 as Olympia Bar and Restaurant has evolved as a refute to innumerable Calcuttans and tourists alike. The Oly Pub we know changed its avatar from Olympia in 1981, shrinking its name into a cooler and international version. Besides the cheap liquor and food, Oly Pub‚Äôs USP was the Beef Steak at an affordable price and lip-smacking taste. Times have changed, Olympia has changed to Oly Pub, which has been renovated again post the fire last year. I haven‚Äôt been then pre-fire, hence I can‚Äôt vouch for what it used to be, but I can give you a sneak peek of what it is in circa 2015.

Another famous place at Park Street. Reasonably priced alcohol and food. It has become a lot more receptive to the younger generation, especially girls after their renovation. Though the charm of old wooden tables and chairs is lost, still it will always be my go to place. Try the Chicken Ala kiev and the Mixed Grill Platter which are the speciality of this place. Tandoori chicken too is pretty good. Overall, a nice place to chill.

Paid a visit quite a number of times so it's a bit difficult to sum up everything in a single review! Ambiance, as we all know remains lively most of the times at the evening but it's not advisable for people who don't like cacophonous environment that much and wants to spend a quite and peaceful evening sipping a glass a beer or a peg of whisky. Staffs are little ignorant and don't pay well attention to each and every guests all the time. Food served are tasty and the portions are good and ample too.

What we ordered - some drinks, Chicken A-la Kiev, Chicken Roast, Fried Chicken, Fried Fish, Masala Kulcha, Chicken Masala

A cool place to chill out with buddies, Olypub in high-end Park Street is known for their legendary beaf steaks. Had their Chicken a la Kiev that was gorgeously delicious, and which I washed down with Old Monk rum. For reasonably priced alcohol and pocket-friendly food, this place has already collected a thumbs-up from the city's youth.

Do i need to say more about Oly Pub ! Nay......... I just love this place.
As usual had to wait for around 20 mins to get our seat (me and my husband). But since we were in the mood for beer it was little disappointing to find that they only had 2 variants.
We ordered for Chicken a la Kiev,Chicken a la Olyppub and Mutton Steak.
Both the chicken items were perfect but the Mutton Steak was not that great, with minced mutton which lacked taste and was further worsened by a too much salt.
Quantity wise for all the items i am highly impressed as had i been alone i could have only finished 1 dish. All the items we had to share and could hardly order for dinner.
1 regret they have not so good dinner options,and the service is slow.¬†

I've been here numerous times and can safely say each experience is worse than my last...known for its beef steak and poor service. Nowadays with better steak joints scattered around the city...that can actually cook medium rare and medium(my preference) steaks, all that oly pub has to offer is its poor service. Definitely won't be coming back any time soon.

OlyPub, goes simultaneous when we talk about Park Street. One of the oldest and cheapest place to booze of Kolkata as well as Park Street area. Its really a cool place to hang out with friends. The ground floor is normal (fan+table chair) and first floor is AC (with comfortable sofa seats) where now days you really have to wait in queue to get your seat. Recently after a major unwanted incident, it has been renovated and I must say, it has changed a lot from what it was before. The walls for the first floor now have a good paint with awesome photo frames and nice lamp shades on it. The cellar had a good light effect with good display of liquor. The overall floor is neat and clean unlike before. The liquor service is fast but food service is late as usual. OlyPub is famous for cheap liquor as well as some authentic dishes. But the quality of food has degraded and not like before anymore. We ordered for Chicken A La OlyPub and the white cheese sauce over the chicken was not at all good or tasty, it seemed a bit bitter, i don't know why. Later we ordered for Chicken A La Kiev and Roast Chicken which in turn was okayish. Liquor price is cheap as compared OlyPub being in Park Street area and the liquor also being served fast after being ordered. Food price is also moderate. Behavior of staff remains the same, sometimes no reaction, sometimes being lazy and sometimes being rude. Overall same old place with same old environment but with new renovated and modified ambiance.

Situated amongst the string of restaurants in the popular Park Street area, this place is one of the most 'happening'(if I can call it that) hangouts for the youth and beyond for decades now. My first memory of going to this place was in my right after my admission in college. Had my first beer here. Aah! Memories. :') Anyway, so it is a storeyed building. We usually hang out in the 1st floor. Post the recent renovation, this place looks way better than the oly pub we knew in our early college days. The beef steak is a must try here. The waiters are age old, specifically the one with a hearing aid. He moves around like a boss, scolds customers ( mostly college kids) and forgets half of what is asked for. üòÇ The washroom for ladies still remains in the other end of the passage/ balcony. The balcony used to be the Smoking zone previously, now people have to go out of the building altogether which is a little inconvenient. The seats are comfortable and mostly couches replacing the chairs. The alcohol rates are reasonable which is why the demand. There are evenings where one has to stand in a huge queue for hours before getting a place to sit. So, if you want to go there and chill with friends over a plate of well cooked steak and few beers, then please go ahead. However if you are expecting amazing ambiance, authentic delicacies then this is not your place my friend.

Its one of the best pub in parkstreet. A perfect place to chill out with friends with boozing. This place has never disappointed me. I've been here countless of times. Olypub is known for its famous Beef Steak, Chicken A La Kiev,,,. The ground floor are pretty stinky, so head to the new section upstairs. Pocket friendly. Good food. Average service. But no great ambiance here, so don't even expect. And lastly, almost too crowded at all times.

This is a nice place to hangout with friends, especially for young adults. The price is low compared to other pubs in the city. The best part about the pub is the ambiance. You can give as much adda as you want and do not miss out on the beef steak. However, once we went there on a group of 8 people. We wanted to join 2 tables and sit together but the waiter seemed very rude and did not allow that. This is the only bad experience I had at this place.

Olypub is a great place for people who like to frequent a drink or two. With the recent up-gradations the place looks a lot better and has become admissible for many people. But for people who are on the other side of the bridge and stay away from the alcohol, the place has nothing much to order. The food is average to be honest and does not do much for my taste buds. To top it all the service isn't as attentive as it should be either.¬†

All the USP that this place is banking upon is the nostalgia connected to this place and the kind of cheap booze. Not a place I would frequent or for that matter visit at all.

Well, this is one of the first bars I have visited and still frequent, so this place holds a lot of memories- both good and bad and some very 'hazy'!! :-P This place has been renovated in the recent past and is much better now, but still half of the drinks listed in the menu is never available and the behavior of the staff has deteriorated! So other than the nostalgia and the fact that the drinks are pretty cheap, this is not really my favourite bar anymore!! But I do love some of their dishes like chicken a la olypub, their famous beef steak, dry chilli chicken, mutton chilli and and mutton boti kebab! This is still a renowned bar in Park Street and I could do with a bit of improvement in the aforementioned areas!

Olypub, Park Street. I found it quite seedy. The drinks are cheap but it is a bit of a dodgy place. The ambience is not the greatest unless they have tidied up a little bit recently. Was not much of a fan of their music either. I found the staff to be quite polite, though. The crowd consists of groups of friends whether it be mixed or otherwise - as opposed to couples. Basically, not really somewhere you would take your girlfriend on a date to. On the other hand, it‚Äôs an economical, casual time. You won‚Äôt feel out of place if you are not dressed up to the max. The food offered is not fine cuisine but goes down well with the beer. Beef Steak is fabulous. It is good for students on a budget. If you are going bar-hopping on a guys night out, this is probably quite a good place to start.

An old Kolkata...passionate to taste alcohol..and for friendly hangouts.... work hard week long...end up with a Saturday evening or Friday evening joint and return home smiling...relaxed...
The beef stake signature of oly..too god
Oly is not a night club not a disc not a regular bar kind...it's a name itself for park street...it gives u company when u r sad or in joy.... great celebration or to relief ur grief...
The young crowd to middle aged boss to old age anglo uncle to college bunch of girls all are welcomed here ....all are recommended

There are restaurants which serve good food. Some are pocket friendly. And then there are some which serve tasty pocket friendly dishes along with reasonably priced booze teamed with nostalgia. Olypub in Park Street falls under the last category. I have lost count how many times I have visited this place. At one time every Saturday evening Olypub used to be our go to place. So it is really hard for people like us to review the place. So, keeping the nostalgia away, let us see what the place is like.

this legendary restaurant still carries the legacy even after decades.¬†
With a large group, roaming aimlessly, better to take them in oly pub. I did it one or two times in my college days. That feeling when you realize your college life ends, you are growing old but some places like oly still remains evergreen. Reviews should not be only about food. service at this place is amazing with the staff making sure that you are comfortable. Its a complete value for money place. Though some inevitable changes took place, that needs renovation. stuffs sometime suggest which should you order or which would be compatible.
some people go there just for the beef steak. I am one of them. Take a chilled strong beer and a Beef Steak! That pretty much sums it all.¬†
ohh yes i mention i have never been n the 1st floor. I never had to. Ground floor still reminds me of those college days.

Have a group take it enjoy cheap drinking have fun type.. this should be the tagline of olypub, located in park street is known for being Booked all the time by youngsters and good old people,Their Beef Steak is pure magic, and is very justifiably popular. But their Mixed Grill is no less. The dark BBQ glaze in both is similar, and north are served with generous sides of mashed potatoes and boiled peas. their fairly priced alcohol is the eye catcher for most of the youth and freshers of the town.A great place to chill out with your buddies and enjoy a quality time. a must visit for college goers and job freshers.

Olypub reminds me of my college days... We used to booze here & then move in to someplace else(The Park) to catch live band performance... Since the booze is quite cheap & food is more or less OK sorts it used to suit our pocket... Usually people hop in to Olypub to get cheap booze so food here is not a priority still for us it is more sort of a heritage joint where sitting there reminds me of the numerous incidents that happened overtime...However mutton fry  & chicken steak tastes good...Cheers:-)

Olypub, is a place which is irreplacable. It has been there for ages, and our previous generation talks of this place as lovingly as we do. Now that is no small achievement. The name itself brings a smile to the faces of most.
You cannot miss their Beef Steak. It's amazing to the T. The servers may be a bit rude, and may nudge you for a hefty tip, but it's Oly so you just laugh about it and let it pass.¬†

Now it has been revamped and the couches have been freshly upholstered. But most of my memories here were of worn out couches, stark white tube-lights and long queues at all times. The queue is still there, but the promise of ultra buttery a la kievs and saucy mixed grills make the wait worth it!

Olypub is not a restaurant, it is not a bar, it is not a night club - you just cannot categorise it. It is one of its kind. First and foremost, hardly anyone goes there for casual or fine dining, neither they flock there for only booze - then what is Olypub - it is an experience, dimly lit, tinkling of bottles and glasses, the waiters running to and fro, dingy spaces between tables made even more restricted by large groups flocking together - people ranging from intellectuals to pure alcoholics and the jewel in the crown being the impressive array of anglo indian khansama style food which these olypub goers will die for - chicken a la kiev, mixed grill, potato chips - a taste which no one can replicate - this is an experience unparallel and uncontested....

It is part of Kolkata's history ...Olypub is entrenched in the psyche of kolkatans...no amount of fine dining joints or restopubs can compete with this ....

I am deliberately not posting any photos here - let interested ones have their own first hand sensual pleasures

It should be a heritage restaurant for the alcoholic people. The food the ambience the drinks the service everything has a charm of its own. Chicken steak, mixed grill, chicken ala keiv, chilli mutton nd every other item in the menu cant be compared to any other restaurants in whole kolkata. Has been nd always will be the favourite pub deep in my heart. ‚ù§

Olypub, the name says it all. 
I have been there so many times and will keep on going there. Olypub introduces itself with most of us during our late teenage or early twenties for the mammas boys. Still one of the best places to hangout. Not a great ambience but yet a lot of nostalgia and memories.

Chicken-a-la-kiev and beef steak is a must try along with some pocket friendly booze. Not much to mention about this place as mostly every kolkatan's know this place well. 

Two things brought down my rating
1.the quality of beef steak has reduced drastically in recent times
2.they should employ some well mannered staff. 
No matter what we'll be there again and again. For the love of the memories we have.

Olypub is one of the rarest places in Kolkata that has maintained it's old-world charm. Despite growing up in Kolkata, it was only recently I have been to this place and although the atmosphere remains a bit iffy, the food is top notch. 
Special mention: chicken ala Kiev and the beaf steak

I've been to Oly pub many times. Just for the beef steak, I've hardly had anything over there other than the steak.
Highly inconsistent is what I would say about their cooking. If you're lucky, you'll get a juicy succulent steak but I,more than once, was greeted with a touch steak. The mashed potatoes served with it is nothing extraordinary, so are the peas and the sunny side up.

Food: Beef steak and a few dishes of chicken are good.
Hospitality: One of the worst ! (Waiters have a don't give a sh** attitude)
Ambience: Nothing special. 
Remarks: The place runs fine because of its age old popularity but otherwise is very average (Waiters make it worse)

Kolkata's beef steak server, and the youth's official drinking is Oly Pub. parking might be a problem, also carry cash since they do not accept cards.
Wait for your turn n get seated. The beef steak quality has definitely gone done...the "well-done" was taken by them too seriously n what reached us was rubbery meat!

The story of most of us with Olypub begins right when we study for our XII Boards or may be in the beginning year of our undergrads, that is when we have just been introduced to drinking by our notorious group of friends. Olypub is one place which is considered to be safe heaven and no one here cares what the adjacent table does. This is probably why people would fret less even if it was the odd individual out smoking or drinking here.

The story of this place is usually the same for most of us. Take a chilled strong beer and a Beef Steak! That pretty much sums it all. The place is divided into two floors with the more sophisticated drinkers usually opting for the first floor while the hardcore ones, mostly coming alone preferring the ground floor. The waiters here are famed for their notorious and careless behavior not exhibiting even the slightest touch of professionalism.¬†

There was a time when I was a regular here and thereby I have had my fair share of experience. The drinks were decently priced, the food wasn't costly as well. The Steaks, Ala Kiev's, all of them used to be a perfect companion to the supercheap booze and neverending gossips with our friends. Not sure, how the place portrays itself these days, but I wouldn't have a clue about it any more as I have given up on drinking. But maybe, just once, I could pay a visit once again. If not for boozing, may be just for the sake of nostalgia!

Olympia fondly referred to as Oly or Oly Pub is the most quintessentially Kolkata watering hole.... Frequented by the old nd the young,,, the advertising gurus to young college kids,,, it is certainly not for the faint hearted..... Old chipped tables,,, a slightly damp smell nd alcohol by the bottle just make it the place it is..... You might not be getting the fancy stuff here,,,, but what you will get for sure is a warm hearty welcome,,, a few friendly faces nd what is deemed to be the best beef steak in the city..... Food is cheap nd so is alcohol,,, the mood is relaxed,,, even though there is no live music, you might just be entertained by an impromptu performance by a slightly buzzed patron.... Oly pub for many generations of Kolkatans has been a love affair, a lover shared by both father nd son during their times.... Visit this place to get a feel of the local,,, I guarantee you will make a friend or so or who knows maybe even fall in love..... :D

Well to be honest by the looks of the place i didn't expect anything good. But they serve awesome beef steaks,which i didn't expect. With cheap booze but the service is very slow,sometimes it's annoying how many times we have to call them. And the worst part was we didn't ask them to place the bill but they placed it without asking us. Not very much satisfied though still it's a good place for casual meet ups with friends.

This place is very close to my heart, so my review will be a bit biased. However, I'll try to be fair and just.
Have been visiting this place since my college days. So lots if memories here. It's the best place to hang out with buddies as the food is detectable and so is the price of alcohol.
My all time favorites are the beef steak and chicken ala kiev.
Must admit that the standards have fallen to a great extent in recent years.

It doesn't offer a wide range of beer which is why I had to take away 1.5 points.
Food served is nothing special.
Ambiance is decent (at least you can't see the cockroaches any more).
One good thing: they measure the liquor in front of you !!¬†
Overall pocket friendly and worth visit if you are around Park Street.

Folks, again this is one of the places which has become a regular joint for me....last visited  it around 4 days ago....so here's what I thought  about it....

This is one of those continuous line of joints along the park street, where the general ambience of the street is retro, happening & kinda gives a cosy feeling, always have been in love with this street....so any joint here starts off with a great note....

This is basically a no-frills-with-an-AC kinda bar....just about decently laid....

On starting off, came to know that it just has two varieties of beer, so that was a dampener.... but now a days just going with tuborg if it feels like  a beer evening. However, in case of other liquor they do have a decent range. 

Talking about food/snacks....don't hope for really good taste but if we are talking about few beer buddies ranting out their miseries / frustrations / adventures with multiple pegs down, what you get here will hold still, plus they do offer basic munchies with every liquor serving which is quite fitting for a motley gathering....please don't hope for too much of class....

Lastly the price, its quite economical.... that's the USP.

All said and done, for an informal gathering of friends or just a relaxed gathering this is a perfect place....I do keep coming back & hope to continue so.....üëçüëçüëç

Definitely one of the vintage bars in Kolkata, it has the perfect ambience and serves you probably the best beef steak in town. The meat is cooked to perfection. However, Chicken Ala Kiev, a fancy dish that they have to offer, is rather overrated. 
It's a great place to relax and get a little tipsy without burning a hole in your pocket. If your heart goes out for bars, don't miss on this place.

As known to all the foodies of Kolkata - OlyPub is the most pocket friendly restaurant in the Park Street area. You'll get cheap liquor here. The food is good, in both quantity & quality. Heard a lot about the Beef Steak, but haven't tried it since its a strict 'no' for me.

Turn Downs > If you are expecting a very soothing & good ambience that would be a big let down. It would have been a big plus point if they start playing some good music. This place is always crowded (its hard to find a seat here) & pretty much loud as a result. The staffs are very busy and not much courteous as expected from a Park Street restaurant. 

BUT overall, I'll give a 4.0 rating to OlyPub as its a very good place to eat and hangout with friends with an extremely acceptable bill that takes care of your pocket.

This is like the Mecca of cheap alcoholics. The price for drinks is quite less. Same can be said about the food. I mean I can't remember the last time when I ate kababs priced less than 200, some were priced around 160. But the taste of the food sucks,JUST SUCKS. I never had so tasteless, oily french fries. The mutton kababs were hard like rubber, the fish kabab was basically fish fry. The service guy was warm.

Only the price of drinks and food is less, I repeat. Nothing much spcl.

The people's bar. Often people get drunk at this place and go to SPE so that they make most value of the money spent. This place was known for its beef steaks and comparatively lower price per bottle/peg. Now, it has gone from bad to worse but even then the place remains full and often it becomes hard to get an empty seat.

Olypub was recommended by a lot of my friends during my visit to Kolkata,they said it was an iconic pub and one that I must not miss going to.

I ended up going there twice and the best part being, I actually liked the place. Quite shady, but located in a nice locality, the pub itself has an old world charm. The drinks are priced quite cheap. And the food is decent. I wouldn't mind going there again for a drink or two. 

Would have loved it if they had a bit of jazz music playing though.:)

Olypub needs no introduction. It is the best pocket friendly bar cum restaurant in Park Street. Olypub classics are considerable i.e. Chicken ala Kiev , Steaks & drinks..
Beef streak, is must and don't let it cool, otherwise, it becomes rubbery.
Then there is the chicken ala kiev - heart shaped chicken fry filled inside with liquid butter.
Good place to hangout with friends.Though Waiter's services are very poor. 
They take too much time to serve after ordering and they don't response quickly.I liked it though they should work on the food quality and staff management.
Overall if you are in Kolkata, once you should visit Olypub.

Ookay! So this place is LEGENDARY and is synonymous with cheap booze and great steaks. 
I am not a big fan of such places, so I am being a little biased, am not much into liquor as much as I am into food, so naturally this place doesn't catch my fancy for sure. 
Upstairs the seats though old are pretty comfortable, but the place does scream for a desperate make over, service is swift and not very pleasant but that's ok, the staff is rather busy and obviously lacks the finesse which is expected from a place like this. 
Ordered for fried eggs with chips ( eggs were perfectly cooked and the fries were rather disgusting ) mutton cutlet was fantastic and chicken ala kiev ...well let's just say I have had better chicken ala Kiev just opposite to this place at one step up. 
The place has a mixed sort of crowd from college freshers to bengali boudis with husbands and brooding men who can easily finish sixteen bottles of beer in a few gulps and dance sheepishly without music in their seats ( without disturbing anyone, thank God ) to foreigners who wants a real feel of Park Street. 
Moderately priced and with no pretension this is a good place to hang out with friends over cheap liquor and average food! Am not a big fan but I am sure others will beg to differ!

This is the best place to go to for a pocket friendly drink. One can laze for as long as they want here without any hassle. Almost all drinks on menu are readily available. However the food is not very good. Apart from beef, the chicken items are disgusting. Finger chips is the only dependable item, apart from fried chicken. The servers are not very friendly some are just plain irritating. It is a good place to go for drinks on a budget and hangout

Ops! Most disgusting bar.....undoubtedly overrated. People should never choose to go there n waste their money.
I, with one of my friends went to grab some beer n hoped to have a good time. So, we sat somewhere n waited for the waiter to come & take the order, meanwhile we lost track of time. However, ultimately after a looong while one waiter approached us with a list of drinks only. Note that, he never bothered to bring the food-list until we requested him couple of time. Not to mention, the food was below average and was served in a horrible way; We even doubted if they wash the plates!!! ¬†The waiter never bothered to 'serve' the beer at all; he just opened the cap & left it to us to pour for ourselves, I DONT EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE BEER MUGS (OR I SHOULD SAY GLASSES) THEY PROVIDE.
I am yet to come to the most interesting point though. :P
When we asked for the bill, we were made to feel as if we were shopping in a 'grocery shop' and a handwritten bill without any Bill-cover had been brought. Let's pardon that too. When I took out a card for paying the bill I was told that they don't accept cards in such an indecent tone!!! However, I went to the Axis Bank ATM across the street n took out some money. Surprisingly, the waiter never even cared to return the Change until we asked for that. (we would not have, but still we actually asked for that, being too irritated n outraged due to that man's indecent behaviour)
We thought to not leave any TIP for the waiter who was looking after our table, but then again, THE WAITER ACTUALLY ASKED FOR SOME TIP ; AND WHEN DENIED, MADE SUCH INSULTING REMARKS!!!!!! NONETHELESS, WE NEVER LEFT HIM A PENNY :)
Rather we offered some tip to the security person standing at the door, he is a true gentleman. :)

The bottomline is.....THIS IS A DISGUSTING PLACE....I AM NEVER GONNA GO THERE. :)

A legend in itself, this place is like a part of Kolkata's heritage..
A bustling pub in the busy park street area crates to quench yr thirst as well as fill yr stomach.. 
Their signature dishes are beef steak and chicken a- la-Kiev..
I simply gorged the steak but the other dish was not suitable for my appetite because of the melted butter filling
Apart from that we had a mixed meat platter , something of a liver curry and dry chilli chicken...which were very run of the mill
The place is always cramped especially on weekends and you might have to wait for yr turn...
As for drinks they don't offer any cocktails thus for light drinkers it might be a problem...(i had to stay content with orange juice)
And another very imp thing for first timers..don't take yr date to this place..this place is meant for frds hangout only..
The service is remarkably slow

This place needs to introduction and is for many the one go to destination whenever it comes to meeting up friends in town over a couple of drinks . The ground floor is non a.c. and does not charge you extra taxes on your bill whereas the first floor is the more popular choice to hang out in the comfort of a chilled zone . The service here is a little biased towards regular drinkers and might seem slow if you're a newcomer . However , when it comes to legendary restaurants in Kolkata , noone can miss their date with ch√¢teau Briand aka the beef steak , with beer for company ! The steak seemed a little difficult to handle , which my friend pointed out , used to be way more cutlery friendly in earlier times . Never mind the distress , once I got through to the meat , I knew what l-e-g-e-n-d-a-r-y means to those who swear by beef and beer at Oly ! The pricing here is a sweet surprise if you consider the location and crowd it offers , and if you're a Kolkatabashi at heart , you don't need a review to tell you where to head for the king of good times !

A legendary den for the Kolkata booze lovers, Very popular. As it has got a reasonably priced menu card and amazingly tasty food as well.

USP:
-> Drinks are reasonable and cheap compare to the area it's located
-> Food variety and taste is good.

Location:
Located at the park Street area very easy to locate on the bylane in the area.

Ambiance & Decor:
Honestly if you are expecting a very classy calm environment this will really not impress you at all. It has a little shabby interiors which been the olypub symbolic. Loud crowd and ever busy atmosphere makes it iconic.

Food:
Steaks are their speciality. Dishes as per my recommendation will be:
-> Beef steak / Chicken steak
-> Chicken ala Kiev
-> Roasted chicken
-> Chilli Prawn
Are one of their best dishes.
Note: Drinks are quite cheap as well.

Service: Decent service and not very courteous you expect. But still I really admire them for managing the crowd. They have been doing this for a long time now and doing fair enough. Well done!!
Cheers!!!

Overcrowded, crammed, and noisy, you have to wait to get a table here. At the end of all the wait, you get very few items to choose from. The servers themselves recommend that you don't try anything too fancy, and it's definitely not the place for vegetarians. The entire city knows of Oly Pub's beef steak. It's cheap, of course, but it's also tough like leather - You'll need surgical knives and tools to tear out one small bite. The taste isn't anything particularly mind-blowing either. And I have never understood the significance of the single, vinegar-soaked mushroom piece. The booze is pretty inexpensive too. If you' re on a budget and don't mind the noise and crowd, you can hang out here with beef, booze and your buddies. This is where most Kolkatans lose their beef-virginity, and their teetotaler status, which is why Oly Pub holds a special place in the hearts of people here. It does have a sentimental value and an old-world charm, but that's probably all.

Quite place with a subtle ambiance for meeting up, having a bite and just hanging out with friends. We ordered the Beef Steak and Chilli Prawn. The steak was undercooked and it seemed as if it was made in haste as the presentation suggested. The Chilli Prawn was the saving grace for the evening. For people who like to have a swivel at an alcoholic liquor and chill, this is one of the best spots in Kolkata to visit.

After a walk on a hot Sunday afternoon, tired and hungry we walked into Olypub. At 3pm also it was full; we had to kind of share a table which we were not comfortable with. However this didn't hamper our spirits and we had a great time.

We really enjoyed our experience at Olypub. The food portions are decently good and more than enough. Food presentation, taste, quantity and quality needs a special mention. Booze is definitely cheap and good place to hang out and relax.
Special mention to good service by the staff.

It runs on a brand name. They should start with other mode of payments... And please gone are the days when you couldn't get a good beef steak . They should stock up their alcohol brands written on menu and change the menu bring in some modernization to it Nostalgia would not take  miles...

A favourite for people looking to grab a drink for cheap. The decor in the renovated upstairs is better but difficult to get a table during peak hours. The service is slow and the waiters would always have a laid back Govt-employee like attitude. Order their regulars like Chicken a la Kiev and Fish fingers. You would never get to choose from more than 1 or 2 beer brands so prepare to be disappointed.

One of those places which you hear a lot about from friends and people; today was my turn to visit for the first¬† time.
A hurriedly planned college reunion (just 4 of us) ensured we land up at Park Street in the scorching heat today. Beat the Heat; we had one motto, we started off with chilled beers. I ordered a Heineken for myself; little I say about it the better.

Coming to the snacks, we opted for the Olypub special Chateau Briand Beef. It was garnished with peas and a poached egg. Taste wise, out of the world, can even beat the best cooked mutton (I bring this comparison as I am quite fond of mutton). A friend ordered Paneer Chilli which wasn't up to the mark, but then who cared?

As a third dish, we had the Chicken Reshmi Kebab. This I felt was sort of ok, nothing to rave about. May be then can look at ways to make it tastier.

But then, I'll look forward to my next visit here. Loved it first time...

Good place to have beer and beef stake. Prices are at per in that area but affordable.  The only drawback is that it is allways crowded, Weekends are the most.

What better place is there to get slightly sloshed other than the famous Olypub.... Ever since I was a child I found olypub to be a place of enigma and wondered what was behind those tinted doors... And yesterday I found out!!! 
The ambience is what you would expect.... Of a cheap pub... Though the upstairs has undergone a good facelift I was informed.... My cousin and I ordered drinks after drinks like jaat mataals and thank god we were Taal e thik even at the end of it... They had only one peg of the Green apple Smirnoff ( my favourite) so after the first i settled with the regular Smirnoff... They didn't have Beefeater or Bombay Sapphire Gin ( which was my first choice). My Bro had his regular Blender's pride.... The food... Fried chicken and fish finger were okay okay ... Nothing to write home about and tad greasy for my liking.... But who goes to oly for the food... The legendary beef steak ( in my case Mutton streak) are reserved for out next soir√©e there.... 
The bill was out of the world cheap... With two grubs and 8 large pegs.... It was only 1900.... Well we don't really judge legends and we don't want them to change...

Knowing that it is one of the famous heritage pub in Kolkata, I planned a get together of my friends in one weekday evening. But sadly the experience was pathetic. Starting form the cleanliness, service standards, hospitality, staff behaviour, food quality and taste everything is a big disaster. Restroom stinks with bad odour, urinals have got stains on it, floors were wet. Coming to service and food quality and taste, service attendants have got a very lazy and reluctant attitude towards the guest. You really need to shout to call them for attending you.  Food was pathetic. We ordered their signature dish 'Chateau Briand' and specially specified the service personnel that we want it to be medium done. But while the steak was served it was served 'Well done'. Moreover the mashed potato tasted awful. I feel that they don't have any idea on the preparation of mashed potato. Hardly there were any flavour of butter rather I feel they have used some kind of oil to prepare the mash.

Having a bad experience on the steak we thought of giving another try to some other dish, so we ordered for 'Chicken a la Kive'. While asking the attendant about the dish it seemed that the guy was totally clueless about the dish as he explained it as a chicken starter looks like a cutlet. While the dish was served it was hot and looked nice but when I tasted it, again it failed to fulfil my expectation. The bread crumb coating was too thick and the chicken inside was having a stale flavour.

Expecting that the management will take all these reviews seriously and will improve on their opportunities.

Cheap alcohol. Beef steak. That pretty much sums up the place. It's tough to get a seat here in the evening. Mostly young college going crowd and old timers. The place was recently redone after a fire broke out. The food sometimes is quite delayed and on two occasions my steak was under and over cooked. They give the bill as a handwritten receipt. Make sure you tally the amounts and also they must issue printed receipts. The waiters hang around your table with the bill bargaining for the tip. Quite unprofessional and even outright irritating at times.

One fine Monday we decided to pay a visit at this place. Probably my first and last visit & apologies to my Man for ruining his lunch.
First appearance is nothing extra ordinary, plain simple restaurant no proper decor. I would rather say very low maintained cheap sort of ambience for a high profile location like this, I saw a baby cockroach going around the floor.
Getting down to food, we started with budwisers 3 bottle of them. ¬†They were chilled, i would say only good thing in the restaurant. Then came chicken roast (half) Two pieces of chicken accompanied with boiled vegetables and potato wedges. honestly I never had such bad chicken. It was so dry, chewy, flavours were obviously out of question. I didn't understand if the boiled veggies were rotten or dipped into vinegar. They were so sour. For veg we ordered "aloo matar ki sabji" & tandoori roti. Sabji was so stale, it was having bad smell from it. Rotis were not cooked properly. When we complained the waiter said "this is how our food is made if you don't like we can't help it". However they cancelled the veg order and replaced with butter naan and paneer butter masala. i went extra step and ordered chilli prawn. later half naan were still ok paneer was hard, gravy was very ok like any other road side joint. prawns were so small you literally had to remove the "besan" skin to find it out. Service was disgusting, waiters have no clue what they are doing, no customer service. Icing on the cake becomes a bill of 1357/- which came even before we finished our food. Not at all recommended. Guys go through the review before paying a visit your hard earned money is not worth it.

Located in park street

The place is dirty, not classy, shabby and very irritating.

Its famous as a cheap bar with awesome beef steak but come on, the real foodies are not interested in just that.

The place is actually not even fit to be in park street.

Un-hygeinic. Better avoid the place and avoid falling ill.

AN over hyped place! a lot of people talk of olypub so i had to visit it.
We had to wait to get seats...(the person at the door lets you in fast if you bribe him)¬†
On entering, i found it to be a very shabby place full of people who love their alcohol.¬†
They dont keep premium brands of alcohol which was a disappointment but i guess,
what they keep is according to their crowd!
Called for a roast chicken whcih was served hot but was just edible....nothing great.
a mutton steak which was again just edible.
I decided to leave as i did not enjoy the place much and thats about it.

Shoestring budget but wanna get drunk the classy way then this is where you should be . A bar with a way too awesome casual ambience just the way it should be . The beer is cheap and chilled except for times when they run out of stock and you have just one or two beer options available . Talking about the food if you like beef then theres good news because olypub's beef steak is world famous in kolkata haha . For other items on the food menu , i would say , be sure before you order .

Located on the PARKSTREET road, after park.

Best pocket friendly bar cum restaurant in Park Street. Loved the renovated form. It is famous for its beef steak, so ordered it. It was great, as usual. Also ordered chicken tandoori. Strange, that tandoori comes in half plate only, not full plate.  And quantity isn't worth the cost. Choice of beer was also limited to three options only.

A Kolkata classic. Serves a good chateaubriand steak, fish fries, chicken tikkas etc. The ground floor can get pretty stinky, so head to the new section upstairs. The old waiters are helpful while the younger lot is markedly rude. Value for money.

This place is like an affordable oasis in the middle of an expensive Sahara desert a.k.a Park Street.

When you are in Park Street, affordable food/drinks is a hypothetical concept. Olypub is one of those places there where you can go crazy on the menu without fretting over the price tags.
It's easy on the pocket, which is its USP.

Apart from that, the drinks, the service, the food, is quite decent and the value you get for your money is skyrocketing. There is a 98% chance that you'll have an amazing & fun time.

Thank me when you pay your bill there!

The ultimate pocket friendly watering hole in Parkstreet.cheerful and busy ambience,it is hard to get a table in peak hours.The atmosphere is laid back and you can have a very good adda with your friends.It is comfortable for girls as well and no dark/sleazy ambience as the word 'cheap watering hole' suggests.To me it is similar to Kolkata coffee house in college street,with a bar license,and better quality of food.

Coming to food,their cocktail sausages and mixed grill are my alltime favourites.They taste great and can easily be shared around.Drinks come with complimentary 'chanachur' .Not a big fan of their fish fingers though.They lack seasoning and taste bland.A tartar based dip would have done the trick,but they serve only ketchup,that too on request.

The checken ala kiev are popular here,but taste quite flat and bland compared to Mocambo IMHO

Waiters are as old as the place and may appear snobbish to some.we have no problem with their patronising attitude though.

All in all,if we are a group of friends intending to catch up on some adda over cheap drinks and tasty food,oly it was,is and probably will be

I visited the famous Oly Pub with really high hopes of trying their famous steak but alas all in vein The ambience wasn't good the crowd sucked n above all they didn't have any good beer.  How can a pub not have Budweiser, Tuborg or Foster man!! The temperature was quiet low n even after requesting several times they refused to turn up the temperature. Oh yeah last but not the least "the steak never turned up". We were so disgusted that we had to leave the place.

This is good place to drink in park street in terms of money they charge considering where they are located. The ambience i would say is standard though nothing like the park street type(as i already told you its pocket friendly). Now i have been to this place twice the steak they serve is really good and the platter as well(i dont remember the name but it had bacon beef and chicken) so all this at a reasonable good price. What else does one need in life.

Right in the middle of the Park Street, this is the place where all the young boys and girls of the city come to have a drink. The beef steak is the trademark of Olypub and if u hate beef, then there is the chicken alakiev - heart shaped chicken fry filled inside with liquid butter. Although the service is not so good, the ambience and the food n drinks make up for it.

A worthy place to have a gala time with friends. You go in with your friends and come out all wasted. One of the oldest bar in the heart of the city of joy. This place is not worthy of all the hype it gets, an average shack with people working here have an immense attitude. I will surely emphasis on the service, PATHETIC. You will not get most of the brands mentioned on the menu. To top it all they think people should serve them with a load of tips. Yes, this place is cheap, maybe cheaper as compared to it's other counterparts in that area. The food is good. The olypub classics are considerable i.e. Chicken al e Kiev , Steaks & drinks.

The beer is a bit overpriced but reasonable compared to its neighbors. No great ambience here. No music even. The food and the price for it makes it a place to be.

Heard that people consider this place to be mecca of good times. A worthy place to have a gala time with friends. You go in with your friends and come out all wasted. One of the oldest bar in the heart of the city of joy. Well I guess, all this hype about them has gone to their heads and that is why these people think as if they have reached the pioneer of everything. At first I thought yes, some what they have reached the peak but gradually I made the conclusion that this place is not worthy of all the hype it gets, an average shack with people working here have an attitude as if after coffee house if anything is to considered as a HERITAGE in Kolkata, it is this, it is this it is this.

I will surely emphasis on the service, PATHETIC. You will not get most of the brands mentioned on the menu. All they say is "sir, ye abhi nahi hai, aap ye lelo (sir, this is not available, consider this instead)" . To top it all they think people should serve them with a load of tip for that unacceptable behavior and service.
Yes, this place is cheap, maybe cheaper as compared to it's other counterparts in that area. The food is good. The olypub classics are considerable i.e. Chicken al e Kiev, French fries, dry chilli chicken, roasted chicken, mix meat platter. Will be posting the pictures along with. Didn't had the beaf steak though (personal issues).
Pocket, yeah it didn't pinched me much. Overall it's a good place, minus the service. But in restaurant how can you neglect that, right!
Anyway peace.

The food is really good. Overall a place to hang out as it's busy and the interiors are ok for the place. One caution. .... The security at the door also asks for a tip. ... rest place is good.

I don't know how can anyone mess up chilli chicken. It tasted more like a confused chicken65. The beer is a bit overpriced but reasonable compared to its neighbors. 
I spotted a lot of people ordering the steak. Unfortunately my waiter forgot to inform me about it when I asked him for the house speciality. Well maybe that would've gotten them above the 3.0.

Note: this review is only for non veg food lovers. This place offers very few vegetarian dishes.
I have been here quite a few times. It is quite economical for the food they provide. Drinks too are not expensive. Chicken a la Kiev, chicken olypub are quite good. I did not like the mutton kebab though. It surprisingly was prepared in gravy. The food and the price for it makes it a place to be. Service is average.

Now this is one place which has been a part of every college student's life who's been in Kolkata. Christmas eve isn't possible without you and your group getting high in this place. From the cheapest available alcohol in Park Street to amazing snacks and special mention to the free "chanachur". Their chicken A-la-kiev, fried chicken, chilli prawn and chicken boti kebab are a set of amazing foods that we had in this place. Olypub has made a mark in all our lives from past few decades.

Do visit this place at least once and if you want to avoid the crowd, do not choose the holidays. You might end up standing in a queue for hours.

Back to oly after almost a decade and boy was I in for a surprise. Now most of kolkata started their slippery slope here whilst in college . The management totally updated the upstairs after the fire with parquet flooring , new seating and brighter lighting . Stylised posters of all the international beer brands definitely not available here, grace the walls. Gone are the old carpets and the lone dhere indur (field mice ala oly) who occasionally brushed against your leg.
The food has definitely not changed ! My father who accompanied me today opted for the fried prawn with English mustard just like he would a good 30 years back.  The chicken ala Kiev still works for me as does the mixed grill. The place has definitely smartened up though the food and service remains the same. 
Foodie tip-  If you have less alcohol in your system you appreciate the food even more.

Comparatively Cheap restaurant in park street. Good for drinking alcohol only. Food items are not so good. I liked only the "fried Chicken liver" and "chicken ala olypub" . Waiter's services are very poor. They take too much time to serve after ordering and they don't response quickly! And that's very annoying!

I love Oly Pub. One because the ambience is just like a good ole' bar, secondly the alchohol is cheap and to top it all their food is great too. The beef steak, and the Chicken Ala Kiev are my favourites. If you like to drink, I think you must visit Oly, it's nothing short of a Calcutta classic. Also, it is safe for youngsters to visit Oly. They have a redone section upstairs that gets a good crowd of young people o the myth about it being unsafe should be busted. Keep in mind, it's generally very crowded on the weekends.

2. Chicken liver grilled.. Very very tasty indeed
3. Chateau briand.. Yes the classic beef item
. very well cooked.. Very delicious.. Must try
4. Cocktail sausage.. Very average dish.. Poor one.. It seems to b just d sausage fry :(
5. Chilly prawn.. Yes just yummy

Last but not the least.. We took thnda cooler as drink.. Both the orange n lemon one
... Lemon one is must try.. Yes as I stated non alcoholic review

Cost 1100 for two person ...

Two storied bar is spacious and sober enough.

Liquor available at cheap prices.....one of d oldest bars in park street.....ordered reshmi kabab with red wine....the kabab was not good , not as we expected.....nice ambience with an antique look keeping in mind that it is one of the oldest joints.....well,I liked it though they should work on the food quality and staff management.....

A good place for DRINKS only! Food is okay-ish. However, the snacks turn out to be horrendous. A check on that is neccessary. Meanwhile the best of Olypub is the Chicken Alakiev ‚ò∫ which is a MUST TRY!!

Living on its legacy or else the place has degraded a lot over the past few years...still attracts people of all ages...the beef steak is still famous though has lost the old charm....on the same track as the coffee house...considered to be legendary...still attracts people from all ages...slowly heading towards obscurity

Walked in after really long time - hmmm...possibly after 5 years !!!

As usual it was crowded inside - on a Friday evening...we were lucky indeed to get a table for 4 available for us...

Veg cutlet & French fries were safe bait & good to go with the drinks of individual choice...

My non-vegetarian friends ordered Beef steak for which they chose the place & decided to visit after so many years ...

Over all a Friday evening well spent at 'Oly' üëç...

Well after a long time I went to this place last month. Seriously, the place has deteriorated a lot. But I mainly visit this place for their Beef steak. Except the beer and beef I didn't like anything. Pineapple juice we ordered had a fly in it. 
Club Sandwiches were awful. 

Thank you. Never in my wildest dream I'm visiting this place again.

Some places have ambience and others are so old that they build character. Needless to say Olypub is one of the latter. Arguably there is no other place in the city where the peg measure runneth over, quite literally. As far as food is concerned the roast chicken, chicken a la Kiev and the ubiquitous chateaubriand beek steak is recommended.

Their service is no doubt friendly and food is good. Not extremely pricy, reasonable.

One of the legends in the pub experience. Since its revamp a year ago, the interiors have become a bit more classy. Sadly though what I have experienced is that the food quality has degraded a bit in the last 2 years even though the price has gone up. I personally now prefer the mixed grill over the beef steak or the chicken ala kiev. A couple of waiters are good while the rest of them have a laid back attitude. Apart from these few negatives, its still a great place to hang out with friends over a glass of booze.

The place is cheap and has uncourteous staff. Food served in dirty plates and glasses. Staff cribs to change them. Had only two brands of beer and no card payment accepted in this day and age.

Heritage pub of Kolkata. No wonder they serve good food. Beef Steak is one of their best. Visited this place many times but last time i went there, their service was not good, few waiters were behaving rude with us and also with others, apart from that oly pub is one of my favourite. It's an extremely pocket friendly place in Park Street area, ambience is no doubt good.
If i have to rate evrything out of 5, then:
Ambience 3/5
Food 3.5/5
Service 2/5
Price 4/5
Hopefully, when next time i visit they behave properly with their customers.

Standing in the heart of the city, this place warmly welcomes teenagers and adults who are looking for some time off their busy schedule with their loved ones or even with their own self. This place boasts of their beef steak and chicken a la Kiev and not to forget the drinks at such a reasonable price. The molten butter inside the chicken a la Kiev and the smoky flavour of beef can boost up the murmurs of your stomach .Sit back, have a drink , enjoy the food and have a great time talking about all that you want to. This place gives you sheer delight :)

Nice and cheap place to be @Park Street. Long time meet up with my school friends. Nice atmosphere - you will find groups of varied interests visiting for a nice Adda over a drink or two. 

Titbits like French chips, chicken a la Kiev and a la lebanese compliments well. 
You can try their famous beef steak (here say), looked yummy üòã 

Service is nice, staff were courteous. Some of you may be wondering about their smoking verandah, well they have stopped that. You have to move outside their premises for a smoke. Welcome move for some non smokers out there üòâ

Overall a nice and enjoyable experience with my friends. 
Looking forward to visit again.

Food- 4/5.
Service- 3.5/5. ( Too crowded for service to be fast, don't order off the regular stuff, ask for quick delivery time of items)
Ambience- 3.5/5. ( A recent make over to 1st floor has uplifted the looks)
Price- 5/5.
Parking- 2/5 ( Considering right on Park Street).
Heritage- 5/5.
Value For Money- 4.5/5.

You walk in here, and you are very likely to brush your shoulder with some intellectual stalwart/ teen college guy with equal probability. This place is a conglomeration of every aspect of Kolkata. Its typically Bengali adda, place to vent out anger at bosses, place to cry over ex(s), place to romanticize, place to celebrate- one occasion and every occasion. Drinks very are dirt cheap. Signature dishes: Chicken A La Kiev (Buttery Russian delicacy ), Chicken A La Olypub ( an addition of bread toast and mashed potato gravy to Chicke A La Kiev), Prawn Cutlet, Fish Cutlet, Roast Chicken. Mutton cutlet is very nice too. There is a beef dish which I do not remember which I have heard is nice too. Drink- specialty here is rum with lime cordial and coke. Else try your own choice of drink- you get here dirt cheap. One strange thing, the waiter insist on tips, which you can give ( 10/20/30/40) depending on total bill amount as they don't charge service charges. The ambience is bit dark sorts, but given the history of being going here since past many years ( decade) can vouch for the good place to hang out with bunch of people. But yes its not a fancy place. So be aware of it. I personally make sure I visit just to soak in the spirit of the place at least once.

Its is one of the oldest and most popular bars in the city. You will come across many people who have not heard about Oly :D The booze is cheaper than many food is also moderate in cost. The quality of the place is on a decline over the years. They do not accept cards.

Food: They have a limited bar menu and due to huge sales, run out of certain drinks frequently. This place used to be famous for Steak, one of the earliest proponents of steaks in kolkata and they still cook a decent dish( must have one if you visit). Over all food is not that good though so beware of ordering anything extravagant.

Service: Service is lax, people are rude and opportunistic, you need to slip a few to he staff to get quick seats.¬†

Ambiance: very crowded and noisy place . You will frequently see drunk pople having quarrels and brawling with staff.¬†

Verdict: Visit for the steak and its popularity and to get stone drunk, not recommended for girls or dates.

Olypub in short is a common man's paradise when it comes to drinks and food.
I remember having Chicken AlaKiev every time I visit the place. It's a must for the chicken fans out there. The other day we were so hungry we kept on ordering food without the tension of creating a hole in our pockets. There was AlaKiev, Roast Chicken, Sausages, Grilled fish, Whiskey 30ml (refilled) , lemon juice and coke. All for a meagre 1300! 
You're in kolkata and you do not visit Olypub , something that you ought not happen. 
About the service, the 1st floor still has a calm ambience than the ground floor 's where you'll get tired of calling the waiter kaku  but he'd come after ages. That's the con part of it being so cheap. But then anything for cheap food and drinks. Cheers!

If you are a true bong and love to hangout with booze till u drop, u must have visited this place at least once. Nothing special about this place apart from nostalgia. Many famous writers, business tycoons, actors who have glorified Kolkata's name - you might find some of them here. The beef steak is the signature dish of this place. Alcohol rates are very cheap compared to other park street bars and pubs. Mostly the party animals in kolkata target this place to get high and then go to SPE or Venom or any other disc.
However, if the management comes out of the engrossing factor of nostalgic hallucination, they can improve a lot -
1. Include card payment
2. Make the place a bit more cleaner than what it is now
3. Appoint some well mannered staffs. Honestly, now what happens is if you eat an item over there and u call one waitor to report the issue, they would simply ignore or give you a scolding look for sure.
4. Mustry items - Cocktail sausage and beef steak

Go back for the nostalgia. Or find out what the buzz is about.

The place now seems to be filled to the brim with college kids. Very hard to get a place to sit. Waiters too are unfazed by your conundrum of finding a chair.

Drinks at such reasonable prices and that too at Park Street is not it's USP(according to me). The Chicken A La Kiev and Chicken A La Olypub certainly are. Whenever I am at Olypub I make it a point to order the above mentioned items. Other than these the Hamburger steak is also good. These items exude " Vintage". The ambience is just as it always was.....shabby. Service....I have always maintained that the waiters at Olypub are the most nonchalant you will find anywhere in Kolkata. The only thing that they keep a watch on is the 'Tip' you are shelling out at the end of your visit (gets on my nerves). Yet the "good old days" charm of this place keeps me bringing back to this place every time. Would have given a better rating only if the service had been a bit more courteous.

I used to visit this place a lot during my high school days. I still do ,  but not like before since i do no live in the city of joy much due to educational reasons. But i do make sure to drop by and have a quick drink if am anywhere near park street. It is a great place to catch quick cheap drink with a wide range of alcohol to choose from the liquor menu , including some local beer and wine, and enjoy the steak if you are a meat lover. A good place to catch up with old times with a close mate over a nice drink and food.

Olypub is famously known for its cheap booze and the legendary beef steak. Its a must have. The other must try is chicken a la kiev. The decor is very ordinary but this place doesn't pretend to be so. Its a pocket friendly option to hangout and laze about with beer, booze and meat and gossip to one's hearts content.

Shabby place with low light and clumsy service. Though pocket friendly, the service fails to appeal me. The place was once a favourite but now it is avoided as much as possible. The chicken a la kieve is good but nothing outstanding and has never been much of an option because it is the only thing that looks decent on the menu.

This place needs no description. But its mandate to write 140 chars so:
Cheapest booze in the area.
A must visit if u wonna dig into the Beef Steak and Chicken A La Kiev (the specialities). As a matter of fact, the venue turns into a favourite reunion point. 
P.s.- A strict no no for people like me ( vegan + teetotal )

As always drinks were ok and served promptly. Service was good. But the quality of food of main course was not so well. Somehow I found reshmi kebab that I ordered was lil less warm. But what I loved most in food was chicken ala kiev was super. For a drinking purpose it is OK. Though I miss the first floor place of olypub.

So are you looking for a decent place to drink and also craving for meat ?? Are you somehow thinking about park Street ?? And will the place be cheap ?? Well, its a default answer for you .. Olypub !! I just love this place and this is not a review from my side rather a reminder to all the oly fans out there that our place have not lost its charm by any means . I was gladly willing to give a 5 out of 5 rating but 2 things that hindered me from giving the full marks are :- 

1. Bad lighting . 

I mean it's too bright inside to be in a pub.

2. Not all beers are available .

I thought this is a real downer . But kingfisher strong is their BAU beer so you can still get the job done .

As for the food its amazing to find such a good continental spread so cheap in park Street . I would recommend the following with booze : -

1. Fried chicken
2. Chicken ala Kiev 
3. Beef steak.
4. Mixed grill platter ( A must have )
5. Roasted chicken.

This place should be in the meat cravings section of zomato . I have attached the pics of items 1, 4 and 5 from my recent experience . But I guess almost everyone is familiar with the rest of the items . I think this is a blessing in disguise for people who are not willing to burn their pockets but have a good time in park Street . The waiters are so well behaved and seasoned . I wish to go there once in every month and i love it every time .

This is a drinking den serving cheap booze in a not so pleasing ambiance but great food makes up for it. 

It is on the main road in park street and looks really promising from outside. But from inside its just simple seating in a room with bar. Still you have to wait for about 15-30 minutes to get a table in evening. Its always full and reason is its popularity among the people for its good food. Staff is also very average and is not like what you expect at a bar. But again cheap prices justify everything. 

I ordered their beef steak which took some time to arrive and was also not very good to look at as being served without any neat manner of serving with mashed potatoes, egg and boiled peas. But when it came to taste, it was a clear winner with its tender meat and brilliant texture fused with tongue pleasing taste. 

In all very much recommended if you want good food and cheap drinks without giving a damn to decor and ambiance.

1. Food: 4/5
2. Ambiance: 3/5
3. Service: 3.5/5
4. Value of Money: 3.75/5

Oly Pub has been an absolute obvious choice whenever there's no wallet support. The food and the ambiance has significantly improved from 4 years back. Although this is definitely a NO-NO for the fancy pubbers.
Just an issue, don't take a vegetarian friend to this place who is looking to eat unless you are trying to shrug him/her off your shoulder.

After a hectic day at work, I needed drinks to calm my nerves. My friend suggested me Olypub.

1. It's a typical bar. A typical bar. Not on the shadier side though. The interiors are dark with tables stacked in files.

2. For a bar, place was decent on cleanliness. ¬†However, they did not bother to place a holder for glasses and soda bottles. Table was eventually littered with water.

3. The service was okay. The waiter was insistent on speaking in Bengali. I had to be very careful while ordering to ensure that he wrote what I ordered. He said a lot of things in Bengali to which I did not react. And then simply I placed my order. #TalkToMyHand.

The waiter was almost scandalized when I finally said no to repetition of drinks.

4. I tried chicken liver and papad.

Chicken liver was a bit dry but was tasty. Do try it here.

It's affordable and a decent place to go.

It's a magical place, an old watering hole with charm and character. It's not the perfect place to be, you'll will find many a better bars and many a cheaper bars and many a bars with better ambiance and courteous servers, a place with more modern menu and fun drinks, but no place and I mean no place can be Olypub. Yes it's a bit rundown, but if you are out to have fun with friends isn't it better to be at a place with no fake attitude. If you feel the servers are don't care for you much its because they have a lot on their hands and if you want better service go somewhere else, you don't belong here. I am a regular and as some of the servers know me, so for me its descent, and say if you like the place but the service is the limiting factor for you, well would suggest you to do this, treat them well, be well mannered and slide in fifty bucks with your first pour, you won't have any complains after that. What we usually don't follow TIPS basically stand for To Insure Prompt Service, so go ahead and tip before you are served, the service won't disappoint you. I like the place as it has no ambiance, no mood setting music or interior decor; as a result it doesn't cater to a specific mood or a specific type of people. You'll find all sorts of people here, you can find a group of 3 to 6 college students sitting next to a middle aged man who is in for a quick drink before he heads home after a hectic day at work and right next to them you could find working professional, a group of old friends meeting after ages or say a bunch of party birds, boozing up before they hit the night clubs. This place has a certain quality cannot pinpoint, it has that special charm, to me it has a soul. There are better bars but none better for meeting fiends and just having a good time.

Visited here yesterday! I would have given it 3.5 had the behaviour of the waiters been not that rude!! The food is really good...though some might say that it has degraded over the past couple of years! But the service is pathetic...too slow & not friendly at all.¬†

Coming to the menu - ordered the beef steak (famous here) which was no wonder tasty! perfectly grilled!! One can also try Mutton cutlet. Its yummy!! My friend took mixed platter which according to her was good too!¬†
Many pop in here to try their cheap liquor but I didn't order any! I came here only for the beef steak & mutton cutlet which satisfied me!¬†

Word of caution - This place is mostly crowded with rowdy people so avoid taking your date! It will be ruined for sure! But if you want to hang out with friends over chilled beer and some delicious food, then olypub is a must try! :)

Writing a review of this place is just not enough for this place. I've been to this place many times. Though first time I was rejected to get drinks over here because I wasn't 21 then. The ambience isn't a huge attraction of this place but food & drinks you get over here are just great and extremely pocket friendly. Surely the best pub for college students to hang out with friends.
PS :: chicken a LA Kiev and Beef steak are must try.

And the saddest part... there were 2 guys from out of india.. who just visited olypub caz of the name it has and were utterly disappointed by the service and attitude of the waiters. No cards accepted, no proper table service.. nothing.. waste waste waste.. ¬†I would never go to OYPUB again.

The place itself is famous enough to be reviewed. The construction suggests it is very old. One of the oldest in Park Street. This is famous for pocket friendly alcohol. The food is not that good compared to it's neighbours. However people choose this place not for food but for drinking purpose. A good place to reunite with old friends and to make new friends. This place is very popular among college students as it is pocket friendly. Lastly the location and the popularity keeps the place busy all time. The service is good. A must go place for Kolkata people and people travelling to Kolkata.

This place needs to be removed from the tag 'legendary resturants'. Their quality of service has degraded so much over the years. They literally spoiled my new year. I used to go there when i was in college. Went there for New year's lunch and the waiters ignored me and my friend for over 15 minutes. And when we asked them why they were so ignorant they spat back at us. Honestly if the behaviour of the staff is so horrendous then its only good that this place got burnt down last year. Shoud'nt have reopened in the first place.

Olypub is iconic, will always be. It's alright if I don't get it. To me only those places that continue to charm are worthy of being legends. Olypub, sadly, seems to have let itself go, and how.

The fries were actually wedges, soggy ones at that. Chilli paneer looked and tasted like day old gruel. The sausages were unappetizing. The fresh lime soda was missing a key component - lime.¬†

The service is headache-inducing. The hygiene levels are atrocious. I hate to be so harsh but there were no positives. Heavy price to pay for the pocketfriendliness.

If you are looking for a destination where you and your friends can have some good time over a few drinks, and that's too on a shoestring budget, then Olypub is the place you should opt for.
Needless to mention that this place is pretty popular among the students because of its reasonably priced menu, especially drinks.
The place is usually a bit crowded and service is a bit slow, but a pub at Park Street, offering liquor at such an affordable price is supposed to be crowded, eventually resulting in a bit slow service.
But overall its worth giving a try. And as the place is popular among the students since decades, it has been a good place for reunions also where ex-students can get a perfect environment to get back to the nostalgia of their student life and the awesome moments associated with it.
So even being a crowded pub altogether(with eventual loudness in the ambience), this place is an exceptional one which have its own legendary charm and deserves a 4+ rating.

We mainly went there to have alcoholic  beverages but while giving the orders, the waiters rudely asked to show our id cards for age proof!!! I mean seriously?

So finally I went to this famous bar situated at one of the most envious locations in Kolkata, Park Street.
Pros: The ambience is quite chill where you can have really good time with your friends. The place is always in demand, and usually you will find people waiting outside. The liquor is not expensive when compared to nearby places.
Cons: The service wasn't as expected. Few of the seats aren't well placed, and the place is a bit congested. From the list of food items, we ordered the Cheese Slices which turned out to be exactly that which was unfortunate because we were expecting something more at that price.

I've been to this particular place for a number of times now and sadly the place keeps on disappointing me. 
Pros: Ambience
The ambience of this place is perfect to have a good time. The place is always crowded but after a few drinks it won't matter anymore.
Pocket friendly
The place is pocket friendly and especially the drinks are cheaper compared to other places. The food on the other hand will dig a considerably deep hole in your pocket.
Cons: Service
Pretty poor service to be honest. The waiters are hardly attentive & you'd probably have to wave your hands for a while before you catch their attention.
Non-availability
It says here on the menu that this place serves Budweiser, but of course it isn't available at the moment. This kind of stuff is very infuriating, especially when a patron wants to try out new things. 
So, my overall review is this is a decent place where one can enjoy and also be economical.

This place at Park Street is famous for its Beef Stake. Almost everyone visiting this place must have tried it for sure. Well I had there Beef Stake along with Chicken A-La Kiev. The price is OK. The dishes were good but for me the Chicken A-La Kiev was better than the Beef Stake. The ambience is nothing spectacular and the service is just about okay. So in case one wants to have good Beef Stake at decent price this is the place in Kolkata.

The classic oldtimer in Parkstreet.
A place which some people have been visiting  for the last 10 years and some people like me who got introduced just yesterday!! Post the shutdown the restaurant has been revamped and I quite liked the ambience. We ordered the classic chicken ala olypub and beef steak. We didn't have anything to drink (much to the waiters amazememt) because our hungry souls were too eager for food. Both the dishes were really good specially the chicken with all its butter and cheese. Absolutely yumm and wholesome!! The only suggestion that I have for this place is that they should introduce some cocktails so that people (like me) can get to drink something light and they should definitely have shots!!! Other than that it's a place one can always go back to!! Cheers!!

I like this place a lot like every other true bong no matter how bad it is.....
Yes it is always crowded be it a monday or a Saturday! !
The ambience might be below average!
The service might be annoying at times!
They do not let u in unless u have all the members of the group on wkends!!
They do not care whether u like it or not!
But of all odds yes this place has its own charm & I am a big fan of mutton cutlet here!!!!!! Yes I am!!!!!
I have also tried many other dishes but my favourite is the cutlet though last day I donno y they put so many chilies in it & the steak was also burnt that we could smell it (usually they dont) that too on a wkday when i dnt find a reason of being in hurry or whatever! 
So its a humble request donot downgrade the quality cause u r a benchmark for other pubs in Kolkata.

Today I went to olypub with three friends for a drink..The expirence in a word was horrible. After hearing from so many friends about it being the Kolkata's best beef steak joint, we ordered the same & the thing what we were served was not beef steak but beef chewing gum. When we complained about the food the waiter told the  cow/buffalo meat served to us was young in age ... and that's why the meat was rubbery & acted like its a regular thing at this restaurant and you have to be lucky to find a juicy loaf of beef steak. 

We thought okay we have met with some bad luck regarding food...at least their service would be good. But let me tell you one thing, local street food restaurants have better service quality than this restaurant. We had to literally call the waiter every time for taking away the dishes from the table & only after several requests we got some napkins to wipe our hands.

We thought enough is enough..let's get out of this place & asked for the bill. When I offered to pay with my credit card...the waiter astonished us once again & told us no cards are accepted here and you have to pay with cash only. So my  friends waited in the restaurant & I had to rush to ATM to withdraw cash.

While coming out of the restaurant we thought we should check out the nameplate of the restaurant whether it was really the famous Olypub or we have come to a wrong place & found out the name glowing in bright neon light "Olypub".

This is my experience with Olypub. I guess this place has reminded me of like watching a over hyped movie ... you don't know whether it is  really that great or utter bullshit until you watch it ....well in this case it was a really really bad experience. I am never coming back at this place again.

Considering my past visits here, I should simply say yum, inexpensive, rotting & matter of fact. Recently, Olypub has spruced itself up with fancy upholstery & rouge, making 'rotting' a lie & losing a part of "been there since Lord Canning" in the process. They still get the bottle & peg measure to your table & let the measure overflow. In this Christ-ly piety, they're unparalleled. Except, they are no longer generous with the overflow.

Regardless, because of its anti-capitalistic disposition towards keeping inebriation affordable, food dripping with colonial elitism & everything else that the heart yearns, Olypub stands alone.

The famous *BEEF STEAK* is a marvel with some beer. :D This is a legendary place since ages. The carefree shady ambience of the pub has always attracted people. Not much to review as ITS AMAZING.

What can be said about this place, the best old feel, pocket friendly pub in kolkata. The down point being the service and ambience, but they more than make up for their light on pocket charges of food and alcohol, making it the best place to hang out with buddies.

There is a sense of nostalgia about this place. It reminds me of a time and place when oly was all we could afford on our limited budgets. Till date, i try and make it here on every cal trip. The place has had a renovation since the last time I went. The steaks are famous, also the fish fry but above all just go for the nostalgia!

One of the Best meet up places in Kolkata with old friends, colleagues , soulmates, etc. The place is always buzzing with people & from Friday to Sunday, it remains jam packed. This is a no frills bar cum restaurant where you won't find any fancy cutlery & decor. But it will definitely light on one's pockets. You should be there to live the experience.

Food is very good. No delay in service. Great place to hangout, eat, have a few drinks and come out with a reasonable bill amount. Reach early on weekends to avoid waiting too long.¬†
Totally agree with Ashish Sharma's comment about the tipping part. lol.¬†

I am from bangalore & the place reminded me of koshys. Its cheap (an imp thing for me as I am usually backpacking) but the waiters are too insistent on tipping, especially the guy on the door. I was there on 2 consecutive days & 2nd day he said 'sir aaj bhi nahi doge kya paise'. If management is reading this, please take note.

Visited first time with couple of friends. Lot of expectations with this pub as I heard this is as a legendary place. Yes the place is great like it is at heart of the park street ambience was too much noisy but still the good factor is only the name.  I had ordered several dishes with two large antiquity blue.I ordered chicken ala keiv(the most heard dishes),beef steak( not for me),Grilled Fish and Fish Reshmi Kabab.The food quality was not very much tasty. The hotel boy's behavior was not satisfied. In fact we dint order one dish but they included it in the final bill and insisted us to take away. There was an unhealthy situation at the end of play.
Over all the experience was bad and it did not meet with my expectation with which I went there.

The only reason for 3.5 is the beef steak and a place to hangout. I went there after 3 years, the steak tasted same as before. You have to eat it before it becomes cold, otherwise you will need to fight with it. We also ordered grilled fish and chicken ala Kiev. The fish was with too much tomatoes. Ala Kiev was good but I expected better after reading so many good reviews. Also ordered fish resmi kabab, I have never had such resmi kabab before. They cover it with a thick layer of gram flower and soda. 

Drinks are quite cheap, despite the fact that the restaurant cum bar is at the heart of Park street. 

Overall a good place if you love beef steak.

A must visit for its vintage appeal.

Been there. Previously heard a lot about this place. But my experience was a bit disappointing. The staffs were not at all cooperating. We kept on calling the waiters who were standing at close proximity for more than 15 minutes.they were busy gossiping. We also wanted for more than 10 mins for just a bottle of water. After paying the bill one if the waiter literally forced one of my friend to pay him extra tips with a very rude tone.
I'm done with olypub.

Dropped in this oldy this Sunday.. 
It was my 1st time visit, after hearing a hell lot about this place, I wasn't impressed by the place.
What do I say, pocket friendly alcohol is a thumbsup though, the ambiance didn't suit me, we sat on the upper section of this pub. 
I ordered chicken ala oly...
It had two toasts served on mashed potatoes with peas, having fried chicken on it, toped with cream... It was too subtle for my taste buds.. Didn't like it much.. Waiters are bit showoff as u can see at all old over hyped places.. 
Still this place has its own fan following and charm, may not be appealing to me üòù

Olypub was once THE PLACE...where anybody can go and count on having some cheap alcohol .. some delicious beefs ..and a great time. But this is just a memory of my teenage years now. Now Olypub is just a standard place where u can still get some cheap alcohol ... but bad beefs... and shitty service. Well service was never good there , but we used to overlook it. But now, with so many good bars coming up in Kolkata...the good old Oly has lost its place.

Personal favourite since 15 years... its that place where old monk still comes for 61 rupees for a 30ml.. the serviceman will carry the bottle and peg measure to your table and pour before you your peg and will only stop once a bit of the liquor topples and spills into your glass. Each time....  every time..... 
It has toast and butter on the menu... along with boiled peas.... a great place for college crowd. Post work people.. and  anyone who likes to drink without purpose.. .dont change olypub..

This once legendary place has deteriorated a lot. The behavior of the staff is abominable! I was there with a friend recently. We sat down looking forward to a couple of drinks and the security guy made us get from the table stating the reason that as we were only two people we couldn't occupy a table for four. We were made to stand in a corner til one of the smaller tables were vacated although there were quite a few empty booths available. The chairs at the smaller tables are extremely uncomfortable and not at all suited for a pub. 

After this kind of behavior we were not in the mood to be there any longer. We left immediately. I never intend to go back there and would't recommend the place to anybody.

This place absolutely needs no Introduction.
The place is known for reasonably priced alcohol in the prime location of Park Street. Pocket friendly place is its usp along with its beef steak, Chicken Ala Kiev, Mixed Grill Platter.
The disappointing part is its ground floor corner seats, where rats keeps popping up from nowhere. Waiters are not that co-operative and courteous as well. The gurads at gate keeps asking for tip and thats kind of pissing off. But all said and done, this place will always be a favourite and preferable with friends and collegues!

A very down market place with irritating waiters and a long list of substandard food. The beef steak (the very famous) would require a butcher knife to cut it and would require another amount of considerable effort to gulp it down. It tasted more like a scrub pad than a steak. The liquor is fine, as it would be in any pub or bar down the city for, thankfully, they don't brew it themselves. Overall, it's an obnoxious environment where the waiters hang around your nose like greedy dogs expecting a good tip, while they have served you with nothing but a mouthful of arrogance and ingratitude, as it were to a freeloader. A nightmare, to be precise, for those who would like to have a good time to hang out without much fuss.

Cheap and on the money. It's a pub, Kolkata style. Located on Park street, it provides a great place to sit, drink, hang out eat good food and not worry about the bill. Apart from the usual beers, you'll get a large variety of local brands here. The food is worth a mention too with good steaks and other good that can be well washed down with some beer or whisky. Don't expect great ambience  or service, you won't get it. It's your daily drinking place. 

Taste:3.5/5
Service: 2.5/5
Cost effective: 4/5

Kudos to the crowd here - it's boisterous, demanding, and never ending.
I used to hate the service here, but it has improved lately. Drinks are really cut-rate and food is okay. Ambience of the bar is a little better than shabby. Both the bar and the restaurant is terribly average with nothing special to attract people, yet the number of regulars visiting this place is more than any other bars, any day. For me, a good hangout option when the budget is low!

Well oly pub gives me a  nostalgic feeling and that's the only reason I visit this place. The beef steak and chilli chicken is actually very tasty but the service is pathetic.. The waiters are not interested at all they would come to the table when they would feel like and half of the times they don't have stock for drinks of your choice.. If someone wants to booze at a very peaceful and soothing atmosphere then oly pub is not the place to choose. It is just a place of  nostalgia.

This place has a charm of its own nonmatter how many posh pubs u have been to. Olypub has a special flavour to it. Extremely pocket friendly and the best part is one can laze along here as long as they want. Food is nice too specialy mixed grill and chicken ala keiv. This place could do with more variety of drinks and some nice music

Again some Kolkata legacy that this place has been dragging along I guess. How would you like a place where you feel claustrophobic, you share table with completely unknown people, you get served in chipped crockery and glassware, you sit on torn sofas,  you experience well fed rats running around and If you are not careful enough, you also get to pay someone else's bill along with yours ;). It really doesn't matter how cheap the rounds are, at least for me but the cleanliness and the hygiene in a food Establishment matters a lot. It's a complete no no for me.

If its beef steak then its definetly Oly Pub. I really don't remember how many times I visited this place. Bunking colleges and going there with friends to have beer and beef steak have been done by many youths of this city like me. Reasonable cost and great staffs. A must go for all who drinks. Beef steak, chicken a la Kiev , meat mixed platter would be their must try.

You dont have to be all consious and proper like other resturants. The light is soothing. In the food I really  love the beef steak and the cocktail sausage.The chicken ala kiev is also good but not as much as it is hyped.The price is moderate. If you are not looking for classy place to eat and drink then this is the place you may want to go.

If you are a Calcutta thoroughbred, then the name Olympia Pub , aka Olypub to us on Park Street will strum a few strings of your heart. I use the word Calcutta, not Kolkata because Olypub has its legacy ageing back to Calcutta days. The most iconic and one of the oldest bars in town (now partially renovated with modern decor) , most popular for its very very reasonable prices on drinks and the legendary Beef Steak. Back from my days in high school to present, its the most reasonable place to eat and drink in Calcutta . The taste of its food is also delicious , not to mention the best Beef Steak with soy Onions and Poach and the Chilli Prawns. This place even now, does not accept cards so please carry plenty of cash if ur going in for a heavy session. Cash is the only mode of payment there . A drink and bite will merely set you back Rs.300 there which is peanuts compares to prices nowadays...So have a try...cheers

It is a heritage bar in the heart of kolkata. Famous for it's beef steak and chicken a la kiev. Though service is not that good. Food and booze is quiet reasonably priced. The only problem that is have faced is the absence of a smoking zone. One has to walk out of the establishment to have a smoke. But is a good place to hang out.

When you search for the best Beef Steak in Kolkata, it has always been Olypub.

This is a legendary bar/restaurant where you might not find very good ambience or courteous waiters. Why? Because, they make fantastic food, that goes best with Alcohol. Oh Yes! This is an old corner for all those who love drinks.

Price - 4/5 - Absolute value for Money
Food - 4/5 - Great food that goes with Alcohol (Best Beef Steak in town)
Ambience - 2/5 - This place is always hustling and most of the time, you may find yourself in the queue, when you visit this place.

Olypub is one of the few places left in Kolkata with the old world charm intact. The drinks are reasonably priced and the food is delicious, though slightly overpriced. But the winner here is ambience with all the young crowd of Kolkata chirping around, not withstanding the absence of inhouse music. The waiters work here at the leisurely pace. U can see the amalgamation of the various cultural diaspora of Kolkata at the same place. In short, a gem of a place for people who want to enjoy their evening not being extravagant.

One of the oldest pubs situated at the heart of the city. It always brings the best out of the closet. Obviously the service compared to other new pubs/bars is not the best but the quality of food and the alcohol cheap rate are the main USP. Chicken Ala Kiev & Beef Steak are just too mouthwatering. This is my 3rd visit and the only thing that they have changed is making the zone no smoking. And as always you have to wait in a queue to get the table. Its truly recommended if you are going with a group of friends.

Pub favourite for all time. Ideal place for all drinkers. All types of crowd are available here and it is only place in the locality. 

Taste here is average. I will recommend Chicken Ala Keev for this place. 2 dry ≈´pieces of chicken fully loaded with butter is enough for single person. Rest of chicken and Mutton dish tastes okay okay.

All time favourite joint for beef stake and beer, right from school days. 
Though now the interior have changed after the accident, still the feeling still remains the same. Total Nostalgia. 
Perfect place for a long time get together. 
Everyone talks only about beef stake but off the record the pork cocktail sausages are just out of the world. 
Suggestion: the service needs to be a bit more prompt, mayb there is a lack of adequate service staff. 
Overall a perfect place for friends..

Where to begin when it comes to Olypub. An authentic place for having lunch. Although all sorts of drinks are not available here but one can will not be disappointed. coming to the food...THE BEEF STEAK is legendary here. sometimes it is under cooked and for majority of the time you will be very happy when you order this food. along with it there is the chicken ala kiev which is fascinating. the mixed grill platter is also one of the famous dishes here. one thing i am not satisfied with is the service. The waiter sometimes take their own time to even when we call them. a better service would be really appreciated.

Heard a lot about this place, no matter how many quality restaurants and pubs are in this Park Street area, this place will have it's own fan following. But no doubt the ambience is below average, waiters are not all courteous, they are not commendable, don't have any proper idea what their own restaurant serves.
Chicken ala kiev is a must try if you visit this place. It tastes delicious. Apart from this we had Mutton Steak, and Chilli chicken boneless dry. Considering the overall place, one question I can ask to myself, will I come to this place again? Ans is No.

Today I decided to check out the famous beef steak of OlyPub and I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed. The beef was not fresh and of very poor quality. It was hard and chewy and can barely be called a proper steak. The peas were literally thawed and put onto the plate. The mash potato was any regularly mash potato but exceptionally dry. And the egg? Who can't fry an egg. Can't go wrong with that. Overall experience: not coming back again. Not for the steak at least.

Does Oly even need a review?
It's well known to the average park Street crowd for its beef steak, chicken a la Kiev , chicken a la olypub , liver fry etc.
Light on the pocket this is a joint best enjoyed with friends.
But there are downsides. 
If you are seating at the southwest corner table in the ground floor beware of the rats which appear out of nowhere! The management needs to do something about that immediately.
And they shouldn't have closed down the smoking area in the first floor :( .

My last visit had a small cockroach running around below my table, a half broken chair and only He-Man as the option for strong beer.
I never had complains about the food then, as well as now.
Regular orders here are Beef Steak, Chicken a la Kiev and Mixed Grill. Amazingly they have worked a lot on the interiors to my surprise. Place looks a lot tidy, nice chairs and better seating also on the 1st floor. Walls have been done.
For smokers: They have closed the smoking area near the verandah near the women's room. Sigh!

I have been here twice before and i liked there beef steak but today my experience was not great. I ordered beef steak and chicken ala kiev. Chicken ala kiev was okay but steak was not well prepared and full of onions. I had to chew it hard. the service was good but the steak disappointed me today. Nevertheless one should visit here for chiling beers.

I had a really wrong first time experience at Olypub! Like a poor one,from the glasses they serve in to the food. We ordered Antiquity blue 60ml,"the authentic beef steak",Chicken ala kiev. Okay I hated the decor,the low quality cutlery. The ala kiev tasted yuck! Beef steak was okayish a little chewy. I have had better beef! Clearly the vintage olypub was not my place to revisit.

I did not count how many times I visited Oly Pub. Since college life and our tight pocket scenario we used to chill at this old school pub. Recently the pub is renovated, they introduced new tables & chairs, the walls are decorated with quotes & other stuffs. In food, I have tried many items but my preference is always the Beef Steak with Smashed Potato, Peas & Fried Eggs for which the pub is famous for. If you visit frequently then you will notice there beer stock changes often. So be prepared, you may not get the beer you want. Rest of the  liquors like whiskey, rum, vodka are available generally. The waiters are sometimes lazy and negligent. Its a great place to hang out & chill.

Cheap booze and crazy people around you makes this place special. It's not fancy but its fun and most of the time that is what we all want.

Of course you go here for their bar. The offering is generous and reasonably priced. You get all varieties of drinks. Food is good as well. Its a nice place which will give you a country side pub feel. The bartenders are very cheerful and helpful. Be here for your booze party with the group of friends and enjoy!

Well, they provide some excellent beef steaks.! The food here is very good...tried mutton n beef steak, chicken butter masala..all were very tasty.!! The ambience is quite good; they dont have music though.!! They never have half of the beers in the menu and is restricted to certain items and that was bad. I wanted budweiser but had to settle wid Tuborg. If u can manage with that, this is the place for u..!! :)
Cheers..!

Booze at such a minimal amount is not expected in this metropolitan city's hub.....but they made it possible.....it is a hardcore bar dont expect anything more...The Chicken-A-la- kiev and BEEF steak they make is really mouth watering one of a kind in kolkata....with a hard rock of whisky takes u to paradise....Its a old bar with max. male customers....I recommend it to whose who wanna BOOZE without any tension of pocket ..... Also iDO NOT RECOMMEND to go with family....PLEASE CARRY Cash cash...they dont accept cards...

I thank the management for restoring one of the heritages in the spirit of Kolkata. Before the unfortunate fire a few months back, Oly was dying. The food quality has drastically deteriorated, the decor and ambiance appeared haunted. They have really turned it around. The interiors look really suave with the new sofas and decor. The collection of beer at stock have ¬†considerably expanded. The classic Beef Steak has improved from the all time low that it was going through.1 deducted for cutting out the smoking area(a real inconvenience) and the shitty service from the waiters, same as forever.Welcome back Olypub!!!¬†:)

Had to give this place a 5 star rating..The one and only pub in Kolkata entwined with my drunken memories, deja vu's and good times with my buddies :p This inconspicuous little pub stands out from the crowd of other posh bars and pubs in this area due to its sheer age and variety of people haunting it at diferent times. Step inside this little den of joy and catch a glimpse of tollywood celebs to schoolchildren (yes!), couples and after office habitual drinkers to connoisseurs of good steaks and beer. From the tiny smoking room at the back to the large hall downstairs this place holds a special place in my heart. Their steaks and fries are a must try along with their selection of hard and soft drinks. Recommend this place to anyone who likes good food along with good conversations. Oh Oly! ;)

Have been visiting this place for a long time. Recently this place has improved the interior decor making sitting arrangements comfortable. They have improved the stock of Beer introducing some of my favorites. The Beef Steak which had deteriorated terribly has improved a bit in standard. But the cocktail sausage and the roast chicken I ordered on my last two visit was really depressing. The smoking zone is no more available now which is another added problem.

Well I often heard olypub is the best place in town for cheap booze. Well the beef steak is the only thing that draws my attention every time I visit the pub.

I visited this place 4-5 times.
And only once I was disappointed because the steak was not cooked well and was hard to cut.
The place is weird , the ambiance I don't like 
Apart from that well its a place hangout with your friends.

Out of all these I just want the signature beef steak cooked and served me well.

Well,yesterday i went with a friend there.But i didn't pay tips,becuase to me,i am paying SERVICE TAX to olypub for the service that i got along with V.A.T.But when i was coming out,the waiters abused me and my Friend in front of many people present there.Tell me is this a way to behave with customer who should be treated like o God according to business ethics???....I would request and encourage you all not to pay tips to these helpers and encourage fair business between a customer and a seller/businessman...Thank You...

Steak is the only thing that draws my attension everytime I visit this pub. Boozers love the place for the low rated alcohol and some of my friends prefer club like ambiance and hence love this place. However I don't prefer this type of surrounding with ample light and crowd shouting at top of their voice.
But the steak..specially the mutton..simply yum. I tried dry chilli chicken and once fish fry. All tasted fine but nothing like steak. Kudos to the low price they maintain at such posh area like Park Street.

One of the oldest places in parkstreet as well as in kolkata. Going to oly is like going to an instituition. Dont expect a 5* star ambience or some mindblowing decor.. This is simple place which serves very good finger food and booze.

I tried the crispy chili babycorns here, the meat platter , the ala kiev and also their famous beef steak. 
 i have been going to oly for about 5 yrs now and in the 5yrs the quality of the beef steak has fallen..from outstanding it went down to just ok. But definitely worth a try ..

Never the less i love this place. I want to give it a 4+ but with all the new up and coming pubs and bars in kolkata and with the food and varities of drinks they are offering, givibg a 4+ would be an injustice..

Olypub is one of the places in Kolkata where you don't go for the food but for the feel of the place. Cheap booze and the pub atmosphere is the chief attraction. But for the foodies, I'd recommend the steak and the roost chicken. The grilled menu is worth a glance too.

Their delivery of booze is quite transparent as they pour the drinks before you unlike many other pubs. Must have are Beef stake(medium rare) & Chiken la Kiev.

'Olympus has fallen'.. the movie couldn't have been titled more aptly. Olympus Pub or more popularly Olypub is one such fallen angel from Kolkata. Once what used to be the most apt place for a social milieu, awesome food and dirt cheap booze, is now (and most recently) a refurbished, redone and modern rendition of the pub. The AC must have gotten efficient, but the service is still slow, the food overpriced and the portions small. Once can't really complain about the booze, as the government is to blame for the soaring prices :P¬†

Coming to the positives, I best like Olypub for the kind of crowd that it attracts and the conversations that flow across the floor. The booze is served and measured in a peg-measuring thingy right in front of you (unlike many a phony pubs). In terms of food, the beef steak (served rare, medium & well done) still stays a favourite and so does the complementary quarter plate of 'namkeen' (chanachur). Not to forget, the unexpected friend that you might end up making, after a few pegs of booze and a great conversation over a smoke.

Oly Pub does well in what they are really proficient at: beef steak. This is the best beef steak I have had from India. The meat is tender, juicy and comes with an omelette topping which adds a creamy texture to it. So order your beer and a steak and spend an idle afternoon in this restaurant of other worldly charm.

A pub in Calcutta? Yes, Olypub it is. It has its own charm, though mostly renovated now with new facades. It has its own tradition - the bar tender will serve your peg from a 750ml bottle at your table and the liquor will just spill over the measurer - every time, every peg. That's Olypub! Its cheap alcohol and lip smacking food. The grills are the best including Beef Chateau, Mixed Grill, Cocktail Sausage. You can give the Chicken a-la-kiev a try as well. Only cash payments are accepted.

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! Service is horrible, food is horrible, the servers act as if they are the lords of the restaurant and we are eating at their expense. Snobbish, arrogant and super RUDE servers. Sometimes they even ignore when you call for them and sometimes they ask us to wait and don't show up. We waited for a very long time to be seated and then when we finally got our seats it was beside a heap of garbage. Visit this place only if you want your weekend to be spoiled.

happens to be one of the oldest pub in the locality with very reasonable pricing, a stand-up hangout for long relaxing session with friends. One speciality of this place apart from their food is drinks being poured right in front of you from respective bottles in proper peg measures.
While people rave about the beef steak here ) which is one iconic platter of itself)  it should be noted that their spread of chicken & continental dishes are equally delicious, beef steak, Chicken A La Kiev, Chicken A La Olypub & Mixed Grill are hardly to be missed with each of of them capable of making you go crazy. 
Hygiene is not a priority here & so is the decor or ambiance (though the first floor has been renovated recently which has raised their score when compared to the usual ambiance & decor normally been offered) if you got a tight pocket yet you're looking for good food &  cheap drinks, OLYpub is the place, a different proposition all together.

Only downside is they don't accept card!!!

All Calcuttans have good memories about this place, be it sneaking out of school and having your first beer or having tons of alcohol at a friends treat.
Shabby old place, more like your college rooms with shaky chairs, filled with people chatting away over drinks at their hearts will.
Coming to F&B,  I have never liked the food at Oly and always dreamt of Peter Cat's steak even while having a steak at Oly.
For starters, let me tell you its typical of Oly that the server will come and pour your drink from the bottle,which I feel is mostly diluted.
However, all can be forgiven given the good vibes the place gives out.

Olypub just lets you be. Chill, order your cheap booze, laugh loudly, yell. 
The staff does not give two shits to you. They come, serve fast and go away. 
And Olypub always has a crowd waiting outside to quench their thirst though twice the bar did not have beer left to serve. 

Bonus: toilets are clean.

When you crave for meat in Kolkata you can't miss out Olypub in Park Street. The beef steak is the best here, alongwith chicken preparations like Chicken Ala Kiev and Chicken Olypub. The continental platters are more preferable here for meals.
This place has one of the cheapest bars in Kolkata and there is always enough drinks for enough money. Though I'd personally recommend that one should come here with friends or partners for quality food and drinks at affordable rates. The overall ambience is good and safe.

The 2 things that come to a person's mind when he hears the words 'Oly Pub' are beef steak and drinks. If you don't spare much thought about the ambience, and just want to spend a great time with your friends having lip-snacking meals or drinking your way to glory, then this is the perfect place.  Though the top floor has been renovated, it still manages to grab a rating between 4-5/10. Though the top floor looks more like a pub, the ground floor still looks like  a coffee shop, only, without the coffee and with the alcohol. However, barring all that, the food is to die for here. For every connoisseur, the beef steak is always the first choice, so those who are going for the first time, do try it. Its quite the experience. The other options are chicken a-la-kiev and chicken a-la-oly pub. Both are great, but somewhat similar. I tried the mutton steak there, and I thought it to be a bit too crunchy and too sweet. Having drinks at Oly Pub is somewhat like a tradition in Kolkata. A genie in the bottle is that everything is surprisingly affordable, given that the restaurant's location is in the prime part of Park Street. I would suggest everyone who read this exceptionally long review to go there, not once, but as much as you can. Because it has always been a great experience

165 for a beer at a place with an awesome ambience like this that too at park street ? I'm always game . But yes when you talk abt food , being a vegetarian i feel i wasted 300rs on that not so good paneer tikka and ridiculous chilly paneer order . The next drawback - limited choice of beer . I mean only two out of the beer list were available . So if they remain stocked up with beer i might never say no to an OLYPUB plan .

It is slightly difficult to fall in love with legendary Oly pub if one begins to go there at an advance age beyond one's student, college and early work life. It is like going to Maddox square at the age of 25 for the first time.

Oly Pub mostly rates high on nostalgia and associated memory of youthful friendship and good times. If you have neither ( like me), you are left with pretty average food, cheap booze and a dingy place with bad washrooms. Of course the beef steak is good, but often the blunt steak knives make u wonder if u should have carried your own cutlery set.

So basically if you are like me, then go to Oly Pub with a friend who loves Oly Pub and has grown up there and go with a pretty low expectation threshold as well. It can be quite a let down otherwise in the company of others who are as new as you.

Rude waiters - check 
Worst crowd - check 
Limited stock - check 
Waiters not caring about customer satisfaction - check 
Inquisitive corny people who would hit on you if you are a girl - check 

Folks, if you want to spend a good date evening, do not go to this place, the crowd here would often get drunk and publicly do disgusting stuffs. Often the drunk guys disturbs ladies sitting in other tables and the waiters won't try to defend you. Your phone network won't work so you won't be able to call someone either 
Moreover the collection of beer and stock is very low, you'll find only one variant available 
Thus, it's good if you are in a big group, not so good if you have ladies with you

Forget the ambiance. It is neat and clean and that is all.
For guys who drink, this place serves drinks at a rate cheaper than many other places, certainly cheaper than most other places on Park Street.
The type of continental food you get here is really cheap, given the price of similar stuff at other places.
I recommend ---
# Beef steak (of course, if you have had it in places like Mocambo or tenderloin at Chili's, this is no place to try your luck)
# Chicken A la Kiev (But there is going to be too much cheese in it. If you love cheese, you will love this)
# Fried sausages (Maybe oily buy very tasty)

The name OlyPUB is a misnomer. It is more of a restaurant. There's no music, no service. Oly is still the best place for amazing beef steaks and cheap drinks. The quintessential Oly waiters are part of the deal though.

This place isn't for food. None of its food items fare above mediocrity. This place is for people who want to have a nice time and cheep booze. You can sit here for long and the waiters won't bother you  .

Olympia pub for the genex and simply olypub for us, this place simply deserves the legendary status it holds today. Although it doesn't offer much in the ambiance section, the good food and booze does make up for it. The beef steak is the one to look out for. Treat yourself with their steak platter along with the poison of your choice. Pocket pinch is not high, and it is better to visit in a group to have the most fun. Highly recommended!

Another one of those legendary old-school places in Kolkata. 

Located on the busy Park Street, this bar is famous for its amazing Chicken a la Kiev, Mutton Cutlets, Mini Mutton and Chicken Patties; that come as six pieces per portion and of course, their almost MRP priced alcohol.

Tried for the third time to enter this so called legendary place. Came home empty stomach. Apparently they don't allow anyone under 21. Sadly all my friends visit the place from years back. If restricted entry is followed, it should be similar for all customers. Some people have the disadvantage of looking younger than they are. Sadly this kind of unforseen actions destroy plans for a lovely day.

This used to be our college hangout. Apart from the reasonably priced booze I remember one incident. Our gang of 4 girls from college had gone there to have a quick meal and chat. But, we were told rather rudely to leave the premises as they did not allow only girls to be there. I have not been there since but it does bring back good memories, especially the smoke filled rooms. I hear that has cleared up now.¬†

Food recommendations: Beef Steak!

Simple and well maintained, this restaurant / pub is a warm homely place and offers good food (beef steaks, A la kievs, fried prawns etc,) at an affordable price and pretty cheap drinks. The only downside was the waiters and the guard at the door asking for tips beyond what was given to them (50/- for the waiter).

Olypub.....right at the heart of Park Street,Kolkata. This place needs no introduction to any Kolkatan or fellow foodie. Nothing to mention about the ambience... its too ordinary. But when it comes to hangout with friends and colleagues this place is always on top of my mind. Food is too good.

But one thing needs special mention...is Beef Stake. The best beef stake in town. 
So just go out and have it. And thank God ...for the sexiest beef stake u had.

First i start... Its a pub where the heart of kolkata lies... Next is mocambo reviweing it later.... I have been to this friend with one of my office colleagues... During my 8months stay at Kolkata.. Currently I m in Delhi for gate preparations... One of my primary reason to miss Kolkata boz of this place... Firstly we smoked a joint @maidan ...and entered to this place to HV a terrific booze... Me n my friend ordered 8bottles of carlsberg super strong beer and I didn't knew it was a place for beef/mutton steak .. So I skipped it.. We ordered mutton cutlet 1plate which was CHURANTO üòç.. after that mutton Sikh roll something 10 -12 rolls in one plate we both ate it all
. it was yummy though... Then we ordered 2 plates chicken biryani...after that booze that had occurred a while ago has vanished suddenly.Finally one plate of chillyfish and half bottle of royal stag whiskey.... Wow.. Even I didn't get any stomach ache next day.. Food is clean, but choice is urs to make the proper selection. Our combined bill was 1800though which is relatively cheap ...I will b visiting this place once I get settled in KOLKATA.M I hope üòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòá

I didn't find it as awesome as people generally say... Only a few specific food items like Chicken Olypub and Chicken ala Kiev are good. The chilli prawn I ordered seemed like someone had added a bucket of salt to it.The waiters are pretty rude. They didn't serve me alcohol as I wasn't carrying an id with me and apparently I looked like I wasn't of age. So I asked them what non-alcoholic drinks they serve but they weren't even listening to what I was saying after that and kept saying "Why are you still sitting here? We can't serve you anything!" I literally had to shout out that I just wanted pineapple juice!PS: The pineapple juice tasted like puke...

This pujo(shoshthi), it was again olypub time for us.
Friends, fun, frolic, beer, beef, etc sums it up.
We feared that due to the tremendous pressure of public gathering Olypub would face difficulty managing such a huge crowd. But to my amazement we had to wait for like 15 minutes that too at 8:45pm and voila!
We ordered as usual: Beef Steak, Chicken A La Kiev, Mutton Steak.
We asked for Budweiser but they didn't have any. So we settled down for tuborg light. Bleh, such bad taste.
Anyway. Overall it was fun. And that beef, yummm!

Variety of beers is low 
Waiters are crazy

Cheap booze(especially if you want to compare it with its Park Street counter parts)

So I finally went to Olypub, I guess it should have been sooner than now but better late than never.
So the decor is every bit nostalgia, much like you would see it in older Bengali films but isn't shabby at all. It is rather welcoming from the time you enter. The people inside were from all age groups and included loners to groups.
Now I had a Carlsberg lager and a Beef Steak. The food was good and the beer chilled. However coming back from Rajasthan (one does not get Budweisers there) I desperately wanted to have a Budweiser magnum which they didn't have. Neither was Miller or Carlsberg Elephant on offer.
Being in Park Street and the attractive pricing that this place has to offer, is a must visit for any meat lover. I see myself visiting here often in the near and distant future.

The name should be mentioned in museums & the place should be declared as 'heritage'! Not because of food n drinks but coz of the nostalgia it has! 

But considering the present status it's severely over hyped and over priced ! There are lot many pubs,bars in the city who serve  good food n drinks with a peaceful ambience! Well if u need the typical oly ambience, having a beer amidst Manicktala Fish market will make u feel the same!  
The service n behavior of waiters is pathetic like the food they serve! 
So,if u wanna have a drink n hangout without spending a lot, there are many others places!  
Let Oly RIP

One of the worst service I've seen; and the attitude of the waiters were pathetic. These people don't even have the decency or knowledge as in how to talk to a customer. The only good thing about this place was cheap booze and chicken ala kiev (for which I'm giving it a 1.5). The ambiance is alright and the interiors are so-so, but as I mention the attitude of the people working there needs to change.

A kinda place where u can sit alone, Read a book, clear your thoughts and relax over a chilled beer. The old nostalgic feel and decor of the place brings back the charm of the by gone era. I was in Kolkata for a couple of days and killing my time in the evening on the park street. Walked past this place and then decided to give it a shot impromptu. I sat down and read through the menu. Was surprised to see that everything was so reasonably priced. I ordered a 2 Heinekens and got served a complimentary namkeen mixture with it, which was very good. Enjoyed the cold beers thoroughly. The guy waiting on me was a funny old fellow who doesn't give a ........! And runs things at his own pace. I ordered a chicken a la Kiev and by god, it was very good, not too dry and tasted great. The old waiter audaciously keeps standing next to Ur table untill u pay him a tip which is really funny. Lol

Olypub one of the oldest restaurants in the city. It looks like Indian Coffee House (College St.) type ambience. The alcohol compares is really cheap at ground floor to 1st floor. The main thing is that Olypub is a pocket friendly place for those who love alcohol at a cheaper rate at Park Street. The service was ok and could have been better.  The food taste was not so bad. I was there with my friends for only chat section, not drink. Hope next time I will take more dishes.

Olypub has revamped its interiors and the upstair ac section has been upgraded in looks and seating arrangement.It was our first stop for the day and we were in for a quick bite.So the order was very drab.Chicken ala kiev with wine.For those uninitiated,Ala kiev is a bliss of chcken and butter in a divine concoction.It‚Äôs like a non veg cornetto,pleasing and surprising you with every bite.Two such very healthy pieces,with peas and mushed potatoes are served at incredibly low prices.the wine simply piques your interest.If you still haven‚Äôt,please pop your ala kiev cherry at your first opportunity.
The one big disappointment was the shady waiter.He brazenly asked for tips,and even before I had brought out my wad of notes.Before that,he served a handwritten bill,where obviously there were no clear illustration of the tax and service charges.he simply wrote the bill amount on a parchment.I should have insisted on a printed bill,but I didn‚Äôt,and on perusal later,I found we had been charged 13% for vat and service charge.That meant¬† although we had to pay a few bucks less,in all probability,he simply pocketed the entire amount and didn‚Äôt enter our details into the computer.

This place is known for its cheap alcohol. 
My experience of this place was definitely not good and certainly much below my expectations. 
Let's start with the ambience. Well it could still pass off as okayish. 
The drinks came for umm cheap. But the food definitely was not worth the price. I had heard a lot about the beef steak and hence we ordered one along with the chicken hambhrger steak. It was nothing OTT and I did not really understand the fuss about it. 
Let's come to the service. The waiters were very quirky. We saw them enter into a brawl with two customers and seeing that a whole group of youngsters just walked out of the bar. 
Hence Oly was not exactly a very pleasurable experience.

Once a frequent Oly Pub goer. But with time everything changes so does Oly pub. The beer is still a bit pricey and often met with the statement that the beer I asked for is not available. and specialy after renovation they don't entertain lone drinkers. phwww

I had been to Oly several times, the last time it was with my office colleagues on a weekend early evening. Though this is one of the nicest watering holes in the city we restricted ourselves ¬†tried and restricted ourselves to chicken steak and ala kiev, one of my friends took a peg of vat69 but we felt it was too early in the evening to booze. But if you are in park street you should surely try this place out for booze and steaks. The food was nice if not amazing, and you can surely have it for their pocket friendly prices.

The oldest bar in the park street area never fails to amaze me. It's almost always full not because of it's great food but for the cheap booze. The food is not bad though. The beef steak absolutely rocks. The service is alright. What the place probably needs is a bit of renovation.

Being a regular in this area during my college days, this has naturally been a favourite. One of the cheapest bars in the area, you would want to go here ofr the vintage experience and the old world charm. There is unlimited free chanachur, along with of course the Beef Steak and the dry chili chicken which I love so much. If you haven't visited this place yet, you sir are missing out!

Finally a review for the place which is better known for the famous beef steak ... almost every table ordered Chateau briand ... commonly known as beef steak ... alcohol is really cheap over here .. the funny side is dat all of the menu priced rs 5 more in the first floor compared to the ground floor.... 60 ml drink is really at a very curbed rate ...we asked for chateau briand , mixed grill platter ... breezer , magic moments vodka , signature rare whiskey .... my aim was to taste the beef steak only as I have heard about it a lot ... itz good ...but too hard ...I dnt knw y ...mixed grill was fabulous ... a proper balanced dish with moderate spicy level... it cosists of chicken , pork sausage , bacon , ham nd frankfurter ...we enjoyed the dish ... but the staff courtesy is not so impressive ... the were reluctant ... often forgets to take order ... but considering all ... olypub is a pocket friendly place for those who gives more priority to alcohol rather than the food .. hope to visit soon to try chicken a la olypub ... mutton steak

Well here's my experience which I had at this place when I visited once again after a long time. This arguably is the cheapest pub on Park Street, I say this with a popular vote.

The ala kiev, which looked dwarf to what they used to serve, almost arrived before the beer and its trademark snack. Then came the plates minus tissue papers but thankfully with fork and knife. Yes, the quality of the food and the service has deteriorated but who cares when all you care about is your drink.

The same old brands and in same old glasses, bring back a lot of college days memories. The place has not grown up a day. Not to mention the eccentricity of the waiters and their usual denial of your existence after you've ordered your drink.

But still the relentless chatter, the restlessness of the waiters and the taste of the beer after a hard day's work, these are all you can experience when you visit olypub. Cheers mate...

Ch√¢teau Briand and beer is the star combination for people looking to booze cheap and plenty. Being one of the oldest pub in town it has very little to offer when it pours down to management. It's a nice place to be with friends and Chicken ala keiv is a must to melt down the rough edges. It's been long since I have visited the place, the footfall at this place will leave you amazed. ;)

Drinks are cheap compared to other park street resto cum bars. We ordered the traditional #chicken ala keiv with two bottles of budweisers and loads of chit chats. I love to visit this place again and again. A must visit.

Visited Olypub after a long time and was pleasantly surprised to see the place redecorated. A bunch of us invaded a table with plans of a few hours of fun, drinks and pure gossip ahead of us.
We ordered fish finger, chicken seekh kabab and fried prawns to go with our drinks. Though the quantity of the food was good but the quality was just about average. And just when we were about to order another plate, there comes the waiter bearing our bill without even us asking for making the bill! Uttterly insulting as it was, I was not surprised as Olypub was never known for having courteous waiters.
Finally we left with full yet dissatisfied tummy, a slightly bruised ego but memories of a good time thanks to my friends.

Let me tell you why is it special to be at oly, anytime.Ambience, Service, Aura. Not the food, The mirrors, The lights, The people.There is this one thing about Oly , when people visit, they know how to behave. On the cheaper side when it comes to drinks, Oly in short is a legendary pub. And heck yeah , it beats the shit out of every other bar in the same area. Ask a connoisseur about Oly and s/he will give the best review ever.I ask every followers on my list, who havent given Oly a try , to give it a try. Its unlike any other place. Trust me.

One of the legendary places of Park Street, Olypub is the go-to place for cheap alcoholic beverages. Earlier, they didn't ask for any ID cards as age proof. But from recent times, probably they are, as my female friends were barred from drinking as they'd forgotten to bring their ID cards. The waiters were in fact quite strict. Overall experience wasn't that good. 
But as they say, if you visit Park Street, Olypub is a must, at least once.

Booze in kolkata and olypub is almost synonymous. This famous bar in park street area is on is wean after opening  of newer outlets with better ambience. But there is something unique about olypup. Be u a lone girl or a ladies only group or a gang of college goers even senior citizen...it welcomes all and everyone is comfortable. Beef steak and grilled fish worth a mention though. So is chicken a la Kiev.

Being located on the food Haven of Kolkata - Park Street, you will expect it to be lavish. But no, this is an old fashioned pub, which still serves liquor at very reasonable rates and some really nice starters to choose from. That's the reason you will always find this place crowded.

Now here is a place that I will visit every time¬†I visit India. Whenever I am in Kolkata, some friends and I go there, order steaks, drinks, bangers & mash, etc and reminisce for hours. I would take the inexpensive and crowded¬†Olypub any day¬†over some of the overpriced, overhyped and overbooked¬†restaurants on that road. But if you are looking for fine dining and class, stay away. If with old like minded friends, its a must go. However, must admit that the food is not as good as I remember from years ago. Food 3/5, Service 3.5/5, Price 4/5, Ambience 3/5 (I expect and like the chaos here. Adds to the character), Location 4.5/5

The food was served quite late and was not even hot .The only thing that touched my heart is chicken a la kiev :* ¬†beef steak was good , tasty , could have served hotter , slow service really frustrated us and don't feel like going again.

I had heard a lot before going here.Then I got chance twice to visit this place.

I am not sure about the chaotic atmosphere of ground floor as I never entered there,but first floor is ok for women to seat and have a drink and chitchat.

Now come into the drinks and food.Drinks are as per brand and seems cheap if I compare with some other bar in Park street area.But food was not as expected.Chilli chicken was not more than ok and mixed grill was just not good..

All over, you can visit here for drinks and that too in cheaper rate.

Well, what to say? When one speaks of affordable drinking in Kolkata, Olypub comes to mind. Well, everyone has different views on that, but I would say that if you are willing to compromise a bit on the quality of service (downright rude waiters and long waiting period) and are OK with a limited selection of drinks, this is the place. The prices have gone up significantly since when I first went to this place, but they still remain within reach for college students. The place is best for beer( though I sometimes order vodka or whisky-soda) and it keeps a limited selection of every spirit, though it appears otherwise on the menu. Food is so-so and the so-called legendary Beef Steak is oily and overcooked. The Chicken a la Kiev is delicious though and the mixed grill platter is alright. On Saturdays and Sundays though, one has to wait a long time before getting a seat and unless you get a seat upstairs, the seating is dim, crowded and noisy.

What a place!!! ( satire). The first thing that shocked me entering this place is the seating arrangements. Torn,half- broken chairs in a dim light and people screaming. A staff came and said to go upstairs as the ambience was not perfect for women. This was still tolerable. Then we ordered chili chicken dry and black dog. The first comment," madam, we donot have black dog. Can i provide some whisky?" Really?? A bar cum restaurant in park street and no black dog? Okay still tolerable. We ordered signature but knock! knock! No signature. At last settled for blenders pride.

What crossed tolerance limit is the quality of glasses. A typical disgusting smell came from the glasses and they were dirty. Unhygienic!! I told them to change them. The next set of glasses that came were again dirty but a little less.

What crossed my tolerance limit is the chili chicken. The item was not properly made. It was somewhat not cooked properly and so a smell was coming.

So, overall a horrible experience. Over-priced,over-hyped, terrible ambience for women, not-so-trained staff defines olypup.

Going down the Drain !! This was once a great place to have your drinks and really cheap too. Todays its a dark shadow of its legendary past and its staff and Management is probably the only reason for this. Looks like the famous unions of Kolkata are overactive here too. The result of which is you have to scout for your own table or wait for customers to get up and then you rush to that table. Then you have to call and plead for a waiter to come and take your order. Sometimes you and your friends will be served by 2 different waiters if you happen to be stting beside each other on seperate sqaure table stuck to each other.Waiters are rude and may even tell you to order everything all at once(they are so busy) Drinks today are not much cheaper too . Some Continental dishes are its signature like chkn Alakiev and beef steak..but you can give it a skip rather than spoil your evening !!

One of the oldest n most popular pubs of kolkata, you go there for the cheap booze n the feel that you get only in oly..inspite of the not so friendly staff and the not so impressive ambience. Beef steak is over-hyped really. But mixed grill platter n chicken a la kiev are quite good. Oly has a unique charm that has been drawing generations of calcuttans n will continue to do so for a very long time to come..

Certainly, a lost charm!! Certainly not a pub as one would think. A bar that has been almost devoured but the ruins still are okay to visit if you're just in the mood to sit and drink, that's it.

Beef steak was there. Good enough!! Not that crazy tasting as I had imagined. I have definitely had better. Again, I had visited during my school days and things were more "bar-ry" then. Ever since that "smoked down" incident here, there's no smoking in every nook and corner of the bar. Prices of beer could have been cheaper considering it's Oly, but it's okay.¬†

Ambience has changed dude!! There are way better places to frequent in Kolkata than Oly now. It's just the nostalgia that will hold you to this place. No X factor. Everything's disappeared from this Park Street landmark.¬†

Proper advertising is required, I guess, with some sort of catch to enliven this place.

Olypub is quite well known in Park Street area and easily locatable. Once you go in a little crowded sitting arrangement can trouble you but it is well spaced for feeling convenient enough.
Had been there once couple of weeks back with 3 of my friends. Ambiance is somehow okay and not even close to disturbing. Food is nice and decently priced and booze is cheap enough too. 
This can be one of the places that you can visit on a regular basis with friends if you happen to live in Kolkata. Staff is efficient enough to handle a full house without disappointing any of the customers. Overall a nice choice for any evening.

Yup. Surely, the alcohol is cheap. Food was okayish. Definitely not a family place though. The staff's old but wise. Slow but cheery. But a faint unwanted moist stench made the visit a bit uncomfortable which persisted. A bit of maintainance of the furniture and some nice music could make the place a jolly ol' pub which everyone would like.

Well yes, the place serves cheap alcohol and food that you have to be really drunk to be able to swallow. But that's not what the problem with Olypub is. It grinds my gears when my alcohol is not served in the proper glass. But, even when I force myself to ignore that, I ABSOLUTELY DETEST their "we don't serve alcohol to women if they come alone" policy.

Oly is the Craddle for lots of Booze lovers in kolkata...i doubt there will be very few one in this city who has not heard about or rather visited Oly atleast once..
With time,many pubs hav mushroomed in kolkata with much better ambience & much better cellar,but still Oly holds it old school Charm..
Though recently the renovation has made the place mch more comfy..
Coming to Food, the place offers a wide range of Finger foods. But WORTH mentioning is their Beaf Steak- A HOT FAV among many.Its A Signature dish of Oly..i have tasted it couple of times & except once every time it was quiet succulent and had d right quantity of spices.
Though they dont offer a varied options in Alcohol,but still their collection is quiet decent..
Most of their staffs have been working their for ages,and r quiet well manared.
Recently they have improved the interior decor. Actually Oly is a place,where everyone gets quiet High,even if he/she is not planning to ;)
The name itself brings back to me, lots of nostalgic memories of countless booze sessions out there wid innumerable friends.
For all those who love to drink this place is a MUST visit,atleast once..

Olypub: the name itself brings a lot of memories to any college goers who did their graduation and higher studies in Kolkata.. It is famous for their cheap liquors, and by cheap it actually means cheap! I love their chicken ala Kiev, beef steak, dry chilli chicken.. Particularly at this price chicken ala Kiev is the best!! I have only one complain about this place right now, is that, they closed their smoking way and now you have to go outside if you a smoke!! Otherwise pretty much nothing has changed! And few places should never change too :)

Olypub has always been a symbol of the Old Calcutta charm. This legendary pub which once defined Bangali Adda over beer and steak has been gradually deteriorating in quality and service over the years. Olypub was once a place we HAD to go once a week for the cheaply priced booze and the lip-smacking food. Good Old Days! 

I visited Olypub the first time after they renovated and modernised the place. The interiors are now amazing! The decor is nice but the service still lousy. Tried my usual favourites - Cocktail Sausages, Chicken A la Olypub and Chicken A la Kiev and had a couple of Beers to wash it down with. I found the quality of the food surprisingly much better than my last visit - But still not as delicious it used to be once upon a time & the quantity isn't as good as it used to be either. 

Olypub, in my verdict is still the most popular watering hole in the city and is a Must Try for anyone looking for fairly priced alcohol and good food. But for regulars or others who have witnessed the old charm of Olypub, it's still not upto the mark.

Bad experience for first time. Next time I will avoid Sundays. It was overcrowded. Whisky served in a beer glass, as they have shortage of whiskey glasses. WTF. I never saw sausage like that, it was too small, one of my friends called it lamb testicle. Lol..ambiance was noisy like chicken nest..hope for good experience next time...

Earlier it was a place where Kolkata's intellectual cream used to meet, now it is on every youngster's checklist. Visiting this place is apparently the ultimate pass to adulthood. The alcohol is fairly priced; in fact cheaper than most of the other places on Park Street. The food to go with it is to die for. Their beef steak, mixed grill and chicken a-la-kiev are stunners in their own right. If you are going on  a weekend evening beware the crowds. Bon apetit

Yesterday went to oly after long time. The interior has changed a bit. But the sad thing is that the quantity of food has decreased. The quality and taste remains same. My favorite is mixed grill n ala kiev. But the best part is the ambience. It's a good retreat to nostalgia.

Good ol' Olypub! If it there was a fire and I could save just one restaurant/pub, guess which one I'd pick! I love the familiar smell and the chattering of voices that usher you in as you climb up those rickety stairs, at the end of which you find a place, like no other, holding high on it's own, without a care in the world about all the Tantras and the Somplaces Elses. I love it for it's Chicken A' la Kiev, its cheap beers and the cheesy waiters! Oh, and the doorman too!

Oly pub is a great place to hangout with your best buddies and not so best buddies.  Basically this place is a cool hangout place and you can have fun without thinking about your pocket. It serves wine and dine both(veg/non veg).Location is almost at the heart of the city of joy. Park Street area is also happy to have them over there as it makes park street a better hangout place. Ground floor is not up to the mark as per ambience whereas 1st floor is pretty good and AC makes 1st floor a cooler place than ground floor. My  personal favourite is beef steak and chicken bhuna.

The Legendary Olypub is known for Beef Steak which is indeed very delicious and also know for reasonably priced alcohol. Right. Selling Fake beers would definitely be cheap wouldn't it ? Me and my mates ordered for 2 Budweiser which didn't taste anything like it and on reading the label it got very clear that it was probably manufactured in a slum with someone in a cyber cafe printing the Labels.(check out the picture attached) The staff got mad at us because we wanted them to change it. On informing them that it doesn't taste anything like Budweiser, the waiter puts on a sarcasm tone and says "It was made in my house that's why it tastes different" Thats probably the worst customer service I have faced in life.

Olypub has been and continues to be an iconic venue on Park Street where reasonably priced alcohol and the celebrated 'Chateubriand Steak' (which is a steak cooked with a thick cut from the tenderloin) appear to be the reason for the high demand. The quality of food has dropped considerably over the years, however it is still difficult to get a table without waiting. Although there has been a total makeover with respect to the interiors, the service is incompetent and bearers appear to be constantly attempting to hurry the order to enable the table to get vacated for the next waiting customer. Due to the high demand for the Chateaubrian Steak, these are churned out in large numbers from the kitchen resulting in a situation where at most times the meat remains uncooked to a certain extent. The bearers no longer ask if you would like it rare, medium or well done and  it is usually served very well done which makes it difficult to cut and eat. My recent visit with a group of friends wih whom we have been visiting for more than fifteen years, was a disappointment, but the saving grace was the nostalgia and memory associated with this place. A few dishes like the fried chicken liver are worth a mention and the mutton cutlet is best not ordered. Overall, whilst Olypub will always remain a favourite with most people because of the emotional connect and pricing, one may need to choose other places due to the aspects of quality and service.

Even if you arent very frequent on alcohol ,you can't miss going to Olypub! One of the oldest pubs in kolkata in the park street area,oly is not only popular for being the cheapest places for alcohol servings but also famous for its Beef Steak , Chicken a La Kiev .i have loved both immensely however on one occasion I did find the beef to be tad bit undercooked!! This pub is not among the most attractive ones but if u have a couple of hundred bucks- you are good to go!! There is an upper and lower lobby. It has a smoking area for the smokers too..
On the downside due to the "over" popularity of Oly as I call it , this place is "over" crowded on the weekends. Lord have mercy on you if you drop by on one of those hot sultry evenings when the AC is out of service. The waiters do become very slow with their orders. You could end up in a que waiting for seats to empty. If u wana go to some place quiet , this is one place you do NOT want to go because its anything but quiet! You will love Oly if you love Booze!! ;) Cheers!!! :D

I only visit this place for their steak. The steak is yummy. I am not a big beef fan  but I am a foodie who loves the signature steak of olypub. But there is one thing which troubles me every time I eat their steak i.e the steak is very hard to cut. Is it their fault or I am high I have to find out next time. Previously very few women used to visit this place but now the crowd is well balanced üòÄüòÄ. This place smells weird all the time. The staffs and service are very average.The smoking zone is pathetic but occasional drama/fight is very entertaining which maintains the charm of this place.üçªüçªüçª

It is called a legendary pub for a reason. A place with an old time charm, Oly has been given a new look after the recent revamping. It would be fair to call It our usual hang out spot at Park Street. The Chicken √° la Kiev is a beautiful preparation, although a tad too greasy, which goes brilliantly with beer. The complementary "Chanachur" which arrives without being asked for is another attraction. The waiters are quirky as over, and playing them is a task, no less enjoyable. Of late, their beer collection has been getting poorer. If they can sort that out, there can't possibly be any complaints against Oly.

Before the giant food revolution took place in Kolkata, and before all the fancy restaurants opened up, Oly Pub was the only place to hit up for a kickass Beef Steak! I have been visiting this place since forever for its brilliant continental food and their alcohol with amazingly cheap rates. The Beef Steak, the Chicken A La Kiev and the Mixed Grill Platter are the best dishes here and you must try them.¬†
The ambience of the place is nothing great but has its own charm as it is always very loud and buzzing-typical of the Kolkata adda culture! So the next time you're in a mood for the Beef Steak do head out for good old Oly pub and you wont be disappointed.

Olypub has been a watering hole for tipplers in Kolkata for generations..It has become a heritage spot,something connected with the character and the sentiment of this city..But one word of cauiton: if you are looking for some fancy outlet,flashy decors this may not be an ideal hotspot for you..Characterized by the grotesque interiors,cheap glasses,old world wooden decors,rumbling amongst the waiters is what define this place..Cheap booze,good old steak,hours of long converstaions with your friends serves as the USP of this place..This place serves as a true bridge between tipplers of past and present generation..Having said so this place do need a facelift..U just can't live on your past reputation and exploit the people's sentiments..First of all this place has big Hygeine issue..Don't be surprised if you finds the occasional rodents moving past your tables..Also the waiters may not be the most well-behaved ones and the quality of food has deteriorated in recent times..Still if you love this place and wants loads of economic alcohols served,nothing can beat you from loving and re-visiting this joint,its the smell,the character of this place that lives on..Highly recommended dishes are Fish Fingers, Beef Steak,Mixed Grill, Chicken A-La-Kiev and Roast Chicken..

Drinks ate pretty regular ones, the premium brands are not available. But once you enter the place the time stops and flow.

Amazing place for hanging out with your friends. Alcohol available at pocket-friendly prices. The side dishes compliment the alcohol, mutton seekh kebab being a standout of them all. The unavailability of red wine is a bit of a disappointment. The ambience with low-lighting and comfortable seating arrangements provides a perfect utopia for hanging out.

Good hangout place for young people and cheapest booze at park street!

 If you want to have lots of booze and have fun with your friends group then this is the best place at park street. Olypub is a place where mainly young people come so ambience is rowdy, not for family visits. The 1st floor has been recently redecorated, now it looks pretty good! Waiters are fast but sometimes a little arrogant.

This is one of those places where you can drink a lot without having to worry about the price. Best place to drink beer. The beer and beef stake combination is still kick ass. Their mutton ham steak, chicken ala kiev are also great. Although over the years size has reduced and prices gone up, they still are as tasty as ever. However if you are making dinner plans then better avoid this place. Here mostly you get good snacks items which are good with drinks. Main course items are there but they are not that great and priced little high. Chili chicken has too much onion, kebabs are average, roti costs too much, chicken butter masala is average too. In short olypub is great for boozing and having fun, not good for dinner. If you have dinner plans then after boozing here go to golden dragon.

Okay so being a probashi-bangali for life, I have always heard about this place from my peers at Kolkata. So, one fine day, I walk into this pub with a couple of my friends. As soon as I keep my first step, a dawn of realization happens. Shit! This was nothing but Little Sisters at IIT Kharagpur...the beer bar near my campus. Yes, you can never imagine such a place to be in the heart of park street. This is a no-go for classy crowd but with those looking for cheap booze and food in one of the most posh areas of Kolkata, this is the place to be. But, that trip to Olypub was not completely worthless. I had the dish this place is actually known for and it is the Beef Steak. Yes, and it did stand up to its name. So, a must go destination for non-vegans!

AND BTW SERVICE SUCKS!

This rating is a wake up call to the management of Olypub. Please get rid of the laid back attitude, and the horrible service. Taking half an hour to serve a plate of finger food with a beer is just not enough to keep the place among Kolkata's best. Food below average, service bad, and ambience is just an unknown term to the place. Overall this place needs a large scale renovation. This is strictly from a well wisher's point of view.:-(

Which young guy or girl had no been here who drinks? This place is some sort of a heritage. The cheap booze and food attracts all of the young lads of the city. I have almost tried out any thing and everything that they have on their food menu. I have been visiting this place for about 6 years. I have been here atleast a seventy times now. The service could be a little better but I guess managing such a huge crowd always is a big deal.

Beef steak still very succulent, try well done, killer mustard sauce. Would rate it amongst the best ever steaks anywhere. Most other places in kolkata serve buffalo. Reputedly has medicinal properties. Known to kill any dna virus. Decimates dengue and perhaps Ebola...

We went to Olypub on the saraswati puja evening and the Bengali people in their traditional attire sipping a bottle of beer after the pujo were a treat to my eyes. We tried the beef steak which was absolutely legendary and the fish curry which tasted delicious!¬†
The menu is from a British era and the ambiance is very laid back.
The beer is decently priced.

Olypub is one of the few places in and around Park Street offering relatively cheap drinks and food.
The food taste in my opinion was strictly average, but the pricing and the service more than made up for it. The alcohol is pretty cheap compared to other joints in the region.
The waiters are mostly prompt and well behaved, but kinda pushy for tips.

Oly Pub, as the name says, is only a place for those people who want to booze. I do not drink, but had been there once to taste their much praised Chateau Briand aka Beef Steak. We asked for a well done one. But they gave us a medium done, so the meat was stinky and the peas were unboiled. Moreover, I didn't like the ambience, although I went for lunch and the pub was not much occupied. I think you can get better steaks at other places in Kolkata. You need not to honk over Oly Pub for the sake of their steak, at least. Anf for the boozers, I can't review for you people. Sorry and thank you.

Cheap alcohol, beef steak and grilled bacon at the heart of Park street, that's Olypub for us. A true Kolkattan bar with surprising platter for non-veg delicacies. The tandoori chicken, kebabs are great. But the real USP if this place for us at college days was the ever-forbidden Beef steak, it is just as good today as it was 5 years ago. Mixed grill plate is not as good as expected though. Overall a great place to hangout.

My first visit to Oly pub was during one of my official trips to Cal...after rounds of endless meeting... we came back to our respective guest houses... freshened up n strolled around Park Stret... my Reg Mngr who studied in Cal and knew the place well took me to Oly pub...
I was a bit skeptical at first since the entrance didn't look quite good but once inside... it was magical... it has the old Cal feel to it... steaks are good n beer is cheap and the crowd is a decent lot as well... i think oly pub is one of my gigh points about Cal

This place is just a  little walk away from Oxford book store .
Since we had our car parked opposite to it, the name catched our eyes.

The ambience is just like any other local bengali liquor bar , 
Never mind , we had to make a sit there.

The staffs were not humble and the service was slow.

We ordered drinks and starters.
Since i was not feeling like boozing i ordered an orange juice and chicken reshmi kebab.

The juice just had the essence of orange , it was a total plain water.
The kebab was the worst thing I've ever tasted.

I immediately ordered tangri kebab.
The two leg pieces arrived and disappointed me again.
The legs were over spiced, it was served with potato ,beans and papaya.

Unfortunately, i had to pay the bill without eating anything.

This place has been renowned in the city of joy for its cheap food n cheaper bar menu. Being located on the posh park street beside park hotel it can be very easily located. The newly improved interiors add up to it. Chicken Ala Kiev and beef steak are a must try along side beers in the pub. One can expect a rush during the evening and therefore it is advised to go with time in hand.

Finally visited Olypub last week[yeah.I am this late.]. It was a friend's birthday treat. I had a hamburger steak and others had the famous beef steak and chicken ala kiev. I didn't opt for the beef steak as I am not a big fan of beef. The hamburger steak was PERFECTLY cooked.It was served in good portion and was juicy. I would have been even more happier if had given the egg poach over it just as they give for the other steaks. :P According to my friends, the hamburger steak was better than the beef steak even.
Would love to go back to Oly and have the mixed grill next time.

Been there a couple of times and yes its an attachment towards its history of being an oldest bar in Kolkata due to which people go there. Food isn't that great as other reviewers are saying as i have tried almost every dish that olypub serves but not upto the mark. the waiter will pour the peg of drink in front of you which is nice so that you have the confidence of getting what you ordered. Nice place to chillout and hangout with friends but to me Nalban food park in Salt Lake serves some great food at lower prices than Olypub. God knows why Nalban has not been listed in Zomato. Apart from that, some nice chicks come around to have a drink at Olypub which is why I go there sometimes nowadays. Booze n Chicks!

Been there : April 2015
location : just beside oxford book house. How ever parking spaces are hard to find
ambiance : we went to the first floor. It is a nice place to hang in groups. But not so Of a romantic place to take ur date
price: of all the good places in kolkata, this one is the cheapest i found.
food and beverages: Beef steak is nice. Other are okay. Late in the evening, they usually run out of popular beverages.
Extras:  Firstly, the place remains too crowded all the time. Feel lucky if u  get a comfortable seat after 6'o clock in the evening. Secondly, prices in the ground floor are less.but to a little extent. Thirdly, be sure to check ur bill before u pay. They often put on extra charges on the bill. This happend twice with us.
over all experience: quite satisfied

Everything about this place is awesome- food, crowd and of course drinks! but the only problem is the huge weekend queue! This is a place to hang out with your pals, booze and have yummilicious food. Do try their Chicken A La Kiev, Beef steak, mixed grill. Only drawbacks are : can't smoke inside + they do't accept cards!! But it's a must go for people who wants to booze, chat and have fun in a pocket friendly place.

Name me one person in Kolkata who have not gone out to this legendary pub in Kolkata - the famous Olypub right in the heart of park street. One of those places where you can drink to your hearts content without thinking too much about the bill, end up meeting some famous personalities around with the likes of Anjan Dutta and have the best beef steak in the market and amazing pork sausages. The old vintage glasses where the alcohol is served gives a weird but homely college like feeling.. great crowd pitches in here, the ambiance is not extra ordinarily amazing but it gives that certain cozy feeling of Kolkata. Irrespective of all the pubs and lounges i have been into, this is one place i never miss out on... Must visit for anyone who travels to Kolkata for 1 drink atleast.

I have been going to this place from my graduation days.. N i have really enjoyed my time with friends here... Bt after the re-opening the oly pub we used to know has changed. We went to oly to celebrate a friend's wedding.. We were 9 people.. At first the waiters were concerned about the seating arrangement.. So we suggested to sit in 2 adjacent tables.. Even aftr that they refused to take the orders.. When we asked the manager abt this.. He said he cant take orders from us because he thinks our order would be of extremely small amount n he THINKS we were below 21. Even aftr we said we would show our i-card to clear his stupid ideas, he was still adamant. N aftr a shot argument we decided to leave that place n went to mags. 
Never ever thought the management of oly has downgraded to this level. Totally disappointed..

Yes I gave Olypub a 3, in spite of what it is: A Legend in the history of Modern Kolkata. To sum up the entire experience I had today evening when I visited there:

Pros:¬†
1. Brilliant food! Had the Beef Steak, the Mixed Grill and the Chicken a la Kiev (the recommended choices according to Zomato), all were brilliant.
2. Very cheap prices: A Vat 69 small shot at 125! I mean where else do you get these rates?
3. Clean and neat: In spite of so many people coming and going, the place is very neat and clean. Even the washrooms.

Cons:
1. Slow service: Drinks came 20 mins before the food. Could have waited and given them together.
2. Staff too hungry for tips: Had to call the guy 4 times when ordering but 4 waiters were standing beside us when we were paying, even the doorman asked for tips.
3. Noisy crowd: No problem with crowds but with noise yes!

Amidst the historical context of Park Street and several other well famed restaurants,  olypub has managed to keep its boat sailing ,grandly. 
Featured in zomato legendary section, there is no denying that olypub is among the best known places in Park Street. And that legendary status is well complimented by the delectable food they offer. Known for its famous beef steak and well priced alcohol, this place is pure gold for every age group. 
The waiters sometimes become a pain in the ass, but hey, for good food that much is adjustable!
Do visit it once. You'll come back again.

A redecoration.. This is what this place just needed. A new look on the first floor is much appreciated. Everybody knows about this place, its so popular. I love to go there and spend some time with my frns. Rather going alone and observing people at this place is also fun. You will find people with different backgrounds, age groups or even interests, all in one place. 

The recent changes include:
No more smoking in the toilets any more.
No more rats to be found.

Changes recommended:
Only cash accepted, make arrangements for cards too. Its hightime. 
Some seats need to be changed. 

Overall a good experince as always. Will surely visit again even though there are no changes made.

The drinks are really at an affordable price and its pretty lower as compared to other bars of the area. However the ambiance and the service is not that great. It is a good place to go out for a drink with friends. As far as the food menu is concerned, prices are reasonable and the quality is okay. Chicken a la kiev and roast chicken could be tried. But if you are looking for a dine out restro, this is definitely not the correct place.

Disclaimer : The restaurant is dirty, not exactly a place you go with family nd the staff is not friendly. These are the things which is synonymous with this place...however no matter how hard I try I cannot rate this place low becoz this is where you have to drink with friends if ur born in Kolkata nd loitered around park street.
Olly as we like to call it has a cult like following among Xavier's guys like us for whom it was our first watering hole and our fountain during youth. Guys who know it will understand and who DONT will never get it. There is nothing special about this joint except for its signature beef stake but no matter what Olly is truly the place to be if ur lonely or if ur happy nd want to enjoy drinks with friends.

Located in the heart of Park Street, it is a nice place to hang out with friends. You will be lucky to get a free table waiting for you. The ambiance is not excellent but good enough to spend some quality time with your friends over a drink.
The price is on the cheaper side and the dishes are very tasty...so no complains about it at all.
The service is generally swift but during rush hours it can sometimes be slightly on the slower side.
Ambiance- 2/5

And I still go there once in a while to remember... Those great care free days.... The place has a charm which many fancy places moss out on... Of you haven't been there... Just go and be a part of Calcutta

Some say 'olypub' the name is enough. No , the name is not enough.
Off late they have come up with renovations, better space, bigger menu on offer.
Yet they cant arrange a corner for a group more than 6. Not even after requests.
And yes, they seldom do have all liquors available.

The Owners must have to think more.
Overall experience was not fair.

Visited this place today. It was not worth mentioning. The food was not good, neither was the ambiance.

Its a overcrowded place. Too much noise and the staff were like rushing from table to table for serving.

upon hearing a lot about this place me and two of my friends decided to go there. The ambience is kinda ok. don't expect anything fancy or modern in the decor, it's a simple place with rows of tables. The food and drinks are pretty cheap. Our bill came at around 1000 for beers and starters.

I am not giving a 4-rating for the ambiance or for the decor or for the quality of food - but for the sheer experience.

This is one of the oldest watering holes in the city and is rightly located on the street which speaks volumes of the influence that English culture has on Calcuttans!¬†Anyway, this place has two floors - the ground floor is non-ac section where people can smoke without much fuss and the first floor is the air-conditioned one where people would need to step out into a corridor at the back to smoke.

The ambiance is that of a college canteen, only cleaner. The furniture and fixtures cannot be more simple. The service is prompt and the waiters usually know the menu like the back of their hand. The pricing is very economical for the entire menu including alcohol - which is why the place has never got out of style, one might say.

If you're planning to visit on a Fri-Sat evening, please ensure you're there early - I myself don't know what 'early' means for this place since I have tried to enter at various hours but have almost always had to wait in a long queue. The place is usually thronged by mid-senior to senior intellectual folks who gather together to relive those college times; also visited, in equal numbers, by youngsters who like being associated with this tradition.

The place is brightly lit with tube-lights and is usually noisy - hence, warm, romantic evenings can't be planned here. However, people who wish to check out the culture in Kolkata,

Other than cheap booze and¬†quirky co-patrons don't see why this place gets the rating it does.The food menu is extremely limited and you'll soon find out that even from that not everything is on offer. The waiter will take great pleasure along with an "Are you demented?? We obvoiusly don't have that!!" look, to tell you what's not available.Service is swift but very functional. Ambience isn't much to write home about. But the prices are unbelievably low.The only reason why I haven't rated this lesser than a 3 is because you do end up sharing tables with happy & high locals, so a great way to get to know the city better! And of course, a great option for budget travelers.

The pride of park street..there is not a single college student who hasn't been to olypub atleast once. Went there on a Christmas Day. Nice service paired with not-so-nice decor gives the place it's homely ambience. The drinks are cheap and the food is oily and heavy, just what the doctor DIDN'T recommend. But who cares, eh? If you are out in a group near Park Street and want to quench your thirst and have a gala time... do visit olypub. Warning-not all drinks listed are available (or maybe it was so because of Christmas). Food recommendation - The Chateau au Briand / beef steak and the mixed grill. Do give it a try folks.

My first visit to this place was disappointing; maybe because I heard so much and was having expectations. We ordered two chicken dishes and one fish along with some drinks. After the food was served, we did not like the taste of any of the chicken or fish items because all were too sweet. The ambience was pretty good and the price they charge is also cheap. Affordable for college goers and people who booze on a regular basis.

So, finally I was at olypub on a Sunday evening and this was my very first visit. I do not booze, hence the only thing for which I wanted to be over here since long was their famous beef steak. We had to wait for around 15minutes before we were allotted a table. For drinks my friends ordered whiskey and I chose simply a glass of lime soda. Thereafter, we ordered 2 plates of beef steak and a plate of chili prawn. When the food arrived, we hurriedly gobbled up the chili prawns and then took time to enjoy the steak. Now, I understand why their beef steak is so famous. It does taste amazing. Nevertheless, the prawn dish was also tasty but the steak was beyond comparison :D. A perfect weekend evening destination it is.

Olypub is a place one always relates to a time when one was in college. The pub always boasted of cheap liquor, good food and great location.¬†

Their grills and steaks are more comforting than gourmet. They have renovated the second floor of the restaurant which has an american old diner feel to it.¬†

I have been to this place two times.There are two sections-one upstairs and one downstairs.The downstairs look extremely shabby,whereas,the upstair section looks like an old western salon.

The two times,I have been to this place,I have had only drinks,and they are cheap.

Known for their cheap alcohol , BEEF STEAK and CHICKEN A LA KIEV , Olypub is down but not out off the glorious history of Parkstreet . From college goers to senior citizens , this place is frequented by people of every age groups for one prime reason - quality adda over relatively cheap alcohol . The waiters are like vultures ; once you are down a few peg , they will pester you for inflammatory tips. No complains about the ambience .

After staying in Kolkata for 35 years, or 20 years north of attaining drinking age, to be precise, I visited Ollypub for the first time last week.
Experience was both good and bad. Good first. Amazing food, the steaks rocked. Drinks are reasonably priced too.
Now coming to the flip side. Service is horrible, behaviour of the bartenders and stewards is not what you expect at a Park Street eatery of such repute and age. Very, very rude; act as if you are eating free of cost and hence they are doing you a massive favour by letting you in. 
I feel it should be looked into. Ambience otherwise is great. Great EATING experience. 4.5 for food and ambience, 2.5 for service quality.

Location: A stone's throw from Kwality Restaurant (towards McDonald's). 

This place has always been among the few chill out places I resort to. I don't know how I missed on reviewing it. Olypub is a Ground+Mezzanine type pub serving liquor at low prices along with delicious non-vegetarian and not so delicious vegetarian fare.
Earlier this place had a non-descript ambiance with tattered carpets but, now post-renovation, the ambiance has been improved to be a classic style place. Having a mix-match lighting of modern as well as antique wall-mounted lights with photo frames across the walls and wooden flooring on the mezzanine makes it a great place to unwind. 
The ambiance at the ground floor however, remains nearly the same.

Have always been here to unwind along with friends over alcohol, accompaniments and at max a plate of potato wedges or onion fritters (for myself). 
- Low priced liquor.
- Great accompaniment.
- Oily and saltless potato wedges, always.
- Tasteless fritters.

‚Ä¢ Have been here with non-vegetarian eating people who have marked the Chicken A La Kiev & Chicken Cutlet from their kitchen as a thumbs up. :)

‚Ä¢ A negative for this place is, even after the menu being widespread (only non-vegetarian, the vegetarian feels quite limited), most of the items aren't available at all times.
Plus, a few that's available, lack finesse.

The staff here has always been a bit grumpy and not so friendly. But, this doesn't hamper their service speed much, always at a standard speed.
Prices do not seem to pinch the wallet (with respect to liquor and non-vegetarian fare). Might be a pinch (with respect to the vegetarian fare).

Overall has always been a good experience.
- Wish the staff was a bit friendlier and less grumpy. :)
- About the remaining vegetarian fare, would update soon. :)
- The goodwill wouldn't take you a long way if ways aren't mended soon.

Would have given this place a four star rating, but, minus 0.5 due to the disappointing vegetarian fare.

What can I write about this place! I'm sure to grow emotional and biased! Olypub touches that happy cord inside us Kolkatans which we probably never knew existed! A fuss free place to drink, eat, chill and chat, Oly Pub has made and shaped many lives. If you are still doubtful whether they actually pour larger pegs than they should...you must visit and see for yourself! And let someone capture your delightful expressions! 
The mixed grill is universally rejoiced but my personal favourite is definitely the Chicken Ala Kiev. The moment when the warm butter oozes out and fills your plate...ecstacy!!!

In the midst of all the high class Restaurant-Bar in Park Street,there is OlyPub who has its own follower.Ambiance-Its never been famous for its Ambiance.The ground floor is always full with its regular customers and 

by chance if you get a place in the first floor then also it is crowded.It is mainly a place of college students and office goers who are regular to this place.Food/Drinks-The main part that everybody loves 

about OlyPub is its food and cheap price of its drinks.The famous Beef Steak(Half roast/full roast) is must to have with drinks.Dry Chilli Chicken or Chicken Roast is also try able.It has 

good stock of Drinks not so much for the Blended Whiskey or Scotch but it has its Menu.The service is sometimes sloppy as the number of waiters are short than its customers.

Every College students from 90's must have an experience in OlyPub and even for regular Office people(Men/women).it is cheap,good food and a good place to hangout with your friends.A rare place which still has its old kolkata charm in its place.

Olympia as it was known originally for many many decades is one of the old timers of Park Street. Situated next to Moulin Rouge,Bar B Que, Kwalities and Trincas it has remained ever popular over the years. Always a place to chill out with a tall glass of beer or whisky on the rocks after office its forte really is the typical Anglo Indian cusine of Calcutta, Great steaks,chicken ala kiev,sausages and fried fish and the Curries and Rotis are all great tasting and if you eat here once it will definately not be the last.The clientel consists of mainly young execs and the old loyal 'gaon budas" as they say.!!! Amazingly priced Olympia gives you your moneys worth.The decor is very plain with functional seating. Service is good . So drop by any evening--Jhal fireze anyone !!!

Legend- wait for it - dary!
Oly Pub is an institution in Kolkata, and one of my favorite places to eat. If ever I'm in need of an eatery, and can't decide where to go, Oly Pub is THE place that comes to mind. It's like your favorite blankie.
I've been to Oly before and after they renovated the top floors and I like it. Downstairs they still have the Pub like feel with the bar and plastic chairs and table arrangement. It's one of the few places in Kolkata with that Pub ambiance. And it certainly sounds like one. But you can still have a good conversation with friends. The upstairs, after the renovations, has become the fine dining part of Oly, a place where you can sit and have a regal dinner with friends and family. With dim lighting, proper sofas and tables, the upstairs and downstairs are two completely different atmospheres. With this improvement, it's possible to get children and family to eat out at Oly, cause people should.Have whatever opinions you want about the ambiance, the food is undeniably amazing. Call me monotonous, but whenever I go to Oly, I have to order the beef steak. It is amazing. Another positive of Oly is the alcohol. Cheap and authentic. Oly is very well priced and it more a budget eatery than anything else.Not much needs to be said about Oly Pub, apart from Legend - wait for it - dary!

Here it goes..

#The bad:-
-Waiters are rigid and not that friendly,
-There's no music playing for you.
-The biggest problem is that only cash is accepted. No sort of cards used here.

#The good:-
-Food is too good for the value. Both veg and non veg.
-Drinks are way cheaper though, authentic.
-The renovated ambiance is quite nice and spacious and it's sober.

The bottom line is, this is the place to start the party for some and is meant for pure adda. Take #Coffee #House and make it a bar, Olypub is what you get.
********************************************
After the renovation, I've visited Oly thrice and my last visit a few days back was simply birth the wait. Had Fish Fingers and Chili Chicken with the most authentic Kashondi (Mustard sauce) that I've ever tasted anywhere. The staff remains to be the same with the approach but the place is now a whole different level apart.

I can spend hours sitting there with my friends and chatting. Those chairs and tables, few old waiters, the glasses, etc add nostalgia.

Come to kolkata, go to Park St, and ask any guy, where do u get the cheapest booze and good beef steak, they ll point you out towards this place. Even zomato says that! Based on this legendary reputation, three of us went in. The menu card looks promising, but mind the words, LOOKS, but isnt. Thats because a lot of things are missing. Nothing else other than scrambled eggs was available in the egg catagory.¬†
Anyway, Beef Steak, Pork Sausages, Scrambled Eggs and a Prawn Cutlet was ordered. Plus, we had beer. Pint, they dont have. Out of the whole list of beer, they have just 3 variety. Anyway moving on...Beef Steak, juicy, and well done. Worth the money. Pork sausages, small ones, serve about 8 pieces of them, slightly salt heavy, but is nice. Scrambled eggs, standard issue stuff, nothing wrong with it.
Then, tragedy stuck us. The prawn cutlet arrived. Two of them...they appeared nice. And before i began, i pulled out the tail, and we laughed that we have been tricked, and that there was no prawn within. First bite, what the hell is this thing. There was no taste of prawn in any way, the thing tasted only of onions and had a bit of prawn flavour. We managed to finish only one. We ordered fish fingers and a mixed grill. Fish finger was again, so so, and tasted okay with the mustard, while the mixed grill could have been better. And there were bones in the meat pieces, didnt enjoy it much.
The waiters need to be more polite and be a bit more attentive. Also, they demand a tip, which immediately caused us to withdraw the little amount we were planing to leave.
To end, I ll say, this place is running only on the reputation, and most definitely not on the food quality, and it isnt so cheap after all, if u factor in the availability of the cheaper stuffs.

It's the usually. And almost all the reviews stay the same, except the experiences vary. 
And this place is a very old favourite of mine. I come here often when I need beer , beef steak or chicken a la Kiev. 
In conclusion I don't know what to write, because oly is a comfort place for me.

Went to Olypub during my first ever visit to Kolkata a few days ago. Had heard a lot of great things about the place, but the ones who recommended it didn't know that the upper section is now closed. That was the real hip place with the smoking zone.

The place was quite empty on a Wednesday (to be expected) but I realised later that it was in part because the upper section burned down. The staff are courteous but confused and the beer is reasonably cheap.

Can't say more because Olypub is apparently no longer Olypub.

Tried out most of the continental items like chicken a la kiev, mixed grill, mutton steak, beef steak and yes I was delighted with what they offer at probably the cheapest price. 
Ps: Only once did we try the indian food namely chicken rezala and it was a disaster. 
So we avoid it and only have the continental stuff

Very frankly I wasn't impressed by the service of the staffs. The bill was placed to us before we could finish our food which annoyed us. The behaviour of the staffs was not friendly and hence we weren't treated well. We were three in number and we ordered beaf steak which was more or less tasty and beer. Price is affordable and ambience needs to be improved.

A decent place to have drinks and hangout with friends.The atmosphere is quite nice and you wont be bugged by others.As pointed out it is certainly a place to have alcohol at a reasonable price!Although it has been a long time since I last visited.

This isn't a place you review.¬†

This is a place, stories of which, is passed down from many a fathers to their sons. Olypub just exists.¬†If you go there expecting something,¬†you're¬†probably not gonna get it.¬†

You go to Olypub because it will have you. Its that place where you have that one¬†experience, you may either want to forget or remember for the rest of your life.¬†You go there for the conversation you thought you'd never have. You go there for the Chicken Kiev and the Beef Stake.¬†

Olypub gets two kinds of customers, the regulars and everyone else.¬†

PS: Take cash! No card business here.¬†
PSS: If you're planning to go to SPE, come and get drunk at Oly first, Will save you a lotta money!

A very old place which sells cheap booze and nostalgia. A very basic watering hole with a very limited variety of drinks, but I can never be bored to walk into this "pub"

A high ceiling heritage restaurant which makes me feel great about the present and the innumerable times I've been here. Keep your drinks basic, beer or normal whiskey with some basic and a grata bunch of friends would transform this place to a wonderland. 

A lot of people do talk about the beef stake, nothing great. Just a rubbery piece of meat. 

But hell yeah! Can't wait to get back to Oly the next time I am in town ( like a true calcuttan)

Go with a bunch of friends for a gala time!

If you are looking for alcohol and ¬†great food at a cheap price...this is the place to be.My suggestion would be a beer with ¬†Chicken Ala Keiv or Beef Stake.Very recently this store did catch fire and was closed for some time.But they say legends never die.This place has been there in Kolkata since its inception,henceforth to regain its status OlyPub was reopened again and to my utter surprise it again got houseful in a matter of minutes.

Olypub is a place where people use to go for drinks. I also went there with my friends to have some drink. It's not a very well decorated place as because of it's age. I ordered chilli prawn and chicken alakiev and four whisky. The two dishes which we ordered to eat was really good and suggest people to go and try this two dishes at Olypub..

Ambience: Pretty shady.
Cost: Cheap.
Food: Only have the beef steak (chateau briand steak) and let go of the rest!
And there you have it, a VFM deal in Park Street.

To sum up, go here and just hang out. Expect nothing more and nothing less. Also, this place (as pointed out by my female friend) is not very female friendly. She said that her female only group was not encouraged to go in.

One of those essences which make Park Street what it is. I have been to Olypub just a handful of times, but all those times have been quite memorable. The place remains pretty crowded on all days, but getting a table isn't usually a problem, unless it's a special occasion (you should take a look at the queue outside on Christmas day). It has a very old-world feel about it, and the bare minimum interior design adds to that. 

Olypub is a great place to hang out with your friends over a few rounds of drinks. The liquor is available at decent rates, and once seated, the conversation just flows. As for the food, I have had either the chicken a la Kiev or the beef steak whenever I have been here, and both the items are worth a try. The former is actually considered one of their specialities. 

Olypub lacks the zing of many of the modern pubs, but this is the place where memories are made. If you aren't a teetotaller, this place should definitely be on your to-visit list.

No one goes to Oly Pub for the ambience. It is the prices that draws people in heavy numbers. They have consistently maintained a shabby ambience with a purpose it seems. Apart from the drinks, the beef steak at this place is worth trying.

Ummm.... what to say. Olypub has been the centre of college student attraction since many a years. Owing to its pocket friendliness and location, Olypub is definitely one of the dining places to hang out with friends. Chicken Ala-Kiev is one of my favorites that I had on my visit along with a bottle of Heineken ;)Definitely a visit worth-a-while

Olypub is always the first choice pub for most college students of Kolkata. I too had a lot of visits there when I was studying and it is someplace where I will always have a lot of memories. Recently, after a fire hazard they have renovated the place and the place looks really nice now. Its a great place to have a beer with your friends. Also the trademark dishes are the Beef Steak and Chicken Ala-Kiev. Unfortunately they do not taste as good as they used to be 5 years ago but still you have it anyways. The price of alcohol is also modest considering it is in the heart of Park Street. Recommended for students and also if you wana hang out with friends for a small pocket pinch.

Been there only for @beefsteak.  Old cozy environment.  Furniture are old and the gap between table and chair is very small. But foods are good and in prime location. One beef steak and one beer costs 400.00+,  so it is cheap than others.  It's OK.

Olypub spells nostalgia. My first pub experience. In those days i was a non-drinker. Upon entering, the strong smell of liquor was enough to make me dizzy. I spent my entire time covering up my nose. Such idiotness! And now, for me, olypub is the place to be. I learnt to drink, sitting here in olypub. Be it a birthday celebration or catching up with friends or passing time or celebrating the onset of Durga Pujas, olypub is where we head to. Where else will you get a small vodka peg for 50rs? Olypub has stood by me in times of broke or otherwise. I have never seen an empty olypub except one instance when i visited it around 11am. But even then it had cusromers. Even the stench of liquor from the water bottles instigate a feeling of nostalgia. The food is good as well. The french fries had the exact amount of crispiness, the chicken ala kiev has the exact amount of molten butter in it, the legendary beef steak is perfectly cooked and so on. My only complaint is, i always find the sauteed veggies with the steaks to be stale. Price is really reasonable. Have spent hours here, so much so that sometimes the waiters have to shoo us out because its 15minutes past their closing time. Please don't go there if you prefer a fine drinking experience. Totally no-no for the so-called-elite showoffs. But remember, olypub is a class of its own. Simply apart from any other pubs that charge you 4 times the rate of olypub. A perfect hangout for students and office goers alike. Best place to be with friends or foes. Highly recommended. Cheerie!

The city of joy has not restricted itself to just being a book loving or football fanatic city, over the years it has emerged into a true modern city which has all the traits to experiment with all aspects of life. And in this case the first thing which pops in our mind is most positively food. Kolkata today thanks to its century old food loving and preserving culture, has mushroomed numerous restaurants, bars, food parlours to experiment with new and unique food items. Such place is Olypub, as its name stands for fun and bubbly serves food which extends smile on your face. I have visited the place couple of times. The restaurant cum bar is a sheer delight. I often try their chili prawn, chili fish, or grilled fish. The chunk of the fish melting into mouth is simply heavenly. Though I am more of a chicken person than mutton, still I love to try their mutton cutlet and chili mutton. Quite often I go for their chicken sandwiches. There is nothing like Kebab on platter, so mutton seek kebab is what I prefer. Sometimes I order chicken seek kebab, or chicken boti kebab or prawn curry. Lastly pineapple juice is fully satisfying.

It was my first time to Oly's and having heard so much about it, I cannot say that I was disappointed. I tried the steak (something everyone seemed to talk about) and it was good with regard to the price. The quantity and the quality of the food was reasonable.
Though the ambience was a little more noisy than what I had expected, I would believe that the reason was the New Year's mood. But slowly it becomes less bothering, especially if you've got company.
On the whole I would recommend Oly to people who are looking for comfortable, fun and reasonably priced food.

I have always failed to understand the hype about Olly. The booze is not as cheap as people claim and the staff and crowd are absolutely below par.

I had the misfortune of visiting here once with a female friend of mine and it was truly a regrettable experience. 

The booze brought along with it peanuts that were being circulated across all the tables with no damn being given about hygiene. The waiters here probably think of themselves as the President of the country. We ordered chilli chicken starters which were average and thanks to the dirty lecherous looks that were showered upon us by some of the men who were fascinated out of their wits to see women drinking in public, we dropped the idea of ordering a main course and thanked our stars for getting out of there unharmed.

Thanks but I don't need cheap booze that comes at the price of being oggled at.

When we paid the waiter he didn't bring  Back the change...  rude... they need to give their waiters a little training on how the deal with customers..

I was told, earlier Olypub used to be a dingy place. And that would add to it's charm. It's not like that any more. And so the place's charm quotient has also dipped. Yet, it's a part of Kolkata's glorious food folklore. Food here is good, as it is at most of the places in Kolkata. It's also a great value for money place. So, a visit, when you are in this city, is worth it.

Ground floor is just like pub. If you want a bit nice and cozy place, you have to visit upstairs. Waiters don't pay attention if you are not a known face. If you knock 4 to 5 times they will just reply they are unable to provide you with a table and unable to assure you with a good news. Reasonable rate for booze, beef steak is their speciality and other continental dishes like chicken a la kiev chicken a la olypub is quiet good. Mutton roast was bitter in taste. So do the chicken roast.

Still one of oldest but the best place to grab a couple of drinks. The interior lacks the typical luxury of the Park Street eateries. But the old and the young guns still holds this place close to their hearts. Undoubtedly the best place to hog on beef steak in Kolkata. Also, one of the cheapest place for drinks and catch up with friends over the latest gossip or political adda.

This place is by far the cheapest and coolest place to hangout in Park Street with your friends.
I went to this place on 25th DEC and as expected there was a long queue... and my group comprised of six people. So we had to wait for quite some time before we got in ...
The place was packed
Now we ordered both mutton and beef steaks and guys it was worth 110 rs . 
For two people one plate is enough and there are drinks also.
The ambiance is good .. so is the environment and the waiters.But don't expect fast and prompt service on Festive days.
But be warned you may not get your preferred seat or brand during festive season as they run out of stock

The bottom line is: Have only 300 rs in your pocket? Got time to spend? Have friends to Hangout? Go to this place without and further questions... your money and time wont be wasted

This is a place I have gone back to, time and again. For a college student the depth of your wallet is as shallow as people you will date. Oly is perfect if you just want to grab a beer and hangout with friends. The #Chickenalakiev is sublime and the rest is also good enough but just what ever you do stay away from the mixed grill, you will regret every bite you take. But if you really want to try it out make sure you had 2 beers to provide you a safety cushion.

The people who serve you are proactive ¬†when it's time to pay the tip and reactive rest of the time.¬†
But over all I enjoy when ever I am there. :)

Always had a good time here.
Although except for beef steak I never knew a good dish to order.
So yesterday when I went, I asked the waiter and he recommended chicken ala Kiev.

It looked unique for sure! It is chicken wrapped in some spices n masala and a lyer of bread fried over it.

After two big bites i see a dollop of butter inside. How did it stay intact is still a mystery to me. The butter was overflowing out of the chicken. It added to the taste so well.

I poured The extra butter on mashed potatoes and wow. A very new dish and yes yummy of course!

Give it a try.

Conveniently placed at Park Street Olypub is one of the best places to hang out with friends and booze. Beef Steak is a must try item here and if u r not into red meat , u can go for chicken a-la keiv.
To most of kolkata's young crowd it is a nostalgic place for sure. What makes the ambience more alive is its crowd. You will find a small kolkata here.

Smell of this place causes me discomfort at times. I had my first beef steak and chicken ala-kiev here. Very soon it became a common hang out place for college students like us. Its more of a continental place. Just get hold of a beer bottle and order some snacks. There are big fat rats who very often play beneath your table or underneath your sofa. But don't be scared. they are harmless. Just don't try Mughlai dishes here if you want to retain a nice feeling of this place.

Every Calcuttan worth his salt has been here. I have been here too with friends on ocassional outings. To begin with, I have tried their Chicken ala Kiev , Beer et al. The place is usually crowded brimming with people all the time. It is Kolkata's iconic pub. It has its young fans. But I have seen nothing exceptional about this place. The food is average and the service is even more ordinary. Looks somewhat like a cheap watering hole if the halo surrounding it isn't considered.

Went in last night for a quick drink and bite, however when we reached there it was way to crowded, and we waited.. The door man quickly got us in after 5min wait and we wer sat on a nice table, after which we ordered for few rounds of drinks and some titbits like fries and peas.. Though the fries were soggy... 
The meat platter was good in portion good flavours but again the beef was a bit though.. The prices are very affordable and not tooo heavy on the pocket. Toilets are a bit mucky so one needs to be careful
Overall I enjoyed my time with friends and it was a fun time.. Will definitely return back..

The once legendary olypub has lost most of its charm and glamour. The place is a mess. The service is awful. Waiters will hear you but won't come. And the food is not up to the mark. The size of the beef in the famous beef steak is reducing day by day. Other snacks are also not worth mentioning. But it still remains a top adda zone in kolkata. If you want to grab a beer or a drink at a cheaper price, olypub is your place.

Olypub is where I had my first booze with my ex boyfriend outside. The ambience was ok, but it's quite dirty. Little cockroaches were scurrying around on the table while we were sitting. Service is quite slow. But the old place has its own charm.

Good location, good food, pocket friendly- yet somehow in the midst of all this, the waiters manage to truly sour up your experience! they take forever to bring your order to the table and some even make faces when asked more than twice for drinks! But all in all, i cannot complain about the food. The Beef Steak is awesome!!! The booze is cheap! Waiters are awful! But its OLY! Its a part of KOLKATA! It is what it is but i still find myself repeating the phrase- lets go to OLY! - time and time again! :)

Had absolutely no idea before visiting this place that there can be such a cheap pub in a costly area like park street. I visited this place twice and had awesome experiences both times. First time I had mutton steak with chicken a la Kiev. In the next visit I had mixed grill which was awesome and dried chilli fish which was also a beauty.

Olypub is no longer the Olypub of the 60s and 70s. It has been reduced to a cheap watering hole in today's times. I have been here a couple of times - the place appears filthy, the quality of the food distasteful, the service average to poor, and the crowd is essentially the gentry. Don't let old timers fool you with it's erstwhile good name - today it's not even a shadow of it's once glorious past.

Oly Pub. The name has been a part of my must go a month list for a long time now as it has been the best hangout place during my collage days. Been there uncountable times now and it has always been a good experience. Hard Drinks - They serve quite a lot of good drinks and cost is on the cheaper side. 
Food - When you talk about food at oly it has to have the beef steak in the list¬† and it has been no different for me. Every time i have tried something new but have repeated the same beef steak all the time. Even chicken Ala Kiev is a good option to try.
There was a smoke zone at the back before but that has stopped so you need to go down for a smoke every time.
The only con of the place is they don't accept cards. you have to carry cash in you wallet before you go there.

I have been to this place a couple of times whenever been to Kolkata and it has always been a bit of fun for me.

Being from Bangalore, this is the first time I have experienced a place like this which more than a Pub kind of feels like a Shady Bar but actually it isn't. The crowd which comes here looks quite decent and they stay well mannered. Even there is a good amount of female crowd who come there and are quite relaxed because the overall crowd is good.

I like the old feel of it using the basic wooden chairs and tables. The big steel "Almonard" type of stand Fans, the old liquor bottles they use to serve you chilled water. The first time when I saw waiters serving the ice from a steel bucket using those big steel spoon like thing which I guess is called "Hatha" in Bengali and is used to serve rice, I was like "What the Hell is this" and i couldn't control my laughter. It just took me back to our community Durga Puja celebrations where we used to get served with Rice and Khichdi like this from the bucket.

Anyways, coming back from Memory Lane to this place, the USP of this place is the liquor price. After drinking in couple of places in Bangalore, this place feels like a paradise and I tend to drink more here thinking that " I don't know when will be the next time I can be here again". 

The food also is value for money and quite good, I tried the Chilly Chicken which was decent. Also after reading couple of other Zomato user reviews, I tried the Chicken Ala Kiev (which I strongly recommend as something new to try), and i really liked it especially the look of the dish and the way hot melted butter was oozing out of it when I had the first bite. Mmmm.. Drooling now?? Probably the next time I go there, will try the Chicken A la OlyPub (Can't have the Beef Steak).

Now coming to waiters. They always seem busy and if you give them some order while they are passing by, they just make an irritated face and show their raised hand and ask us to wait. But they do get your order without much delay. Though I felt this was funny (Not funny for the regulars I guess) but probably if they could just improve on this along with the cleanliness and some other minor things of this place, it will be even better (then I would have given 4.5-5 may be) but I guess you can't expect waiters with good attitude when you are paying so less (I was really not expecting Air Conditioning at this price + there is no additional taxes on your final bill which in Bangalore easily increases the bill by 20-30% on top of really expensive liquor and food prices),  but at least for me, even this attitude of theirs somehow adds to the fun element of this place along with the others I mentioned above which makes me wanna go there every-time I visit Kolkata,  as all this is quite new for me.

Anyways, I would say it's a great place to hangout with your buddies. You can just keep ordering your drinks and some decent quality food without worrying that it will dig a deep hole in your pocket. For first timers, I guess they will really like this new kind of experience especially people like me who are new to this really different Kolkata culture.

Well... its truely a place which has embedded itself in generations of Kolkatans as a place where u can have food n booze wid peace..

What wud u get there... 
a good place to have ur peg... the crowd is very level n not sleazy... neither is the place expected to be.
So dont expect wonders from the place or the food but rather a place to hang out wid ur frnds... have ur share of liquor n enjoy the 'adda' !

The most affordable bar for students, in my opinion. Decent place for a drink. The beef steak is pretty good and so are the various kebabs as well. My personal favourite is the steak with a couple of beers. I believe the place could improve in these areas: more comfortable seating (i cant complain about the availability of space though); better service; overall improvent of the quality of food which has lately dropped; cleaner washrooms for men as well as women; a proper dedicated smoking area. Overall i cant complain with this place as i hv been a regular for 3 yeas!

As a consumer I take it I am allowed to go where my bias takes me. I'd heard from my older relatives about the appeal and historical significance of Olypub. I say full credit to the place for sustaining that historical ambience - little details like brass peg-measurement devices and the waiters' dexterities in serving drinks do the trick, I think. I do not doubt that it is a little dirty and unkempt but that has never really been a problem for me. It adds to the aforementioned appeal to be honest. Certain experiences with the place I will admit have been sour. During the pujas this year a certain waiter I presume snapped under building pressure of enormous crowds and behaved rudely towards us. But on a day when I have little to do and feel like a drink and do not mind spending money, I will definitely go. History awaits.¬†If you have any idea about the appeal I'm talking about, I doubt I need to ask you to keep visiting.¬†P.S: I like the Beef Steak. I love the mashed potatoes every time, which isn't surprising, but I also love the peas which is. I do not mind that the steak is tough. It all softens a little under history's radiant glow. :P

Being quite new to Kolkata, I have heard people talking about this place ever since I joined my new job here in the city. So one fine evening, I and a friend decided to try it out. 
The place is quite old and has that old world vibe written all over it. Its more like those adda places where you meet college friends and have a laugh. Coming to the main thing - food now, the waiters suggested me to take the grilled platter. It was good..could have been better though. The drinks are very nicely priced and can be a major attraction point for anyone with a hollow pocket. Overall, even though it lacks on the ambience factor, it gives one that old-days nostalgia and leaves a good memory. 
The food could have been a little better though. Hoping for a more detailed review for my next visit.

If ambience is what you look forward to in a restaurant, this place is certainly not for you. People here just for chilling and passing out time with friends. Service was good but this place failed to meet my expectations in terms of food and ambience. Most irritating was the waiting time. Be prepared to wait for at least an hour before you get a table.
But somehow I liked the place.

Not that impressive as all the reviews and all that people and friend told me about this place like cheap booze, amazing food, excellent ambiance etc. In fact I would say that it is just over-hyped since it used to have an amazing ambiance, amazing food, cheep booze..... First of all they did not have any selection of booze in beers the only beers available were Carlsberg strong and kingfisher blue...the food pathetic...the beef stake was over cooked and felt as if it was reheated in a microwave and served to us where the mashed potatoes were super cold as were the peas...the mixed grill is a waste of money as it says it contains pork chicken and mutton but the ugly truth is it is just a scam where u are served 2-3pc of chicken with only half a bacon(pork) with no mutton in the dish and again the sides served along with it were super cold and the chicken al a Kiev another waste of money where the chicken was again cold and felt as though it is re-heated and the butter at the center was missing...we could only see small dots of butter in the gaps which gave no flavour to the food....finally the ambience which people say is amazing and the place flooding with people..I would say is a complete hoax...it felt as though we were at someone's funereal with the whole place empty drunk men swabbing like girls and the waters seamed completely disinterested in serving us and did it just for the sake of doing so.
Finally I would conclude with saying if u have the budget to spend in oly pub it would be good if you are ready to get scammed or you could be smart and spend the money at someplace else or petercat or mogambo.

Only once I was there with my colleagues. After we entered every single waiter simply misdirect us for sits. Waiters in ground floor told us to go first floor & waiters in first floor told us to go down. We ourselves find out a sit at last. Then we ordered there famous beef steaks & some chicken dishes along with drinks..Price of the food was low enough especially when u are in park street. But the food was pathetic..Not a single dish was properly cooked. It was stinky...Waiters are just there for taking tips..They care a damn about service...Only plus point in Olypub is their low price of drinks in park street...

Olypub Has been the Place where one has the Best Booze in affordable price and what makes a legend in its own accord is it Anglo Influence and ambience. You would fin a ruddy british touch starting from the bottle in which they serve their Water to the food they serve. Once this place use to serve the best Beef Steak in town but now though the soul remains the same the fodd quality has detoriated miserably. The Beef Steak is chewy and hard and almost non edible...The Ala Kieve is mostly A Blub of Bread with chicken essence...the sausages are almost stale in most of the occassions...But then it is still a place close to me heart as i had my first Beer their.

At the end of a tiring day, this is a good place to hangout with friends.

A pub which definitely is not like a pub. The ambience is just not something you will appreciate much. Its just like a small restro. The food served is quite okay, nothing so special. The prices are not high and they will definitely suit you for the service they provide. Its just a normal place. For me, its not a place I would like to visit again and again.

When one speak of cheap booze in the hottest zone of the city, only one name will come to mind - Olypub. Holding its ground at the heart of Park Street, this outlet sits there as long as I can remember. This was and still is the most favourite place for college students. Zero decor, mininum ambience, no cards are the list of things that you can expect of this outlet - it comes no where near to other restaurants in the area. The odds and negativities of this place is its USP as well. 

We had to wait in a queue for half an hour on Thursday evening to get a table for four. The place is heaven for drinkers. The menu doesn't have a starters section, all the items come with dry variant that will go well with the drinks. The food isn't great, but not bad either. Except, of course, the most famous beef steak which is ordered like anything over here. Mutton Hamburger steak that we ordered had too much of tomato and soya sauce in it.

The waiters are friendly but, being few in numbers, they fail to cope up with the demand. One must understand that the frequency of orders from a single table is much greater compared to a dine-in. I will come back to this place whenever old buddies want to catch up to have a good time.

Booz is cheap no doubt but the highly recommended beef steak was so blah! I wouldn't have it again even if it's given free to me. The waiter (an old guy who attended our table) was showing so much of attitude that it put us off right in d beginning. Moreover, he handed us our bill without being asked for it, just in d middle if our course. 
It was a bad experience..never going there again.

Went there with 5 of friends and asked thr waiter for a table and he replied 'No, khaali nahi hai' very rudely. We asked him how much time it would take and he didnt answer even though he heard it clearly. After waiting for about 20 minutes we got a table and it took the waiter another 15 minutes to clear and clean the tables. Another friend joimed us after that but the waiter refused to put an extra seat as he said 'aapne 6 log ka hi bola tha' 
I havent seen any restaurant or pub where the waiters are so rude
We somehow managed to squeeze and sit and waiting for another 15 minutes for someone to take our order but no one came after which we decided to leave the place. 
I had heard a lot about the pub but it was a very disappointing experience. I still dont understand how its still so many people's favourite pub.

People should order the dishes zomato is suggesting. Order Chicken A la Kiev, Mixed grilled Platter and Beef Steaks(if ordered it before so many times,then go for Hamburger Steaks for a change, though not saying its as good as the beef steaks they serve :p ). Every time i went there in past, I ordered the same things(Beef steaks and beers). By the way i went there yesterday just to spend the noon time with the friends came back to Kolkata after so many long days. I would not have accepted their missed placed order of Mixed Grilled instead of beef steaks,if Beef was available. It is suffice to share that though they are serving food at cheaper price than the other restaurant but some of their waiters are so lazy that they hear wrong orders like this and creating a bad reputations and yes they lack the service in placing orders in time. #Bad_Restaurant. Well it was a good dish though. Impromptu was severely created a risk when ordered Pork Sausages. I ordered this dish before, in some other restaurants but those tasted better. Then to change the mood we ordered Chilli Prawn. Well this one did not disappoint. Its soft and a tastes like mushrooms' dishes but more soft.I don't like very hard ambience , neither cozy one.. sophistication everybody likes but getting quite one with cheaper price(they spelt Wine as 'WHINE')is harder than what we find now a days, in this case Olypub would snatch some points from me,though it was weekday noon time.Cheers.

Prime location, cheap booze, nice crowd(read hot girls & occasional celebrity presence), moderate food, memories of bygone era- put all of them together & they will spell only one thing- popular youth destination & there is a pub in the town that checks all the above boxes -OLY PUB. Located at one of the most precious location of kolkata (park-street near the park hotel) this pub stands there from the time I can recall. As the name suggests this joint is actually a pub in all the given sense though some vital features are missing of a pub in here still it can be proudly presented as an old school pub means all the regulars know each other & so do the waiters. I can't possibly add much to what is already been written or said about this place so I will try & keep it short. The entire establishment is divided in two floors. The ground floor is more specious where as the first floor is more private, well nothing is really private here, on a busy weekend you may will have to share your table with a stranger (note- if you are lucky you may get a beautiful company & sometime even a celebrated company.) Now coming to the drinks, the menu says that they regal an array of drinks where in reality only a limited types of drinks are available. There is a bad news for all my ‚Äúsmoker‚Äù brothers & sisters as well. The age old ‚ÄúFag balcony‚Äù is been transformed to ladies ‚Äúrefreshment‚Äù room recently so if you crave a fag during your drinks you need to go all the way out of the main door & puff some fresh air along-with. Well if I say that half of the ‚Äúbangalies‚Äù would have never tried beef (no offense meant to any community) if there was no oly or their famous beef-steak, I wont be exaggerating at all. My friends who have tried it says that the quality of it deteriorated significantly but I cant really shed any light on that. Overall the quality of the food is moderate. The menu is a mix of European classics & Indian traditional foods. For me the main problem with their food is their inconsistent quality & the time it takes to get out of the kitchen & get served in front of you (it often gets cold). The service of the waiters is so so, unless you are a regular. If you are planning to visit it on a weekend you should better be there by 5 in the evening or rather prepare yourself for a long & I mean a really long wait. & don't get fooled by the tag ‚Äúcheap booze‚Äù, it's not cheap by any means but it definitely is cheaper in comparison to the other pubs around..

This is probably the first pub sorta bar in calcutta. Regardless of that, the service is pathetic(just being brutally honest). But then again i often visit this place for the beef steak- nothing fancy; yet that makes it so irresistibly good! And of course its known for cheap alcohol rates in a place like park street.

the worst pub I had ever visited. most importantly beef is also served here. don't know how people can visit there twice. cheap menu for cheaper people. if you have some class, you will surely never visit the place.

I'd say, go to Olypub for the booze, not the food. Although, the beef steak here is legen-waitforit-dary. The seating is that of the perfect pub, with homely waiters. We tried the chicken roast here, which is strictly not the best i'd had. So again, go to Olypub for the cheap booze.

I have been here a lot many times. In my college life this was a place to hangout. It has got a heritage with beaf steak and beer. The food is okay, but service and staff are not. Insisting on tips where they are quite moody and do not provide the required service. Worst part they still donot accept cards. A pub that does not accept cards is meaningless.

Olypub is synonymous to "pub" in Calcutta. One of the oldest pubs for sure and certainly the cheapest on Park Street, The Food Street of Calcutta,the Street that never sleeps. For a cool, pocket friendly hangout with friends over drinks this place is most recommended. But in this age of flashy pubs one has to inculcate a taste for and acquire a liking for this one. The service is good. Waiters are friendly and will certainly remember you if you are a regular to the place. On Saturdays, Sundays & special occassions it is quite tough to manage a place inside. You will have to wait in a long que. Overall its a good place to chill and try out their continental cuisine over your choosen liquor :)

So I had been hearing about this place since I had set up camp in Kharagpur. In spite of having visited Kolkata many times during my 4 years at Kharagpur, I never got around to visit Oly, as it is fondly called by the student community at my college. Now that I started living in Kolkata, I just HAD to visit this place.

To our utter disappointment, this place and its food: just not worth it. You get better food at small scale restaurants in Kolkata. And they should call themselves "Oily Pub" for the quantity and quality of oil they put in their food. I have a thing for restaurants who open up without having everything on their menu, and it's not good. We asked for chicken tandoori, to which the waiter replied that none of the tandoori items were available. We ordered  beef steak and roasted chicken.

The roast chicken was served with a slimy looking sauce, some random *boiled* vegetables, and some fried potato fingers. The potato was smelling as if it was made yesterday and kept in the open. The chicken was OK, but the sauce applied on it was horrible. I had to try to wipe it off and have just the chicken. The sauce left a bitter taste which was unbearable. On complaining, they said that's the way their "master sauce" tastes. God save other dishes in which they use their "master sauce".

The  beef steak was equally, if not more, horrible. Served with boiled peas, mashed potatoes and egg. The meat was rubbery and tasteless. Let alone cutting, it was difficult even to chew. Even the sweet lime soda was so sweet it could make you vomit.

Plus the place is so ugly and shabby. Waiters are ill-mannered. After having such emetic food, giving a tip was out of the question. After we took back the change, the guy stood there, asking for tip. We calmly refused saying we didn't like the food at all. To our surprise (not so much), he arrogantly said "khana jaisa bhi tha, service toh theek tha na" (I don't care how the food was, but the service was OK). Then he went back taunting us aloud "Khana nahi pasand aya inko" (they didn't like the food). Well, duh. While leaving, the gatekeeper also asked for tip.

In short, I want my money back from every person who made such a big deal of this place and the beef steak. Go only if you want drinks with your friends which will not burn a hole in your pocket.

To summarize it:

Food: Horrible

Ambience: Murky

Service: Well, no adjectives

Avoid it at all costs. There are a hundred, if not a thousand, places better than Olypub in Kolkata, which will cater to your expectations and budget.

The perfect place for you if you are on a limited budget. One of the few places in india you get a mix of good crowd and cheap booze. The food is okay and the place is decent. The only problem is, your choices in booze are limited. If you are a beer lover, kingfisher and carlesberg are the only brands you can get your hands on. That apart, a good place to kill time.

Note: The prices have been updated, the pictures of the menu card, not yet. As of 28.09.14 a Carlsberg Strong (650 ml) costs Rs. 185, a beef steak Rs. 160.

In a city where sport bars and exclusive lounges get a miss, people tend to try a whole different variety of mediocre bars and pubs, and the one that definitely tops in this list of plcaes that i have visited is Olypub,fondly called Oly.

Located just beside the Park Hotel, this place associates nostalgia as well as good memories. Booze is pretty cheap and definitely below the existing pubs of this class.

Food is pretty awesome. Once there do try out their Beefsteak,Mixed Grill,Chicken Alakiev, Chicken Olypub,Dry Chilli Chicken. Despite the so very capacity of it, its pretty tough getting a seat out here in the prime evening times specially in weekends.

The only and concerning minus point is Cards are not allowed. Only cash. Management please do work on this ..

Always up for visiting here, time and again.

nice spendingg time here and nyc time passing here. but one thing i dnt like about htis place is the glasses in which they serve drinks. Glasses could have been a bit better.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2-11-2014¬†this sunday was planning to booze out.the first name that came to my mind that everyone(4) agreed to was olypub.same place where we sat the last time. In total we ordered chikn olypub, chikn ala-keiv, fried chicken, hamburger stk(mutton) nd 12 pegs of drinks..

ala keiv and olypub was delicious..really good....chicken fry was ok typ...but the hamburger was really horrible!!! it was so bitter!!! told this to the waiter..he replyed that it is made like that..never tasted or heard any mutton dish to be bitter!!!...please dont try...great loss.... chicken olypub and chicken ala-kiev was really good...had we taken 2 plates each of these instead of hambrger it would have been much better...

bill total ws 2375/-..we gave 2410/-..the waiter asked desperately for tips!!!!..dont know why..last 2 times didnt xperince this!!...we had to give Rs. 20/- more...then while goin out the gate keeper too was asking for tips!!...he told me good night 4 times and asked for tip.it was too irritating!...didnt give a single money.... i have a question to the olypub management...dont they pay their employers!!!!.....overall very good leaving out the tips part and the hamburger!
1st visit:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Was getting bored so 4 of us went to olypub.had heard a lot bout this place.i was planning a lot for this places.this was on my wish list.. i was a bit shocked to see that they had only kingfisher!!..no tuborg..nothing...a bit odd!!..any way had 6 kingfishers and 1 heineken..side dish was chicken olypub and fish fingers .fish fingers were very good and chicken olypub was superb.a must try...chikn olypub and chicken ala kiev  is a must try here..waiters r good.perfect place to hang out with friends.

after that we had to have lunch.lunch was not dat good.we had tandooris and chili chkn.rest of the dishes had single peices so had to go for this.lunch was ok..not very good but the hanging out part with drinks and a side dish was very good...

total for four of us was Rs. 2100/-...a definite visit who has not been to this place...

Been to this place number of times now. The thing to like about this place is the pricing. Other then that I believe not much else is there. The crowd at times can be a bit nasty, the place is not highly clean. However I have never got chance to have a bite of anything to eat here so can't say much about that. But if you are in park street area and u want to have few beers without making a massive hole In your pockets then this would be the place.

Went a few times for their beef steak and every time the quality disappointed me. The last time I visited the steak felt like someone had served me a piece of rubber tire on a plate. The price has also gone up a lot. The ambiance of the place is very unruly. People shout and sing in loud voices and the waiters are manner less and on a heavy day the gatekeepers allow people to go through who bribe them. Also they sometimes do not have even popular alcohol like Old Monk.

Olypub one of the oldest drinking places in kolkata,located in parkstreet this place is always packed with people because of the cheap liquor they serve...people wanting to drink and not wanting to spend loads of money this place is ideal for them...They still serve alcohol in peg basis right infront of your eyes so there is no doubt about the portion of liquor being less in your desired drink...But the only problem of the place is the smell which doesnt go away and the veg food options and taste is horrible...people wanting to have veg food this place is absolutely a no no,for non veg people the food is slightly better but still not the best, to much oil in the food and horrible presentation takes all the mood away from eating..
the only reason to go to this place is for cheap alcohol

Olypub needs no introduction. Only handful people might have one or two chords of complains with OlyPub. I just have 1 complaint, "Place is huge but still always full". You need to wait 10-15mins and talk to already boozing people to know which table is getting vacant and when. Then you wait beside the table.¬†

Wide variety of drinks. They measure the liquors in-front of you. The food is amazing. Beef Stake, A la Kiev, Mix Grill "jo nhi khaya wo pachtaya". The cost is amazingly cheap. There are atleast a 50 bars in the locality but this is cheapest, maintains quality and has the most footfall. You visit anytime during the day and you will find it jam-packed.

What do I like about this place still, which some consider having gone down in its class (or the lack of it!) over the years.. Not really sure.. Maybe it is the memories.. It is the first place I had beef in India.. It is also the first meal I had in Kolkata, the city I consider one of the top 3 in India for food. It is the 2nd cheapest old monk I have had in India (besides Kamaki In Goa, which I think no longer serves it).. many reasons to say the least.

I love going back and having the beef steak (though I would admit, the softness of the beef is not as it used to be), chicken a-la kiev (still as buttery as always), and old monk on the rocks.. :) The fact that servers seem to not care about you (though the service is brisk), or it seems sometimes they forget to clean the place (:D), for me, only adds to the charm!!

In a middle class Bengali famliy where the idea of  having "beef" is almost considered a sacrilege, OLYPUB has always acted as a safe haven for tasting the "prohibited food." I had my first taste of beef at Olypub only, in my college days and thousands of college students have their first venture with beef here itself, for a long long time. And when you are doing something surreptitiously, the fun increases manifold. I have many fond memories with this place.



The colonial charm, the beef steak, chicken a-la kiev - all these have turned Olypub into a folklore, add to that the much cheaper price of the alcohol served over here. To walk down the memory lane and to revisit my college days, I went there a few months back, after a long gap of few years. The setup didn't seem to have changed much, neither the ambiance or the uniform of the staffs. With great expectations, I ordered for Beef Steak. Unfortunately, it was stiff and chewy and while I was trying to cut it, the whole table was shaking, so hard it was ! I looked around and realized that it was not my only table that was shaking, but all the tables who ordered for beef steak. I thought probably it was a bad day. So, I went there again in the next few days. It was even worse, the tables were shaking even more violently... I left hope and somehow managed to gulp it down with beer. I was disappointed. I could hardly match the same beef steak which we enjoyed thouroughly in our college days. Probably, things were not so easy to get then as they are now. The old charm of Olypub was gone (at least to me) and I am not too sure whether it should revive any more. So, I feel its best to live with my college days nostalgia instead of tarnishing the happy memories that I have with this place.

The food is pretty good. Oly special Beef steak though not the most tender, is very tasty.Ambience isn't dimly lit and posh but I like at least one place to be that way. Good for groups and comfy for women. The bartenders and other workers are well-mannered and that makes the ambience work for me.I would have rated the place 4.5 but one whole point deducted because it doesn't have the smoking area anymore. That used to be so convenient for people who like a smoke during meals and drinking. That used to be Oly specialty. But it's gone!!! Aaargh!Price is pretty reasonable.

I can't label this as a pub. You don't find cats wandering in a pub. Flies don't swim in your beer. As far as my knowledge goes, a pub is a place where you get a decent variety of drinks. All they serve is a few brands of whisky, vodka and beer. I had some bitter experiences here. On one such occasion, I was told that they were out of smirnoff, they only had white mischief. I mean which bar in park street says they have ran out on the most popular vodka. Chicken ala kiev and chicken ala olypub is the saving grace.

Well, we all know Olypub is visited regularly for its brilliant Beef steak. If you are into red meat, you must taste the mouth watering beef steak with beer. The mashed potato with the poach is just like a cherry on the top. A combo of a piece of meat, with mashed potato and portion of poach, can literally make your day.¬† Yummm!!!!

¬†I would also suggest chicken ala keiv, for people who do not like red meat. The first time I had it, I felt it was a huge nugget :P
It had mashed potato and chicken inside with molten butter. I still cherish the memory of my first bite of chicken ala keiv :P 
I had no clue that molten butter can create such magic. 

But again, if you are looking for a good ambiance, Olypub is a big no! Its tacky and the service is really bad! Its cost effective and tasty but. If you want to drink beer, never opt for Olypub, because you won't get anything apart from Kingfisher there.

OLYPUB

The name smells of Beef Steak n Chicken Alakiev.
The food:

1. Beef Steak was awesome. Though the peas and mashed potatoes could have tasted better. The beef... was awesome. Super softtt n tenderr.

2. Chkn Alakiev- As ur knife drills into the piece of poultry, liquid butter shall fill up ur plate. Ample use of butter makes this continental dish perfect.

Score for food- 4/5.

The Ambience:
You may call it cheap n down market... shabby tables, chairs, old n worn out cutleries, but we call it typical of Olypub. We are regular at plush upscale restaurants. We love this change.
Score- 3/5.

Value for score-
The most awesome part. Four pegs of top notch whisky, two plate Beef Stake, two Chicken Alakiev. (One plate would have impressively served two persons). Pocket pinch- Rs 1500/-. Authentic drink, authentic food, good time.

Overall score- 4.5/5.

One of the oldest Places to drink or the so called Watering Hole fo Kolkata.... though there have been many changes in this place this is still a go to place if you are interested in drinks and only that... for the non veg maybe the food is good but the options for veg is very low and the food smells like non veg... so not that much fun .... but the drinks are super cheap and the place is something of the old books... till date they serve the drink by a peg measure in front of you which is like awesome...¬†

when the rule of no smoking came into kolkata this place changed and so did the smell there... earlier everything was smelling of smokes and the carpets are not filled with them that till date now the carpets being old smell a little giving this place a weird little smell..

but yet again... if cheap drinks is your look out this the go to place in Kolkata...

Oh, the Beef Stake, delicious, awesome, fabulous etc. etc.
Visited with a group of friends after a year. Same tasty dishes, a bit extra liquor and its one of the cheapest option in the city.
Getting a seat becomes a gamble in the weekends.
Otherwise, superb.

Like a coffee house, hang out with friends, service is awsum, regular water in old wine and whisky bottles.I heard that olypub serves baked fish which is famous, I missed that... But I will visit olypub one more time especially for baked fish...comfortable and ordinary sitting arrangement..... Itz like sitting on rocks in your area with group of friends and having fun... In rough bengali its called "adda's" place....

'OlyPub' that restaurant is my teenage crush !! ¬†This is one of the best pocket friendly pub in Kolkata, where you can enjoy Dine N Wine. Food serves with bit late, which may appetite your hunger. ¬†;)

Don't let the new interiors fool you into thinking it's a fancy place. It still is the Oly it was 10 years ago apart from the smoke cloud and cheaper prices and everything in the menu(apart from the beef steak) tasting nice. 
The waiters are not very friendly and service is not at all upto your expectations but still Oly is where you will find yourself when you want to reminisce your college days.

It's been around for so long and indeed has over time found a definitive place for itself for pub goers. Most have been there atleast once. I too revisited after the longest time only because it's olypub.. Legendry by its own right... But...realised this is not a place for me anymore.. Terribly Dirty and bad food... My saving grace was my lovely company... And general the attendance of an eclectic crowd.

The food is really cheap and most had beef steak,  ala kiev,  chicken liver masala.. 

1. Got an overdose of peas on all dishes......
2. The. Food overall.. Lacked flavor, Taste

'Pub' in Calcutta....literally refers to this famous pub named Olypub.I mean almost everybody has been to this place,at least once in their entire lifetime.
Considering the typical Gypsy/ Hippie culture of Kolkata,this place provides you the best(of liquor and entertainment).
The entertainment over here is of course of a different level.You visit Olypub and you will hear this constant chitter-chatter that surrounds you(much like the noisy pubs on London).
The smoking zone is on the ground floor and the comfort zone is on the first.
Friends provide the best company to you in places like this.Hop in to Olypub after a tiresome Photowalk or simply on a weekend with your friends for relaxation,or with your Old School mates whom you meet after ages.
This place has got the antique smell of decoration and of course of the liquor it serves(they also serve Chivas 16 years).
The pub is also famous for the beef steak it serves,happens to be the best in Kolkata.
If you're a music lover hop into this place early afternoon,have a few pegs,enjoy yourself and strum the guitar a little to get everybody into the jig.
Famous personalities like Anjan Dutt and other eminent musicians-everybody has been and spent a portion of their valuable commercial time at Olypub.
One can try the Chinese dishes here,but the Chilli Chicken they provided last time was so Chilly that I literally gave it up half way.
Also the pub authorities should start serving liquor like the Smirnoff Mango Vodka and the Bacardi White Rum Green Apple Flavour,and the also various fruit juices.
The last time I visited this place,I found a cat in one of the vents.
All in all Olypub is till date the most renowned pub of Kolkata,but it is now time for the Management to go for a makeover of this place,and also take a step towards regulating the price of the liquor served here.

A lot of people swear by this place. Specially for the beef steak and chiocken ala keiv. I had tried both of them and I did not like either of them. The drinks menu is a bit cheap, but with the arrangements on the first floor I doubt whether this place should be called as a pub. The service of the waiters is Ok types nothibg special about this place.

Where do I even start when reviewing Olypub? The place brings back so many memories from my decade long tryst with it. It would not be possible for me to review this place objectively as it would be difficult to separate the tangibles (food, quality of service, etc.) from the intangibles (ambience, associations with the place, quality of crowd, etc.). I had my first peg of alcohol in this place. We were in the final year of school when we started visiting this joint. Back then, it was a smoke filled room (smoking inside the premises wasn‚Äôt banned then) where one would occasionally find rats scurrying around and waiters appeared more inebriated than we were by the end of our sessions. Although we started visiting Olypub primarily because the booze was cheap, the place gradually grew on us. It was a place where you can grab a beer with a group of friends and talk incessantly on everything under the sun from Kafka to Kinks to Kubrick! For those of us who are in our mid/late twenties, Olypub to us was the equivalent to what coffee house was to our predecessors. On somber Saturday evenings we, a group of ten, could easily be located at a table in Olypub. Also, the food was absolutely ecstatic ‚Äì from the amazingly sumptuous beef stake to the opulent Chicken ala olypub and the lip smacking cocktail sausages; made us come back for more. 

Slowly our group disbanded. I left Kolkata for good; and only came back a month before after six years of drifting places. So visiting Olypub after a long time was again a great experience. The ground floor was made air conditioned. The scurrying rats have disappeared now, and new faces have acquired the tables. The waiters have also become more courteous and I did not see the old ‚Äòchacha‚Äô who once suggested me that I should drink more, as even his younger son drinks much more than that ! The food was to die for‚Ä¶once again! Although the beef stake was quite smaller than what it used to be back then. All in all, the pub was still the same; and it‚Äôs for the best that some places do not change with time.

I really don't know what the fuss is about. This restaurant is as dingy as it is unsanitary. The beef steak is no good (seriously, rubbery meat with cold peas on an un-wiped plate is legendary?) and while the alcohol is cheaper than the average drinks place, sure, it is perhaps cheaper (and wiser) drinking at home out of clean glasses than in service-taxed, suspiciously stained ones.¬†
I have never been fond of the service and while I can appreciate the old-school calcutta nostalgia that has kept this place going, I am in no mood to let that sway my review.¬†
Go if you wish to do the touristy thing. Stay the hell away if you are looking to enjoy decent food and drinks while you're at it.

The ambience lets me down every time. Apart from that everything else is satisfactory. The food is normal, service is prompt and the collection of spirits never disappoints me. The best thing about Olypub is that its pocket friendly. And the location-The Park Street, is an add on. I will definitely go back to Olypub once I get back to Calcutta. Hardly there will be any guy or a girl who has grown up in Calcutta and never been to Olypub.

My friends always said "Man you have never been to Olypub?...get a life"...so finally i decide to get a life. After raoming the world and knowing what an PUB is...i expected way better. You can't have resaturant type table and chairs and call your self a PUB...can you?¬†The beer no doubt is cheap, but the fact that they had to offer just 3 beers...(1strong and 2mild) is what pissed us off. I mean cummon you maybe the place serving the best beef steak in town, but that doesnt give you the right to serve just 3 types of beers with such huge reputation to keep up with.
All in all...I would not recommend anyone to this place and i have huge doubts I will visit again.

Leave  the style and the fake classiness in your own house if you plan to visit this place. Appreciate the place for it's uniqueness and the grand old style. These two places, the other being Military cafe in Fountain, Mumbai is an Ode to the rich heritage and history of their respective cultures and it should be appreciated in that way...If you are visiting CALCUTTA..you cannot afford to skip a visit to this grand place for it's sheer history and the passion of the people who are regulars to the place...

This is one of the favorite hangout place in Kolkata for all ages. You might not find someone who has been here and did not like the crowd. Though the place is not grand compared to its counterparts in and around, still the charm draws gangs in here. Few things you will always remember, waiter carrying ice in typical bathroom buckets, sauce being served in hajmola bottles, waiter carrying bottle and server and serving from bottle.... the drinks are never spiked, food quality is good. One should try the lamb preparation, it is heavenly. If you are going with girls, always head for 1st floor. You can always end up finding some or other celebrities sitting in a corner over the weekend. There is no reservation system, so be prepared to wait for half an hour or so. The place opens at 7 and last order is at 11, though you can sit till 12 or 1 also.

I had visited Olypub a while back with a friend. It was chiefly for experiencing the sheer thrill of visiting this legendary pub that once was the throb of Park Street. Of course, it needs no introduction. On busy weekends, it surely goes back to its glory days, with crowded spaces and packed seats. But on a week day, it offers a sublime getaway from the busy schedule of work-home-work. I found the enigma of this place enticing. The waiters were courteous, the service, timely, although a bit slackened and the food, cheap and delicious. The best part of the visit was the Chicken ala Kiev and the Mutton cutlet. We gulped the food down with chilled beer. The place certainly scored with me. I am going back again.

Well there is actually a huge bit of nostalgia and memory associated with this place. Olypub is one of the hottest and oldest destinations right in the heart of the city. The beef and mutton steak is to die for and there was a time when that would have been a regular meal for me. The other foods were also good, but recently things have been on the downside lately. The alcohol prices are moderately cheap in comparision to other pubs and bars around that place. The ambiance is a bit gingy and lately has detoriated a bit, but then again its quiet comfortable enough.

We went thereon some saturday afternoon around 2 p.m. We initially thought it would be full but it wa not. So we were happy to get one preferable seat. Then one came to take our order n we asked him for water n then placed our order. The funniest thing was he served water in a empty bottle of director's choice. LOL!

Anyways, after a 15 mins waiting, finally our food arrived. It was delicious.
We ordered the followings :¬†

chicken a la olypub : on the top of fried bread, it was a chicken breast covered with smashed potatoes n butter with some peas. heavenly taste.crunchy fried bread, luscious chicken n butterly smash.lovely combination.5/5.

chicken roast or roasted chicken : again a lip smacking delicacy. roasted chicken in sweet n tangy sauce with some veggies.lovely. 4.5/5

chicken a la kiev : this was a bit let down. butter inside the fried chicken breast was very less.i did not enjoyed the dish just because of less butter. 3/5

Ambiance: not classy at all. It is a pub where people come to booze n eat in cheap price.so guess how it may be!

Service: horrible. that is the only reason to deduct one point in the rating.one person was taking care of 13 tables. n whoever was doing that was very dishonest.

P.S.: our bill was 520/-. So we gave 550/- to the service boy. He didn't even care to return it to us nd kept the change n bill. Then we went to him n asked for the bill along with change n he replied that he thought it was his tips.
then we arose two points :¬†

1. first ¬†the service boy should return that bill n change to us then it would be our decision what would we give him.

2.secondly, we were giving service charge there then we should not give any extra tips to anyone.

That is the only reason I have rated 3.5 otherwise, it would be 4.5!

overall,a mixed experience........!

So many memories of this place!!! As students this place used to be our joint in park street because of the pricing and quality of food. Oly Pub is The Place for a Bengali to sit for an adda session with friends over a glass of alcohol and steaks. I am not a beef eater but i have seen my friends gorging on the one served here. For me its to do with the chicken steak, chilly chicken, noodles and anything and everything at Oly Pub. One place which a Calcuttan will never forget wherever on the universe he or she is!!!

Though this serves more as a bar, a cheap and good bar in the area of Park Street, my review is for food only.
The thing that takes there over and over again is their sumptuous beef steak-- well-done meat which is still juicy, topped with a unique sauce of onions and peppers and with boiled veggies and mashed potato can make my day anyday! With that I like to have a drink! Have their Chicken Ala Kiev, Grilled chicken, Dry chilli chicken as well ... Service is fast if you manage to get a seat quickly. The ambiance is like any bar full of people drinking and being merry or not depending on your luck, interiors are not any good as well, dingy, low height. The washrooms are pretty horrible.
My advice --- come, eat(suggested dishes only), drink, go!

Oly pub was one of those first pubs I started visiting with friends for a drink.. Located in the heart of the city of Joy, 'OLY'... Or so it's called by most, is just another dimension. Not a very clean and posh ambience, .. Yet it provides a hearty and warm feeling.. Beer as cheap as always... Beef steak is always a yes here.. No matter how good other places serve ... :-D chicken ala kiev, mixed grill still a win win.. ;-) just tip the security guard a little extra during pujas, christmas and new year.. to break the queue and get an early seat. Or just make a pretty face.. :-P some of the down sides would be the newly introduced strict norms about less usage of the smoking zone.. that was one of the perks of having OLY as a #1 pub on the list. And not all flavours and brands of liquor are always available, but then as we keep saying, OLY is OLy :D -with Rohini Roy, Sayantani Sensharma and Sandip Dey

Like most Calcuttans I had my first drinking experience with friends in Oly Pub.
Yes for years this was our hangout spot with friends. Cheap booze is always something you like.The only edible food is the Beef Steak which, I'd say is good. REAL good.The new renovated Oly is better than the old dingy wannabe's paradise. Also, thank god now the roaches are gone post the fire.
Also, maybe I am wrong in observation, but is Oly really that intoxicating that people start acting real "drunk" on a bottle of beer? But hey, maybe I am wrong.

All in all, I really find this place just alright.
And it'd be real good if we get ONE consolidated bill instead of a bunch of bills with different taxes. Honestly, that's quite lame.

This is a current review. First of all, the service and hospitality has gone down to the ultimate lowest level. And the cost has also gone up. People n students go there due to its old name "oly pub". The quality of the dishes has gone down also. Beef steak, the dish for which it used to boast itself,  now tastes awfully smelly. U can visit the place with friends n family but dnt keep it in list if going for date or alone. In short, its a #NoGo from me.

Are you looking for a decent enough booze pub at the heart of Calcutta? Then, my friend, your search is probably over because this is THE PLACE. Apart from the various ranges of alcoholic beverages available here, the pub also serves decent enough dishes to enrich your taste.
¬†Since it is a pub, it doesn't mean they only sell the hard drinks; juices are also available here for those who are averse to consumption of hard beverages. The prices of the beer, rum, wine or other delicacies (whichever is picked) fix anyone's budget any day.¬†
It's almost at a stone's throw distance form the Park Street Metro Station and going there is nearly hassle-free. Among the steaks served here, the beef steaks are a must try. Although there may be some sliced pieces at which one might need extra effort to gnaw, the meal would be satiable enough with beer or rum. The beverages do come with chips and Bombay Mix; the addition of such items help in lifting the mood a little further.

Olypub has been the place for me and my friends whenever we want to go out for a drink that wouldn't burn a hole in our pockets. Well to be frank I am an old customer there (since my school day:P) and almost every alternative waiter and guard knows me and my friends. To be frank the quality of food has certainly degraded with time, the only attraction is the liquor (well it's a bar for god sake) and service is overall satisfactory. One should surely visit Oly once and if you like it maybe you'll find me there someday (not serving but drinking:P) cheers..!!

This is one of my favorite pubs in the city. Mostly because its completely 'Old School', simple tables and chairs, waiters dressed in a kind of orthodox attire, no flashy decorations inside the pub, drinks served in plain glasses. Basically its simple yet awesome. I have some kind of a nostalgic attachment to this place, as I was a very frequent visitor here during my college days. What's best about this place is the quality of the food, its absolutely delicious. The most famous dish being the Beef Steak. The AC completely chills this place down, creating the perfect conditions to get drunk. The waiters are pretty friendly too.  Now, here are a few cons, food is served after a pretty long waiting period and the same goes for drinks. The place is usually crowded at night, and its very hard to get a seat on weekends. Washrooms are not clean.

Price wise it's quite a cheap place..specially it's ideal for student. But the service out there was actually horrible. The waiter to customer ratio is very low. It was a bit crowdy that day.We had to wait for our table for 15-20 minutes. After finaly settling down they didn't clean the table or take our order even after calling them thousand times.. Their attitude i dint like at all. As is they were doing us some favour or like that. Food was good though.. So may be i'll go back there only becuz of the food n cheap price.

Beef steak, cocktail sausages, Chicken ala Kiev, Cheap Booze. CHECK. That for me sums up Olypub. Its one of my favourite hangout spots, where you'd expect all kind of people, from shady to hep n happening. At first the place might not look really appealing, but it would eventually settle in because Oly serves some real good food. I first visited this place to have their 'ever so famous' beef steak, and I was not one bit disappointed. It was undoubtedly one of the best steaks I've had. There's much to try on the menu, each of them delicious, Chicken ala Oly being one of their many signatures. The atmosphere inside if pretty chilled out, the service is real quick and the staff, a little intimidating. Unlike its name, this place is not just a pub, but definitely serves mouth watering food. If in kolkata, please do drop by Olypub once :D

Situated just on the main road, oly pub can be a place where you can have drinks and spend hours with friends. But, ambience, not so good to be honest. Booze is sold at a reasonable price. Though the stock or collection is very limited.  However, the food is slightly overpriced compared to the quality. Quantity is again a setback.

I don't know how should I rate this place. When I entered I was a bit surprised to see the ambiance then we shifted to the upper section which had more crowd. The place buzzed with the Chit chat sounds of the crowd. There was no feel of the AC out there. 

My friends ordered carlsberg strong n I opted fish n chips along with chicken ala Kiev 

Fish n chips were served with boiled veg n big fat French fries. The dish was tasty though
Chicken ala Kiev looked like huge chicken 65 . When I cut the first bite , I could see 2 cubes of butter oozing out. Didn't know how to react . I found the dish pretty average though.

Service was kind a slow owing to the crowd but waiter was quite helpful when it came to deciding our order. Price wise it's cheap indeed.
They should consider to include more varieties in their menu and should slightly improve their ambiance. 

I also damaged my phone in the rains but luckily could save the pics which I had clicked here. Sharing the same . Overall a good place which has lots of potential .

Oly pub... it's a name of an era... I had been there for numerous times... whenever I feel sad or feel little gloomy I always revitalise myself at this place.. It brings me so many nostalgia.. Enough of rubbish talk.. now come to the really valuable points.. The most pocket friendly bar in the park Street area... Ambience reception and the food all are kinda okay okay type but whenever you visit oly you actually never think of food ambience or reception.. It's all about a place to chill with ur best buddies and got drunk.. One vital point it generally not accepts any cards..

Olypub is where I learnt to booze. It means loads of nostalgia. White mischief with lime cordial.  N nothing to beat the beef stake. U might as well try the chicken a-la-kiev. U can spend hours talking books, movies, politics,  romance. Its age old n nostalgic.

The first thing i noticed as the very name already suggests that its a 'Pub'. The food was not bad and quite pocket friendly but didn't really like the noisy environment and the quirky behavior of the waiter. But i am a non-pub person and the rating is totally based on my experience so far. If u really like hanging out with friends accompanied by beer, pork chops and beef steaks then it is the perfect place for you.
p.s. check your wallet for enough cash first because they don't accept cards.

The beef steak may have become more rubbery. The waiters may have become grumpier. The management may not be as liberal with the use of that passage for smoking any more. But then, the cocktail sausages are still as yummy, the beer still cheaper than many watering holes in the city, the chicken ala kiev and mixed grill still as inviting.

Before writing a review a fun fact - this is the only bar/pub (topic of controversy ;-) where the waiters will measure a 60ml or 30ml peg in front of you unlike other bars where the quantity depends totally on the bartenders' mood.
Now, I would like to say that strictly this is a place for cheap booze & good cheap food only. If u r out with your gf on a romantic date, don't even think about my beloved olypub. The Beaf steak here is a classic favorite. A la olypub, A la kiev both are the signature dishes of olypub, so please try those. Mixed grill platter should be avoided in my opinion. Looked great tasted aweful. Still I'm not going to complain cause it's the oldest, cheapest and coolest pub of kolkata. Deadly combination. Please visit. Njoy guys. Cheers!!

One of the pocket-friendly bar cum restaurent in part street area. The decoration, ambience, stuffs' behavior are nothing special, very much soso. their drink menu is quite standard and in budget ( which actually motivates maximum people to come here). Regarding food, their signature dishes are beef steak, hamburger steak, roast chicken and chicken a la kiev. these are really tasty. i tried chilly chicken and fish also. those were very much salty, even we could not finish it oneday.  currently though they have a big menu card, but they serve only indian foods. i tried chicken butter masala with tandoori roti. the chicken pieces are too small and they provide two pieces in one plate. rotis were not soft also. even the waiter gets angry if you call him multiple times. so, to have food i cannot recommend this one, anyone can come here for drink with steaks...

Its highly disappointing considering the fact that it's located in Park Street,the food paradise.. Being a teetotaler its not at all a place for people like me. Supposedly the only good thing for a non-drinker would have been its famous beef steak. But even then it failed to live upto my  expectations cause i had much better ones elsewhere. The ambience too isn't good enough,wsy too ordinary.Overall my experience wasn't even satisfactory. Hence the rating.

This place, which used to be mostly empty on weekdays even just a couple of years ago, is a famous hangout for youngsters these days. Oly is mostly famous for its beef steak. Though the mixed grill is also quite talked about, I didn't like it that much due to the presence of bone in chicken pieces.
Now, the thing about their beef steaks, on our earlier visits, one beef steak used to fill a person completely and more. But due to the reduction in size on our last visit we actually ate, to our surprise, two beef steaks each. But even though the size was reduced, it still tasted just as good. On some days though, some unfortunate person may get a very undercooked slice of beef, which had happened to me before, and to avoid that you should mention that you want your steak well done. 
The Indian tandoori, curries, and fish fingers are also quite well, as is the fresh lime soda. Also due to the relative cheapness of prices, not that much of a pocket pinch. However on some days they make a hassle with underage kids ordering beers, demanding an identity card. 
There are a few downsides of the place though. First is the waiters. They are very unprofessional, and non courteous. You have to ask them repeatedly to clean your table, or to serve your drinks. And eating on a table cluttered with dirty dishes is not a very pleasant experience. Also, you have to opt for a dine in here. Their parcel system is really, really bad. The one time I tried to opt for a take out, all three packages opened in the middle of the road and started dripping ferociously. 
Third, due to the over publicity of the place these days, a bunch of unpleasant crowd is often seen. In a pub in the heart of park street, it is uncomfortable if teenagers (and not teenagers, in some cases) get drunk and leer at you all the way from their own  table.
Though I bantered a lot about  the downsides, I know I'll keep going to that place again and again.

My first visit to Olypub wasn't all that bad. It was in the afternoon and the place was relatively empty. We had time to chat with the waiters a bit so we got the recommended items (a la kiev and beef steak). They weren't world class, but pretty decent for the price. But since I had heard so much about Olypub's "lively" atmosphere, I had recently gone back on a Saturday evening.

Oops.

For all those who plan to "experience" Olypub,  may I please divert our thoughts to Fairlawn Hotel on Sudder Street. It may be more like what your looking for (I don't know if it's on zomato though). It will have about 50 years worth of history, culture, crowd and ambiance. For those who just wanna have a drink...while looking at other like minded people have more drinks, a big thumps up. And for simple foodie who wants do his hunger justice, turn off google maps and walk the other way. Flury's is right across the street. Have a chicken patty and a cheese cake. That's what I did.

Olypub is a well known bar cum restaurant in kolkata. They really don't need a review in here. It is well known for its price and food. One of the beat food you will find in here is beef steak. According to price dis place is very good. But there are two things that disappoints me. One is the behavior of waiters. They are rude and lazy types. They don't respond easily. And the 2nd thing is they serve water in used liquor bottles. I dont know why they use that. But that thing disgusts me. Otherwise its a good place

"Classic not Classy" is the only way to define this historical pub. The place does not boast of ambiance, quality service or a star studded menu but it surely does promise you cheap alcohol, unlimited conversations (with friends or the person guzzling on the next table!) , quirky waiters, shady ambiance and the perpetual fragrance of alcohol. Its good to see that the place has not lost its charm of having a full house any given evening. Located centrally in the heart of Park Street, the place is very easy yet not worth missing! If you are still dependent on your parents for currency and have carefree friends.. this is the place to spend!!

Cheers..!!

I adore OlyPub. If you're looking for fine dining experiences in Kolkata, then Oly is not the right choice but it is if youre looking for a place to get together with friends for good food and ridiculously cheap alcohol. The beef steak is yummy as are the chicken ala kiev and chicken ala oly. The decor is very, very basic and occasionally you'll see a cat strolling past inside the pub (which adds to the charm if you're a cat lover like me). One has to really keep track of what alcohol is being ordered because the waiters are cunning and tend to add extra drinks to the bill if they notice youre in a big group and might lose track of how many drinks have been ordered.

If u want a cheap, light on the pocket place in Park Street to hang out with friends  then Olypub is your place. A very old outlet with long history and cheap liquor. There is nothing to talk about in terms of ambience and the food also is very simple. Had tried the chicken ala kiev and it  was bad will have to say. So the only reason I would suggest Olypub is if you wanna have a few drinks at a good price before heading elsewhere. Beyond that nothing to review.

What's unique about Calcutta is an almost Daliesque persistence of memory: a longing for things past, a prepeonderence of all things sepia and a permamnent colonial hangover - even as innovation, globalisation, and consumerism grips the city slowly, something's about Calcutta remain exactly the same.

One such monolith, is an ancient watery hole, a grimy, bustling, messy, smelly but oddly beautiful and atmospheric speak easy located at the heart of Calcutta's night-out paradise: Olypub or 'Olympia' as it originally used to be known. 

Try the mildly mangled, colonial fare - the superbly popular beef steak, the hamburger steak, the mixed grill, the bizarre chicken ala keiv and the drenched-in-oil finger chips; Let the drinks flow, the usual spirits poured in generous pegs into grimy glasses downed in massive volumes by the junta, keen for a respite from the work-life, talking, shouting, screaming, singing, loving, laughing, crying and at times, puking their hearts out.

Olypub is an idea, a jaded, tired, care-worn idea of being and arrival, of mirth and revelry, of exotic satiety and forbidden romance, an idea that's way past its prime, an idea standing on long uncared for legs, but an idea that's lit everyday by the needs and wants, the moods and dreams of the many who still feel a sliver of peace and happiness from their lives within the shadowy confines of this ancient abode of a lost city, echoing a forgotten time and a phantom, yesteryear charm.

The only restaurant in park street which has utterly disappointed me especially because so many people had recommended this place to me and also my faith in zomato got breached! Not that i didn't know this place was dead noisy with a pathetic ambience and filled with drunkards,however,what i expected was a slightly decent food quality,i mean that's the main criteria for writing a review. As per everyone's suggestion,we chose a beef steak,a chicken a la kiev and a roast chicken.
The beef steak was so chewy,cutting with knife and fork was impossible,even pulling the meat with your teeth against your hand would tear the flesh with great difficulty. It tasted eerie. The a la kiev lived up to it's name,i.e. molten butter stuffed chicken cutlet,however,there was almost no hint of chicken in it! If you wanna have the perfect a-la-kiev,visit mocambo! However,the disaster point was the arrival of roast chicken! It had a dreaded gravy(never seen gravy with a roasted dish) which was sour. The chicken tasted rancid and horrible.
Visit this place only if you wanna booze with friends,and don't order any food from here,that would be my earnest request to all the foodies!

Olypub,  the pub with heritage is always packed with crowds . This place is not so clean and the ambiance is pretty average. They serve whisky or beer in a very ordinary glass with ice and water with the person's preferred side dish. . Heard a lot about Olypub's beef stick but never tried! The staffs are quick at service and Olypub's a drinker's heaven. Although I din't like the place much , the only thing that made me come to this place is for its traditional value and the good staffs with quick service !

Olypub is a must visit in Kolkata. It falls in a separate category of bars which caters to all. Serves good food and great drink. The bar is fully stocked and the seating is very diffferant from othr bars but what makes olypub so great is the overall experience on park street and the value for money. It is a noisy bar in the heart of the city and sober bright light all around.
Olypub must visit for overall experience.

This is a heritage pub of Kolkata near Park Street , this is a tank where every thirsty animals must have a drink. My all time  favourite pub just for the awesome foods like Beef Stake , Cocktail Sausage . Moreover you will always get at least one drop extra alcohol than what you pay for. Drinks are well priced and the place is friendly. This pub is strictly CASH.  It's basic in decor but is clean and has a friendly atmosphere.  I find this place idle for hanging out with friends..although I didn't find it suitable for family. It's a must visit place for every alcohol lover  as i have been there many many times ......  this place kinds of attracts me.

This was a place I had not heard of for two years even though I was staying in Kolkata. This place is home to a select few. I was taken here by one of my friends during my last week in Kolkata. The atmosphere is so simple and the crowd is something totally different. You will end up coming across the entire intellectual crowd of Kolkata sitting and enjoying their drink reading some book or noting a diary. You might never expect this place to attract foreign client√®le but you will come across several foreigners here and ladies too make up quite a percentage of the crowd which is usually absent due to the crowd in other such pubs. 

The food is nothing great, but try their egg dishes, they are quite OK. One thing for sure is that you are sure to hit a conversation with the person on the table beside you. This is the Olypub culture

Olypub was this refreshing blast from the past. Even the prices were delightfully low! I wouldn't say the food was all that great, but the entire experience itself had such a happy feel to it that I can't help rating it a 4. 

The servers seemed like they were from the '80s and made me feel like I had stepped right into a Mithun-da movie. 

If I ever do visit Cal again, Olypub will certainly be seeing my face :)

Recently visited Oly Pub after a long time. It was late college days when we used to come here. But I was utterly disappointed this time. Don't know whether my taste changed or it was because of the same un- improved, shoddy ambience of the place.
I went there with 7 of my friends. There were 3 ladies in our group. That's why we chose oly pub. One big advantage with this place is you can always go with your girlfriend or colleagues as you can find numerous girls here.
As we entered, we found the place to be  immensely crowded. A waiter greeted us with utter rudeness just to make his own way from first floor to ground floor. We found the gents toilet to be clean, but the ladies toilet very much soiled.
The status of the crowd on the ground floor was not upto the mark. On the first floor, it was ok.
Now the drink and food. Waiter came to us after quite a while, we ordered 4 Smirnoff, 1 kingfisher blue and one breezer, lime cordial and sprite.  With utter surprise, they didn't give separate glasses, poured alcohols in the same empty water glasses, which were just the old shabby ones and not that clean too. Now, no sign of sprite and ice cube. Aftet a good 10 minutes when we started to make some noise, the waiter banged a whole bucket, full of ice cubes and sprite on the table. I was really annoyed.
Now we ordered dry chilli chicken, butter and plain nan and chicken butter masalla.
Dry chilli chicken was punchy in taste, but it was cooked in street-style and was Not looking or smelling premium. Nans were okies. But, the disaster was the chicken butter masalla. It was very bland in taste and was very casually cooked. Bill came around 2200. Ok... But china town gives a much better ambience, food quality and better service. After that day, will never visit there again.

Legendary food joint in Park Street. Mostly known for the continental items along with beer, the standard definitely fell from when i visited last time. Still serving one of the best steaks in the city at a pocket friendly price maybe their usp but the A la kiev which was a hit previously tasted rather blunt when i visited yesterday. Though they have a list of beers in the menu list, we were told only 2 variants were available inspite we visited rather early (by 7.30 pm). The waiters have turned surprisingly rude and un cordial and we had to literally yell at them several times to order or to ask for the bill. Maybe 5 years ago, i would have given a 4 or 4.5 rating but this time i wasnt really satisfied..hence 3.

This is a calcutta landmark. that been said, the food is not great! it is reasonably edible though and very affordable. the main attraction here is the cheap booze. you can go with a bunch of friends and tank up without spending half your salary. with that being the main aim, the food is just an additional perk. 
the service is mostly prompt and waiters are pleasant. 
a word of warning, if you want to be seated right away, do not attempt to go to oly on a weekend, or if you must do the weekend, ensure that you are there by 7pm. or the wait is likely to be close to an hour.

I love this place. It has a sense of nostalgia and heritage to it. The drinks are quite affordable and the food is amazingly tasty for a pub. I love the beaf steak, which probably still is one Kolkata's best. I just wish they'd renovate the place a little. The waiters are not very friendly to be honest. That said, I"d recommend this place to anybody. It sort of has that coffee house feel to it where instead of the coffee you get booze. All in all, I still love this place and I'm sure you will too if you're planning to catch up with an old friend over a couple of beers maybe.

Atlast i got a chance of visiting this traditional favourite of students frequenting park street. I didnot quite like the ambience but according to my friend that is the best ambience they want while drinking.The place is always packed. They don't serve cocktails. Prices are reasonable. I was not intending to eat anything but my friend insisted that coming to olypub and not tasting beef steak is a wastage of time. Well this is quite evident with the number of photos being uploaded of it on zomato. N really it was tasty. Also, you get beer only in bottles here. I heard that friday evenings are always full with the whole calcutta high court crowd. Recommended.

Let's say this is the Coffee House which allows you to drink: the ambiance is the essence of this place. You will definite to feel few many years younger the moment you step into this darkish looking proper pub-atmosphere. The din and bustle only adds to the light headedness that alcohol alone can never bring!

Olypup! A place which attracts all the collage students to go there and grab a beer. I went to this place around 5 times and when ever I go I order that mouthwatering Chicken Ala Kiev and a beer. The Ala Kiev is just a class apart, served with mashed potatoes and green peas. But the secret inside the Ala Kiev is way more delicious. The interior is old fashioned and the waiters are eager to get tips. So to me Olypub is a hell of a place.

Dont ever visit Oly for food or to just drink. There are many joints which are way better than this if eating and drinking is in your mind. Its not clean and the interiors are old. Then why did I give it a four? Because Oly is one of a kind. There is no such joint in Calcutta which can be Olypub. You go there to experience the people, the down trodden yet one of a kind feel that is so very Cal. College kids, the regular lonely drunkard, the musicians on a corner, the intellectual addas, the beef steak and beer...or the Ala Olympia... this eclectic mix is not available in any other joint that I have been at...and I stand by it... and the best Oly signature, the waiters overflow the Peg Measurer and there's always that extra bit of booze in your share. Now isnt that amazing.

Famous for old world charm but now costs have increased and food quality and quantity has decreased. Beef stake is smaller and costlier. Now they have stopped people from smoking in the balcony as well. Better bars can be availed for the same price.
I rated it low but  i still visit often, not due to the food or drink they serve but due to my memories attached to the place.

Am a sucker for cleanliness. So the first thing that struck me as negative about Olypub, was its interiors and the maintenance. I could literally feel the springs as I sat on the couch. But the good part about Olypub is that after a few drinks these problems will stop bothering you. Haha. :-) 
Their fish finger is awesome and so is the beef steak. Its great to go to Olypub in large groups. Its fun that way and the people tend to stare less ( unfortunately you will get a lot of glances girls).

I have been to this place perhaps 2-3 times.Had a beer and some steaks. The steak was aweful. The service was bad with some demanding waiters(more tips). Everytime we were made to wait for 10-15 mins before the waiter attended us, not to mention we had already called them thrice in this 10 mins. Frankly speaking its an overhyped place all because of its location "the park street". People only visit because of its "name", otherwise the adjacent bars are kinda better with some low price too.

Overcrowded pub with weird waiters-the Indian Coffee House on alcohol- that's Oly for me. Cheaper than others in the neighbourhood, and a one off place to get hammered if collective unconsciousness is your thing. Still cheaper pubs are there in the city like Raoul's in Hazra and Calcutta Greens in Highland Park but it's only here you get the Park Street ambience.

In college days we used to enter tantra after boozing in olypub.  Its very hard to get tables in weekends. if manage to have one surely try Chilly Chicken, Chilliy Mutton roasted mutton pork sausages and Chicken Ala Kiev. Meet you in OlyPub.

I had my first official drink in OLY pub. We were on pocket money and needed a cheap place. Our reason for choosing OLY was that simple. It is not that of a posh clean pub but its friendly and the ambience is good for a Bengali 'adda'. The food is what i love the most. A La Kiev is yummy. A La Oly pub is little sticky but it leaves a good taste in mouth. I have seen people going crazy on the steak.
Word of Caution:If you have that thing for snobby bar you will cringe on entering here.
To sum up: If you want a place where you wanna chill out for hours and get drunk and want all this to be cheap and yet safe, Oly pub should be right there on top of the list.

Oly is just the place that most people searching for cheap rinks and good food would opt for. It has a charm of its own and the age of the place adds to it. Although  I am slightly distasteful of the shabby surroundings, Oly no matter what is always the first thing that comes to my mind when there is a plan to go out for drinks. 
Oly has reasonable tax inclusive prices for liquor and what makes you revisit that place time and again is the delicious juicy beef steaks, the chili prawns and the buttery chicken alakiev. If you are going to oly Pub anytime soon do NOT miss out on these three dishes for sure. Their beef steaks are one of the bests in town :)

Decor: Located in the heart of park street, one f d legends out there.
Bt its not that legend any more. Interior is relatively shabby n not upto the mark. 
AMBIENCE: People hang out with lots of friends for long period of time. But waiters are always hankering for tips and sometimes doesn't listen to you.
FOOD: Beef steaks n chicken ala kieve are amongst the famous items. Beef can sometimes be a little tough.
CONCLUSION: One of the pocket friendly place to hang out with friends for food n drinks.

To be true Olypub is not an ordinary joint. Its not just a simple watering hole where you can get alcohol cheap & spend a few hours sozzled away. Olypub seems to be a cultural turnstone in Calcitta's alcoholic history. One of the earliest pubs in town, this place in park street is where a lot of us have started our drinking careers. It is not a clean, courteous, welcoming place where you can have a sophisticated drinking session in a calm & serene manner. But it is a place that celebrates this city's love for adda culture and indulges and embraces it heartily. Maybe that is the reason the place has seeped so deep into so many Calcuttan's fond memories and nostalgia and it continues to do so for the current generation as well inspite of all the rodents and cockroaches you might find crawling about.

If you are a newcomer willing to try the place for the first time, do remember the key phrase here is the charm. Not from the decor or the ambience (which are very average by today's standards) but from the feel and the diverse range of people around you being themselves. Its a melting pot and if you are interested in people and life and stories, you'll find those here.

The alcohol is cheap (but not the cheapest in the city) and the range of drinks available are the very basic. Do not expect exotic or high range drinks here. Popular demands rule. Try the Chicken ala kievs, mixed grills, the epynomous beef steaks or the liver masalas. They are inconsistent on a few occasions but on the average the food accompanied with the drinks are delicious and just perfect. 

The waiters can range from endearing to obnoxious depending upon the time of the evening and the amount of tip you decide to pay. You keep them happy and you can get away with almost anything :)

Rounding up, its not a place for everybody but if you are interested in the city and its people and its culture, do visit and spend a couple of hours here relaxing. Olypub has a knack of growing on you and enriching you with happy memories.

Completely biased about this place cause this is where we grew up chilling. Of late though Olypub has turned into a tourist spot of some kind, contributing to the deteriorating ambience. The waiters are still as quirky,occasionally sweet and mostly efficient. The food is decent- smaller portions though. Try the chilli paneer. Its worth it. Can't say much about the much famed beef steak since I dont have meat, though my friends think it's still the best in town.

Good ol' Olypub! However much I try I cannot be objective about certain things in life, I love them unconditionally. Olypub is one of those places. However much the ambience may stink and the service may slack, it remains really special.

A good spot on park Street to get drunk cheap. You will find a lot of nostalgic locals hanging out, having beer and waiting for some place else bands to start playing. Pros: dirt cheap cons: old dirty setting.

Been there twice. I think third time is not going to be the charm. There are better places to get a feel of old Calcutta than this one on park Street. Keep exploring.

This review has been long pending, especially considering the number of times I have been to this place. Firstly one needs to understand clearly that Olypub is probably a B or C grade place but make no mistake it creates A grade memories each and every time one goes there. Each and every time has its own story. The place itself has an air of nostalgia about it. The attire of the waiters, the seating arrangement and the carpet on the AC floor but my favourite item of nostalgia is the peg measures of that the waiters use.
Talking of waiters, let me share a small anecdote. Once a friend, who is quite a character, referred to random waiters as Kaka. I said, "Chill, all tables have designated servers and ours is not around." His reply, "Dhur, chhar toh je mod debe shei Kaka." (Whoever serves alcohol can be referred to as Kaka.) Since then I have always called them Kaka.
The booze was once relatively cheap. Due to that reputation people continue to be under the impression that Olypub is still cheap. Now it is more or less on par with other places. The service is average and ambiance is variable, meaning that one is likely to find a different ambiance every day. Drink anything that you are in the mood for on that particular day and order anything that you like. I would recommend the cocktail sausages and the fish fingers. The steak although a big chunk of meat is way below par and is always overcooked. What matters more than anything else on Olypub is your company. And believe you me Olypub is best enjoyed when one lands up there randomly. 
Don't miss out on the charm of this place. This is one of the Kolkata heritages. But as I said make sure that you have good company and fun company.

Visit this place for Beef Steak. Its tastes awesome. Though the beef may not be that tender on weekends but if you are lucky you may get the tastiest steak available in town. This is a cool hangout for people searching for cheap Alcohol. You may not like the retro/dirty ambiance but still the beef steak overshadows everything. The best bar in Park Street.

Not from Kolkata, so don't have stories to tell of my school/ college days, when I would stop by with friends for a cheap drink. However, its one of my favourite drinking joints in the city. 

I first witnessed servers bringing bottles n pouring at the table in olypub. The steaks used to be worth dying for, somehow they don't taste as good as they used to. Maybe I have graduated to better meat. But nostalgia is the key why people keep going back to this place for a drink. 

Considering the price of liquor, one might expect the patrons to be not up there - however that is not the case at olypub. Very popular with college & young office goers. 

It has this dingy alley which serves for smokers, leading upto a repulsive toilet.

Degraded extensively since the last time i had visited. To start things off they will not serve you drinks even if you appear to be less than 21. Also the food is average. The chicken ala keive being the only exception in the menu, definitely worth a try. Moreover the most upsetting factor is the bad service. Grumpy under paid men looking right through customers, do NOT render the best environment for a hearty meal with friends, Thumbs down.

Olypub, now, I feel is overhyped. And yes, we the students take the responsibility. This place anyways is to stay a student's favourite. Why? May be because of its lack of inhibition. Stay here with your group of buds over booze, food & be completely crazy-trust me, you will be tolerated-better still if u tip well. But now being out of the student zone, I really found the place a little, if I might say, uncomfortable. The ambience was never great nor did it matter, but then the last time I went for a nostalgic evening at oly's, I was just a li'l taken aback. The AC wasn't working, alright but then service was bad. Some new faces in the staff were pretty laid back & pretty pretty rude. Now, the age old problem of most brands & variants of poison not being available was still there. I am NOT complaining here-I am used to it. But my mutton steak still remains the same good old mutton steak! Go for the beef steak if you can. With the food you can go ahead with the steaks, the chicken ala kiev, the chicken liver masala-don't expect anything extraordinary & may be then you'll enjoy what everyone does-the olypub culture! I do miss the oly chanachur with my beer elsewhere.

Oly Pub = Nostalgia. College days, lecture bunking, mindless blabbering. Years later I still wonder why at all we went. The booze was not exactly cheap [considering it a primary reason that can draw college-goers]. The place looks old and ragged, the crowd is a mixed one. The food was not great either. My staple orders were cheese sandwiches which always came dry and unappetizing. The chicken fries were drenched in oil. And the beef steaks were not consistently good every time. Considering all the points, these days I am not drawn towards Oly at all. Yet the place continues to be a magnet for the college-goers and one must admit that many of my fond college memories are from this place.

Cheap in respect to location but service is very poor if u r not regular and good tipper.food is good not too good and only bar who gives good measurement liquors.they pour liquor in front of u so that no doubt remains regarding quantity.good for budget hence students.

Speaking ill of Oly is like spouting blasphemy to many but i believe they require a change in management. The place is well known to everyone who lives in Calcutta so there is no point describing the route. From the moment you enter this place the attendants are putting their hand out for a bribe, and they don't have any intention of acting discrete. 
Olypub can only be recommended to those who are in for a hangout and nothing more, the choice of your liquor is always limited, sometimes I often wonder why those items even show up on the menu. They should actually tell you the menu like one of those South Indian restaurants so that we don't get shot down on every request we make.
The food here is not so well recommended.
If you want to have a reunion or a birthday treat or just a jolly hangout this place is definitely one you should check out.

Rightfully said: A student's pilgrimage, a brooder's paradise, a jilted lover's salvo and lastly the place to lap up celebration of an event with one's best buds.
I visit this mecca of mine always accompanied by a group of noisy, giggling, mostly frustrated yet never short of wit/ sarcasm, creative,sulky, and outspoken lot of mature (?) nutcases! The bartenders/waiters (namely: headphone Kaku, and Bachchan Saab-the 6'5-ft tall uncle!!) know our gang so well that they serve us each our poison without us putting the order first! Even the manager who sits downstairs once offered to click a pic of our gang together, wobbling on our way out one Christmas eve 9:30 pm! The waiters will never ever disturb you and you are allowed to stay as long you want but soberly so. I have seen them being stern with people who are sometimes rogue and loud, or are too inebriated. Such instances are rare and those noisemakers are politely ousted any way. The crowd is mostly young, decent and otherwise quite comfortable an atmosphere around here. Doesn't mean you bring your family tomorrow evening already! You can, but inform me before turning up okay? I promise we will be there, at the most glasses of vodka/beer crammed table- with chanachur and fries crumbs scattered all over.. We always sit upstairs at the extended wing on right, seriously!
Other than the superb location and ambiance, consider the following:
Pluses: Cheap booze, Beef Steak (Oly Pub ka steak nehi khaya toh kya khaya?), Mutton steak, chicken cutlet, Chicken a'la Kiev, smoking zone(NOT ANY MORE :( ), unlimited sitting hour with free chanachur if you can't afford anything solid!
(once we spent a full 5 hours, on a NYE)
Minuses: Sandwich and finger fries (just don't dare order, or do if you want a good intoxicated fit of laughter). Not all flavor variants of Breezers are available, nor your favorite cold drink will be there. We often had to select a second or a third choice from the alcohol options in the Menu. Smirnoff is not available some day, the next day they would say Volga isn't. Same goes with beer brands sometimes.

It's cheap and student friendly, who cares for the rest! Have a happy time :)

This place has some charm about it! The interiors are quite ordinary. But for regulars, its a nice option to hangout. I had some wonderful experiences when people around the table join you and become part of your group. Plz note these people are no intruders, but usually are quite talented people in one way or another. 

Its almost impossible to find an entry on weekends. So don't even think if going there on weekends!

A good place to drink but not a good place to eat.
Service is very slow which makes it a perfect place for Long Addas!!
Many prefers beef steak but i dont really like it over there!!
There is no luxury to choose your drinks! They have their basic set of drinks! You can't even get a Bacardi (flavoured) over there! You have to stick to the basics!
One thing is true for this place, If you love it, you will visit again and again! And I simply love this place , no matter what inconveniences they offer! Its is a very good place for reunions! And me and my friends often gather there over a beer and enjoy chatting, sometimes even for the whole afternoon.

Olypub is more for the statement rather than the place. Seven friends wound up there one night, eager to get some food and booze  in their systems. At first, the wise waiter saw our faces, and suggested we sit below, since AC wasnt working upstairs. We did not listen. We went upstairs and crammed ourselves in a table for four.

And we drank a good bit. The service was slow and we did not get our standard plate of chanachur.. The food was mostly greasy. We had ordered fish fingers and chicken fry. They came with a tomato omelette for a friend, and then one of my friends spilled her drink (Yes, I am looking at you C). However, the waiter cleaned it up all the same. Soon, we felt that it WAS pretty hot, but we still lumbered on till nearly ten before taking our leave. 

Our bill was around 1500/- after all this.


----- 09 Apr, 2013 -----

Okay, so first thing - I like the service here. If you guys are going to rant at me, go ahead. This place has a history of being one of the first places in Park Street I went to, and that too for the beef and the chicken liver. At Oly, you might see a cat suddenly peering at you from a tiny ventilator, or a group of random people bursting out singing all of a sudden. And oh, watch out for the times when the server tries to fleece you by adding up all the values already taxed, and then add a "special tax" to it. Thankfully, a bit of level-headedness can get you out of it, and when you need to chill with a bottle of beer, some good company and a plate of chicken sandwiches or a beefsteak, this is your baby.

Personal recommendation - go for the chicken liver, fried, after five in the evening.

Its been 1.5 years since I first typed down a review for Olypub, just after my second visit there and I wrote as a distant observer.Over some time now, I have grown to love Oly (the fond nickname this place goes by), It is quintessentially Calcuttan, a cursory visit will not make it a experience, but keep coming back and you will get suffused in all its intimate charm.
The waiters will come to know you, they will flash a knowing smile when you order your drink, remember your table preferences,slip in a little chit chat : all the little things that makes memories.
The place, strictly speaking has no ambience.. the chatter of the people, and the odd toppa gaan from a veteran  makes up for it.
The drinks are  cheap,though i wish they would extend a larger selection.While the beef steak is not bad on some days, there are days it turns out to be hard and chewy, and I will never like the boiled peas that goes with it.My choice remains the chicken a la olypub.. batter fried chicken doused in creamy sauce served with butter fried bread..a calorie-laden bliss.You can go for the a la kiev too if super crusty chicken bomb with butter inside is your thing.. hate the cocktail sausages.Also this place is a real disaster if anyone chooses to go veg(like I did for some days ) : absolute dearth of options,the french fries were awful.
If you just let go off these small inconveniences, you will enjoy the  light-headed long discussions,  those evenings at Oly will tip-toe into your fond memory space.
As Vir Sanghvi famously proclaims: 'Calcutta grows on you', so does Oly.



----- 27 Oct, 2012 -----

Its good when you accept it as aplace to drink and chat,neither a family hangout or lovers hotspot,its best for a drink with friends.
The ambience obviouly is not nice,however the crowd here is not rowdy-a lady can go alone and enjoy her drink.
The waiters are not polite,the service is a bit late,also they are pointy if you do not tip generously.
The food is ok sort of,the chicken omlette had very less stuffing and the beef steak-not bad,but it was boiled potatoes and not mashed potatoes that came along with it,the peas were boiled in water to a great degree thus taking away the fresh sweet taste,the onions were not chopped or fried well leading to a very unpleasant taste.Lastly do yourself a favor and do not order a lime soda.

Olypub for some reason is a legend. The place where all my out of city friends wants to visit. When I end up taking them to Olypub invariably this is the questions that I get to hear after they are inside Oly..."so when are we going to Oly ?"

Well Oly is old. Scratch that. Oly is ancient. My dad used to frequent Oly when he just moved into the city in the early 70's. And I have been frequenting it from the past couple of years.

Food wise Oly is definitely not the greatest option in Park Street. Most people have a thing for their Beef Stake and the Mixed Grill. But they are both strictly okay. I personally like the Chicken Ala Olupub which is Oly's version of the Grilled Chicken and I also like their Chicken Fries which are thick batter friend pieces of chicken with their bones. THey also make a mean Tomato Omelette. Here I must also mention their Mustard(Kasundi). It is strong to say the least and I love it with everything served in Oly.

Drinks are cheap but basic. You will not get any fancy cocktails. Order your drinks with your juice or cold drinks or order your beer. The servers will come with a measuring peg and they do not really bother if some extra is just poured into your glass.

The servers are rather grumpy and like to dump the order on the table unceremoniously. Once I spilled some drinks on the table and had to incur the wrath of an Oly waiter. The servers also magically transform to jovial smiling friendly waiters when I end up in Oly with my very white, very blonde friend S.

The chairs are plastic and the tables are old sturdy white tables with various stains.Also I have personally seen rats in Oly and it is well known that they have a cat for the rats.

But still Oly is a legend. It is difficult to find a seat even in the middle of a week. It is buzzing with people from every age group, and conversation and laughter and arguments. I am not sure why it is a legend ? Maybe because it is one of the oldest Pub, maybe for the once delicious beef stake, maybe because of the people or maybe it is a legend just because it is a legend.

One certain afternoon after my office hours, I was in mood for some beer, which I had last while I was in college. Yes I am not much of a drinker but I like to dabble at times. So I grabbed a colleague from my work and made our way to Olypub. The ambiance was beautiful at best, though I failed to note any old world charm as is mentioned in some reviews.
On entering our way upstairs we sat at the corner-most table of the room on the right sight side. The waiter there seemed lost and disturbed which showed during the time when he came to get our order. 

I ordered a Heineken (beer) , Chicken cutlet, Masala Kulcha, Butter Naan and Chicken Masala. The spread tasted absolutely fantastic.The Indian breads deserve a special mention for being lucidly soft and light they were.The cutlet was good and so was the Chicken masala. I was still not full and wanted some more...i mean food. So I called back the waiter and he started mumbling something God knows what. Whatever, he took the last order which was a bottle of water and a Chicken Omelette.
The chicken omelette was again pretty tasty... so in all the food tasted better than average for me clubbed with the beautiful ambiance it was.

Finally after spending close to 2 hours we decided to leave and the pinch was not too deep @close to Rs.900/-. It's a beautiful place to visit even for the non-drinkers. So in my opinion a visit to this place is recommended at least once.

The Olypub is one of those places... which either you will love or will never visit after your first one. So actually it completely depends on how your first visit to this place was and with whom. 
A very old 'heritage' of kolkata and is maintaining it's reputation so far....
When I was in Kolkata, during my college days... I used to hear about this place a lot through friends.. (being a mass comm student helped). One fine day, me and a couple of friends were dead hungry and were roaming the galis of Park Street looking for a place. We didnot had much money in our pockets, so were kind of looking for someplace cheaper.
Suddenly, our eyes caught the sight of Olypub and zoom we were inside in the next 5 minutes. 
....and I personally did not like it. It was full of smoke, noise (people chatting, laughing with their lungs out). Also, the table we got was a little dilapidated and I could see cockroaches moving on the floor as if their entire community has been hit by an earthquake.
Since we were already there I quickly ordered one chicken a la kiev  (i remember the name since I liked it too much and hence ordered), finished my food in like 15 minutes and rushed out. 
Though almost all my friends love this place.. somehow I could not dare to give this place another visit in so many years....

I just realised I have 56 pending restaurants to review. And to start with thr marathon session, I decided to begin with the happy memories of Oly Pub!

I went to this place at the age of 23...which is such a shame! if I had only known about their beef steak (coupled with the thought of a huge gang of friends and free flowing booze) I would've made it a point to not waste the previous five years. 

Lets be clear...oly is not posh. Its crammed. Noisy. Not exactly spotless. But its Oly! Sounding vague? Head over with a mad group (not a pret/couture one), let your hair down and then you'll understand! In a city that is screaming out for good pubs and bars, this one sure does quench your thirst!

"‚ÄéThose were the best days of my life" - My few first learning happened here in Olypub. The very first time, I visited this ever romantic, nostalgic, Park Street pub with one of my cousins. The very first look was a like the "Blue Dragon" pub in which Fantom (read Betal) used to go and ask for a glass of milk :) Let me first tell you about my learnings:
1. When the person pour a peg into your glass he is not bothered about the extra milliliter of alcohol dropped in your glass. 
2. Undoubtedly the best Beef Stake is sold in Kolkata.
3. In a restaurant, you do not have to be decent and scream if you want :)

I had fallen in love with this joint from that day. And after almost 16 years, it remained as one of my favorite destinations. 

Love Olypub. Those who have not visited this place, am sure had missed one of Kolkata's essential elements of pure joy. Take my advise - go there with your best friend - you will enjoy the place much better.

Oly is an over rated pub to be very honest.But it has always been special and always will be as its pocket friendly and nostalgic, located at the heart of the city.The beef steak is worth trying.Beer is served in regular glass and may not be very chilled.The service is not so great and the place is not so tidy.So if you are looking for a place to crash in with your friends and get drunk without making a big hole in your pocket,this is the best place else not.

Firstly, I have given this a 3.0 by killing most of the nostalgia! Now for the review from the heart!

College days: Booze at Oly, Eat chicken rolls from Kati/Kusum and then rock at Someplace Else. That was our routine.

I love the beef stake here. The chicken a la kiev is also alright. The mutton chop is simply awesome to taste.

The booze is served in regular glasses and the beer is sometimes not cold enough. You often do not get the booze you desire. 

That said, this place is full of heritage. All the rockers who visit the city have at least once drunk in Olypub. All the intellectuals have as well. The service may be bad and the ambience may be raucous but this is a pub with history on its side. So keep your sophistication caps at home and just take the plunge at least once. Other times you shall judge for yourself!

Being located at the  heart of Park Street and with the prices of alcohol being one of the lowest in the city, Olypub is a great place to hang with your friends and family. 

Not so good on the ambiance and mood. Beer isn't served in mugs but in glasses. The beef steak which was once its USP has gone down in quality and taste.

The delicacies of chicken still remain top notch. 

The anglo feel of this bar is still intact.

What can i say. Not accepting Credit cards takes a lot of courage under the hood. And they have it. Why? Because of their simply EXCEPTIONAL food. Its like a cult restaurant which has nothing more to prove to its thousand of fans.

Decor - Very Mediocre.
Food - Excellent (some special dishes which are not available anywhere else).
Service - good.
Crowd - Very laid back and relaxing.

Olypub Beef Steak has acquired a legendary status and righfully so. the tender meat with mashed potatoes and a poached egg on the top is something you will get addicted to. Compliment it with a bottle of Kingfisher and nothing else matters. You will be in food paradise. Smoking inside is allowed. So don't forget to carry a pack.

Chicken Olypub is their trademark dishe and it is definitely one of the best chicken preparation i have ever tasted. Soft chicken thigh meat with deep fried bread on a base a mashed potatoes loaded with butter and boiled peas.

Chicken Ala Kiev is a in house specialty. Its big balls of chicken deep fried with melting butter inside. Simple sinful addiction.


Have these 3 dishes along with beer. Trust me you will definitely visit again and become a part of the cult. A restaurant that was and always be one of kolkata's best hangouts.

Pricing -- Very cheap. for an idea, all the above and 3 beers would cost 600 bucks. 100 each.

Worst place to drink. Worst service. Service is the priority when you think of boozing.Even you cannot feel relax over there nor you can talk properly with the companion you are with, it is so noisy(like fish market).  Believe me, there are countless bars in Kolkata, where you can have better service, better ambiance, better food quality (I mean whatever we need during drink) at much cheaper rate (or at same rate). God knows why people visit over there (is it just because of PARK STREET...??).

I have been going to this place since college days. I remember their service being better and the place much cleaner too. But after almost 2 years i went there recently. The experience was horrible!! The staff seemed to be on their own trip and the service was extremely slow. They had a bunch of mid aged old men who seemed to be their regular customer which is why they got places even though we were waiting for almost half n hour. It was dirty with rats running under the tables. The beef steak and the mixed grill which i loved always was also below standard. The place is nostalgic since i spent alot fo time their during college days but i dont wanna go back anymore.

Uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters, everyone around would  mention this place at least once to you and go gaga over the beef steak. Really not that awesome if you ask me. Sometimes you get truly tender meat with a perfectly done sauce and at times you are simply left guessing the age of the cow that has been served to you. 
If you're a regular at this place, you're treated differently and well if you ask me, the waiters here seem more keen on serving the ones who frequent this place more often. They try to retain the old nostalgia and that explains why we don't see much changes in the sitting arrangements and ambiance of this place. 

Not that many people come here for food essentially, but for a simple dissection, here's what I feel.
Chicken ala Kiev- Too bland for my taste albeit buttery and crisp. 
Mixed Grill platter- Earlier, it would be two solid chunks of liver and the plate would come loaded with sausages, the quantity has gone down sinking along the taste and quality with it.
Chicken ala Olypub- This I can die for, and they continue to serve it decently though sometimes you can expect an indifferently salted dish. Grilled chicken breast that is served in a bed of cream sauce with dollops of cheese, mashed potato, and two slices of toasted bread.
Fish Fingers- The last time I ordered a plate, I did not find the fishes fresh enough leading to complete disappointment.

To pull it off finally, one can surely try this out for cheap booze and the crisp munchies and of course to feel the 'old nostalgia' but you can simply skip the option of ordering something that heavy.

An age old watering hole. Was staying at the Oberoi Grand (too expensive to have a drink there) and being a thursday (for some reason I was told that liqour shops are closed on thursdays). I had no other choice within walking distance. 

But since then have been here a number of times, simply because of the location and prices.
Ambience: None to talk about. Shabby chairs and tables. Dirty old ash trays (smoking was allowed then)
Service     : Pathetic.
Bites          : They do give a plateful of some bites for free. But best avoided.
Prices        : Really cheap.
Drinks       : Variety on the menu is good. But when ordering, many of the drinks are not available. There usually are very limited brands of beers available. 
Food          : The menu looks good. Loved by many of the regulars here. But being critical ...it is just about ok.
The specialities being: Beef steak, chicken a la kiev and mixed grill platter. Understandably cheap, but then thats what you get. Cheap food. Just about palatable and not to remember.
Crowd        : Definitely not for the family outing. Frequented by college  students and office goers from the nearby areas, in for a quick bite and cheap drinks.

On the whole, just ok for a quick drink, and then do walk out for a better meal.

Olypub on Park Street is perhaps the most popular watering hole for beasts like us. It serves no-nonsense food and alcohol at very easy-on-pocket prices, the service is laid back and environment loud. You will find the door open and close every 10 seconds as people either go out for a smoke or come in finishing one, not to mention the crowd that is always there. The chairs are old yet cosy although the sofas on the 1st floor could do with a bit of renovation. The tables are small, stout and firm and the waiters are all known by their first names. 

This is one of the few places in the city where you can have a beef steak and also serves excellent old style cocktail sausages, fish finger and finger chips. The boiled peas is a simple yet great starter and you can have a wide selection of alcohol- starting from beers to whiskey and rum and vodka.... the works. A nice, laid back, old world charm envelopes the place and one can actually sit there alone and soak in the ambience. A great place no doubt.

If you don't have any problem in eating beef.. just ask for beef steaks here. They are superb. But I am on the problematic side so always go for chicken, chicken ala..they are nonetheless delicious. Ambience - perect for pubbers (not for a family visit) especially if you are there with friends for adda. A relatively shabby place. Reach there before the seats are taken. It is crowded because of its quality cum price factor. Best place for me. 

Go for the beer and the steaks/roast and just have a gala time. Enjoy!

Have heard a lot about this place. People have always said I must be there at least once. Though I am not a racist but I always had some doubts regarding going to that place. However, finally visited there with some friends. Thank god most of the friends were accustomed with the ambiance. When initially I thought it is a shabby place they helped me to enjoy the place. With beer, bacardi and adda in a "not so posh" place was immensely enjoyable. we all forgot our etiquette while talking loudly. It was good. But you must not go there with family.

"Let's have some chat over a drink or two! " that was the call from a few friends.. and who can serve it better and without burning a hole in the pocket.. of course Oly Pub.. 

The beef steak is something to fall in love with.. more loving is the Chicken A La Kiev and the Fried Chicken.. and then there is cheap liquor.. what more does one need.. 

Ambiance is what you can say quite buzzing and cheerful..you can laugh and chatter away without a scrunched eyebrow from the adjacent table...  But a strict no no for family outing.. 

If you are a student, religious follower of beef steak and beer.. then Oly has to be your pilgrimage..

I had heard about this place quite a few times from my friends. So decided to visit it. And I must say I was not disappointed.  Though it's ambiance is not that great. But it is a good place to hang out with friends and get drunk. Liquor is quite cheap. But they should work on their servicing. We had to wait a lot to place our orders once. I loved the hamburger steak with chilled beer! Its a good place for youngsters. Its cheap and the food is good too. Its a YES for me! People should visit this pub to have some quality time with friends! :)

Been there. Done that. 

The much talked about beef steaks and beer combination is served at none other than Olypub.
Olypub is a very renowned place in Park Street where people usually come to have beef steaks and yes , beer!
I did not have the first but I definitely had the latter.
Do not expect fine ambience at Olypub. Firstly, it is not posh. Prices are pretty moderate. I mean 70/-  for one pint of beer is way affordable, that too in an area like Park Street.
Olypub has its own crowd which often is not very polished and I am not a racist :P

Just being honest. Olypub can give you a good time over steaks and beer with friends. Its a NO for family outings.
It is usually buzzing with people and yes its just basic clean and decent. Nothing great so do not have high expectations from this place.

But for leisure, yes I would suggest :)
Its is VERY easy on the pockets. So do not think twice before visiting but a big NO for posh freaks! 

Cheers!

One of the cheapest pubs in Kolkata that too at such a prime location. Liquor is on the cheaper side and the food quality is good too.

Most of the times that I've been here, I ordered beer and chicken cutlet which go perfectly together for me. The one time I was adventurous enough to try the beef, I was treated to a badly cooked piece. The meat was rubbery and I had a hard time trying to tear it even with my hands and teeth!

The tandoori they make here is tasty and well cooked. I would recommend not to order a main meal here and just side dishes mostly because this is a pub!
But I love this place because it's quiet inside, the waiters are responsive and alcohol always lightens my mood !

One of the most famous bars in Kolkata. It's also reasonably cheap with a vintage feel all over the place. It kind of makes you nostalgic at times. The red uniforms of the bartenders, the old ceilings, dim lights, they itself makes you feel intoxicated. Talking about alcohol, you get pretty much everything here. Sometimes, you can get Budweiser also. 

Coming to the food, which I enjoy much more than the alcohol is the steaks. Believe me or not, they will just blow you. This place is in fact famous for steaks here. So, if you're coming for the first time definitely go for the steaks.

Smoking inside is not allowed. So if you have to smoke you got to come outside.

I visited ‚ÄòOlypub‚Äô with my friend Soumitra Kumar Sahoo and its one of the cheapest pub in my knowledge. I have been to this place a number of times. This is where you get alcohol at much cheaper rates compared to other pubs and bars. It‚Äôs the best place in the city to booze, with friends. Ordered drinks are poured right in front of you from the respective bottles in proper peg measures. Olypub used to be famous for its Chateau Briand, Chicken A La Kiev, Chicken A La Olypub and the Mixed Grill. We ordered ‚ÄòChicken A La Olypub‚Äô along with the drinks. It tastes quite good and just melted in my mouth. Hygiene is not a priority here, and so is the decor or ambiance. If you got a tight pocket yet you're looking for good food and cheap drinks do visit this place located just ahead of the park hotel.

We ordered ‚ÄòChateau Briand‚Äô & 'Mutton Hamburger Steak' along with the drinks. 'Mutton Hamburger Steak was quite disaster, quality and quantity both deteriorate. Chateau Briand quality was same as before but I felt quantity was less :(

Olypub is the place to be, if you are looking for a quick booze at Park Street.

A lot of nostalgia, drunken-ness and beef steak, thats olypub in a nutshell.
The booze here is cheaper than any other place in Park Street, hence college go-ers find instant solitude inside. The menu isn't too extensive but there are a few items that you can certainly look in to. 
 
Chick-A-La Kiev is served at Olypub and is one of the best things that you finnd here, chicken deep fried in a pretty battter, with  butter oozing out as you take a bite. A perfect compliment for your drink.
The Beef steak, is perhaps the best beef steak that you get in the city. The portion of beef is large and the steak is grilled to perfection. It is soft and full of flavour. It is served with steamed peas, mashed potatoes and mushroom, thus providing a proper texture. Altogether at the given price, it is a must must try!

Apart from these two, you can also try the Chilli fish, the fresh fish is sure to appeal to your taste buds. 
People come to Olypub to drink and get high, but Olypub can get you high without spirit if you know what to order. So grab your drink, or a bottle of beer, order food and Bottoms up!

chicken ala oly pub and beef steak is the fav. item of mine.

Young ppl like us would be crazy about olypub ! We all know what they serve, but what you might not know is that, they serve is generously and at the cheapest range ! They crowd smells young and decent, with the buzz of college goers all the time. Coming to the food, I never had beef, but most of them claims it to be one of the best in the world ! I loved their Ala Keiv ! This place would alwaz rank one of the best in my list of "eat-outs" at Kolkata.

Olypub is like a little england in india. this whithered lil place dates back to british raj times, and serves the best beef stakes...atleast use to. People do often find it shabbyand out of place amongst the glittz and shine which tbe other hubs at par street offers but then for all te inyellectuala,college students,artists thus is THE PLACE to be. You get the feel of yester years whener you are served water in one of those glass bottles and boy do i love it. Always a pleasure to grab a beer there with close chums.....thought i am not a beefer...still my friends do vouch for its steak...though the quality did go down in years. But the alakuve and reshmi kebab and my favourite muxed grilled steak is a hit pudding out of oven on christmas eve for me.

Always hang out with my friends at the olypub either just getting a booze or may be for a quality food. The main attractions of this place is the beef steak and the chicken ala kiev mouth watering and very tempting awesomely delicious. But still the bottomline amongst all of the growing restaurants it needs to upgrade and maintain itself so as to survive among these fast growing fast food chains and outlets.

This was "The Pub"  of my college life, me along with two of my 'chuddie buddies" would meet up there and have fun,"adda" etc  over our ever loyal beef steak or chicken-ala-kiev & a cold pint of thunderbolt or tuborg. Fights over the last piece of "chili fish" was mandatory. :) At that time OLYPUB was holy to us.

However with a heavy heart, i am to say that the beef steak has lost its charm, taste & a bit of quantity too. And once i also witnessed a new member of the staff running around the floor, it was none other than 'Jerry the mouse".

Though it should get a 2.0, i am giving it a 2.5 based on sentimental values & old memories.

When I think olypub, I switch off my brains about every other pub, therefore about ambience, quality of service, and the fine details that basically go into a review. It is olypub, the good and bad times of everyone's pocket. The beef steak is undoubtedly the winner in the food category, followed by mixed grill and chicken a la olypub. The food here is addictive with an unique taste and texture of its own. It need not be the best ever but something that is just available here. So when I crave olypub, I crave nothing else. 
Live life king size over food, friends, long hours of chat and booze is the mantra of olypub. Everytime I go to olypub, it is a lightheaded honest love affair!! Olypub, tu tera hain, par mera hain!

Recently tried their Fish finger and Chicken Ala Kiev. I really liked both these dishes and tasted pretty much like it used to taste several years back. The service we got around 11 at night was also very decent. Hence revising the rating to 3.5 :) 

----------
I believe that Olypub is one of the most primitive watering holes in Calcutta. It has served to quite a few famous personalities from Bengal and elsewhere. Olypub is as famous as its patrons but unfortunately all these things are of the past. I used to be a regular here during my college days though my college was not anywhere near Park Street, but me and my friends always used to hang out at Olypub for few drinks before or after hitting Someplace else for a gig (usually Cassinis Division or Hip Pocket). Gone are those days .. sigh.!! 
Recently visited olypub after a very long time and sadly loads have changed. The staff has changed, the ambiance and crowd is not exuberant anymore.
Located just beside the Park Hotel, Olypub is spread into two floors. The ground floor used to be the stags section and the 1st floor used to be a family section (if you have a lady as a company), but I guess that rule does not apply any more as we saw a ladies group seated downstairs. Ambiance is nothing to write home about. Its just the pre historic charm that brings me back to the place. To be frank, the decor and seating is pretty shabby. During peak rush hours, you might be asked to share a table with fellow diners. On weekends the place is packed right from afternoon.  I visited around 3 pm and it was packed ! 
Food and Drinks : Olypub is a basically a place to drink where food takes a back seat ! Drinks are cheap, at least the cheapest in Park Street Area. A 650ml bottle of beer(Tuborg) is priced around Rs138. Whisky - 60ml (Signature) is priced at Rs118. White Rum is priced at Rs98. Best part is that the drinks are poured right in front of you from the respective bottles in proper peg measures!! 
Olypub used to be famous for its Beef Stake, the chicken Ala kiev and the Mixed Grill. Unfortunately none of them taste the same. Atleast Beef stake and Chicken Ala kiev is not the same anymore. You may try it but for people who used to be regulars out here several years back will be majorly disappointed ! Food is priced reasonably and the price ranges from Rs 100-200. But the munchies mixture that is accompanied with  the drinks is still my favourite ! :) 
Service: The service has gone down as well. The waiters(chachas as we used to call them) have changed. They expect a large tip all the time and you need to keep them reminding about the food order otherwise they are most likely to forget ! Also, Cash is the only mode of payment which is a big negative ! 
Keeping aside so many negatives, I will be back to Olypub with my friends to re live my college days and enjoy cheap drinks and nostalgia at the heart of Park Street ... forgetting everything else in the world !

Situated at the heart of Park Street and easy conveyance make its my fav place to hangout with friends. If you are going on Sat or Sun evening expect a waiting time of at least 20-30 min. No other pub or bar can serve at such economical rate at such posh area. What i love the most about the place is the waiter will come to your table with bottle and the peg measure glass and pour it until it overflows. We ordered Mutton boti kabab, chicken A La kiev and Fish finger.It will take some time to serve the food but in the mean time one can enjoy drink and chat. Mutton boti kabab was awesome , fully tendered and soft. chicken A La kiev was also good. A must visit place for all drink lovers.

I give this place 4.5 because of what it means to most of us. THE PLACE to hang out with friends and have a few drinks and of course the very famous beef steak. The place has a old world charm which i love. The prices are damn reasonable. Though all the brands of beer are not available most of the times, the rest of the drinks menu is almost always available. ( i have never ordered scotch here hence can't comment on that). The beef steak which i order every single time i go, is the best i have tasted. Mocambo, a few doors down the street, also serves the dish, but its not as good as the one u get here. another dish that one might try is the Chicken A La Kiev. Though u get better versions of this dish in other places, still its a good one. I would rather suggest anyone not to order any other dish while there. The ambiance is great. The cigarette smoking area on the 1st floor is one good adda zone too..
I keep going back to Olypub and will keep going there in future.

The place is definitely nostalgic,with a coffee house kind of ambience all around.  Definitely you wont take someone on a date there but you can always hang around with your old friends.  
Its relatively cheaper than the other restaurants in the vicinity .

Its a nice place for office goers .

And yes there is a wonderful preparation called "CHICKEN ALA KIEV" ....that has to be a trademark...

For the first time goers (just try it out) .

Olypub reminds you of those dingy pubs in the U.K. where youths go for a night of pub crawling and immerse themselves in alcohol, where the general culture says "happy-go-lucky" or rather "extremely laid back". Here the servers are half drunk and the food is often cold and lousy. Still can't complain as food is not the first thing people have in mind while visiting the place. Their famous beef steak didn't appear too appealing to me as it was cold and chewy. The servers are laid back and looks least interested in serving than hogging large sums of tips from the visitors, not to mention, since a large group of foreign nationals religiously visit here. The crowd is a blend of all segments of people, the young, the old, the corporate slave and the foreigners. However, on second thoughts the food is not something you will despise. It is tasty and nice, you just need the right palette.

Waiters are old with stiff upper lip attitude, old style water tumblers used for booze serving, smoking corridor on the upper deck where you will find joint smokers easily, awesome beef steak (I know people will say they have had better)... these scattered pics may sum up Oly for you. Overall Verdict: Visit Recommended

OLY, Friends used to shout when we were in school , BOSS wanna have good quality beef steak and beer? 

never had the guts to bunk school and go all the way to park street from Salt Lake. Some being too much into religion, never visited the place and cursed whenever we said we are going to have beef . 

Jokes apart , 

CONS : 
1. Well Olypub is no more the same, The beef steak quality has fallen . It used to be supercool before !! 
The service is pathetic , More over that they will ask for extra tips at the end , who will pay more than 50 bucks on  a 500 rs bill? 
2. The steak arrives after 25-30 minutes of order  , by then an occasional drinker will finish one and half bottles of beer.
3. No of waiters too less for the no of tables.
4. They do not accept cards , So if you exceed your budget you have to come down and go to an ATM before you can pay.
5. Crowd is not that great .

PRO'S
1. You cannot expect cheaper rate of food and beer in Park Street Area.
2. Too much nostalgia associated with that place.
3. No matter how much you want to hate it for the service and all, if you are a little low on cash and want to grab couple of beers and some starters thit is probably the best place to be in !

Do not expect too much from it :) just go in there , booze , and come out. 

Ciao.

BURRP!

I remember I visited Olypub with our family friend Richard Gasper(principal, restaurateur , industrialist, rockstar) and of course Rozario (Michelin starred chef at Mango people) we did a gig at the park and were returning down park street and suddenly Richard Da tells us " cholo lets go and have some beef steaks" i said are your serious?!?!?!  he said yeah. But i can tell you that was my first experience with Olypub and its beef steaks, it has still maintained it standards although a decade has passed. The shittiest standards there can ever be.
Diluted alcohol, rude waiters, rats roaming around everywhere, management hiking up your bill once your drunk, loos with turd on the urinal. The usual fare at oly, but my last visit was truly outrageous !
This scoundrel was sloshed out of his mind and puked all over my table and my rich industrialist friend R. Gasper.
Outrageous ! I strongly urge everyone to stay away from this restaurant and come to mango people instead. 
It has top class food and low class prices. For aam junta, and if you're looking at boozing feel free to bring your own bottle.

Me and my bondhus were in a cab going down Park street, and my friend Jatin (the Jadavpur Student Union leader ) suddenly said lets go to olypub for some beef sticks. And I said are you serious? And he said ya.... So that is how we landed up in oly.

We all ordered the beef sticks and because of the student friendly prices we decided to order a few drinks. Due to the cheap prices we ended up drinking quite a bit of their substandard liquor. And when the bill came the waiter just scribbled something which none of us could read and just quoted a price! When we told him to bring a proper bill, he brought the same piece of paper again with a new number! After protesting about this we just paid a random amount and were about to leave when I felt pukish. Not finding any other place i just puked on the table next to ours. Judging by the taste of the beef stick it was good riddance to be honest.

I want to share a hilarious experience that happened to me at oly pub. I went there with my friends (total 6 girls) for a drink and a steak. 
Firstly i assure u, my experience was both hilarious and sad.
As we went there, we went to sit upstairs. most of us smoke, so we wanted to use the smoking balcony at the back side.
but to our utter dismay, the waiter, very ill behaved, told us to move downstairs coz the upper deck was only for gents and those women accompanied by gents.
so we had to have ourselves seated in the lower deck.
we ordered our drinks, when all of a sudden i noticed a huge cockroach in my friends shoulder. I warned her not to move coz i was talking an attempt to kill it. bt my friend in her utter curiosity, looked upon her shoulder and jumped off her chair.

there were 2 ladies sitting beside us. this cockroach flew and sat on the head of one of this lady. they were a little more boozed.  so they ddnt have a clue of what happened around. that cockroach made a comfort for itself on that lady's head.
we asked the waiter to shift our tables to the upper deck, but due to their general bad behavior, they didn't do that. 

so all we had left was with one option, ie pay the bill and leave. so we left the pub angry but yet laughing. :D

Olypub is reasonably good for college goers. Ambience is good for guys who love peeping at chicks for they will find girls in abundance. Price for the liquor is reasonable but the snacks being served with drinks is not upto the mark. The place is apt for a re-visit.

Why would anyone go to Oly? For the fact that there is that sheer bit of nostalgia associated with it. To be fair, the booze prices are reasonably cheap and you can actually spend you time here with old friends. The beef steak, It is not a great steak, but you don't to Oly for the quality of the food, it is for the memories.

Drinks and food? No thanks please. 
God knows what's the entire hype about this place, I found it horrible. The best part? The waiters ask you to give them MORE tip if you don't pay according to their wish. Amazing, no?

Oly Pub is a place where you get cheap drinks and tasty Beef steak!
The ambiance and service is pathetic!
And I'd like to mention that on a weekend evening it's really tough to get a place.Hence,go there early.

I guess it's okay for college students but once you start going to better places you won't really feel like going to Oly Pub again!

OLYPUB is situated in the most happening street of the city--'Park Street'... It has a perfect location. Ambience is good.. The place stinks tp a great extent , which a lot of people won't approve of ..The area is big enough. Menu card is fine. Service is so so. Crowd isn't that great. Rates are cheap so it wont dig a hole in one's pocket. there are rooms for improvements.

Once upon a time, Olypub was known as the Mecca of drinks on Park Street. It was here that college goers and young people would come to enjoy the cheap drinks and good food. Sadly, that era is a thing of the past now. The present day Olypub retains its interiors just as it was 10 years ago, but the service and the food has become a huge let-down, which has led many of its loyal customers to seek haven at the Trincas bar just next door. 

 I visited Olypub last Sunday with three friends. The doorman told us there was no available seats on the first floor (which could be expected, since it was after all, the weekend), but we went up anyway to wait. To our surprise, there were MANY seats that were empty, so we easily got seated. Funny how the doorman himself didn't know if places were available or not. We ordered the Chicken A La Kiev,  Mixed Grill, Chateaubriand Steak, Chilli Mutton, and Fish Reshmi Kabab, along with a host of drinks. Now the first minus point of Olypub is that, the drinks arrive in a minute, but one has to wait over 30 minutes for the food. So, as I noticed, either one has to wait till the food arrives to start their drinks, or re-order drinks when the food is served. We sat there, sipping soft drinks till our food was served to us. The chicken A La Kiev did have warm butter drizzling out of it, but we struggled to find chicken in the dish. It was mostly the bread and potato stuffing which made up the cutlet, giving it a bland flavour. The Mixed Grill, Chilli Mutton and Chateaubriand steak all had the same flavour base, which was hilarious. And what can I say about the Chateaubriand Steak?? This steak, which was once soft and succulent, easy to cut and chew, had the texture of rubber. All four of us struggled to chew it down. The mashed potato served with it was just plain boiled potato which did not even have salt in it. Same goes for the peas, which were simply boiled. The only saviour was the Fish Kabab, which was soft, flavorful and delicious.

In conclusion, if you wish to have a few drinks with your friends at cheap prices in a posh area like Park Street, Olypub is the place to go. But if you are hungry, this once famous place is not the place to be.

The first thing you notice about this institution on Park Street is the stench of stale beer and what might possibly be puke.
But its the best place in the city to booze, with friends. You'll not even realize how time passes by! The booze is cheap. The food is okay. 
The first time i visited Oly, was actually for the Beef Steak and not the beer. Their Chateau Briand (glorified beef steak ;) ) was once really good. They served it with mashed potatoes,and steamed veggies. Also they serve a special mustard sauce that goes really well with it.
But the quality of the beef steak has gone down. Really down. It's now a fraction of the size it used to be, mostly very tough and excessively chewy. It's not something I would recommend anymore.
Their mixed grill is pretty good.
But, it's a pub. Somewhere you go to drink with friends and have fun, or to drown your sorrows in alcohol, and as a pub it scores pretty well.
Go there for the cheap booze and the all round experience. Not the Food.
Recommended.

its very difficult to find a guy brought up in kolkata and not been to olypub. even with the bare minimum decor most unfriendly staff and a long list of non-availabilities. but a pretty cheap place to hang out or as like other kolkatan have an argument over anything under the sun. the beef steak is certainly the best food on the menu but the chicken ala keiv or even the chilli chicken are lip smacking!!

I have been to this place a number of times.The ambience is not great,the service is also not great specially when it is packed.The waiters are sometimes rude and ask for extra tips.
The food is quite good,specially the beef steak.The quality of the food does vary though.Sometimes specially when the place is crowded they serve food which is a little under cooked.But when they get it right,the food is very tasty.
But this place is not known for food or ambience or a family dinner.If you want a family dinner this is certainly not the place to be.This place is renowned for boozing.This is where you get alcohol at much cheaper rates compared to other pubs and bars.
In short,if you want to hang out with your friends,have alcohol for cheap and you cannot booze at home for whatever reason,then this is just the place to be.

I don't know what makes people speak very pretentiously of Olypub, but I can say from experience, it is far from the posh and cozy little pub I had expected it to be. Also, all you want from this place is a good beef steak, then do head somewhere else because it is utter disappointment.

One wintry afternoon, a bunch of us headed to Olypub to have a nosh and a tipple with high expectations. A couple of us ordered the much talked about Chateaubriand, while a few ordered the Chicken a la Kiev and the rest stuck to Chicken Butter Masala and Butter Naan. I have never been to a restaurant before where they fail so wholesomely that there's not a single good thing I can write about. The a la Kiev tasted too bready, and you know right away that there's as much bread in the cutlets as chicken. The Butter Masala too was ordinary. 

As for the beef steak, the less said, the better. The measly amount of potato mash, only a couple of slices of mushroom served along with it were disappointing. But that is nothing compared to what I experienced when I tried slicing the steak. It was tough as hide! There was barely a tablespoon of sauce on the steak and when I did manage to carve (and tear and bite) a slice off the steak, I took about five minutes to chew it into a tendon-y mush that could not be disintegrated further. My jaw was aching by the time I could finish. Never again. I'd rather have beef roll from dingy looking eateries than try another steak here.

To top it all off, the waiters were rude, lazy and actually had the gall to ask for a larger tip! How posh is that!

I think I managed to give this place 2 (after much deliberation, I must add) because the vodka soda highball was the highlight of my meal. But that's probably because the pub had nothing to do with its making, Vodka and soda were both manufactured products and we made the highball by proportioning the liquids.

This is a place for cheap  alcohol. No more, no less. If you want a place to hit with your friends and enjoy cheap drinks, or are a fan of steak, then Olypub is a definite choice. 
However, that's about all. The place is really shabby. The waiters are downright rude and often shamelessly ask for extra tips. Other than their beefsteak, the food isn't much to write about. 
I suppose all this doesn't matter though, because Oly has and will always be the "let's go out drinking" place for people all over town.

But i can tell you that was my first experience with Olypub and its beef steaks, it has still maintained it standards although a decade has passed. Therefore if your are coming to olypub then it has to be the steaks that you must try. Always try the well done steaks it is the best.

If you want to hang out with your old friends and catch up on all the missed out gossip over 
a pint of beer or a nip of rum, then this is the perfect place to be. You can either settle on the ground floor or choose a table on the first floor. Usually, the crowd is much younger on the first floor. If you're having a tight budget, then be delighted, as the prices are much cheaper than most of the places with a bar. There are quite a few things to be noted before you step into this place. Firstly, do not expect this place to be anything near dainty, sophisticated, reserved or peaceful. If you're one of the fussy kind, then it'd be better to stay away from this place. Second, expect different kinds of people around you, so girls, be very cautious. Third, it is better to play safe while ordering your side dish. Opt for the beef or mutton steak as any experiments won't pay off too well. Fourth, the washroom is not very hygienic and clean. Fifth, if you want to take a fag drag then there's a small crowded space in the way to the washroom where you can do it.
At the end, all the above points won't bother you anymore when you leave this place, 
satisfied with your drink and contented with the time spent among your good old buddies.

OlyPub means a lot to a whole lot of people. Lots of people in and out of Kolkata relate with this place. A friend who came to calcutta for the first time wanted to go to park street and Oly. Frankly, this place is dingy, dirty bordering towards disgusting. The waiters are half drunk, rude at times. The food aint great as well, though i doubt people come here to drink. The only reason to come would be the alcohol is cheap. 
But, really there are cheaper and better places elsewhere. Or better, call over your friends and booze at home.

Oly Pub, it has a special place for many. This place is one of the oldest spots in Park Street and is associated with lots of memories. The decor is very minimalist and is nothing to write about. However this place is and instant hit because of the decently priced alcohol. The place is full of old world charm and is the prefect place to hang out with friends over beer. Beef Steak and Chicken a la Kiev are a must try. The atmosphere is not that great and definitely doesnot appeal to everyone especially girls. Tables are very closely packed and overall is very cramped. Recommended if you wana hang out with friends and is on a budget!!!

So the first time in Kolkata and upon reaching a friend of mine directed me to go to Olypub. Being in the best part of town I expected much more knowing how Bengalis are passionate about food and also the fact my stomach was grumbling from the inside for some food because I'd not had anything since the morning.

Upon entering, the place looks so rundown and I knowingly took the corner most table with my friends to avoid the drunk group in the middle shouting and whiling away, not caring a bit about the other customers occupying the hotel. The table is filthy and the we ordered a couple of beers and some chicken starters.

The bong friend of mine had recommended the 'Chicken A La Kiev' which is supposed to be their signature dish it seems and after a few minutes the food arrives, The Chilly Chicken is the worst I've ever had and tastes like practically the ones they sell on the street and the 'Chicken A La Kiev' on bed of mashed potatoes and peas is nauseating. Upon cutting up the dish, butter oozes on to my plate which looks terrific but it isn't until I've got the piece in my mouth that I call my friend over the phone to blast him for recommending the worst dish ever I had.

Nothing can go wrong with beers and that might have been the only saving grace. The prices might be cheap but it's no excuse to serve sub-standard dishes as signature ones. Immediately after I left without wanting to experiment even more and to move to other places in the area. A whole in all a bitter experience for me in a city I'd come to admire for the food.

Keep all your expectations, even the tiniest ones out of your mind when you visit this place. I have been here just once, and the experience was quite interesting! Hygiene is not a priority here, and so is the decor or ambiance. You are likely to meet someone unexpected out here as the people who frequent this place are generally from the same social circle as you are! The thing that stands out here is the beef steak and the inexpensive alcohol.

Oly Pub is associated with a lot of memories for a lot of people coming from this city. Decent food and competitively priced drinks make this an instant hit for the young and old alike, and the Beef Steak and the Chicken A La Kiev make you want more. The environment though tends to be a little down and the place a bit dingy, and I wouldn't recommend to bring girls along. A great place to catch up otherwise.

It is difficult for anyone to review Olypub in an impartial manner. Olypub on Park Street would mean a lot of things to a lot of people. Adventurous trips to a watering hole during early college days to suit the pocket... Late college get togethers to reminisce the early college days... The daaru party with friends  after the first salary.. Mid-life visits with grown up friends to talk about all the early years.. And not to forget... the superb beef steak - rustic, to the point and immensely satisfying. 
Oly is not a place for fine diners. But for someone in Kolkata, your experience is incomplete if you haven't experienced Olypub.

Kolkata's favourite watering hole! This is a place where you go to get drunk and have the medium/well-done chateaubriand beef steak! Olypub is a Kolkata institution! If you're thinking of going here for a fine dining experience and superb food, you must either be new to the city, or just plain daft! 

Points to note:

1) The friendly rats are very domesticated and will not attack unless incited.
2) Look out for stellar offers on alcohol. A dream destination for a student on a tight budget.
3) The steaks on Sunday afternoon - late evening are the best, in my opinion.
4) Other dishes of note: try the Chicken a la olypub, a la kiev also not bad at all

Well this is a good restaurant and I would rate 3.5 for Olypub..I have been there quite few times and I have been satisfied almost all the time. Staff are friendly and ambience is good. Food quality is good and quantity is also appropriate for 2 to 3 people. Prices are also affordable. Chilly Prawns, Chilly Fish and Fried Chicken are really very well made and kebabs and tandooris are also quite delicious...I did not liked their mixed grills,,,sandwiches are also well prepared.
overall, a good restaurant.

Good but dubious food at Olypub!
3 out of 5

Enjoying good food at a popular restaurant is great, but you cannot judge a restaurant by its decor and style until you taste its food, just as you cannot judge a book by its cover until you've read it. 

My experience of eating at Olypub was somewhat mixed. I had no plans of eating at Olypub. But, yes I was in Park Street to dine at a popular restaurant. It was the weekend and Park Street was full of food lovers, ready to gorge on lip smacking delicacies offered at the various restaurants here which is why everything was full. I waited for forty-five minutes at Peter Cat but with no hope of getting a table for myself, I decided to dine at another restaurant in Park Street and settled for Olypub.  

Frankly speaking, I was not quite impressed by its decor and ambience. The service was satisfactory, but they could really improve on it. As I was hungry, I ignored the poor service and decided to concentrate on the food. I ordered Cream of Chicken Soup,  Hamburger Steak (mutton) and Chicken a la Kiev (my favourite). The quality of food served at Olypub is awesome and quantity is good as well. 

I knew I could not finish everything alone and requested the waiter to pack some for home. I enjoyed the flavours of the Chicken Soup and loved the Kiev. I also enjoyed the Hamburger Steak (mutton), which was appetizing but a tad undercooked. 

After a very long time, I actually enjoyed some good continental food in a restaurant. I am looking forward to a second visit to Olypub. You may not like the ambience or their standards of hygiene, but believe me you'll enjoy the food there.

One of the most affordable, oldest watering holes of the town. Its so old that its almost a part of the Calcutta heritage now. Yes, its from the time when "this part of the world was called Calcutta and not Kolkata". I remember I first visited this place within 2 weeks of my joining college. The beef steak is what I still remember from that visit. 
The Chicken a-la Kiev is worth a try or you'll miss something in life, if you've stayed in Kolkata had access to Oly (yes that's how Olypub loyals call it) and didn't try this speciality of Oly. The waiters are okay, they like it when you shell out 50-100 bucks to them as tip. Dont create much problem if you dont as well. Well lighted ambience. The so called 'intellectual' crowd. 
Only drwaback, is they dont allow smoking anymore in the main drinking area, you've to go to the passage behind and smoke if you want to. But then again, its because of the law they had to do it.

That old cheap place where you can hang out with friends in an expensive locality.
Ambiance - Its been the same since god knows how many years. insects and rodents can be seen sometimes.. cockroaches regularly. People prefer this place because of the price.

Food - Chicken A La Kiev is mind blowing, the best i have ever had. the butter filling just bursts out with the first bite. Beef steaks are some of the best in town. Can be tough at times, ask them to cook it properly.
It has been the den for poets, writers, students, musicians and people of all age groups frequent this shabby but the most well known old Pub of Kolkata.

ambiance - is well lighted, but seating as you get. sown to earth place.

Service -  the waiters are dicey and always on the lookout for tips.

Overall, nice cheap place for an adda over a beer.

Olypub is known for its offer of cheap spirits and one might question my being there since I do not enjoy the taste of any spirit of any kind ,except when used in my cuisines, but I was  solely there for their famed beak steak. The first time I had visited the place was a long time ago somewhere in 2006 and being in high school at the time it seemed fascinating to be able to afford a steak which as far as I remember I had thoroughly enjoyed. I had enjoyed it a few times after my first visit as well and had particularly liked their steak because it was neither overcooked not underdone but I had observed that over the years the atmosphere was becoming a bit if I might say, unsuitable for polite folks to be in. I still do not understand the need for people to scream at the top of their lungs while conversing with their company  and after downing a few pegs they  become louder bordering on it being impolite for the guest next table. It is being a pub is no excuse for ill manners. My last visit was an utter disappointment because by that time the place was dirty and I saw a small little rodent running from one end to the other. My steak was tough and repulsive for the palate while oozing grease and oil and personally I could not convince myself to give this place the benefit of the doubt. It is definitely a part of Calcutta's heritage and I am hoping that I shall soon get a good review to go back for their steaks once again.

This is one place where time stands still. With each passing decade Olypub maintains the standards and lives up to the expectations. The Chicken a-la- kiev and Chateau Briand are the best ! Over the years other places have opened up, giving them tough competition but this place has a legacy and there are many like me who prefer Olypub to any other bar in Kolkata. Also, the liquor is comparatively much cheaper. 
We have had a few experiences there which was inappropriate, especially with the waiters and that is perhaps the only negative thing about this place. The waiters are ill mannered.   

They deserve a 4 out of 5 , but the experiences I had  with the waiters compels me to give them a 3.5 !

After reading all the reviews on Zomato I finally decided to go check it out myself. Quite honestly? I'm disappointed, and this is after I visited the place twice. The place is at best mediocre when it comes to continental food which people quite fondly review here. If the steak here is considered the best in town, I wonder how people in Kolkata judge steaks. The mixed grill which is an assortment of pork, chicken, beef and egg is rather overcooked and the proportions of salt and other condiments are just ridiculous. Another much talked about dish in Oly is the Chicken ala kiev, which is basically glorified Bengali chicken cutlet with liquid butter/ghee inside. Nothing that surprises my palate.

However, the Fish grill was quite nice and I personally found that to be the best. Do give it a try if you happen to drop in. The booze is definitely cheap for an establishment in a place like Park Street. The ambiance won't delight you and neither does it matter because Oly isn't a premium Pub/Restaurant to start with and going by its long history much of the design remains unchanged since its initiation. 

Is it an attraction? No it is not. But be sure to drop in if you're Park Street and are hungry and low on money.

Ambiance - Unchanged since God knows how many years. You can be greeted by cockroaches and mice running around.
Drinks prices are lowest than any other place on Park Street.
One of the best Chicken A La Kiev I have had. Take a bite and delicious liquid butter pours out. What an amazing preparation.
Beef Steaks are amazing here.
People of all age groups frequent this shabby but the most well known Pub of Kolkata.
If you are in Kolkata then this place is a must.

OlyPub is one of Kolkata's oldest dine in's. It offers the best beef steak of town as per me. A single plate steak will be accompanied by a Poached Egg and Peas and that's a heavenly combination.
Chicken A-la-kiev was a suggestion from my friend, Chicken Cutlet with Molten Butter inside, I was amazed with the flavor and the smell of butter that came just when I had the first bite.No doubt its delicious.Its very affordable.

Must Have : Beef Steak , Chicken A-la-kiev, Mixed grill

Well, ahem, let me clear a thing or two at the very first chance. I have been a Oly Pub fanatic since the last 8-9 years or so and will continue to be one no matter how shady, rude, pathetic and indifferent they become. It will always have a special place in my heart for providing me and my friends with innumerable wonderful memories over the years.

Now, to the point. 
It serves liquor at the cheapest rates in & around Park Street area. 
It serves very very well cooked Beef Steak, Chicken A-la-Kiev and other continental dishes. In fact, I have ordered Beef Steak each and every time I have visited there. Never have I been disappointed with that particular dish.
It is the ultimate place to chill out with every type (school/college/office/para) of buddies.
It won't burn a hole in your pocket with its bill (although rates have skyrocketed in the last two years, coupled with exorbitant taxes).
Gossip, sing, shout, dance (Ok, I am going overboard) at your own will.
The service at times can be pretty pathetic with waiters being rude, but being a regular for so many years definitely helps ;) . (Yes, they would give preference to old timers. So, freshers beware :) )
There are plenty of mice running around here and there under the shredded carpets and yes, at times with cats chasing after them. Free entertainment, you see ;)
Ambiance. Well, if you are the finicky types and swear by neatness, cleanliness et all, please stay 1000 miles away from this pub. However, you can meet up with the most peculiar of the personalities of Kolkata in Oly Pub. My experiences range from the usual drunkards to intense philosophical discussions, musical evenings, heated arguments, emotional outbursts, fistfights and smashing bottles to even a random French guy singing "Ami chini go chini tomare ogo bideshini". You get the drift I presume.
So, all in all, this is definitely not for persons with weak heart or with cleanliness issues. For others - Two Thumbs Up - Be sure to complete your pilgrimage by visiting Oly.

4.5 stars from me.

this place brings back nostalgia of my college days when i used to go to park street with friends, had very little in our pocket and then after roaming, head back to olypub for 'adda' + fun.

it's still a great place to hang out with friends and have drinks with nice food. i love the beaf steak, chicken a-la-kiev, the fish finger and other continental stuff available here. cost is good. only issue is the waiters are a bit rude now a days. they were very cordial 8-10 yrs back but now not so. also, on weekends it's very difficult to get a table in the evening.

I wonder what I should begin with when talking about one of THE institutions of Kolkata. So, I've decided to begin with the #Caution: "All mild hearted people, visit at your own risk". This isn't a place for the fussy but definitely a place for the fun loving.

Situated in the heart of Park Street, this shady little pub has been a haunt for students, media people and just about everyone else forever, and it isn't uncommon to wind up in a queue for a table. Oly Pub is shady in every sense of the word, from its ragged carpets to spindly tables and cob webs to the old school waiters who seem to be more drunk that the customers! This place is fantastic! My favorite bit is when the waiter places the water on your table in a old glass country whiskey bottle and some 'chakna' with it.

The place has becoming non-smoking of late (except for the balcony near the loo) and shuts down at 10.30 (thank you Momota Didi), but has still kept is price-list nearly the same (cheap!). A bottle of kingfisher cost around 150 bucks which is damn good considering you're in Park Street.

The food is also reasonably priced, however, a lot of people I know don't like eating here as they suspect the food to be unhygienic! #Mind you here, I am from Delhi and I've eaten absolutely gorgeous food at Oly plenty of times and never gotten a bug! The Chicken Liver Fry and Mix Grill Platter are to die for! The Mix Grill Platter has an assortment of chicken, liver, beef and pork in a yummy sauce topped with a half fry egg. Its one of the most gorgeous things I've ever tasted and up there in my Bucket List for others to try. And yes, I say again that it's all really economical.

RECOMMENDED with all my heart and taste-buds!

Plan to grab a beer or a couple of pegs with your favorite steak or kebab before heading home? Well, Oly Pub is the place for it. The place is not as well kept as the other bars and pubs in the city, but the loyalists of Oly Pub keep going back there for the sake of the comfort that this place has on offer. If you plan to take someone out on a date, don't come here. If you plan to enjoy a evening getting drunk with friends, you have come to the right place.

Dropped in after a long time with an old friend on a weekday afternoon.The 1st floor was deserted.However thankfully the gossipy waiters sprung into action and attended to us.Had our staple Smirnoff Vodka along with fish items like the Grilled fish and Fish fry.Food items in this joint can be slightly dicey in this joint.Some might be lip-smacking while some might be outright rubbish and stale.One needs to be careful while ordering stuff here.Umpteen visits over the past couple of years have made me stick to couple of items-notably Grilled fish,fish finger,fish fry,chicken kebabs and pakodas.Items like mixed grill,beef steak though yum once upon a time have been a big let down in recent time.Prices are pocket-friendly as always.
Visited the place after ages.It was nice to see that the place hasn't changed a bit over the years.Tradition of pouring the drink from the bottle in front of the customer,payment by cash ONLY,strictly ordinary food, same style of glasses for every type of drink and dirt cheap prices. Smirnoff-60 ml for Rs 104/-.So you know what i mean!!!Easily the cheapest prices for drinks in Kolkata.No wonder that the place was jam packed with mostly teenagers and the seniors were seriously outnumbered.People were waiting at the staircase for a table-Saturday evening, thus understandable.
Among the food items the chicken reshmi kebab,mixed grill and fish finger was okay.Fried chicken and chilly mutton was horrendous-too spicy for consumption.Avoid these items.Heard the steak(beef/mutton) is still pretty good and popular but did not try it.

The Quintessential Middle Class Watering Hole of the City of Joy..Located rite in the middle of Kolkata's famed Park Street, olypub is a bar you must visit!!
It's has 2 Floors the lower newer floor has tables lined up like any Dime-a-Dozen bars you will find anywhere in our Country, but the place to be is the upper Floor(though u might have to wait 15-30 mins to get a table)..It old school to the very core, from the waiters to the tables to the ambiance to the "Ladies Toilet" Smoking Area..
If are a meat lover you must try the Beef Steak they serve hot with mashed potatoes, mushrooms , peas and an egg poach and the Chicken a la Kiev is seriously  some thing else..
The rates here are very easy on the pocket , it shouldn't cost you more then 800 bucks for 2 people.

Have been visiting this place for years now for drinks with friends. Not a place where you would like to take your girl or family, but if you are out with buddies and are in the mood for some drinks without digging a hole in your pocket, than this is the place.

Food doesn't really count at the Olypub... but some of my friends really like their Steaks.

The service was bad - I popped in before lunch time, the place was empty and the staff sleepy. The food was bad. My beef steak was tough, the mashed potatoes a little rancid and to top it all I saw a huge rat scurry across the floor of the restaurant. The staff didn't seem too bothered by it, like it was usual for rats to run around there.
The only thing good I can say about the place is that the alcohol is cheap. Would go there to get a cheap drink, but never to eat!

It used to be "cheap". well, it's kind of no more. because though prices are still around the "cheap" level, the food quantity has decreased a lot. The food was never too good anyway. Once in a while they served you a good steak. That too now has become rare. You don't get most of the beers or other drinks listed on the menus. So basically you have to ask the waiter what they "have" and make your choice from that. and situations are sometimes so pathetic that you might go there with a mind to have beer, and due to their limited options, you end up with whiskey or rum or whatever. Or better you don't have anything. But still it's a place where decent crowd comes in, given the place being economically cheap and all.

I have never been an oly fan and even when I used to drink,  but the recent renovations  have changed my perception.  Had a brilliant  time siting on the upper floor.  Since I don't drink,  let's tell you why you should still go to this place.  

The grilled chicken liver is to die for,  the sweet n salty sauce with lots of slices onion, oomph! 

If you like the old school sandwich,  the one you get in clubs,  their chicken sandwich is simple yet yummy.  

The roast mutton was tender and came with house fries and veggies,  not the crappy freezer chips.  

If u like steaks,  theirs comes with a poached egg on top.  But it's well done .  

Saving the best for the last.  The house mustard.  I  fell in love with it.  Slathered the chicken livers with it and it was pure ecstatic.  

The newly done up interiors are nice and the staff was warm and courteous.  

Cheers to old world charm.

this  used to be  the cheapest  bar in park street once upon a  time  . well now it is  cheapest for another reason ( i.e  Cheap =  dirty poor  ) .  i  used to like this  place a lot but  not anymore .  however you can still try  the chilli mutton  here +  of course the beef steaks  .  drinks are cheap but not  all drinks are available  .  for example you  ask  for  whyte & mackay = not available same goes for famous grouse  or budweiser  (  beer ) you will only find them if you are lucky. Ambience will only appeal to those  people who  are  nostalgic  of old times. for new tipplers  i suggest  starlit  garden bar  just beside  oly  to hang  out  & have a  good time .

You just assemble your friends, meet up on the weekend, have that "adda session" going and that liquor flowing. Whenever I am in town I make sure to gather my friends and go there. It's like going to the roots !!

Olympia Pub has changed little over the years. You will still find the fat rats running across and doing very little harm. Although, it at times does smell bad, but the authorities are quick enough to get rid of the smell. This makes for a great place to have drinks with friends.

However, my complaint with their Beef Steak is that it is ever diminishing. IT has atleast reduced by a quarter portion from the first time I had it here. There is also an unnecessary amount of peas that comes along with it. It usually turns into objects of drunken games afterwards. Lol, well!

Surely one of the most authentic places to hangout with your friends in Kolkata. The service is pathetic, but you can ignore that given the feel of the food and the company you have. Undoubtedly you would get the best Beef Steak in Kolkata at this place. The 'Chicken a la Kiev' is another dish worth trying out apart from the usual cutlets and fries. Also try getting a seat in the low-ceilinged mezzanine floor to get the Retro feel of this legendary place.

Time seems to take a stand still at this place located at the heart of Park Street. Youngsters looking for a place to bond over cheap alcohol and continental find their gathering at Oly Pub. Although they have refurbished the place over the years, the first floor still bears the old look, the old smell from some distant era. The popular dish here is the Beef Steak which I didn't have as I do not have beef. For me it would be the Chicken Ala Kiev that's worth a try if you're really interested in trying out continental at a cheap rate. The crispy layer outside and soft chicken with the butter oozing out from within as you bite into it is heavenly!
But a word of caution for all entrants at Oly Pub..keep a tab on your expenses. Most of the times you'll find yourself being charged for what you haven't had especially if you've had alcohol.

olypub is famous for its beefsteak. not for its service, not the ambiance, even the drinks mentioned on the menu card aren't all available. if you drink beer be ready to get disappointed as i have many times because rarely do you get to drink your favourite pint of bitter out here. smokers will have to stand on the balcony beside the hot ac vents and take a drag while people head to the loo( its for the ladies but guys are welcome to use it too) and trust me its a very tight spot on the balcony. be sure to check your bill for any irregularities because the waiters are notorious by habit  to charge the wrong amount to you and so please clarify it before paying up, i do so always. but everything taken into consideration its a good place to go with friends,the place brings back a lot of memories for me and i head there every saturday to have a good time. overlook the shortcomings of the place, enjoy with your pals and i guarantee you will come back to this place for more. And yeah, while ordering beefsteak do not forget to mention to full cook it or be ready to have a knife and fork battle with your dish.

And for steak loves heavenly "Beef steak" is there. You will see crowd and full of life over here moreover this place can fit for anybody's pocket.

Nothings changed about the place from the day I first visited it, on recommendations from various elder brotherly quarters...
Its the same waiters, in the same maroon liveries, serving the mixed grills and steaks and ... it still serves the most affordable liquor along the stretch of Park Street! Cheers!

I like the way they pour my poison right in front of me. It kinds of builds up the zest for a tipple.
The servicing may seem to be a bit rude if one is not used to the place, but personally I feel they operate on a known face, repeat customer basis. Anyways they don't tend to intrude 
at anytime and are least bothered if you chat away with your friends for a really long time without ordering anything.

Often the beef steak of Olypub has been praised. But personally I find that they tend to overcook the beef. 
The Mixed Grill platter on the other hand is something that I order regularly and it actually goes quite well with the liquor. Other food items on the menu list are quite agreeable and definitely worth the moderate price tag that they command.
If someone is looking for a laid back relaxed time with friends without hurting the pocket much and in the process look into something which has garnered a reputation for itself over decades...then this is the place to be.

Overall:
F & B: 3.5 out of 5 
Service: 3 out of 5
Ambiance: 3.5 out of 5

No doubt that its a nostalgic place for many[including me], but the even the nostalgia can't override the ill-behaviors of the staffs, the unhygienic environment, lack of smoking chambers and not to mention the non-availability of drinks [while they are still mentioned in the menu card]. The behavior of the staffs are rude and you'll feel like you are having a booze at their expense, you'll get tired of listening, " yeh drink abhi maojud nehi hain" to add to the pain, in you are unfortunately a smoker, you'll have to smoke next to the ac hot air exhaust pipe and toilet. The food is really not that "awesome", with the highest grade that can be offered being "average". All in all, even though its cheap, it doesn't offer even that service which a customer can expect by paying a cheap price. Not recommended.

January last, on a visit through Calcutta, I made my obligatory pilgrimage to Olypub, and noted with relief that it had remained mostly unchanged and stood resolutely uncompromised by the terrible beauties thrown up by our current soulless age. Still located on Park Street, a stone's throw away from Trinca's, the famous night club of yore, the ambience and the familiar dilapidation of the building remain the same, a distinction not many institutions can boast of in these murderously exhilarating times of consumer preferences with their insistence on tasteless packaging and grotesque upgradations to theme pubs and discotheqes.The place opens at 11:00 am and the narrow side annexe to the older main establishment, Olympia Bar, leads to steep, rickety steps which display no embarrassment at the cheap and frayed coir matting adorning them, before opening out into the low-ceilinged mezzanine floor which constitutes the bar proper and which is further subdivided into two sections, connected by a stair of 4/5 steps.

Try the beef steak. It is delicious. For non-beef eaters, I suggest the chicken a la kiev. Prices at the bar cum restaurant are very pocket friendly. If you want a gut-bursting (and satisfying) meal, expect to pay around Rs. 350.
