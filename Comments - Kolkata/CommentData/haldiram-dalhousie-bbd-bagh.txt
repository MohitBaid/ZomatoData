Tasteless food...anything you eat is either tasteless of somehow unsatisfactory. Unfortunate to have very less options for vegetarian restaurant in Kolkata.

Been here to this for some quick bites in the afrernoon. Tried their strawberry milkshake and chola bhatura. Milkshake was decent but overpriced where as chola bhatura was good enough.

This is a newly opened shop here. The staff is well behaved. I went there to buy Kesar  Laddoos for my mother but on coming home, my mother complained that it is not the same thing as tasted before. There is no dry fruit in it. I complained back to them and they replied that it is different because the one in Ruby Hospital area is Prabhuji and theirs is Haldiram so different organisation. I did not know it. Anyway packing is good and hygienic. Nothing much is there as yet.
