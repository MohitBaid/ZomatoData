Extra ordinary food the tandoors served on table is superbly delicious, soft and juicy. I ate so much of it that couldn't even eat more on main course as I wanted to go for the desserts as this is the favorite part for me... I love sweets and with fruits it's more tasty and refreshing....

A little dim place, usually for the aged crowd. The drinks are okayish, the food is average. 

Please make sure to ask them the price of drinks before you order outside menu, they conveniently charged me 2000 for an LIIT that too not a pitcher.

Very spacious with comfortable sitting arrangements. This is the lounge bar of haveli restaurant and the food is same what is served on ground floor. The staff were friendly and food was fresh. The décor was however a lill old and a renovation I guess would be round the corner. However the large screen... slow music... ample space and good staff made both the visits worth visiting..

I visited this place with some of my friends. We are attracted to this place due to its inexpensive bar menu. Ambience is excellent location is excellent. But i my opinion main con is this is a veg restaurant and liquor stock is limited. But i enjoyed my evening.

The place was a overall nice one with ample space and good staff. The only turn down about the place was they had very less things ready as compared to what is listed on the menu. And they should get some cushions too.

Enter the Door and behold bronze inspired decor which is actually good and then the empty seats...and the seats are uncomfortable for tall guys..if u r someone who likes ur drink without making cocktails out of it then this is the place..it's cheap..12year old Chivas peg costs u only 300 bucks!!!!..though m a pure non veg the rates are enough for me to visit this place again and again..their veg platters and spread tastes good though I think I won't be able to do justice by writing something on it..cheers!!
