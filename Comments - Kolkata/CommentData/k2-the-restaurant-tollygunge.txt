Worst food with worst service.

Food quality can be average, but service? It was worst, service person doesn't know how serve, how to hold a service spoon or fork. Horrible experience.

Sorry to say but, the experience wasn't gd .
 
Though, thanks for serving me.

All the best for future.

Cheers !!

This is extremely close to my locality.Tasted fried ice cream for the first time here.totally loved it.my long term wish fullfilled.crispy chilly baby corn was completely differently made than other restaurants and served wd mustard mayo sauce which was yummy and gave the dish a complete flavour.Prawb cutlet had a thick and hard coating can be made thinner.It was average.Hot and sour chicken soup was made extra spicy as per my taste and i was bowled over by the flavour.Chicken irani kabab was suggested by them which was alsp of a totally different taste and the pudina chutney served alongwith the kabab also had a perfect blend of every spice.Masala coke was made to perfection.Overall a happy foodgasmic experience

Located beside Bedwin at Netaji Nagar, it's a nice & cozy place to dine out with family and friends. Food quality and quantity is good, but the place is somewhat small. Tables are available for two or three people very easily but for families with more than 5 members will have to wait for sometime before they get a seat,  at least in the Durga Puja Rush. We ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Szechwan Chicken and it tasted great. Serving is quick enough. Recommended if you are looking for a restaurant in this area.

I have been to this place many times before and it served my purpose earlier.. Everything was brilliant. The food quality and the service both. But, I went there just 2 weeks ago and very much disappointed with the food quality over there. I ordered for a mixed fried rice and a chili chicken and a sweet lime soda.. Nothing was up to the mark. I called the guy who was serving us and informed them also about it. But it seems they were not bothered.. So.. People and friends please visit there and if u don't like anything, make them notice it and realize.. Thank you

This is a decent restaurant to order for when i order from my friend's place who lives near tollygunge. Since there are other known mughlai and north Indian restaurants nearby, we end up ordering Chinese from here. Last we ordered chicken fried rice and Manchurian chicken which were both good in quality and quantity. The quantity is decent for two people to share of average appetite.
As it was always a home delivery, I cannot comment on their ambience or staff.

Well this was an experimental one. But it paid off quite well. 
This place stands bests for takeaways. 
Stands as my second favourite one. 
This place delivers good chinese dishes. 
Specially Kung pao chicken, Burnt garlic rice, Schezuan rice, Konjee chicken.
These are the ones i loved about this place. 
Its more than enough to impress you to a good extent. 
The pocket pinch is a moderate one. 
You can try this restaurant if you are planning to get some good and cheap chinese dishes.

K2 is just near my apartment ...I keep coming here now n then. It is an small humble restaurant with a homely atmosphere and great food. During festivals like durga Puja you see the members of the owner's family work together to ease out the burden. They having some amazing starters within your budget.

The quantity of food was good and sufficient. The preparation and taste of the same was also extremely delicious. The packaging was also well done. This was our first experience of ordering from them. Will definitely order again from them. The prices are not too heavy on the pocket either. In all, a very good experience.

So let me be frank, they make pretty good crispy baby corn, since its inception I had this starter, had its mixed fried rice many times, its ok-ish so was the cantonese noodles (mixed) and the oyster chicken was really good. As a whole, it not certainly amazing but yea the food is good when you pass nearby in Netaji Nagar..
The place do not have the kind of ambience you are looking for, one might feel a bit clustered, but the food is good to enjoy when and also it does have the right amount of price tag so that it fits righ in you budget..

I had a horrible experience with K2 Restaurant. We ordered food for home delivery and had requested them to bring their portable credit card machine bcoz they had done this before. Our home is just opp to this restaurant. Delivery man brought the food that too after one hr and 45 mins and food was not warn at all. Nevertheless  we asked him to take out c.c machine for making the payment bcoz we did not had enough cash for payment. On this he rudely replied that if we don't pay him by cash then he will take the food back. Immediately we reminded him that we had asked the person who took the order for bringing c.c machine. After lot of argument and discussion he went back and brought c.c machine and took the payment. With such rude behaviour, poor service and horrible food I will never recommend any of my friends to take any kind of service from K2 Restaurant.

A place where one shouldn't visit at all if he/she is a foodie. Because after visiting this place u might start loosing your interest over foods. Wastage of money and time. Foods were not at all good . Staffs were reluctant about your problems and they also don't have any idea that what are the dishes that they have cooked on that very day. Man problem is a majority of the food those are listed in the menu wasn't present in their kitchen. I became very very depressed after visiting that place as that is in my locality.

Service standard had drastically improved
Well we ordered for fish kabiraji and chicken fry as starters
In main course we has mutton biryani and chicken chaap
Fish kabiraji can challenge the best in town
Nicely coated yellowish
 Chicken fry was good too
But biryani was a bit disappointment.rice was not so soft as expected.however it was not bad either.
The bill was mere 505.00 rs
The owner made us understand about the accompanyments of the starters along with the sauces
Servers were nice and attended us quickly.paying attention ro each and every table

Great time spent
Worth every penny spent

K2 is the reason I've spent many a nights without the pull of hunger in my belly. It's located 5 minutes from my place, making it extremely accessible to me, any time of the day. The food is quite good, wouldn't say amazing. Their Chinese is really nice, so is their Indian. I wouldn't really recommend the Biriyani, but it's not that bad either. As for the interiors, they were recently redecorated, so it has a modern flair to it now. The service is good, and almost always quick enough. There aren't too many things to complain about this place. All in all, it's a solid place, with a reasonable pocket pinch and good food. Recommended.

K2 is a hidden gem when you judge a place purely based on the food and the price.

Located close to Netaji Nagar more K2 caters multicuisine options in their menu though I have always tried their Chinese dishes which tasted absolutely Brillant. Even though they have a simple interiored sitting area I have never had it dere rather packed it along.  Chicken in oyster sauce along with fried rice and noodles is amazing. Also the crispy babycorn and fish dishes are delicious as well. 

I strongly recommend them as they serve you good food at a stealing price :)

Located at netaji nagar, K2 is a small but great place. They have  have a seating arrangement for about 20 people at a time and also have a tie up with swiggy, which helps you eat good food at home as well. The ambiance is decent and they have wifi. The staff is very cooperative and on their toes to help you out . 
Since I've been here and ordered from here numerous times, I'll just sum up what all I've had. 
The chicken bharta tops my favourites list. The diced chicken breast comes in a smooth gravy with the smell of kasturi methi very prominent. To fresh cream adds the cherry to the cake. The lachha paratha, afghani tandoori, malai kebab, garlic pepper chicken and hakka noodles, all of these are recommended. This place is fairly priced, the quality of food is really nice and the quantity is more than satisfying.

While craving for new options to had my dinner, i zeroed down on k2. K2 known for their indian & chinese delicacies at affordable prices seemed like a good option. So i placed my order via swiggy & had the following items:-

1. Chicken coriander soup- Good quantity of light smooth soup comprising of chopped vegetables with generous amounts of chicken pieces. The taste was good but might seem a little bland but you could use some pepper to spice it up.

2. Plain chicken meifoon- Wholesome quantity of super soft meifoon made with chopped capsicum,carrota & onions. It had good amount of chicken pieces. The meifoon was super yummy & it just melted in your mouth. Quantity was good for 2 people easily.

3. Garlic pepper chicken- 8pcs of shallow fried pure chicken in dark soy garlic sauce with ample amount of pepper which took the taste to another level. Recommended.

The price for quantity & quality was justified in my opinion. Looking forward to try their indian delicacies as well.

This place is located just opposite to Kamala Mistanna Bhandar in Netaji nagar. Never really dined in. They serve both Chinese and North Indian cuisine and have a variety of dishes on their menu. Last week I ordered the chicken tikka butter masala and butter Naan from swiggy. The chicken was pretty good but could have been a bit more spicy.
But the butter naan was a totally disappointment. It was actually a laccha paratha served with butter on the top. 

Overall it is an affordable restaurant. Will definitely try out in the near future.

Lots of variety in menu. Also the food is really good and tasty. Indian food are also served but have not tried. Chinese is their speciality. Quantity is good in comparison to the pricing. 
One of very well known and good restaurant in our locality.

Went here during pujo last to last year. As it is the place is extremely small allowing barely 12-15 people at a time and we were a group of more than 10 people, hence occupied almost the whole of this place. 
The food was okayish but we were hungry, so we hogged onto it without any complains. Can't really recall what exactly the order was. But surely not a let down.

A small restaurant in Netaji Nagar. Mainly known for chinese cuisine but they do serve north indian dishes too. The restaurant is a little cramped and seating is a problem. The chinese food here really impressed me and the starters have a lot of variety. I had ordered hot and sour soup, chicken drumsticks as starter and hakka noddles for the main course along with chilli chicken. The quantity and quality is both good and i would recommend you to visit this place once if you are in the neighbourhood.

The place is small, cozy and located near Netaji Nagar Bus Stop in Tollygunge.  Its a small place so nothing much to say about the decor and ambience. I went there for lunch with my colleagues for a short lunch. We ordered Afghani Tandoor Chicken upon suggestion from the staff here who promised us that it was an upgrade from the regular Chicken Tandoori. Special mention for the Dhania Chutney ... normally the chutney u get with kebabs is dahi based , but here we had the authentic green dhania chutney which reminded me of the kind Mom used to serve at Lunch. 

Also on order was a Mixed Garlic Fried Rice which I didnt taste but based on visuals alone it looked quite delightful. I hope it tasted the same.

The third order was a mixed kebab platter. It had chicken , mutton and fish kebabs . All were good 
 The waiting time is too much and one has to be patient to get the food in the table so thats a letdown.
The chicken was just perfect
The staff were very friendly and hospitable. The rating is based on the food alone.

After reading their reviews in zomato I have tried a parcel from this joint of chicken mehfonn, chicken cantoneese and drums stick... The mehfon was good but little blunt...The drumstick was dry  but taste was good.. but the cantonese noodles was a disaster.... it tasted like gravy noodles and I could not find any mushroom in it...the service was also average..

This is a place which I used to love to come when I was a kid. They specialize in Chinese cuisine. That time, they used to serve only Chinese and all mainstream Kolkata Chinese available were served then and all of them were pretty good. Few days back they had undergone some renovation after which I heard they also serve Indian cuisine. Haven't been there after this. I hope K2 lives by its standards even today because this is a place for my childhood nostalgia. Happy Dining! :)

My personal favourite when it comes to eateries in this area...
Compared to the surrounding restaurant this is steeply priced but they don't compromise with quality
serves both mughlai and chinese dishes
Try the coriander soup, the oyster sauce dishes and the nargisi kopta
you will surely not be disappointed!!
T
During early evening the also serve fish fries and other condiments..
The only problem is parking and sitting..
The restaurant can sit maximum 20 ppl...

This is one of the very less known but amazing place. Very close to the Netaji Nagar more, this place will take you by surprise. The entrance, the interior and the sitting is very normal and looks like most other average food joints around the city. The menu is also a mixture of everything and no specific type of food is maintained. But the surprise is when you order your food. They make everything so amazing. I love to visit this place, and revisit it and keep going again and again just to have their Chicken Manchow soup. Amazingly prepared, extra spicy with crispy chow served separately. At a very affordable rate, this is simply amazing.

K2 is my neighbourhood restaurant. Just a minutes walk from my house. Although sitting capacity is very less, their food quality is quite good and at par with big chinese restaurants of the city. Their chicken drumsticks, crispy babycorn, mughlai paratha are very nice in taste. Fish fry is also good but a bit pricey. The best I had there is a chilly garlic chicken noodles and of course their oil free rolls. Have not yet tried their Indian dishes. Home delivery is prompt.

A small and cozy restaurant serving both the commonest cuisines. We made our order of total 7 dishes and within 45 mins ,it reached destination. Pretty good service, even for Christmas night (around 10:44 we ordered!) 
We ordered hit garlic fish and chicken in oyster sauce. Both were tasty. The rating is solely on the basis of good side dishes and good home delivery service. The  main con -the noodles were bland and were "pati" thin noodles which tasted like just boiled noodles. And other thing is that 8 pieces a plate of a side dish is the standard for me, they give only 6.

I have taken Veg Roll and Paneer Roll from these,as home delivery.

They serve rolls which they market as "oil-free" rolls .

These are basically wraps,in which the fillings are put inside rotis . I have found that these rotis are very hard,which make it difficult to chew.I do hope that the management will take care of that and try to make soft rotis,so that these rolls can serve as healthy snack options without sacrificing on the taste.

I had also ordered Kashmiri Pulao and Chicken Do-Piyaza.
On the whole,they serve good food.

But I sincerely want that the owner of the food joint takes immediate steps so that the rolls are not hard to chew.

Located in Netaji Nagar, it's probably the only outlet, take aways are really good and affordable but there are a lit of flaws: food sometimes gets too spicy or gravy becomes too thick, nans and rotis are extremely hard difficult to tear there was moment when it difficult to chew!! But there are good food indeed i would suggest you have mughlai parantha and fish fry.

Recently I have been here. I must say food quality for some of the items have detoriated. We ordered Chicken Hot n Sour Soup to start with but it was nowhere to the expectations from previous experience. Finally we moved to main course with Sczn Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Noodles & Sczn Chicken. Though the fried rice was a bit pale but Sczn Chicken was just awesome. It washed away all our disappointment. Chicken Noodles too was great. 
Considering the pocket friendly competitors around I think they should really buckled up quickly.

Though the place is small but enough to accommodate around 30 pax. But price may seem a bit higher than other competitors in the neighbourhood.

I am sorry if I am being blunt to the point of being offensive...but never set foot in this place with a serious case of munchies. The quantity is so less....even the meekest eaters will cuss it. The items are overpriced and frankly I had better. 
Ordered Crispy Kongee Chicken..tasted good...but quantity so less that you gulp and whoa!...Its gone
Chicken Hariyali Kebab...had better kebabs in far more derelict places than this. Not worth ordering.
Mixed Rice was nothing special, ordered Amazing Chicken to go with it. Frankly I liked the chicken..but many of my friends said that the sweet and sour balance was way off. The broccoli and veggies gave a nice garnish to the dish.
Butter Naan was ok!(I am being modest)...Chicken Butter Masala was excellent;by far the only dish everybody enjoyed. Quantity was also sufficient enough.
I am a voracious eater..the bing term is 'hangor'..so I ordered Dragon Chicken. Now compared to the spicy Dragon chicken I had in Denzong..this was a joke. Sweet sour and the chicken bits looked like dog poo :( 
Service was bad...a very anxious waiter disturbed us frequently buy didn't come to us when we needed to place an order...decor is also run of the mill ordinary. Bill came cheap somewhat...but we were not full.

Its more of a road side eatery than a fancy restaurant. I have only tasted its Chinese food, didn't feel encouraged to try out anything else. The food Taste and quality is alright, nothing too good. The quantity of food is very less, you have to order multiple plates to fill your appetite. The Bawarchi fast food beside this establishment is much better and attracts the maximum crowd.

The quality was good, although the quantity could have been slightly more better. I had Chinese Vegetable Chowmien too and admittedly one of the tastiest chowmien I have ever had before. I would recommend for all Chinese food lovers to try out this restaurant, which offers a decent yet tasty food at affordable price.

Affordable, good location and good quality of food as well. Few years ago during Durga Puja, l was with my friends and after walking for miles, strolling around pandal hopping we ended up at K2 and decided to give it a shot. It was worth it. Have been going back since.

Food: We ordered 1 Schezwan Egg Noodles and 2 Egg Hakka's. The food was below par. Schezwan was not even close to it's original meaning and the Hakka's was below standard.Service: It almost took near about 40 mins to get the order served and me and my friends found the experience one to forget about. Not recommendable

If you reside near Netaji nagar kolkata, visit k2 for frequent small outings or pocket friendly hang up with your friends or loved ones.It is Located at a walking distance from netaji nagar bus-stop.First it mainly served Chinese but now a days you also get some Indian(I loved their Biriyani , quantity good, non oily n moderately tasty) or Thai dishes(some of them me n my friend tried , taste good!!!! ) .Though the restaurant is very small but you will get a pretty good food within a very reasonable amount(say 500/600rps for 2persons). They also provide home delivery options. So if you are reside in Netaji nagar , Naktala , Ranikuthi or Baansdroni area and want some good food(mainly Chinese)  without going far then let this restaurant a try.

Food is decent , not so good . I had heard about the Chinese food at this place but tried out Indian dishes which I found rather  moderately tasty .

1) Service 4/5
2) Quality- 3/5
3)Value for money 4/5

I will recommend this place to others ,but try out the Chinese rather than the Indian dishes at this place.

In comparison to other outlets nearby in the same lane, K2 is the best in netaji nagar. Good quality food is provided there. All the dishes they serve are really good.  just that since recent times, both in weekdays and weekends, the food is delivered somewhat late. Last 5-6 times, I had to call the restaurant to ask where is my order.

Had a Pleasant experience during this Durga Puja time. We didn't expect a good quality food as most of the restaurants in Kolkata serves not-a-good food during puja. But we were surprise having good food and excellent hospitality.! For Puja, They are offering Biriyani's outside of the restaurant and take away also..

FOOD(4.5/5)->> We have to wait for 7 minutes to get seated and they serve us bottled water. We ordered Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice and Amazing chicken suggested by the waiter. K2 serves both chinese and mughlai north indian cuisine. Our food was served after five minute. TANDOORI CHICKEN was soft, not too burnt and served with green DHANIYA CHATNI. Fried Rice was the BEST, the quality of rice was great. Taste like heaven. AMAZING CHICKEN was really amazing with 10 piece chickens accompanied by loads of cabbage,cauliflower,bacon,carrot and onion. 

SERVICE & LOCATION->> K2 is located at Netaji Nagar. walk towards netaji nagar college from Netaji Nagar more. Service was good, as the waiter was serving us the food. Our bill was 480. 

I didn't give 0.5 as I think they should give water without charging and they should increase their sitting arrangement as their is only 7 tables. This restaurant serves great food so I would recommend you to give it a try!!! With

A super valued restaurant who offers quality and tasty food at a very competitive price. I have visited here multiple times over the last few years and have been pleased with the food every time. As fas as I can recall I have not tasting anything apart from Chinese down here so cannot comment on those dishes but it is indeed a hidden gem. Being a small to medium sized restaurants they only have a handful of tables and seats but also offer home delivery in the locality. A 4.0 stars rating for the balance between price, quality and taste, also very fast service.

I was going through all the fantastic reviews that have been written for this restaurant . And respecting all those reviews i decided to go to K2. I'd also like to mention that this evening was a very very special one as this is the first time after a very long time that i went to dine with my whole family ! Well that just includes the four of is though ;) 

We ordered for the manchow soup, and Tom Yum Soup! The manchow soup is usually my classic choice so it was good !!..so was the other one. For starters we ordered for the pan fried chicken momo,coriander fish dry and crab cake pepper salt! Over all they were great ! Really good quality stuff ! The momos were very well seasoned ! And i loved the coriander  fish dry ! The flavour combination was very comfortable ! 
For mains we ordered for chicken fried rice , chicken noodles , prawn with mushroom and devil's choice. I must make a special mention of the devil's choice as it was out of the world !! Not too spicy, not too sweet. Just PERFECT!. 

One thing i'd like to mention is that i would  give this place a total 5 on 5 ! But i was really happy with the quality of service in this place. The service man who was taking our orders was very pleasant and welcoming . 
its been a beautiful experience ! Thanks ! 
Happy Eating :)

Now this week we had chance of taking our clients to a dinner. My order included 3 non veg starters -seekh kabab, fish tandoori, mutton burra kebab and 3 veg starters-K2 special aloo, paneer tikka,veg sheek kabab.It was our pleasure and delight we chose K2 and had the opportunity to taste the best food in town.We had decided torestrict ourselves to muglai dishes.The food was Awesome. Very good and authentic taste with great service. Biryani and dal makhani was top of the pick. The menu has been made with lots of efforts and the team has put in the required hard word and has been thoughtful while finalising the menu and the dishes. The food and taste and specially authentic taste which is what matters here.
Every food item is made right up to the mark here, the menu is not unending are 2 3 options in each category per course, but the way they make it same thing can be eaten on back to back multiple occasions. This was one heck of a meal i had in long long time. 

I would highly recommend it to everyone.
Tantalizing food and service. Keep it up!

They started with "Chinese only " option, but now has indian dishes as well. In an area saturated with take away joints, this was the first decent dine in option ed restaurant. They had a thai-chinese dish where chicken used to come wrapped in banana leaf, with an essence of fresh lemon as well. It was very similar to a dish that i had tasted in Switzerland named pandan chicken (chicken wrapped in pandan leaf), and it was an immediate 'wow' moment for me. It was a speciality, but don't get me wrong, they were equally good in the staple Chinese foods.
Times change, people change, and so do restaurants as well. Not anymore that great, this place. Probably they tried to overdo it, keeping too many options, and not anymore specialising on there core competency. They surely earn more with their multi cuisine tag, but i do not find 'that' perfect Chinese taste that they started with.

Went there some time back, its a small n cosy food joint. The interiors are being made simple n nice. 
As it was evening, we (me + my family + my friends) waited for some time before getting the table.
The food we ordered was chinese, though it came when we became super hungry (as it was full house). The food tasted real good and the service was also prompt. 
At the end of the episode, we were HAPPY.

Went there today with my friend, nice ambiance, staffs were cordial. We ordered fish fingers, chicken and fish sizzlers. The fish fingers were very good in taste, but we were very upset when we saw sizzlers.. chicken and fish Manchurian (may be, as they tastes Chinese) and noodles just placed on the hot sizzling plate, there were no vegetables or breads. I am sure this is not way to prepare sizzlers, there are different sizzler sauces available for this dish. I request K2 to look after it .

I ordered it today for d 1st time,  so didn't hv very high expectations.  I hd ordered Chicken Biriyani,  Afghani chicken Tandoori,  masala khulcha n chicken Lababdar.
the kabab was too good, bt my hopes were doomed when I saw d Biriyani,  it was just too ordinary. As for d  chicken Lababdar the gravy was super rich n the boneless pcs were overcooked.  Khulcha tasted well but a bit rubbery texture. According to my opinion,  the Afghani chicken is a Star dish with soft buttery medium spicy flavour,  it is a sure hit.

Very nice causal atmosphere. This is not an upscale restaurant, but it is good as a nice friendly family place. Indian dinners were all very good and service was very prompt. Indian items like Biriyani, chicken bharta, any kabab item or tandoors, they are simply amazing. I personally loved chicken Afgani. If you are not very comfortable with spices then this is a must have dish.  Do not forget to try Chinese dishes. This restaurant has already made a a mark for Chinese. It is totally worth paying money. Also their home delivery service is very very fast.  
Sitting capacity is not too many, so just ring the phone and enjoy if you are not interested to sit and eat. 
Prices were very reasonable and appropriate for this family restaurant.

K2 AND YOU TOO!

Among the many restaurants in the Netajinagar and Bandsdroni areas, K2 certainly knows how to satiate your taste buds with their genuine and authentic Chinese fare. Like their very short and catchy name even their menu is written in a very original manner. The place is cozy with well laid out and comfortable sitting arrangements. The decor is simple and the walls are done up in some very soothing pastel shades. The servers are very competent in their jobs and the food service is quick and fast.

 For starters, they have many and varied vegetarian, chicken, prawn and fish items. some of the items that you can order and relish here are chilli baby corn, honey chicken, chilli chicken, black bean chicken, lat mei kai,  golden fried prawn and fish finger. The very hot and piping soups to be had here are (I played safe!) sweet corn soup, hot and sour soup and Thai soup. All of them are available with or without meat. Their soups are not only well seasoned but are also full of flavor. 

As side dishes, you can take your pick from the regular chicken, seafood and vegetarian items.  We had Hunan chicken with red and yellow pepper, oyster chicken with mushroom, Sichuan chicken and a couple of other equally delicious chicken dishes I can't remember. Some K2 seafood items that are worth devouring here are garlic pepper fish with red pepper and fish (or prawn) cooked in green chilli sauce. The meat pieces are not only juicy and tender but of significant portions. Apart from the usual fried rice and Hakka noodles, they serve certain new and tasty dishes like seafood rice, burnt ginger capsicum rice, Dan Dan mian and sesame noodles (we didn't try these though). Their sizzlers can be a big part of your lunch or dinner here as well, if you like grilled meat.
