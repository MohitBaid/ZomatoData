Friendly neighborhood joint which delivers decent Chinese food at throwaway prices. The proximity of the place is the high point for me. They make a mean salt and pepper chicken and dry chilli chicken. Their fried rice is very good, and so would be the gravy noodles if they paid a little more attention to the cut and cook of the green veggies they throw in there. Quantities are sufficient. For a decent meal comprising typical Kolkata Chinese staples at ridiculously cheap rates, this is a good place to go.

ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶Especially My 2nd Visit To This Place Monsoon Hut, Dhakuria. I'm The 11th Reviewer For This Place Monsoon Hut, Dhakuria. Located Near: Dhakuria Bus Stand Opposite Petrol Pump And Carmel High School For Girls And Near Jodhpur Park As Well. Coming To Food: I Ordered 1 Mixed Fried Rice With Egg Chicken And Prawn For Just Rs. 140/- Those Who Don't Know This Prices Are Now The Latest Prices Of This Restaurant. I Liked The Mixed Fried Rice The Items Were Perfectly Cooked And Served. They Took 25 - 30 Minutes To Cook. But It's Okay With Me. I Waited For 30 Minutes Maximum. In That 30 Minutes I Took Photos Of This Restaurant. And When The Food Was Served At The Table. The Manager Apprecieted And Also Corporated And Talked To Me Very Friendly. Thank you Monsoon Hut For Making My Day Very Very Awesome.ðŸŽºðŸŽ¸

Very small joint. The owners said they are into Home Delivery service and this outlet dining is like spreading wings a little. Not bad though.
Food was pretty good in quality which was served.
Ordered for Soups, Fried Rice, Pepper Fish & Pepper Chicken. Quantity was satiable. Quality of the food was very delightful indeed. Well cooked and fresh. Pricing was not heavy for the pocket.
All of those are pros.
Now time for cons, the cutlery was inappropriate. The bowls were broken. The washroom was unhygienic. Chairs and tables were out of place. Tad discomfort in the air-conditioned room which had accommodated unsizable no. of people (it can be understood given the situation).
Very definitive place for family dine-out considering the corrections.

A small joint with very courteous joint...... this is what came into my mind first of all.. I have tried schezwan noodles and garlic chicken.. the noodles was very good and garlic chichen was also good though the chicken pieces have thick coating.. but thats fine considering the price they charge..

Quantity and quality wise satisfactory . Best part is that the food is easily digestable, indicating the use of better quality oil which affects the taste and appearance of the food . Not bad.

The place is small. Place for only around 10 people overall. Its not an AC restaurant. But the atmosphere is very homely. The staffs are very friendly. 
The food ordered takes quite a long time but its worth to wait for. 
The Crispy chilly babycorn is yummy and tasty. 
Chilli garlic fried rice is also good. Averall the food is good and worth the price they charge for it. And the quantity they serve is more than enough for 2 person per plate. 
A must for all the college goers who has got limited funds to dudge for food.

Holy wow. If you want a cheap good takeaway this place will do the job. Had an amazing meal at only Rs 200. A sub standard shop but does its business in a neat and clean and efficient way. Rice noodles is good, but a bit too much oil. Szechuan Chicken was tasty. Overall decent experience.
