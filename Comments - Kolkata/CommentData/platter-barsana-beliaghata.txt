So, Platter at Beliaghata, is a good family restaurant. The restaurant is located inside where one may get confused. Therefore, something must be done in order to let people search for it easily. The good served was good. It was tasty. Service was good. Its cheap and â‚¹800 (max) is the food cost for 2 people. People may try out the restaurant and refer to other. I've seen time where I've to wait for 30 mins in order to get a table ðŸ˜Ž

We had booked a table in advance over here but still had to wait for 1.5 hrs to get a seat. The waiters were all flustered and showed lack of training in handling such a large group as ours (we were a group of 26 people). The service in the beginning was pathetic. Water was served in mismatched glasses. Tablespoon was given with soup. Starter plates weren't served to most while one member received a plate with chipped corners. 
But what was recommendable over here is the food. In starters, we had ordered crispy chana n lasagne. Both were excellent items, though i found the tomato in the lasagne a bit too overpowering. 
Naan n kulcha tasted good. Paneer was a disappointment. Daal makhni was great. Methi matar malai tasted bland n most of the people in our group didn't like it. 
Overall a good experience overshadowed by the frustration of waiting excessively in the beginning. May visit again with family.

One of the best places for veg food. The ambience is good and the service is excellent. The cheese fondue is must try if you visit this place.

One of the worst places you can ever visit. First of all I had to struggle to park the car and as soon as we entered the restaurant it was very warm. The Acs and the fans were switched off.After sitting there for 5 mins nobody came to attend us and of course the Acs were still of.We were so frustrated that we left without eating.

We visited this place second time with a group of 14 friends & 5 kids on 31.07.2016 at lunch. The place attracts mainly club members n people known to this area n restaurant.
Parking - It is a problem as it is very near to intersection of beliaghata road n they do not have their private parking buy they do have arrangement in nearby bldgs basement.

Ambience - Although the entrance to the restaurant is not good, ambience outside the restaurant becomes good due to presence swimming pool. Inside the restaurant, although the furniture( particularly tables) is outdated but the sofa seats n chairs r comfortable n spacious. It is a small 24-30 pax restaurant.

Food - Starters were mouth watering n good in quantity. We ordered tandoori aloo, baby corn & French fries. In main course, we ordered naan, masala kulchas n tandoori Roti's with daal makhani, malai kofta & paneer butter masala. All the items were tasty, hot n really good in quantity. The baking of the breads n taste of the food was exemplary.
Papads - Do not ever order them. Even after getting the entire platter changed, they were burnt n reddish meaning they were old n tasteless.

Drinks - Sweet lime soda n masala thumsup were equally not good n too little. Not satisfied, we ordered softdrink cans which were very chilled, thanks to their small chiller decked near washroom. Needs serious improvement in their drinks dept.

Service - Was ok but not great. & should be improved. Only 3 persons were serving us 2 other table guests. The place was not crowded even on Sundays.
Cost - Fetched us, Rs 5000/- in total which seemed reasonable.
Pros - Pure veg, good qnty & tasty food.s
Cons - Parking, avg parking n service. Poor drinks n papad

Visited there on Sunday evening with my family, for dinner. Was tired to going places with fully crowded. It's situated in barsana club at beliaghata. They gave us the waiting time for 15 minutes, but it was empty in 5 min. Staffs were courteous and welcoming. Service was pretty fast. We had ordered kebab platter, manchow soup, haka noodles, American choupsey, manchurian. Food had a great taste. Pocket friendly. Ambience was fine, just beside swimming pool.
