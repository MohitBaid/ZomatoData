This is perhaps the only hookah joint in the area... Ambience is bit on the darker side... Staffs are well behaved... Service is fast... Ordered for a hookah... Kiwi spring water... Which was decent... Also ordered for the grilled chicken... Presented well... But surprisingly they served it with a scoop of ice cream... Asking the reason behind that... They said grilled chicken is served in this way... I didn't argue... Whatever it tasted good too... They don't serve mocktails... Pricing is pocket friendly... This is mainly a college students fav... Not recommend for family dinning...

Disappointed.
Worst cafe ever been.from entry to exit it was felling uneasy.i got the starter chilli baby corn and the quantity was so less that even single person can eat that out in just 2 mins.worst ambience.location of map is not correct it had taken 30 min just to locate the cafe.more than 500 miters accuracy check is needed.crowd are very cheap.the space is very very small not well decorated.it need a lots of improvement and zeal just the cute cover and colour of the place won't thrive for long.
But the other hand there are some good things.
service is good and also their behavior.
quality of the hukka and food is good..
Interior-(1/5)
Ambience-(2/5)
staff Competency-friendly nature(3.5/5)
¬†A cafe should take better care of customers.Parking is a big challenge.simple wastage of time money.i would suggest don't ever visit this place ever.the shittiest place i have ever been.

This is a relatively new place which has come up at Lake Gardens in the lane beside Balaram RadhaMallick Sweet shop. There is a lot of variety on the menu with a huge assortment of delicacies being available.Hookah is also served here. Quality wise both food and hookah were decent enough. Seats are very comfortable and the staff is also quite courteous. Ambiance and the crowd however needs some improvement but that is not totally in the hands of the management and hence can be overlooked. Overall a nice, decent cafe which was definitely needed in this part of the city.

Recently went to this place located in the lane just beside Balaram Mullick lake gardens... Ordered crispy chilly baby corn, chicken lollipop and Oreo milk shake. the baby corn was too salty.. the Oreo shake was not at all cold.. had to ask them to freeze it for a while even them it was warm.. and the lollipop smelled weird so I avoided having it.. 2 is only for the hookah!

Very poor ambience. Loud crowd. Terrible food. 
Service is ok but the quality of food stuff and ambience is extremely cheap.

A newly opened restaurant should take better care of custoners. Parking is a big big challenge.
