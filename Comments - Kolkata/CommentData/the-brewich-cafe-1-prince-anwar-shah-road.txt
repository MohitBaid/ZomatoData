The place is quite small and cozy. The ambiance is good. It's pocket friendly and the food is tummy filling. If the area is increased, it can be better but never the less, this is amazing as well.
Looking forward to visit again.

Me and one of my friend went to this cafe.....the ambience was good and even the food was also not that bad.

We ordered 2 cappacino and 1 chicken sandwitch....but we finished our cappacinos but then also the sandwitchwes didint arrive.....but the food was good....if you plan to visit this place please keep some time in your hand becoz it willll take time.

There's nothing fancy about this place except for the name. The food is average. Nothing great. The hot chocolate is above average though!! 
The pizza fries wasn't available when we ordered. We ordered for the chicken fries instead. Which is nothing exceptional. 
The staff seems to be really reluctant!

Located right at Lords More on the 1st floor, a very small outlet with 25 +- covers. Reaching to level one is a bit tricky as the stairs are really small and the entrance is also not maintained properly.

Interior is quite well maintained but however I didn‚Äôt feel to spend much time in there.

I ordered for:

‚Ä¢Chicken Slider: Slider buns were oversized, presentation was kind of ok. The mayonnaise was not properly stored and it was smelling of vegetable oil. Even it seemed that they have microwaved the burger patty.

The French Fries were coated with corn flour which is weird, anyhow it didn‚Äôt taste well.

‚Ä¢Oreo Frappe: The presentation was not same as displayed. However, the taste was satisfactory.

Menu and preparation styles needs improvement.

** There was only one server who was catering us, very we‚Äôll behaved and was concerned for our needs. Kudos to Chandan!

This place is located just near Lord's mor, Prince Anwar Shah Road. The cafe is on the first floor and the entrance is quite narrow with a lean staircase. It is not very spacious, very small accommodation, they have a separate room for a larger group tho. 
The decor is nothing special. The view of the busy road by the window is quite nice for enjoying your meal. 
We ordered -
1) Chicken pizza fries - The topping was ample and quite filling for two people. Taste is unique, like the name suggests, a blend of pizza and fries. What's there not to like about that? Recommended.
2) Honey glazed chicken wings - It was very well coated with the sweet honey and the crispy chicken went perfectly with it. 
3) Chicken hangover burger - The most talked about one! It's a huge burger and very very filling. The taste is good enough. It is their specialty indeed.  
      There is still room for improvement. I hope they brighten up their entrance. Happy eating. :)

You will find brewich just on the Lord's stoppage opposite to the side having bawarchi and other food joints. When I reached there the entrance surprised me with stinky smell and a really lean staircase.
It has two seating sections both are kind of small, they have a seating arrangement for larger groups though.

The decor and ambiance is a bit monotonous, the best part is the view of the busy road below if you are lucky enough to grab the window seat.
We placed orders for:

*Chicken slider- Portion was good enough, the mayo was stale and smelled, had to throw my buns away. But the Patty tasted pretty above my expectations. The supposed to be french fries with the sliders, turned out to be cornflour coated potato fritters, confirmed by our server Chandan who agreed the French fries were coated.(Maybe I come from different planet but even there french fries means deep fried matchsticks of potato)

*Chocolate frappe- The costliest beverage on menu and it has all the reasons to be so, I thanked my server for suggesting that it was a real savior. Loaded with ice cream and chocolate it was very tasty.

Service is great, you get interactive servers and they are quite well versed with the menu. Special thanks to chandan.
The rating is justified, wishing good luck to brewich!

Located in the Lords more..is very easy to locate. I visited this place for the second time and was quite satisfied with it. We bought two vouchers from Nearbuy which included a burger/sandwich and coffee/tea.
The cafe is small but its really comfy and has been designed in a very lucrative wooden style as well as gives you a very modern taste to it.With nice songs playing in the background the ambience is really very pleasing.The prices on the food is comparatively lower than other cafes but the food is really tasty and appetising.
Coming to the food now....
Roast chicken burger- It was really tasty with all that cheese and mayo ...it was a messy affair but trust me u will love it..the chickn was well cooked and served with crispy fries and tomato sauce it really was a good choice.
We had the masala chai and it was ok types ...not that bad...but I would not suggest it though.
Overall it was a good experience .You have to admire their quick service and gentle behaviour of their staff which for me always adds the brownie points for any restaurant or cafe.
My Ratings:-
Ambience and Decor- 4.5
Service- 4.0

A small cafe located at Lord's near Prince Anwar Shah road.The interiors are designed in American style.we bought a vouchere worth rupees 125/- from Near buy app,the offer consisted of 1STARTER(chicken  fingers,chicken nuggets,honey glaze chicken wings,saute mushrooms,potato wages)+2 SHAKES/MOCKTAILS  (from the menu ).but the cafe people dicided the menu for us.. they said that CHICKEN NUGGETS was available as the only starter , VANILLA & STRAWBERRY SHAKES were given as only option to us.so it's a suggestion for all that don't buy this coupons from Near buy app & visit this cafe. Overall the experience was not satisfactory.

Located at Lords More at Lake Gardens, I wanted to visit this place for long. Went with a lot of expectations, but to be honest, it failed to impress not only me but also the companions who went there with me. 

The place is small and can accomodate only 12-14 people. Whatever we were ordering, they were saying that those weren't available. We asked for french fries but they said their machine for making french fries wasn't working. Usually they provide french fries with most of their dishes but as they couldn't offer french fries, they promised to give chips. But when the dishes arrived our table, we found only a few pieces of chips. The taste of the dishes was not too good. But the beverage was good. 

They should clean their staircases well. It was stinking when we were going upstairs. Overall, it was not at all a good experience. But I hope they improve their food and beverage quality and their services.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Since this cafe is at a 5mins walking distance from my place, I never had the time to visit. Finally I managed to go there on a November evening. It is a small place overlooking the Lords Crossing. The staff is very friendly and this cafe has some dedicated regulars. We ordered
1. Bbq Cheese Fries: This was like a vegetable fry smeared with cheese. There was abundant paneer. The taste was good. 
2. Roasted Chicked Sandwich: It was really good and was served with french fries.
3. Chicken Sausage Burger: The burger was heavy and was served with french fries. I personally did not like the taste of the sausage.

We ordered chicken wings, latte, iced tea and chicken sandwich. The wings and tea were satisfactory. The place is small but the decor is nice. The roadside glass wall also provides a good look of the city life outside. The sandwich was a little disappointing. I hope to return here to try out more dishesh

A small place on the 1st floor with a capacity of seating 15 persons at the most, offers you a few mouth watering snack items, e.g. #chicken_hangover_burger 
#grilled_chicken_sandwich
There is a separate room where you can enjoy privacy (it is mainly given to a group of more than 3).
The place is quite easy to locate and the service is quite satisfactory. It certainly needs a try if Cafe is your choice.

Coming to food, we ordered Cappuccino, Chicken Sausage Burger, Roast Cicken Burger and Roast Chicken/French Fries. Cappuccino was good in taste, Burgers were very nice also but Chicken/French Fries was horrible, We could hardly find any Chicken. Moreover, you should give it a try!

This caf√© is situated at Lords' More on Prince Anwar Shah Road. It's a few shops to the right of Shawarma Nation on the main road.
The place is very small. It hardly has 4 tables. Around 10 people can fit in. The entrance is very narrow and climbing up the stairs might freak you out especially if you are tall. Ambience is fine. It wasn't populated when we entered. 
We had ordered chicken pizza fries, cold coffee and blue lagoon. Service is slow. We had to wait for almost 30 mins. The chicken pizza fries @‚Çπ130 were just french fries with a cheesy topping and pizza sauce. There was hardly any chicken. It just seemed like mashed potato. The fries were soggy. It was filling though and can be shared by two. The dish would have been much better if at least the fries were crispy. This was a huge let down given that our expectations were high. Cold coffee @‚Çπ100 was nice. It was served in an inverted bulb shaped container though it wasn't full. Chocolate sauce was added. It could have been more strong. Blue lagoon also priced at ‚Çπ100 tasted nice. 
GST was charged @18% though it has already been reduced to 5%. They said that they haven't been notified yet! Overall, it was a very average experience. I doubt if I would visit the place again (atmost for beverages I might) as there are way too many better options than this.

Situated at the Lord's more ,prince Anwar shah road it is very easy to locate and is a small place with cozy and quirky interiors.coming to the food ,we had ordered two all day breakfasts and a chicken slider along with coffee. The all day breakfast consisted of toast which was nice and crisp , hash brown , chicken sausage , chicken salami and poached egg, pocket maza  and french fries which were a replacement for red beans which were originally in the menu.the platter tasted good but could have been a little more filling.coffee was the ccd cappuccino u get ,so no complains with that.but for the sliders ,the meat was little less in comparison to the bread .so that tasted dry.but the pocket pinch was surprisingly less .so can't really Complain.

It gave us the vibes from an antique cafe shop, where there's pop music playing in the background and the smell of warm soothing cup of coffee. The appetizers are paradise for foodies. Pizzas +Fries who doesn't love that!! With a thick layer of cheese!! Woohooo‚ù§Ô∏è

A small yet warm caf√©, located at Lake Gardens more at the second floor of a sweet meat shop 'Brewich Caf√©', is one of my very favoured coffee shops in South Calcutta. 
The atmosphere here is always subtle and cozy and the staff is very friendly and you'll always be welcomes heartily. 
Coffee tastes deligiently good and the newly added burgers on the menu are a must try which always come accompanied with french fries and dips. 
Salads are efficient for two people to consume. 
Will always be my first option over other chains of caf√©s.

Brewich cafe is the best place to spend time with your friends over coffee and some snacks.
It is a small and cozy place , u can sit n chat while observing the busy roads outside.
We ordered ,
 Cold coffee - which was served in an inverted bulb bottle and served beautifully , tasted good
Butterscotch shake - the shake was pretty refreshing and the flavour was relishing 
Hot chocolate - perfect sweetness and a great blend
Regular fries - these were the best fries i have tasted till date, large fries ,soft and the perfect amount of crisp , enough to fill your stomach .
The place is quite reasonable and great to spend your entire day chatting .

Though cappuccino and espressos are not bad either. Sandwich lovers can go for club house sandwich. The chicken hangover burger is also good and it is one of their specialities. Another item which we also liked was shredded chicken omlette. The place is small but good enough to hangout with friends and family. Overall it was a good experience. Cheers to good food. Cheers to the team. Hope to visit again.

The service is fine but not too good since the number of people in the service is less. The cafe is not properly spacious but the food is good. Recommended to try out the hot chocolate and the chicken sandwiches.

The location is very convenient. The entrance,however,is little cramped. When we visited it,a number of items were not available unfortunately. But whatever we settled for was amazing enough to fetch it a 4.5 from me! 

The guy who was serving us was friendly and had a quirky sense of humor while communicating! We had : 

1. Oreo frappe : When we had asked the guy serving us about the presentation of this beverage,he said we should see it ourselves!  And we saw it to just be really amazed. With a perfectly scooped dollop of ice cream and an Oreo on top,they served the drink in a mason jar. The taste was beautiful. 

2. Chocolate shake : Thick and not very sweet. This was great too.

3. Chicken pizza fries : The fries have been a recommendation by fellow foodies. So we obviously had to try it. Crispy fries dressed with a tangy pizza sauce and olives. This was very filling and much satisfying to the taste buds. 

4. Chicken hangover burger : They served the poached eggs separately as my friend didn't want it inside his burger. The chicken patty was juicy and soft. 

The service was swift. The pricing seemed perfect.

Tucked in a corner along the Prince Anwar shah road this little eatery has several breakfast and snack items to offer.
When we visited the place we had availed all the Nearbuy vouchers. (Which by the way, one can still avail check the app)
1st voucher;
For starters we took Honey glazed chicken wings. They were okayish.
For mocktails, we took Blue Lagoon and Dry Fruit lassi. The former tasted the usual the latter was too sweet for my liking.
2nd voucher;
Breakfast inclusions, it consisted of Chicken sausage, Salami, Hash brown, 2 toasted breads, egg poach, red beans and 1 juice the juice they served was a 10rs Maaza. The platter had a really average taste.
3rd voucher;
We took a BBQ chicken sandwich and a Cappucino.
Now here's the catch the waiter served us half portions of every item. When we asked him he said that's how they serve in the vouchers which was not mentioned anywhere in Nearbuy.
Nevertheless, since our pocket pinch was very less we accepted this reluctantly.
I have also had their Roast chicken fries on home delivery it had a good taste but they make really soggy fries. The crispness of the fries need to ne worked on.
The ambience is quite good for a small cafe like this.

Location : Lords More . On the main road . Easily locatable . A narrow staircase leads you to the cafe which is situated on the first floor . 

Ambience : The cafe is very small . It ends as soon as you enter . The interiors have been done well and us funky . 

Food : We were there for a quick bite . We ordered the Pizza Fries which was probably the most sought after item there . And we knew why as soon as we had a bite . It was very cheesy and tasted very good . 

We also ordered the Slider ( 3 mini burgers ) . This was average . Not as good as I had expected it to be . We didn't like it . 

We had Hot Chocolate which was very yummy . Loved it more after every sip . 

Service : Too slow . The cafe was almost empty . But still they were very slow to serve us . 

Picket Pinch : 600 for 2 .

Ordered chickrn nuggets and chicken barbeque french fries via swiggy from this cafe.
When we ordered it was mentioned that 1 plate chicken nuggets would include 10 pieces..but when it arrived there were only 8 pieces. It was beyond my expectation. 
The chicken barbeque french fries was a bit different in taste..it was okayish. Overall an average experience it was..

This cafe located at Lords more..a new discovery on our part..ambiencewise cosy..just gives u the ideal cafewala feel..
We ordered chicken pizza fries..french fries garnished with grated chicken and onions fried seperately..honestly we dint like this dish..the fries were palatable..but the chicken went totally unnoticed by palate..
The hangover burger was a gem..the bread was perfect with sunny side up and minced meat with mashed potatoes was excellent..loved every bit of it..
The oreo frappe was perfect..topped with an oreo biscuit drenched with chocolate syrup..big block‚Äã of vanilla icecream..floating on the shake was amazing..not too sweet being the best part..
The masala soda was also good..minty..smooth..loved it..

We ordered a Crispy BBQ Veg Pizza French fries , a chicken slider and a Oreo Freppe. The crispy BBQ was a delight with perfect combination of spice and cheese making it totally worth the price. Oreo Freppe is a must order . Chicken slider was just a normal burger with chicken mayo and veggies and I would not recommend to order it.

My other name is perennially broke,  so you really cant blame me when I get excited because food is cheap. This place is highly recommended if you want a nice ambience a pretty place and mandatory AC (a little elitist, sorry). 
Try whatever you get there. The breakfast for 200 is enough to make you skip lunch. However if you dont have a lot of time, you might just realise that you are crazy late and have no time to attend the next class/work/whatever.

The Brewich Cafe.
Truly an amazing place. It's nice and cozy and gives you the comfy feeling which many cafes fail to provide. The food was simple yet tasty. Tried the Chicken Nuggets, BBQ Chicken Grilled Sandwich with Fries and Cold Coffee.
The Nuggets were served piping hot. The Sandwich was amazing and the fried were crisp from the outside with a soft interior. The Cold Coffee was served in a very interesting "bulb" and tasted heavenly.
Ambience and the Service was decent.
Extremely happy. :)

Ordered food from this place. Chicken Slider and Roast Chicken Salad Sandwich.

The Chicken Slider had a chicken patty and some cabbage in it. Pretty bad. The Roast Chicken Salad Sandwich was good. The fries served with it were the worst fries I've had in my life. They were far from being crunchy - they were cold and stale.

Really disappointed.

The visit to this place was a really special one and it definitely lived up to its expectations. A quaint little cafe location at a very convinient location exactly at Lord's crossing, it's every budget cafe lover's dream come true. The interiors are very basic but also very appealing and the small artifacts used make the place looks absolutely vibrant. Seating is very limited but we were fortunate enough to drop in during non- busy houes. (Special tip: try taking the couches. That's where the magic happens). A special round of applause to the genuinely good music collection that the cafe has, a must be place for the vh1 crowd and pop lovers. The food was undoubtedly amazing. We decided to settle with the chicken wings a burger and a sandwich along with the oreo smoothie and the guy was ever so polite with his personal suggestions on every selection. Orders may take some time, so you have to be patient, because every bite is absolutely worth it. Every burger and sandwich comes with a decent serving of fries that I personally liked more than McDonald's. Food quantity is balanced and the ambience makes this one of the places that would have you come back for multiple rounds.

Narrow Entry To this cafe !
Small Cafe but beautifully Decorated,
I just wish the Table Of The Inner Section (Private Section) of this Cafe could have been made little better as sometimes it becomes out of our reach to get the food from our sofa ,
Now Food Ordered -
1. Cappuccino - was good , nice smiley made on it ... 
2. Bbq Chicken Fries - the chicken tasted yumm with little cheese grated on top of it with french fries in the buttom ! 
3. Cold Coffee - it was well made..

At Lords More, near Shawarma Nation, you'll find a small passage that will take you upstairs to a small cabin which is supposedly this cafe. The cafe was empty and we took a table next to the window from where you get a view of traffic outside from 1st floor.

We were 2 and ordered Chicken Crockpot Sandwich for each of us and waited for around 15mins and were a bit disappointed with its size so we instantly ordered veg pizza fries.
The Chicken Crockpot Sandwich was average. The pictures are deceiving, its actual size is like a hotdog. Quality of the food is good.
Veg pizza fries arrived 25-30 mins after finishing the sandwich and when we tasted it, it has nothing to do with pizza. It is made of french fries in a bowl with lots of veggies on it covered with cheese. It doesn't taste bad though.
Space is an issue but nothing can be done for that but please improve your service.

Entered to a small yet interesting room, simple decor, decent ambience accompanied by some relaxing sofas & comfortable seating & a calm environment with just another couple being present(it was a Monday).
The waiters were extremely well-mannered & quick in their approach.We ordered the following -

1)Chicken Slider - 3 relatively good-sized burgers were served along with french fries.They were extremely tasty, cheesy & filling for 2.But yes, the french fries could be improved a bit.(4.5/5)

2)Chicken Pizza Fries - Sprinkled cheese on top,chicken pieces mixed with french fries, it was okayish but could be improved, became monotonous in taste after a while.(4/5)

3)Hot Chocolate - It was just delicious. Probably the best order of ours.Though quantity was a bit less, it had the perfect thickness,chocolaty and felt awesome on the taste buds(4.5/5)

Overall,it's a nice place for a casual relaxed evening.GST is charged on the menu prices. Pretty reasonable.I may visit again.

This place was not a part of my bucket list. Yet we visited the outlet once as it's convenient to locate. The place is cosy and small and nothing spectacular about the decor apart from the fact that they've a private area to hangout with your gang.
Though the food was good. We ordered a chicken BBQ sandwich, chicken pizza fries and Oreo frappe. Oreo frappe was beyond words!! As the outlet isn't spacious so I might not prefer visiting there with my gang. But one can try this place when 2 or 3 in number. Food was good at a pocket friendly price. So opting this place for eating out or take aways would not be a bad idea.

It is a small establishment on the Lord's crossing. The entire place gives you a kind of an old school feeling with all the wood work and chairs and flooring. The playlist that they had was very good, not too loud or heavy, just good relaxing music which wont come in between your conversations. Coming to the price band, all the items are decently priced and not expected to pinch your pocket.
Coming to the food, it was good. My orders included veg mushroom and cheese burger and pizza based french fries. Both the dishes were filled with cheese, just the way any cheese lover would want it. The fries were something different and tasted good. The oreo frappe was thick and smooth.

I had not heard of this cafe before, but on a search in zomato I found it and saw that it has pretty good ratings. So I decided to check it out.

On visiting the place, my first impression of the cafe wasn't amazing, given its location and size. But I waited for the food, because that is the crux of the matter.

I had ordered :

Drinks - Oreo shake and Strawberry Smoothie

Sandwich - BBQ Chicken sandwich

Fries - Chicken Pizza Fries.

The shake was good. But you won't get your extra scoop of ice cream and oreo in this shake. For that you need to order Oreo Frappe. The smoothie was nice too. It was made with yoghurt. The shakes and smoothies are pretty thick so they are quite filling.

The sandwich tasted good. The chicken was slathered in sauces.

The pizza fries were great. There was a LOT of molten cheese on it, so much so that you'll probably be done with cheese for a week. The marinara sauce in which the fries are tossed in was nice too.

Their burgers are apparently good, but that I left for some other time, as this time it satiated us completely.

I rated this place a 3.5 because the ambience also plays an important role apart from the food. So if you are just plain hungry after a tiring day then do drop in. The food is good.

The place is very small but cozy. Decor and ambience is pretty okay. The menu is a little different from what is shown here in Zomato. We ordered a chicken hot dog sandwich and two plates of chicken slider. The sandwich was tasty but the quantity is not ample to full your satiety. The chicken sliders were juicy, tasty and sumptuous. One plate 'can be' shared by two. Food is very cheap, so yes, it is very pocket friendly given the number of dishes we ordered. Our bill just came to 536/- for 3 people which is not even 200 bucks. Service is very slow. There is just a single person taking orders as well as bringing and serving the food but he is friendly.
The place could have improved with its menu i.e the types of food available( since there's only sandwiches and burgers to chose from beside tea, coffee and shakes). And it would have been wonderful if service was a bit faster.

So we landed up here for some evening adda.. this place is small but is cozy and has a nice vibe to it. It is divided in to sections. When we visited the place.. we took the smaller section to ourselves as the place was quite crowded.

Coming to the food...
Cottage cheese french fries- veggies, cottage cheese, French fries and loads of cheese.... This just cannot go wrong.

Barbeque chicken sandwich- two pieces of perfectly made sandwich served with chips and tomato ketchup. Really nice!

Hangover burger- loaded with chicken, hash brown and poached egg... You need to get messy to devour this. This was one heck of a burger. Served with potato chips and ketchup. Strongly recommended!

Vegan Sliders- three medium sized juicy burgers with chips and ketchup. For all the vegetarians out there...must try!

Cold coffee- nice thick cold coffee served in a bulb shaped container.

Oreo frappe - this thing is huge and flowing out of the mason jar that it is served in... Must must try.. the best of them all!

This place has good food and even better price... Recommended to people who are around the area. Shall re-visit for sure!

We ordered Bar-B-Q chicken sandwich, chicken sausage sandwich and roast chicken burger ! The sandwiches were well prepared but the burger was just plain AWESOME ! If u go there, please do try the roasted chicken burger once, u will never regret :) And talking about the price, it's on the lower side. We sat there for about 2 hours. A good hangout place with friends and even for a date :)

"The Brewich Cafe" has been the talk of the town for sometime now. It is located at Lake Gardens crossing just beside "Haragouri Mistanna Bhander". The cafe is located in the first floor and has two rooms. The ambience was very nice as music was being played in the cafe.

We went for one "Chicken Pizza Fries" first. The food was delivered to us within ten minutes. It was delectable to say the least. Fried chicken and veggies,topped with molten cheese was perfect for that rainy weather. It had a bit of extra garlic,still,it was great.

Up next,we ordered "Chicken Crockpot Sandwich" which was served within ten minutes with french fries and sauce. This is the best sandwich that I have ever tasted. It was filled with chicken,cheese and veggies. The french fries served with it were delicious as well.

Finally,we went for the "Oreo Frappe". Let me be honest here, this Oreo Frappe is the best ever. It was filled with ice-cream and very little ice. It was delicious and was served in copious amount. I loved it.

The staff was well behaved and amiable. I will definitely visit again.

my son was craving for burgers and did not want to have the cliche ones from kfc/mcd. so, while searching through zomato near me (jadavpur), got this place and home delivery option was available :)
so, ordered:
chicken sausage burger - was ok. size was fine. chicken amount was adequate.
roast and chicken salad sandwich - very good. good combo with veggies.
honey glazed chicken wings - chicken pieces were small. very sweet.
lemon herb chicken burger - the best what i got. very tasty.
crispy honey chili fries - not at all crispy and the honey amount was too much causing high sweetness.
the food did satisfy our appetite but did not have the complete satisfaction as quality was not wow. definitely worth a try if you want some quick bites in the evening.

One of the finest caf√©s in the area. Everything on the menu is pocket-friendly. The place might be small, but the ambience is pleasant. The staff are friendly and they play good music.

P.S: Do try the bbq cottage cheese salad.

The Brewich Cafe is a small cozy cafe with 2floors located at the heart of Lords More, opposite to Kalpana Misthana Bhandar. Ambience is not that good- quite okhayish. Having going through the menu, my best friend and i ordered blue lagoon, lemon iced tea, bbq cheese french fries and chicken wings. Loved the drinks especially the lemon iced tea but we were extremely disappointed with the fries due to its lack of crunchyness and providing the flavour. Truly the fries lacked that spark. Coming to the wings, it was delicious. Overall this cafe is quite moderate though the dribks brought smiles to our faces. Will i visit again? Maybe.

Just an awsm cafe near my location. Though it occupies a small space what makes this cafe big is its quality of food. I think burgr is the signature item here. I have tried sandwch, coffee nd burgr which r excellent in taste.. Will visit soon.

It is mandatory for everyone to visit dis place and experience what i experienced once atleast... loved my experience... would love to visit again and again

The cafe is located at the Lords More. We had visited this place with a lot of expectations but we were really disappointed. We didn't like the food quality at all. The strawberry milkshake was good though. Service was a bit slow. This cafe is missing out on the most important thing- the food.

This cafe is located in Lord's More two shops crossing Shawarma Nation. The cafe looks like a small chamber with 3-4 tables and a private booking area in the next room. The long French windows are appealing where you can eat your food and look outside. It's a nice place to spend quality time with your loved ones. 
I went with a friend for evening snacks and we ordered :
1. Chicken Sliders- they serve 3 medium sized chicken burgers in a long tray with French fries. The burgers are cheesy and juicy with the chicken patty. It's filling and one can be shared by 2.
2. Hot chocolate- it's my favourite so I had to order it.It was thick, rich in chocolate and I loved it.
3. Mango shake- the Mango shake was thick and sweet, served in a mason jar. 
4. Roasted chicken sandwich- this one has two large grilled sandwiches served with French fries. They have a good amount of chicken and mustard sauce inside which melts in your mouth in no time.
The place gives positive vibes, the staff is humble, the presentation is good, the food tastes very good, the price is very reasonable. I would love to visit this cafe again.

Located at lords more.
Very tiny place, they don't have proper arrangement for washroom, first aid kit and emergency exit or fire exit also. Less staff's are present, food service is very slow and the taste of food and quality of food is not upto the mark but food quantity is sufficient and guys please upgrade your food service and quality if u want to survive in this sales market. 

Just for one time visit,  it's a good place otherwise it's simple waste your time(already told that there service is too slow) and waste of money (food quality and quantity is not good and sufficient).

Located near South City(just ,onene stop away) on the second floor of a building.The place is very easy to find and is on a quiet populated area.To sum it up I was more excited and Curious about the location and wanted to go there from a long time.Secondly the decor is also good, top view, chairs, bottles.The location and the decor of the place will attract you more than the food.Now coming back to FOOD..
I didn't like anything else except the Coffee.I should rather teach them how to make friench fries.The food is not worth the money they take.Heard they make better Wings and Burgers so really want to visit the place again.Still have high hopes.Well the BBq chicken fries were utter disappointment,never try that .Other than FOOD I liked everything üòÇ

The place is kind of cute.. it's small and cozy. I loved their burger..  price is reasonable..  so it's a good place for casual evening snacks or to hangout with friends. But their main problem is that they don't have waiters. There is only one man...who takes the order..then he serves the food.. and again..he is the one who goes to the counter to make the bill. So you know.. you got to wait for a very long time..   we had to wait for an hour..  for one chicken slider.. but overall it's a good place. :( 
 I would still love to visit this place again...

I had booked a coupon on nearbuy worth rs 125 (saved a lot, trust me) . It inculded two shakes and one starter. Though it was mentioned that any shake from the menu can be ordered but the staff told us that choclate shake was excluded. So we took one honey glazed chicken wings , a blue lagoon and a dry fruits shake. 
The dry fruits shake was very bad , dont order it people. The blue lagoon and chicken wings were superbly tasty. Also the staffs were courteous and helpful and the ambience was quite nice. Looking forward to further visits (if i get such a nice bargain, though).

Had been longing to visit this place for a while. It's a small cozy place with wooden floors and a a beautiful road view. The decor of this place seemed to be done with careful attention and it looked pretty. 
Coming to the food and service, when we entered the cafe, there was nobody to cater to our orders. We even tried peeping into the counter and there was a lady (probably the management/owner) who had to go upstairs and call the waiter. We tried ordering for plain fries, which weren't available. We settled for chicken BBQ fries, sliders, cafe latte and hot chocolate. The fries weren't all that great. It had an achaari taste, which was good, but I couldn't taste any chicken because of the overpowering achaar flavour. The fries were very very soggy as well. The sliders tasted good, no complaints on that one. The hot chocolate was pretty thick and tasteful but it was waaaaaayyyy too sweet. My coffee was extremely watery. Absolutely no taste of coffee or milk. I don't have sugar, hence it absolutely lacked any kind of taste. I had asked for more milk in my coffee, which the waiter provided me with, so brownie points on that. But it didn't do me any good. I had to add brown sugar and borrowed a little hot chocolate from my friend in order to make my coffee gain some flavor.
It was an average experience overall. Would probably not visit again.

One of the finest cafe I've been. Private and comfortable. Pretty good interior, away from all the chaos. Background music keeps playing throughout, refreshing your mind, and it offers yummy snacks in affordable range! Not a lot of staff, actually only one or two people i saw, but it didn't cause delay for our food items to reach us.
I left my cellphone in there, and went back after around half an hour or 45 minutes, and found it safely with the person in-charge, honest staff too!

Location: Lords more beside Axis bank ATM.
Decor: Well lit and cozy. Perfect for an evening date.
Food: DELICIOUS! The staff was really friendly and on his recommendation we ordered a Chicken Roast Burger and a Chicken BBQ sandwich with two cappuccinos. The food was very tasty and unlike most sandwiches served at other caf√©s, the quantity here is adequate. Coffee was just okay.
Price: Compared to most caf√©s in Kolkata, the price here is cheap and since the food is really good, I would say a few more bucks is worth it.

Highly recommended! Will definitely be back for more.

Visited this cafe few months back with my friend in the evening...Located at the Lord's More to the left while coming from South City Mall side...

The cafe is at the first floor thus we took the stairs up...it is a small cafe with nicely done wooden interiors and colourful sofa seats...we sat near the main entrance but later noticed seating arrangement was also there at a room annexed to ours..

We ordered a Cardamom Tea, a Lemon Tea and a BBQ Chicken Sandwich...I loved the Cardamom tea but my friend did not enjoy the Lemon tea as inspite of mentioning not to add sugar, the attendant added honey to it which my friend did not wish for... next time kindly give customer preference..The BBQ Chicken Sandwich came with french fries and was damn tasty with rightly blended stuffing...we both savoured it thoroughlly..

The best part was when our bill came to only 220 bucks...it was a real deal..

Overall good food..nice ambience..reasonable pricing..easy location...prompt service..would like to visit again surely..

An evening in the monsoon and a lot of time to kill landed me in this cafe. It is one of those places that lay hidden in plain sight. However the polite maitre'd/manager/waiter took up one additional role of the navigator in his job description and there I was. The recommendation was the chicken slider burger and my girlfriend's‚Äã sweet cravings added chocolate shake to it. However her craving was not fulfilled that day, thanks to the glutton accompanying her. Several helpings later the marginal utility didn't reduce and therefore we concluded that it was a great concoction. The polite host was the icing on the cake. 
P.S. I've been told they are opening an outlet in my locality shortly. Looking forward to it.

After going on a hunt in zomato to look for a pocket friendly place to eat I came across this cafe.Me and my friend had ordered the chicken sliders and honey glazed chicken wings along with mango lassies. Everything that we ordered was perfect.!! No complains..!! However, the same cannot be said about their service. After half an hour of our arrival they served us the chicken slider. When we were almost done with it they served the chicken wings and when we were almost done with that they served us the Lassi. This disappointed and frustrated me a lot since I'm not a food sharer and would rather have what I ordered by myself than to share dishes.

They said they have a special item chicken hangover burger.But when we asked for it,they said they don't have an egg to serve with along the burger.So it took some more time.Ambience is just OK types.Not a very good experience,quite average.

Its a small place with impressive decor ,awesome food and good service.Couples will enjoy the place specifically as they create a romantic setup by giving a jar with a candle lit inside.We had ch pizza french fries,cold coffee,roasted chicken sandwich and chicken cheese crockpot steak sandwich.All the dishes were mindblowingly tasty but pizza fries and crockpot sandwich deserves special mention.Crockpot sandwixh is highly recommended as one will have a melt in the mouth experience and it was fully loaded with mayo cheese chicken .Incase of pizza fries there was an upper layer of chicken loaded with cheese and pizza toppings ,beneath which there were crisy french fries.For a french fry lover like me it was heavenly.
P.s.prices mentioned in the menu are inclusive of taxes.

Situating right at such a prime location, this cafe ought to deliver something special and yes there's not much disappointment.
Starting with the interiors, this little space has been beautifully decorated. That seat beside the window has a charm in it.
Service is poor, you might have to take your phone out and finish at least three levels of your favorite game.
Food is decent but with a very limited menu on offer.

¬¨This 'Hangover Chicken Burger' fails to give you a food high xD
¬¨Chicken wings (Honey Glazed) are sweet and spicy. Chicken size is normal.
¬¨Chicken Cheese Omlette is pretty good.
¬¨The Coolers certainly look good on the table but they are not quite refreshing.
*They do not serve pork.

It is a small place and lesser accommodation facility. 

The interiors are really impressive. 

The service is appreciable.

Ordered 1.Chicken Roast & Salad Burger - The burger was really very tasty and worth the price.
 Along with it i preferred to have coffee so i ordered Cappuccino which was also fine enough.

Taste- 4/5

Ambience- 3.5/5

This is a late review..Last 2 week before I had visited this small but well organised cafe named The Brewich..our food journey started with coffee , continued with shredded chicken omlet, grilled chicken sandwich, chicken sausage sandwich, chicken wings and ended with mango snake and dry fruit shake..many items that we had enjoyed that day.. Sandwiches were served with french fries and omlet was  with grilled bread..
All the items were too good.. Specially the omlet and grilled chicken sandwich..
Decoration is nice and arranged and they served within few times.. They have packing facility also but that not require extra charges....
A simple but nice hangout place.. Go with friends or your special person, enjoy food and have adda..

Have been in this place yesterday, it's a small cafe situated at lords more. We had chicken roasted burgers and latte, it was good but I think the burger could have contained a little more chicken inside of it but other than that everything else was great

This is a small but cozy place in lords more, prince Anwar Shah road. We had Chicken slider. It consists of three mini sized burgers. It was very good to taste. But what amazed me more was the presentation. Next we ordered honey glazed chicken wings which was not that good. Quite pocket friendly. Both the platters were 150 rupees each.

Small yet comfortable, the ambience is okayish. Service is a bit slow but that doesn't count if you're with your friends. The food is good and pocket friendly. Do try out the Chocolate Shake and Barbeque chicken sandwich.

Very convenient location on top of haragauri sweet shop at lords , you will find a cozy place to enjoy gala time with your friends. Even on a Wednesday evening we had to wait a bit and we managed to grab a good seat beside the window.
Now coming to the food we ordered chicken slider and chicken pizza fries. Both were amazing. The slider was pretty good to taste , but pizza fries were very creative and deserves some special mention. Very tangy and flavourful. Though we were quenching for something refreshing we could only find hot drinks which we did not want to opt on such a hot summer evening.
Overall we loved the experience , and very much pocket friendly. The best part is they offer menu which is inclusive of tax. Staff is friendly. Though the service was a bit slow , but worth the wait. Only suggestion , they should include more drinks in their menu. Definitely recommended. :)

Not at all good with the experience.. Heard a lot about this place.. So me and one of my friends planned to visit the place..
Its a small cafe with not much decor but the ambience was good...
But the food we ordered gave us utter disappointment.. We ordered for
‚óè Chicken cold salad Sandwich: It was 120 bucks. Tasted good bcz of its cheese and chicken fillings.. But the French fried served with it was soggy and not so good.
‚óè Cold Coffee: It is served in a bulb shaped container and it looks too cute but the taste was not satisfactory enough.. Its priced 100 bucks.
‚óè Roast chicken fries: Priced 130 bucks, the chicken was in the form of keema and its was full of soggy french fries and bellpepper..
‚óè Hot chocolate: And it was worst... Felt like chocolate horlicks was served.. We couldn't even finish half of the drink.. It was of 70 bucks.
Our bill was 420 bucks including taxes.
The price rates r reasonable..And the service is too slow. It wasn't worth the visit.

I went there last night with few friends and sister, was impressed by the nice decor.. They have a waiting room for guest with ac & tv.. We were wanting to stay in that compartment and wishing if we could get served there... Luckily the attendant asked us if we could have the food in that place and we agreed.. We had 3 types of chicken sandwiches.. One with extra cheese slice with a charge of Rs. 10 extra for that.. All of us liked the food and appreciated.. Though we were running short in time so we couldn't order more.. But I'll be visiting soon again for the Chicken Pizza Fries and Burgers... The attendant was very much friendly and jolly as well... 
P.s.- I've got a habit of forgetting to take photos of the food when it comes to me... üòÖ

Went to this place today with my friends after reading several positive reviews about it on zomato. It's just on lord's more difficult to locate a bit, beside the axis bank atm on the main road. The interior is quite small can hardly accomodate about 10/15 people at once. Their sofas are a bit uncomfortable. Now, the food, after reading so much praise about the chicken pizza fries, I ordered it, the waiter recommended us to take honey glazed chicken wings, along with that we ordered a cold coffee and chocolate shake.

I did not like the chicken pizza fries AT ALL, neither did my friends, it only contained cheese and French fries with very few chicken pieces!

The honey glazed chicken wings were a bit hard on the outside, still quite tasty.

The chocolate shake was AWESOME! Iooooved it.

The cappuccino, okayish!

The best thing, they didn't charge any extra tax. Overall we had a nice experience! Hope to visit again.

Previous reviews encouraged me to visit this cafe but this cafe gave me nothing but disappointment.
A small cosy cafe with impressive decor.
We ordered for :
‚ñ™ chicken cold salad sandwich with extra cheese priced at 120 rupees. The only item which was delicious. Mouth smacking chicken fillings in the sandwich was appreciated. It was served with french fries which was a bit soggy.
‚ñ™ Cold coffee served in a bulb. Sounds impressive? Doesnt taste so. The consistency was not right. More unsatisfied because it costed 100 bucks.
‚ñ™ Hot chocolate priced at 70 rupees tasted like chocolate horlicks. We had to struggle to finish it but couldnt. Left half of it.
‚ñ™ roast chicken fries priced at 130 bucks. Again a waste of money because there was chicken nowhere in the dish, but a bit of keema french fries and bellpepper. It was not flavourful.
Our bill was 420 rupees inclusive of tax.

The service was extremely slow as there was only one person serving all six tables.
Definitely not a recommended cafe.

Well!! A very small cafe located near Lords Moore Anwarshah road.

Brewich Cafe is quite homely and very small. Wooden walls and window seatings make up the cafe. 

But they are very passionate and their serving style is very unique. 

Pocket friendly and few good food. Not all the foods taste good here. But they have the most friendly amd welcoming staff of this locality, i must say.

The service is not fast and takes a hell lot of time and if you are looking for fast service, then forget it. XD

The food is quite good. Though not upto the mark, but okay. I like their Cold Coffee though..tasty and seved in a large electric Bulb shaped glassware.

The place has a good taste for music but the ambience is not so enjoyable, to be honest.

Overall a pretty pocket friendly place for quick snacks and sips. But dont expect it to be something OTT. 


Decent and good staff behaviour ..

Soumen's ratings :-

Food: 3/5
Ambience : 3/5
Sevice : 4/5

Happy food hunting...... :)

This not so old... small cozy cafe is located at Lords more next to Axis Bank ATM in the narrow lane... One need to take left to the upstairs in the 1st floor.

Ambience is quite good and I liked it.
Service is quite slow as here just a guy manages the whole thing and he is sober and cooperative.

I went there in the evening and it was quite crowded with people at that time.

We were five friends there and we tried chocolate milkshakes, cold coffee, Vegan slider (which contain 3 mini burgers).

Shake tastes OK
Cold coffee tastes Good.
Vegan slider was quite good as well.

Shakes as well as cold coffee they serves so nicely... Innovative üëå

Pocket pinch isn't high.
Recommendable ‚ù§

Except for the slow service, nothing was disappointing. A small cafe on Lords road. Just perfect place to hang out with small group of friends.. Yummy food at pocket friendly prices. I went there with my friend. We ordered BBQ chicken sandwich, chicken sliders which comprised of 3 small burgers, chocolate shake and cold coffee. I loved the chocolate shake. Another plus point of this cafe is they don't charge extra tax or vat. Will soon visit this place again to try out other items.

This place had been on my mind since quite some time, and finally I made it there today in the evening. The place is small and cozy. An ideal place to spend a lazy evening with friends over a cup of coffee, some nibbles and board games.
We ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich, Chicken slider (which comprised of three mini chicken burgers), chocolate shake and cold coffee. The food was great. The only thing that was a disappointment was the slow service. The waiters were courteous, but took a great deal of time to serve the food, considering we did not order too much!
Overall the experience was good enough. The bonus being the reasonable price!

Bookmarked this cafe after going through positive reviews and my today's visit to this place is quite good. The cafe can be very easily spotted as it's just on the Lords More stoppage beside the main road. The dining area is quite small but nicely arranged. We sat comfortably on the couple seat beside the window. Our today's food journey includes,

* Shredded Chicken Omlette
* Chicken Wings
* Roasted Chicken Sandwich
* Chicken Sausage Sandwich
* Coffee
* Mango Shake
* Dry Fruits Shake

Firstly coming to the sandwiches, both of them was good but the roasted chicken sandwich tasted more yummy. Both the sandwiches were served with french fries and sauce dips. The shredded chicken omlett was quite unique and super tasty and also it was served with grilled breads and sauce dip. Seriously this dish was good both in quantity and quality. The Chicken wings tasted delicious with perfect sweet chilly flavor. Coffee was as usal and both the shakes tasted fine. 
Their service was nice. The staff was friendly as well as well mannered. Prices were reasonable and inclusive of taxes. So definitely recommended.

We ordered Chicken dipped with honey which I felt  was overcooked or a bit bitter. Chicken slider was good enough served with French fries. The ambience was good with nice decor. Hence, nice experience. Pocket friendly too.

Went here yesterday to try their famous Oreo Frappe which I had heard amazing things about.
The service was super slow. There was only one person managing the whole thing and he clearly wasn't able to cope up with the orders.
The sad thing is that, although the Oreo Frappe was amazing, we found stands of hair in it. On informing the staff, he promptly replaced it and apologised. But this kills the experience completely.
The Oreo Frappe was good. A perfect blend of sweet and creamy and the ice cream made things even better.
Would have rated higher if the mishap didn't happen.

This place is adjoining to my office ! The most attractive thing about this place is its interior . How a small place can be decorated in a funky style like this can be learned from them . Now coming to the foods , we had bbq chicken fry .. not so good . Then we had the chicken sausage burger , it was so fully loaded abd i loked the taste of it too. Chicken nuggets is just chicken nuggets as regular ones thatvu can get in supermarkets fridge packed . Cold coffee was so so . Overall the taste of foods was not so die for .. but they r good only . Try once.

This place was quite easy to locate as on standing at the Lord's more,The Brewich Caf√© stands in front. This is one of the best caf√© in town,for the food they serve and friendly service. I decided to catch up with few friends and I haven't regretted my decision.
We decided to order:
Beverages:
‚óèFresh lime soda
‚óèMango lassi ('tis the season)

Starters:
‚óèChicken pizza fries(Highly recommended dish)
‚óèBBQ chicken fries
‚óèChicken wings(the waiter had suggested this,and trist me we were left licking our fingers)

Main course:
‚óèChicken slider(a platter comes with three mini buns topped with cheese with great filling and fries)

I would higy recommended this place because the food is delicious also doesn't dig a hole in the pocket.
They do not levy any extra tax :p which is another reason which this place should be bookmarked.
The decor is simple yet attractive,the only problem is the small area but I felt that they have utilised the available space in a great way.

I had planned long time back on visiting this cafe. Located at a very convenient spot, right at the Lord's crossing , it's a very humble cafe with an extremely homely ambience. 

We ordered the following :

1.Cold coffee : It was extremely refreshing and delicious. It was served in a bulb shaped glass , that looked very cute. The flavour did justice to the appearance. Amazing. 

2. Crockpot chicken steak sandwich : The filling was very juicy and stuffed with a generous filling of juicy tender chicken and mayo and cheese . It was very tasty. Loved it. 

3. Chicken pizza fries : A very innovative dish. It has nothing to do with a pizza bread. It's a saut√© of chicken, crispy onions, veggies and crispy fried potatoes, garnished with generous proportions of cheese. Again, another tasty dish totally worth the price. 

Had a lovely time here. Wish to visit soon. Strongly recommended ! :)

Tucked in the lord's more near Prince Anwar Shah road, The brewish caf√© is surely one of the best caf√© of the city.
Somewhat underrated, but I don't know why.
The entrance is very narrow and congested, might not be very appealing initially but once you've entered the place the atmosphere welcomes you with a feeling of warmth.
The very cosy and bright ambience, with a modernistic minimal d√©cor and good music is what you get while you spend some quality time with your friends over great food :)
The staffs are very friendly and cooperating and the service is quick.
Coming to the food, though the menu is limited there isn't any bit of compromise when it comes to the taste.
We ordered 3 platters of chicken slider, 1 chicken wings, 1 chicken pizza fries and 1 BBQ chicken fries.

The chicken slider comes along with some fries which were crisp enough, 3 small burgers which were pretty tasty and some generous amount of grated cheese on the top, because cheese makes everything better... Isn't it?

The platter of BBQ chicken fries was okayish, a bit disappointing since the flavours were a little bland for my taste.

The platter of Chicken pizza fries was something which we ordered based on zomato reviews and it was possibly our best pick! The taste was something different from the kind of fries which we usually get... Here there were multiple layers of French fries topped with generous portion of chicken pieces, onions and melted cheese. Also, the taste of oregano have a perfect touch to the name, pizza fries.

Lastly, the Chicken wings platter was something which wasn't our pick at first but rather the waiter suggested us. Lucky were we to go by it, because there was literally a phase when we friends were snatching over the pieces just to get to eat the last bite :P
It was without any doubt the standout, out of so many things...And probably something which will make me want to visit this place again :)

......And the best part of this review is yet to arrive,
The price!
Bill for 5 people came to somewhere around 1050, and they don't even levy tax!

In the day of so many fancy caf√©s that are opening in every nook and corner of the city, this small little cafe will always have a soft corner inside my heart...So people, do visit this place for some good times :)Ujjayani Ghosh Souparna Nath Senjuti Kundu

The place is pretty small .
Though the decor of the place is pretty cute and they have tried to utilize the maximum place yet it looses some charm.The road view is lovely .

1.Ambience - I went in the afternoon so there was just my group and it was fun but otherwise the place becomes clumsy.

2.Food - I tried their cold coffee which was awesome and the Honey Chicken Wings that also was recommended and it was yummy .
They have great variety of sandwiches but personally i am not a big fan of it .

You can afford to pay here a visit 

3. Service- Service was helpful.

Its a small and cute cafe placed just opposite to 
Lords more. If you are a bit budget conscious, then just go for this cafe without any hesitation. You can chill with friends while listening to their well selected playlist. Now coming to the food part, we loved all the recipes :)) 
We ordered chicken slider, but they insisted us to have chicken wings which is named in the menu as chicken wings (honey glazed) instead, since its one of their signature items. It was awesome. It was neither sweet nor spicy and was a bit crunchy. We loved the taste. 
Then we went for club house sandwich. It had three layers with shredded chicken, egg, cheese and mayonnaise served with french fries and shredded cheese. It was again an awesome dish. It was yummy and hugely fulfilled our appetite. 
From lassi we had maggo lassi. After all those delicious recipes, the lassi completed our hunger. :))
It's a pocket friendly restaurant with no hidden taxes. Will visit again surely. :))

Well. Got to know about this restaurant from this very special app and thought of ordering something good at the end of the day but alas the food was not that much great as I thought it would be. Leaving the ambience and hospitality aside (I ordered for home delivery) they give much smaller portion as compared to dineout. The sandwitch was a 3 layered one but only of a single piece as in most restaurant they do give 2 in no. The most disgusting part was they just gave a 5rs Lays packet instead of cheese potato wedges. Like why will I order and wait for 30 minutes just to get a Lays that I can buy from my neighborhood shop? üòêüòêüòë. The only good thing was they were punctual with time and didn't took more than 30 minutes. Should give equal importance on home delivery also on both quality and quantity.

It's small, yet a sweet cafe with all reasonable prices. Behaviour of the staff is very polite. Food arrived quickly. It's a total paisa wasool place.purchased vouchers from nearbuy and i can't believe i got so much to eat for just rs 220rs approx. Pics give below. Food was also very tasty.

A good place,nice decor.
But i think they have a very small workforce.
Very slow service and the food was not up to the mark.
I expected something better from this place.

Well. Got to know about this restaurant from this very special app and thought of ordering something good at the end of the day but alas the food was not that much great as I thought it would be. Leaving the ambience and hospitality aside (I ordered for home delivery) they give much smaller portion as compared to dineout. The sandwitch was a 3 layered one but only of a single piece as in most restaurant they do give 2 in no. The most disgusting part was they just gave a 5rs Lays packet instead of cheese potato wedges. Like why will I order and wait for 30 minutes just to get a Lays that I can buy from my neighborhood shop? üòêüòêüòë. The only good thing was they were punctual with time and didn't took more than 30 minutes. Should give equal importance on home delivery also on both quality and quantity.

It's a really small cafe just near the Lord's more, tollygaunge.
Nothing really special. The shakes were okish and burger were average. But the service is really good. They greet you with warm welcome and food will be at your plate as soon as possible.

Quite a small place with weird entrance and dangerous stairs (specially for people above 5'6")..Slow service and quite clumsy makes this place quite odd for having a good time and the music has nothing to do with the kind of ambience...Food is average,cold coffee was served in a fancy new way..

Hey friends if you are choosing this from nearbuy then please don't go.They don't serve you the same as their direct customer. We have bought the coupon which includes 1 nonveg starter and 2 mocktails/shakes. First of all they told us that chicken wings(one of the recommended items) was not available then we have ordered nuggets and they served us only 5 pieces of it, but as per reviews on zomato the dish contains 8pieces of nuggets, then they have served small amount of drinks and they did not serve us mango lassi in a bulb as they do usually.The lime soda was not good. Chicken nuggets were pretty average and mango lassi was good in taste.

Cozy Cafe at Lords More

Food: Didn't have much food here. Ordered an Oreo Shake, a Mango Lassi n a plate of chicken wings. The drinks were nicely made and the chicken wings can put KFC to shame. The Oreo shake was so filling that both of us had to take turns to finish it. Quality n quantity both were satisfying.

Ambience: The location of the cafe is exactly at the Lords More and the tables were placed facing the glass windows. The view is good and goes well with the cozy, modern ambience of the cafe. The place is small in size but boasts of minimalistic decorations and is very comfortable. 

Service: Service is pretty fast and the staffs are very supportive in making ur choice of drinks. Also we chatted for 2 long hours seating with only 2 drinks and the staff was good enough to not ask us to vacate our seats. The pocket pinch is also much less as compared to other cafes located in the area.

Overall: The card facility is not yet activated. So carry some cash for payments. Also, no extra taxes r charged as the food prices r inclusive of all taxes. Overall a very nice place to have some snacks n chatting with friends without creating a big hole in pocket. A must visit place for college couples as well. Will definitely recommend this place to friends.

It is located near Lords, Anwarshah. A small cafe but the staff is super friendly. The food quality is really good. The prices are very cheap. The chicken pizza fries looks superb but taste wise it is not up to the mark as it has to much of French fries. The ones who like French fries can go ahead and order it. The bbq chicken sandwich is great and is accompanied by French fries. The mango shake is the best I had in a long time. Very pocket friendly.

Visited this two weeks ago with a friend 
It is very easy to locate, being at the Lord's More.
It is a small place and lesser accommodation facility. 
The interiors are really impressive. 
The service is appreciable.
We ordered 1.Chicken Sausage Burger - The burger was really very tasty and worth the price.
2.BBQ Chicken Sandwich - I felt it could be better with a bit more mayo/cheese, but otherwise very tasty 
3.Blue Lagoon - Refreshing but they are still working on their drinks. Hope it will be better next time.
The burger and the sandwich was served with enough fries and is enough for an adult 's appetite.
I will appreciate the friendly service again.

Taste- 4/5
Ambience- 4/5¬†
Hole made in the pocket after dine out - Small¬†
Service- 5/5

This cute cafe is located right at Lord's crossing beside a sweet shop. Don't judge fast by the dehati/shabby style of entrance but do climb up to the first floor to find this amazingly space efficient cafe. The place has got a brilliant view and rainy evenings will be unforgettable here. The interior is warm and cozy with lots of vintage styling and the use of wood, pipes and glass. Bring your date here or enjoy with your friends, this place will surely grow on you. The service is very friendly and although they have small menu, the food tastes yummy. Honey Glazed Chicken Wings and sandwiches are a must try. This cafe serves coffee day caffeine products so quality of coffee is similar to that of CCD. The only issue here is the pest control of the place. On my last visit I did have an encounter with a lizard who also joined us for the evening. A strong advice to the owner is to take good measures keeping pests and insects out of the place. If only they manage to light up and decorate the entrance to this place this cafe will be really amazing.

At Lords(Not of London...it's of our very own Kolkata).
A week ago I went there & now I feel lucky that I went there..otherwise a great experience would be missed by me.Nothing to say about foods & services.The cold coffee in bulb like pot is still tempting me to go there again and enjoy it.The staffs are very gentle and polite.
I must admit about decoration that it's fabulous.You guys managed such decoration in not a very big area..a great thing to learn how to manage and decorate even a tiny place.
It was an incredible day for me.
Once again...I will go there for sure.üòä

But what is appreciable was the food... it was very tasty and fresh, moreover the place was very hygenic.  But the place has a shortage of staffs... Only one guy was in charge of the whole place... He was the one who was taking orders ,  serving,  cleaning and billing and doing all the other jobs apart from cooking...so at times he often got puzzled... But  inspite of all he was very welcoming and well behaved and was really efficient. His work is really appreciable...
We have ordered a cold coffee,  onoin mushroom sandwiche, oreo shake,  blue lagoon and achicken pizza fry. All the iteams were prepared with utmost care and perfection. I really liked the place and would love to recommend it to others.

It's a very small place located just at the Lord's more. The seating area is cozy and comfortable with a good view of the adjacent roads. Kinda liked that. The hospitality was good. Now coming to the food. It was average. Honestly speaking there are so many cafes in the surrounding areas.. We all are looking for something totally unique. We ordered chicken pizza fries which I did not like. It was simply soggy fries. Not at all crispy with shredded chicken and pizza sauce and cheese. Then we had chicken crockpot sandwich which was okay.. Same thing cheese chicken and carrot.. We had good coffee then. I loved the way they served the coffee but it was the usual. Nothing to add there. I personally think that they should have some innovative ideas for food.

We ordered cheesy mushroom and onion sandwich, chicken sausage sandwich, Chinese mushroom sandwich, BBQ chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets and masala soda. The sandwiches were heavenly. Only the BBQ chicken sandwich tasted below average. Pretty happy with this cafe.

Not so great experience with the food and management. Some days ago i visited this place out of curiosity, since we had already had our lunch we just ordered a drink called minty lime soda recommended by the server. The drink was refreshing and nice. I loved the decor of the place and the staff who was bit pushy but well behaved. We had a good time so I decided to visit this place the very next day to try out some food. This visit was a complete turn off, We ordered chicken sliders and chicken pizza fries, for the drinks i ordered minty lime soda and my friend opted for mango lassi. Well, they nearly took 25mins to serve my drink and only mine. I thought my friend's drink wuld be served in a minute or so but it took forever. After waiting for  like 20 mints i told the staff that it would have been better if he had served the drinks together. He apologized and looked lost. So came our food with my friend's drink. Chicken slider was ordinary nothing special. Chicken pizza fries was simply burnt alu bhaja mixed with chicken pieces, onion,capcicum and processed cheese. Mango lassi and minty soda was fine. Prices are resonable as they don't charge vat.  One recommendation, a little smile and a friendly gesture with the customers don't hurt.

This small cafe situated at lords more is a very pocket friendly cafe!! 
Me and my friends had ordered two mango lassi, regular lassi, chicken slider(their suggested dish) and barbeque chicken sandwich!! 
The mango lassi is something u should go for.. Its just yum!!! The mini burgers were quite tasty. Their barbeque chckn sandwich is heaven. 
Their service is really good. If u have low budget and yet wanna get some amazing food,then brewich is the perfect one. It also has an advantage regardng its location.

The brewich caf√© is a nice small cafe located at the lord's more just opposite to kalpana mistanna bhandar. It is very easy to locate once you get down at the lord's more. 
This caf√© has a nice positive vibe about it. 
About 20 people can be accommodated here. 
The behaviour of the staff was good and helpful. 
We ordered BBQ chicken sandwich which came with fries and ketchup, Chicken pizza fries and chicken wings (honey glazed). 
The sandwich tasted great and had generous amount of the stuffing. The pizza fries was good but I expected much more from this dish. 
The chicken wings was absolutely yum.
Serving time was good as well. 
Definitely coming back. :)

Discovered this new cafe a few days back. the locations is very convenient and easy to find. Located in lords more opposite kalpana mistanna bhandhar.

The place is small with very limited siting arrangements but well maintained and comfortable.
Just for your information don't visit this place with a huge group you might not be able to seat together.

The service is pretty decent and quick and the waiter was very well behaved which we liked.

We ordered for...
Chicken pizza fries - fries tossed with chicken and cheese and it was amazing

Chicken sliders - 3 mini burgers servers with fries, the patty was juicy. 


Honey glazed chicken wings

Lassi & espresso
I was disappointed when they served black coffee instead of espresso, But it's was promptly understood and changed immediately.

Well, do visit this small cafeteria and spend some amazing time with your friends.

Cheers!

Its a nice comfortable little place,with an easy location. It's right opposite Lorde's more,and there's no hassle finding this spot.
The place is small but well maintained. Its on the 1st floor.Two couches and two three tables arranged together as the seating,with a view overlooking the roads. A warm spot to stop for some munches with your loved ones.

The cafe specialises in finger food,quickly mades,and American stuff. Mostly comprising of burgers and sandwiches in their menu,it's not a wide long choice list to choose from. However the food is simple and tasty.

We ordered the crowd favourites, including, Chicken Sliders( 3 small burgers in a plate), Chicken Pizza fries(French fries topped with chicken and melted cheese), Honey Glazed Chicken wings(Nice and well dressed,itwas pretty good) Lassi, and Espresso. 
Service took about 10 mins from the time of order.
And not to forget to mention, a place's comfort comes from the staff, and the person serving us was extremely sweet and well behaved. They had served us Black Coffee instead of Espresso for a friend, and it was promptly understood and changed. 
These are mostly all about the good bits.

The only problem to me that you might face is if you go with a group bigger than 7-8 people, it might be troublesome to sit together, cause this place hardly accommodates about 15.

Enjoy!

The sandwiches - roast and chicken salad, and crockpot chicken cheese steak - were prepared well but both the french fries that came with the sandwiches and the crispy honey chilly fries (ordered separately) were disappointing. ¬†The honey chilli fires in particular were sodden for being doused with sauce, which wasn't very tasty either.

In the eve of 'pohela boisakh' we went to this place..it's not preplanned..after searching on zomato, we got to know about this cafe, we had little bit hesitation on our mind bt aftr reaching at this place all hesitation gone..its a nice small cafe, not so big bt not clumsy & the service made us really very happy.. Their food quality was good, actually beyond our expectations & we satisfied with the quantity.. We ordered chicken slider nd chicken wings(honey)..the burgers were well grilled nd tasty ..the wings were spicy nd the taste of honey was appropriate.. If the tongue is hpy ,it makes u happy.. Thanks The Brewich Cafe for making our evening special..

The place is very easily located on Lords more. A very small cafe but beautifully decorated with lamps, mason jars and fairy lights. The staff were very courteous and well behaved. Odered cold coffee which was served in a bulb like container which was quite innovative. Then had chicken sliders and chicken pizza fries. The buggers were succulent and the fries quite crisp. At last had latte which had a special panda design made on top for us which stood out among all the dishes we had. The pocket pinch being very reasonable too. A very good experience and would love to visit again. Kudos to the team.

This place sure falls in the category of "value for money". Though the place is pretty small but the ambience and interior designing makes up for that. Prompt and good service. Prices are inclusive of taxes. Food was well above average if not outstanding. Overall satisfied.

If you're a Casey Neistat follower , you'd probably relate to the interiors of this place. This place is not amongst the largest cafes out there , it is small but it's quite beautiful and cozy. It also has a separate section for large groups.
The food here is lipsmacking and affordable, except their Chicken Fries which I felt was overhyped. One thing that is saddening is that there is no desserts section here but I guess that can always be added later on.
1.Beverages - I love pretty much everything from this section, especially the Hot Chocolate, it's rich and tastes amazing.
2. Sandwiches - Definitely try out the White Sauce Cheesy Pasta Sandwich from their updated menu, it's a wonder ! Grilled Cheese Dog gets an honourable mention too, it's delicious.
3. Burgers - Burgers get an overhaul in their menu upgrade, the best being the Hangover Burger, I loved it and I'd definitely recommend it to others. The buns are soft and the stuffings are huge, good in quanitity as well as quality, these taste amazing ! I had their Chicken Sliders too, they were good, came as three small burgers so quite fulfilling as well.
4. BBQ Chicken Fries - These tasted okay, nothing extraordinary, though you can definitely give these a shot.
Must tries - Hangover Burger, White Sauce Cheesy Pasta Sandwich, Crockpot Chicken Cheese Steak Sandwich, Hot Chocolate

An easy to locate, cozy caf√© in the busy Lords area of the city.
The place is really small but that was OK with us as it wasn't crowded when we visited.
I went here with 2 of my friends, and we weren't very hungry.
I ordered a ginger tea, one of my friends ordered a lemon ice tea and another one of my friends ordered a Rooh-afza lassi.
We also ordered a plate of pizza fries to be split.
The tea was quite good and value for money at Rs.50/-
The lemon ice tea was refreshing. The price was quite steep at Rs.100/- though.
The Rooh-Afza lassi was worth Rs.70/- and was served in a light-bulb shaped glass. No idea how it tasted as I do not like the flavour of Rooh-Afza.
Coming to the star of the show- the pizza fries.
A plate loaded with crunchy fries, topped with a heap of good quality mozzarella and accompanied with onion, capsicum, sweet corn, marinara sauce etc. It was a riot on our palate.
The only draw-backs would be the slow service and the fact that the tea-bag and sugar sachets had the logo of CCD on it - very shady indeed.
But, all in all a good experience.

P.S. It's tax-free

We ordered chicken pizza fries, chicken slider burgers, cappuccino,hot chocolate and cold coffee. Everything was very tasty except for the hot chocolate which was okayish. They deliver a good quality as well as good quantity of food. Thus, would be back soon to Brewich asap!!

First of all to begin with having disappointed with the falling quality of service and foods in Micasa we were out for the hunt of a new caf√© when some friend suggested a new caf√© at lords. With nothing to lose we decided to hang out there.. let's jst say the food and the service of the people there were much better than anyone expected which made it a must go for me and my gang üíü
Definitely worth a try üíó because when it comes to keeping it short and simple..They jst manage to get it right.

This a small cafe located at Lords moore.
The interior is less spacious but neatly maintained with view of the road.
There is also a private sitting place.
We went here mainly to try their chicken pizza fry and Burgers.
The Chicken Slider consisted of three burgers served with french fries and dips.
The burgers were fresh and tasty.
Chicken pizza fry is their signature dish.It has alternate layers of french fries and chicken topped with grated cheese.
Since not much a fan of french fries,I did not like it much.
The best was the Chicken omelette.It is totally lipsmacking.
Also the roohafza lassi that came in a bulb is love.
The staff is friendly and explained the dishes well.
Prices are inclusive of taxes.

Brewich cafe located nearby lords more top of canara  bank ATM. 

They have closed cabin type seating arrangement for groups and normal seating arrangement.

Ordered Cappuccino and Plain lassi with Chicken pizza fries and chicken nuggets. Tasted mediocre. Service is average but its surely one of the pocket friendly restaurant.

This was my first visit. It was a Sunday evening and I had dropped just to enjoy a cup of coffee. This is located on the Lake Gardens junction. First of all the interiors are impressive. We ordered cappachino, fresh sweet like soda, BBQ chicken sandwich and roasted chicken sandwich. Both Food and service is awesome. Thanks for making our day.

This is the place for all "junkies" (junk food lovers) to be at. The reason(s)??? 1. Fabulous taste; 2. The warmth and hospitality; 3. Pocket friendly pricing & 4. Innovative menu.
We ordered Chicken Fingers and Chicken Pizza Fries for starters followed by Chicken Salami and Cheese Sandwich for my younger son, Chicken Sliders for my elder one, Crock Pot Chicken Cheese Steak Sandwich for my better half and a Club House Sandwich for myself.

The Crock Pot Sandwich and the Club House Sandwich are impossible for light eaters to finish all by themselves after having starters. The Chicken Sliders comes with 3 small burger buns each stuffed with generous quantity of chicken and mayonnaise on a bed of lettuce. The burger buns were as soft as they could get and the filling was simply delicious. Same goes for the hot dog bun for crock pot sandwich and the breads for the salami & cheese sandwich and club house sandwich. To top it all, we ordered for a Cold Coffee, 1 Cafe Latte and 1 soft drink.
This dinner cost us arnd a thousand bucks, and left us happy and satiated. A very good experience.

I ordered food from this caf√© at my workplace.My order comprised of the chicken slider.3 chicken mini burgers came along with fries.I loved the fact that the fries weren't regular McCain ones.Instead they used nicely seasoned potato wedges which I loved gorging on in between having the burgers.Burgers were good as well.The patty was full of flavour and cheesy.Love the freshness on addition of lettuce.Will definitely try out more from their menu.

A little cafe at the Lords moore near Prince Anwar Shah Road. This cafe can accomodate maximum of 12 people at a time. This cafe has a private seating place too! 

Decorations are nice. You can get a nice view of the road at the window seats.They play good music too! üòä

Coming to food, the menu consists mostly of sandwitches and burgers and beverages.Not a very elaborate menu though. 
I had ordered Chicken nuggets and Chicken Pizza Fries. 

Chicken nuggets: This dish had 8 small pieces served with a dip. This was quite ordinary in taste.

Chicken Pizza Fries: This was delicious! Shredded pieces of chicken,cheese and french fries tossed with chopped capsicum. I loved it! ‚ù§

Both the dishes had a very distinct flavour of chat masala which was abundantly used. I liked that! üòä

Prices are affordableüòä

The place is located in Lake gardens on the main road, there is no parking for this place so you have to park your vehicle on the lane back of lords cheeni kum. Coming to the food,the food is good and value for money.the interior decor is really nice though it is a small cafe ,there is a small private zone for pulling of any celebration party..

Yet another favourite of mine when it comes to hanging out over a cup of cappuccino and light snacks. Brewich Cafe is located near Lord's more, at a stone throw distance from South City mall . It has a narrow stairway to the restaurant.  The interior impressed me a lot. They have a small yet comfortable seating area. They have a cabin like seating area too perfect for a small group of 5-7 people to fit in and have fun time. The staff is well behaved. Service was quick. They played all cool pop songs. We ordered a cappuccino and a cup of hot chocolate.  Also, a barbeque chicken sandwich and  barbeque cottage cheese sandwich. The sandwiches were scrumptious. They were served along with french fries,ketchup and mayonnaise. They aren't overpriced like other cafeterias. The conduct of the staff is praiseworthy. Keep it up people. Gonna revisit this place soon.

I have passed by this cafe many a times but didn't visit it until today me and my friend decided to give it a try. The brewich cafe located at Lords more is very easy to find. They have limited seating arrangements but they do have a private seating area with amazing lights and music. Service was good and the food was delectable with very reasonable price. We ordered Crock pot chicken cheese steak sandwich and Chicken pizza fries. The sandwich had a big hotdog bun stuffed with chicken, onion, veggies and lots of cheese served with potato smiley fries. The chicken pizza fries unlike the name, it wasn't a pizza but served in pizza style so the name(I guess). It was french fries served with chicken, veggies, mayo and cheese which was absolutely scrumptious. All in all, this place although small but has surely satisfied me and I am obviously going back there to try the other dishes. The only suggestion I would like to give them is- they can increase their variety in the menu especially the drinks. 
Highly recommended.

The Brewich Cafe - A small cosy cafe!
=====
Intro & Location:¬†

The Brewich Cafe is located in Lords More. It is located near the Hari Gouri Mistanna Bhandar. Earlier, there was a Chinese Restaurant at this place which had closed. I had thought to try it but it closed down very fast. Nevertheless, i was invited here by a friend of mine. The cafe is cosy and they have beautifully done up the interiors. However, when we come to the food, which is very important to me, it failed to satiate my taste buds.¬†
=====
What we tried:¬†

‚óã Roast Chicken Fries - It tasted ordinary to me. Marinated Chicken, Cheese and Fries. The Chicken pieces were stiff. The fries had been turning a bit soggy. It could have been much much better.¬†

‚óã Crack Pot Chicken Steak Sandwich - This was nicely presented but taste wise, i did not like it much. It was just okay. They could improvise the taste a lot more by adding a lot of stuffs into it. ¬†The fried items served along with it seemed like Mc Cain packets. I usually don't like to try mc cain things when i am coming at a Cafe. I had high expectations from this cafe.¬†
=====
Pros:

‚óã Cosy Ambiance.
‚óã Reasonably Priced.
‚óã Good Music.
‚óã Staffs are good. They take the feedback from their customers. :)¬†

Cons:
‚óã Very small seating area.¬†
‚óã Food Taste needs to be improvised.¬†

Ambiance 3.4/5

Conclusion:¬†
I might not visit here again because of the mundane experience i had here. Overall, it's a good cafe which really really needs to work on the food.¬†

Good location.Although the space is a little small and cannot accomodate a lot of people together but their brightly coloured interiors with seats giving a view of the busy street outside was pleasent.. There was also a happy vibe to the place..Food was delicious no doubt and filling as well.We had tasted their special crocpot chicken..which was enough for two people.  A huge super tasty sandwich. The best item of all that we tasted. The presentation is interesting to say the least. Quite tasty.

Hats off, for the ambience. And service is absolutely fantastic. Very homely atmosphere. And the sandwiches are great.
Great place overall, to spend some lazy and lovely time with your loved ones.
                    

On visiting the 2nd time, we ordered sausage sandwich, honey gazed chicken wings and mango shake.. honestly, taste should be better to keep up with the competition, as cafes are growing thick and fast.. New rating is 3.5, instead of 4.

Located at Lord's more. Problem with parking. The place is nice and cosy with well behaved staffs. Food was average could have been better. We ordered BBQ Chicken Sandwich And Chicken Fingers they were average. The interior was colourful. Pocket friendly with no hidden taxes and good service needs to work a bit on the dishes otherwise good.

Good ambience, even better food, price tag is also reasonable. The cafe is new, probably that's why it doesn't have too much room, that's the only disadvantage. Ooh and they dont accept cards, paytm only.

I found The Brewich Cafe while I was scrolling through Zomato. It seems they are newly opened. Anyways, I ordered Chicken Pizza Fries, Chicken Slider and Egg Mayo Sandwich. My mobile was on silent, and the delivery guy called me many times, he waited more than 20 minutes for me to respond. When I called back, he was extremely polite. Hats Off The Brewich Cafe on having such great staffs. Now the food. Firstly, the packaging is the best Ai have seen in recent times. Food was hot. The chicken pizza fries was the showstopper, crisply crunchy layer of fries, with a cheesy chicken layer on top - the flavours were complementing one another. The chicken sliders were amazing as well, loved the chicken patty. The sandwich was hot and properly grilled with good amount of filling. But, one suggestion, try to use less salt, it was kind of salty. Apart from this, everything was just perfect. I look forward to ordering more items soon. Great job The Brewich Cafe!! Highly recommended!!

Why The Brewich cafe"?
Well there are many good reasons to visit this place which is located at Lords more just opposite to the 'Kalpana mistanna bhandar'. 
1)Its very easy to locate this one.
2)Secondly it has a warm n cozy seating arrangement for the guests. Though a small joint, there's a cabin inside the cafe which is perfect for a small gathering. It's beautifully decorated with bright mason jars, candles and lightworks.
3)Food was delicious no doubt and filling as well.
We had tasted their special crocpot chicken..which was enough for two people. Creamy cheesy portion it was!
Cafe latte was good too.
Cold coffee was served in style, in a bulb like container.
Loved it thoroughly!
4)The staff was extremely polite and cordial. 
Thumbs up for the prompt service üëç
5)Most importantly this place will definitely please the photographers :)
I had a lovely time there with

Yet another kool cafe @ Lords More welcoming you with mouthwatering food while fulfilling your cravings to the fullest. The ambiance is quite cozy and I must mention ¬†the room which dignifies its presence showcasing some sort of LED lighting which is really crazy!! Now, the food list was simple until I ordered chicken crock pot sandwich, chicken sliders, roasted chicken with fries and strawberry lassi. We literally had our tummy full-thanks to the yummys. Last thing came as a surprize - 10% discount on the total bill....yuhoo!

The place is very easy to find,located just opposite to kalpana misthana bhandar.A small cafe decorated amazingly.The food was too delicious.Crock pot chicken cheese sandwich is a must try .The chicken slider is also  mouth watering consisting of 3 burgers and potato wedges.We also ordered bbq chicken fries..it was good in taste but more than half of the bowl was filled  with french fries.We had hot chocolate coffee,which was ok(not good,but wouldn't say bad)and mixed nuts lassi which was fantastic.Overall I would say a place to go again and again.The cost is also not very high.And moreover what I liked the owner himself making the dishes.

Discovered this new cafe today!
The location is very convenient. This cozy cafe is located on the main road in Lord's Bakery opposite to kalpana mistanna bhandar.
Located on the 2nd floor of a house, this cafe was beautifully decorated, small, cozy and an absolute amazing place for an evening cup of coffee. Although the space is a little small and cannot accomodate a lot of people together but their brightly coloured interiors with seats giving a view of the busy street outside was pleasent.. There was also a happy vibe to the place..
Now, coming to the food. We ordered
2 cups of cappuccinos and
Their special crock pot chicken cheese steak sandwich ( quite a mouthful word).
The cappuccino was good, nicely made and was served in a big mug.. well, the sandwich deserves special mention. Although, the staffs were taking a little long in serving it, it was all worth the wait. It was very cutely presented with smiley fries. Mayo and ketchup was served with the sandwich and it looked quite presentable.. The sandwich was extremely tasty, loaded with chicken , cheese, lettuce and other toppings, this sandwich won my heart.
Another thing to mention. The staffs are really good and friendly and as an inaugural offer, we also got a 10% off on the total amount so it was affordable.. Still, the cafe is pocket friendly as compared to the quantity they serve. The quality was really good and fresh..
Looking forward to this cafe and will surely recommend this cafe! üòÉ

The food was really tasty and ¬†they came up to ask asking about it, which is really nice of them. My review is a little less, because there is always a chance for betterment,overall, It was nice, thank you

Situated exactly at Lord's more opposite New Kalpana Mistanna Bhandar, the place is quite visible due to it's bright yellow decor. The stairs leading up are quite small and shabby. However, the decor inside the cafe is quite bright and they have a seating capacity of around 20. Went with

I loved this place for their privare dining idea... If you are looking for a pleasant evening along with some privacy this is the place to be at... I really loved their idea of the mood enhancer lights inside the cabin (pic attached)... The menu was great, great taste without burning a hole in your pocket... The crock pot chicken sandwich is a must try.. Also the service guy was pretty good.
Looking forward for more visits...

Well...I had opted for a take away,, the sandwiches were amazing! If you are looking for a combination of good old fashioned sandwiches with a fancy chef-inspired twist to it,this is certainly your go to place. 

Moreover the food was delivered exactly within the promised time!! With huge sandwiches, fresh bread and a great service this place surely beats big name outlets...Happy munching ü§ó

A very new cafe in my locality. Went there for it's convenient location,and ended up getting a pleasant surprise. It's small and relatively unappealing entrance might not raise your hopes but the inner decor and ambience is excellent and innovative. Add to this, good food and well mannered staff. Highly recommended to every cafe lover, it is quite pocket friendly as well. Loved it.

If you are looking for a pocket friendly cafe with top quality food and great ambience, this is your place to be. The dishes here are classic favourites with an added twist which makes it even more delicious. Some uncommon items on the menu are worth the try. The combination of soft and bright lights adds to the overall visual appeal of the place. Definitely a hidden gem in Prince Anwar Shah Road. Must try items are Strawberry Lassi, Chicken sliders, Crockpot chicken sandwich.

Located centrally at Prince Anwar Shaw Road, Lord's more, this cafe is super pocket friendly. Rare as it is, this cafe serves not only just western English cuisine but also the quality , quantity and taste is unique. Visually appealing, the ambience and music of the cafe is perfect for a hangout with friends, reunions, quality time and long romance. Personal favourite was strawberry shake and the roasted chicken sandwich. A must try if you want to try a new genre of sandwiches, fries and shakes. Each ordering up with  sandwiches , chips and shakes/coffee, the cost  added up to a slight below RS.500 (total) for the 3 of us. Worth visiting this place for all the foodies in town. 


----Do remember to check the glow in the dark light beam bar . Truely a new addition to cafe culture.
