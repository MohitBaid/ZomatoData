This outlet is for one of those days when your mother couldn't cook for the day and yet everyone in the house wants to have "Ghoroaa khabar" namely rice and fish or chicken.
The food quality is very average given the low price.
You may find sandstones in most of their food.
Their chowmein, fried rice is very mediocre.
Chicken Masala is the only dish that is still better.

Lalti, a very popular local fast food joint for the locals. A small and affordable place. Food is good. That is all actually, ambience, interior, service...nothing what one would expect...but still its quite good for the food. I have been eating at this place, mostly as take away since its birth, know the owner and its employees cause of this.. End verdict, food is good.

Good quantity of food given the prices. Quality is quite decent. The best deal would probably the chilli chicken where they serve you 8 handsome pieces

This place is actually very near to my house. We used to have food from here previously. they make average momos and parthas. But with so many of options nearby, we hardly visit this place,

I didn't know I could review this place! Well here goes...I am a local for this restaurant. Now what puts it off is the interior decoration, sitting arrangement. Small place, sloppy service whick keeps you waiting. But. And a big BUT indeed. The food is quite good. If u want a small snack, specially one you can eat outdoors, definitely visit this place. You'll love the flavours, taste of almost all the items starting from starters to the main course. Order a parcel to take home and this could be a very good restaurant for you. Prices range from cheap to reasonable. And you get unexpected good food for such a place.

This is a small fast food joint which serves almost anything and everything for a normal meal or snacks. There is a small seating but I generally prefer taking parcels. When I am in a mood for a quick snack or meal I generally opt for this place. The best dishes according to me are
Dal Tadka
Veg Chowmein
Mughlai Parath
Rolls

They excel in serving foods at a fast and reasonable rate... They could however improve the food in some respects .. Or maybe expand...
