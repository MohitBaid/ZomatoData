Just a minute away from my home.. nd whenever I get the urge to have biriyani.. I go for it.. nd the most important thing is we get it at a very cheap price.. @Rs.70.. may its not a big restaurant.. but.. its worth eating.. when u crave for biriyani nd ur pocket is almost empty.. u can surely try it here..

When you are hungry and you love Biryani the most and also you are careful about the price, this place is for you. Located just a minute walk from Ballygunge station Hena Biryani is really a good deal at Rs.70. Rice quality is fine and the biryani comes in good quantity. Also taste their Chicken Chap, goes really well with the Biryani.
Total value for money.

Another local Biryani shop with cheap but good Biryanis for a low budget.
Had referred this place many a times last yeart, but now its here.
Quality:6.5/10
Quantity: 7/10
This place is not for those who are very cautious about their hygiene since this is a roadside stall.
You might have to wait for your Biryani of you visit after 8:30pm to get from a hot,freshly cooked handi.
The service gets 6/10

Biryani rice is cooked decently and the chicken stays moist and soft. The mutton might be chewy sometimes but that's on luck.

They give a big piece in the chaap for which their packaging is too small sometimes and thus,might leak out into the polythene packt.

Their quantity is not consistent, sometimes they put in a lot of rice with decently sized chicken and potato, sometimes they put in less rice with over sized potato for no reason. 5/10.
