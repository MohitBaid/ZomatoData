It's a small shop near the Kavi Nazrul Metro Station,towards Garia Bazaar. Nothing extraordinary but the prices are on the lower side(definitely a plus point!). I have tried their chicken biriyani,which is at rs.70(without egg) and 80(with egg) and I liked it. Although I am not a very big fan of biriyani yet, the biriyani here impressed me(It had a good piece of chicken!)I have also had egg roll from here, which I didnot like much.
There is not much place to sit and the place is in one word is DIRTY,and it will be best to take parcels.

Review update: Dec,2015
We tried Chilly chicken and chowmein here since we were too hungry and were in a hurry, so we had no other option nearby. The chilly chicken priced at â‚¹100 had 8 chicken pieces, it wasn't tasty, but the chicken was okayinsh to satisfy two hungry people. The chowmein was oily and had large chilly pieces (I don't like my food to be very spicy, so they should have asked before adding so much of chilly).
You should definitely not sit and eat here. And if u have to try, try the biriyani; that will do :)

Few days back had the biryani, it was nice for the price they are charging. It is the cheapest biryani that you will get in garia as far my knowledge. The behavior of the staffs are also nice. As a whole nice place to have biryani with out spending much.
