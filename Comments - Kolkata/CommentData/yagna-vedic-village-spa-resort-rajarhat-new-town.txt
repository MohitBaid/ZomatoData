We were a group of 10 people with Kids who went there for their Sunday Brunch. All i can say is their service is very lousy. Spoons are not available. For drinking water you have to request the waiters. The live counter which was preparing chicken and fish was complete mess. You have to wait a huge amount of time to get your starters. The chickens were not cooked properly. Why arrange something near the pool if you all cant manage it? They provide drop to VDen for activities. But for return there was no drop. My baby was crying and still no car came. My friend who had his driver came to my help. He quickly got the car and I was able to reach Yagna where i got my car from the vallet parking guy. For activities (they were included) we were always told that its chargeable. I had to argue with them that its part of our package. I will say avoid this lousy place if you are going for food. For loitering around, doing some games etc or may be staying overnight to relax you can give this place a try. But for food/buffet there are far far better options in the town. Only saving grace was the dessert section. They are good.

I have visited here twice! I likethis resort! Best place to chill out for a day! This resturant has a good service and good food. I had Risotto here.. which was okay. Nothing extraordinary though. The Breakfast buffet spread is quite good. The major drawback is though this place is well maintained but still u guys need to keep a check on the mosquitos😂

If you crave for something fancy this is the evergreen place for a perfect lunch or dinner with friends and family. Spacious, neatly done interiors, no over the board kind of thing, ample sitting. A place where you can sit and have a hearty chat, no loud music. Serene and calm ambiance, you will definitely have a good time.

Coming to food we opted for buffet lunch. They had a vast array of choices. Food is just excellent doesn't matter whether it's veg or non veg. 

Courteous staff, quick service and great management. As it is located in a resort there are always large groups of people visiting but the staff is quite efficient. Good hospitality, would definitely recommend this one.

Few days back I stayed at Vedic Village. Vedic village is a bit outskirts of Kolkata but Cater with excellant hospitality.

Gem of Vedic Village is Yagna restaurant.It is very near to the Reception area.

In Lunch I have Galauti Kabab and Smoked Salmon and Gooey Chocolate Brownie.Galauti Kabab was as usual mouth watering but the real gem was Baked salmon slices well decorated with boiled egg ,cream and capers.

In dinner we have Grilled Chicken served with rice,Spaghetti bolognese with minced mutton , Lasooni Jhinga and baked Cheese cake with Basil.all were soo great.

A month back on a friend's birthday we were staying in Vedic village and decided to try out this place for dinner. 

We ordered the following :

◇ Pizza Margherita
◇ Bombay Sandwich
◇ Pepper Garlic Mushrooms
◇ Tai Pei Chicken
◇ Murgh Malai Tikka
◇ Chicken Hakka Noodles
◇ Sliced Lamb and Mushroom
◇ Diced Chicken in Sauce
◇ Kung Pao Chicken
◇ Non Veg Prawn Fried Rice

We were a group of 8 people, and the quantity was quite sufficient for us all. All the dishes tasted well and I found the pizza to be quite good too. Ambience was nice and despite the place being full to the brim, the service was upto the mark.

Very nice place. Courteous staffs, tasty food & nice for family outing. I especially liked their Sunday brunch during our stay at 'Vedic Village'.Unlike the other restaurant 'Bhoomi', this place is quite spacious & comfortable. We liked their assorted nonveg kebab platter, it was well prepared & sweet corn chicken soup also deserves a special mention. On our last day, my husband fell in love with their 'home style bhetki fish curry' & jeera rice. Their gesture of treating us with free desserts on our final visit was greatly appreciated by my family. Keep up the good work. Totally recommended & will look forward to visit again.

We celebrated my husband's Birthday at Vedic Village and decided to have dinner at Yagna (a la carte). Had a wonderful experience here!

We ordered Vegetable Shanghai Dumpling, cornfed chicken breast and pan seared Kolkata beckti. Everything was superbly made, we really enjoyed the food! Beckti was especially nice and for me, the best of the 3.

Would recommend Vedic Village as a leisure outing to others too. When it comes to choosing your lunch or dinner restaurant, since Yagna is multi cuisine it is definitely the most convenient choice. It is also reasonably priced when compared with the Bengali restaurant Bhoomi. 

Visited on 2 September 2017.

I visited this place with my friends. This is one of the exotic restaurants of Vedic village. Ambience is pretty good. Their food quality is  decent. We ordered 2-3 veg-non veg  starters, mixed fried rice n noddles, garlic chicken, veg pizza. We were 6-7 people and the food that was served was sufficient for us. And it didn't pinch our pocket.
But the sad part is service was too slow.
Hence I'm deducting .5

It's the main resturant in the club house. It has really wonderful ambience and large seating. 

It was way past lunch time, So they didn't have any tandoori options. We had penne pasta in white sauce with mushroom and chicken. It was hot and delicious. 

Had a great meal with fast service. 
my only issue is that they added a service tax after the GST, which they explained was optional, but only after we asked. So they should have mentioned it while handing over the bills. 

Do I RECOMMEND Yes! 
Will visit again Yes! 

Tbh, when you have travelled to get there you gotta try this

This is supposed to be one of the finest restaurants at Vedic but to my disappointment this place turned out to be a disaster on a Sunday afternoon. 8 of us went there and opted for a standard buffet lunch. Live counters such as Mongolian and South Indian were decent to start with. Pani Puri was pathetic and the potato had gone stale. It took them about 45 mins to get us seated. How could they run the place with only 3-4 staff for serving. We had to wait ages to get our starters, drinks, breads etc. Buffet spread was quite small with only few options. All were running cold and some had that bad smell. Only saviour was the dessert. Seating area was not even close to that of a fine dining restaurant. Not worth going.

We had gone for the day out package. It included breakfast, lunch and tea along with access to a pool and activities area. 

The food at yagna was delicious. The buffet lunch comprised of a sumptuous spread with the highlights being the sweet corn soup, homestyle fish curry, butter naan and bhindi do pyaza. The boneless fish curry was the dish of the day. The chicken and paneer items were also good. 

The only let down was the dessert section. We were pretty excited to find baked roshogolla on the menu but the item turned out to be excessively sweet and even though we were a group of sweets lovers, it was too sugary for our pallette.

The ambience, decoration and the whole vibe of the place is commendable.

Vedic Village is a beautiful place to go in winter.It is a total no for summers.The AC at Yagna ia quite poor and everytime they are opening and closing the front door things are getting more messed up.The brunch buffet is supposed to have unlimited starters and food cocktails and beer.They will serve the starter at your table but you will keep waiting for hours when ultimately you will find few bits of peices of veg starters coming your way you have to especially request them to serve non veg starter, but the waiters will give very weird expressions if you ask for sevond serving.The quality of food is also very bad .The indian dishes were ok type.Talk about deserts , it😆 is the worst place to have deserts.I guess their chef is a huge fond of sugar so he doesnt think before  giving sweetners to deserts.It is a strict no for diabatic people.Compared to other renouned spas and resort this doesnot stand anywhere to the standard .

A restaurant experience is defined by the quality of the service & food. My experience today was horrible on both counts. The sweet corn soup which we were promised  in 10 mins, arrived after 40 mins. The naan was served ice cold. Even simple requests for paper napkins were ignored. And at the end of the meal for 5 of us, 3 finger bowls were given !!

Vedic village is one of my favourite destination to spend a day in outskirts of the city , and yagna is their multicuisine restaurant opposing the lotus shaped pool with lush greenery around . I had their buffet breakfast which had satisfactory spread , south indian cuisine - idli dosa vada upma with sambar and chutneys , poori ghugni - our favourite bengali breakfast , english menu - toast, eggs made to order , bacon , sausages , chicken stew , porridge , salami and ham , cut fruits and juices , bakeries including donuts , fruit cake , pineapple pudding and muffins. The food tasted nice overall , but there was not a single dish worth drooling for , and as far as spread is considered it can be improved considering its a starred porperty. The donuts didnot seem fresh , the bread was chewy , tea served in cup with a crack were some of the negetives i got to spot apart from the food tasting part.

We spent a day at the Vedic Village with family friends and as part of our package we were offered to dine at Yagna. Upon our arrival we were offered a simple breakfast which comprised veg sandwiches tea and potato wedges. I liked the wedges. During the lunch we were served their lunch buffet. It started with a very bland chicken soup, inedible.No starters were there. Moving on the main course there were jeera rice and butter nun, both were alright. Dal makhani and three veg curries which were decent. Amritsari macchi was good but the mutton roghanjosh was nothing special. There were Dahi vada and courses of salads too, worth a try. In the desert section there were plain vanilla ice cream, choco moose and kesar rasomalai, none of them worth mentoining. We took sweet lime soda in addition which was refreshing. In the evening we were served pastries, cookies along with coffee. Overall though not any particular dish impressed our test buds but we enjoyed the all day experience.

Yagna is one of the best fine dining restaurants in kolkata.  It is a multi cuisine family restaurant. It is done up very well with minimal but very elegant decor. The waiters are very cordial and friendly. The swimming pool in front of this place is a great way to unwind.The food is very tasty. A little on higher side but the food has a lot of flavour and is prepared with love. We had an amazing lunch buffet and would really love to visit again . :)

This was the main restaurant in Vedic Village which hosted us for the special weekend brunch,again thanks to team ThinkQuisitive.Yagna is a multicuisine restaurant which serves Indian, Oriental & Continental fares.The ideal time to visit this place is on. weekends from 12-3 pm for an exotic weekend brunch,in which they offer an unlimited food buffet.The spread is divided in two sections. The outdoor area has the live counters for various cuisines & the inner air conditioned area has the dessert spread

Vedic Village – The name itself is significant of the fact that this 5 star resort stresses its existence more on being a pioneer and believer in Ayurveda than going all commercial and artificial. A laid down resort, with nature all around; this is a perfect spot to go out on a long drive with your partner or family and enjoy a day or maybe two of absolutely solidarity in a serene and calm atmosphere. This place is located a bit off-track from main Kolkata. Google Maps, our ultimate savior made our work easy, and inspite of facing several glitches across the road, we finally managed to hit the spot. Rajarhat, as such has developed a long way from what it was a couple of years back. Other than may be a few bad patches across the road, the entire road is smooth. However, the frequent side curves is bound to perplex you, but then if you are in a group with more than one phone tracking your route, it becomes relatively easier.
            

We were a group of food enthusiasts and bloggers, representing Panchphoron were cordially invited by Thinquisitive, one of the leading PR Groups in this city and on behalf of the management of Vedic Village to cover the launch of five new items and thereafter enjoy a lavish Sunday brunch. It becomes difficult initially to synchronize everything, especially when you are in a group. We were a team and had to adhere to each other’s needs. Two of our members had already reached the venue who were traveling from opposite direction, being alone, managed to reach earlier and engage themselves into photoshoot and a couple of mocktails. While, they were having a gala time, we made our way into the nature’s lap. It took us 3-4 minutes to reach the reception from the main entrance, such was the vastness of the compound.

Upon our arrival, we were greeted in the traditional way with a Tika on our forehead. A couple of shots, mocktails and cocktails, along with some cucumber with salt and a pinch of red masala; the hospitality and service of this place instantly won all of our hearts. The bartenders were privy of our needs and left no stone unturned to pamper to our requests and give his best to what we desired for. The consistency of these drinks were just perfect, and wasn’t too watery or runny which is usually seen at most of the places. This section had lavish sofas placed all around with glass casing on the edges to have a clear view of the poolside. While we were all tempted to beat the heat, we managed to restrict ourselves only to what we were there for.

Once we were done with our drinks, we were guided to the area where the live brunch was happening. A true act of masterclass, it was an effortless synchronization of numerous chefs working individually as well as together to produce and create food items; the number of which one can only imagine. While on one side there was one chef managing Roti and Phulkas, there were another dishing out Panipuris. And there was another Chef working effortlessly to steam the Momos, while beside him was another guy tossing veggies into two different types of sauces. Clueless, as to where we should start, I finally decided to hit it off with the Momos. Soft and steamy momos,  it had a strange resemblance to Wow Momos. Although the filling was tasty, I was honestly expecting something better from a resort of such caliber and name.

Following were the actual menu for the brunch, however most of us managed to cover only selective items to our liking and choosing.

And flavoured Ice cream (stuffed in lime & on the bed of sea salt) would be served on to the table

FRESH CUT FRUITS CORNER--LIVE

Special stress on seasonal fruits like---bell fruit | Black Plum | Soft seeds of Palm 

1) The Beler Shorbot, otherwise known as localwood apple drink, tasted a bit weird. In such a hot and humid weather, you expect something chilled, and on the contrary, the drink was served at regular room temperature. Perhaps a chilled drink would have helped in forming a different perception altogether.

2) I decided to skip the salad and jump straight to the appetizers. Seafood Bhel, one of those items which were newly introduced to the menu was an instant hit. Obvious from its name, it was a fusion of the typical Bhel we are so familiar with, along with the infusion of seafood meat. Tangy, crispy and with a meaty texture, one cannot ask for anything better to start the meal with!

3) Organic Eggs with Cheese Toast: Crispy toast brushed with cheese served alongside organic and healthy eggs. Had not it been for the calorie count, I would have had eaten dozens of those beauties. Simply melting into the mouth, the eggs were of the finest quality.

4) Penne in Mixed Sauce: Then came the ‘Live Station’. As mentioned above, I had tried Momo in the very beginning. Opted to go for the Mixed Sauce with the penne. A bit overtly tangy for me, perhaps the content of the sauce was too much than required. Wanted to devour more of this, but unfortunately had to remain content with one or two servings.

5) Curry Station with Choice of Vegetables: Different assortment of veggies stir fried and tossed with either red sauce of a yellow sauce. I decided to go for Mushroom with the Red Sauce and Bhindi with the Yellow Sauce. I must say here, that the yellow sauce was the clear winner. Try this with hot and freshly made Phulkas, this was more like having a home cooked meal with the right amount of flavor and spices.

6) Mutton Dackbangla and Yakhni Kofta Pulao=> Stationed Buffet, comprising of 4 items in total, I decided to go for these two. The Dackbangla or popularly known as Duckbunglow draws its route from the British era. Not going into what it actually is, this particularly dish was a very close resemblance to what I know this dish to be. Tampered with the right amount of spices and with an aromatic gravy, the Yakhni Pulao was a perfect supplement to the lipsmacking Dackbangla.

7) Meat and Local Fish/Live Barbecue Grill => The highlight of the day and another of those dishes which were newly introduced. These had different types of meat and fishes being prepared live in front of you live upon a barbecue grill. Lamb chops, corn fed chicken steak, Chapli Kebab, Telapia, Prawns; you need not go to Goa to enjoy a live grill and devour into awesomeness. It was like a dream come true for any foodie, being served with fresh and juicy meats, all coated with a flavorful sauce and grilled to perfection. I was so ecstatic, that I went for a repeat order. This dish was so filling, that I hardly had any place for deserts to try for, but then being the typical Bong I am, I couldn’t have had ended the meal without a sweet touch!

8) Deserts: This place boasts for their expertise in deserts, and rightly so. Serving upto 24 different kinds of deserts, this is truly a paradise for people having sweet tooth. With a fusion touch in almost every one of them, I handpicked to try the Baked Patishapta, Almond Basbousa, Caramel Nutty Tart, Chocolate Mousse and Mango Tart. There was also one Chocolate and Banana Cake, which was served hot. To me, it was the highlight of all the deserts we had on offerings.

We had also opted for a couple of mocktails and cocktails, which comes absolutely free with the brunch. I personally asked for a Watermelon Mojito, to digest the food and infuse some energy into myself. Well, to have such a large buffet and lavish brunch is no easy job. Our day went on with live photoshoot and was then followed with a tour to some of the other parts in this resort. Well, that’s a different story altogether, but if I have to simply highlight the best moment of the day, it will undoubtedly be the brunch. Getting treated like a king, being taken care of all our needs by the captains, being served with freshly prepared veggies, witnessing the live grill; one can easily feel the joy and enthusiasm I had in me. So, if you want to enjoy a laidback day, pamper yourself and your loved ones, do not think twice and make your way to Vedic Village on Sunday to enjoy this lavish spread. And if you need another excuse, well there’s always their Ayurvedic Spa and Wellness Center. What more reasons do you need to embrace Nature and Organic food?

An initiative of Thinquisitive . A special day with the bloggers amidst the lush green nature. Driving out of the city for a weekend meal seems like a real luxury. The sprawling, idyllic Vedic Village Spa Resort, right in the outskirts of Rajarhat invites us for their Spring-Summer "Great Family Sunday Brunch" we can hardly resist.

Location : Vedic Village Spa Resort at Shikharpur, at just 15 minutes drive from Rajarhat.

Decor and Ambience : Picturesque setting, unique architecture and sheer magnificent arrangement. The Sunday Brunch is brimming over from the multicuisine all hour restaurant Yagna. The main dining space is bright and airy, with effective cooling, split level seating and island food displays. The lavish spread around made us even more excited. live baul music enlivensed the weekend ambience as the performers strum folksy tunes.

Staffs : The staffs are excellent with their prime motto to serve you. Right from the kickstart, they were there to guide us. Amicable , epitome of hospitality would just define the situation.

Food : Food Brunch here is fancy social institution with a devoted selection of menu, often exotic and experimental. Here, almost everything is live and on display. It is the largest culinary spread in the city offers Western classics, Asian favourites and nouveau India adventures.

Started off with the poached tomato soup, Potato and leek Vichyssoise, tofu, roasted shitake mushroom peanut sauce salad, compressed Granny Smith Skewers, melon Limonchilo Carpaccio, assorted Dim Sum baskets, Free range Eggs to order, Pulled Pork and Tandoori Duck Sliders, seasonal crispy fritters, Pan seared bhekti in quinoa and tamarind sauce, wokked green beans, Kasoori Chicken Tikka-Chilli Cheese Fondue mint dust, barbecued spare ribs with ginger, hoisin and five spice, caramlised lamb chops, Seafood claypots, Sarson tandoori Fish & Green Chilli Hollandaise, Keralian Tilapia, Creole Squid & Prawn, Live Ravioli Station and much more.
For desserts there was an delectable array Liquid Tiramisu, Mishti Doi Mousse, Parley G Biscuit Saffron Cheese Cake, Live fruit Jalebi and assorted flavours of Kulfi sticks.
I think I would tag this as possibly the best brunch that I ever had.

Value for money : All at a tag of Rs. 1250 per person is a wonderful offering at relatively cheap prices.

A day worth spending, a food worth relishing, a Sunday well- spent.
Thank you Thinquistive.
Cheers and happy chomping!

This was the second stop on our itinerary for the Vedic Village Bloggers' meet organised by the team of Thinquisitive. Difficulty in reaching the venue i.e. The Vedic Village aside, which can be found in my earlier post about the place, this is the restaurant which hosted our sunday brunch. A multi cuisine restaurant which serves Indian, Oriental & Continental fare throughout the fare, the best time to visit this is around 12-3 in a Sunday to attend their Sunday Brunch which is a gastronomic carnival to say the least.
The spread is divided in two sections. The covered outdoor area with the live counters for various cuisines & the inner air conditioned area which has the dessert spread & the seating arrangements. Outside you will find varieties of live cooking counters, one which prepares made to order pasta, one which prepares mixed grill, a continental breakfast counter , momo counter or even a counter serving panipuri, should you want to try it out. There's also the buffet spread of mutton, fish & chicken items. You are literally spoilt for choice as you hop from one to another quite not being able to decide which items to try, & which to skip. For a foodie, it almost feels like a child in a toy shop, not being able to make up his mind which one to try, & which one to miss. Even the dessert spread consists of more than 24 items, though bite sized, the eat all you can attains a whole new meaning as you dig into the delicacies! Whatsoever I was quite full, if not intoxicated from all the amazing cocktails I tried from 'Agnee' the lounge bar, & decided to keep to very minimal amount of food. The items I tried are as follows:

Protein Chaat & Seafood Bhel:
Tangy & crispy mix of typical chaat. The burst in your mouth flavours were a good starting point for the brunch. The seafood bhel was quite uniquely prepared, served in small kulhad were mix of seafood & meat . both the items had crispness in them along with the tangy flavours. Quite liked them

Egg Benedict & Garlic toast:
The continental counter is there to serve the eggs as you like it, poached, sunny side up, scrambled or plain omelette if you like it that way. I opted for Egg Benedict, which was two halves of English Muffins, hiding a poached egg inside & lightly fried. It was like heaven bursting inside your mouth as I bit into it. Must try!
The Garlic toasts were pretty good too.

Penne in Alfredo sauce:
Next up was pasta in white sauce, my all time favourite. I don't quite like my pasta spicy so generally avoid the red sauce, however the option is available if you want to try that too. The pasta was well cooked with considerable amount of veggies & tasted great!

Chicken Dumpling & Stir fried veggies:
Yes, the combination seems weird, even by my standards, but that was the only option to cut short the time of getting the items from the counters to the table :P. The dumplings were decent, may be a bit bland. The stir fried vegetables were absolutely delicious. You could also opt for paneer / mushroom as per your choice.

Pani poor:
I was sure not in the mood to try panipuri during brunchtime. But when you have girls in the group, someone is sure going to try it & tag you along! The panipuri was a bit let down. A more tangier sour chutney is what I prefer.

Live Barbeque Grill:
Mutton Chops/Corn Fed Chicken Steak/ Tilapia/ Sweet Water Prawns
Now this was one station worth waiting for. Surely they would take about ten minutes to serve you after you have made your choice (which was pretty hard to make, trust me, I ended up ordering each & every item available). The mutton here meant lamb which was perfectly marinated & optimally grilled.the chicken pieces however could do with a bit more spices. The fish was fresh as we're the prawns. All the items were a delight to have along with a pint of beer. This is surely going to be the paisa wasool part of the meal, if I am going there for a second time.

Stationed Buffet/Main Course:
Mutton Dakbangla/Kosha Murgi/Marich Bata Bhakti/ Yakhni Kofta Pulao
After having a lot of prawns , chicken steak & lamb chops, it was practically impossible to even think about having the main course. But the aroma of the Mutton Dakbangla & Kosha Murgi was too tempting to give them a miss. The Mutton in this case was goat meat which was pretty well cooked & the gravy decent. The Kosha Murgi too was amply spicy & tasted great with the Pulao.

Desserts:
Now this was going to be hard. The whole spread was tempting. One with a sweet tooth simply doesn't miss any items , specially when they have more than twenty four items to try out from! I was so excited , instead of a quarter plate I opted for a dinner plate, yet only few counters down I had no more room on it, so a second plate helped! Nearly tried all the items, most if not all were good, it would be futile even to try describing taste of each. Honestly I don't remember, forget taste, I don't even remember name of half the items I tried! The ones which deserve special mention are:
Baked Patisapta, Fresh Mango-cream tart, Chocolate mousse in kulhad garnished with mint sprig, Baked mango yogurt, Caramel nutty tart, Mango sandesh, Chocolate Truffle among others.

With that the amazing Brunch came to an end. It was an absolute pleasure attending it. Tasted so much yet so much was left out. Surely will be visiting again. The unlimited buffet without alcohol costs about 1500/- per adult. However you can get the same deal for under 1000/- bucks if you buy it via Nearbuy by Groupon. The buffet for kids cost about 750/-, which again gets discounted if bought via Groupon. Overall the price may seem a bit on the higher side, but the variety in the menu, the enormous no. Of items available & the whole setting is value for money deal for sure. The food is undoubtedly tasty, partly because the recipes are prepared by chefs who are experts & partly because most of the ingredients are farmed locally. Some items are even grown in house with help of organic farming. So no inorganic harmful pesticides & preservatives in your food.
I enjoyed the day thanks to wonderful hospitality by The Vedic Village management, special thanks to Thinquisitive for this grand meetup initiative. Surely I'll be returning to Vedic Village for a weekend outing away from the city.
Till then,
Happy Eating.
Cheers!

When I received the invitation for a food blogger’s meet I was not sure whether to attend it or not and that was mostly because I was not familiar with the group! However, I have given the entire thing a second thought and ended on being there at The Vedic Village Spa Resort last Sunday! Basically the resort played the role of catalyst to me to attend the meet. I was planning for quite a sometimes to explore the place!

Vedic village in toto is very beautiful and is the perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. I will review two meals. After utilizing the activities offered and swimming pool to the fullest , we were very hungry. we headed towards their multi cuisine restaurant "Yagna". We ordered sweet corn soup for starters . The consistency was just right , the corn was sweet and fresh. Next we ordered pan fried noodles. fried noodles in gravy which was very lightly spiced, topped with assorted vegetables. It looked so colorful and delicious. it lived upto its appearance.next we thought lets order something Indian. we ordered Subz biryani since my fellow foodie is a veggie. Trust me I am very picky about my Biryani and also a hardcore non vegetarian and I didnt regret ordering it at all ! It was YUUUMMM! i never knew vegetarian version of biryani can be this delicious. My friend has been craving biryani everyday since then, Moving on to the breakfast. It was delight to my eyes and tummy of course. the options were too many and time too less. I am sure I will miss out something.  There were fresh fruits, Chicken and pork salami, fresh fruit juice, hot milk, cold milk. fat free milk to go with wheat flakes or corn flakes, sprouts and spices to go with it. then there were options for Indian and American breakfast.  

Chole bhature, vermacilli upma, idli,medu vada served with three different chutneys. The live counter offered dosa, uttapam and eggs.  Then we had baked beans, vegetable hotpot and grilled chicken with mushrooms. You can also choose to white or brown bread and get it toasted.  Tea and coffee is served if asked. to finish it off , they had donuts, fruit cake, muffin, chocolate pudding and rosogolla.

I was treated in this restaurant by my manager a few months back. The interiors were very well decorated, and this restaurant was right next to the swimming pool, which added to my nsp(if you know what I mean). We had Chinese cuisines. Nothing to mention in particular, all the dishes were good. Though I am not sure whether I would visit this place again, considering the hazards of reaching Vedic village.

Is it fair to judge a multi-cuisine restaurant by the buffet breakfast it serves? When the breakfast is its primary business, I would think so.

Yagna at Vedic Village serves quite the mighty breakfast - South indian (a surprisingly good vada, a listless dosa), English (standard cereal, super fluffy scrambled eggs and hit and miss flavored yogurts), American (baked beans out of a can and average assorted muffins) and Bengali (pretty good luchi and cholar dal). 

Service is slow, milkshakes very weak and other food mostly average.

Great tasting food and good variety. Ambience is also good. Service could be better in terms of the servers being more attentive to the needs as much as they are proactive in clearing the plates as one barely finishes eating. The menu also needs to be revamped well otherwise consecutive meals might seem to be leftovers from previous meal

Went there for a office party. Happy for their themed decoration and well reception. Food was more or less okay. Impressive thing is they served well north Indian food which was less spicy. 
But its tough to visit them again and again 
1. Their inconvenient location.
2. Their cost.

But once any one can go for a drive with family to have lunch or dinner in a different atmosphere.

As a part of our 6th Anniversary, this was the place we craved for and looking upon to grab everything we could as this was the place is known for the "buffet breakfast".....Literally they know how to impress their customers, and how to be competent in this ever changing over- competitive market.
Brilliant arrangement for breakfast, starting from luchi chholar daal to fish n basil sauce; bengali khoi-moori to chocolate mousse, different types of milk (I saw this concept first time) - low fat, light milk, hot milk, cold milk and many others can't even recall now. This was followed by chicken and pork salami, different types of corn flakes, fresh fruits, porridge, rajma, assorted cakes, live counter of dosa and omlete, idly, vada, 3 types of sambar any many other things. For great foodies, if u try to taste all the items in a very negligible amount, I bet u have to skip ur lunch for sure.

Yagna is basically a multicusine restaurant inside vedic village. The staffs here are essentially very nice and it's a pleasure of the visitors while talking to them, a common factor among all the waitors is that they are surprisingly very informative about all their menu. We stayed their for a 1N package so in the dinner we had ordered for mutton dum biriyani, and in snacks we had dry chilli chicken - both the items were so mouth watering. Cost is again, like Agnee, is on mych higher side - the biriyani will cost you around 700 including tax.

Food is alright. Not all that great. We ordered veg mix and were served something else altogether. Value for money not so good. Service was good though. Ambience is quite good. I ordered chicken spaghetti and it was okay though not extraordinary.

Went there for a office party. Happy for their themed decoration and well reception. Food was more or less okay. Impressive thing is they served well north Indian food which was less spicy. 
But its tough to visit them again and again 
1. Their inconvenient location.
2. Their cost.

But once any one can go for a drive with family to have lunch or dinner in a different atmosphere.

As a part of our 6th Anniversary, this was the place we craved for and looking upon to grab everything we could as this was the place is known for the "buffet breakfast".....Literally they know how to impress their customers, and how to be competent in this ever changing over- competitive market.
Brilliant arrangement for breakfast, starting from luchi chholar daal to fish n basil sauce; bengali khoi-moori to chocolate mousse, different types of milk (I saw this concept first time) - low fat, light milk, hot milk, cold milk and many others can't even recall now. This was followed by chicken and pork salami, different types of corn flakes, fresh fruits, porridge, rajma, assorted cakes, live counter of dosa and omlete, idly, vada, 3 types of sambar any many other things. For great foodies, if u try to taste all the items in a very negligible amount, I bet u have to skip ur lunch for sure.

Yagna is basically a multicusine restaurant inside vedic village. The staffs here are essentially very nice and it's a pleasure of the visitors while talking to them, a common factor among all the waitors is that they are surprisingly very informative about all their menu. We stayed their for a 1N package so in the dinner we had ordered for mutton dum biriyani, and in snacks we had dry chilli chicken - both the items were so mouth watering. Cost is again, like Agnee, is on mych higher side - the biriyani will cost you around 700 including tax.

The food here is fresh and delicious. The service is appreciable. However, in peek hours one might be disappointed with there service and attention. North India, south Indian , Pasta , everything here is good to eat. Quantity is good. I like Misti dhoi , dal and tandoori roti and fresh juice.

Disappointing! From service to food, it was just not what you expect from a star resort. The staff could be a little more courteous. Looked like the only way you could get attention from the staff and ensure that your needs were met is by being loud, really loud!

Visited Vedic Village to enjoy lazy Sunday leisurely with friends and families and planned to dine at Yagna. Indoor of Yagna is very boring and sad but the resort did outdoor poolside buffet arrangement on a clear sunny winter day. The place became lively with live unplugged music performances and magic show. People stood surrounding the live performances, was singing and dancing too. Was a kind of surprise picnic for us. We were so excited in the process forgot that we were there for lunch.

They had live sandwich, pasta, south indian dishes, bbq counter. Will recommend to try Fish Barbecue, Crispy Konjee Lamb, Chilli Chicken and Chicken 65 from live counters. From many options in main course my pick was Hing Jeera Aloo, Murgh Shahi Korma and Mutton Kassa.
In desserts one must try Baked Rosogolla and Strawberry Mousse.

With Groupon vouchers of INR 899 (inclusive all) the experience didn't burn hole in our wallet but will fond in our memories for long.

Went for dinner to this place, the ambience was amazing as u wud expect it to be in Vedic. The food was also amazing even though the variety was a bit less. But food was lip smacking. Price a bit on t higher side but a place like this deserves such a price band.

I had been here on a quick official visit.  We decided to try out the brunch.  The spread though is nothing great.

The ambiance is quite ok with tables being laid out well apart from each other with the exception for the corner tables which can be quite cramped when all seats are occupied.  

The service is quite slow and rotis to forever to come though the staff were quiet courteous. 

For Rs.1000 per head it is slightly on the higher side.

Good food, however we get limited options in the buffet. I understand they want to serve it hot and so they allow us to customise our buffet. Extremely well behaved staff,  from chefs to attendants. Amazing decor with beautiful view.

we had visited for afternoon snacks...the overall experience was very nice...the service was prompt...the waiters were very helpful...the food was delicious....ambiance was classy...we had a wonderful time... 
the crispy honey chicken was the best of the lot...extremely crispy and just the right amount of sweetness...
the club sandwich was tasty too...however not extraordinary...the fillings were just the right amount...
the fish and chips were just out of this world....the bhetki just melted in the mouth...the fry was not oily...i highly recommend it...
finally we just wanted to add a sweet touch...gulabjamun laced with rabri on the top was just the perfect ending...
to summarize...ambience...4....service...5....food taste and presentation.....5....cost....3.5....

Vedic Village is definitely one of the best places to relax, eat good food amidst the greens. Rather I would say this is the only getaway to rejuvenate and relax during an weekend when you would like to sleep & have some good fun! While relaxing, you must enjoy your food and this restaurant  will not disappoint you. 
We go there almost every year and enjoy the breakfast and lunch/ dinner in the restaurant. The breakfast spread is really good with a great variety of fresh fruits, continental and south Indian food. Yes, you can get bread rolls, soup, basket of breads, poha, puri, sabji, dosa. omlette... name it and it will be there! A real GALA breakfast for sure! I have been into many such resorts, but the breakfast they serve here is one of the best. The food quality is also very good. There is always a heavy rush and you need to call them a number of time for your choice of eggs. But apart of that, everything else is just there, so you can try and wait for the egg to arrive!
Lunch buffet is rather simple, however I have not tried their a la carte. I am sure that will not be disappointing. Lunch menu does not have a number of items, but the quality of food is good.

We had a 3 Nights 4 Days stay at Vedic Village. It was a gala event of our organisation. The breakfast , lunch and dinner buffet spread was served at Yagna. Even in a buffet spread of 150 plus people, the service was just great. Hats off to the service personnel who worked day and night with a smiling face. Even the food quality is simply awesome, just perfect. There is just no scope of deducting any marks. Just try it out... !!!

Yajna, located in the Vedic Village Resort offers great and a wide variety of food at prices which are in the league of or a bit lower than that of Kenilworth, Floatel which is reasonable enough.

The restaurant serves north indian and continental cuisine with pretty elaborate menu for the former. Located in the vedic village resort, the atmosphere is pretty good both inside and outside restaurant. The only glitch is the 4-5 km rough, rocky roads leading to the resort. The restaurant is big, seats are well spaced, comfortable. The decor is simple with the high bamboo ceiling being the real eye catcher that adds to the feel. The staff service is pretty prompt and the people are warm, polite.

Coming to the food, i love the food here. the kebabs are very good and thus a kebab platter justifies every penny spent. The soups have not been to my taste always and have disappointed sometimes. The rotis are well made and the vegetables are nice. Dal makhani is too good. Paneer makhani, mix vegetable, koftas are pretty good. I recently tried the palak n corn which became one of my favorites on its debut itself.  Pulao, biryani are average and could be better. 

Overall the place offers a  great value for money.
