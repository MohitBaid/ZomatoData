Frequent visitor here! Fan of the chicken club Sandwich and the burger! The pizza here is also very tasty. But unfortunately today they didn't have any of those available in the evening . So thought of trying the fish fry. And didn't fit right for my taste buds. The coating was very bland! The the fish wasn't that fresh. Im never disappointed by the food served here but this wasn't good enough! Expected a crispier fish fry with soft fish fillet inside!

Ordered two plate Momos and one pizza..but only one plate momo and pizza arrived. When I informed them they told the Momo will come after one day I was ok with it.After one day they only called to remind me about the momos so in ordered one more plate. The delivery person took extra money from me which I noticed later and called him, he told he will give it back but he did not come. Though the amount is only rs20 but he should have returned. Disappointing.
Coming to the food..veg momos were not good at all. The pizza was nice and the chicken Momo was nice too but they should serve the momos with soup.

As long as I have been in kolkata, Rose has been our 'go-to' place for cakes and pastries. The cakes they make are simply surreal! So when a colleague of mine suggested we should try the lunches they serve, I was a bit skeptical. But a food junkie like me can never miss an opportunity to eat out. So one fine afternoon we went to the nearest outlet and ordered our lunch from Rose. Well look and feel wise it is your average cafeteria with foodgasm-inducing cakes on display. We ordered chicken pasta in white sauce and red sauce, white forest cake and blueberry pastry and fresh lime soda. The white sauce pasta really stood out. The sauce was rich and creamy, chicken was cooked optimally and herbs and pasta complimented eaxh other very well. The red sauce could have been a bit better. But the right mix of fresh herbs, tenderly cooked chicken cancelled the odds out. Fresh lime soda was refreshing and sat really well with the meal we ordered. And lastly your meal at rose will be incomplete if you don't eat the mouth watering pastries. There is nothing much to say about the cake except that they are an experience to savour and share every time you eat! And they seem to be getting better and better at it! Overall it was a good experience. Just keep doing what you do best!

The go to place to buy cake for a colleague in case the budget is restricted (cakes is the default option otherwise). Also pretty popular for thalis (prices have been hiked up recently).
Tasty food where you get rice + kulcha + dal + veg main + sweet + water bottle.
The biggest drawback and the reason for the rating is that for a person with good appetite the thali isn't filling and they don't give extra kulcha even on request stating that they get exact quantity as the plates. (Huugeee turnoff) Possibly the reason we stopped having food from there.

Do give it a shot though.

This is a restaurant where I visit frequently whenever I have some dessert craving. Also when we want to buy birthday cake for our colleagues. They have varieties of pastries and mousses along with snacks. I just love their chicken pasta. They serve it freshly prepared and it is yummy. Another brownie point of this restaurant is, all of their desserts are eggless. In cakes, red velvet pastry is my favourite. Most importantly, their service is prompt and pricing is quite cheap. For me, this is the ultimate cake and snacks shop of sector 5 both in terms of food and price.

We had Non Veg Pasta with White Sauce and it tasted too good. We also had Chicken Rolly Polly which was a very worthwhile thing to have for just Rs. 25. The place has a good seating arrangement for groups of 4 and even the staff are quite courteous.

This is a must visit confectionary for birthday cakes specially who works in Sec-V! 
I have been visiting this place since years. And every time I find their service quick and decent. No such complaints! 
This place is really pocket friendly. 
Must try their pastries- some are of fresh creams, some are of fresh fruits, jams etc. I mostly like their Tropical fruits pastry, Choco Muse, blueberry pastry, choco pastries. And for birthday cakes I like their Cherry Pudding Royal Cake.
Thali is their most popular and maximum selling items. If you make a delay reaching into the shop within 1:30 pm then you might not get thali for that day.
Ambience? It's a tiny cozy room nicely arranged.
Staffs at counter are fine. No complaints!
Thanks!

It was a friends birthday and we had ordered 3 Thalis for three of us!
The food was cold, and on asking with staff they told ki garm hii hai madam ji !
Not negotiating more with the fool we took out seat back, after 5-6 bites my friend found something unusual in the texture of paneer sabji, when she tried to explore it a little more we were horribly shocked seeing a SMALL Dead COCKROACH into the sabji!!
Finding such scary impression we made noise and ask the management to look over it and Can you imagine the response ?
It was "Galti se agya hoga, aap dusri thali le lo"
They weren't sorry at all for the BLUNDER
How can u play with HYGEINE, Quality and most important with Trust of the Customer!

We felt horrible when we tried to confront them, they didn't even answered properly! 

By that time we were only three girls in the store so we yelled a little and left after finding cold response, but now I wonder should I file a case with the food authorities or should I just stop every person stepping in for a delicious COCKROACHY meal inside!

I just feel yucck with the name of the restaurant and swear won't step in even if the food is given free or comes up as a last option in the universe!
One can starve till death but will not compromise with HYGEINE!

I hope this review will reach till management and they will do something about it!
            NOTE : Management faked in front of people to contact me for apologizing, but in reality they are pathetic as they dint gave a damn on my thing !

Ordered via Swiggy for a chicken sandwich,chicken pizza and chocolate truffle pastry.
The sandwich was nicely grilled which is not common for confectionery sandwiches.It had a generous filling of chicken carrots and Mayo,some crunchy element like lettuce would have been better co suffering the price tag.
The chicken pizza was nice and filling,The pizza sauce was spicy and it was covered with lots of cheese.The chicken filling on top was almost same as the sandwich but was present in ample amount.
The cake disappointed me though.The cake itself was dry.The ganache topping was very rich and hence provided no moisture to the cake.The taste was very chocolatey but the dryness ruined the experience.

Located at one of the busiest corners of Sector 5,it is a small place and you cannot state much about the ambience. It is a grade or two above the mio amore and other such confectioneries in the city.

Small cosy eatery in the office district with reasonable price, I tried the chicken steam momo and chicken pasta along with fresh lime soda.
I must compliment the pasta was a blast!! Indeed and the momos I loved the garnishing they did while serving and also they were soft stuffed with loads of chicken and at the price they are offering such food is indeed a delight for the foodies!!
Even the fresh lime tasted quite well better than what many famous restaurants serve!!
I give a thumps up for this place!!

I happened to tried the lunch pack it was indeed whole some and also filling and priced reasonably this is indeed must try!!

There are a few things I like about this place.. The cakes are very decent compared to the price. And if you happen to go there during the usual office lunch hours.. They serve a nice little thali that you can try.. And yes.. How  can I forget.. Their classy non veg pasta in white sauce... Thats a must try..

A decent little confectionery chain located beside globsyn building in webel, sector v. It showcases some amazing and interesting cakes, pastries. Loved the collection of cakes, their savoury items are also good enough with reasonable pricing. Grilled chicken sandwich is an healthy option but today the chips which they served along with it was soggy and not at all good. Apart from that chicken pizza, fish rolly polly was really good. Its a self service restaurant but once u place ur order if u mention any specification the servers make sure they are taken care of. Definitely one of the most finest confectionery in the block.

The special chicken burger here is outstanding..... I have never had such awesome n filling burger at such a cheap price... They bake it fresh in front of you and the beat part is that they do not use a patty... It's a solid chicken breast that you'll get inside the burger.... The cakes are really very good.... People who have their office or college near sector V, must try out here.. The thali's a also great....

Located near Globsyn Crystal building, right adjacent to the CCD, you will find the outlet named "The Rose Confectionery". And being located in an office area, it is quite a usual scene to see people flocking in at this place during the lunch time.

The reason behind this confectionery to be a crowd puller, is the delectable delights  they serve at a reasonable pocket pinch. From the snacks to the pastries and all the others, the delicious taste, the class apart quality and the pricing, altogether forms the USP of the place.

Specially, their soft, supple and delicious pastries can impress anyone for sure with its heart melting taste.

And where on earth will you get a glass full of rich, creamy and tasty cold coffee at a price as low as 50 bucks?? 
Anyday they can give the big brands like CCD, BARISHTA and STARBUCKS a run for money, for the coffee they serve at such a low price.

The ambience is calm and peaceful, and the service too is prompt.

So if you are looking for some quick lunch/bites at sector-5, this is a very good option to try out.

A very good hangout for pastries and quick snacks. Service is good. Chicken pasta in white sauce, chicken momo are really nice. They serve delicious burgers. Chicken sandwiches are fine. Very nice and home like coffee is a special attraction. Orange blossom are quite refreshing. They have a wide range of cakes and pastries to offer. I'd recommend black forest, choco mudpie, fudge brownie, tropical fruit pastry and strawberry souffle. A nice treat to the taste buds within the pocket pinch.

Just few min walk from my office. It is in webel more near globsyn. 
It offers cake, pastries, patties and thalis both veg and non veg. 
One of my office colleague gave treat last week and ordered non-vegetarian thali which consists of  one kulcha, pulao, veg tadka, Chola, one chicken item, curd, one sweet dish and achar. 
All items were fabulous and upto the mark. It tasted great. Also it's very pocket friendly. 
For the daily lunch purpose it's not recommend because it is little bit spicy.  
Overall good experience looking forward to try veg thali and other items.

Location: Sector V, in the lane opposite to the backstage.
It's a small place serving fast-paced meals mostly to office goers. I happen to come across this place when I was at clients office for CA work.  Veg thali is what I ordered on my first day there. It was quite filling and also good in taste. The only complain I have with thali is that they only give one kulcha and LOTS & LOTS of rice. @The Rose if you are reading this, please give me extra kulchas the next time. 
Veg burger and sandwiches and speciality here.
Chocolate shake is also worth a try.

I brought birthday cakes several times from them. Mianly I love their cakes because of their different tastes which are not heavy thick creamed. The cakes are very light and very good in taste. Also their price is not that much high compared to other cake shops. 
Also celebrated some of my friend's birthdays as they have good sitting arrangements.
Next thing I had several snacks items as well. never disappointed.

I haven't been to this place very much, but the chicken grilled sandwiches coupled with potato wafers and the jumbo chicken burger are the ones which I liked the most. Coming to the cakes, pastries and truffles, I still think that it needs more polish to withstand the likes of Kathleen or Monginis. But overall, a decent ambience and food without any hustle-bustle is what an IT guy like me will always crave for, after 9-10 hours of duty, and here I think, Rose have fulfilled this simple wish of mine.

The best place to buy a cake from Salt lake Sector 5. Particularly the Mango cake and Fruit cake i like the most. Because they look great.Undoubtedly one of the finest bakeries,their birthday cakes are just the epitome of finest bakery products..Conveniently priced at around Rs.350-400/- per pound, be it Black Forest, Choco Mud Pie or Tropical Fruit Cake they are objects of gastronomical delights..Their service is also quite prompt and quick and they also deliver the cakes to your office in and around sector-5..

The place is not big with a few coffee tables and you might have to wait during the busy lunch hours to get a spot..The service is quick, however at times they do delay in serving the Grilled Sandwiches..What delights me is the minimal pocket pinch for the quality of food served here..Another advantage is definitely the clean and hygienic servings.

The cake is very good in taste and the best thing about cakes here are the sugar or sweetness of cake is very balanced. This is first choice now for office bday celebration cakes and I hope will keep it going...Bon appetite:)

I went to this place with colleagues. We had non-veg pasta with mixed sauce (a mixture of tomato and white sauce). The place is clean with prompt service. They accept Sodexo coupons, which is a plus. The food was reasonably priced and oh-so-cheesy. We were satisfied with the service. In their pastry collection, I have tried Tropical Fruit Pastry and Choco Mud Pie. The Tropical Fruit Pastry was fresh, moist and topped with fresh oranges, kiwi slice cherry and pineapple. As for the Choco Mud Pie, it was everything a chocolate lover can want - it was huge, soft and chocolaty. The portion of pastry they give is definitely more than adequate. Verdict : totally satisfied.

The chicken pasta and chicken club sandwiches will simply keep you drooling over it every time you visit this place!!! I am a biiiiigggg time fan of rose which has maintained its quality and services intact since the time I have first visited(which is about 2 years ago). The non-veg thali here is a must must try. I am thoroughly impressed at the extra hygiene care that they take. The shakes and veg sandwiches are not that delectable,but that anyhow gets overshadowed with their other items on the menu!!!! Worth the money...worth a try...!!!!

Any confectionary requires consistency and this place has just that. My team and I have become regular eaters at this place and it has never let us down. The place is quite energetic and despite not being very spacious, it seats quite a few people in it.

The cake section is remarkable with ever fresh collection of cakes across all flavours. The sandwiches, burgers and pastas too fall into the must-try category. But the food that we crave the most is the non-veg thali. Its such an ambrosial mix of several delicacies that makes any lunch worth having.

Heavily recommended.

Went to this place with a friend to grab a quick bite during our training at one of the Sector V offices. A nice little place with 6-7 tables & decently priced food, this place did not disappoint me on my sole visit here.

I was having a huge craving for pizza & pastries that day & my friend had no specific preferences at that time. So we ordered a Chicken Pizza & two pineapple pastries. The pizza took some time to be made & we got our food in about 25 minutes. Considering the price, the pizza was quite tasty and was filling enough for two. The pineapple pastries were good and fresh, though I would have liked the pastries more if the amount of cream would have been a little less.

Overall, a good & budget-friendly place to grab a quick bite if you happen to be in the surrounding area.

Grilled Chicken Sandwich: Comes with potato chips, two slices of grilled breads with mayo and chicken fillings in generous portions..delicious to say the least..
Choco Mussein Cup: This is an absolute wonder..Quite unique and loves the presentation..a treat for the eyes before your palate burst with joy..Chocolate mousse comes in a choco-wafer cup alongwith a choco-stick..Its nice, fluffy.. Passionately Recommended..

Been here for lunch many a time. The non-veg thali is my favourite here. Though slightly overpriced for its quantity but considering the quality, I guess it's okay.

The pasta, fast food items like the chicken rolly polly, burgers etc are also very good. I am not a person who loves pastries but I do like the choco moose and some of the choco pastries that you get here.

The staff is also friendly and co-operative.

Overall good experiences on every visit so far.

This used to be my favourite post-work haunt, for some quick-bites, long back, when I used to work at sector V. Used to have their paneer roll and cold coffee, regularly. The only hitch was the presence of noisy college-goers. Visited this place today, after a long time. The cold coffee still tastes equally yummy and chocolaty. However, the chicken rolly polly hardly had any chicken in it, and tasted stale. Wish the staff were a bit more professional, as well. However, one really cannot expect more than this, since it is one of the most pocket-friendly eateries at sector V.

A very small outlet (hardly 20 seater) in Sector V, near Indismart XSpicy Hotel. The place however has a wide & delicious range of pastries. Do visit this place occasionally for its pastries/ snacks or Veg thali.
Had it's veg thali today - which consists of 1 Masala Kulcha, 1 portion peas pulao, paneer, black dal, chana masala, mixed raita, pickles, vinegar onions & 1 bottle bisleri. The portions are so small that your hunger is never satisfied. They do not serve extra kulchas, even at extra costs. Chana masala had more oil and less of chana. Black Dal was tasty and paneer was so so. Rice quality did not seem too good. Raita, however, was out of the world. ¬†The food was served just warm (not hot).
Given the tiny servings, the cost of Rs. 132 for a veg thali is very high.
I do come here as a last resort for lunch on office days.
Ambience is like boring and given the limited seating capacity, you might have to wait for some time in order to get a seat.¬†
More of a self service restaurant, however, they have recently started office delivery on orders exceeding Rs. 300.
Staff are too busy to greet you as it's a very small workforce and they are always too busy. Inspite of several drawbacks, they do have their share of the customers in Sector V and their thali stocks are sold off in may be 1 - 1.5 hours.¬†

Huge scope for improvement !!!

Rose is one of the best places in sector 5 for vegetarian food.¬†
Not over priced, the quality of the food is good. The thali quantity is also good.
The thali has 1 paratha, pulao, mixed veg, tarka dal, paneer, raita, and a bottle of water
Being a sweet tooth, a small sweet with the thali would be perfect.
Would also recommend their chicken sandwich.
For sector 5 regulars, this is a good option.

This place is situated right next to my college and so I end up going there quite often. My favourite is the nutty pie. Ask for it to be heated for a minute while ordering. Their veg and non - veg Thalis are amazing and the quantity is just right. Have tried their grilled chicken sandwich and it tastes good too. Their displayed items are a little oily. The beverages, like lemonade needs some improvement. Prices are reasonable as well keeping in mind the clientele. Overall a place worth visiting.

Now this confectionery can easily rank amongst the top ten bakeries of kolkata. It has an awesome location  . The baking stuff that they do is amazing. Its fresh cream. The bases are fresh. Soft and supple. The pastries just melt in the mouth . All I had are the pastries from here. And I am thoroughly mesmerised by the taste. though wanted to go i for the blackforest and chocolate patries , thought would Give them a break and Tried in for other flavours. The pineapple pastry is a must try. Its yummy. The pineapple slices , the fresh cream is amazingly good. the white forest pastry is another surprise.  They generally serve u cold.and its out over world. The feeling when the cream melts in the mouth is amazing. Was lucky enough to get the strawberry pastry. It did taste excellent. Fresh Strawberry cream and strawberry pulps within the bread slices gave a feeling that I was in heaven . I fell in love with strawberries all over again. Thanx rose confectionery.

This is one of the most amazing confectioneries I have come across in Saltlake. The pastries are amazing. The cakes can give a good competition to CCD, Upper Crust, Just Bakes, Monginis. The pineapple pastry/cake is a must have. It just melts in your mouth completely! The Mango Mousse is really soft too. The Tropical Pastry is another good pastry. Chocolate pastry/cakes are equally good. The Blue berry pastry is not that good.

For those who don't like sweet, they make amazing pasta in white sauce. Its a must try!

Cost for 2 in my case: 300

It is Ok,nothing extraordinary to me.

--11/11/2014--
it turned out disgusting now.Today's finding:
Sandwich were over burned and too much flaky with no taste at all.
Chips(came along with Sandwich) were just too bad.Smell of oils and made by greenish potatoes.
Sandwich was not tasty and stuffing chicken did smell bad(seems chicken was not fresh).
Only good thing is the muffin was actually eatable.

I have rated this confectionery down(Previous was 3.5,now it is 2.5)

The best confectionery in sector 5 hands down. All our office birthday parties ,must hv a cake frmo this place. Be it chocolate, dark or normal, mousse or brownie or fruit cakes like fresh cream pineapple or mixed fruit or blueberry, i can vouch for the taste n quality. Each pastry is priced between 45-60 and its so worth it. I have even tried out their Pasta in white sauce and it is amazing. I have seen during lunch hours the place is full of people and having their thaali... wish to have it soon. So many people altogether cannot choose something bad. So thali review coming up next.their cakes are all eggless and are priced from 250 onwards.... good ones are 350-390 for ¬†1 lb. ENjoy!

Must say Rose confectionery is far much better than its dine in nowadays. The cakes, puddings, pastries, moose, tarts etc.. i have tried everything there and its really tastes good and perfect..¬†
The Choco fantasy cake is my personal fav.. nowadays whenever there is an occasion i try and make sure that atleast one cake is from ROSE.
The Choco mudpie is also a bliss to your mouth.. truly amazing..
Pineapple and black forest puddings are also very nicely made and brings more happiness to your occasions.
Blueberry pastry is not so good but can give a try to it..

All in all a good treat for all the North zoned people where we dont have kookie jar and cakes¬†
and its far much better than the nearby competitors like monginis, kathleen or just baked.
Recommended by me! :)

This is one of the most amazing confectioneries I have come across in Saltlake. The pastries are amazing. The cakes can give a good competition to CCD, Upper Crust, Just Bakes, Monginis. The pineapple pastry/cake is a must have. It just melts in your mouth completely! The Mango Mousse is really soft too. The Tropical Pastry is another good pastry. Chocolate pastry/cakes are equally good. The Blue berry pastry is not that good.

For those who don't like sweet, they make amazing pasta in white sauce. Its a must try!

Cost for 2 in my case: 300

This is the most popular confectionery from where we order birthday cakes at our office. We have mainly tried cakes and pastries here at this place. The main reason for its popularity at our workplace is their super prompt delivery. They deliver within Saltlake Sector-V within an hour, and no booking is required beforehand if you are going for 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 lb (pound) cakes.

I have tried several varieties of their cakes - White Forest, Black Forest, Pineapple, a variety of Chocolate cakes, to name a few. Personally I love their Pineapple Cakes, but it is not always available. The White Forest and Black Forest cakes r also awesome. They are extremely light and kinda melts in your mouth! Though I must say that some of their Chocolate cakes are very heavy, you can't have a lot of it. ¬†

Coming to the pocket pinch - Their cakes are popularly priced and the overall price is quite reasonable and moderate. Coupled with quick service and super tasty cakes, this confectionery is here to stay.

Cheers!

Tried out the pastries from here . In one word it's just awesome the best being mango cup. White forest should have been a bit less on sweetness. Mixed fruit n blueberry were quite good. A few more slices of fruit n cherry would have made the pastries perfect. A good experience . They also accept food coupons ... 
A nice place in sector 5 which serves good. Pastries . 
==================================



Again a joint just below globsyn had heard a lot of good reviews about this place. Had skipped my lunch at office so was really hungry, was in no mood to have pasta so ordered basic stuffs like a veg cheese grill sandwich along with chicken rolly poly. The sandwich was very very very average. Street cafe which is located in the campus of BIPL is 100 times better. Chicken roly poly was average too , monginis keeps better stuff. Yet to try their thalis and pastas. But the sandwich was very basic , they should improve here tooo....

The Pasta and pastries are really good compared to the price--white forest , pineapple , tropical food --I have tasted these. The rest all were looking delicious ,so guess they will be equally good.
For ordering birthday cakes, this place is suitable.
the snacks items are OK --better to have cakes and pastries here.
I have heard that pasta provided here is of good quality , may be next time I visit here, I shall try that out.

Since this place is close to our workplace, we bring our birthday cakes from here for almost the last 2-3 years now. The brand name is old, but the quality of food is very much above average. You get many options in cake, but in sandwiches and patiz, the options are somewhat limited.

This place is one of my favourite confectionery in kolkata. I just love their Pasta in white sauce....its yummy. I love to have it again and again. I must mention the pizza too... It just amazing..with lots of cheese and vegetables....I love to have them.
On the pastries I have not tasted much. but I really like the big birthday cakes.. may it be white forest or the royal cake and last but not the least their thali... I have tasted their non veg thali...which is awesome... Its quite filling for me... the chicken preparation in very nice and less spicy. 

I really miss this place  as I am not in kolkata right now

This is the restaurant/cafe I would call "my discovery for the year 2013". This place is neatly designed and nestled in the heart of Sector 5 in the Globsyn Building. If you are bored of your office lunch - this is once place you can visit for a filling meal at very moderate prices. The decor resembles a tyical order-eat-move out cafe with seating for nearly 30 people.

A must have at Rose is the Thali - you could opt for a veg or non veg thali which comes with a bottle of mineral water. At 130 bucks the non veg thali has a paratha, curd, pickles, rice, kali dal and boneless chicken - all in decent portions which makes it quite popular amony my office colleagues. The Thali is neatly packed and served. A personal favourite of mine is the non veg pasta in white sauce! If you are visiting Rose for a quick bite do try out the chicken sandwich which comes with chips. The patties and other snack items are also pretty good.

The rose has saved me inumerable times when it has come to celebrating office birthday parties. The pastries are not as sweet and creamy as the ones in Monginis and is very reasonable. The 1 pound Black Forest, Chocolate Fancy Cake and Tropical Fruit Cake are my favourites. Most importantly if your are in office and lazy enough to venture out, the good news is they do office delivery!

good food but they refused to home deliver  just 1 km away from their sector 5  shop. They definitely lost out on a 500 rs order on new year's eve.

This place is pretty good for cakes, pastries and snacks. Beats the quality of Monginis, Kathleen and other players in the league. A bit costlier gor sure. One must try the range of thalis - both veg and non veg- out here.

The Rose Confectionary is the only place in Sector V to enjoy those sweet cravings that you might have while at work. The cakes are good. I have also had their veg thali a number of times. Though the portions might seem small to one's eyes at the first glance, I can assure you that it fills you up. I like their choco mudpie cake vey much. And the interiors are nothing fancy but it has a soothing effect. The pasta in white sauce is good too. Also, they accept meal vouchers. In a nutshell its the only place in sector V where you can find decent cakes. An appeal to the owners -

Please start selling ice creams.. There's a dearth of good ice cream parlours in salt lake sec V.

To begin with, their location is really good. The ambience is like that of any other confectionery, very spacious and all...

I just had the pastries over there, which were quite okay, I mean, given the slightly "mishti" touch to all of their pastries... However, the spoons of plastic look really cheap and so does the thermocol plate... The service is good, the staff is fine, but they need a more experienced baking chef, who can turn out better pastries and cakes to suit the crowd of the area!
