Poor food quality
I ordered for club kachori for my dad's birthday breakfast.
I was highly disappointed that the oil in kachori was rancid and so the kachori had a pungent taste and odour.
Even though the quantity of sabji along with it was good but the taste was not up to the mark.
No value for money at all!

Alas ! my high hopes from Chernamrit fell down a steep slope. This is how the events unfolded.
¬†
Location : Between Kestopur and Baguiati on VIP road on the main road itself on the left side. Parking space is available.¬†¬†
¬†
Went there on a sunday evening around 730 pm and found a table easily. The servers were very hospitable but need to understand a couple of things. We were served hot n sour soup which was so hot that we had to wait 10 mins just to consume it and even before we could have it we were served with crispy mushrooms which got cold and a bit soggy by the time we could complete our soup which was extremely spicy (many wouldnt like it but i loved it).¬†

Now getting to the main item which spoilt the evening completely. The pizza dosa seemed to be a rip off for 250 bucks. We get tastier dosa at gupta brothers ( swimming pool area in salt lake) for less than half this price.¬† Seemed like a forced rendition of pizza dosa and didnt go down well.

Might try their indian some other time if this memory fades but for now it a miss it place.

Ordered for delivery. It came piping hot. Crispy chilli babycorn was excellent, like always. But both veg Manchurian and veg fried rice were much below par. In fact the Manchurian had a non-veg flavour to it, even though the restaurant is veg. We threw away 3 out of 6 Manchurian balls. Now before ordering anything chinese from here I will have to think thrice. Can't comment on other cuisines served here

First when I enter with my family they provided us with a small table for 3 persons on which you cannot keep more than 2 service bowls along with plates.
Next when I asked them to serve dinner after we finish our starter, then also they have kept our dinner order before we have finished our starter. According to rate of veg augratin quantity was too less and cheese was not properly visible.
The food was not at all good. There was too much salt in Dal makhani. They served us rotten onion as complimentary. They play music in loud voice
 which was unbearable. The staffs are need to be trained.

WORST SERVICE EVER THAT TOO FOR THE FIRST TIME
I order approx once in twice a week.
Today I ordered Veg Momo n Pizza Dosa
In Veg Momo we didn't got any soup or chutney
N when I asked for that over phone they smartly disconnected the call.
Since I have already paid for it n wanted to eat that ofcourse so I had to call them up again n they said they will send chutney.
I stay in the same building where chernamrit is there. Till now haven't received chutney.
If you don't have chutney you shouldn't have taken the order.
I had to give this review because it's almost third time I am having complain over food.
But the way they talked over phone was worst than ever.
Is it that u r sending it for free? Or are u not responsible to recheck whether each n every item is there in parcel or not.

Located near keshtopur.
This is a new restaurant I've heard from many people so went and gave it a try and was disappointed. First of all the staffing was not upto the mark. On a Sunday evening I could hardly see 4 staff in the restaurant. The service was not good at all. The staff were frustrated and then they even got rude to other people in the restaurant. 
Coming to the food. It's a place for veggie lovers. I had ordered for tandoori aloo, Pyaaz ke dahi kabab, Ajwaini Paneer Tikka, Dal Makhani and a chef's special biryani.
The Tandoori aloo, Dal Makhani and the biryani tasted good. But I was disappointed with the paneer tikka and the seekh kabab. Paneer tikka was served at a room temperature which tasted bad and the dahi kabab was way too sour. I had even complained to the manager but the told it cannot be changed. 

Overall a disappointing experience.

Food- 3.5/5
Ambience-4/5
Staff-2/5

Very poor service . Food is served after a very long wait . Though in other restaurants the water is served free of cost unless and until u ask for mineral water bottles but here it is compulsory to buy mineral water while having food and that too at Rs. 30 per litre. At the gap of 6 months we visited this restaurant twice but the service is as poor as the first time though the price of the items have increased .

Food was average. Packaging was bit hasty and thus the dosa I ordered came saggy as the chutney fell all over it. Overall, kind of fulfilling vegetarian food . However,this place is undoubtedly the best vegetarian restro in kestopur by far. Did not like the lemon rice .It definitely tasted 'fishy'.

Being a non vegetarian, I don't frequent towards Vegetarian Restaurants but this was a (forced) choice one evening which turned out to be nice. 
Conveniently located on VIP Road, Kestopur Junction. Its a new joint, nice interiors and ambience.

We ordered Paneer Tikka for starter which was superbly done with just perfect grilling.
Therafter ordered Dal Makhani, Kadhai Paneer, Special Navratna Pulav and Tandoori Rotis. The portions served were sufficient, generous in quantity. 

Service was brisk , staffs were courteous and the food - scrumptious. 
What more can a diner ask for. 
Just found the bill to be on a bit higher side for its segment. Beyond all, recommended !!

Edit 1: Raj Kachoris - Morning Breakfast !

The quantity is less in online order compare to takeaway. It is not sufficient for one person also. If there is difference in quantity of the food what's the point for ordering online.

Although the restaurant is 5 mins from Baguihati but these people have delayed saying twice that they will take 15 20 mins to deliver although the delivery man had left 20 mins back.
Very bad attitude and response

Dates of Tasting: Feb 2017, Jun 2017

Jun 2017:

Last weekend, the second edition of CalBunka - Saturday Night Music & Market was held at The Stadel. Chernamrit was one of the participants there.

Being CalBunka's Veg Food Curator and Official Food Blogger, I opted to taste it's Jini Dosa.

It was a wonderful Dosa, made up of a uniform and thin crepe and a vegetable rich stuffing comprising of - green capsicum, red capsicum, yellow capsicum, onion, tomato and spring onion, alongwith two medium dollops of butter and a generous sprinkling of processed cheese. It was served with two types of chutneys - coconut and tomato-onion.

Instead of the usual half folded crepe style presentation, the Jini Dosa was served in the form of three pin-wheels and two strips! Kindly refer to the attached pic for better understanding.

It tasted excellent. The quantity served was more than enough for one person. Both the chutneys also tasted nice.

Feb 2017:

Recently, I was appointed the official Food Critic of Tastes of India (ToI), the biggest food carnival in Kolkata, which was held from 25 to 26 February 2017 at Nalban Food Park.

Chernamrit was one of the participants there.

I opted to taste Tikia Chhola and Palak Patta Chaat from their stall. Both the chaats were served in good portions and were garnished with enough - tamarind chutney, sev and coriander leaves. The seasonings were also good.

In the former chaat, the potato based tikiyas were well cooked but the chhola was little spicy. While, the latter chaat was just perfect. It was made of long and fresh spinach leaves, deep fried with a thick coating of gram flour based batter.

Overall, both the chaats tasted quite nice.

I sampled kababs and a pizza cum paratha at the food fest . It was highly recommended by friends . It was cheesy and layered like partha thin crisp and seasoned with indian chutney . I loved it and so did my friends. The kababs were good sized and well made .¬†
Though i found the price a bit steep for four pieces of kabab. The taste and size makes one for give the pocket pinch .¬†
I would definatly try it again .
I must say the chef dishing it out had a flair and speed . He didnt keep his customers waiting for long .

Honestly, I admit being a non vegetarian I donot frequent veg places, but during a food festival at Nalban, my friend suggested that we try the pizza dosa at this place. There was a long queue. The person preparing dosas was experienced. After a long wait we got the pizza dosa. The dosa was really really nice. We dnt get to try the other dosas, frankly speaking didn't wanna wait that long. But I am considering visiting this place again. Nice one

Visited the restaurant with my sister yesterday. We visited it after reading the great reviews in Zomato. And we must say we had a lovely time there. Not only was the food great but also the ambiance and the hospitality were amazing too. We had Hong Kong rice and stir fried vegetables in garlic sauce. We ordered one plate each and it was more than sufficient for us.It was filling tasted great too. Most importantly it did not leave any heavy feeling in the stomach after the meal was over and we also had some space for amazing kesar tea as well! We being vegetarians were delighted to find the restaurant. Will definitely visit again.¬†P.S ¬†Extremely reasonable!
