Make no mistake. this place was a nice dine in resto until the entire things changed for them and now its a small roadside fast food centre.
                Dont get misunderstood by the name as the name signifies the surname of the owner here. Located just near the chinar park beside the Newly opened Airtel showroom. Small place with some of the Chinese variety for you. Ambiance is a 12 seater a little bit conjusted and dirty. The staff was sitting idle was not interested while i was talking to him, thou later paid some attention. Â They have also got soft drinks in the fridge for the coolers. Didnt tried much as had a lunch in aminia before so tried their Chicken roll for a taste. Paratha was soft but it seemed not fresh, Chicken was way to small in that price. Very less you can expect from this place but during pujas i guess it will be a full house for them.

One of the pocket friendly restaurant adjacent to city center 2...

Big surprise is their quantity and the quality toooo!!!! They take nominal time to deliver to your place.. service is very prompt. Unlike other food joint their main area of speciality is bengali cuisines.  Big thumbs up for the bengali dishes...

A pocket friendly place serving decent food.I went there with my mother today and had ordered the below items.

Rice,vegetable dal,desi potato chips,mocha chingdi(Banana flower with prawn),sorshe ilish(hilsa cooked in mustard gravy),bhetki paturi(fish in mustard sauce,wrapped in oil brushed banana leaf and then steam cooked) and green mango chutney.I found the items were tastier than Bhojohori Manna.The bill was 710 rs.The service was really good and the waitors were cordial and patient.I felt this place is not that popular but it should be.To be very frank,I came out with a happy face.

I wish them Good luck.

I have been here a few times and the experience has not been splendid. First of all its a mediocre restaurant so you can't keep high expectations but with it comes alot of cons as well. The food is okay. Just okay, for the price you pay. Quantity just enough and quality average. Ambience is not worth it. Moreover every time I have been here, I found mosquitoes to be enjoying the atmosphere more than me. So you get it, its good for a snack but not if you want a pleasurable and delicious meal. Find something worth it.

The food here is delicious and the rates are great. It not a swanky restaurant but does its job well when it comes to food. Haven't tried home delivery yet however I'm assuming it to be good as heard from my friends. Definitely recommended.
