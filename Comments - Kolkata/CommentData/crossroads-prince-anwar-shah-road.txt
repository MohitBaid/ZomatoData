Had their pork bacon with eggs and  burger here. It was disappointing. Moreover, the quantity is is too less for the price. The burger was still average.

Since Zomato happened to me, I've stopped going out for food hunts a lot. This place serves amazing burgers without burning a hole in your pocket. Moreover, you can customize your burger as you like. The double ham and cheese burger is something I could swear by, it being so juicy and tender. I've also tried the ham sandwich with scrambled eggs and cheese. Fulfilling and leaves your stomach with a smile.

Don't plan to sit and eat here, and you won't be able to either. There's just two stools that aren't clean and on road. So there are chances of you getting hit by an auto while you're savouring your burger. 
We had a jumbo burger, 100Rs, no extra taxes, and a huge burger with chicken and Ham and cheese stuffed. It was good. You can expect that same burger in some fancy café charging you with 350 easily with some chips and ketchup. It was good, chicken was tender, the ham was flavourful and it was worth it. But that's the only thing good about it, I saw plates with flies hovering over on groud, that Paytm option is just for display - only cash, and if you're planning to pack your food, well it isn't good either. Just a foil wrap with a thin plastic bag. Hygiene is pretty poor, and no place to sit. But the food was good, if you choose quality over quantity, this place isn't for you. 
PS: This picture is poor, really poor. :(

Ordered Bacon with eggs for lunch, a while ago. Delivery was 40 minutes late. The bacon couldn't be chewed, had to be thrown away. The egg had no salt. The quantity was ridiculously low for price. My jaw is still aching due to attempts of chewing the cursed bacon.

On the eve of diwali, to surprise my g.f I purchse 1chicken burger for her, which is her fav. And 1cheese chicken hot dog for me. Earlier we had burger from this outlet and were eager to taste it once again.. The outlet is small no sitting arrangements only for take away that's why they cook only quick bites.. But the proverb don't judge a book by it's cover fits aptly into this outlet, as they serve the best quick bites in this lake grdens area. The taste quality is truely fantabulous, and the price is also reasonable so i personally recommend to all my followers to go through this CROSSROADS OUTLET, u will not be betrayed by its taste..

Almost a hole in the wall place situated in Lords more.This place gives you the most bang for your buck in terms of quality,quantity and ofcourse the most important one "Taste".I have endless times from this place, and is yet to be disappointed with their food and service.On one of my recent orders I ordered chicken burger with extra cheese which was very good and messy.The patty and the buns were crisp and the oozing cheese made me lick my fingers.I also ordered their french fries which was crisp to perfection, nothing much to say about it. Always a two thumbs up from me for this place.Highly recommended.

I generally order the Pork Platter from this joint but have tried their sandwiches, burgers and wraps too. I have never been disappointed as the costs are really pocket friendly.
