Maa Durga Sweets is a decent sweet shop at Sodepur, which sells a variety of sweets and a few snacks too.

Ambience is nice and clean.

Service is fast.

Their Kachori , Samosa is quiet nice. Sweets are above average, nothing special.

Good for local people's needs.

Maa Durga sweets at Panihati is well known sweets store here. I walked in try out few of their sweets. The one I really loved here is their Lancha, Khir Sandesh and Rosogolla. Sweets were good in quality. The store was clean and good.

Maa Durga Sweets is a sweet confectionary located at Sodepur.

Ambience is nice .

Service is prompt.

Tried Samosa, makha sondesh . Both were fresh and nice still nothing to rave about. There are ample better options in Kolkata.

Pocket pinch is economical .

Caters the need of local people pretty well.

Whenever I visit my Uncle's house I always make sure to visit this place at least once. Though its a sweet shop but theirs hot kachuris and samosas are a must try! Served straight out of couldron...the kachuris bubble with aroma! Its high on taste....and they are by far one of the few shops in Kolkata who still sell daaler kachuri. Quite popular to the locals also for their hot goja which is good too!
