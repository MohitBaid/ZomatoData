Been going to this place for more than 9 years now. I am amazed at how well they've maintained the same quality and taste ever since. The chana masala, mix veg and nan are worth trying. They start services right from 9am and have most of the items lined up until 3pm or so. The place is always packed and whenever I am in Dalhousie area, I don't miss a chance to grab my meal here. Love this place. A must try for all.

I happened to pass by this on road eatery and I was amazed by sheer volume of patrons eating with one hand holding the plate. I could not miss the shining of butter over hot tandoori rotis and kulcha's. As I dont experiment with non-standard road side food items I passed by but thoughts kept on coming that what is that x factor which was holding so much customers and hence I striked back within 2 hours to try out the food.
As soon as I reach and asked whats available in hand came the plate with hot missi roti with shining butter and small dish with paneer masala. Lots of chunks whole heatedly filled in the dish and with the first morsel of the gravy I could only think of high quality restaurant. Â The paneer chunks were soft to the core and not to mention the missi roti which surpassed all my expectations.
I could not hold my self to ask for kucha which landed in my plate hot and drizzling in may be 1 sec. Again it was class apart and parallely i was wondering how much will he charge as I have not asked for any price. Filling of Kulcha was also good it was real soft. After this I had a glass of lassi with malai khurchan topping. With all this high class astonishing taste I paid just Rs. 70/-. I just could not believe it and then realised why people come in hoardes and whats the parameter which draws people at this corner. If you skip your inhibition of road side / hygiene related issues like what I did, I am sure you will enjoy a high class meal at dirt cheap prices. Overall - should try when ever you are in the vicinity.

Just imagine this roadside stall is in zomato...that's enough to convince how popular this place is and how delicious the foods are.... :)
It's a vegetarian place though.... This place is always packed with people standing right in front of the stall for their food...some eating and some waiting....u can't imagine how cheap the food is at the same time...just to give u an example... Take half plate of 2 varieties of gravy items and a half plate of pulao and one butter roti and a masala papad...they price for all this is just rs. 49 :)
Best place to eat for office people in the bbd bhag area...well, it's a roadside eatery so don't expect it to be very hygiene.... It'll be a typical roadside experience...
Highly recommended**

New Mission Dhaba - Probably not new but also named as 'Punjabi Dhaba'. 
========
Intro: This dhaba is located on the roadside and very easy to identify as its very near to law point or Kaka tea. Most of the office goers must have had food here at least once. As i had been in that area, i planned to hit this place with some of my friends. 
========
Food ordered:

Well they serve you onion, achaar and green chilly with whatever you order and this dhaba is also very cheap in prices. It is a pure vegetarian eatery and serves you food instantly leaving you less stress of delay in returning back to office or say spending some time for chit chat. However, the only issue here is the place to sit.

1) mix veg - it tasted decent. One can go with it. 
2) paneer butter - it could've been better specially with marination. 
3) chana masala - Must try out here. Lip smacking. 
4) tandoori roti - was good. The more crispier the merrier. 
5) Kulcha - #must try here. 
========
Meal for two: 75-250 max.
========
Summary:
Food quality 3.4/5
Quantity 4.3/5
Taste 4.5/5
Hygiene 3.3/5
Service 4.6/5
Value for money 4.6/5
========
Conclusion: 

I would visit it again in near future to try their pulao and daal. One shall not miss this eatery. :)

Probably the cheapest roadside eatery you can get in Calcutta. They have two branches one opposite vardaan and one near kaka tea petrol pump in Chandni, Ganesh Chandra Avenue. All their sabzis are great. The raita should not be given a miss at all. It has a perfect blend of vegetables, Probably some portions of fruits too and tasty spices. I often wonder how do they still serve so much at just 20-25 rupees a plate. And let me tell you, having my office here and a lot of regular work too I have eaten at this outlet either standing or take away a lot of times and never fell ill. This is not like any other roadside dhaba. This is the exemplar of a perfect takeaway eatery.

Located on RN Mukherjee road pretty close to Kaka Tea Stall, these people have been taking care of my lunch since so many years !!!

The place serves great food at lightning speeds at crazy prices. Basically i feel the place is the spicier n a bit oily version of kaka tea stall and serves food at cheaper prices but only thing is one has to takeaway or stand on a sidewalk to eat. I would prefer this place for a takeaway especially during summers otherwise i am pretty comfortable eating on road as well alongside so many others like me!!! The dal tarka as well as dal makhani is great, mix veg is nice, paneer butter is average but i love their veg pulao which is  better than that at kaka tea stall. Overall one could get a handsome king size meal at just 50 bucks max which is great but would love them more if they could lower the oil content a bit.

My Precious ! Not surprised 2 b the first reviewer , as those who eat here regularly , really don't have time to praise it .
 
I am a loyalist for 6 years now ! This is the best place for satisfying your veggie urges @ on the road prices . 
go there eat like an animal and then wash down everything with a couple glasses of REAL lassi (not the awful packaged ones !
