Didn't visit the restaurant.
Couldn't locate it by myself.
Google maps n actual location mismatch
Tried their chicken biryani via home delivery
It was full of oil n felt like they had mixed the chicken chap with rice added some extra oil packed n served it in a nice container.
Comon that's not biryani 
Bad!

I don't generally rate restaurants below 3 but when something exceeds your expectations, you are obliged to do so. First thing first,waiting time for a starter was near about 40 mins. Repeated enquiry with the servers and there assurance was "in 10 mins". Finally when it came, the quality of food was not the wait of 40 mins. Really disappointed with the noodles. And shockingly the bill was also on the higher side. Overall utterly disappointed. This bad restaurant I have never been to in my life.

This place is close to my home. Most of the time I prefer taking home delivery from here. I have been to this place only once. Decor is awesome. Have tried their biryani, fried rice and chilly chicken. Food quality is good but little bit overpriced.

The delivery takes a long time and the foot isn't good at all. There is no flavour, and the food kinda just floats in the spices. I'd give it a 0 but that's not allowed, so I'm giving it a 1.

I have been to this place quite a few times and trust me they really serve good food in less price..U will get a calm and quiet ambience out there as this place remains deserted with very few people eating there...The decor is simple yet attractive and the staffs are well behaved...The food is really yummy and they don't charge any kind of tax which is a cherry on the cake...This restaurant serves multicuisine...I generally go there for dine in but Today I had ordered for home delivery...To my awe and astonishment they don't take any charge for home delivery neither have the minimum rupee criteria...The quantity is really good and the taste is mind blowing..
I had ordered...
Crispy chicken....Its really good,crunchy and juicy...It was made less spicy(as told by me) and I really enjoyed it..
Crispy baby corn...Little bit over cooked but it was yummy too..And the quantity was really good!
Chicken Hakka noodles...This need to be mentioned that it was really good and tasty..The noodles didn't tangle and was soft and yummy..
To end of...
A definite recommendation from my side for foodies who want to munch onto some yummy dishes sitting at their home sweet home..

This place has won my heart and I have visited this place quite a few times now. I like their interior, decor and the lightings. The decor is very simple with right amount of lightings which is needed. The furniture are good and comfortable. The staffs are well behaved, attentive and always ask for feedback which I really like. The place is pocket friendly as they do not take any kind of tax.
How to Locate?
Its little difficult to locate. Better to use Google map for this, which will be the best option. The place is located in between Behala and New Alipore. You can find this place if you go towards New Alipore from James Long Sarani.

What to order?
I have tasted both Chinese and Indian at this place and I liked both, though the Indian was lil better, the Chinese was not much behind.

::::: INDIAN :::::

::: Murgh Handi : A spicy chicken dish richky cooked. Anyone who wants to eat spicy for the day must try this.

::: Murgh Makhanwala : A bit like Chicken Butter Masala but this one is much more tangy with a thick tomato flavoured gravy. I loved the preparation. Not much spicy, with little sweetness in it making it tastier.

::: Murgh Tandoor : Nothing special but you can always go for this as they make it well.

::: Murgh Reshmi Kabab : Same as the previous, if you wanna go for any starter in Indian items this can always be one of your choice.

::::: CHINESE :::::

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ CHICKEN/MIXED FRIED RICE: Good taste, good quality and always a good option for Chinese Lovers.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ CHICKEN MANCHURIAN : They stick to the basics without much experiment which makes things better for them

I didn't try much of Chinese Food here as I was deeply attracted to Indian Items.

LAST WORDS:
People staying in Behala should find this place and should definitely visit this place. I am sure you won't be disappointed here.

Ordered food from this joint yesterday..Biryani is sumptuous..I must admit initially I was put off by the multi coloured Biryani but it tasted good.3 sumptuous pieces of mutton,a potato,an egg!! I mean what else is needed and all this for 180 bucks...Chicken Makhanwala was succulent and made in an authentic Punjabi style..Naans were soft and as they should be..Very happy with the service..Inspite of the joint being a bit far from my place they behaved very cordially and the food arrived well before time..Satisfied overall..

Quince Biriyani rocks!!!.. First of all..its very near to my house. They even deliver rolls...no minimum or maximum billing amount required...
I ordered in their toll free number...and just gave them my address ..the delivery was prompt...and the quantity is pretty good. It comprises of 3 medium sized chicken, one big potato üç† and an egg cut in two pieces..being a foodie I can finish one plate of biriyani be it haji or arsalan but ...in this case ...i could never.
The spread of fried onions makes the platter more satisfying and yum...m a regular customer of their biriyani...so good work quince...hope to taste more of your dishesüòâüòä

first of all i would like to thank swiggy for delivering the food so awesomely! and a big hug for providing me a surprise discount ^_^

ok now lets come to the review.. i ordered one Murgh Biryani (it contained one boiled egg cut into 2 piece , 3 medium sized chicken piece and one medium sized boiled potato) 

the quince biryani is the best and different from usual biryani we have... the biryani was delicious... the chicken pieces were soft and juicy the egg was good but the potato was not so tasty... anyways quince biryani just rocks!!! it's totally different type biryani i am 100% sure you will love it!! also it contained some fried onions :D

I am a foodie and i always keep looking for places that can serve me innovate food and have creativity in what "the Quince" do. This Quince Brand makes me travel to streets, restaurant to malls in Kolkata. After several years of this food exploration, I have come to the conclusion that to have a great tasting food and ambiance that is incredible, the new Alipur kornar is the place to have real good restaurants under one roof. Every one ¬†must try & get ow-some experience of food flavor .

"The Quince " Brand have already proved that "Your Flavor,Our Passion".
Best wishes for the Quince....!!! keep going............

Food is really good. However the quantity is not very satisfactory. We had placed an order for home delivery and tried some of their North Indian dishes. Would definitely recommend for home delivery to people staying in and around that area. Also would sure try their dine-in too very soon someday.
