The food is awful.
We got a chef's pizza for Rs 140 incl tax.
Synopsis of the pizza - Crunchy Chapati with cheeze and olives and few carrots. Etc. 
The pizza was so awful that we had to leave.

Nice usage of space.

The rating is just for ambience and the welcome that the lady owner showed when I visited this place. I had ordered a takeaway Paw Bhaji with a coke, needless to say only the coke is worth mentioning here. Paw tasted stale and bhaji was, i am not even sure what it was. Not sure if I will be visiting again.

Veganism does not mean vegetarianism. Nevertheless, I guess it was used to increase the coolness factor.
While in Bangur, me and my friends stumbled on to this place and decided to check it out. The place is quite small but I loved the use of space inside. They had a divided the whole place into three tiers which was very innovative. There was a lady who was managing the place and was very welcoming.
Even though the place and the menu looked quite promising, it was a disappointing visit. The food was dull and not worth having at all. We ordered cheese fondue, a brownie shake and a sizzling brownie. The fondue was still better in taste than the rest of the items. The lady had recommended the brownie shake, it being their speciality. But it was a major let down as the taste was beyond weird. The sizzling brownie was also very bad as the cake was burnt from the bottom and got stuck to the hot plate, the chocolate syrup had also got a burnt taste to it. I have had so many brownies but this was the worst I ever had. When confronted about the problems in their food, the lady was kind of surprised and claimed that this was their recipe for the above items.
It would be nice if they amped up the quality of their food and the food tastes as good as the place looks.

A small cafe like joint in bangur. They have managed their space really well, for which we need to give them credit. In a small space they have managed to bring out 3 different kinds of seating arrangements which are pretty comfortable. Now I've visited this place for about 3 times. Out of only the first visit was worth it. On the first visit the food was really good, but on the second visit the cafe seemed to lethargic. The service was soo slow. The pasta we got was served to us for like after 45 mins, and that was also not properly cooked. For a cafe in that area, that kind of pasta was a shame. The only good thing was the cola, and the noodles were also eatable. The third time the service however was not that slow and the food was also kind of good. We had ordered a burger and a vada paw along with cola and doodh-cola. They were served on time and the taste was pretty okay.

They have a great food to serve to us. Very popular for vegetarian food, this place is often crowded at lunch and dinner hours and hence getting a table could be difficult but the its worth the wait as the food is great, service is quick and the menu has quite a lot of options.

A great place to hang out! The ambience and the hospitality is really good. Out of all things in the Menu, Burger is my favourite. It is a must every time I visit the Cafe.
Last time I ordered Crispy Chilli American Corn pepper salt, it was good.Â 
One problem with PP's Vegan is that there is no guarantee that if you were served tasty food today, the food will also taste good in your next visit. The taste and the quality of food keeps changing, I wonder how? This makes me reluctant to recommend it to my friends at once.Â 
Secondly, the service is veerrrryyyy slow. Literally. This has to be improved!Â 
But the staff is well mannered, which I really like.
Otherwise, all good! I'm a regular visitor and will keep visiting. Thanks :)

Located in bangur beside reliance fresh. The cafe has utilised the small place in a very proper way. Well decor nice music. Food is average. We had a baby corn which was good and a cheese garlic bread which was no way close to a garlic bread. A great no to garlic bread in pp.
Must try the dudh cola. Amazing. I guess their is is the dudh cola. One of the best thing there is the behaviour of the owner and the staffs. Very soft spoken and polite.

Well, one fine afternoon I went to this cafe and was amazed to see the interiors and the way it has been utilized.I went upstairs and found it so cosy. Most of the items they dint had and after ordering fried rice and pasta, it came almost after 1 hour with so terrible taste.
They dint serve water as well.
no one was there to hear me out since I choose to sit upstairs.Overall bad experience.
Not visiting it anymore.

A quaint little place having the best space management i have seen in a while, they have managed to accomodate 3 decors in a 1 room space. The dishes r reasonably priced & the ambience is good but its a bit cramped. D service is quite slow but that wasn't much of an issue as d cozy upstairs niche got us too busy chilling out to mind d time taken. We had their 4 cheese pizza , Mexican pizza, corn pizza & the paneer pizza but d sizes were quite small & d bases were ordinary but the topping was fine. We had pav bhajis too but the highlight was d quirky doodh cola. Would visit again 4 d doodh cola & d ambience

The place is really nicely done.. Great use of space.. Superb ambience.. But the food turns it all down.. The cheesy vada pao was extremely dry and had no taste as such.. The brownie with ice cream is pathetic.. The worst brownie I have had.. And who puts sugar syrup on ice cream?? Since the place is so properly done, they should have better food too so that the customers come back.. Else it's all a waste

Had ordered for two combo meals from PP's Vegan. One had Sandwich, Fries and Coke while the other one had Garlic bread, Cheesy Vada Pav, Brownie with ice cream and coke. It took ages for them to prepare the food. That was big turn down.
Coming to the items, all were pretty good. The french fries were great! The vada pav had an unique flavour to it. The sandwiches were large enough to fill an empty stomach. Overall, a really nice, pocket friendly restaurant. The brownies tasted like normal britannia cakes. They can work on that though.

A well-planned and designed cafe that has a small area still does not make you feel congested at all.  Hygienic food and taste is mind blowing. We had vada pav,  garlic breads,  pasta and will try more in days to come.  Courteous staff and professional behavior with excellent presentation of served food.  Overall excellent place but we would suggest them to serve the food a little faster.

The place has been really utilised well...each and every portion.. decor was well done..staff was polite and courteous as well...!! But the main drawback which made me rate it on a lower scale is the service...like we had to wait for almost forty five mins for manchow soup to be served..!! Food was good but the service made us loose our appetite. Secondly if anyone is in hurry...this is not the right place coz u need ample amount of time here.

This is -10 standard Restaurant where you doesn't expect any Hotel standard. Here if you order a Medium Pizza by mistake you will get a Puri size Pizza (4") and you should learn from them that this is standard medium size Pizza. And, every time if you order, you will get Nano/Micro size quantity. And, here may be some of the owners friends are shared very wrong feedback in favour of the Marchant. 

Don't go there to avoid your BP level too much high.

I went to this place in scorching heat with my girlfriend. The ambiance and music were superb. Â we went to cozy upstairs, seating arrangements were good.Out of the 7 Indian main courseÂ items, they had only two items available at the start of the day.

We impatiently waited for almost 50 minutes with empty stomach!!Finally, we called them in case they missed out us( though we were the only customer) and we were then given a pack of Uncle chips to munch!We ate them all at one goo.:P

Finally, our food came and we had okayish Fried rice with too much oil over it!
Aloo dum was too salty and yellow dal was half cooked with pathetic taste...Rotis were also prepared by some novice cook/chef it seemed.

@PPs Veg team:- Kindly improve your service and food quality.

PS:- GO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

We took the italian combo from little app that consisted of garlic bread ,pasta and 2 servings of coke. Garlic bread was cheesy and crispy .We took white and mix sauce pasta both was okayish in taste but quantity was little less.Next we ordered chinesd combo ,it had small portions of chowmein ,manchurian,fried rice ,potato fries ,salad and coke. Everything tasted well but again quantity was very less, not enough for even 1 person. For desert we had gulab jamun .i must say it was the softest gulab jamun i ever had and was piping hot.And we paid rs 500 for all this,so it was quite cheap too.
Ambience and decor was very soothing and the staff was also well behaved.They have 3 different type of seating arrangements ,one is just inside the cafe next one is little inside and third one is upstairs.

White sauce pasta was cheesy as well as creamy..but with no veggies. Interior was very beautiful..Service was good..But;they do need to improve pasta n add some veggies too..
