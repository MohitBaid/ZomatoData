Silver Sand is one of oldest bar in this area, located just opposite to City Center Saltlake. It is not your regular pub experience, but it actually gives you that. No music, dimmly lit at daytime, a seperate smoking room - may make you tag it a bit shady. 

However it does not pich your pockets heavily, and that's why people come here to enjoy drinks with friends peacefully. Yea that's right even if you're a lady you can visit here with your lady friends. 

Coming to the foods, they are tasty and delivered quite fast! Another plus point. Stuffs are courteous too, and service is fast. 

So hanging out with friends next time around Saltlake, keep SS in mind!

we went there with group of friends in a weekend. we found it as we did not got place in other bar & restro in that area in the weekend rush. quite a shady place, near the city center 1, wide range of liquor, food were ok but could have been better. low budget, less to talk about the decoration and ambiance. i will say this is B-graded, as there are lot more to develop.            NB:- we had a bad experience as the service man misbehaved with us without any reason.

But the biriyani and the mutton were not good. Their fish fingers and prawns were also mouth-watering those I have tried in another visit. Pocket friendly price.. quantity is also good and service is also satisfactory.. definitely a good restaurant for chinese lovers..

If you are looking for a descent bar near city centre 1 area  then your search ends here, budget friendly, good food with good service ambience is normal
It's just a bar cum restuarant dont expect fancy lights or a pub its just a descent bar where you can chill out with your frnds or jab khud ka gham khud se share karna ho (after break-up symptoms ab jinko pta hai unko pta hai) this is the best place service is very good I must say during rush hour the service may affect but rest of the time it's all good

1. Pan fried chilly chicken is a must try.
2. Mutton bhuna masala 
3. Masala kulcha 

Rest all the food items are up to the mark, so go and enjoy your visit :-)

Nice place for some quick bites and "add ons". The location of this place is excellent. Spread over a huge area, lots of space, decent food, a separate family section are the pros. But, the cons come through glaringly....and that is the service. The service can be markedly improved cause the attendants are too laid back and seem to be in their own sweet world. The seating arrangements can be made a bit more comfortable. The lighting can be improved. Being located at such a busy and prime location....if they take care of their downsides they will be able to do much better business.

Its a decent place for food and drinks. Good thing that there is a separate family section, which makes it comfortable for everyone.
Food was average - there's nothing that deserves a mention specifically. The service was below average though - no one was really interested in taking down orders or respond to our calls in general.
However, what really ticked us off was how the waiters started behaving after the bill arrived. Since the service was not up to the mark, we decided not to tip them. However, the waiter chased us down the stairs and came down till the exit gate to "beg" for the tip.
One serious suggestion to the management: Please hire some people who can behave professionally, and pay them well so that they don't start behaving like beggars and scare customers away.

Located near the Rabindra okakura bhavan, silver sands is one of the best places to hangout and chill with your friends and colleagues after office time. Cheap booze, enough number of seats to accommodate around 100 people makes it a popular one.

Located just opposite Bata in CC1 it does not put a deep hole in the pocket. Drinks are moderately priced and so is the food. The chicken tandoori is very good and so is dry chili chicken and for main course my preference would be kulcha and  chicken bharta (shredded chicken)

Whenever we friends wanted to go for some pegs with some snacks which is pocket friendly, this name always came first. Though people mainly go here for drinks but the place is not like a typical BAR with smells all around, dark, unprofessional behavior etc. The place is very easily accessible as it's just beside City Centre-I. Employees are very cautious and helpful. The main thing I must add here it's their food. You will get fresh ingredients whenever u order for any dish. I specially like their Fish Fry which they serve with tarter sauce.....it's really wonderful.

This is one of the popular bar cum restaurants in the vicinity. The liquor is easy on the pocket. The ambiance is not much to speak about but it is a good place for friends to meet over. Now the food is a mix of decent and great. The chicken in devil's sauce was not as expected and the garlic chicken again was disappointing. It seems they use too much ketchup in the chinese stuff. But when it comes to the kebabs, well, it rarely gets better than this. The reshmi kebab was outstanding, tender, flavoury, melts in your mouth type. All the kebabs are very good. This I think is one of the better places to hang around in the city

This is a bar cum restaurant located opposite to Bata,city center 1. This was a very frequent place for us during our college days.
Today I visited this place with my school friends after a long time and a lot has changed here. 
The interior have changed drastically and they have also arranged for another floor for family people.
We ordered three beers and one plate of chicken fingers. Chicken fingers had 6 big pieces of chicken served with mayonese.
All of these cost us around 800 Rs which is quite cheap compared to other bar cum restaurants in and around city center.
Their service was very prompt and worth mentioning.

This place is regarded as the oldest bar in Salt Lake and may be one of the oldest in entire Kolkata as well. Silver Sands has been in existence even before City Center-I came up at the place where it is now and it still remains to be an iconic destination for most of us. 

The first time I came here, was probably in the year 2002 or 2003 with a couple of my friends. One needed to climb up to the first floor to enter the bar cum restaurant. The ambiance was almost nil and the restaurant looked shabby. The tables and chairs were divided into 3 columns and multiple rows and then there were a couple of waiters always on their toe to serve the customers. It has been quite some time since I have visited here last. Mostly because I have given up on drinking. So my review and rating is simply based on nostalgic memories.

The prices here were darn cheap! Unless you want to save more by buying an Old Monk for Rs. 47 (I guess that was the price then) or may be a White Mischief at a similar price range, the logical decision would have had been to walk in here. You could easily have had 5-6 large pegs of Vodka or Rum and still be billed with 600-700. The best part was the munchies and the facility to smoke inside which unfortunately is probably no longer available.

The food here was lipsmacking as well. I myself hate chillies but I remember how I used to crave to have a taste of their Spicy Chicken. Trust me, that is one of the best Chicken Starters I have ever had anywhere in my life. I cannot emphasize on their current situation or how they have maintained their quality all these years. But if I had to visit there one more time, I probably would, for the sake of the old sweet memories. :-)

As the other expert reviewers have mentioned, I also true that!! We have been a frequent visitor to this place since my college days because of this reason only - cheap in cost!! Lady foodies might find the place very shabby and dirty however, I would like to tell them that there are innumerable restaurants and bar in kolkata where environment, food, staffs behaviour everything deserve a >4 rating for sure....so Pls exempt this kinda few places from having your footsteps as all the people might not have the affordability to bear the huge expenses of "Chilis" or "Hyatt"..Think about the college folks or the person who earns only 20k in a month but has the full right to drop in this places to have few drinks with a starter and have fun with friends!!

Bahut gyaan ho gaya!!

It's an good place predominantly for a group of boys, probably they don't allow smoking inside anymore. But trust me, having 3 beers or 4 peg of whiskey - roaming around in CC1 is amaizing! Try that!!

Okay I went there 3 times. Twice with my friends for having only a few drinks and some starters. And of late on 31st night for having dinner. The ambience is very comfortable. Though the exterior of the restaurant doesn't make it very prominent but the interiors are better. This is a good place to hang out with friends while sipping on to the vodka shots. The staffs are quite friendly and the food is okay. I like their fish & chips that is served with white sauce. All in all a nice hangout zone with affordable prices.

A pocket friendly place in saltlkake to have booze and has a lot of space to accommodate large groups. The food is also reasonable and tasty and has the normal indian and chinese dishes to offer. However,one should definitely try the baked fish here. Ambience is not so great but the staff is swift and co-operative. Overall a nice hangout joint without hurting the pocket much.

Well I will give an honest assessment of Silver sand. I go there often.This is one of the cheapest bar & restaurant you will find in salt lake city centre area. Just like Opium Half of my College life I also spent here. Drinks are cheap. The food is good as long as you know what to order and the right person happens to be in the kitchen. I recommend their fish fingers & Chilly garlic pepper chicken and for vegetarian's you can try their Aloo Tikia. 
But there again the kitchen is not great.I found they overcook many dishes.90 percent of the staff are great.Some of them are rude and will act as if he is doing a favour to pour you a Beer.This place would be awesome if they could get the fundamentals down. Good service and consistency are a must in a restaurant. Unfortunately here you never know what you are going to get. When this place is good it is great. When it is bad,it is really bad. Hopefully the management cares enough to get this on track.

I wouldn't rate it because pf the epitome of  all charateristics a restaurant should have! But because it has always been there for me and my friends whenever need be!!

Its the most pocket friendly restaurant I have seen. And that does not mean that there is any compromise with the quality of food or the crowd, or even the ambiance! The place is equally comfortable for a family and a group of students, and even people of all ages..

Dimly lit, TVs playing likeable stuff, a swift staff - all in all its worth a good 5.0 rating.

A place with mid level comfort, but reasonable price tag. Food quality is good as well as the service. Lower tier a bit clumsy, Upper floor is better. An old bar cum restro in Salt Lake area,  so crowd is always there. Specially the young couples. Seating arrangements can be realigned to accommodate more people.

This place is practically second home to me ;) This has been our hangout place for 6 years now. Rightly dubbed as 'Oly Pub' of Saltlake. The cheapest place to booze in Saltlake. It has very basic interiors. Basically a place where you'd like to hangout with friends. Main course is not too good. Try their starters, they are awesome. Personal favourite  - Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken,  Chicken Cutlet and Fish finger. I'm not the best person to rate their service, cause being a regular here for six years, we get excellent service every time, better than many other star places :D.

Silver Sand is the Olypup of Salt Lake. Being an old place in the area, it offers drinks at a reasonable price and is a good place for hanging out with your friends. They serve nice snacks for the drinks and the ambiance has nothing much to it.

People mostly go for drinks on minds. Food is not that great here.

Worst possible behaviour I've had from any restaurant staff. Went there yesterday evening, and we we're a bit early at 6.30 pm when they had just began service. Since it was Shivratri, there was no crowd at all. We were pretty much the only customers till 11 pm. So the waiters couldn't have misplaced our orders, right? But they did so with the manager as well. We were charged extra for an item and they refused to admit that we were right. One of the waiters was beyond impolite, I don't know if he's normally so or yesterday was a bad day for him. 
The manager argued hard with us and at the end asked us to get the hell out of his establishment. I have a very firm mind to lodge a complaint in the Consumer's Court against him, Apurba Mukherjee. 
The liqour is cheap, food is okay, service is also usual. But if you can survive the wrath of the staff, you'll have a good time. They hate their customers.

Its one of the best destinations when you are running out of budget. If interiors are given a facelift, with the food quality and location they have, they can easily put copper chimney and kaafila in competition. In 2000, 4 people can easily have dinner with sufficient liquor. So highly recommended!!

This place is what you call a watering hole. Located at a prime location just off City Centre 1, bang on opposite of the Bata, it provides a much cheaper drinking option than other places nearby.
The whole building houses the bar. The first floor is generally for stag guests while the 3rd and 5th floor are for family. 4th floor is the kitchen. The bar is on the first floor. 
Service is very good. Waiters are attentive and very cordial. 
Alcohol is pretty cheap here and most of the time they have some kind of promotional offers going on on certain brands. 
Food is decent without being mindblowing. I would suggest chinese starters and kababs. The continental fare is not at all upto the mark. Dragon Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Reshmi Kabab, Sauteed prawn with green peas are good starter option. In the mains, I was actually enticed by their Chicken Reshmi Makkhanwala. Its really tasty.
The cost for two people without alcohol will not be ₹ 450 as mentioned in the info. Rather it will be around ₹ 600-700. With alcohol it will be approx. ₹ 1200.
If you are not hell bent on ambience, not fussy about food taste and want to have a drink or two at reasonable price in thw middle of saltlake, then this is definitely a good place to go.

Most of the stars in my review are due to the fact that Silver Sands has a fantastic family section where the waiters don't bat an eyelid when two girls waltz in and ask for vodka. Rather they quickly bring over all we asked for and we proceeded to make our own vodka laced nimbu masala soda - which is such a phenomenal drink. 

We ordered their crispy chilli baby corn because I didn't feel like anything meaty (I'd been having a fish overload till then). The baby corn was lovely - spicy, crunchy, crispy - if you'd eat any in-authentic Chinese food - let this be it. The perfect fusion of Indian and Chinese. 

This is exactly the sort of watering hole every city should have  - cheap drinks, nice bar menu and a fun relaxed atmosphere - what's not to love?

I have visited this place more than 25-30 times in last few years. the inside is quite ok, rather family section is better, stuffs are also fine. they have a good collection of liquors ( won't say too much huge collection, but good for normal days). the best is their rate is not so high, and as consequence it becomes tough to get seats in weekends. its location ( just opposite CC1) is also a reason for that.

regarding food, i have tried chicken tandoori, chicken tikka kabab, fish finger, chilly/schezwan/garlic chicken, fried rice and chowmin and lots of other dishes. the best is obviously the fish finger, a must try. they cut the tandoori into multiple pieces so that it goes better with the liquor. their chinese main courses like fried rice, chowmin and other sidedishes are quite fine. so, as a whole i would say this place is primarily a bar with a supporting restaurant...

Silver sands gas never failed to disappoint when it comes to catching up with old buddies over a glass of beer. I decided to write a review today paying due respect to the place that has been our first and last resort whenever we decided to have a drink near cc. We initially started with 2 bottles of tuborg strong, but i shall move towards the menu. For a change i decoded to order something apart from their chilli chicken and went in for their chilli garlic pepper chicken. To be honest , this dish will never dissapoint and might be one of my favourites at this place. Properly cooked and utterly crispy, the chicken blended well with the beer. We went on to order the devils chicken which was recommended by the waiters. I somehow found something lacking n it, or probably it was just too spicy. Nonetheless, it was not a bad choice and was edible enough, though i would not recommend to eat it dry( it might taste well with schezwan hakka noodles). The best part of the place is the view over seeing city centre from the 2nd floor family section of the bar and is a must for someone moderate in cash and wanting to spend a good time with friends.

Its been more than 13-14 years that we have been visiting this place. One of the oldest bar cum restaurants in Salt Lake this place serves alcohol at a very reasonable rate. The food served is equally tasty and comes with a good rate. I love their Fish Fry and pakoras. These two items are a must everytime i visit this place. The ambiance is average but the service is excellent. If you want a frugal yet good evening then this place is a good option to visit.

This is a place which runs heavily on the nostalgia/adda/small -medium restaurant enterprise culture that thrives in Kolkata.

Situated bang opposite to CC in Salt Lake and beside the Petrol Pump,this is not only a hotspot for IT and college people - but even middle aged old timers as well.

The food and drinks are cheap but one must say this - this place is strictly sort of a boys hangout kind of a place , much like Opium in Sector V - going there with your GF is not the best of ideas!

This is a horrible place to go and drink. I absolutely detest the bar although I have had to visit this place about three times with friends from school. The interiors are bad, it is dark and the food is simply not good. It is almost always crowded and I do not see the point of waiting in line to visit a place that is so horrible. You may say that the drinks are cheap here but I can bet that you will ended more depressed after having drinks at this place than before. Do not go if you want a classy bar/pub experience is all I can say. BUt if you are down on cash, need to drink and are in Salt Lake, there is no better place to visit!



----- 02 Jan, 2014 -----

This is a pathetic bar and I completely hate the place. I have been there a few times with friends from school and never have I liked the experience. The ambience is very bad with dark interiors and the smell of booze all around. The smoking room if course feels like a chimney (but hey is that not the case everywhere?) The food is also not good. You should only go to this place if you are down and out and want to shoot yourself after excessive drinking because the atmosphere is plain depressing. Oh and on weekends you might have to wait in line because it is very very crowded.

This is just wasting your time. The environment is horrible. the service is bad. Food is very very average. I just wasted my friday night. But the price of the drink is little less. So never come here if you want to enjoy your time. If you want to booze only with your friend then you can come here. But if you want to ask for my opinion.. I will never come here again. A dhaba on the highway is 100 times better that that.
