Kolkata has now many rooftop restaurants it was my 1st visit to Noir have almost tried every rooftop restaurants in city of joy the ambience and food is great you will love the music here and this is the best season to be here.
Annayna makes sure you get the best service she really means business in hospitality industry.
Hookahs are pretty decent only thing missing here is liquor once they get their licence this place will be a hot cake in salt lake.

Great place to hangout, with an active jacuzzi to dip your leg and sit. The place is generally empty, with a great view, being on the terrace. 
The service is somewhat okay, while the shisha and the food on the better side, the Afghani platter is a must, and the sharp shark a must. Other dishes you might want to try.

We ordered bbq pizza along with hookah which was pretty good. The ambience is perfect for couples. You'll get to see a good view. We also ordered kebabs and it was so so.  If you're looking for a place where you want to enjoy a good view and hangout with friends, you can definitely give it a try.

The sky bar is in 8th floor in golden tulip building.
The ambiance of the sky bar was good but not in occational days because there is too much crowd gathering at a time and the food or other service will be delaying for a while. This place was good for hukka and there is a pool there with quite hot water. I was there in 31st so i cant taste the food.
One thing here the service was not good.

Noir Skybar, the place that made my Dashami evening special. Got to hear from an acquaintance, and decided to give it a try. A nice rooftop restaurant located at the seventh floor of Hotel Golden Tulip. The view from there is breathtaking and perfect to spend hours with your loved ones.

Drinks: 
Tried Green Apple Colada & Sharp Shark.
Green Apple Colada tasted decent. Although Sharp Shark was spicier than required, had a discussion about it with the Manager, who‚Äôs a nice guy and promised to keep it in mind.

Food:
Tried Barbeque Chicken Pizza, and was really amazed by the taste. The chicken cubes were well baked along with the cheese dripping all over. The crust wasn‚Äôt crunchier than needed. In a word it was perfect.

Sheesha:
Tried Teen Paan Candy, it was upto the mark.

Price is a bit on the higher side, but affordable.
Bill came around ‚Çπ1300/- for two including dual coal change.
Recommended.

I live the jacuzzi area!! Good music, good ambiance, rooftop, perfect for chilling! The hookah we ordered was bad! Plus the waiter insisted that we had ordered  a for the same flavor while we hadn't. coffee was horrible!! I wonder how can one serve such a coffee at a "cafe/lounge". We ordered a Pasta and Crispy Babycorns, the food was fine! Nothing extra ordinary, but nice in general! The service is too slow, but nice! We wanted to use a combo offer on the internet but had some issue in ordering the coupon, they customised a special combo for us which is worth commending..

Located at the top floor of Golden Tulip. They have revamped Thrillophillia into this open air restaurant. This place scores with it's ambience. Jacuzzi, Live music and open air - almost perfect combination. Food and cocktails are average, Hookah is nice.
My pick for this place is Kiwi rasna in hookah and Chicken Tikka.

We went to this place on Sunday Evening.It's located on the 8th floor of the Hotel Golden Tulip Salt-lake. Found this place very attractive because of its Rooftop setup and the presence of Jacuzzi whirlpool tub.Sit around the tub or put your legs into it ,keep aside Hookah and enjoy.They will be playing music all the time to uplift your mood.This place gives a outlook of the city from its rooftop. Apart from these two things if you consider food menu and service,this place is no more different from other cafes.
¬†Had Teen pan and Supari gum Shisha. Ordered 12 inches Hawaiian and Exotic veg pizzas.They were decorated very well with rich toppings but taste was average.
Service was kinda slow.
Liquor is not available here..!!!! :-(

Noir, Sector 1, Salt Lake City. A Totally amazing place to go out with friends and have fun. The cafe is located on the open terrace with a swimming pool giving it an extra attraction and grabs the attention of the teenagers. So, you can have sisha near the pool with your legs in the swimming pool. Music playlist is good. Pretty Expensive place until and unless you go for combo. To have a totally different experience of having sisha in the open air at the 8th floor viewing the city and your legs in the pool will make your rest day spend well.

Hookah is not at all nice. The place is too dark. Soo dark that we cannot see the menu it self. The place needs improvement. Too much improvement.

Wanted to go to this place from a long time. Finally went yesterday with my buddies.. ! It can be eaaily located as it is on the rooftop of GoldenTulip hotel. 
Pros:- 
1.Breathtaking view of the city and very awesome jacuzzi (only hookah and drinks can be served there)
2.Nice combo offers. 
3.Babycorn and paneer tikka are damn tasty.

Cons:-
1.Didn't quite like the pasta over here. I would not recommend it to try. 
2.Service is bit on the slower side.

But overall a terrific place and i will be visiting it again surely. ! üòÉ

Dumplings are a fascinating form of art if you consider the craftsmanship that goes into making them. The dumpling usually consists of a veg or a non-vegetarian filling that is wrapped around thin and small pieces of dough. The dough is then steamed or fried according to the needs of the customer/ foodie. The origin of dumplings can be traced back to around 225 AD and its use can be found in Asian, American and African¬†cuisines. When you‚Äôre battling a cold that is untameable, soup with dumpling can be your best companion, in terms of food. India has an amazing connection with dumplings. They were mostly introduced by the northeastern belt of India that has been exposed to more of the Asian influence. There are more than thirty types of Dumplings that are consumed by people all over the world, but the one dumpling that has caught everyone‚Äôs attention is MoMos.¬†People are so crazy about it that, you can find almost every street side corner having its own momo corner. People actually had a legitimate discussion over various social media platforms when the government decided to ban momos, such as the pathos. ¬†Such is the craze for dumplings. Thank God that the government didn‚Äôt go forward with the banishment of momo plan‚Ä¶ and humanity was saved!‚Ä¶ (just kidding)

We went on a soothing Sunday afternoon, it's an open place with a Jacuzzi(which they say was under-represented maintenance and was also dirty), various style of seating options.
Having less options for vegetarians we ordered -
Crispy chilly babycorn - which was not served hot/warm initially on request the same was served again microwaved which made it soggy.
Cheese balls - were okish.
Mixed sauce pasta - was the only dish we liked.
Quantity of the food was good but since the overall experience of quality was below average quantity wouldn't be acknowledgable.
But the place is good for its view and to click pictures.
The staff were friendly.

I have added three stars just for the atmosphere and the guy who was there for the live show, what an amazing voice he has. It is situated top of a luxurious hotel. Decoration, lights, atmosphere are on point. But the food quality disappointed us. We had teen Paan flavored shisha, in the first coal it started to choak. They don't even change the coal for the first place within the amount (high as per the flavor quality) , you have to pay for that, which is not at all applicable in other hookah corners. Beside that we had kit Kat shake, oreo shake, blue lagoon, crispy chili baby corn.. Except the kit Kat shake nothing were taste worthy.. Staffs were good.. This restro is highly need to gear up their management system and to change their cook asap..

This page which is on the top floor of GOLDEN TULIP HOTEL near city centre 1 is a great hangout place. The ambience is nice as it's a rooftop cafe along with small pool of water. The food and service however sucks. We were provided with cold drinks that was 80% water and to replace it they took more than an hour. The food is not at all value for money. Overall if you want to enjoy the weather then you can visit it but not for food.

Firstly the pathetic Service received ever and they call themselves the part of 5 star hotel. After Ordering it took 20-25 mins to service the food, and then I personally have never seen a 5 star hotel serving water in a plastic Glass and that too was smelling to bad, and therefore thought of ordering mineral water which was charged 5 times the MRP and then GST added over it ( where additional tax cannot be charged over MRP). Secondly the behaviour of the manager *SAUMITRA* was very rude and unfriendly. Instead of behaving politely he was harsh and unwelcoming. I will neither visit this place myself and nor advise people to visit this particular place again.. Truly a very bad experience..

Order as soon as possible u appear at the place, as they serves bit late. Jacuzzi was not working at the time i was there, need to clean and maintain ur jacuzzi or else kindly close that part. Food was not bad . Shisha was ok. But main attraction is the view and ambiance at the evening. Try to visit it on any cloudy day or night, then only u can enjoy this place.

The staff seemed completely lost. We actually had to ask for the food as everytime we were getting half the food in the menu. The mud cake was served w/o the icecream. It was only when we reminded them that there is suppose to be an icecream that we got one. Extremely loud music so much so that they were unable to hear the orders.
 As a professional I found it extremely unfriendly to sit with my colleague and talk.

I loved this place, you can find this place on top of Golden Tulip, the hotel itself is well maintained and have classy crowd, Staff there is very cordial , best place for romantic date as well as we celebrated my friend birthday there, staff were very genours to help with all decoration as well as help us in all possible way to make the day more special , The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We highly recommend it. Best thing about this place was its Jacuzzi which make it stand out from all other restaurants, we sat their with our hookah and lighting was even perfect , we love the moment we spend there¬†
Thanks to Noir Team

Situated on top floor (8th) of the so called 4 star hotel Golden Tulip. From which angle? :-/ we went to The Noir. Water was dripping continuously from the ceiling directly on the table. Before visiting this place I went through all the reviews and most of the people complained about this problem and still this wasn't fixed so this proves that the management is lazy enough. Tables were dirty. Plastic fibre glasses had too much of scratches on it. The staffs were pretty confused. The lady staff was in so hurry that she dropped the spoon on the floor :'-/ why you do this to me?!

Food is okay ish you cant rate it to be best. We ordered veg mixed spice pasta (filled with whole black pepper which spoiled my mood), crispy chili babycorn (was the only thing to be happy about), virgin mohito and blue lagoon (don't try pls as it had more ice than actual syrup)...
We also ordered for a hookah. They have approx 5 to 6 flavours on menu to offer... hood ones but too expensive. The staff looks lost at times. Cost is expensive üòàu can burn ur pocket but not here atleast.

Hence, Dont think of trying once. They need good food maker, music choice to be changed and Management to be geared up. This place is a big time disappointment never ever plan of going there ... never judge a book by its cover ... photos show something the place is actually a disappointment.
The jacuzzi was non operational and was filled with dirt. What a waste!
Trust me, places like The Vault, Pied piper's cafe, xrong place, etc are much better in terms of ambience, value for money, service, location etc.

Average ambiance. Cooperative Staff. Horrible Pasta. Below average food. Not too much to choose from.
However, cheese garlic bread and gratin were pretty good in comparison to the entire menu.

The staff is quite unprofessional. The only part interesting is the jacuzzi at the terrace which is quite small, very costly. If anyone wants to check out, then they can. But I had the worst experience ever. Not going out there again

A rooftop cafe in the Salt Lake City.
Loved the ambiance of this cafe
Jacuzzi area is pretty cool as you can hold on your shisha and mocktail and have the view of the whole salt lake.
Services were pretty disappointing.

Awesome place a must visit for friends grp as well as romantic couples
Only hookah and beverages r allowed in Jacuzzi pool area food will b served at table only (good as this will keep the pool area cleaner)
Food n drink variety is less compare to other restaurants (non veg option r just few)
Service Too too slow it took almost 1 hr for them to serve 1 hookah n 2 thumbs up ppl sitting beside me didn't even got menu for an hr and almost after 20 25 times saying they got just thumbs up
Plz make ur service better else ppl will sit in pool for an hr n will leave without ordering anything lik I saw 2 Grps doing it today
PS this is not a place for foodies this is for all those who just need to spend time relax and enjoy the 8th floor open sky n rooftop ambience
I will sure visit it again but plz improve the items n service sppl n Ya out of 2 last Jacuzzi was not working in full speed plz maintain the pool at that is only attraction for us to come
A bit heavier on pocket but with time n ambience it's worth it

A very bad experience at the restaurant due to extremely poor service and no proper lookout for the customers. The only good thing there is the jacuzzi.. One can go there to have a foot spa that's it. Service is very slow. They dnt check the orders and add items in the bill that were ordered but not served. Later on the pretty lady at the reception stopped us to knw if we gave paid the bill. Utter miscommunication among the staffs. Plz coordinate and let your guests feel at home.  I gave 2 only for the foot spa.

I really love this place. Been many times. Its on terrace n full open. U can dip ur legs in water n sit. The drink shark is really good n margaritta is amazing. There is everyday live music. The interior ambiance is amazing. The only thing i dint like is that service is very bad. But still the best place in salt lake leaving sector 5 area. Very different. In sakt lake u dont have such place. It only bcoz of service im rating it low.

The ambience does the talking here. The view is amazing! The place plays soothing music. You can enjoy your meal with your loved ones peacefully and relax while the well mannered staff serves you delightfully! The food is a bit on the average side but isn't much of a disappointment! 
The hookah served is good! 
Overall experience was good but the food can be made better!

This is a rooftop cafe in The Golden Tulip Hotel which is five minutes away from City Centre 1. The ambience of this place is amazing. They have live music everyday and a pool where people can dip their feet. The food was nice but nothing great. They could expand their menu. The waiters weren't well trained. Though courteous, they seemed a bit confused. The place was dimly lit. Maybe they could add more lights  and it would be nice if they could place a mat for people to wipe their feet after using the pool. Having said all this, I feel that this place is really different from the usual cafes and restaurants in Kolkata and I would love to visit this place again!
