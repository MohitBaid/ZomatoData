exorbitantly priced,costed 945rs for a plate of rice,fish curry and four cold drink cans.Food tastes below average,very poor quantity plus half the items on the menu are unavailable.Spacious place with nice decor but that's about it.Visit only if no other option is left which is hardly the case in and around airport.Did not even feel like clicking pictures of the food because its just not worth it.

Food is way too costly and doesnt worth your money. Charged Rs. 90 per bottle water even after court order not to charge more money over MRP. Hotel staff were courteous but thats not the only thing people visit a restaurant. Biriyani tasted like Rs. 100.

Today before @ 2 pm to 3.45 pm i visit 9 players as i have a hoping flight. I take lunch for my colleges and for mine also. Bill value was 650 rs.. But in the mean time i attain one candidate who is a final candidate for my company as well. As because of final conversation with the participants i call him in kolkata airport 9 players hotel &  bar. As i was today with our company vice president and we are a company like alkem laboratory pharma company we have a great value with our head office person and specially with vice president as well. But the authorities mainly two waiter insult direct to our vp and told him to finish our food ASAP and get out of restaurants and talk with the particular participants. I felt very guilty with this nuisance in kolkata specific in this hotel. I think authority should re think the issue and take necessary steps for this particular matter. Hope no body should faced same problems in anywhere. 
Bad behaviour staffs and no such system is there for nurture clients and guests

This restaurant's located at Dum Dum airport, welcoming visitors or those leaving to grab some quick meal. 
A friend treated two of us friends to a tasty lunch here prior to Pujo. We lunched on cheese pakoda, chicken Schezwan noodles, garlic chicken, and strawberry ice cream. The ice cream was tasteful, as were the chicken and pakode. The noodles were spicy and could have been made better tastewise. 
Overall a good place to indulge in a hearty meal.

Been there twice. Never encountered anything negative. Beautiful inside and outside. Doesn't feel like typical Kolkata bar. Watchman at the gate will take care of your luggage with a courteous smile. Location of this place really helps travellers. A beer with folks before saying goodbye or an hour with chilled beer after landing, both purpose served. Stuffs are very much time bound. We got in there at 10:55 still they refused to serve us alcohol once, just because alcohol is supposed to be served not earlier than 11 a.m. i appreciate timelines.
Well, keeping it small. Not much photos taken. Happening place. But isn't flawless. Really slow service and limited stuffs. This place can be handled way better if managed properly.

Horrible service. Rude staff. Slow service. Overpriced.
The only saving grace would be their¬†collection of alcohol and location, given the paucity of options available for travellers.
Food stalls and cafes inside the terminal are a better option than this.

Only place in proximity of CCU airport where you get food round the clock at reasonable rate compared to other restaurants. The service is good and the place is well managed. Although its a bar cum restaurant, you can head there with family members. Food wise the quality is average. But again, it will be the life saviour for people who halts overnight.

This place is at arrival gate number 3. The place seems shady from the outside but it is a good decent place from inside. 
I ordered beer and peanut masala and French fries. 

Buy 2 get 1 offer on beer.
Peanut masala is yummilicious - 5/5
French fries - ok ok 2.5/5

The se unity guard takes your luggage and keeps it outside and gives you a token.

If you have a connecting flight- you can chill out here..!! Don't look out for Park Street if you are past 11:30 pm.. travelling will suck up money and will even result into nothing!!

Located outside the airport hence i had huge expectations from the place. It was not up the the mark in terms of food, service as well as payment!
They did not accept many cards and also service was slow and poor!

The place is well decorated but lacks the coordination. We had to wait quiet a while to place our order inspite there being very few people in the resturant. The food was comparatively better. We ordered chicken tikka which was above par. Over all a bit over priced

Worst place ever. Food looks like diarrhea and must taste like it too (didn't order only saw others eat theirs). Went there only for drinks and was surprised to see how filthy the management was. They wouldn't allow a woman access to the restroom until she bought something. She was obviously in discomfort but the cheap management has no basic decency. The manager fought with me when I asked him why they removed and threw away my unfinished beer while I stepped out for a smoke. They abused me and told me that they will call the police. The bartender agreed that it was their fault and even told me that he will try to give me something on the side. Very expensive and the pathetic staff and the illiterate, rude manager should be working at a chowmein stall. Never going again and you shouldn't either. Places like these shouldn't be allowed at the airport because they give a bad name to Calcutta.

Had been to this restaurant today for lunch and drinks as I had 4 hours before I could board my flight. Had 2 beer pints, chilli chicken and chicken hakka noodles. Chicken chilli even when asked to make it dry, waiter came with gravy chicken chilli saying sorry sir, chef made it semi-gravy, that too even after 15 minutes of waiting. I didn't wanted to wait that long again so accepted whatever he served. 
After finishing beer, I ordered for noodles which took another 15-20 minutes, every 5 minutes waiter used to come up and ask for couple of minutes more. Still accepted. Finally the noodles came, taste ok ok kind. Surely might not recommend it to someone else at least not for food what I ate.
Bit expensive, but that is okay considering its location but definitely NOT WORTH!!

This joint is located at Calcutta airport opposite arrivals gate of the new terminal.It is a decent place with both indoor and outside seating. Obviously the indoor seating is in air conditioned splendor and thus more expensive. Here they even serve alcoholic drinks which is quite a pleasant surprise. Food choices are limited and extremely high priced.( But considering the location it's understandable). The outside non AC seating is basically a snack bar. Here tea and coffee are quite reasonably priced. There are a variety of snacks options too. Items available included rolls,patties, sandwiches, fruit cake, cold drinks etc. Good place to sit with snacks and either tea or coffee while waiting for the arrival of some one flying in to Kolkata.

Quite over-priced. We had our worst biriyani here at quite high a price.
Very rude staff who don't know how to take orders but can misbehave with patrons.
But the worst part is it has no washroom for female and transgender patrons. When the ladies accompanying us told us that there is only a wash basin and a urinal for males I couldn't believe my own ears! When asked the staff nonchalantly told that the ladies could use the pay and use toilet next door. Such response left us dumbstruck. How could such an over-priced eatery at an international airport run without proper toilet for its clientele? This is in blatant violation of gender equity and is discriminatory to all non-male individuals.
