I tried it for 2 or 3 times inspite of being dissapointed by its service everytime. We had chicken chowmin and chilli chicken the first time. The quantity was good but the taste was horribly bad. We asked them not to made the chowmin spicy, inspite of that we found that chicken chowmin was extremely spicy. I coudn't ate even half the plate.
Next time it was Durga puja, I had basmati rice and chicken kasa. The rice was normal like what are made in home. Chicken kasa was not at all good. The pieces were full of bone. My father had chicken rice thali and that was the only thing i found edible there. This combo can be a decent food for people who eat outside daily and wants to have something better than regular food. 
The third time we had egg chicken roll which was okayish and not worth the price. The roadside stalls serve better food.
Coming to the service the waiters are extremely unprofessional and rude. They will never bother whether you are calling them or not. They will serve water and clean tables only upon asking. It is definately not a place for casual dining. It can be put in the catagory of Quick Bites.

Food was tasty - quantity wise sufficient- however had to give up the meal halfway, finding a large Spider in the Curry !!! 

I didn't find the owner bothered at all - and he charged for the full meal !!! üò§

Regale is an old eatery located at Kalighat which tasty dishes at a cheap price . Quantity of food is sufficient .

Ambience is ok with quick delivery.

Tried chicken chowmein and chilly chicken. Both had sufficient quantity and were tasty. 

Overall a good place.

A decent, small, pocket friendly, clean eatery serving fast food and Chinese dishes. The food is tasty and moves fast, so it is freshly prepared. There are no nice restaurants nearby and this is the best and most popular place out there for digging in alone or with friends when you are hungry in that Area.

A very old place. Much known for the fries and kathi rolls, I have had the Chicken Kabiraji once and once the Fish Fry. Both of them were pretty decent and tasty enough to give a happy kinda review.

I tried this place while scouting for some pocket friendly eateries. This place is calm, small and sweet. The service is bit slow but the items are in good quantity with respect to the cost. Also the taste of some items are really great. Especially Dal tarka is best of kolkata. Best for people who want to regularly eat outside. Like all other places in kolkata this place also closes at 9:30 PM.¬†
fish fingers are must try. We can tell the cook of the spicyness in food. Purely customisable in aspects of spices.
