A fairly new place, this small ice cream parlour is located near South City mall (along the same line as Domino's and French Loaf). The inside is not too huge, and for sitting arrangements they have a bench for about 3 people.

The place is getting the fame for it's desserts, serving various flavors of¬† ice cream and I'm a fan of their ice cream rolls in particular.

The rolls costed Rs.90 and a 20 for extras.

And while at it do try out the Brownie from here too. That'll be my favorite from here, served hot with a scoop of ice cream on the top, it melts in your mouth and tasted absolutely fantastic.

And if you wanna quench your thirst they have various beverages available too, as well as light snacks enough for a breakfast. 

For what you're getting I thought the price was okay, and the staff made sure we enjoyed our time there. So overall I'd say a good start for a new place and I'd defiantly recommend the place if you're craving something sweet.

Situated nearby I‚Äôm a regular to Ice Spice where Nutty Overload in butterscotch or chocolate, paan flavour ice cream and Nolen Gurer ice cream have become a regullar favourite.They also serve Rolled Ice creams in which Choco Lust and fried ice cream is a weekend affair for more than a month now.The staffs are friendly and they are open till 1am. So, whenever there‚Äôs a sweet craving I know where to head.

They have a variety of options, ranging from ice cream rolls to fried ice cream. 

I tried their Nutella and Banana Ice cream roll. It costed 120 INR. 

The cost is absolutely justified as the amount of ice cream is generous and they give a lot of toppings. They make the ice cream rolls right in front of you from scratch so you get to see the entire process as well.

New kid in town. Fresh review from fresh visit, visited this place twice and worth a good review. This new ice cream parlour offers some refreshing natural flavours of ice creams. With the growing trend of ice cream rolls they too serve the same, other than rolls one can choose for normal scoop of ice cream too. Service, ambience and quality everything deserves satisfactory points from my end. 

Now coming to the heavenly flavours which we tried; Meetha Paan and Fried Ice Cream. The Meetha Paan tasted perfect which came topped with Gulkand ; one can feel the crushed betel leaves with the flavours of paan. The fried ice cream was a scoop of vanilla ice cream coated with bread crumbs and deep fried, crunchy outside and melting inside, topped with dry fruits, one can give a try to this for sure. 

Pocket pinch is certainly reasonable compared to other ice cream parlours in the city

Best of luck Team Ice Spice, looking forward to visit again !

Ice Spice is another food parlour situated in Prince Anwar Shah Road. It is a very small ice cream parlour just beside Dominos. 

The day i visited Ice Spice it was around 12 am and i asked the owner how long it ll stay open so he said till 1am. Anyway the shop is a very small so too many people cannot get to stand inside the shop. Though there are seating arrangements made. Its fully air conditioned with bright lights. There is an led screen where it was showing the making of various types of icecream rolls. Above that screen one would find the menu chart. 

The staff is really very polite and they are very suggestive. They listen to what you have to say with great patience and they make the icecream with great care. They also were explaining how they make it when asked.

The items are quite affordable...But i was unable to try the fried icecream as they had stopped making it for the day... So i tried Fererro Rocher one and normal Nolen Gur icecream .

The icecream roll costed me 120rs and the nolen gur one was 60rs per scoop. So it was very affordable 

Now coming to the taste....
1) Ferrero Rocher one was very very tasty.
    First they poured some milk then a good amount of nutella then one ferrero rocher and he started beating and mixing all of them up untill and unless it becomes a fine mixture...then he sprinkled chocolate chips and other toppings...and lastly he served it with chocolate sticks and an oreo biscuit.

2) Nolen gur ice cream was not up to the mark. I personally didn't like it. After having the icecream role  that didn't taste up to the mark. Maybe the other flavors were good.

Anyway overall i would say that Ice Spice is a good option for those having less budgets and it stays open till 1am so anybody who needs icecream at late night can hop in there... 

Thank you...üòÑ

A small place serving natural flavored ice creams, ice cream rolls and even sandwiches. I tried the Pan flavored ice cream and my friend had choco-brownie. A small cup costs 60 bucks. Both ice creams tasted great. I found tiny pieces of real pan leaf in my ice cream. Overall a good place to satiate your sweet tooth.

Ordered Vanilla and chocolate ice cream rolls and i don't know why both of them tasted sour. So taste wise it was horrible. The employees of the shop were blasting loud music. That loudness in such a small shop creates a horrible atmosphere. Also the decor is tacky.

New addition to the city's ever growing ice cream parlor list. It's located near french loaf in Prince Anwar Shah road, walking distance from south city mall.  Tried brownies n icecream once. It was so so. Brownie was to hard.

Keeping up with the current trend of Ice Cream Rolls, yet another shop pops up in the city serving the same. 
This shop is on Prince Anwar Shah Road, just before the South City Petrol Pump. (Parking can be a problem!) The sign board is hard to miss. A tiny cubicle turned into a ice cream churning dream. 
We had ordered : 
Pan Roll Icecream - Which was delicious and the gulkand added perfection. 
The Dried Fruit Roll Icecream: Tiny bits of cashew, hazlenut, etc chopped and mixed into the roll! So it had chewy bits in the icecream which I loved.
There is an inauguration offer, Buy 2 Get 3..which is slightly confusing and only available on roll ice creams. 
The Free Nutella Banana Ice cream roll had a big dollop of nutella.. if you like that stuff. 

The Kulfi was average. Not per my liking. 

The servers were a bit confused about the menu and ingredigents which I assume will be fixed soon.. But they were the friendliest and most accommodating servers. They kept the shop open even though it was past the closing time and kept our requests of extra toppings, and didn't rush us once.

And guess what..3 Roll Ice creams + Kulfi + A.C. ice cream stall+ 1 am in the morning  for RS 230. (Though we had the offer)

Will I visit again? Yes. 
Value For Money ? Yes
Do I recommend ? YES!!!

This shop! Horrible experience. I would probably remove this experience from my life if i gt a chance someday.
First of all there is written 'buy 2 and get 3' which means you have to pay for 2 if you buy 5. But they claimed it was 'buy 2 and get 1' offer when we proceed to pay. Didn't get it anyhow.
Then they claimed you can only avail the offer if only you order the expensive ones from the menu even though there was no terms and conditions! Not only that they denied to give us owr free ones. We have bought 4 ice-creams. That means we were supposed to get 2 free. But they told we can only get one free!
The attendant was more than worst in behaviour. He claimed that he has given us extra rolls when the amount of cream was fixed. Though when I tell this he said sorry to me for this claiming. The worst and epic incident happened when I ordered a 'Fruit Ferraro Rocher' ice cream. And I noticed that he didn't give any of fruits to the ice-cream and after asking he said that there is fruits in the Ferraro Rocher'! Like really? My whole life is a lie then!
Then we ordered 'brownie with vanilla ice cream'. And along with us someone else had order the same. We get only 1/4 of the brownie while the other person got 3/4 of the brownie!
To visit this shop was the worst decision ever. Don't@@ waste your time and money for this.
I would have gve them -100 if I had a chance.
