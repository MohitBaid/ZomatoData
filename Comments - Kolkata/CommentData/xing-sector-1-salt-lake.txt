A good restaurant for Chinese food in Sector-1 Salt Lake. Located near Kwality more this place serves good Chinese food. There is nothing extra about its ambience. Well done interiors and the staffs are courteous. However the service is a bit slow. We ordered Veg Spring Roll, Veg Noodles, Veg Szechwan Rice & Chilli Babycorn.  The food is here is good and the quantity is also good. 
Overall a good place to have good Chinese food at a very reasonable price.

Xing has been in saltlake for a quite a long and is located near Kwality Stoppage in Salt lake sector 1.
The place is lovely decent with chinese decor all over the walls and it's a square cubical in structure with two layered restau.

üî∏Chicken Spring Roll
üî∏Chicken Steamed Momo
üî∏Golden Fried Prawns
üî∏Mixed Noodle's

üî∏Pepper Chicken

Well to start with how was the taste. I loved the Manchurian Soup. Its was too good and specially in this season!
The Fried prawns are something RECOMMENDED. yes the quality of the the prawns were so good. Amazingly fresh fried prawns definetly tastes the best.
I loved the stuffing of the Chicken Spring roll. It was good with veggies and chicken pieces.
Mixed Noodles were good and expectionally the Chilly Garlic Chicken stood out being my favourite.

Service was pretty good and the quality of the food was fresh and well prepared. The place was decant for having over some chinese lunch for me.

Wandering with a starving belly in Salt Lake and craving some good ol' Chinese food? Xing is the place to be.
It's a stone's throw from the Kwality Bus Stand at BE Block. The interiors are frill-free and has a welcoming warmth to it.
We ordered Xing Special mixed sea-food soup, Chicken Momo, Golden Fried Prawn and followed it up with Mixed Fried Rice and Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken for the mains. We also had a glass of fresh lime soda to occasionally sip on.
The food was SOUL-WARMING.
The soup is just what the doctor ordered for a chilly winter day. It was swimming with fresh sea food, chunks of mushroom and had a heady aroma.
Both the starters were amazing. Be it the fat, juicy and perfectly steamed momos with lots of chicken in it or the beautifully fried golden prawns. Mention must also be made of the absolute freshness of the prawns, a rare treat indeed.
The mains were lagging behind a tad bit in comparison to the starters. The fried rice was quite good but the chicken dish could have been better. It was somehow lacking on flavours and that's the only reason for the deduction of .5 marks, otherwise this place deserves a perfect 5.
If you are a lover of Chinese cuisine and have not been to Xing yet, you don't know what you are missing :)

Xing is located in Sector 1, Saltlake which used to serve decent Chinese dishes. The ambience is pretty nice.

Monchuan Soup was awesome to start with, a recommended item of them.

Chicken Spring rolls were delicious.

Fish and Chips were also enjoyable.

In main course, Sichuan Fish was terrific. We have tried it with the Mixed Hakka Noodles, noodles were also well prepared tasty.

In drinks, one can try the  Sweet and Sour Fresh Lime Soda.

Thumbs up for Xing.

Comfy place with delicious Chinese food. The restaurant is divided in two levels. Ambience is quite cozy. 
Food:-

Chicken Spring roll
Chicken Steamed mom
Fish and chips 
Golden Fried prawns 
All the items tasted excellent. Quality and quantity was also good. The dips which came along tasted brilliant(tangy, sweet and sour). Garnishing could have been better. Service was prompt. The servers served us with a smiling face.
Affordable pricing. I would definitely visit again to try out the other dishes as well.
Highly recommend:)

Located just near the kwality bus stand, BE block, in sector 1.
Xing, is a two levelled eat out spot, serving decent Chinese food.
I was really impressed with the starters, fish and chips, chicken Momo with a spicy dip and soup, golden fried prawns, xing special soup, chicken spring rolls. They were freshly made and served steaming hot.
Alongside we ordered soft drinks and like soda, to wash it down .

For the main course, we settled for chicken fried rice, mixed noodles (hakka), schezwan fish, chilli garlic pepper chicken gravy.
Tastewise it was fine. Side dishes could have been better of course.

Located near 4no. Tank Saltlake BE Block 
Ambiance is cool but service is very slow

Coming to the food quality is great will give 4.5 for that
But quantity is bit less if u order a dish and share
We have ordered xing special fried rice n chilli pepper chilli chicken 
They gave 10 piceses of boneless chicken but pices were very small but tasty 
May visit again...

LOCATION: Situated in BE block right opposite hide restaurant.
AMBIENCE: It is nothing fancy just plain Jane wrought iron furniture divided into two levels.
SERVICE: The staff is very efficient & helpful.
MENU: Covers various Chinese dishes adjusted to suit the Indian palate. 
FOOD: The chicken momos were okay but the momo was a little chewy & the outer shell was thick. The stuffing was good. Served with a light vegetable broth it warms up the cuddles of one's heart. The egg fried rice with everything just about perfect. The Hong Kong chicken perfectly complimented the rice with a slight tangy sweet & sour sauce with little bits of cashew nut.

This is a small restaurant situated near the Kwality Bus Stop in Sector 1, Salt Lake . Seating arrangement is divided into two small floors . Staff behavior is OK though service is on the slower side. Have visited this place a few times as it is located near my place . Food quality is average . Today tried their Chicken Momo for the first time . It was ordinary but the price was on the higher side & they do not provide momo soup. Chicken Lollypop was so so type . Wanted to have their Xing Crispy Fried Chicken but they said it would take a long time to prepare so left without trying.

Xing serves quality food without being harsh on your pocket. It comes as a surprise that this place is so unpopular and underrated. ‚òπÔ∏è The interior is simple and minimalistic but their cleanliness is absolutely commendable. They've even got tables upstairs which is where we generally opt to get seated. Of course the service can be a bit more prompt but the excellent food kinda makes it worth the wait. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Recommended dishes: Satay chicken, schezuan fried rice and haka noodles. üçóüç≤üçù

Yet to try the Indian dishes though.

Review breakdown...

Food: I have to admit the food here is great. I had a fried rice and chicken combo here, and it was really tasty. The quantity was also perfect for one person. The chicken gravy dish was especially delicious. I would have liked it better if the fried rice had more variety of veggies though. For food I would give Xing 4.5/5.
Ambience: The restaurant has been divided into two floors to accommodate more guests. It is dimly lit but I wouldn't call it dark. The furniture is also neatly set, as is the cutlery. There wasn't any music when I had my lunch there, so I can't comment on that. There was only one other table occupied when I went. For ambience I would give 3.5/5.
Service: The service was okay. But there wasn't any attempt to serve us the dishes. The service was minimal, just enough to get the job done. No cause of complaint here but I suppose it would leave a great impression on everyone if the servers were more engaging. 3/5.

Overall: I do recommend this place. It's definitely worth a try. I plan to revisit once I've had a chance to explore some other restaurants in the area.

The decor is basic and simple.
We ordered crispy chicken, Chicken nuggets, mixed Meifoon, honey chicken and chicken lat me Kai.
Both the starters were good. The right amount of crispness and spice...
Meifoon was really good and enough for two. Honey chicken was nice. The only disappointment was lat me Kai chicken...
Price was reasonable compared to the quantity.
Would like to visit again.

Xing belongs to that category of restaurants, which are intrinsically connected to my life and have innumerable memories attached to me.
I literally witnessed the evolution of this eatery, from its very beginning.
I visited Xing for the first time, half a decade ago along with my brother and had ordered chicken sweet corn soup, mixed fried rice and lemon chicken, which were properly cooked, fresh and sumptuous.

Ever since then, on almost every family get together or party, Xing was our sole savior.
Their American Chop suey and Honey Chicken with noodles top my list of favorites.

Go for it without any hesitation guys.
It is budget friendly, serves hearty and delicious Chinese meals with homely warmth and care, plus the staff behavior and service is exceptionally good.

This one is one of the underrated restaurants. Small and cozy. Very average decoration. But food is real catch. They are true experts in chinese cuisine. Spices are in proportion and good quality noodle.
I took home delivery and quantity was good.
I will give one thumb up.
If u are in salt lake sector 1 and 2 and looking for dinning with chinese then this restaurant is ideal.

Very good food at a very reasonable price.
This is the place to be when you are craving for Chinese but don't have money in your pocket. Full on, value for money food.
They make very tasty Chinese food but if I would avoid the North Indian dishes.
Service is good and fast. They even do deliveries.
Super restaurant.

There's no special Xing about this place but this is among my goto restaurants when m really low on budget !
Maybe the price of the food is comparatively low but they never compromise in their food quality. Starting from starters to main course, everything is satisfying.

Absolutely, completely, unanimously, bang for my buck. I think I was pretty much of a regular for the last 1 year I stayed in Kolkata. My favorites were Chicken Sataye, Chicken Reshmi Kebab and a mutton preparation I don't recollect right now. If you have a cricket match you want to watch, in my opinion, this place is the best place to orger food, while enjoying the match on the lower level. They are actually one of the restaurants with surprisingly good air conditioning too. If you are a party of more than 5 - 6 people, I would recommend their 1st floor seating. Even the behavior of staff is commendable. Overall, I would repeat, complete bang for your buck!

This place is located close to kwality bus stop and is easily spotted while one enters the BE block Puja during the festive days . The restaurant has two floors , where the first floor is actually like an an extension with a wooden floor . The service here is poor , and the waiter had to be reminded to gibe is glasses if water , which even the most basic eateries don't deprive you of ! The food here tastes average . However at 10-30 on a festive day , we could not get sweet lime soda and soup , and mixed fried rice because they had run out of it ! The amount served in each plate is also below expectation and makes you want to order more .The butter tandoori roti tastes good . The chicken reshmi butter masala was bland , non spicy, and had a white sauce base. The hong Kong chicken tasted fine . The chicken bharta tasted average , with a dhaniya and onion. Overall , an average restaurant with average food that doesn't impose taxes , and hence a pocket friendly option .

I ordered chinese food from this outlet through food panda. They were quick in response and the food was delivered before time and that really impressed me. I had ordered food for myself n my colleagues. The order was 1 egg noodles, 1 garlic chicken and 1 veg american chopsuey. The quantity and quality were up to the mark. 1 plate of noodles were enough for 2 and the chicken was soft n tender. It was really yum. Also at this pocket friendly price, the quality was not compromised. I would definitely recommend this to everyone to give a try. Lookiing forward to try other delicacies.

My first experience of Zomato Order was from this very restaurant. I have not been there so cannot comment on the ambience but i'll try to opine about the food.
   The order took around 40minutes to get delivered in Salt Lake. I had ordered a Xing special mixed fried rice, a chicken hakka noodles and Hong Kong chicken. The special fried rice was not good so i would not recommend it. The noodles and Hong Kong chicken were well prepared and tasty; but considering the number of good Chinese restaurants and takeaways in Salt Lake, they need to up their game if they are to stay in it. The prices are really on the cheaper side so no complaints there!

This was my second visit here. Just like the first time,we literally filled ourselves with great Chinese food upto the brim , in just 500Rs. Started with a hot and sour chicken soup. After coming to Kolkata, finally I found the kind of soup preparation I was looking for. Then we ordered chicken fried rice, quantity is good for two people. We ordered garlic and pepper chicken gravy to go along with the rice(10 pieces of well cooked chicken, amazing na?). And after all of this we were too full to evn finish our coke. Great service as well!

The servings looked a bit small that average restaurants and the bill looked a little big.
The food was really tasty and for a change this small Chinese restaurant could produce a good tasty Chinese fare. Looking forward to trying all of their dishes in subsequent visits.

Only a little too slow with the home delivery.

Xing is located right at the entrance of the BE block main entry (Quality stop). Well lit with Neons, you can't miss this one if you are passing by. 

However the restaurant turned out to be quite below average when we visited there today. At least the entry to the restaurant looked promising. Food is average and there's nothing mentionable you'd get here - just your standard Chinese Hakka stuff. But service was extremely poor as our starters arrived post main courses. At one time we were wondering if the cook and the waiter were the same guy! 
American Chopsuey was ordered and was below average. Fried rice was good but the pan fried fish was below average again.

Comfy place with good food. The quantity was very good. We ordered crispy chicken, chicken in hot garlic sauce and mixed fried rice. Crispy chicken was mind blowingly delicious. Fried rice was good, most important thing, it wasn't oily, and the quantity was good enough for two hungry souls. The ambience is okay, nothing special there, so was the service. Apt to hangout with friends.

It was on a leisurely Sunday afternoon that we decided to visit xing after being strongly recommended by a friend. The big glass door which was very inviting led us to a small dining area which was flooded with sunlight that entered through the large glass door and windows. We took our time to place the order where we opted for chili garlic pepper chicken, Manchurian chicken and chicken fried rice. We were served only the latter two as the waiter somehow forgot about the first dish. But the service was prompt and the other dish was quickly served. The food was quite enjoyable. Initially i thought the food wouldn't be enough for the two of us but it was. The chicken pieces were tender and the flavors were infused very well. Overall we were satisfied with the food and left the place contented. Although i don't think this place is extraordinary, it is worth visiting if one is hungry and nearby and a very good option for eating out with friends considering the pocket pinch.

After going through all of the reviews,i went to this particular restaurant in Salt Lake.I was not satisfied with the  reviews given by some of the visitors about  this particular restaurant but after having my supper i realised the truthness of the reviews laid down by the Foodies.

¬† ¬† ¬†Firstly,the ambience was very normal.It did not have anything new to distinguish itself from the other restaurants.It also had a very limited seating capacity.But the service was very good.The waiters were agile and well-behaved.

¬† ¬† ¬†Secondly,the food was not so good  from a  vegetarian's point of view.Being a vegetarian,i ordered a plate of crispy chilly babycorn and believe me it was the worst i ever had in a chinese restaurant.It was more oily than it should be.It was not properly designed.Every piece had its own shape.Moreover,trying to make it crispy,they had actually burnt some pieces which blackened some of the  pieces of babycorn.The fried rice was perfect.You can add a dash of salt and pepper to  make it still better.But do not commit a blunder by ordering for veg manchurians.The worst i ever had at any restaurant till now.

¬† ¬† ¬† Having gone with a huge group,i had a good experience as good jokes made amends for the not-so-good food.My ratings:

FOOD-2.5/5

SERVICE-4/5

AMBIENCE-3/5

VALUE FOR MONEY-3/5

OVERALL-3/5.

People who stay in Kolkata, Most happening place after Park Street is Salk lake.. Xing is located in salt lake, where loads of iT champs resides... BUT.. XING -- As the name signifies.. Cross Ing.. So when ever you see XING.. Just Cross ing..

Food is fantabulosly pathetic.. Waste of Money... A small 300 sqft hotel consist of 2 floor, base and +1 .. Worst part is, it is created from Wood.. man.. risking lifes :)

Pros:

- Located near Kwality, one of major Circles of Salt Lake,
- Parking available, no ballet
- Music they play are soothing
- Price dont hit on pockets.

Cons :

- fantabulously pathetic food.
- No birthday discounts, or anything.. Went with people of 15, still no discounts thrown.
- Dont expect english speaking waiters..
- Finger bowl not available,

Well, this restaurant is not a much hyped to be here and get a must dine in..
and I didn't spent a hanging out time here, I've visited this place just once for a Take away service.
Once I had a Groupon deal, to avail it I've took a chance to get here, and no other reason.

Now lets come to the features..
The place is small, you can't get that comfort, but if you are in Saltlake and want to put off your hunger with standard Chinese foods, then this place is OK.. yes the food is not bad, but not too good as well.. but the quantity is not good, may be for it was under the deal offer.. as I've taken away, I found the packaging is not good enough to carrying away a bit longer journey.. The service is good, when I was there only two waters ware there (well enough according to the space), and there ware professional and helpful..

So describing in a small word,
Good for the customers nearby...

It's a small place for a quick inexpensive bite. Although the good was pretty decent with respect to the price range, it is ridiculously hot inside and has poor ventilation. If they can prevent people from sweating while people are eating, which is a horrible experience, it's a decent place to go to.

Very good place for anyone looking to have a nice meal for very affordable price. The food is served very quickly and the place is rarely crowded. Also, the staffs are friendly and allow you to seat anywhere as you wish for rather than depending on how many people are with you. 

Per person expense will be Rs.500 maximum. This includes sufficient starters and main course vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian food items. Also, allows home delivery. Absolutely recommended for bachelors looking for non-alcoholic food joints in Salt Lake.

Today I went to ‚ÄòXing‚Äô with my friends for Lunch. This place was located near Kwality bus stand. After entering I noticed it‚Äôs a very small eating joint & it was completely empty. We started with ‚ÄòSweet Corn‚Äô & ‚ÄòChicken Manchow‚Äô Soup as appetizer along with ‚ÄòRose Sorbot‚Äô. I love that Chicken Manchow Soup!  It‚Äôs really delicious and had good flavours! Rose Sorbot tastes just horrible. Then we tried ‚ÄòCrispy Chili Chicken‚Äô as starter. Honestly I just had one of the tastiest Crispy Chili Chicken I've had in a very long time. Then we had ‚ÄòVeg Hakka Noodles‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Hakka Noodles‚Äô, ‚ÄòChili Baby Corn‚Äô and ‚ÄòChilly Chicken ‚Äôalong with ‚ÄòGreen Salad‚Äô. Taste of Chilly Chicken made me disappointed; I was expecting something more spicy. Taste of Chicken Hakka Noodles was nothing extraordinary but I liked Chilli Baby Corn. For desserts I settle down with ‚ÄòIce Cream‚Äô.  The staffs are friendly and service was fast as well. All total it's a reasonable joint which serves average Chinese food.

I am extremely disappointed of having gone there for a family outing. I had bought online coupons for XING and I guess that was my mistake.
The behaviour of the manager was extremely indecent they would not accept the ad that they had posted even though I had to pinpoint it out on my smartphone. 
The online menu showed non veg items to be served as per the coupon in the 4 course meal but he would not agree. Later on when they agreed to serve the ordered food but they reduced the food to half the original quantity which was not as per the FINE PRINT on the online menu and the rules and guidelines provided by them, It was a pure case deception and conning of customers. 
The food was merely average and I can assure you that u can get equally or even better Chinese food on the street side, They don't even have proper water jugs and forget about chilled water in this hot and humid weather, I have posted a pic of their water bottles. 
The is absolutely no ambience. Even the cutlaries of every person was not the same, the water glasses too differed in their size and shapes.
It was more like for the sake of serving we were being served, no napkins on the table. Hygiene I have my doubts, I pity the poor waiter, for he tried to do his best to compromise on all the faults of the resturant and the management but failed miserably,  the 1.5 is just for that poor chap. 
I absolutely don't recommend this place, there are much better and cheaper place.... more over for my foodie friends and food lovers, this is not the place for you. 
This post is not out of anger but to bring forward the flaws that someone don't get cheated of the money, as I did...even if they had couped up their misbehaviour with good food I would have happily recommended it.

If your in Saltlake craving for a dash of Chinese then this is perfect as long as you order in from the confines of your house, their home delivery service is good and the food usually arrives within a short while unless it is busy in the restaurant.
Only once the fish ordered was very spicy but in terms of taste, portion size they do a pretty good job. Better ambience in the restaurant could improve the experience.

Good food to pack and eat at home.

Had been there several times with family/ friends. Nice food with good service. They specialise in Chinese cuisine. Had tried atleast 10 different dishes and loved all. But tried biriani once and trust me it was poor. Moral of the story if you are at Xing, only order Chinese.

Just an ordinary place.We had Indian.Tangri kabab,dal makhni and chicken bharta.They don't know how to prepare chicken bharta though the other dishes were okay.The daughter ordered chinese.The look  tells you its not god at all.Any way good that I'm not going back there.

The food is awsum. I hv dined here a lot of times. But know it has become costly.. . From the first day till date i like this place. On the valentines's day they perform some special dishes and have candle light dinner. Nice place to go for lovers, family and also for bithday parties. They serve chinese, mughlai. I love the starters here. My favourite items are mostly prawn items. The Mutton gravy recipe is also my favourite.

Xing is a small place in salt lake where one can go with close firneds and totally chill out, make loud jokes and enjoy a racous dinner. The quality of food is good with dry chilli chicken being my personal favourite. The chicken hakka noodles are also quite tasty. The speed of service is good but it could have been a little faster. The restaurant is cozy but it is not a fine-dining place by any means. 

If you stay in salt lake then this is a place where you can think of spending an evening on a moderate budget or if you want to pack in good food and take it home!

Xing is an excellent place for a budget lunch or dinner. They have a very good option in all the cuisines like Chinese, North Indian, Mughlai. I have tried each of the cuisine and never found any dishes bad at all. Location is the major negative factor for this restaurant as many people are not aware of this restaurant at all. Food quality is very good.

An Unappreciated place in Salt lake receives less Credit than it should. The Chinese served by this restaurant is commendable & Loved by its lovers who order it from there homes each day, (me being one of them).
The reason it is not more famous is because of its interiors & Dinning Service which lack class.
BUT For Home Delivery In And Around Salt Lake This is a Great Option who provides quick delivery and hot piping food at your doorstep which you will love!!
A Big Thumbs Up!!
And Recommended to all!!

this place is great but try to make this one more of a resturant than a snacks corner
and the behaviour of the staff members are also good

Price is good, with soft music and dimmed light the 1st floor is really great place to spend some quality time. One can surely try Xing for a decent experiance.

The Kwality area already has known names like Zest and Rahmania where people have been coming for years. Xing is relatively a new place, but they've carved out a decent place for themselves now. 
I've been here on a lazy weekend afternoon. The place is usually empty in the afternoons. However, service was pretty fast and efficient. 
The dishes are your typical chowmein/fried rice/chilly chicken ones but they tasted good. Not amazing, but good enough to warrant a return here.
Obviously, as you've noticed from the menu, the prices are very affordable too.

ADD 'XING' TO YOUR DINING EXPERIENCE! 3.5 out of 5

Among the many affordable restaurants in Salt Lake, Xing ranks high in popularity because of its genuine offerings of Chinese fare. It is not difficult to locate this happening food joint as it is located very near the Kwality bus stand. The servers are competent at their job and the service is prompt and fast. The dishes are priced reasonably, especially for that standard of food. Despite being a not so huge joint the ambience is decent.

The food served is tasty and well prepared. For starters, the Momos and wantons were cooked wonderfully and their portion sizes were big and generous. Even the popular chicken lollipops and crispy chicken turned out to be juicy and chunky starters. After the delish starters, their soups simply fill you with a lot of warmth. The soups worth mentioning are their chicken clear soup and chicken fresh mushroom soup. Both the soups were fresh, well seasoned and fragrant. 

These can be followed by their chow and fried rice dishes. The quantity of the rice and noodle served is simply overwhelming. Equally well made are the Mei foon options. The noodles are thin, soft textured and light. Even their American chopsuey is served devoid of any kind of ketchupy taste. The side dishes that can be had here are lemon chicken, chilli chicken, Manchurian fish and Sichuan prawn. The Sichuan preparations (whether they are meat, rice or noodles) are fiery and tongue burning fare, just like I had at a Sichuan restaurant in Shanghai. Nevertheless, they do tame down the hotness of certain dishes to suit individual needs. The Indian items on offer are decent (since they had started out and are still mostly frequented by Chinese customers who have a penchant for Indian food). The food served here is definitely the kind that tastes good and leaves you with a satisfied and full stomach.

Our party of four people decided to drop in Xing for some food on a weeknight. We were sort of hungry so ordered chicken lolly pop and hot and sour chicken soup right away, followed by veg chowmien and chilly garlic pepper chicken. 

The food came in rapid succession and I must say, they were all piping hot and served very fresh. My two peeves were - 1. the waiter had to be reminded to fill our water glasses.
2. The bill came in about 10 minutes after waiting for it. 

Other than these two issues I have to say that the food quantity and quality was quite good, although nothing close to Chinatown. However, it was quite tasty. the ambiance is okay and the prices are very reasonable.

"Xing" the name seemed very catchy to me.
Yea, it is located exactly at the 'Xing' of Kwality bus-stop and BE Block.

I had been there once only and tried Chinese food. Food was really good enough. Hope north Indian and Mughlai dishes impress me more next time.

Cost for the food was fair enough according to the standard. It will never set fire on your pocket. 

Ambiance was very good, it is not a huge place but very decent. I found it very peaceful (may be because of weekday).

Service was also satisfactory but a bit slow. (I didn't care as I didn't have to catch any train)

My Ratings - 
Food-3.5/5
Ambiance-3.5/5
Service-3/5
Value for Money-4/5

Overall- 3.5/5 [I do recommend people to have a try over there, I hope it won't disappoint you]

located near kwality bustand in salt lake....xing serves delicious chinese food. being a regular customer at xing i would recommend everyone to have atleast one try. the mutton boti kabab of xing has been voted as the most delicious mutton preparation all over the city by the times food awards. i personally like the cantonese chowmein,the chicken lat me kai(last time i counted,it had 23 boneless pieces) and the chimney soup is a must have...the prices are now inclusive of tax unlike as stated in the info and the menucard. indian items are average.the soft drinks are a waste of money....they give you only a small glass full but charge 30 bucks for it.ambience is also okay. infact the wash basin looks more stylish than the eating area. jokes apart, good chinese food and proper value for money.

personal ratings:

food : 3.5/5
ambience: 2/5

i had been to xing quite a few times.. and seriously i was not disappointed!
the ambience is really good...
infact there aint much customers available during afternoons.. and its good to have food in a serene atmosphere..
i would not say it serves food with excellent taste! but it definitely does serves food which tastes good and atleast i leave the restaurant happily after having food!
