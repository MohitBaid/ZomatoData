We had opted for lunch buffet in Mythh and they very much lived upto my expectations in both service and food. The staffs were very cordial and they enquired twice or thrice if everything was okay. From mocktails to the starters, everything was made to perfection. I thought I was full when I wished to try their desserts. But after having a spoonful , the desserts automatically made their space. Yes! It was that tasty. The desserts were the best desserts I have had so far in any 5 star restaurant. I am going back again for the starters and desserts. Must visit.

We went there for NYE dinner. The people were very helpful and courteous. We got a table a bit far from the buffet spread. There was a band, dancers and a magician called Prince Sil who was really awesome. Coming to the horrible food! The starter spread was too small with only a Thai salad worth mentioning. The Chinese spread had rotten noodles and the Indian spread had equally horrible items. The continental items, though very few in number turned out to be exceptionally disappointing. And the best part was the dessert table which should have just been a single bowl of chocolates ..because that is what was really there. A huge disappointment and nowhere near other famed hotels in there league. Avoid if possible (especially on festivals)!

Went there for a weekday lunch buffet. The spread is good. Starters were very good.So were d salads. Deserts were good also . Maybe the only negative of this buffet menu was that there was no non veg rice item. Fried rice and noodles were there but it was in d veg category. But all in all it was a good lunch and we enjoyed it

Coming to food- Starters were okay..Main attraction is their awesome main course..i love the fried rice, chiclen items, fish items,prawns was too tasty..But unfortunately dessert was not that much good except the rosomalai..And service could have been better...
Overall decent experience....

Went for the buffet lunch last week. Ambience was peaceful and the staffs were courteous but their service was not up to the mark. The biriyani seemed too oily and none of the dishes tasted great, only I found the salad section quite impressive. The variety of non-veg dishes was very limited. Overall the experience was ok and not great.

Went there for my best frnd's birthday. The staffs are extremely courteous (well they better be, considering how much we are playing, lol). And the cute waiters didn't hurt. The ambience and decor is grand as it should be. We ordered chicken biryani, kulcha naan, paneer jhal farezi, mud pie with ice cream, and a Choco shake. Chicken biryani unfortunately didn't taste like biryani, kulcha and paneer was very okayish. The mud pie was heavenly, and the milk shake was good. Will definitely go back again.

In Mytth food was not so great and was a real disappointment. The Indian food was still okay but the Chinese food was not at all upto the mark. It was burnt and not so tasty either.

Went on a sunday. Specifically asked if they had brunch that day to which they said yes but for such a high end restaurant they seem to have no idea about the difference between a brunch menu and a lunch menu. 
We were basically served lunch as brunch and apart from the soup and the desserts that day that were absolutely delicious, none of the other food items are worth mentioning. 
Really disappointing experience.

Staff was courteous and gave us a complete tour of the buffet before we started, which was really helpful. Lots of options mainly Indian and Chinese. Ambience is very peaceful and the place is very well decorated. Will go back for the buffet with alcohol which is 1299 plus taxes.

We were in a big group and visited this place for buffet dinner on a weekday.  Since we had senior citizens also in the group, we were quite apprehensive about the service we shall get,but I must admit it was a right decision to choose this place. We got a very warm welcome. The staff was extremely courteous and went out of their way to help us serving especially the senior citizens. The choice of dishes in the buffet was also different and well chosen this time. Overall the experience was very good. Would love to visit the place very soon. Special thanks to the stuardess priyanka and her helper. Thanks Mr.Amitava for taking the effort to make our evening special.

Good ambience.. The orders take too long to arrive..  My steak (photo attached)  arrived after more than half an hour. The steak was very tough, either it wasn't fresh or it was overdone! Wasn't juicy at all. My friend ordered Pinne pesto and liked it. 
We ordered chhanar payesh to round it off but were informed after about 20 mins that it wasn't available, that too when we repeatedly asked for it. We got chum chum instead, which was fine! 
The staff appears to be clueless! 
Nothing to get me back the and pay the premium! 
A very mediocre restaurant!

I will talk about the dinner buffet.
Biriyani's rice was less and chicken in it was more. Also the main course only included biriyani. The chowmein was in the veg portion. The chicken was nice but the non veg starters were so less. Highly dissatisfied and disappointed with what they charge and what they provide. Gives you the - "High end places charges more and has less quality" vibe.

We had gone to Mythh on poila boishakh to have their special buffet.
The buffet prices were a bit high.It was around 1500 inclusive of taxes.
The ambience is very beautiful and it was specailly decorated that day with a bangaliana touch to match with the Bengali new year ocassion.
The staffs are friendly and courteous.
We did reservations that day itself.
They gave us complementary cold drinks which was not a part of the buffet and that's sweet.
Coming to the buffet,it started with refreshing aam panna followed by chicken corn soup with noodles.
The starters had both bengali as well as continental dishes.
We had salads,pasta,bhetki fry,mochhar chop,chilli chicken dry,baked fish and chicken in white wine.
The baked fish tasted out of the world.
Also,I personally loved the chicken in white wine a lot.
Moving on to the main course,it had widespread bengali as well as chinese food.
The Bengali food consisted of Steamed rice,chholar daal,beguni,luchi,Chhanar kopta,bilati shukto,echorer dolma etc in veg item.
Non veg items were kolkata special chicken biryani,doi rui,Pork belly and Mutton kosha.
The food were delicious be it veg or non veg.
The pork belly was so tasty and had perfect proportions of fat and meat.
We being chinese cuisine lovers,treated us with a plate of chinese items as well though we were pretty much full.
The food were irresistible.
There was noodles,friedrice,chilli garlic fish,lamb and chicken.
Chinese dishes were equally lipsmacking.
Before trying desserts we went to the chaat section and did ourselves a paapdi chaat.
Then came the pretty nice desserts.
There was gorom pantua,mishti doi,payesh,rosogolla,sondesh and also mousse,cakes and kiwi tarts.
The buffet is s bit costly but then again it is absolutely worth it.
We had a great experience here.

Visited with a group of friends on Sunday. We were 8 people's group and after little discussion we opted for A-la-carte. The order was not that complicated. 4 mocktails. 4 whiskey on which buy 1 get 1 offer was going on. In starter one non veg kebab platter , one mutton item(name I guess Gosht Boti Kebab)and crisp in basket. For the main course mutton biryani for 7 people with a mutton and a chicken side dish, naan and one daal. I opted for a continental item of chicken breast : Go Pollo Ala Mythh . The order was placed around 8 pm and when we finished off finally it was 10.45 pm. Such a slow service. We kept on waiting for each and every item. Now coming to the taste I can't write anything about the biryani part. For my dish it was okayish 'cause the chicken as they've claimed in the menu card was not succulent enough and veggies were not properly boiled. I couldn't eat a single piece except the baby corns. But the mushroom jus was very tasty which was the saviour. Quantity wise it was good enough so no complaint. I like each and every item of starter be it kebab platter or batter fried prawn, chicken and fish finger. Now coming to the dessert part which was really awesome. We wanted to have desserts from buffet counter but as we opted for a-la-carte we were unsure whether we can do that or not. But yes after speaking with the staff they gave us a good deal - Pay Rs.200 for each person and enjoy unlimited desserts from buffet counter . Desserts were super yummy (one should definitely try red velvet cupcake and mud pie) except one mousse in which I got raw egg smell. Food was average , staffs are good .Overall it was a nice experience, could have been great if all the foods were as good as their desserts.

A few days ago , finally got sometime to visit this place .Sitting in any table, you have a wonderful view of the workshop-like kitchen where you can see the chefs working. The staff is very caring and friendly.  The menu offered a wide variety of starters but unfortunately I didn't like any of them . The main course was also not satisfactory. But the desserts were awesome .

The food was delicious, the ambiance was exactly how fine diners should be. However, a very special mention to the service. From the time i reserved my table i was assisted by their staff who on the day, assisted me to our tables and kept checking on us and if we are statisfied every now and then. A big kudos to Amitav Chandra, for the same. Over all a very satisfying experience.

☆☆☆☆☆.. really,I don't know how!!A three star rating for the hotel is good enough.You'll know what I mean if you stay here but since this is zomato I'm going to review the restaurant.

It's sad but true,the place serves the same buffet for lunch and dinner without making the mistake of any changes in the food or menu...You'd be shocked at the variety in cusine they have ,but taste is very average.

Their salad bar is nice but it's presented in bowls that are too small and you end up dropping a part of the food from the bowl every time you try to serve.I wouldn't like to go back.

Service is average . Nothing wowed me.

Well, To be honest, I expected much better food and hospitality here, during my visit to this place for the 1st time on My Friend's Birthday lunch. I don't know the reason behind such poor service though.This happened because of our late arrival for lunch hour or this is the normal way for them , the reason is quite mysterious till now. Anyway, there were 2 elderly staffs who actually treated us well, and we would love to be thankful to both of them. 
The ratings are as follows: 

Food 2.5/5
Ambience 4.5/5
Service 2.5/5 ( I would have scored 1.5 if those two staffs were not there )

This is one of the best buffets that we had in Kolkata. More than anything else i would want to thank the hospitality rendered by the stuff, especially Mr. Amitava. It was my husband's birthday & we wanted to try out the buffet in HHI. We had called to make reservations & was informed that there would be either crab OR prawn in the buffet. That was a problem for us as my husband does not have meat, he only eats fish. When we reached & was midway through the yummy buffet, appreciating every bit of the food among ourselves, there comes Mr. Amitava along with the Chef with a big crab, wishing the Birthday Man. He mentioned that this was specially prepared for us. We were overwhelmed to the core. Thank you to one & all for making our experience such a memorable one...
We highly recommend Myth. Food is yummy from the moment you start. Huge spread... and please keep lot of space for desserts, you get to taste baked mihidana & other tasty delicacies...

Been to Mythh quite a couple of times and have always been treated very well. The place has good feel to it. Very classy. Staff is very courteous. Food here has always been good. The Mushroom Express Soup, Galouti kebabs, Mutton Rogan Josh, Chicken Tikka Masala and Biryani are really good and if you have a sweet tooth, I'd strongly suggest you keep a good amount of place for deserts. They are really good.

I don't know where to start as this amazing place with their extraordinary buffet and super smooth service left me overwhelmed and spell bound.let me rate this place first :
Salads : 3.5/5
Starters: 4.5/5
Main course :4.5/5
Desserts:5/5
Hospitality and service :5/5
Interior and environment :5/5
Now let's start with d starters and salads...those who know me or follow my reviews ,know that I m not at all a salad person.but tonight I helped myself with a second serving of salads and that speaks for itself. In starters ,I opted for chilli fish and chicken kebabs , totally bypassing d veg starters ...and it was a wise decision I must say as d chilli fish was so good to taste that it was impossible for any one to have it just once.the chicken kebabs were well cooked,juicy and appalling to taste buds. For main course I limited my choice : I just took chicken biriyani and mutton roganjosh ,though they offered fish (continental)and variety of dal,breads,sabji (both Indian and continental including ratatouille !!!) As by d time I was almost full and I was trying to save place for desserts. Chicken biriyani tasted heavenly and mutton roganjosh followed d suit.
Now come to d show stopper :their desserts . absolutely mind blowing.i hv a sweet tooth and I can not emphasise enough what desserts mean to me. I don't know who is d in charge of their pastry chef bt d person is a gem.each of their desserts was 'perfection'.the muffins were soft, the tarts r full of flavour and light,crispy and d pastries were not to sweet,flavourful ,light, fluffy...I loved it so much.
P.s. they offer 2 glasses of mocktails /1brewed drink per customer .I opted for d mocktail and I must say it was like hitting a bull's eye on very first time.

Went to their midnight buffet. Our group of 11 Left without having any food. The menu had no starters, the mains consisted of rice, dal, alur dum, chicken biryani, mustard fish and a few desserts. Really disappointing when you consider the buffet is priced at 550 plus taxes. 
But the rating is mainly because of the misleading advertisement they have been carrying in the newspapers and Zomato mentioning chicken a la kiev and what not. 
Tagging the advertisement.

Celebrated my birthday here last september with around 23 people. We had availed the groupon(now nearbuy) buffet.  The ambience is really nice and the buffet is exquisite. Their widespread buffet has an assortment of amazing dishes of which i loved the fish florentine ! The buffet also includes bengali cuisine along with oriental and continental. The dessert platter was very palatable too with fresh cream cakes and mousse. Also, they served oven fresh thin crust pizza and pasta. It was a delightful experience overall. I wish to visit them soon.

Absolutely horrified to be sitting in a 5 star establishment. The house water came in a really dirty jug. Could've brewed my own beer in the amount of time they took to bring one to my table. The service was pathetic. The servers uniform was stained and filthy and he keep moving his lips and sticking his tongue out in a cow-like fashion which was appalling. Beer was warm too. Only ordered a club sandwich that took 30 minutes and tasted funky. And they charge Taj prices. Unfortunate experience.

I had been to this restaurant yesterday to try the food in the Sizzler festival. Sorry to say but I was highly disappointed. I generally don't mind to spend on good food provided the quality is epitome and tastes good, however that has not been the case. Tried 3 preparations out of which 2 were below average. The rum prawn and lime preparation was good but the prawns were not fresh at all. The Bhekti item was good however the salmon was again not fresh at all. Overall a disappointing experience.

Chinese was good...not happy with Indian preparations. But I wish to put up this very strongly - staff is not trained enough to handle heavy traffic...hence attention is missing.

Try out Myth at HHI of you are bored of the regular platter provided by most restaurants.  The gastronomic delight that you will experience here will tingle your taste buds and memories for quite sometime and urge you to make this one of your most visited cafes. Try put the new sizzlers served here which are not only different from the rest but cooked and flavored to perfection. The beautifully cooked fish , the succulent  prawn sizzlers  with all its flavour and just the right texture and also the very innovative summer cool desserts like the  sizziling pineapple icecream  dessert  are some of the new dishes to look forward to. Myth , always has something new to offer every time I visit. The staff is friendly,  and the ambience just perfect for that lunch with your girls or your special friend. You can be comfortable and enjoy the delicacies while making wonderful memories with you gang. Great place, great food, great ambience .

Mythh is a multicuisine restaurant in HHI. We went their with a group of 20 for a buffet dinner. The food quality was very average. Baby corn, chicken were just ok. Fish fry was good. There was shortage of staff who were not able to serve us properly. They served us chutneys after we had finished our starters. We ordered chili chicken from ala-carte and as expected that didn't turn out to be good as well. We placed a repeat order and again the same. Main course on buffet was cold. Friendly staff but poor service. Not worth.

With some high expectations visited mythh for dinner with my family. It was a buffet dinner on a Monday. The spread included tomato soup, chicken meat ball soup, papri chat, 5 varieties of veg and non veg salad, fish amritsari, chicken tikka, crispy baby corn, noodles, corn rice, biriyani, bengali style fish, Thai fish, chinese style chicken, two continental dish, dal tadka, naan, nolen gurer rasgollas, two types of pastries and 4 other desserts. The spread undoubtedly had several varieties but it all lacked taste. I liked the tomato soup and the rasgollas. The rest were bellow average. The dishes that were really bad were biriyani, the Chinese dishes and the fish. o na whole, I was disappointed, as despite the variety, the food lacked taste and did not meet the standards of HHI. The cost is definitely on the higher side.

We had our Christmas lunch here. Must say, have never experienced such a wide variety of food in the buffet. They had everything, from authentic bengali food like kosha mangsho to continental roasted turkey. Enjoyed having a taste of everything. Their desserts were all great. Had many options. Special mention of the baklava.

What not was there in the buffet. Indian to international. The taste was also just wow. Such good food! Just made my day! Service was also warm! Thumps up for it! 😊

Had a buffet lunch.  Nice environment.  Wide variety of veg and non veg items.  Continental dishes were better. Specially the smoked fish and grilled items.  Looking forward to attend the kebab mela at the kaalash (Same hotel). Less service time and courteous staffs. Overall good experience.  Parking is a problem if you go there on holidays or busy hours.

The mythh has been on my wish list since a long time and my first tryst with this extravagant restaurant was exquisite. I availed the buffet on a weekday night and the courses were definitely not short of numbers.  As far as my memory serves the entire buffet spread consisted of more than 25 courses excluding desserts . The dessert sections were equally amazing. The best part was that we were served with 2 complementary drinks(beer/mocktail) per person. The buffet was a blend of north Indian, Chinese , continental and a little touch of thai . The starters were amazing especially the succulent kebabs of the Indian section. All the fish preparations satiated my taste buds to the utmost level. The staffs were courteous and the ambience was top notch . My virgin visit to this restaurant was a memorable one. I'll hope to be back soon. :)

Starters- 4/5
Main Course- 4/5
Deserts- 5/5
Ambience- 5/5
Service-1/5

All the items were delicious!
Loved the baked fish, the paneer, the biriyani and the brownie specially!

Only one thing which I didn't like was that they take lots and lots of time to refill when one dish gets over in the buffet table!
I waited for over 30minutes and then they refilled..

Would like to visit again and get a better service than before :)

Breakfast  beckons for the jury panel before we start the morning round of business presentations by under grads from various institutions from the eastern and central parts of India. Our hosts have arranged a long table at Mytth. A nice omelette with loads of mushrooms, cheese did green chillies is quickly served to my table as I eat my muesli in cold milk. The watermelon juice tasted more tetra pack than freshly squeezed. The masala tea was bang on.. Good taste of ginger. The luchis ( Bangla puris) and aloo posthu was sublime, tart & tangy. The baked beans was too sweet, more of tomato sauce I suspect. The grilled fish in some mustard yellow sauce was popular; as most of my fellow jurors and hosting team who hail from Kolkatta devouring it greedily while me and one other juror who had travelled up watch their passion for bedki. The Bakery items were standard.. I liked the mishti doi ( sweet yogurt) served in mud little bowls. How quaint. Filled up we troop in sharp 0930 into the presentation room where 12 teams nervously watch us jurors enter to score them and select the  eastern zonal finalists. All I can tell them is best wishes or ...Tomake Shubha Kaamna !!!!

I went to The Myth,HHI for the lunch buffet and i must say the place is awesome. The food,the ambience,the service offered is upto the mark.There were a number of starters and they tasted quite good and delicious. There were numerous options for the main course dishes.A complete set of oriental as well as continental dishes with the addition of live pasta and pizza counter.What else does a foodie dream of?The pasta however was not cooked well so that bit of disappointed me..but the rest was absolutely flawless.I loved the restaurant and the food. The choice of desserts was well served and yummy. Overall a good experience...

Let's head straight to our business i.e. food. Though they have a pretty long list of items to be served for buffet  but those are not  well organised. The preparations are also very mediocre as far as a five starred restaurant is concerned. Only their biriyani was something which I loved, apart from this not a single dish could satisfy my taste buds. 
Decor - 3.5/5 
Hospitality - 4/5
Food - 3/5

Mythh is a 24 hour cafe in hhi which also serves buffet lunch and dinner. We went for a lunch buffet in mythh. The buffet spread was good. But there was only few types of starter. But the desserts were amazing. The taste of main course is not up to the mark as compared to five star. The ambience was good. The service was also very good.

The buffet spread seemed nice...but while actually having the food I realized that nothing tasted that special..apart from few starters..like dry chilli chicken..a fried fish...grilled fish etc..
In the main course I liked the Methi chicken..schezwan fish..the noodles..achari baingan etc..most of the remaining items were not as tasty as they appeared...
Looks can be deceiving..!!
Plz stay away from the mocktail named the pink rabbit..its horrible...basically a punch of orange juice n roohafza (rose syrup)
The desserts were fine...yet again..nothing special...
And the pizza which they served were horrible..plz think twice before u order a pizza at Mythh..!!
Il just give full marks for the ambience..!!

We went for Buffet lunch. The major attraction was the deserts and salads. There were variety of salads and option to prepare it by ownself. Every item had both beg and non-veg. The food were well cooked. I loved the noodles. I fell in love with their baked rasogollas....yummy. Variety of deserts available. However there were no ice-cream. Ice - cream lovers be prepared. The choice of food was various.

The staff members were helpful but they shouls clear plates in presence of their customer. They had taken away my mocktail when I was away from my table to fill my plate.

Food was good. Foodies, worth spending here.

Buffet dinner at Mythh - Hotel Hindustan International did not evoke any special feeling although it has a glorious past. Behavior of the staff members are very casual and lacking professionalism. Ambience not like a five star property and furniture looks dated. Regarding food, there are many varieties , tastes good but obviously not the best. Also purchased one 2lbs cake from their Pastry Shop , the quality of which was not up to the mark. Management should be more conscious and follow stringent quality control to compete with other top rated hotels in the city.

went there yesterday to have the experience of the Buffet Meal and really liked that...

Ambiance is great.. just as it has to be as a 5 Star...

Service is good.. as we ware having buffet.. they cleared the table several times during our dinner....

now lets come to the food.. 

nothing much to say...  the buffet contains more or less 30 items including soups & salads..  each of them are best at their level.. 
and specially from the live Kitchen "The Pizza".. ummm..  just superb... 
and yes... let's share one more example of the sheaf's cooking expertise.. without mention of it this review cannot be completed.. an Oriental mix veg dish was there (can't remember the name), the vegetables ware properly shaped and unbroken and not smashed, but they're just melted in mouth while grabbing..

some veg Continental dish we didn't like.. that might be for our choice difference, and also the Deserts.. really can't appreciate those.. 
but from the Starters to the Main coerces, and of course the the Mocktails.. ware enough to forget about the deserts...

INTRO - - - - - We were extremely skeptical while choosing HHI for our dinner buffet. It shouldn't have been since it is one of the leading 5-star hotels in town, but negative reviews for Mythh here in Zomato were enough to raise the alert. Anyway we went in there hoping our experience would be something totally different, outrageously exceptional, but we were proved wrong and it turned out to be a pretty average dining experience, which was forgettable and could have been rather avoided.

FOOD - - - - - Let's get straight to business and talk about the main part for which we were there. The buffet menu was rather extensive and covered several cuisines, flavors and geographic bits, but sadly there was no such item for which I'll again come back. I found mostly the people staying there at the hotel were dining at Mythh who have got no other option but to eat whatever they get at this restaurant. There were very few who came in like us to eat at this place by-choice. The huge spread was the only plus side of this whole dining saga, we started with a rather pale vegetable soup with not-so-fresh breads and butter cubes. There were few salads which were okayish, out of which I liked the grilled chicken salad, the sushi in the salad section was pretty average and should have been avoided. There was a DIY chaat section where you can prepare a chaat for yourself, if you don't make it good you can't blame anyone! The salad section could have been more extensive like we had at Hyatt. And most importantly some of the starters should have been nice and tasty, that's a very small ask, right? Among the mains, there were actually numerous dishes and on a normal day it is almost inhuman to have all the dishes. We had tasted a few, like the Singaporian noodles, Moon phan fried rice, Thai vegetables in green curry, Corn and peas in ginger wine sauce, crispy chilli baby corn, schezwan chicken, Asian vegetables in curried sauce, Baked corn and mushroom, Cottage cheese sashlik, Grilled fish in orange sauce, Dal makhani, Dum Aloo banarasi, Elaichi Paneer and Kadai Subzi. Out of these Grilled fish in orange sauce was good, the fish in there was fresh and I actually hogged quite a few of them, maybe I liked it more because of the scarcity of a better dish than this. The Pasta and Pizza from the Live Counters were inedible, I have never ever tasted a pizza or pasta which is so bad, it was just horrible and we had to waste the entire dish, it takes some real merit to cook something so bad. Anyway, along with all these you get two beers or mocktails (soft drinks and fresh lime soda). The desserts are okayish and you can try mainly the pastries, ice cream was not available though. 

Maybe they are trying to keep bits of everything and in turn specializing in nothing, that only attracts negative rating and does no good. It leaves you unsatisfied, still longing for one, just ONE GREAT DISH. From starters till desserts, you wont get any so-called amazing star dish here, all the items are mediocre (quality-wise) and few are actually below average.

SERVICE - - - - - Again there is huge scope of improvement there in this department. In a buffet dinner there is really very less scope of service expected from the waiters, still they managed to do it all wrong. Our used/soiled plates were not been cleaned even after several requests, we had to keep asking for forks and spoons. Few of the waiters seemed to be dissatisfied with their job and were openly arguing with their supervisor / in-charge. The in-charge tried to cover things up and he was quite polite and tried to be prompt.

AMBIANCE - - - - - I did intentionally keep this section after everything because good things should come in the end. The ambiance of HHI is really amazing and grand, there is nothing new about it; though I feel the ambiance and interior decor of Mythh is a bit neglected and could have been much better. I never do like their typical wavy ceiling with pinkish light highlighting the curves, it doesn't do with the splendid 5-star decor in any way. But still the ambiance is good enough and doesn't disappoint us like the food or maybe the service.

OVERALL - - - - - Let's cut the long story short, do not visit this place for quality of food, it's just average. But if you really want to dine at HHI since it is a 5-star property then you may try them out once, but then you will yourself get to know the positives and negatives after one meal at Mythh :)

Cheers!

Just went to have a couple of beers. Ambience is very good while the staffs are very hospitable though they are only aware about the details of their outlet, and absolutely do not have any idea about other outlets in the hotel like their timings, offers, etc. We had also ordered for a Dalchini Murgh Kabab, which was supposed to be cinnamon flavoured, but surprisingly tasted more like a Chicken Tikka, although the taste and the tenderness of chicken was very good. More attention needs to be given to service, wherein we were served with chipped plates and cracked sauce bowls. However, the plates were changed after complaining. Also, pest control should be regularly done, as there are few flies which can disturb your patience. Actually, these are petty small issues, though it cannot be expected in a 5 star hotel.

I had been wanting to check out what Mythh had to offer on its buffet for a while now. Considering HHI has made such a name in the hospitality industry, the curiosity about what it can serve for the taste buds is one I had been pondering about. 

We were served Fusion Fruit Juices on our arrival, with a choice between Fruit Punch and a Strawberry-OJ mix. The Fruit Punch was better.
For starters we were served Fish with Honey Glaze and a type of Chicken Kebab, whose exact name I fail to recall. The former was too sweet by my standards. But the latter was simply brilliant. Soft, tender and juicy chunk of grilled Chicken. The flavours were a harmonious blend!

For the main course there were a variety of standard offerings: two kinds of soup, different breads, steamed rice, Indian breads, Veg Hakka Noodles, Ginger-Capsicum Rice, Salads, Chicken Stew,Mushroom Ragaut, Fish Coriander. Of all, Mushroom Ragaut stood out the most and I practically had that for my main course.

The dessert was a treat! No pun intended.
Ras Malai, Mixed Fruit Gateau, Black Forest Cake, Mango and Chocolate Mousse, Gulab Jamun, Hot Brownies, Chocolate & Strawberry Swiss rolls. As I said, the dessert made my day, more than the rest of the meal.

So drop in with your friends and family! 😊

SUNDAY DINNER WAS SPOILED RESTRO HAS NO CLASS NO SERVICE AND FOOD QUALITIES,TOTAL WASTAGE OFF URS TIME AND MONEY.......👎.

That was the first time we went to HHI for dinner at Mythh. The entry wasn't quite pleasant though since they didn't have ample parking space at the entrance. We had to park the car at a parking plot opposite to the hotel. I have been visiting the Millennium Building since ages but never knew that the hotel just next to it is so classy. The ambience of Mythh is too formal , suitable for business dinners. But for a family like ambience, I would rate Kalash above Mythh. Courteous staffs and overall a good experience. We went for al a carta menu and they had a long menu to choose from. Their Bengali deserts were better than the famous sweet's shops of the city. I think I had the best misti doi at the HHI. We were not aware of their buffet spread which I late heard had huge collection of items. Cost for 3 was around 5600. Had we opted for buffet, I guess it would have within 5000. Will be visiting again this wee

I have been visiting this place quite often. And honestly I am in love with it. Set amidst the cacophony of the city, the place is a sheer escapade in the busy road of Rabindra Sadan, i.e. Exide. Starting with their decor it's sleek and at the same time eye catching. Modern approach with richness. Coming down to the food, it's a true high end affair. Be it their Grilled Fish with lemon butter parsley sauce or Grilled Chicken with rosemary and wine reduction. Their Buffet has kept up to that elevated standard. In my last visit I dugged in their Buffet Lunch. Well after looking at the array quoting it an 'Royal Affair' will also standout. The array was humongous. It started off with Assorted Bread Basket and Soup, followed by a live salad counter, then there was selection of dishes from the Bengali Rasoi. And the fare continued with chinese, indian, Mughlai, Continental etc. Well I loved their Prawn in Cantonese Style and again Moon Fa Rice became my favourite. The Chicken Tangri Kebab was an example of perfectly cooked kebab, well smokey and juicy from inside. The Dal can make you remember your mother's hands among the other delectable dishes. Coming to the Dessert I would say it's an complete indulgence in a sinful activity, yes I am a sinner and ready to commit more.......... If such dessert comes in my plate..... their dessert counter stood shinning in the middle of the outlet. Chocolate Mud-pie simply bowled me, the mangolicious Mango Mousse was a superb end to my course. The service was really quick and awesome. I still remember their outlet manager Hari, a very courteous guy, who was really helpful. All the staffs were amiable, well mannered and prompt, which is expected in a 5 star Hospitality unit. Ambience was just right. I bet you have to leave this place with an smile on your face .................. Amust try  !!!!

We went to Mythh to redeem a Groupon voucher for Buffet meal..After reading a few negative reviews from fellow foodies I was a bit skeptical,However I must say the food didn't dissappoint me..majority of items are tastefull,delicious and prepared with utmost care and the chef himself came up for feedback..indeed a nice gesture..Coming to the interior the decor is classy and elegant to the core,something you expect in an establishment like this..Special mention goes to the Open Kitchen..The only major flaw is service,quite slow and hugely inattentive,something totally unexpected..Coming to the food the Mains were way better than the starters,the salad bar was also nice..But being a sweet tooth I was hugely dissappointed by the deserts..though there were lots of options I felt it was kind of monotonous,all similar types of pastries,no Chocolate desert..Coming to the spread:Mocktails- Cranberry cooolers and Strawberry Floats were both nice..
Soups: 1 veg and 1 non-veg soup..It was decent..nothing extraordinary..
Salads: 2 non-veg salads,loved Thai Fish Salad and Chicken Tikka Chat..both were delicious and unique in flavour..loved the Thai Fish salad specially..
Starters: Fried Chicken which was a bit stiff and chewy.. Fish Tandoori which was nicely charred..Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Paneer Roll also tasted good..
Mains: Fish Ajwain and Chicken Curry in Indian section..The Fish was fresh and spicy,the Chicken was a bit bland and runny..served with Kulchas and Rice..
Pan Seared Fish and Grilled Chicken in Continental.. The Pan Seared Fish was the Hero of the spread..a slight tinge of Mustard,nicley done,tasted heavenly!!Chicken was also done nicely,subtle,mild flavours..
Sanghai Noodles,Burnt Ginger Fried Rice,Chicken in Hoysin Sauce and Cantonese Fish were present in Chinese Section..Hoysin Chicken tasted superb,spicy and tangy in a red gravy..Cantonese fish was a white gravy and lacked proper seasoning..Noodles were good too..
Desert: Malpua and Pudding tasted better..also loved Kiwi Mousse,it tasted different..based on a green mango jelly..Ibo slice and House Special Cake was nothing great..Overall this section dissappoints me..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 2/5
Ambiance: 5/5

Worst restaurant to spend your money on. Plates were cold and had dirty brown stains. When brought to manager notice he said the plate is clean but the stains were coming from inside. Worst third rate restaurant in kolkata. Staff are incompetent. Lack basics courtesy. Dont know how to serve food even. Ordered something else and recvd something else and when told the waiter that it is not what we ordered he started arguing. And he charged us for it even though we didnt eat any of it. Ambience was poor. Third rate overall. Pls avoid if you wish not to pay good money just to spoil your mood.

#Groupon #HHI #Mythh #PoorHospitality 

I want to share a feedback and a terrible experience that we had to undergo when we redeemed a voucher purchased at groupon. This voucher was for snacks and drinks at Mythh - HHI, Kolkata.

The staff at the restaurant were rude, un-courteous and made the guests feel like they are free-loaders, just because they had a groupon voucher. They were made to sit in a corner couch outside the restaurant (not inside the restaurant) and once the food was served there was no staff to attend to them. The food was also way below average - cold and stale.

Just because they have groupon vouchers doesn't make them any less important and doesn't give you the right to mis-treat them and make them feel like they are unwelcome. If Mythh - HHI has such inhibitions about guests buying groupon vouchers and visiting them, they should get themselves de-listed from this website.

This is a terrible experience that no guest should be made to go through by a member of the hospitality industry. I advice Groupon to take strict action against HHI and remove them from their website.

Went there with the offer of Groupon and had a buffet lunch. To start with the food that day was exceptionally good, there was a lot of varieties of it starting from Indian and Chinese to continental as well. The thin crust pizza could have been better. But none the less meeting friends over a buffet with 2 complimentary drinks was more than welcome. Would like to visit again.

Yesterday at dinner time after completing my meal.. i went to try there dessert section which had an elaborate items displayed there and  group of flies were feeding themselves on it. It was looking so pathetic, being a 5 star property you are giving stale, unhyginic food to customers. I checked with the staff and asked them what if i complaint reagrding this to "HACCP" department. He replied "Sir do complain because people here dont worl properly and dont care about the hygine at all"
I am sharing some pictures here. Thought should make you aware first before sending it to haccp team.

The service is impeccable as always , it was 3 a.m when I had gone for food and the service like always was top class.

I ordered for biriyani as I was extremely hungry,I loved the way the spices were enriching ,the quality of the rice was good,even though could have been cooked better as they were a bit harder to bite through,the succulent pieces of boneless chicken had the right amount of spice in it which made up for a lovely dinner. 

Will be trying out further stuff here.... a second visit is due bigtime...

Every dish has been made with utmost care and the perfect taste has been brought forward.

One of the worst hotels to stay in ever. The most disgusting and stale food. Ordered for chicken starters in the room they came with dead flies as toppings which obviously was not in the menu "disgusting". While in buffet ordered for chocolate ice cream which had a piece of French fries in the scoop and the gulab jamun had hair in it. Nobody could care less just a sorry from the manager and that's it. The rooms are ancient as the doors don't lock properly the beds R too old and have bed bugs. The worst hotel I must have ever stayed in my life.

I went to myth yesterday for a buffet lunch. I had called and reserved a pool side table which made the experience better. The restaurant has a wide variety of dishes which comprises of oriental, continental and indian. To start off the soup was very good to taste followed by the salads and chars. I must say iv nvr had better salads in any buffet earlier. There wasnt much in starters just 2 veg n 2 non veg starters but all were pretty good. In main course I liked fish rogan josh but the biriyani wasnt good to taste. Infact all the dishes of fish were decent. The variety in non veg dishes were stuck to fish n chicken n had nothing else hence main course were not that attractive. For desserts they had amazing malpuas and mud cake which I absolutely loved and quite a few more to name all were rich in quality and decent in taste. They also had pizza and pasta which had to be ordered and though the pizza wasnt according to my taste, I loved the spaggeti in red sauce. They had served us 4 mocktails out of which the aam panna flavoured and stawberry with tobasco sauce were my favourite. 

To bring to an amazing end the staff serving our table "Ajay" brought us a black forest cake from his behalf as it was my hubby's birthday. So we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and are looking forward to visit there again in the near future.

Mythh is the 24 hours cafe/bar located inside Hotel Hindustan International. My dad is a big fan of HHI for some reason, hence I have been visiting the hotel since childhood for especially during occasions like X-mas and New Year.

Recently on a visit to HHI, I decided to try out Mythh. The ambiance is very subtle yet classy. The bar is right at the entrance and the dining area around it. I seated myself at the bar on high bar stools which had leopard printed upholstery :P 

I noticed that there were some packages on offer like beer buckets and combo of burger with beer pints. These combos are  very well priced for a 5 star restaurant. A bucket of 5 Tuborg pints cost Rs 899+ tax. 2 pints of beer with a snack costs Rs 749+ tax. 
There are other attractive combos as well. The bar man Amit was very polite and friendly. Usually Mythh does not offer complimentary munchies along with beer but when I inquired about it they did serve me some roasted papad which is a very nice gesture. I did not try food here so I will reserve my comments about it. They do have buffet and sunday brunches which I will be trying out soon. 

This is experience at the Mythh was quite satisfactory and I would rate them a 4 as of now

We ordered alacarte.Food quality was nothing great, service was slow and the place wasnt very clean too. Shelling out a hefty amount for the experience was dissapointing. I feel the place is over-hyped.

I went to Mythh with my Project colleagues for an office party and availed the Groupon Buffet Dinner. We had very high expectations as it is the restaurant of HHI. But we were not very satisfied. The details are given below menu wise: Buffet Spread wise: Salads: 4 Veg Salads4 Non-Veg Salads-- I treid the Non-Veg Salads (ofcourse), they had a cold lamb salad to my liking and the others like russian salad, green salad and pasta salad was just about okay nothing great. Soups 1 Veg Soup1 Non-Veg Soup -- The chicken Coriander Soup was not very flavoursome, little chicken and no aroma of coriander, disappointing. Starters 2 Veg Starters2 Non-Veg Starters -- The fish in orange sauce was good for me but the fried chicken was very mediocre( i must mention the serving of starters in the counter was so slow that we were forced to move to Main Course.) Main Course 3 Indian Non-Veg Main Course (including biryani) -- Mutton was bad and chewy/ Biriyani was less than average/ Chicken was okayish . 3 Oriental Non-Veg Main Courses -- Fish was good / Chicken was okay but less served/ there was noodles i guess dnt rememebr trying it. 2 Continental Non-Veg Main Courses -- Lamb was good less served again / Rice was okay had nothing to mention 1 Veg Fried Rice -- i didnt try 1 Veg Noodles -- i didn't try 2 Oriental Veg Main Course - mushroom, corn baked was the only fantastic main course dish , others didn't try 3 Continental Veg Main Course -- didnt try 3 Indian Veg Main Course -- didnt try 2 Indian Dal -- didnt try 1 Indian Veg Rice-- didnt try Desserts 8 Cold Desserts --- whether it was cheese cake, pastries, pannacotta, caramel custard, fresh cream cake, chocolate cake you name it , they have it and they nailed it!!! TRULY FANTASTIC 2 Hot Desserts --- Gulab Jamun nice but HOT BROWNIE MUD PIE ___ YUMMMYYYY! Selection of Ice Creams --- Fantastic From the kitchen Chef’s Choice of Pizza ---Thin crust, lovely toppings, good cheese-- Fantastic Chef’s Choice of Pasta --- Cooked to perfection and topppings whatever you choose! Fantastic The only way i survived through such a highly expected dinner was there DESSERTS section. They were mindbogglingly awesome!!! And only for the fish items, mushroom corn baked dish and desserts and the chef's special pizza and pasta my rating is given , others where pretty disappointing !

I along with nine other friends visited this place yesterday with a lot of excitement and expectations and were disappointed.
We had their buffet which though was well spread but lacked options for vegeterians.Most of the food kept was cold and half the containers empty.We had to repeatedly ask them to keep refilling it.The pasta also was undercooked and gave a rubbery feel.The dessert spread was large but didn't taste half as good as it looked.Though the staff was courteous and good the service was very delayed.
Overall it didn't give me a feel of a 5 star restaurant both in terms of quality of food and the service.

The restaurant/hotel had all the red flags - decrepit exterior/interior, indifferent wait staff, dirty linen. Unsurprisingly, I was served stale food. When I was able to eat my (replaced) meal, the food was ordinary. All this at luxury hotel prices. It seems like the hotel/restaurant is out of touch with reality - need to visit hotels in other parts of India to understand how service levels work. A regrettable experience.

I along with nine other friends visited this place yesterday with a lot of excitement and expectations and were disappointed.
We had their buffet which though was well spread but lacked options for vegeterians.Most of the food kept was cold and half the containers empty.We had to repeatedly ask them to keep refilling it.The pasta also was undercooked and gave a rubbery feel.The dessert spread was large but didn't taste half as good as it looked.Though the staff was courteous and good the service was very delayed.
Overall it didn't give me a feel of a 5 star restaurant both in terms of quality of food and the service.

The restaurant/hotel had all the red flags - decrepit exterior/interior, indifferent wait staff, dirty linen. Unsurprisingly, I was served stale food. When I was able to eat my (replaced) meal, the food was ordinary. All this at luxury hotel prices. It seems like the hotel/restaurant is out of touch with reality - need to visit hotels in other parts of India to understand how service levels work. A regrettable experience.

Before, I start, I spent 14000 for a lunch for two. It included a couple of steaks and three glasses of wine. So be very careful when you order wine. The wine, is not mentioned on the menu. If you order wine, enquire about the price. They will serve you the wine, and then when the bill comes, it will be 4k per glass. 

Apart from that, the service was decent. The food was good. The steak was cooked well. The fish we ordered was cooked well too. 
The ambiance was nice. I don't know but there was a very persistent magician showing some tricks at another table. Well he never came to our table. I did not understand why. I guess he gave us a peaceful lunch.

We went for team dinner for 70 members using Groupon vouchers. At the first impression you will like the ambiance of the hotel. Looks very classy and elegant. But the staffs responsible to attend guests are not at all trained and can’t manage guests like what we generally experience in 5 star properties.
We all know never to judge a book by its cover and this fits exactly for Mythh. The buffet spread is there by quantity buy by quality there is one word to describe, which is “horrible”. Still one may like the mini chat counter which is self-help but apart from that nothing will touch your heart. I still somehow preferred the hunan fish but rest tastes so bland. No spice or salt. Pizza prepared by them is tasteless vegetable topping on tandoori roti. Mocktails/coolers were just icecream scoop on top of soda inside 150 ml glass. 
Staffs don’t refill food once a particular item is over. One need to chase them repeatedly still it’s your luck if they acknowledge. HHI advertises live pizza and pasta counter but on enquiring the same they seemed clueless. One can easily understand there is nothing like this other than many words in the menu. 
On speaking to few other guests I realized that HHI does this intentionally during any discount offer gets published in internet. Very unprofessional mentality. I look for the restraunt manager Amitabha and even left message with a bar tender to meet me but as expected too much to ask. This is most horrendous 5 star dinner experience in my life and will not recommend anyone to go through this trauma.

Please never ever ever ever go to this place for dinner/lunch/breakfast/tea/coffee. It was suposed to be a 4/5 star place but it seems it has turned into a low cost destination for low level mamnagers, employees of companies to have their confernces. You will have to fight for your food at the buffeet tables. People will be standing at your head and having their dinner. Women family members were not feeling safe and were pushed around when trying to get food. It is as if the hotel guys are doing you a big favour by serving you. One has to keep asking for everything be it spoons or forks, water or drinks or asking for the food to get refilled at the counters. There is no pizza/pasta counters as advertised and you just get a cold shoulder when you ask for it. Total waste of money. Please aviod. THere are better places in Kolkata for sure.

I went there last week for a sunday bufet brunch with my parents. I simply loved the ambiance and the food. The huge buffet spread was a treat to the eyes...Loved the chicken and fish starters and also the main course. The desserts were simply yummy.  We also loved the voice of the singer who was singing live. The service was good and staff was courteous. Would love to go back over there.

Before I went there I was thinking to spending wonderful evening with delicious food. In reality it appeared to be an extremely average restaurant with, I would say, extremely average food variety and quality. Without any second thinking I can say its certainly not Kolkata's best place to dine in. In positive side, it's environment is good and service is pretty good. I enjoyed having Glenlivet, which may be the reason I loved being there.

Wanted to go to a place on our anniversary that would provide pretty much everything...i am a big lover of Indian cuisine, my wife, loves continental on the other hand.....so has been searching for some sort of a combination...and obviously something which will not pinch my pocket a lot too.....

Looked at a deal in groupon where the menu impressed me....bought it and called the restuarant to reserve a table for 2...it was Monday so anyways didnt expected a lot of rush...

We were welcomed and seated at a corner table right next to the pool....and then Ritban (the helpful guy serving at the table) showed us the entire buffet...and we started.....

The salads looked tempting...we tried the lamb and pineapple salad, the chicken and artichoke dices, the basa tempura and  the egg deviled with cocktail dressing...a little of each....all were pretty ok but the lamb and pineapple salad was excellent....succulent lamb slices with sweet pineapple was an excellent combo....

We tried the starters next....fish in oriental five spices and ajwani murgh tikka....both we good but a little cold so that was a bit of a put off.....the chandni panner was too good....it was actually made out of fresh cottage cheese and not the market bought paneer.....

In the main course, the mutton biriyani looked average and so it was when we tasted it, the fast food joints outside dishes out much more tastier one....the chicken rojan too was okk and nothing special....and then we went for some continental main course....they served fish in white sauce and it was really amazing...the fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce too was not too thick which generally is the case in buffets.....and lamb chops....which was a bit above ok....the meat should have been more tender as we struggled to get it off the bone with our fork and knife but the sauce was tremendous....

In the meanwhile, Ritban already served me a couple of chilled tuborg and a nice looking mocktail for my wife.....i took some more serving of fish and got some garlic roasted breads for me and she ordered for a spaghetti carbonara with bacon.....again, it was done very well and served in our table.....finally we went for desserts....there were around 12 desserts and i tried 6 of them....the gulab jamun, rasmalai, chocolate tart, lemon soufle, apple crumble and cheese cake...yes, i eat a lot :)) but they were worth the extra calories i put on for the day....only the apple crumble was very dry but others were very good again....

We were too full and done....it was a great experience......ver good food, though there are scope for improvements but buffets will never be life alacarte...so i m ok....i give 3.5 to food.....excellent and courteous service, i will 4.5 to it.....and a 4 to a well spread buffet which i think is more than worth the money i spent there....i paid 1700 online for all that we ate along with the drinks and was so happy that called them to give me a bill book where i can put in some tips as well.....

This discounted offering is only till 1st Jan and can be a delightful outing......Thanks to Groupon and HHI for making my anniversary special and to Zomato to express my experience...

Courteous service is the first and foremost aspect I loved about Mytth. On my visit, I came to know that their live pizza counter was not working. On informing their brand manager Amitava, he was prompt and helpful enough to arrange for risotto instead. This remains one of the high scoring points of my birthday treat that I gave my friends here. 
Secondly, being left to ourselves at our own ease and comfort but been attended to when needed was a true pleasure. We were also allowed to access the pool side whenever we wanted. A lovely bengali adda over beer by a poolside can never go wrong. :)
Thirdly, coming to the real deal about food, it is definitely one of the good buffets in town. The lamb stew, pasta, varieties of breads and risotto deserve special mention amongst the menu. Oh, the pasta was awesome. I can not recall having this good a pasta elsewhere. The desserts were okay, in fact I was expecting better! 
Fourthly, if one is looking for a good evening in town, I shall definitely recommend Mytth without thinking twice.
This has been my second visit to Mytth. I had a la carte oriental cuisine here on my first visit which was impressive enough. This second visit after a year just made it one of my favourite places in town.

Kudos to the restaurant manager (Mr.Hari I believe) and the Brand manager (Mr.Amitava) for giving us the worst 5 Star experience ever. We stepped in for a morning meeting at Mythh and promptly informed the staff that we will not be opting for the buffet breakfast, and will instead be having a la carte. We were seated in the regular area but as more members walked in, we were casually (and voluntarily) directed to a private room. We were handed over the menu cards and 2 minutes later, somebody walked in to take the order. We informed them to come in after 5 minutes. For the next hour, nobody came to take the order meanwhile we continued with our meeting. An hour later, I requested someone to come in and take the order. We placed the order and 5 minutes later, the manager walked in to have a word with me. He said that since we had been sitting there for an hour without ordering anything, we will have to pay a cover charge of Rs.5000/- plus tax for 7 of us. I was shocked to hear this in a star rated hotel like HHI and especially since we had already placed our order of one fresh lime soda each . I expressed my disbelief and displeasure at such treatment and he finally agreed saying he will charge me for what we have consumed. We finished our drinks shortly thereafter and asked for the bill. Upon not receiving the bill for 5 minutes, we proceeded to pay the same at the counter where the manager was standing. Again, he asked me, 'aap hi bataiye ab kya karna hai?' What ensued was a baseless argument for ten minutes where he insisted that we pay Rs.5000/-, despite this not being informed or even hinted to us at all earlier. Along with him, was Mr.Amitava, in full support and defence of his colleague. We finally left after paying. If this is how they are going to treat their customers, its hard to imagine how much longer they will last. Forget a five star, I would be aghast at such treatment even in a regular coffee shop. They sure have lost out a whole bunch of customers with such behavior. I'm not sure about the regular fare, but stepping in for a coffee meeting is an ABSOLUTE NO-NO!

Went for the first time to this place. N trust me I wasn't disappointed. Good ambience. We were quite a few so we reserved a private room that they have facing the pool.  The Decor of the room was nice and cosy away from the hustle bustle of the rest of the open space. Had a sort of a private attendant to ourselves which was more than appreciated. The mocktails ordered were refreshing and fresh. 
Paneer tikka was awesome. They had utapam like cute little biscuit sizes.  The crispy chilly baby corn was ok. Could have been better. The kiwi and chocolate pastry were pretty good. A good and soothing view from the corner private room of the pool in d rains was Pretty much all that it needed to complete the meal. The weather was just perfect not to be indoors so we even enjoyed a part of our meal near the poolside :)
Overall a Nice experience after a stuffed meal :p. Considering it was my first visit to this place. I would certainly Consider it another time ;)

Mythh, the 24 hrs.outlet seems to be a balanced restaurant in terms of both its food and service, a spacious all day dining has good choice of both indian and international cuisine.

We went on a Sunday Dinner and it was worth it, tried their buffet and found all the food flavoursome and tasty.

This is my favourite place in Town-so allow me a little bias.

Food is better then most places in Kolkata-and most of it is authentic.Especially the Italian food-will vouch for the Pasta's they serve here.

What also sets it apart is the personalised care and attention the managers give you,and the care and attention to detail.

Mythh,the 24 hour restro in HHI,serves both a la carte and buffet.The whole restaurant cum coffee shop has got a western touch to it.The ambience is soothing ,but try to grab a table beside the windows from where one can get a view of the pool.If one decides to go for a la carte,then there are varied options to choose from - Italian,Pan-Asian ,Indian etc.I would say,the menu is 70% international,though i ordered indian both the times i visited the place.The indian kebabs are damn succulent and it just melts in your mouth,especially,the tandoori murgh and murg malai tikka and is surely gonna satiate the taste buds of all kebab lovers.In the main course,both naan and kulchas are worth going for.The main course chicken items are palatable too.If you are a vegetarian,then Paneer is the one to go for.There is this Paneer Ap ki pasand where u can choose from various preparations of it.I had Palak Paneer and Paneer Butter Masala.I must say both of them were carefully cooked to perfection and tasted heavenly.On the hospitality front,i was not that pleased.Though the prices are a bit on the steeper side,but i think,its worth it.. Overall,i would rate it a 3.5

There is a positive vibe to this place and the ambiance is very infectious. It is one of the few places in Kolkata that offers a live performance. The buffet was excellent. The efficient staff catered to all our demands and even served us a complimentary chicken roast and a fish dish. it was a perfect experience!

Ate here last year once, loved their taste, they offered almost all cuisines in the buffet and it was really awesome. They had live counter for pasta and luchi. They have a nice ambiance and decoration, we sat by the pool and the staffs were really helpful.
