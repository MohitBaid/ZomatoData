Okay, so when I decided to visit Kolkata over Christmas the foodie in me was all happy at the prospect of appeasing my taste buds with some exciting new flavours. The very thought of trying bengali food had already made my mouth water not to mention authentic Momos at the China town
 So I did some research and asked one of my kol friends for recommendations. Among many other things, she suggested I try the famous Kolkata puchka. She also share a Facebook link which said this particular place makes some x varieties of Pani Puri aka puchka. So I asked my cabbie if he knew the place and as expected he was clueless. So I put on the Google map and set out on my culinary journey! And my parents were all excited when I told them this guy was popular on the social media. Naturally they expected it would be a huge place with loads of people. But when we finally landed at the Pani Puri stall we found a small cart with just two people rating there. My parents gave me a look as if to say 'really, this is the place?' types. But I got off the car and asked my driver too to give it a try. And let me tell you it was awesome. We went there around 4 and I thought thank God there was no crowd.but even as I thought about it there was flood of people who descended from nowhere. I tried almost every variety of puchka  possible and I highly recommend the dum aloo, ragdawala, schezwan and the usual Kolkata aloo poori. Chana chur too was too. There was chocolate too but I was in no mood to spoil my khattha meetha taste in my.mouth. a place worth visiting.
