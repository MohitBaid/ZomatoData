Yesterday i went to have starter. I had chickn pakora price 130/-, had Drams of heaven price 150/- for 6 pieces, the food quality is absolutely poor and rubbish. According to the price quality is proportionally down. Such a bad  food ever I had. Moreover when I tried to give them such feedback, they are behaving like such as an ill-mannered person. 
So I suggest please do not visit to Shivam, this is totaly wasting of money,time and taste buds

A simple pocket-friendly air-conditioned restaurant located at Haridevpur. The food is of good quality, specially the chicken tandoor, noodles and mixed fried rice along with chilli chicken. The ambience is better than any other restaurants in its area. I am a regular customer of this restaurant and having tried almost all the available food items I would surely rate it the best in this area. Banquet facility along with home delivery is available here. .

A normal streetside restaurant, the quality of fodd is not good. We ordered chicken biriyani and the chicken was half fried. They can work more on their ambience.

Nothing to talk about the ambience, its a normal street side, small, average eating joint. A single person manages the billing counter, orders, sitting arrangements all together, naturally everything proceeds slowly.  Food had absolutely no taste, it was not bland but I dont know how to explain the taste. The sauce used in gravies of chicken are of ch@eap quality, those used in street side roll stalls. Instead of being crisp- crispy chicken was jaw aching hard. For the first time I tasted 'hot' sweet lime soda which was neither sweet, nor salty nor there was any zing in the soda. You can say its pocket friendly, but paying 450 bucks for 2 over these tasteless food felt worthless.

This is a small family restaurant, located near Haridevpur Ajeya Sanghati club, offers a good range of Indian as well Chinese cuisines in the menu. I opted for Paneer Do Piaza and Fried Rice about a week back and taste wise it was just fine. Nothing fussy about the place when it comes to culinary delights, but a nice place for having a relatively cheaper lunch/ dinner.

After a hectic pandal hopping, we went there! 

It was bit crowded, due to pujo... 

We ordered fried rice and chilly chicken along with cold drinks! 

Ambience - 3/5

Food - 3/5

Services - 2.5/5


P.s : service is bit slow, they need to improve!

This eating joint serves mouth watering paneer buttermasala, mixed veggies, chicken bharta, tandoori chicken, and the biriyani is absolutely sumptuous. Albeit it was not airconditioned, but so is most of the famous eateries of the city. There is an immense value for money. The staffs are courteous, friendly, and lively. It is one of the best restaurant in the tollygunge area. Certain reviews have been made bashing the quality of the food, but i havent found any fault with it. At the rate charged by this diner the food is completely worth it. Moreover great news. Provisions for airconditioners have already been made.
