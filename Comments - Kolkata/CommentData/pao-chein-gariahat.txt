Its a good place to dine once in a while. You to go there a lot before. Food quality is good. Ambience and service can surely improve. Its easy to access. You can check it out. I hope it won't disappoint you. Over here food is what that actually matters.

The interior was not at all attractive. Even the utensils on which the food was served were of cheap quality. However, the primary parameter, which is the quality of food gets a good score. We ordered Veg Gravy Chowmein and Dry Chilli Chicken. Both were delicious. Quantity was moderate. Service was prompt. But as per the quantity and the decor, the price seemed to be a bit above reasonable. It was about Rs.650/two with taxes.

It was on the day of Ashtami during During Puja and we decided to have our lunch at this popular eatery in Gariahat - Pao Chien. It was located just beside the Standard Chartered Bank. The entrance was pretty ordinary and there were adequate seating arrangements inside. The decor is nothing special and the restaurant was fully air-conditioned. We ordered Vegetable Chowmein, Chilly Chicken (dry & gravy), Vegetable Fried Rice and Chicken Prawn Fried Rice. The taste of the food was okay and the quantity was sufficient for our family of four. The chilly chicken was okay but it was hard to differentiate between the dry chilly chicken and the one with the gravy. The prawn pieces in the chicken prawn fried rice was quite big and the quantity was good. 

Cons: The waiters never cared to serve the plates. They just dumped 4 tables, forks and spoons right in the middle of the table. There were no desserts in the menu and no cold-drinks even!

I visited this place during puja along with six of my colleagues. We stopped there to have our dinner while pandal hopping. A decent place with minimal interior. We ordered Chicken Rice and Chilli Chicken which was good enough with the taste in that rush period as well. However the Chicken corn soup was the worst that we have ever tasted. It was very starchy and we hardly had any Chicken flavour out of it. Overall it was a nice visit and is recommended as well to have main course.

A small restaurant opposite Spencers, Gariahat. This turned out to be a decent one though. Surprisingly, I found pork in the menu. Went for mixed Hakka noodles and hot garlic pork. The service was okayish. The food turned out to be excellent. 

The noodles was well made, with generous portions of meat. The quantity, I would say, isn't totally sufficient for two people. The Hot Garlic Pork was delicious. The meat was tender, with less of fat and more meat. The gravy was equally delectable. 

Overall, a great place for decent Chinese at a low pocket pinch.

A few weeks ago, I came to this place. It is a small restaurant, located at Gariahat, a few steps away from the Standard Chartered ATM bank. Has a simple outlook and simple interiors. I with my mother ordered Prawn Pakora, Mixed Fried Rice, Chilli Fish, Sweet Garlic Chicken for home delivery while had Dry Chilli Pork as an evening stomach filler. What a marvellous dish we had!! The service provided was good.
I would strongly suggest customers to try the Prawn Pakora, it is really a lovely preparation. Heard from many that it is a very old eatery, but has maintained high quality with passage of time. I would love to visit it again. Anybody willing to have quality Chinese should visit Pao Chien, very much recommended.

It located just near Hindustan Park.  Following the Standard Chartered ATM of Gariahat you can just find this restaurant in left hand side of the lane  They have sitting capacity of 30 - 35. They should work on the interior and branding I guess. But if you can compromise these area being a foodie it is just really awesome. Quality food with quantity. You just can't ask for even better when you can avail these in very pocket friendly prices. Hakka Chicken Noodles with Dry chilli Pork were really a combo to cherish. Ready to dive in here once again soon.

"A cozy little joint offering good Chinese at reasonable prices" , this is how pao chein has been marked in my mind. Located beside the Stan Char gariahat branch, this place came as a saviour to my "feed-me-NOW" tummy and fatigued legs (oh its gariahat, & u can't help but hop & shop !! :p ) .. About the food, I personally recommend their lung-fung soup. Honestly,I never expected such a fine soup with enough shrimps & chicken pieces from this tiny joint..our other orders were Mixed Hakka noodles /chili chicken and colas.. Overall food was satisfactory!

A small eating joint, serving good Chinese food.
The place is very easy to locate, it's near Gariahat Standard Charter Bank. The place servers very good affordable Chinese dishes all throughout the year. In puja time the place remain moderately crowded as compare to other restaurants in close proximity.
They are excellent in pork items as well, and our main target was the same, but sadly during puja they arrange special puja menu mostly consisting of chicken, egg, prawn.
After a bit heart break to see the special puja menu without pork, we ordered Chicken Prawn Fried Rice, Chicken Gravy Noodles, Sezwan Chicken.
The quality and taste of the food was as usual great. The gravy noodles was thick and was loaded with veggies and chicken strips, the chicken prawn fried rice was also delicious and the sezwan chicken had bite size chicken pieces and was also tasty.
For the puja only they had a special limited choice menu and the price was Rs 30 more for each dishes.
Puja or No Puja, this place is good for affordable Chinese serving pork items.

If you are low on budget and  struck with hunger after a shopping spree around Gariahat or worn your legs out,hopping pandals during the Pujas,this my friend,is the place to go.
Exterior looks like a pay and use toilet.
The inside of the restaurant is quite decent and tidy.
Getting to the main part,it offers some nice Chinese,which is rather spiced up.
The chowmein and the Hakka are moderate and would do a good job to fill your stomach.
The Friedrice failed to impress me.
The chilli chicken was way top spicy  but my taste buds did take that in easily.
Over all,not a 'must visit' kind of place,but good enough to give you,your low on budget money's worth.

This particular restaurant has been around for a long time and is situated in the lane beside the Gariahat branch of Standard Chartered Bank. It is a very simple and basic restaurant serving Chinese cuisine. I am unable to comment on the non veg items on the menu for which all Chinese restaurants are generally known for. Wit regard to the veg options which I had, it was limited to the noodles, fried rice and the veggies. All were ordinary, nothing extraordinary but still nothing to really complain about. Would I visit again? That I'm not too sure about!!

Situated beside Gariahat Standard Chartered bank unit, this is a chinese eatery with comfortable seating arrangement and a pretty extensive menu. I went there once with a friend and ordered Chicken hakka noodles and Chilli pork gravy. Both the dishes were below average in taste as well as quality. Prices are reasonable, although one would get better quality and more delicious food at many nearby restaurants and so I guess the place was relatively empty. The place had an air of nonchalance and this turned me off. The authorities should take the advantage of their prime location and buck up their service.@

Well, well, well. Sometimes, old is actually gold.

At a time when a number of old favorites have lost their charm and are basically running on reputation alone, Pao Chein keeps serving excellent food calmly and quietly.  Tucked away neatly at a small gully near Gariahat, this old favorite is still a place where you can get great food without frills at pocket-friendly prices. The interior isn't what most would consider spacious or well-decorated, but again, this place is all about the food and not the frills.

Having tried a large selection of their rice and noodle dishes, it is safe to say that this is standard fare, but definitely above-average in the taste department. Ordering a non-veg option ensures that you get enough meaty bits on the plate to munch. Of special note is the chilly chicken and chicken in garlic sauce, which are balanced, composed dishes with chicken pieces that have just that hint of crisp outside (the coating is paper-Thin, unlike at some places) and juicy, tender meat inside, all immersed in a flavorful sauce that does not contain humongous pieces of distractions like large onion or bell pepper chunks. A lot of people have griped about this, but I find it a welcome change.

Ideally, one should not leave Pao Chein without trying their stellar roast pork, which defies expectation. You get moist, juicy pieces of Pork, which taste incredible. The pork seemed to fall apart at the touch of a fork, which is something that most places serving pork cannot accomplish, ending up with stringy, chewy meat. Another plus about this dish, and the other pork dishes served here, is that they use primarily lean meat, but also contain a hint of fat which pork lovers adore. I have found the meat, fat ratio to be way off in certain other places, but here you are sure to get just the right mix.

I would suggest taking out the time to go visit this place at least once, and the food should then speak for itself. I am happy that Pao CheinÂ takes itsÂ business seriously and is not content just to slumber on its "old favorite" status, but instead keeps making people like me happy with great food.

We ordered veg n chicken soup,veg gravy noodles and canton chicken.  Soup and noodles were good . Canton chicken tastes similar to chilli chicken with little more soya sauce.  No tax is charged.  Overall pocket friendly restaurant. I will be visiting it again

My memories with Pao Chein is always associated with the Durga pujo, nostalgia and meeting up with school friends annually. With throngs of people on the road, we have no other place to it than this tiny eatery in one of the bylanes of Gariahat, hidden away from prying eyes. I was actually immensely thankful to the restaurant owner for not kicking out our huge gaggle of youngsters from different aspects of life making a ruckus like 5 year old children despite being wellpast college, rather they found our antics extremely amusing. We ordered mixed fried rice and Hakka noodles with Thai chicken. The quantity was aplenty, and though I don't prefer Indo Chinese dishes I found their food to be pretty enjoyable.Coupled with the happiness of seeing childhood friends after a lengthy hiatus it was indeed a lovely luncheon

Age old place serving chinese...but where are the flavours...
Ambience is a bit shabby..burdened with age..
The chicken mushroom soup was average..i have never seen a bowl of soup overloaded with so many veggies..overdoing stuffs doesnt make it taste better..the mushroom and chicken were rather cornered due to unnecessary overuse of veggies..
The chicken hakka noodles garnished with loads of oil tasted very bland..the ingredients were present but the flavours did not work..
Now the chilli pork ..i had to munch 4 pieces just to confirm where is the pork exactly..pork being one of my fav proteins..i was very disappointed...the dissociation of flavours in this dish pointed out that the pork was just fried and released on a seperate gravy..sad experience overall..

Frankly speaking if you are short of cash but wanna enjoy good Chinese food, then this is my friend your type of place. Very minimal decoration of this average place where you can have your food, without compromising the taste you like.
Very easy to locate, just in case can use google map. Pocket pinch as already mentioned very minimal compared to other places in the same area.
P.S. No pictures because there was nothing so special to click pictures of.
Chicken in garlic sauce is recommended.

It was much before Zomato started operating in Kolkata, when I tried Pao Chien for the first time. Hence, one can guess why the review is still pending. :)Â 
Finally, circumstances made me visit the outlet for a quick snack on last Saturday, and after so many years seeing the place getting a complete makeover made me nostalgic. The place however seemed gloomy inside.Â 
Coming to the food, we order Chicken Thai Soup, Pao Chien Special Gravy Noodles and Chilli Chicken Dry. The soup had an amazing taste and was brilliantly cooked with full of veggies, eggs, mushrooms and chicken, which was coming up in every spoon we pulled up the bowl to slurp. The gravy noodles had generous portions too with stuffs overloaded. However, the taste was ordinary and had a tad more soya into it. The side dish, Chilli Chicken, was what I opted for after seeing its color and texture on the other table (bad manners though) ! :) But it miserably failed to live upto my expectations. I have never had a dish so rich blackish in color with pretty good amount of oil and chillis with having any taste whatsoever. The only good point about it though is that, the chicken boneless pieces were very soft and juicy.
The pocket pinch was a bit high going by its set up. I personally feel that Pao Chien, before the make over delivered better in terms of quality than what they do at this moment. Overall, an okayish experience and I wish to visit some other time in order to taste the other dishes in their hatchet. Till then, Cheers to the team !

Since it holds a good nostalgic element for me, I'm so fond of this place. Even though the food nor the decor is anything great. 
Decent staff there, always been so.
They've maintained the quality of their food which is delicious. I personally like it. 
Be mainstream while you go for the orders as their menu has not much variety. Chicken Hakka Chow, Chilli Fish.. That's my call every single time.

This truly is a hidden treasure nestled in a lane of Gariahat. Had been there several times, after long shopping sessions at Gariahat, ears ago. 

However, dropped by again last week with friends. The Roast Pork was dark, luscious, sticky and the fat was rendered perfectly. The Chilli Fish was pretty good too but their Mixed Gravy Noodles bowled me over. It had the perfect smoky flavour and the best gravy noodle I have had in a very long time. 

Have to visit this place more often, definitely.

I've tried the chicken Pakora, hot and sour chicken soup, mixed hakka chowmein, chicken and prawn friend rice, chilli chicken and each item has been amazing perfect with taste and quantity. Their pork however deserves special mention be it roasted chilli pork or chilli pork gravy, probably one of the best pork I have had in kolkata. The staff is very friendly, service is quick, decor is simple yet nice cozy ambience and the best part they don't have any taxes!! Yes no service tax or any other taxes!! A must visit for all Chinese lovers. You will love it and keep visiting again and again!!

The name brings back loads of childhood memories. Situated in an alley on gariahat, it is a really wonderful restaurant that I've been going to since I was a kid. The ambience is nice. Has good seats, is air-conditioned and spacious up to a certain point as well. This is one of those places that you hope never closes down. The quantity in each plate is a lot! I've never been able to finish an entire plate of fried rice or noodles! Either made someone else have it (which was hardly the case) or packed it (mostly the case). Quality of the food served is great and they don't take long to serve as well. And the price won't burn a hole in your pocket either!

Small restaurant at Hindustan Park just beside Standard Chartered Bank .You can satisfy your taste buds with great authentic Chinese food especially chili pork.
Nice ,simple and minimalist decor gives it neat and clutter free look.

An age old joint. The name itself is suggestive of the authenticity of the cuisine available here. Now this one has to be targetted when you are in and around gariahat and chinese is what your heart desires. 

Location : Reach gariahat. Head towards hindusthan park through new punjabi stores lane. Walk for a few seconds. There lies pao chein

Decor : very simplistic decor with 10 four-seaters. The chairs are bit uncomfortable though, difficult to reach to the tables. A few wind chyme and fengshui cats made prominent the food being served.

Ambience: the dimly lit joint added to the mood. I just wish some music was played. Although it quite did not matter when good food was the major concern.

Staff: the restro is owned by a Chinese man. The staffs are well versed with the menu, quite active. Although I did feel they were quite reluctant given to the popularity. 

Coming to what we went in for-
Food:
We took in quite basic food.

1. Chicken sweet corn soup - to begin with , the soup was authentic. Tasted amazing. Portions were decent. Although I wish there were a few morr sweet corn

2. Pao chein special noodles - this was again one of the better authentic gravy chowmein that I have had after tung naam. The noodles amazingly fried and then put to gravy which made it evoke the taste buds further. The portions were huge. So , must try.

3. Chilli fish dry - to team up with the gravy chowmein, chilli fish dry is an amazing choice. The fish pieces were soft and superbly tasty. The burnt garlic flavour further added to the flavour. Definitely thumbs up.

The bill was really easy on the pocket.

So whenever it has to be amazing chinese at an affordable end, and ofcourse you are nearing gariahat - Pao Chein is the place to hit in.

I was suggested by a friend to visit this place. It's a bit hard to reach the location. You need to take a left while coming from Gariahat into the lane beside HDFC bank. With a small entrance it doesn't really make a significance.
When inside, I knew what I had to eat. I was suggested to have a dried chilli pork with American choupsuey. The service was slow, the staff weren't really friendly rather it was just one guy doing everything, the place not really clean and not at all maintained. The food came in and to the surprise it was amazing. The chilli pork was beautiful, really soft and very well cooked. I loved the food and the charges weren't really high as well. So I'm a satisfied customer if we're only talking about food.

For a long time I was torn between 3.5 and 4. Well, the reason for my doubt is that I have only ever tasted two dishes at this place, and I have been going back for years only for them. Except those, the only dish I have ever tried is the Chicken Fried Rice, and heaven knows that all Chinese joints in Kolkata maintain a minimum quality for their fried rice. Hence, my rating is based purely on these two dishes, though I suspect the other stuff wonâ€™t be bad.

My tryst with Pao Chien started much later than others, when a friend fed me some of the best Chili Pork and told me that it had been parceled from his dadâ€™s favorite pork place in Kolkata. It was delicious and I made a mental note of asking him for the location later. As I found out, the place is located right inside the lane next to Standard Chartered Bank at Gariahat, and it exudes the aura of an old school Chinese joint. I entered and ordered for the two dishes â€“ Chili Pork and Roast Chili Pork â€“ and the rest has been history, as I go back time and again for those.

The Chili Pork is made with deep fried prok cubes in a light soya sauce and spring onions whereas the Roast Chili Pork is sliced roast pork with more soya, garlic and green chilies. One bite and you are straight into porky heaven! Both the dishes are so different yet equally delicious. Oh, how I miss the Pao Chien pork here in Mumbai! Finger lickinâ€™ good, and if you are in Kolkata and are a pork lover, this is a must try. I hope they keep it up.

This place was established almost 40 years ago in the heart of Gariahat. My bf convinced me to go there and try pork. I am not much a pork person but it was absolute delight.. First we ordered soup and a Roasted chilli pork. The pork was really good. Then we ordered a chilli garlic prawn , Hakka mixed noodles and Dry Chilli Chicken with bones .  By the end of the meal we were full. Both the quantity and quality was equally good. The interiors are ok. Later we came to know that the owners are same as the ones of Hong kong in Kakurgachi.. Thats why we understood the reason for the quality.. Overall the experience was good.

A great Chinese food joint that a lot of people really aren't aware of. One of my favorite places is Pao Chien. If i have a sudden craving for tasty Chinese and not much money in my purse, Pao Chien is where i go. Chicken sweet corn soup, Chicken fried rice, Chicken hakka noodles, Dry Chilli chicken, Prawn in garlic sauce, Lemon Chicken... All these dishes are just excellent. Their Chicken Fried rice and Dry chilli chicken are simply scrumptious and a must-try. The ambience isn't much, but they have a clean and hygienic atmosphere which is more than good enough. A perfect place for students. Service is good. Highly recommended. Ting! :-)

It would be a crime not to review this once favourite food joint of my father and mine.
I have started loving Chinese food ever since I tasted the food taken from here, i.e. Since my childhood. We never ate here, maybe because it is very near to our home, but have always taken parcels from here.
Back then it was the property of a smiling Chinese lady. She would just nod and smile and take orders and get them packed and delivered to us. Time changed, and with it, the joint changed hands. We too stopped going there for reason I can't recall now. As I often passed it by, I noticed how shabby it has become. 
Then one day I went in with a friend.I ordered pork sweet and sour and mixed chow mein. The place was indeed shabby, the staff untrained, but the food won my heart. Later from the reviews of other foodies, I realise that pork has become their speciality. Good.

Pao Chien is an age old restaurant, it has recently undergone a huge change both food and place wise. 
This place is just off Rash Behari Avenue and very near to Fab India, Gariahat. The look of the place is rather disappointing and the seating area small.. There's no decor as such, small tables and chairs here and there but the quantity of the food is humongous. 
On a busy weekend, quite late at night my sister convinced me to have Chinese instead of my usual roomali roti/tadka from a nearby joint so we ordered for an egg fried rice and a schezwan chicken (cost : Rs.350 ) I was rather grumpy because it has been years since we have ordered from here and I didn't trust the food would be any good. I was literally surprised when I had their food! It's super delicious, the egg fried rice is quite flavourful and the chicken soft and succulent with an exotic gravy! The quantity was such, that four of us could eat and was quite full. This is a very underrated place and I would request people to try out their food, it's really good. One shouldn't judge a book by its cover and pao Chien is that book, it might not please your eye but it will surely please your palette and even your pocket! Give this a try you won't be disappointed it's my personal guarantee.

This is a very old Chinese joint at the heart of gariahat. It may seem that the price are bit higher with the ambience, but food quality and quantity is good.
Don't expect great quality food, but  standard food. But the quantities they deliver are enough. 
They have only one man to serve all the tables so it is hard for him to attend all the tables.
If you are looking for a standard quality food to fill your appetite, this is the place.

The food may look a bit overpriced but the quantity of food they serve compensates for the price. One fried rice is way more than enough for one person. The interior looks more like a Chinese restaurant than some other places. The staff are friendly and courteous. Some fish items are often available but apart from that this is the best place to eat in South Kolkata when you have less money in your pocket and haven't eaten properly for a week.

Went down yesterday.
With my dad and my boyfriend.
As my dad claimed it to be an amazing food joint.
So we ordered 2plates of mixed gravy noodles.
1garlic chicken
1chilli prawn.


The noodles was okaish with fat noodles. The garlic chicken was just too sweet (sugary)
The chilli prawn was a complete disappointment. It seemed like it was refrigerated for a month minimum.
It tasted horrible and had later effects.
Our bill was-INR750
Dishes came in all steel plates.
Not very friendly staffs.
Its always empty
 Totally dissatisfied.

This is a very good restaurant serving decent value for money. All the items are rightly priced and are tasty enough. The place has been recently refurbished and has been turned to an AC joint. Its a popular place for takeaway items and for all Gariahat market hoppers looking for a quick bite. One good thing about this place is they serve pork items which is rare in most of the Chinese restaurants in the locality. Try out their roast pork or chilli pork which are simply delicious.

Not long ago, Pao Chein of Gariahat used to be a very popular restaurant for Chinese delicacies. The food served back then was authentic and genuine Chinese fare. But the food being prepared now is barely decent and tolerable fare. The prices that the restaurant commands for such poor fare are simply unacceptable. The decor remains much the same; ordinary and plain looking. The ambience is not something to praise about. The service can be clumsy and slow at times; often bordering on incompetency. 

The dishes are no longer flavorsome and tasty as they once were. The fare is acceptable for consumption and is otherwise filling if you have no other option. To be fair the food quality is fair and leaves no room for complaint on a good day.  Among their soups, the ones that are worth ordering are their chicken hot and sour soup, Thai soup and pork noodle soup. These are soups which are still well prepared and have great balance of flavours in them. The common flavours of their Thai soup (spiciness, saltiness, sourness and sweetness) are all evident and are very prominent. Similarly, their pork noodle soup contains a generous amount of pork and noodles that are long and thick. Apart from pork soup, they also serve pork meat for staples like fried rice and chow (both Hakka and gravy). They also make a couple of reasonably edible standalone pork dishes like roast pork, sweet and sour pork, and Sichuan pork. 

Their vegetarian side dishes are a poor match for their rice and noodles options. Mention can be made (warily) of maybe dishes like Manchurian vegetables and sweet and sour vegetables. Though they charge sky rocketing prices for their food, do not expect desserts at the end of the meal.

Pao Chein was the once a very famous Chinese food joint in gariahat! It lies in one of its lanes and is mostly empty these days! Pao chein has few loyal customers who still visit but it has suffered a downfall for a lot of reasons! This place has a smell of an Old Chinese joint to it! More or less comfortable decor. Staff turns out to be a little confused at times. 
They do not serve extremely good food, but more or less decent food. Their service is very slow! They serve everything on the menu. But taste wise food is not good at all! However their quality of food is good. Now the worse part is they have increased their prices higher than what would match their served up food! Try conventional,usual stuff if you happen to visit. Their soups are tolerable! Also the quantity served will be good as well! Try it once ;) Have fun!
