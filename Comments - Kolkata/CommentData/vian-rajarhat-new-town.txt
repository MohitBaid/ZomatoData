Well this restaurant has opened up here newly, taken many (Take Away) food deliveries from this place and had many items from it's menu card!
The food over here is totally worth every penny of it as respect to it's taste & quantity.
Today, after a great Pandal Hopping of Sasthi, Durga Puja, 2017. Me with my friends visited here as per my recommendation though in starting they were not at all comfortable with this restaurant but slowly by it's service and co-operation of the restaurant staffs / waiters they started to like it and the all good feels goes high-up by the food they serve with it's tasteüòã
Ordered #ChickenBiryani #ChickenKasha #MixedFriedRice & #ChilliChicken!
But every dish as mentioned above is fine except the one & only the 'Chicken Biryani' as we ditched Arsalan though the real reason for it was the long waiting time for the table due to this massive Durga Puja crowd.
So, the 'Chicken Biryani' was not upto the mark as we've expected itüòê
So there is the scope for the restaurant to do something here for the improvement.
Rest all is good‚ò∫

I ordered veg spring roll and Whole Tandoori Kolkata Bhetki Masala. Everything was delicious and up to the mark. They delivered on time. I was mistaken about the pieces of fish, hence 1 star that i had rated, later I found out the pieces were ok and hence this amendment.

New restaurant baby in chinar park with great ambience and courteous staffs. It was a great experience in Vian. Had went on Independence day with friends. They have offered 15% discount on total bill. Food quality was good and delivered quickly to table. Had disc type lighting makes your experience move livable. Hopefully they have plan to add it later. looking forward to same experience and discount offers again.
