Located near Hindustan Sweets- New alipore outlet, this eatery is located on the right while going towards Tollugunj Phari.

One of the best eatery in the area that serves quality food at pocket friendly rates with an array of chinese, mughlai cuisines.

Would suggest the Biriyani lovers to try out their mutton biryani - rice is moist and mutton perfectly cooked, tastes very delicious and chicken bharta (rich creamy gravy) is just amazing.Don't miss to try out their soft and juicy chicken kebabs.

All the best Swadisht team !!!

Swiggy makes it everything easy.
Provided u are ordering it from a good restro.
If you are low on pockets and really need to have something to satiate your afternoon hunger pangs,this place is the one you should have in ur bucket list .
I ordered for a chicken biryani,an egg biryani and 2 chicken kebab Rolls and everything for just rs.250.YES YOU HEAR IT RIGHT :') AND BELIEVE ME THE QUANTITY WAS TOO GOOD AND QUALITY AWESOME.
THEY ARE FITTING WELL WITH THEIR TAG LINE
"HEALTH BHI
TASTE BHI"
Swadist made my afternoon.

The quality doesnt compete its name. One of the pathetic biriyani i experienced.. Not even at par with street food joint.And along with they also didnt provide a spoon which i ask to provide on time of delivery.

The food is just horrible out here had ordered a chicken meal, the rice in the biryani was dry and oily... The chicken pieces did not look like chicken pieces.... They should shut down the place and save the people from some horror...

I tried thier speciality Reshmi tikka masala, it was definitely a fresh alternative to regular butter chicken.  I loved it. The biryani combo was a delight to my pocket!

Today i tried chicken mughlai paratha through swiggy home delivery. 
Delivery was quick. 
It was average. 
It could have been much better in taste.
