I am writing the review after my mother came back from the shop with some bitter experience. This is a very reputed shop in our locality with great taste. But something happened today which is not expected from them. Firstly they kept my mother unattended for long time. Probably as she ordered for only 250 grms "mishti doi". When she asked again to give the item stating that "ki byapar onekhon dariye achi to" one of the staff simply said,"dariye achen? Tahole bosun".after that another staff started blabbering some stupid wrds. These kind of unprofessional behavior is not expected from a sweet shop having good reputation.hopefully the manager/owner will go through this review and will take care so that this kind of incidents do not occur often. I am giving the rating for their unprofessional behavior. No complaint about food.

By far the best rosogolla in Kolkata n howrah region. Yes, I have considered all the big shot as K. C. Das, Nabin Mayra, Amritam, V.N., Mallik Bros. Mahesh moyra. But for the rajbhog segment no one stands neerby. All the other sweets are also above standard. N specially the sweet card. But "The Rajvog" is just heavenly.

Oh wow!!! This is great. I got addicted to it since I got a rosogolla treat here. And believe me, then after I almost every day brought myself rosogollas and gulab jamuns here. The chocolate mishtis available are really catchy.BUT This has been the best for ROSOGOLLA ND GULAB JAMUN!!!

This is the best sweet shop arround. Yup, though the price is on a bit higher side, the quality of sweets on offer here is excellent.
Centrally located, right on the  corner of the main street.
The rush will always be there for such a place who maintains its hihh standards and the sweets are always fresh.

I have always believed that Bengal never gets its sweets wrong. Located near shalimar railway station in shibpur, I came accross this sweet shop and the first thing that surprised me was the variety of sweets on display with each one looking fresh and tempting. The prices were very reasonable and I tried the chamcham , ras malai and kacha gola and all three were a delight to have. There were indeed fresh , tasty and not overly sweet. Further the shop was pretty neat clean and tidy. 
Overall was really impressed by my sample and would love to try it s other offerings when I am nearby.
