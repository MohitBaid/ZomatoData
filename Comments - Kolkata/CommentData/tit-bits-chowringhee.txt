A good place, has a lot of variety ranging from chats, dhoklas to roti subji ordered a la carte or thsli meals( only on weekdays).The taste of the food is good and it is good value for money. On the ground floor they have a counter selling sweets, chocolates and even snacks.
Had matar pattice served with two dips, very tasty
Also had Bella matar Puri with alu dum.
Kessria tea was also good.
Definitely recommended.

Visited the place for the first time. Its a veg restaurant. 
Though i am a non vegetarian but at times veg food is a bliss. 
The ambience is good. Had papri chart, raj kachuri, pav bhaji and lassi. All were damn tasty. 
And the restaurant offers a variety of dishes. One must pay a visit.

Saviour to early morning hunger pangs it was around 7:30 .They serve many types of vada paw ( Chinese, Cheese , Onion and Regular). I tried the regular one. The bun was extremely fresh the best I had. Vada was full of flavour Followed by red and green chutney which gives you sweet and spicy taste. Topped with fried chilly ( first outlet to give you fried chilly ) I could not resist thus ending up having two. However they serve subji kachori ,sandwich & pastry as well but vada paw didn't allowed me try anything else.

Verdict - Recommended ( didn't tried main course & other early morning offering)
Cons- You get addicted to vada paw ( End up having 2 or 3)

Tit Bits is located at Exide. After college, we decided to have some snacks and sneaked inside. They have a small yet prim and proper seating arrangement. The staffs are courteous and the service is prompt. The prices are a little on the higher side. Coming to the food, we decided to order a plate of Dahi Phuchhka.‚ù§ Errm, we weren't quite happy with the taste and felt that it could have been better. Anyway. :)

Tit Bits is situated near my college, around Exide More. This place is divided into three sections. A takeaway counter on the ground floor, with a shop beside it which sells sweets and packaged nuts and other sweet items, and a restaurant on top which serves pure vegetarian dishes. The vada pav which is sold from the takeaway counter is a hot selling product of Tit Bits. It's tangy and very tasty. I used to love it. I have also tried the pav bhaji from the restaurant and it's quite good too. Prices are moderate,service is a bit slow.

This place is just about OK for a quick Vada Pav on the go. It claims to be a restaurant, but it is actually a street food kiosk with an air con. It still serves the best bhel Muri in town. Recommended for all. It has added few more types of chaat items to its menu. The quality is good and well maintained. The location is great. Must visit for Chaat enthusiast.
The gujarati thali is also worth trying.

Tit bits is a nice "Jack of all trades" outlet. It works best as a quick bites place, but it's fine for a dine in as well. I'm a fan of the vada pav here. And the muri they give is also good. The quantity and taste are all reasonable and 1 should try it out. The only problem is that the seating isn't suitable for a family visit. As a hang out place, it's good enough.

Location-Chowringee,near shikshayatan college.

We have usually visited this place for a takeaway.After their makeover they have a small kiosk outside the shop which sell vadapav,a shop which sell sweets and packed food items and  a restaurant which serves pure vegetarian food and deals in several cuisines such as North indian,Chinese,Fast food etc.

Service-The service at this place is quite slow and need to be fastened.The man making vada pav sometimes get confused seeing too much order but the take away packaging is excellent.

Food-The food at Tit bits is finger licking.We usually have a  takeaway at this place.We have tried quite a few dishes from this place but what we liked the most was-
1:Onion Vada pav
2:Pav bhaji
3:Dabeli

Service-3.5/5
Food-4/5

This place is a must visit for their fast food.üòÉüòÉ

We had the pizza over here and trust me when I say this, even though veg that was one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted. The cheese to bread ratio was spot on. The sauce was just the right amount. They even served chips with the pizzas which was delicious add on. I recommend you to try the garden fresh pizza the next time you visit them.

This place is best known for its Vada Pav !
You can never get bored of it's taste. Situated opposite HHI, this place is mostly used for takeaway orders. The item is amazing plus the chilli in between the Pav makes it all the more better. 
However, lately they have made a restaurant just above the place where you can relax and order food. But shockingly, when we ordered Vada Pav it cost us Rs. 60 per unit whereas the same thing they give us at Rs. 25 per unit if we take a takeaway. 
It is just not acceptable. How can anyone keep such a vast difference in rate of the same food item between having it there and getting a takeaway. Not done !

Titbits (now Gokul Shree) has got a makeover now with the vada paw guy (alsp preparing chaat) inside the air conditioned shop and the restaurant upstairs serving the other stuff. 
Coming to the food, Vada paw is synonymous with titbits. They have the BEST vada paws ever. With the new menu, they have now included more varieties like onion vada paw (this one is my second favourite) and mint mayo vada paw (which is also tasty but not worth 50 bucks compared to the regular 25). Their alu vada is super super crispy and that's what makes their regular vada paw a hot seller among students and office goers alike. Never cross exide without stopping for a vada paw at titbits! :D

Located at Exide Crossing at a stonethrow distance from the Rabindra Sadan Metro Station, this happens to be one of the most popular eating joints in this area. Purely vegetarian though, do not expect anything else out of this place. However, the quality of their food is pretty good and wouldn't leave you unsatisfied.

I have tried their Chola Batura and Paw Bhaji. Both were sufficient in quantity and had a distinctive taste of their own. The Bhaji as well as the Chola were super yummy. The only issue here is with the slow service and the notch high pricing. Hope, they make amends in time to compete with other nearby joints dealing in same venture!

Today, had the opportunity to buy stuff from this place after more than 5 years - one of the most traditional and respectable outlets of Calcutta.
¬†Came to know that this place has been acquired by the Gokuls! Nevertheless, I went for their USP items:- bhel puri and matar patties! On request,¬†all constituents of bhel were neatly and separately packed. Matar patties was fried live and parcelled. Bhel was overall tasty, but I have had better ones¬†previously at this place only! Papdi used in ¬†bhel was somewhat burnt - which however did not affect the taste much. Bhel looked beautiful when prepared.¬†
Coming to matar patties - it was a big disappointment because of the low quality peas used therein - something not expected of a place of this rapport!¬†Chutneys - as usual were fantastic, which forms the base for taste in their items. ¬†
Prices are high and staff¬†behavior¬†is good. They also have a restaurant upstairs where seating¬†arrangements are available!¬†Nice to see that they accept credit cards also.¬†Not to mention, this outlet is situated in a prime location, where anyways, they can expect huge revenue in-flow.¬†

Located just near the exide crossing,the address is 1,AJC bose road. Its on the AJC Bose road and Lord Sinha Crossing,beside the famous Kathleen on the corner.

It has a kiosk outside where you have access to Vada pav ( now they have different varities) and some canned juices,beverages etc. To buy anything from the kiosk you need to go inside and pay,in return they give you a slip which you need to give it at the kiosk.

It also has a retail joint on the ground floor and a cosy sitting on the mezzanine floor which is dimly lit and is generally never packed. Despite the space constraint they have a toilet as wellwhich i must say is very important for every restaurant.

They are also into outdoor catering which they started a few years back.

Coming to the food quality,this joint is a purely vegetarian outlet and food is classified below -¬†

Indian cuisine - Above average
Chinese cuisine - Well below average
Street food - above average
Mocktails - Average

The presentation of the food is not having the WOW factor or the GREAT factor,it is plain simple food served to you.No fancy decorations/presentations.

The staff are super busy in their own world and are not interested whether a customer needs anything or not. This i feel is the only place where they are lacking.

Pricing - For a outlet in a place in the business hub of Kolkata,the prices are very pocket friendly attracting mainly students from nearby coaching centres and colleges.

Must try - The indian thali they serve,is real value for money and enough for a persons lunch.

Why you should read this review? Because a purely hardcore non vegetarian's review on purely veg food has more depth than a purely vegetarian's review.
Well,for me a meal without meat is a snack. 
So as usual I was thinking of trying out a new eatery today in Exide. I don't know why I entered this restaurant but thank God I did. 
I ordered just a single thali. The Gujarati thali. It is sufficient for two people. The food is so awesome. I've rarely tasted such delicious veg food.
The dhokla was very soft and moist,theplas,the pulao,the subzis all were unbelievably good. And you should give their "buttermilks" a try.

The food was great and pocket friendly,the d√©cor has a caf√© type feeling,service were good too.
But the bad thing is that they don't have any washbasin,and the see-through glass doors are also a big draw back as you don't want people starring at you while you eat!

This was the best place to hangout with your friends. If you're a youngster you gonna like this place. It was a fast food joint in chowrenjee. This place was clean and simple looking. Crowded with College students mostly. Hospitality was okay. Service was good and staffs were friendly and helpful. You have many cuisines here to try from desi snacks to Chinese to fast food to beverages to indian cuisine and thali as well and you get all of these in pocket friendly price. Their Chinese and toast's were above average but desi snacks and indian cuisine were very tasty. Specially their thali like Rajasthani and gujarati thali is a must try. I also liked their Mocktails they were refreshing and delicious. So it's an good place to hangout and have their quick snacks bite.

Located on a busy street, very conveniently located. It is a small, air conditioned restaurant. It is a very good place to have your evening snacks. It has a huge range of fast food items like vada pav, pav bhaji, chola bhatura, crispy baby corn, noodles etc. The price is slightly higher inside but there is a small counter on the ground floor outside which serves few items relatively lower in price. So it is better to stand outside n have your snacks from there unless your are there on a meeting.

Tit bits - A small vegetarian air conditioned quick bite joint with  comfortable seating arrangements located on the busy streets near Rabindra sadan metro station, which has lot to offer in terms of food. 

It is one of the earliest places to open in the morning. It has stopped me on my way back from college quite a number of times.

Food review: The vada pav, paw bhaji, the chola bhatura, Hakka noodles, paneer tikka, crispy baby corn, some chaata and the bhel are the few items I have tried and found all of them to be tasty.

Food quality is good. Average service (actually depends on day to day basis). The price is little on a higher side, considering the prices of similar restaurants. Also, Menu should be updated.

Conveniently located at the Exide Crossing, is this small restaurant which serves excellent vegetarian dishes. The conventional Dal Makhani, Panner Butter Masala, Kulchas & Naan is quite good. However the ambience and service may not match expectations with the prices being moderate.

Me and my friend visited this place yesterday,we ordered for chicken drumsticks and chicken spring roll. Both were yummy! We were also been offered complimentary soft drinks..so it was a win win situation for us! 
The food was great and pocket friendly,the d√©cor has a caf√© type feeling,service were good too.
But the bad thing is that they don't have any washbasin,and the see-through glass doors are also a big draw back as you don't want people starring at you while you eat!

This was the best place to hangout with your friends. If you're a youngster you gonna like this place. It was a fast food joint in chowrenjee. This place was clean and simple looking. Crowded with College students mostly. Hospitality was okay. Service was good and staffs were friendly and helpful. You have many cuisines here to try from desi snacks to Chinese to fast food to beverages to indian cuisine and thali as well and you get all of these in pocket friendly price. Their Chinese and toast's were above average but desi snacks and indian cuisine were very tasty. Specially their thali like Rajasthani and gujarati thali is a must try. I also liked their Mocktails they were refreshing and delicious. So it's an good place to hangout and have their quick snacks bite.

Located on a busy street, very conveniently located. It is a small, air conditioned restaurant. It is a very good place to have your evening snacks. It has a huge range of fast food items like vada pav, pav bhaji, chola bhatura, crispy baby corn, noodles etc. The price is slightly higher inside but there is a small counter on the ground floor outside which serves few items relatively lower in price. So it is better to stand outside n have your snacks from there unless your are there on a meeting.

Tit bits - A small vegetarian air conditioned quick bite joint with  comfortable seating arrangements located on the busy streets near Rabindra sadan metro station, which has lot to offer in terms of food. 

It is one of the earliest places to open in the morning. It has stopped me on my way back from college quite a number of times.

Food review: The vada pav, paw bhaji, the chola bhatura, Hakka noodles, paneer tikka, crispy baby corn, some chaata and the bhel are the few items I have tried and found all of them to be tasty.

Food quality is good. Average service (actually depends on day to day basis). The price is little on a higher side, considering the prices of similar restaurants. Also, Menu should be updated.

located near rabindra sadan metro station. this place is frequently visited by many college students. been here just a couple of times. tried their crispy babycorn,  vada pav, schezwan rice, and veg cheese burger (they probably just sprinkled 1 gram cheese in that).

ambiance- nothing really extraordinary 
service and staff - average 
food- below average in taste, quantity is less, and overpriced. 
just visit this place for their vada pav that's it.

Its need to work on its delivery service big time, I have ordered today Club Kachori Jalebi & Dhokla. I called up at 8:30 am, the person said that it will reach to me in an hour. I didnt receive my delivery till 10.00 am. After that also, Dhokla was missing, and the food delivered was totally cold. My house isnt that far from this place that it would get cold in the meanwhile.¬† After calling him up and informing that the kachoris are not hot, he kept arguing that it was hot, when it left from here, and that they make as and when we order. But what is the point in making the order if they cannot deliver it at that time. How irresponsible of them to forget one delivery packet of Dhokla, and not even realising it. How shameful is it if you invite someone for breakfast and then after making them wait for an hour and a half you serve them cold food and that also with one item missing. And prices.. They have increased their prices and decreased their service, pathetic experience.

We were early for a class today so decided to go somewhere and have breakfast. We went to a couple of places finding those closed we went to Tit Bits. It located 2-3 buildings away from the exide Haldiram's.
Service- Good, they don't take too long to serve.
Ambience- The management has made an effort to keep the ambience soothing. Soft instrumental was playing throughout but the crowd present were shouting at the top of their voices so that kind of ruined the ambience. Also they could do with a little more lighting(upstairs).
Presentation-The place was clean and the presentation too was good.
Food- We had ordered Cheese grilled sandwich and Cheese burger. We liked both but the sandwich had really hard edges. They could work on that.

This sunday DCS morning walkers group had breakfast date at Tit bits. We were trying to go this place from a long time but some how could not. 

Small restaurent near chowringhee.  The staircase is also small to reach a mezzanine floor.  

We ordered Club kachori, jalebi, sandwiches,  baked beans on toast and tea coffee. The taste of most of the items were good.

 The price was little too high, Considering the prices of similar breakfast restaurants.

We ordered Bhel and vada paw also in the morning breakfast.  They were also good. 

The views are my personal and not of the group.

This locality has a lot of veg joints and Tit Bits is one of them. Located at the crowded AJC Bose road near the metro station, this place is small but has a lot on offer. Their chaats are simply awesome and the charges are not high. The place is always on the roll with people ordering in every hour of the day. The food is well prepared and the place looks hygienic. There's nothing much to talk about the ambience as it's quite small but is a delight for many vegetarians in the area.

Located on the busy streets near Rabindra Sadan metro station, this small outlet has nothing much about its ambience. I visit here to have a delicious veg lunch. My favourite item is dahi vada and mostly its out of stock if I go after 2 pm. Apart from that I also love their papri chat and dahi phuchka. They just melt in the mouth with the perfect taste. I am also fan of gujrati thali which is ample for 2 people. I still have to try their other items but till now am happy overall with their service, quantity of food and food quality.

A nice clean vegetarian restaurant in the Rabindrasadan Area. It serves a huge range of food that is also served by its next door neighbor Haldiram's. Tit Bits definitely have an edge over Haldiram's. Firstly you get privacy, secondly you get air conditioned service(one at Haldiram's cannot be felt). The taste of food is almost the same in both the places. Our order included Dhokla and Shrikhand. I cannot find any fault with the food. They were good.

The best item that they would prepare is crispy chilli baby corn. The usually serve in steel utensils place the food quickly. The food is good and a good place to drop in if you are passing by that area.

Found this restaurant serving Gujarati Thali on Zomato and wanted to give it a try right away. So this afternoon's lunch included the Gujarati Thali along with Chola bhatura.
The Chola bhatura was unique.The chola was cooked in a dry masala which had a wonderful achari type taste to it.Its smoky soft taste is something I had for the first time and really liked it.
The Gujarati thali was my first one too. And it didn't disappoint me either.Loved the thepla ,saag aloo ,daal panchmela and sev tomato sabji most.
Finished it off with a glass of sweet lassi.However, it was pretty ordinary.The service didn't disappoint either and its fairly quick.
PS- The menu card here @ Zomato is old. Rates have been revised and prices increased by 10 to 25 rupees depending on the dish

That restaurant is located near Exide haldiram food court. It is extraordinary shop for various kind of sweets and chocolates placed at ground floor.  It is also served tasty snacks in outside corner. Upper floor has well sitting arrangements. It has served quality veg Indian continental and veg Chinese foods. Within budget, Special thali systems are also available at the lunch time. Every time, I would love to try  the dessert item named "Hot brownie with ice-cream and chocolate sauce".

A place which surely satiates your hunger..its located very near from haldirams,exide..tit bits no doubt serves some best vada paos downstairs,its veg meal served on the first floor also promises a satisfactory experience...its a small and non-spacious restaurant with dim lights..we had ordered an indian thali..the butter nan was really soft..the dahi vada was tasty too..
However,a place which surely satisfies your hunger with a cheap pocket pinch..

Located in the prime location of Minto Park,it is a very old outlet cum restaurant.It has no wow factor in its interiors which is very normal.The furniture used is also not unique or one of its kind.Furthermore,the space is very limited and could accomodate only a few people.This place is well-known especially for its vada paws and other dishes.

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Commenting to the food,i would say that is a good restaurant for the vegetarians.Most of its dishes could be served without any onion or garlic.Is boasts of a large menu with a lot of  options for snacks as well as main course.I ordered for Manchow soup which was spicy and very hot at the same time.This soup has noodles as well as it is a chinese soup.The taste was good but spicy.I also tasted khandvis,dhabeli,theplas and paneer tikkas.the khandvis were very  cute and small in size.The quantity served was good and it tasted similar to the khandvis prepared in a typical gujarati house.Dhabeli was a kind of sandwich with bread on both the sides with a filling of reddish tikki kind of mashed potatoes.It tasted like a grilled potato sandwich.The theplas also tasted well.The paneer tikkas unexpectedly tasted and prepared well.Its garnishing and presentation  was cool.Nothing could have been better than slices of cabbage leaves,tomatoes and capsicum to garnish those kebab-like paneer tikkas.A piece or two were burnt more on the upper side.The sauce could have been better.It is usually of mint leaves but this time the sauce accompanying this dish had chillies too which made it a bit spicy.Everything tasted soothing to the tongue

¬† ¬†Commenting on the service,i would say that the service was good.The dishes were served to us quite speedily.The steward was always available to take down the orders.Furthermore,there were waiters who hastily removed the plates when the dishes were over and replaced them with cleaner ones.They were well-behaved and courteous.

¬† ¬†My ratings are as follows:

Food-3.5/5

Ambience-3/5

Service-5/5

Value for money-4.5/5

Overall-4/5

Mention Tit Bits and many a Calcuttan will tell you that this shop has been (and still is) the chaat stop for over a decade. Ignore the name and, instead, land up there on an evening - rain-soaked evenings are even more crowded - and you will be impressed by the crowd thronging the shop for a quick bite of the snacks on offer. Vada Pao, Bombay Bhel, Gujarati Combo Meal, crisp Plain Dosa, idlis... you name it, they have it. Friendly, lightning-fast service makes it a delightful experience. They also have a multi-cuisine selection of Continental, Chinese and Tandoori items on the menu.

This outlet is located beside the Kathleen outlet near the Exide Haldiram.Previoulsy I had tried it out casually,attracted by the vada pao counter outside.But recently I discovered that they have a proper restaurant in the first floor.The restaurant is small but quite decent.It is airconditioned and has quite comfortable seating arrangements.
The food here is veg and quite tasty too.The vada pao,pao bhajis and the chola baturas are the few items I have tried and found all of them to be tasty.I was quite impressed by the chola batura.The service is average and the prices are a little on the higher side specially in the restaurant section.

This amazing place (not too fancy) is a surprise package.

Since it's near my school, I have been familiar with it for a long time.

Obviously the main reason to visit this place is to gorge in the scrumptious and delightful thaalis.

The Rajasthani thali is the winner HANDS DOWN!
The Lasun ki chutney, sangri ka saag and gatte ka saag are simply stupendous!
The Indian thali is good and is surely too much to eat entirely by myself.
I often have the sandwich combo too which is quite filling at times (depending upon my appetite).
The Gulab Jamun are hot and moist!
Even the Indian Combo is lip smacking!
Over all a good place for combo meals! And hey, its friendly on the pocket!

Tit bits is a very well known quick bite joint at ¬†minto park.
The vada pav they serve is truly amazing.. they make it live in front and the taste is maintained through out..
All the chaats specially the sev puri chaat and raj kachori chaat is really very nice..
During rush time its really difficult to stand and wait for your order.
But still after you get your vada pav, the wait is worth it.
Best vada paw sellers in kolkata.
Recommended by me :)

I am amazed to witness this. Gujrati from titbits is my dead favourite. I can really gorge on it whenever I feel like. The chaats are mind blowing especially the raaj kachori chat. The sev puri another thumbs up. The khapoli vada is a new dish worth trying. The USP is the khandavi dhokla chat , I can have them for the whole day may be. Its beyond tasty. The mattar befwa kachori with chole is overrated. The rice dhokla is again something new. Since u dont have much option to sit and eat. I guess parcels would serve you. The gujrati thali is a must try here. Its has a thepla, a sabji, aaloo saag, sev sabji (though I hated the factor that it had tomatoes in it), mixed dal, dhokla.. but the killer was of course the shri khand. a must visit people.

The climb to the restaurant reminds me of the uncomfortable ascent to Arsalan's in Park Circus. Unlike the latter, the ambiance is just lovely. Spacious, bright and the quick service keeps you happy, no matter how ravenously hungry you are. Just one thing though. The waiters, in their diligent effort to maintain swift service, are extremely noisy while arranging other tables and cleaning up. This provides as a real disturbance when you're eating.
I tried out the Papri Chaat and Chhole Bhaturey, with Gulab Jamun for dessert.
The Chaat was awesome. The size of the "papri" was much much larger than that available in the street shops, and the dash of pudina chutney with laal mirch powder simply enhanced the taste manifold. Bonus point: There's a good amount of Sev as well.
I didn't like the Chhole Bhaturey. At all. Though my parents simply loved it. I felt that the puris were oversized "Luchis" while the Chhole was too dry and bland. The Gulab Jamun was heavenly. Soft and served hot, they retained their taste in my mouth for long.

Location: Exide, few minutes away from Haldirams. 

This place had been the quick-bite stop during my college days. 
The vada-paos it serves are delicious. 
The Vada is a bit oily though but, tastes great! 

Happened to visit the restaurant on the mezzanine  floor.
The AMBIANCE is nothing great, just a simple interior and a decent seating arrangement to accommodate an approximate of thirty heads.

ORDERED the following across three visits: 

- Veg. Hakka Noodles 
Noodles were boiled properly, but the preparation was oily. 

- Veg. Fried Rice 
Perfectly cooked rice. Tasted great.¬† 

- Indian Thali Combo 
Thali comprises of Butter Naan, Aloo Dum, Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala, Gulab Jamun, Saffron Rice, Boondi Raita and Papad.
The Thali was delectable (perfectly baked naan, nicely prepared aloo dum, perfectly simmered and flavored dal makhani, succulent paneer cubes in a flavorful makhani gravy, hot gulab jamun, subtly flavored rice, nicely prepared raita in fresh curd and crisp papad).
It's one of my fixed orders now. 

-¬† Masala Kulcha
Flavorful filling, tasted good.

- Cheese Chilli Toast 
Great taste! 
Recommended. 

- Cheese Sandwich 
Slices of bread filled with grated cheese and served with wafers. 
Good for a quick bite. 

The STAFF here is courteous, well-informed and prompt in SERVICE. 

Prices are pocket-friendly. 

Overall a good experience. :-)

Located beside Haldirams opposite Exide building, Tit Bits has been around since a long time and created a good name name for itself for the great, consistent food at very pocket friendly prices.

The location is such that it attracts a lot of young school n college crowd as well as office goers so the place has a very diverse menu with great thali options and some nice chaats. The restaurant inside is big, well lit, clean and comfortable but do not expect a fine dining experience. The staff are pretty polite and service is very quick.

They have been a family favorite for years for their matar puffs n masala  chips which were discontinued few years back. They serve some very nice chaats and a quite lovely n spicy vada paw. The north indian main course dishes are pretty well prepared and served at really nominal prices. The north indian thali is just superb for some 120-150 bucks and packs in a great variety. 

Overall a great place to grab a quite bite or a meal without bothering your pockets as such.

Awesome place with two sections one for a quick bite with side tables and one for a proper dining experience. Though I never got the chance to try their main course I am in totally love with their snacks which are lip smacking.
The best is the vada pav which is served with mouth watering chutneys.
Even the dhoklas, chaats are so good that you actually dont miss any non veg items. They maintain good hygeine in the place. The place is a must visit for people who enjoy their snacks and chaats.

A very clean sweet shop in ajc bose road(located near the junction of lord sinha and ajc) This place serves really tasty snacks and sweets.My favourite here is the laddoo and ras malai. I also love their fruit rainbow sandesh topped with kiwi plums and mango slices. 
For savouries i like the corn puff, samosas and cutlets.
The place also serves other items and everything is hygenically prepared. 
The prices though a little higher than usual sweet shops,is justified because they use pure ghee in their products.
The quality of food is what makes this place stand out. 
The staff are hospitable.

They service is quick, pocket friendly as well. The restaurant is not spacious but air-conditioned and ambiance is good. The waiters are well behaved as well.Their toasts are good too but i have mostly been there for puchkas , bhaji,chaats, Crispy Chlli potatoes,veg biriyani. and their quantity is also decent.

Situated just a few steps from Exide Haldirams ,Titbits is one of the good alternatives of haldirams for the daily visitors of that area.. It is also a bit cheaper and their vada paw is highly recommended though the other items in the menu card are equally likely. I recently visited and had their Indian combo meal  comprising naan,rice , aloor dum,dal makhani salad pickle and sweets is an excellent option for vegetarian lunch. The Veg pulao tasted great along with the Paneer butter masala. I would definitely visit again for a quick lunch.. :)

Gujarati Food is really lip smacking. Shrikhand is one the best desserts I love and this joint gives me every sense of joy eating it.  I just hope I would be enjoying shrikhand or thepla or khandwi with same joy here in years to come. People who love Gujarati confectionery and has not visited this joint, guys heaven is waiting for you, go and grab it.

I don't even remember since when have I been going to this small place situated beside my school.. My mother to my grandmother- everyone loves this small place because of the quality of good they serve!

I love their burger, vada paw, shrikhand, dhokla, baby corn, matar kachori- even if you simply close your eyes and order something I can assure you you won't be disappointed. That's the magic. 
The food is reasonably priced but the only complaint I've is the service and the ambience. However, given the quality of the food they serve, I can readily ignore those issues and simply keep on hogging ;)

Gokul Tit Bit is a pure veg restaurant which really makes some delicious items. Their thalis are are good and provides enough amount for a person. I became a great fan of their Shrikhand which is a must try. Their snacks are no doubt great.
The ground floor has a wide collection of namkeens, chocolate which are also worth trying. I am near that area, and feel hungry, this definitely becomes my first preference, even over the Haldiram's  outlet.

I recently visited this old favourite and was quite happy to realize that though they have been around for over a quarter of a century their stuff tastes just as good not to mention reasonably priced. I was quite surprised that they made such an excellent vada-pav. I usually stick to the patra and bhel-puri or papri chat so I had actually never tried it but after reading the reviews on Zomato I decided to try it and I am glad I did .... good stuff indeed !!! They also make nice shri-khand for those of you who have a sweet tooth. Looking forward to my next visit already !  ;-)

----- 26 Nov, 2012 -----

I have been going to this place for years .... they make really nice chaat's. Though its all veg do try the Mattar Patties, Khandvi and Dhokla ... fresh and tasty .Their Pani Puchka and Papri Chaat are also good but my personal favourite is the Bhel Puri. Try out the Patra which is very well made. Those looking for a quick bite can also try the Mini Titbits Combo , Gujarati Thali and Indian Combo. Its not the most orignal food in Kolkata but its tasty, clean and very pocket friendly.

Tit bits situated in a busy area of kolkata, gets a lot of attraction from foodies there. I always have a meal here every month. It sells all food items and also dry fruits. The food is YUMMMMY and FINGER-LICKING and specially the Bhel Muri,Vada pav and Khandvi. The north Indian food is also good. The service is Good with the staff giving a lot of respect to customers.The decor is also creative on the second floor with light music on and hygienic rest.The price is also not high and affordable.

The best thing I love about Gokul Tit Bits is the vada paw they serve here during all times of the day! It is unbeatable and unparalleled to anywhere in the city! Besides, the chaats in the form of bhel puri, matar patties, corn puffs, dabelis etc. are really good. But that's about it. Kachori sabzi, paw bhaji, and other items on the "main course" are quite below average. But if you're in that area, you HAVE to have its vada paw! Or else, at least one small cup of a Haagen Dazs ice cream!!!

Today I went with few of my friends to Tit bits which is just a 2 min walking distance from Haldirams Exide and is purely vegetarian. 
It's a small place. Previously also I went there for vada paos who serves outside but one of my friend told me the vadapao doesnot belong to titbits. Today I went inside and there was a short staircase to the restaurant. Basically I was hungry so ordered a veg thali and trust me everything - naan, rice , aloo, paneer, and gulab jamun , raita, dal makhani was superb!! When you are hungry you should give thali a try. I didnot try anything more than thali. That was enough. 
Now I'm gonna discuss the pros and cons. 
Pros: 1) an AC restaurant with decent dining ambience
2) 2 or 3 staffs who serves lighting speed service 
3) food was pretty good. 
Cons: not discovered yet any only ambience was old.

A small, standing room only kinda a place, run by a gujarati.

Has the most amazing dhokla, khaman, aloo subzi puri & all the other farsan without which gujju's would give up living.
