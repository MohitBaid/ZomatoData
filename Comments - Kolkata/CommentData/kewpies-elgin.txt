We didn’t have the thali and opted for a chanar dalna, fish fry, ilish bhapa, luchi and rice. After having waited for more than 45 mins, they served us cold (not phulko) luchi, chanar dalna which turned out to be mutter paneer. 45 mins after ordering the waiter suddenly told me that they didn’t actually have ilish so he asked me to order shorshe pabda. Did order that only to be told 5 mins after that there’s no pabda! Finally had to opt for the chicken curry which was good but honestly could be made by any Bengali mother. Overall quite disappointed after hearing so much about the place and nor was my guest happy who was out of town. And, the serving size is terrible. Please do something about the service and serving size!

I usually don't like Bengali cuisine restaurants, but this is the restaurant with which I am truly attracted. Talking about the food it's amazingly amazing. This is actually #Maa_Ke_Haat_Ka and the price is also reasonable. On the other hand, talking about the ambience it's calm and quiet and their hospitality is too good. The interior is also typical BENGALI. I have truly fallen in love with this place and everyone must visit this place.

Kewpie's, for me, was a little hard to find. But that's mostly because it was my first time in Kolkata. I went there in the summer of 2016. It was a beautiful experience. The staff is extremely welcoming and makes you feel right at home. The actual restaurant area has a very hipster Shantiniketan vibe. The lighting sets the mood perfectly. Now the food is a different thing altogether.
It serves exactly what it promises- elegant Bangali food- presented comme il faut. The flavours are clean and the whole menu is designed in a way that it will give even the finickiest foody an experience that they would love to repeat again and again and over again.

Should have zero rating,  Just trying to encash the recent trend of food experiments... Pretty basic bong style food,pathetic service, average decoration imitating  rural bengal, ultra small portions, priced bomb.. Any other name for bong food you know in the city is better. Service very very very bad.

TOTALLY AVOIDABLE PLACE

Stones in the rice.

HORRIBLY overpriced for the servings/portions. It was not just exorbitant, i felt it was EXTORTION.

Taste and preparation is ok. No great shakes compared to any street food.

The wash room is worse than the railway station toilets. 

A dinner for two cost us Rs 1381. They dont pay GST, so that shaved off about Rs 390. 
Therefore, meal for two is actually about Rs 1750. 

I had better experience at Delhi - the Bukhara, Pluck and Sanadige. 
. 
All foodies who reviewed it and tossed it up to stratosphere earlier are being laughed at by the owners for creating an EXTORTION racket for future.

We had bookmarked this restaurant on our first trip to Calcutta. The place was sorely disappointing. There was a gigantic cockroach that came running out from under the table. There were 2 waiters, neither did anything to even remove it. The washroom was disgusting, dirty and had more tiny roaches. The last straw was when the food arrived and there was a mini cockroach on the plate. We complained to the waiter who didn't even seem apologetic about it. Terrible experience. I highly doubt they deserve the awards they ahve hanging on their walls. Oh and to add, outside the restaurant, I found another dead cockroach. That makes it 4 in all, in one experience. Never going back there again and best of luck to whoever does.

Not only size but taste does matter! As far as food is concerned, so they say!! An unbelievably big bhetki fry that not only does justice to its size but taste as well, clearly defining the difference between good & great, is definitely "the item" one should order on all visits. A basic veg thala is what we ordered that matches taste with tradition unlike most of the Bengali joints in the city "customizing" the cooking style & the taste not to mention of the compromise in quality. An excellent chitol macher muitha (is khanti damodar seth listening?!), perhaps the most authentic paturi avaialble in the city, and an outstanding goalondo chicken curry are the three non veg items we ordered. Even the luchis served on the platter reminds one of the home-cooked variety. A good tomato chutney, followed by sweet curd, sandesh and paan proved to be worthy tailenders to this meal. This joint continues to be the best place n Kolkata for someone who wants to enjoy a Bengali meal cooked in the traditional way offering the flavors of home-cooked food.

We went for a bengali meal on 27th sep to this place. Place was deserted- hardly 3 tables were on including ours. The earthen ware gave us a bright hope of good food. Ordered a la carte. We ordered Channa dal, a loo dum, kosha Mansho, fried fish , aam panna, and prawn malai curry with luchis and steamed rice. Quite disappointed.  Helpings were like 4 tablespoons of dal for Rd.100, 2 small potatoes for Rs.100!!
The fried fish costing 320/ was  one thin piece of bhetki with mounds of crumbs!! Amazing!

Similar with the prawn! 4 tablespoons of curry and 1 prawn, 4 tablespoons of curry and 3 pieces of mutton- hardly any taste!
Quantity of rice was as dieticians want us to eat- 1 muthi! 

Very disappointing dinner ! Still remember the tasty fare of long time to. Seems owner's want to sell on basis of past fame!

I love this place!!! It's an old house nicely setup as a restaurant...
Surprisingly when we stepped in, there were no other guests that too on a Sunday dinner time.

The ambience is just a total different experience all together!! Decor is truly amazing!!

Food is so freaking tasty.
Okay people it's true when they serve you, it's like such a tiny bowl and am I supposed to fill my stomach with that little food. But Stop and just start eating. They are so delicious that it fills your stomach even half the way!!
Believe it, quality is much more important than quantity!!
The food is just too good..
My dear Bengalis don't waste your time and just rush there!!! 
You will love the food!!

We went looking for some good bengali cuisine.not checking out the zomato reviews before selecting the place was one of the worst experiences of my life.we had chosen to go a la carte and had ordered kosha mangsho , chicken kosha , elish bhapa, dhoka r dalna, chicken goalanda or some crap like that.the rice per plate ws 75 rs and the quantity was so less it wouldnt even be sufficient for a kid.Everything was cold bar the luchi, and the quality of rice was so bad i dont know what to say.The elish bhapa smelled of mustard and lacked any flavour whatsoever except being bitter.The staff is not friendly enough.the restroom smells bad.Moral of the story is quantity minimal, quality abysmal.if u value ur money and dont want to sleep hungry DON'T GO.

Please DO NOT I repeat DO NOT recommend the Restaurant for Bangla food to anyone . It will give a completely wrong idea about the food that we are so proud of and we have grown up eating. No one has the right to serve such low quality food irrespective of the price and call it authentic Bangla food. 
Ambience :sucks.. walls are mouldy...place smell of fish...smell of food emanates from the kitchen...the showpieces are dirty and the AC looks like it's never cleaned. .the bulbs in the chandelier is fused
Service : Very slow. I am sure they are paid to be courteous but it didn't seem so. 
Food : A true horror story..I went through all the emotions that I have when I watch a horror movie. There was a breathless waiting for our order of Luchi,Daal,Rice,Shorshe ilish, Bhetki paturi, Chicken, chutney, Papad. 1st Shock : Luchi Daal Rice Shorshe Ilish was all served together like a Thala. The Daal was 2 spoonful 's not enough for 1 person Luchi looking like dish cloth tasted the same. 2nd Shock: The ilish smelled so pungent that I thought it's rotten.It took my entire appetite away..the ilish was dunked in tonnes of Shorshe gravy and the taste was horrible. Oh I was given plain warm water to wash my hand..no soap...no lime..
Rest was more bad which I do not have the time to waste penning...if you really really hate someone then only recommend this place.

Though they are boasting of great authentic bengali dining experience, I felt cheated after visiting this restaurant today. In quest of some delicious and traditional bengali lunch, me and my nephew had been to this restaurant. Though they are offering various veg & non veg "thalaa" , we decided to go for a la carte and ordered rice, daal, shukto, chorchori, bhaapa ilish & kasha mangso. On served I was shocked to see the quantity. Around 100 gms of rice, 50 -60 mls of daal and other items in almost same ratio, which was even insufficient for a kid. So we had to order  another 2 portions of rice and the billing was around Rs.2000/-. On complaining they clarified that this is the regular quantity they serve and nothing can be done in this regard. Decided not to visit this restaurant again and for those who are looking for a good bengali restaurant, 6 ballygunge place and even kasturi are better options.

Kewpie's is a place for authentic Bengali food. It's a beautiful place that is simply decorated with hand picked artifacts, lamps, wall hangings. Each of them grabs your attention. One would fall in love with the interiors. Complete 5 marks for ambience. Staff is polite and humble. They respond well and quick service. I felt happy when the lady who owns the place came to note our order. I appreciate her effort to connect with her customers. 

We didn't find much rush at the place. It was clean and neat. 

Food was delicious and served in clay plates. Food was served warm and tasted good. Nicely cooked. One could feel almost all ingredients in the dishes
 But the quantity was lesser than expectations. The price of food seems to be high when compared with the quantity. 

If you don't have Bengali relatives and want to taste the authentic Bangla meal, this is the place.

Wanting to treat my German friends to Bengali Cuisine, I took them to Kewpies  ..The Purveyor of Authentic Bengali Food.   My friends, probably believed that Bengalis ate such low quality food. But as I am a great champion of our Cuisine, I was highly embarrassed.
The Begun Bhaja looked like it had come out of a crematorium rather than a kitchen and the luchis appeared to have spent a long day in the sun, having lost thier milky white complexion.
The Channa Dahl was palatable enough, and the Chef must have started out by serving three or more tablespoons in the earthenware katori it was served in. But the dry clay soaked up most of the dahl and we had barely a couple of tablelspoons to eat our rice with. 
We ordered the Daab Chingri, which is the signature dish of a classic Bengali Kitchen, much in the same way as the Coq Au Vin or Paella is to the French and Spanish kitchens.  But what we go were microbes in the place of prawns, they were that tiny , and instead of a smooth mustard gravy made creamy by the yet to be formred coconut kernal, we got a bitter paste of machine ground mustard with finely chopped pieces of tender coconut.  Oh ! and plenty of mustard oil.   Some one needs to tell the Chef that there is an art to grinding mustard for Bengali Shorshe Bata and bunging the seeds into a grinding machine is not it.

What stung me most was not the meagre portions or the bad food, but the meanness of spirit exhibited by the establishment.  When I asked for a second finger bowl, I was given another bowl of warm water, without y the sliver of paper soap which had been given in the first finger bowl.

At a coouple of thousand Rupees for 4 persons  I didnt feel cheated....I felit  robbed. !!

ITI MISRA.

Could have given this 0 rating but it's not there...had my worst experience of lifetime.At first we went to Oh  Calcutta but it was overcrowded,so we choose this as nearby Bengali restaurant.Our first disappoint was the place is very small and poorly maintained.
We choose for 3 NOBOBORSHO THALA.At first they served us AMPANNA SARBAT(didn't told that it costs 130 rs per glass...OMG SO HIGH PRICE).Their govindavog rice was poorly cooked,semi solid in nature...awful.No trace of GHEE found.Polao was to sweet that can't be taken.Couldnot differenciate between phulco kichu or kochuri.Sukto was not available.Alur Dom was made of plain jhol without any spice.Cholar daal was very sweet.Mochar ghonto was unpalatable.Daab jhinge was bitter in taste.Motorshutir dalna was also not good.Ilish jhol and bhapa ilish was not also up to the mark.Their chicken goalanda pretty bad.Tough mutton curry was so so.Lastly they offered doi,sandesh and misti paan.Now here comes the climax.Bill was 3627 rs.Cant imagine this price.They are changing 70rs for 1litre mineral water,390rs for 3glasses of aam panna.I think this is the WORST BENGALI CUISINE RESTAURANT in KOLKATA.

Though we appreciate the taste of food and the plethora of items offered, our third visit to Kewpie 's on Poila Baisakh 2017 ended with great disappointment (well the word is an understatement for what we were actually made to feel by the celebrated owner Ms. Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta). I won't be complaining about the slow service fraught with mistakes because the staff did its best to serve us with a smile despite the rush while coping with the frequent tirades of ms. Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta which went on as a background score to accompany our lunch! Moreover, the rantings did spoil the charm of the place and the meal! However, it was nothing compared to what ms. R.P Dasgupta did next ---- while we waited to be served, she came and told us in the most rude manner that she didn't intend to be rude but we must finish off our meals quickly for the people who had booked the place had arrived! This really came as a shock to us for it had been just an hour that we were there and we were trying to adjust with the snail paced service and we had no inkling that the 2 ramshackled seats ( we adjusted understanding the rush) were already pre booked and nobody even informed anything when we had previously called to book a table! It was a bolt from the blue marring our entire noboborsho lunch experience leaving us feeling guilty that we had actually chosen Kewpie 's for lunch over oh! Calcutta or 6 ballygunge place! Ms. Dasgupta should realise that these days there is no dearth of good Bengali cuisine in the city and a slight information beforehand would have saved us the insult and what foremost matters to customers is standard polite behaviour! She might consider taking a behavioural course from her extremely polite and apologetic staff!

Kewpie's is most definitely a fond memory of my Calcutta Food Trip.

This place is an experience, for sure. Not so much of a busy place, i guess, but this was wildly recommended by most of my Bangla office folks, back in 2011.

The eccentric decor and lush, brightly coloured walls do give you a heady feeling. These are perfectly balanced by the white coloured walls with various curios and knick-knacks arranged neatly around the place.

Now, coming to the food.... Amish Thala was quite intriguing on the menu but when it arrived, it was just chicken curry with pooris (Luchis, as they call here... INR 7 apiece) and stamed rice (bhaat). The chicken curry was good but nothing extraordinary. Then we had the Kosha Mangsho (mutton curry) and that was something really worthwhile. Infact, i am grateful to Calcutta for helping me inculcate an appetite for red meat. 

Anyway, my friend had ordered the Veg Thala and it didn't look as he was having a great time.

Bhetki Paturia was brought in, hot and steaming, wrapped in a banana leaf, it lacked spices but i guess that was to let the innate flavor of the fish to be appreciated by the ..err... eater..hahaha
Daab Chingri was the  Star here and i loved it to the core.

Our meal ended with a katori of mishti doi which wasn't the best that we'd had, during our Eastern food sojourn.

While the meal was expensive, for sure, i enjoyed the ambiance and the overall feel of this place. I could have spent more time here.

I've heard that as this place grew more famous, they let the food take a backseat and were focused on making just more money.

Please note i am writing this review now though i had visited this place in Oct 2011.

I hope things have changed for the better, so the foodies can revel in the experience called Kewpie's.

Still, take my word for it and go Kewpie-iinnng.. you would enjoy the place :)

Tucked away in a lane in Elgin, this place is a masterpiece when it comes to the ambience, food and service. Greeted by a warm smile from the manager , you will suddenly have a switch of mood as you enter this place from the busy Kolkata roads. They have different types of thalas (thalis , in Hindi). Thalis are different based on how many items they comprise of, and also within the Thali what options you have in terms of veg and non veg items. We took the kewpie's aamish thala and the sadharan thala. If you want to try the best of everything, I would strongly suggest the aamish thala because you will get 1 type of fish (I took bhapa bhekti and it was amazing), 1 type of prawn ( I would suggest Malai chingri if you have ordered bhapa bhekti because bhapa bhekti has a mustard base and if you take daab chingri , that would also be a mustard base) and also mangsho (mutton) or chicken. Other than the non veg you would also have dal, shukto etc. The food was lip smacking and a taste that you will remember and refer strongly to others. We also got mishti doi, Sandesh and paan for dessert. Each item we ate was made to perfection. The interiors  are really well done and has a warm cozy feel to it. The service is beyond excellent with the lady manager explaining each item to you as well as guiding you on what to order and also how to eat in true Bengali style . 

Highly..No..Very highly recommended.

Decent food but it is one of the most expensive places I have been for the least decorated places. The. Staff was rude and was not even available to take orders. Waiting for 15 mins we had to reach for the kitchen door to ask for food. I felt like I was in jail and it smelt even worse than that. Ho anywhere but here.  The quantity was very poor and was not even fit for one person to eat and was sold at a price higher than most places you have ever been in. Being a foodie I think one should make this mistake of entering the doors.

We went in to have authentic food. The food was authentic without any taste. The mutton kasha (350) per plate had 3 bony pieces of mutton without any taste which was not sufficient for 1 person also. The chital Muthi was very very salty with a tasteless curry. 
The luchis that they served was of the size of a golgappa, and they charged 16 rupees for a single piece of luchi. 
In the beginning when we went in they themselves offered us AAM PORA SHORBOT to eat. So we thought it was a welcome drink. But they added the shorbot with our bill. This was a sheer act of unprofessionalism on part of the staffs. 
The staffs will not guide you towards the proper food. They will infact mislead you and want you to spend more money with less food. 
I had a very bad experience.

I wanted to try some authentic bengali cuisine and i found kewpie's.
There are lots of menu like vegetable thali, amish thali, and so on, i found mohabhoj amish thali with lots of delicious bengali food in menu, (luchi, bhat, begun bhaja, dal, sukto, alurdom, jhinge posto, bhetki paturi, ilish bhapa, kosha mangso, chatni, papor, misti doi, sandesh, and pan) and extra aampora sarbot. Bhekti paturi was very good and ilish bhapa was not tasty. And chatni was very bad. But i love misti doi that was nice. Service was excellent. Their way of greeting is good.
So overall no problem to try once if you are in kolkata.

Deep pocket - Shallow appetite? Please come to Kewpie's, they will take care of you. 
Absolutely no value for money, and atomic portions. 
Tried their 
1) shukto - good, but about 3 spoonfuls 
2) Aam pora shorbot - synthetic and Rs.130 for about 100 ml!! whoa!!! 
3) Ilish Mach bhapa - awesome taste, one good thing on their menu! :) 
4) Chicken Jhol - 2 pieces of chicken (Rs 350)/ - gosh where did you guys import that chicken from? - extremely spicy and tasteless
5) Doi mach (rui) - yukk 
Absolute disappointment, if only the TV channels would stop raving about this place, also another word of caution - please be prepared to go home hungry or broke :)

If you are visiting Kolkata and not eating at Kewpie's, you're missing out on some major bengali food-high. This place was EXACTLY what we were looking for - quaint, subtle interiors; simple, homely seating; warm, welcoming hosts and of course the mouth-watering food (we had the Mithu's Macher Thala)! 

Must haves: Freshly made Aam panna; Baigan bhaja; Bhekti fry or Bhekti paturi (i loved both!) along with Luchi, Chutney and Mishti Doi! (Droooool!)

Feedback: Should reduce the number of vegetarian items in the non-vegetarian thali - broke my heart to choose the Bhekti Paturi over Palong Ghonto (a spinach based veg preparation) since my stomach refused to accommodate more food!

This was a long due in my bucket list and thus went along with a friend of mine who surprisingly treated me ;)

It is located in the vicinity of the city, very near the Forum Mall. The interior of the place has been very cleverly designed to give a vintage look, which in reality is a makeover to meet the standards.

Upon entering, we were very courteously welcomed by the manager cum owner and was asked to be seated. Immediately the staff appeared with the Menu and promptly stood at a safe distance (neither too close nor far away) anticipating our order. I asked them to give us some time which they promptly did and disappeared from our immediate view.

Being a Bengali, it was rarest of the rare occasion that I came to a restaurant to try Bengali dishes, and, well I give their food a 3 star rating out of 5. The taste of the food wasn't exceptionally good and it was expensive. At the same time, the dal was too tasty. Overall, one visit to this place will make you decide if you wanna try it again or not.

Overall, I rated them 3.5 stars taking into account other details such as quiet ambience, clean sitting area, amply placed tables, neatness of serving.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) If you have a heavy pocket and they wish to take old denomination notes (which is very unlikely), try it and form an opinion.

This intimate, cosy, family run restaurant is one of Kolkata's top Bengali Cuisine eateries!
The Bengali preparations here are authentic and carefully prepared! The sauces are thoughtfully conceived and strike a balance between an exaggerated regional taste and loosing it; just right! The atmosphere is a bit rustic and too basic, distracting from the wonderful food. A ground floor cottage has been converted into a multi-room eatery! You may have to step over people to get to your chair! But you must go there!

When you walk in assuming it's just another restaurant like Kasturi which also serves authentic Bengali food,  you are in for a good surprise. Amazingly calm decor with very positive vibes will envelope you. The same reflects in the food they serve. The surroundings make you go for the fork and spoon but please use your fingers to enjoy the real taste... Fantastic place... A must visit again for me...

Much hyped Restaurant !! Very expensive but food quality n quantity is very less. 
Been there during Durga puja. Over priced thali. You will get tiny sized sandesh.  They are charging Rs 1000 for a non-veg thali. 
You are not allowed to take non veg item in extra.


And I am not sure how they cal it " Dab-chingri" . Would Request Ms Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta to revisit the process of making the same. Extremely pathetic.
Friends please opt for other Bengali restaurant.  You will get good food in star hotels in this price.

The quantity served against the price charged has to be looked at but we still enjoyed the food, the place and the authentic flavors. The paayesh and aam panna were the big plus to the dinner for us.

I went here with family , with the intention of enjoying a good meal. Worst decision ever!
The place seemed decent enough with an old bengal charm and earthen utensils laid out. At the outset, we were presented "special puja menus" with the rates hiked up.We had checked their menu rates on zomato only, and this was nothing like it. Okay, that happens in all places during pujas.
My parents eat really little, so we decided against "thalas" and ordered a la carte. On hearing our order for 7 people, we were met with a very condescending and patronising tone of the waiter/steward saying that what we've ordered will just be enough for 2 people.We asked to place the order , we would obviously order more if required. When the food arrived, we understood their mirth.It was a joke! 
The rice portions were not even enough for a child, 2 mouthfuls and it was over! So we ordered more, and we again got the same dwarf portions. Same for the loochies and the curries.
Our final bill came to around 4500 , which , even by the overpriced Puja rates, shouldn't have been more than 3000.
And since we were last to arrive, around 9:45, the waiters seemed to be in a hurry to just get rid of us and shut for the day.

Thoroughly disgusted.

And, also, their washroom stinks.

Overpriced Restaurant for simple Bengali Cuisine!!!

I cant imagine the shock we got upon seeing the quantity of food that came from the ala carte section that we ordered.
They seem to specialize in Thalas (that too overrated for the menu).
And the strange thing is, the food ordered from ala carte section is priced like the way other restaurant do (e.g 1 Kosa Mangsho = 300- 350/-)
but the quantity of the food is for 1 person only. 
Its like the amount we get in Thalas, only being charged double if taken from ala carte section. This is ridiculous.
And the most irritating part was the almost coin sized Luchis being priced at 16/- each. 
At least have the courtesy to give proper general sized luchis. Very Dissapointed.

Yet another over hyped restaurant with good ambience and a fancy way to serve food in earthen utensils. My friend took me to this restaurant to feed me authentic Bengali food. This is a place next to forum on a snug road. 
As I mentioned the ambiance was good with the old world charm. We ordered 2 thalis thinking its best way to taste the cuisine we ordered crab chauchari/fish curry/ chicken curry and prawn malai curry it took a while to come on the table and once it did we started digging in. I made my first attempt to try the crab chauchari to my utter surprise the curry was warm but the crab was still cold as if they just took it out of the freezer I informed the person attending us and he took it in and probably heated it up in the microwave and served it to me again. In the mean time we tried the fish and That prawn curry which were stinky, the chicken which had no taste and tasted as if it was boiled n kept in the fridge and was put in the curry right after the order was placed. The gravy of all was spicy but u could only taste red chilly powder in it and nothing else not even salt. In totally the food was really awful we had expected it to be better than what we had earlier. After the meal they served us misti dahi, pan and cheez which was ok. Would not suggest to go for dinner but can go to have a look at the ambiance.

Having been at this place more than ten years back, I decided to check it out again while hosting a cousin from Gujarat and an old college buddy from New York. The manifest purpose was to partake in home cooked Bengali meal but we were blown away by the latent atmosphere of the place they're soulful cooking. The new location is a couple of houses down from the old location and the interior are beautiful. It immediately transports you to your Zamindar friends courtyard kothi kitchen. The wall art was equally evocative of that bygone era where time was a bit slower and the idea of sitting around waiting for delicious food was not yet an Instagram photo op! We ordered the Vegetarian thalis for myself and the cousin and my friend got the fish one. All the dishes were multi layered like the 'punchpuran' spice that subtly blends five different floors and aromas into a whole. The food, the ambience and the derive all came together in a gestalt that was more than the parts. This is a true must do experience if you're in Calcutta. Skip the bland and blah experience of the mall restaurants next door and experience why the Bengali plate and the palate is so awesome!

you gonna love it to core.. also fondle the cute lil dog that keeps knocking the door for a pee on your way out :)

We had decided to go for a family Sunday lunch at Kewpie's and in order to make things easier for our senior relatives, we had reserved a table for ourselves beforehand. As it turns out, upon reaching the restaurant, not only were the staff appalled with the Sunday lunch crowd but they also successfully mixed up the reservations and the table allotments were in a mess. After waiting for almost 30mins (note: inspite of prior reservation) we could finally settle.
We ordered for Maach Thali with variations of Shukto, Mocha'r torkari, Chingri Malaikari, Fish Fry (I still wasn't convinced it was pure Bhekti), Ilish Maach, Crab Jhal. I personally wanted Chitholer Muithye which they did not have available and upon request they included a Pabda Maach in my Thali.
The dessert was not up to the mark with watery mishti doi. The pan seemed okay-ish too.
The terracotta serveware was unique as these clay utensils are rarely seen in use except for utility as Chai Bhars..
End verdict: if you want to experience old traditional Bengali way of eating complete with traditional clay utensils, then Kewpie's is a good choice. However, on the front of competitive, aggressive marketing and customer satisfaction, this is Not your go-to destination.
Note to management: please ensure better staff and resource management, courtesy and prompt service.

I dream of Kewpie's !! 

This place has the most fantastic food you will get in TRUE BLUE BENGALI cooking ! 
The ambience is dim, and inviting and transports you into a place of peace and quite where you can ponder and think of the menu. 
The menu is varied. But sticks to the central theme of good nay - great bengali cuisine. Ask the server for recommendations if it all new to you.  You'll be advised on the seasonal specials, the time of the day etc considered.  Once you get a hang of which fish or which kind of gravy it is, go ahead and be adventurous. 

I had an order of steamed fish with chutney wrapped in banana leaves, and a daab chingri served in an earthen pot.  The taste and memory of the food still lingers and I cannot wait for my next trip to Cal and Elgin Lane. 

Pricing - The place is expensive by Calcutta standards, but if you are visiting from Mumbai or Pune where you are used to paying for quality food, it will not really bother you so much.

It was a natural choice when my friends from Delhi wanted good Bengali food.I regret the decision without reading the latest feedback and review.The food was insipid and not the Bengali food my friends would cherish.This maybe the last time at Kewpie and would not recommend to others as there are better options available.

Nightmare on Elgin Road, yes that is how Was the experience when I visited kewpie's a well kmown place for Bengali cuisines ran by Mrs Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta . The place is so hipped that you will be expecting good food with some real Bengali delicacies.  They have served stale food which was definitely not prepared in the evening, and they admitted and changed the same when pointed out by my sister, yes true   the other items were served cold with a good try to cover it up with presentation and garnishing,  horrible experience with good 6 k running in drain for this worst food, I was thinking of going to consumer Forum if somebody from my family fall sick from this. Mrs Rakhi Purnima Dutta please look into this it takes long to gain but short time to loose your name. It was never expected, a place like kewpie's serving stale food prepared not less than a day. You take good money for it and don't hold your responsibility to control all these.  Shame felt disgusted, will ensure I spread the news.

Authentic Bengali caught my attention and we went hunting for this place. Surely would not have been able to spot it otherwise. We were a group of 3 for dinner and decided to do a ala carte. We asked the waiter for what would be good and he suggested the thali. But since it was priced at 600 INR each, it was out of budget for us. We politely asked for other options but got a really cold vibe. The rudest shock was when he told us we cannot place an order less than 600. We could have very well left the place right then but we decided to stay back and order something since we has anyway come all the way.

We had phulko luchi, raw banana curry, chutney and doi baigan. Flavours were subtle but the quantities extremely meagre specially for the amount spent. The cutlery was made of clay and the ambiance had a very rustic appeal as it was an old villa - renovated. All of this would have been enjoyable had the service delivered not been of such low standard. Would urge the management to look into this and ensure it doesn't repeat with other customers atleast.

To start with we arrived a bit early for dinner at 19:00 and they were shut so we cud not enter, after a request we entered in at 19:20 , sat in and enjoyed the homely ambience. We had to then wait for a long time for our order to be taken and we needed some recommendations from the waiter, we ordered for betki fry and just got a small piece of fish for an exorbitant price, although I know sea food is expensive since I live in Goa.. we then ordered for a mutton curry and rice and the portion size was ridiculously small...I've eaten at five stars and found their products value for money.. complete betrayal from such kind of homley place, and service too was not to the mark for your prices. Sorry but change is required. Was a total turn off for a tourist like me..

On my trip to kolkatta, we were looking out for traditional Bengali food joint. On asking around we were told about kewpie's. We ordered for the special Thali, the food was good, but i have had tastier Bengali food, its overpriced, and i did not find value for money. The place is difficult to locate. However the staff is extremely courteous. There are many more places that serve authentic cuisine, so unless you have exhausted all options you can give this place a miss.

It might be a little difficult to locate. Tucked away in alane, parking space is crunched. But once you are comfortable, enter, colorful decor greets you. Sufficient seating arrangements. 
They offer bengali thalis. Good but it's a little too heavy on the pockets.

Homely in every sense,,,the food is as delectable as what you may find in the fancier Kolkata restaurants.... Kewpie’s uses recipes passed down over generations nd the proof is in dishes like daab chingri, chorchori nd elish patur.....

Have been to this place today with family for a Sunday lunch. The only attraction we found was the typical Bengal's earthen plates etc. The ambience was not so impressive. The food was below average though too expensive. The Thali lacked variety. The money spent was not worth what we experienced. I remember I'd visited this place around 7 years back and it was a much better place to eat than what it is today.

Alright, guys. I gotta say this.

The ambience didn't really appeal to me and my friend. 

I'm not a hardcore veg or non-veg fan, I'd go with anything as long as it tingles my tastebuds.

My friend, Arwen, hit some of the non-veg individual dishes. I tasted one or two, it sucked.

Stick to the Thalas at this place. That's their UUSP (Ultimate Unique Selling Point).

My choice was the Kewpie's Amish Thala. A la magnifique.

I was a bit surprised by the relatively low ratings by other patrons. Anyway, have been there twice in the last three months. Both occasions I was thoroughly satisfied. The secret I guess, is to order a sadharon thala and the rest a la carte. The mutton kosha with rice was a delight. The "dhokar dalna" highly recommended. Bhetkir paturi and fish preparations also great. What I really liked was the ambience.... It's like sitting in a dining room at a friend's place.... Not much crowd or noise. It actually made me turn away from Oh Calcutta.

Sometimes the fame don't match the real experience, today I had a rush lunch with my son at this 'famed' restaurant. The decor is good, housed in a old building with pretentous paintaings and terracota scattered without much imaginations. Suggested to take a thali and a baby one for my kid, was disappointed with the quality. Ordinary bland taste and surprisingly " Dub chingri" became " Sarse chingri" with pungency you will detest. The gowalondo chicken was simply a chicken curry and a baby thali costing 400 bucks has only one portion of rice, dal and fry of spring onion, two fulko luchi and alu- dum. Spent more than 1300, simply fleeced.

Most overrated restaurant. Food was below average level.awful . We ran up a bill of Rs 6000 and the food was pathetic. left over pieces were served. Most of the accompaniments alongwith the thali were just not served.  Servings were almost invisible. we went with kids and the food was delayed endlessly. Service was the worst ever. Speaking to the manager was of no use. As he took zero interest. Truly his laid back and care a damn attitude is what has made this once supposedly good restaurant  in the least preferred restaurants. there are fantastic restaurants in kolkatta serving authentic Bengali way. Kewpies certainly is not one of them.infact like we have  a list of things to do in kolkatta. There should be  a list a of things NOT TO DO and Kewpies should be part of it. complete disaster.

overall a highly unsatisfied experience from such an esteemed restaurant.

Quite overrated. Would not recommend if you are looking for bengali cuisine. We had reserved for 4 in advance. Place was difficult to find, even with Google map.  We reached around 8th and the place was mostly empty. When we ordered the non veg thali, the waiter promptly told us that dab chingri and kosha mangsho are out of stock...difficult to accept as we reserved early and even placed the order. Service was slow... food quite ordinary... nothing to make you say wow... somehow they got us 1 prawn dish, but the prawns were not cleaned properly. Not expected from a premium restaurant. They replaced it with bhetki paturi though.

So after reading all the reviews of this place I was in two minds whether to give a visit to this restaurant.. Finally went there today with the Groupon coupon. It was a OK kind of experience. The decor is really eye catchy. The service was good but not fast. But I was not totally impressed by the food. We ordered two non veg thali, out of the thali:
Rice- it was not hot
Dal- good
Luchi- v. Good
Shukto- it was disgusting, tasteless & cold
Jhinge ALU posto- so-so
Mochar ghonto- was really good
Bhetki fry- the best one of the thali
Rui jhol- the piece was good BT the jhol(gravy) was OK
Mutton- good, the mutton pieces were soft & well cooked
Lastly, papad, anaraser chatni which was good, doi( I waited for the doi for 10 to 15mins, as I was told they were out of stock) sandesh and a Paan..
It was really hard to find this place, but when we went there we were welcomed by a handsome looking dog🐕. I thought the dog was welcoming us, but no he was actually coming out of the restaurant by opening the door by himself, the dog was very calm and cute looking. ( guys nothing to get afraid of). When we asked about the dog we were told that the dog lives upstairs. I was going to give 3 ratings for this place but giving extra .5 ratings for that dog only...

Kewpie's has been the shining beacon of authentic bengali food in Kolkata. I had heard rave reviews from people, saw it featured on numerous TV shows....finally I got to try their food first hand. It was a let down,totally disappointing !!

 They couldn't even get the 'aloor dom' right, it was two halves of potatoes swimming in a thin 'jhol' (gravy) !! The rice was overcooked and lumpy. Except the mustard which accompanied the fish fry nothing seemed to leave an impression on the palate.  The 'ilish' was the only saving grace, bhetki paturi seemed very mild and dry, chingri sitting in a pool of watered down jhol, fibrous chicken in very ordinary gravy. The mishti doi was good but the sandesh seemed to be a specially tiny quarter of a bigger sandesh.

Highly over-priced.The service was also not up to the mark. The decor was interesting to say the most. I am not going there again.

Loved the food at Kewpies. We had the mangshor thala and it was great spread and the quality and quantity was very good. The price is slightly on the higher side but as we used Groupon we had a good deal. Fish fry, kosha mangsho and chanar dalna was awesome. A good Saturday lunch courtesy Kewpies and Groupon. I will surely be back soon.

Location: Finding this restaurant took my friend and I almost 1.5 hours. We kept walking around in circles despite getting directions from the management at the restaurant. It is an extremely hard place to find. Suggestion - Have bigger sign boards on the streets. 

Ambiance: It looked very interesting from the outside - with the red door and the mosaic steps. The interiors of the restaurant were equally amazing with red walls and the restuarant partitioned into 3 parts. 

Food: We had the basic Shadaron Thala. This consisted of Luchi, daal, aloo dum/ shukto, rice, bhaja, chutney, papad, mishti doi and a sweet. The luchi, daal, aloo, rice and bhaja were extremely tasty. We weren't expecting a sweet chutney so that was a bit of a let down. And my friend was not too fond of the mishti doi and sweet. 

Pricing: Rs.400 for these items mentioned above was definitely expensive. I would have normally been okay paying Rs.200 for such a thali. 

Service: When we entered the restaurant we realised that all the tables were waiting for their food. So we figured service would be slow. And it was. I think we waited around 30 mins for our food to arrive. We were extremely hungry, but we were okay with the wait. 

Overall: The food was good but I didn't think it was worth the bill amount. And hence I am unsure if I would go back to Kewpies.

2000 followers!!! Thank you for your faith in us! Celebrating with another review of yet another joint....

Kolkata means extended family, good food, shopping and old-world charm for us.  You never tire of the Phuchkas, the Rolls, the variety of fishes, the curries, the sweets, do you? The modus operandi we employ to deal with our insatiable urge to ‘eat it all’ when at Kolkata, is by making an meticulous list and by sticking to it strictly. Bohemian, Bhojohori Manna, 6 Ballygunj Place, Kewpie's, Mitra Café, Bedouin – that’s how they are conquered….

 

This post is about the famous famous Kewpie's. But before I begin to write about the food, here are two warnings – Number 1, Kewpie's is difficult to find. Located on a narrow by-lane of the famous Elgin Road, we had to go round and round in our cab many times until we found it. Guess that’s because we were there for the first time. For Kolkata residents, it shouldn’t be difficult to locate. It did help that our taxi-driver wasn’t from that part of town. We almost resorted to GPS.

 

Number 2 – you’d be forgiven to think that Kewpies serves continental food. The name, after all, is hardly India. But surprises of surprises, their’s is a spread of typical Bengali food. Awesome Bengali food! Read along to find out how awesome…

 

On the food front, Kewpie's virtually covers everything that a Bengali kitchen ever came up with. From an array of delectable veggies to almost every fish in the pond to the meats, Kewpie's has a jhol or jhal (Bengali words for gravies of varying thickness) around them all. We, by the way, were royally confused. And so crazy hungry from all that hunting for the restaurant, that we could hear the growling of our stomachs. Filled to the brim at that hour, the busy staff informed us that the orders could take another 45 minutes to hit the table if we ordered anything exotic. “No No”, we blurted out in alarm, “We shall settle for the ordinary”. And ordered the ‘Thalas’ – the assortment of rice, luchi, veggies, dal and fish and desserts, all in one huge plate.

 

Well, what arrived at our table, was by no means ordinary – Illish bhanpa, Chitol Maacher Muitha, Chingri, Shukto, Alur Dom, Dal, Bhaja, Chutney, Papor, Mishti Doi, Mishti --- we were in the seventh heaven. That Chitol Muitha was probably one of the best I have ever had. We went back home that evening deeply satiated.

 

The ambience at Kewpie's is most homely…it is almost as if you are seated in someone’s living room. A small cosy place done up in beautiful colours and art décor items on the walls, we especially loved their crockery. The plates, bowls and even the glasses were all earthen ware, and disposed after every meal. Served on banana leaves on these plates, you almost feel you have been transported to your great-granny’s kitchen!

 

If in Kolkata, miss Kewpie's at your own loss….an enormous loss!!!

Kewpie's is a happening and socialite friendly  place with both high profile desi and bideshi admirers (highly covered in media) wiith average and over-priced food. If I have friends or guests coming from out of town who are not Bengalis, I suggest this place, since places like 'Oh Calcutta' and '6 Ballygunge Place' are more mainstream and present all over India, while places like 'Kosturi' and 'Podda Par-er' are way too non-frilly and only meant for serious food lovers. Kewpie's works in that case, because it is nestled in a very Bengali ambiance, with beautiful decor, and the average but packaged and served well (in earthen pots and thalis) food (always average) doesn't disappoint, if you have not had better. 

However, if you are from here, then you can ask your Maa, or Thakuma, or Dida to cook you a feast, and enjoy the meal much more. That's what I do, and never end up going back to Kewpie's.

Kewpie's has a lovely deco and I loved the ambiance. I was the last customer before they closed for lunch but they didn't make me hurry so I could enjoy the food with my own time. I ordered tali. There were so many items so it was fun!  Each items were very tasty. Sandesh was perfect desert to end the delicious meal. I wish there are Kewpie's in any other cities in India.

Highly disappointed with the Restaurant. Ambience was ok. The tables are very close to one another. Food was pretty average. Quantity was less ( If you have a bird's appetite, it will be enough for you ). Highly Overpriced. Not recommended if you are a true foodie. There are better bengali restaurants in the city ( better by a long margin).

Somewhat disappointed, having been privileged to enjoy Mrs. Dasgupta's own cooking back in the day. Lau'er torkari was painfully salty. Both the koi and the eeleesh fish were good, though the shorshe was a tad bitter. Chutney was pedestrian. Portions are quite small. 
Overall, not up to the standard of the original -- and noted  -- Kewpie Dasguota

Went to this restaurant for the first time along with my wife with certain expectation, going by its reputation. Highly disappointing.....

Decor is good. Service indifferent. Overpriced food served in minuscule earthen pots the size of Diwali "Dia" (matir prodeep). Kudos to Kewpie's for coming up with this idea of serving food in such small things! My rating of 1.5 is only for few food items (including Chitol Muitha) that were good. Other items were pretty ordinary.

Not going there again, that's for sure. There are better restaurants in Kolkata that serve authentic Bengali cuisines, and you don't feel fleeced over there.

The hunt for authentic Bengali food in Kolkata led us to Kewpie's as suggested by a friend.
Setup in an old Bungalow in the heart of Bhawanipore, this place looks quite ordinary from the outside. But as you enter (we were guided by a friendly staff) the place is wonderfully done. It gives the feeling of an old Bengali household but tastefully decorated. I liked it.
The waiter was there with a smile and made suggestions for food as we told him that we were new to the place. We ordered the Amish Thala & Macher Thala. And we were obliged when we told him that we wanted to try Hilsa.
We ordered Aam Panna and fresh lime soda. Aam Panna was really good but fresh lime soda was not that great. I will not go for fresh lime soda here.
The food arrived shortly served on mud platter and banana leaf. Bhetki fry, Elish Patol, Chingri Malai, drum stick bhaji, Banana bhaji served with Luchi and rice.
The whole spread was amazing. My daughter liked Hilsa so much that she ate just that.
I enjoyed my lunch and again in the traditional way when I thought I have had my fill, there came the papad and chutney. We did not know in which part of the stomach to put it. Oh I forgot, the chicken curry that was part of the Amish Thala went untouched as we devoured the fish.
The lunch ended with Mishti Doi, Sandesh & Mishti paan.
Enjoyed my lunch very much.

Why isn't this on Legendary Restaurants or Bengali Restaurants?
Anyways, this place is way better than Bhojohori Manna. *don't kill me* but yes, I found it to be so.
The homely atmosphere, the wooden crafts, the lighting.. everything is so perfect. And yes, the dishes. Authentic Bengali cuisine. And the quantity is way to much to finish it in one go. Not to forget the wonderful quality.
A must.

Kewpie's, all that it has got today remaining is a huge legacy left behind by Kewpie who was considered the ambassador of Bengali food. Have tried all their specialities including the very famous Daab-chingri, but nothing lives up to the name. And the price is way too high. 
I won't suggest anyone this joint.

Had lunch and dinner several times on several occasions over more than past 15 years. This Restaurant also sends out invitations to regular guests, when there are periods of festivals such as Poila Baisakh Durga Puja Christmas New year eve etc.
This Restaurant has often been called a place where you get authentic Bengali Home food away from home.
One also finds guests from Outstation on short visit to the City Foreigners from Consulates who drop in for a taste of an authentic Bengali meal.
There is a simple homely Ambience about the setting of the rooms the decor the seating arrangement etc. Household items such as Crockery Barware Decanters etc are on display.
To complete the effect they serve food on Banana leaves on Earthen Plates and water in Earthen Glasses.
Selecting from their Menu one generally goes for a Simple Thali (consisting of Rice/ Luchi Moong Daal with Scented Lime Geen Chillies a fry item such as Brinjal Parbal etc Vegetables sweet curd a small piece of light sweet such as steam Sandesh) with additional Nonveg/ Veg items. One can choose additions   from wide variety of items on the menu such as Chicken Curry Mangsher Jhol Hilsa/ Pabda/ Chitol/ Koi fish / Daab Chingri etc
One has never been disappointed with their food as such. Tasty Bengali Home food. One can rate this place anywhere close to 4/5. 
However, One challenge they must be contending with is clients being drawn away to modern Chain outlets such as Oh Calcutta! They need a renewal experience so far as variety of items and tastes are concerned. That may be reason for current poor ratings on Zomato of 2.7 or so. They have to expand also to provide for more guests.

Traditional Bengali food served in clay crockery. It's hard to locate the place - but you won't repent once you savour their servings!

The platter is yummy with home style cooking and serving. Fish in mustard is best, followed by chicken curry and loochi (bread).

Casual, confined and homely atmosphere to hang out with friends for long hours!

I am very surprised by the low rating for this place. I came here after watching highway on my plate show... And my god what a place this is! The food was fantastic. I and my vegetarian friend both had thalas and we feasted on it like kings. Everything which came with that thala was so tasty and it had so much flavor... It was an experience. I am a Goan, I am no Bengali food expert so this is a non biased review I am giving. The ambience is nice, the waiter loved feeding us and he kept telling us things about Bengali cuisine which was really nice of him. The only thing which was upsetting about this place was price. It was really expensive. Two thalas costs us 1600 bucks... Ridiculous. But food-ambience-service didn't disappoint. Try this place!

My worst experience in 30 years of dining out across a pan Indian and global canvas.You may still visit Kewpie's restaurant at your own risk and peril. There was no relationship to the ordering pattern and sequence of serving.Right quantities WERE HARD TO COME BY-OUT OF 10 FISH FRIES ORDERED , 2 WERE RECEIVED A good 15-20 minutes after the first eight (and we were a family of ten). Had to struggle hard to locate chingri in dab chingri were onions were predominant.The mutton was anything but soft, and the hilsa did not have the usual aroma. The icing in the cake was the arrogance of the Management when the deficiencies were highlighted ( instead of treating it as an opportunity to improve).....my friends had warned me in advance and recommended kasturi, Suruchi, Aheli, 6 Ballygunge place, Bhajohori, Tero Parbon, Oh Calcutta, ....but not Kewpie's...and I echo their sentiments

To summarise in a nutshell - not even close to value for money. Deficient service coupled with abusive behaviour from the entrepreneur herself. Whosoever has rated the place as 2.5 has, with due respect, overrated this avoidable joint. We had been here today for a family dinner for about 10 of us and came out shocked with the stressful service and threatening behaviour that we experienced. The food is   very average and the reaction to feedback on quality of service and food was reciprocated with vindictive attitude by the owner herself. Having spent an exorbitant amount for food that is surely not worth it, we are utterly disappointed on a special day and would strongly recommend proposed visitors to explore better alternatives and avoid the bitter experience that we had. The owner should appreciate that if they are being repeatedly rated and reviewed negatively as compared to its earlier days, it is high time for her to retrospect to prevent further adversity.  I am compelled to rate the place 1 since there is no option to rate the same less than 1.

Hadn't been to #Kewpie's in a long time. In between heard reports that it wasn't the same anymore and the quality had gone down. So, went there for #PoilaBoisakh dinner at the instance of a cousin - with some apprehensions. But, the #AngloIndian style (not #Goan) #Duck #Vindaloo totally floored me - not available in any other Bengali restaurant (to the best of my knowledge). The mix of cumin, turmeric, Kashmiri chilli and vinegar was just perfect. The duck could have been a little more healthy - but it's difficult to get farm bred ducks in #Calcutta these days. Personally, I prefer the lean free-range birds. The yellow-rice was authentic - though I liked to dip Luchis into the gravy. The Iilish Paturi made with deboned #Hilsa and Aam (Raw-Mango) -#Kasundi (Mustard- sauce) surpassed expectation as was their signature Daab-Chingri (#Shrimps steamed in Tender Coconut Shell). Overall, it was like old times. Kudos to Rakhi-Purnima Dasgupta - the pionee in #Bengali fine dining - to keep this single outlet, owner run gourmet restaurant going for so long. #ShubhoNabobarsha (#BengaliNewYear) to all. #BengaliFood #BengaliCuisine #Kolkata

Kewpie's disappointed us sorely - in quantity, in service, in pricing and most surprisingly, in BEHAVIOR.  Never before have I heard an owner of a premium restaurant utter expletives and ask guests to go out of her place - as parting words. 
Fond memories of the same place ,14 years back ,were shattered and a Poila Boishak family dinner went bitter. 
Never again to your place Ma'am!
Best of luck all the same.

I am a bit surprised by the low rating this place has received.... The food...  Bengali aristocratic food dishes... Is usually stupendous and the serving style and ambience is top draw....

Some people may have found the service a little stand offish... But the general rating is quite wrong..

Whenever I go I always order the non veg mutton thali and chingri.... It's always good... And the quality had never waned....

The thali allows one to sabot a lot of dishes at the same time though it's never as expensive as a buffet...

My mother had told me a lot about this place, so one afternoon, after my board exam, she and I went there for lunch.

The first thing that I noticed while we were going through the menu was that a full grown pariah dog was roaming around the side of the restaurant. I was shocked at first, but later our waiter told us that it was a tame dog. The second incident that took place prior to the serving of our food was that one of the clay glasses in which they had served us water had a little hole in the base, and soon the entire table was soaked before we could even realise anything. This was certainly not the Kewpie's my mother had told me about.

We were served the two Mithu's Mangshor Thala we had ordered on our new table. The luchi was very good, and so was the mutton. It felt like having home cooked food. The luchi was soft and mutton was tender and juicy with just a touch of spice. But that's about all that was good about the meal.

The dal was bland, it lacked seasoning. The alur dum was cold, and didn't have a trace of salt in it either. The mochar torkari too seemed like it was made prior to the Salt Satygraha. The dab chingri tasted more like narkel sorshe diye chingri. And for some reason the bhetki tasted like rui, which was odd.

The desert was the only other saviour of the dish. The chutney was very well prepared and went well with the papad. The mishti doi was good too. And the pan, well, let's just say that even their pariah dog would have a hard time chewing it.

One of the best Bengali restaurants in the city? I certainly don't think so.

Another overrated restaurant! I am sure every Bengali loves to take their NRI relatives or foreigner friends here. 
Utterly ridiculous food which has no flavour. 
Once upon a time this used to be a very good Bengali eatery now it's just running because it has created a name for itself amongst the Bengalis. 
The food has absolutely no taste, even a roadside eatery serves better food than they do. 
If I had the chance I wouldn't have rated this place, but the rating which I have given is only because of the staff who keeps running around to serve more luchis. 
The people running this place should get a grip and hire a good chef or else this place is going down the drain pretty soon. Yikes! 
Worst Bengali food I have ever tasted. And trust me I have tasted lots of bad bong food. 

Highly recommended : Please stay away if possible

A quaint little place tucked away in a bylane, more like a home converted into a restaurant.You'll feel spoilt for choice here: a thali crammed with bengali dishes, complete with a course of papad/chutney, dessert & a fiery paan. The food is delicious, full of delicate flavours & unlike regular restaurant fare that's loaded with oil/spices. The vegetarian dishes delight as much as the fish/chicken. The mishti doi was divine, with just the right amount of sweetness. Loved it and will visit whenever I am in the city. The only disappointment is the extremely exorbitant prices.

Quality bengali food in a homely setting.. The staff are very helpful with good recommendations for every palate.. The bhetki was a winner and is a must try.

I have visited the city quite often, but had never been introduced to kewpies prior to this one which does suggest that it isn't one of the best places to indulge in authentic Bengali cuisine. This place does host an interesting location combined with an artful interior but the food in taste is average and in quantity is distasteful. The serving plates and cups, are the earthen pots which serves you with an experience. The thali (aloo dum, loochi, chollar daal, begun bhaja, bhaat) is the only plate that falls perfect in your taste and budget. But what calls for a meal at kewpie's is the whole experience of walking down the night  streets of Kolkata and taking refuge into this space that speaks of art through its wall hosting the jatra(folk art) face masks, earthen utensils, kolla pattra ( banana leaf), and wooden furniture.

Over rated place with worst waiters and the rude manager.
I guess the owner has very good PR with the movers and shakers of the city and the leading publishers of the city. I think they have become dinosaur in their yard, taking middle class customers like us very not courteously.

The place is bit off the main drag of Elgin road, no parking facilities, and I can vouch that I have eaten better Bengali food in other bengali restaurants listed  and not listed in Zomato.The ambiance is exposed brick wall; quite nice...but.....

. To all the visitors to the city curious about Bengali cuisine ,  it is best to go to your Bengali friends house, if their mum/ or family knows to cook good Bengali food. :)
Second best is to try other Bengali restaurants listed in Zomato.

Avoid this pricey place with over rated menu.

The best part is ordering a thaali which means you can taste everything. The platter serves quite sufficient for two (if not very hungry and want to explore the taste, one meal is enough) macchi is best. Quite and peaceful ambience very earthy and warm. Loved sipping water in a earthen ware. Overall a good place and a must visit to someone looking at tasting bengali food.

It is quite sad that for many years, Kolkata did not have proper restaurants for gourmet Bengali cuisine. This one is the answer to all those wishes. The food here is simply awesome. Especially the traditional Bengali items. The service here is, surprisingly for such a chic restaurant, rather- homely.

Haven't started with the food yet, but had to put in the review earlier. The place is well done up with a colonial contemporary touch. Being an authentic Bengali fare restaurant it could do with some traditional touches. It's a residential house converted so has a very homely atmosphere. It had a few a la carte choices but if you are here you should try the thali. To get to the place take the narrow lane next to Netaji museum just opposite forum mall. The food has arrived and for the price the thali is amazing to dine on. You get to choose a choice of vegetable and the choice of non veg in what is called the Amish Thala. Food is particularly tasty, what one would expect of a speciality restaurant. Kudos and visit the place guys.

A beautiful place quite close to Elgin Road, a little hard to find but ask the locals and they will guide you straight to it. The interiors are absolutely lovely with paintings by famous artists adorning the walls. The staff is very friendly and will take good care of you. The food is decent, however it's not really awe inspiring if you are a Bengali and eat that stuff at home anyway and I can vouch that my friends and family can cook better Bengali food than what they serve at Kewpie's.  I had the "mangshor thala"which is a set menu comprising of rice, daal, fried vegetables (hated the peajkoli bhaja and no aloo bhaja was available), a vegetarian dish (the aloo posto was delectable), fish, crab/prawn and mutton/chicken (good mutton curry but then even I can make mutton curry as good). As for the prices, I have to say it's quite a bit expensive considering that it's home style food. It may be a good option for someone who isn't used to Bengali food.

A quaint little spot, with a little European town feel to it from the exteriors. The interiors of this home-turned-into-a-restaurant gives you a warm welcome, plus the subdued lighting only adds to it. The staff is ever eager to please you & look into your comfort & recommend house specialties, if you are the undecided sorts. The food is delicious, do try the fish & mutton thali. EPIC.

The first day of the year 2015,planned to have bengali food in lunch that too in a place that I never went before. After many permutations n combinations we planned to go to Kewpie's Elgin Road. Staring from the interior decor, service level and food is very average. The best part I liked is they were serving the food and water in mud plates and glass. We tried Bengali veg and non veg mohabhoj thalis. It started with Luchi, begun bhaja and it serves aam paana as a welcome drink. After trying 6 Ballygunj place and Tero Parbon it seemed to me very avg .If someone really wants to experiment bengali food you can go. But I would suggest you to go on special occasions... :)

This is one place where I haven't been in ages, and I really miss this place. The feel when they serve the food on the terecotta dining sets is something I cannot explain. The food, even if not the best, is good enough to leave back memories on your taste buds. Also, I have perks of being a known face. So the staff become all the more welcoming. Looking forward to visiting this place very soon again!

I went to Kewpie's for the first time last month with 3 other friends. I am from France and as such, even though living in Kolkata for the last 2 years, am definitely not an expert on Indian, much less typical Bengali cooking. My review can therefore be qualified as "virgin", based only on taste and observation, since I cannot critique whether the dishes were conform to traditional recipes. I left the choice of menu to my Bengali friends and so I was delightfully surprised by several of the dishes which were served. The atmosphere of Kewpie's is pleasantly and artfully themed. I liked the warm authenticity of the transformed house and the decor. Waiters were as they should be: attentive, helpful in giving their advice, when asked  and quick to servce. All in all it was a fun and very tasty culinary experience and I will not hesitate to go back for more.

I would not call it a find.. the place has been famous for long, and for the right reasons (low scores on zomato are a shock to me). Family run place, old house converted into a delectable restaurant. The service is friendly, with waiters trying their best to explain you the menu and recommending things to try. Been here a few times, but never needed to venture out beyond the amazing thalis on offer. Definitely one of the top 3 places in Kolkata for food :)

Do visit. Long time regulars cant be wrong!!

It is a big house which has been converted to a restaurant. A very good option of Bengali dining but I must say that there are plenty of other better options now available in Kolkata for authentic Bengali dining. The food taste is good but most of the items whichever is being asked for gets "unavailable". As such though the menu options are quite good, one needs to get satisfied with the very limited physically available options... Service part is OK

So we traveled from Bangalore to Kolkata on a holiday and based on all the great reviews we received from our friends, we decided to visit Kewpie's. We arrived at Kewpie's for lunch on a hot summer afternoon after a visit to Netaji Bhavan. The service we were provided by the hosts was dismal, to say the least. The food is overpriced, and the quantity is negligible. The quality of food isn't that great and I don't think what we had was fresh either. 

I liked the homely ambiance it had to it. But the place needs a lot of polishing in terms of what is being offered. Definitely NOT worth a second visit.

We traveled all the way from Salt Lake to reach Kewpies in South Kolkata last summer. I'm writing this review pretty late though...but I become pretty nostalgic when it comes to bengali food...of all cuisines. After hearing so much about this place , about the celebrity clientele they have....we decided to drop by after a hectic shopping schedule. Kewpies is located in a narrow bylane of South Kolkata's Elgin Road ....just opposite Forum. The quaint and cute patio of the house with an intricate ceramic inlay caught my fancy. We were led into a house which was cool, calm and quiet...with floors made of red stone...cool to the touch and very welcome in kolkata's sultry weather...summer as it was. The ambience is something breathtaking....it took me quiet a while to settle in and order my food as I was too much taken in by the sheer decor of the place....very classy...very much traditionally bong. Now, to the food....the most important part...the sole reason why we were there. We ordered for Kewpies Amish Thala and frankly speaking did not like it much apart from the aloo jhinge posto and narkel chingri served. Everything else was pretty mediocre. The hilsa had too much salt in it and was stale. Liked the concept of food being served in terracota earthenware...but at the end of the day its food that matters...and Kewpies failed miserably in that attempt. Success goes to the head at times and thats when the consumer is taken for granted. I guess this is one such case.

Had a long cherished wish to go there. Finally chose, Poila Baisakh. What really struck me about the place was the decor - the drawing room style ambience (thats what I prefer to call it) was welcoming. It was a pleasant visit, without the regular formality of the eateries and sophisticated restaurants. The Bengali food was quite well made and the earthen-ware in which it was served a delight. Reminded me of the old-days biye baris (marriages) where food was served in earthen bowls and plates and glasses. Preparation wise, I liked the items. Went with prawns, hilsa, bhetki, pomfret, red meat and chicken. Well made. Portions were good enough. Serving - fast and efficient. True to their tagline-'purveyors of authentic Bengali cuisine.' The only negative points being no dedicated valet parking and pricing being a bit high. However, if you are food connosieur, you are surely going to enjoy the food. And, overlook the price!

Kewpie's had been in my wishlist for a long time so decided to go their on the special day of Bengali New Year. .since I had decided that quite late but we were lucky enough to get a reservation.
Well it is located in an alley but in no case do u have to walk for 10 mins to reach the restaurant as I saw someone has mentioned it. your car can drop you at the doorstep of Kewpies. 
The ambiance was just perfect for the day and they served us a special Noboborsho thali which included shukto, govindobhog rice, luchi, bhaja moonger dal, potol bhaja, choice of a veg dish to which we chose dhokar dalna and mochar ghonto, 2 non veg items included ilish bhapa, daab chingri, chingri malaikari, fish fry, kochi pathar jhol and mutton kosha, chital macher peti and muitha..the choice was a lot and the taste of the food was just awesome. To end with chutney and papad and for dessert there was a variety again to which we chose mishti doi and malpua.. all the dishes were prepared with a lot of care and the flavours were just right and tasted like home made food..and the atmosphere was also like home u can relax and take your time and enjoy your food.
It was a busy day and the owner was down there helping. We did have a word with her as well and praised her for the excellent food that she serves in the restaurant. . 
I would highly recommend this place if u want good home made food and if you miss your mom or grandmothers cooking this is the place you should head towards and of course you should have sone time in your hand to actually enjoy authentic bengali food..
I am already waiting for my next visit to the place..

I am not sure why people rated Kewpies less, but perhaps because other options for authentic bengali dishes are widely available in Kolkata (6 bullygunge place, bhojohori manna, oh calcutta to name a few). I did not like the service here. Those who serve are old and perhaps not accustomed with the fact that nice presentation and behaviour means a lot for foodies. However, i liked the food here. Authentic bengali dishes till you can have no more. I like the kosha mangsho with luchi and aampora shorbot.

However, I'd not recoomend Kewpies for catering services. The quality of food drops immensely when they provide catering for bigger events like marriages and other functions.

One of the horrible place.......the sma spoils our very liking for our bengali cuisine......very higly priced for the serving or "Portion" as self proclaimed by them. The owner/waiters are dumb that you will ever find ever......... No suggestion from them on whether the quantity would suffice or not........dont worry it will never be sufficient........They even need to figure out what mustard sauce is....as we were not served at all despite being repeatedly called for.....
Suggestion ---- visit only if you wanna spoil the liking for our very dear bengali cuisine..........
Rating given as one as that is the least that I have to provide for this review........

My father used to take the entire family for lunch on one of the Puja days and hence the very mention of Kewpie's brings back so many memories back to me and a lot of them have to do with the good food served.
I dont remember having tried out the a-la carte food much. Most of the times, I would order the Fish Thali along with a Mutton Item. I must have gone to this place over ten times and I haven’t been disappointed even once with the food. The portions are really nice. The luchi is awesome and so is the rice served. The rice is Gobindabhog, which is also known and the 'Basmati of Bengal'. 
I have eaten at a lot of the recent Bengali-themed eateries in Kolkata but nowhere will you have so much of flexibility in a Thali as that Kewpie's. One warning though- parking is a problem at the place where this is situated.

Just had lunch here today and I must confess it's the worst place to taste the heritage and food culture of Bengal. The waiters are anything but dumb as they just play at being dumb so that they don't have to work too hard as I found out myself today. The Bengali classic dish 'Daab Chingri' generally consists of medium to large sized prawns in a thick creamy sauce placed within an open coconut etc when being served. 
Here even though it was part of the 'Aamish Thali' i e Non-Veg Thali they served tiny bits of prawn, cooked with mustard and cabbage and not at all the way it's meant to be. 
I even have to beg them twice to serve me extra portions of 'ghee rice' which generally consists of cooked rice and ghee gently mixed together with perhaps some cashew nut at the time of serving but here it was just plain rice and when I complained they just poured one teaspoon of of ghee on top of the dry rice stating that this is the way they do it.
The restaurant was dark and dimly lit with no theme oriented music playing especially since it pretends to be a heritage restaurant and upholder of Bengali culinary arts.
Even the sweet curd served at the end of the meal, 'Misti Doi' tasted bland and not fresh and in place of a traditional 'Sandesh' they served us a tiny 'Barfi'.
A through disappointment. All I can say is that the owner must know a few food journalists pretty well to get this 'Bengali Dhaba' to pass of as a 'heritage restaurant'.

Hi.... Being a Bengali I wanted to try the authentic Bengali cuisines which I miss since my Amma's (Grand-mother) demise. I have heard about Kewpie's authentic authentic cuisine  from several sources and being an ultimate foodie, I could not stop myself from trying out the food of this juncture. Though it is quite an old establishment but I never tried it before, so I was quite excited about the forthcoming experience.  

On 30th August, 2013 I went to Kewpie's with my Dad at around 9:45pm to find out its extremely desolated. We were the only customers. Though the interior has a old Bengali charm but the whole experience was quite bleak. Only one waiter was there who was serving us and few other guys present there don't seemed to be waiters and hence, not at all professional. For a minute or two a stray dog came in to greet us....which was ofcourse, something I was waiting for. 

Now, comes the food. I found it extremely over hyped. The Dab Chingri did not have any floors of Dab in it. On complaining, the waiter tried his best to get it modified. The Dab Chingri was really looking like "Chingri ar Payej-er Chochori" (Prawn n Onion sabji), Mocha and Dhokar Danla loose it's essence to excessive use of Garam Masala whereas, they could not serve us Kakra Chochori - which my Dad was looking forward to & chutni because they ran out of the same. However, as per the Thalis we ordered they should atleast have atleast since they compensated Kakra with chitol machher muitha.....Overall the experience was not something I was looking forward to...will not recommend it to somebody who wants to try Authentic Bengali Cuisine

Kewpie’s ,  located behind the Netaji Bhavan  , at Elgin road, near Bhawanipur,  was formerly  a  bungalow  converted into a restaurant  which has now made quite a name for itself in authentic  Bengali Cuisine. The meals here are served on the earthenware made of clay & covered with Banana Leaf.Everything  , including the tumblers  too are of the same material! 
Famous for its veg & non-veg Thala’s  (Plate) of varied price range , some of  its exotic  non-veg  dishes include  the Bhapa Elish,  Dab-Chingri , Prawn Malai Curry, Kankrar Jhal  , apart from Chitol  Macher  Muitha &  Pabda Macher  Jhal not to forget the  Bhetki  Paturi and  the Kassa  Pathar Mangsho ! Some of the  popular vegetarian dishes are   Moong Mohan Dal , Sukto , Begun Bhaja  & Panch Mishali Shobji, Posto Bata etc .If one opts for the Kewpie’s Special Thala priced around  775/- , he can expect to get 3-Non-veg  (main course) which include some of the dishes as mentioned above.Sweets & Paan too are a part of this package!
Select  dishes from a la carte clubbed with the vegetarian Thala makes a good combination!
I feel that the portion offered here  is lesser when  compared with the price, unlike other popular restaurants offering similar Bengali style food.
Meal for two will cost anything between 1200/- to 1500/- without taxes & can shoot up more depending upon your choice of non-veg dishes!
The ambience is nice  and worth a visit , specially  those with  a liking for Bengali cuisine! One will always come across people from various parts of the globe dropping in for lunch or dinner!
P.S: Please make your reservations during weekend visits. Also note that possibly the restaurant remains closed on Mondays.

I completely do agree with all the reviewers. This place is very much hyped, neither do they serve the best bengali cuisine nor their service is something you can like. Dab chingri, Gota mashla mangso and fish fry are good and few others are okay too, but definitely you can get much better in other establishments. You get a feeling of them to be kinda snob,yes, many others in Kolkata are similarly snob, Flurys, Mocambo, Shiraz and Chung wah are a few to name them, but, difference is they are god in one very important point, their food are still best in their class, but, Kewpies really give you a let down in this. Not highly recommended.

We availed kewpise through groupoun in last Saturday but its menu is not as good as given in the deal and all the magazines. They made daab chingri with small prawns and taste is worst I have ever had in my life. Our assumptionion is daab chingri is made with only bagda chingri or galda chingri. In case of desert we asked for 'misti doi and sandesh' and 'desert of the day' but they said that 'misti doi and sandesh' is their desert of the day on 27th july 2013 . Then we ordered for 'misti doi and sandesh' but they serverd us two 'rotten payesh' to our table and also in our neighbour table. Both the table occupiers tasted and said that 'payesh' is stinking but waiters said that the large quantity of 'elachi dust' is the reason for 'rotten payesh' . They were argueing that payesh is in good condition instead of replacing the orders. My suuggestion is don't try in kewpise anymore . If they are not sure about their food condition then they should not serve this to the customers and if they are not sure about the food and service then they should not promote thorough gropoun as gropoun is a very reliable deal partner. We availed The SONNET , De Sovarni , Himalayan Cafe through groupon.

I tried out this oldest of Kolkatta Bengali restaurants on an offer from GROUPON. We paid 499 for 2 Niramish Thalas.

What I absolutely loved: the location and ambience. In a time when most restaurants feel the need to have sterile interiors, Kewpie's hearty embracing of an old Kolkata mansion is refreshing. The red oxide floors, the high ceilings, knick knacks from by gone era in the shelves, the stolid charm of the furniture, the paintings on the wall--all are charming and very becoming. Even the way the thali was served: with bowls arranged in a semi circle recalled another time and a different kind of food culture.

Coming to the food, we ordered an extra aam porar shorbot which was slightly bland. The waiter also insisted on mineral water which was expensive and unnecessary. The thali was very filling quantity wise. We were served six different vegetarian prepartions [torkari] along with luchi, rice, dal, begun bhaja, alur dom, mishti, papor, doi, paan.

Chholar dal with narkol and kismis was okay. And I have had better begun bhaja although the long pieces of begun bhaja, with stalk attached is a disappearing item from our plates. The labra, too was okay. The alur dom was quite good: slightly tangy. The paneer and spinach balls curry was okay, too. Nothing great. The dhokar dalna was disappointing: the dhokas were too dense. The mocha too could have been better. The highlight of the meals were doi potol and daab chhana. Both were excellent and I cannot stress how good they were! 

In an era when Bengali vegetarian cuisine increasingly assumes an undeserving back seat, the fact that Kewpies has devised such an extensive vegetarian menu is heartening. And dishes like their doi poto and daab chhana exemplify the excellence of Bengali cuisine, particularly the vegetarian Bengali khana. 

That said, I can hardly see myself paying the actual price of Rs 1214 for the two niramish thalas.

The place looks impressive, very well done from the inside, That's it, that's the only good part.

As far as the food is concerned, this place is an overrated mess, bad food, horrible service, and with the prices you pay here, you can easily afford to eat awesome Bengali and other cuisines in far better restaurants.

We went there on hearing that the owner/management is the epitome of Bengali cooking

Kewpie’s ,  located behind the Netaji Bhavan  , at Elgin road, near Bhawanipur,  was formerly  a  bungalow  converted into a restaurant  which has now made quite a name for itself in authentic  Bengali Cuisine. The meals here are served on the earthenware made of clay & covered with Banana Leaf.Everything  , including the tumblers  too are of the same material! 
Famous for its veg & non-veg Thala’s  (Plate) of varied price range , some of  its exotic  non-veg  dishes include  the Bhapa Elish,  Dab-Chingri , Prawn Malai Curry, Kankrar Jhal  , apart from Chitol  Macher  Muitha &  Pabda Macher  Jhal not to forget the  Bhetki  Paturi and  the Kassa  Pathar Mangsho ! Some of the  popular vegetarian dishes are   Moong Mohan Dal , Sukto , Begun Bhaja  & Panch Mishali Shobji, Posto Bata etc .If one opts for the Kewpie’s Special Thala priced around  775/- , he can expect to get 3-Non-veg  (main course) which include some of the dishes as mentioned above.Sweets & Paan too are a part of this package!
Select  dishes from a la carte clubbed with the vegetarian Thala makes a good combination!
I feel that the portion offered here  is lesser when  compared with the price, unlike other popular restaurants offering similar Bengali style food.
Meal for two will cost anything between 1200/- to 1500/- without taxes & can shoot up more depending upon your choice of non-veg dishes!
The ambience is nice  and worth a visit , specially  those with  a liking for Bengali cuisine! One will always come across people from various parts of the globe dropping in for lunch or dinner!
P.S: Please make your reservations during weekend visits. Also note that possibly the restaurant remains closed on Mondays.

I completely do agree with all the reviewers. This place is very much hyped, neither do they serve the best bengali cuisine nor their service is something you can like. Dab chingri, Gota mashla mangso and fish fry are good and few others are okay too, but definitely you can get much better in other establishments. You get a feeling of them to be kinda snob,yes, many others in Kolkata are similarly snob, Flurys, Mocambo, Shiraz and Chung wah are a few to name them, but, difference is they are god in one very important point, their food are still best in their class, but, Kewpies really give you a let down in this. Not highly recommended.

We availed kewpise through groupoun in last Saturday but its menu is not as good as given in the deal and all the magazines. They made daab chingri with small prawns and taste is worst I have ever had in my life. Our assumptionion is daab chingri is made with only bagda chingri or galda chingri. In case of desert we asked for 'misti doi and sandesh' and 'desert of the day' but they said that 'misti doi and sandesh' is their desert of the day on 27th july 2013 . Then we ordered for 'misti doi and sandesh' but they serverd us two 'rotten payesh' to our table and also in our neighbour table. Both the table occupiers tasted and said that 'payesh' is stinking but waiters said that the large quantity of 'elachi dust' is the reason for 'rotten payesh' . They were argueing that payesh is in good condition instead of replacing the orders. My suuggestion is don't try in kewpise anymore . If they are not sure about their food condition then they should not serve this to the customers and if they are not sure about the food and service then they should not promote thorough gropoun as gropoun is a very reliable deal partner. We availed The SONNET , De Sovarni , Himalayan Cafe through groupon.

I tried out this oldest of Kolkatta Bengali restaurants on an offer from GROUPON. We paid 499 for 2 Niramish Thalas.

What I absolutely loved: the location and ambience. In a time when most restaurants feel the need to have sterile interiors, Kewpie's hearty embracing of an old Kolkata mansion is refreshing. The red oxide floors, the high ceilings, knick knacks from by gone era in the shelves, the stolid charm of the furniture, the paintings on the wall--all are charming and very becoming. Even the way the thali was served: with bowls arranged in a semi circle recalled another time and a different kind of food culture.

Coming to the food, we ordered an extra aam porar shorbot which was slightly bland. The waiter also insisted on mineral water which was expensive and unnecessary.

kewpie's is an ethnic bengali restaurant behind netaji bhavan,elgin road.there are 3 rooms,with no many tables.so its always packed around 2 pm.there are shades of bengali history and cutlure on the walls and the decor is ministrant to infuse you with the spirit of being "bhumiputra" (borrowing a term from the late bal thackerey).they have 4-5 different thalis to offer other than ala carte.thalis are extensive and with extra portion of rice and this and that,it would suffice for two.the fish and prawn items are well made,succulent,and lives upto the billing.they also serve mutton,the delectable "kosha mangsho".the only things that wouldnt indulge epicureans are the small amount of serving of the items they offer(which are extensive,though),the unreasonably late service,the brusque absence of waiters to wait on you or toe around you.i believe this is a management problem and can be addressed.the price is a bit high for thalis,but again,they serve too many items thus  justifying the quote.

Visited with family and had a terrible experience.

Service: the staff does not care about Indians, gori chamdi is what you must have to get any worthwhile service, otherwise you are treated like an Indian kutta. Service is horribly slow, uncaring, and on the border of being rude. 

Food: the dab chingri's concoction was cooked outside the dab with tonnes of mustard and served in a dab. Luchi was okay with mangaho. 

Overall, too much hype, pathetic service, bad food. 

DON'T GO!

The owner is a celebrity and promoted as encyclopeadie of bengali cooking. Uh... well....

I agree with the other reviewers, very few dishes here are good, and the others are plain average. I dont think I have had anything bad here, cons I would say are imperfect seasoning with certain spicy dishes - but not horrible to eat, just a disappointment for the hype.

I do like the old colonial home ambience and decor. The staff is run of the mill - unaware that they work in a 'gourmet restaurant' i am guessing, half of whom are decent and polite, and few other indifferent gruff people. And only bengali is spoken here, and most staff are unhelpful, except for the few polite ones. Do not bring non bengali folk here who have to fend for themselves, they are on their own.  No translation, language skills of any kind can be found here that is not bengali. 

Other issues are those associated with family run restaurants: restaurant closed when owner is on vacation, lot of items in menu not available, or run out if you are late, long wait times on crowded days, etc.. 

Bhajohori Manna scores above and beyond this restaurant, where food is concerned.

We had lunch here in March 2013. The dining room is very nice. Very few other customers. The food was excellent and came in a timely manner. We had the fish thali, which came with 2-3 subjees, two fish dishes, puris, rice and dessert. They even accomodated my request to change the subjee offered to a different subjee. My only complaint is that, although the thali was sufficient to share between adult and child, it was still very expensive for two people. The fish thali was Rs.620. Probably one of the better places to find excellent Bengali food in Kolkata, but it seems all the excellent Bengali restaurants are too expensive....

Update from November 2014,
Quite a few visits later, things have improved. Most notably the service, probably due to being a known face. The food seems the same, therefore taste is a known. Its not great food, but its mostly safe for tourists, being easy on the system. The last time I visited a few days back, the Bhetki Paturi did not taste as it should have... kind of low on flavour.
Prices have hit a high. The fixed meal with two fish items and a meat costs about INR 900... very steep. Also, they need to do more with the desserts. A mild sandesh and curd will not do! The paan seems to have improved by a good margin.

------------------------------------------------
Went for dinner on 10 Jan 2013.
Probably the worst food I have had here.
1. Food took very long to be served.
2. Aam Pora Shorbot was reasonably tasteless. Served at room temperature.
3. Begun bhaja I have had much better. Dal decent.
4. Alu dum served cold.
5. Fish fry was decent but somehow didn't have the expected delicateness.
6. The Kochi Pathar Jhol was so disappointing. Tasteless. Nothing in the taste to make one want to have more. Meat pieces could have been better.
7. Service wasn't top notch. Thali was served with spilled dal. I asked them to remove the rice and they did not clean the banana leaf out completely. I would have expected that.
8. The mishti (sandesh) never really gels with the rest of the food.

It's astonishing how misled we can get about this place. Terribly over-hyped. It's horrible. Like a designer brand though it does have its' patrons.
As far as service goes, don't bother showing up if you're not a foreigner. If you're an Indian, and are not 'bhodrolok' material be ready for rudeness run amok. I've been there 4 times and everytime it's the same.
The food is good no doubt, but the quantities would make Oliver Twist riot for seconds. Just too little and very, very over priced. All in all not a good experience at all. Point to note: If you really want to have authentic bengali food, head over to the eateries frequented by the locals. I had better food, with better quantities in the Gariahat main market. And at less than half the price.

I have never had a thali at Kewpie's but I have dined on their A-La-Carte menu frequently. I wont say they serve the best begali food in Kolkata but they are certainly one of the better restaurants to eat Bengali to partake of Bengali food. Their Alu Dum and Cholar Dal are really good and can be had with warm soft luchi's. Among the seafood I recommend the Bhekti Fry, Elish bhapa or Chingri Malai curry. They also make a good Kosha Mangsho . I like the ambience its not fancy but has an old world feel and they have a semi private room to accommodate about 8 persons if you book in advance.

I completely agree with Dr. Pal; this is the overpriced and MOST over-rated bengali restaurant; I guess this is possible because of the owner's very good PR skills.
The food was not bad, but nothing in the category of awesome.
Also the bespectacled manager and his 2/ 3 staff were extremely rude and constantly asking us to finish fast, as they were closing. Also they served us few dishes (like papad) which we had not ordered (thought complementary)and charged us.
I want this shit restaurant in the name of authenticity to close ASAP. It is a disgrace.Also cost for 2 is definitely not 600 rupees for decent items.

The restaurant occupies the ground floor of the owners property in a narrow alleyway off elgin road, not the easiest or most glamorous of locations to get to and you have to get out of your car and walk for around 10 mins to get to it.the food quantity is not great at all ..Even the mishti at the end would beat a weight watchers size any day.

If you see Chinese people eating at a Chinese Restaurant you like to frequent then you're at the right place extending that definition to Kewpies..you will see a lot of Bengalis here and that has to speak volumes on the quality and kind of Bengali food they churn out. Rakhi Purnina Dasgupta's interiors give a very nostalgic and ethnic feel to the entire dining experience. 
Ive been here on a number of occasions and generally found myself hosting my 'non-bong' business associates. My wife even had her 'Bou-Bhat' hosted here. If you're looking for authentic bengali cuisine in Kolkata, Kewpies comes highly recommended!

This is the most overpriced, over rated, over-hyped bengali restaurant in Kolkata.. Every food item served here is extremely poor both in quality & in quantity, even home cooked foods are more tasty & delicious than these foods served here.. service is very poor also,waiters are not well mannered and cooperative.. They dont have plain water also,we had to buy a mineral water bottle with rs 36!!! avg cost of eating here is rs 500, if u dont want to waste your money then avoid this 3rd class restaurant..
