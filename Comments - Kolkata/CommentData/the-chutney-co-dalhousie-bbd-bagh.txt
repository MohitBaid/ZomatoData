This place is like heaven for south indian food lovers.
I had book marked this place quite a long time ago but today I finally had a chance to visit it. Got bored of having mughlai and chinese so decided to eat something else for a change.
I am quite sure that if Dosas are being served in heaven then it would be tasting almost similar to the one's served here.
It's the bestest dosa I have ever eaten in Kolkata.
And it definitely is among my best Dosas eaten by me in other places of India. I have tried Dosas from almost every city I have ever visited.
I had the cheese butter paper masala dosa. I was served with 3 chutney's and sambhar along with the dosa. The chutneys as the name suggests were pure love. They were lip-smackingly amazing.
Definitely would visit this place again and again.

Incredible choice for South Indian lovers. Guests are welcomed with a shared signage with that of Piccadilly Square. Both chutney company and Piccadily Square are owned by the same owners and have done pretty well in maintaining their name. The old buildings of Dalhousie houses both these amazing restaurants and see waiting time of more than 15-20 minutes in some cases. Parking is an issue as you cannot park on the main road. You have to go behind the governor's place and Park your vehicle there.
The seating space is Lavish with wooden flooring and ornate decors across the walls. Service is wonderful as there will be many people surrounding you to serve you.

Food: welcome to the world of chutneys. The amazing palette of chutneys will greet you. They have garlic chutney, tomato, spicy coconut, onion and the like. The dosas are savoury and can be had with the Rava version, or the normal version. Thanks to Piccadilly Square we can have waffles, pancakes, Pizzas, crepes, burgers etc. I chose the focaccia sandwich where you can custom make your sandwich just like Subway. The pancakes are bliss. The waffles and donuts, especially the chocolate ones are amazing. Although the hazelnut Donuts was a bit dry, but the pancakes were superb.
The mexican burger was also very good. Coming to the shakes, the banana caramel shake stole the show. We also had chocolate hazelnut shake as well, which was pretty well upto the mark. We signed off with signature filter coffee and wow what a coffee.
All in all we had a great Experience At The chutney company. Great food. Great decor. What else do you want!!

The Chutney Co. runs along with the Piccadilly Square and together they are creating wonder. South Indian with desserts and bakery. Both are champions in their own fields.

The chutney co serves south indian and it is simply superb in it. We were a group of around 16 along with kids and everyone enjoyed every bit.

The dosas were the crispiest I would have ever had. SImply mind-blowing. Just like papad. Well i like crisp...be it rotis or dosas.

We also tried their special 6 inches idly and it was the softest idly we could ever have. Really a masterpiece.

They serve several types of chutneys and each one is tasty and special in their own way. The only thing which we did not like was the Uttappam. Not tasty or better say not as we expected.

The service is also good and the decor is also nice. Tables are also too good and wide. Good big menu for south indian lovers.

A must visit for south indian lovers. It is just above the famous electronics company Great Eastern and the location is BBD Bag, Dalhousie. Highly recommended by me.

One of the best dosa places I‚Äôve been to is this place. They serve a chutney platter which is USP and if you‚Äôve a South Indian craving, you should definitely try this place out. They also serve Italian which is also amazing especially the crepes they serve! The waffles are truly Belgian which is just like a Cherry to the cake! Go there, fill in yourself with all the South Indian delights and do not forget the intriguing desserts they offer. It‚Äôs an affordable place too, not to forget.

One of the best south indian food joint in Kolkata. Definitely justifies its name The Chutney Co as it provides 9 varieties of chutney. Spicy tomato, garlic and sweet onion tomato chutney were different and nice. Molagapodi Mysore idli is a 6inch long idli which is its uniqueness. Karampodi dosa suggested by the waiter to us is there special dosa but not listed in menu is great‚Äã to taste & the uniqueness about it is that it does not have a proper filing of vegetables, it's a magic created with masalas. Service & ambience gets thumps up.  Definitely a place to visit for south indian lovers.

This place was in my wishlist for a really long time. Finally, I got a chance to visit this place with my friends.
It is located at Dalhousie, at the upper floor of the Great Eastern. They even share their space with The Piccadilly Square, which is like extra masala in masala Maggi. :p
Okay, now let's talk about the place.. It was very nicely decorated, with different types of lights and frames. They have covered a good area for their sitting arrangement. We went on a week day for lunch, so we got the table immediately but do not visit this place on Sundays without prior reservations. Else, you might have to wait long for your turn.
Coming to the food, we ordered :
My Masala Dosa with Cheese & Onion - 5/5
Dania Dosa - 4.5/5
Molagapodi Dosa - 4/5
Mysore Masala Dosa - 4.5/5
Each came with proper presentation and with different type of chutneys, we were craving for!
Each and every chutney tasted amazing.
Molagapodi Dosa had a really unique presentation like a big inverted cone, it had cheese gun powder inside it's layers.
All the Dosa tasted really good but my masala Dosa touched my soul.
Total bill was 980 (INR) inclusive of taxes, which is quite a decent amount.
I really loved the taste and would definitely love to visit this place again!
Should definitely try this place with family or friends.

I was literally dragged here for lunch today as I have promised myself to eat healthy before Durga Pujo. But then I thought dhosa should be healthy. So I went there from Court along with a close friend of mine. It was her plan basically as she has these sudden cravings. She ordered butter masala dhosa and chaanch. I ordered uppu huli dhosa ( from their special menu ) as it is supposed to be light and filter coffee. The best part is the 6 types of chutneys you get here. I had a great lunch here and looking forward to be here again.

The server was too humble and greeted us with overwhelming warmth. The appearance was also good. The variety of dishes and Chutneys u get is way...too much, hence one is advice not to waste the Chutney !
The south-indian experience was a 5 star, but Piccadilly's Desert was not that good..it was 3.5 out of 5, whereas overall experience was a 4.5 
Would wish to come and visit Again !

Plastic sticks found in Popeye sticks. When we complained the manager's reply was that we are sorry. We said we need to talk to your manager and inform the owner of such negligence. He refused and said that he cannot disturb the owner on a sunday for such a small thing,totally disregarding the customer's risk of having it. Repeatedly argued and dint agree to even giving an apology letter. Finally, the owner was called but she is yet to confirm what action will be taken.

Located just opposite to Lalit The Great Eastern / beside the Raj Bhavan. Famous for the different Chutneys that it serves with some lip smacking South India delicacies. Hungry and want to eat something healthy, bump into this South Indian restaurant, that serves all kind of South Indian dishes.
Staffs are polite, service is too quick, doesn't keeps us waiting for long.
Dishes that we've ordered:
Podi cheese dosa : dosa sprinkled with podi masala and has generous amount of cheese grated. This dish is worth the money you spend on it.
Onion masala dosa : soft dosa with onion filled in it along with the masala.
Pizza uttapam : Here comes a twist when uttapam is made just like a pizza is made, base of uttapam on top of it is tomato sauce after which it has some toppings which includes tomato, onion and capsicum. Last but not not the least mozzarella cheese! Do go for ordering this dish
Molgapodi Mysore idli : The big, fat and the most spongy idli you would ever have. Topped with ghee amd podi masala. 
Tomato sevai : I found this dish average it's sevai with tomato, channa dal and curry pata.

To be noted with each dish thay you order they provide sambhar and Three Chutneys that you can choose from the menu, the reason why this restaurant has it's name The Chutney Co as it servers 9 different varieties of Chutneys.

One good thing is that food of chutney co and desserts of picadilly square can be served to you on the same table.
We have ordered Cheese masala dosa and mysore dossa. Cheese masala dosa was very good but mysore dosa was not up to the expectations. We also complained about the mysore dosa but the reply we got was that this is the only taste of this dosa. Pan cake (choco) of picadilly square was just superb.
Ambience is normal. Recommended for south indian foods with good desserts.

Expectations were high, so was the appetite.... And as you can see in the 'Rating', both were settled up perfectly.... The very name of the restaurant gives you hint on the delicacy you are about to experience.... We tried the famous 'Molagapodi Dosa' & 'Popeye's Pick'.... The Dosa comes with three Chutneys (you have to pick from the list of nine & though it's your personal choice & each tastes delicious, my personal favourite is the raw mango one) and Samvar.... The Dosa is a must try as it is completely different from the normal one we get.... 'Popeye's Pick' is also very delicious and carries a unique taste to make you buy it oftentimes.... Will definitely visit again.... Recommended....

The Molagopadi Dosa was the first time I heard and the first time I ever had.And trust me,its worth trying.The Dosa is lined with a particular dal( I am not sure of the name of the dal) that makes it feel like gunpowder in mouth (as exactly described by the staff) and tastes like heaven.You get to choose any three chutney of your choice and it has lot of ranges.
I am not giving it a full rating because I am yet to visit again and try more.
So it's subject to improvement is all I can hope.
Other than that it is has a fine ambience,comfortable seating and good lighting.
The staff is polite and helpful,always at your behest.
I had a wonderful time.Thank you Chutney Co.
Also do fill up the feedback,you get discount for next time visits and cost is very reasonable.

I went there last week with my colleagues for lunch. First, let's talk about ambiance. Since this restaurant is specialized for South Indian cuisine, so its decor was crafted accordingly. It is sober and decent. The waiters are all well trained and polite. Now, let's talk about the most important thing. Yeah, food it is. ¬†As it's name indicates, ¬†chutneys are the most mouth drooling items among all. You can find almost 12-15 variants of them. We ordered idil, moglipudi¬†dosa,dhania dosa and choco fudge ice cream. I want to say something about idli, the best idli I have ever tasted. It was so soft and cooked nicely. Moreover, all the items were superb and well cooked. I want to visit this place once again.

A great place indeed. In one word "Fantabulous". Great veg only place. Clean environment in the office hub of Kolkata i.e. Dalhausie. They serve great Italian as well as South Indian cuisine. U may call them the No. 1 restaurant serving this much variety when it comes to South Indian Cuisine. So many kinds of Dosa that u will always end up coming back for some more. They are specialists when It comes to Chutneys as the name suggests. They serve three complimentary chutneys with every south indian dish. Come and visit this popular place. Worth a visit. Cheers!!!!

Went for the first time while meeting a friend who had come into town and was staying at the Great Eastern Hotel right opposite...while the decor is not obtrusive, the food is pretty good...my friend ordered a Masala dosa while I had to settle for a Rava dosa..I had hoped to find a Rava idli on the menu but was disappointed. The Masala dosa came with the Masala on the side while my Rava dosa seemed a bit oily..It was also crisp like a paper dosa which is not my usual preference but that is my fault for not specifying what I wanted.
What was impressive is the array of chutneys you are offered starting from the basic coconut chutney to a garlic chutney and a lauki (curaikkay) chutney...I opted for raw mango, garlic and lauki, all of which were good. The Chutney Co. is well worth more than a single visit.

I was looking for a best South Indian food in Kolkata. My friend from Hyderabad suggested me this name The Chutney. She was not sure if I could find the same in Kolkata. Here I found it and I was more so excited to visit this place.

We ordered Molagapodi Dosa which is too awesome and it comes with eight different chutneys. Each of them in delicious and has thier own greatness. One such dosa is well sufficient for single hungry person. Then we ordered a Pizza Uttapam which is a unique food i have ever seen. The presentation is good. Taste is delicious.

There is lot more in the menu for which I will be visiting soon.

A must visit place for vegetarians. In such few pure vegetarian places in Kolkata, Chutney Co. Stands apart to provide amazing items to vegetarians. It has partnered up with Picaddily square to widen the variety of menu from just South Indian to Italian and desserts.
This place is famous for its chutneys. On any order of dosa, it gives 8 different kinds of Chutneys, out of which 5-6 chutneys are amazing. Others can be kept aside :-P
We ordered Rava Dosa, Cheese Masala Dosa, Paper Onion masala dosa and Masala Dosa. There was a also a special kind of dosa which the waiter suggested us. It was not in the menu and we tried it. It was full of different kind of spices and gave a typical south Indian flavour. Pizza Uttapam is a strange item where pizza toppings are put over a uttapam. Its good for one time try.
Place is convenient in location, being located above Great Eastern, Esplanade. This place is favourable for Families and friends and large groups. 
Overall I had a great experience and for the love of South Indian and pancakes I will visit again.

This place is not extraordinary, but then all the things one would expect in a good restaurant are there. I chose one of the tables adjacent to the glass window facing Great Eastern. Where most restaurants nowadays are 'closed' with no 'window to the world', this is a welcome change.¬†

The food is enjoyable. I ordered a Masala Dosa. The sambar was not authentic 'South Indian' in its taste and there was even a tinge of sweetness! But then their concept of three types of chutneys is interesting and the chutneys are tasty. I guess it justifies their name!! I also had a chocolate waffle - it was heavenly sinful!!

The service is prompt.

An amazing restaurant with excellent service! Located bang opposite the Lalit Great Eastern, this is one of the few good South Indian restaurants in Kolkata. Plus other varieties of Piccadilly Square add to the menu as well. Their speciality is the 9 varieties of chutneys offered, all of which are equally tasty. Apart from the south Indian food, we ordered Popeye's Pick and Dublin Mudslide Waffle. Popeye's Pick is an amazing dish with corn and cheese inside, and cheese sauce spread all over. The Dublin Mudslide Waffle is an awesome chocolate dessert and is a must try. Adding to the amazing food, the staff are really friendly and warm. Overall a great experience.

A place for Biriyani or Chinese cuisine or Bengali item, Okk, we are used to it. But a place known for its Chutney is really something extra special that you don‚Äôt get in market usually. Well, The Chutney Co. is such kinda restaurant that are famous for their South Indian Dish and Chutney.

Location ‚Äì The restaurant is just on the upper floor of great Eastern, Dalhousie and shares the same room with The Picadilly Square.

Decoration ‚Äì The place is well decored with Lighting, wall posters, painting and wall arts. Basic chair table sitting arrangements but nicely matched with the ambiance. Music on background, neat & clean, well maintained, overall a perfect spot to dine in with your love one or family.

Stuffs and management ‚Äì This is also one sector, where the restaurant is maintaining its status with strong hand. All stuffs are very professional, suggestive & very much aware to keep their customer satisfied. Wither you need water or extra sambar or extra chutney, they are very much aware of it.

Food ‚Äì After discussing with one of the Stuff, we ordered Molagapodi Dosa and Masala Rava Dosa. I‚Äôve tried Rava Dosa before, but never have the other one, so was really curious about it. Lets come and see, how it was‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Masala Rava Dosa ‚Äì Rava Dosa is basically made out of Suji(Semolina). Unlike other dosa, it was square in shape, crispy in nature. The think the crispy nature is due to Semolina. Well fried and comes with their legendary Chutneys. As it was Masala Dosa, the masala(Mashed potato and onion) was served in a separate bowl. The dosa with the masala, really tastes good. Try it, cz it is not like regular dosa that you get in every South Indian Dosa.

Molagapodi Dosa ‚Äì The name of the dosa seems really different na? Yes, the shape and the taste of the Dosa is really totally different than traditional dosa. The shape of the dosa is like cone shape with few spiral layers inside. But the main thing of the dosa was hidden in the inner layer of the dosa. The inner layer was fully coated with a powder, which seems like cheesy flavored Horlicks powder. They call it Gunpowder, which really burst out in your mouth. Chutneys with it, makes another heaven.  The Garlic Chutney and Spicy coconut chutney was exceptionally good. Must try item here, wither you love dosa or not.

Pricing ‚Äì With two dosa mentioned above, it cost us only 350INR inclusive of all taxes, which is really a decent pricing. They served three chutney with each dosa, but as we ordered two dosa, they give us all nine chutney they have without taking any extra price. After billing ,they ask you to provide feedback and your contact details and they send you discount coupon tjat you can use on your next visit! So a big thumps up to the management for their courtesy and decent pricing.

In conclusion I will say, this place is truly heaven for each and every South Indian Dish lovers. The Dosa, chutney and sambar will really melt your hearts down. I usually don‚Äôt give any restaurant 5.0 rating, but this is probably the first time, I‚Äôm giving any restaurant top rating. The serves of the best dosa of their own kind along with their legendary Chutney. Overall a must visit place for each one, wither you like South Indian dish or not. Overall a super dining experience!

It's a nice clean Dosa place with a twist, which comes in the form of the chutneys they serve as condiments.There is a raw mango with garlic chutney, a tomato chutney and in total 6 chutneys apart from the regular sambar. Dosas are standard. Service is quick. Worth a try for their speciality chutneys.

We discovered this place on Zomato by chance while looking for something different in the BBD Bag area.. This place is owned by Piccadilly Square management, who are famous for their waffles.. Easy to locate just opposite to Great Eastern Hotel, this restaurant is located on the 1st floor of the building.. What I liked about this place was the soothing and calm interiors amidst the hustle and bustle of the busiest part of Kolkata.. The ambience is elegantly done with modern decors and chique interiors.. They boast an open kitchen and the varied varieties of chutneys served as compliments..
Coming to the food, they do serve a larger variety of Dosas than you will find in most other South Indian restaurants of Kolkata.. Though a bit confused, we zeroed on:
¬†Cheese Plain Dosa: Disappointing, not as much cheesy as one will expect it to be.. The only respite were the delectable chutneys served with it..
Paper Masala Dosa: This one was still better.. Loved the crispness of the dosa which tasted just perfect.. Liked the fact that they served the masala separately to retain the crunchiness of the dosa..
Sambar Vada: Nothing significant about it.. Definitely I had better vadas in Kolkata itself, and given the price charged one shall expect something way better..
Seasons Surprise Waffle: You can‚Äôt end a meal here without tasting their supremely lip-smacking waffles.. This one also didn‚Äôt disappoints us.. Loved the assortment of color on the plate with fresh fruits and vanilla cream.. The waffle was crunchy, smooth with a nice aroma of the pastry..
Overall, it was indeed a different experience and definitely tasting the 7-8 varieties of chutneys was the most memorable part of the visit.. Our total cheque was Rs.681/- (all incl.) for the entire spread..

This place is a heaven for people who like South Indian food.
The food is served with various chutneys, all of them taste so different and yet so good.
The dosas are thin and well cooked.
The service is fast and staffs are courteous.
Pocket pinch is very reasonable.

The place shares its dining space with Piccadilly square. While one serves unusual south indian cusisine, the latter serves great pan cakes and crepes. The south indian dishes at the chutney co is a delight. The molagopadi dosa and the dhania dosa were a delight. The variety of chutneys served by them is great. Highlight was the uttapam pizza. Gunpowder masala inside the molagipadi dosa was unique. service was very prompt and the place was quite comfortable. Sadly, the freddo was not upto the mark. All n all a soothing experience..

A place known for Chutneys is something rare. The Chutney Co. is located just on the 1st floor of the opposite building of Lalit Great Eastern. Lets dip a finger into their chutneys & try it...

Decorations : The Chutney Co. shares a common dining with The Picadilly Square. The place is beautifully decored with lightings, wall arts & posters. The sitting are also very nice matching with the ambience. The place is enough good if you want to bring your girl as well as your family.

Staffs & Management : Staffs over here are very professional & knows really well to keep their customers satisfied. They're well behaved & fast enough. After their suggestions we ordered the following...

Molagapodi Dosa : Molagapodi Dosa was as different as its name. It was served in a shape of cone along with their 9 famous chutneys and sambar. The dosa was made in layers & also very big in size. But the main surprise was hidden into those layers. With each & every layer there were full of spices known as Gun Powder. This powder tasted like Horlicks with the flavour of cheese. It tasted totally different than any dosa I've ever tatsed & I'm talking about good taste. Chutneys on the other hand was of another world. Garlic Chutney & Spicy Coconut Chutney tasted exceptionally good, also the sambar was sweet & delicious. This Gun Powder Dosa is a must try over here doesn't matter you love South Indian food or not.

Masala Rava Dosa : Rava Dosa is basically made out of Semolina (Suji). Unlike other dosas it was in square shape served flat on the plate. This dosa was much more crispier than the previous one because of its main ingredient. Masala in this case mashed cooked potato & onion was served separately in a bowl. Again with their delicious chutneys all of it tasted very very good. Another rare dosa with the decent taste that you wouldn't find very easily.

Pricing : I was highly surprised after seeing our bill for above mentioned items was only Rs. 349 along with the hated vat, service tax & cess. This makes it a really cheap & decent option. Every penny you spent over here you get double the taste from it. Management gets a big thumps up for keeping the prices low & reasonable.

Conclusion : This place is purely heaven for South Indian food lovers. Usually I don't rate 5 star but this time I couldn't hold myself back. They serve one of the best Dosas along with one of the best Chutneys out there. This place is highly recommended even if you aren't a big fan of South Indian foods.

The flourishing ambience of the restaurant is overwhelming. Especially for me who love eating South Indian food. The speciality of the place i.e Chutneys is best represented with its balanced taste. Though it is known to be spicy in most of their Chutneys, it is still apprehended with sour, sweet, salty, and bitter flavours. One thing that I can't resist is the taste of Gun powder Dosa ! My meal is not complete without it. Therefore you must try it too if you haven't yet. So help yourself and find your way there !!

This cafe is located in the first floor of a building( in front of the old Great Eastern hotel; now a Lalit Eastern.).The choice of food is decent. The food is great - would recommend the pizza uttapam and the molgai podi idlis. Their selection of 9 chutneys is impressive as each one tastes really relish. Most impressive is the service with the waiters coming and replenishing the sambar and chutneys before you even ask them for it. ¬†A decent restaurant with good south indian food.

The worst service provided by a restaurant . I had ordered plain idli , Mysore idli , plain vada , rava dosa , masala dosa and Mysore dosa . First the guys served us idlis with cold sambar and on top of that gave the rava dosa with the idli's .Every south indian restaurant knows that dosa's are not served with idli's and are served after the idlis . After the idlis were done we had to wait for 30 minutes for just a plate of masala dosa and mysore dosa which wasn't served even after waiting for 30 minutes . In the end we got fed up and had to cancel the dosa orders . The staff were extremely rude and kept on giving different excuses . Grossly overpriced for the kind of service provided . I would not recommended this restaurant to anyone wanting to go for a south Indian meal . A very bad experience

The ambience is good,the tables are not too close to make dining a cramped experience. The staff are very helpful and courteous and service too is good. But what I found amazing was that two restaurants share a common seating area. This is truly two for the price of one!!! Or we could even say...It's based on the concept...Buy one and get one free!!! The south Indian food was tasty and it lives up to its name...The chutney company....They served us a vast array of chutneys, the likes of which I've never been served before in any South Indian food joint!! And all the chutneys were delicious. The dosa was hot and crisp and the sambaar too was hot and tasty. The " kaapi" served in traditional steel glass and bowl was aromatic and good.
A good place, definitely recommended.

One fine Friday evening as I was looking for taking the early route to my home from office, I got a call for visiting this place. Strolling along the path we stopped by The Chutney Company, and took the stairs to the first floor for getting ourselves seated.

This is a very first restaurant I have been to which shares a common seating area with another restaurant named Piccadilly Square. If you want to visit either The Chutney Company or Piccadilly Square, you need to end up in the same place. This place is located on Dalhouise Square just opposite to The Lalit Great Eastern on Hemanta Basu Sarani and beside The Corporation Bank located on the first floor.

The interior of the shared outlet is dimly lit, the seats are aptly paced and has a sweet d√©cor going good on one‚Äôs eyes. Though they share the sitting space, their kitchen is totally separate and located opposite to each other.

We got ourselves seated and looked at the menus of both. We decided to have a shake from The Chutney Company and then decide on having from the next restru, ie, Piccadilly Square. I requested for a Pista Badam Shake which was not available and then he suggested for Chocolate Shake which was also at the back of my mind but not present on the menu, and we all decided to go for it. Fiddling with the other menu, I realised that the Chocolate Shake was listed on Piccadilly Square menu and felt little childish and not checking both of the menus out simultaneously. However, I decided to have South Indian Coffee next, in the vow to taste both the outlets at one visit.

While waiting for our orders, I decided to click some shots of the ambiance for posting here on Zomato. On clicking few shots, I was abruptly stopped by a person wearing a black tees with ‚ÄúPiccadilly Square‚Äù logo on his attire. He asked if I am an agent to which I replied in negation citing that I am a customer and clicking pictures just because I happen to regularly review. He still requested me not to click any pictures of the machinery. I apologised and was about to click the pics of ambiance for which I was stopped too. I argued this time saying that I am not clicking pictures of machinery but of ambiance. He still asked me to stop. I inquired if he is the Store Manager to which he did not reply. I even asked him if he is talking on behalf of The Chutney Company too or not, to which he just asked me not to click pictures even of ambiance but can click personal pictures with friends only. I did not further argue with him and sat in my place waiting for my order.

After completing the shake, we ordered for the coffee which was delivered rather fast. It was served in traditional South Indian style. The coffee tasted okayish and nothing great.

The behaviour of the waiter was really admirable. They were polite and very soft spoken. If they have had given the same amount of training to the other staffs, this dual outlet would be having me as a loyal customer.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Well yea, we can pay a visit and experience it.

Qs) Why have I rated them 3.5 stars?
Ans) Solely based on the taste of South Indian Coffee (which is The Chutney Company item) and the with the interaction with the staffs.

Located opposite Lalit Great Eastern hotel. Ambience is comforting. It shares its place with picadily square. Coming to food we ordered - Onion Rava Masala Dosa, Onion Uttapam and plain Idly. All the dishes were spectacular and lip smacking. The prices are quite generous. The quantity and quality of food is amazing. The variety of nine chutneys that they serve is phenomenal.

Coming to food we ordered- Paper Masala Dosa, Masala Dosa,  Assorted Uttapam Platter,  Cheese masala dosa, Poppeye's Pick Crepe , Blueberry mojito, Green apple mojito , Summer blush, Filter coffee and Chocolate fetish.
All the dishes were spectacular and the summer blush was awesome.

The prices are quite generous and the quality and quality of food is amazing! 
Lastly the variety of 9 chutneys that they serve is phenomenal and we liked the garlic chutney and the spicy coconut chutney the mmost! :)

This seemed to be the South Indian Paradise of Kolkata! I went in my friends and ordered three dosas and got to taste all the chutneys. Only the dhania and raw mango chutney wasn't available. The food is delicious and pocket friendly. The service was efficient and good. This place definitely needs to be visited more than once!

 A very satisfying experience.

This fantastic place has best of both the world's and can only be justified by a 5.0 rating which we've given. Given that it is located in a high traffic road and on the first floor it may seem easily missed if you're not looking for it. However a big signage assures that it  catches the eye even if you're not looking for it. The interiors are eccentric if not fascinating for a South Indian joint, however given that it shares it's space with a popular dessert joint, Piccadilly square, it starts making more sense. The South Indian Menu offers a condensed and limited choice but guarantees delectable dishes in each serving. Piccadilly square on the other hand offer popular options like Pizzas, Pastas, crepes etc. Making for an interesting mix well deserving of the family structure of most Indian Families

As the dishes do not need much describing, we will summarize the ones we had and leave the decision for your order in your own hands.

Idlis come in three kinds - Plain, with gunpowder (secret powdery mix made with pulses and spices)  sprinkled on top and one which is a massive idli incredibly soft and also with gunpowder.

Dosas are paper thin and wafery from the get go. Masala is as expected from an authentic udipi in the rural heartland and lipsmackingly so. The podi dosa ( with gunpowder ) is out of this world. Shaped like tent withe innards brimming with the powder every bite is delectable. A must have for sure. The uttapams especially the onion uttapam we had was just perfect.

The desserts offer a big variety and though a bit expensive offer great value for money with their quality. Waffles are however our pick and recommended.

The surprise is the number of chutneys accompanying the dishes.they have a total of 9 ( or was it 12) chutneys including coconut, tomato, garlic, tamarind, sweet onion, dips and one with a green veggie we will keep secret. Every season has a different mix of chutneys.

Overall if you've not been here, it begs the question why not and when!!

Location-Dalhousie BBD bagh,Kolkata.

This restaurant shares its seating with piccadilly square.It's an authentic south indian restaurant where along with idlis and dosas you can have italian food and european dessert.You will find this place mostly filled with office people and during weekends it usually remains crowded.

Service-The service at this place is quite slow but the staff is too cooperative with their customers.They need to improve it at the earliest as its the only negative point about this place.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are quite good and the seating is also comfortable.They can accomodate approximately 40 people at a time.

Food-The food at this place is just finger licking.Especially their serving of variety of chutneys is praiseworthy.Though some of the food items are quite costly but overall its worth it.We had-
1:Ghee masala dosa
2:Sambhar vada
3:Molagapodi idli

Food-4.5/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4/5

A good place to have the south indian cuisines.

This place is near to my office.. thats centre point dalhousie, opposite to Lalit Great Eastern Hotel, on the first floor of great eatern electronics shop.
We had to wait for half an hour to get a table.. the sitting area is not so big as its shares with Picaddily Square. The interiors are quite simple and ambience was usually of office people. Servicing was quite slow we ordered our food and got them after arnd 30mins..
I tried their ghee masala dosa, they have these south indians with a twist.. thats choice i
Of chutneys other than the regular coconut chutney.. with each item they serve 3 types of chutneys.. dosa was crisp, masala was normal in taste, and the chutneys as their name suggests had twisty flavours.
Then i tried Pizza uttapam.. it had amazing taste.. tge concept was great base was of uttapam and toppings of pizza.. it was nice to eat.
Then i had taken mini assorted uttapam.. where they had 3 small uttapam of onion, capsicum and coconut topping.. i tried all their 9 chutneys.. all of them were nice.. i loved spicy tomato chutney and mysore chutney the most..
Pricing is normal.. arnd 500 for 2 people!

My experience of south Indian food had always been very boring and I was never too keen on having it outside.
But then my experience of this place has been phenomenal..with the variety of so many mouthwatering  Chutneys  especially the lauki chutney and the daal chutney are to die for.
The molgapodi Mysore idli just melts in the mouth and its so filling and super amazing.
Loved the cheese dosa. You guys are really generous with the dose of cheese.. Kudos..nice place and super food..

I always found south Indian food very boring, however this place offers a great twist. The chutneys, Ohh my god!! They r to die for, especially the mango chutney. The idli are also good, and they have everything on the menu from the original piccadily square, so that's a bonus. Only one thing, the service needs an improvement. They are kind of rude.

The place is tucked away on the first floor in a colonial era building opposite the Legwndry Great Eastern Hotel from back in the day now The Lalit. 

The place has an easy access to get to. If you're on self drive I would recommend going to this area post office hours as you will find Parking easier. The area is a mad house during the day time. So if you have a driver go anytime. 

The interiors are simple and done in a cafe style. This restaurant also serves pizza and Italian fare. Waffles as well. 

I would want to focus on the South Indian food. Calcutta is known for a few very amazing South Indian joints for all pockets. I would like to say most are simple and yum. But this place is a step up on interiors and staff. The food was delicious. They serve you nine different kinds of chutney and the idea is with your food you pick any three to go with it and they will serve u endless helpings until u can eat no more. If u wish to Taste the other chutneys there is a price to it and I think that's fair. 
We tried a few things about a month ago and they got 80% right. 

I would go back to this place again to eat anytime. 

This is a must try and must visit place. Brilliant food.

This was my 5th visit to the place and possibly the last.  I was in love with the quality of food served here lt last night it was all below average. 
1. Food quality has detiorated heavily.  Pizza was half baked,  idly lost its sponge,  rasam vada was nothing but ordinary and butter milk is no longer worth mentioning. 
2 place is now louder and more chaotic than coffee house.  It's all chaos.  Sitting arrangement has gone worse and it's an embarrassment if you take your guest to the place. 
3 No coordination between the Staffs,  repeatedly kept forgetting the orders.  
4 tough to understand there policy of not reserving a table in advance.  
Feels Sorry bcz earlier there food was really good.

This is a easy to miss restaurant in the heart of Dalhousie that serves the most delicious South Indian food. Their forte lies in giving an interesting twist to the mundane dosa, idli, appam and uttapam that can convert a ho-hum south Indian food eater into a lover of the cuisine. Being first time visitors, we played safe and ordered Masala Dosa. While the dosa was good, what won my heart were the six different types of chutney served with the dosa. This place is a welcome addition to the South Indian food scenario in Kolkata.

Unusual Dosas @ The Chutney Co., Kolkata ‚ò∫

Event: Great Indian Dosa Festival

Duration: 21 Oct - 15 Nov 2017

The Chutney Co. is the relatively new South Indian joint that entered the city food scene around 2.5 years back and living upto it's name, created sufficient ripples by serving 9 different kind of Chutneys as condiments with it's South Indian wares. Since then, the restaurant has moved steadily from strength to strength, simply on the basis of procuring authentic and innovative wares to it's ever growing list of repeat customers.

Last August, they introduced the Great Indian Dosa Festival. Due to public demand, they kickstarted round two of the same festival on 21 Oct 2017 and plan to continue it till 15 Nov 2017.

The seven unusual Dosas that constitute the Great Indian Dosa Festival are - Uppu Huli Dosa, Ragi Dosa, Kanchipuram Dosa, Poondu Dosa, MLA Dosa, Guntur Karam Dosa and Benne Dosa.

We opted to taste -

- Poondu Dosa (Rs. 190/-): Placed on a marquise shaped, thin wooden plate, topped with a circular banana leaf, a half folded semi-crisp circular Dosa was served with a moderate sized bowl of Sambhar.

It was a plain Dosa, with it's inside smeared with a thick coat of chilli-garlic paste.

As per the established protocol, at The Chutney Co., with each order, you are entitled to get 3 different types of Chutneys of your choice. We opted for - Coconut Chutney, Peanut Chutney and Mysore Chutney.

As per expectation, the Dosa was fiery but nice. All the Chutneys were nice as well. The best pairing of the Dosa happened with the Peanut Chutney, as the distinct taste of peanut well complimented the chilli-garlic taste.

The Sambhar was also nice.

- Kanchipuram Dosa (Rs. 170/-): It was served in the similar fashion as Poondu Dosa, but it differed in texture, color and folding pattern. It was a plain Dosa, that was - crisp, folded into a dosa-style triangle and slightly yellow colored and aromatic.

It came accompanied with the customary bowl of Sambhar.

Herein, the Chutneys that we opted for, were - Coconut Chutney, Green Chutney (with mixed coconut) and Tomato Chutney.

All items were nice.

If you have a taste for unusual Dosas, then The Chutney Co. is the place for you to be.

'Mangalorean Monsoon' Tasting @ The Chutney Co., Kolkata, India ‚ò∫

It's really heartening to see the city food scene, constantly buzzing with one or the other food festival, pertaining to the South Indian Cuisine. Finally, the southern food has managed to travel beyond the usual idlis, vadas, dosas, and utthapams. And finally we have accepted that, South Indian food can be served with a Chutney (a staple South Indian condiment), which is not made of coconut, but other palatable and tasty options!

Mangalorean Monsoon is one such food festival, that has been carefully curated keeping in mind the ongoing rainy weather, and the novelty of Mangalorean household cookings. For the local city dwellers, this is kind of a, first time preview of this aforesaid cuisine.

The Mangalorean Monsoon Menu comprises of six well chosen vegetarian items. They are - Rasam Vada, Mangalorean Bun, Jolad Undi, Mosaru Vada, Sponge Dosa With Kurma and Bisibella Bhat.

I tasted the following -

Rasam Vada: A collection of small and dainty ring shaped Vadas arrived, immersed in a big ceramic bowl filled with hot, mildly spicy and tangy Rasam. The Vadas were soft, and the Rasam had a nice tamarind taste. Those who are going through monsoon special throat jams and itchings, would find it blissful.

Mangalorean Bun: Technically, they were not buns, but fried and fluffy puris, wherein banana was one of the main ingredients, and hence they tasted little sweet. Five of them arrived in a cane basket covered with fluorescent green paper. They were served with a small serving of sweet coconut chutney. Following the usual South Indian tradition, we had them with hot Filter Kaapi (coffee), and thus ordered them at the end of the meal.

For some strange reason, the mere sight of these buns spelled warmth and cozy comfort. They tasted really nice (read soul food), both with chutney, as well as, coffee.

Jolad Undi: They were five servings of steamed corn and coconut dumplings, which had a thin and shiny outer coat of cornflour batter. These dumplings were served with a spicy garlic chutney. Keeping the ongoing fasting season in mind, the restaurant also keeps at hand, an alternate curry patta chutney (no onion or garlic). The dumplings were light, and a novel item. Both chutneys were presented for tasting. They tasted quite distinct and nice.

Mosaru Vada: It was basically the South Indian style Dahi Vada, with two additions. Firstly, it was topped with toasted coconut flakes. Secondly, the curd had relatively greater proportion of red chilli powder.

This item has been kept in the menu, not with the perspective of an introductory new taste, but to cater to the urge of mildly sweet, thick and cool curd, which is felt by many diners.

Sponge Dosa With Kurma: It consisted of two light, fluffy and steamed dosas, made purely of rice batter. It is normally served with a small bowl of vegetable kurma, which comes in two options - coconut gravy and spicy tomato gravy. The diners are required to choose from one of the aforesaid options. For the tasting purpose, both the options were presented. The Sponge Dosa tasted good with both the Kurmas, but it harmonized better with the one with the coconut gravy.

Bisibella Bhat is basically a kind of Khichdi, infused with vegetables, spices and jaggery, and quite a full meal in itself. I did not taste it.

All in all, the tasting session was novel and fantastic. Presentation was mostly in big ceramic bowls, small glass bowls, boat shaped melamine plates, and quadrant and boat shaped flat wooden trays.

This food festival is a clear shout out for simple and good food, made with good r&d and passion for authentic food, and served with good hospitality.

Food Festival's Date & Time: 1 Aug - 31 Aug 2016, 1 pm - 9 pm

With deep rooted connections in Chennai i missed good South Indian meals in the city. The Chutney Co. is the closest i can get to that.. With their whole varieties of chutneys being the showstopper, pretty much all of the food is great. I specially love the mysore molgapuri idli and rava dosa. The upma is amazing as well. And don't forget to end your meal with their unique and amazing pink guava with red chilli ice lolly!!

The Chutney Co. is located in Dalhousie opposite to Lalit, Great Eastern Hotel on the first floor of Great Eastern Electronics Shop. We went there on a Sunday evening and the place was crowded. We were seated after waiting for 20 mins. The seating area is not very big and is common to both Piccadilly Square and Chutney Co. And good thing is you get the option of Italian, French Crepes, Waffles and all bakery stuff as well. Interiors and ambience are very ordinary. We ordered Dosa, rasam vada, pasta, uttappam and some beverages. This place serves amazing  South Indian super crispy dosa, perfectly cooked uttappam with great variety of chutneys. Rasam vada was awesome and probably with best rasam i have had in town. Pasta was quite good as well. Service is quick and portions are good. Not very pricey.

I was very disappointed when Piccadilly Square left Alipore. It was a place where I used to have comfort food. Today I had the chance to visit it upstairs, added to it was Chutney Co.
Beautifully decorated place, just like Piccadilly Square of Alipore. I was disappointed that none of the staffs of Alipore branch were there, but no matter, the present staff were also well behaved and attentive.
The menu of Piccadilly Square had nothing new to offer to me. I had exhausted almost all its offerings. So I turned my attention to Chutney menu. It comprises of South Indian food. I chose sada dosa accompanied by three chutneys of my choice - Mysore, green mango and spicy coconut.
The food appeared within five minutes. The dosa was crisp as expected. The sambar was very tasty. Spicy coconut chutney disappointed me. It was just like ordinary coconut chutney nothing spicy in it. But I relished Mysore chutney and green mango chutney. They are heaven. Would like to try other chutneys later.

Soft, fluffy, that beautiful taste of roastes ghee with a generous helping of gun powder over it. Now, I consider myself an Uthappam connoisseur. Like it a lot and have tried it a lot of places. The Uthappam was a tad too oily, but it still was quite delicious. The best part of the meal, as the name of the restaurant would suggest, are the chutneys. You get to choose 3 out of about 7-8 different chutneys. I picked the tried and tested coconut chutney, Mysore chutney and peanut chutney. All three floored me! And the Sambar, which is so difficult to get just right, was divine. That's pretty much all I can say. Go nuts!

A perfect South Indian joint and a perfect family place. Service is great! They share the outlet with Piccadilly. So incase there is wide variety of choice available. As the name goes, their chutneys are what they are famous for. I personally enjoyed the pizza uttapam and the filter coffee the most.

Visited this place on a Monday night,along with my uncle,aunt and cousins. We ordered 2 varieties of  Mysore Dosa, Cheese Masala Dosa,Ghee Idli and Sambhar Vada. The quantity looked more than enough for us. And it was with the quality too. They served four types of different chutneys which were too good to eat with. Then we had ordered Pizza Uttapam and believe me,kids will surely love that. But the only thing that disappointed me was the service. The waiters looked in a hurry,it might be due to the crowd. They looked to clear the table as soon as possible. Finally we ordered some blue berry cake, which acted as an icing on the cake. Thank you chutney for a good experience. Would recommend people to visit this place. 
Chutney management - Please suggest your waiters to respect the customers and give them a proper service,with a smile.

They serve around 3-4 extra chutney with the usual ones! Their onion and garlic chutney will definitely drive yu crazy if yu love to eat!
Service - quick

The food is delicious. All the chutneys are amazing and the mallipudi idly and dosas are to die for. 

However, it is slightly on the expensive side and the co-location with Piccadilly square takes away from ambience. That keeps this place from getting 5

I can have south Indian food any time and all the time. So why not try The Chutney Co. Easy to locate  -infront of The Lalit.  Loved the ambience. They serve 3 different kind of Chutney with each dish and they have ha e as many as 9 variety of Chutney and hence the name. We tried Dhania Dosa, Idli , vada and each one of them were at its best. The best dish that we had here was pizza uttapam - awesome combination . The best part is that they share their space with Piccadilly Square so you don't have to restrict yourself to south Indian in case you want to really explore.

Date of Visit : 03/05/2016

Location : Opposite to Lalit Great Eastern Hotel, above great Eastern store.

 Decor : A very good decor of the restaurants compared to other south indian restaurants in the city. Love the ambience. 

Service : Service is prompt.

Food ordered & Description :
It was a sudden plan to visit this place with two foodie friends of mine. Though esplanade Dalhousie area has many south indian restuarant and most of them are reasonably priced, this restuarant is located at the heart of office areas with pricing being reasonably high than others in this area. The ambience make you fall in love with it. But it's usp is their chutneys. they provide 9 varieties of Chutney and all tastes good. they provide three chutneys with each dish. so if u order three dish u can taste all chutneys. They also serve few continental and Italian dishes through their venture Piccadilly Square. Coming to food...
Mysore idli - Big idli, very soft. Amazing taste.
Malgapodi Dosa - Dosa with malgapodi powder. The Dosa was crispy. Taste wise it's good.
Pizza Uttapam - Uttapam made in pizza style with tomato, capsicums, onions and cheese as toppings. Loved it as it was very different.
Malgapodi Idli - Soft and tasty.
Mixed Sauce Pasta with veggies - Amazing taste. A must try for pasta lovers.
Blueberry Lemonade - the drink was refreshing. Perfectly cold and adequate sugar. Recommended drink.

Overall amazing place. Though little over priced but a must place to try for south indian cuisine lovers and pasta lovers. Go for it.

So today I went to my favorite adda place with my best friend. South Indian is one such cuisine which can be eaten all day everyday! üòù
So today we ordered ‚ùá Dhania Dosa and Masala Vada. Dhania dosa is one of our favorite it never disappoints us and the masala vada was also yum! Crispy and soft from inside. With each order, we get to chose three chuney's from a list of options. And we decided to go for some unusual ones with the dhania dosa -
‚ùá Mysore chutney- I didn't expect it to have a sweet taste! Which was a good balance with other two spicy ones .
‚ùá Spicy Tomato Chutney- This one was really tasty, but wasn't thaaaat spicy! .
‚ùá Garlic chutney- This was the BESTTT. And sooo spicy! Must order! It went so well with dosa and hot sambhar.
I have also had Paper Plain dosa long back.....and it is a must order. The crispness is so amazing!
I love the quality of food, the service and its even reasonable!
I even had Rasam Vada from there new menu. And its the best ive had. Rasam is a thin lentil south indian soup perked up with freshly roasted spices, tamarind pulp and tomatoes and served with soft mini vadas . üòç The soup had a very unique and distinct taste to it because of the special seasoning and ingredients they use to make it. And the coriander leaves topping took the dish to a whole other level . üíú

I was dreading the idea of going to a popular restaurant on Sunday, especially after hearing that the service tends to get bad when it‚Äôs busy. We reached around 12:30 and the restaurant was seventy percent full. 

The staff managed to join empty tables and helped the 17 of us sit in two different sets.¬†The service was quick and efficient, even in a busy restaurant. I am very impressed.¬†

¬†
Dishes that we ordered are ‚Äì¬†

¬†Mysore Idli with Molaga Podi on the side - Yummy! Idli was nice and soft and Podi was yummy ‚ò∫¬†
¬†
¬†Mysore Dosa ‚Äì Good!

Enjoyed the variety of chutneys served with the South Indian dishes.¬†
¬†
¬†Lemon Sevai ‚Äì Didn‚Äôt like. The Sevai is too fine for my liking.¬†
¬†
¬†Tomato Sevai ‚Äì Sad! The taste was very flat.
¬†
¬†Mushroom and Cheese Grilled Panini Sandwich ‚Äì Delicious. Like the name says cheesy and mushroomy.
¬†
¬†Blueberry Pancake ‚Äì Tasted a bit bitter. Have enjoyed the dish before in the Elgin Rd. outlet.¬†
¬†
¬†Season special, Mango pieces on Waffle with whipped cream and chocolate sauce ‚Äì Wow! The chocolate sauce made it super yummy.¬†
¬†
¬†Summer Blush ‚Äì Great, as always! One of my all-time favourites.

¬†
¬†Good job, Pooja and team! Had a wonderful dining experience.  Would love to go back soon ‚ò∫

A delightful place in one of the most bureaucratic areas in Kolkata. The decor is pretty neat and there are some really good items one can try especially The Popeye's Pick and the Mad About Mushrooms. South Indian Dishes are very tasty! Their USP has to be the various kinds of Chutneys they provide with the Dosa and Idli, hence the name The Chutney Co. Worth a try!

This restaurant is clubbed together with Piccadilly Square. I was a little hesitant initially because I felt the menu was restricted to very few items but the food was top notch. Even after such a rush, the quality of the food was so gratifying. Waiters were really helpful with the selections and right under our nose.

The USP of the pace is the varieties of chutney served - starting from coriander, coconut, bottle gourd, garlic, onion, tomato, peanut, Mysore chutney.

We ordered

1. Uttapam - It was well prepared. SƒÅmbhar, coriander, coconut and the tomato Chutney was amazing.

2. Ordered Plain Idlis which were soft and fresh

3. Fruit juice

Kolkata is a paradise for food lovers, be it for any cuisine or simply every cuisine but there aren't many quality restaurants for South Indian food.
This place, although, is definitely one of the best in the city.
Perfectly located. I say that because it is situated in the commercial hub of the city.
The interior of the place is well done. It is very different from what you would see in any other South Indian Restaurant in town.
The staff is very cordial and attentive, right from the time you enter the restaurant.
Service was quick.

Food :
I ordered for a Mysore Idly, a Mysore Dosa and a Rava Plain Dosa.
Mysore Idly, simply, melted in the mouth even before I could take a bite. But, I did not understand what made that Idly Mysore! 
Next comes the Mysore Dosa..looked normal which made me sink for a while but as I started eating it, with every bite the amount of happiness increased. The filling or the masala in the Dosa was exquisite. One of the bests I've ever had.
Rava Dosa was as it normally is. It was well prepared.
Sambhar and the Red Garlic Chutney was amazing. Rest other two chutney were just fine. They did not excite my taste buds.

A drawback that I found was the way they served the food. 
The transition from Idly to Dosa was chaotic. They took the plate but let the chutneys be. And added the same chutneys, that came with the Dosas, to the table haphazardly.
Also, when they served the Idly, they did not place the chutneys well. They must form a way of presenting it on the table.
That's my feedback for them.

Now, to what Zomato has mentioned..It says 400 for 2, but I paid ‚Çπ547/- for 2. This is one very rare a time when this information on Zomato turned out to be incorrect.

A MUST visit for quality South Indian food!

 I along with my family reached the restaurant by 8:00pm and there was a long queue of families before us... the signee assured us that we would get our table in 40-60mins, at 9:30 we were called it.. 
The first impression of the restaurant (which is combined with #PiccadillySquare) has a very soothing modern look with a great infrastructure and a window to oversee the kitchen.
We ordered combinations of Dosa, Idli, Pancakes, etc and ended with Shakes and Mocktails. The difference of order and delivery time was less than 7 mins and with the really fast service and the spectacularly positive attitude of the servers we got through our dinner.
The food was really delicious, the crisp, the softness, the taste was bang-on and the variety of "Chutney" provided by them is really good. 
"I would suggest that when you visit do try all the varieties of Chutney provided by them".

At this rate chutney might just become one of the most favourable South Indian Cuisine'd restaurant in Kolkata. 
Great Job Guys Keep It Up!!

Went here for lunch craving for a new place to go to and preferably South India. Reaching the place is easy with a convenient on road location just opposite Lalit Hotel. However note that parking is difficult to get here. Ordered a Mysore and Dhania Dosa which turned out to be very good. After that felt like ordering something new so tried the Pizza Uttapam which turned out to be a not very appetizing fusion food haha. Also learnt after ordering Rosti round that this item is different from a Rosti and is like hash browns. Overall a casual nice place with a good ambience for anytime eating.

They also have Piccadilly square in the same premises so the options are not just restricted to South Indian food but you also have pastas and pizzas, waffles to gorge on. 
It is little on the expensive side but you don't really mind it. Just that the fresh lime soda etc. are priced double the rate.. 120 + taxes comes to 150 for a fresh lime is exorbitant.
Apart from that, it is worth a 5 star rating

Been here with my wife for a working lunch. Had ordered a Masala dosa and Tomato Sevai along with Mysore, Sweet tomato and Green Chutneys. The food quality was good and the Chutneys were fresh and good to eat. 

The prices were reasonable and the staff was courteous. Would like to be here again for another round to try out other South Indian delights

Il locale al primo piano di un edificio in zona Dalhousie si presenta semplice e molto pulito. All'entrata c'√® un grande banco di pasticceria e di succhi di frutta . Ma la cosa che colpisce di pi√π √® la visibilit√† della cucina attraverso una grande parete con cristallo . Questa √® la migliore garanzia sul lavoro dei cuochi che sono davanti a tutti in prima linea . Ed √® veramente piacevole vedere tutto lo staff della cucina mentre prepara dosa o uttapam o semplicemente pizza. I camerieri sono attenti , veloci e si prestano a dare ampie spiegazioni sui vari piatti . Abbiamo ordinato un mixed uttapam e un  onion rava dosa. Eccellenti entrambi!! Il prezzo veramente basso .

Location wise the place is very easily locatable.We had filter coffee and pizza uttapam.The filter coffee was good but can be improved.The pizza uttapam was served with sweet tomato onion chutney,Mysore chutney and peanut butter chutney.This was something worth having a new dish and so tasty.it tasted far more good than what we had expected.one drawback is its limited menu which needs to be improved quite a bit.otherwise interiors,staff service,ambience,taste and quality of food all were up to the mark.

Open kitchen, good decor, good food - The Chutney Co. gives all of that. That too in near the High Court area, where it's pretty tough to find a decent eatery with ample seating arrangement. The uttapam was pretty good, but for a place which takes pride in it's chutneys, the chutneys could have been better. Will definitely visit this place again.

Somewhat bizarrely sharing space with Piccadilly Circus of the waffles and pancakes fame, the Chutney Co. is actually a great place for dosas. The nine kinds of chutney they serve are all worth trying‚Äîmy favourites were the peanut, coriander and Mysore chutneys. They also do make a passable cup of filter coffee.

Coming to the food..
Its specifically known for its wide variety of chutneys starting from coriander,coconut,bottle gourd,garlic,onion,tomato,peanut,mysore .. Couldn't really get along well with all the tastes but I really liked the spicey tangy chutney and the bottle gourd one... Was amazed that even bottle gourd could taste so different...
We tried Rava Masala Dosai,Masala Dosai,Molgapodi Dosai and all of them were decent enough.
Ordered Plain Idlis which were so soft and fresh and I was totally contented with it.
Upma was even good but I didn't like it much because it was prepared using ghee..
Thin crust Pizza was a hit on their menu...
Then at the end I tried Tomato Sevai when my belly was almost full, still I loved it and I would love visiting it again for such fine South Indian Food...!

Located in the center of commercial area, its the best to have lunch with your friends. 4 stars is all beacause of nine different flavours of chutney. The chutneys are amazing with sweet and tangy taste.

I had great expectations from this place, because I absolutely love Picadilly Square and thought that Chutney Co would be as good. The staff was all over the place and not at all cordial. Even though the food was very good, the staff and the ambience were a big turn off.

Truly the best South Indian food I have ever had...the ambience is cozy,service is quick..they share their place with piccadily square ..which gives you some options of western food too..loved their chutneys..the idlis were very soft..rava onion dosa with extra cheese was crispy and tasted too good..getting parking space is quite a challenge during business hours...

Went on a Saturday and had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table. The waiting area is small and cramped. There is bank near the waiting area which (thankfully) was closed on the Saturday.¬†

First impressions: The decor was plain average. Some of the furniture needs replacement, its squeaky. The chairs need to be more comfortable. The idea of keeping spoons in a rack on the table is good but it takes up a considerable table space. Plain ambiance and it needs improvement.

The Mysore idly was very soft and tasty. The concept of offering many types of chutneys was a novel one. But some of the waiters could not make out the names of the chutneys.

The sambhar seemed to have ZERO dal. It was more like besan curry with a tamarind flavor and a few pieces of onion and drumsticks put in. South Indian sambhar should have toor dal visible. So a definite improvement needed here.

The chutneys were nice, some of them were spicy.

The dosa masala was well done.¬†

Why is the menu of chutney company so small and unimpressive when you have a hard bound solid menu for the Piccadilly square. Something to think about because South Indian food is no less in taste and options than the global experience of the Piccadilly Square.

Washroom had no Kimberly Clark hand towels. Not acceptable when you pay move than Rs. 200/- for one piece of a Mysore Idly. Please improve here.
¬†
Overall a nice place, some shortcomings, but hopefully the management receives the feedback proactively and improves.

Very Good Chutneys.
I had been hearing good things about this relatively new South Indian joint, so decided to go there, even though it was a very short trip to Kolkata.
Just opposite The Great Eastern Hotel, the Ambience is okayish, 
Its not a very big place either.
The staff is very friendly.
We ordered for Mysore Idly, which melted on the mouth.
Dhaniya dosa was average.
Dosas- onion Saada, masal were very good, crisp
They give 3 different varieties of Chutneys with each, most of the Chutneys were very good.


Definetely a place to frequently visit for South Indian food

A very good addition to the city . Location is good,easily accessible. The interiors are simple and sober, gives a relaxed feeling. Ample Staffs as well as cordial ones. 

About the food:
PLUSES: 9 Kinds of chutneys steals the show. And all of them are worth having. 
Mysore idli is something great, melts as soon as it goes in the mouth...
Rawa dosa was the best I ever had... Proper preparation.

MINUSES: Pizza uttapam is not worth having. Its basically a uttapam with cheese. Nothing great..
Do not order Cheese paper masala dosa , as cheese doesn't let it be paperish...rather go for cheese dosa..its all the same.

Advise: add a lil more items and variety to the menu. Maybe a FRIED IDLI PREPARATION or more kinds of dosas.  
Happy Eating guys.üòÑ


And yes, we had FILTER KAAPI, Typical tumbler serving is an add on. Can go for it..

Want to have a delicious South Indian cuisine?! Visit "The chutney co."
Food was very good and delicious.
The different types of chutneys were bonus with every item!
Pizza Uttapam was the best dish we had... this dish is their signature item... so must try... Mysore chatni was the best among all chatnis...
Ghee masala dhosha was also awesome! You can feel ghee ,butter or cheese really in your mouth...
We also had South Indian Filter Coffee and banana shake in drinks...
Ambience was also good! South Indian pictures and handworks were hanging from the walls and ceiling...
Also in one side picadilly's square was there with lots of cakes , snacks snd mocktails...
Only problem was to find the restaurant as it is on the first floor! So we were little bit confused about the entrance...
But believe me If you want to have really lip smacking south indian , The Chutney Co. is the best choice...
# One of the best south Indian restaurant in town

I went there on a Sunday evening and there was great rush.Was pleasantly surprised at the quick service.Everyone who goes should surely try masala vada which was the favourite dish of my meal.The different types of chutney's were very innovative specially the mysore and garlic chutney.The only downside was that seeing the size of the dosa I found the prices on a bit higher side.As A southindian lover I would anyday prefer Anand over this but Chutney's was a different experience and should be tried by everyone atleast once.

Pros:
Neatly made place. Has gud variety of food to offer.

Rava dosas, Buttermilk and their waffles.


Cons:
Extremely noisy place and as if the chatters of each table were not enough they also had sad music playing.

Very slow service and the staff even forgot orders. Honestly that was irritating to know that the dosa we were awaiting was an order which was forgotten altogether.

Quantity in everything is more like serves upto 1 or less.

Great amount of variety on platter but the taste and feel of everything was average and the special chutneys which happens to b their usp wasn't something to drool over.

All in all the visit wasn't a very satisfactory one, can definitely think of visiting again but to see some changes in service, noise reduction, quantity and quality.

We ordered:
~ Mysore idli - simple light food... Good to eat
~ Masala vada - nothing great about it.. Simple home types dal vada with Onion.
~ Mysore Dosa - vry good taste with Masala on Dosa.. Tasted amazing
~ Onion Rava Dosa - crispy & spicy.. Tasted good
~ Paper plain Onion Dosa - crispy to eat..
There were different varities of Chatney...  All of them tasted good.. The best was Mysore, Dhania, n Papita...

Service a bit slow.. Need to improve a bit.. 
Staff were vry polite n humble... 
Would definitely like to visit this place again...

The chutney co was on my checklist n made sure that whenever I got the opportunity to visit this place I would surely visit it without giving it a sexond thought, when I entered this place it seemed to be an oasis for me in such a hustle bustle and the decor was nicely done with comfortable sitting and a rich aroma of the south indian cuisine with an open kitchen, the thing I really didn't like was the service boys gathering infront of the cash counter n were talking to each other n continously watching you eat which was abit awkward. Now lets talk food: pizza uttapam is a must try with almost giving a touch of a thin crust pizza served with three different yummy chutneys, ghee idly just melts in your mouth and special mention to the crisp piping hot medu vada but let me be frank the main catch is the different varities of chutneys like mysore, tomato, coconut garlic n more which is enough a reason to try this place as we are already done with same old stereo type southies

After reading so many great reviews about this place, we thought to give it a try, and it was more than worth it. Actually, my fav south Indian restaurant till today was Banana Leaf, but after trying out here, THE CHUTNEY CO. is the best. The dosa was just fabulous with 3 chutney of your choice. They provide diff types of tangy chutneys, its really unique. We ordered paper plain dosa, it was really tasty and crispy. The dosa was never ending one. The only minus point is the sambhar, it was good but it was bit sweet. The decor is impressive, the ambience is a bit noisy bcz its a total family restaurant that's why. It was our first visit here and we are more than happy.

Went there after really strong recommendations. The best part is, I was not disappointed even a tad bit. Certainly one of the finest south Indian food I've had in Kolkata in a very long time. The highlight of the meal was the spread of chutneys they offer with the dishes. The best being the Mysore chutney and the spicy coconut chutney. We ordered for ghee idli. So tender that it melts in your mouth before you even realize. The ghee and molgapudi on top of it took the dish to the next level. Our next order was a pizza uttapam. The uttapam was very average, but the delectable chutneys saved the game here. 
Ghee masala dosa is extremely recommended. It was awesome. The flavor of ghee kind of blasts in your mouth the moment you take a bite. All in all, a wonderful south Indian food experience. A must go. A little harsh on the pocket, but its OK if you get this quality of food!
Highly recommended!
P.s: this review is unbiassed and based on my dining experience!

I cannot imagine having a worse experience in a resteraunt. Our server was way too rude, tossing the food on the table, Sambar and Chutney coming 10 minutes after the cold Dosa which itself took 45 minutes to come. The cutest part? They didnt provide us with spoons with our idlis and vadas and on asking for one the waiter gave a bad look and tossed it on my plate. Deserts came before the pizza which well we had to cancel cause everyone had already lost there appetite after the way we were treated. Getting a 1/5 only because i have to publish this review, doesnt even deserve it. I honestly dont even blame the staff, I had been warned by a friend beforehand about the arrogance of the staff and I chose to ignore it.

So after hearing great reviews for the place, on a busy Dusherra afternoon, we decide to drop into The Chutney Co for a sumptuous lunch with a group of 18 people. The management was great to accommodate us together by arranging the tables and the staff was out rightly one of the best I have seen in any Kolkata restaurant - Polite , Patient (when the restaurant is choked), Courteous and Accommodating. The service was very quick.
The South Indian food was one of the , sorry , THE BEST I have ever had in Kolkata- ¬†after having tried out the vets of South Indian Dining in the city for decades. ¬†Everything was just perfect - The dishes as well as the accompaniments. Chutneys , Sambar, Mysore Idli (What was that ! :D ) , Dosa, Coffee, everything.¬†
Additional Bonus : They even have a ice-cream corner serving up one of the best ice-creams around the city.¬†
¬†One area where I see a tiny scope of improvement is bringing in more South Indian dishes .¬†
Must try :D

All came with special 3 chutneys like sweet onion, spicy tomato, green coconut, mysore chutney, peanut chutney etc etc. Chutney ws really innovative n tasty with regular south indian food. Sambhar served with all dishes ws great too. Medu vada was amazingly crisy fried n served hot. Pricing is lil on high side bt its good 4 that ambience in this dalhousie area

This was truly a unique experience for me and I would never like to have the same in my life. We first waited for an hour and 15 minutes 'outside' the restaurant to get a table. The ambience was below average. The service was pathetic with waiters tossing food on the table and courtsey out of their speech. Besides, we were receiving dishes which other guests had ordered in place of our order. It was just as if they were paying us to eat over there. The dosas were all too salty and other dishes were so ordinary that you can get better in a roadside south indian eatery with the service being as slow as a snail. The virgin mojito was tasting like Limca and they were just throwing bowls after bowls of chutney on the table even after noticing that we didn't need anymore as if trying to give the name of their restaurant some weight. This South Indian restaurant was a huge disregard to the cuisine itself. Wish I had got stuck in jam instead of even reaching that place.

While some feel it's a bit of a drive and effort to head to The Chutney Company situated in Dalhousie, I as an absolute self proclaimed foodie ensure and vouch that the experience will be fulfilling. 
From the mega size soft idli's, served piping hot with an array of flavoursome and rare chutneys that take your palate on a delectable journey to the Rava Dosa which was one the best things I ate. My favourite has to be the molgapodi idli which I finished within seconds of it being served with a smile.
While everyone's attention has been on the varied spread of chutneys served at TCC, the delicious sambar absolutely completes the South Indian meal for me and I saw myself finishing many a helpings. 
Also a step away from the cliched South Indian restaurant environment and ambiance, TCC offers a NOW take on comfort and setting. 
Thumbs up to the team, till we meet again!

I went there for lunch today. Found the ambience and the staff pleasant. Coming to the food, we ordered:
The masala vada, which was very nice. 
The magadolpoli idli ( sorry about the spelling) was nice and fluffy. 
The masala dosa was soft and the size was good.
Loved the coconut sevai. Never had a sevai before and delighted by the flavours.
We tasted all the chutneys and all were nice. Special mention to the peanut chutney and sweet onion tomato sauce.
Will advise to order plain dosas and other dishes which are not flavoursome in themselves so that you get to enjoy the flavours of the chutneys.

The food here is great! Service was good too. 
Everything that we ordered was delicious, from the idli to the burgers and dosa to dessert. This combination of Piccadilly Square and The Chutney Co is a perfect recipe for a great evening out.

You gonna love this place. Was shopping at Great Eastern Appliances and coincidently saw The Chutney Co. on Zomato. It was showing the same address and there is a lift inside the store to reaxh the restaurant (yeh inside the appliances store, probably have same promoter). Once you there you dont feel like you are sitting in Dalhausie. The place is small but tables are nicely arranged and you feel like sitting and chatting for hours. Its a mix of two eateries, the other one is Piccadilly square, European style food (which I couldn't try). I had south indian food. You will be served 3 types of chutneys with each dish. I tried two dishes so had 6 types of chutneys. Trust me you will be served the best tasting south indian food available in Kolkata. The chutneys are the highlight of the place. A must try for all who likes south indian food. Its just that pricing is on the higher side but who cares when large corporates and banks are dotting the area:)

We reached the place at 7:15 sharp and there was already a waiting, being a Sunday. After waiting for around half an hour, we got a table. I've not seen a live south Indian kitchen yet in Kolkata. The ambience was nice. The staff was courteous. 
Coming to the food. We tried the mogapuram idli, masala vada, masala dosa, paper masala dosa, cheese dosa, rava onion dosa. Everything was good. We also had pizza uttapam, which was okay, but I guess no real point ordering that, the other uttapams would taste better.
Coming to the chutney. They serve nine chutneys. I have some suggestions and request. I would want the chutneys to have a more distinctive taste, which I felt was not there. I mean the flavors could be a little stronger. The spicy chutney can be more spicy.
Overall it's a nice place. A little heavy in the pocket though.

Visited it today with family. It is on the first floor of Great Eastern, right opposite Lalit Hotel.
On the recommendations of several people and after reading the zomato reviews, we decided to try this place. To our delight this place offers a south Indian menu as well as the menu of Piccadilly Square. It is called the Chutney Co. because it offers nine varieties of Chutneys and with each dish, one could select three. The Piccadilly menu consists of a wide variety of pastas, pizzas, crepes, pancakes, waffles, gelato, etc. We went there on a Sunday at around 7:15 and had to wait for nearly 40 minutes, so one can imagine the rush.
However upon seating the service was found to be very quick. We received our food within 5-10 minutes of ordering. The staff was also very co-operative and courteous. The owner was also present there and was helping the staff in handling the rush.
Coming to the food, the chutneys offered were good but they lacked a distinct flavour and failed to impress us much. Out of the nine, we really liked the coconut chutney (normal and spicy), the coriander chutney and the tomato chutney. The masala vada is a must try. It was like kalmi vada and was very crispy and delicious. The Molagapodi Idlis were soft and good. The Pizza Uttapam was like a vegetable pizza and was decent enough. The dosas ordered were good but there was nothing special about them. The size of the dosas were a bit small. We also ordered mushroom crepes which was very creamy and any mushroom lover would love it. We also ordered the Dublin Mudslide Waffles which was waffles with chocolate gelato and chocolate sauce. Though it tasted good, it could have been better, but then again anything with ice cream and chocolate sauce is bound to taste good.
Overall this is a quite a good place with good ambience and service and Is definitely worth trying.

When I entered this first floor restaurant opposite the lalit great eastern hotel, it felt like an oasis in the middle of the business hub of Kolkata. There is no other place in my knowledge in BBD Bag where you can go not to just have your lunch but to relax and take a break from your work.

The The Chutney Co. offers you the luxury to find yourself in the comfort of an amazingly decorated restaurant and eat lovely South Indian food. The dosa with varieties of chutneys and the long-cherished filtered coffee had a mesmerising effect on me. The coffee was good though the purists may argue but the average Indian coffee lovers should not complain. The dosa was even better with those unique chutneys.

Besides food, one has to acknowledge the simple yet stylish sitting arrangements and the stunning view of the road outside and yes, I fell in love with this place.

The chutney Co. Lived up to its name when it offered nine varieties of chutney for you to choose from. 
The ambience of a quiet caf√© teamed with Picadilly square menu, tucked away in Dalhousie, it provides for a sumptuous meal. 
The best part is that you can end your meal with a traditional South Indian filter coffee.

The food tastes very nice. The assortment if chutneys are very much relishing. But the sambar is the best. Authentic karnataka type sambar in kolkata. The servings are also very generous. However, a little expensive place so cannot be visited regularly.

The concept of mixing two restaraunts is an ingenious one. South Indian and continental. South Indian was nice with an array of chutneys. With each dish u get 3 chutneys but the extremely courteous and smiling staff (despite the pressure of Sunday diners) were more than glad to serve you any chutney u wanna try. south Indian was good and so was the pizza we ordered. Recommended not to go on a Sunday as average waiting time goes up to 1.5 hrs. overall a good experience..

In a place like calcutta which is known for its amazing south Indian food this place has managed to make its space. Lotts of interesting things and the comfort of ordering a pizza when your parents feel like an idli and you don't. The downside is that they don't give sambar as happily as they do the bill. but I guess with enough people pestering them they may begin to. A good place to go to with family. And the fact that it's completely veg just adds to the ambience the comfortable homely feel.

My first impression with the person responsible for seating wasn't good as he seemed disinterested. The Mysore Idly is definately worth a try, its big and soft. The mysore dosa and anglo olio pasta were both good. The waiter gave chutney as per their own discretion. I think when we order 3 to 4 dished they weren't able to track what chutney was ordered with which dish. They forgot to serve our two rava dosas even though we were a group of only 5. The ambience of the restaurant is nice.
Now heres what I found shocking. I wanted to pack one mixed uttapam for my dad. The waiter said they don't have parcels on weekends. However I could see through the glass window of the kitchen that they were packing 10 to 15 parcels in plastic packets. Upon enquiring with the waiter he said that those parcels were for the traffic police sergents of that area. However i wasn't given my one parcel. Shame on the traffic police and shame on the restaurant management

Its a cosy and neat food joint in dalhousie area. Its ideal for people wanting to catch up with friends and peers. 

FOOD: I had high hopes but was let down. Dont fall for the number of chutneys offered with the idly/ dosas as most of them are no good. Guess its just a fancy decoration. The food does not come near the taste of popular south indian eateries like Anand, Raj, Banana Leaf, Idly Express, etc.  Only thing here is 'Fancy'. and NOT AUTHENTIC SOUTH INDIAN. 

PARKING: car parking is very difficult here, hope they offers valet services . 

PRICES: are around 20% - 35 % higher compared to the median of similar outlets.

The preparation was really nice with mouth watering chutneys. They offer you any 3 kind of chutneys you want with a dish and we had ordered 5 dishes so we got to taste all the thirteen chutneys they had and except the peanut chutney all the rest were just amazing. The mysore idli deserves a special mention. Really satisfied.

Location: Right opposite great Eastern hotel, on the main road, above Great Eastern electronics.

All of the above dishes were "Super se Upar" . And must mention: amazing service and really really well trained and diligent staff. Keep it up . much love üòâ

Chutney n co is a concept pulled from the famous "Chutneys" chain of restaurants in Hyderabad. The attempt to put two restaurants in one is not as bad since you can go and have best of both worlds at one spot. But the place is pretty small for it to serve two restaurant clientele so becomes overly clumsy and waiting time can reach to even an hour.

Inspite of the lil flaws the place has impeccable food. Specifically focusing on Chutney n co. the idlis are soft and moist specially one muglai podi idli and a family idli are a must try. The dosas are nice and soft too. Sambhar is not too sour, so tastes perfect.

Now coming down to the hype over the 10+ chutneys they offer. They are mainly made of coconut with flavours, dals and one is of mango. Out of all you will probably end up liking 1/2..but for starters try them all. Presentation is decent.

Ambience-3/5

This place may look fancy with their pretty interiors, dosa presentation,  hair nets etc, but, what they actually need is new staff, and servers with a better attitude. 

We were at Chutney's on a weekday,  it was understaffed as well as disorganised /mismanaged. People waiting for a table were hovering around - they don't have a proper waiting area, or a host.

 Service was slow, sambhar arrived cold and only after specifically asking for the condiments. As for chutneys, the server just dumped a lot of bowls on our table, was clueless about which ones he served. On asking them about the pending order (after waiting 30 mins)   complaining about the cold sambhar, the server was very rude - not only was he unapologetic but also had the audacity to dump food on our table, whilst asking my father to check whether it was hot enough.. The server also threw spoons on our table at some point.. Should have walked out of the restaurant at this point. The staff have no manners or sense. 

In short,  never in my life have I had such a humiliating dining experience. The food comes no where close to making up for this. Would not return or recommend.

My cook did not turn up today and wanted to collect dinner for my aged dad and me. Called The Chutney Co. and asked whether parcel service was available or not. Was told yes. Reach at 9.15. Am told to wait for 45 minutes for a parcel for two (by the way, they close at 10). I ask why it should take so long. They say we will serve the seated guests first and then your parcel will be readied. Why?? Were they going to serve me leftovers? Or was I paying less than the seated guests? Returned very disappointed.  Did not expect such an unprofessional attitude.

TCC - You have outdone yourselves.Please keep this up and you will have a booming crowd in no time!!

If you like to have great South Indian Cuisine The Chutney Co. is the place for you.

In just my first visit to this place I have fallen in love with it.
The ambiance is excellent with beautiful and soothing wall decorations,It has a better table arrangement than most restaurants and the staff is extremely courteous and efficient.

They have lived up to the expectations in relation to their name as they offer 9 different types of¬† chutneys with anything that you order and absolutely free of cost too.

I ordered the Rawa Onion Masala Dosa,It was great to taste,extremely crunchy and the masala was just the right amount of awesome and tasteful.

They offered 4 types of chutney(Tomato,Dal,Coconut and coriander) and each was beautiful to taste.

The sambhar was delicious and superbly prepared.
I gave my compliments to the chef .

The next thing I ordered was a plate of waffles with honey and butter with whipped cream at the side.

Oh my my!! It was really great and I would not be exaggerating if I say it was the best I ever had. 

I can honestly say this was the best south indian food i have had in kolkata.

So all you South Indian food lovers,please go and give it a try.You will not regret it.

BTW ,it is located just opposite The Lalit Great Eastern Hotel on top of the Great Eastern Electronic store.

Pros :
-Decent interiors with light music
-Serves full menu of Piccadilly Square (though not updated in Zomato)
-None of the dishes will disappoint, my fav was Popeye's Pick
-quantity and pricing were reasonable for whatever we ordered

Cons:
-No separate washroom, will have to use Great Eastern's if nature calls
-Too many chutneys will confuse, a tag on little cups would have helped.

I was craving to visit this place for lunch since the day I came to know about it opening just a stone's throw away from my office..And believe me every second of my wait was worth it. I wished I could eat everything they had on offer had my stomach did not have any limits :) 

Dosa, Idli, Vada and Uttapam are at its best and the chutneys they have on offer are incomparable (simply heavenly).

Everyone who is going through my review must visit this place to believe what I believe...don't wait.

Planning to bring my children asap since the kids would not be disappointed coz apart from South Indian they have variety of Pizzas, Pastas, Sandwiches, burgers etc on offer as well. 

The staff is friendly and explains minute details about the chutneys they serve!!

The ambience is cosy and I am short of words to thank the owners for coming up at this place..Best of luck.... The Chutney Co...

I went to have lunch at Piccadilly Square but since they share the place, I happened to try their Mixed Uttappam and it was the best Uttappam I had ever had in my life. We were offered different chutney options which we do not get elsewhere. The only negative thing was that they took a lot of time to prepare the food. One Uttappam = 15-20 minutes

Waiting area is hopeless. 
Front desk staff should learn how to treat the guests.
They feel there is no other option available in the city. Waiting area can hardly accommodate 15 people & that wait becomes even tough if the staff doesn't know how to behave.

Huge menu with real change of variety for both south Indian and Italian cuisine.  It does keep its reputation of picadali square. 
From starter till dessert, whatever is served has a super taste.

Impeccable service from the time i was waiting for my dad and hubby at the restaurant, placing of order, recommendation's, food on the table and the bill...very smooth. The servers were motivated and attentive

Food : 4.5/5
We ordered Masala Vada, Molgapodi Mysore Idly, Mysore Idly, Butter Dosa and offcourse all the Chutneys to sample taste. Loved the peanut chutney, tasted like the satay sauce. The Filter coffee could have been better.

Overall a very nice experience,

Besides the food and chutney , their sambhar is amazing. Their mysore chutney and Sweet onion tomato chutney are awesome. At the end we had their special South Indian coffee.

A beautiful ambience combined with a wonderful variety of mouth watering dishes, The Chutney Co. simply amazed me. The innovative backdrop, composed of Pot paintings, that too depicting a South Indian setting, provides simple sophistication and makes quite a statement. Service is very good, presentation is impressive, prices are quite reasonable, and you have the cupcake counter too, which is also quite a treat for the eyes. In all, I must say, my friends and I really enjoyed our visit to The Chutney Co. and would visit it soon again.

A twist to the south Indian list of rest. In kolkata,  variety of chutneys, soothing and not so heavy interiors along with economical charges,  makes it a must visit for foodies. Another pro is Picaddily Square which serves great Italian food.    AVOID AVOID AVOID it on Sunday evenings.

It was a tuesday, when I with my best friend being there, I like the ambience and interior of the place though it was very minimal in interior but I liked it, staff were good and friendly. We ordered a molagapodi dosa and sambar vada with coco chutney, sweet onion, peanut, raw mango nd curaikkay chutney. All were good and deliciius. And we finished it with filter coffee. In total one will enjoy being there. If possible will be there with my loved one once again.

Here comes a south Indian feast from one of my favourite kitchen of Piccadilly square . it's a fresh interior in the busy working centre of Dalhousie. The interiors are on a similar theme as that of other outlets of Piccadilly but yet a bit bright and freshening. Coming to food , I must say and compliment the team for maintaining the quality of food even with the south Indian menu . I liked the concept of serving variety of chutneys and then allowing the customer to select which one to be refilled . we ordered molgapadi Mysore idly which was smooth enough to melt down your throat. The mendu vadas were crisp and one could feel that they were fried and served unlike most of the other joints where they are pre fried and just warmed and served . the sambhar was also perfect and went well will the vadas . I liked Mysore masala chutney along with the normal coconut chutney. The dosa was also perfectly crisp . last but not the least , the filter coffee . how can you not have a filter coffee if you are out for a south Indian feast . the coffee was a perfect blend and reminds me of my old home neighbours who are from south India. On the whole a very nice experience and must visit place .hoping that they can introduce south Indian menu to other outlets soon.

There is so much to say about this lovely family restaurant.... 
Firstly... There are quite a few south Indian food outlets in kolkata... But none has the ambience that' the chutney co' has...lovely ambience.... An ambience where we can think of spending a good time with the family...
 
Secondly... And the most important.... Delicacy..... The food is simply awesome.... The perfect authentic south Indian taste... Lovely options for chutneys (it completely justifies the name 'the chutney Co.')... Guys do not miss on trying out the tangy raw mango chutney... Its simply awesome... And the mysore idli!!! The softest of all the idlis I have ever had..... The lemon sevai!!

Thirdly and lastly.... The perfect combination of cuisines for a complete family get together.... Crepes.. Waffles... Pizzas... Sandwiches.. All along with south Indian food.... What else do we need... There is food for all the age groups...

Woww !!! If you are looking for authentic south indian food with a 5 star feel, I stongly recommend "The Chutney Co.". 

I  am a foodie and multiple times I have been to most south indian joints in kolkata but the feel, hygiene, ambience and taste of this place is just awesone. Do try their "Mysore Idli" and "Sevvai" for sure apart from the regular south indian food.

Options from Piccadily Square adds to the awesomeness. Keep Rocking :)

Newly opened nice place to eat. This area deserved a place like this to open. Delicious quick all veg food, aptly priced with good customer service. Menu is Italian and South Indian. Try their different varieties of chutneys, crepes and ice cream sundae made on ice plate. Must go. Great work to the team here.

Poor and slow Service..  Food was ok.. Ambiance was nice.. The waiters were not attentive and had to wait a lot for the sambhar and extra chutney. Which was irritating!

Irritated by continuous rain and hungry at my offc in Brabourne Road, I thought of goin to this place. 
Its located in the building beside Great Eastern Electronics Shop in Dalhousie on the first floor.

A friend of mine accompanied too & we were too excited abt d new joint in this commercial area.

The decor is desi simple innovative and nice ambience pleased us....

We were given d menus of both Chutney & Co and The Piccadely but we were focused on South Indian Cuisine specially lookin forward to the varied chutneys

We ordered : 
Masala Vada...... One of d best I've ever had and d best in town; Crispy, Oil free, Onion and Fried Dal enhancing d taste perfectly

Malgopodi Idli..... Soft hot & freshly served with Malgopodi chutney spread over the Idli along; tasted good.

Rava Onion Masala Dosa..... Again I must say perfect crisp and taste but totally oil free; masala was given seperately to conceive the crispness of the Dosa, I loved it to d last byte:-)

Each dish is served with 3 Chutneys and all tasted amazing...... 
Chutneys had varied tastes tickling my tongue with pinches lyk Sweet, Classy Coconut, Sour, Fresh Coriander, Chilly and lots more

The staff was too cordial and catered all our needs without any lag.....

Highly recommended place to be friends and family for a brunch or wid colleagues after work

A really nice place to have south indian.Good ambiance nice decor and amazing food. The thing which makes this resturant different from other south indian resturant is the 9 types of chutney which they give and the mysore idli which is the big idli which is not avilable in kolkata in any resturant. They also serve sevai in a Diferent way which are found in southern indians. Sambhar is amazing.Overall its a really nice place with good food. Its expensive thn other famous south indian resturants.

It is surely a Chutney co. as it specialises in chutney in particular. Muw....yummy just superb chutneies they have I could have all their south Indian dishes with just chutney itself no need of sambhar. After a along time I have eaten such soft idlis. I tried their lemon sevai thats also yummy.All in all it is a place to enjoy your meal . The only disadantage or negative aspect is they are not well organised. There is some confusion in the atmosphere the staff looks confused.

A South Indian delight!
After waiting in the queue for an hour, and ofcurz d hunger level reaching its peak, the food was truly the best south Indian food I ve had in Kolkata. Ever. They offer a variety of chutneys.. 3 free with every dish. I liked the sweet onion tomato chutney the most. The sambhar was very authentic. They also have the very famous 'thathhe' idly also called mysore idly. It just melts in ur mouth... (Yumm).. We also ordered dosas.. Each one of it was truly delicious. The rava dosa.. The paper dosa.. The cheese dosa.. Loved each of it!!
Further, they hv a tie up with Piccadilly.. So fr desserts.. We can choose frm waffles and crepes. An amazing way to end ur sumptuous meal..
Chutney is here to stay. The location, right in the busy office area, must b a relief to the hundreds of office goers in that area..
Just hope dey do something abt the long queue.

South Indian and mouth watering desserts at  in an official area and opposite to The Lalit. Simply applaudable! Went there with my friends today. Had Popeye Pick Crepes, Pizza Uttapam, Walnut Brownie and Blueberry Pancake. There was nothing amazing with the brownie and pancake but, crepes and uttapam were way too good. However, the quantity of chutneys served were too less even for one person. Ambience is peaceful.
Way to go! üëç

A very innovative and trendy restaurant idea with the quality of food being served being good
It's however sad to see the poor staff efficiency and slow service making it a blunder as a restaurant.
The place surely is famous for its chutneys and the dosas and idlys were also good
While they give only 3 chutneys per dish you can easily ask them to give different types of chutneys with different dishes to get a taste of all chutneys for which the place is famous
Don't get too excited to eat there as the staff is super slow and it took a lot of time-way longer than expected-to get the food at the table. This makes it a not so desirable option if you're hungry
I don't think I spotted a good parking spot near the restaurant being located on a busy road.

Overall I would say eating there was an okay experience as the long waiting times even though the restaurant was more or less empty overruled the desire to try all the chutneys. I'd recommend to try out this place if one wants to taste all the different types of chutneys but be prepared to wait for a long time as they take a lot of find time to bring the food even in an almost empty restaurant

This place is certainly setting a benchmark among South Indian restaurants in Calcutta. The food we ate was simply first class. The variety of chutney on offer is amazing. The Paper Masala Dosa was quite good, very crisp. But what made me their fan was the Mysore idli. This is probably THE best idli you'll ever have in your life. Must try ! Apart from that you have desserts from Piccadilly Square to end on a sweet note. The place is becoming quite popular on weekends, so be prepared to wait for upto 30-40 mins for your turn. Apart from that full marks for location, decoration, ambience and service.@

I loved the place. Idlis were awesome as was the filter coffee. I was so happy with the "choco dynamite" waffles. But, the sevai was a big let down in what could have been a near perfect experience. Sevai, like upma, should be light and fluffy. Here, it was doused in oil and tadka dal! Why so much fried dal, which was semi-rock-hard? Please improve the sevai, your's is the only place I get in Kolkata and it is my favourite of all South Indian dishes. It broke my heart üòû

There are so many great south Indian restaurants in the city, but not all spaces are conducive for spending a couple of hours with your family or friends over simple food, great coffee and lovely ambience. At this humble spot, you're always ensured a consistently good cup of coffee, alongside bites like their Mysore Idli, Tomato Savaii (rice noodles) or Paper Dosa. Situated above great eastern electronics store which is right opposite of Lalit Great Eastern hotel, you might miss The Chutney Co. if you don't look out for it.

First we got served a south Indian platter which consists of Tomato Savaii, Molagapodi Idli, Vada, Paneer Fritter and four kinds of special chutneys.

Paneer Fritters were uniquely prepared with, chilli garlic flavoured paneer coated with crushed papad and deep-fried to perfect golden brown. Paneer Fritters was perfect appetizer for any gathering in a rainy day. Molaga Podi Idli is a staple in most South Indian homes (especially in Tamil Nadu) and a subject of intense fascination for non-South Indians. Molaga podi means chilli powder, served with fair amount of ghee this idli was definitely a spicy one. I tried Tomato Sevai and found its magnificent, sevai are a type of rice noodles popular in South India especially Tamil Nadu and sevai preparations include coconut, lemon and tomato.

Now it‚Äôs time to enjoy one of the Karnataka delicacies, Mysore Idli. After first bite I realised that this idli was very soft and melt in mouth type. Every time I dipped in different chutneys it was giving diverse sensation in my taste buds, truly enjoyable.

In The Chutney Co. you should try-out all nine chutneys but with every dish, maximum three kinds of chutneys you can cherry-pick. From traditional chutneys to latest fusion chutneys, all are available to enrich your taste buds. Among the nine chutneys; Coconut, Spicy Coconut, Mysore, Coriander, Spicy Tomato, Sweet Onion-Tomato, Peanut, Raw Mango and Curaikkay Chutney, I specifically liked mango, peanut, curaikkay and coconut chutney.

A happy ending desert was Chocolate Cake. Normally I prefer my chocolate cake served little bit warm and it could not be better if it‚Äôs topped with chocolate chip ice cream. Here chocolate cake served, was really just endless, so thick and gooey and even better from being warm. After first bite I was astonished as I had no idea it would be this incredibly rich, chocolaty and overwhelming.

They made freshly brewed coffee in their house coffee grinding machine. For the more serious coffee drinkers, you even got to specify a brewing method of choice for their special coffee beans. For a sweet treat, choose from their range of desserts in their display, and sit back with a strong coffee to enjoy your time.

It‚Äôs too early to comment that they serve best south Indian food in the city but food was no doubt delicious, especially their innovative Chutney‚Äôs made them more interesting. As we all know, no new restaurant can proclaim that they have signature dishes, it‚Äôs the review of patrons who turn their regular dishes to ‚ÄòSignature Dishes‚Äô with due time. I will definitely try out this place once more and run through their other dishes also. Not the cheapest, but check them out for the high quality of food served. My best wishes with The Chutney Co. for their future success.

South Indian being my all time fav cuisine I had been waiting to go to The Chutney Co. Didn't get place the first time we went there. It was a Sunday and there was a queue of at least 50 people waiting ahead of us. So we went again during a week day. The parking was easy. Still the Place was almost full . Decor gave a very contemporary South Indian look and the ambience was warm and welcoming. We ordered for idli, dosa, uttapam and coffee. The owner Pooja recommended Mysore Idli and I'm glad I called for it. The normal idli was good, dosas were super crispy which I loved but most heavenly  was the Mysore idli. It just melts and disappears in the mouth. That's one thing that will make me go there again and again for sure. (In fact I'm looking forward to it). Also loved the raw mango chutney and spicy chutney. Sambar was  thick and sweet for my taste. I would recommend this place to everyone and specially Mysore idli n chutneys. No other place in Kolkata serves chutneys like this does.

Had heard a lot about the restaurant and wanted to go there from quite some. We ordered idli, sambhar vada and rawa dosa. Each dish came with a combination of 3 types of chutneys which could be chosen from a variety of 5 types of chutneys. I quite liked all the types of chutneys, be it the onion one or the imli one. In fact at the end I noticed that I ended up not eating the traditional nariyal chutney and did not even miss it. However, those looking for authentic South Indian food may miss the white coconut chutney. One complaint which I majorly had , which reflects very badly on the eating joint was that we found ants in the fresh lime soda which we ordered. This was the first thing served on our table, & we were hugely disappointed by the hygiene conditions. 

However the overall food was delicious, the waffles with Belgium dark chocolate ice cream awesum and on the whole, if we ignore the ant part, an enjoyable experience. A place we would like to visit again!

After probably a while I had really good South Indian food in the city (honestly, Jyoti Vihar can become boring after a while and Salt Lake doesn't have good South Indian, Rasam is just a compromise). The dishes were very well-prepared, be it the idli or the rava dosa or the uttappams or even the masala, kudos to the chef! Among the chutneys, the two green ones (I can't remember their names) were my absolute favourites, followed by the tomato chutney and, to an extent, peanuts chutney. The ambiance was really nice and a mixed gentry will ensure that this restaurant can do much better! However, I would really like to emphasise on the slow service, which sticks out as the sore thumb of the otherwise wonderful place. You need to buck up the orders and your servers need to understand the timings between two dishes. We had to wait for like 5-7 minutes before we called out to someone to give us the menu. I understand you guys are having busy days, but then again, you just need to work a bit on this. I haven't tried the takeaway, so I can't comment on that: nevertheless, the dine-in experience was great!

Also, do try the sukku coffee (it has a strong after taste and hits your throat pleasantly) and the belgian chocolate ice cream dessert (again, forgetting the name).

All in all, a really good place for lunch in that area!

This place didn't disappointed me in any manner. I was excited to see the flavours of chutneys like raw mango chutney, spicy tomato chutney which I would have never thought of eating with any south Indian food. And overwhelmed after having. 
This place is definitely on my cards again. The best South Indian food served here. Totally worth the price and visit.

This place is a perfect example of trapping people with good publicity. I had read about the place in the newspaper where they very gloriously gloated about the 9 different kinds of chutneys they serve with the food and all sorts of good stuff with a very elaborate menu. 
Visited this place for breakfast on a Sunday morning and was thoroughly disappointed. 
Ambience : great ambience and decor 
Food : we ordered for paper plain dosa, idli and vada along with a filter coffee and lemonade and later on a lemon ice cream. 
The dosa was crispy and tasted good. Idli and vada were good as well. Lemonade was too sour. The filter coffee and sambhar served were ice cold. Sambhar tasted more like tamarind water. Out of the 9 chutneys one was not available. Lemon sorbet was dense, not how a sorbet should be. We also asked for a portion of gun powder and the portion served was 1/4 of what any good joint provides. 
Service : grim server. Full of attitude. Not at all welcoming and pleasant to talk to. I don't think he's ever smiled in his life. 
Prices are reasonable. Menu is most basic and ordinary. Nothing great about it. 
Special mention should be made for the owner of the place. When my mother and I were tasting the ice cream she came along and told the server to give less during tasting. Great way to make the customer feel welcome, madam. Great attitude towards the customers and we definitely felt so good standing there and hearing you say this in front of us. 
Would never recommend this place to anyone. And would definitely never visit it again.

Locational advantage during the day as it is in the middle of the business district of Kolkata and yet in the evenings, it's even better as parking is not an issue anymore. 

Strategically well placed, chutney co. along with Picadilly square, it will attract foot falls for the mass public and not those who enjoy food for the pleasure it brings along. 

Most importantly, the food is average. Tried the Aglio Olio(Picadilly Menu) and not very overwhelmingly satisfied because the best in class is still the one at Fire and Ice. The pizzas are not great either, not what your taste buds demand truthfully. 

South Indian though from the small menu is very ordinary, not anything really different and exquisite. Except for the serving style of dosas and uttapams, this place doesn't make me feel like I would come  again for the South Indian atleast. Sambhar is a complete No No - it's utterly sweet. 

Disappointed. Wouldn't recommend.

My taste buds wanted to have some new south Indian food of newly opened restaurant so I selected Chutney Co the place is extremely pocket friendly and gives a good break from typical south Indian taste this place is divided in two parts but presently one part is open Picaddily square and chutney co & the other part is vacant. There is a live kitchen also. You can see chef preparing dishes over there. The place is well decorated and food is up to the mark...it is located in prime location of Dalhousie. I had 9 different types of chutneys from raw mangoes to peanuts. I was really fascinated with the taste just didn‚Äôt like peanut chutney killer combination of classic and modern food together on the pricing side Picaddily square¬† menu was bit high but for the taste it‚Äôs all granted 

It has opened just a few days back but still I'd like to say great food off both the menus. I highly recommend this place to all!

Its an absolutely awesome place with great ambience and location wise its very commutable. I went on a Sunday so it was little crowded but unlike any other restaurant, this place has a proper waiting area where you can sit and decide what you want to have.¬†

I ordered Mysore idly and Mixed uttapam and it was heavenly. The quality, the taste and the way it was being served.... every thing was very good. The whiteness and the softness of the idly was something you will not find so easily . The taste was very different of ¬†what we usually eat or have tasted earlier. The sWe ordered 3 chutneys of our choice and each one tasted so different , also the sambar was delicious. Lastly I had filter coffee and believe me this is something I haven't came across since a long long time-it was so fresh and what an aroma!!!
One thing I can assure all that if you do not like south Indian food then please visit this place and you'll surely be love with this cuisine.

2 food joints Chutney Co and Picadilly Square is under the same roof. I although went to Chutney Co hearing from my friend about the place. It is quite spacious and the whole ambience was beautiful. They serve tasty delicacies from the south and I felt it is one of the best places to hang out especially on the weekends with your friends and family. I went to the place with 2 friends of mine and I had Lemon Sevai and r which was indeed tasty . We also had Sukku coffee and Masala Dosa and plain vadas. The tangy and spicy taste of the raw mango and spicy coconut chutneys made me ask fro more servings.

A very nice place for casual dining. ¬†The food served was delicious and I loved their behaviour. The food was served within 15-20 minutes of waiting.I had masala vada along with suku coffee. The coffee seemed freshly ground. The aroma that came out was awesome.I will surely come back to this place to try out their onion Uttapam which looked ¬†indeed yum and also tasty

This is a restaurant located at the heart of Kolkata. I went from my office with my office colleagues. The food that ¬†I had was sumptuous ,tasty and of a very good quality. We were four of us and we ordered 2 plates of ghee masala dosa and 1 plate of coconut sevai and a plate of Mysore idly. I had 2 servings of sambar as I simply loved it. I loved their spicy coconut chutney. I loved the overall ambience.

A perfect place to quench your craving for south indian food. It shares the floor with Picadally Square and is loacted on the 1st floor bang opposite The Lalit Great Eastern. Extremely crisp dosas served with 3 varieties of chutneys (Plz ask the waiter to help you choose the best ones to go with your order). My personal fav is mysore chutney. The best part about this place is that appeals to all age groups. I saw a group of grandpas sitting there and chatting, it seemed like their regular adda :)
The ambience, lighting, decor, staff courtesy and food quality are absolutely perfect if you are looking for some quality time, peaceful meal, taking your parents/grandparents out. This place as much for the soul as for the stomach :p

This weekend I have visited this place with my family. The decor is beautiful and the chutneys simply reminded me of the days I have been in Chennai for my work. ¬†The food was served within 15 minutes of ordering.My husband loved their speciality ,the Mysore Idly. It was really yummy. I had Onion Uttapam and filtered coffee. Both were indeed very good. I would love to visit this place again.

Three Dosas, Nine Chutneys! 

Recently Chutney Co has opened right opposite where I work and I decided to take my two sisters with me to try it. After ordering three dosas we were waiting and admiring the ambience and how great it is to have something finally near your office. 
The dosas although a bit oily were amazing and fresh. They tasted great and geled together with the chutneys. We had 9 different types ranging from raw mangoes to peanuts. I was really fascinated with the plating and how each bite with a different chutney sprang my taste buds to life. 
The place is extremely pocket friendly and gives a good break from the near commercial atmosphere. 
Don't forget to top it off with a dessert from Piccadilly. It's an amazing combo.

I had heard about the place and thought to drop in. Once you enter the restaurant you had the feel of mini South India at the bustling Dalhousie area. The decor has been made very thought fully with replicas of traditional South Indian images and soft lighting complementing with relaxing music an enchanting ambiance . We had ordered for Mixed Uttapam and filter coffee. The food taste really good and you have the option to choose 3 different varieties of Chutney's from 6 options in the menus. I had chosen Raw mango chutney, spicy coconut chutney and sweet onion tomato chutney. Like the presentation of the chutneys and sambar. You can have chutneys refilled as much as you like free of cost. Price is moderate. ¬†Filter coffee aroma I just love it. Will come back again to have more delicacies.. Really a good place to tickle South Indian taste buds:)

This place proved to be a life saver at a time when I was craving for filter kaapi. Housed in the same premises as Piccadily Square in the heart of the city at Dalhousie, they let you order from both the menus. This place is a must visit if you are in the lookout for authentic South Indian snacks and filter coffee. I went along with a colleague and sampled their lemon sevai, masala dosa and filter coffee. The lemon sevai was good, although the portion was a tad bit less in comparison to usual helpings. Having stayed in Chennai for three years and sampling the food there, I missed the distinct tanginess of lemon in the sevai. On the other hand, the dosa was tasty and the accompanying three chutneys were equally delicious. The coconut chutney was a bit too solid, for my taste, though, and could have been a little more thinner in consistency. The masala ‚Äî very small portion ‚Äî came separately along with the dosa and on asking for a refill, we were told that it was chargeable. But after a quick conversation with one of their servers, we were promptly served a complimentary bowl of masala. The filter coffee was excellent and just the way it should be served traditionally. The servers are alert and very courteous.¬†Seating arrangement is good and the place is done up with quirky lights made out of recycled coconut shells, lending a distinct south Indian flavour to the ambience, in addition to paintings of food, classical music and dance forms from down South. What appealed to me were the single tables attached to the walls for solitary customers. The filter coffee most definitely draws me for repeated visits!

Highs:
Ambience is decent. We ordered mainly South Indian and few continental dishes. Mushroom crepe could have been better. Wait staffs are courteous and proactive. Decently priced. A birthday pastry on the house by the management was highly welcomed. Kudos for that.

Lows:
We ordered for many hot and cold beverages, but most of them were disappointing. Finding a parking space can be a tedious thing to do.

First, I liked and impressed with ambience, its attractive and and neat & clean, Staffs are well behaved and friendly.

We order some some south indian food, presentation of food as well as taste is amazing.

Happy to visit.

This restaurant is in the heart of the commercial area of Kolkata and probably there are more take away orders but the Name of the Restuarant is quite a paradox to its service. The quantity of chutney they serve is so meager that one can't have his meal with it. I had visited the place and had to ask for extra chutney twice in 1 serving item although the quality of food is good. Today I took a parcel which was totally disappointing as you can see in the pictures. I really doubt the Restuarant being so miser in providing essential things. If they can't survive at these prices, they should probably increase the prices or discontinue such products. You can basically see the base of the plate through chutney. I would request the management to look into it seriously as there are other South Indian options available in the vicinity with better service.

Location : 

This place is situated in Dalhousie area. Opposite The Lalit Hotel and above Great Eastern Appliances Showroom. It's on the first floor and is in a commercial business hub area. Parking on Saturday evening and Sundays are no issue. You will get it easily. 

Ambience : 

This place is divided in two parts but presently one part is open and the other part is vacant. I don't know what their plans is in future. As this place houses two restaurant at one place. The Chutney Co. & Picadily Square. Maybe in future one for each. 

Interiors are average but not bad also. Chairs are comfortable but small tables for 2-3 people are tilting. Please have a look in that. Moving place is less as they have fit in more tables for more seating. There is a live kitchen also. You can see chef preparing dishes over there. 

Food : 

We went to have South Indian food at The Chutney & Co. Although they are serving both menus of The Chutney Co & Picadily Square also. 

South Indian was really good. We tried Mysore Idli, Onion Rava Dosa, Plain Dosa & Vada. They all come with different kind of chutneys. That's the good and speciality of this restaurant. But the quality of the food is really very nice. Perfect blend of taste and very nicely cooked. Chefs are doing a good job. 

Was really happy and satisfied with the food. 

Service : 

Service was also good and fast. Didn't take much time to bring our order and Waiters were trained enough to handle it properly. Only one suggestion guyzz please smile a little. It makes customers more happy. 

Price : 

Price is on average side. Not very low also and not very high also. Suitable enough for everybody at this kind of place. Won't hurt too much. 

Overall I really enjoyed having food there and will go again to try more dishes. Will surely recommend everybody to try out. 

Cheers !!!

I cant resist visiting the newly opened restaurants considering there isint much to explore in the city, and this time when my mom told me about The Chutney co ¬†we decided to dine the very same day, i.e. yesterday. They are one the best south indian joints when it comes to variety and ambience and seating space . Loved the overall decor and behavior of the staff, though all seemed to be rushing due to massive turnout. ¬†I loved the Mysore Dosa and their special Curaikkay chutney. My dad tried the sambhar vada and he seemed quite delighted. Based on Pooja's recommendation we tried the tomatoe sevai and mysore idly which too were quite different, healthy and light. ¬†Overall we had a nice time and the experience was good. and I must say if on a Wednesday night people were turned away coz of no space I am sure this place is already buzzing with the word of mouth publicity. For south indian lovers this place is a refreshing change from the usual hangouts.

I am a complete foodie. I always make sure to visit the newly opened restaurants and this time I went to Chutney co to dine with my family. ¬†I must say that they serve one of the best south Indian dishes. Loved the overall ambiance and behavior of the waiters. I loved the Onion Uttapam and their special Curaikkay chutney. My wife had the cheese masala dosa and that too was quite good. The crispy dosa looked yummy and I too had a bite from my wife's plate and felt it was heavenly. Thank you Chutney co for the lovely and tasty food.

I happened to be at this beautiful restaurant. This has a good ambiance and also good food I must say. I am not a fan of south Indian delicacies but still fell in love with the Mysore Idly that was served here. It was very soft and tasty. We have also ordered Cocunut Sevai and Filter coffee. I simply loved the aroma of the coffee which I felt were freshly ground and filtered. The Sevai here is something that is quite different and good. I felt one can have it in any part of the day. This place is quite pocket friendly and is perfect for college goers.

I visited this restaurant just a few days back with my friends. The time we entered the place we loved the overall decor.4 of us were there and we ordered Mysore idly, 2 Masala Dosa and a plate of plain vada. I personally loved the Mysore Idli and I would suggest everyone should try this. ¬†The waiters were good and we got the food within 20 minutes or so. We were offered with three tasty and tangy chutneys of our choice. I will surely like to visit the place again.

If south indian is on your mind but also with a modish ambience..  Then THE CHUTNEY CO. Is the place to be.. 
True to its name it serves a variety of chutneys.. Some of the must haves.. Mysore chutney.. Currikkay chutney (didn't know lauki could taste so good) 
Along wth Piccadilly square it is d perfect place to enjoy ur idli dosa and also satisfying d craving fr ur favorite "Dublin mudslide ".
Have Been there twice and the experience was satisfying as always :)

Went there on monday at around 8.40 pm and on enterin this place I was greeted by a loud cacaphoney resembling a fish market. On closer look found a party in progress but what surprised me was that instead of a separate segragated enclosure for the party, here the main restaurant area was uaed and children were running helter shelter, screaming and shouting.
No one was there to acknowledge our presence and wr haf to call a waiter to avail a table. Another 5 mins of agony filled standing till a table was given to us. Order was taken and when we expresses our wush to choose the three varieties of chutney, it was refused. Waiter said we shall give u our regular 3 varities. If you want other types, it shall be billed........ Now that is not what is written on their menu cards. 
Food came and was okay. Ordered for rossti rounds also but found these are ready made ready to fry potato rounds...... Highly unprofessional for a place run by Piccadily square keepin their repute in mind. Final straw....... No one to serve water. Had to literraly call a waiter and plead with him to serve us water....... All in all a miserable experience. Maybe had chosen a wrong day.

Must visit place this. Located right above the Great Eastern Electronic's Store in B.B.D. Bag opposite The Lalit Great Eastern. Combined menus of #PiccadillySquare & #TheChutneyCo. Make it an even more awesome experience.
Sorry for the lack of pics..
It has opened just a few days back but still I'd like to say great food off both the menus .

Mysore Idli is absolutely melting-soft, Tomato Sevai (rice noodles) are the right tang. 
Masala Vada, onion rava dosa, Paper dosa are some of the regulars that we tried. 
A must try is the 'Pizza Uttapam'. 
and choose any 3 chutney flavors from a list of 9 (Yes, Nine!!) flavors of chutneys available!
The servers give almost all the chutneys combining it with the various mains ordered off the south-indian menu which is what makes it a must try dining experience. 
Their ginger lemon soother is also a must try if one can palate the just-right extra lemony tang. 
For desserts they have a variety of gelatos apart from their creamless cakes, cupcakes, muffins etc. which is available on display beside the gelato counter. 
Besides, they also have the desserts one can order off the menu of @ Piccadilly Square so options are aplenty. 
To finish off, one must try their filter-coffee. Ask the server to serve it extra-hot and to make it strong if your taste-buds are up for strong coffee. 
This place is now on my regular visit list.

Given it's their first weekend , the place was a little chaotic , however , you could see the owner of the place running around , taking orders and making dosas.

Great place and would love to come back here.

This place serves the best South Indian in Kolkata! The ambiance is amazing and so is the service...

The Chutneys (which the places has created ¬†a USP with) are all amazing and leave a flavor that you keep wanting to come back for...

I specially love the single seating where its just you and your food and no view to disturb... If you are not fond of eating alone then you could try the other seating areas which are equally comfortable and classy...

The interior is very different and unique with focus on detail... The open kitchen for a South Indian restaurants is excellent as it is not a common idea...

You have to try the dosa the idli the wada... the everything... I highly recommend this place to all!

Starting with the decor & location, it's quite nice n suttle looked up place at d centre of commercial area, right above great eastern electrical appliance showroom,near bbd bagh.
The place is kept simple, would like to rate it 4 star.
Coming to the main things
food & service :
I ordered mysore dosa which was perfect for my taste bud in the lunch time which was served with 3 options of chutney I chose such as : spicy coconut chutney , raw mango chutney, & curaikkay chutney (which was perfect in all d ways). The owner Pooja Baid ji also made me try - sevai a very light dish but quite tummy filling. Which also one can try..
Must add, that it lives upto it's name, I got full flavour, n relish my taste buds.
The staff was attentive , prompt and helpful in suggesting.
The pocket pinch was quite reasonable.
All in all I m very satisfied and will visit again along with frnz.. thanks.
