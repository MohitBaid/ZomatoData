Ordered Chicken Do pyaza.
Not worth money.
Very small 2 chicken pieces.
Taste was not good at all.
There was no salt in the gravy and the chicken pieces where equal to no.It felt like eating only onions in do pyaza.
Would not recommend to anyone.

An amazing place managed beautifully by a very hard working lady. The biriyani and chilly chicken are a must have. And don't forget to have the mocktails and desserts.
Well done ðŸ˜˜
