Ordered Veg Fried Rice, Chicken butter masalla & garlic chicken.  Taste is too ordinary & not upto the standard. Details follow:

Taste & Quantity :  1.5 / 5
#Fried rice was very sticky & not atall tasty. Peas were half cooked and the whole rice was very watery instead of dry & fine. Quality of rice was not high. 
#Garlic chicken was so light that it hardly had any taste. Chicken pieces were too small wrapped up with corn flour to look big. 
#Butter masala looked good but incredibly had no tadte of salt & sugar. 

Delivery : 2/5
Delivered within a vicinity of 3km still charged â‚¹25 that too not on time. 

Menu Availability :  2/5
Most of the displayed menus are not available and insists on their choice. 

Overall experience was not a good one and will not recommend either.

Very poor service. And the food tastes like shit. Will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Two to three times when I ordered tandoori roti for take away , while eating I noticed that it was burnt so it tasted like shit and also ordered fish fingers along with it , they too were under cooked. So I'm extremely disappointed with their service and food items as well.

Okay so again I had to go to this restaurant again. This is not even a Good restaurant ðŸ‘Ž previously I visited and had the BEKAR wala ExperienceðŸ˜‘ I had no options yesterday so I went there forcefully ðŸ˜• 

As the Sawan Days are going couldn't order anything except Veg ðŸ˜­ so I ordered Veg fried rice and Paneer manchurian. And these two cost me 250 ðŸ˜Ž but the quantity was much more less. It was not so on the the money.
Though it doesn't taste heavenly, but it was enough to  prevent me from so much hunger. As I eat like a horse, I forgot that I'm eating something that should be given to the Patients of near by Zenith nursing homeðŸ˜’

Okay food was 2.5/10 ðŸ˜‘ (bohot de di bc nacho ab,zyada expect mat karo Penguin walo)
They took 20-30 minutes to serve ðŸ˜– (kaha ka nyay hai bhai,? Bhukhe insaan ko itna wait kaun karwata hai)
not visting again. ekdam nahi nahi nahi..

Once I went to this restaurant. There was hardly 2 customers in that spacious place. they charge extra money for the AC room. when we step into the AC room you won't believe how was that. stinky smelly area. Just horrible. there was most probably 2 or 3 ACs but they will not switch on the AC. U have to adjust with 1 AC n you can hardly feel that is an AC room. u have to adjust with fan..
whatever we ordered though all things ware over priced n quantity ws not regular. You won't believe what they serve as biriyani. Worst biriyani I ever had. That was not biriyani.that was boiled rice with restless chicken. No salt no biriyani masala nothing. Just nothing . Even road side 60 rs biriyani was far far better than that.Worst experience ever. I will suggest roadside alukabli over that food. Plz don't go to that place. if u want food thn go to anywhere ,have muri chenachur pantavat u can even starve but not that . I don't want to give this restaurant even half rating

I just don't have any words to say about this noble restaurant, but it's really a awesome restaurant and even the cost is also very good and suitable for everybody, even every of the foods are sooo much delicious! And all the persons who said bad things about it are just wrong and absolutely a nonsense. They just don't have any idea about eating. According to me, it's the best restaurant. The restaurant service is also very nice. According to me, I can't compare any restaurant with Penguin as it's the best. But However, it have a bit problem that sometimes (very rarely) it gives you stale foods.

It's beautiful place to hangout with friends for a dinner. Good ambience and a very pocket friendly prices. They have common dishes though, don't expect any specialty there. I had 'Handi Biriyani', 'Mixed Fried Rice' there. Handi biriyani is better than others in Belgharia area. Small pieces of mutton and mostly bones but taking the price is mind, it's considerable. Recommended for the food seekers from Belgharia if you don't want to hurt your pocket.

This is the largest restaurant in Belghoria. Located near the Belghoria Bata, in the first floor of a market, the seating arrangement here is divided into a non-AC large hall and an AC smaller area. Service is fast.

The mixed fried rice here was light and flavourful. The chicken and shrimp pieces were well marinated and tasted great. Quantity was also huge.

The Hong Kong Chicken was spicy with a dominant taste of star anise. There were few pieces of nuts and raisins too. Chicken pieces were decent too.

All prices here are inclusive of taxes.

In all a decent place to dine in if you are nearby. Not worth travelling for.

This used to be a good restaurant some years back. But it's quality has deteriorated a lot in these years. Food quality is not so good, especially their biriyani is horrible! That is why the restaurant is almost empty all the day. I think the management should really look into this and make some big changes to make it good again.

I visited this place last week. It is a good and cheaper place for regular dine at weekends/ small informal gathering here locally. The ambience is not very pleasurable, services are good toward us. Foods are quit impressive (though I was worried with its reviews). Over- all experience is good.
I visited this place second time. This time it was a family dinning hence we call that morning to book table for 9:00pm.
We reached there in time. I will be more happy if  their management would be good. We had to wait for more than 30 minutes at the reception in spite of prior booking. Otherwise food and service was good. Therefore, I discarded a half star for this kind of harassment.

You will understand their food quality once go there. Restaurant stays almost empty lack of customers most of the time, due to their poor quality food.

Though it is located near my house, I had visited this place only once. The first thing that I want to write is about the behaviour of the staffs, more precisely a particular staff. He was very very rude and we have not been given the right to sit in the table of our choice. And I am not going to visit such a place ever again. Coming to the food, it was just ok. Nothing great about it. A big NO from my side.

This is that one restaurant where the whole  family comes together!! Any occasion-be it a birthday party, anniversary treat,pujo dinner or just a regular Saturday night, this is that one place where all the heads reunite. This place has never disappointed when its comes to the expectations.
A nice spacious interior,with large dining area provides a good homely feel. I have tried out the Chinese and mughal dishes and boy it is good. The chicken lollipops, the murg masalam, and the yummy biriyani are a must try if u ever visit here. The Chinese is good- very regular. Service is okayish. The prices are reasonable too.

Located at the heart of Belgharia bazaar on Feeder road this place is surrounded with bazzar hat in and around. So getting through all that mess and traffic could get on to your nerves. However that noise of traffic doesn't hamper your peaceful dinner because its all very sound proof upstairs at the ac lobby.

This restaurant is not a five star if I go by ratings but its just the place I can think of going when it comes to a good wholesome family get together dinner once I'm here.

When people of Belgharia think of dinning out, Penguin is the 1st thing that comes to their mind. This is the biggest and one of the oldest running restaurants in the area. It has both A.C and non-a.c. A.C consist of just one third of the whole area. If compared with the price ambience is below average. It has just one page menu (limited option). Quality of food is okay and pricing is also reasonable.
Suggestion out of my personal experience is that before paying the bill cross check it. They often goof up with the bill.

A big old place turned to not so good place.  I remember years ago,  it was one of the best places to hang around with friends,  and to be dine with family.  Though i should say there food quality is good,  specially the rice items. For example biriyani is simple and so light,  its delicious.  But what turn you off is dirty environment,  its said it have air conditioned,  but not.  Too many mosquito and flys even see cockroachs there.  Should they clean and maintain more,  it would restore to its old self.

This place is weirdly downrated here. I love this place. Decent pricing makes it a great place to have dates in. The biriyani is awesome and so is all the chicken items. The ambience and lighting around makes it feel like a premium place to be in. The glass walls over looking the roads though doesn't make for a pretty sight outside but makes the experience prettier. No complaints on the quality of food whatsoever. My go to place during pujas.

The first and foremost thing that I should mention about this place that they provide first-class rice in almost all the preparations,  from Biriyani to Fried rice, food quality is good compared to other locals. If you stay anywhere near Belghoriya-Birati, this should be your first choice to local dine in,
I generally do not give marks on ambience but here I had to deduct cause they have a lots of place unutilized, which can well accommodate 3 -4 more tables.
