This is a semi street shop ... Not hygenic and the some of the food items are not even fresh. The Rolls, biryani, noodles, are decent enough like the rest of the street food anywhere found in Kolkata. I had tandoori chicken a while back and one of them did smell awful, it almost went bad, due to heat maybe. Similar is is the case with chicken lolipop. When you order it, they just dip the already fried lolipop in batter and fry them again, which is horrible. However you cannot expect anything from such shops. Not to mention it is next to a butcher shop. It gives foul smell. M not sure why it features in zomato. Kuch bhi !! 
But the Rolls , the biryani and the momos does fill ur stomach at decent rate

Provides good quality food in reasonable price. Quite hygienic in comparison to other street restaurants. Quite popular restaurant in that area. Rolls which they serve is very tasty.

Located at Boisakhi market, its a local place where you can get chinese, tandoor, mughlai, and street food. Among all the dishes tried, their egg chicken rolls are simple the best among all the street food in their menu. The egg devils were bland, the momos were very average and their chicken kabiraji was just horrible. Coming to main course, their chicken fried rice  and chicken chow mein was the only thing which are worth trying, among chinese. The garlic chicken was horrible too. Didn't try any tandoori or mughlai dish, and not willing to try even. Come to this shop for rolls only. That is the only advice i can give.

It is a roadside eatery located near Baisakhi mall. I tried this place on a friend's suggestion. We ordered a masala kulcha and egg tarka, priced at Rs 30 and Rs 42 respectively, for takeaway. The food was delicious and was in ample amount. The huge masala kulcha came with a twist. It was stuffed with mixture of boiled potatoes, chopped green chilli, poppy seeds paste, onions, raisins and cashews, resulting in a perfect mix of sweet and salty and spicy flavour. The texture of the kulcha was awesome and it was topped with carrots, coriander and black cumin seeds. One is more than enough for someone with good appetite. The tarka was lovely. We could not stop getting every last bit of it. Overall, a day well spent with good food and good company.

Absolute rubbish . This shop is very much unhygienic & the quality of the food is also terrible. Only have food from here, if you have no other option available. Otherwise don't.

Located between Baishakhi Island and AMP Mall, been here once. I was just passing by when I decided to have some light snacks to satisfy my hunger. Ordered for a Chicken Roll. Served within a small time, it was a huge one for me. I literally struggled to finish off the entire roll. Being a roadside stall, the quality was better than what I had expected. Do not bang upon the hygiene or ambiance here, but the place can be recommended for some light snacks if you are around.
