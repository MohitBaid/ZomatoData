The place is very unhygienic n shabby... The tables are sticky... Uncleand floor n glasses... But still I'm giving it a 3.5 only because of the staff behavior and for the awesome tasty biriyani they had served... Pocket pinch is also moderate... I will recommend for take away rather having the food there...

Once upon a time, I went there with a huge group to take treat from one of my friends on her Birthday to this place.

Food : 3/5
Ambience : 2/5

As we were a huge group and we were in our college which is located in sealdah, she decided to take us there. Her idea was not that bad as she had a lack of money.

We bought cake from Mio Amore and cut that there without any extra charges. That part was good. 

Food was also good. 
We ordered Biriyani, Chili Chicken.
They all were good.

While writing a review for a restaurant which is pathetic in all forms, my vocabulary becomes weak, the funny bones in me crumbles to dust and I end up with a short phrases right to the point.

Taj, as it calls itself has got no real affiliation with the Taj Group of Hotel or the Taj Mahal or the Taj Tea (how evident, isn't it? ) However, one having a plate of salad from the place can boast off by said that he have had dined in Taj. And, this might be the sole reason why people still prefers to visit the place.

The quality of people having food out here is too cheap as for the restaurant who serves them. The food is also poor in quality and you can expect rotting food too, or at least it giving indicating smell of rotting. The salad can be of week's back and hygiene is no where to be found.

The cover picture for this listing displays a plate of biryani and when anyone orders it, they give it to you without even providing you a spoon; and even if they provide, you wouldn't like to use them. They, however doing justice to the service and quality of food, charges less on the bill.

A visit to be avoided by all means.

The hidden gem in rajabazar area- Taj restaurant. Once you enter keshab sen st from rajabazar crossing towards Amherst st, after a few minutes of walk, it’ll come on your right side. Please DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR (though 2 wheeler is fine), forget about hygiene (though I’ve never been sick while eating here from last 10+ years) and get in. You’ll find a true kolkata styled biryani. Though on a bad day, it tends to get a little spicy, but with long grains of rice and one big, soft, fatty meat piece and potato (might be avoided), hardly anything can go wrong. In the breakfast, they make a fantastic mutton korma also. Anyway, coming back to the biryani, I would suggest a full meal here (again, forget about hygiene)/ Start with a piece of chicken fry. 25-30/- for a big drumstick marinated in some strange chicken-65 like masala and deep fried and served to your plate immediately doesn’t sound like a bad deal to me. The next item should be their special mutton biryani with one extra potato piece (because you’ll take your friend along- right) followed by their chicken korma/ kassa and 1 tandoori roti each. Trust me, you won’t regret. I guess, you’re not expecting any fancy seating and service. They boast of an AC, but its mostly non-working. Go there, I don’t think you’ll regret.

Taj Restaurant & Caterer is a very old restaurant known for their Biryani in local for a long. Its actually located in Raja Bazaar. Their menu is short, covering some North Indian dishes but at the time of Ramzaan & Eid they serve other dishes like Halim & Special Firni.

The restaurant is very basic with a outside Roll counter. The dining is average but you will find it empty most of the time. 

Well I took away a packet of Chicken Biryani from them for my dinner.

Chicken Biryani : Unlike really cheap Biryani, their rice were long. It was well cooked but dis balance use of spices made it tasted little hot. The Biryani doesn't seem that it was made with perfections. Portion of Biryani was pretty average. Potato was hard from middle. Chicken piece was hard & very dry. Spices didn't fulfilled the chicken well. It seemed that chicken was fried & cooked outside of the Biryani. Oh, I forgot to mention that all this symptoms declare that the Chicken wasn't fresh. Little burned out pieces mixed with the Biryani was making it tasted very bad sometimes. Overall It tasted below average to me.

Conclusion : Does Taj's Biryani tasted good - No,
Does the pocket pinch was satisfactory - No,
Should you try Taj Restaurant - Well No.

Most of the persons have no idea about the restaurant and the location. It is near to Rajabazar. You will get biriyani having good taste and quantity. No complaints about the rate. I the quality they give must deserve better rate. The chicken tandoori and Chaps are delicious too. You can't find such quality cheaper than this restaurant. If you have low budget and bulk quantity to order, Taj is a good choice. I took biriyani no of times to my home and a single plate is actually enough for me. Low budget plus good taste take this restaurant to a level.

Once we were looking for a place who would serve decent Biryani at a cheap price because we were going to order a bulk for the college freshers and the budget was low. A friend when suggested about this place, we were not sure how this would be. So we came for tasting. That too was about two years ago. The price for a plate of Chicken Biryani was lower then, 90 INR I guess. The Biryani was good according to its price and the quantity was sufficient, pretty much to fill one adult's appetite. Of course, you cannot expect Arsalan standards at a place like this. But this place is fair enough to grab a plate of Biryani sometimes.
