Marufaz is a rising name in terms of mughlai cuisine...It had been quite some time since this restaurant opened and I was craving for a chance to taste it's food......I had a home delivery order of chicken tikka biriyani , keema nan and boneless chicken achari......The keema nan could have been better but was somewhat okayish....chicken achari was very good with four big succulent pieces of chicken and with that tangy taste when you think of anything with word achar but was very good indeed.....For the Biriyani lovers , whether u hesitate or like it or not , it is a MUST TRY ATLEAST ONCE....There are mixed feelings for it ....as the biriyani was not the usual one which has a sweet taste to it rather it was a spicier version with a hell lot of green chillies....at the same time that slight biriyani taste was there...it also had bits of coriander ....and it was without a potato chunk....but was hot.....and again four pieces of chicken tikka kebab were there which were very good....all in whole biriyani is worth giving a try as it a different one....Supratim Das Marufaz

This restaurant is situated on the road joining D.H.Road with James Long Sarani , just opposite Ajanta Cinema Hall . And has earned its name as a decent mughlai restaurant in that area . Though there is no parking facility available . So itz advisable to go there on foot or with any public transport .
.
The sitting facility is upstairs , though the stairs are a bit narrow in width .
.
The decor is nice , the gold plated wallpapers really brings a royal look to the restaurant . There are witty posters of famous Bollywood dialogues on the walls , which are of great humour and real good conversation starters . The napkins on the tables are folded in a special way which definitely catches the eye . Though the open display of a washbasin does decrease the overall ambience .
.
Now coming to the food . We ordered Chicken tikka kebab , Crispy chilli babycorn , Mutton boti kebab as starters . In the main course we ordered Masala kulcha , Chicken makhanwala , Mutton lajawab , Fish achari . In the desserts we ordered for Zafrani Firni . The starters came within 5 minutes . But the staff was not much experienced in bringing the main course items . The main course was delivered when we were not even halfway through our kebabs .
.
Chicken Tikka Kebab was as expected . It was a bit crisp and burnt on the outside which tasted really good . The chutney could have been better though . They serve the kebabs in quite an unique manner . Crispy Chilli Babycorn was really good . The authentic taste was simply drooling . The quantity was more than I had expected . The sauce was good . but the best among starters was Mutton Boti Kebab . It was too good . The pieces were quite big and were quite juicy and spicy . Tasted real good
.
Masala kulcha was ok . Though felt the masala inside the kulcha was quite lacking in quantity and it was very much plain in taste . Fish achari was also not bad . The spicy-sweet-sour combo was quite good and the fish pieces were also well cooked . Chicken Makhanwala was ok . It tasted very generic . It had no special flavour though the pieces were quite big in size . It was the same old typical chicken dish one finds in any restaurant and even homes for that matter . Considering it had a name 'Makhanwala'¬† , I expected a bit of excess butter in it , but was disappointed . Mutton Lajawab was good . Loaded with spices , it tasted really rich in its flavour and it also had a very mouth watering smell . The pieces could have been bigger in size .
.
Zafrani firni was awesome . The authentic taste and that typical smell of firni was really good . It was not too sweet , which really hit the mark ,and was very good .
.
The bowl in which the 'Mouri and Michri' , along with the toothpicks were served looked like an antique showpiece . Definite eye catcher .
.
Overall it was a decent eating experience . The prices are also pocket friendly and well within the reach of any Middle Class Family . I would definitely recommend this place for a wholesome family meal . But if you are looking out for something fancy , then this restaurant is not for you .

Most embarrassing part that had to mix salt before serving to my guest. Please take care of these issues as hard earned money is being paid, that too not very cheap.

Firstly very bad hospitality and service. Secondly, I think the chef does not know the difference between mutton chap and mutton kasa. Ordered 4 mutton chaps, and got the most bogus mutton chap of all time which was nothing but kasa with pieces. Thirdly, ordered cheese kulcha and it return got tandori roti with shredded cheese on top. Disgusting. Fourthly, ordered cheese chicken kabab and in return got 4 small pieces of reshmi kabab with shredded cheese on top that amounts to 180. Fifthly, ordered firni but i am unaware of the item that I received in the name of firni. It was noting but a liquid rice custard, and last but not the least laccha paratha, uffff pathetic. The most faltoo restaurant of all time. Plz people avoid this place. They are a cheat and the chef should be hanged. Horrible experience...

Marufaz serves stale food .

Such bad food. Ordered rolls chicken cheese and chicken roll, on opening the packet only it smelled stale, tasted stale . Rs 168 was charged for the same, 0 worth for money. Food quality is an absolute 0.

Either start preparing good food or please shut down instead of cheating people.

After thinking about 1 year finally I ordered from this place...As I love Muglai foods ordered Mutton Biriyani & Zafrani firni for lunch.. 
First of all it took 2hours just to reach 2km hardly. Secondly : food  was not hot..
Third: Biriyani was cooked well , quantity was enough but not that much tasty which I got from other places.. no proper mixing of rice with all masala and aloo n Mutton.
Surely will try next time with some other items.

Nd masala kulcha is nice. All the food quantity nd quality was very good. Bt service was average. Coz the boy who serve us the dish can't serve properly. N we ask for tax percentage he gave me others bill to see the tax.. overall it's a good place to try indian dish.. i will definitely go this place next time 4 sure.

Here's the thing, I order from this place on a pretty frequent basis, and their food quality is excellent. I'd give them 5/5 for food. BUT. This rating is purely on their shabby service and delivery. You will literally never ever get your order on time, ever. I'm okay with upto a forty minute window from the estimated time, but, they manage to stretch that further. I ordered food today through Zomato at 12:30. The delivery boy calls me at 3 asking me for directions. The restaurant is a ten minute drive from my house. It shouldn't take them as long even if they went to the market to personally pick every single grain of rice for my biryani.¬†
As much as I want to praise their food, I'll ask whoever reads this to give this place a miss, because it's not worth testing your patience and losing your sanity over at the constant delayed service AND the complete non response at their end for accountability.

Marufaz is a trending name in Biriyanis of Kolkata.They used to serve variety of biriyanis.Located in Behala, Marufaz is a jackpot for the mughlai lovers.
In starter Chicken Reshmi kabab was just awesome,kababs were soft and juicy,lipsmacking.We have tried their Achari Chicken with Rumali Roti,Achari chicken was up to the mark and spicy.In main course one should try their Chicken tikka biriyani,delicious and divine.Mutton bamboo biriyani is highly recommended,it's scintillating,with a smoky flavour it's extremely delicious.In dessert you can try Zafrani firni.
Ambience is classy,management is good and easy to locate.Highly recommended place for Biriyani Lovers.

Wanted to visit this restaurant for a long time. Finally Me and my family visited there.This place is located opposite Ajanta Cinema Hall, just a few steps from the entrance to the S.N.Roy Road from the Diamond Harbour Road crossing.First we had the kababs ( Tandoori Chicken Full ) that were served smoking hot on a sizzling tray and( Chicken Cheese Kebab) Best Kebab I Had . Quite unique in the way they serve the kababs. Also the presentation was quite good. For the main course we ordered Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Kadhai Mutton.Though both the curries tasted very good,Firni Tasted quite good. A must try.
The food servings were good in quantity and also the quality was also good. Price is also quite reasonable. Must try the kababs and the Firni. Overall a good experience. I am surely coming back ..... :)

It has three pieces of chicken and a break from the regular biryani however it is slightly spicy and has green chills so people who do not like spicy food they  should not order it.

Conveniently located bang opposite to d Ajanta Cinema,Behala this eatery specializes in North Indian dishes. The sitting arena at d 1sr floor is quiet comfy and spread out. The interiors is soothing.
The Mutton Kacchhi biriyani is just out of the world with low oil and perfect mix of spices. As a result it won't make you sick even when consumed during hot, humid, sultry summer. Pocket pinch is perfectly commensurate with quality and quantity they offer.
Staffs are courteous, service is prompt.
Over all, Satisfied.

First of all, this review covers two separate home deliveries ordered by me. The first time, I ordered their Handi Mutton Biryani. Needless to say it was not quite what I expected. The rice itself was a bit bland, not to mention the bottom portions were burnt.¬†

This Wednesday we ordered Chicken Tikka ¬†Biryani and Moti Biryani. It was quite an improvement in terms of taste. the chicken was soft and the quantity adequate. Overall, I would recommend their Chicken Tikka Biryani to all who visit this place.

Lastly, in terms of price, seeing as they don't include potato and/or egg in most of the Biryani dishes, they should reduce the price a bit.

If you want to be famous I would request you to go and try some authentic North Indian dishes and then offer them to customers. However having said all these I believe you have one of the quickest delivery time... So thank you for that... But there is still huge scope of improvement...

Located opposite to Ajanta cinema hall this place makes amazing chicken tikka masala biriyani. I have not been but tried their home delivery services. I ordered one chicken tikka masala biriyani, 1 double mutton roll, 1 egg roll and a zafrani firni. I start with the better side of it at first. Delivered within time, the food was amazing specially firni and chicken tikka masala biriyani a must try.
Now the improvement part : They should have written mutton roll instead of double mutton roll, since the roll needed more meat fillings for being a double mutton roll.
And do take proper care for packaging please, as the firni spilled out.
Taste : 9/10
Service : 5 /10 ( for bad packaging of food)
Quantity: 8/10
Quality: 9/10
Price : 9/10
Though last not the least try the food its reasonable but think before ordering.

Ordered via Swiggy for my Sunday cheat-day lunch. Their Chicken Tikka Biriyani is very very good. Probably the best Biriyani in Behala and Behala now has an Arsalan and Aminia. Will order again.

This place is located opposite to Ajanta cinema. . Their chicken tikka biryani is delicious. The quality of take away foods are not upto the mark at all. Specially the rotis, be it tandoori or masala kulcha. ¬†Taste of the food was okay but cleanliness in terms of chicken pieces were not proper unfortunately.

Very bad behavior by restaurant. And im order 1 plate mutton rogan josh . And receive the order right time. Bt here is disaster. When im open the packet im shocked.. the mutton piece is very tinny. And its not mutton. Its only bones. So my friends do not order any food in marufaz. I am not order any food in future in this restaurant.

For the first time we have taken home delivery of Biriyani and Kebab. Taste of the food was okay but cleanliness in terms of chicken pieces were not proper unfortunately. Dont know about the dining experience as haven't been there. Not too oily. Overall neutral.

Being a Behala-ite I have grown up on Biriyani of Haji Saheb, but given the recent quality concern from Haji Saheb, Marufaz is doing a brilliant job.

If you are from Behala and a Biriyani lover, it is a crime not to eat at Marufaz (I am going superlative with just one time experience, it is that good.)

So I ordered through Zomato and thats why I will only talk about food.

Chicken Hariyali Kebab
Chicken Banjara Kebab
Fish Achari Tikka
The aforementioned Chicken Kebabs and the Fish Tikka were perfectly cooked, soft, slightly moist which doesn't make it completely dry - the reason I liked it more.

Chef's Special Biriyani (Chicken and Mutton both) - One leg piece for Chicken and Big Mutton Piece for the Mutton Biriyani, Egg and Potato. The Chicken and Mutton pieces were quite ok in size. The potato was perfectly cooked. The Biriyani had the aroma and the taste, yeah bit oily but you are having Biriyani after all.
Chicken Bharta - This was ok. Nothing much to highlight.
Zafrani Firni - The firni was also good.

Overall, A must try and looking forward to visit their outlet.

Ordered food through zomato, delivered before time so happy for that. Dal makhani, panner tikka masala, tandoori roti and egg biryani, Indian was good but not great and the big potato in biryani was bit undercook and biryani itself missing some biryani masala. And yes the delivery boy wasnt having change, i dnt know y delivery boy dsnt keep change. Please always come with the change nobody will go out for change when it comes to home delivery. M give 3stars deducting .5 for thr change issue.

Total bulshit. they will warm up probably 3 days old biriyani with a burnt piece of meat. Or will instantly cook biriyani on a pan. Today I sat here for half an hour for biryani and finally they came with a plateful of above mentioned shit. The amount of time they take to serve proves that there's some foul play. No proper biryani sellar won't t'ake so long. Peole had biryani in royal, Arsalan, Shiraz will never prefer such Biryani.

Okay, a very late review. We had ordered grub here on Diwali night via Zomato. I was at my best friend's place (Behala zone) and we wanted some good food, which wouldn't be too heavy on our tummies, to make our Diwali night awesome. 

So I searched up Zomato, and found this hidden gem. Frankly, Behala is totally surprising me for the last one month regarding their food scene. Brilliant, really!

The delivery was quite delayed, okay it was Diwali, so I forgive them, BUT THE FOOD!! ‚ù§

We had ordered really simple stuff around 6 lachhas and 2 plates of chicken tikka masala. Oh god. My mouth has started watering at the thought. 
The food was outstanding. And I mean it! The tikka masala tasted brilliant, the gravy, the aroma, the soft succulent pieces of chicken - it was sheer awesomeness on my plate. Each plate had 4 pieces of chicken. Thankfully, the pieces were quite good. 
Overall, the food scene was great and our Diwali night was made. 

Pocket pinch - I don't exactly remember, but it was around 300 bucks. Very cheap. 

I'm dying to visit their outlet so that I can try their other delicacies, especially the moti biryani. Much love.‚ù§

Just had a very bad experience with Marufaz guys! 

I ordered mutton briyani, and paneer butter masala.

I wanted delivery at 10pm. But, the delivery guy called me just after getting the order. I informed him that I had mentioned my delivery 

After 10, I called 4 times at an interval of say 20 minutes, and everytime the person on other side told that delivery boy is going to leave. At last, I got delivery at 11pm! An hour after I expected delivery.

The food arrived cold!!

The biryani was very cold and tasteless! Had no potato.
Paneer was hot and good.

Packaging was good.

Staffs were polite. 

For these reasons, am rating them 2/5.

Discovered this on Zomato when my aunt ordered it at her Sakherbazar house. Exquisite Biriyani Flavours, much better than Arsalan which I don't understand why people rave about. Kebab's were good quantity too. Perhaps more people outside Behala need to know about it. Should have a outlet in Kasba Gariahat stretch.

This restaurant has been in my bucket list for quiet some time.Located just opposite to Ajanta Cinema hall in the lane connecting Diamond Harbour Road to James Long. This is a speciality North Indian Restaurant.
Even the menu gives an impression of being Of Mughal or Awadhi decent, with the front type and the sub headers being on the right side of the menu.
Coming to the beverage - had Masala Cold drink and a Vergin Mogito.Both the beverages were served at a gap of 10 to 12 min, in between that, my wife had wait and watch. Though both the beverages were satisfactory to taste. I had ordered for Chicken Hariali kabab- which tasted just ok and was served on a sizzler plate.Nothing to rave about.
In main course, Masala kulcga and dal Makhani was ordered. Kulcha was good to taste though one piece was rather burnt on the edge and a little over done.Dal Makhani to me tasted more like Dal Tarka and was salty.Frankly it was a big spoiler.
They offer complementary papadom at the beginning of the meal, and a Pan shot made of Milk , ice cream and some flavoring agent at the end of the meal which was much required after having the salty Dal. Over all just an average experience.VAT & Service TAX are extra over the menu rates.

Location : Take the lane opposite to the Ajanta cinema hall and you ll find this joint on your left.
Ambience : Decent interior.Meaningless music going on.Service was as fast as that of a turtle's.Houseflies won't let you eat peacefully.Go figure out ! üòÖ
Food : 1.Chicken Moti Biryani : Full of boiled minced chicken balls and the rice has a minty taste.
2.Chicken tandoori butter masala : Really yum.
3.Chef Special Mutton Quorma : Perfectly cooked mutton pieces in a spicy gravy
4.Kadhai Chicken : Chicken was undercooked.The taste was pathetic.
5.Fresh lime soda (sweet) : Average
6.Chicken lasooni kebab : Dry & undercooked.
Overall - Pathetic staffs.
More pathetic service.
Certainly NOT going back.
P.S - My friend vomited thrice after having their food. 
Go at your own risk.

It's been 1 year since I am here in Kolkata...the only place where I found a good biryani aacording to my taste was marufuz... I along wid all my Mariner regular basis order CHICKEN TIKKA BIRYANI in bulk from this outlet...bt today the reaction of marufuz staff was very shocking to me... They refuses me to take away my order and wen they finally did I was shock to see the partiality they made btw us and normal Kolkata people... They rrefuses to give away gravy to us for the same order and widout any prblm they r delivering a very good amount of gravy to others...wen I asked they rudely replied me to manage me wid same.. I was not upset that they didnt gave me bt I was shock to c d partiality they perform wid rude gestures of them...

Behala is getting flooded with restaurants getting set up in populated and accessible locations and the residents can now cast aside their hindrance of having to travel a fair distance to cater to their fancy food craving.¬†
Marufaz is a North-Indian restaurant situated on the bang opposite lane to Ajanta Cinema which also offers catering services and facilitates takeaway. Although the place is moderately spacious and cozy, the pictures on Zomato had given me a different impression of the place. I wasn't too pleased with the shabby walls and old chairs that looked far from being maintained. The cleanliness of the place proved to be a bit of ¬†an issue. I went there for a late lunch with my brother and we were the only ones present in an otherwise deserted restaurant. In short, I wasn't too pleased with where I ate.

Now coming to what I ate.
This is the part that completely won my heart. It was a late lunch and I was terribly hungry that afternoon, so we quickly ordered tandoori rotis to go with Chicken Lababdar and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. We were delighted at the prospect of gorging on more owing to the wonderful taste of each preparation. The rotis were hot and on the softer side, exactly how I like it. The Tikka Masala was spicy and well marinated while the Lababdar had a tangy flavour which I loved. Good food can easily alter the unpleasant impression of something and that was eventually pivotal to my high rating of this place. We wrapped the meal up with well-prepared Firni. Marufaz is very reasonably priced with even a heavy lunch likely to cost below 600 for two people. It certainly offers better taste in food than other over-hyped eateries in Behala.

Byriani is different than usually prepared byriani a bit spicy. Kebeb was great specially the chicken Banjara kebab. But the Boti kebab was not good enough not at all recommended.

This place is situated in the Diamond Harbour Road and James Long connector opposite to the Ajanta Cinema Hall.One of the many newbies in Behala that have come up in the last couple of years.It is a two storeyed restaurant with the decor being pretty unadorned.The ground floor is primarily for takeaways and hence it is non-ac.There are a few tables in the ground floor as well.The first floor is the dine in area which is quite capacious.We had ordered Chicken Banjara Kebab,Butter Naan,Chicken Tikka Masala,Mutton Kachchi Biriyani,Plain Kulcha,Chicken Makhanwalay.
The Chicken Banjara Kebab was one of the best kebabs I have ever eaten.This place is becoming very famous for the variety of kebabs they serve.If you are a kebab lover then you must try this place.This dish is highly recommended.
The Butter Naan with Chicken Tikka Masala was a great order as they perfectly complemented with each other.I would like to thank the waiter for this combination as it was on his suggestion that we had ordered.The Chicken Tikka Masala was very spicy and had a good amount of gravy with it.The amount is such that it might be too much for one person to have it all.The Naan was nothing exceptional and was just as it is anywhere else.
The Mutton Kachchi Biriyani was good as it was full of flavours.I prefer a spicier version of Biriyani ¬†and hence I would not order it again if I visit this place in the future.But I am sure that people who do not prefer spicy items would dote on it as it is so well prepared.
The Plain Kulcha with Chicken Makhanwalay was a light dish.It is an appropriate dish for elderly people.The Kulcha again was nothing out of the world but the Chicken Makhanwalay was delicious.This order too was suggested by the waiter.
The quantity of food served is huge,so much so that it often becomes difficult to finish one dish for a single person.The waiters are really very well informed about the items and would give you good suggestions to make your experience better.They are very courteous and are always ready to help the customers.
The prices of the items are pocket friendly and the ambience is soothing.I would love to try this place again especially for their toothsome kebabs.

Marufaz serves Best Mughlai food in Behala. The place is situated just opposite of Ajanta Cinema Hall. Easy to find. Place is very big. They serves outdoor plus they have a very big and well devoted place in the first floor. Their speciality is in their kebabs. They serve kebab just like sizzler serve. One of the finest food quality with pocket friendly. Remember the name Marufaz.

I was really interested when I first came to know of this restaurant as it offers many different types of biryani. Finally we got a chance to try them. 
The restaurant is located at the road just opposite Ajanta cinema. It has a lower non AC and an upper AC section. 
I was really looking forward to having their Mutton moghlai Paratha but they discontinued it. We ordered Chicken moti biryani, Mutton moti biryani and chicken lababdar. 
Now the taste and smell of both the biryanis were awesome. It was rich in flavours. The Mutton motis were a special treat. They were made of minced Mutton and had a kabab like taste. The chicken moti could have been better as they were a little undercooked for my taste. 
Now the best part the chicken lababdar was a great surprise. The taste was sour and creamy and unlike any dishes I tasted before. The chicken pieces were properly cooked. 
The staff were very welcoming and helpful at every step. Overall we had an amazing dinner and I will recommend this place to all of the biryani lovers. Next time will surely go for the kabab and tandoor dishes.

The Butter Naan with Chicken Tikka Masala was a great order as they perfectly complemented with each other.I would like to thank the waiter for this combination as it was on his suggestion that we had ordered.The Chicken Tikka Masala was very spicy and had a good amount of gravy with it.The amount is such that it might be too much for one person to have it all.The Naan was nothing exceptional and was just as it is anywhere else.
The Mutton Kachchi Biriyani was good as it was full of flavours.I prefer a spicier version of Biriyani ¬†and hence I would not order it again if I visit this place in the future.But I am sure that people who do not prefer spicy items would dote on it as it is so well prepared.
The Plain Kulcha with Chicken Makhanwalay was a light dish.It is an appropriate dish for elderly people.The Kulcha again was nothing out of the world but the Chicken Makhanwalay was delicious.This order too was suggested by the waiter.
The quantity of food served is huge,so much so that it often becomes difficult to finish one dish for a single person.The waiters are really very well informed about the items and would give you good suggestions to make your experience better.They are very courteous and are always ready to help the customers.
The prices of the items are pocket friendly and the ambience is soothing.I would love to try this place again especially for their toothsome kebabs.

Marufaz serves Best Mughlai food in Behala. The place is situated just opposite of Ajanta Cinema Hall. Easy to find. Place is very big. They serves outdoor plus they have a very big and well devoted place in the first floor. Their speciality is in their kebabs. They serve kebab just like sizzler serve. One of the finest food quality with pocket friendly. Remember the name Marufaz.

Wanted to visit this place for long time and finally managed to get there. Beautiful interior, wonderful ambience and an awesome welcome drink already blended my likeliness towards this restaurant. Coming to the food.. Biriyani was really really special. Even the kabab items were well up to the mark and garnish was lovely. The service person was also very helpful. Food was moderately priced with the quality. Really nice place for family and friends. Would love to visit soon. :)

I was really interested when I first came to know of this restaurant as it offers many different types of biryani. Finally we got a chance to try them. 
The restaurant is located at the road just opposite Ajanta cinema. It has a lower non AC and an upper AC section. 
I was really looking forward to having their Mutton moghlai Paratha but they discontinued it. We ordered Chicken moti biryani, Mutton moti biryani and chicken lababdar. 
Now the taste and smell of both the biryanis were awesome. It was rich in flavours. The Mutton motis were a special treat. They were made of minced Mutton and had a kabab like taste. The chicken moti could have been better as they were a little undercooked for my taste. 
Now the best part the chicken lababdar was a great surprise. The taste was sour and creamy and unlike any dishes I tasted before. The chicken pieces were properly cooked. 
The staff were very welcoming and helpful at every step. Overall we had an amazing dinner and I will recommend this place to all of the biryani lovers. Next time will surely go for the kabab and tandoor dishes.

When Marufaz opened up in behala,I could not wait to try out Mughlai khana from here.On my first visit,which was at about 5:30 pm on a Friday, I was compelled to order Roomali roti and Chicken Bharta...since at that hour tandoor was unavailable.(pretty much a disappointing first impression).. Infact most of the other dishes were.The Bharta was a little too sweet than it usually is supposed to be,it wasn't as overwhelming as I expected it would be..having read such raving reviews about it.
Last night,however,bored of ghar ka khana I decided to order Shahi Mughlai Paratha,with its mutton and chicken customizations..as I had read it was one of the gems to try from this outlet.I ordered at around 8:45 pm and was assured delivery by 9:40pm.When the clock struck 9:30,i had still not heard from the delivery person...I called up the eatery and was asked for a further 25 mins to prepare my order..I agreed and patiently waited..unfortunately even at 10:10 there was no sign of my order...repeated phone calls to the eatery gave me the impression that my food would be there any minute..but nothing of that sort happened.As i was about to cancel my order,zomato staff requested me not to,and to wait for a few more minutes,and finally my food did arrive.Being Vishwakarma puja as well as a weekend night,I excused the delay,and began gorging into the food right away..
But there was disappointment waiting here as well...The beautiful potato gravy preparation sent as an accompaniment with the mughlai,had semi uncooked pieces of potato..despite the thick gravy being absolutely delicious...
Coming to the parathas,worse was in store...the mutton mughlai had layers of raw maida dough...so raw,it could be kneaded...the surfaces were fried properly but the underlying layers were alarmingly raw..The chicken mughlai too had the same issue,but on a lesser degree...
I understand the delay due to the rush,but when the money spent yields disastrous results...its simply disheartening..

I was aware of this restaurant opposite Ajanta Cinema but had never visited it. Finally had the opportunity last Sunday and ordered home delivery. They have a great option of combo meals for lunch.We ordered Combo Meal II and III . Really good stuff in the combo meals--- rice , chapati, .... the dals were very good. Chicken Labradar and the Gulab jamuns were good.
We also ordered one Handi Biryani- Chicken , one normal chicken biryani and Fish Tandoori. Although the Handi biryani was mentioned as portion for 2, it was enormous. It took me , my brother and my sister-in-law to complete the entire handi. Enormous portion with good chicken pieces and also full of meat balls.The fish tandoori was also good. Great value for money--- then entire stuff cost only Rs.800( 15% off from Zomato since it was our first order online) and the food was sufficient for 3 adults and 1 kid for lunch and dinner.. Too good.....

A well-known name, when it comes to Biryani at Kolkata, Marufaz is celebrating Jashn E Biryani, a one of a unique festival, for the second straight year, to introduce variety of Biryani to savor the tastebuds of their patrons. Known for the authentic taste, quantity and aboveall for the impeccable quality, if the first year of this festival wasn‚Äôt enough to tickle your senses, the second consecutive year has promised to bring in even more flavors and varieties. Located at Behala, this is an easy place to find.
            

Authentic Mughlai cuisine, which is derived from Persian-influenced food served in the imperial kitchens of the Mughal Empire which was traditionally centered in the north Indian cities of Delhi and Hyderabad has now become an important staple of the Bengali diet in Kolkata. The recent dishes, which have been introduced here are Kachhi Biryani, Tikka Biryani, Mutton Biryani, Machli (fish) Biryani, Prawn Biryani, Moti Biryani. For vegetarians, there are  Echorer (Jack Fruit) Biryani and Soyabean Biryani...

Marufaz has been on my wishlist for a long time.Finally I got the chance of tasting their food yesterday when I ordered from here via Zomato. This review is solely based on the food delivered by Marufaz. I ordered one Egg roll, one Chicken Cheese Roll and one Zafrani firni. Though the initial delivery time was estimated to be one hour, the food was delivered within forty five minutes. The food was still warm when it arrived. Coming to the food, the Egg roll was delicious. The paratha was well cooked and the fried onions inside made it  delicious. The Chicken Cheese roll was heavenly. The chicken pieces were juicy and tender and the cheese went really well with the crisp paratha and the chicken. Lastly, the Zafrani Firni concluded our meal. The aroma had a hint of kesar and the heavenly taste satisfied our taste buds. All in all, great food and I will visit their outlet soon.

Who doesn‚Äôt love biryani? The count is rare. The other vast majority actually does crave for a plate of biryani. But in Kolkata it is very hard to find anything other than the same chicken and mutton biryani. Bored with the same flavours, biryani lovers are always enthusiastic of trying something different. For such people, the wait is over as Marufaz has come up with their ‚ÄòJashn-E-Biryani‚Äô festival introducing ten different types of biryanis which are absolutely new to our palette.
                                                                ...

Biryani hardly needs any introduction to the foodies of Kolkata. Every time you think of Biryani , you think about some of the legendary restaurants who have been serving the same for decades now. However Kolkata is not only about the Kolkata style biryani with that lovely potato in it. The change in taste of the regular restaurant-goer has led to the introduction of Biryanis from various sub-cuisines of India, both in the old & new restaurants. Marufaz is one such entree in the list of comparatively new Mughlai eateries which have managed to leave a mark in the minds of Mughlai food lovers.

Ok. So I've been here a few times. Almost all of them were very late¬†dinners while returning from work as I was then living alone in my Behala flat and¬†this used to be¬†pleasantly open around 11sh.The¬†fact that this was close by¬†in Behala and referred by a fellow foodie as a¬†brave new Biryani joint¬†had made me¬†curious anyways. The first time I ordered for a Kachchi Biryani (only place other than homely India, Kidderpore that I've had it yet) and¬†I must admit that though it was very different to what India serves, this actually was¬†a very good biryani. Almost like Hyderabadi in its texture and feel (with the herbs etc), the Biryani had a distinct flavor, texture and character. I think we should welcome it warmly¬†as an exciting addition to the city's platter.¬†Then¬†on¬†my next visit¬†I had the regular Calcutta Biryani and this was...well just a regular Biryani if you know what I mean. But then it was also 11:30 PM and I think it'll be too much to expect anything more at that hour. At least it was not pretentious. Oh and I also ordered for a Rezala and which was up there pretty much with a sufficiently fine mutton piece and the gravy was also done well. Apart from this must add that they seem to have an exciting menu and I'm now looking forward to explore it as days go by. Not bad is how I'll sum it up. Let us see how they sustain this now.

Okay so this place has always attracted me. Finally went to this place a few days back. Order their combo 3 and combo 4. Combo 3 had 2 paratha, rice, dal makhni, chicken curry and firni. Combo 4 has biryani, chicken curry and firni. They mistakenly gave biryani instead of rice and the best part it they didn't even charge extra. The food was awesome. It was just so fulfilling. The decor I simple but the sofas are comfortable to sit in. The staffs were friendly. Will be going back for their combo.

ok, I am a biryani man, so lets settle this, I have done my share of adventures on this divine dish. I have tried from the highest pinnacles of arsalan (park circus) to the dungeons of foot path stalls, so by this time I know how to reconcile with a poor biryani choice I have already done. with this confidence and mental buffer I tried this restaurant's biryani and chicken tikka kebabs for once. I had to use the phrase 'tried' because that's only valid for the first chance you get to do something you haven't done before. so, the next time when I ordered I willfully did it, and would recommend it too to my fellow good people. cheap quantity wise and satisfactory quality wise.
marufaz, keep up your good work.

This place is located opposite Ajanta Cinema Hall, just a few steps from the entrance to the S.N.Roy Road from the Diamond Harbour Road crossing. I had heard a lot about the place from reviews on Zomato, and hence finally decided to give it a visit. I had ordered takeaway and hence didn't get a good look inside the place, since I was sitting downstairs to collect my parcel whereas dine in is on the first floor. Still what I could figure the place looks nice with good ambience and the staffs are very courteous and helpful.

Now coming to the food we had ordered Mutton Biriyani, Fish Tandoori, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Sahi Mughlai Paratha (Mutton). The Mutton Biriyani was delicious, it was not oily as is the case with certain other restaurants also the mutton portion was good and extremely tender. The Fish Tandoori came with four decent sized pieces. The taste was mindblowing , and the pieces were very soft and fresh. Now the Reshmi Chicken Butter Masala was recommended by the staffs when I asked them about any non veg dishes that they had which was served in white gravy. This is apparently the only one, and it comes with four pieces of decent sized chicken. The chicken was very soft and had a really nice aroma, the gravy was not spicy or oily and was just perfect and tasted great with the Biriyani. Finally coming to the Sahi Mughlai Paratha (Mutton), this was the icing on the cake, arguably the best dish we had ordered and definitely the best Mughlai Paratha I have had in my life. The Paratha had huge chunks of mutton filled inside it and the curry that they had given, which was mostly potato tasted great as well, although we could have had the Paratha just by itself, without any sides because of the enormous amounts of mutton inside it.

All in all it was a very satisfying experience. Its nice to see new places coming up in Behala. As someone who lives here, it gives me an opportunity to try various foods also with plenty of options to choose from. As in the case of North Indian cuisines, previously there was only Haji Saheb that served good food here in Behala, but now we not only have Marufaz but also other places like Jafran and Aminia, who have decided to open their new branch here in Behala.

As for Marufaz, please do decide to give it a try since all the items that I tried were great, and if not for anything else, at least for their Sahi Mughlai Paratha, since very few places still make them, and none makes them as good as this place, at least in Behala.

The seating area was nice and I also liked the ambience and decoration of this place. We ordered Chelo Kebab Platter and Special Mutton Biriyani. Kebabs were delicious and succulent and there were 10 pieces of Kebab in total. Biriyani was aslo good but was bit dry. Overall it was a nice experience.....

This restaurant is located in the bye - lane just opposite to Ajanta cinema at behala.

The place is quite spacious and adequate. It had a simple decor with classic Bollywood posters hanging on the walls .The staff was well behaved and courteous. The seating arrangements and the table were pretty neat and clean, though the floor looked a bit untidy to me. More importance should be given on cleanliness.

Now the main part : FOOD.

#starters

First we had the kababs that were served smoking hot on a  sizzling tray. Quite unique in the way they serve the kababs. Also the presentation was quite good. 

Also we were served with roasted papad as complimentary dish.

Chicken Pudina kabab : Had the perfect blend of Pudina and the smoky tandoor flavour. Tasted good.

Tandoori Fish kabab : This made my day. Tasted absolutely amazing. Perfectly made. The kabab just melted in. Tasted great and a must try.

#maincourse

For the main course we ordered Mutton Kassa and Chicken Makhanwala accompanied with Masala kulcha.

Mutton Kassa : Served hot. The mutton was quite good but nothing great though. Tasted average.

Chicken Makhanwala : Served hot and goes totally with the name. Thick red gravy with a buttery flavour. Tasted good.

Masala Kulcha : Brilliant make. The bread was perfect. Neither too thick nor too thin. Tasted good.

#deserts

Firni : Tasted quite good. A must try.

The food servings were good in quantity and also the quality was also good. Price is also quite reasonable. Must try the kababs and the Firni.

Overall a good experience.

I am surely coming back next to try the biryanis.

The review is based on a home delivery by swiggy. We had ordered butter naan, boneless chicken makhanwala and the chef's special chicken. The makhanwala had four succulent pieces of boneless kabab in a tasty gravy. The chef's special had two leg pieces or tangdi kabab in a spicy gravy with lots of coriander. Though both the curries tasted very good, I thought the basic gravy was the same and that the chef had added a little  bit of this and that to give it variety, which to me was not very pronounced. Overall great food at great prices. Will surely try again.

I am writing this review after doing multiple takeaway from Marufaz the Biriyani in one word is simply awesome, they have the widest variety of Biryani even loved their makhanwalay best part the pocket pinch is also not much so one can get good food at reasonable prices after coming to India this is one of my favourite places will miss it badly in USA keep up the good work Team Marufaz highly recommended to everybody only one suggestion please have more branches so it becomes easier for the Biryani loving  customers like me

This is a pocket friendly priced restaurant kebabs are awesome, juicy and learnt from them that they do not use any artificial flavors or colour. If its true then really a joint to watch out for. Curries are ok and kulcha is average but kulfi is brilliant never had in Behala area before.

Tried their Handi Biryani a little different from others, perhaps the only place with so many variety of Biryanis, really light and refreshing, couldn't try the curries as i was full will definitely try next time. Service was okay and prompt. The decor is soothing only the light can be deemed for a better ambiance.

The restaurant is located, just in the opposite road of ajanta cinema hall. It serves one of the best biryanis in this area. Kebabs are also good. Staffs are also polite and really kind. They gave us a 10% discount as we received  defected chicken pieces in the biryani handi. They repalced our biryani too. The masala coke was also tasty. Overall a good experience. But I want to have a tasty and well cooked chicken biryani  without replacements next time.

Ordered home delivery from this place.  The Mutton cheers roll was pretty good in terms of taste and it was fulling as well.  Chicken biriyani was filling.  But it's a touch in the expensive side,  good Ben what other biriyani specialists in the area charge for their biriyanis .

Went there for dinner for my parents 23rd anniversary. Hats off to their staff behaviour, the way helped us in parking our car. Then we went to their 1st floor which is basically their AC section. It was pretty much chilled and ambiance was also very good specially their wall designs. We ordered Mutton Biriyani, Chef Spl Mutton Biriyani, Hyderabadi Chicken Kebab, Mutton Korma and Lancha Parantha. We didn't had to wait much they soon came with the Kebab's and then the Biriyani for which again hats off to their service. Now coming to the food, Kebab was very good, Biriyanis was amazing and looked different and the quantity was a lot even the Lancha Paratha was good. The disappointing was Mutton Korma which changes my overall rating from 4 to 3.5.

One of the new & popular places in Behala, the Mughlai food here is one to cherish. I loved the hyderabadi biryani and have it like a dozen times. The chicken is so soft n juicy that u just don't want the Biryani to finish! I am a bit skeptical about the chinese as i haven't got much good reviews about that, but yeah the north indian food is delicious. I happen to frequent this place and the service n staff are prompt n friendly.

Located on the road connecting Diamond Harbour Road and James Long bypass opposite to Ajanta cinema hall, Marufaz is one of the underrated and unperceived restaurant of Behala serving fine biriyani. Mostly undermined by renowned competitors like Arsalan, Haji Sahed this place has gained lesser attention despite its finest servings. Chef's Special Biriyani may well face of Arsalan's counterpart served with 2 pieces of mutton, an egg and potato. The biriyani being exceptionally light and aromatic. If one cares for an adventurous venture one may tryout the Kachchi Biriyani. It offers a piece of pre marinated(12 hours) mutton piece in spices no potato or egg. It's more of a kind like a Hydrabadi style biriyani which comes with its own twist of pungency from mustard. It may not be welcoming at first but eventually you will get used to it and blends to be a wonderful outcome. It first hits you with the heat from the spices eventually finishing of with a sweet-sour aftertaste from the 'aloopokhra'(personally it's one of the most essential ingredients to a perfect Biriyani). Nextup was the Tandoori Murgh served in a sizzler platter, all sizzling and hot. Wonderful smoky flavours and the beautiful tender meat served with grilled onions will surely liveup to your expectations. Overall it was a fine experience with helpful staffs at your disposal.

Saw this restaurant listed in the biriyani collection and decided to give it a try. It is very easy to locate. It is just opposite Ajanta cinema beside new punjabi hotel. On seeing it from the outside it looks like some roadside dhaba but on entering I wa really surprised. There is a non AC sitting arrangement on the ground floor and an AC sitting on the first floor. It was empty when me and a friend got there so we got to choose our table. The interior is well decorated with humorous filmy dialogues and posters. The sofas were quite comfortable but for me the lighting was a tad bit bright and also music was missing. We ordered Reshmi kebab for starters. It had 6 pieces and the sizes were pretty good. The gravy that came with the kebabs were delicious (they served papads with kebab which was a first for me). The chicken were properly cooked and was really soft. We ordered mutton biriyani for the main course and mutton lababdaar to go along with it. Biriyani was perfect as far as taste is concerned but was a bit too spicy for me. I could actually taste the cardamom and cloves in it. Mutton lababdaar was just great. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Just loved it.
It is a great place for a pocket friendly meal and had a great experience. Will definitely visit again and try the other dishes.

Visited again to try out some more.

Seekh Kabab - I was very dissapointed with this dish. It was very very dry and had no taste as such. So a big shout out to everybody don't try this.

Chicken Bharta- It was really really delicious. I loved the taste and the texture. A great side dish to team up with biriyani or tandoori roti

The food is quite good but occasionally the amount of oil is on the higher side. I have tried this restaurant several times but yesterday the Chicken Biriyani was too much oily. Although the Mutton Biriyani was fine like before. Don't know the exact reason for such problems. 
Otherwise this place deserves a 4 star and definitely my recommendation.

I have been to this outlet before & had their kachhi biryani, which I didn't find exceptional, & service a tad bit slow.
However looking for a restaurant which would deliver to my place, came across this one again. Also they were having this promotion of 20% discount on online payment, this couldn't possible be missed. Fired up the Zomato app & ordered the following items:

1. Veg Pulao:
Ample amount of rice for one person with chunks of cottage cheese, carrots & peas. However could have been a bit sweeter.

2. Handi Biryani:
At 350 rs this at first seemed a bit over priced to order for two persons. But trust me the amount of rice they put in the clay pot can easily feed four. The no. Of chicken pieces are only two though, so should have ordered a side dish to go with it. Chicken pieces were soft, rice flavourful & the potato well cooked. However the chicken moti kebabs present along were not upto the mark & could have been much much tastier.

3. Boondi & mixed Raita:
Although the quantity was much much more than expected for the price of rs 35, however quality was not upto the mark. Boondi one could have done with a bit more spices. While the mixed one had far too less veggies overall.

4. Firni:
This one has to be the best firni available in behala. Surely. Soft creamy & definitely value for money when you get it for rs 35! Surely will order this again!

All in all a mixed experience. Definitely value for money meal. However the Raita spoiled the show.Delivery time was fine, considering the outlet is located nearly 5kms from my home.
Will surely order from them again,
Till then,
Happy eating,
Cheers!

I've been to the restaurant twice and I must say, the Tandooris here are absolutely delectable. The location of this outlet is very easy to find- the lane exactly opposite to Ajanta cinema, walk for a few seconds and it falls on the left.
Coming to the food, it's delicious- From the stuffed kulche to chicken and paneer preparations, to the mixed veg. Special mention to the kebabs, good quality and quantity, and yet easy on the pocket. On both the occasions it didn't exceed 800 for 3 people, including beverages. The only problem is that service is a bit slow, maybe because they prepare the food instantly (given it's always so hot).

Earlier I ordered Tandoori Chicken from Marufaz via swiggy.They were pretty good..smoky flavour and chicken pieces were tender and not at all oversmoked.But I decided to review it after I try few more dishes from this restaurant.
I ordered from Marufaz on my birthday few days back via zomato for dinner since delivery executives were busy in swiggy.The orders chicken haryali kabab,chicken tikka masala and rara mutton.
Didn't order biriyani since my mother made my favourite dish at home only and for me it's the best. :)

Orders arrived 15mins later the scheduled time.But the drool worthy food made up for it..

Chicken haryali kebab-They were spicy,tender and smoky pieces chicken kebabs which were flavoured with pudina and green chilli.I loved it.The green chutney provided with the kebabs was good too.

Chicken tikka masala-This was another fantastic dish.4 big pieces of boneless tender chicken tossed in spicy tangy gravy topped with butter.It was the best chicken tikka masala I ever had.Even my mother was trying to figure out what they used in the gravy so that she could make it at home.

Rara mutton-This was kind of okayish.It was good nonetheless but not top notch as the other two dishes.Gravy was nice in taste but the mutton pieces were a bit stiff.

Pricing was very reasonable.It's a good option for mughlai cuisine at a pocket friendly rate.Looking forward to dining-in experience some day at the restaurant.

Location is not that great as we had to follow up the Google Maps very closely to find the way to it. Decor is nice, staffs are courteous too. Hygiene is something that the management must look into and give it a topmost priority as a lot of construction work goes on around the locality and I even found the plates on the table had bits of dust on it. Must keep the washrooms clean and tidy too. Food was tasty specially the Chicken Lasooni Kebab. The chicken pieces were succulent and well marinated. Masala Kulcha was equally good too and not to forget about the Firni. Have heard that they serve palatable Chicken Biriyani. Will love to try it once.

Latest mughlai/biriyani sensation of behala area....tried it out by home delivery during my last trip. Undoubtedly the mutton biriyani was top quality. The mutton mughlai paratha was also loaded with mince meat, which is an increasing rarity these days. The mutton rejala was very disappointing as it was way too sweet. Overall a good experience as the online order (placed via zomato) was also delivered in time.

Located in the opposite side of Ajanta Cinema and just beside Punjabi Dhaba this place is serving good quality food in very reasonable price. The place is not very big but its spacious. The decor is quite simple with classic Bollywood posters hanging with some witty changes. I loved the style. The green and white colour combination was going well. The staffs were well behaved and attentive. Talking about the food we took these:
=| Chef's Spcl Mutton Biryani : The taste and aroma was ecstatic and it really oozed my taste bud.

=| Butter Naan : Soft and buttery. Nice.

=| Chicken Lababdar : I liked the thick gravy. The taste was sweet and soury and was pretty good.

=| Raita : Could have been better. The proportion of water was far more than what should have been given. Needs improvement.

=| Firni : Nice. Nothing more to describe.

I had also tried Egg Chicken Roll, and it was good. Good amount of chicken chunks with salad and sauce.

Last words:
Nice place to visit if you are looking to have some Indian stuffs in a low budget. This place would definitely serve your requirements.

4/5 overall.

Just opposite to ajanta cinema hall, behala.. the restaurant has space for family dining on its 1st floor.. decor is good.. wait staffs r well mannered n hospitable.. but when it comes to the food.. its nothing extraordinary..! the A.C.s are too small to cool a room of that size.. 

We ordered keema naan, cheese naan, masala kulcha, butter naan, chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken tikka butter masala, chicken bharta, mutton biryani, mixed raita and lassi.. they also give complimentary papads with every order.. just ask them to give it along with d order n not beforehand..

*size of naans were too small (like phulka).. even the person who eats d least would require min 2 of it..!! D masala kulcha was really good..! The other breads were again very average.. 
*the much hyped Biryani was actually very average and tasted only of fried onions..! Potatoes were not moist at all (a big issue for ME)..!
*reshmi butter masala & bharta tasted average.. howevr the tikka masala was good..!!
*lassi was served at room temp. !!! Tasted bad..

Marufaz...the name takes you to the land of bedouins and desserts and camels...so is the font style in menu write up, glows signs etc....an indian cuisine restaurant situated very conviniently near ajanta cinema, behala.....just on the lanes of the alley opposite to the movie hall....have been planning to visit for some time and my opportunity came last night....being a monday late evening, it was pretty empty though by the gangs of swiggy delivery boys at ground floor, i understood that a lot of food is getting home delivered....

Decor is clean, nice leather seats, enough space on the tables, good cutlery sets....wall framed with old movie quotes, could have been better to match the name and give a better feel to the ambience.....a lot can be done....

coming to the food and we kept it simple....chelo kebab, keema naan, achari murgh....thats it.....boy oh boy.......the food was finger licking good....the chelo platter was full of kebabs....chicken tikka, malai tikka, fish tikka and seekh kebabs....fried egg, butter rice and salad....the only blemish is that the seekh kebabs were dry, for sure they were not fresh and it dried up....the keema naan was delicious, not a lot of keema but i dont expect that at INR 25 and it tasted excellent....the best was the achari murg....u can really taste the pickled gravy and big chunks of chicken......we ended with a sweet lassi.....

improvement areas....again the intent is not to be critical but help to shine better....no lemons were served and pudina chutney was served when asked....these should always come promptly when eating indian food.....the water served was room temperature and so was the lassi.....has to be colder in this heat, goes without saying....otherwise i think the food was really good to be ordered again and again....

the other commendable part is the pricing in respect to portion....full marks over there.....team MARUFAZ....great job....please left up the ambience a bit more if possible, there is enough space.....it looked very basic that i will get in other normal Indian restaurants.....people should not only talk about great food but also about the classic ambience which comes for free....all the BEST

It was an order for home delivery through zomato. Handi biriyani (2 portions) and Chicken Achari.... it was. To be frank, the home delivery was pretty late and disappointing. Repeated phone calls had to be made. After a delay of of almost 1.5 hrs finally food arrived. Biriyani was too good. Although we ordered for 2 portions only, but even 3 of us couldn't finish it. Chicken Acahari, though a bit spicy n oily, complemented the biriyani pretty well. Good food; but they need to improve on their home delivery system.

Quite a bit unusual for your typical muglai restaurant. The curry based dishes and the rotis have a marufaz style to it, slightly different from what we are use to. Different in a good way i must say. The biriyani is light and has good taste. Only the kebab lacks a bit of juice in them.
The decor of the place is really nice.
Now to the coming to cons, service isn't very prompt, the waiters address us a long time after we sat on our table. The food took its own sweet time to arrive. But the biggest issue i had is they won't let us cut a birthday cake, why would you do that. Later they redeemed it by saying we could.
Marufaz wake up it isn't 1970's anymore, birthdays are celebrated at restaurants nowadays.
Its good restaurant with good food. Recommended place.

This is located on the lane opposite to Ajanta Cinema, Behala. The food always been delivered late as compare to the estimated delivery time.

You can Never expect such good quality Mughlai food at such reasonable price!! I told my friends about this restaurant she told me not to take that risk to have dinner in marufaz. But after our dinner everyone thanked me :) and our 2nd nightout of this month also followed with Marufaz.

We had Butter Nun - which I dont like due to its thinness (Not at all recommended),
Chicken do pyaza, Chicken Tandoori (Full) - Tasted good. It was accompanied with the salad and chutney. The taste of the chutney does have a lot of scope of improvement. The Tandoori had just the right amount of oil required to roast it up. It was succulent. Chicken Tangdi Kabab (Half) - the way they prepared the dish,its taste Awesome,So soft and juicy ..definitely you should try it,
Chicken lababdar & Chicken Tikka Masala - Both the chicken gravies had four big boneless pieces and a lot of gravy.The
tikka masala was a bit tangy and rich,while the lababdar was on the sweeter side.Both tasted excellent.

I wont recommend anyone to take any mutton dish from here, It wont satisfy you. Hope they take special concentration while preparing their mutton dishes.

Keep up the great taste, work on the improvement areas. Will Soon taste few more dishes.

Marufaz - A mixed experience.
=====
Intro + Location: I got the food from Marufaz delivered through swiggy. This is located on the lane opposite to Ajanta Cinema, Behala. The food got delivered quite in time.
=====
What i ordered:-

‚Ä¢ Chicken Tandoori (Half) - There were four pieces of chicken. Two small and two good portion size. Tasted good. It was accompanied with the salad and chutney. The taste of the chutney does have a lot of scope of improvement. The Tandoori had just the right amount of oil required to roast it up. It was succulent. Recommended. It was also sealed in airtight container. So kudos to good packaging. ‚úå ‚úå¬†

‚Ä¢ Chicken Biryani - The biryani was nicely packed. It had a large piece of chicken and aloo. The chicken piece was tender and juicy as expected but the marination could have been more better if the masala's seeped in properly. Nevertheless, What i didn't like about the biryani was that they added up a small mutton piece in my chicken biryani. I mean, this was not expected. So, i will deduct 0.5 point for that. The rice had a lot of added flavor separately which i didn't personally like.
=====
Meal for two: These two came to me at 295 all inclusive. So, 250-500.
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 3.8/5
Food Quantity 3.8/5
Food Taste 3.8/5
Food Packaging 3.9/5
Value for money 3.8/5
(0.5 Deducted for adding mutton piece in chicken biryani. It maybe that it is cooked together.) (Picture have been attached for the same)¬†
=====
Conclusion: Nevertheless, with respect to packaging, it seemed a good place to dine in as it was really good. Let's see if i get to try it in future.
=====
Unbiased review based on my eating experience.

had again ordered via zomato - chicken biriyani and firni. costed me near about within 200 bucks. this time food was really good. the firni was also nice.

When my told my brother about this restaurant he told me not to take that risk to have dinner in marufaz.But after our dinner he thanked me and promised me to taste all the dishes there....that is marufaz...
We had
1.hariyali kabab(they gave a different name which I forgot)the way they served the dish,its taste,quantity all are awesome,definitely you should try it
2.chef's special chicken biriyani-2 huge pieces of chicken,egg,aloo were served,rice is enough for two of us.I specially want to mention that biriyani was full with aloo bokhras which I liked the most
3.chicken makhanwala-standard chicken dish,nothing special
4.cheese nun which is good
5.lassi which is also good.
Staffs are well behaved.
But I want to mention 1 thing,after giving order at 8:30 around they served us the food at 9:00pm.that to starters and main course together.For that reason I have deducted 0.5.
Pocket pinch around 780

This was our first dining experience at the much talked about Marufaz.We opted for an online home delivery which was pretty smooth and on time.Now coming to the food - Chicken Tengri Kabab was just awesome.The best we had tasted so far.So soft and juicy . Chef Special Mutton Biryani was very good in terms of the taste and aroma.However the mutton pieces turned out to be quite hard.This need to be looked at in future.Overall we were pretty happy to find a quality Mughlai joint in Behala.Keep up the great taste, work on the improvement areas and you will certainly earn 5 stars everytime.

We were in a mood to have some Mughlai/ North Indian food and decided to try some new place.Too tired to venture out.Swiggy came to our rescue.Our order was 2egg biryanis,1 chicken sheek kebab,1 chikken tikka masala and 1 Chicken lababdar.

Delivery was prompt as always by swiggy.packaging was good.

The biryani had 2 eggs and a potato each. It was light and aromatic,not too greasy. we liked it. Quantitywise,2 plates would be sufficient for three average eaters.

the sheek kebabs were good,not great.they tasted like the frozen kebabs we get in supermarkets.

Both the chicken gravies had four big boneless pieces and a lot of gravy.The tikka masala was a bit tangy and rich,while the lababdar was on the sweeter side.Both tasted excellent.The lababdar is very similar in taste to the eponymous dish they serve at Bedouin Sher e Bengal at Gariahat.

Our total bill was Rs.630/- for all these dishes which is quite economical.We will try other dishes soon

Biryani Festival at Marufaz ‚Äì Daawat e Mughlai

If you like proper-spiced and extremely generous portions of rice and meat, then Marufaz will hit the spot with its heady biryanis. They cook their chicken, fish and mutton briyani's traditionally in dum style, which flavours the rice immensely. Flavorful but superbly balanced biryanis that you can‚Äôt resist eating, dunked in glorious Lucknowi Biryani, or Hydrabadi Biryani if you prefer. This will satisfy any Biryani craving you have and then finish off with a nice glass of Burhani!

Chicken tikka biriyani. ..#love
Awesome taste..
4 pieces of chicken(kebabs) of good size & awesome taste...
Surprisingly awesome & good addition to Behala's biryani menu..@
RECENT VISIT AND CHANGE OF REVIEW
Taste has degraded like anything.. they don't serve that awesome quality anymore.. it has become just a local restaurant with no such hifi expectations.
Severely degraded from its past heavenly taste..
EDIT ONCE AGAIN..
After repeated information to the MGT. Finally the taste is almost back like the old royal taste.. so visit them before it changes again..

Easterday we visited Marufaz and ordered Mutton Moti Biryani, Chicken Khurchan, Chicken Banzara kb, Chicken Lehsuni kb, Prawn Masala, Chicken Tkka Biryani and Firni All the items were briliant and i must say they have maintained their standard since their inception. I am a regular to this place . Their Kebabs and Biryanis are top of the world compared to the price they are offering along with a courteous and elegant service. We wish them all the best again for their future. Firni was one the most saleable¬† items in their menu . You must try it.

A nicely decorated cozy place at a convenient location. It was my bday and initially they refused to let me distribute cakes to my friends and that was quite rude. But after a while they apologized and let us have the cake. About the food, all the items tasted kinda different than the mughlai foods we have normally. The biryani had two pieces of chicken. Bharta,kabab,tikka masala,lachha paratha-everything was unique in a good way. Price and quantity is decent. Service was prompt.

It looked swanky and beautiful. Good ambiance but when it comes to food all falls flat. 
This place is newly built. Very clean and well maintained. The waiters are slow and the food comes to the table very late. Even if it gives a tough competition to the nearby Haji in terms of ambiance the food is not at all good. 
The mutton Biryani that we ordered was salty and the rice was not well cooked. The mutton was also not well spiced and well cooked. 
All in all its a nice looking place but with very below average food.

Opposite of Ajanta Cinema.
Very neat decor.
Staffs are courteous.
Chicken/mutton special biryani is excellent (@185 with two pieces of chicken/mutton)
Chicken butter masala is heaven.
Chicken cheese kebab is juicy as well.
Chicken Makkhanwala gravy is a bit bland.
Overall a must try place for those who want to taste really good Mughlai delicacies at a very good price üëç

Visited this joint few days back with my friends. It is located opposite ajanta cinema hall few blocks away from the crossing.The place is very nice with good ambience and beautiful wall decor. Coming to the food we ordered chicken banjara kebab, chef's special mutton biriyani and chicken makhanwala. The Kebab tasted very good. Biriyani was less oily and spicy. At last we ordered fresh lime soda which was also very nice. The quality and quantity both were good with reasonable price. The service was quick and the staffs were well mannered. Hope this joint will improve further and go a long way. All the best to team marufaz.

REVIEW NO. 150....
LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Marufaz is located just where you can't see it properly. Its opposite of Ajantha Cinema at Behala. What you need to know about them first is that they are tremendous in making some very fine Starters in forms of Kebabs. Basically an Indian restaurant with some good amount of variety dishes for you. Went there for a Kebab fest being organised for the Valentines week from Marufaz itself.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: Not a very amazing or huge place i would say. It has two sittings one in the ground floor and another upstairs with some good dinning space. Full A.c with well painted walls, Photo frames hanged all around the walls representing a name of a Bollywood movie. Place was neat and clean. Service is fair but not so prompt. A bit of improvement needed here. Still the staff were attentive and polite.

FOOD: Went there for the kebabs and definitely it was an honor to be tasting it when you have the owner in front of you. We started from the Reshmi tikka kebab which was marinated well and fried perfectly, secondly we had the Prawn kebab which looked amazing. Completely fried. thirdly the Tangri kebab was classy. Cooked excellently. Every bite was tasting awesome. Fourth the mutton kebab didn't left me disappointed as well. It broken perfectly with the spoon and tasted great. Lastly we has the Fish Kebab which was soft and nice, juicy and breaking easily. From the two rounds of kebabs all of them were equally well. For all the kebabs i give a THUMPS UP. Ending it Rice and Chicken curry which closed everything on the table with complete happiness and satisfaction.

KEBABS : 9/10

RICE AND CURRY : 8.5/10

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality was very good. It looked the raw material used making the dishes were completely fresh. Quantity was also decent. Prices are fine and you have a Valentine special menu for the week.

CONCLUSION: A place with so many Kebab options. You won't be disappointed and will feel happy after having something like those stuffs in your mouth.¬†
I wish team Marufaz very well and all the best for their coming week and ahead.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

It is just walking distance from where I live and so for any occasional cravings for rolls, I normally come here. Chicken roll is delicious. But a thumbs down for their egg roll...
Now coming to the big shots of the menu, their normal mutton biriyani is quite good but I won't dare to compare it with the levels of arsalan and even the newly opened aminia nearby. Also, the award for the "worst chicken resala I had in my life" goes to marufaz. Its really awful. But their chicken reshmi butter masala is really very good.
The ambience and decoration is really great.

I have ordered food many times from Marufaz but this time to my awe, I received very poor quality food. I did order a Mutton Chaap and a Chicken Tandoori (full). The Chaap was dry and half of the gravy was outside its container as it did spill out, making things worse. The quality of mutton was just not good compared to previous deliveries and also consisted of small bones. And when it comes to Chicken Tandoori, I must say that I have never tasted such awful stuff. It was dry and tasteless. I generally refrain from saying inferior words about food, but couldn't resist myself this time. I hope Marufaz will look into the matter and continue serving better food.

Nice environment . But poor management. The waiters need to be trained. Taste was good but not awesome . I order chicken chaap and Lachcha Paratha . Lachcha paratha was not good at all . But chicken chaap was good in taste. We also ordered Kasha chicken and Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala. Kasha chcicken was good enough .
Most pathetic was, the restaurant don't even provide finger bowl. When we asked for a finger bowl, one of the hotel staff simply showed us the wash basin . So I think they need to make a lot of change.
Later one day, we ordered Tandoori Murg and Chicken Biriyani. 
Biriyani was average in taste. The chicken was well cooked but the potato should be more soft.
The tandoori murg was awesome. But the chutney given was not god enough. But the tandoori murg was good in taste and soft enough.

Okay the rule is not to judge any restaurant by its service during the pujas, but i will still give this review because certain things have come in to my notice and i believe it shall be spoken. Firstly the menu is shortened because of the puja rush and i completely agree with that . What i do not agree is that you cannot maintain quality in the little that you offer. For starters we ordered chicken reshmi kabaab and mind you they were dried. It seemed they were prepared pretty earlier and just heated in the microwave. For the main dish we ordered chicken biryani and mutton chaap. Know this the briyani was not hot and from the dish it seemed it was cooked quite early, we were not ready to guess when . This is the point where i cant seem to understand . If you are minimizing your dishes , at least provide quality . The mutton chaap was not impressive at all , had bones and guess what like all other dishes it seemed cooked earlier and just being heated. The service was no courteous at all but i will not stress at that because i always concentrate on the food. The firni was good maybe a saving grace. I think i will give a try sometime else but for now only 2.5 for me .

This restaurant started of with a lot of promise but now its deteriorating everyday. We ordered 2 plates of Mutton Chanp, through swiggy but the quantity is extremely poor. Very disappointed. Hopefully will never order from here again.
I never thought that I will have to write this about this restaurant. It was actually very close to my heart, but the way they have started to cheat on people, is simply unacceptable. 
Still would say, the Biryani still tastes good. And the kebabs are also good.

Finally had the long awaited biriyani from marufaz. I had bookmarked this place fr a long time and today got a chance to try marufaz.

I am really happy to say that arsalan had found a worthy competitor. There arnt many good restaurants in behala but now things are changing and its evident from marufaz.

I opted for home delivery today. I ordered chicken biriyani, mutton kacchi biriyani, tangri kebab and chicken lababdar.

The delivery guy took a bit time to reach.they took around 1hr 15min to deliver. Now over to the food.

Tangri kebab - 10/10 . Best tangri kebab i had..even bettr than the one i had at Oudh 1590.

Mutton kacchi biriyani- 7/10 ...very nicely cooked ..bit spicy..definitely lived upto the reputattiin kacchi biriyani had gained frm the reviews.
Negative point- the piece of mutton in it was a blob of fat with very little actual mutton sticking to it..and it wasnt soft either. So thts a dissapointment.

Chicken biriyani-8/10 light tasty perfctly cooked rice. The chicken in it was soft and juicy.

Lababdar-9/10 ..simply loved..tangy soft and succulent chicken..it was delicious.

All this cost around 650/-( quite reasonable).

Impressed with marufaz overall..
Only dissapointment was the rubbery mutton and the long wait fr the delivery..

Just when I had lost all hope for a good restaurant in d Behala region . .here comes a place I sweared to eat in again n again. .

We decided to get d food delivered since its getting impossible to reach Behala quick. .so we called d place up n they were happy enuf to deliver for a order of 500 n above.

The prices are reasonable n if I may say so ,cheap. So we ordered two chicken biriyanis ,one kebab n a chicken masala,stuffed kulchas n phirni.
I will say this I liked this biriyani more than d Arsalan one. Its somewhr btwn . .being not as greasy as d Haji one n not too light like Arsalan. They come in huge amount . .u can smell d fresh spices n with huge pieces of chicken n eggs.
The kebab was good, the stuffed kulchas were amazing, though the cheese filled one was not as good.
The chicken dish had a lottt of oil,nicely flavoured oil, but oil all d same .It tasted good but I'm avoiding those from next time.
The phirni is too good . .much better than d ones u get in Arsalan or Shiraz . .even in their Park Circus branch.So that's a must have.
So a very good experience n a happy development!

This joint was in my bookmarks for pretty long time.Finally gave it a try yesterday. Had mutton kachhi biriyani, chicken makhanwalay & burhani.
The mutton was nicely cooked but failed to notice the uniqueness of the much talked about 'kachhi' flavour. The rice wasn't regular yellow and white mixture of long grain basmati rice only. It was nicely flavoured & well cooked along with lots of herbs & greens.
The chicken was well cooked too but tasted just like standard butter masala.
The burhani was served in the end.

The decor gets a thumbs up. The minimal movie posters & the spaciously arranged tables are really good.

But what the joint lacked was a good service. The waiters are ill-informed about the menu. The one who served the biriyani thought the speciality of kachhi biriyani was the extra mutton piece it contained which unfortunately we couldn't find.
With a little bit of buckling up in the area of service this joint can go a long way.

The ambience is awesome. I just liked it. The first time I went out there, I tried the Biriyani it's simply WOW! The one I liked the most is the Kacchhi Biriyani which is not like the traditional biriyani that we normally have. The masala kulcha is another must try. It's so soft, buttery and the stuffing is awesome too. The Biriyani and kulcha would be my recommendation that you must try alongside other dishes. I'd definitely like to visit the place again and again.

We ordered from Marufaz last friday from food panda.
The many items from the menu was not available. So we had to ask what all items were available before placing the order.
Coming to the food quality: I will rate it as 4.5 out of 5.
Taste: 4.5 Out of 5
and Quantity 4.5 out of 5.
Over all score of 4.5.
The Tangi kababs were well cooked and juicy, Chef special mutton biriyani was very lite and the quantity given can suffice two people easily.
Even chef special mutton was good. zafrani Firni was ok, not that great.
The best mughlai restaurant in Taratala, new alipore, behala, parnashree Vicinity.
Far better than Arselan in terms of taste, price, quality and quality.¬†
Hope they will keep up this quality.

It's a new place in Behala and once again it was an online order from FoodPanda.

We ordered Chef's Special Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Chicken Tangri Kabab, Mutton Sheekh kabab, Chef's Special Mutton and for Zafrani Phirni for desert.

The best was Chicken Tangri kabab. Its a straight 5/5. It was juicy, slow cooked and a little grilled which altogether made it the best Tangdi kabab I had in years. Compare it with any good place, even Delhi's best kababs (karims) or anywhere else. It was the best dish of the evening.

The Chef's Special Mutton biriyani was good in quantity and tasted better than any Arsalan.

The rest of the dishes were a notch better than most places.

Since, this place is new and has no branches yet, I wonder if they are going to keep up this quality. If yes, its gonna be another great foodie's place in Kol.

2nd Experience [11/10/15] (A delivery again) - Equally awesome quality and rich in flavor.

I just invented this one in Food Panda!! I dont even know it's exact location yet (hopefully I don't need to know either as long as Food Panda will deliver in my doorstep!).I ordered chicken tikka kebab (rs130), and chicken reshmi kebab (rs130). (Needless to say pocket friendly). I must admit that the chicken was well cooked and melted in the mouth. The taste was well balanced and they did not overburn the chicken.You could easily find the aroma of clay kiln which is the heart of any tandoor.I am interested to taste more of their items.

ordering some rolls so ordered some thanks to foodpanda ^__^

i ordered 1 Chicken Cheese Roll and 1 Mutton Roll ^___^

both were awesome!!! 

the Chicken Cheese Roll was cheesy in taste with big chunks of chicken cubes ^___^ 

the mutton roll was good too!!

            quality and quantity has downgraded a lot!! 
today i ordered Chicken Biryani & Chicken Lababdar through foodpanda after a long long time!!!!

review;

Chicken Biryani less quantity average quality!! the chicken leg piece was average in taste tho big in size! the alu was awesome!! the biryani was hell lot spicy!!! my stomach is burning like hell!!!!

Chicken Lababdar gravy was awesome! but the chicken was not tasty!!! at some bites it looked undercooked :3 also it was chewy!! quantity was ok!

so overall i will rate marufaz 3 out of 5!

PS the marufaz delivery men's are not good!

rating 1 star cause i found du nombori in chicken lababdar ( check last pic ) never thought marufaz would do this!

Its a welcome addition to Behala, even more as they provide home delivery to my place near Bakultala. Coming to food, the kababs are very good specially the Tangdi Kabab and mutton boti kabab. I liked the Biriyani as well , not to oily and no extra essence. The service at the restaurant can improve as it takes quite long and the waiters are confused while taking the order as to what is available. The firni was one of the best I have had so far.

The worst experience ever . They gave us half cooked chicken tandoori a tandoori roti instead of lachcha paratha and to top it all boiled chicken pieces in Reshmi butter masala . We read the review and thought of trying this restaurant but I guess some places are just for good show and bad taste. Avoid this place during pujas as they will be the worst during rush . Will take the orders wrong , the roadside roll centres are more satisfactory than this place . Biryani was as bland as boiled rice . I literally had to throw the chicken pieces in biryani as it was hard to eat . Moreover quantity was absolutely not sufficient .what a waste to pay 185 rupees for a special biryani with no taste .kindly learn cooking before opening a restaurant . Terrible food !!! I am giving a rating as as one because there is no scope to give zero .

I went to this restaurant with not so much of expectation. As Mr. Indrajit Lahiri said in his review about kachhi biriyani, I wanted to have it right away. When I arrived Dis place I just loved d ambience and d decor. More importantly d food....... I had some kebabs first they were awesome. I am not a critic offiicially to say that d kebab was lackin salt, tenderness and all but I found it to be just perfect..... D chutney was really good. And then d special - kachhi biriyani...... Well it can be called a revelation. I don't think I am capable of telling how good it was, just that it made my day. I had never tasted kachhi biriyani before and I don't like any other biriyani now except that. Mutton Khurchan was a tender tasty sizzling continental type of dish. Loved it! Then at last d zafrani firni.... It was better than all d popular Mughlai restaurants.... Believe it or not. Well, for me dis was d best Mughlai restaurant that I hv been to. No offence but I think that ppl should first taste d kachhi biriyani, Khurchan, firni then should they rate this restaurant. Well kachhi biriyani is a lil spicy so ppl who don't like spicy won't love it much. But me.... I love to try things and now I m in love with these items!!

The ambience and place is nice, comfortable and cosy. 
I had ordered chicken biriyani and chicken Bharta. 
The chicken biriyani was nice, not one of the best. But the quantity, it's was way less than what we are used to. 
The same goes with the Bharta. The quantity is on the lower side. But it tasted nice. 
You can safely skip this place without worrying about missing out on much.

this restaurant goes into yet another zomato find list! ordered mutton special biryani and chicken bharta. i being an ardent fan of arsalan biryani must admit that the quality of this biryani is close to that! the mutton biryani consisted of 1 flavorful potato, 1 egg, 2 pieces of mutton and sufficient amount of aromatic rice. though the biryani was flavoursome the mutton pieces were very hard. had to deduct 1 point for that. chicken bharta was equally tasty and was not at all bland as provided by some of the renowned places. delivery was prompt!! they need to enhance the quality of mutton pieces given in the biryani to achieve better ratings!

_________
15. 11. 2016 - I have ordered thousands of time for last 1year. I used to love their food. But recently their food quality has gone down drastically. Sometimes they send burnt biryani and then another day moti biryani without any moti. Last time I ordered something and got something else. Since this place was one of my favourites I have repeatedly requested them to maintain their quality..but all in vain. the staffs are always fighting with each other and pay little attention to the customers.

According to me anyone should give this restaurant 3+ ratings. I add here 3 + 0.5 ratings because its a newly opened restaurant  in behala just beside the Punjabi Hotel, opposite to ajanta cinema hall.  Ambience is really good. Fast time in behala I found one restaurant having 3+ ambience. First time I visited this place and ordered mutton biriyani and chicken tikka masala, taste is almost same but the quantity may be differ from renowned biriyani house. But I felt that the place was superbly decorated and service is little bit slow but good.

Like all great empires in human history, Kolkata biryani scenario is changing and rapidly. Earlier one of the icons in Kolkata used to be Biryani, Kolkata style biryani with one big piece of attar-flavored potato. And most of the people in Kolkata, having not tasted any other variety of biryani, swore by it. But, things are changing. Kolkata palette is opening up to other varieties of the biryani, definitely for good‚Ä¶.

Now, Kacchi biryani is one very popular (not in Kolkata) type of biryani where raw marinated meat and rice are cooked together‚Ä¶ hence the rice gets the fantastic aroma of meat  from the degh (handi) itself. As raw (kacchi) materials are cooked at one time, the name kacchi biryani followed.

We were surprised to get invited to a place in the extreme south Kolkata (Behala) for biryani. I mean, I am seriously surprised. And, tucked in just the opposite lane of behala Ajanta cinema hall, after 2-3 shops on one‚Äôs left, lied this joint called Marufaz. Frankly, its a newbie in the Kolkata biryani scenario, but as some juniors have got their senses matured, the same story happened here.

The outlet seemed modest enough, non-AC ground floor and take-away. But, thankfully, the first floor AC section is quite spacious, and a decent sitting.

We were presented with the menu card along with a summer cooler mocktail (they don‚Äôt serve hard drinks here). On a hot sunday afternoon, the mocktail was gulped down in a flash. However, in the menucard, I could find some unusual items- Like chicken paratha and mutton paratha among others. Probably, they didn‚Äôt have it that time, but I would definitely com back hunting for it‚Ä¶. And if its anywhere related the the stuff we get in old delhi paratha-wali gali, I am blessed.¬†

However, sooner than we expected, the kebab platter arrived. Its good, but nothing great. Mutton and chicken sheekh kebabs were perfect, but the chicken reshmi tikka probably needed a little more marination time. Mahi tikka was good, and they use a good quality imported Basa.¬†

Like all good kolkattans, we were eagerly waiting for the biryani. And, as per the suggestion by the owner Mr. Azim Shah, we ordered Kacchi Biryani. It arrived finally and boy, we were just bowled out by the sheer look of it. Portion-wise its fantastic, much better than other joints (considering the famous taratala one) and the next thing that hit us was the aroma. It was punched with the combination of pudina, dhania leaves, slit green chillies and those nice, long grained basmati rice was having the smooth aroma of meat. A little spicy, but heavenly dish. The gave 2 pcs of good sized meat and (thanfully) no potato. Ad at 160-180 Rs a plate, its DEFINITELY value-for-money.¬†

Please forgive me. I just forgot to click good pictures and almost jumped on the thing.

Thankfully, they didn‚Äôt serve green salad here with Biryani, which I hate (I am unable to understand how chewing some onion and cucumber adds to the biryani taste‚Ä¶.. Anyway, its personal choice). Instead, they served a glass of good quality Burhani. Burhani is normally a ghol/ Lassi flavored with garlic, kalonji, roasted cumin seeds, little pudina and what not. Its basically used as to clean the palette after the rich biryani. It was good, but frankly, I didn‚Äôt need anything after this heavenly biryani.¬†

Along with biryani, we got some chicken reshmi butter masala and bread basket. Here is another surprise for us. The chicken reshmi butter masala is made using creamy yellow gravy and the chicken is surprisingly smooth and soft. Loved it. Bread basket was a regular one- nothing special.

But, after every damn thing, the insider glutton in me was craving for some more of the biryani and I packed some for dinner at home. They do a free home delivery within 5 kms, but sadly, our house is far than that.¬†

Somewhat religiously, we ended up with the zafrani phirni. nice, but the problem is, once you‚Äôve met the maestro (kacchi biryani in this case), everything else seems pale. Not demeaning the phirni in any way, its pretty decent. But, personally I feel next time, I‚Äôll fill up my stomach with some more of their biryani.

I have been to this newly opened restaurant at Behala, the ambience is really classy. Food is high on quality, flavour and taste. I had their Biryani which is very light and good in portion. Kebabs are really soft and juicy. Chicken achari is too good to resist. Service staffs are cordial. Overall had a pleasant evening with family.

Located on the opposite lane of Ajanta cinema and after 2-3 shops you will be able to spot this restaurant. Behala anyways does not hosts resturant which has good good ambiance and while entering this joint I really liked the ambiance, posters with the names of Indian cinema and miniature signed bats of the cricketers. 

The sit and eat area is also nice and I really loved the ambiance of this place. But for me its the food and service that has to speak and gets the points.

It took me 4 attempts to make the waiter understand the order, it was not much but still it almost hit my patience level, every time I tell him the order he misses something or the other and after some time he got it right and just to check whether he really had the right order I checked the KOT.

Ordered special mutton biryani, chicken biryani, Mutton chaap, Tanduri chicken and Murg rezala.

Tanduri chicken was good in taste and spicy too, but I felt it to be a little bit dry. Well I don't expect it to be really juicy but still..

Mutton Biryani, I seriously did not like the taste of the mutton pieces given in the biryani, the size of each piece is big compared to any other joint but for me it was just not the taste which I could enjoy, for the rest of the biryani to me it was a bit pale and lacked the right blend of the spices. Well one can come and say this is what it was suppose to be, but sorry I was not having awadhi biryani, it was a normal mutton biryani with two pieces.

Murg rezala, too pale for me, it did not go well for me. I was seriously searching for some taste on my palette which was completely missing.

Mutton chaap, one of my favorite dishes. The preparation was nice but just not the best. 

In terms of the cost it does not pinches your pocket. Visit this place if you want to have nice cozy place to eat within the budget but low on the taste expectations

Tired of stale, flavorless, oily Biryanis that totally don't hit the spot? If you want the real deal then this is the place. If you like well-spiced and extremely generous portions of rice and meat, then Marufaz will hit the spot with its heady biryanis. They cook their chicken and mutton briyanis traditionally in a dum style, which flavours the rice immensely. Flavorful but superbly balanced biryanis that you can't stop eating, dunked in glorious Lucknowi Biryani, or Hydrabadi Biryani if you prefer. This will satisfy any Biryani craving you have and then finish off with a nice glass of Burhani!

Marufaz Daawat e Mughlai, begins their voyage in this monsoon by spreading the delightful royal aromas of exotic range of Biryanis, in their first Biryani Festival from today at their Flag ship store in Behala. This occasion is graced by presence of Tolly Celeb, Koneenica Banerjee. The restaurant retains its old world charm with photos of assorted news over the years, and allows you to dine comfortably in air-con. Sitting arrangements are also specious and comfy.

Authentic Mughlai cuisine, which is derived from Persian-influenced food served in the imperial kitchens of the Mughal Empire which was traditionally centered in the north Indian cities of Delhi and Hyderabad has now become an important staple of the Bengali diet in Kolkata. The dishes Marufaz Daawat e Mughlai brings out here are Kachhi Gosht Ka Biryani, Murg Tikka Biryani, Mutton Lucknowi Biryani, Machli Biryani, Prawn Biryani, Moti Biryani. For vegetarians, there is Kofta Subz Dum Biriyani, which is the north Indian style of biriyani and Subz Hydrabadi Biryani. This is followed by desserts like Zafrani Firni and as accomplishment there is Burhani.

I tried Machli Biryani first and found it less spicy and pretty decent. This briyani was cooked and served traditionally, without any curry, but every bit aromatic. It's also healthier with the omission of ghee, so you can feel a tiny bit less guilty.

Next I tried Murg Tikka Biryani and that was quite interesting. Perfect mixed of chicken tikka with dum biryani and chicken pieces were full flavoured, well-spiced and tender. With a generous and even spread of texture throughout the biryani, you're ensured oozing glory.

Finally I enjoyed Kachhi Gosht Ka Biryani, this kid goat briyani, super soft meat without gamey flavour. Melt in mouth tender meat hides under a pile of beautifully light, fragrant, spiced and high-quality basmati rice. If you've got the time in your hand, relax and enjoy your tender mutton, this was a serious briyani.

The mutton, fish and prawn Biryanis at Marufaz Restaurant is something so unique you may never have tasted anything like it. Well worth the hunt for this place located right opposite of Ajanta Cinema, the biryani is generous, well spiced, and unbelievably tasty. Seriously, you have to try it to believe it.

My suggestion, go for the mutton over the chicken briyani. The fish and prawn briyani are also mouth watering. While it is arguably no longer the best, it is an excellent briyani. Next time you're at Behala near Ajanta Cinema, be sure to give this a try.

Marufaz is a relatively new restaurant, which I think is roughly 3-4 months old. But inspite of not being open for a very long time, it has created a niche for itself and is in my opinion one if the best restaurants in Behala. Their Kebabs are delicious, the Biryani is light and the mutton keema I had the other day was robustly flavoured. 
The staff is hardworking, polite and efficient. They take customer feed back very seriously. 

I want specially mention the Chelo Kebab platter I ate their recently which was superb. It consisted of ten pieces of kebabs, namely two pieces of Tandoori fish, 2 pieces of Chicken reshmi, two pieces of Chicken tikka and Four pieces of mutton seekh kebab. In the centre was perfectly fried sunny side up, (the yolk of which oozed out just brilliantly when I put my fork through it) on a bed of coriander rice. The only thing different from the regular chelo platters of park street was the lack of a butter cube but I actually did not miss the butter at all! 
The chicken tangri kebab on the hand came like a sizzler! The presentation was impressive and the kebab was extremely soft and juicy. 

The ambiance of Marufaz is simple and nice. The busiest part if the restaurant is actually their take away counter from where you can buy kebabs and rolls.

Visited this place for chicken biryani. The taste was good as I don't like overuse of oil and spices. The quantity could have been a little more but I guess the modest pricing makes up for it.
The location is easy to reach, its placed on a street opposite to the Ajanta cinema hall.

In a city famous for its Biriyani, the average consumer is often spoilt for choice. There are 3-4 so called "top" Mughlai joints in the city that most people love to frequent.  As a food lover, I've always craved for that "X" factor in Mughlai cuisine . Marufaz came heavily recommended, and I wanted to check it out for myself.

We went in a large group and had the liberty of trying out all the kebabs on offer. Each variety was outstanding and had a distinct flavour and texture. Being a self proclaimed Biriyani connoisseur, I was apprehensive and excited about trying the Chef's Special Biriyani since I has tried all the various signature styles of the various "top" restaurants in the city and wondered just how different this would be.   * slurp! * It was irresistable. Possibly the most satsfying biriyani expereince in a very long time. I hope they keep it up!

One can tell that the restaurant is a labour of love and true to its roots. 

I'm definitely going back to Marufaz for more. Don't miss it!

Loving the fact that Behala now boast such nice and classy places to dine out!! Marufaz is the new entrant in the category... Yes the location is a bit off... situated at Ajanta, however the restaurant is very well decorated... The dining area upstairs is spacious and aesthetically pleasing... Coming to food... We ordered Chicken Tandoori full, Mutton Tikka kebab, Chicken Chaanp, Garlic Naans and Firni...first of all chicken tandoori, 8 pieces @ 210 served is just wow!!! I was really astonished at the prices in the menu..the mutton kebab was 200 odd, chaap 100(!!!) n garlic naans were for 20!! I mean the roadside dhaba near my office charges that much and one has to stand in the rain... Neway the food was really tasty...however the mutton should have been a bit more melt in your mouth..the chaap, naans and firni was delicious... Overall the place is worth a visit for providing quality food at very low prices..

Tried the takeaway counter tonight. To start of with, I like the downstairs non-ac arrangement, feels like a traditional muslim restaurant. They are also using plastic glasses and jugs to match the environment. The waiters are dressed in pathan suits and behaved well, however I felt the co-ordination between them is a bit clumsy. I had to wait for more than 20 mins for my biryani and couple of regular side dishes. They have an air-conditioned arrangement upstairs too. They accept phone orders till 11pm in the night and deliver upto 5 kms on a minimum order of Rs. 500.

Mutton Biryani tasted fine. Sufficient quantity for an average eater. Not too oily, but nicely colored in zaffran. However the mutton was hard, and the potato was half cooked as well. The biryani missed an egg also. The chicken in the biryani was appropriately cooked though. I also ordered Murgh Reshmi Butter Masala and Murgh Makhanwalay. gravy of which tasted pretty good, but again the chicken pieces were slightly on the harder side.

The restaurant looks nice, location not so great (opposite lane of Ajanta cinema), specially with the metro construction work going on. However just because of the low prices, it can give good competition to the likes of Haji Saheb, but for that they need to improve the chicken and mutton quality.

Dine in experience was good. Great decoration, ambiance wonderful. Food quality much improved. Suitable for family dinner.

It actually has two parts an 'Adda Zone' @ground floor and a casual dining place @first floor.¬†
Just want to hang out with friends while having some good rolls or Badsahi chicken and Marufaz special parathas' the ground floor is you ideal place.
A treat or just dinner with friends and family? Enjoy the causal dining @first floor.¬†
I went their yesterday. The ambience was good. the service was fast and the waiters are always there to state you their best dish to enjoy.

When delectable mughlai sensibility meets kitschy funk you get Marufaz :). A new restaurant bang opposite Ajanta at behala, Marufaz bowls you over with their version of Halim and if that doesn't satiate you, order their Kebabs and lose yourself in the creamy, fragrant chunks that are placed in front of you. The Biriyani is light and doesn't make you feel that "filled till my tonsils" feeling though the portions are pretty generous. Special mention to the Burhani and Zafrani Firni. While the ambiance will get you relaxed, the food would ensure that you visit once again and finally the pricing will guarantee that you keep visiting for good!!

Ambience is nice with mughal look and having pictures of the flying Sikh!! Staffs wearing pathan suits and also attentive. Must try chicken lababder and masala coke. Apart from that, biryani tastes good and quantity is also sufficient. Food gets served quickly and also pocket friendly. Overall nice experience and will also visit again. :)
