A nice and cozy place, when it comes to having decent Bengali food. The quality here is quite good and the quantity mostly surpasses the price against which it is offered. The ambiance is minimal, but that gives away for some great homely food.

if u'll want to have the perfect bangla type food it is the most appropriate place to be.the only problem is the manager is too rude while  dealing with the customers

this is a typical  "bangali Khawar hotel" which can be a saviour on that typical day when you want "ghorer khawar" yet neither can you afford the costly bengali restaurants nor do you want to cook. You will get everything right from dal ,bhaat, macher jhol even data chorchori. The cooking is light and the food is really pocket friendly

When both your pocket and tummy is empty. 
Authentic bengali food CHEAP, TASTY, HYGIENIC. What else does one want. Not an appropriate place for a family outing, but one must try their egg kasha and mutton kosha. üëåüèº

Rani hotel is very popular as a "bhaater hotel" in this area. They serve a variety of bengali dishes and all of them are homely with less oil. I personally like their mutton very much.. goes amazing with the rice.. the variety of veg dishes are good too. Pricing is reasonable. Ambience is not good so its better to do a take away or home delivery.
