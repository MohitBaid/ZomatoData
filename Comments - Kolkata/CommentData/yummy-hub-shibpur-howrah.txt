We went there around 4 'O' Clock in the evening as we were dead hungry. We stopped by and ordered the 3 surprisingly cheap Veggie Vada Pav and A Red Sauce Pasta. We were served the Vada Pav within a few minutes and damm it was yummy. I mean the Vada Pav Franchise GOLI did not make Vada Pav this good and that too for a mere 20bucks. Then came the Pasta and it was THE best pasta in the locality.Overall Good ExperienceWe labelled it as our new adda.....
