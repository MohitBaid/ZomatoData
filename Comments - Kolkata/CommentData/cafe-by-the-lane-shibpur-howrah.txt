After experiencing many famous cafe of kolkata, we entered the CAFE BY THE LANE & tasted the CREAMY TORTILLA CHICKEN WRAP...it was out of the world..I'm sure that today this is the best item we've tasted..try it..
Another thing is the ambience. It is too good..The music, decoration & the warm welcome make the place more attractive..This cafe takes an important role to change our locality..üòçüòç

The good news is that now the residents of Shibpur do not need to travel to the other side of the bridge to satisfy their hunger cravings!
 Finally, we have a great caf√© where we can have some seriously good food at dirt cheap prices.

Located at Shibpur Tram Depot area, opposite Ghoriwala math, this tiny caf√© can accommodate around 8 people. The interior is tastefully done and you can pick up a book of your choice from their collection and read it while sipping your favorite hot chocolate.

The cafe serves delicious dishes and the portions are decent.  
We had ordered Sandwiches, Pasta and a number of Chicken & Fish items and loved each of them.  

They also serve great breakfast on Sundays for just Rs.200-Rs.250 (all inclusive). 

Recommended! Bookmark now & visit at the earliest!

In a small place creating some great & fantastic European dishes like Chicken Francesse is just awesome to have it in the lane nearby as the name denotes Cafe "By The Lane". The restaurant ambience is fulfilled by music & some frames of singers & legends. The best dish for a vegetarian Pasta-Au-gratin & Grilled Sandwich, there is a lot of varieties for the non veg.

CAFE BY THE LANE is simply your second home,  good classy food served with love,  garnished with care and presented with passion.  Music acts as a catalyst here and I love to play the guitar when it's full house.  Ohhh,  I am the father of this cafe and I feel so happy to bring a change in the shabby streets of Shibpur,  I am Armit and I welcome you all and thank you all from the core of my soul for taking this cafe back home through your memories.

finally a cafe in our locality , a place for english breakfast on sundays , continental menu for the rest of the evenings. The location is near Shibpur Tram depot , on the ground floor of the building opposite to Ghori-ola maath .The owner is the chef who strums and sings when free. The place is a small rectangle , holding 4-5 two seater marble topped tables fixed with the wall and open kitchen at one end . The strong shades of orange on the wall , warm lights , beautiful sculptures and decorative pieces , few books and huge number of wall hanging frames makes the interior amazing , however some rearrangement in seating can do better utilization of the narrow space. Also boutique body care products and costume jewelleries displayed are on sale.

We ordered a lot . Here goes the individual ratings - 
Bacon and cheese wrapped chicken 4.5/5
Chicken Francese 4.2/5
Fish meuniere 4.2/5
penne in white sauce with chicken & mushroom 4/5
Chicken mayo sandwich 3.5/5
Nutty pancake 3.5/5 ( no dessert menu yet!)
Hot chocolate 2/5 (this one was more like bournvita :/)
Honey glazed rum burnt chicken 1.5/5 (somewhat bitter and just weird)

we packed Fish fingers and Chicken and cheese balls , the former were normal ones drizzled with mayo on top , the balls were honestly a let down being too small and bland .

The pricing is reasonable but these arrived one by one , quite slowly . Serving needs to be faster. Portions are towards lesser side.

My rating for food and ambience is 4/5 and a 0.5 more for encouraging the people behind running the cafe and mostly for coming up with this concept and introducing the localites to cafe culture .

Finally a plate of pasta is available at shibpur , this is like a dream come true !!

I am totally in love with this place! I ordered a Pasta Augratin and a Bacon Chicken sandwich and both of them were amazing.
The food is made in an adjacent kitchen and you can see it as it's being made. Totally fresh and amazing. Even the prices are moderate and the portion sizes are good. All of it is accompanied by an amazing ambiance and great music. Jazz, Blues and Rock, the old-school music will soothe your ears and the lighting and decor is pretty pleasing to the eye. I came to check this place out all the way from Chandannagar on the word of one of my friends and by God I'm amazed. 10/10 would recommend.

Best cafe in Shibpur, rather it's a concept later with great decor and yummy good. It has full of aesthetics . They serve pure Betki in fish n chips, fish meunier, fish finger and fish Portuguese. I tried Fish n chips and quality and taste at its best. The best thing is you can sit there for hours and listen to live music played by the owner. Will visit again and again.

Tried creamy chicken tortilla wrap,  believe me this is a mind blowing preparation,  it's oil free,  creamy yet spiced with herbs.  The place is filled with rock legends posters and they play 60s and 70s music,  all Western.  If you are lucky then you might see the owner playing guitar as sings the bluesy numbers.  This place is highly recommended to people from all age....

We often say ‚ÄòNever underestimate the power of a common man‚Äô. Now Here I come with a new version ‚ÄòNever underestimate the power of blind lanes of Howrah‚Äô.  I and my friends visited the caf√© on last Sunday evening.  A music themed caf√© just 10 minutes walk from my home. I couldn‚Äôt believe this at first, it took some time to register.
 D√©cor of the place is really beautiful; small table chairs, appropriate illumination, cool photo frames of music legends, perfect playlist with blues, Rock & Roll.  
We had ordered black coffee and two chicken dishes (I forgot those names), quality of the food is good too.
So It is a highly recommended place for everyone, especially if you feel affection for music and have love for blind lanes.

This amazing little space marks one of the very firsts in Shibpur. Once you enter Cafe by the lane you no longer feel like you are in Howrah as the decor, the music and ofcourse the courteous hosts serving absolutely lipsmacking food take you into a gastronomical journey to remember :D
On a quite Saturday evening we visited the Cafe and ordered everything on the menu that looked interesting and all of them were beyond our expectations.
Started with "Fish Fingers", followed by "Fish & Chips" were definitely the highlights as the fresh bhetki deserves a mention in the world full of basa. Both the dishes were very good as we wanted to go for another round but refrained as we also wanted to try other stuff.
Next it had to be the "Chicken Francese" as i had heard lots of this unique dish and now i know why it is also a must try when you are here, It is buttery, garlicy and delicious, ticks all the right boxes and thus was followed by "Pasta Augratine" to tame our taste buds with some warm, cheesy and creamy baked chicken pasta, which tasted exactly as good as it sounds.

Overall, I would definitely love to visit this place again & surely recommend for the delectable food, the bewildering prices and the warm owners who leave no stones unturned to give you the best experience :)

So finally there is a nice cafe in Howrah. I'm so glad for that. It's a bit small but well decorated with posters of music legends. They play great music üòç. They have a guitar which you can play if you want to and they also have books to read.
The Food was delicious. we ordered chicken supreme, chicken Frances, another item( with sausage and barbecue sauce) i forgot the name and nutty pan cake. I loved the pan cake and chicken supreme.
 All though there was only one cook/waiter so it took a lot of time to serve. But other than than everything was good. 
If you want Good food in pocket friendly price with great background music, you must visit the place.  üòÄ

They also serve Sunday Breakfast which is far better than any other outlets. Chicken Francese, Chicken Supreme, Fish Finger in 1000 island sauce, Creamy Chicken Tortilla Wrap, Pop Eye Salad, Sandwiches, Mega Omelettes, Pasta and what not.... Its a package. You can see all the rock legends on the wall, Eric clapton, BB Kings, SRV, Marley, Dillon, Chuck Berry and many more. This will change the face of shibpur.

Located near Aloka, Howrah this place is very tough to find for the first time. 

The place is good, small and compact. Price is reasonable and food is quite good.

Now this was my first time. I just loved the ambiance inside. Old pop music playing, guitars are there and you can play it. I ordered fish & chips, Bacon wrapped Chicken, Chicken Wrap. Fish and Chips was good. Bacon wrapped Chicken was also good. Bacon was well cooked. Now the surprise dish. Chicken Wrap was introduced by the cafe today. We ordered it and it was the best. The wrap was crispy and all in all it was a wonderful experience.

Warm, cozy place and definitely great for hanging out or meeting your old friends. Menu was good, service was good and food was yum. Not expensive at all.!! We ate a lot. Our tummy was full and so was our heart. My personal favourite was supreme chicken. The creamy gravy of it was mouthwatering. And cherry on the top was nutty pancake. Can't tell you how much I enjoyed that. Overall, good place to go. I have already suggested it to many friends of mine. You, who are reading this review, run, run, runnn.üòÅ

FULLY EDITED REVIEW

In my first review I had a complain on their seating arrangement. And I am glad that they went through my review and replaced their mini chairs with comfortable sofas!

This time were visited on 25th Dec and the management team have had themed their cafe on Christmas theme. The 'Cafe by the lane' wrapped under the the Christmas theme was looking super cute.
Very cosy ambience with super exciting music system have had enlightened the cafe. And when the owner issued came and played live guitar was like the cherry on the cake.

Coming to their food this time we ordered chicken cheese ball and fish muniere. As usual there is no complain on their food and it's quality.
Chicken cheese balls: Though it is small in size but it is amazing in taste. It had ample amount of melted insured the crust of chicken.
Fish muniere: Pure bhetki fish deep fried with a crunchy coating is super.

The best thing is that you can sit here for hours over a coffee, play guitar, read story books(already provided by them). The best place rejoice your evenings in Howrah.

Will surely revisit this place again and again.

Creative decoration with rock music playing in background , cute sitting arrangements based on the space available. We had two latte and mushroom chicken sandwich.Food was fresh and tasty as well as pocket friendly. You can see him making the food with care. Definitely going again to explore more.

This is a relatively new Cafe in this area. The place is really small but the ambience is really great. You can play the guitars available here also read story books that are in the shelf. The walls are filled with posters of music legends. The music they play is also good. Now coming to the food. We ordered Chicken Francese which is chicken breast fried with egg with garlic bread in juicy beer. We also ordered rum burnt chicken which is small chicken pieces in honey glazed rum and garlic. The honey glazed rum was really very tasty. The prices are pocket friendly and inclusive of taxes. The owner's behavior is very friendly and he asked us to try some fish dishes in future. Would really like to come back here again.

Best place to spend your evening with great ambience n delicious food.
Chicken francese,chicken supreme, chicken satay,chicken chesse pasta,fish Portuguese,fish meuni√©re,bacon wrapped cheesy chicken these all I have tried. .I must say each dish have something special for its own..or may be u can say the magic of the hand who make such those delicious dishes ..
Today we tried a new one chicken satay n that was also lip smackingly good like other ones but I think if they give 10pices over 8 then it will be great..
Overall its a great place to hangout with friends n loved ones.."For us it's a second home".. light on pockets..quality of food is undoubtedly worth the money..definitely worth a visit for everyone. .‚ò∫‚ò∫

This is a lovely find. The food is just great and the best thing is that you feel like you are enjoying it at your very own place. Must have list includes Chicken Franscese, Chicken Supreme, Shakes, Mush Muniere, Chicken Cheese balls, rum burnt chicken and all sandwiches. Would be a good idea to introduce wraps in the menu. Do remember to ask the Chef to strum on the guitar if he can find time. Visit this place even when you feel like having some quality me time.

I would like to request  all to visit there... cause in shibpur we don't have cafes like this... personally  I'm very happy that finally  someone took the initiative  to do so.. we tried Chicken  Frances,  cheese chicken balls, kitkat shake and cheese & corn sandwich.. Kitkat shake is almost tastes  like keventer's which is really great.. cheese chicken ball was well cooked cheese was tasted like cheese burst, chicken Frances was good too.. and cheese corn sandwich was yumm..  soon it will be live music cafe.. so thumbs up for the whole thinking üíú
