God knows what happened to my dad once that he got Chinese food from this Punjabi hotel for us once. The food was pathetic as supposed to be - Chilli Chicken and Mixed Fried Rice. The rice hardly had chicken or prawns, only contained eggs. The Chilli Chicken was too hot. Didn't like the food at all.

Not one of the best hygeine but this place can be a good option to have great food without thinning your wallet too much.  The chowmein is good.  I personally like their mutton chops the most.

This place is located right on the first crossing when u drive down into the "BATA" turn by hazra. If you are a hygienic person then perhaps this place might not appeal to you. Get over that part and you will find yourself a great value for money. It's a cheap place with really good taste. I got the chance to taste their chicken masala dish which was chicken but with egg masala. Amazing dish to eat. And then they have dal tadka which again is truly good. You combine the two with freshly made roti or naan. And you seriously will over eat. It's just one of those places that doesn't look promising from outside but definitely has a kick
In its food.

It's a brilliantly located run down dhaba with very cheap food. The tasks and the chicken bharta are nice and so is the saag paneer. It's also a good place to have tea. An old sardarji runs the place and he is usually very helpful. I have been getting food from this place for years
