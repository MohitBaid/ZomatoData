Was really looking forward to this. Had the black current flavor, with almond and pista toppings. The ice cream was exceptional, one of the creamiest I've ever had. The main attraction was obviously how it was prepared.
There are a few places to seat, although they could try to accommodate some outside seating arrangements. Plus one for the wordplay on the name! My one gripe would be that they could be a bit more generous about the amount of toppings. Also the waffle come was just meh. Still, will revisit soon to try out the other flavors.

Nitrogen ice-cream as fresh as it can be. Along with availalibility of various kind of seasonal flavour you have to play hard to choose the best flavour for you.  Benerasi Pawn is my favourite one.  They also serve some delicios shakes which would definitely won yourself to thrive for more.  Highly recommended.

Loved this tiny little ice cream parlor. The icecream is flash frozen so it's incredibly smooth and creamy. We ordered a chocolate icecream with brownies and kit-kat toppings as well as a raspberry topped with Ferrero Rocher. Both were excellent. Total bill was under 300 so it's very competitively priced. And the staff was very pleasant. Only con is the place is cramped for room and with only one staff so there is usually some waiting time. Would 100% recommend this place.

To all the ice cream lovers dig into this ice cream parlour N2 Ice Cream where we can see them prepare the ice cream in front  of us and they are made of liquid nitrogen. You can find their outlet near Azad Hind  Dhaba  next to Birla Mandir .Do try out their Mitha Jaadu made with Nolen Gur and raisins and nuts which would give you the sweet temptation with the crunchy nuts and would make you carve for more. Rum and Raisins made out of rum and raisins mixture this taste a bit different and has a sour taste making it different and unique from the others.
Litchi Shake is made with liquid nitrogen too with rich and thick milk and has a sweet taste and also taste kinda  like mango.
Watermelon Sorbet is also made of liquid nitrogen and tastes sweet and looks fluffy and like a mini cotton candy.It is refreshing and freshen up your mind.
Romanian Choco Hazelnut is ideal for the chocolate lovers as here you get the taste of chocolate with the twist of hazelnut infused making it more chocolaty and delicious too.
Try out other different flavours  to savour your sweet tooth.

Price is pocket friendly and the live feature is amazing.

A nice cute little place beside dominos in Ballygunj . Bright and colorful , a perfect place to uplift your mood with some fansy , sweet , delicious ice cream.

Its great place for all age groups . While you enjoy your ice cream , sit and gossip and spend some quality time.
The best thing is you get to see exactly how your delicious ice cream is being prepared . The whole process takes about 15 minutes and in the end you get a tasty delicious dessert.

Some icreams we had there are:-
1. Rum & Raisin
2. Mitha Jaadu.
3. Choclate Hazelnut.
4. Lichi Shake.
5.Watermelon Sorbet.

Each dessert was unique and delicious. Nicely presented with wafers and cups . An eye candy dessert.
With plenty of nutts and a red juicy jelly on top , you just cant stop having only one .

Overall this place is sure to appeal to everyone wether ice cream fan or not . Also there are a large variety of flavours to choose from , so tasting all in one visit is not enough.
But it would be better if more parlours are opeaned in more locations and with a bit more space.

A good outlet but sadly located in a wrong place.
We took cream cake and chocolate hazelnut.
The taste of cream cake was top notch. Purely natural taste of butterscotch with spreaded red velvet. 
Chocolate hazelnut was okayish nothing so special
Sadly there was only one staff when we went so experienced a bit late service but then that waiting was worth it.!
Overall a good place

I have tried Nalen gurer icecream and Italian chocolate.
Taste 3.8/5
Basic flavours taste the same,not a huge difference.
Nalen gurer dessert has been pretty much love since it tasted the exact flavour.

Ambience 4/5
It is soft and cozy but very less spacious.
Take away will be better.

Service 4.2/5
They should increase manpower else it keeps the queue waiting. Yet their cordial n polite behavior made us happily wait.
Location (4/5)
Nearby metro station : rabindra sadan
Quite accessible area,Google maps will help you reach right infront of the store

N2ICREAM or N2 Ice Cream or NICECREAM whatever you say it, is a place for everyone 'coz we all love icecreams. The speciality of this Ice Cream parlor is the use of liquid nitrogen to freeze the ingredients. There are myths of use of liquid nitrogen in foods, but truth is it's safe as I have seen how they use it for making ice cream. Liquid nitrogen can cause severe frostbite, so it's better to eat the ice cream after liquid nitrogen leaves from the food by evaporating as gas. 

Enough of science and health, lets talk of the ice creams. It's a fact that use of liq. nitrogen makes the ice cream sweeter and more tasty on your taste buds. And yes you can see how the ingredientss are beings condensed on blenders after putting the liquid nitrogen on them.

We tried several items : Nolen gurer ice cream, cream cake ice cream, Chocolate ice cream, Benarasi paan ice cream, Mango Shake, Raspberry shake, kaala khatta sorbet and mango sorbet. 

sorbet items are water based, and I would skip them. 
Shakes are really good, and flavors are real fruity. 

Coming to the ice creams, they are simply great!! And after putting the spoonful of ice cream into your mouth you may think you're in 8th heaven. They are evenly smooth. Benarasi paan can kick the king inside you, but I found the taste of Nolen Gur's is surreal. You can feel the datey affair with condensed milk.

If you don't like chemistry then you will start loving it because of this N2 Icr parlor. A superb combination of liquid nitrogen & ice cream can be found here. It will surely become a favorite spot for ice cream lovers.
It's located just opposite to Azad Hind Dhaba. It's the worthy ice cream outlet in the city of joy.

This Ice cream parlor is something out of a science and technology. They mix some powder, flavor, sugar, & other ingredients are further process them in one of their Magic Machines and then they add cupful of fuming liquid nitrogen into the machine, and voila it's ready.
Watching the process of making it is more interesting and fun than eating the nitrogenous ice cream. Expirencing the whole process till eating is worth a visit.

This place not only serves ice cream but they also provide Sorbet & Shakes

I tasted :
Ice cream
✓Banarasi paan
✓ Madly Chocolate
✓ Nolen Gur Magic
✓ Cream Cake (red velvet one)
Shake
✓ Mango
✓ Raspberry
Sorbet
✓ Green Mango
✓ Kala Khatta

This Diwali prepare your taste-buds for the creamiest sensation yet, because Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream is here and it’s ready when you are. That’s right folks, there’s actually something even better tasting than ice cream or sweets on this festive season and the result comes out from a bit of freezing, blasting and topping. So, why it’s so special ?

THE TASTE

The Science Behind the Freeze. Unlike your regular ice cream, in this process liquid nitrogen is used to freeze the ice cream so fast that the ice particles simply cannot form. This is formerly explained as ice crystallization bring nucleation-dominated, and what that really mean is your taste buds are ready for pure bliss. The liquid nitrogen causes the fat molecules and the water particles to stay very small, giving the ice cream its creamy consistency rather than being clumped together. The goal is to avoid ice crystals similar to what you get when you make ice milk. The molecules can be bounce off the taste buds in your tongue more often, which makes liquid nitrogen ice cream sweeter than the normal ice cream. So, because of this method, the result is a superior smoother ice cream with one of the creamiest textures conceivable.

IT’S FAST

Remember how we said it’s made right in front of your eyes ? This is because liquid nitrogen flash freezes ice cream so quickly that it’s easily ready to be served within only a short matter of time. The faster you freeze ice cream, the creamier it is. The moment ice cream starts to freeze, ice crystals start to grow. The longer it takes to freeze, the larger they grow, and the more grainy the ice cream is. All other commercial ice cream takes a minimum of 20 minutes to freeze. Nitrogenous ice cream takes 15 seconds. Since nitrogen ice cream is frozen so quickly, the ice crystals hardly have a chance to grow, which results in extremely small ice crystals and the smoothest, creamiest ice cream possible, it’s a scientific fact! So you can kiss those long waiting periods goodbye because now, when you’re ready to order – they’ll be ready to serve!

IT’S SAFE

There may be myths floating about but don’t worry, because liquid nitrogen is indeed perfectly safe. In fact liquid nitrogen even makes up for near 80% of the Earth’s atmosphere, and so it makes sense that it’s also both non-flammable and non-toxic. And by the time it makes its way into your cup, it’s completely evaporated. There’s no way you’d be served something from a licensed establishment that didn’t meet the requirements of food safety first. So less worry, because we’re scooping!

We taste :
✓Ice cream
Banarsi paan
Madly Chocolate
Nolen Gur Magic
Cream Cake (red velvet one)
✓Shake
Mango & Raspberry
✓Sorbet
Green Mango & Kala Khatta

Every item is mouth smoothing and delicious

An ice cream parlour is probably one of the most happiest places to visit! And this cute little shop in Ballygunge is no exception! Dont miss this outlet, or you will miss a great ice cream experience! Located just beside the dominos, this outlet serves live ice cream, which is made in front of you using liquid nitrogen to freeze, and creating a special blend of the flavours, along with creativity! It also has a sitting place, and is a perfect place for your date, rather than the stereotyped coffee date.
So we tried the following flavours
Nolen gur magic-the original gur flavour was delicious! 
Madly Chocolate-had snickers in it, and chocolate lovers will love it. 
Benarasi Pan-the best of the lot! Was served on a pan, and was so refreshing! We couldn't help but take 2servings of this! Totally recommended.try this! 
Red velvet cream-colored lovely presentation, tastes delicious! 
Another recommended item is the mango shake! The real mangoes used,created a magical taste! Loved this one! 
Also had the raspberry shake, green mango sorbet and kala khatta sorbets, the sorbets are kind of gola, and gola lovers might try this with thw kala khatta flavour.

Well, my 1st stint with liquid Nitrogen based ice creams and indeed an experience to remember! The scenes of ice cream being prepared with liquid N2 gradually evaporating into the atmosphere brings tons of saliva in your mouth! It is indeed difficult to wait for the ice cream to be prepared and served and much more difficult  to having to click before you eat!

Location:- Near Azad  Hind Dhaba, Ballygunje Circular road

Items tried:- 

(i)	Nolen Gurer Magic – quite in line with the name, this was sheer magic in cream base with nolen gur sandesh!

(ii)	Madly Chocolate – a stereotyped winner, but taste much better than the usual chocolate ones!

(iii)	Banarasi paan – forget the roadside paan-wallahs and walk in to N2 to end your meal on a perfect note! The perfect cream base, the perfect paan masala crush and the perfect betel leave decor – we the group of eight were literally fighting with each other to have a morsel or two of this delicacy!

(iv)	Red velvet cream – a 5/5 for  food presentation, this could be a perfect item for the impending Christmas – the red cream crush  and cherry topping indeed does the trick!

(v)	Mango shake – great to see them using real mango pulp in preparing this mango shake, a great refreshment!

(vi)	Raspberry shake – most outstanding feature was the raspberry toppings, this one is a must try!

(vii)	Green mango  sorbet – the only item I disliked amongst all, may be because I am not much into sorbets.

(viii)	Kala khatta sorbet – Decent taste, but should have been much sour to give a real kala khatta taste!

Service and ambience is outstanding apart from the great taste! They can accommodate upto 10 odd people! Decor is pretty decent and prices quite commensurate to what they serve!

DO visit to tickle your sweet buds!

On this upcoming Diwali you will have lots of Laddus and Kaju Barfis. But is it gonna complete the dessert menu without a delicious ice cream?

If you break N²IceCream you get N² that is Nitrogen, because they use Liquid Nitrogen to make ice cream and another becomes Nice Cream. Don't worry, Liquid Nitrogen is completely safe for body because our atmosphere is filled up with 78% of nitrogen that we regularly breath. With the wonderful cooling property of Liquid Nitrogen it freezes anything at -196 degrees Celsius temperature. They use this superpower of liquid nitrogen to make the base and flavours instantly freeze in front of you. Seeing this made is a wonderful experience and fun to have.

You can choose the base from Cream, Yoghurt, Cheese or Sorbet and in flavours we choose from their best selling ones. Their fast service doesn’t made us wait for long and we were treated with their delicious piece of work.

Nolen Gur Ice Cream (4.25/5) :
——————————————————
I’ve tried this flavour in few places and found this one pretty interesting. Real flavour of dates were very much observed from the base and honey on top was adding another level of sweetness. Cream and jelly on top made it look just more delicious. The flavour of this ice cream was definitely much richer due to the making process and that makes it a sure try.

Madly Chocolate Ice Cream (4/5) :
——————————————————
This one is for chocolate lovers, crunchy delicious and chocolaty. It needs no other introduction a spoon of it is must.

Benarasi Paan Ice Cream (4.75/5) :
——————————————————
Main interest about this one was the way it was served with a real paan. Not just that it was actually made out of real paan that they crushed in front of us, mixed it with cream and freezes it in liquid nitrogen. No added colour, no added flavour. What we got is purely natural and that tasted completely natural too. Same cream, jelly and sugar sprinkle made it much more photogenic. You don’t need to order it over here, you will come over here to order this if you try it once.

Red Velvet Ice Cream (4/5) :
——————————————————
Enhanced flavour of red velvet and its richness was special about this ice cream. It was delicious and it is for those who love to taste some different flavours.

Mango Shake (4.25/5) :
——————————————
Mango Shake is very common in summer days. But their mango shake with added extra cream tasted just brilliant. It didn’t looked very delicious in glass but what it did in mouth was just magic. The flavour of mango was natural and creamy feelings made it even better with just the right about of sweetness. Another recommendation over here goes to this shake.

Raspberry Shake (3.5/5) :
——————————————
Made out of crushed raspberries this shake was also very refreshing. Balanced sweetness was worth mentioning. However I liked the Mango Shake much.

Green Mango Sorbet (2.5/5) :
——————————————
With the lite flavour of green mango and appropriate sweetness, it was good and refreshing. Personally I don’t like sorbet that much but it was nice to try.

Kala Khatta Sorbet (2.5/5) :
——————————————
Kala Khatta is everyone’s favourite while talking about sorbet. Just like green mango sorbet its flavour was very simple and lite. It was extremely cold that completely chilled us down. But for me Green Mango suited me better.

Pricing :
—————
They’ve made 5 sizes Family, Large, Medium, Regular and Shot for every budget and requirement. Nothing is too expensive and friendly priced for everyone.

Conclusion :
—————————
Liquid Nitrogen concept is worth welcoming not because its new in India, also it doesn't mess-up the natural flavour while making a new texture in Ice Cream. There's only a few number of places in Kolkata where you can get it and its one of the most cheapest and bestest option to choose from.

There's lot of weird n wonderful things in this world, but one of the weirdest and certainly most wonderful things I have recently experienced is liquid Nitrogen Ice cream. I was invited to visit the n2 ice cream to find out a little more about this nitrogen wonder. This parlour is located in Ballygunge circular Road. Small place but very pleasant, neat and clean. We begun our ice cream with some Nalen Gur Magic, Madly chocolate n banarasi pan which were tremendously tempting . The ice cream is made for you on the spot. All these came in a waffle cup which was very crispy n crunchy. Then we had cream cake (red velvet) which was also good. N2 also makes milkshake n sorbet.. So, we ordered mango n raspberry shake.. But I liked the mango shake which was absolutely top of the day..fully creamy, thick, rich n buttery..best shake I have ever had. Last but not the least " Sorbet" , v tried Green mango n Kala khatta", well it was OK. Stuffs are very courteous and professional . Overall it was a great experience n 'll surely visit again.

The Strawberry Cheesecake flavor is the Greatest Ice Cream flavor I have ever tasted! Strawberry cheese- the strawberry flavoured ice cream with a lot of cheese in it, topped with strawberry pulp.

Strawberry cheesecake ice cream with a creamy cheesecake ice cream base, and a sweet strawberry sauce and buttery graham cracker crust swirled throughout. Its like a delicious slice of strawberry cheesecake all wrapped up in a big bowl of ice cream!
It's so delicious and a good flavour according to me to the ice cream lovers .

Located at a pretty decent place, this place deserves way more attention than it recieves. I have been wanting to visit here for a while and I had the chance.

Three flavors of variations of nitro solidified ice cream were presented.

1.One flavored with pan and hundreds and thousands.
It had a distinct yet very subtle flavor of the delicious pan. Very refreshing and could easily be a palate cleanser.

2.gulab jamun flavored nitro liquid solidified ice cream.
Strongly sweet and had chunks of gulab jamun. The extra chunks of gulab jamun Ddnt do for me.
I personally was satisfied with the bits within the ice cream.

3.chocolate infused nitro liquid solidified ice cream.
This was a chocolate lovers favorite kinda thing. Extensively chocolatey.

All these came in a waffle cup which was crispy and did not leave a bad after butter taste.

4. The raw mango sorbet was amazing!!
I could totally have it all day. So refreshing for the summers and barely Any calories.
Perfectly sweet and tangy.

As a whole, it was a pleasant experience and I will surely visit again.

The introduction of liquid nitrogen for the purpose of flash freezing has given a new dimension to ice-cream. It has became the latest trend. And N2 has come up as the dark horse of this race. Located in Ballygunje Circular Road, this tiny little piece of paradise is waiting to serve you one of the best ice-cream of this city. Armed with really unique flavours, they are all set to mesmerise you and blow you away. 
Here are the ones we tried and each of them was enough to transport you to a very very happy place. 

√ Jaago Gulabo - Base - Cream, Flavour- Elaichi  , Addin/ Topping- Gulab Jamun: This one was really delicious. I could taste the bit and pieces of crushed gulab jamun in it along with the flavour of Elaichi. It was an innovative ice-cream.

√Chocolate Maharaja - Base - Cream, Flavour- Chocolate , Addin/ Topping- Hot Fudge: Who can say no to good ol' chocolate?? Yummy, luscious chocolate served on tulip cone was a delightful experience. 

√Hip Hip Hooray - Base - Cream, Flavour- Paan , Addin/ Topping- Assorted Sauff: I liked this one the best. Crushed bits of paan mixed with Elaichi flavoured ice creams with sprinkles and sauff on top. I loved it to bit. The taste of pan was so refreshing. This one is a must order.

√Green Mango Sorbet- finely crushed ice infused with the flavour of green mango. Oh my sweet little Lord. It was absolutely Wonderful. Loved this one too. Highly recommended. 

Thank you Mr. Kaushik Bhowmik for having us on such short notice. 
And thank you

√Green Mango Sorbet- finely crushed ice infused with the flavour of green mango. Oh my sweet little Lord. It was absolutely Wonderful. Loved this one too. Highly recommended. 

Thank you Mr. Kaushik Bhowmik for having us on such short notice. 
And thank you

Yes a live Ice Cream parlour... As we all know that ice cream is just love , nothing can replace it , plus when it comes to this kind of live ice cream parlour can you resist yourself ?????? Actually i can't , so when the invitation came from his side ( Tanmay Basak ) and a special thanks to Mr. Kaushik Bhowmik for hosting us . They serves different flavours of ice cream in different size scoops , with some new twists and punch along with regular ice cream .

Located at Bullygung Circular Road near Domino's .

We tasted some of their special preparations , and i should definately mention that the concept of using liquid nitrogen is very innovative , and totally health friendly . Preparations we tasted are :

* The sweet beginning ( Misti doi) - Generally Mishti doi is a perfect desert for bongs and when this Mishti doi is Ice cream state its something heaveny . Strongly Recommended.

* Chocolate Maharaja - Chocolate with hot fudge. Specially for Chocolate lovers .

* Mihidana Unveiled - A kesar flavoured ice cream with mihidana mixed in it . Mihidana is another sweet dish which is bongs favourite .

* Annar sorbet - Comes with Annar pieces as a topping , flavour mixed .

Interior is very cool , its a place one should visit atleast ones to understand that , may be - " We can't buy Happiness , but we can buy an Ice Cream " :-)

Innovation gives a new value to a product. N2ICREAM has brought that  innovation to the product called ice cream. Fusioned with different flavours this place is a paradise for desert specially ice cream lovers. Located at Ballygunge Circular Road this small yet cosy ice cream parlour serves the yummiest ice cream in the city. This place offers ice cream at a economical cost.

Munching Monks were invited to the ice cream parlour by Mr. Kaushik Bhowmick for the pre launch of pujo ice cream fusioned with different sweets and flavours so that every people can treat their tastebuds.

*The sweet beginning (Mishti Doi) (5/5) - Bongs love to have deserts after every meal. When 'mishti doi & ice cream' which are bongs favourite deserts come together  then every bong and non bong too can rely upon to enhance their sweet tooth. It is highly recommended.

*Chocolate Maharaja (4/5) - People who are partial to chocolate and it's flavour can give it a try. It is a hot fudge chocolate flavoured ice cream.

*Mihidana Unveiled (4.5/5) -It is basically ice cream with kesar flavour injected into it and mihidana being used as topping. This is also recommended.

*Aanar Sorbet (3.5/5) - It is sorbet with aanar being used as topping.

N2ICREAM is a perfect example of experimentation going right.

A cool ice cream joint in south Calcutta that undoubtedly offers the best quality of its kinds! A plethora of ice creams ranging from its different flavours to a wide range of shakes bad sorbets. Speciality here is the use of nitrogen in the making of these desserts.
Now comes the main part where we are offered with the top menus of this dessert joint.
Belgian chocolate ice Cream:- With on point flavours of Belgian chocolate, served in tulip shaped waffles, this was of its kind in its speciality.
Cream Cake Ice Cream- With a delicious Cream filled cake smothered in a strawberry ice cream, this dessert was unique in its own way and personally, this is my favourite.
Nolen Gur Shake:- Recalling the taste of vintage Bengal, Nolen Gur Shake will never fail to satisfy a true Bengali taste bud. The components in this item were on point and perfectly delactable.@l
Last but not the least, we had Orange Sorbet which is truly low in calories. With its perfect taste, it can be opted by someone who craves for desserts and yet don't wish to gain calories.
To conclude, I thank Tanmay Basak for the invitation to this wonderful dessert joint.

You might have visited a lot of ice-cream parlours, but you do not want to miss this. Located in Ballygunge, just a few minutes away from Azad Hind Dhaba is this amazing ice-cream parlour. Liquid Nitrogen is used to whip the ice-cream which obviously gives the ice-cream its desired flavour. And the fact that the parlour offers you a wide range of ingredients that you can choose from for your ice-creams or shakes deserves some plus points. We had four refreshing items:
▪ Belgium Chocolate Ice-cream- This was their special that week and also special for us.
▪ Cream Cake Ice-cream
▪ Nolen-gur shake- This was the show-stopper. Kudos to the amalgamation of the traditional bengali nolen gur and the shake made out of it. It stole my heart as well.
▪ Orange Shorbet- The first time I had a shorbet and it was very very syrupy. Yumm!

End of my review. And while I am writing this, I can feel my mouth watering up again. So? It is a must-must visit for every ice-cream lover out there.
Happy Munching.

Scientific..!! Nitrogen being used for preparation of ice cream.. Yes..!! Even you can experience in front of your eyes as it has a live counter.. The ice cream being made with liquid nitrogen with some ingredients that you prefer...

The store is located at Ballygunge Circular Road..Just a few steps from famous Azad Hind Dhaba of Ballygunge (just beside Domino's Pizza Outlet)

We went there and had experienced four types of items over there ie., Belgium Chocolater Ice cream, Cream Cake Ice cream, Nolen Gur Shake and Orange Sorbet.

Belgium Chocolate Ice cream - Belgium Chocolate being whipped with liquid nitrogen and then got frozen. Taste is really good with toppings of cream and strawberry basically itz just jelly... Very nice concept..!!

Cream Cake Ice cream - Basically its need condensed milk along with some whipped cream with added liquid nitrogen in it and it includes vanilla essence and red food color with cream cake. Taste is really yummy.

Nolen gur shake- Oh..Nolen gur is love and what else if you get it on off season.. Yes the taste is really good.. Not very strong flavor of Nolen gur making tge shake good really authentic in taste.

Orange Sorbet- If you are health conscious... Go for it... Sorbet being used with fat free sugar and being made with liquid nitrogen.. Really a Thumps up.!!

Located in Ballygunge Circular Road, this place is heaven for dessert lovers. A small cute place with eye soothing interiors. Ice cream is a dessert which is enjoyed by everyone irrespective of age. Ice creams in this place is different from the other places I had. One can witness the churning of the ice cream live in the counter. The choice of flavours, toppings and add ins are many; and different from the usual ones we always have. They have their Favorite Top 20 combination of flavours, add ins and toppings, other than that one can go for customized ice creams by choosing their own flavours, add ons and toppings. Some of their famed ice creams among the Top 20 are Benarasi Paan, Nolen Gur Magic and Imli ka Boota.

I am a very big ice cream fan. This is my second visit in a food event and nothing can be more cherishing than visiting an ice cream parlour. It is really something worth remembering in my entire life. 
Located just at  Ballygunj Circular Road towards Beckbagaan. It is certainly a place to visit starting from kids to old age people. Most importantly one can see the making of the ice cream right in front of them. It may look like a small place from outside but it surely has a lot of quality stuff inside. 
As a customer one can easily select their favorite ice cream with their desired topping. The topping collection varies to a great level which is absolutely a great news for all ice cream lovers. The ice cream served here is simply magnificent not only in taste but the preparation method is very cool indeed. 
The ice cream served here are :
•Starwberry cheese ice cream
• Choco Brownie Ice cream
• Benerasi paan ice cream: A really unique type in my experience
• Nolen Gur ice cream: A must for every Bong 
• Imli ka boota
They also serve milkshakes and Sorbets as well.  We tasted the choclate and strawberry shakes. In one word if I am to describe it I would simply address it as " Magnificent". Not only because of the taste but also because of the creation and the idea.
The interior is also very cool (not only the looks but also the atmosphere). And if you are to taste some magnificent ice cream of various flavours this is the best place for anyone. 
Thank you once again for letting me work beside you. It was simply just a wonderful experience. 
Thank you Koushik Bhowmick (Sir) for inviting us.

It's been described as the five minute way to make amazing ice cream. No cranking… no ice and rock salt mixtures… and you can forget about those electric ice cream makers. All you need is a little liquid nitrogen (-320°F), some creamy ingredients, and an appetite for exploring the science of food. Keep reading to learn the secrets for finding and safely using liquid nitrogen to make one of the most trendy desserts on the cooking show scene.

Now, let's start the journey of ice-cream trip

Strawberry cheesecake ice cream - The perfect ice cream! The flavor of the strawberries really stands out. I love that it's not too sweet... store bought ice cream can be cloyingly sweet, but this is just sweet enough. I thought it would be too cheesy with a whole brick of cream cheese, and was tempted to halve it, but I'm glad I didn't. The flavors here are very well balanced. Chocolate Brownie - It never fails to surprise me whenever and wherever I'm having it. Truly lip-smacking. Banarasi pan - Never imagined ice cream to be a blend of such tastes, flavours and amazement.. Happened to try it by chance,and was glad to try it. Nolen Gur Magic - Speak of winters and the first thought that comes to my mind is Nolen Gur (Date Palm Jaggery). This jaggery is an intrinsic part of Bengal Culture and Cuisine. A seasonal delicacy that is used to make desserts. Imli Ka Boota - I didn't find it on track with his sour and salty taste.

Overall it was a great

The art of flash freezing ice cream mixture with Liquid nitrogen is a remarkable contribution that a scientist can contribute to an art-form like Cooking. It is said that the use of liquid nitrogen eliminates the use of eggs and excessive butterfat which is required in conventional ice cream makers to add smoothness, it can achieve the same and is a lot smoother in texture due to closely monitored continuous stirring processed used in preparing the ice cream during its freezing process. There are very few places in the city of joy that dedicates to serves such delight wonders, N2ICream is one such place.

Do you remember how the movie, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory gave us future goals to get an oppurtunity to win the Golden Ticket one day and get inside that humongous chocolate wonderland? Well, too bad that we never got a chance like Charlie to experience tonnes of science magic created with chocolate but we sure can experience a tini tiny bit of it at N2 Icecream Parlour where all they do is play with different flavours and Liquid nitrogen to create icecream right infront of your eyes!
Adding Liquid Nitrogen to icecream is about all the science behind the freeze! The liquid nitrogen at -196°C brings in the fat and liquid particles together and gives the creamy texture to the icecream making it extremely smooth.

All the above rates are exclusive of 18% GST.

We were invited over for a taste tasting session by Mr.Kaushik Bhaumik who is definitely an amazing host and he explained tp us each and everything we had!

Coming to what we had and how we felt about it : 

1) Strawberry Cheesecake Icecream (4.25/5) : A very creamy yet rich dollop of icecream flavoured with strawberry crush and Cream cheese. I would recommend people intolerant towards creamcheese to stay away from this icecream because the addition of direct creamcheese actually hits the right spot and it's a boon for cheesecake lovers. When you take your first spoonfull of the Strawberry Cheesecake Icecream, you get this sweet hint of rustic strawberry crush and midway through you get that tart punch of Creamcheese! The marriage between sweet and sour is full of contrasting flavours resulting into a joyous rush of sensations over the tastebuds.

2) Chocolate Brownie (4/5) : Any chocolate lover is bound to fall in love with this one - Absolutely head knocking brain freeze moment.😂 It's a very basic chocolate icecream but churned with amazing dark chocolate brownies as the extra shot and then topped with kitkat and some more brownie bits beacuse no amount of brownie is enough to keep a person satiated.

3)Banarasi Paan (3.75/5) : Any paan enthusiast would be bowled over by the strong paan flavours. I am not a very paan person but I still was quite amazed by the taste because it started growing on me. They add in Paan Masala crush and top it with assorted paan spices for the extra punch!

4) Nolen Gur Magic (4.5/5) : Nolen gur flavoured icecrean was the star of the evening undoubtedly. A fair amount of nolen gur (date palm jaggery) sandesh is added to the icecream while churning and then topped with an extra drizzle of nolen gur. What you get is a zing of saltiness with every bite and that's what brings out the flavour of the icecream. Totally droolworthy! The best nolen gur icecream I have had.

5)Imli Ka Boota (2/5) : Everything about the icecream was okay but the Sour and salty taste of the Imli/Tamarind didn't quite sync well with the icecream.

6)Dark Chocolate Milkshake (4.25/5) : Chocolate and milkshake when combined, can create a better love story than Romeo and Juliet. Thick, luscious, creamy, rich and what not! Loved it.

7) Pomegranate Milkshake (3/5) : A very new flavour for the tastebuds so I didn't quite like it but the opinion might vary from person to person. 😅

●Final Conclusion:
•Taste Rate: 3.85/5.
•Ambience : 4/5 - Well lit and clean with a proper icecream parlour feel to it.
•Value for money - 4/5
•Staff Behavior - 5/5.

In all, N2 Icecream deserves to be rated with a 4/5!
Would definitely visit again.😎😃
Thank you

Had a Mind-freezing experience at this tiny yet cosy ice-cream parlour recently.
●Location: a couple of minutes walk towards beckbagan from the Azad Hind Dhaba of Ballygunge circular road. Just after crossing the Dominos outlet; on the right hand side of the road.
●Icecreams: the speciality of this place is that they use liquid nitrogen while churning the icecream base with the flavours and this makes it taste divine!
a) Strawberry cheese icecream - strawberry icecream lovers must try!
b) Choco brownie icecream- my personal favourite!
c) Benarasi pan icecream - loved it! Made with pan & gulkand. Yum!
d) Nolen gur icecream - fair.
e) Imli ka boota icecream - very unusual.
● Shakes: thick & creamy shakes are also available here which were exactly how fabulous shakes are supposed to be.
a) chocolate milk shake
b) strawberry milk shake
● Sorbet : they serve a variety of sorbets too which i couldn't try this time. Saving it for my next visit.

Thus to conclude :
Icecreams & shakes: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5

Thank you, Kaushik Bhaumik for hosting us.
Thanks for the invitation,

Innovation is a change which gives a new value to a product. Well, for my appetite, ice cream is that kind of product. Its really boring when you have Swirl's, Gelato, Mamamia as well as Haagen Dazs for ages. N2ICream serves well, seriously. It is highly innovative as well as, cost effective. Brownie ice cream was undoubtedly the best because, I'm a chocolate lover...haha.... But I'll not be partial regarding this. The best one was the paan-flavoured ice cream. It really made me feel whole as an Indian. That essence of being an Indian was present. I also adored the chocolate shake, yet it was very conventional. Kudos!

Had a Mind-freezing experience at this tiny yet cosy ice-cream parlour recently.
●Location: a couple of minutes walk towards beckbagan from the Azad Hind Dhaba of Ballygunge circular road. Just after crossing the Dominos outlet; on the right hand side of the road.
●Icecreams: the speciality of this place is that they use liquid nitrogen while churning the icecream base with the flavours and this makes it taste divine!
a) Strawberry cheese icecream - strawberry icecream lovers must try!
b) Choco brownie icecream- my personal favourite!
c) Benarasi pan icecream - loved it! Made with pan & gulkand. Yum!
d) Nolen gur icecream - fair.
e) Imli ka boota icecream - very unusual.
● Shakes: thick & creamy shakes are also available here which were exactly how fabulous shakes are supposed to be.
a) chocolate milk shake
b) strawberry milk shake
● Sorbet : they serve a variety of sorbets too which i couldn't try this time. Saving it for my next visit.

Thus to conclude :
Icecreams & shakes: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5

Thank you, Kaushik Bhaumik for hosting us.
Thanks for the invitation,

Innovation is a change which gives a new value to a product. Well, for my appetite, ice cream is that kind of product. Its really boring when you have Swirl's, Gelato, Mamamia as well as Haagen Dazs for ages. N2ICream serves well, seriously. It is highly innovative as well as, cost effective. Brownie ice cream was undoubtedly the best because, I'm a chocolate lover...haha.... But I'll not be partial regarding this. The best one was the paan-flavoured ice cream. It really made me feel whole as an Indian. That essence of being an Indian was present. I also adored the chocolate shake, yet it was very conventional. Kudos!

I try to not eat ice cream too often so whenever I do, it better be the BEST ice cream ever so I’m not wasting unhealthy/cheat meals on something not even good or worth it. But good news, the ice cream here was both good and worth it ! The thing I enjoyed the most was that when I got my ice cream, it was still hard and put together. Not soft and half in a puddle.. that’s literally the worst. Maybe that’s due to the liquid nitrogen ? I’m not too sure. I remember the last time I went out for ice cream at another place, it made me sad when they served me half melted ice cream even when they just scooped it out the carton. I still ate it though.. but what an upsetting waste of calories.
                                                                ...

This is a well decorated. Very cozy. It might be small but location is great and the Ambiance it's perfect for an Ice cream parlor. The service is good. The over cream maker will help you out as you go through the three step process of choosing your ice cream. The options are so many and the toppings are even more. There is a lot to offer and taste is splendid. Try some out of the box flavored Ice Cream/Sorbet made using Liquid Nitrogen.
Choose your base-flavour-toppings and be amazed.
Mint-Cream Base Shot is what we went for.
Each topping is 25bucks additional.
From rice crisps to Snickers you can pick anything.

The pocket pinch is worth the taste.

Definitely a great place to visit.

A really nice place. Loved the different flavors of pure ice-cream here. One of the best things is the ice-cream is not very sweet. Rather, has a tangy flavor to it which helps in not overboarding your senses and you can eat more of it at a time. Should definitely give this place a visit!

An ice cream parlour with thousands of choice and a new concept. Probably one of its kind in Kolkata who make ice cream in front of you with the help of liquid nitrogen. And by thousand of choices I actually mean THOUSANDS of choices.

We decided to go for one of their signature recipe out of 20 mentioned in their menu i.e., Nalen Gur magic and made one as we liked with Chocolate Hazzlenut flavour (cream base) and KitKat, Cashew, Chocolate Sauce as toppings.

Nalen Gur magic had Nalen Gur Sandesh and Nalen Gur as toppings, but the base cream didn't taste like famous Nalen gur flavour. If it wasn't for that Chocolate Hazzlenut I would have rated this place 2.5-3.0 max. But the Chocolate Hazzlenut  was heavenly delicious that changed my mood for good. And I would like to visit this place again for experimenting more with Chocolate Hazzlenut and regular chocolate base..

At the end, I would like to make it clear that it was all my personal opinion, and if someone decides to visit this place (which I definitely recommend) I would like to mention that this place offers endless possibilities some of which may taste heavenly and some of them may not, its all up to the person and the choices he/she makes.

The use of liquid nitrogen to create something of your choice is a huge turn on. Apart from nitrogen fixed ice cream they have a lot of toppings to choose from which includes sweets to fresh fruits, from KitKat to dry fruits. For all the ice cream lovers out there, this place won't disappoint you!
