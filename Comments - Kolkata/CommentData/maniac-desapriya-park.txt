Decent place. Less crowded. But the interior is not good. I suppose renovation is going. Quite spacious indeed. A parking place is needed i guess. I have to park by bike else where.

#Maniac the entrance to the hookah parlour is very narrow and it is not maintained properly. The interior area is also not that good... the flooring is also a decent one ..but at the right corner i could see the manhole covers and waste water is floating over the top... which is really very disgusting...the only thing what i loved was the hookah that they prepare... music system was great

A very clumsy and messy place to be in...the entrance is just a narrow space which is not well maintained at all. The only thing I liked about this place is that the Hookah they make is pretty good...they also provide a snooker board for the snooker and pool maniacs out there.

We were very hungry and needed a nice AC place to hangout with school friends. And yeah we needed hookah to cheer us up. So we decided to go to Maniac. Its a nice place to hangout with buddies. The atmosphere is good but they don't play recommend songs.
If you have good songs in your phone, they'll play that. The food is not good but it's a good place for hookah. Keep it up.

First I'd like say this place is not at all for food as food quality is a bit poor compared to other hookah bars but I still visit this place once a while just for the hookah. The quality of hookah is really great and the place charges. But small place but the ambience is nice. Perfect for a casual hangout if you wanna have some good hookah and hangout with friends.

You have such an amazing place and such a sad menu . The menu looks like it has been designed by a chef who worked in the 80s. All the items are very basic . We tried their hakaa noodles which was very good in quantity and good in taste . We wanted to experiment more with the items but sadly everything is very basic. Mocktails need improvement for sure . Everything blended with ice doesn't taste good . Tried their Indian food too which was average . Hookah is bad here . Lightning needs to be improved .. and have a more trained and versatile chef please

Well this is not even a cafe...its just a hookah bar located very close to Deshapriya Park on Sarat bose road. This place is just a small hookah bar where you can go with your close friends to chill out over a hookah. Havent tried any of their food though. the ambience is not that good but the decor is average with sports themed walls. The crowd is a bit cheap though. This place is strictly for close group of friends who wanna hangout and chill only over a hookah.

Threw my b'day party here. Loved the sporty, shady decoration. It kinda gives party vibes. We were 20 people so we were seated in the private room. Though it didn't fit everyone properly. U can play pool or watch a screening. Didn't take hookah so cannot comment on that. The food was pretty decent. Quantity wasn't bad either. It was filling. The decor was done by paper cutouts, looked cool. Stuffs were friendly and accommodating and service was also good. Light was very dim giving it a dark vibe. Not d best to click photos. Awesome place to hang out nd chill

Visited this place due to a match screening that happened there.Â 
Situated right on Sarat Bose Road near the Deshapriya Park crossing, you wouldn't miss it.Â 
The ambiance is pretty dark with all the blue lights and all. The seats are decent, the screen is quite big.Â 
We took some chicken chow here, which would have been good if not for the excessive amounts of oil they put into it.Â 
Know a friend who visits this place regularly. Good for them I guess. Personally, didn't enjoy it much. Wouldn't care to visit there again, thank you very much!

I have visited this place a couple of times mainly because my brothers insist of making this place of the "best" hookah parlours in town.
I do not like the overuse of dimly lit blue neonic effect in this place, they should really do away with it or alteast tone it down. The food is ok-ish...very mediocre.  Hookah is fine and the only thing I like about this place is the seperate room you get to yourself if you shelve out a bit more money.
I like the way they did up the small rooms with newspaper cutouts as well.

RATING GIVEN AS IT DOESNT ALLOW TO PUBLISH WITHOUT IT... (should be in Minus)Dont ever visit the place even if u getting free vouchers.... the is place not at all safe, especially for girls. This place 'Maniac hookah parlour' is filled with hooligans and cheap people who cant keep to themselves, they keep bugging you in some or the other way. there are like a dozens of them and you jus cant do anything against it as it turns out that they are all owners and owners friends... i had a hard time making them understand to not bother us or any customers, but the guy who was the manager or posed as a manager yelled and shouted on the top of his voice making a big scene and he literally had the audacity to Say that he doesnt care about customers and does not want any. THE WORST PLACE TO HANGOUT...!!!

Cheap Staff, Cheap Crowd, Please Stay Away

Visited this cafe last Sunday with my family me, my wife and brotherâ€™s n sisters between age group of 12-18.

I booked 5 packages from group on including pool game, snacks, soft drinks, and hookah.

After booking these packages I called up this cafe and asked to give us private room so kids donâ€™t bother anyone and they said ok.

When I entered cafe I directly went to private room but I saw couple where doing some wrong inside the room. I felt very awkward and I complained to one fat waiter and he said that couple is owner of cafe.

I ordered mock tail they took 1 hour to deliver and it was very bad in taste. I ordered snacks they took 2 hours to deliver and some of that was under cooked and some was over cooked overall taste was pathetic.

While waiting for our order we ordered hookah which came quite fast but hookah was choking. I requested them to please do something he said this flavour is like that only.

They have pool table which most of time occupied by local bad guys from that area ABUSING LOUDLY. At this point I felt I made a very wrong decision by visiting this cafe.

Since the order was taking too long I was playing with kids and one of the waiters came to us and in very loud and rude way asked us to stay quite.

I felt very insulting and I went to that waiter and in very polite way I was trying to explain him that this is not the way you should treat your customer.

The waiter again in very rude manner said I donâ€™t need your advice. If you want to stay you stay or get lost. I was shocked and I said I will write reviews about your cafe. Then all of a sudden those bad guys who were playing pool started abusing us and also one of the guys attacked my small brother who did nothing. We went to 3 nearest police station but all said that cafe doesnâ€™t come in our area. 

My advice is to avoid this cafe. Donâ€™t go for cheap deals you might end up in situation like this.

I have to take credit for discovering place. We were in southern avenue and wanted hookah. The nearest place I knew was Purple Turtle in Prince Anwar Shah Road. We were waiting for a taxi when we found this place. It was mind blowing. It reminded me of Curlies of Goa. As we pushed the heavy door, hookah smoke greeted us. It was mesmerising. They have got a projector and a pool table. There are also two private rooms. One in red colour and the other in blue. Paper were put up to give it a funky look. We ordered pan masala hookah. It was nice and a bit too much of charcoal. The menu has nothing good to offer plus the lack of alcohol options was disappointing. We watched live IPL. The only two things which I hated were the dirty washrooms and the crowd. Some people were openly passing comments on a girl sitting nearby. There was a altercation between the waiter and some people as they were sitting there without ordering anything. The staffs are extremely slow and lack professionalism. It's more of a underground place . its not a place for a date. I loved the place. I would request the management to control the entry and clean the washrooms.

Being a food and fun lover, I quite like to visit different restaurants.

This was my first time visit in MANIAC and the first thing that attracted me was the shadowy ambience and the Sports theme.

I was accompanied by nine of my friends.The projector in the open area with tolerable videos kept us tapping our feet.

The dim light theme was something that was enjoyed all through.

We had taken one of the two cabins. The first impression that we got from entering the cabin was horrible as because of the filthy smell from the washroom which was then on covered up by the room freshener.

The space had a TV, giving us the freedom to shuffle any of the channels and enjoying our moments.

The food was good. We particularly had snacks like Fish Fingers and Chicken dishes.

It is a great place to hangout with friends. The experience was even better with the fact that we were given Students' concession.

The ambience is very sexy.  All the flags and the teams name and the large screen for matches and stuff, gives you a full feeling of a sports arena.  Hookah is good.  Service is a bit slow and it gets a bit smokey after long shisha use.  The exhaust systems are not good.

Location: A stone's throw from Maharani.

Maniac had been on my wish list for quite sometime now and finally was visited today along with a friend early in the evening.
The AMBIANCE here is quite shady yet, not dim. The decor looked similar to that at dugout with the different sport equipments and team names on the wall but, all in a clustered manner. The place has two rooms for private sitting and a few tables in the outer section. The seating arrangement in the outer section is similar to that of Dugout but, placed without sync to the projector screen. The tables look more like a chessboard and a few have different sport fields made of neon paints. The walls inside the private rooms have pages torn of magazines and stuck around. The lighting needs drastic improvements. Maniac also has a snooker table and the selection of music was sad. The whole ambiance just didn't appeal me.

About the FOOD, we weren't in a mood to eat much, thus, ordered the following:

- Hakka Noodles
The perfectly boiled noodles was tossed along with fresh veggies and spot-on seasoning but, the whole dish had a high oil content making it lose its taste. Decent.

- Kit Kat Shake
The shake tasted good and had a generous amount of kit kat churned into it. But, the shake was a bit watery in nature as the whole thing was churned along with ice. Disappointed.

SHEESHA was found to be smoky and lasted long.

The STAFF was found to be friendly but, the SERVICE was slow.
PRICES were reasonable but, would feel a pinch in regards to the quality of food.

Overall an average experience.
- Would have rated it 1.5 stars, but, plus 0.5 for the SHEESHA.

i visited this place last week
it looks like they are busy only with the known people
the big screen does not make any sense
the staff is slow and the hookah chokes
Not a good place for someone who is looking for a classy lounge
Only good for casual hangouts
I hope next time if i visit will get a better treatment.

I with four of my friends hit this joint on ashtami afternoon. It is near desapriya park opposite monalisa guest house. It is a proper hookah bar. We took the seats on a separate room which is a half light one having red light only. I didn't like the ambiance. Very loud music was on which gave it a disc like feeling. There were very less no.of attendants and we had to buy drinking water because they dont serve it for free. We ordered chicken tandoori, paneer butter masala and butter nun. We had to wait for 40 minutes to get served. Food quality is OK -OK. Cost is a bit high. Menu is very old fashioned.

This durga puja on ashtami, was hovering near deshapriya park. Legs were paining due to excessive pandal hoping, needed a place to sit. Tummies were aching, needed a place to eat. Ashtami and getting a place in a renowned restro are two analogus concepts. My bestie remembered there was a new joint near deshapriya which was quite new, so we might as well can bag a seat out there. All decked in our ethnic attire, we reach my bestie's new found joint- MANIAC, which had an underlying caption "play, eat and rave". On entering what we notice is a skull's photo, and while entering the gate what we saw wad a blue room, and people having hookahs. And then did we realised it was a hookah bar. We found a small red room. 6 of us squeezed in and we were safe. Though I do have hookah, was not in the mood to have one. The waiter came and was surprised to hear that we wanted food and not hookah. Gave us a startled look. Then the menu was a meagre paper on which lay chinese and north indian cuisines. I wad more drawn to it considering continental cuisine as stated by zomato. There was nothing continental about the menu. When we asked the waiter whats there in continental,  he vaguely replied , " aap crispy chilli babycorn le lo". The amazed me decided to stick to something simplistic. Ordered for a chicken tandoori, paneer butter masala and butter naan. The music was too loud and hoarse. Nothing beyond honey singh made me go crazy. Because I hate his songs. The food arrived.  Did loads of photo session. Surprisingly the food was good. The tandoori chicken was smokd amad tasted amazing. The paneer butter masala was great. Barring the ambience which was typically that of a hookah bar, I give this joint 3.5 for the food that they prepare.
