Nothing too extraordinary about the shop. But you get decent Indian and Chinese food at a reasonable price. 
The dry chilly chicken and pan fried momo are must-tries!

Very ordinary restaurant. The price are reasonable. But please do not expect a great taste of food here.
The food is very much oily and the cleanliness is a big issue here.
Not recommended.

I had half a plate of chicken biryani for Rs.75 . Believe me it was the best I have ever eaten. And I eat biryani a lot. It was of the right flavour. I even had a chicken roll once. It was wonderful too.

Few of my friends reside here and we took away chicken roll, chicken do piyaza and biriyani often. Taste is ok but much more is expected from this eatery.

It's a multi cuisines fast food joint.... This place was very unhygienic, so best for takeaway .... One day I had taken a parcel, like Chicken do piyza, Chicken Roll, Egg Chicken Roll, Rumali Rotti.... All items tested good.... Staffs are fast, that's why serving time was very good.... This place was inexpensive....

This is situated near Santoshpur Bot-tala... A kind of kiosk... They have a seating arrangement for a small number of people.... Food and price are okay.... Generally well known in the locality for its rolls, chow mine, chilly chicken and roti-tarka etc.
