I went here today for a buffet breakfast.
Its just beside the Chinar park Spencer's.It has got parking space. Its newly opened.
Ambience: nice, it has a huge colored wall showing Calcutta specialities. Tables are nicely set, one can have great conversations here.
Food: the buffet spread was pretty decent. I obviously couldn't have everything.
I started with fresh fruits and juice.
I followed up with toast and sausages. Bacon was disappointing. Grilled tomato and potato wedges were done well.
I got a cheese omelette from the live station which was food, I also ordered pancakes, unfortunately they were not good at all.
They can add better cakes and desserts, as the muffins and fruit cake were hard and tasted of eggs. Definately not how a muffin should be.
The coffee served was good. 
They also had south Indian dishes and poori chola.
I would like to thank the staff who were friendly and attentive, specially our server subhadeep.
I would revisit!!

Although it's difficult to find out the way to this place, it's worth for the hurdle. Our experience from entry to exit is commendable. The restaurant is in ground floor only. We took their buffet menu. The items were limited but all are flavoursome. There were only two starters including chilly baby corn and fish fry. In salads we liked egg mayo salad and one chicken salad. In Main course each and every item was appetizing starting from rice , dal, mixed veg, continental fish, Chinese chicken, mutton biryani, chicken moghlai dish. And desserts OMG, their Shahi tookra and baked rasogolla were just mouth watering. The floor manager and staffs were very cordial and helpful. Bonus- they provide a discount for corporate people if you are carrying ur I'd card.

It's a good place for a family dine. I went yesterday with my family for dinner buffet. I met the HR manager(Mr.Arijit) there whom i know from the previous hotel. Comfortable enough. The ambience is good. Though less option in buffet but the food was good. The restaurant manager is good. He comes up to the guest table and talks with them it shows a good hospitality. Even the guest service associate gives attention in all the table and meets your need quickly. I loved the team. God bless you all. Do well.

Food was nice. Prawn and Mutton dishes were awesome. Paturi was not upto the mark. Starters were also very tasty. Overall quality and taste was really good ..

But though it says unlimited buffet yet they hesitate to provide any item if you can eat more than your limit. Soft drink such as Pepsi and Sprite was unlimited. They served first 5-6 glasses and then they started mixing water in pepsi which was really disappointing. They should have claimed a limit for the drinks if they are to serve with water mixing in it after a couple of glasses.

Nest is the only and in-house restaurant of Howard Johnson, Kolkata. The restaurant decor and paintings will blow you away! It brings out the essence of Kolkata and Durga Pujo in the best possible way. It would be unfair to define any particular cuisine for this place - the place serves everything cuisine with perfection, and you would be surprised by the perfection. They also have sundaes for the midnight range priced reasonably. The kitchen is also operational 24 by 7. They have wi fi, and a huge breakfast spread too. From simple to complex items - you name it, you get it!

# Bhanga Chora aamish Suktoni- we know that Veg Sukto is a Bengali Delicacy . But This item is made with Hilsha Fish's head and Vegetables. Its test awesome with plain steamed rice . Actually it's a Bangladeshi Cuisine. Bangladesh is the origin of this item. But it's also very popular in West Bengal, India. 

# Jhinge Aloo Posto- Jhinge Aloo Posto, or Ridge Gourd cooked with potatoes and a poppy seed paste, was very well made and dekicious.

# Kolkata Mutton Biryani-  Kolkata style Biriyani is lighter compared to other Biriyanis and uses egg and potato along with regular meat pieces. The biriyani was well cooked , aromatic and yummy with tender meat pieces.

# Faridpur Chingri Pulao- It is a Bangladeshi dish. It's a rice dish with veggies , prawns , spices added . It was wonderfully flavourful and well cooked. It was surely irresistible. A must try..!!

Howard Johnson comes to Kolkata with their newest property that adds to the beauty of the tall sky scrapers that adorn the Kolkata skyline. It’s a part of the Wyndham Hotels group that has left a distinguishable mark for its work in the hospitality sector and is the second property of the world famous Howard Johnson chain of hotels in India after the one that was launched in Bengaluru sometime ago. The newest addition to their property boasts of a majestic 90 room hotel, whose close proximity to the airport (the hotel is almost five kilometres from the hotel and it takes about fifteen minutes to reach the airport) makes it one of the most convenient luxury choice of stay for people who constantly hop in and out of planes and travel India and the world, and who live their lives one business meeting at a time. The hotel caters to the needs of the guests and extends to them a luxurious way of living that gives them that feeling of home away from home that frequent travelers and fliers often crave for. They say a house becomes a home, only when you put the family in it… well, they’re right. And that’s where the amazing staff of Howard Johnson step in and take add more stars. Seldom, you’ll find places where, the staff at luxurious hotels just lets you be, but still gives you that feeling they have all the time in the world for you. Right from the entrance, till the time when you enter your room, you are greeted and wished warmly by every staff of the place that you come across, so much so that even if you’re having a bad day, the warmth that they exude with their good wishes, slowly transforms your bad day into a good one.

It can be accessed through outside where you can walk in through the Spencer’s ( New Town ) entrance . As you enter, you walk into a small passage way with mirrors on either sides.

They have a comfortable seating with a mix of plush couches and chairs around square tables. The interiors exude an old Kolkata charm with an eclectic mix of lights, The noteworthy attraction would have to be the metal mesh work that essentially gives the place its unique vibe.

Howard Johnson, is an American chain of hotels, motels and restaurants located primarily throughout the United States and Canada. Founded by Howard Johnson. It was the largest restaurant chain in the U.S. throughout the 1960s and 1970s.  So, finally It is now in Kolkata! I was invited with my fellow foodie friends for a food tasting session at The Nest – HoJo 😊 The Nest is located in Howard Johnson Hotel, Rajarhat, Kolkata. It’s a multi-cuisine restaurant. The theme and decoration is so different and it’s awesome!! The ambiance is so cosy and comfortable.  The walls are beautifully painted. There is a seating arrangement of 40-50 people. The executives are very friendly and courteous… Overall the ambiance is very soothing 😊…Let’s come to the food …Dishes they served to us are…

“GREAT SERVICE AND DECOR”
I enjoyed a buffet Lunch here. The quality of the food was very good indeed. The decor was pleasantly air conditioned, with good quality furniture and Paintings. The food was plentiful and any eggs or other dishes that you wanted were cooked freshly for you. Value for money here.

Newly opened property Howard Johnson Kolkata, located just opposite Aminia ,chinar Park and beside the Spencer. visited there, ambiance is quite trendy and  staffs are courteous. The decorations gives u a wonderful feel. 
Nest is the 24 hours multi-cuisine restaurant, had an amazing dining experience. Great food. Good service. Were served by Avijit, friendly and ambient. He suggested us the food and nice mocktails, Hare aur safed phool ka guldasta, and patyala  kadhai murgh was really lip smacking. Chef was very humble, took every feedback and personlized food preferences for our table, offer complimentary dessert for our first visit to Nest,  and looking forward to come again. Cheers.
