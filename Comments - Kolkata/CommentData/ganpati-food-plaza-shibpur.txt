Nothing can be worser than Ganapati Food plaza. One of the worst experiences ever. One Simply cannot find out the difference in the quality of foods between Ganapati food plaza and a street food vendor. 

A friend of mine ordered for a lunch meal from Ganapati food plaza and made the payment online a week ago, and yet the food is not delivered. But they charged for the food. 
If there had been an option, I had definitely rated them 0.
Thanks.

A good option for people who want to hav a home style cooked meal delivered at their doorstep. It's basically a thali comprising 5 rotis, two sabzis, dal, rice, papad and pickle. The quantity an quality you get for 130rs is unbelievable. After the end of the meal, you will never feel you've had restaurant food. It's just like home cooked food ( only a lil more special). Overall, definitely recommended. Just call on the number mentioned on Zomato and they'll deliver as less as just one thali.

They are railway caterers basically. Never visited this place however had their thalis. Its decent Rajasthan food with 2 variety of sabji and 1 daal and roti and a portion of rice.
Preferably for home delivery.
