All I want to point out to those who have not been here before is
‚Ä¢pocket friendly
‚Ä¢food is average 
‚Ä¢easy to locate ( opposite Barrackpore railway station)
‚Ä¢very small place (though they have a banquet hall on the other floor,but that is for party bookings)
‚Ä¢may feel congested when it's crowded
‚Ä¢Stuffs are polite
‚Ä¢Sometimes they refuse to take 2000/- rupees notes.( take enough cash)

We have ordered for a home delivery, they are supposed to give us delivery within 50 mints, while in reality they gave us almost one and a half hour later, not only this we have called them for several times, but they always told us to contact with the delivery boy. When we tried to call him, he never received the call, which is really disappointing. Despite of this, the food are tastes good but they are cold. I would suggest people not to for a home delivery, go there and buy it by your own self. Because the home delivery option is just useless option if anyone is going to order it by.

I must say the new service is horrible and the staffs  r extremely  inefficient!  They don't  even know how to talk properly!  Manners are bad as well... Every time you have to ask for a spoon too in fact when they are serving soups they don't even know about the sauce vinegar  rack ! Extremely  horrible  experience  that was.

Turned up to this place super hungry, on my way back from shoot. Situated on the second floor of the building bang opposite Barrackpore station, this place is super easy to locate. The decor is basic and the service is fast. I ordered fish fingers and chicken China town. The fish fingers were decent in size. Six pieces of fresh basa strips, crumb fried, and served with mustard sauce. I loved the taste of the fish fingers, however it required some mayonnaise to add some creaminess to the dry texture of the crumb coating. The chicken china town was the show stopper. Four pieces of huge and chunky tandoori chicken, cooked in a hot and sour chinese sauce. Though it is named China town, however the dish was miles away from Chinese cuisine. Never had any such preparation ever in my life, but it tasted heavenly.

After the scrumptious protein diet, wanted to end my meal with a soulful dessert. Saw Belgian sundae on the menu and my stomach jumped for it. What appeared on the table was a bit of a disappointment though. It was Rollick's Belgian Chocolate cup. It tasted great. Smooth texture and loads of choco chips, however it definitely isn't a sundae that I wanted to have. And specially because it is a packaged product, there's no point of writing an incorrect name in the menu. The management should take care about it.

Overall it was a good experience. Recommend.

The decor nd ambience is simple yet cosy though they don't open d curtains now nd its kinda dimly lit. I hv visited this place a number of times. My first visit included an order of peas polao nd chicken tikka masala wid a kesar coolfie ice crm..it was a pocket friendly nd good meal. However my second visit left me disappointed. Had ordered Basanti polao nd kadai paneer wid Belgium sundae. Everything ws perfect except d rice which tasted like biriyani left over rice. Still as its a restaurant close to home gave it a try once agn nd this time it ws mixed gravy noodles with drums of heaven. Tasted really good. So I kind of treat dat bad experience of mine as a sheer bad luck nd also visited recently..perfect tandoori roti nd masala kulcha nd chicken hundi. So would recommend this place for a pocket friendly meal. Enjoy!üòä

Its easy to detect..pretty easily accessible place. Entrance is a bit of an off but once in ambience is sober and quiet. Coming to food..Drums of Heaven is a must try for people with a chatpata tongue. It's awesome. Chicken China Town is simply an indian starter offered on the chinese starters!üò® Do be pretty sure to know what u r ordering..
Although main course offers both Indian and Chinese cuisines its better to order Indian food. Chinese menu is better left to the more experienced places. The Indian menu is not that extensive but covers the basic. Biriyani is quite good, and at times may taste better than what Dada Boudi offers.
2 things which u might find attractive is that they offer wi-fi with a good speed and also a "paan" as dessert(complimentary)! Cleanliness is a thumbs up too...

Me and my team were working at Barrackpore Railway station and wanted to have a quick lunch. We spotted kurri klub right outside the station. We decided to try it. It's a very small place on the second floor of an old building. The furniture is all Wooden like it was in old times. We took our table and immediately ordered without wasting. 

We asked for Aaloo dum, Dal Makhni, Corn and Capsicum, Roti and Jeera Rice. The service is very slow. It took them more than 20 minutes to serve. 

But, when the food was served in our plate, we realised, it was worth it! Everything was fresh and delicious with right amount of spices for summers. We ate non-stop till we finished the food. The staff was very courteous and the star element was the bill. It was dirt cheap for the quantity they served with that awesome taste! 

If you are around this area, please try it out and you will have a tasty experience! They Serve you sweet Pan as mouth fresher which brightens your mood!!

Went quite a few times
Famous for the exquisite cuisines and it does justify its fame
This time went for chicken biriyani and handi chicken and to my utter disbelief three among six pieces of chicken pieces was burned to charcoal
Couldn't eat more than three pieces for this matter
Though a no brainer for food the authority must rectify this kind of incidents

Went for lunch on the day of Saraswati puja, ordered for mixed fried rice and chicken manchurian. We were well assisted while ordering the food, and the food was exactly how it was described. Ingredients were fresh and not disgraceful at all. Had a great time there.

Older review- I was about to rate it 4 but then I was forced to change my mind. I had chicken biriyani here. When I put the first bite in my mouth it tasted really good but after a few moments, the Biriyani got worse it did not have any gravy, it was so dry and tasteless that it was impossible to eat. Somehow managed to complete it. Though the chicken was good, soft and tasty. Overall ambience is good. Waiters a little unprofessional and the food is hopefully good if you order something other than Biriyani.
Newer Review - Visited this place again today and have to say there's a lot of improvement and the Biriyani tasted just awesome. Thanks to the management to take my review seriously and taking proper actions. Thanks.

We have ordered for Fish Butter Fry today. It was without any salt, soggy, tasteless. Total letdown. Not worth the name, no sign of butter, not worth the cost. Only plus point is the fresh fish fillet inside. Just cannot give anymore rating.

Situated just above the vcafe bar...at 2nd floor..... Opposite Bkp station ..at west side....the restaurant looks good...had nice large windows.... Nice view of barrackpore station... Come to decor ambience behavior all avg....vat applicable on food.... We ordered polau kulcha and mutton rogan josh....food was avg...kulcha good,polau avg - not that which we wanted to have ,and rogan Josh good but the 4 th piece was only bone with tendons.....so I am giving 3.5 over all....u people can try this...overall good eatery....

Went there on 14/2/2016 orderd chicken drums of heaven and mix Hakka chow .the food was good..place was packed with love birds .....nice place to dine in for a nice day... So I am promoting it ...and giving it a 4 out of 5 rating

22/2/2016 tasted their chicken Manchurian and veg fried rice...fried rice was OK....but it wasn't chicken Manchurian... It tasted like chilli chkn.... So as par price point this is a bit disappointing to me.....

I have decided to visit this restaurant after getting good reviews from zomato. Finally after a long days planning visited this place on the evening of Navami during Durga puja. As we were not so much hungry we ordered Chicken drums of heaven and Chicken tandoori. The ambiance and the decor of this place was nice. The staffs were well behaved and the service was very prompt. The quantity was enough and the price was also very reasonable. Last but not the least the taste of both the Chicken item was too good. I loved the Chicken drums of heaven most as it was perfectly juicy, spicy and yummy. At the end they served misti paan as complementary that was surprisingly nice.. :-) My experience for first time visit was nice and I would surely like to visit for many more times.

A good place where ambience steals the show. This peaceful dark themed restaurant has a very courteous service. The dim lights and comfortable chairs with air conditioned room gives you a surprise. An underrated restaurant for sure. The location is perfect. Its right beside the Barrackpore Railway Station, above the V-Cafe. Just because its placed above the famous and over-priced  V-Cafe, people bad mouth it. Be ready to be surprised by its amazing food and ambience. A romantic ambience, to be exact. A great restaurant if you want to spend some time talking in a quiet place with no one to disturb you (unless the place is cramped with children who do not know how to behave in a public area). Surprisingly, this place has a restroom as well. Not too hygienic but what other options do you have. I have been to this restaurant four times and it never disappointed me. Avoid going during daytime, or else you will never enjoy the ambience it provides.

Due to navratri, I was restricted to eating vegetarian items only. So I opted for Mushroom Masala and Veg Schezwan Noodles. Both dishes were extremely delicious. The mushrooms were cooked thoroughly and the noodles were a bit too spicy, but i guess I saw that coming because i opted for Schezwan. The gravy was quite thick. I gladly munched on the succulent mushroom pieces. The Dum Aloo Kashmiri is a dish where we get huge pieces of potatoes cooked in a rich, non spicy masala gravy. I was not that satisfied with Chicken Hundi. It contained large chunks of onion, which is not quite appealing to your taste buds. The Reshmi Chicken Tikka Masala goes well with the Plain Nan. Boneless pieces of Chicken, soft and well cooked with a spicy gravy, with is smooth and will make you crave for more. Avoid the Butter Nan. They never add the butter, instead they add oil and the nan becomes oily and your hands become greasy. Lastly, they accept cards. It was a blessing because I had run out of cash. Many restaurants claim that they have Card privileges but they don‚Äôt. Avoid ordering Biriyani, because if you had to order Biriyani, you might as well just go to Dada Boudi for that.

I adored this local eatery from where I expected the least. I will definitely go back there again, to try some non vegetarian dishes.

Great place just near the Railway Station. The place is small but the ambiance is super awesome specially at night. With a dark ambiance and low hanging dim lights it creates the perfect atmosphere for a nice dinner along with conversation. Its quiet and cold and cozy. The food comes in ample quantities. Quite a lot to be honest. The Mushroom Masala tasted great. The Hakka Shezwan Chicken was good too. The biriyani was dry so was the chicken piece but it tasted above average. Overall great place to have dinner with your partner or family. Definitely going back here.

Barrackpore is not a place with many good options for dining out. Karri Club is definitely the best you can get in Barrackpore. Don't expect the same food taste as famous Kolkata restaurants here, but what you get is value for money. A bit too spicy and oily for my liking, but the food is definitely tasty and fresh. If you are looking for dining out in Barrackpore, then this is the best bet. Most other restaurants in this area will hardly get a 2.5 rating.

Its a very cost effective but unique one in d heart of barrackpore station area..
As already others hav sooken of, yes the ambience has nothing special to draw your attention, but from a restaurant of this genre what we expect at d end is the quality of food as a primary parameter. Coz its what we foodies finally crave for.. a good food dat tickles our taste buds with minimal pocket pinch.
And this is where Karri Klub is quite successful. The menu served here is not out of d world but every dish u will get is carrying impressive taste..!!
Also, their home delivery option is an add on advantage for d lazy lads like me..
Must try if u r in Barrackpore

Its one of my food parlour. I used to visit here on every week sometimes its month.. The space is little,food quality is still good. Behaviours of the waiters are also good nd helpful. We organise a farewell party one of our friend. They arranged whatever we need for the farewell which we ordered.. We really enjoyed. Its a perfect place for get together.

Been here many times!
Space is lilttle.
They used to serve pasta,sizzler etc-continental dishes,they have closed entire cuisine due to lack of foodies!
Being a foodie,it gives me pain to see this! :(
So the items are same as you get in hotels at barrackpore!
But their dishes are good, I love tandoori chicken butter masala, cheese chili garlic nun!
Last visit was not too good,felt - quality is degraded a bit.

Average food, okay on the pocket and a good enough location. Situated just beside the Barackpore station campus, the place provides a good view of the adjoining areas along with the food. The space however is a little congested and as long as you don't mind that, the place is worth a visit especially for their Chinese preparations.

Very good food on reasonable price at barrackpore station area where hard to find a good restaurant, because all are there is street food available. I have taken kadhai paneer, crispy chili babycorn and tandoori roti. All these items were very good. One problem this place has and that is the space. And all other points are okay. Very good food station at very congested area  but the food is very good.

First and foremost I found it a quite a hectic job to climb up the stairs to 2nd floor to reach the restaurant when someone is tired and drenched in sweat with pavlov bell ringing hard. The food quality is about average. They also serve egg with biriyani although the chicken and potato with it could have been cooked better. They also offer a welcome snack (chips made of rice). The thing which I didnt like that they take lots of time after placing order which will make your hunger die. Overall its an average place to dine in.

This is a new restaurant that happened to barrackpore in recent past. Situated right opposite to the station at the 2nd floor of the same building of vcafe.

Ambiance - its average with some wooden interiors and nothing special to mention sitting arrangements. The crowd is usualy good , mainly family and couples.

Food- the best thing about this restaurant is their food. Both quality and quantity wise ,they serve tasty and huge portions of food. The price is very very reasonable for the portions and quality they serves.

Service - decent and courteous waiters are always ready for your help. Time to time serving of water or food are nicely done.

I will suggest them to improve the interiors and the sitting arrangements

Karri klub is one my favourite place to hang out with friends at Barrackpore.
It all started when i was first introduced to this place by my friend..from then onwards i am a regular visitor over there.
Karri klub have small space capacity but they have the most awesome view of Barrackpore station area.. As it is just the opposite of Barrackpore station and situated at 2nd floor.. if you have the adjacent seat to the glass windows.. You will have an amazing view.
The interiors are average.. Wooden chairs and tables.
Even the food is great and quantity is good.The place have very courteous staff very well mannered.
And top it all the price of this place is reasonable.
Total thumbs up for Karri klub.. Keep up the good job.

Update: I have just rated it 3 from previous 5. The place was unique in its platter offerings and now removed most of our favorites. You can avoid it!

Initial response : 
I am rating it 5/5 because of its variety in items offered. Owned by a food enthusiastic man this restaurant is the best place in Barrackpore. Offers sizzler and Mediterranean foods too! Main area is small but AC is good. Just opposite to Barrackpore Station, in the V Cafe building at 2nd floor. It can arrange your parties on rooftop too.
