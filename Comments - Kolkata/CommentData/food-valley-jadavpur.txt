I only had food once  from the second floor and it was years back... so i hardly remember it
But the first floor take away counter is something I visit often... the price is moderate but you would hardly find it hygienic since it is a fast food joint and that also just on the crossroads
However their rolls are awesome... both the chicken roll and the egg roll.. so you can give it a try for their rolls... plus,  their billing system is good... you pay the bill first and the bills are numbered making sure the person who ordered first gets their food first

First and foremost, this is situated NOT in Jadavpur but in Baghajatin crossing , near Kamdhenu Sweets. Have visited this place loads of times (well renowned or grossly underrated in my opinion, for their Chicken Rolls and quantity of their food) but sadly enough, quality has dropped. 

This time we only ordered a Veg Hakka Noodles. The quantity was sufficient for two. But coming to the taste, it was average just like any other chowmin from a roadside stall. It was less oily though and was still tasty. Will continue to order from this one though.

PS- In our previous visits, we have tried the chicken roll. Around 4 to 5 pieces of soft chicken sauteed in onions (Kolkata roadside stall speciality). This is delicious and equally filling.

Have been in love with their plain tadka, chicken tikkia and roomali rooti for ages now. Pocket friendly and tastes amazing. Used to be a takeaway place before but now they offer dine-in too.

The food is good. Price is reasonable. Just a little slow on the service. Overall a good place to hangout during anytime of the day. 
However I badly miss the Biriyani they used to make. I don't know why, but they stopped making them. It was excellent and delicious and pocket-friendly! I hope that it comes back soon.

Located jst at Baghajatin crossing..reasonable price..their thupka tastes awwsomee..other dishes also ok..but in terms of cleanness, not so well, behaviour is just like "you went to make them pleased. They are the king"
That's unexpected..approx cost for two 300/-.

This is a hotel upstairs and also has a tiny outlet downstairs for takeaways.

Decided to try out the rolls here. The rolls in kolkata have always been my favorite. They have enough chicken and are spicy. Had a chicken and egg roll which were as good as the better ones in hyderabad.
Had mixed fried rice late on from upstairs, the tiny prawns add to the taste of the fried rice and has enough chicken in it as well.

Just an okay place to visit and have food. Don't expect much.

Food: 3/5
Service: 2.5/5

This place is for people who are hungry and want Bengali food (mach-baath/mangsho-baath) within a reasonable price. Don't ask me about ambiance, I never bother about ambiance and service for lunch/dinner at a price of 40. Food is not bad at all, many nights I had that food happily, even with friends.

It's at the Baghajatin more. Aside the auto stand.
They make tasty rolls. But definitely very oily. There noodles prep r okay types. Don't expect health here as I said fast food joint it is! There side dish preparation s r normal, fine.
If u r hungry nd need food early, dis is ur place. Grab a roll or a half plate chow, u will b done wid ur hunger. Taste of the food r not bad at all but much oily like every other fast food.

I recommend food valley as a take away joint.
Its small and clumsy but very popular in and around baghajatin for its tadka, tikia and rumali roti.
Must have:
Tadka, tikia fry.
I recommend this place as a take away joint.
No idea about the restaurant.

Situated at the crossroads of Baghajatin more, this a fast food takeaway corner. They also have an upper seating section, mostly for lunchtime only where they serve basic veg and non-veg Bengali dishes. That part is an okay one, clean and affordable. Coming to their fast food section in which they have a great sell from evening onwards, I "Dislike" the rolls (though they sell that very much). I have tried numerous times their rumali roti, tarka, chilly chicken, fried rice. chowmin- and these are good ones given the prices from a local area shop. A sudden guest in your house in this area, and food valley can give you some quick tasty options.And also biriyani, which is not too good.
No home delivery system. Am a customer since last 7 years!

This is mainly a take away restaurant,  they serve some tadka of fabulous taste, with rumali roti.. Rolls are also appreciable.  They got a centre position of baghajatin more. Just at the bus stand. Every body should try this pocket friendly take away counter!!

food valley is well known food joint located at the baghajtin intersection. this food joint sells the regular rice daal and sabzi in the afternoon and Chinese by night+regular rice daal and sabzi. i have never tried the Chinese here but the regular rice daal and sabzi they serve is quiet delicious a regular plate will cost u around 30 and a spcl plate will cost you round 35 rs. the food is good and if u live in pg like me such places were u get proper and hygienic food is a great relief. my review 4/5.
