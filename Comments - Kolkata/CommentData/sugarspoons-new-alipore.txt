Sugarspoons makes mouth watering chocolates which melts in your mouth and has a wonderful taste. I tried the Ganache chocolates which were filled with thick liquid chocolate. You just cannot miss out on this.

Baked with love.. Should be the tagline of sugarspoons !! When someone like sugarspoons team is so passionate about baking cakes or preparing those delicious chocolates you automatically fall in love with amazing confectionary they make. I had opportunity to try several chocolates & cupcake & cake from the menu. It was a delightful experience to say the least. The truffle chocolates & truffle cake being my favourite. Its a must have for every1 around Kolkata.
Specially for people who prefer eggless. Its a great bargain & a very friendly baker to assist you with right choice according to your taste preference.
