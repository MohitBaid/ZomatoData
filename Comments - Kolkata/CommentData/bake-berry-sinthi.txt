I ordered White forest cake for my friend from Lucknow. Ma'am was very cooperative. The cake was delivered on time and I am told that it was delicious and freshly baked. I wanted a little note with the cake which was written by her. She also sent a Brownie as a token which was very sweet of her.

Ordered assorted cupcakes . Taste of cupcakes was very disappointing. Also the cupcakes were a bit hard. I had to pay extra 100 for delivery which was not mentioned in app. Lookwise it was good, packing was also nice

Had ordered  a graduation cake for my brother. It turned out very tasty. The  quality of the cake was very good and the price was very economical. The fondant work on top was professional enough. 
Om another occasion had ordered some cookies and muffiins in a gift hamper. They were packed beautifully and mafe with a lot of care. The handmade cookies at that price was a steal.  Very professional done and delivered quite far from their place of operation without a hitch. All the best for future

This lipsmacking cake was ordered by me for my lovely mother in Kolkata on her birthday. Everyone at my home loved every bite of this cake. The finishing of this cake itself tells with how much love and care it is prepared. I would recommend everyone should order cake from BAKEBERRY for their loved and dear ones. Kudos for the every member behind Bakeberry team, who are working hard to cherish the beautiful  moments for their customers. 

My best wishes are with Bakeberry & team.

From a delighted customer.
