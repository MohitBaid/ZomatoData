Located just opposite of Medical College in CR Avenue. The place looks old and dim. I tried their Chowmine which wasn't very likeable. Quality was average. Prices are low.

Appayan is located just opposite of Medical College near Central Metro on CR Avenue. I went there at evening 7:30 when they were closing the place. Got to try just Egg Chowmine here. Taste was really poor. Chowmine was very thin and they mistakenly made it much salty which made it awful.
Bitter experience.
Prices are high by the standard they serve. And there is nothing called ambiance here.
Better to avoid.

I took a visit to this roadside restaurant on an afternoon after completing some shopping at Burrabazar on the day of Panchami. Location opposite to the Medical College over Central Avenue, I decided to have a quick bite here instead of a complete lunch. The restaurant provides options of Chinese, Indian and Bengali dishes, variety ranging from chow mein, roll, rice thali with options of fish curry, daal (pulses), egg curry, omlette curry, and so on. With all seats literally booked with people having lunch, I decided to parcel a Chicken Roll. Sadly, it was a letdown being priced at 45 bucks. Even though the paratha was good, but the chicken provided came with too much spice and gravy (Which gave me a feeing that the chicken were given straight from the chicken curry that are given with roti or rice). Even more shockingly, the chicken had pieces of bones within. Overall, even though it quenched my hunger, but it was just somehow being done.

This small establishment located opposite Medical College Eye Dept, is on the go-to list for all us doctors who are bored with the mundane canteen food. Especially when we need some snacks during tedious duty hours, or the occasional 5 min coffee breaks..
Well, the place serves a mean coffee with sprinkled coffee powder on top -- tailored to our needs of keepin awake for long hours. The Mughlai, Plain paratha, hakka chowmein, rolls etc are also tasty if u can overlook all the surplus oil. During lunch, they serve rice meals though Iv never tried them. The egg tadka roti combo is rather decent. 
The place is easy on the pocket and quantity sufficient. 
With a prime location and fixed clientele, they could spruce up the place a little. Though it does have its own old world charm, havin fed generations of doctors before us...

I would go back again and again just for the coffee, certified caffeinaholic that I am !

Decent food served here. Located on chittranjan avenue opposite medical college gate 6.. I visit here for lunch. The fish rice or paratha with chicken manchurian is my usual preference. Gets very crowded during lunch hours

Small outlet and service is good. Rice items are their speciality. I liked most their mughlai cuisine and Friedrice. Chinese is also good and price was also friendly.

This is a place i visit rarely... The food is average..the hospitality is good..for evening snacks you could try out  the moghlai which is good in pocket pinching budget..The place is good...If u are in Central Avenue area and somewhat hungry u can try this out...Don't ever go for Chilli Chicken there its horrible... Otherwise a nice place to have some snacks in low range...

Nice food at reasonable cost . A fish meal is very filling. But paratha and chili chicken are s hit.
