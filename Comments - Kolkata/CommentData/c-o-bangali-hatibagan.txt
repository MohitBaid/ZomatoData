Me & my husband visited the restaurant today for lunch. The worst experience one could have about food is what we got here. The food is a bit over priced & absolutely taste less. I recommend people not to visit here.

Yesterday I was there for the XMas special dinner. We had Jungli whole murgi, vetki kalia, rice, tandoor roti, and seafood salad. The Chicken was a lil undercooked since we had a hard time tearing the pieces down. Rest of the foods were up to the standard.

This restaurant is very easy to locate, just opposite to Star theatre (Hatibagan 4 point crossing)..been there with my family..
Surrounded with soothing air conditioned atmosphere and nice interior decoration  with pictures of bengali eminent people the outlet seems family friendly..coming to main part i.e food- I have ordered chicken tandoor combo- 4 types of kebabs - Malai kebab, zafrani kebab, pahari kebab, chicken tikka..all are very delicious and soft.. also ordered chinese combo - Drums of heaven, chilli chicken, noodles and fried rice...Staffs are very courteous and well behaved.. Overall it was a good experience... can't give less than 4.5... Recommended :-) :-)

This place pretty easy to locate at Hatibagan crossing..the ambience is praiseworthy..modern decor..giving a feel for the modern day bengali cuisine..
Service a tad bit slow i must say..
We ordered plain rice..well good enoug..basmati rice at its best..the aroma itself is enough..
The moong dal was too good..authentic and lovely..
The alu bhaja was good as well..
The doi potol was a killer dish..rich curdy gravy with simply cooked potol..i loved it..
The tel koi..the gravy was lacking salt..and the fish was not that fresh..
This fishy stuff..was confirmed wen we got chital petir kalia..it was smelling too..
The bhetki paturi was good..but still i think the fish could have been fresher..so overall an average end to an exciting food journey..
No added tax..thats the best part..

I hadn't come across a single restaurant where I had loved each and every dish, until I visited C/O Bangali. I was here a couple of weeks ago with my friends, and we had ordered Fish Fry and Prawn Cutlet for the starters, and Misti Pulao, Chingri Marich Pulao, Chital Muitha, Kacha Lonka Murgi, and Goan Fish Curry for the main course.
 
Here are my quick ratings -

4/5 for the food - While a lot of you might think that C/O Bangali serves only Bengali cuisine, I’d like to quickly clarify that it is a multi cuisine restaurant that serves Bengali, North India, Chinese, Goan, Continental and Tandoor dishes. Majority of our dinner comprised Bengali food items, baring one i.e the Goan Fish Curry. Every single item seems to be made with a lot of love and care, as each of them carry a distinct flavour, all of which is sure to please your taste buds. The quantity served in each dish is good enough for two people. My favorite pick from the super awesome assortment of dishes is Chingri Marich Pulao and Kacha Lonka Murgi. Both the dishes are super spicy (true to what’s promised in the name of the dish), and the combination goes absolutely well. The chicken pieces are big yet tender and juicy, holding the spicy-sour flavor of the green gravy in which it’s cooked. One quick feedback on the Chingri Marich Pulao - the quantity of prawns/shrimps is extremely low. We had to literally hunt for the prawns in the dish.

5/5 for the ambience: The restaurant is properly ventilated with ACs in every corner. The interiors will give you a very pleasant, archaic, Calcutta feel. The brick walls have displays of beautiful caricatures of famous people from West Bengal. 

3/5 for the price: The prices of the food items are a bit on the higher side. 

2/5 for the service: While the waiters are friendly and extremely helpful in giving suggestions about food combinations, their service is super super slow, and needs to be improved asap.

Will I visit again? - Yes, definitely! :)

Bengali cuisine is all about varieties of food prepared with selective spices and different types of ingredients. here you will find one particular dish but the making process is different as well as the taste. in Kolkata right now a numerous number of Bengali restaurants are opened different parts of the city. most of the dishes are quite similar, but it is quite obvious that every restaurant has their own signature dishes. if you love to eat fish and want to try lip-smacking dishes then you have to visit Kolkata as well as “C/o. Bangali” for sure. this particular joint is located walking distance from the Shovabazar Metro station, in the middle of Hatibagan more. around 40-45 seater, decorative walls where you will find the famous characters od Bengali Cinemas.

One of the best in line is a Bengali fusion eatery called C/O Bengali . Located 108, Aurobindo Sarani, 4 Point Crossing, Near Star Theatre, Hatibagan, Kolkata. The restaurant is all about delicious and healthy Bengali dishes offering a huge variety to choose from. A revolutionary hit in the menu which is surely a blend of culinary brilliance and innovation has been the C/O Bengali . The owner Mr.Santanu Banerjee is a very passionate man when it comes to serving authentic and lip-smacking food and he himself takes  due care about the quality of the dishes. C/O Bengali recently added many new options in the menu and I tried few of the signature dishes  and was left spellbound. Each dish was so delicately prepared, bringing out the exact taste of condiments used that will surely leave you craving for more. I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance of this place , the dim lighting makes the place elegant at evenings & nights.

Amidst the hustle bustle of Hatibagan, stands elegantly this restaurant catering to the authentic Bengali cuisine cravings of foodies. C/o Bangali. Indeed, your hunger is completely taken care of when at this place. This place has beautifully adorned interiors with photo frames, lamps and hangings. 
Coming to the food, you must try the Joljeera mojito. It's fresh, tickles your taste buds and makes you want to sip more of it. 
 I have tried the Basanti pulao and Chhanar Dalna . Basanti Pulao was delicious and was perfectly complemented by the Chhanar dalna. 
Also, as a part of the new menu launch, I tried the Malpua and Caramel Custard. Both were delectable and proved to be  great desserts after  meal. 
Bengali food cravings just got another splendid place in North Kolkata to get fulfilled. Do drop by this place!

Located just opposite Star Theatre,this place is a বাঙালি's delight!
Quite spacious the restaurant also houses a dimsum station. The sezwan momo,prawn momo and the chicken cheese dimsum were delectable. The filling is good sized with the cover being thin and transparent.
Coming to the main course the Ilish and herb biriyani was fantastic with the flavour of hilsa singing through every biteful, the kanchalanka murg was fiery and spicy, the samudra or the prawn biriyani was flavourful,the gondhoraj murg and malai methi murg melt in one's mouth. The chicken pieces are succulent and juicy.
For desserts I had the warm malpua which took us to dessert paradise!
I've kept the starter for the last as it needs special mention. The sundori murg is a must try.

I don't know how to tell my experience the average waiting time is around 45-50 minutes which make me feel like beggars waiting for food. Even though I have ordered for starters that made me sit around half an hour. I completely feel they have shortage of staff.

Ok now first the ambience... It's just 😍.... We love it...
Then service ..that was good...and they are polite...
Food was yummy....👌
For starters we ordered pan fried chilli fish with  fresh lime soda and mongo juice... That fish preparation was perfect  .
Then we ate mixed thai rice... It had the flavour of "gandharaj lebu"... 👌, Then sezwan rice.. it was too spicy .🌶🌶🌶🌶🔥🔥....huuuffff.... But taste na nice.. Hunan chicken... Good ... Shanghai chicken was delicious... Mixed rice ...and green salad as usual..👍
But ...yes here is one but... The restaurant was almost empty...because we went there in week days...they were very late ... Because our  one item was very spicy so we ordered normal mixed rice.. they served it almost after 20-25 mnt!!! 
Beside it...all over experience was very nice ...we enjoyed a lot there ...

A nicely started dinner date spoiled by a stale Baked Fish!
This restaurant  ia situated just oppostie of Star theater and very nicely decorated to give you a splash of old kolkata charm (The marble floor looks like chess board)

Equipped with Nearbuy coupons, we ordered
1. KEBAB PLATTER - This was having 8 pcs of 4 different kebabs. All were flavoured differently. texture was smooth and meat was soft! A great one to start your journey

2. CHICKEN BELLE HEAVEN - Chicken stiffed with cheese and baked with cheese on top, this dish was really nice. They grilled mushrooms served with this diah, were topped with lemon butter sauce and was awsome in taste. Some boiled veggies were also there. Overall a very good amd filling entreé.

3. FISH CHEESE ON HERBS -Imagine how a dish woyld taste if made with Stale Bhetki! When I ran the fork through the fish cube, got a weired smell but still dared to try. It was so smelly that I was about to puke! We called a staff to complain and that guy told this is the smell of the herbs used in process. He was even trying to proove that we never had baked fish earlier and this is the taste and smell that dish would have anywhere. They took the fish to kitchen and confirmed it was smelling foul. after 15-20 mins, they replaced the fish and we got the same smell and didn't dared to touch.

Good location and ambience wont work well if food is not upto the mark. After having first two dishes, i had built quite a high expectation and this was shattering

A good place for dinner in the heart of north Kolkata ! A few minutes walk from shyambajar more seeing the colorful shops at the sides of road ,finally reached the place ! Ambience was good enough ,staff a few but the atmosphere was really good with the solo music at the background !
then the food 
ordered coxbajar murg(3pcs :actually all the non veg items are of 3 pcs there) ,butter naan ,luchi (6pcs in a plate),payes !
coxbajar murgh masala was a bit spicy but the quantity was enough and tasty though ! 
payes was really awesome and the pure bengali taste of it really made it delicious !last of all an information for everyone menu there was all inclusive of tax !!! 
WILL go there again !!
staff facilities and a liitle bit quality issue ,otherwise good place at a reasonable price !!

The only disappointment was the staff. They are not at all trained. We had to ask for water for several times.  Food service was slow.

Bengali without food is just beyond imaginable specially when the festive mode is on. We went there at the time of durga puja to have our lunch. As it was the time of the biggest bengali festival so we thought why not to have some traditional bengali dishes. It is located near hatibagan market. The ambience was very comfortable. Besides the traditional bengali dishes they also serves Chinese dishes.
Now coming to the food items, we ordered paneer pulao and on the recommendation of the waiter we ordered B. N. R mutton curry as our side dish.
The Pulao was awesome with the aroma of ghee and the chunks of paneer and that mutton curry satisfied our taste buds with its spices and aroma. The curry had 3 pieces of mutton and one potato. The mutton was very soft and succulent... We just loved the combination of paneer pulao and the curry. Lastly we had caramel custard as dessert but I really didn't love it. Overall my experience was quite satisfying. I can't rate this bengali cuisine less as I loved the other dishes.

Asking the waiter they said " jaani na " no initiative to receive a customer rude behavior  and no service quality..  The place was stinking might be due to last night rush, but a restaurant must have it's quorum..  I rate 1/2 star

Mainly food quality was good enough even in puha duration.
We didn't taste many dishes (they had limited dishes for puja) though we had a plan to taste more.

Visited this restaurant today in Hatibagan area for filling our empty stomachs after a prolonged pandal hopping with friends. We were a group of 8 people that's why we had to wait for around 1 hour to get our table. In this auspicious day of Navami the waiting was quite expected but the foods they served compensated the time. Our today's order included,
* Basanti Pulao - 5 plates
* Mutton Rogan Josh - 2 plates
* Mutton Rezala - 1 plate
* Chicken Fried Rice - 1 plate
* Schezwan Chicken - 1 plate
The foods were served within 20 minutes. Though the service was a bit slow during peak Puja hours but the foods tasted pretty good. Basanti Pulao tasted good. Mutton Rogan Josh definitely needs a special mention. Quantity and quality both was great. Overall a very nice experience. Surely recommended.

I visited this place on Panchami,  the manager made us share the table with other customers  without taking our permission  moreover he said only limited  menu are available  as such he on our behalf  ordered the food without  asking us about our taste.  We left the restaurant so,  I can not comment on food as we did not had any but the behaviour of the manager  and the arrangements  were bad as hell. I will never  visit  that place again.

Located near Star Theater, Hathibagan this place immediately caught our attention for the Bengali food lover inside us during the pujas.

Starters : Gondharaj Chicken
Main Course : Steam Plain Rice, Tel Koi, Mutton Kosha.
Food was JUST okay.

Service : Not sure if it is only during the festival, but very less and confused staff and late service. Lengthy billing process.

This Bengali themed restaurant serves great Bengali and Chinese food at a reasonable price. It has a lovely decor that instantly makes you feel cozy. There is a touch of Bengal in every nook and corner of the place as the name suggests.
We ordered paneer polao. The waiter advised us to go for B. N. R. Mutton curry and we took his advice. The polao was extremely delicious. The rice was soft and the ghee and paneer were present in just the right amount. We can't thank the waiter enough for suggesting that delectable dish of mutton! It had three pieces of large and succulent mutton. The curry tasted great. It's neither too spicy nor too bland. It was just perfect and tasted great with the polao. We ordered caramel custard for dessert. This was the first time I tasted this dessert which is usually loved by all. I must say I hated it, maybe because I neither like caramel nor am I a huge fan of custard.
We went on the day of ponchomi and the place was crowded. Fortunately we didn't need to stand in the queue. Maybe that is the reason why the service was painfully slow. I would really like to give the place a second try because there's so many dishes to explore which have highly appealed to me! Overall a great experience!

Half of the food mentioned on the menu weren't available. The food was of not up to the expectation, and the quality was also not up to the expectation. When enquired about the poor customer service, the manager gives an excuse that  his staff members went away few days earlier. It's better to close the restaurant and not serve food if such is the case rather than giving such excuses.

পঞ্চমীর দিন দুপুরে কলকাতার উত্তরাঞ্চলের যাবতীয় ঠাকুর দর্শন সেরে নিতে গিয়ে হাতিবাগানের মোড়ে পৌঁছে পেটে ছুঁচোর কেত্তন শুরু হয়ে গেল। এমতবস্থায় একটি খাদ্য নিকেতন খোঁজা অবশ্য কত্তব্য। তা ক্ষুধার্ত দৃষ্টিতে আকাশের দিকে তাকিয়ে মেঘের অবস্থা দেখতে গিয়ে দুতলায় C/O বাঙালি আবিষ্কার।
দেরি না করে শীততাপ নিয়ন্ত্রিত এই খাদ্যাবাসে ঝটপট প্রবেশ করলাম। পুজোর জন্য বেশ ভিড়,তাও জায়গা পাওয়া গেল।কিন্তু খাদ্যতালিকা সীমিত,কারন পুজো। বাঙালি খানার সন্ধান করে ব্যর্থ ও মনক্ষুন্ন হলাম।
অবশেষে মেথি মালাই মুর্গ, পনির বাটার মশলা আর বাটার নান অর্ডার করেই সন্তুষ্ট থাকতে হলো।
তবে এরপর শুরু হলো অন্তহীন প্রতীক্ষা।  নচিকেতার গানের ভাষায়,"মন শুধু সে ক্ষনের প্রতীক্ষায়..."
মাঝখানে পরিচারককে হাঁক দিয়ে জল আনাতে হলো(তাও ভালো,আমাদের পাশের টেবিলে তো সাফ করাই হলো ঝাড়া 20 মিনিট পর) চারপাশে মাঝেমাঝেই অন্য টেবিলে এসে পড়ছিল খানা। চারপাশ থেকে খাদ্যের সুগন্ধ আর কাঁটাচামচ এর টুংটাং এর মধ্যে খিদেপেটে শান্ত হয়ে বসে থাকা থার্ড ডিগ্রি টর্চারের সামিল। বিরক্ত হয়ে আমার সঙ্গী কেটে পড়ার প্ল্যান করলেও আমি পৃথিবীর যাবতীয় প্রলোভনের সামনেও বুদ্ধের মতো অনড় থাকায় সেটা কার্যকরী হলো না।
জীবনের সব প্রতীক্ষার শেষ আছে।আমাদের টেবিলে খাদ্য আসাও তার ব্যতিক্রম না। প্রথম হাফে পনির দিয়ে শুরু। আহা! বাটার নানে জড়িয়ে মুখে পনির বাটার মশলা। হালকা গ্রেভির সাথে নরম-গরম বাটার নানের মিলনে এক রাজকীয় স্বাদ ছড়িয়ে পড়ছে জিভে। আমি ভুলে যাচ্ছি হাতিবাগান মার্কেট,ট্রামের ঢং ঢং আর পুজোর ভিড়;পরবর্তী নানের টুকরো মুখে তোলাই যেন তখন জীবনের পরম চাহিদা।
দ্বিতীয় ভাগে নানের সাথে মুর্গ মেথির যুগলবন্দি। হালকা মিষ্টি স্বাদের গ্রেভি আর নানের মাঝে থাকা মৌরি মুখে দিলে সুখের সপ্তম স্বর্গ।(আমাদের পাশের গোটাদুই ছেলেমেয়ে অপেক্ষার চোটে উঠে চলে গেল,তারা জানে না পৃথিবীতে ভালো জিনিসের জন্য অপেক্ষা অবশ্যম্ভাবী)
বলাই বাহুল্য,সব শেষ হতে সময় বেশি লাগলো না। আমার একটা থিওরি আছে- খাওয়ার পর যদি আঙ্গুলটা চেটেচুটে সাফ করেন তবে শেফ জিন্দাবাদ। C/O বাঙালির শেফ কে জানি না বাপু।তবে পঞ্চমীর বিকেলে তিনি যে পেটের সাথে মন টাও ভরিয়ে দিলেন,তার জন্য ধন্যবাদ তার অবশ্য প্রাপ্য।


(ছবির কথা মনে করিয়ে লজ্জা দিবেন না। ক্ষুধার্ত পেটের সামনে গরম গরম খাবার এলে,আমার হাত আর মুখ ক্যামেরার আগে চলে।)

Visited this place while returning from work for lunch with my foodie friend and had opted for Chicken Supreme Belle Hellen along with Tandoori roti and Murgir korma.. Apart from these we had ordered for two drinks which was a lemon drink and a mango drink. Well, the location of this eatery is exactly opposite to Star Theatre and is easily located and has a well decent sitting arrangement along with a baby-sitter too... Now coming to the ambience, it was average and the staff's were polite but took long time to serve which lost marks from my side, yet knowing the fact that continental dishes take long time I have marked average for that but when the continental dish arrived, we were pretty anxious how they would serve and found it really appreciable as the chicken was tender, juicy, fresh, creamy, cheesy and was served presentably which stole the heart... After that we tasted the Murgi Korma that was spicy yet fresh with tandoori roti which was made out of wheat and was surprisingly soft. The drinks were also satisfying, sooner after having a good lunch had packed C/O. Bangali Sukha Chicken that is served with 4 Soruchakli for my parents and must say that they enjoyed the dish very much! (Picture not given) 😊

Went there with my girlfriend on Saturday at lunch time and took a corner seat..the interior is well decorated and ambience was quite good.. This was my second time visit here.. We ordered rice,pulao, daal, jhuri alu bhaja, alu posto, mutton kosha, hilsa fish and caramel casterd.. Service is little bit on a slower side.. Quantity is sufficient or I can say it is much than it's competitior around this.. But the quality was not the same than my previous experience.. Hilsa fish was great.. Alu posto was good.. But the mutton kosha pieces are not soft.. Taste were also fluctuating.but the caramel casterd is a must try one -just awesome... Prices are also pocket friendly.. I would recommend to try this once as it offers some pocket friendly dishes with decent quantity and quality..

Food quality and quantity both are good, the decor is excellent and the location is perfect. if only they can improve the service they will be a real joy for the food lovers.

Located just opposite star theatre in hatibagan, the location is spot on. The ambience has a classic bengali touch to it. We wanted to try 'luchi' but it was unavailable so we went for butter naan and murgi kofta. The naan was soft and the kofta tasted fantastic. The only problem is the service. It's very slow as our food came after a long time. Do give it a try.

Though rating is average but we did a sudden plan to have some fusion food over there..i got a mixed reaction about that place....i reached around 7:30...we were so hungry..

Location-very much easy to locate...near star theatre at sovabazar crossing..

Ambince-very quite place...well decor tried to achieve an authentic look..light music which i thoroughly enjoyed...

Food-we ordered sundori murgi and tandoori chicken as a starter....tandoori chicken(5/5) was really mouth watering ...highly recommended...sundori murgi-as the name suggested its heavenly tasted...
In main course -misti polao accompanied with
Cox bazaar murgi masala....
Polao made with kaju kismis,tasted so horrible...a typical smell was coming from the rice...as if rice was not fresh
But the murgi masala was too good...

Staffs-very friendly...
Over all great experience..will visit soon for bengali cuisine..

Besides bengali dishes, they serves chinese dishes also. They have varity of bengali dishes in their menu. But the cost of every bengali dish is too high. And there is no thali service in their menu. You have to order each item separately like Plain rice, Dal, Chingri malaikari etc. And the most irritating is their service is too late. You have to wait at least @45 minutes for noodles and  almost one and half hour for rice items with only one side dish.

First of all to start with the ambience is great and the food tastes pretty good specially the fish dishes but service is very poor ..they are pretty late in taking the orders and serving. half the things in menu are not available and the waiters are even un aware of that.. and return after a while informinh us about the unavailability...so i would suggest the managment to look up to this as same thing happend in both of my visits.This is the only aspect that would bring the restaurant down if not looked after properly.. as i guess restaurant like these should have proper trained waiters instead of jst casual service boys dressed as waiters

A restaurant in middle of busy hatibagan area, a little difficult to find parking but one can park in the star theatre. So, the service is very slow paced, the quality of food is Allright ish. The Chinese section does justice to the restaurant, that is fried rice, chilly chicken the basic has a good taste , but the indian section fish pulao, was not at all good, the fish had a stench, the pulao had a peppery taste. The mutton kosha was  good, but i have tasted better. Overall, the ambience is a eye catcher, the service is really slow and the waiters cannot follow instructions. The dessert section does not have anything except payesh, and caramel custard which are really good.

I have ordered chicken cutlet and the fish fry via online order app of Zomato. Chicken cutlet is OK, but the fish fry is not at all good, Moreover, it seems very costly. For each item, they charge 100/ where as per quality the fish fry I could get @40/- in any local food joint and the chicken cutlet that too not at all worth to money. It charges hardly 60 to any renowned food joint(per quality)

2.Katla kalia- i must admire dat they provide very fresh fish, and d dish wholesome is too awsome
3.Veg Kopta- Too much yammyyy
4.Chicken Hyderabadi- 3pieces of chicken, in green curry with the flavour of green chilli and coriander leaves... Bit spicy
Our bill came exactly 760....
Both quantity and quality is very much justified to money

I didn't dine out there....we got the food parceled.. so I will not comment on the ambience and hospitality out there... the rating is solely based on the quality of food....the fish reshmi kebab was magnificent while samudra biryani was too spicy and did not please my taste buds....the mutton kasa was so and so and the prawn cocktail was too sweet and thus all in all not a good experience.

The food is ghati(the people originated from west bengal) special.The potato with mutton Curry was little smelly ,the khir or payesh had only water with some amount of rice. Overall its good but need to uplift the quality and serve maximum fresh food.

Been to this place today.firstof all the map and direction shown in the site is slightly off the mark. If going frm ulta danga towards sovabazar the place is on the left but the map Shaw's it on the right a few meters down the road.
As for the food we ordered sundari murgi as starters.it was good. The main course of rice,mochar ghanti,alu fulkopi and mug dal was just right.kosha mangso and sorse ilish were perfect. What was served as crumb fried lamb chops wth vegetable was at best 2 mutton keema cutlets wth sauted veg.i will give 7/10 for food.
Service was very very slow.it took them 10 mins to prepare the bill another 10 mins to bring the pOS machine.in spite of the place being almost empty.sevece needs a rejig.
I'm not much interested in ambience and music etc.

The ambience is good.
We tried both continental and Chinese and found the later one better.
They offer a nice range of mocktails and beverages.
But although the restaurant was nearly empty, they took a long time to serve..

Been there some days ago.. this restaurant is very close to the star theatre, hatibagan which is very easy to locate.. it is famous for bengali cuisine.. ambience is nice and the interior is very beautiful.. now come to the food.. first we ordered a continental starter which was recommended by the waiter.. some baked cheese fish.. but honestly I didn't like it.. a very strong smell was coming from the fish which I didn't like.. my friend ate that and I ordered a 'kolkata fish fry'.. fish fry was good.. we ordered two types of mocktails named 'gondhoraj kalboishakhi' & 'orange piroska' , which were very refreshing.. in main course we had peas and paneer pulao and mutton kosha which was delicious.. I rate them 3.5 only for the first starter we ordered otherwise I will give 4/5 for sure.. next time want to try their 'sundari murgi' & 'daab chingri' and want to rate them better.. 😊😊

This place is located near Hatibagan crossing. I went there yesterday and ordered Tel koi and Mutton kosha. The Fish was fresh and the quality of the dish was quite good,however the mutton kosha was even better.The price is also very reasonable. The one thing that need a little improvement is their service because it is slow. I hope they will take care of this issue.

I was searching new places to visit in zomato, then I found this place near my house, my love for bengali cuisine attracted me to go there.
I will so as per as taste is concerned I am not dissapointed, although it can be better.
Food quality is good, and overall ambience is ok. 

I also feel that the service was not professional.

C/o Bangali is a unique restaurant in more ways than one but still need to go a long way before it joins the big boys. Though potential is there to achieve greatness but it will take a lot of work.
Ambience- very nice and beautiful. That old Bangali Raj Bari type feel has been tried to capture with success to a certain degree. Situated right on hatibagan more and overlooks it.music is fine.
Food- the fish items are really good, specially the starters. The mutton was also very good,loved the mutton kossa. They have got there Bengali cuisine figured out but the other cuisines need work but hey it's a Bengali restaurant after all. But one complain is they really need to add more to there menu. Variety is limited.
Service- only area where there is immediate attention needed. There staff is very amateurish,they definitely need to hire some experience hand pronto.
Price- great thing about North Calcutta restaurants is they r dirt cheap. So no problems there.
Overall a very nice,warm Bengali restaurant with great Bangali food on offer so come down n have a good time. Total thumbs up.

A cozy restaurant close to Star Theatre, specialising in Bengali cuisine.
When we'd visited it was packed with Bengalis happily lunching away, with eager foodies having to wait downstairs. One has to access the restaurant by climbing a few sets of steep stairs.

Ambiance is soothing with the music of violin being played in the background; a mellow tranquility reigns inside interspersed with the occasional sounds of conversation. The brick-styled walls and pillars, the wall lamps, framed caricatural cartoons on walls and the arched windows offering a calm view of the outside were the few things that caught my attention.

We sipped their mango juice and tried the Virgin Kalbaisakhi mocktail. Both were very refreshing and flavorsome.
We parcelled home their day's special Gondhoraj Murgi which was also quite good.

However, their major drawback is their service, which is SLOW and VERY POOR. We had to wait for around half an hour to receive our parcel. Others too who were waiting for their food or parcels were complaining as well. 
Also, the toothpicks and sweet anise that they had  provided, along with the bill, had been left untouched by us so a server actually picked  them up and set them at another table. I found this gesture rude and offensive and not in terms with proper restaurant manner and etiquette. We hadn't yet left our table and without notice the fresheners were taken away. Servers I feel lack proficiency in management and the service needs to be amply improved.

Went here nearly a month back. Ordered pulao and some other dishes. Can't recollect all the names. Specially remember 2 dishes, (rest were not remarkably good)
1) Chital mach er muitha
2) Malpoa
I really like the taste of 1st dish. I'm ready to go another day only for that dish.
For the 2nd dish, Malpoa should have been a bit more soft. And the Kheer on the top of it made it yummy.

The ambience and decor was average. The hygeine not so good. Twice noticed a small insect climbing up my plate. Ordered fried lamb chops(which was excellent), grilled bhetki (average) and fish pulao (not so great in taste). The service was slow. Took eternity to serve us our food although the resturant was empty.

Situated just at the Crossing of Hatibagan if you are going towards Shovabazar from Ultadanga. This is a outlet that cannot be understood by it's quite interesting decor inside rather than a small cozy staircase to the main dine-in hall inside. Surronded with a soothing air conditioned atmosphere and eyecatching interior decorations, the outlet seemed family friendly. The staffs being a little less attentive gave us the double menu divided by Chinese, Bengali and Tandoor items. A separate menu for mocktails is also there. Being the Lunatic lover for Tandoor food, I opted for Mutton Dhakai Biryani along with an Onion Salad. My friend who was with me opted for Mixed Thai Rice with Xian Special Dry Chilli Chicken. You won't get any interesting or a variety of menu in the Tandoor option but quite a lot surprisingly in the Chinese portion rather than Bengali portion too. Retro songs instrumentally was played in a soothing volume which made the ambience good. The food was served quite a bit late but was worth the quantity. The Biryani was served in an unique porcelain pot along with the other items that we ordered. The Biryani tasted amazing and it was quite unique in its taste with the mutton piece being extremely tender and just melted in the mouth. The Rice was perfectly cooked with no objections to criticise and made my day. Quantity seemed more than enough for one person. The Xiang Dry Chilli Chicken as I tasted was also quite good though could have been a little less saucy to be specific enough. The Thai Rice was something which was splendid according to my friend though I personally didn't tast it. Overall for the food department, we were much satisfied. The bill had VAT included which sums upto 90-100 rupees but was worth money and seemingly reasonable. I would like to recommend everyone to have a visit to this outlet once and try out their signature dishes or today's special menu and I am it won't dissapoint you perhaps..!! :-)

Ambience was really superb. Nice interior with good view from its glass fitted windows. I got really excited to discover such a good place. 

Soon my ecitement got a thrash when we were served with the starter - fish fry was not good. It was hard and tasteless. I was getting the smel of biscuites flour in it. By the the time we were finishing the starter main course were brought in. Once we finish the starter one guy promtly took away the plates. Then the wait starts. After waiting for nearly 7minis I had to ask for plates so that we can start our main course.

Misthi pulao was really good. Chicken korma was good too. But again another pathetic display by its waiters. I asked the guy who brought the food to serve the pulao. He said he dont know how to serve. Then after 5mins another guy came in to serve.

We ordered for another misti pulao as it was too good. It again took nearly 15 mins. This another guy nrought that in. I again asked him to serve. It seems he has heard that first time in his life. He also said he dont know and again the second guy came in to serve. Then when we are about to finish I told them to prepare the bill. Even if I consider their very slow turnarround time I thought I have gave them enough time to prepare the bill. There was hardly 3groups. So I dont understand what made them took almost 15 mins to prepare the bill. Then I asked them for napkin which was not there on the table. They again took 5mins to find that. 

I think owner of this place need to think seriously about employimg some good waiters. He has invested so much in the decor, cook is peeparimg tasty food (ignoring the fish fry) but everything is getting spoiled by these waiters.

A long awaited treat to my friend. She was asking from more than two years so finally we went together and that too after our 4th sem exam...

Had lovely time with some serious life breathing suggestions.

We had ordered Sundori Chicken as starter(name was attractive so she suggested), which was hot, crispy, delicious and the presentation of it was amazing. For main course we had ordered Pad Thai Mixed noodles which was okay for me, cause I prefer more hakka for this dish. And in side dish it was Shredded lamb Mongolian sauce. This was hot, soft and tasty. 

And apart from food decor was beautiful with stupendous Bengali sketches. 

Location of this restaurant is great too. You can see beautiful old Kolkata buildings including Star Theater at the front.

A very hungry us entered this place around 5pm on a Sunday. We were famished, as usual, and wanted to try something different. The place has wonderful decoration which is quirky to say the least. I absolutely loved the photographs on the walls. We were promptly seated. The servers were very polite and courteous. We ordered Gondhoraj Kalbaishakhi, Bhetki Chingri Melbondhon, Vegetable Pulao, Butter Naan and Gondhoraj Murgi. The gondhoraj kalbaishakhi, an aam panna based drink is the hands down winner, as I gulped down 3 servings thereof. Amongst the food, the bhetki chingri melbondhon was pretty okay but I failed to distinguish the two fish blended together in the fry. Nevertheless, it was interesting. The veg pulao was full of flavour and the ghee was easily discernible. The gondhoraj murgi was again to die for. Though I felt that the chicken pieces perhaps needed a bit more marination, the gravy made me forget everything. Absolutely loved the food, would love to go back here again. Best of luck to the owner.

Last week a friend took me there for a long overdue treat! I was pretty surprised to see this restaurant there, as I'm almost a regular in that locality. They have a super quirky decor, with brick walls and Bengali cartoon posters. This place opened fairly recently at Haatibagan More, it's right opposite to the Canara Bank Branch of Haatibagan and is super easy to locate. Apparently they have made a name for their Bengali fusions, but we were in no mood to try them.

🔸 Sundori Chicken​ : It's basically chicken with barbecue sauce and spices in skewers. We were intrigued by the name, and it didn't quite disappoint me. They served it pipping hot.

🔸Pad Thai : Well, originally pad thai is prepared with rice noodle, but they made it with normal noodles - which was a biiig disappointment guys. I hope they rectify that soon.

🔸 Shredded lamb in Mongolian sauce : Honestly I don't know how Mongolian sauce is supposed to taste, but this was pretty delicious. The lamb was also soft and succulent, and was loaded with veggies. 

They have a nice atmosphere in here, this area was in much need of a restaurant like this. But. They have huge room for improvement in terms of food. 
Since I never tasted their Bengali fare, I'll try to go back there soon.

Yet another Bengali food speciality joint amidst the hustle and bustle of Hati Bagan.. Located opposite to Star Theatre, the name itself testifies the significance of this place.. Plus the additional gain is the option to try out some proper Continental dishes as well, something this area has lacked for so long.. Coming to the ambiance, the decor will give a feel of old, colonial Kolkata with a sense of the tradition and the culture of the city.. We opted for a take-awa, hence yet to experience the dine-in services.. The food took a hell lot of time to be delivered, something they need to work on.. Coming to the food, we sampled:
Sundori Murgi: Chicken in skewers sauted with a red, sweet chilli sauce and lots of garlic.. The chicken was soft, juicy and crispy with the sauce blended well..
Special Sukha Mangsho: Served with complementary Soru Chakli, this dish was kinda dissappointing.. The spices didn't blend well with the meat and came out somewhat as a confused dish.. Too much presence of pepper and the muttons were way too fatty, something not prefered personally..
Cox Bazar Murgi Masala: Much better in terms of taste.. Red, hot, fiery gravy with adequate punch and full of flavors..
Overall, it was a nice experience for a starter and surely I look forward to visit this place and try out some of their other bpopular Bengali fares.. Our total cheque was Rs.687/- (all incl.) for the above 3 dishes..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5

Nice decor and good Bengali food. If I compare this place with 6BP and Bhojohori, food is comparatively sweet and the menu lacks flagship dishes. 
Located amidst crowded hatibagan area and the entry is through steep stairs. Service is a bit slow, but overall a good place for a weekend bong lunch.

Located opp to star theatre. It is a restaurant which serves purely bengali cuisine. I tried the premium bengali non veg combo which is sufficient for two people. I chose prawn polao morich which was very ordinary and not upto the mark. The papda sorshe was tasty, the piece was big and tasted very fresh. The dal was good. The butter nan tasted good with the chicken. There were two pieces of chicken. Then there was ilish sorshe bhapa which was amazing, the hilsa tasted amazingly good. The chutney and papad was good. I also tried the firni. Firni was good but could have been better. With the combo, a soft drink came as a complementary beverage.Overall a very good experience, a must visit.Also, try the Gondhoraj kalbaisakhi mocktail, its amazing and very tasty.

●DECOR - Quirky with lots of bongness. I have really liked their flooring and lighting it gives you a vintage vibe. Spacious and comfortable. (4.5/5)
● FOOD- For starters ordered sundari chicken. The chicken was really nice with tangy sauce. It's a must try. In the main course we had vegetable rice and they complemented us with chakli.The rice was perfect and so was the chakli the only issue was with the mutton which was little bit hard.For desert we preferred caramel custard which was just cherry on the top and is a must try. (4.5/5)
● SERVICE - The time taken to serve the food was tad too long but apart from that the staffs were extremely courteous and well informed about the menue. (3.5/5)
● AMBIANCE - Good. (4/5)
● PRICE - Reasonable. INR 705.(4.5/5)

This is a relatively new joint in Hatibagan Market. The restaurant is on the first floor and the entrance is on Grey Street right opposite Star Theatre. The decor is funny and quirky. The waiters are courteous but a tad slow. The food is a mixture of good and not so good. We tried the Sundari Chicken and the Pudina fish as starters. We enjoyed both immensely although the chicken won all the hearts. It consisted of fillets stuck to a toothpick and cooked in a sweet and sour gravy with sesame seeds and a hint of coconut. In the main course we tried their meethi malai murgi and c/o bangali sukha mutton with tandoori rotis. The chicken was a little too sweet and the mutton had too much salt, so effectively we were balanced out. However I feel that they need to optimize their recipes a little more. Their prices are quite reasonable and with a little improvement in the food and service this place has the potential to be really popular.

Located just opposite to star theatre, c/o Bagali is a wonderful new getaway for tasty food. First time we visited we were very much impressed by the food quality and the ample amount. Service was a bit clumsy and washroom was not great but I was delighted as I saw both these faults are corrected in our latest visit. Let me highlight the food items one should have here.
Baked Bhetki : when ordered we hoped it to be a bengali dish but it was a nice surprise to find out a continental one. Finely cooked bekti fillets served with veggies and toast. Yum yum.
Sundori murgi : Again the name suggested it to be Bengali but it was one better, tangier vesion of chicken sashlik. Chunks of juicy boneless chicken chunks in BBQ sauce. Mouth watering.
Fish roll: Crisp coating around bekti rolls. Team up with kasundi and enjoy.
Murshidabadi Chicken and Gondhoraj chicken are two perfect dishes to try with steamed rice. Both unique and good in taste. I was disappointed with the bekti shorshe it was bland in taste and the jhuri aloo bhaja is simply not upto the mark. In deserts, caramel custard was good. In drinks, Cranberry cooler is alright. Kalboishakhi is not good but There was some drink with Gondhoraj lebu which was excellent.
Overall tasty food is the USP of this place. Titbits of Bengali touch in the decor is nice. One thing I would like to mention is that they serve Chinese and Mughlai as well along with bong and continental dishes. So it would be real nice if they make one consolidated detailed menu card.

It is Noboborsho so we thought of trying some unusual Bengali dishes.C/O bengali was a natural choice because of its proximity to our home.Situated on a prime location of Hatibagan crossing,it will be very easy to locate for anyone.The interior is really nice and to some extent there is resemblance with interiors of antique home, with brown brick shape walls & Glass painted lamp shades.We first orderd some starters Fried Gandharaj Chicken & Bhetki koliwada.Both of which tasted very nice, especially the flavour of Gandharaj was quite prominent in the chicken but it would have been better if it would have been more crispy.Then we had the main course Mutton Niharikash which was very tasty yet not very spicy and with that we had Prawn Morich Pulao and it was good.But quantity of the pulao is only suitable for a single person.In the dessert section Choclate Mousse is a must try.Overall a very pocket friendly restaurant and offers wide variety of dishes(Indian,Chinese, Continental as well as Bengali).I will definitely recommend it to my friends and family members.

Hatibagan is one of those places in Kolkata, where the soul of the city howls out its presence through the bustling accumulation of life. Right around the centre of such a place stands this restaurant.

Now, just for the ambience and decor, and of course, the location, I could have given it all the rating it needed. :)

As for the food, the ones from the Starters list are quite good, and I got to taste five of them!

*Now, THE DISAPPOINTMENT. The service. We couldn't actually get to the main course, because it was taking eternity for someone to come and take the orders! That too on a not so crowded evening. It got late and we had to leave! Even people from the neighbouring tables were complaining the same.
And, finally, when we called for the bills, even that took about half an hour to arrive! AND, you wouldn't believe this one, they added items we never ordered, in those bills! We noticed the extra charges only after paying through a card. So when we asked for the adjustment refund, they insisted on ordering something worth that extra charge, so that they wouldn't have to refund! Long way to go in professionalism!

3.5 for the bad service. Working on it will surely help this new star in the block in getting the reputation it deserves for all other factors. :)

Probably one of the Best Bengali Cuisine Restaurant in Kolkata. Ample number of options to chose from. Mutton Dak Bungalow, Coxbuzzar Chicken Masala are some of the recommendations to try out here. 
The ambience of the place is very serene, with the busy and bustling Hatibagan Crossing outside, with the interiors provide a calm and homely environment. The location makes it easily accessible to people from all parts of Kolkata. However, the thing that ponders, is the Quantity of the food they serve. Foodies might not be satisfied with the quantity. Though the staff don't keep the customers in waiting long, since the service is more or less prompt. 
Overall, one can definitely visit this place for sumptuous Bengali Cuisines. 
I would go with 4.0/5

Walked into this quaint restaurant for a lazy midweek afternoon lunch. Location of this eatery is its biggest advantage ...at the crossing of Hatibgan, the first floor Bengali cuisine restaurant literally raised my expectation and apetite while walking up the stairs . Quirky and amusing paintings adorning the  walls of the passage,stairway and dining hall does add to the ambiance. We tried an array of dishes simply because we wanted to try and test the the flavours of quintessential Bengali dishes. The shukto and alu posto were well cooked. Pabda tel-jhol with bori and mutton were average. However,  the Tangra(cat fish) jhal was a disaster! It neither looked nor tasted anything like 'jhal'...the gravy was an outrageous red curry with curd and loads of sugar! And to top it all, the fish wasn't fresh and was stinky! Bengali culinary skill ought to be judged by the freshness of the fish and the method of cooking . This dish must have been an experiment by the  chef that went awry! 
I was compelled to click a pic of the dish...which looked good but tasted quite otherwise. 
Meal for two costed us Rs1285.
Overall ...the ambiance was the saving grace bit that couldn't redeem the place from the lack of culinary expertise ...long way to go C/o Bangali. ..you need to take care of how your fish is cooked .

Considering the serious lack of decent restaurants in North Kolkata apart from the much celebrated and loved classic eateries, C/o Bangali is a revelation. Conveniently located at Hatibagan crossing, it offers a wide variety of cuisines, though the specialities are 'Bangali khabar'. The brightly lit retaurant has quirky interiors with cartoons of iconic Bengali personalities adorning the walls. Coming to the food...We were in mood of a bit experimentation...So opted for crab meat balls and bhetki grilled with cheese and herbs for starters. Crab meat balls simply blew us away...Spicy balls filled with a delicious Crab meat filling rolled over bread crumbs, deep fried...It was served with salad and sweet chili sauce. Cheese grilled bhetki was decent though the herbs seemed a bit too fragrant and stripped the bhetki of it's own flavours. Next up we ordered Cox bazaar chicken curry with tandoori roti. The chicken dish though spicy was like comfort home food... the blend of spices across the border made it quite tasty. Finally in the mood for more expectation, we ordered a chicken steak dish that arrived with a bit of pasta, some garlic bread slices sauteed veggies. In the centre was a piece of  boneless chicken breast with mushroom stuffing, baked with white sauce and cheese. It was flavourful, but sweetness of the dish was a bit of a surprise, albeit a not very pleasant one.
The biggest drawback of the restaurant must be the service...Staff, though courteous seemed a bit incompetent, lacked knowledge and not proactive enough. If these points are looked upon carefully C/o Bangali has the potential to be the dining destination for foodies living in North Kolkata and beyond.

The main attraction of this place lies in the ambience.  Quirky paintings of Bengali cinema of the 80's along with soft music playing in the background really sets the mood for any time of the day. We were a group of three and decided to order different. I order a Dhakai Chicken Biriyani. My friends ordered Cox Bazzar Murgi Masala and B N R Mutton Curry along with a plate of Rice.

Dhakai Chicken Biriyani: The rice had a unique sweet taste along with a hint of spice. It had a big piece of succulent chicken, a boiled Potato which was soft and light fried and a boiled Egg which was deep fried. I really liked the unique taste of the biriyani as it was different from the normal biriyani. The quantity of rice was large and can be easily had by two people.

Cox Bazzar Murgi Masala: As my friend told that there is a bazar in Chittagong named Cox bazar which is near the beach. The chicken was very soft and juicy and fulled of spice. This also was sweet but it also had considerable amount of spice and it went well with the basmati rice that was provided. I really loved the preparation and would surely have this once again.

BNR Mutton Curry: The mutton curry had considerable spice with a small hint of sweetness. The mutton curry went very good with the rice and the mutton was considerably juicy and large in size. It was really fulfilling as they gave 3 pieces of mutton in a very good price.

The price of the food was much lesser than we expected and the food quality is very good and plus points for the great ambience. I really enjoyed my visit and would like to visit again soon!

Visited today with my sister. This newly opened bengali restaurant is located near hatibagan crossing. Wanted to visit here since durga puja but finally got the opportunity. Restaurant is nicely decorated, neat and tidy. The wall paintings are one of the most attractive thing here. Ordered mutton galuti kebab for the starter and two drinks. Galuti kebab is so soft and yummy in taste. Mocktails are so refreshing. For the main course we have ordered bhaat, muger daal, veg kofta curry, veg pulao, daab chingri. All the items are served in a good quantity and they are tasty too. Veg kofta gravy is my favourite among all. You should really try the items. The staff behaviour is nice. Its around 1350/- for two including all charges.

C/o. Bangali is located on the hustling bustling Hati bagan crossing, opposite to the Star Theatre. Ambience was very nice with  live music... decor is pretty nice with old school styling with Windows all around overlooking the hati bagan crossing... seating was comfortable too.

They specialize in Bengali cuisine but they also serve continental & chinese dishes. Their bengali cuisine dishes are really very good lip smaking. Reccomended the Kaju Kismis Mishti Pulao, It is awesome. The Naan was also good and soft. The Dal Preparation was also very very tasty. Staffs are also very polite and well trained Service was very good.

The restaurant is at par with the likes of Bhojohori Manna, Bhooter Raja Dilo Bor etc.. They specialize in Bengali cuisine and is a hit with the crowd during the pujas! Tried their rice, shukto, daal, and fish kalia. After a tired shopping session just close to the pujas last year, we noticed this outlet opposite to the Star Theatre. There was a minimal queue thankfully, after about a 5 minutes wait, we were provided with a table. The prices are reasonable. Can be tried. Parking is a problem yesw, but it is better to travel using public transport since it is located at a very busy spot!

Located at the heart of Hatibagan crossing, just opp. to Star theatre, this place has a lot more to offer than just food. Though the name sounds of Bong cuisine, but they also serve north Indian and Chinese. The ambience is perfect, especially for those like me, who need peace to enjoy their food! The staff is courteous, however, the serving time is a li'l bit delayed, given its a Sunday and the quality and taste of the food they offer, I dun have much complaints about that :) M a big time foodie and decided to explore the place on my bday! Ordered some bong delicacies including mutton kosha, Prawn morich Pulao and shorshe ilish, which of course tasted heaven :) I would like to revisit this place!

Most important part of being in Kolkata is to try Bengali cuisine so that being in my mind as top priority I started looking around. Got good reviews from the place I was staying about c/o. Bangali so we happened to try it. This is a new restaurant and located in the market place close to Hatibagan. Services were good, place was small since it was not that full so we had no issues and food taste was up to my expectation.. we tried almost all sort of Bengali cuisine starting from Soma Muger dal, Jhujhuri bhaja, Chingri and my all time Bhapa Illish.. overall it was a good experience..

Coming to the food, ordered a grilled bhetki steak and Prawn kali mirch for the starters. The fish was really well cooked and accompanied with boiled veggies sufficient for three people.The prawn kali mirch was tasty but too much hot for my liking. For main course we ordered Veg & Mishti pulak along with Cox bazar chicken & Mon rongin prawn. The chicken was really nice, had a tangy, sweet & sour taste went well with the sweet pulao. The prawn tasted more or less similar to Malaikari , thick gravy made with coconut,cream etc. The quantity was very generous and we had to really stuff ourselves to finish the dishes. Overall a pocket friendly restaurant in North kolkata having good taste & quantity.

I would give a 4.5 rating out of 5. The food was absolutely fabulous since the taste of every item had been enhanced. The aroma was sharp and it touched the senses. On the turn around time after placing order I am a bit disappointed since there is a tough competition in the market, so that needs to be improved. Since its only 6 odd months in the market I am expecting management to be more aggressive next time I visit. The ambience part was also well thought of and I recommend people to visit here. Thanks.

 I visited this restaurant on the 25th of december this year. I had wanted to try out their food for a very long time... and christmas seemed to be a very nice occasion to do so. The restaurant is spacious with a very "bengali-inspired" decor, mainly the pictures and the flooring. Its not overdone and the ambience is just right...never steals the thunder away from the food. 
         The restaurant was packed with foodies, so i had to settle for take away instead. I ordered crab prawn friedrice in schezuan sauce and wok tossed stir friedprawn  hakka noodles. The Hakka noodles was light with a hint of a flavour of ginger that packed a punch. The prawns used were fresh but were of unequal and varying sizes. The crab meat fried rice in schezuan sauce was just out of this world. It was just the right amount of tangy and spicy with a hint of sweetness that plays a little peek-a-boo with your taste buds. The crab meat was fresh and had ample presence in the fried rice. I am bowled over by this dish alone.

I would love to visit this place once again and experience the authentic bengali menu that it boasts of. And i would also urge people to try this place out.
cheers :)

This place has an exquisitely simple yet mesmering decor...takes you back to a little over 50 years of Bangaliyaana.
The food is awesome.
The Aloo Poshto and Daab Chingri is a must have.
The price...now that's what takes it places higher than it supposed to be.
Drop in after a show at the Star to complete your baangali bikelbela.

You might think this is a Pure Bengali Cuisine restaurant by the name, but that's not true..
they serve Indian, North Indian, Chinese and Bengali all type of cuisines . . .

now let's come to the review :-

By Location, it's great.. at the main Crossing of HatiBagan . . .

Decoration is marvelous.. my 4 star rating is mainly for the decor and ambiance...
the Wooden works with a soft traditional touch with adequate lighting makes the atmosphere interesting..
and if you're lucky enough, may get the window side table, then you can get the most feelings of this place..

Service was Ok, a bit delayed serving..

Foods are not so great like the ambiance is, but not bad as well..
We went with the Bengali dishes.. so can not say about the other cuisines..
we ordered Saru-Chakli, Chital Macher Muithya, Fish Polao & Daab-Chingri..
the Saru-Chakli is too good, it's much different than the home made ones.. this one you should try while visiting this place..
rest of them are good...

The C/o Bangali serves some mouthwatering and authentic Bengali Cuisine. Located at Hatibagan Crossing, this place is the favorite haunt of all those who have heard and are yet to try some famous Bengali dishes like Maccher Jhol, Cholar Dal, Aloo Posto and more. 

The interiors of the place are something that takes you back in time or gives you a feel of being in Old Kolkata and flavour of Bengal. There are beautiful designs on the walls along with pictures that represent the everyday life in the city of Kolkata.

Go here with a group of friends or with your family to enjoy some great Bengali cuisine and the peaceful ambiance here. 

The ambience was good and the service was decent. Though they need to increase the speed of their service I Guess !! Foodie people do not love to wait and when there is so much option to avail these days.

We did tried a full Veg meal recently. Long Grain Deradun Rice perfectly boiled, Mung Dal with Kadaisuti (Green Peas), Aloo Posto, Mochar Ghonto, Vegetable Kopta and Chatni. 

A full fledged Bengali Veg Dish !! Liked the Mochar Ghonto and Kopta most !! Kopta was awesome ! Round Shaped Kopta of thin layer of Chhena and dryfruits with Masala inside. mmmmmm.....Byappok !! 

WOW! Everything was so tasteful and brilliant! We all hardly looked up from our plates after we began eating, the food was that yummy! This restaurant is highly recommended.

At 4:30 PM.. when maximum restaurants are on a break..but u r hungry like anything..go to c/o bangali.. Situated at the hatibagan crossing with a breathtaking view from the dining hall through the large glass windows, this place provides u with excellent services.Could nt njoy bangali dish as not in a mood, we had fish fry, mixed fried rice, chicken kungpao.. N the taste is, take my word, good. Rrally good. Also very economical. Though it was the first time and could not taste the proper bangali dishes, still admired the wide range of bangali dishes available there. With a hope of visiting here again for those, I wd say it takes great "care" of its customers....

C/O Bengali - A den For Khati Bengali Food Lovers.
Visited The Place During Puja and Oh What a Bad experience !!
1. No A la carte Was available as it was Puja. in the buffet we took chicken Thali.It Came late and service was very bad as  well as the behaviour and So was the Food.
2. Washroom was Out of water and it created a lot of trouble for the people.
3.We had to ask the waiters to give us water more than one time so that we could catch their attention.

Strictly one time visit for Bengali food lovers and although the dishes are pocket friendly but if u want to have a meal with great service this is not a place to visit.

You generally don't get such restaurants in North Kolkata area. The open brick walls and checkered walls create all the drama of the ambience. Although focuses on Bangali, this place caters multi cuisine food. The food is not excellent, it's average. What I love about this place is its ambience.

A nice eating joint at hatibagan crossing. I liked it. We went for three continental dishes. They have authentic bengali and chinese dishes available too. For drinks they have only cold drinks. A fresh lime soda and masala cold drinks are atleast recommended.

Bangali ambience r bangali menu diei jodi bangali k khusi kora jeto tahole to hoei jeto. Quality kothay? The costly Pomfret fish fry was nothing more than a roadside beguni fry. Same disappointment with Mutton Roganjosh! Again mismanagement on the part of the waiters. At first he is telling we don't serve tandoori roti and asks you to order butter naan only. Then they are serving both god knows why!! Still I hope that this restaurant will emerge as one of the best destinations for  Bengali foodies since it is well located in North Kolkata's Hatibagan and very well decorated as well.

'C/o. Bangali' is one of the best bengali cuisine restaurant in North Kolkata.It is located at Aurobindo Sarani near Hatibagan More,just opposite of Star Theatre.I've been there with my friends during this Durga Puja time in Sasthi for dinner.First of all ambience is good & well decorated.For Durga Puja they arranged special limited menu.We ordered one Full Tandoori Chicken & Sundari Chicken as starters.Tandoori Chicken was tasty & Sundari Chicken was mouth watering,Fully marinated with spicy sauce,it was just delicious.Don't miss their Sundari Chicken.Then we ordered Kaju-Kismish Pulao,Butter Nun with Murgh Mussalam & Chicken Korma as main course.All items were tasty.Atlast we ordered Chocolate Mousse as a dessert.It was mouth watering.Service is quick.Price is also reasonable.

It is situated at hatibagan more near sbi and icici bank ATM. It is a small type of restaurant but ambiance is also attractive.  Basically it is a Bengali  restaurant. I have visited with my friends 7th oct 2016 durga puja time. First of all we ordered stater like tandoori chicken and chicken sundoori. Chicken sundoori is very tasty,delicious and mouth watering. Everybody must try it. Then we ordered main course like chicken murg masalam tandoori rooti and polao. Every item is tasty. Food quality and food quantity is very good. Last we ordered desert like chocolate mossue.
Staff behavior is good they are very helpful. Price is reasonable .

Pathetic service with tremendous mismanagement. They serve only limited non-veg thalis for a whooping 800 rs. And veg for 600 during the pujas. And that too you have to wait for more than an hour for just a parcel to be handed over...when i continuously complained about it to the owner and the manager they said nothing can be done about it. And continued to serve all the customers who were dining in coming after me. and moreover considering the number of items on the menu i doubted the less number of containers and wanted to check them all. When i requested them this they did not allow me to..only to come back home and find out 4 items were missing from the list straight away. Complete unprofessionalism, because i have paid the entire amount, no compromise with that though. Now even if i go back they wouldnt believe me considering the kind of behaviour they have been showing.. I am highly disappointed with their services. Please avoid them especially during the pujas as they fail to cater to a large crowd.

A place which looks great, but is hugely mismanaged. So the initial liking is replaced by irritation real quick. 

Located bang on Hatibagan crossing, diagonally opposite Leather World / Khadims and above the liquor shop, this place have a great look. If you are seating beside the glass windows, you will get nice view of the busy street below. And almost everything good ends here.

The waiters are ill trained and some behave really bad. They do not know the food they are serving. Waiting time is huge. We tried this place when it opened in August and during the Pujas. They were super slow both the times. In one word service is really, really poor. 

Coming to food, some items are good, some are bad and the rest awful. We liked the caramel custard here. Decent stuff, though a bit too sweet. Chicken Steak Sizzler was Ok. A Chicken starter was quite tasty. The thalis, both veg and non veg, served during the pujas, were absolute disasters. Most items were unpalatable. And the limited thalis were priced at 800 and 600 for non veg and veg respectively. I must say those were overpriced, considering they were limited and comparing them with standard buffet restaurants.

The biggest disappointment was when I packed home a prawn morich polao. The taste was good I must admit. But there were not a single piece of prawn in it.  Imagine eating pepper flavored rice with nothing in it and paying 200 bucks for it! Don't know whose mistake it was, but I really don't care.

C/O Bangali is located at the busy streets of Hatibagan above the famous liquor shop towards Malancha and Jaipuria College. We have visited there on Sasthi's Eve and great to our surprise its almost empty may be because its not a well known restaurant like Bagicha and Arsalan. The Ambience is very nice and you can see those busy streets from the glass walls. 
Now coming to the main part i.e. Food... We have ordered Pomfret Masala as starter which is nicely cooked and tasty. Then we have ordered Kaju Kishmish polao (Authentic Bengali Yellow Polao) and Mutton Dukbunglow (3 pieces of mutton). Both of them was good and complement each other very well. Finally the Pocket Pinch.. it costs us only Rs. 550. So overall a fine experience.

N. B. : During the puja times they are not serving all of there food and gave us a seperate menu card. I asked for the original menu card just for my query and told them I will not order anything from that .. still they are not willing to show the same , which i feel quite embarrassing. Secondly in the bill they have mentioned VAT applied for and Service Tax applied for. So may be from next time onwards you may find your bill will increased approx. by 20% for same dishes. So be careful about that.

The name says it all about the restaurant itself. Totally Bengali cuisine. Great place for eating out to skip cooking for a day. Two Thali is enough for three persons. Quality, they serve, is no doubt very good. Taste is also very good. Rates are reasonable. Specially, Ilish Vapa, Vaja moong dal, Enchor chingri are too good. The chatni and the desert items are also good. Overall a good place to lunch.

It's a sigh of relief to find such a place amidst the hustle bustle of mediocre casual dinings, to relish each morsel of food. Ordered Hawaiian chicken salad which was a kind of fresh air and replenishment to the taste buds. Followed by and extravagant preparation of Chicken Kasha with Luchi and Rice . And to please the sweet tooth of each Bangali, the Mango Chutney!  

A sure shot winner in the busy streets of North Calcutta! C/O Bangali does take of your taste as well as your pocket!

C/o Bangali comes ahead as a breath of fresh air in an otherwise congested and certainly not at all that impressive number of restaurants in one of the busiest part of the city and I.e Hatibagan. The restaurant not only promises a top class ambience but also a wide variety of dishes comprising of bengali , mughlai and continental . The people of North Kolkata had been subjected to different kind of dishes but i have always felt that a certain level of quality was missing and that's what this restaurant is vowed to offer .

° Location :- This is located at the hatibagan 4 point crossing . People who are habituated by this place will remember a big liquor store located right at the end of the street which comes from sovabajar to hatibagan . This restaurant is located at top floor of the liquor store . 

° Ambience & Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- I bet that the people of North Kolkata has not seen an ambience this classy . With a bare brick styled walls and decorated with glass lanterns , every corner of this joint breathes classy aura . The seating is perfect with some tables close to the window . If you get a seat close to the window you will get a view of vintage north Kolkata along with your classy dinner . The service is amiable and the food serving time is acceptable . With due time the service will improve .

----------------------------------

Food :- When a joint comes up with such a wide variety of menu it means business and C/O Bangali has certainly stepped the foot on the gas . I have certainly not tasted all the items but I have got some idea from the following which I tried this Sunday lunch :- 

1. Chicken Hawaiian salad ( 4 / 5 ) :- Not quite the most recommended item but we were looking for a light hearted starter to go with . The salad took some time to arrive but we were happy with the result . This is a cold sweet salad so order of its your cup of tea . The salad was huge with shredded chicken and pineapple and sufficient for 3 people . The chicken pineapple was mixed with cheese and served with shredded lettuce and cherry on top . We loved every bit of it .

2. C/O Bangali spcl whole bhetki with gravy ( 5 / 5 ) :- 

What a dish . My god, there are 2 variants one which costs 300 rupees and another one which costs 500. Trust me the 300 one with a medium will satisfy  2 person fully . This is one hell of a dish due to the following reasons :- 

a. Fine quality bhetki served.
b. The gravy which comes with it is spicy mixed with ginger , garlic , lots of onion and capsicum . I think this is the best gravy to go with bhetki .
c. The dish is best complemented with steamed rice or any pulao.

These are enough reasons for you to go try this amazing item and after having it I am sure you will find more reasons to go nd try it again . A big thumbs up from my side .

3. Chingri morich pulao ( 4 / 5 ) :- Another fine rice item . We were in no mood to try just a steamed rice so went with this pulao . Trust me , chingri and gol morich does everything right to make this pulao a hit . Not hugely flavorful which makes it ideal to go with the bhetki . But the flavor is absolutely perfect . Very happy with the quantity of prawn in the dish. Once again very much recommended 

4. Malpua ( 4 / 5 ) :- Comes 2 a piece at the price of 40 . Served hot this is sweet and juicy . Absolutely perfect dessert to end your meal . A lunch ended on a sweet note.

---------------------------------

Verdict :- I generally do not repeat restaurants . But this joint has already entered into my visit again list . Becayse mainly of the continental items which I have not yet tried . And also the kabaabs which are there in a separate menu. I have attached their menu in the review since zomato has not fully updated their main menu in the page . Just have a look and go have a visit . Although I will be back again for the continental it will be hard to neglect the whole bhetki . I believe that the dish will be an instant classic and people will be bound to come here to try their signature dish . Following are the main points to highlight :- 


1. Classic fine ambience. 
2. Fine quality food with whole bhetki the must must have. 
3. Good location .
4. Wide variety of menu .
5. Decent priced. No taxes applied yet so hurry now.

This restaurant has potential to be the superstar of North Kolkata so go visit them and you will surely have a meal which is worth it .

Review part-II-Food was too good.Ordered-Sugandhi mahi tikka,rice,daal,aalu n patal bhaja,chotol muithya,mixed chatni and Papad.Each n everything was so fresh and testy.Sorry this time no picture,We all were way too much Hungry.
Keep it up Mr. Shantanu :)
Visited again on 15/7/2017.You can't believe that they serve good thai dishes also. 
Mr. Shantanu suggested us to try-Thai red curry along with Thai mixed fried rice. It was a Hit! 
Just one suggestion- Servers need to improve there knowledge about mix n match.

Orange Hilsa -- the name may conjure many a picture but when one bits into the wonderfully marinated pieces of boneless ilish (Hilsa) fish infused with orange taste it is a wonderful feeling. 

All the dishes are bengali in nature but with a contemporary and nice twist that leaves one asking for more. Did not try any of the veg dishes but the chicken, sundari fish (baked fish infused with gondhoraj lebu and other herbs), pyari (guava) ilish, bhetki fish fry, dab chingri, bhetki, chingri (prawn) kalimirch pulao, ilish pulao, caramel custard, chocolate mousse, etc left a wonderful taste in our mouth. 

We tried a couple of continental dishes too and Indian cuisine -- the butter naan was simply the best one has tasted in a long time, slightly sweet, soft and tasty along with mutton raan (this though was slightly salty to the palate). 

A must visit for all foodies in Kolkata and those visiting. 

A word of caution don't come in expecting traditional bengali food for this places all bengali food with a twist. However one will not be disappointed at the end of the meal.
Located bang on Hatibagan junction, the place can't be missed and am sure with time this will be one of the must have places in Kolkata.

In a single line "I love C/O bangali"..
Awesome food,great hospitality,superb ambience..It is in a great location(easy accessble)..
But as the name suggest they have solid collection of bengali food items-those are very innovtv..but not only dat dey have chiense, italian foods as well like pasta sizzlers etc..
I love the tooty fruity icecream,but the custerd is also fatafati (have heard about it,will defintly try on next visit)..
Very much pocket friendly and quantity is also good..
Fish fry is juzt 5 out of 5 :)
They even have take away system too ^_^
I would suggest juzt one thing - if there can be a mixed music collection played in a low volume it'll becm "Cherry on the top"
Would love to visit again and again :)

Food was really great and so was the ambience. Loved it. We ordered Bhaat, Mug-Musur Dal, Alu posto, Jhuri alu Bhaja, Begun Bhaja, Methi Malai Chicken, Kosha Murgi, Dhokar Dalna and Payesh. Every single item was tasty. The quantity was also good. We were unable to finish all that we have ordered. My friends were also very happy with the quality of food. Hope to visit every week. :)

We went for a 2nd time in a group of 5...last time we quite liked the food and ambience thus the revisit...this time the chicken and mutton prepaprations were way below mark and very oily..the mochar ghonto all of us felt was bitter...we infact wasted quite a bit of chicken and mutton which they offered to pack for us..but we politely refused...as rightly pointed out by my friend Rahine-only fish fry was good..need to work out on the food quality...we felt the money spend was a sheer waste this time around..but noone from senior management was there by the time we made an exit...so we couldnt give them our feedback

The food was awesome. Komola hilsa I simply loved it. Ambiance was nice. Only problem was the time they took for serving the dishes. I had to wait 30 min after I placed the order. Apart from that its a bang on..

Very bad food and attitude of staff . We went yesterday after getting the feeler from last month when we had gone for the first time , and ordered dishesh like Mochar Ghonto , Mutton Jhol , Chicken Kasha , Chitol Moitha. Sad to say all the items were of below average quality . I called one of the staff and told about the mochar ghonta with which I had started but there was no reaction . In other top restaurants like Bhojohori ,Kasturi , Aheli etc if a customer points out a flaw in the food immediately it gets changed , but to my shock these people did not budge and we were left to have that food , which we didn't . Now when I come to Mutton preparation which my wife specially ordered it was oily to the core . chicken was pathetic . The only saving grace was Fish Fry . With this food and attitude of staff we are sure not to visit again or recommend anyone . Being from North Kolkata's prominent area we thought that we have something good in the vicinity but it has not worked out .. Sorry to review but this is the fact ...

Location is awsum, just at hatibagan more. Easy to locate. Soft, old world charm with bare brick styled walls and glass mosaic lamps. 
Got the corner loveseat which views the best of the hatibagan crossing.
Food is just not bengali but a mix match of continental. Infact we tried the continental fare.
The hawain salad was great to taste, followed by a slightly bland chicken pasta ending with a good dessert of caramel custard.
The main course pasta was a little disapointing priced at 300,portion of chicken was really less and not well seasoned even. Hawain salad n caramel custard are value at their price.
Our first choice crab meat ball was not available.
Staff are courteous and helpful.
Worth return visits!

New place and new style . Quite an ambience I must say. Located exactly in hatibagan more on top of the FL shop. 
The complete menu is yet to be served. 
I really liked the sundori chicken. Mutton kosha was too spicy.
This is going to be huge hit in North Kolkata.

C/O Bangali is at the arabinda sarani corner, small entrance and a wonderful space on the first floor.  Just look around well, or you can easily miss. Definitely take the corner seat. You get the whole view of the street from this table. While you are enjoying your bangali delicacies, you could have a view of the trams and the life outside. The owner was very courteous to offer us the seat immediately when you saw we were visiting Kolkata and would have appreciated the view. Otherwise the ambience inside is just okay. 
Food is amazing, we loooved it, couldn't finish all that we ordered but the two of us ate to the brim :)If you are a foodie and love to experiment with local cuisines - I would say the must have are the Bhaat Full, Sukto, and if you enjoy fish - ask for the Bhetki Sarshe.For vegetarians dont worry at all, you have so much to try too..Have Alo Posto - it is yummy, Begun Chees Hab, a simple Chanar Dalna  will also be great..Have a fresh lime water as a drink to beat the heat..
Must Visit if you are in Kolkata :-) Enjoy..

The restaurant is just around the corner.. Long awaited proper, simple yet delicious dishes of Bengal are served here. The ordinary chicken curry ( murgir jhol) was prepared so tasty that I was blown away. Their hospitality along with the home delivery was perfect. May they keep it up and satiate our gastronomical cravings.

The warmth with which the owners welcomed me was remarkable, friendly and homely. The interiors are compact yet uncluttered, simple yet pleasant, traditional yet contemporary. And the culinary experience was first-rate. The Daab-Chingri was delicious. I'll be going back time and again for the Raan. And even if you have already eaten a bellyful, you must still remember to end your delectable experience at this endearing restaurant with the creamy and silky caramel custard. And though it has the word 'Bangali' in its name, even non-Bengalis will find it worth the visit.

Located just opposite Lebanese Junction on Hatibagan more, this place was much needed here due to dire lack of good food options at affordable prices.

I have tried almost all there cuisines here and in the first few days after opening they weren't even charging taxes so that's a great thing. All their dishes are well-cooked and tasty and except for the abundance of oil, I really have nothing to complain about. I would really recommend their hilsha delicacies-which I have had the good fortune of having thrice.

The owner is very courteous and he even has a personal youtube channel where he shares wonderful recipes so if you are a cooking enthusiast do ask him about this and he will be very willing to share his enthusiasm with you. I just hope and pray that they are able to keep up their good standards in the days to come.

Edit: On visiting their outlet today I feel that the staff are not very well acquainted at handling large crowds on peak days. Also they messed up orders and placed stuff on the wrong table. Also 300/- for veg.thaali is quite overpriced.

Located exactly at the Hatibagan and Grey Street crossing, on the first floor, it is hard not to notice this new restaurant. Having indulged myself twice at this new eatery over the last fortnight, I woud say it is the best thing that could have happened to food lovers in this part of the city.  The interiors are nicely done . Seating is comfortable and staff are cordial and you can have a view of the very busy Hatibagan crossing as you enjoy your meal. If you are there for lunch make sure you try the wide variety of fish they offer. Exquisite and delicious. Do try the Ilish Morich Polao or the Chingri Morich Polao as per your preference. They also have some very interesting options in boneless Ilish (Hilsa) and I was delighted with the Komola (Orange) Ilish I had. The fish fry is also highly   recommended.   They also offer Steaks and Sizzlers. Make sure you try the Chocolate Mousse or the Caramel Custard for desert. Reasonably priced and brilliant food. A must go .

I had seen this eye catching restaurant with beautiful illuminated chandeliers on the Hatibagan Crossing while sitting inside a bus last week 
(thumbs up for both the decor and the location).
Decided to order some food home today and remembered this new restaurant on the block. I opted for their special whole Bhetki with gravy, Pabda tel bori Jhol, kumro Bhaja and wasn't disappointed, at all. The delivery was prompt and the food was well packed. 
The Bhetki was cooked with surprisingly little amount of oil (refreshing to see a fish *not* dripping with oil) and the jhol of the Pabda was a perfect balance of chillies and mustard. The kumro was something sweet and delicate on the side.
Overall it was a great meal at a very reasonable price. When it comes to authentic Bengali cuisine, the restaurant has very little competition in the area ( apart from Bhojohori Manna) thus has a lot of potential to succeed. 
Will definitely be back to try more of their dishes.
