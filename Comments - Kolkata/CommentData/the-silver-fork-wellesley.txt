The Silver Fork is located on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road near to Majestic Hotel.Visited this place today for dinner.It's a twenty seater restaurant with few staffs.The lighting theme was not at all good, it's little dimmy.
Now let's come to the food,In starter Mustard chilli fish was lipsmacking and tasty,a recommend one.Thai Dry chicken was hot and mouthwatering.They served the starter very quickly but we had to wait a little for the main course to come.In main' Pan fried chicken noodles was awesome. It's thick and terrific in taste.The Silver fork(TSF) signature noodles was a recommend one with TSF Signature Chicken.Overall the food quality was divine, quantity was impressive and reasonable too.A must visit place for decent Chinese food.

The quality and quantity of the food was excellent, to be honest (restaurant manager(s), please see to it that this is maintained, thank you so very much). We have ordered food from here twice via Zomato and it never failed us. So, among all that we tried, the chicken noodles were really good, the white gravy garlic chicken was something different and subtle. Somehow, I would like to mention that the Thai Chicken this restaurant has for starters can be improved a little- something more than just chicken fried in batter with lemongrass, maybe?
Overall, great and affordable place to order Chinese food from.

Ordered sui mai, chilli chicken and chicken fried rice. The food looked beautiful and tasted great.The dips were out of the world and the chicken was very soft and tender. The flavours were nicely balanced.Loved the way the food was garnished.Nice presentation skills. Definitely interested in trying out more next time.

We ordered home delivery from this restaurant through Zomato app-Mixed fried rice, chilli chicken & garlic chicken. The quantity was wholesome, especially the fried rice could be easily shared by 2 people. Tastewise average though, not the Chinatown type delicious. Garlic chicken was very oily and spicy. Chilli chicken was comparatively better. Fried rice was bland.

We had ordered sui mai momo, silver fork signature rice, silver fork signature chicken and hakka Noodles. The quantity was quite good and it tastes exceptionally well. The sui mai momo was the best. A must visit.

Indeed Authentic Chinese food. Ordered food for house party and it was 10 out of 10. No excess oil, no excess fried simply just perfect. I would say avoid going to Tangra and one should just  jump in here if you really want to taste Chinese cuisine. Must to have is "From the Ocean" starter. Keep it up folks.

Small place, good food. 
It's a restaurant with quite a few tables to sit... ambience is uh...not bad. 
But food is good enough to visit here some more times. They specialize in Thai & Chinese foods. 
For starter, we ordered crispy conjee lamb...it was good, but could have been somewhat better. For main course we ordered veg hakka chowmein & Silver Fork signature fish.. .both were pretty good. Chowmein was particularly very good. 
The salad they serve with food is so good...I liked it very much,, it was completely fresh , had a good flavour & extremely good to eat. Their soya sauce also has a good balance of tastes. 
Cost is very reasonable. 
Good place for a short food tour...

Got to know about this place from Zomato app and felt good to have visited the place today. It's a newly opened place but everything is quite organized indeed. The place is not quite big, but quality and quantity of food are just too good!! One should really try The American Chopsuey and Mushroom Babycorn Soya Chilli Sauce. It was quite nice. Price rate is absolutely ok and quite affordable for casual dining purposes. One more thing about this place is that, Service is quite fast and staffs are quite polite. Had a wonderful time visting this place and will surely revist soon.

The food was not that was expected. Mongolian Chicken when served every time preparation is different. Although i had not made any such specification. It was different from the one which i saw from the review. Chicken was just tossed in sauce with onion and capsicum. But it was spicy and quality of food was good.

Small place and can hold upto 20-25 people at a time .
Ordered hunan chicken and schezwan noodles.
Noodles required a bit more salt
Hunan chicken was perfect
Both noodles and chicken complimented each other
Presentation was pretty neat.

Did not like the place. That's like my honest first thought. The place is nothing next to cozy. I dont know how some customers commented it as cozy, its more like cramped. Too many covers for a small place like this. Service is a total disaster. You need to wait a minimum of 30 minutes after each order. For someone who really has had experiences with northeastern Chinese food and Tibetan food, its a no show. I mean presentation of the food is good, but taste wise its just okay. Also, for the price which they have kept, the quantity of food is quite less. Especially when serving noodles in a steamer. Like half the space is filled with garnishes and too little of the noodles. Not visiting again. Thank you.

Located at one of the most underrated areas of Kolkata, this restaurant is a surprise package. You walk in for a casual snacks, but you actually cannot stop at one dish. This place has so many dishes to offer. The taste is good, the spicy level is adequate and the best part is the quantity is well in accordance with the price. 
We came in on a Ramzan night and got Ramzan special dishes. The food is delicious and the people are friendly. The service is quick and the price is right. The most fascinating thing about the restaurant was the bowl of discount chits they serve before billing, you pick up a random chit, and whatever number is written on the paper, you get that much percent discount your total bill. 

Conclusively, this restaurant checks all the correct boxes without burning a hole in your pocket. Overall very good experience, definitely coming back soon with friends and family.

This place is a small cozy joint and very neat. The staffs deserve a special mention as they were extremely helpful and recommend us the dishes we ordered.
Now about the food! Well! It's too good to be called good‚Äã! Its excellent!!
We ordered a Budha wall soup which had a great taste and they said not many restaurant in Kolkata serve this soup (rs 90/bowl)
There is a ramdan special menu for the four weeks and we chose a Mongolian chicken skewer which had 6 pieces of chicken tossed in a sauce. The pieces were soft inside and the coating was spicy and crunchy outside. (Rs160)
Next in the main course we opted for silver fork special chicken noodles(Rs160) and their‚Äã special fish(rs200). The noodle was ample in amount to satisfy the hunger of two people with big appetite. The fish was soft and juicy and a plate contained 8 pieces. The gravy was moderately spice and went well with the noodles though the noodles themselves tasted really nice.
We were almost full but being hugely satisfied with what we ate we didn't want to miss the desserts. So we ordered a fried ice cream which was amazing!!! And had we left it it would have been a real miss!
And all these came for Rs730 only..
They also have squid and lamb in their menu which I would love to try out another day.
Frankly I don't know why Zomato rating is under 4 now.. since anybody who goes there shall be more than satisfied with the food and the authentic taste. As a Bengali I strongly believe in "kheye sukh paoa" i.e you are absolutely happy with what you ate and this is what this restaurant gave me..
So just go and enjoy a day with good authentic chinese food!! üòäüòä

This place stands out for food quality which easily matches that of a star level hotel @ an awesomely affordable price. The cuisine here tingles your taste buds with a whole new level of fiery, feasty and aromatic flavours. The dates pan cake and fried ice cream are must-haves in the dessert section. It's a great place for dine in as well as take away. Totally worth giving it a try with ur family:)
