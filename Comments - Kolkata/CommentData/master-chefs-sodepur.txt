Easy to locate. Good for takeaway. Seating capacity is less. Both Chinese items and kebabs are good here. Staffs don't have much knowledge about the dishes served. Service is slow. Food quality is average. Quantity is good. Budget price.

Very good restaurant !!!! Service is very good ...
Food quality is also very good.. tasted here chicken Reshmi kababs, mixed fried rice, sezwan fish & fresh lime soda ..
Each item is too good in taste.. specially the kababs...
It's located just opposite of Panihati College.. must visit there..

Most third class dishes ever I ate , ordered mix thi soup and drams of heaven . There is nothing speciality in thi dishes ate like a normal chinese soup, no lemon grass or thi ingredient in the soup but the drams of heaven is a disaster , so terrible to eat I could not even finish my dish , the batter looks like it fried in a beson gola , just horrible experience.Never going to this place if the food is offered in free

I'm just tired of masterchief.... Since there was no other restaurants available nearby other than punjabi food junction and we were too tired to go there so opted for masterchief knowing that its services have detoriated very badly.. We knew it was a waste of money so kept it simple and ordered chicken fried rice and hot garlic chicken and while placing the order I particularly mentioned not to put any kind of sweetness in the food but as expected the food was sweet and it was not only sweet it was too sweet so called the person who served and he took it back saying i'll fix it and to my surprise he added lots n lots of ginger paste, lots of black pepper n dry chilly in the gravy n again served it but since we were tired n did not have the energy to get it changed again we had to have it, I have failed to make them understand that no sweetness doesn't mean they will add lots n lots of chilly, ginger n black pepper just to make the food hot, no sweetness means no sweetness... I'm really very sad due to the fall of masterchief, we were regular customer of masterchief and previously whenever we used to ask the food to be made the way we want chief used to make it the same way n we were really satisfied with the everything but as the days passed by it is becoming worst, nowadays even if we ask for some kind specification the staff and the chief are least bothered .. I did not get an option for negative marking else dey r not worth for 1

Located opposite to the panihati college.. tried chinese,north indian dishes.. sweet corn soup and hot and sour soup were awesome.. chicken tikka kebab and reshmi kebabs were good.. mixed fried rice and mixed gravy noodles were tasty and full of chicken,prawn.. kung paw chicken and garlic chicken were well cooked and delicious.. fish sangrilla was perfect and the fishes were so soft and tasty.. but the butter naan was so salty that we had to return.. chicken bharta(red) was good but the chicken bharta (white) was so sweet in taste.. ambience is good but very delayed service.. service guys are not well trained.. we were seven and we had to arrange tables and chairs of our own.. they didn't help us to manage.. many items were not available at dinner time.. quantity is good.. chinese foods are tasty but a little bit over priced.. service is below average..

Located at a slight distance from Kolkata¬†this restaurant has been around for many years and the reason is no secret. You are treated like family and the service is impeccable.¬†The different meals all have their own unique qualities and character, which is often missed.¬†The somewhat unprepossessing entrance and the busy take away activity do not substantially detract from the dining experience. This is some of the best Indian food you can find here in this area of Sodepur. Placed just opposite to Panihati College. The conventional dishes (Reshmi Kabab,Tandoori Masala), the tandoori chicken succulent and perfectly spiced, the naan baked to an optimal crispy surface without any doughy stodge in the centre) are well assembled. The ingredients were top quality and all was cooked to perfection. Most of all the dishes were spectacular, a perfect synthesis of medium hot spices and herbs, combined so that the individual flavours were not subsumed in the fires of the curry.
                                                                ...

Extremely poor service. 
I entered the restaurant at 10 : 40 and when I ordered tandoori roti the waiter informed me that it will take about half an hour. So I ordered jeera  rice and mushroom matar masala instead which the waiter assured will be available within 15 minutes. When i asked the waiter as to the status of the order at 11:15 pm he just did not bother to answer. When I asked another waiter he asked in  the kitchen and informed me that it will be available in  10 minutes. 
Ultimately I had to cancel the order as it was getting late 
. The whole thing could very well be communicated beforehand . Not expected from such a reputed restaurant. Definitely could do better@Subroto Das Supriyo Paul
