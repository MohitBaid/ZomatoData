This is the decent looking food stall among the lot. So thought that quality might be better but then when food arrived it tasted like other food stalls. Only thing I liked was the amount of chicken pieces were okay not like most street food stalls.

Located near New Town bus stand. Very crowded place. You can find lot of fast food items. I have tired noodles and chilli chicken. Food quality is really bad. People simply go there because no other place is available for fast foods.

Seen this place from distance but tasted the Biryani recently. Took a Parcel and had it at home. The Biryani was really nice compared to many small or medium joints. Flavoured well and had a very juicy mutton inside. Would love to try something else and update my feedback.

The place is not so good from hygiene. But that is compensated with good quality of food. It's quite pocket friendly also. Me and my friends went there and tried the fried rice and chilly chicken. The fried rice was a bit too oily but the quantity was good. 1 plate was enough for 2 people. The chilly chicken tasted good and was good in quality.

A nearby place from DLF1 (my office), hence whenever there is a very small lunch plans, we most conveniently order from this place. The taste is good and the quantities are quite huge. We ordered chicken noodles, egg chicken biriyani, tangdi kabab and tandoori(non enough tangdis were available). The noodles tasted quite good, the kebabs were good but a little too dry, may be they were meant to be dry but I prefer the juicy ones. The biriyani was good too, and the quantity ok-ish, enough for single person. But prefer delivery options, never go for dine-in the outlet. The outlet itself is very poor maintained and you will find bird-shits allover. We chose this because our budget was low and no other kebab outlets were available for this range.

I have been frequenting this place for quite a few years (normally on the way to the airport, or back), and have found the Mutton Biryani to be one of the best I have had in Kolkata (have to admit that I have not had it for 6 months though).. Today I decided to try something different.. So, had the Chicken Chop, with Paratha. Although the Chicken tasted quite good, I would reluctantly have to admit that the flavours were a bit strong for my palate, and the after taste lingered for longer than I would normally like.. However, I am sure a lot of people would probably like it.. If this was a Biryani only place, I would have given them a rating of 4 at the least. But all things taken into consideration, I feel a 3.5 should suffice.. Pocket Pinch.. Rs. 110/- for the Chicken and Paratha.

The name of the restaurant is quite deceiving, for not only will you get biryani here but also Chinese and Tibetan. But going by its name, I ordered a plate of chicken biryani, which was just average in consideration that its just a roadside food stall and expecting a proper biryani here would be silly !

Location : New Town Bus Terminus.

Food : Since it's a roadside food stall, ambiance isn't really relevant. Not that it has one !! Ordered the Chicken Biriyani because it's easily the most ordered dish in any Mughlai cuisine outlet and most often most of them do get the taste right if not spectacular. Mostly a take home joint or a sit in front of the stall while Stray dogs disturb me joint.. . Hence brought it home

Quantity was ample but the taste.... One word : Yuck !!!! Don't get me wrong I'm not comparing it with the royalty of Biriyani outlets like Shiraz, Arsalan, Zeeshan etc !! Felt like they only knew how to add keora water to the dish for that classic scent... Color : Bland , Chicken : Dry. The only thing worth eating was the harmless egg sitting in the corner.

Conclusion : If you're unable to rustle up a decent biriyani, you probably won't be able to stay in business for long !! Never trying this place out again unless a famine hits..

Biryani to me can either be good or very good.In my books there's no rating below that when it comes to my favourite comfort food.Being a stone's throw away from my house,I come to this place often.It's generally thronged by young software professionals who work in the IT companies at sector V and live nearby.Hands down this doesn't serve the best Calcutta Biryani you would taste but no one expects that from it either.So good old mutton biryani with aromatic rice,a soft piece of mutton and a perfectly fluffy potato does wonders to the hunger pangs when paired with the chicken kasha from here.Give the chicken chaap a miss because the pieces are humongous and often undercooked.The prices are a little high considering the standards but overall a hearty meal wouldn't burn a hole in your pocket yet satisfy your biryani cravings.Trust me they sometimes get worse than the ones you have for chocolate.

This is located just beside Newtown bus depot. The taste of the biriyani is not something incredible but at times it works perfectly to fulfill my hunger pangs. However the surrounding is too dirty which is why I consider this place to be the last option in Newtown where I should go for buying some food. Also I'm not very satisfied with the hygiene of the food. But the place is a relief for those hungry eyes returning from office & searching for some spicy delicacies before boarding the bus. Some minor improvements will make this place the greatest food hub of Newtown!

Kolkata Biriyanis can be of two types - good and very good! There is rarely a place in the city that serves biriyani which doesn't taste good. Even the road side stalls give you some lip smacking stuffs and surely there are bigger well established biriyani houses in the city that simply blows you away. Being an ardent biriyani lover, I keep on trying several outlets to get the taste of their food and feel of their service. Biriyani Bar is one such small outlet serving good biriyani, sides and rolls in a not so hygienic environment.

Location ---- Located right at the Newtown bus terminus complex beside Mio Amore, Biriyani Bar is one of the most prominent shops there in that small open food court. Newtown bus depot is just opposite iconic Eastern High flats at the Newtown action area-1 crossing.

Ambiance ---- Nothing much to write about, it is a street side kinda stall with few stools placed outside in the open. The place is not so well maintained. Five years back it was still a neat nice looking outlet but now even the floors are covered with soot and you will feel sticky while walking in that area! It is best to opt for take away or home delivery.

Food ---- I have been having their rolls and Biriyanis for last 5 years now, not very regularly though. The quality of Biriyani is still the same but their rolls used to be awesome with generous stuffings few years back which has changed a bit. But you can still try out their egg chicken rolls for evening snacks, its still quite tasty and filling. The rush to grab a roll is very noticeable during the pick evening hours. The biriyani is generally served from a handi which might not be very warm, so its best to take it away. The chicken biriyani comes at reasonable INR 120 with one piece of sweet potato and one piece of chicken, but no boiled egg is provided. The quantity is generous and the quality is okayish, but its not very oily which is a good part.

Service ---- Very mechanical to say the least, not very warm. Though you will face no issues with the service with very less waiting time. You need to place the order at the cash counter and they provide you a slip which needs to be exchanged for food at the other end of the shop where the Biriyani handi is placed. The place charges no extra tax and prices are pretty reasonable considering the quality.

Overall ---- You won't find any street side biriyani stall in Newtown action area-1, so this stall is a life savior for many who are looking for a quick roadside meal at minimum cost. Also its location is very prominent and easy to reach. Only I would suggest to keep this place a bit cleaner, like it was few years back. The quality and taste of food is as expected from one such stall, and if improved can be an additional bonus.

Cheers!

It's a fast food counter serving a variety of food items. From Tandoori to Biryani, kebabs to chicken chaap, it tastes good for a place this small. It's like a usual street side food counter and has place just to sit and have your food quickly. One should definitely try the different kinds of rolls they offer as it's huge for the price they charge.

It's located in the New Town bus stand food complex and is one of the most prominent stalls. They provide home deliveries around the area and the prices are low.

Disappointing joint which serves stale food to customers...

We ordered chicken noodles from this joint yesterday.... to our dismay the food was completely stale. We gave them a call for the issue and they agreed to change the food and provided us with replacement plates on returning the untouched food...... This time the food was no different.... It was just filled with black pepper and sauce to make sure the stale taste was covered.... Little do they know that you cant garnish stale food to make the smell go....... Please avoid if you want edible food as they are cheaters......

It's a fast food counter serving a variety of food items. From Tandoori to Biryani, kebabs to chicken chaap, it tastes good for a place this small. It's like a usual street side food counter and has place just to sit and have your food quickly. One should definitely try the different kinds of rolls they offer as it's huge for the price they charge.

It's located in the New Town bus stand food complex and is one of the most prominent stalls. They provide home deliveries around the area and the prices are low.

Taste of food is good here and the quantity is good for the price. Biryani is not up to the par, so don't go by the name. The place is unhygienic  but ok for some quick grabs.

This place is just opposite my flat and I often grab a quick bite in the evenings. 
The food is unhygenic road side grub.
Tasty. Definitely.
But not healthy at all.
Do not drink the water here.
I REPEAT THAT.
Egg chicken roll for 45 bucks is filling.
The biriyani is overpriced at 150 bucks for the quality they serve

Disappointing joint which serves stale food to customers...

We ordered chicken noodles from this joint yesterday.... to our dismay the food was completely stale. We gave them a call for the issue and they agreed to change the food and provided us with replacement plates on returning the untouched food...... This time the food was no different.... It was just filled with black pepper and sauce to make sure the stale taste was covered.... Little do they know that you cant garnish stale food to make the smell go....... Please avoid if you want edible food as they are cheaters......

The name of the shop really amused me. The food quality is at par with what you will expect when you see the shop or it might just surprise you a bit as well. The service provided is quite good. The taste of food is nog disappointing. An easy to pocket, pick up food corner for all the residents and office goers near by.

Not so good with the food quality as well with the quality. Buy the looks of it you can that the food is not so hygienic... But as for the New town people its a place that will provide the food wen their is no other option. Food is cheap and you have to eat outside, in the open sky. Have tried Rolls-Good, Laccha Paratha-Good, Manchurian- Good, Chilly Paneer- Bad.

Not exactly a place to sit and eat specially at after noon as its open and their aint even a shade. They seriously need to work on hygiene.
Food here is nothing special and slightly over priced as compared to the quality
(The menu here on zomato is not updated). However the chicken biryani here is pretty decent.

Located near the road to NewTown, Kolkata, this place is more of a small roadside cafe than a biryani place such as Arsalan, Haji, Aminia, etc. Even their menu suggests so. These people sell almost all the dishes from chow mein, rolls, etc. On my first visit to this place I was actually doubtful whether they actually sell biryani or was it a new shop which had forgotten to remove the hoardings of the previous shop's name. After I realized that it really was the same shop I went and ordered a plate of mutton biryani to be parcelled. I was really impressed with the pace at which they packed and handed it to me. However I wasn't really impressed with the quality or price of the biryani. Though the quantity was good and it tasted fine but I've tasted better biryanis in the city at cheaper price. The biryani seemed a bit oily and definitely a bit over priced with respect to its quality. I however liked the fact that they provide free home delivery as dining in is not the best idea unless you're a college going student or a young office goers. Overall they have a fine service and I found it to be convenient because of the limited options in the locality.

Well, it's not a bar. Just a pretty take-away counter which makes delicious biryani.
And it really tastes great, and is inexpensive.
Prefer home delivery. 4/5 only for the taste, at the end it's taste that matters.
