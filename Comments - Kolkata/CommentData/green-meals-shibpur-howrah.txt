Awesome food at such a pocket friendly rate... their service is also very good, the best part is it satisfies the hunger needs at late nights and odd hours.

Best vegetarian food in town!

Akash's island sandwich and cheesy fries were both to die for!

If you're in search of great vegetarian food, don't look elsewhere.
