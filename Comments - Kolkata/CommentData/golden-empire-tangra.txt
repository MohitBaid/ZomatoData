This food joint is good. The quantity given in this restaurant is very good.  Szechuan chicken is always on point. 
Staffs are always active and helpful.

Good food! Staffs are well trained and has the ability to suggest what you should go for (in case u have decided not to explore further). 

Large seating arrangements and too many people around makes it little uncomfortable for smaller groups or it's just 2 of you. 

Going back to the food - menu is packed with delicious options and they do serve all of them.. which means options don't just exist in menu but living in the kitchen too ! üçúü•ÇüçΩ

Last time we went to this restaurant we were happy with the food and services. Therefore we decided to visit this restaurant during this puja. But we were really disappointed. They even didn't allow us to enter as we were just two people. They were only giving entry to group because that is more profitable. But this kind of behavior to the guests is not at all acceptable. Will not visit them again.

We had our dinner here. Generally I don't judge decor but when I find it it's an icing on the cake. In this case I don't feel like to share anything about decor, so let's just ignore it. Food is not upto the mark. Schezwan chicken was okay but chilli fish was horrible. I found only cornflour as gravy and some fish piece which is been claimed as chilli fish. Rice and noodles was okay. AC was not working properly. Sorry, my personal experience is very bad here.

Located in tangra's golden enclosure,or in other words The China Town area, is a Bar cum Restuarant serving both chinese and Indian delicacies hand in hand;

Nothing much about the decor, themed in chinese style, with lanterns at places, not heavily crowded for quite a hefty sitting enclosure, for tables are there for both small and large groups; Service is pretty decent, or to some extent thoroughly unprofessional; manager is co operative and friendly , food quality is upto the mark;

I,on my part went there during the durga puja with my friends; although a dry day , but the manager and security guard saved the day for us! We ordered for mixed fried rice 4plates and chili chicken and a pint of alcoholic beverage; the main problem occurred when suddenly the waiter served us another rice plate which led to a chaos ; they serviced the wrong table and then they are asking to pay for their ill management; utter displeasure on our part ; anyways the mixed rice was properly cooked so as the tender chicken pieces;

Improvements required in servicing and customer management !!!!

This place is really good and you can trust on them.
A food named "chicken 65 dry" was famous here.Over the years,the dish lost its charm here.I requested them to bring back that taste,but they failed.Still they used to satisfy me with all the other items they have.recently they have changed their menu.
A must try here is Tuban Chicken and Empire Prawn.The latter is not mentioned in the new menu but this is a trademark dish here.Special mention required for the pocket friendly Prawn Papads here.
Nice 2 floored A.C Dining space.Good service.
Opposite to Beijing at Tangra.Outer look wont satisfy you but this is a must try at China Town.

Went here for a Sunday lunch, surprisingly it was empty. It is located bang opposite of Beijing and has separate portion for family part and bar. We were on a budget hence tried this restaurant. I found it very reasonable and good, the menu included everything all the nearby restaurants have. The taste was unexpectedly very good at this place. We started wit Hunan chicken(dry), crunchy chicken, then for mains schezwan fried rice and garlic fish.
Well the schezwan rice was one of its kind as I never had this anywhere before, neither did it taste like the usual one but whatever it was, tasted really good and was fulfilling two plates were plenty for three of us. All the starters and garlic fish tasted nice and exceeded our expectations from a place like that.
For seeing more customers and a good crowd they should renovate the place soon and revise their menu of food and beverage.

Visited this restaurant in china town just opposite to the famous Beijing. The initial plan was to visit either Golden Joy or Beijing however both the places were overcrowded on the Christmas evening and we decided to visit here which was comparatively empty.

They had their family section on 1st floor and when we entered, the place was dark and had very nominal decor. We sat on a big table in the center and placed order for chicken drumsticks as startar and mixed hakka noodles and chicken hunan for main course accompanied by a beer.

The food was delivered within expected time and was hot. As I started eating, I realised the food is not bad but lacks the magic signature of the famous china town. Alse the service was poor as you literally have to chase behind the staffs to get any order or ask for something. We chased 3 staffs because they did not give beer mugs and after 40 minutes of failed attempt we finally managed to talk to the manager and he managed to get 2 mugs after more 15 minutes. Complete disappointment while you are paying 300 plus huge service charges for a cheap local beer. Service was shit.

The place is a warm and cossy place.
The ambience is very good.
The quantity of the food is just awsome (just like other places in china town).
Situated just opposite Bejing.
The best thing about the place is one of the very few resturants in china town which serves mutton.
Most of the starters are 10-12 pieces and pepper fried chicken is a must try.

This restaurant is located bang opposite Beijing Restaurant and is a five minute drive away from science city. The two storeyed restaurant has dark interiors , with a lot of Chinese lamps hanging from the ceiling. The service was not bad , though we were the only ones occupying the second floor , the rest of the tables being empty . The fried chicken drumsticks tasted good for starters . So did the fried schezuan chicken. The Chinese chopsuey we ordered had enough for three people to share. Its gravy had a white sauce base, unlike the American chopsuey which had e red sauce base . The Shanghai chicken tasted great ,with pieces of shredded chicken in a spicy red sauce base. The food here is average but the ambiance is cosy for dining out with friends and family.

Them ambience of this place is something which I am not too find of. It is very dimly lit, with red lights. The music is also pretty loud for a family restaurant. 

Coming to the food, the quantity and quality of the food is both average. The chicken noodles which we ordered was very oily. The Chicken 65 which is apparently a signature dish of the place was not very impressive either. The schezwan noodles is not worth it as it is extremely spicy and not worth wasting money. 

Coming to the service, the waiter had goofed up our order twice. Very laid back attitude too. Also please be careful when you order water as they won't specify but there is no aquaguard.

Golden empire is located just opposite to the Beijing restaurant. Parking is limited - no dedicated parking place so if its already full you might have to look for other options. A complete non smoking area, most of the stuffs are chinese. We tried crispy shredded chicken, peanut masala and To-bao fish. The chicken was very spicy and taste was nice, excellent use of barbeque sauce added the value inside it. But the fish was impeccable - the taste is somehow similar to the garlic fish that most of us are used to with, however some special touch made this dish more delicious. The prices of the items are fair enough and unlike other china town places, they dont have the segregation of half and full plates. Price of the drinks are within budget, they serve bottles at tables as well. Staffs are very well behaved and always just a call away.

Located opposite to Beijing, this place is near the entrance and its pretty easy to find.

We went there, one Sunday evening. We were a group of 14 people. The only reason for visiting here was, a huge queue in front of Big Boss.

Since we were a group of 14, we decided to go for a bottle of BP. They did not have Antiquity, although it was mentioned in the brochure. Now the, drinks, which were supposed to be served in whiskey glasses, were served in the regular cylindrical glasses which was a put off.

Food is okayish. Nothingspectacular. Although I did find the Empire Chicken to my liking. Prawns which we had ordered, was bland.

The decor is pretty shabby and dull. The waiters, out here, are pretty laid back. One of the waiters, during my last visit, was actually forcing us to leave him a bigger tip.

I am not visiting this place anytime soon.

Located opposite Beijing, this was once regarded as one of the best bar and hotels in entire China town. However, the situation has changed to bad over the years. This place sees dim lighting, shabby interiors, unruly staff and horrible maintenance. Had dropped in a week or two back and ordered for Chicken Garlic Pepper Chicken Dry, Prawn Papads and a beer. The Chicken tasted decent but wasn't of the age old flavor I remember. The Prawn Papads too seemed of an inferior quality. The only savior was the chilled beer. Not really coming back here anytime soon.

Golden empire is one of the oldest restaurants in China Town.

**Location**
It's just when you enter Tangra right opposite to the famous Beijing.

**Experience**
I have been here on a Durga puja evening and got a place after standing in queue for about 20 mins. The ambiance is kind of little dark and little shabby honestly could get the feel properly due to over crowed situation. Food was decent nothing extraordinary but taste was good. Booze is cheap too.

This outlet is located in tangra opposite beijing. I had visited this outlet on a durga puja evening for some dinner and alcohol. This is primarily a dimly lit watering hole. With shabby interiors, disorganized table chairs, dim lights, unruly guests, but well equipped and swift staff, this restaurant is like most other watering holes of tangra. The food was okish.

Located opposite to Beijing, this place is near the entrance and its pretty easy to find.

We went there, one Sunday evening. We were a group of 14 people. The only reason for visiting here was, a huge queue in front of Big Boss.

Since we were a group of 14, we decided to go for a bottle of BP. They did not have Antiquity, although it was mentioned in the brochure. Now the, drinks, which were supposed to be served in whiskey glasses, were served in the regular cylindrical glasses which was a put off.

Food is okayish. Nothingspectacular. Although I did find the Empire Chicken to my liking. Prawns which we had ordered, was bland.

The decor is pretty shabby and dull. The waiters, out here, are pretty laid back. One of the waiters, during my last visit, was actually forcing us to leave him a bigger tip.

I am not visiting this place anytime soon.

Located opposite Beijing, this was once regarded as one of the best bar and hotels in entire China town. However, the situation has changed to bad over the years. This place sees dim lighting, shabby interiors, unruly staff and horrible maintenance. Had dropped in a week or two back and ordered for Chicken Garlic Pepper Chicken Dry, Prawn Papads and a beer. The Chicken tasted decent but wasn't of the age old flavor I remember. The Prawn Papads too seemed of an inferior quality. The only savior was the chilled beer. Not really coming back here anytime soon.

Golden empire is one of the oldest restaurants in China Town.

**Location**
It's just when you enter Tangra right opposite to the famous Beijing.

**Experience**
I have been here on a Durga puja evening and got a place after standing in queue for about 20 mins. The ambiance is kind of little dark and little shabby honestly could get the feel properly due to over crowed situation. Food was decent nothing extraordinary but taste was good. Booze is cheap too.

I visited the place with my friends for dinner. We spent a lovely time there. The foods were really yummy and spicy. The service was good but the last order was served really late. 

Overall the experience was good and price was also in the budget.

This outlet is located in tangra opposite beijing. I had visited this outlet on a durga puja evening for some dinner and alcohol. This is primarily a dimly lit watering hole. With shabby interiors, disorganized table chairs, dim lights, unruly guests, but well equipped and swift staff, this restaurant is like most other watering holes of tangra. The food was okish.

How can I forgot to review it... it was the place where we usually used to go during the puja times long years back... 
The ambience was pretty cool there in comparison with other options available in the area... 
Service was very good... so as the staffs are...
Our main issue of visiting the place was to have drink till losing our memories... and our favorite side was the prawn chips and dry chilli chicken... 
But we had there mixed rice, mixed noodle, garlic chicken and Hong Kong chicken also... and all are very good both in quality and quantity... 
Pocket pinch was quite reasonable...

Cons:
It's small
Offbeat lighting

Bogus food
Restless waiters
Oblivious and paranoid manager

Pros:

Saturday Night..all the big shots in Tangra are choc-a-block, so decided to give this place a try,and guess what it turns to be a pleasant enough experience..Don't know it is the actually the quality of food served or the effects of liquor..But whatever it is, this place has two storeys with a few rooms, we were alloted a table in a Stag room upstairs..The manager is an absolute pro who knows perfectly well how to handle stag groups looking for a chilled out evenings with drinks coupled with a few lip-smacking starters, however the servers lacked experience and efficiency..Coming to the food we ordered:
Fried Schezwan Fish: A great start..12pieces fish was soft and crisp, marinated well with schezwan spices and not over-cooked..
To-Ban Baghda Prawn: 8 generous sized prawns served in a plate..loved the punch in the dish backed by chillies and garlic..must try one..
Mongolian Chicken: 10 pieces of small cubes served in a plate..portions must have been a bit bigger for the price charged..Also the chicken was a tad-overcooked,spices didn't blend well and overall had better version of this dish in other Tangra joints..
Burnt Red Pepper Chicken: Way too salty,otherwise this dish was prepared better than the Mongolian one..the presence of pepper tasted good though..
Mixed Hakka Noodles: Portion was generous and there was enough proteins in the plate..however it was way too oily which kind of pulls back the dish..
Hunan Fish: Liked the punch and the heat in the dish..red sauce gravy goes well with your noodles,however there was again issues with the salt,don't know if it was because the pressure of the crowd at peak hours..
Alongwith it we had a pint of Bacardi White Rum..Overall it was good enough as we didn't expected a fine-dining or stand-out dishes but more of a quaint,relaxed evening with friends..Our total cheque comes to approx Rs.2500/- for 3 people..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5

U cant smoke inside but you have a space to smoke outside the dining room. Now coming to price range i will mark it as average. Food quality is good. Service is also good. U have a parking option too. Interior ambiance was OK. All total Its a good restaurant that comes under your budget.

Tangra eateries have certain distinctive features:

1) The predominance of the colour red,apparently an appetiser.

2) At least one kickass soup,generally the sweet and sour one

3) A brilliant chilli chicken,golden fried prawn,mixed fried rice or at least two of these.

4) Efficient but impersonal service.

This establishment fails on all of the above counts and even the ambience was dark,smelly and dreary.

So was the food,if not smelly,carrying none of the Tangra signatures.My first and last visit definitely.

Zomato doesn't allow negative ratings. The worst chinese I have had in my entire life. Ordered Chilli Chicken and Schezwan Chicken. Both of them tasted the same; which was SHIT! The ambience sucked. All sub standard liquors available!!
When we asked the staff should we ignore the place, he said yes. Such was his attitude. And moreover the check was totally unexpectedly too much. 
Totally avoid this place!!! Better have some Chinese preparations from road side stalls. Even those would taste 100 times better. Guaranteed!

Horrifying food and more horrifying experience is all that you can expect from this place..went here during the pujas,this was the only restaurant that had seats available so went there..the food is horrifying and the waiters seem to be creeps..speaks in some sort of weird accent of English that might have been prevalent in the Republic Of Congo in the times when Genghis Khan was a nursery going toddler , but never ever in some english speaking countries..Didnt understand why they reply to your bengali of hindi queries in the weird accent of english , arey bangla bole chowmein khaowa jaye .. Otar jonno english bolte ba jante hoy na .. Next is the food , everything pls note EVERYTHING served was cold including the rice and noodles .. The noodles smelled of kerosene .. And a guy was there , young lad constantly taking away the ice bucket away from our table , dont know why..
Please avoid this place..this place should be immediately shut down to prevent this embarrasment of tangra and all the goodwill it has gained over the years..

This place i visited with my friends only for the sole purpose of having booze, to our surprise the food served was good enough. The booze comes really cheap at this place as compared to the other competitors in the locality. We ordered for Dragon Rice and mixed fried rice along with szechuan chicken, empire chicken and sweet and sour. Though i preferred the szechuan and all the chicken dishes comes with 12 pieces. The attendants are not at all interested about the customers they are busy with their own work, for four people it cost us about 950 bucks along with the booze. It's quite feasible.

I must say its a place that can be visited once or twice only for the good food and the drinks, with less cash in the pocket these place is worth a visit.

Located strategically at the heart of Chinatown opposite one of the famous restaurants of the locality still this restaurant doesn't gets required attention among food lovers.
 
In starters we ordered Chilli Bagda Prawn and Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken. Prawn dish had 8 pieces for a full portion while the chicken dish had 10 pieces. Both of them were mind blowing but lack of half plate concept and quantity in a full portion is a concern compared to other restaurants here.

In main course we selected Dragon Rice, Szechuan Chicken Fried Rice, Empire Fish and Hong Kong Chicken. Both the rice dishes were unique to itself. Dragon Rice had gravy topping while Szechuan Chicken Fried Rice had topping of crispy saucy shredded chicken. Empire Fish had fillets of fresh bhetki in a mild sauce bursting with flavours while Hong Kong Chicken was on spicy and tangy side. Must try them all and won't be disappointed.

From critic angle the reason of being not so popular is because of its lazy staff who prefers to sit at a corner and chit chat even if new guests enter, eagerness to serve water on table, price on higher side but ambiance and service is inconsistent. Way to family section at first floor is not so clean either. If paying by card then have to come down to pay though they have wireless card machine. Total cost was INR 1712 inclusive all. Will still give it a go from taste stand point and few dishes stand apart.

Oh what a place ! Superb Chinese accurately priced and free memories, that's what you gonna make if you visit this joint with your friends. The service is very smart and good . You will realize how smart they are when you see your bill at the end. They serve limited during occasions but on a normal day its just too good to be true if you compare the quality with the giants like Beijing and Big Boss which I think are unnecessarily hyped. Crispy Chicken and Empire fish stood out for me. So go out , loose yourself and enjoy.

Tangra is famous for its China Town where you will find innumerable little restaurants and a few big ones. All of them are restaurant cum bars, which make them alluring to alcohol consumers looking for a little less expensive place with great food. 

Golden Empire just fits into the bill. The ambiance is good, with chinese lamps and other decor. The waiters are prompt, coached and mentored by Sarkar da who is ever helpful with his suggestions and anecdotes. 

The food is lip smacking, trust me. I've had the best Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish here. It is off the menu and you have to ask for it. Priced at Rs 210, it comes in handsome proportions with an overdose of chilli. We tried the Schezwan chicken fried rice and Mixed fried rice, they were different and well prepared. Not the usual red-schezwan-sauce-dipped rice. We had tried Schezwan Chicken in gravy too, but it wasn't up to the mark. However, the Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish/Chicken is absolutely to die for. 

Make acquaintance with Sarkar da and you'll get a good service every time you visit.

It was good but nothing special. In the main course we ordered the 'Dragon Rice' & ‚ÄòEmpire Chicken'. Food was great specially Empire Chicken. The service was good as well.

Nothing much to write about this place go there if you are looking for cheap booze but yes not every brand is available, the best they had was antiquity I asked for teachers and was told I had to buy a bottle and since I had just another person with me it wasn't a good idea and they don't even have proper whisky glasses at least I didn't get one which was another turn off. Coming to the food we ordered chilli potatoes, hong kong chicken and veg hot garlic noodles and they were just about okay and same goes for the service and ambiance also. Lastly I would say its not a bad place if you are on a budget and primarily looking for cheap drinks.

well , all  i can say is that booze is real cheap here ,  but there is a flip side to that as well  , all you get is middle range drinks , like antiquity blue or royal challenge whiskey , in  whisky  atleast  you  won't  get  higher  range  drinks in PEG form (i.e 60 ml form ) , however   if you ask them they will bring you J. walker  red label @ ONLY rs 2300 PER 750  ml bottle that in my mind is  a  real good deal , considering the fact that J W red label  market cost is rs 1700/ 750 ml bottle . coming to ambiance , in the family section ambiance is   Decent enough  , but in the stag section it is quite ordinary . coming to food  , you can try their BAGDA PRAWN specialities , like chilli fried bagda prawn ( rs 400 ) .  in starters stick to fish as that is their  main speciality . however given everything   , i found their food a little bit on the OILY side for Chinese cooking . overall  very Decent , but nothing out of the ordinary .  But yes if you are looking for a  quiet time with mainly drinks & starters , this is not a bad option ,  located bang OPPOSITE BEIJING Restaurant . overall 2.5 from  my side

been there today evening...situated just opposite to the well known beijing restaurant..
we were a group of 11...
ambiance is ok...
service was prompt probably because it was almost empty at that time...
food was decent..had better chinese in other restros of china town...
but the best part was booze at a remarkably cheap price with some good starters...

overall a good place to booze with some decent 'chats' in an affordable price...

good food... but i didnt like their chop suey dishes...
the added benefits are obviously booze and a place to smoke..
they make good garlic chicken though
..
people can try this place out..
and ya..the service is a lil bit slow..

p.s. they dont have all the flavours of breezer :P i could only get orange and cranberry :/
