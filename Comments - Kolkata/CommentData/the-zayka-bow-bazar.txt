Close to Hind Inox, located this poor looking place Zayka. Their mainly serve both Chinese and Indian. Come and try their Chicken Roll if you are passing nearby. Rolls are worth mentioning.
Also their Chicken Kebab, Reshmi Kabab are high in demand as they are exceptionally good. I have tried them few time and I am very impressed by their quality.
I wish they had a seating arrangement inside.

Zayka is a busy eatery in Bow bazar, lohapotti. I find this place crowded mostly. What I love from this eatery are their, chicken tangri kababs, chicken hariyali kababs, chicken tandoori and chicken hot and sour soup. 
The kababs are really delicious. I don't know about the other items though.

Going from Hind Inox towards College Street you will find The Zayka close or empty most of the time. But I situated there at a time when I got the chance to order a simple Egg Roll as my evening snack.

They use Duck eggs for their rolls & thats what it is known for. But I got my roll somehow in overburden condition & that made all the tastes gone from it. Inside it was mostly empty with little bit of onions. Noticeably no sauces were used but lemons. There was nothing left about taste as overfried condition made it gone. All the items were priced little higher than other roll counters & for that extra bugs you get most worst of them.

Although they mainly make Tandoor items but seeing the unhygienic not maintained system & that worst roll I doubt about their other foods. I must say they have a large space inside but still they didn't make a dining. Probably they don't want to concentrate on this business. Coming to the final words, avoiding this is a better option.

Along the stretch of College Street, there are numerous shops for rolls and so one can easily fill their tummy with that. However, there were couple of occasions when I tried "The Zayka" on my way from Wellington to College Street on foot.
It is located near to Hind Cinema (Hind Inox) Morh, in between those iron shops. It is a small, non-cherishable eatery with no seating facilities providing various types of roll and few Chinese items.
I have had tried egg roll as well as chicken roll and they were okayish. The delivery time of the food is also quite faster.
Even after couple of visits, I could not come in terms with the usage of "The" in their name as they are in way defining standards! 

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Well, it isn't such a stall where you get mouth watering dishes and thus you shouldn't travel all your way just to try this. However, if you are nearby, you can give it a go. But, the saddest part is, the timings of this shop is highly infrequent.

Qs) Why have I rated them 3 stars?
Ans) Taking into consideration the size, quality of food and their infrequency, I would have rated them 2.5 stars. However, since it is located at a good location just on the Nirmal Chandra Street it wins 0.5 stars more.

The Zayka is one of the most popular place in Bowbazar for rolls and Kebabs and also for few Chines dishes.
The thing which you must have from here is the Chicken Roll. They make awesome rolls. The Chicken pieces are large enough and one roll it self will fill your stomach.
I have also tasted the Chinese dishes which are not so good. The Fried rice wasn't good at all.
But you can definitely have their Kebabs and Tandoori Chicken.

Probably the best tangri kebab with mint chutney in kolkata, so soft, tender and juicy. The outlet serves fast food like indian tandoori, chinese, and wraps(rolls). Finding a parking space is tuff. There is no place to sit also, and the dogs will bother you to get leftovers, irritating at times.
I prefer to take away food from here and enjoy it at my home.

I have at times stopped by at this joint  in bow bazaar.  They make  delicious  rolls , Chinese and north Indian . The prices are pretty decent and the quantity is quite filling. The service is quick and friendly. The paneer roll , tarka and lacchaa partha are droolworthy . In totality its one of the oldest in Kolkata and still maintains its subtle savour üòÄüòÅ

Very rude behaviour by the owner.
It takes a lot of time for them to prepare food and the food is not worthy of the time spent after making the order.
I will advise not to go here

I have started eating at this place since my early childhood. My taste buds are in love with its kebabs, tandooris, gravy noodles, chilli chicken, chicken lollipop & even the rolls. The ingredients used are always fresh & food is too delicious. Prices are high, but very reasonable for such quality food.

Typical fast food joint - Rolls , Noodles , Tandoor preparations - Tandoori Chicken, Reshmi kabab , Chicken Tikka Kabab etc. 

No dine in option - a few chairs are put outside the shop for sitting 

I have had their Tandoori Chicken and its good - pretty juicy and soft .

Chicken Reshmi Kabab is okay - lot of scope of improvement .

Over all 3.5 out of 5

For a small shop(in look) ..zayka serves taste beyond its expectation .role is one of best ....fish tandoori is a thing I experienced here....can compete with any  acclaimed restrnt....problem is that you have to stand by the road..or ask for tool ????  ...but test make that upppp.....special chilli chicken is the spicy one ....
For hostelytes it is worthy (8pc) to share ...????
