If I am not wrong I am one of the first customers to have  given business  to HotShot Meals. 

I must say that people working at HotShot have amazed me at a personal level, with their dedication and zeal to deliver the best. With no doubt in mind I can say that their service is unmatched in their area of operations and I am sure with the kind of dedication they have, very soon they will earn a name for themselves in a larger area.

On the other hand every feedback from my side has always been valued. It shows, as they make sure to incorporate any kind of suggestions.

I wish them all the very best for future. Keep up the good work guys..and hats off Nitin. üòä Thank you for your service.

Regards
Suva

Delivery time is very quick. Food was good. I had ordered Mutton Thali. It also had paneer, one veg subji, dal and sweet alkng with rice and roti. Packaging was perfect but I really had a tough time tearing the plastic which is good because the food doesn't get displaced.

I ordered my dinner and found it really worth ordering. It was my first order. However, the delivery was on time and the food was great. I ordered special mutton combo thali. Food was hot and tasty. Prices are really reasonable.Will order again.

It's an amazing place to order food. Food is just delicious. The price is very less. I have ordered food twice however did not find any difference in quality. I would recommend everyone to try.

Awesome food in cheapest price. This is the first time I ordered from this place, referred by my friend. The packaging was proper, got several items in it (2 roti, jeera rice, fish curry, paneer sabji, gobi sabji, dal, salad, bhujia and gulab jamun). All of them looked freshly cooked and were tasty.
Much worth the price.
