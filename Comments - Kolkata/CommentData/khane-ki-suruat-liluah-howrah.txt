LOCATION : Rangoli Mall food court at Liluah....

From the so many kiosk at the food court at Rangoli this kiosk has a very catchy name that will drag you to this place. The name itself gives you an indication that everything starts from here (but thats not in real). Tried their Chicken Tandoori and Chicken Biryani today. Tandoori was okayish with the taste but the meat was too hard. Biryani on the other hand had a good quantity with a potato and chicken. Decent in taste and smelling well, at 160/- this is enough for one person.

The butter nun and chicken do peyaza that we ordered were tasty..though the chicken was too much oily for me..but tasty..the nun was named butter nun..but there was almost no butter on it..very dissapointing...it was little dry and burnt heavily in some places..though we managed to eat..hope they will improve their quality of food..overall an average experience..

I seriously had no idea regarding this mall's and this eatry's existence but sometimes unplanned dates are necessary.. Okay coming back to the place situated at the food court of Rangoli Mall,Liluah... We ordered the combo which served chicken biriyani, butter nun, chicken bharta, two chicken kebabs and raita.. Although they took a little long to serve the food but the wait was worth it.. Each of the dishes were fantastic.. Mouth watering staff.. Keep up the good work..

Not so difficult to find, it is located on the 2nd floor of Rangoli Mall food Court (and Iâ€™d suggest you walk up the escalator to take a perfect view of the whole Food Court and make a place for you to seat and enjoy food ! Yes, you must try the Dum Biriyani here. Its a huge seating area for the food court. In addition, they have decent service speed and the staff is extremely courteous.
                                                                ...

The name is 'khane ki suruat' and this is my third visit here 1st time it was a complete disappointment for me but the second time I am so pleased and overwhelmed with the food and their behavior that I visited third time. We tried:-
Dum Biriyani 4/5 it's amazing and tasty correct amount on the plate to fill one. Chicken was little over cooked and dry.
Chicken Tikka 4. 5/5 it was so tasty juicy and soft. I found this to be their best items.
Chicken Kadai 4.5/5 was super spicy, tasty but only I want to say they should give boneless pieces.
Butter Naan 3.5/5 super soft, well buttered but little over price.
Stuffs are so well behaved this time.
I will keep coming again and again...
