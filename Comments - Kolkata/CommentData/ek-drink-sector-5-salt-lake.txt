The dinner was delicious. The chilli chicken was perfect and so was the mocktail. Would recommend to everyone. The place is big enough for parties, birthdays, etc. Enough space for everyone to have a good time...

Best restaurants of SECTOR 5,
High standards quality food, same taste whenever I visit them. My favorite is Indian tandoor and Chinese. Today enjoying T20 ON GIANT SCREEN LIVE MATCH with my 10 friends. Wow what a tandoori chicken.

Visited this place for office lunch last month. Its a beautifully decorated big and spacious food joint. The environment was excellent. We had Chicken Biriyani, Raita and Ice Cream. The biriyani was very tasty and the quantity was sufficient for me. Overall nice experience. But need to visit once for and try different dishes for a full fledged and thorough rating.

Not value for money.. Name of the restaurant not even justified.. Bottle water,  lime soda and juice are available only in drink section.. We have visited yesterday and it was Saptami.. So they only had a puja special menu card,  totally different from the Zomato. They have provided such a sitting area,  continuous water leakage was there from ac. Now come to the food,  we were 9 in a group and ordered konji crispy chiken,  reshmi kabab,  mixed fried rice, garlic chicken,  lime soda and gulab jamun.. Starter was too bad and chicken was very stiff. Only the garlic chicken taste average and gulam jamun was really good.. But do you know the price?  2 pcs @150. Really disappointed.  Not recommended at all.

It's one of the best restaurant I have been to. It has the best quality of food. You should must come. The big screen catches the attention. The best in Globsyn Cristal. The tandoor and the continental foods are must to be tried. Cool place with family.

I started my pandal hopping this puja with all good food in my tummy at my favourite place EK DRINK CLUB. Watched Live cricket match on giant screen " the only biggest screen in entire Salt Lake ". Had Chinese and Tandoori with my entire family.

Cool place to Hangout!!  
Giant screen to watch LIVE Sports.  
Hot destination of Sector 5 
INDIAN CUISINE and TANDOOR is really the best in sector 5.
Try new item like Mutton KEEMA Pulao , Mutton Rara Punjabi etc. 
Mouth watering Tandoori items.

Ambiance is excellent Very well professionally Manage.
Big screen. Best for LIVE SPORT or even book for watching a movie with family and friend
Good space - 100+seating capacity
Air conditioning is excellent
Off course I had MUTTON RARA PUNJABI the best taste with soft butter Naan. (Will give 10/10)
New place for family to spend time and good food at this new destination in sector 5.

Well, another upcoming café in Sector 5 – but quite different from the mediocre ones!

They have recently opened up in the Globsyn Builsing, nearby the College More. Space is huge and the giant projector screen does catch your attention. This could easily become the next hangout place for IPL and FIFA lovers!

I ordered a special thali comprising:-

(i)	Butter Roti – Nicely done, pretty soft

(ii)	Chhola – Garlic paste reducing its taste

(iii)	Yellow daal – Fine, but should have been served boiling

(iv)	Aloo bhendi - Decent

(v)	Pulao – A true winner

(vi)	Papad

(vii)	Salads

(viii)	Rosogolla

All items were pretty tasty – you can pretty much make out the BONG flavours implying the chef is a Bong himself.

I ended with the mint coated mouth freshener saunf – which was again a winner.

Pocket pinch was reasonable and service is good. Thumbs up to the ambience as well as the décor!

Do visit to have Ek drink or two!

Mediocre decor and very specious. Not much of seating place. Mostly good for boozing and time pass. Food is just average, staffs were nice and well behaved.
