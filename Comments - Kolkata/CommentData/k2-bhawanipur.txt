I tried the tandoori aloo.. extremely good and very different from what Iâ€™m used to. The Mahi fish was also very light and tasty. The Dal is outstanding. So are the Kulchas. The mutton biryani is extremely light, fluffy, aromatic and tasty. I learnt that itâ€™s made with rice bran oil and not the usual sticky, unhealthy dalda that every other restaurant uses, making this biryani, THE BIRYANI of choice for all those who are calorie conscious. Highly recommended.

Nice food. I ordered for Chicken Biriyani and the quality as well as quantity both were very good. Price is quite reasonable. I think I shall order more from here.

Pros: 
* delivery was before time
* quantity of biryani(half) was good
* roll was average  & comparatively less oily than the street rolls and less sauce was there.

Cons:
* only onion was  there in the roll...no cucumber or any other veggie was there.

Had cheese chicken roll here, really delicious and highly recommend! :)
ps it tastes better without sauces! ;)

would really appreciate it if they put some chairs there, they took a loooong time to prepare the food and we had to keep standing after a hectic day of puja shopping which was really uncomfortable!

Finally a place in Kolkata where you can think of rolls beyond zeeshan or camparin. Uncompromising taste, well decorated walls for a take away counter. Glad that we have such wonderful option in neighborhood

A minute from my house , I stopped over this place few days ago to try their rolls . We had their Double Egg Roll and Chicken Cheese Roll . Both were tasty specially the chicken cheese roll . 
The staff isn't well trained and they made mistakes in this simple order of mine . They made the roll without cheese . Well I need to try their kebabs and biryani soon which are overpriced according to the structure of the joint :P

Excellent kababs, dal and biriyani. Run by a group of committed young entrepreneurs-try murg ke sholey- absolutely fabulous. Calcutta needs many more outlets like this and Burger You, a product of passion and quality!!

The Rolls and Biryani are awesome.
Rolls are made with a gravy instead of the usual ketchup and chilli sauce. A must try

The quantity of the half plate biryani is what would be a full plate in most restaurants. And made with rice bran oil instead of dalda, which is always a healthier option.
(As healthy as a biryani can get :p )

Good value for money

Really good food . Recommend the biriyani highly, as they give a huge quantity and also the taste is amazing ... on top of that they use the best quality ingredients which are not unhealthy as most other places. I -- a huge foodie returned with a satisfied tummy and no complains !

Amazing Rolls....especially the Cheese chicken roll....Murg tazi shahi kebab and Darbari Fish are the best when it comes to kebabs....The Indian section also has a good mix of dishes....The Dal makhani  however stand out.

I ordered rolls through Zomato delivery yesterday. Rolls were actually okay and warrant a bit higher rating. But I explicitly mentioned them not to add any ketchup to my rolls. I was shocked to find that they didn't bother to follow my instructions. So one of the persons was not able to eat the food and it was a sheer waste of money. Its the little details that count. Hope they improve on their service.

For the first time, I had ordered a Double Egg Mutton Roll from this newly opened place.Â 
They delivered it to me about 37 mins later, although I was just 4-5 buildings away from this place.
The mutton in the rolls, I had to take out of my mouth to have a good look, coz no matter how long I chewed it, it still stayed in my mouth. Â They should call it "Rubber Mutton Roll" for the customers to have a better expectation of the quality of food offered.

The place is quite small and simply decorated by a wall painting... The staffs were friendly... The service was also fast... The price is reasonable for somethings, but a little high for something... I ordered 3 chicken rolls... The taste is quite good...

Helpful staff, nice clean interiors. Well listed menu card.
You can always stop by to get a roll, biriyani or kebabs.
Hope you visit this little but quite place for some munchies
