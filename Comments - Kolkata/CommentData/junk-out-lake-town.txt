Ordered food from here...a grilled chicken salad and a tandoori salad. The packaging of the salad was great,but the bread was just given bare. A simple paper covering would have been appreciated. The salad itself was disappointing,with too much of lettuce and not enough of other vegetables or chicken. The dressing for the tandoori salad was mustard oil,which was weird but went okayish with the salad. The other dressing,though,had clarified butter and I gave it a wide berth due to its strong smell. Overall verdict: Nope.

Small place for quick and yummy salads, sandwiches and soups. Good and fast service and quite pocket friendly. Nice ambience. A good place to have an evening snack with friends or family.

A newly opened food joint in lake town offers you same items like pizza, pasta sandwiches,salads etc. 
Its a small place with 6-7 peoples sitting arrangement, i ordered for Bar-B-Q Chicken salad with Ice tea and then got their sweet corn soup as complimentary.â˜º
So this place is average  but people with health conscious can opt for their salad which is really good in taste keeping the taste, freshness and crunchiness of the veggies intactðŸ˜‹
