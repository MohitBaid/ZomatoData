It is a decent place with pocket friendly prices at a place like Hatibagan. Chicken kabiraji was nicely cooked and tasted good. The coffee and the kulfi were great too. For takeaway we had chicken haaka chowmein  . . .that tasted a bit average. So in a while it was a quite affordable and decent place.

This restaurant was a lifesaver literally.We had gone here while Pandal hopping on Ashtami night and couldn't find a single restaurant that wasn't full.This is a hidden gem really.We had to use gps to locate it,for it is not easily noticeable,despite being situated right on a busy stretch of road near Hatibagan crossing.The place seems tiny but is not so,for there is a separate ac section at the back apart from the non ac one one would see at the first.But you would have to take your own initiative and ask for seating in the ac section,which is quite decent.The ambience ia that of any medium ranged basic ac restaurant.The food is quite good and so is the quantity but the price is quite high.,but that is quite justified i must say because of the scarcity of eateries in the area.The staff behavior is courteous enough.Hop in with no great expectations and you would not be disappointed,delighted even.Kingshuk Mondal

Dilruba, a north kolkata based restro. I have visited there for two times. First time, I have taken 1 Plate fish finger in starter, after that Mixed fried rice & Chilli chicken. I was dissappointed about their chinese. But snacks items were very good. When I have gone there for 2nd time, on that time also I tried chicken cutlet with salad & Mustard. Even I watched, beside our table, one family orderd mutton kasa. But they were complaining that mutton pieces are coverd by bone. Only for snacks, north kolkata's ambience, u can visit. Cashier's behavior very bad. They have started new AC section.

Really good for Kabiraji and Moghlai paratha. Gives you a feel of those Bengali eateries from the past, with their marble tables and small wooden chairs. I also, tried their Chinese, big mistake, but without a doubt I'm ready any day to dive into that tender Kabiraji meat with some mustard and onion rings. It's low cost too. One downside though, that it's not quite visible from the road if you are in a car, with all the hawker shades blocking your view of the red illuminated sign board.

One of the oldest eateries in North Kolkata. It is a very small place with 4-5 wooden tables and chairs. There's nothing to talk about the decor. With heritage places like these , it's not about the decor or ambience..it's the food. We ordered Chicken and Fish Kabiraji. It was absolutely delicious. Fish was way better than the Chicken. It was not oily like few other places selling Kabiraji. Price was very very reasonable.

It was spicy and lip smacking. Quantity is good to be eaten by 2. Hakka noodles was really good too. Thumbs up for the food and the service.

My brother introduced me to this restaurant. To call it a restaurant would be an exaggeration, it has looks of a small and cosy cabin, fitting perfectly with the descriptions mentioned in old Bengali literature. You'll inevitably find elderly people having food while reading the newspaper. 
Coming to food, we ordered hot and sour soup and their speciality, Fish Kabiraji. Both the items were served on time. The soup tasted delicious with the perfect concoction of spices and sauces present. Kabiraji was crispy and flaky, perfectly aligned with its decsriptions in recipe books. It was really filling as well. 
Service of the waiters was really hospitable. One small incident took place that day and it really makes me praise their services. Our bill was around 460 and before paying that I had already tipped the waiter with Rs 20. While I was paying at the cash counter and due to lack of change the cashier paid me back Rs 50 in return of my Rs 500 note, the waiter put a Rs 10 note from his own pocket. This gesture, which might be ignored by most really took me aback. I would definitely go back to this restaurant with my friends.

I ate most of it and gave very little to Buri... I don't like sharing my food add precisely when I am paying for it... But the converse is not the same... I ate Buri's chicken Cutlet though... It was good...overall the Kasundi is also good...also the mauri and michri... I ate all the michris... Thank you Buri Dilruba.

Dilruba is one of the oldest rooms at Shaymbazar, this place is more of a memory corner than a restaurant. I remember being a kid and my parents taking me here everytime after puja shopping for the mouthlicious chicken moghlai, fish kobiraji and fish fries. And so did most of the north calcuttans. Even today I still check in here sometimes for my sudden cravings of gravy chowmine and dry chilly chicken. They even have got the same people serving for years now. Old and minimal interiors, ordinary sitting area yet pocket friendly good food. Visit this place for a good time, if not a great experience.

An old establishment in Hatibagan, Dilruba is exceptionally hygienic and can accommodate a large crowd. Though the dining halls initially look shabby with basic seating, they are very clean and the kitchen, which is visible on way to the inner dining room, is very well maintained. Service is friendly, attentive and fast.

Coming to food we tried the fish pakora and moglai paratha. The fish pakora had good amount of juicy fish inside each pakora and the masala coating tasted great too. Only if they drain the oil well before serving, this would be a killer dish. 

The Mogai Paratha was a disappointment though. The filling was fat, but lacked seasoning. Again the oil was not drained properly, which killed the taste further. And the filling came out from one side of the paratha, resulting in an overfried filling in that side, which again didn't add anything positively. The accompanying dry potato was superb though. Spicy and garlicky it saved this dish to some extent. 

If you are around visit this place for the fish items atleast. Moglai Paratha is not recommended.

There are places in North Calcutta whose food makes be nostalgic be it golbari, mitra cafe or dilruba. Had been over here months back. What made me try this place again was my craving for a proper moghlai paratha and this place nailed it. The taste remains the same, probably the best in the city !

I remember of trying the Kabiraji here, when I was a kid. We used to come to Hatibagan/Shyambazar area for shopping, and I was often treated with snacks from Maloncho. One fine day, it was someplace else; to be precise Dilruba. A clean and neat place, much like a old-fashioned spot, the Kabiraji was well made, with the perfect infusion of spices. It wasn't too greasy or oily, and had good portion of chicken instead of the masala coating, one can see at most places these days..! Another good bet to try Kabiraji and Moghlai Paratha other than the roadside Maloncho opposite to Town School.

Moghlai paratha, cutlets, kabiraji - that's Dilruba for you. They also cater to the taste buds of Chinese food lovers. Food is good, perhaps not very good but not bland or tasteless either. As far as the eatery goes its not something you'd expect to be very sophisticated or plush or anything, just a decent place serving Chinese quick bites and streetside snacks.

A hidden oldie I must say residing in the heart of traditional Kolkata, Dilruba has been catering to the mass since ages now. Entering this place will make you feel like you are into a cabin styled restaurant which was the trend in Kolkata before independence. The restaurant is however well-maintained and is repaired from time to time.
Coming to food, my personal recommendations are Hasher Dim er Moghlai (you have to order it personally as it is out of the menu card), Fish Kabiraji and Chicken Kasha with Paratha. A statuatory warning upfront - all the foods recommended above are prone to oil content over normal limits and hence should be prepared for that !
The service is okayish, however, a special mention goes to one of the attendants (unfortunately forgot his name) who had been so decent with us down the years and I had personally seen him growing from an adolescent boy serving customers to a fully matured attendant. I specially mentioned that because I have hardly seen a staff working in this industry for so many years in a single outlet. All in all, a nostalgia for me and hence would keep on visiting again and again !

Located in such a place that one won't easily notice it. In the crowded footpath of the stretch between Hatibagan and Shyambazar 5 point crossing. It is probably one of the oldest restaurant one can find in the city and thus it is located in one of the oldest place of the city. Packed with crowd everytime the outside of the restaurant, stays very busy. The restaurant will definitely give you an old Calcutta feel.
I have been goin to this place since childhood with my parents and the thing which i like the most is the Kabiraji. May it be fish or Chicken.
The cutlets are good. Mughai paratha is average. Chicken Afgani once i tried and i didn't find it nice.
Now the dishes are a bit oily so if ur health concious then its not for you. And for hygiene i will give 3.5 out of 5.
Price - pocket friendy. :)

Located in the crowded hustle bustle of hatibagan market. This is basically a cafe style shop for cutlets and fries. They also serve chinese food. The cutlet and afghani are really tasty. The Chinese food is a bit indianised but really tasty to have. Prices are really reasonable. Its an old shop. Interior is that of an old north Kolkata cafe style. A different feel to have food from here.

Simple and traditional North kolkata eatery for quick bites.

 Back in my school days when we used to hang out with friends in the shyambazar area with hardly 70 rupees in pocket, this place always saved the day. The place is very congested and one might have doubts about the hygine factor. Well most of the old north kolkata joints are same. 

 They serve some good quality Mughlai paratha, fish fry, cutlet, fish kabiraji, chops etc, very tasty. However their chinese items are not good. I never liked their chicken chowmin. Price is very light on pocket. So for a casual meal at shyambazar area this is a good place.

There goes my diet! Talking about old is gold.. 
This place is one of them...the classic way to delight yourself. These are the must go places for the North Kolkata people specially for the old timers. Well they are not gonna be the only one from now on to dig in. 
The place and accommodation is specious and clean. So you won't have to  put yourself in the waiting list my friends. 
The old Northern part of Kolkata, the arrangements are like that.
The ceilings are kinda old fashioned, its made of choukaath(in Bengali), I call them rail lines. 
Staffs are polite. 
And the main part of the show the food, great taste.
My favorite is the "chicken Afgani" with the "partha", trust me you won't leave anything on the plate when your done.
And for the price, its very cheap.
Well foodies go dig yourself in.
Nothing more to say.

Check my photos.
Stay tuned...

This restaurant is situated close to the kingbadanti lane. The place is barely noticeable because of all the hawkers and pavement stalls. The restaurant basically looks like the outer corridor if a typical north Calcutta household ,and has a strange old world feel ! There is even a wall clock and a small TV inside! The seating is adequate ,though when I visited this place, I was the only person inside,apart from the lady at the cash counter ! I ordered a paneer babu fry , which is the fish fry version of paneer . The paneer tasted a little bland , but it was easy on the palate and the tummy.

Fish fry and afgani are my favorite here. If one want to feel the warmth of typical north Kolkata food and care, might pay a visit here. But a word of caution, do not expect much, and allow yourself to be engulfed by the nostalgia.

The quality is great, price is about ‚Çπ70...  just to give an idea of inexpensiveness of the restaurant, the same Kabiraji (same size and quality) in Delhi will cost 170 bucks....
