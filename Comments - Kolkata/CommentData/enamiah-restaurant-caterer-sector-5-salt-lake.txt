So this is termed as restaurant but the only thing fresh and always available is there rolls.

Other than Rolls , I would not recommend anything to get from here as nothing they keep is fresh.

Good rolls though:)

Well, the swiggy page suggested the item – “Enamiah Subz Badshah” as their most ordered main course – and I had no option, but to order the same for an office delivery.

Although I have been to almost all the restaurants based out of Sector 5, I am still unaware of the whereabouts of this particular outlet! The constructive Zomato review about this place could not deter me to go for this place, a decision I regretted sometime later!

Delivery was made within half an hour – special thanks to Swiggy – but little did I know that I was about to uncover one of the greatest horrors of my food journey!

The fancy name was quite misleading, and what I received was nothing but a cocktail of mixed vegetable in dry fruit gravy – nothing special as such! It was overly oily, overly sweet, overly expensive (Rs. 170 + packing and delivery charges) and pretty low on taste – a complete disaster!

Packing and service is fine, so is the quantity served – but no reason to visit / re-visit this place again!

This restaurant is beside my office building and I have visit this one multiple times. The biriyani here is quite decent, but the quantity could've been better. The chicken butter masala is quite decent as well. The chicken roll as well as the double chicken roll is good. We have ordered rolls multiple times from here. Also the firni here is good.

well i have gone and eaten in this restaurant quite a few times now but i have to admit that the service is absolutely sloppy and way too slow. The food they serve is no doubt very good but only because of the service it really tires u waiting for the food.

Pretty decent budget restaurant. Decent staffs and good service. We ordered veg biryani and kashmiri pulao. It was okayish... nothing special.

The food is not bad, infact it's fine. However the prices are way too much when compared to the quality and ambience of the place. This small restaurant is located at Sec 5, near Wipro Gate 3. One has to take left from RS Software to reach there. What I didn't like about the place is their hygiene maintenance and service etiquette. There was a hair in one our Biryanis, which we showed to one of the waiters as well, however they didn't have the basic courtesy of replacing the dish or taking the cost off the bill. Visit only if you don't find any other option.

One of the best biryanis I have had till date. It is a tiny outlet which can hardly accomodate 20 diners; not much to say about the ambience, but the food is absolutely delicious, both veg and meat! One should definitely try out their mutton biryani (be sure to mention to the waiter about giving a decent mutton piece, the 1st 2 times I was quite disappointed), and butter naan. You can actually see and smell the butter, the naan is soft and fluffy, unlike the hard crust like things which most restaurants serve nowadays in the name of 'naan'.

It's located beside PS Srijan Tech Park building. I tried it's rolls. Chicken and egg rolls are really awesome. In addition to the roll counter it also has seating arrangements for lunch and dinner as well. Hygiene factors are also maintained by the authorities.
