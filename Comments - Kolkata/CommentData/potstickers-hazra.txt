It's a small, amazing outlet serving mostly Tibetan food. Only a minute's walk from Jatin Das Park Metro Station Gate No. - 1. Pocket friendly yet nicely styled eating joint, mostly occupied with college- goers. We ordered the classic Chicken Steamed Momos and these were so good. The stuffing had a nice juicy flavor to it. But the thing which grabbed my attention was the sauce they provided. It was unlike any of the ketchups I had tasted lately, esp, with Momos. The sauce wasn't at all too spicy. It perfectly went with the juicy dumplings. Will try some more dishes next time I go there.

This place is situated nearly 3 mins away from from Jatin Das Park and is easily visible from the main road. The ambience is not so good and the place is really small with the capacity of 24 people and a bit crowded. And the waiter doesn't take your order; you have to give the order to the manager herself. But the food is really good and the price is incredibly low. I have been there a few times and have never been disappointed with food. With the cheap prices and good quantity of good this is an ideal place for college students. One of the best dishes is the Dragon Chicken which has become my favourite dish there. Would definitely come back here !

I wanted to visit potstickers since many days. Finally went there and I am satisfied. We ordered spicy chicken schezwan fried noodles. The quantity was more than enough and it tasted so so good. I like the decor of the place but the space is small, can't fit in too many people. The stools are a bit high too

Potstickers opened at a place where earlier there used to be denzong. Seeing the menu and the pocket friendly prices this place had been on my wish list. When we arrived the place was relatively empty. I disliked the sitting arrangement which comprised of stools and the table was on a much higher platform. The interior decoration is quite well with wall hangings and flowers contributing to the overall atmosphere. Me and my friend ordered two chicken shezwan noodles. The order arrived within 10 minutes and there was sumptuous amount of well cooked chicken and a lot of noodles. Considering the amount and the taste of food the prices are quite low and this must be on the to-visit list of students especially...

This pocket-friendly small outlet located just few steps from Hazra More/Jatin Das Park which can fit around 15-20 people. Nicely decorated ambiance with high seated chair & life size mirror in wall. Now the main attraction is their food. They serve amazing lipsmacking chinese stuffs. We took Chicken Steam dumplings which is just heavenly in taste & it comes along with a delicious chutney. Next we had Chicken Cantonese Noodles & Lemon-Pepper Chicken & both of them were damn tasty & yummy..Specially the Cantonese Noodles. Do try this one. talking about quantity, their single main course dish is more than enough for two average eaters. Amazingly Priced & their prices are inclusive of all taxes so no extra GST. I'm really looking forward & so keen to visit again. Now it'd be my one of regular hitüëê

This is located near Asutosh college where Denzong Kitchen was located earlier.A small cozy food joint with high stools to sit on.It's a bit difficult to manage ourselves on those stools with a very small table.We ordered
‚óèChicken rice
‚óèHot garlic chicken
The food was okay and nothing to write much about it.This will give you a pleasure of having street food kind of feeling.One thing I must mention, the hot garlic chicken was served with 8 solid pieces but they didn't even give us forks.This was disappointing.Pocket-friendly and nice place for chatting time and again.

This place replaced the erstwhile denzong kitchen and had lived up if not exceeded the expectations... Once we had a party of 25 people cramped into the small place but oh my the food was good....  Do try their potsicker(Duh!). Their noodles and fried rice is heavenly as well...prices are very reasonable and cheaper than most other eateries in the area.... If I had to write a con about the place I would say that the service is slow(even when we were a party of 5) and seats are really uncomfortable....overall great food and great ambience :)

Most of the item on the menus are not available even the drinks.

Comfortable and cozy atmosphere with simple and good food. Any form of gravy noodles are amazing here and so are the momos. 1 plate of noodles/rice is enough for 2 people. -1 because the stir fried Noodles was literally soaked in oil. 
Aside from the oily business in the stir fried department, this place is a perfect bang for your buck!

Located near the Gate 1 of Jatin Das Park metro station, this place is a hidden gem ! It serves awesome potstickers and Tibetian and Chinese dishes ! The chicken Shyapta is a must try ! The drinks could be better and the high stools are a bit of a problem for some to sit atop. But the food is delicious and the prices doesn‚Äôt make a hole in your pocket. If value for money delicious food is what you‚Äôre looking for then this is the place to be ! Enjoy !

It's a cozy place near Asutosh College..we had been there for the very first time. Though the quantity of all dishes that we have ordered were enough for two..but the taste should be much more better..lets come to the food..we ordered-
NON -VEG AMERICAN CHOPSUEY
OLIVE CHICKEN RICE(with a spcl sauce of our choice)
HONGKONG CHICKEN
BLACK BLUE CURRENT(Soft drink)
I ordered chopsuey for the very first time with loads of hope..but the result was not up to the mark atall.i coudnot understand why the preparation was mixed up with such sweetish sauce..as i love spicy food so for me..chopsuey with sweetish taste was not up to mark atall..but one who is not fond of that much spicy dishes..may like it.
Rice was okayish in taste..i loved there chicken preparation..
Food quality may be much more better..but it is really a pocket friendly place for sudden hangout.

POTSTICKERS ... A quaint little tiny Tibetan restaurant where previously Denzong used to be just after the Hazra crossing towards Kalighat, on your left side anyone would think on the first go that Denzong has been remodeled, but then it was the Potstickers just as the name suggests it had the most yummiest Potstickers, be it there sticky basil rice or the veg Manchurian to the steamed veg and chicken momo and the best of the lot the Veg kothay a both sided steamed and fried momo...the black currant chiller was also killer...and all this sumptuous yummy delicacies came to be just good and friendly for our pockets @465/- for such a wide spread.
Yummy Food. Warm Ambience . Great Hospitality. Perfect Hanging Joint with your friends. A perfect start of the weekend with my bestie was a great find.
A must visit place for Momo Lovers

This place is situated in hazra where denzong kitchen used to be. This place is very close to Asutosh College so most of the time is full of college students. Went there today around 3pm to find the place not having much crowd. The ambience was good with nice lighting. The tools were quite high though it was good. We ordered a chicken noodles. It was served quite quick and it looked good too. The noodles was full of chicken pieces. It was light as well as very tasty. The prices are also reasonable and they add no extra tax on the bill. Will be visiting again for sure.

If you're in low on budget and searching for a great chinese & tibetan place then potsticker is your place.

It was my first time visit to potsticker..the pocket pinch is really reasonable..(GST included in the menu card).

Thumbs up for their innovative decoration..Very friendly staffs..

We ordered classic chicken steam momo and pan fried chicken momo.
‚òÜClassic Chickem Steam Momo- 6pcs soft, round shaped,made with proper filling,, served in a small kulo and kolapata,,which was too attractive.Momos given with a yellowish green paste and a bowl of soup.The momo Soup was less salty and full of sliced onion!

‚òÜPan Fried Chicken Momo- "Lajabab"..
6pcs round shaped momo fried with tangy spicy sauce.Dish was garnished with sliced spring onion and coriander leaves.Highly recommended.‚ô°

Potstickers have been opened in place of denzong however the taste remains the same. The space has been utilized much properly with adequate arrangements been done for sitting of customers. Enough adjustment have been done to accommodate upto 10-12 people having high stools. Anyways coming to the food my friend & I had the following:-

1. Steam chicken momos - 6 pcs of juicy chicken momos were served along with green chilli ginger paste and a bowl of onion herb pepper soup. The momos were to die for however i found the dip paste to be unnecessary. The soup also went well with the momos. Recommeded.

2. Chicken pan fried momos - 6pcs of fried momos were wok tossed in spicy sauce along with coriander and spring onions. The balance of flavours were spot on with the dish with the spice factor being kept at a moderate level.

3. Dragon chicken - I was in the mood to try a spicy starter & the counter boy recommended me to have this dish. The generous bowlful of diced chicken were served dipped in super spicy chilli sauce with cashew nuts,crushed chillies,onions & spring onions. Non spicy eaters should really avoid this dish since it is really high on hot factor. The chicken was however inconsistent in texture since some the pieces were fibrous while some were tender The quantity was certainly on the higher side & could be easily shared by 2 people.

4. Chicken Thukpa - A huge bowlful of soupy noodles served with eggs,minced chicken,onion & coriander. The quantity is certainly on the higher side & could easily be shared by 2 persons(if you have availed other items). The taste was on the lighter side & was above average. The perfect filler dish.

The place is really pocket friendly since the per head expense for us came to only Rs 205 each. They¬† charged additional 12% GST in the bill. The service was decent & the food was served within a considerable amount of time. They don't have card payment system & only accept cash. A highly recommended place for students.

I went to potstickers today, with my college friend. It has come up near hazra metro station where the photocopying shops are, at the same area where Denzong Kitchen used to be. I must say that the food offered is pretty nice. It's a nice pocket friendly place to hang out with friends . We ordered "Hong Kong Chicken" , "Chilli Garlic Noodles" and "Chicken Steamed Momos". The steamed momos were the best part of the meal. The thukpa that came with it complimented it so so well. It was a well spiced broth. The Chilli garlic noodles were so so and the chicken was good. They put a generous amount of babycorn , capsicum and onions in the chicken side dish , which is praiseworthy. Most momo joints dont really do this. All in all , I thoroughly enjoyed myself here and will definitely be coming back for more .

Located very close to JD Park. It's a small and newly opened restaurant. Nice ambience with minimal decor. I have been there couple of times. The service is prompt.
I tried their pan fried momo, Kothey Momo and Dragon Chicken. Pan fried momo tastes good whereas Kothey is okayish. I like the Dragon Chicken much but it was served in small quantity which was a turn off.
It's a pocket friendly Tibetan restaurant. So you can give it a try.
( i was exhausted much on both days to click pictures. Apology for that. )

We ordered chicken steamed momo, hot garlic chicken dry, Hong Kong chicken gravy,  spicy mix schezwan noodles. We were very surprised to see the quantity they provide in such prices.Each and every dish was delicious specially the chicken steamed momo. It's located behind the J.D Park, Hazra.

A recently opened Chinese and Tibetian food joint just behind Jatin Das Park. Went there a few times till now as the food is great and price is very much pocket friendly. Tried a lot of dishes here, apart from Thukpa (I like the Thukpa in Denzong more!) liked almost everything. And the best thing is that for the price point they serve more than enough quantity. Only drawnack is that the wait time is bit more than normal. Overall a good little joint to have good food and hangout with friends.

Today I had veg steam potstickers, it's reasonable. They gv 5 pieces. D outlet mainly for take away but few seats r available mainly college grps create crowed there but seating arrangements r not comfortable at all. Excessive high tools n comparatively low wooden tables. Bdw they serve items really a unique way that's interesting part

"These are not momo's. These are hot ball of emotions, that will melt in your mouth. 
With a bowl of soup and tangy plate of chutney to give you a heavenly feeling all together. "

Go and taste it.  If you really want to have a different flavour of momo's in calcutta.

This relatively new joint is where denzong used to be earlier. The place is a little clumsy with music that is too loud for such a small space. We ordered Stir Fried Chicken Noodles and Chili chicken. The food was very light and tasty, but the meat was very chewy, gave us a hard time later on.. :(
The joint is easy on the pocket, and is worth a one time visit.

New joint in town and already gaining popularity. This small space is located very near to Asutosh College and is always filled by students. This place is all about a good hot big bowl of food at pocket friendly prices. The momos are good. The noodles and chicken dishes are filling and scrumptious. 
Service is shaky and the overall environment is a bit loud. You might have to wait out to get a seat during college hours. Do head over if you're in the locality and all hungry, it would make you happy without burning a hole in your pocket.

Previously it was denzong kitchen.. Suddenly it's a new whole thing called potstickers
I was wondering how it'll be. But honestly it's a great great upgarde.. The prices are same.. The tastes same
. Plus in bonus they're offering huge quantities and new extended items.The d√©cor is hugely changed. A all time favourite pocket friendly place.

Awesome food and very pocket friendly but little bit disappointed with the service they provide bcoz it takes a bit long time.. otherwise very much impressive .. mostly it's a take away outlet..
It was little bit disappointment with the momos which should have been served with red sauce instead of green sauce..

Today's experience was soooooooooo nice. Loved the panfried momos, garlic momos, and steamed momos. This time the taste was on point. Loved it. Will go back for more

PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:
I had heard really good things about this place so gave it a try today.
It is a very small place with uncomfortable high chairs and average food.
We ordered simple steamed momos, chicken shyapta, honey chicken, stir fried chicken noodles and Hot garlic chicken.
‚Ä¢Steamed momos tastes good enough but they didn't serve it with the red sauce!!!! Instead the momos were served with a green chutney which didn't taste good and ruined our liking for the Momo. 3/5
‚Ä¢Honey chicken- it had some serious faults. It tasted like sugar dipped chicken in a gravy which was equally sugary. It didn't taste like authentic honey chicken and we had to dip the chicken in the hot garlic sauce for it to taste good enough. 1.5/5
‚Ä¢Hot garlic chicken- 4/5
It tasted good enough and came with good portion of gravy. The chicken pieces were soft too.
‚Ä¢chicken shyapta- 4.5/5- liked this the most out of all the things we tastes. Recommended
‚Ä¢ stir fried noodles- 3/5. They didn't season the noodles or the chicken properly!!!! It lacked salt and all of us felt that. 1plate noodles was good enough for two people.

They must look into the consistency of the food! Also the momos are served with something that doesn't taste good so please look into that. Also replace the high chairs , they're very uncomfortable.

The staff was well behaved but the service was slow. This place needs lots of improvement and all over they need to look into the taste of some of the dishes.

I always wanted to visit this place since it's inception. Earlier at this place denzong's kitchen was located which was another super budget friendly restaurant. It is one of the best places in town for birthday treats. The items present here are exactly similar to the menu of denzong's kitchen and you will find new inclusions too. Here potstickers means momos. The seating arrangements have been changed which I found a bit uncomfortable but the ambiance has now been changed. The behaviour of the staffs were good too. The prices written in the menu card are inclusive of gst. One thing is that the prices have been increased but I must say they have increased the quantity too. Chicken shyapta is awesome as usual, same for potstickers.

Since its inception I wanted to visit this eatery, and finally we visited this place and tried their Tibetan delicacies. This is a pocket friendly food joint with good quality of foods. We tried their pan-fried potstickers, chicken gyathuk and crispy chicken (we specifically asked for crispy chicken starter and they provided this dish). I wanted to try their bao, but for some reason it wasn't available.
The pan-fried chicken potstickers were heavenly. With crispy outer shell and juicy chicken fillings, combined with the sweet sour spicey sauce.......it was one of the best (if not the best) pan-fried chicken momo I have ever tasted. 
The crispy chicken starter was good. The chicken was moist and tender, the outer coating was light and wasn't as crispy as I thought it would be. 
Finally the gyathuk; it was also very very good. Thick noodles with a slight chew,  light aromatic flavourful broth with lots of chicken mince and a hard boiled egg........it was awsome. 
Although the sitting arrangements was somewhat odd and the place feel a bit congested, but the quality of the food compensate for that. Overall my experience with this food joint was great.
I have only one suggestion.....in my opinion it would have been better if the egg in the gyathuk was half boiled (like in Japanese ramen). That's just my opinion.

I have been here twice. It's a really nice place to hangout with friends. The interior is really good. So far i have tried their momo(potstickers according to menu name), kothey and American chopsuey. Momo and kothey are awesome in taste and the unique thing is that they provide a chutney and its delicious to have with momos. Whereas American chopsuey did let me down as it not like anything i had in other places.

One fine evening a couple of months back we had decided to go to the Hazra outlet of Denzong's when we discovered that the Denzong's has shut its doors at yet another one of their branches. The first being Gariahat. But the place looked sleek and we somehow smelled Tibetan food so we walked in to the outlet to find an intensely done up interior; with bar chairs, totems, Tibetan Handicrafts, funky bamboo work and Thangka paintings. To our surprise the menu comprised the same items at inflated rates with the amount of inflation varying from item to item. We ordered chicken steam momos. Since the new operators were still trying to get a hang of things service was pretty delayed. The momos were served in miniature husk removing apparatuses (called Kulo in Bengali) which was a pretty sight. The momos tasted the same though maybe they had shrinked a little in size. The usual momo sauce was replaced with a green pudina paste which enhanced the taste of the momos (though tomato ketchup and the Denzong momo sauce is also available) . Thumbs up for that. The other thing noticeable was the soup served with the momos which wasn't available earlier. The broth was quite well prepared and filled with veggies. The chairs however will prevent you from spending a lot of time at this joint as it is very very uncomfortable to sit on those bar chairs for anything more than 15 mins.

This place seemed ideal for sudden Chinese or Tibetan food cravings. Their Momos which they call Potstickers are superb.
We also tried Chicken Pineapple Peanuts: the crunchy peanuts with bell peppers in the pineapple flavoured tangy sauce is a delight, the chicken softness should be worked on though.
Chicken Shya flay; it was prepared as it should be has the same filling as the momo but the cover is fried. I personally won't take it again.
They didn't have any Chillers to offer from the menu which was the first negative point. Secondly, their AC was not working. Imagine having hot momos in Kolkata's humidity.
So that explains the rating. Service is very average.

And we also ordered dragon chicken which was veey spicy but u will get a little sweetness too.. So over all food is really good.. There r lots of varieties on menu but sadly lots of items were not available maybe because of puja.. And the pricing is also reasonable so it was good

After a hectic day ,we decided to have some good momos at this newly buzzing joint of kolkata which is located exactly at the same place where the previous denzong was located. They made good usage of such a cramped place with 6 tables accommodating around 24 people. So we ordered chicken sha fhalley which wasn't available , then we ordered meat balls which wasn't available again ! After much disappointment we settled for pan-fried chicken momo and steamed chicken momo. 
Pan-fried chicken momo - It was juicy with right amount of spices and the gravy was to die for. 
Chicken steamed momo - This is what we call authentic steamed momo , and there was a sauce served with it which was a perfect compliment to the momos. 
Loaded with generous amount of chicken both the momos were amazing. The place is reasonably priced and they don't charge GST yet. Since many dishes were unavailable I can't rate them 4.0. I hope they look into the matter.

I recently visited Potstickers and was pleasantly surprised. Although it is a very small joint with not the most comfortable seating, the food is definitely worth the visit. We ordered pan fried dumplings and steamed dumplings- both very nice. The condiment they served with it was a refreshing change from the usual chilly sauce. The american chopsuey and chilly garlic noodles didn't disappoint either. Hearty portions. Calling it pocket friendly would be an understatement. I will most certainly be ordering in again.

Ordered via swiggy today. Order took a while. However, coming to the food ordered ie. Chicken Potstickers Momo (Steamed) and  ManchowSoup.
The Momos were good however nothing to rave about .The size was small and filling well found more onions than chicken . Still was not completely bad.
The soup was however delicious ...Not much spicy but perfect taste and had ample chicken and veggies.

There remains however room for much improvement.
Pricing pretty much economic.
Would like to taste more from their menu.

Happy Eating

They have this place where the Denzong Kitchen used to be, earlier. Went there today with a friend, the seats are very uncomfortable! The food is cheap and more or less good! We ordered pan fried chicken dumplings and Shay phalae, the dumplings were tasty, but very small in size! The shay phalae wasn't so good, the outer crust had become hard and it lacked salt. Moderate experience, overall.

This restaurant is opened in Hazra more area in the back side lane of renowned Asutosh College where previously Denzong kitchen was located. They have renovated the place with some new sitting arrangements and opened up a Chinese cum Tibetan food joint. Dining space is small but well arranged. They have arranged tall stools for sitting which was quite uncomfortable for me to seat but it's otherwise okay. Our today's order was short including,
* Chicken Stir Fried Rice
* Dragon Chicken
Food was served within 10 to 15 minutes and at first look it impressed us. The Dragon Chicken tasted too yummy. It's a spicy dish prepared in a spicy sauce. If you love spicy foods you'll surely love the dish. Chicken Rice was very good both in quality and quantity. Dragon Chicken was served in a huge amount in such an affordable price that it could be shared among two to three people easily. All over it's a nice place to have tummy filled meal at pocket friendly prices. No tax added on the bill. Definitely visiting again to grab more tasty treats.

This is a newly opened restaurant in place of denzong kitchen and is as good as denzong. The managers over there are very friendly. We celebrated our friend's birthday over there and the manager (the cute girl) offered us a knife to cut the cake and they even played happy birthday song for us. That was really very sweet of them.
Now coming to food I'm just in love with that place, the food.

Decent place for a quick bite. There service is good and the place is clean. We ordered chicken in bbq sauce, chicken noodles and chicken thukpa.
Every dish tasted just right. The quantity of the noodles was right according to the price. The taste of the noodles were also good but I felt it was slightly under spiced. There were ample chunks of chicken in it.
The thukpa was just great. The quantity was more than enough and it would be difficult to finish for a single person unless really hungry. The  flavors were perfectly balanced and had large amount of minced chicken.
Finally the chicken in bbq sauce. It was simply rocking and probably the best dish among the three.
Overall a good place to hangout with your friends on a lazy afternoon.
P.S -they have slightly increased the prices and they no longer match with the menu on zomato

It has a great ambience and very friendly staff. The restaurant is where Denzong Kitchen at Hazra was, and is a major redecoration and rebranding of Denzong. They retain the chef and menu (and have added few dishes to it), through this remodelling. An improvement on Denzong, definitely. The food is as good at it can be, and comes at a pocket friendly price.

It's a small, amazing outlet serving mostly Tibetan food. Only a minute's walk from Jatin Das Park Metro Station Gate No. - 1. Pocket friendly yet nicely styled eating joint, mostly occupied with college- goers. We ordered the classic Chicken Steamed Momos and these were so good. The stuffing had a nice juicy flavor to it. But the thing which grabbed my attention was the sauce they provided. It was unlike any of the ketchups I had tasted lately, esp, with Momos. The sauce wasn't at all too spicy. It perfectly went with the juicy dumplings. Will try some more dishes next time I go there.

This place is situated nearly 3 mins away from from Jatin Das Park and is easily visible from the main road. The ambience is not so good and the place is really small with the capacity of 24 people and a bit crowded. And the waiter doesn't take your order; you have to give the order to the manager herself. But the food is really good and the price is incredibly low. I have been there a few times and have never been disappointed with food. With the cheap prices and good quantity of good this is an ideal place for college students. One of the best dishes is the Dragon Chicken which has become my favourite dish there. Would definitely come back here !

I wanted to visit potstickers since many days. Finally went there and I am satisfied. We ordered spicy chicken schezwan fried noodles. The quantity was more than enough and it tasted so so good. I like the decor of the place but the space is small, can't fit in too many people. The stools are a bit high too

Potstickers opened at a place where earlier there used to be denzong. Seeing the menu and the pocket friendly prices this place had been on my wish list. When we arrived the place was relatively empty. I disliked the sitting arrangement which comprised of stools and the table was on a much higher platform. The interior decoration is quite well with wall hangings and flowers contributing to the overall atmosphere. Me and my friend ordered two chicken shezwan noodles. The order arrived within 10 minutes and there was sumptuous amount of well cooked chicken and a lot of noodles. Considering the amount and the taste of food the prices are quite low and this must be on the to-visit list of students especially...

One of the best Tibetan and Chinese i have so far had! Totally pocket friendly and worth the price!
This place is located in hazra and a little small, A LITTLE CLAUSTROPHOBIC YOU CAN FEEL !  BUT HEY ONCE YOU START EATING, THE ONLY FOCUS OF YOUR ATTENTION  WILL BE THE SUPER TASTY FOOD!!!  IT  has high lifted seats... And the seating style is different! I like it!!!!
But trust me if you have no matter less money or more money in your pocket, this is one of the best choices you will make to prevent regrets and fill your hungry tummy with some yum yum delicious food!

Pure Bliss!! & my new loveüíó Wish I could rate it with more starsü§óü§ó
This pocket-friendly small outlet located just few steps from Hazra More/Jatin Das Park which can fit around 15-20 people. Nicely decorated ambiance with high seated chair & life size mirror in wall. Now the main attraction is their food. They serve amazing lipsmacking chinese stuffs. We took Chicken Steam dumplings which is just heavenly in taste & it comes along with a delicious chutney. Next we had Chicken Cantonese Noodles & Lemon-Pepper Chicken & both of them were damn tasty & yummy..Specially the Cantonese Noodles. Do try this one. talking about quantity, their single main course dish is more than enough for two average eaters. Amazingly Priced & their prices are inclusive of all taxes so no extra GST. I'm really looking forward & so keen to visit again. Now it'd be my one of regular hitüëê

This is located near Asutosh college where Denzong Kitchen was located earlier.A small cozy food joint with high stools to sit on.It's a bit difficult to manage ourselves on those stools with a very small table.We ordered
‚óèChicken rice
‚óèHot garlic chicken
The food was okay and nothing to write much about it.This will give you a pleasure of having street food kind of feeling.One thing I must mention, the hot garlic chicken was served with 8 solid pieces but they didn't even give us forks.This was disappointing.Pocket-friendly and nice place for chatting time and again.

This place replaced the erstwhile denzong kitchen and had lived up if not exceeded the expectations... Once we had a party of 25 people cramped into the small place but oh my the food was good....  Do try their potsicker(Duh!). Their noodles and fried rice is heavenly as well...prices are very reasonable and cheaper than most other eateries in the area.... If I had to write a con about the place I would say that the service is slow(even when we were a party of 5) and seats are really uncomfortable....overall great food and great ambience :)

Located where denzong was earlier. 

Most of the item on the menus are not available even the drinks.

So we tried Corn and mushroom rice, manchurian chicken and chicken with pineapple peanuts. Quality wise okaeish and quantity is very good.

Comfortable and cozy atmosphere with simple and good food. Any form of gravy noodles are amazing here and so are the momos. 1 plate of noodles/rice is enough for 2 people. -1 because the stir fried Noodles was literally soaked in oil. 
Aside from the oily business in the stir fried department, this place is a perfect bang for your buck!

Located near the Gate 1 of Jatin Das Park metro station, this place is a hidden gem ! It serves awesome potstickers and Tibetian and Chinese dishes ! The chicken Shyapta is a must try ! The drinks could be better and the high stools are a bit of a problem for some to sit atop. But the food is delicious and the prices doesn‚Äôt make a hole in your pocket. If value for money delicious food is what you‚Äôre looking for then this is the place to be ! Enjoy !

It's a cozy place near Asutosh College..we had been there for the very first time. Though the quantity of all dishes that we have ordered were enough for two..but the taste should be much more better..lets come to the food..we ordered-
NON -VEG AMERICAN CHOPSUEY
OLIVE CHICKEN RICE(with a spcl sauce of our choice)
HONGKONG CHICKEN
BLACK BLUE CURRENT(Soft drink)
I ordered chopsuey for the very first time with loads of hope..but the result was not up to the mark atall.i coudnot understand why the preparation was mixed up with such sweetish sauce..as i love spicy food so for me..chopsuey with sweetish taste was not up to mark atall..but one who is not fond of that much spicy dishes..may like it.
Rice was okayish in taste..i loved there chicken preparation..
Food quality may be much more better..but it is really a pocket friendly place for sudden hangout.

POTSTICKERS ... A quaint little tiny Tibetan restaurant where previously Denzong used to be just after the Hazra crossing towards Kalighat, on your left side anyone would think on the first go that Denzong has been remodeled, but then it was the Potstickers just as the name suggests it had the most yummiest Potstickers, be it there sticky basil rice or the veg Manchurian to the steamed veg and chicken momo and the best of the lot the Veg kothay a both sided steamed and fried momo...the black currant chiller was also killer...and all this sumptuous yummy delicacies came to be just good and friendly for our pockets @465/- for such a wide spread.
Yummy Food. Warm Ambience . Great Hospitality. Perfect Hanging Joint with your friends. A perfect start of the weekend with my bestie was a great find.
A must visit place for Momo Lovers

This place is situated in hazra where denzong kitchen used to be. This place is very close to Asutosh College so most of the time is full of college students. Went there today around 3pm to find the place not having much crowd. The ambience was good with nice lighting. The tools were quite high though it was good. We ordered a chicken noodles. It was served quite quick and it looked good too. The noodles was full of chicken pieces. It was light as well as very tasty. The prices are also reasonable and they add no extra tax on the bill. Will be visiting again for sure.

If you're in low on budget and searching for a great chinese & tibetan place then potsticker is your place.

It was my first time visit to potsticker..the pocket pinch is really reasonable..(GST included in the menu card).

Thumbs up for their innovative decoration..Very friendly staffs..

We ordered classic chicken steam momo and pan fried chicken momo.
‚òÜClassic Chickem Steam Momo- 6pcs soft, round shaped,made with proper filling,, served in a small kulo and kolapata,,which was too attractive.Momos given with a yellowish green paste and a bowl of soup.The momo Soup was less salty and full of sliced onion!

‚òÜPan Fried Chicken Momo- "Lajabab"..
6pcs round shaped momo fried with tangy spicy sauce.Dish was garnished with sliced spring onion and coriander leaves.Highly recommended.‚ô°

Potstickers have been opened in place of denzong however the taste remains the same. The space has been utilized much properly with adequate arrangements been done for sitting of customers. Enough adjustment have been done to accommodate upto 10-12 people having high stools. Anyways coming to the food my friend & I had the following:-

1. Steam chicken momos - 6 pcs of juicy chicken momos were served along with green chilli ginger paste and a bowl of onion herb pepper soup. The momos were to die for however i found the dip paste to be unnecessary. The soup also went well with the momos. Recommeded.

2. Chicken pan fried momos - 6pcs of fried momos were wok tossed in spicy sauce along with coriander and spring onions. The balance of flavours were spot on with the dish with the spice factor being kept at a moderate level.

3. Dragon chicken - I was in the mood to try a spicy starter & the counter boy recommended me to have this dish. The generous bowlful of diced chicken were served dipped in super spicy chilli sauce with cashew nuts,crushed chillies,onions & spring onions. Non spicy eaters should really avoid this dish since it is really high on hot factor. The chicken was however inconsistent in texture since some the pieces were fibrous while some were tender The quantity was certainly on the higher side & could be easily shared by 2 people.

4. Chicken Thukpa - A huge bowlful of soupy noodles served with eggs,minced chicken,onion & coriander. The quantity is certainly on the higher side & could easily be shared by 2 persons(if you have availed other items). The taste was on the lighter side & was above average. The perfect filler dish.

The place is really pocket friendly since the per head expense for us came to only Rs 205 each. They¬† charged additional 12% GST in the bill. The service was decent & the food was served within a considerable amount of time. They don't have card payment system & only accept cash. A highly recommended place for students.

I went to potstickers today, with my college friend. It has come up near hazra metro station where the photocopying shops are, at the same area where Denzong Kitchen used to be. I must say that the food offered is pretty nice. It's a nice pocket friendly place to hang out with friends . We ordered "Hong Kong Chicken" , "Chilli Garlic Noodles" and "Chicken Steamed Momos". The steamed momos were the best part of the meal. The thukpa that came with it complimented it so so well. It was a well spiced broth. The Chilli garlic noodles were so so and the chicken was good. They put a generous amount of babycorn , capsicum and onions in the chicken side dish , which is praiseworthy. Most momo joints dont really do this. All in all , I thoroughly enjoyed myself here and will definitely be coming back for more .

Located very close to JD Park. It's a small and newly opened restaurant. Nice ambience with minimal decor. I have been there couple of times. The service is prompt.
I tried their pan fried momo, Kothey Momo and Dragon Chicken. Pan fried momo tastes good whereas Kothey is okayish. I like the Dragon Chicken much but it was served in small quantity which was a turn off.
It's a pocket friendly Tibetan restaurant. So you can give it a try.
( i was exhausted much on both days to click pictures. Apology for that. )

A recently opened Chinese and Tibetian food joint just behind Jatin Das Park. Went there a few times till now as the food is great and price is very much pocket friendly. Tried a lot of dishes here, apart from Thukpa (I like the Thukpa in Denzong more!) liked almost everything. And the best thing is that for the price point they serve more than enough quantity. Only drawnack is that the wait time is bit more than normal. Overall a good little joint to have good food and hangout with friends.

This relatively new joint is where denzong used to be earlier. The place is a little clumsy with music that is too loud for such a small space. We ordered Stir Fried Chicken Noodles and Chili chicken. The food was very light and tasty, but the meat was very chewy, gave us a hard time later on.. :(
The joint is easy on the pocket, and is worth a one time visit.

New joint in town and already gaining popularity. This small space is located very near to Asutosh College and is always filled by students. This place is all about a good hot big bowl of food at pocket friendly prices. The momos are good. The noodles and chicken dishes are filling and scrumptious. 
Service is shaky and the overall environment is a bit loud. You might have to wait out to get a seat during college hours. Do head over if you're in the locality and all hungry, it would make you happy without burning a hole in your pocket.

Today's experience was soooooooooo nice. Loved the panfried momos, garlic momos, and steamed momos. This time the taste was on point. Loved it. Will go back for more

PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:
I had heard really good things about this place so gave it a try today.
It is a very small place with uncomfortable high chairs and average food.
We ordered simple steamed momos, chicken shyapta, honey chicken, stir fried chicken noodles and Hot garlic chicken.
‚Ä¢Steamed momos tastes good enough but they didn't serve it with the red sauce!!!! Instead the momos were served with a green chutney which didn't taste good and ruined our liking for the Momo. 3/5
‚Ä¢Honey chicken- it had some serious faults. It tasted like sugar dipped chicken in a gravy which was equally sugary. It didn't taste like authentic honey chicken and we had to dip the chicken in the hot garlic sauce for it to taste good enough. 1.5/5
‚Ä¢Hot garlic chicken- 4/5
It tasted good enough and came with good portion of gravy. The chicken pieces were soft too.
‚Ä¢chicken shyapta- 4.5/5- liked this the most out of all the things we tastes. Recommended
‚Ä¢ stir fried noodles- 3/5. They didn't season the noodles or the chicken properly!!!! It lacked salt and all of us felt that. 1plate noodles was good enough for two people.

They must look into the consistency of the food! Also the momos are served with something that doesn't taste good so please look into that. Also replace the high chairs , they're very uncomfortable.

The staff was well behaved but the service was slow. This place needs lots of improvement and all over they need to look into the taste of some of the dishes.

I ordered one chicken fried rice and one chicken side dish through swiggy app.
 The food was worst and above all there was a piece of hair in chicken side dish.
I informed about this to swiggy customer service.
But they didn't solve my problem.
Anyway do not go to the restaurant.
Worst food i have ever eaten.

I always wanted to visit this place since it's inception. Earlier at this place denzong's kitchen was located which was another super budget friendly restaurant. It is one of the best places in town for birthday treats. The items present here are exactly similar to the menu of denzong's kitchen and you will find new inclusions too. Here potstickers means momos. The seating arrangements have been changed which I found a bit uncomfortable but the ambiance has now been changed. The behaviour of the staffs were good too. The prices written in the menu card are inclusive of gst. One thing is that the prices have been increased but I must say they have increased the quantity too. Chicken shyapta is awesome as usual, same for potstickers.

This is an amazing place to grab some authentic Tibetan food. I always end up here when I crave for spicy taste. The Chinese is also amazing. Prices are super cheap and can be very satisfying.

Since its inception I wanted to visit this eatery, and finally we visited this place and tried their Tibetan delicacies. This is a pocket friendly food joint with good quality of foods. We tried their pan-fried potstickers, chicken gyathuk and crispy chicken (we specifically asked for crispy chicken starter and they provided this dish). I wanted to try their bao, but for some reason it wasn't available.
The pan-fried chicken potstickers were heavenly. With crispy outer shell and juicy chicken fillings, combined with the sweet sour spicey sauce.......it was one of the best (if not the best) pan-fried chicken momo I have ever tasted. 
The crispy chicken starter was good. The chicken was moist and tender, the outer coating was light and wasn't as crispy as I thought it would be. 
Finally the gyathuk; it was also very very good. Thick noodles with a slight chew,  light aromatic flavourful broth with lots of chicken mince and a hard boiled egg........it was awsome. 
Although the sitting arrangements was somewhat odd and the place feel a bit congested, but the quality of the food compensate for that. Overall my experience with this food joint was great.
I have only one suggestion.....in my opinion it would have been better if the egg in the gyathuk was half boiled (like in Japanese ramen). That's just my opinion.

I have been here twice. It's a really nice place to hangout with friends. The interior is really good. So far i have tried their momo(potstickers according to menu name), kothey and American chopsuey. Momo and kothey are awesome in taste and the unique thing is that they provide a chutney and its delicious to have with momos. Whereas American chopsuey did let me down as it not like anything i had in other places.

One fine evening a couple of months back we had decided to go to the Hazra outlet of Denzong's when we discovered that the Denzong's has shut its doors at yet another one of their branches. The first being Gariahat. But the place looked sleek and we somehow smelled Tibetan food so we walked in to the outlet to find an intensely done up interior; with bar chairs, totems, Tibetan Handicrafts, funky bamboo work and Thangka paintings. To our surprise the menu comprised the same items at inflated rates with the amount of inflation varying from item to item. We ordered chicken steam momos. Since the new operators were still trying to get a hang of things service was pretty delayed. The momos were served in miniature husk removing apparatuses (called Kulo in Bengali) which was a pretty sight. The momos tasted the same though maybe they had shrinked a little in size. The usual momo sauce was replaced with a green pudina paste which enhanced the taste of the momos (though tomato ketchup and the Denzong momo sauce is also available) . Thumbs up for that. The other thing noticeable was the soup served with the momos which wasn't available earlier. The broth was quite well prepared and filled with veggies. The chairs however will prevent you from spending a lot of time at this joint as it is very very uncomfortable to sit on those bar chairs for anything more than 15 mins.

This place seemed ideal for sudden Chinese or Tibetan food cravings. Their Momos which they call Potstickers are superb.
We also tried Chicken Pineapple Peanuts: the crunchy peanuts with bell peppers in the pineapple flavoured tangy sauce is a delight, the chicken softness should be worked on though.
Chicken Shya flay; it was prepared as it should be has the same filling as the momo but the cover is fried. I personally won't take it again.
They didn't have any Chillers to offer from the menu which was the first negative point. Secondly, their AC was not working. Imagine having hot momos in Kolkata's humidity.
So that explains the rating. Service is very average.

We ordered a pan fried momo which was absolutely delicious.. And a classic chicken steam momo.. Which was also tasty but the soup with it was not that good.. And we also ordered dragon chicken which was veey spicy but u will get a little sweetness too.. So over all food is really good.. There r lots of varieties on menu but sadly lots of items were not available maybe because of puja.. And the pricing is also reasonable so it was good

After a hectic day ,we decided to have some good momos at this newly buzzing joint of kolkata which is located exactly at the same place where the previous denzong was located. They made good usage of such a cramped place with 6 tables accommodating around 24 people. So we ordered chicken sha fhalley which wasn't available , then we ordered meat balls which wasn't available again ! After much disappointment we settled for pan-fried chicken momo and steamed chicken momo. 
Pan-fried chicken momo - It was juicy with right amount of spices and the gravy was to die for. 
Chicken steamed momo - This is what we call authentic steamed momo , and there was a sauce served with it which was a perfect compliment to the momos. 
Loaded with generous amount of chicken both the momos were amazing. The place is reasonably priced and they don't charge GST yet. Since many dishes were unavailable I can't rate them 4.0. I hope they look into the matter.

I recently visited Potstickers and was pleasantly surprised. Although it is a very small joint with not the most comfortable seating, the food is definitely worth the visit. We ordered pan fried dumplings and steamed dumplings- both very nice. The condiment they served with it was a refreshing change from the usual chilly sauce. The american chopsuey and chilly garlic noodles didn't disappoint either. Hearty portions. Calling it pocket friendly would be an understatement. I will most certainly be ordering in again.

Ordered via swiggy today. Order took a while. However, coming to the food ordered ie. Chicken Potstickers Momo (Steamed) and  ManchowSoup.
The Momos were good however nothing to rave about .The size was small and filling well found more onions than chicken . Still was not completely bad.
The soup was however delicious ...Not much spicy but perfect taste and had ample chicken and veggies.

There remains however room for much improvement.
Pricing pretty much economic.
Would like to taste more from their menu.

Happy Eating

They have this place where the Denzong Kitchen used to be, earlier. Went there today with a friend, the seats are very uncomfortable! The food is cheap and more or less good! We ordered pan fried chicken dumplings and Shay phalae, the dumplings were tasty, but very small in size! The shay phalae wasn't so good, the outer crust had become hard and it lacked salt. Moderate experience, overall.

This restaurant is opened in Hazra more area in the back side lane of renowned Asutosh College where previously Denzong kitchen was located. They have renovated the place with some new sitting arrangements and opened up a Chinese cum Tibetan food joint. Dining space is small but well arranged. They have arranged tall stools for sitting which was quite uncomfortable for me to seat but it's otherwise okay. Our today's order was short including,
* Chicken Stir Fried Rice
* Dragon Chicken
Food was served within 10 to 15 minutes and at first look it impressed us. The Dragon Chicken tasted too yummy. It's a spicy dish prepared in a spicy sauce. If you love spicy foods you'll surely love the dish. Chicken Rice was very good both in quality and quantity. Dragon Chicken was served in a huge amount in such an affordable price that it could be shared among two to three people easily. All over it's a nice place to have tummy filled meal at pocket friendly prices. No tax added on the bill. Definitely visiting again to grab more tasty treats.

For the first time I visit this place...Cool place for friends and couples also...Music is good
We ordered Chicken noodles and Chicken Thupka
(I always get confused with the term its Thupka or Thukpa üòÇ)
Anyway coming to the point :
Quantity is good...1plate is enough for two (though it was enough for three of us)
Quality is laazabab...Better than denzong (again mentioning 'according to me')

This is a newly opened restaurant in place of denzong kitchen and is as good as denzong. The managers over there are very friendly. We celebrated our friend's birthday over there and the manager (the cute girl) offered us a knife to cut the cake and they even played happy birthday song for us. That was really very sweet of them.
Now coming to food I'm just in love with that place, the food.
The only thing which I dislike is that the Chairs are not comfortable.

Decent place for a quick bite. There service is good and the place is clean. We ordered chicken in bbq sauce, chicken noodles and chicken thukpa.
Every dish tasted just right. The quantity of the noodles was right according to the price. The taste of the noodles were also good but I felt it was slightly under spiced. There were ample chunks of chicken in it.
The thukpa was just great. The quantity was more than enough and it would be difficult to finish for a single person unless really hungry. The  flavors were perfectly balanced and had large amount of minced chicken.
Finally the chicken in bbq sauce. It was simply rocking and probably the best dish among the three.
Overall a good place to hangout with your friends on a lazy afternoon.
P.S -they have slightly increased the prices and they no longer match with the menu on zomato

Refurbished look of this new subsidiary is soothing in aesthetics. However food quality remains the same as it's previous venture. A little less spicy and rich platter would be icing on the cake if attention is paid to it. Service is decent. Interiors scores the best,however little cushioning  on chairs always helps(hope they soon fix this)

A small eatery with good music. The amount of food is more then enough for two people. We ordered Garlic chicken and they gave us 10 pieces of chicken. Yes! You read that right. 8 large pieces with 2 relatively small ones. The food is lip-smacking and the prices in the menu-card includes taxes, so if you are with a tight budget, worry not! 
I'll go again for sure, to try their other items. üòÉ

It has a great ambience and very friendly staff. The restaurant is where Denzong Kitchen at Hazra was, and is a major redecoration and rebranding of Denzong. They retain the chef and menu (and have added few dishes to it), through this remodelling. An improvement on Denzong, definitely. The food is as good at it can be, and comes at a pocket friendly price.
