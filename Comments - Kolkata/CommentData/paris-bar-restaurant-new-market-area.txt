If you are looking forward to enjoying the North Indian delicacy along with a nightlife and that’s too in Kolkata, Paris Bar & Restaurant can be your option. This food joint, situated in the New Market Area is one of the favorite spots of the youngsters because of the availability of the bar. 

I have been there for so many times with my friends as well as colleagues and last night, I stepped into the same with a gang of childhood buddies to have some relishing hours together. However, I can’t give the place full marks because of their service and mannerisms of the staffs. The dishes that we ordered were nice and affordable too. We opted for Chilli Baby Corn and Chicken Manchurian and both of them were quite well in taste though not outstanding. In addition to that, we go for Vat69 to get the wholeness. 

The live background music presented by a group of band singers was not at all pleasing and it was loud also. Thus, we were not able to enjoy to the fullest that day. Moreover, what I can say is the experience was okay and not exemplary. Hope, they would try to make it better in the near future.

Situated in the New Market area, particularly in Hogg Street, the Paris Bar & Restaurant is quite a nice place for you to visit. The location of the bar is their main plus point for the people to like this place. The continuously played background music along with the performance of the live band is their another positive aspect. 

The group of our college friends decided to go for the Chilli Baby Corn, Chicken Manchurian and Vat69. In spite of being a cool place for you to hang out with your buddies, the staffs of the Bar were not at all helpful and courteous in their manner. The Chilli Baby Corn we tried was quite average in flavor. Thus, our expectation with the above mentioned dish did not came fruitful. Although the Chicken Manchurian seemed delicious with Vat69. There is no doubt that, this is quite a good place to pick as a spot for reunions or friends gathering, the service could have been better. 

Finally, I can say one thing that, you will not feel disappointed after stepping into the place due to the charming ambiance and the variety of dishes served in the outlet. If a few changes are done to the overall arrangements of the Bar, the place would become much more appealing.

Extremely pathetic place... ambience was below standards with loud music by live singers... also the floor was very dirty, rats are running here and there... The staffs are very rude... the place is good for having some cheap liquor in the area...
