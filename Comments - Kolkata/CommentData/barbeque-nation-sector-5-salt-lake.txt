BBQ nation is one of the best and famous place for buffet. Second visit in barbeque nation. Celebrated the new year with my special one...
It is located near the RDB cinemas and beside Chai-Break.
Surroundings are good, services are fast and it also had a live music.....
Now coming to the starters....the starters were unlimited....it had both veg and non veg...in veg(baby-corn, paneer tikka, mushroom) and in non-veg(chicken,prawn,fish,mutton)...both the veg and non-veg starters tasted good.....
They offered a complementary drink which can be beer/coke/lime-soda/aam-panna etc......we had a beer(tuborg) and a coke....
It also had a live pasta counter....the pasta was just awesome....
Now coming to the main course in non-veg it had mutton biryani, mutton roganjosh, fish, mutton, prawn, chicken and in veg it had vegetable dum Biryani, steamed rice, Dal makhni and many others and in non-veg salads (chicken and sea-food salads).
The main course tasted delicious....all the preparations tasted really good.
Now in the desserts section....it had hot gulab-jamun, cheese-cake(mango and strawberry), pastry, ice-cream, firni and many more. 
Now lastly was the kulfi.....which consists of many flavours...the kulfi was also good.....
All the preparations tasted good.........
Much visit again......

One word..... Awesome!!!
Food was great. Service was the best. The best thing was chefs were visiting almost all tables to see how the diners were doing. My favourite was the deserts and one item was there in main course.... "Malai Kofta" the day i visited. IT WAS PURE HEAVEN. I havnt had that taste anywhere till now. üòçüòò

Absolutely hated it.The service was disgusting.We asked for an extra fork.The waiter said to take it from the nearby table.Is this is a school canteen or what?
And please don't promote your buffet meal by saying unlimited starters if you are going to reach half an hour later at the table for the next round, sometimes not reach at all.
Advice to all people, stay clear of this restaurant.There are many better in town.

Barbeque Nation can be undoubtedly considered the pioneer of "all you can eat buffet" in Kolkata. It never seems to surprise patrons time and again with its mouth watering dishes. This particular review (late review) will detail my experience during the Bengali Food Festival which featured dishes that are not in their regular menu.

The good
i. Staff - One of the most polite, courteous and professional team in the restaurant business.
ii. Food - The live and assorted tandoori are perhaps the most alluring features of Barbeque Nation, and they never disappoint. Apart from their usual chicken, fish, prawn tandoori delicacies, we were served Pomfret Tandoori, which was truly awesome. In the main course they had Chingri malaikari which was heavenly. As usual, the list of items in the dessert was huge, Rasogolla and Mishti Doi were the special additions.

The bad - As always, there was not any bad experience whatsoever.

Overall - To me Barbeque Nation will always be the salvation point of my glutton, the gem of Kolkata and heaven for foodies.

I am purely basing this review on the member of staff at the entrance of your restaurant. People know that the food is amazing, but doesn't help when you get all cranked up by the unwelcoming gesture and responses your staffs at the reception desk. I have been places and there is a proactive approach and  encouraging its customers about the service. No one likes a person coming to a restaurant and is being shown an attitude that we don't want anymore people inside please . Hope there is some training available for these staffs or this would work out real detrimental in future.

Barbeque Nation is one of my favourite! I mean after all it's UNLIMITED FOOD!!! Their buffet has a wide range of variety and they give a complimentary drink.. The starters are lip-smacking, the main course is good and the dessert section is average. They need to improve their dessert section badly! The staffs are courteous and are very helpful.

Great experience. Awesome barbeques and they were in plenty. Very good services from well behaved staffs. Desserts were also worth paying accompanied with innovative concepts. Decor was very fine and comfortable. The place is easy to reach. But in my case didn't find the main course Afghan biriyani and others not up to the mark. Price is also fine.

The food is over here is very delicious and light on your stomach.The kebabs are to die for.The corn fritters served in BBQN are one my favourites. The ambience is very beautiful which ensures you have an excellent dining experience.The chefs come around to you to know about your experience and for any modifications as an endeavour to provide the best hospitality. A note of suggestion for BBQN is to change the cutlery they are currently using. Being a restaurant of such a mark you really cant afford serving customers in cracked cutlery . Overall BBQN is highly recommended by me !!!

Sector V Barbeque Nation was our go to place after end of every semester exams.
I am writing this review of my 4th or 5th Visit.

Though not very evolutionary, the menu seems ever appealing.

You are seated on a table and live grill is brought in a jiffy. The flag is raised which indicates that your episode of staters has begun.
The staff will explain every dish  that appears on the table. 
Starters include Mediterranean Prawn (Juicy & Delicious), Chicken Barbeque (Great), Chicken Wings (So-So), Mutton Kebab (Great), Cilantro flavoured Fish Barbeque (Amazing). Though we always opted for Non-Veg Buffet but the Staff always provided us with Baby Potatoes in Spiced Cajun Sauce and Paneer Tikka, which were my favourite from Veg platter.
Lowering the flag indicates you're done with your starters and the grill gets removed.

The Salad Section was well decorated too. Tasted the Tomato Basil Soup which tasted okay.

In the main course I opted for Indian breads (Naan) and Dal Makhani (Tasty), Veg Noodles (Good), Fried Rice & Chicken Curry (Bland & Less Spicy), Chilly Fish (Good). Menu is very compact in the main course section but then Barbeque Nation is a place for consuming starters.

The dessert section is comprehensive but astonishing. Tasted Chocolate Cake (Good), Strawberry Cheesecake (Good), Moong Dal Halwa (Delicious), Custard (Good), Hot Mini Gulab Jamuna (Out of this World). I considered the Gulab Jamuns to be the hero of the Dessert Section until I proceeded towards the Kulfi Junction. The Paan Kulfi & the Chocolate Kulfi were the best I've ever tasted. The Mango Kulfi & Malai Kulfi were amazing too.

The staff are super cordial and they amplify the dinning experience to even better. 

Barbeque Nation is heaven for foodies and they will surely diminish hunger pangs of anyone hungry provided you can endure the long queues if you go there unplanned.

This is the older of the two outlets in Kolkata.
Waiters are very polite and attentive to your needs.
The starters and the desserts are the main attractions. However, recently the quality and taste of the starters have started to deteriorate. Main course has a variety of dishes but none of them are above average. The live kulfi counter is a delight. Overall, it still remains the best buffet option in city.

This is one buffet spread that you simply cannot ger enough of! The kebabs are to die for, and of course, it's all-you-can-eat. I especially love the grilled prawns and fish kebab. The main course has a good amount of variety, including biriyani, and noodles, and makes for a decent eat. The desserts, however, are cracker.
Ambience is plush, with live music on ocassion, and the decor is simplistic and cozy. Food is definitely value for money.

After years they have started changing the menu. The starters have more variety now. There's a new mushroom barbeque that tasted awesome. Another fry which was crispy outside but had curd(dahi) inside, tasted fantastic too. Peri-Peri Barbeque Chicken is another new addition that tasted great.

The non-veg main course was pretty much the same. However the veg portion had several new dishes. Tasted Corn and Chicken Lasagna, probably new here, the Italian dish I have been craving to relish on.

No doubt the desserts are always the best part. Saw new addition of Halwa here. The gulab jamun and kulfis are all-time favourite.

Could have given 5 star but what I don't like about this Kolkata outlet is that it's really overcrowded even on the weekdays and office hours. Often the waiters miss/forget to bring the dish on time or skip the dish (not their fault, we can see them rushing all around trying to please everyone).

No pictures this time.

Visited today on Christmas. Their service was amazing and they were very friendly and though there was a huge rush they managed for us as soon as they could. Their European menu is amazing . The starters and maincourse were delicious. Too bad we couldn't try the duck because we were already full. We tried their live counter for turkey. It was good. They gave us a small gift as it was Christmas. I guess this branch is far better with quality service and food than Park Street. Will visit soon again !! :)

There is a reason why Barbeque Nation is hailed as the best buffet in Kolkata..I decided to go to Barbeque Nation Salt Lake this Christmas with my friends because the number of times I have came to this place, I have only wanted to rediscover this place again and again for the variety of food it offers..Its offering European dishes till the new year time and I being a foodie can never miss this golden opportunity..Right from the starters Portugese Peri Peri Wings,Barbeque Rosemary Chicken,Mutton Pudina Seekh Kabab,Dilli Lemon Fish, Spanish Romesco Prawns and Shinakthi Chicken Tikka, I cant say there is one single item I dint like..Just loved them like anything..Then in main courses I tried Murshidabadi Biriyani, Handi Gosht, Butter Chicken,Grilled Fish,Chicken Tikka Lasagne, all the items were sumptuous and you just cant have enough of it at one go... Then ultimately the desserts, Apple Pie, Moong Dal Halwa,Gulab Jamun,Cheese Brownie, Ice cream, Chocogranate Swiss Rolls, Phirnee and then to end with Kulfi specially the Pan flavoured Kulfi, it was just like a dream.. I dont think I can get so many items at a better price than what BBQ Nation is offering..Its a terrific place and the ambience is too good..Just loved the food in my friends company...I would visit again and again...Its a foodie's paradise...Its a five star for me any day... Highly recommended.. :)

This place serves one of th4 best kebabs possible.One amazing restaurant in the city.The decor is pretty good bit the important aspect of he place is their food.The fish tikka was one of the tastiear fish tikkas i ever ate so was the malai kebab it literally melted inside once you take it in.The biryani eas pretty good too.The thing which i most liked about this place was their dedication towards customer satisfaction ,i visited this place with family and my mothet somehow didnt like the mutton prep,so we let the manager know of it..he literally asked my mother about her preferences and asked the chef to make a fresh dish based on those preferences which was pretty amazing very few restaurants show that amount of dedication towards the customers.I had an amazing expirience with the food the service and everything about the restaurant ,highly recommended.

It's an absolute foodies delight! If you want to gorge on some delicious prawns then this is your ultimate stop. One of the primary reason for the popularity is the pocket friendly buffet price. And the corn fritters are to die for. Go check it out if you love your prawns!

This place is the only place from where I never returned sad for a single time till date... The ambience,  the service and last but not the least the food all are just outstanding evertime... 
This time we were there to try the "Euro Trip Festival" running from 21.12.17 to 01.01.18... And again it was a cherish experience... Along with the regular BBQN specalities, the western starters and main course they are serving are just too good... 
From the starters must have lPortueguese peri peri chicken wings", "Barbeque rosemary chicken", "Spanish Romesco prawn", "Dill lemon fish", "Italian jalapeno chesse stuffed mushrooms" & "Honey crispy chilli pineapple"...
And it the main course do have "Chicken tikka lasagne", "Grilled polenta with cherry tomato and mushroom ragout", "Spinach and corn augratin" & "Parmigiana melanzana"... All are just yummy... 
You all are aware of their kulfi station I'm sure... 
But they came up this week with three more stations... Hotdog, Pasta and Pancake station... So don't forget to try them out... 
In the desserts I love the "Cheese brownie" and "Chocolate swissroll"... Although your favourites like mini gulab jamun, phirni and ice cream are also there... So don't be worry... Just go and eat all you eat this winter...

This review is for Barbeque Nation Sector V branch -

1. First and foremost, if you are planning to visit please book a table beforehand. This place is usually crowded and waiting time can be very long.

2. Plate is usually buffet but A-la-carte available too. In buffet - starter and desert is preferred.

3. Full bar available and rate is medium. E.g. for IMFL ‚Çπ150 - ‚Çπ175 per 30ml. Foreign liquors cost more. They offer a complimentary drink only in lunch and can be chosen among beer, long island iced tea, lime soda, soft drinks etc.

4. For Wed - Sun dinner, they have a Early Bird offer. For which the dinner costs around ‚Çπ100 less per head. Only clause you have to reach there before 7.30pm. If you are in a group the number of people present before 7.30pm will be entitled for the offer and for rest the cost will be usual.

5. Recommendations for starter: Fish, Prawns, Mutton, Chicken wings, Pineapple, Corn.
Recommendations for desert: Hot gulab jamun, Malai kulfi live counter.

This place is worth my money! The efficiency at which they provide services and the way the management is, it is capable enough to pay you back the sum you're paying. Good music and ambience of the place, well-dressed and well behaved staffs, who dutifully attend to their customers. The place is kid friendly and classy and maintains a proper decorum. Coming to food, a variety of starters, main course items and desserts are available. The food does taste good.
The variety of soups and beverage, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic is expected to increase and also they need to work on soup's taste. The other fa ctors are capable enough to cover up for the gap of variety and taste. The staff Mr. Purnendu Jana had been very helpful to us and we applaud his service. Kudos to you people!

Visited this place during the the Euro Trip Festival happening from 21st December to 1st January. The new European menu is just too good to be true. One just cannot afford to miss it. Barbeque nation is undoubtedly the best buffet place all over the nation and with its addition of live pasta, hot dogs & pancake counters it adds brownie points to their ratings. They've launched some European starters too along with the classic Indian starters like -
‚Ä¢ Portuguese Peri Peri Wings 
‚Ä¢ Barbeque Rosemary Chicken 
‚Ä¢ Spanish Romesco Prawn 
‚Ä¢ Dill Lemon Fish 
Each of the starters are simply scrumptious and you just can't miss the opportunity to have them to your hearts content. They've also many added European main course like -
‚Ä¢ Chicken Tikka Lasagne
‚Ä¢ Grilled Polenta with Cherry Tomato and Mushroom Ragout 
‚Ä¢ Spinach And corn Augratin 
‚Ä¢ Parmigiana Melanzana 
Along with these the usual Indian main course is also served. 
Coming to the best course of the buffet, the desserts are ravishing and one plate is just not enough to have. There's Apple Pie, Swiss Roll and Pineapple Gateau added to their special menu alongside Phirnee, Brownie and Gulab Jamun. That's not it, the kulfi counter definitely is the cherry on top. The pan and mango kulfi are a must try. Had a wonderful feast with a great bunch of friends. Drop at Barbeque Nation this week itself to enjoy this grand spread of the European dishes. Don't miss this.

No doubt that it is the best buffet in Kolkata. It is the Paradise for food lovers. I can say the food quality is more than best... The starters are big WOW.. The prawn, chicken pieces are very soft. I didn't have any veg item, but heard from my colleagues that veg items were wonderful too. Don't forget to have Biriyani from the Main course, it's damn good. Keep little space in your stomach for the desserts too. You won't get such dessert in any other restaurants. The coolfi is awesome. Love to visit it again and again. And one more thing, try out the Early Bird offer (which is available within 12-12:30 pm), it's the same food with less price.

My my my!!! I have tried buffet at a number of places but when I tasted this one I forgot the others!!! From the kebabs served at the grill to the ones they serve on the plate, every single dish is very tasty. I would suggest that when it comes to the mains they can do better and the same goes for the desert. But my favourite there apart from the kebabs were the different flavour kulfis, don't know they were for a stipulated time or not but this is something you should try to end your food fiesta!!!!!

An awesome place for the food lovers and food eaters. Went for the second time. Without telling much about the environment as many people knows this place pretty well, directly jumping to my food review.
Went there with my office colleagues for a team dinner. It was an early bird offer so we got some discount also. Thanks to the staff. :-D
As the buffet menu changes everyday, so it may be different for different days.
Starting with the Crispy Baby Corns which is the most delicious starter that i love the most of this restaurant. Then it moved to Veg Kebab, Chicken kebab, Chicken wings , Paneer tikka, Fish kebab, Tandoor Prawns, mushrooms, something made of potatoes which I dont remember but it was really yummy.¬†

Coming to main course, there was Manchow Soup, Egg Fried rice, Chili Chicken, Fish Curry, Mutton Roganjosh, Dal Tadka, Chilli Baigan, Schezwan Noodles, Chicken biriyani, papd, different types of salad, etc.

The Desert Section was as usual mind blowing. There was Gulab Jamun , vanilla icecream, cheese cake, mango cake , pineapple tart, chocolate cake, phirni and Kheer. It was all yummy.
Last but not least there was different flavours of Kulfi. from which I ate the Chocolate and Kesar pista flavours.¬†

Overall it was a great experience with courteous staff.¬† thanks to Barbeque Nation for a great dinner.
Only thing that I want to mention is that if there was a complimentary drink in dinner also then it would be a cherry on the cake.

Booking a Table--Firstly you need to make a reservation in any of the buffets of the day as there are several rounds of buffets in a day,for this you can use either bbq app or their website.After you make the reservation they will call you just for the confirmation of reservation before a couple of days of your reservation date and also on the date you have made the reservation.If you are lucky enough and checked in "in happy hours",you will get some discount also..
Ambience--place is quite organised,clean and staff are quite well behaving.
Taste and quantity--Almost everything tastes delicious but starters are THE BEST.They will keep serving you the starters until you lower the flag on your table and they taste delicious.Maincourse and desserts,you have to serve yourself.one drink is complementary either beer,cocktail or some soft drink..it's totally worth the money and definitely deserves a visit..what makes this place even better is politeness of staff,you will get a royal treatment for sure..üòä

Awesome experience with barbecue nation....
Extraordinary service, behaviour of the staffs have made my anniversary special. They even made a cake for us and wished. I didn't love the taste of prawns in starter. But they immediately made 4 different types of prawns with completely different seasoning. All those prawns were excellent in taste. 
I prefer to going back to barbeque nation for their great starters and desserts. But this time barbeque nation provides another reason to visit them... Commendable customer service...

Yesterday, on 15th Dec,2017,  I along with my husband went to BBQ nation for our 1st marriage anniversary celebration. Though it was a post celebration, we wanted to spend it in BBQ nation as it was a good recommendation by most of our friends. We went there at approx 7pm and got table as it was prior reserved. The dinner started with the sumptous starters, of which there were the fish, prawn and chicken kebabs. The waiters were highly attentive in serving and changing the sheeks as soon as we completed the kebabs. Those were really the star of our dinner , specially the fish kebabs !! The ambience was a bit too crowdy as it was a Friday night and that too in Sector 5, Salt lake . Next was the pasta in the live counter and it was fantabulously amazing in taste. I ordered to make the pasta in white sauce with only bell peppers and carrot and pepper and without mushroom. It made my taste buds a remarkable sensation with a yummilicious taste. After that we were both so full that we tasted the main course in very little quantity. There were chicken hakka noodles , various types of salad platter, many items of fish, chicken and mutton along with biriyani, steamed rice. We couldnt stop counting the number of main course dishes as were so full in it. Next we came to the most amazing section of this joint which is the desert section where there were pinepapple puffy pastry, fresh orange tart, double layered cheese cake, phirni and rice kheer. Not to forget about the ice cream parlour and the kulfi centre which was of beyond mention !!! Above all, the experience was simply amazing and of special notation was the waiters !! They are so highly attentive and of so good and humble behaviour that we will keep them remembered long !!

I think most of Kolkata's populace has covered this place, not once but several times...I mean, who else does buffets like Barbeque Nation eh? ;) Personally, I'm not a big eater, but I'm tempted to stuff myself whenever I visit this place. This was my second visit; went with my folks on a weekday afternoon and availed the early bird offer.

The starters just kept coming and coming and cominngggg... I remember prawns, fish, chicken, mushrooms, off the grill... There were the Cajun potatoes, the fried Corn, oh yummm, Mutton chapli kebab...
For the welcome drink, we chose Aam Panna..
Mains were alright; we didn't really plan to have a lot of those, so we chose to have Chicken Handi Biryani, Chicken Saagwala and Mutton Dakbungalow.. They were good, could be better. I'd like to mention that a server (I forgot his name) brought out a plate of the Biryani directly from the kitchen; piping hot, with succulent chicken pieces and nice masalas.. I'm not a fan of the Kolkata biryani or versions, but this one was very good. And thankful to him for giving us a taste of the same.
The Dessert section as usual was enough to blow my mind away...Maaan!¬†

I think it's safe to say that I overate :P BURP!¬†

Thanks barbeque nation for a great lunch...I would hope to experience better main course items next time, but overall I remain quite satisfied with the experience. Especially the unlimited starters and the desserts!

Need I say something different from what others have to say..It's a paradise simply a paradise.
Just a few relevant tips:-- 
Keep plenty of spaces in your stomach and utilise that space only for starters and deserts.
Trust me you are gonna love most of the items they have to offer.
You can get the main course they offer someplace else but that won't be the situation in case of starters and deserts.

Barbeque Nation is one of the best and famous place for buffet.
People who can eat alot this is your place.
There are two buffets available one is the lunch and the dinner.
For the lunch and dinner you can get early bird discounts if you reach there on time like for lunch 12 or 5 mins before that.
It is located near the RDB and beside Chai Break.
The ambience is good and services are fast.
If you just have the starters you might be full.
The starters are unlimited and you can just feed yourself only that,but yes you should taste all the food items.The offer you complementary drink that can be beer or soda anything.
The main course is good contains biriyani and all depends cause the menu changes.
And the best part of any meal is the dessert.
You get gulab jamuns,fruits,ice cream,and many more.
Last but not the least is the kulfi.
You can have the pan kulfi combination of pan and kulfi and many other flavours.
It is a must visit place and your tummy and your pocket will be satisfied and happy.

We went their for my mom's birthday. The staffs were really friendly they offered a birthday cake and also sung the birthday song. They made that evening really special for her.

Coming to the food it was great. 
It is Paradise for foodie's. Their was flag down kind of system. We were just not able to put it down when we started with barbeque. Their was almost everything chicken,prawn,mutton,fish,potatoes,paneer, corn, mushroom. 
Now for the main course their was one veg and another non-veg soup, veg-fried rice, noodles. They also offer you the choice of bread. The garlic butter nan is a must try option.
Though the dessert section was not so much interesting. Only phirni was up to the mark.
But,the hot anguri gulab jamun with vanilla ice-cream is a wonderful combination.
Their was live kulfi counter. Among all the six the chocolate one was the best.
I personally recommended all those people who love to eat must visit this place at least once.

Well, we had gone for a la cart√© but surprisingly, the place has started to offer only buffet for dinner. Have to admit, from the starters till the desserts, all the dishes were fantastic. My personal favourites from the buffet include:
1. Jamun cheesecake.
2. Paan kulfi.
3. Darsaan with vanilla ice-cream.
4. Yellow dal.
5. Grilled mushrooms, potatoes and pineapple.

This time team lunch. You need to make strategy before visiting BN otherwise we may miss some of the receipe. Important parts of BN are all the starters and all the desert so never take risk to take main course which can make you full and you miss the desert xD Pan flavor kulfi is really interesting. From golap jamun to sahi tukra you can' t miss anyting if you are desert lover.

This was my second visit to bbq nation. However was a bit disappointed. The preparation of fish served in the starter was not good at all. However the prawn and corn and the chicken lollipop were something we all relished like anything.I tried chicken biryani and mutton korma and both were delicious. Coming to the dessert the gulab jamuns and tiramisu were worth a try. Here I would like to mention that the chocolate balls didn't taste well. Then there was kulfi. I liked the pan flavoured one. Apart from the food the ambience was great as usual and so was the cordiality of the staffs.

I went to Barbeque Nation to celebrate my birthday today. First of all, the food was amazing. I liked the mutton seekh kebab and fish kebab the most. In the main course, I liked white sauce pasta and Briyani. Fried rice was okay. I loved the kulfis. I guess the best thing about this place is the staff service. They were courteous and friendly. This was my first visit to Barbeque Nation so they guided us very well. They were nice enough to provide us a birthday cake. They even sang the birthday song for me. Only one drawback that I didnot get Rs. 150 off by booking through the app for the first time and my sister did 2 days ago. Loved the overall experience. üòòüòòüòòüòòüòò Thankyou Barbeque Nation. Looking forward to great deals in future.

Coming to the food the, starters and deserts were too delicious and offered lots of variety.. There's is nothing to complain about... But the main course items were a huge huge disaster...  The taste was filthy.. Biriyani had no chicken/mutton ... Fish had bones. Mutton was smelly. Personally I didn't like their main course items.

One of the best buffets in the city of joy.
Delicious starters.
The kebabs are too good
Chicken drumsticks finger licking
I didn't have any of the other starters .
Coming to the main course it surely has the best Biryani among buffets in Kolkata.
Even after so many kebabs you can easily have Biryani unlike other buffets.
Do try their gulab jamun.. soft hot balls of love.
Nd the mousse is also super.
If you are a heavy eater do go to bbq nation.
Service n ambience is great too.

I tried tasting almost every thing in a little amount but honestly my tummy admitted defeat to the looooooonnngggg list of dishes prepared in buffet.

Staffs are courteous and often ask if anything is required.They greet specially if it's your birthday or anniversary

Will definitely visit few more times

Thanks BBQ nation for keeping your tummy and taste buds happy like anything

This is the 6th time I have been to this place. They provide great buffet at reasonable price. The staffs were quite attentive to our needs. In addition to the regular starters,  they did serve us barbecued pineapple and malai chicken kebab just because we asked for it. That's a nice gesture. But I suggest they should introduce more variety in starters section in terms of taste. 
The main course was average.  But what I loved the most was their dessert. Mexican pastry, Pineapple Cheesecake,  mixed fruit pudding,  mango firni.. Yummy... 
Do not miss their kulfis even if you are stuffed with food by the time you reach the kulfis counter. 
P. S Could take just one pic as I was too busy eating.

For vegeterian, non-vegeterian, fish eaters, it is the place to hit upon over the weekends.

I have visited this restaurant 4 times...i really liked this restaurant but recently i have seen few things....bbq nation has increased their charges even after the government has finalised 5% gst for all restaurants except those that are in 5 star hotels where there it is still 18%. What barbeque nation has done is that..they have increased their initial prices( excluding gst)..and are charging gst over it...its a really clever move...
We should complain against this particular restaurant on consumer forum...loved u bbq nation

Even they are not replying to those who are protesting  against their increase on charges in the review section ..bbq nation is replying to all those ppl who are giving them 5 star and 4 star ratings but not to the ppl who are raising qstns on this problem....

Ambience wise it's a amazing place but t when it comes to food it's nothing like what I expecting to be...this great buffet of the town is loosing it's quality! Except the fish kebab none of the kebabs were up to the mark...main course were also not that tempting and test wise so average.. Desserts were basic...
Only one thing I loved about this place is there services...stuffs are supper Cooperative and well behaved...

With decreasing GST rate they have increased food price. This is really disgusting. Stop such shamelessness. When GST rate was 18%, the buffet perice per head for lunch(non veg)was 831.00 rupees including tax. After GST rate came down to 5% and price for the same is 779.00 excluding tax. I am going to lodge a complaint against this restaurant to consumer forum.

Today it was my first visit to this outlet.The ambience is very good with a balanced combination of dark n light.The service is always good when it is Barbeque Nation.The best buffet in the city of joy.The starters consisted of many items of chicken, fish, prawn, mushroom,paneer.Main course too had many recipes.Its really very tough for a foodie too to taste every dish as it has so many variations.The desserts is always very heart winning.The angoori gulam jamun with ice cream is just a deadly combination one could ever have!
At last but not the least but rather the best is thr pan masala kulfi.It just wow.
Barbeque nation will always win my heart when it is buffet!

According to me best buffet restaurant in kolkata...if you are a food lover like me then this place for appropriate for you.
Complementary drinks options -  Aam pana, lime soda, Beer, Coke( you can choose only one).
We ordered lime soda and beer those were pretty decent.

Starter-  BBQ chicken, mutton, prawn, fish, mashroom, corn.
I preferred the chicken, prawn and corn was amazing. I recommend you the corn. But i don't like the mutton sikh kebab.

Main course-   Biriyani, fried rice, veg polau, chicken and mutton gravy, fish gravy, chowmin, chilly chicken, veg Manchurian, papad, salads.
Main courses are not up to the mark. There should be lots of improvement. I only liked the fried rice. Biriyani was disgusting.

Desert- Now come to the real heaven. Everything was amazing. Like pastry, firni, ice cream, brownie, sweets , hot gulab jamun, cheese cake..but their main attraction is khulfi. There was many flavors like pan, mango,keasr, chocolate, strawberry.
I liked the mango and the kesar one.
Beside from the main course. Everything was amazing. Staff's behavior was good and friendly. Wanna go there again and again

May be the best buffet in Kolkata.
All the Starter's are great. But please BBQ improve your main course food. 
The rice was not that good.
I must say, staff's are very good, they replace my rice, and what they present me as rice was great.
Desert was very good.

Deco was very good.
Must say, complementary cake was great.

Its my 5th visit to this awesome place.. Imo its one of the best place where you can enjoy amazing barbeque and desert at a reasonable price.. We were 10 of us celebrating a fren's bday..¬† Made prior booking because its difficult to get a place here specially during the weekends..¬† ¬†The staffs were amazing and joined in to celebrate our fren's bday with a delicious cake on the house... Also not to forget the Tequila shots which was organized by the staff and 4 of us did take one shot each... Loved the hospitality ..¬†
The starter was yummylicious and the cakes were simply outstanding. I didn't touch the main course seen these two segment was enough to feel my tummy... For like 4 hours (12-4pm)¬† we had an awesome time...¬† Its a must visit place for those who haven't tried it...¬† ¬† ¬†Was so busy eating i only took two pictures ...

Barbeque Nation is known for offering the "Best Buffet in Town".

First, u will get to chose from a wide spread of welcome drinks. Their starters offer very delicious items starting from Crispy Corn with onions, Chicken Wings, Chicken Kebab, Fish Kebab, BBQ Prawn, Mutton Sheekh Kebab among others. You will enjoy their prompt and clean service very much.

The BBQ grill on the table is always a must have to keep ur kebabs warm and juicy and they provide u with that too. So u can enjoy ur food with li'l chit chat without worrying about the food getting cold.

They have a good spread in their main course that usually remains the same. But the quality of main course is not as good as their starters.

They have a good dessert spread as well. Their Gulab Jamun is a must have, along with their Mango Phirni. U should definitely try their Koolfi spread too. The "Paan Koolfi" goes well after a tasty, sumptuous
buffet.

Do visit once !

In Kolkata there are 2 outlets of Barbeque Nation among those 2 Salt Lake is the old one and the better one. Visited both the outlets number of times in past but today's visit at Salt Lake outlet was the best one in all forms. The quality and the taste of food was the best among all the visits I had in the past.

As usual they had the best starters but today I liked the mutton and fish in the starter. We have asked for a special spicy dish of mutton which they made for us and it was certainly delicious. The main course this time was good as compared to out earlier visit but still it could be improved. All the pastries in dessert was nice. The angori gulab jamun with vanilla ice-cream always tastes the best. Among all the desserts firni was the best to taste. Kesar Pista kulfi was also delicious.

The ambience is good and this time we experienced the best hospitality among all our previous visits including both the outlets.

Went to this place after puja with family. But at that time the prices and the food was very much satisfactory. 
But i went their yesterday again and found that the food was satisfactory yet again but the prices have been hiked for no reason. 
Even after the government slashed the tax rates Bbq raised their prices. I guess this was not a smart move from them. This is the only reason for my low rating. I believe the govt slashed prices for customers benefit bt hikes of prices will give the same burden on the customer. Dissapointed

Celebrated my mom's birthday here, few days ago. Firstly I want to thank the staff for their warm gesture and helping us celebrate with a cake they offered :)
Coming to the food, the starters comprise of barbeque which are absolutely lip smacking. They have chicken, fish, prawn, paneer, mushroom and vegetable barbeque, mutton sheekh kebab, chicken wings, and corn fried in cheese and you can have as much as you want of them. The main course had 1 veg and 1 non veg soup, chicken biriyani, mutton dakbanglow, 1 chicken and 1 fish preparation, chowmein, chilly chicken and many veg preparations too. The dessert section had two-in-one cheese cake, chocolate brownie, butterscotch pastry, bread pudding, fruit pudding, firni, angoori gulaab jamoon and ice cream with chocolate sauce. Last but not the least they have the live kulfi counter offering 6 flavors of kulfi to die for. The staff is extremely helpful and welcoming. Our bill was 3.5k for four people. The place is highly recommended.

Ps- Try the hot angoori gulaab jamoons with ice cream. It's heavenly üòå

In short and simple, BBQ Nation has always been my favourite when it comes to a lavish and filling buffet. I have been here quite a number of times be it office team lunch or best friend‚Äôs birthday celebration! üíñ BBQ nation has always been our favourite! 
Their starters are the best and so delicious that we hardly try the main course most often. In the starters my personal favourites are the prawns and fish tikka. They are sinfully yumm and definitely worth it. 
Coming to desserts, my favourite has to be the flavoured kulfis and gulab jamuns which act like a cherry on the top! So yumm and cute at the same go! üòç‚ò∫Ô∏è

One of the best restaurants I have been to. This is an absolute gem for a food lover, a wonderful mix of Quality and Quantity. The buffet was just awesome, to say the least.
 Coming to the food part,The barbeque starters section were the best. We were served kebabs of chicken ,mutton , fish , paneer, pineapple and prawn.
It was served along with baby corn and fresh lime soda. They were too delicious and we had them, till our hearts' content.
The main course section was quite good, but its not for something you come here. The biriyanis , mutton and chicken dishes stared at us, as we just went past them , by just tasting them.
Next comes the dessert section, another attraction of this famous restaurant. The sweets , gulab jamun, pastry's and cakes were deliciously prepared. They also had a pan and icecream parlour, which were also awesome.
Lastly, we were pleased by thier behaviour and profesional attitude. My father didn't like the taste of mutton and prawn kebabs , which they immediately changed. Thier service and table-booking was smoothly done.
We had a very pleasant experience, in this very place.

No complaints! From food till hospitality, they define restaurant service the best! I took my parents there and they loved it. So I loved it. I booked a table from beforehand which was kept ready for us. We had some issue with the table so they happily provided us another seat. The wine was good. So was the food. I particularly love their kulfi parlor which is simply amazing! And I loved their hospitality as they kept ensuring that we liked the food.

We gathered at BBQ for a grand non-veg buffet - in starter chicken n fish was good but mushroom quality was not good as we expected , n main course was also not better in quality . Dessert was really good n the ambience also .

Total bill increased for SGST & CGST but it's ok.

All over it was good, expecting more quality over main course .ÔøΩ

Barbeque always has been the Mecca of Barbeque lovers so couple of weeks ago we heed a visit this newly opened branch of Kolkata. 
Booking seat through BN app is super smooth and we didn't have to wait at the queue and also got some discount for being the first time customer booking through app. 

Coming to the food, skewers were awesome. They served chicken wings, bhetki fish, mutton seekh kebab, shrimp, tengri kebab and fried sweet corn. All of them were good but corn, shrimp and chicken wings deserve a special mention but I found quality of mutton seekh kebab degraded with consecutive servings. Serving staffs were very prompt and courteous. They ask for what to repeat for next round even before we were finish the previous servings and constantly asked for feedback about taste. 

Coming to main course we didn't try most of the main courses but the chicken biriyani was good in taste but the mutton main course was a bit salty. 

It's time for desserts, üç∞ and everyone know the famous story about Barbeque's kulfi! So we tried all of them, for two times üòÖ and among all those delicious kulfis, malai, mango and paan flavour were the best. Other than that we offered our sweet tooth hot gulab jamuns, pineapple pastry, chocolate pastry, firni amd freshly cut fruits. Firni was ambrosial with the right amount of sweetness. I wish they served firni on a earthen pot. Looking forward to visit you again, Barbeque Nation!

Being a foodie, had to visit this place by its Zomato rating and hence did but it couldn't meet the level of expectation!
The buffet items are completely okay type.. it truly needs to improve the main course items and also should look into the taste of the items! 
The noodles we had in the mainstream was completely boiled and almost non spicy!
Starters and deserts were fine..
I don't think we should spend ~1K/buffet for this restaurant!

They have early bird offer. To avail this you must prepare to be in queue for long or book table in advance and come early. 
Now come to food, they serves best kind of starters. And the service is very good. We had number of food loving people but they handle quite well. But the main course is not that good. We had so much starters every time we hardly able to try main course. But the deserts are again very good.
I would love to visit again and again.

The most high rated restaurant of zomato. My first visit to this restaurant on last sunday. We were 3 friends out for dinner there. Luckily we have got the seat without waiting. What can I say ambience was very good and staffs too. Here I come about the food.
The very famous barbeque nation serves delicious buffet. I really like the starters(7types veg+nonveg) they did not provide any complimentary drink for dinner. The main course was average and not happening. The deserts items are very good except ice creams but the live kulfi parlour was bliss.
I think they should improve their main course section.

One of the best buffet in town. One can avail the early bird offer if he/she pre-books the table over phone and reaches the place early..
Reserve a table over phone to get a hastle free experience..or after some time..long queues are formed.
The starters are tremendously delicious especially the non-veg items..
U get to select a complementary drink too.
The starters include fish, chicken, mutton, prawn.
One must try the fried baby corn's from the vegetarian starters.
The main course was average.
The desserts were outstanding. The kulfi.. which gives u 6 choices..and all of them are too good..
Great Ambience. Staff is excellent.

Yesterday I went to this place. The starters r tremendously delicious specially the nonveg items. We mainly filled our tummy with the starters. The mutton sheekh kebab wasn't up to the mark, we complained about it and therefore they prepared a dish of mutton specially according to our choice and gave it to us and it was the best of all. It was actually some mutton kebabs tossed in a spicy yet a dry gravy . we took a complimentary drink, that is, fresh lime soda, main course was average. Desserts were great. Barbeque nation is the best place for foodies. If you are thinking to celebrate your birthday or anniversary somewhere, then barbeque nation is the best option. The staff themselves will surprise you with a complimentary birthday cake ! The way they sing the birthday song...... Will definitely make you feel special. The d√©cor, ambience is outstanding. It feels like you are the chief guest out there. Overall it was a very nice experience... But I feel there is a huge scope of improvement for them in the main course and in some desserts like phirni,narkel naru, mawa gujiya. Last but not the least, the pan kulfi is a bliss!

This was my first visit to this place, I was lucky that I didn‚Äôt had to wait for a cue, the look and feel of the place was good, however when you go for buffet lunch the place hardly matters, regarding food, they served kebabs of all varieties, I preferred chicken and prawn, to my surprise they didn‚Äôt stop serving kebabs at all on the contrary when I asked for two sticks of kebab they have served me four, once I was done with kebab and the fresh lime soda served by them I moved on to the main course, frankly speaking I was done with the kebab however took some biriyani and mutton curry and the taste was awesome, and then came the desserts, they had it all, from sweets to cakes and pastries even they had varieties of kulfi, and staffs were literally treating me as king and they were pouring food items in my plate as if I not a customer I am a king, first time in life an awesome experience, I have only one suggestion for them, please arrange for some guys who could lift us after we are done to drop us till our cars.

Marvelous Experience!!

One of the few places in Calcutta that deserves a full 5 on 5. Simply superb food.

Ambience : Nicely decorated. Cozy. Spacious. Good for casual dining , party , team lunch and dinner.

Food : Simply awesome. Wide array of kebabs in starters. If you still have space for the main course go  and savour the regional varities of food. To end with desert delicacies and awesome kulfi.

Location : RDB Bouleverd , Sec 5.

Service : Staff well mannered. Takes feedback after every course.

Price : 1700 for two ( Buffet with complimentary drink )

A must visit for all.

Probably the best place for unlimited buffet dining...Good ambiance good food quality,especially starter & desert..worth spending money..
Prawn was excellent, Pan kulfi was too good. Only one small advice to them, they should improve the quality of the Biryani they r providing us. Overall best place for foodies.

Yesterday I went to this place. The starters r tremendously delicious specially the nonveg items. We mainly filled our tummy with the starters. The mutton sheekh kebab wasn't up to the mark, we complained about it and therefore they prepared a dish of mutton specially according to our choice and gave it to us and it was the best of all. It was actually some mutton kebabs tossed in a spicy yet a dry gravy . we took a complimentary drink, that is, fresh lime soda, main course was average. Desserts were great. Barbeque nation is the best place for foodies. If you are thinking to celebrate your birthday or anniversary somewhere, then barbeque nation is the best option. The staff themselves will surprise you with a complimentary birthday cake ! The way they sing the birthday song...... Will definitely make you feel special. The d√©cor, ambience is outstanding. It feels like you are the chief guest out there. Overall it was a very nice experience... But I feel there is a huge scope of improvement for them in the main course and in some desserts like phirni,narkel naru, mawa gujiya. Last but not the least, the pan kulfi is a bliss!

Location : I had their buffets in both the saltklake and parkstreet outlets. Although the saltklake outlet is nearby, I would gladly prefer parkstreet one anyday!

Ambience : Friendly! We generally go for corporate buffets, ample seat for 60 people at once.

Food : The starters are everything. If you think u will have enough space after 'tasting' the variety of tasty lipsmacking starters of chicken mutton prawn, think again!
The main course is just average and can be improved a lot!
Dessert of their buffets are unmatchable!

Pocket Pinch : Every bite is worth your time and penny!

This was my first ever trip to a BBQ Nation. The place was small and suffocating. If you compare the design of this particular outlet with the one in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, you will know the difference. As the air circulation in this outlet was extremely poor, the smoke coming out of the grills was causing nausea. In spite of all these faults, I must say that food was really great. The staffs were cooperative, and the items in the buffet were delicious. That's why I will visit this place again.

Barbeque Nation Saltlake.

Durdanto experience. 5kinds of refreshing tasty welcome drinks including tuborg beer. NonVeg starters like Chicken prown mutton -- 3kinds of barbeque grill items of which the mutton item was the best. Nextly we tried chicken biryani n mtton rogan josh with raita; heavenly combination; my wife took six big spoonful of c.biryani n 5big pieces of mutton ;I enjoyed two full plate of c.biryani n almost 13-14 pieces of mttn. Nextly took hot jamuns n 3kinds of kulfis followed by papayas n melon slices. My 11mnth old daughter ate a bowlful of firnee. My wife tasted all sorts of pastries. They were good also. Shall surely visit again next year.

According to me The no. Of  desserts were quite less as these r specially liked by people. Crispy fried corn was very tasteful. All the items starting from kebabs main course n desserts were delicious.. i just felt if barbeque nation can bring out some more desserts at the end, for this reason only i m not giving you 4 or 4.5. Brought a cake as complimentary item for us as i booked for my mom dad's marriage anniversary. And a family picture as a gift from there side. Which was really sweet. All the staffs were really well mannered.

I visited the place on mahasaptami with my hubby and sister in law. This place is perfect to hangout with your loved ones. You can have your "we-time", because of the ambience.
Now coming to the food part. Here all we can have is from the buffet only, ala-carte is not available in this branch of barbeque nation. But still you can have a lot of variety of food. The buffet costs 1200, and includes hilsa vapa, pomfret, but this is only during durga puja. 
In desserts, one should try malai kulfi and paan kulfi. 
Don't ignore the desserts (the best part of barbeque nation) . For one day you can forget about your diet and can add extra calories to it.

Eat till your stomach bursts! That's the thing that comes to mind when I think about Barbeque Nation and it does actually happens!
The place is located just beside RDB Boulevard, an appropriate location and what amazing food they serves! Everything, from the variety of grilled starters like
1. Paneer Tikka
2. Chicken
3. Prawn.
4. Fish
5. Sheekh Kebab
6. Chicken Wings....are few to mention. Followed by the lavish variation of the main course that not only included Chinese but had a huge range of Indian dishes also especially
1. Murg Biriyani
2. Mutton Roganjosh
3. Fish Masala
4. Patiala Egg Curry..... with the choice of assorted breads! The desert counters were a bliss, serving
1. Hot Gulab Jamun
2. Ice cream
3. Fruits.
5. Phirni
6. Cakes....and not to mention their live Kulfi Counter!!
Everything was just bang on here!! Not to mention the warmth and great hospitality of the staffs.
From the start till the end, the food journey here was absolutely a pleasure! The price is totally worth paying for the amazing food!!
A must must visit for every food lover!
P.S - They did serve an amazing birthday cake to make it even more special!

Rating this place is nothing short of a futile activity. This is the go to place for most corporate folks.
This place has the most exemplary services and in terms of hospitality will give any 5 star property a run for it money.
They put their money where there mouth is and churn out an experience one doesn't forget.
One must have figured by now how big a BN (Barbeque Nation) fan boy I am.
The reason for this undying love for BN is their never ending starter spread and their wondful service.
I give the main course a miss almost always since I am overwhelmed by their starters and desserts.

The main course is good but nothing to go gaga about.

The unmissable items are "Sholo key angaare" and their exquisite range of kulfis with the pan kulfi stealing the show.

Stop reading this review and just go n book a table in any of their outlets (the other one being in park street).

Barbeque Nation is a place which hardly leaves any room for disappointment. It is literally a foodie's paradise! Having been there on a number of occasions, I can assure you that this place gives off an aura that's impossible to resist. What should I start with? The steaming lip-smacking kebabs? The wonderful serving of yummy baby corn that you get served straightway? The sumptuous main course? Or the heavenly desert section(my personal favorite)? The courteous staff are so friendly that they will actually re-cook the starters according to your personal preference. They did that for us twice.. With the chicken wings. Nothing to complain about this place.. It's simply out of the world. Highly recommended.

The highest rated restaurant in Kolkata and indeed so, cause the moment you step inside youll cherish each moment.
Ambience is beyond words and the staff is excellent and are really friendly.
The food, well I dont know where to start form.
All the appeteizer were savoring, especially the sweet corn, chicken wings and the prawn kebabs.For main course, I didn't have much as I was saving myself for the dessert but the mutton which I had was prepared just like its made at my home and was absolutely delightful.
At last coming to dessert, my visit to Barbeque Nation is all about the dessert portion.
I mean whats not to like in dessert, from the tiny hot gulab jamuns to the pastries and pudding everything feels like heaven.
And finally to put the cheery on top "Khulfis"
Just two words for it Total Bliss ‚ù§Ô∏è

Loved the experience we had today.
Will be back for more üòÅ

I had been meaning to come here since it opened and finally got the opportunity to make the journey, we were not disappointed. Went here today with my Bestie for Dinner, without a reservation and we were seated promptly. But we did notice that just 10 minutes later, a queue had formed outside, so it may be better to reserve a table if there are more than two people dining. We luckily missed the rush!

Today we had gone to Barbeque Nation. It is in Sector 5. We had earlierly booked our seats ar 2.30 p.m. However due to the extreme rush, we were postponed by 10 minutes. With an empty stomach we went inside. The waiters came and greeted us courteously. We were given a side table. A complimentary drink was served. The grill was placed. In an eye's blink, four or five types of kebabs, were placed. Now come to the taste. The Chicken Angari Kebab was beyond description. The Mutton Seekh Kebab and the Fish Kebab were really succulent. The Prawn Kebab was too tasty. We were also served Mushroom and Paneer Kebabs. Chicken wings and fried corn were also served. The kebabs were served at quite a rapid pace. The kebabs filled nearly three fourth of the stomach. Frankly speaking, I had more than ten Prawn kebabs.
Moving to the main course, we had a delightful experience. There were so many choices that all the dishes couldn't be tasted !!!! Others can do it... There were Singaporean Noodles, Malai Kofta, different salads and pickles, Chicken Biryani, Murgir Jhol (Chicken in a thick gravy), Mutton Roganjosh, Fish Masala, Fried Rice and some other delicacies. A live Pasta corner was also there. All these dishes were delectable and mouth watering. 
Lastly, arrived the desserts, which made the stomach "food-tight" . There was a live Kulfi corner. There were different cakes, pies, a fruit custard, Firni, Gulab Jamun and ice cream. Overall, the total experience was a magical one. The bill was also reasonable costing around Rs. 2400/- for 3 inclusive of taxes. The waiters always surrounded us and were keen to assist us to have the best experience as possible. Thus my final tabulation stands as ---
Service -- 5/5
Food -- 4.5/5 (Quality of Biryani can be improved slightly)
Ambience -- 5/5 
Overall satisfaction -- 5/5.
My experience was fantastic and would remain evergreen. Keep it up Team Barbeque Nation !!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòáüòáüòáüòá

The highest rated place in zomato, ever. It truly deserves the rating. Their service is top notch & warm, hats off to them. On my latest visit I just tried their starters & desserts (the strength of this place). What I liked best was the Chicken & the mutton kebab & their kulfi, gulab jamun & mudpie. 
The quality & quantity of food they serve at this price, is commendable for its worth every penny. Plus they give a complimentary cake on special occasions & this is such a wonderful gesture. Cheers to the team!

Visited the restaurant on the eve of Mahastami 2017. The ambience was nice. Food was really good. The menu was durga puja special. So was the rate. Normally buffet costs around 1000 INR. Durga puja special rate was 1200. 

But the added benefit of having a dinner during durga puja was the additional fish items (Ilish / Hilsa) vapa and Pomfret tandoori). Normally ilish (Hilsa) vapa and Pomfret tandoori is not a part of the standard menu.

Just a small tip for my (middle class) foodie friends. Concentrate on the fish items rather than fascinating about chicken tikka / tandoori, if you want to make you pennies count.

I searched up how much profit the restaurant makes which left even more dumbfounded. Around 30% net margin.... Its simply magical. Nevertheless, if you have never visited this place before, do visit it. Just order kebabs and desserts, and you will definitely have a best time of your life dining out here, no exaggeration.

Lunch today at Barbecue Nation, Salt Lake City outlet, Kolkata. No doubt it was superlative in terms of ambience, taste, freshness, variety of items available, and general behavior of staff. Excellent value for money. The barbecued items, both vegetarian, and non vegetarian were superb.. a never ending pampering by stewards with smiling faces and sizzling goodies. The biryani was Awadhi for a change, not the Kolkata variety, served without fail in Kolkata restaurants. And its not all about food only. BN offers a choice of complimentary beverages also (including beer!) and a huge range of desserts.
|
On the whole, the restaurant is highly recommended. But it accepts bookings only. So the Restaurant App comes in handy. Off-the-street customers have very little chance to get a seat in this high-in-demand restaurant.

Was informed that BN will be making forays in Patna and Ranchi cities too. Good for Patnaites and Ranchiites also!!

Overall, a very good experience..looking forward to visit it again for sure..

No restaurant can be perfect and a 5 star reveiw for the sake of perfection is a serious misconception, hence my rating is based on my satisfaction percentage and which i gurantee was 100 pc here.
FOOD
Starters-Chicken kebabs:really good
Fish kebabs: basa fish ...good@
Prawn kebab: very good
Paneer kebab:soft and succulent 
Tandoori aloo: good
Cajun spiced potato: good but they dont peel the potatos for this dish
Mushroom kebab: good 
Paneer kebab: succulent fresh beautiful! 
Mutton seekh kebab: good
Chicken wing kebab: not so tasty
Crispy sweet corn:awsum!! A perfct dish...dis1 cbt gt bttrüòâ
Cheese stuffed paneer kebab:we asked the chef if he could make a cheese kebab wid paneer 4 us..he happily obliged and presented us with a wonderful paneer tikka stuffed wid lots of cheese seasoned with paprika nd oregano. And thats the extent the go to satisfy their customers! This is really commendable!
Maincourse-Seafood salad:good
Chiken salad:good
Fish with bones: good
Mutton vindaloo:improvement in terms of catering to the regional flavour can be made in this dish. Bengalis use a handsome share of garlic and onions when the marinate their meat and use it also in the gravy. Lack of that mkes the mutton dish of many buffets really boring nd here it was no exception. 
Baby corn mushrooms takatak- tasty 
Malai kofta- okay
Chiken biriyani-not so good skip it
Lacha paratha- made of atta nt good
Pasta in white sauce-yummy
Deserts-
German silk pastry:yummy
Cheesecake:good
Fruit tart- awsome!!!the cream was so light. Beautiful pastry!
Kulfis: really good
Hot gulab jamun: good
Complementary drinks-coke and fresh lime soda (lovely)
There wer other dishes as well which i was too full to try out.
Coming to the ambience and service these two were impeccable. The waiters,manager and the chef as well spoiled us like bratsüòâ....they value their customers highly. 
And we reported by 12:30 so we got the early bird rates and a discount of 150 rs(1st app booking on bbq ntn app) as well which sums up to a really well sorted date‚ò∫
And do ask for your complementary cake if you are there to celebrate any occasion no mtr how small and watch how they make your day.

1. Bbq nation as a chain is good . So is this one with the taste of the food they serve.
2. Frequency of mushrooms and prawns is throttled. So you have to ask multiple times before they bring them to you.
3. Veg options are good. Roasted pineapple, apple. I have heard from veggie friends they taste good. I don't like fruits being treated as veggies ;) but hey if that works for people, Awesome :-)
4. I had to fight for basic rights when trying to organise a party for 60 people. That was a turnoff for me. For smaller groups, i would definitely recommend it though.

Well. The Barbeque Nation is a good place to go if you're an ardent lover of barbeque-d food. I went for the Friday lunch buffet ( 2:30 pm slot ).
The unlimited supply of well cooked kebabs as starters brought a smile on my face. The tender meat with perfect amount of smokiness awekened the happy glutton in me. They provided a deep fried sweet corn tossed in spices and red onion as an accompanionment. And they served a few other stuff like curd, mustard sauce too.
The paya soup was a little strong on pepper for me.
The main course served was not at par. But the desserts were lip smacking good. The over all experience was okayish. However the kebabs need a big shout out to.
And definitely the prompt service and amiable waiters definitely win a lot of brownie points.

The review is based on the salt lake sector 5 outlet. I have visited this place multiple times. It is very easy to locate. It is situated near RDB. Whenever you will visit this place, whether on weekends or weekdays you will find it full of foodies so I suggest you to book table before visiting here.
Ambiance:
The ambiance is nice with proper lighting. The decor is also good and the place is having nice and comfortable sitting arrangements.

Staff:
The staff is very friendly and helpful. The service is really good and fast. They don't keep you waiting for food which I really like about this place. The chef is also sometimes take review and suggestions from people which I have rarely seen it in any other restaurants.

Food:
Talking about food, I really like the starters. They have variety for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I have tried mutton, chicken teriyaki, fish kebab, chicken wings, fried corns, potato skewers, paneer skewers. They also provide complementary drink in which they have aam pana, beer and lemonade in options. The main course have so many options like salads, soup, Manchurian etc. I have tried manchow soup, chicken soup, all types of salad, chicken, mutton, Hyderabadi biryani and noodles. The dessert is the best part. The options are pastry, fruits, gulab jamun, ice cream ( vanilla and strawberry) and kulfi. I have tried pan, Kesar, strawberry kulfi. Pan kulfi is really nice. Please try it once.

Overall experience is good. I really like to visit again. If you are a foodie then you will like this place.

One of the most famous food joint when talked about buffet lunch.I visited this outlet several times with my college friends,office colleagues,relatives.The most attractive and delicious part of this buffet is their starters.I think they should work on their main course specially on the mutton preparation.Dessert is cool and those different flavours of kulfi make it wide apart from other buffet lunches or dinners.

We had Buffet dinner here. On my review I want to be brief and direct. I believe my review will help people to set their expectations.

1> AMBIENCE and SERVICE
#Its Average, Cant say great but not bad.
#Light intensity is OK 
#Not a romantic place for sure.
#Good venue for family and friends.
#Service is good, you will feel comfortable.

2> FOOD
#They will provide you as much as you want in starters and main course with a smile.
#On the starter Chicken items are good. They are juicy and soft.
#Mutton is not good at all.
#Pron is not well cooked, tasteless ( I have visited more than once, and its every time. So cant be a coincidence ).
#Veg starters are OK.
#Main courses are very ordinary. Fish is below the mark. 
#Mutton and chicken are average.
#Rice items are normal.
#Sweets and desserts are good, You will have different varieties and shapes and colors and flavors.
#Live coolfi stall, grab them as much as you can.

OVERALL== Quantity wise it is good, not for quality. Eat as much as you can, but you will miss the soft spot.

Been here today for lunch. 1st of all the starters were excellent, we had fish kebab,mutton kebab,chicken,prawn,paneer,aalo,mushroom and pineapple kebab. Except pineapple,all we good,prawn was best among them.
Now coming to main course, there was a lot of items available in both veg and non veg section. The salads were great,chicken salad was really tasty. The chicken dum briyani was not upto the mark. The malai kofto wae very good and so was the chilli chicken. And most importantly today i had the best mutton soup of my life,The soup was excellent. Thanks to the chef for the excellent soup. Overall the main coursecwas good except dum briyani.
Now coming to the deserts, a lot of items available there. Vanilla and strawberry ice Cream, cakes,sweets, gulab jamun. And koolfi, i had mango,paan and kesar pista koofi, honestly not a single one tasted good. The mango snd kesar pista was worst. Road side kulfi tastes much better. And tastes of the koolfis was only because of the sauces,the koolfi itself had no taste. They should look about the koolfi.
Over all a good experience,would like to visit again and again. Just the koolfis needs to have some taste of their not and not of the sauces and syrups only.
And yes they provided a sweet lime soda as an complimentary drink,and you can have other drinks also to order from for the drink menu.
Thank you Barbeque Nation.

Lots of options for starters especially for non-vegetarians, be it chicken, fish or kebabs. Not much variety for vegetarians. Live counter for Pasta can be skipped. Main course doesn't look very appealing after rounds of starters. The staff is too good. 10/10. The best part is the chef came to say hi and a quick introduction. Lots pf desserts to choose from. One of the best places for buffet lovers

Needless to say,the best buffet in town. :3 
Things to eat: the starters, especially the moist mustard fish, the grilled prawn,chicken wings,crispy sweet corn and mutton sheekh kebab stood out. They also provide 3 sauces and chilly vinegar,lemon mustard and black pepper for coating the starters while they're being grilled on your table.
Main course is what you get everywhere, so nothing except the dum aloo biryani stood out for me, although all dishes were at par with any good restaurant.
The dessert contains gulab jamun,ice cream,German silk cake,two in one cheese cake, Swiss roll, fruit tart,fresh fruit,six flavoured kulfis. The gulab jamun stood out for me.
The amount comes to 1009 per head with tax and is a dream come true for foodies. Definitely a must try.

Finally Ticked this Off from my Bookmark List at Gandhi Jayanti....

Location : Salt Lake, Sector V just beside RDB Cinemas.

Dined in at 12.00 pm (That resulted me an Early Bird offer 623/- + 112/- = 735/- ALL which is only available from Mon-Thurs if you dine in before 12.30 pm.

INTRODUCTION : Barbeque Nation.... This is not only a name but a place where every die hard foodie whether a Vegetarian or Non vegetarian would love to visit once in its lifetime. It is so difficult to make someone smile and happy by making good food and this place has always able to do so everytime a person visit this place. Whether a Kid or a elder person or an old person nobody gets disappointed here who loves to eat. A place always dosent need to shoutout about themselves by providing offers or putting banners or advertisement but just only providing quality food with overwhelming service. This is what Barbeque Nation has achieved in this span of time for them, the always 4.5+ rating speaks for them.

AMBIANCE : Mentioned above a place always don't need to shoutout by other means and everything should always be kept simple and stick to the basics. This very place has the same thing in them, if you see the ambiance so they have kept it quite simple as for a restaurant and let their Food speak for them. Its a long ambiance which can contain around 60-80 people (guessed) at once. Sittings are made comfortable with wooden soft chairs and sofas. The table they have is something to talk about because its comes with a inbuilt barbeque where the starters are served and all you have to do is self serve urself when you want to.¬†

SERVICE : Ok.. now service is something which is the most important feature of any restaurant as for me. It dosent matter how good your food is but when the service disappoints the entire hard work goes in vain. But this was not the case here. From the Booking via phone till dinning in to the table nothing went wrong. The entire staff was very effective and cooperative. Always kept an eye on the table and served well.

FOOD : It was time to eat at the most talked about place in the city. This was my second experience at BBQ as i have already visited Park Street one and the experience there was way more disappointing with the food and the service. The Menu was Set and it was NV for me and it had
In starters:
1. Chicken Tereyaki

2. Prawn Kebabs

3. Fish Kebabs

4. Mutton Seekh Kebabs

5. Chicken Wings

When you have such a huge expectation from such a place who always maintains a rating of 4.9 then there is no margin for error. The only reason for the Rating 4 is due to the disappointment of the initial starters which were not upto the mark. The second round had covered a little. Chicken was alright and fish was later made spicy when asked but prawn tasted little bland from inside. Chicken wings were tasty and seekh kebab was also lip smacking.

Main Course : (Which i had)
1. Fried Rice
2. Chilly Chicken
3. Chicken Biryani
4. Mutton
5. Fish

Fried rice went well only when the chilly chicken gravy was added to the rice or the rice was very tasteless for me. Also want to special mention the Fish which very spicy and tasty the best among the Main course. Mutton was breaking with ease. I didnt expected biryani to be this good here after Park street's incident.

Desserts :
Pastries
Gulab Jamun
Firni
Ice Cream (Vanilla and Starwberry)
Misti Doe if m not mistaken
Kulfi (i tried Mango and Chocolate Kulfi). And again a special mention to that lady at the Park street Kulfi counter with such a smile and promising service when i visited there May 19th.

My second visit to yet another BBQ Nation with family was joyful indeed only some ups and downs there. But i hope this place will keep amazing people in the coming time. Would definitely visit again once more... Cheers to BBQ Nation....

I have been to a lot of buffet places but nothing matches the taste and service offered at BARBECUE NATION. You are lucky if you get a table without waiting as this place is always full with foodies. The variety of starters offered at this place is phenomenal. You cannot remember the names of all the dishes but the following are a must try:
1. Chicken Teriyaki
2. Prawn Kebabs
3. Mustard Fish Kebabs
4. Mutton Seekh Kebabs
5. Chicken Wings
6. Pineapple Skewers(Don‚Äôt miss this)
7. Potato Skewers

You get around 5‚Äì6 varieties of salads and some of them are phenomenal. Especially the Waldorf Salad, it steals the show.

Coming to the main course, you would be delighted to see the menu, whether you are a vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Starting from Hyderabadi dum biriyani to mutton, chicken and fish dishes, you would not be disappointed by what the restaurant offers in non vegetarian section. If you are a vegetarian, you would love the paneer gravy items as well as the dal makhani.

Coming to desserts, ice-creams, angoori gulab jamuns, pastries, brownies, phirni, fresh fruits, you would never run out of options. Try them all. 

And the bonus, Kulfi Counter, the best climax a meal can ever get. You have 6 varieties of kulfi to try from.

If you haven‚Äôt visited this place yet, you are missing a foodie‚Äôs paradise. üòçüòçüòç

My personal favourite. The best service in any restaurant in Kolkata. Food is outstanding. You must visit it. The best place to celebrate a birthday. The staffs celebrate with you with a cake and short musical performance. The cook visits every customer to receive feedback while the food is served. The quantity of food is much more than you expect.

One should prepare from the day before you plan to visit this place. The awesomeness of the kababs along with the drink of your choice would make you forget about the intake of calories in case you are a health freak.
The main course which has wide variety of both Veg and Non Veg are real treat to your taste buds. Mutton lovers should not miss their mutton dish. Biryani also has a light aroma which can be enough to make your stomach happy.
I suggest to keep some space to adjust the desert. The wide variety of kulfi is one of best in this city. Apart from the kulfi you also have wide range of awesome desert selection.
This is one of the best buffet dinner in Kolkata.
What stands out is that the staff is always ready to know your feedback and the chef is eager to know more about your choices. At the end if you want to tip them all, they would return that to you with a smile.
I should not miss that you get a valet parking on the busy road and that is also without any expectation of a tip...

Sorry for the extremely late review. Visited Barbeque Nation, Coimbatore on 27th July 2017, was away from Calcutta for official tour. Expected the least to find an outlet so nearby the station. Went for dinner and felt like at Kolkata within. Not to mention the awesome and elaborate spread and the perfect North Indian flavour and taste. And most importantly thanks to the team of Coimbatore outlet they celebrated my birthday and surprised me with a cake and a birthday chorus. Never expected my birthday so well spent away from home, and a very very special thanks to my colleague Soham Ghosh for the treat. It really made my day. And thanks again to Team Barbeque Nation for making my birthday a memory tp cherish forever. Hope to spend more birthdays and special events at Barbeque Nation in the years to come.

My first visit to the very hyped barbeque nation was during last year's Durga puja.. situated in salt lake sector five (grnd floor to rdb boulevard) it's never empty.. catering to packed houses in all seasons..kebabs were ok.. nothing out of the box..the main course was good.. they had this sorshe ilish that was one of the tastiest I have had so far... though the dessert Parlour wasn't impressive but the live kulfi counter did steal the show...the pan flavoured kulfi should not be missed on.. when it comes to kebabs..personally I feel flame and grill is way more better than bbq nation.

Now come to food...
1) Starters: 5/5 (Chicken, Prawn, Mushroom, Fish(most probably Basa) bbq and especially fried corn was just awesome)
2) Main Course: 4.5/5 (Chicken dum biryani, mutton was good)
3) Desserts: 5/5 ( Mango pastries, gulab jamun, firni, kulfies especially Malai kulfi and Paan kulfi was just awesome)

It is located just beside Pantaloons beside Chai Break.
They are excellent with their kababs are to die for.
Be it the prawn, mutton, chicken or mushroom, each kabab melts in the mouth.
I was bit disappointed with the main course items. They were a bit lagging behind in taste in comparison to the kababs.
Again the deserts were a top notch in its flavour.
If you call yourself a foodie and you've not yet been here, you are missing a great deal my friend.

My last visit was on the 31st Dec 2016 i used to be a regular celebrating every occasion with my family and friends. But was really very saddened to hear that you have stopped LIVE MUSIC your live band was the life of your restaurant and my family really used to look forward to go visit it and even used to go up and sing with the band. Would really appreciate it if you could get your BAND BACK as i cant take my old parents and kids to a disco or any other place to enjoy and celebrate.

This place was the talk of the town apparently ; very much famous for its exuberant service and even more delectable food. The staff were Extreme courteous and we were given tables within minutes after we entered the premises. Now coming to the food , the starters were a show stopper to say the least , where we were served a variety of kebabs. Chicken , lamb , prawn , paneer , roasted pineapple and mushrooms were all placed on the grill and instantaneously replaced as we gobbled upon these roasted delicacies. Along with these were also given a sweet corn salad and chilli garlic fish ( bhetki ) , which simply melted in your mouth as you chewed upon it. To be honest , the starters were so good that we kind off filled up our appetite with these itself, with little to no place left for the main course. For the main course we had schezwan chicken , fried rice , chicken dum biriyani , gosht curry and some authentic Bengali preparations like pabda maacher jhaal and basanti pulao. Pulao and chutney were also their to ease out your mammoth intake of heavenly food. We had to wait for 30 mins before we progressed onto the desserts, a vital rest period after some serious eating was absolutely essential! The wait however , was absolutely worth it as we were greeted with a wide array of pastries , which were either chocolate , rainbow frosted or cheesecakes. Their was mini gulab jamuns , kulfi and fruit slices too to tickle that sweet tooth of yours. Overall , the experience was absolutely heavenly, and it was nothing short of a day in culinary paradise. The entire buffet along with taxes cost us 853/- per person , and trust me , it was worth every penny ;)

Go during dinner time, and u will find this place jam-packed. No worry, the management here is very good and will arrange u a seat within 10-15 min... The food here is good, especially the kebabs, this place is famous for its starters, and dessert. The main course is also delicious . But I'll suggest u to not have drinks here coz price is generally on a high scale. Everything here is just perfect. Change in the menu will be appreciated.

I went there on 6th September 2017 for a lunch along with my frndzzz. I think dis place is best for buffet. Varieties starts from the Mouth watering starters and end in dessert. What sud i say what a starters all r delicious den main course is also good den come dessert most fav is hot golap jamuns different sweet icecreams has also variety from different flavoured icecream to coolfie along with pan cum icecream. Too much items was there Dt i can't exactly mention d name ohh yaa raita nd varieties of salads was also tasty. This is a perfect place for foodies. Complementary drinks available was also good, waiters was very polite and always available to serve or for help. #Foodies try this place once atleast. This place is very friendly for kids to youngsters, corporate  guys to casuals and also for families.

This is the best buffet in the town, it always exceeds its own set standards. Be it starters, main course , desserts or added KULFI counter everything is better than what you expect every time. Restaurant staffs are super cool and very courteous...I must say , you guys are best in the town.

First of all the service and customer satisfaction is the best among all buffet places.. Hats off that u guys are maintaining such polite behavior here is kolkata which is very surprising.  
Okay now the food
Starters - tasty as anything but lacks variety as a restaurant with a 4.9 rating is expected to stand out from others..
Main course - again very tasty but number of items has to be increased.. 
Dessert - not smthing i wd recoment here.  But not bad if u have a sweet tooth. 

Overall a good one.  üòä

Simply mouthwatering grills. Chef's special item was "finger-lickingly" good. Full marks on service. Sumptuous dishes are arranged for self service basis.  But walking infront  of the items won't disappoint you because here you get hot golapjamuns and ice cream scoops are just as these should be (moderately cold). Liquor price is a little bit high. But the environment it provides is truly unmatched.

There is nothing much that can be said about this place except the fact that I had to wait for almost 3 hours before getting a seat on a Saturday afternoon. And the wait was totally worth it!!
The food here is brilliant, and especially the starters and the desserts, there is no comparison in my opinion. Brownie with vanilla ice-cream is what one should focus more on.
One visit to this place can never be enough and it is highly recommended for a glutton!! :-D

Visited the restaurant on 9th September with family. This is a perfect place for friends and family to enjoy.The starters are probably the best part and one thing more I like are the courteous staff always looking after your needs. Probably one of the best restaurant chains in India for buffet spreads.

Went for a team lunch today. Barbeque Nation is all time favorite when it comes to eat as much as ones stomach permits. As the service was as usual impeccable, food was not up to the mark. They have introduced breezer in complementary drinks, which is good. But the size of the kebabs have been reduced quite a lot. The fish kebabs and chicken kebabs were not even bite size, half bite size would be appropriate here. Prawns were charred so black that it lost taste. Per stick only two pieces of mushroom kebabs were there. Mushroom kebabs were very tasty. Apart from that, remaining starters were ok. Main course, which i have avoided most, were ok ok type as per my colleagues. Desserts were good. The strawberry ice cream was reach and tasty. Other dessert items were standard. Full marks for the service provided.

This place is swarming with reviews.

I don't know if some one will really need to read this or not. Cause you don't need good reviews to be a good restaurant. You need to be a good restaurant with good etiquette and moral senses to get the best review. Its the other way round actually. So, they have done there part. Now its my time to judge the scores.
Lets see now,

Food On the Grills - 4.5/5
Ambiance - 5.5/5 extra point for some extra good ambiance
Restaurant Conduct - 5.5/5 extra point for etiquette (Read till end you will know why?)
Wait Time - Not/Applicable
Plating and Decor - 4.5/5 for table sides.

Well its the best I have given to some one. And they deserve it.

The story so far for extra credits :-

Just the prawns were about to be served and I remembered i am allergic to prawns and shrimps as many of you know so I raised an allergy alert. At this point if you are the owner of the restaurant you will wish many customers be like me ;-) just kidding. How ever these guy just left me speechless as they decided to bring a chef right beside my table and cook something special for me served at table side so that i don't feel short of choice. How nice of you guys! The chicken was perfectly cooked, plated and served. It was pretty awesome.

I was in a awe, that they even customized the mutton starter as i needed it.

But wait, here comes the best part, I left a tip for the best service received. Suddenly while i was about to leave the table, "Sir, we don't accept tips here, We are taking the service charges already included in your buffet price."¬†

Well, I got all this in a little above 700 INR.¬†

I definitely recommend this place, well i only recommend the rest (weather to visit this place) is up to you ;-)¬†

And ohh... The food was so good that i forgot to take the photos :'-( was busy eating. :D :D :D

After almost 4 5 years may b visited this place for our most awaited team lunch on last monday. Frankly as lot of non veg items I had quit like mutton, biryani n sweet pastries its a little biased review may b... the place accommodation n comforters ok or more than terms of y and  ok.. starting with appetizers fish kebab, paneer kebab r delicious but chicken kebab ws below the xpected quality. Previously it was far better than this. Smashed potato, mushroom kebabs n prawn kebabs r bttr.. sweet corn kebab was not upto the mark. apart from this they have mutton sik kebabs also. Non veg salads r good and welcome complementary aampanna/fresh lime soda was good. Coming to main course veggie was brilliant in terms of variety n quality. Veg soup iz poor but non veg soup was oky..Daal, rice, veg gravy, noodles r good. Non veg tasted nly chicken n pona fish gravy. Both r as expected.. but apart from this they have biryani, mutton masala.. coming to desserts they have fresh fruits i.e really very good n pastries were good as of heard from my colleagues... apart from this gulabjamuns n icecream r also very good as of they told.. only sweet live counter 4 kulfi which I jave tasted .. pan, malai, kesarpista, mango all 4 kulfi flavours r delicious.. worth of a early bird 750 bucks non veg buffet. Better if u can digest a lot in lunch good place for you. But better to visit the park street branch it is far better...

Great place to hang out with friends and family. The place is definitely going to seen expensive if you don't have a large appetite. Jokes apart. You must try this out.

After a long wait, finally we Visited in barbq nation on yesterday.. We were so much excited!! But, after checking out, we were much disappointed about the food quality & taste!! The food quality is not up to the mark as a famous restaurant in Kolkata!! Barbq is one of the famous restaurants in kolkata, but now days, their food quality & taste are drop out!!! The ambience was pretty good.. But their was a shortage of rest room!! One rest room for men & one for women, but the restaurant has a lots of crowed even in week days!! That's why, people making line, to go to the toilet or rest room!!! It's very embarrassing!!
At the starts, they offer a complimentary drinks.. There was a lots of complimentary drinks available, like, Mango Panna, coke, beer, sprite, etc!!
The starters are not so good!! There was a lots of Staters like Chiken kabab, mutton kabab, mushroom, swami kabab, potato kabab, panir kabab, prawn kabab etc.. The swami kabab & Chiken kabab are very delicious!! But other's are flop!! Specially mutton & prwan kabab are just worst!! In main course, they have Chiken briyani, Chiken vindaloo, Chiken fried rice, soup, daal makhani, etc etc!! Chiken fried rice was good.. I'm not satisfied with their Staters & main course!! In main course, Chiken vindaloo, briyani, daal makhani, butter nun are super flop!! But their desert was very yummy!! I just simply grab the deset items.. There was a different types of cakes, pestry, kheer, gulab jamun, water melon, ice cream, coolfi.. Fully satisfied with their desert.. Specially coolfi & pastries are just awsome!! In, over all there was a lots of items, but most items are flop!!
I must say, about their service & manners..
OMG, seriously outstanding service of the boys.. Their approach, manners were very friendly & Co operative.. Specially, a boy, name Gopal, he is very decent & frndly.. The Manager is also a very decent & frndly person.. I gave them 5 out of 5 about their service & manners.. In Over all, I must say, about the taste of food is need to be more improvement otherwise it's a enjoyable place.. The price of Buffet is decent.. Including gst it's 851/- head..
If there is any mistakes in my review, I will be apologies.
Thank you.. üòä

If you are looking for a good buffet of food, this is the place you should go. A variety of starters and main courses. Mouth watering kulfi is something you don't see always in a buffet. For lunch one drink is complementary. In short this place is worthy all your time and money.

Ok so this place is my personal favorite.Located in sector 5 this place draws huge crowds even on weekdays.The place is known for its buffet spread.
From fish to Chicken to Mutton & even the veg items u will get all of that in the starters.Their main course is decent too.Deserts are too die for and also the different types of kulfi on offer makes it even greater.
If u are looking for the best starters in town then this is the place to be and the amount u pay for it is quite reasonable if you are a Foodie.

Some of the main course items are good, but it's better to skip main course and having dessert after starter. Desserts are awesome, specially kulfis. Moreover ambience,service,food and the price is good. Hope to visit here again.

This is my 100th review of Zomato, so was very much curious for which restaurant I should write for and then a thinking came in my mind, why not write for the best buffet restaurant on my 100th review?

Yes you heard me right, 'The best buffet in the town'! You hardly found any foodie in the town who has not heard about the BBQ Nation. The brand basically bring a new era about buffet and dining experiences in the town.

Been there few weeks ago with one of my friend. The restaurant located at the ground floor of RDB Cinema Building, opposite of Infinity Building. The restaurant always keep busy during working hour, so better to reserve your table before visiting this restaurant.

After entering the restaurant and verifying your booking, the stuff will guide you to your table. Then they ask you, what you want between Non Veg or Veg buffet! They also give you one complimentary drinks from their list. As a starter they have chicken tikka kebab, grilled prawn, crispy babycorn, fish tikka, mutton seekh kebab etc. You can take omelette from live egg counter. All of them are just finger licking, specially the crispy baby corn, chicken tikka kebab, and the prawn!

After starter, then they guide you towards main course, where you will get Mixed fried rice, Biriyani, Fish kofta, chow mein, ¬†chicken and mutton side dish. They also offer you Soup and various kind of fruit and veggie salad. All of them are brilliantly prepared and tastes good but not so awesome like their starter item. biriyani was not warm, so didn't get the actual flavour. Chow mein was less salty but other items were good.

Now come to dessert. In the dessert section, they have two different varieties of ice cream, sliced fruit, pudding, brownie, kiwi cake, firni and gulab jamun! All of them just awesome, specially the firni, pudding & gulab jamun. They offer you some awesome kulfi from their Live Kulfi counter. From all of kulfi flavour, Paan and mango flavour is really something for which you can really die for.

So in conclusion, I will say from welcome to service, food, ambiance and hospitality everything is just perfect. During having your starter, they would ask you about their food quality, if anything need to improvise according to your taste. They also give you complimentary cake, if you are celebrating your B'day here. Overall an awesome dining experiences. Will visit this restaurant again. :) :)

I went there last year with my friend and his office friend for his b'day treat. This place is the best. From ambience to the waiter everything was perfect. Live music was performed there. One thing you should do is to pre book your table. It helps. Because out side there people qued up to enter. So if you don't want any kind of trouble then do pre book your table.

Coming to the food. It is great and mouth watering. We took 3 hours to complete our dinner üòÖ. There were a variety of foods. In the buffet at first there were kabebs, a variety of it. There were so many of it that I forgot their names. There were chicken kabeb, prawn and veg kabebs. You can also order alcohol. Then the main course. There were biryani, polao and lots of kind of it. Desert were delicious. Altogether it is a outstanding place. One should go there once to taste how good Berbeque Nationa is. üòä

Appreciable behavior of all staff and shef.

If people think about the "Paradise of Buffet" is only here here and nowhere else. Its very hard to find words to describe this place. This is a place that fulfills your tummy but not your heart üíì. Everytime I eat there it feels that still I can have some more. Their service is awesome and one can just enjoy the starters that they serve that too sizzling hot. The main course I found to be average, but again the desserts are just you can't deny to have those sinful desserts. Except the size of the place I find it always to be happening. You should try to get a bigger place to accomodate more foodies like us. Keep up the good work. Kudos.

Went there for a Monday Lunch that too with 16 odd people. You can guess it was a birthday treat.
We opted for early bird which is app 630 for veg and 750 for non veg including tax.
I had been to bbq nation but I was surprised this time. The food had no taste.They were late,the tandoor was empty most of the times. The fried chicken had no salt ,just normal chicken wings fried,no spices nothing.
The fish and chicken or the prawn was so so..nothing out of the word.
The main course was nice. BBQ is never known for its biryani,so biryani was as usual so so. The fried rice was amazing. There was this Bengali fish curry which was nice.Rest just there for name's sake.
The desert section was crowded. People filling one, two plates with food so that they don't need to come again. The desert section had small gulaab jamoon , pastry,tarrts ,kheer ,fruits and custard.
Nothing out of the world. The ice cream section adds to its unique Ness And kulfie with pan masala was the best.
Overall not at all satisfied , maybe it's was my bad luck that I didnot get the best of BBQ that day.

I was there last Thursday to celebrate my childhood friends birthday with my wife to experience the buffet. Overall it was good. Huge starters and main course section. I had Red label n my wife had mint julep. Cocktail was good. Being a hotelier I would rather suggest to increase the sizes of the starters. It was too small. Taste wise it was good. Coming to the main course, food quality again good but very common items. There was a live pasta counter but I was surprised to see the chef don't know how to make Aglio olio preparation. However I was there to help him out. Coming to the dessert section. It was awesome. My wife n me loved that. Varities of kulfi n gulab jamun. Really nice. Service was also very good. They all are very polite n helpful. At the end it was all my suggestions not complain. I will come again.

Best value for money. The best thing is the spread and the courteous staff. You can get good buffets everywhere and maybe even better food somewhere but you won't get this package. I will tell you why. We were using a particular sauce more than the others and they actually took notice of it and without us even asking for it provided us an extra bowl of it. 
They didn't have to do it and yes these small things matter. That is why they get 5 from me otherwise it was a 4.5.

Had a non veg buffet on 15th August. They offered various grilled starter & a wide range of buffet menu. The price is pretty fare according to the items they offered. Service is also pretty quick and staffs are quite decent. They greeted us with a complimentary cake. Tastewise the food was average. I was expecting a better culinary experience. Although its a pretty nice place & cosy for family or friends hangout. Always crowded...so if you want a quite & romantic place or want to have specialty cuisine...i think this is not the right place to be in.

A review for barbeque nation has been long overdue. All praises for this restaurant has been spreading like wildfire in my circle and the day finally arrived when I got to sit down with friends and have a big fat, sumptuous dinner! First things first, If you have already planned you want to try this joint out, make a reservation a day or two earlier. Impromptu jigs are also entertained, but they seem to favour reservations. We already booked a table and it just took a call on the numbers available. They confirmed the reservation a day earlier. The look and feel inside was homely yet not mundane. We ordered our drinks, boys got VAT 69 and we got the sweet lime soda which was really refreshing and a must if you want your fill of the starters. The starters were brought in and boy was it good! Prawn golden fry won my heart just at the sight and when I tasted it, I was a goner! Chicken skewers were good too, mutton was average and so the veg starters too, won't sweep you off your feet neither warrants a reproach. The main course was also good. Chicken Biriyani, afghani chicken, the salads, fish and mutton, I tasted them all, I liked them all. The desserts in this place are speciality and the best of all is the angoori gulab jamun! I have a really weird style of eating hot gulab jamun. I take ice cream and hot gulab jamun and eat them together. I don't remember how many I ate, but I was almost bursting at the seams. When I thought I couldn't eat anymore, I was pulled in to the live kulfi counter and BANG! They drove the dagger home with their utterly delicious pan kulfi! Pan kulfi and angori gulab jamun alone can be the motivation to visit the place again and again.
Lastly barbeque nation has been reviewed to be the best buffet in town. Well lets just say they do full justice to the praises they have been so wholly showered with!

This place needs no introduction. It's probably the best place to enjoy a quality buffet lunch with your friends and family. I have been here several times but it's a bit difficult to get a booking during festive season (I had to book a month in advance for new year's day last year! Didn't got a place at their park street outlet!)...I guess this explains its huge popularity! Coming over to food, the skewers were all amazing, followed by all the dishes in their main course. The desserts were also awesome. This place never fails you!

So finally after long wait me with my bf and other two friends reached here tomorrow for my birthday celebration .. First of all the management is really amazing .. They are helpful enough to hold out reservation upto 12.20 though we booked 12 pm slot .

Then as soon as we entered being a birthday girl I was wished by the person in reception . Then after reaching our table we was introduced to the person who is going to help us that day .

And then came the foods .
As starters we served paneer kabeb , potato kabeb , chicken , fish , parwn , mashroom kabeb , chrispy corn , chicken popcorn , mutton Sikh , barbecue chicken wings .. The starters are as usual amazing .. But the mutton and fish kabeb need some special mention . My bf who never liked fish and mutton , he also loved them . The corns were just amazing . But I somehow didn't like the mashroom one .. The service was just fabulous . We never need to wait for anything .. After eating our heart content we put our flags down and moved towards main course .

In main course that day they offered two types of soup , salad , some veg times , paneer pasinda , Andhra Palau , chicken biriyani , Lal mash , plain rice , sharshe Mach , chicken curry , egg manturian and egg rice .
I personally felt the main courses were not that bad besides we were full to eat more . Still we tried them and yes the biriyani is really amazing . A bit light for our tastebuds but still we love it . The mutton were slightly undercooked . The paneer pasinda were amazing . But the egg items need the special attention . They were just yam !! The egg fried rice and the egg manturian . The egg manturian is just too tempting .

After we finished our main course , as per the tradition they gave us a complimentary birthday cake and wished and sang for me ... Their this gesture was really heart touching .

Then came the desert part with firni , pudding , pineapple upside down , 4 types of pastry , ice cream , fruit tart , angoori golap jamun and chocolate brown eyes . I was never find of sweets . But still the angoori golap jamun win my heart . I couldn't able to stop myself from having them in lots . The cakes were as usual amazing . I specially liked their pudding very much .

Atleast came their koolfi part . They were amazing show stoppers. The pan , malai, chocolate koolfies were fab .

Not but not the least pocket pinch . And this part surprised me . We only coasted 691 perhead . In place if 850 . As for booking from app I already got a discount of 150 and then for early bird offer it reduced more . So finally we ended up paying 691 for each.

And finally I am very satisfied with barbecue nation .. Be it food , the waiters or management . They are best and I will definitely visit the place again .

.And finally thank you team Barbeque Nation for making my birthday lunch amazing ..

This place can never go wrong . Been to this outlet for the first time last Thursday and had a pleasant experience . 

The ambience was beautiful here too üíì. 

As usual , the skewers were amazing , from fish to prawns to those chicken wings üòç. Fried corn is a must have . 
Main course was good too with lots of variety in salads and staples. 

Finally the dessert counter - The best desserts ever . My picks would be chocolate mudpie , cheesecake , firni , pastries üòçüòç. 

Impeccable service leaves a lasting impact üëå.

Anything below 5 star is rare for this place, and rightly so. Best place for barbeques in Kolkata - hands down. Will definitely refer this place to all chicken lovers. Just a tip : Go easy on the complimentary drink, only the first glass is complementary. Also the place is pretty famous for its deserts too. Any big group meet-up, definitely go for this. This is tailor-made for group meetings and reunions.

I have visited this place 3-4 times. But few week ago We have gone there for our office team lunch, around 50 people.
Starting from welcome drinks. They offered 3-4 kind of welcome drinks. Sweet lime soda, amm panna, beer also.


Starter : 2 type of chicken kabab. 1 prown , one chicken wing and leg, 1 mutton kabab, potato kabab, variety of veg kabab also there.
Rate 4.5/5

Main course: Chicken biriyani, white rice, egg fried rice, hakka noodles, one mutton dish, egg patiala, shoshe fish. Manchurian chicken
Some veg item also there.
But there main course not too good. Biriyani is no so good. But we have requested to make chilly chicken and rice for us, then chef came and took the order made the dishes according to our choice.

Rate: 3/5

Dessert : 

Rate: 4.5/5


One request please make some good biriyani & chicken dishes in main course.

This has to be my personal favorite in Kolkata when it comes to buffet food. BBQ Nation has maintained it's standards throughout. Starters are hands down my favourite. Mushrooms are to die for ‚ù§. There service is impeccable. Someone is always attending to your needs at all times. The pan flavoured kulfi is nice and refreshing to end a heavy meal on a very happy note.

Caution:
1. It may take 5 - 10 mins to decide what you should take from food-heap. The starter itself can fill you up, so plan properly.
2. After the decision is taken when you just dive in the table, you'll have to be tired from eating them.

This is the highest rated restaurant in the city for a Reason. The Ambience is very soothing and decent. Staffs are just amazing and they always behave professionally. Coming to the food part, the Starters and Desserts are Heaven but I don't like the Main Course here. But Dude, who needs the main course when you've got all kinds of Kebabs. ‚ù§Ô∏è 
I've been here multiple times and my experiences have been great. Strongly recommended for Kebab Lovers! :)

Visited this place the 4th time. The experience that I had in my last visit was not that great. I food is very good and very tasty. The starters are good. But the fact that I didn't like is  the prawns and chickens  served in the starters are not that great. Though I didn't face this on my previous visits. The mutton and fish was perfect but disappointed ¬†me with the prawn and chicken kebabs. The main course was good but the Biriyani can be much better. The waiters were good and served very well. The Kulfi section and person serving Kulfi is perfect. The dessert section is also good and very tasty. Tried a unique dish as "Panner Sholay" and that surprised me. It was very tasty and yummy. 

Over all very nice buffet and one the best buffet spread in town. They maintain a standard and but I was not that satisfied on my last visit. Any way One should go and enjoy the food.

But there is always a room for dessert ;) we tried almost all items in the desert..loved their malai kulfi preparations and gulab jamuns! I would like to go back their again and again..perfect place for all foodies üòÉ

Even though the main course isn't upto the mark but various starters will make your go WOW. Ambience is also nice and service is best in Kolkata. If you don't like any dish tell them and they will remake it according to your preference.

Must try grilled prawn, smoked potato (for veg people). If you go for buffet, then concentrate about starter and dessert. Main course is average in this place. And last but not in the list is "Paan flavoured kulfi". A must try deasert, heavenly!!!

We had went to BBN salt lake last day from office with colleagues. We were utterly disappointed with the taste and quality of food. Starters for which BBN is famous were tasteless so was main course. Dessert was nice though as usual . I have been to same BBN saltlake thrice before twice in lunch and once in dinner .Every time we had nice food and we were happy. Last day experience surely showed their quality deterioration. behavior of staff was good as usual .kebabs sizes reduced to almost half of previous size,and taste wise very poor too... crispy chicken they served last day was very bad previously we had some spicy chicken wings when asked for those they said menu has changed. biriyani was heavily scented but not tasted good. pieces of mutton were not good and smelly too as if they were about to stale or mixed with stale. This was not at all expected from BBN. I hope the BBN management sees this and takes step to improve quality again atleast to the level which was there previously so that we can visit there again Other wise they may loose repeat footfall day by day .

This place comes with one of the best food and also one of the best service and hospitality in town. The unlimited buffet ticks off with complementary drinks and unlimited starters. The starters mainly include kebabs of both veg (mushroom, paneer and potato) and non veg (prawn, fish, chicken and mutton). They also serve tandoori chicken wings, American sweet corn and spider veg roll (a light spicy ball wrapped with fried noodles). The main course changes from time to time including delicious veg and non veg dishes. Lastly, the desserts are nothing short of heaven - be it the cakes or the kulfis. The angoori gulab jamun are indeed a treat to the eyes and taste buds.
Apart from the lip smacking food, their service and hospitality are quite praiseworthy. If you have a birthday or anniversary, don't hesitate to convey it to them. They will celebrate it with a cake to make the day extra special. Also, if you have problem with any food item, the chef will take suggestions and cook customised dish just for you.

Starters - kebabs , kebabs and only kebabs, though the chkn wings need a special mention, they were superb. 
Now coming to the main course , was a bit disappointed. Quality of food was not up to the mark. Specially the fish curry.
Desserts- nothing to say , out of this world. 
Overall a nice experience .

We went there for dinner in early bird offer... Ambience was good... Starters were mouth watering specially the golden fried prawn... Fish kebabs were bland... we told them about that... after that they served us most delicious fish kebab i ever had... main course was not to the upto mark... Though Malai kofta and  mutton roganjosh was quite tasty... then the dessert... Every item was just perfect... Hot gulabjamun to Paan kulfi... all items were pleasure to eat... stuffs are good...

Ambience:Very soothing and decent.
Staffs:One of d most important reason why everyone loves this place.They r very much friendly attentive n generous.
Food:coming to food part.They have the best variety of deserts n kulfi .Specially their pan kulfi,chocolate kulfi n Gulab jamun are jst awesome.They will surely blow ur mind.
Now d barbeque part.Its very unique to see live grills on table with dips of ur choice.Prawn kebab n chicken kebab tasted nice.Although not d best .You could find btr kebab elsewhere.Mutton  n fishkabab tasted absolutely yum.Although I personally think all the kebabs could hv been more tender n soft.Main course z not worth a mention.Biriyani n chicken butter masala was not at all good.
Overall a very good restaurant.Unlimited food at such affordable place.Although they hv some errors but after the whole meal You will be very much satisfied with the dining experience.A must visit for all meat lovers.

Wanted to visit this place for long. Finally was able to check in today. Undoubtedly the best buffet in town! You hardly gulp a plateful and there's a re-serve. I had the whole course of starters repeated so many times and the team seemed more than happy serving them asking if we needed more time to time. The fish and prawns were just tooooo good. The chicken and mutton kebabs were delicious as well. The main course had nothing fancy and the taste was below par.
And the desserts!!! OH MY GODDDD!! The butterscotch cheesecake was just a heavenly pleasure! The pan flavoured kulfi was out of the world (I can still enjoy 5 more kulfis after having 5 of them and right now I am almost full to my throat)!
To sum it up, a great experience and if u want to eat and eat and eat and continue eating against a limited amount of money this place is probably heaven for u. And for people who would enjoy drinking beer along with food u can hop in here!

The Kebabs, spicy Potato stuffs,sweet corn fry these are just too much.I wouldn't prefer the main course too much. But the dessert which they provide that are awesome,specially the Pan Kulfi.

What a place this is in just the centre of hard working people's society.. went there with office team today and was delighted with the ambiance firstly, then then started serving starters  and which were just too good in taste. Gradually they served a total of 18 dishes in a buffet and each and every one of them were delicious.. Finally they provide us with a team pic, well framed and escorted us with wonderful gestures. Wish to be here more and more .

One of my favourite places of all time. The buffet is 1500+ for two and the food is perfect. The staff behaviour is absolutely top-notch. I have been here 6-7 times, once through a reservation via their app. The manager does rounds of all tables after each course and if something isn't up to your liking, they'll change it for you.

The heart of those who can eat like hell. ‚ù§

Yessssssss!

830 bucks and eat as much as you want (with tax).

Starters : 4/5

Main course : 2.2/5

Desserts : 5/5

The road side Biriyani sellers sale better BIRIYANI.

Egg Friedrice? Average.

Chili chicken? Too bad. Totally disappointed. :'(

Mutton kosha? May be your maid cooks thousand times better.

But the starters? Aah, if I was supposed to be known that the main course will be that bad, I would eat more and more starters and fulfill my soul with them.

All kind of kebabs? On point. Yeah. ‚ù§

And finally, the desserts. They are Heaven. :)
Kulfi : Excellent
Pastries : Fabulous
Ice-cream & Firni : Aaah, life.

There is a reason that this restaurant is so highly rated. There is a reason I have rated it 5 star. The reason is that it‚Äôs not only about quality of food, ambiance, and service, but it‚Äôs about experience. This experience comes with a heavy price tag. Just hope everyone can afford to visit this place, at least once.

Well I believe this place doesn't need any review. Been visiting here since 2011. It's amaze me every time.I visited all the branches in bangalore and sector 5 branch in kolkata. The staffs are always extremely efficient, welcoming and friendly.

we were served with the starter on and off the grill which were very fresh and full of flavours.. now coming to the main course they had a lot of options, must try the fried corn in starters. coming to dessert i think they server the best dessert options in town.

I will strongly recommend all to give this place one try, then no need to check any reviews.

Happy food hunting,, happy tummy.... :)

For beginners, Barbeque Nation is a Bangalore based restaurant chain with pan India presence. In Kolkata, it has only 2 outlets with the first one in salt lake sector 5 area. The only reason why it's so highly rated is because it actually doesn't have much competition here, unfortunate for people of Kolkata. The food is undoubtedly very nice with kebabs stealing the show. By far the best buffet experience in town

Good restaurant.  Aswm food. Very good service. I would like to write about a chef,  I don't really know his name.  He is very politely ask me,  how is the stater mam. I said everything's are good except the fish kebab. He asked what should I improve in that fish kebab.  I said I don't have any specifications but I don't like it.  Then he weld to the kitchen and serve a different type of fish kebab after 10-15 min. Frankly telling I didn't like that either.  So I said I don't like it.  He asked what should we do to make it better.  I get irritated I told him. I think I don't like fish. That was a lie. Actually I love fish. Then that determined chef went to the kitchen and made a difference type of fish which was very delicious. So in shorts the best part of barbecue nation is their service. 
One suggestion,  please serve some different types of food. The taste and food was very regular. Please change the menu so that we could visit this place over and over again.

This was my first time visiting BBQ Nation and after all the reviews I had been reading, I had bigger expectations from the place. I am going to get right into what we were served.

In starters: Barbequed paneer, mushrooms, and potato were just too pale. Chicken kabab was good. So was fish. Crispy prawns were decent. Chicken wings were very nice. Fried corns were just lovely. Potato with some kind of sauce (or Mayo) was the best. Seekh kababs were alright.

Main course: Biryani didn't feel like biryani. Mutton Gravy was the worst. It was like boiled piece if meat with an equally tasteless gravy. Dal Makhani was beautiful. Nan was average. Mixed vegetables were very tasty. Chicken Afghani ( I think) was undercooked. I was a little surprised seeing Chinese on the menu. And, chow mein was the best. Oh just perfect!

For dessert: Kulfi, phirni, white forest cake, chocolate cake, gulab jamun, ice cream, fruits were all just fine. But, the worst item of my meal was mango cheesecake. Awful! Eh!

Ambience: Above average. A little more space to move would be appreciated.

Service: Excellent. The waiters should get a raise. Haha.

Overall: From clean washrooms, to very friendly attendants, to mouth watering starters to the sloppy cheesecake, this place still deserves the credit it holds. Highly recommend at least once.

Heard a lot about this place. And finally went there for office lunch, with Boss and 2 of my colleagues.
Ambience was nice! Staffs were really good at service.
Now the main part, the Food! I mean, the starters, what can I say?? Heaven!
Chicken Kebabs, Prawn Kebabs, Mutton Kebabs all were just yummmmmy!! All 4 of us almost spent 2hours only having starters!! üò±

Then the main menu..
Fish items were good! Meat items were so so.
Desserts were just yumm!!
But what I loved the most was the Live Kulfi Counter. The lady who was serving there was so nice and humble! Her way of serving was truly recommendable!!

Looking forward to visit this place again.

While people keep talking about allegedly "good" buffets in town, I just want to scream at them, "People, there is only one buffet in town which is worthy of a standing ovation, and that's none other than barbeque nation." Mesmerised everytime I come here. It's probably the hardest job in the world to keep track of whatever u eat at this place because the restaurant offers such an exquisite plethora of food items, but I have done my best in this review. First things first, to the food then.
The starters have always been the highlight at bbq nation. I literally go there just to keep crunching and munching on that perfect corn. The highlights of the starters today were the golden prawns and most importantly, the Lebanese fish. It was hands down, the best fish I have ever tasted. Mutton mirch masala seekh, kasturi murgh tikka and Hyderabadi wings were the other items. Each was beautifully prepared. If I were splitting hairs, I would say the kasturi murgh could be more flavoursome.
To the mains, I would jot down my favourites, namely chilli garlic noodles, chicken dum biriyani and kashmiri mutton roganjosh. The afghani chicken curry and aloo dum achari were also quite good. The roganjosh is a must tryüòá
Finally to the desserts, well, what shall I say, maybe the best spread out there for sweet tooths. Tried every item, and each was pitch perfect. The angoori gulab jamun was my favourite. The ice cream and kulfis were delectable as usual. The kulfi stall is the reason for which I can go back again and again to this place. The watermelons were fresh and crisp. Am a bit disappointed with the mango cheescake though. Would have been happier to have a blueberry flavoured one on the menu instead, as I am a lover of classics.
And last but not the least, to anyone who is reading my review, I would say, we can get good food at quite a few places in the city of joy, but barbeque nation has the best staff the city has to offer. What mindblowing service!! On complaining that the chilli garlic noodles were a bit cold, they again offered me freshly prepared hot noodles. We were asked quite a few times if there was any item we would like to change, were asked for suggestions on how they could improve their quality and they did everything in their power to make our evening a memorable one. Kudos, team barbeque. U deserve special mention. As for the ambience, the place has one of the best ambiances for a nice family dinner. As for the price, while some may complain it is a bit upscale, I think it is absolutely reasonable vis-a-vis the quality and variety of food they serve. Lovely evening at barbeque nation. Dying to visit again...üòáüòá

If asks me for suggestions for scope of improvement for this joint...I would say NONE. Awesome starters(best among all buffets in Kolkata in my opinion). I personally visit this place for starters and deserts. Love the sizzling kebabs and prawns. Wonderful service also. They have a live kulfi counter with various flavors. A frequent place for team lunches. 

One word of caution...better book a table(and that too a few days advance).

Last Saturday i went to Bbq nations for the first time with my niece for her birthday with my sister after terrific reviews by my friends & my office collegues. 
The first thing which i like most are the staffs who are very friendly & polite n they helped us abt every food as we dont know abt the food.
The food whether that is starter or main course or the desserts are excellent. May be more than that I hope that day will be memorable for my niece as well as she gt a birthday cake & cheered by the staff at the end of the dinner.
Overall the ambience all the staffs & certainly the food in one word are all awesome.
Thank you BBQ Nations. Keep this service always like this & make all the customers face happy with your food & service.

Best buffet in town or crown jewel of Sector 5..Call it whatever you may, but one thing is guaranteed that you cannot leave BBQ Nation without either your stomach full to the brim or your taste buds un satisfied..People in Sector 5 literally try to find alibis to pay a visit to BBQN! It always boasted a variety of A-one starters be it fish,prawn,chicken,mutton or even veg..Not even the bitterest of the critics would beg to differ on that(i guess)! Kudos to the chef for keeping the meat well cooked yet succulent and the fish juicy and tender.. I simply adore (and devour on!) the prawn , mutton sheekh kebab  and the fish kebab they serve.. A significant improvement has been done on the main course and the desserts sections which have improved in leaps and bounds..And who can forget the Paan they serve which should make even your ever cringy boss satisfied with an oomph . So if you want to make the most of your friday evenings or get togethers and you are located at Sector 5 , i guess a palate of exceptional starters with a drink or two amidst live performances awaits you at the BBQNation..
P.S. Forgot to mention about the valet parking for foodies with four wheelers..‚ò∫

Barbeque and buffet, perfect reckoning for foodies. BBQ nation salt lake upholds the brand name. The range of starters are exquisite as usual, main course could have been more attractive..anyways it's for the starters that one visits this joint and you shouldn't mind skipping the mains to the desert if you are full after the flowing starters(which happens very oftenüòã) the drinks are affordable if you want a tipsy edge to your lunch/dinner. Keep it up. Will visit again.

A place not for the people who love to eat and can enjoy food to the fullest. A place that can only be enjoyed by the people with large appetite and fondness for superb taste for kebabs. The main course and the desserts are also nice as well as the varieties of kulfis that one can hope to have. The best part, you can try all the food you want and you would still want to come back as often as possible. Getting a public transportation is a bit hard compared to other places. But that's why you have online can services.

I visited barbeque nation with my family on the occasion of my mother's birthday. We had booked a table for 9:30pm. However we reached at 9pm and were given a table within 5 minutes. The staff was courteous and efficient. The place was pretty crowded but the ambience was very good mainly due to the lighting and music. The food was lip smacking. Special mention for the cajun spicy potatoes and the paan kulfi. There was a lot of variety in starters, main course and dessert. Overall the experience was wonderful. Will definitely visit again.

Finally a tick to this restaurant from my bucket list... This Sunday I visited this place with my family, we had a wait for sometime due to Sunday rush then we were seated... the ambience was awesome though it was very crowded.. the staff were extremely efficient, welcoming and friendly.. we were served with the starter on and off the grill which were very  fresh and full of flavours.. now coming to the main course they had a lot of options.. I literally tasted all the food there I loved there dishes not to experimented normal food with  great taste cooked to perfection... now coming to dessert I loved all of them there wasnt any space still craved for more to taste.. the best were gulab jamun with ice cream and chocolate sauce... it tastes incredible the hot gulab jamun with cold vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce is literally trip to heaven.. only off was the blueberry cheese cake.. it was simply a no for me... I had best ones before this was nothing close... 
And finally settling with bill I was less than what I thought it would be.. it was overall  a great experience. Awesome food.. lovely staff u will just love to be there... highly recommended üòäüòÅ keep up bab nation...

This outlet attracts the office goers and if you are looking for a team get together, better book early.
We tried the lunch buffet. The non-veg starters were basic (chicken kebabs, mutton kebabs, prawns, fish) and good. My friend (vegetarian) was disappointed that the veg starters count had got reduced. 
In the main course, the spread is good (worth mentioning: chef special chilli chicken). Was a tad sad when I found that the mutton had only bony pieces.
Dessert section had the brownies and mini-tarts. But the kulfis clearly go the heart (tried the famous pan kulfi).
If you want to hog and bond at the same time, give this place a definite visit!

Was there today for lunch. Was a sudden plan. Didn't hope to get table during rush hours, but the manager was courteous enough to get us a table within 15mins. Nothing more to say about the food, it's awesome as always! Being here is a treat to our taste buds always! Keep up the amazing work!

The highest rated restaurant in the city, offering possibly the best buffet, Barbeque Nation truly lives up to its expectations! :):)

Visited it on the occasion of my father's birthday for the Early Bird.
Ambiance and decor is nice and decent with little kitsches sitting pretty in corners.

For starter, we were offered fresh lime soda, and Grilled Jerk Chicken, Mai Thai Fish, Chermoula Prawns, Mutton Chapli Kebab and Thai B.B.Q Chicken Wings in skewers on the live grill at our table, along with Cajun Spicy Potato and Sweet Corn.

For the main course we took Paneer Siya Mirch (which we had with the soft naan offered in a basket), Plain Rice, Dal, Potato Wedges, Veg Hakka Noodles, Veg Dumpling in Hot Garlic Sauce, Chicken Dum Biryani, and Mutton Dak Bungalow.

Our dessert consisted of Angoori Gulab Jamun, Chocolate Brownie, Mix Fruit Tart, Butterscotch Pastry, Pudding, Jamun Cheesecake, and Kulfi from the live kulfi counter.

All the items were scrumptious, lip-smacking and perfectly cooked, and too good to taste. Personally I liked the mutton kebab, paneer and gulab jamun the best. 

Servers were extremely efficient, polite and courteous who kept on inquiring about our gastronomic experience after each course, including the Chef himself.

Their food is extremely delicious leaving foodies craving for more. Overall I recommend their all-you-can-eat buffet for an awesome culinary experience!

Visited this heaven for gluttons yesterday evening.(Missed it on previous Sunday lunch.) Its being Tuesday evening the rush was less. But there was a downside also. (No complimentary drinks with dinner buffet ) The kebab platter is legendary, nothing to add here. Nothing grand in the main dishes, you can easily skip it if you can hold your barbeque flag for long!! The kulfi counter is still churning out its old magic with malai and pan kulfi ruling the roost. We ordered one thumbs up (300ml),they charged us 90 bucks, that was the only sour point. Other wise it is all ship shape.
P. S: don't order for anything extra while enjoying buffet it will burn your pocket for sure!! And yeah we missed the live pasta counter due to our seat allocation. Dont miss that, and do tell me how it is!!

Recently went through an awesome experience. Lunch in Barbeque Nation is always special for me. Ambience of the Restaurant is good, staffs are very co-operative.
Now coming to food¬† They still hold the same beauty inside.. with the burning charcoal kebab grill on the center of each wooden table.
Anyone can't think beyond buffet when visiting BBQ Nation. There is a reason behind it. The Well spread -Starters, the main course, the live kulfi counter, Paneer Pudina Tikka, Spiced Potato, Hara kebab, mushroom, We tried paan, strawberry and malai kulfi with customized toppings. I loved the paan and malai kulfis. Other dessert items were okay but the Mango cheesecake is the worst variant of dessert I had in my life. That is simply not cheesecake - it is a crime to even call it that.
the special arrangement for any special occasion is Amazing. Hospitality is always a point to talk when it comes to BBQ nation, are well behaved and professional.

You basically review Barbeque Nation just for the sake of reviewing beacuse this is the BEST buffet in town! Hands down !!
Starting from the food on the grill ending in the kulfi the whole thing is an experience. Just go there and stuff yourself with freshly barbequed prawn, fish, chicken, mutton. They serve you with a complementary drink and a cake (for a special occassion).
The main course has delicious biriyani, mutton, fish, egg and what not. Lastly comes the dessert with anguri gulabjamun,ice creams, cakes,custards and specially the kulfi with a variety of flavours. Please do try the pan kulfi , I bet you have not had this kulfi anywhere else.

Okay!! Okay!! So it comes down to this....now i wil have to write a review about BBQ Nation. Seriously?? OH Cmon!!

The name BBQ nation is a common household name these days. Mainly famous for its fabulous, and extraordinary buffets at such an affordable price is really unbelievable and unmatched.

Visited this place for several occasions, team lunch, with friends, with my girlfriend and also with my family. I cant get enough of this place.


Food quality?  Man!! Its the best...the ambience? Its the best....the service...its the best....

But i would personally suggest the lunch buffet, since its cost effective. ;) 
(I'm always looking at you pocket guys, dont worry.)


Verdict : The best buffet place in town. 

Note : Predominantly nonveg. Be careful. Hahah..

Soumen rating:-

Man!! Its a 5/5 for everything.

Happy food hunting ..... :)

It's my first visit to this place, we went for lunch....just loved everything about this place ..the decor, ambience, superaweome starters, main course and heavenly desserts!!

Even being a pure vegeterian , I enjoyed the variety of starters they served us...Cajun spice potato was really amazing!A bread cheese pakora which was folded like chicken was really innovative for us!!And the live grill ..nothing to say about it ..paneer tikka, pineapple,watermelon,mushrooms, baby potato!
The mocktails were also just perfect!

The main course tasted nice ....just variety was less as compared to starters! Biriyani was really good! Best thing about main course that they were servings bread of your choice as per your request . The service was quick and prompt!

Desserts....just loved them! Will b there again only for the desserts....loved the experiment with kulfis! No pics of kulfi...as they were so tempting...that we finished it before one could take a pic!üòÇüòÇ

After Park Street, it was time to visit their branch at  Sector 5. Things were quite the same here too. The awesome ambience, lively, buzzing with happiness... Waiters were noticed to actively participate in birthday occasions, singing for the customers. They prepared special cakes in no time for the B'day celebration.
Food was as good, and the never-ending servings of starters, the live kulfi counter and assorted dessert, all were typical of BBQ Nation .
I found this branch to be somewhat better than the Park Street one, as the waiters were jolly and the management was keen in taking feedback. Way to go!!

Highest rated restaurant known for its buffet. The burning charcoal kebab grill on the center of each wooden table serving unlimited variety of kebabs which steal the show. Main course consists of chicken biryani, veg chow, veg manchurian, shorshe mach, amritsari egg curry, papad, salad and many more. Now coming to the dessert which includes phirni, kulfi, fruit custard, pastries, ice creams with choice of sauce which tastes heavenly and the best part of the buffet. Highly recommended.

The starter's were finger licking delicious and then went to main course and they leave no stone unturned to make your tummy feel great..and then came the best part.. the Dessert Storm which is quite a worthy thing.
All in all I'm eagerly waiting to visit this again..

The food quality and service has deteriated. Been here after a year with office team. The AC doesn't work properly and after asking the staff to look at it getting  a response like we cant help ac is like that only is not proffessional. The quality of food has also gone down. The only good thing happened was the sweet corn. It was yummy like anything & the service from a staff named gopal who was looking after the peoplel having vegetarian food. I would suggest they need to learn from the park street branch because they carry the name of a brand. Because of few people and their service the entire restaurant should not take a hit on the reviews.

My experience at Barbeque Nation, Salt Lake was a refreshing change from the usual restaurant outings. 
Firstly the food was consistently fresh and the flavors were amazing. 
Secondly and most importantly the service staff was courteous and very different from what we experience at other restaurants nowadays. 
We were not served. We were 'fed'! 
It literally felt like we were guests in their house. 

Special thumbs up to the gentleman at the desk, Mohit and the gentleman who served us Mr. Prosenjit. 
We will be back soon for sure!

Finally had a chance to visit the highest rated restaurant in Zomato. Went there for a lunch buffet. The starters were mind blowing. Everything was so flavourful that it felt like a party in my mouth. We were served chicken wings, curry leaves chicken, gandharaj fish, prawn, sweet corn, Cajun potato. Coming to the main course, the soup wasn't chicken dumpling soup as it was written. The fish in mustard fish could have been of better quality. Other items were more or less good. The brownie in dessert was very disappointing. The sugar wasn't crushed properly and it was too sweet. I didn't try any other dessert item. But heard from others that kulfi was good. Service‚Äã was prompt and staffs were very courteous. I would love to go back and try the food again.Aniket Mallick

I'd have given a 5 if the food quality was as good as it was before. I won't say the food is bad, it is really good. The ambience was nice and especially the courteous behavior of the staffs. But I felt that the food quality has gone down a bit than before...maybe that's because it is very popular now a days and it normally is packed up.

And finally, a suggestion for those who want to go in a large groups, reserve a table, or you might have to wait for a long time.

People say this is one of the best buffets in the city. I couldn't agree more! I don't have words to explain how much I love the starters! They say the main course isn't good enough. I wouldn't agree to that. I would say it's good, but nothing great maybe and I'm actually thankful that the main course is nothing extraordinary because after having so much of starters, I can only accommodate the desserts! And the desserts are simply amazing, i love the flavoured kulfies among all other desserts. I would definitely urge you to please visit this place once at least because it's really worth it!

There is a reason, plain and simple, why this is the highest rated restaurant here. 
Because their food tingles the taste buds with their proper notes. Amazing food, good ambience, loads of options, reasonably priced! 

I get angry at myself, when I tend to revisit this place often! üòÇ

You could never go wrong with their buffet. Remember to mix-up the veg and non-vegetarian items. Vegetarian items like pineapple kebab, sweet corn tastes fabulous. Prawn kebab tastes best among the non-veg items. 

I usually try to skip the main course and fill myself up with starters. Remember to try the desserts, especially their multiflavored kulfis! 

Highly recommended!!!

The food was great. They really do know how to please customers. I was having trouble with the mutton kebab and when they asked me whether I liked it or not, I gave my feedback and they changed it and bought a whole new preparation of mutton. All the starters are mouth watering but the main course needs improvement. The quality must improve. The variety of desert is really good. And the amazing amount of flavours of kulfi is amazing and tasty.

Have been there multiple times. This was just yesterday for our parents anniversary. Booked a table in advance through their toll free 1800 number. Soon after received confirmation on my mobile.

They still hold the same beauty inside.. with the burning charcoal kebab grill on the center of each wooden table. People can't think beyond buffet when visiting BBQ Nation. There is a reason behind it. The spread - the starters, the main course, the live kulfi counter, the special arrangement for any special occasion is out of the world. Waiters and chefs are well behaved and professional.

Coming to the food, their starters steal the show. Famous for the unlimited multiple variety of kebabs including chicken, fish, prawns, batter coated corn kernal chat, chicken wings, paneer, mushroom, aalu, mutton, pineapple and few more. With a choice of welcome drink of aam panna, fresh lime, ice tea and beer. Main course consists of veg chow, veg manchurian, chicken biriyani, gosht bahari, shorshe mach, amritsari egg curry, baked corn and spinach, papad, salad, achar and few more. Now coming to the dessert spread.. which includes precisely phirni, fruit custard, white forest pastry, choco truffle cake, simai barfi, tarts, mini gulab jamuns (BBQ Speciality), ice creams with choice of sauce.. fresh fruits and last but not the least live counters of flavoured kulfis.. including mango, kesar pesta, strawberry and very authentic and innovative pan (try only if you like pan)..

Now after these oh so delicious and heavenly spread.. they took a special effort to surprise the couple with a complimentary Happy Anniversary cake and also made it special by clicking our photo together with the cake in their camera and printed and framed it with their paper board ready memento frames and gifted us to keep it as a sweet memory..

Not sure how long we can keep the photo intact.. however.. the memories will stay for ever...... we are Touched by their hospotality and super impressed with their spread.

One piece of advise to BBQ Nation from me : It's difficult to reach the top.... It's more difficult to be there at the top among others in the rat race. Best of Luck. Don't give a chance to complain.

although a vegetarian, i loved this place..
i have never been to a restaurant with buffet system.. so the team lunch gave me the opportunity to be here once..
they distinguish the vegetarians within the non-vegetarians by serving green labeled plate..
the starters were just up to the mark.. hot grilled Paneer, Corn, Mushroom all were beyond my expectations.. several options for the main course as well.. Veg Biriyani, Peas Pulao, Nun, Daal Makhani, Gobi Masala, Malai Kofta, Paneer Butter Masala, Achari Aloo were few.. there were a huge variety of desserts as well to choose from.. from Cakes to Ice-creams to Sweets to Kulfis..
nothing can beat the buffet system of this famous joint of Sector V..
the service is good as well.. abundant waiters.. so no negligence at all..
special bonus is the music played..
a great option for all Non-Vegans especially..

Barbeque Nation is the most sought after restaurant in Sector V owing to its popularity and a decent spread. Largely frequented by office groups for team lunch and dinners this restaurant needs no introduction. I have been to this restaurant several times over the last few years and returned few days ago for a team dinner.¬†

Barbeque nation was the obvious choice as the spread offers good number of veg and non veg options to satiate one's taste buds and hunger.¬†

The buffet kicks off with starters served right on your table on a portable grill that is setup by the waiters. Starters included Paneer Pudina Tikka, Spiced Potato, Hara kebab, mushroom, Masala fish, Prawns, Chicken kebabs, Mutton Sheekh kebab, Tandoori Tangri Chicken and a couple of more veg items. They were also serving some veg signature dish and golden sweet corn. To be honest except the Tandoori Tangri chicken and Veg Hara kebab, I found all the other starters very average to taste and bland. The prawns were definitely under cooked and the mushrooms were a disaster. ¬†On mentioning that the chef did customize a couple of starters for us but it was nothing exceptional. I was thoroughly disappointed. BBQ Nation really needs to reinvent themselves and introduce some innovative dishes if they want repeat customers. ¬†

The salad section was good. I liked their chicken salad which was fresh and tasty. Moving on to the main course I tried the Chicken Biryani, Butter Chicken and Laal Maas. Biryani and butter chicken were again average to taste - I was not even expecting a miracle here as BBQ Nation main course has been average from its very inception. Laal Maas (mutton) was nothing fancy - a mutton curry preparation which was simple and paired well with the Biryani/Naan.

They even have a jhaal muri/Pav bhaji counter. Pav Bhaji was okay, did not try the jhaal muri.¬†

Their dessert section had several options to try from. There were three separate sections comprising of Ice cream, mini gulab jamuns, a kulfi counter, fresh cut fruits with mango cheesecake, firni and a couple of more items to satisfy one's sweet tooth.¬†
The kulfi counter is definitely a hit ! We tried paan, strawberry and malai kulfi with customized toppings. I loved the paan and malai kulfis. Other dessert items were okay but the Mango cheesecake is the worst variant of dessert I had in my life. That is simply not cheesecake - it is a crime to even call it that.¬†

Conclusion ¬†- As mentioned earlier BBQ nation needs to work hard on the starters section and bring in some refreshing change. Also another thing I noticed is the quality of service. I am not complaining about late service but the etiquette. Some of the waiters try to push certain items on to your plate even if you dont want it. They try to serve it before you can say a NO. These are the basics in the hospitality/restaurant industry.¬†

Even with these flaws BBQ Nation will remain as one of the top picks for office outings, but I will not recommend the restaurant unless they refresh their menu with some new items.

The service has degraded quite drastically to my utter surprise....the prawns were a bit too spicy..I had ordered a fresh lime soda which never arrived to my utter surprise..the service staff had to be requested multiple times for various starters...Overall it was quite a disappointing experience...

Had been planning to visit it since ages. I heard that the Park Street outlet doesn't have the bbq on the table, so we opted for the Salt Lake one. (correct me if I'm wrong). The ambience was very amiable, the chefs and the servers were polite enough to describe us their way of serving more than once. The kebabs were delicious. Best I had till date. But remember to put the flag down and don't get your tummy full already, because the main courses and the desserts would be a marvellous treat. The Mutton Vindaloo was juicy and tender and the Biryani just tasted like heaven. The buffet options are innumerable, the desserts being my favourite. From kulfis to freshly cut fruits, overall I had a very hearty meal. 

P.S: If you prefer quantity over quality, then BbqN would be perfect for you. Those of you who have a smaller appetite, the menu may seem a bit pricey.

Best buffet in town. I visit this place twice and I am in love with this place. Food food and only food!!! Starter is amazing including chicken, fish, prawn, mutton kababs , chicken tengri kabab and many more. And deserts are mouth watering. So much variety and too good quality. Best part is the kulfi counter. I loved it most.

Amazing food, great staff ,the starters and the desserts were the most interesting to me. In the main course biryani was my go to dish and it was really good .A few other side dishes‚Äã were equally good.
In the starters the fish and prawn were amazing and corn kernels fried in some batter was amazing too. I would rate the food 4.5 but I rated it 5 as a whole because of the great experience I had there.
The ambience is alright, it's a little crowded at times but again that's a good sign for a restaurant.

What can I say about Barbeque Nation! Food food and only food! They have the largest variation of starters and desserts. In case of main course they have quite a spread. I felt that after having good 10-15 starters it is impossible to have any thing else. So, I didn't consider the limited main course option. 
Staffs were really attentive, they kept adding starters in our table. Food was fresh and satisfying. According to me this is city's one of the finest place to avail a buffet.
**Go and try.

Get in and eat to your heart's content. That sums up the experience here.
Along with the welcome drinks the 'starters' start arriving. And they keep on arriving until you give in to the limits of your appetite. Fresh and delicious, there is always something new to try every few days.
Staff are always at hand in case you are still in the mood to complain about anything. Usually a complaint is addrssed with the same/complimentary dish served fresh.
Pro tip: Focus on the entrees and the desserts.

Definitely lost focus

My relatives ....me-- everyone facing their arogance nowadays.....they ask to come every guest at sharp 12 noon, or else booking will be cancelled! And they did that upon coming to one of my acquaintance.... Can you imagine that they belong to service sector!!! And they couldn't explain what the harm in coming one member late since he/ she has to pay full and has to leave by their slot time.

... unfortunately we had to shift focus to Mr Anjan Chatterjee's Speciality group chain,ie, Mainland China , Sigree etc. Here you don't get those red eyes.
And spent a noon whole.
Apart from this I really hate the concept of breaking up of dinner or lunch time into two time slots. If one has only zeroed in on Money making without prioritizing customers,the bzns will invariably gather bad reputation in course.
Hope BBQ management listen. Or else wl be perished ... without doubt..

Had organized a party for office colleagues on 14th April 2017, just before Bangali Nababarsha. Could not find a better place nearby to my office.

Starters: As usual, awesome. In fact I have always filled up my stomach with the kebabs each time I visited this place. This time, however, I had to keep some space for main course, for a change. Liked the prawn and chicken kebabs the most.

Main course: A wide variety was presented to us, which made the choice very difficult - which one to eat, which one to leave. From Biriyani, noodles to Mexican soup, it was endless. Liked the Biriyani and Rogan Josh a lot.

Dessert: If you have still space left, go for it. If you dont have, still go for it. Particularly the six kulfies. If you want to have one kulfi, go for the green variety (pan flavoured), its unique.

Ambience: Fantastic.

Hospitality and behaviour of stuff: The best.

Will definitely come back again. In fact it is the Numero Uno choice for any office lunch/dinner.

After heard a lot of mouth publicity me & my wife finally arrived at "Barbe'que Nation" to celebrate her Birthday Lunch.'Queue' is always there @Barbeque as per my understanding.So always step early.

We are informed at reception that we are in 'queue' and have to wait for 2 hrs.Following everybody me too nagging for early arrangement.Surprisingly the reception guy alot me the couple table within 30 minutes as he assured me early.

After hearing my first time visit one'of the crew member guide me the entire " kabab's " experience which I'm not going to share.I recommend everyone must have this mouthwatering experience.

Also surprisingly they arrange a birthday cake which assures our  pleasing loyalty with repeat visit.Veggies also can enjoy with Veg. Concentrate on Kababs & desert despite of buffet main course.Also enjoy the complementary welcome drinks as well.

I had done my must try "Kabab Experience" with BBQ Nation with pleasing appetite.Thank you.

A good buffet place....

Food- There is no welcome drink for evening buffets...

Starters are excellent.... specially prawn kebab and chicken meethi malai kebab....

We are so full after starters that we are not much in the main course...

Tried mutton and it was horrible.. noodles was good.. chicken salad also..

Dessert was the best thing... Shshi tukda, cheese cake, gulabjamun, brownie and many other things...
You will gain a lot of calories.. but that does not matter to a foodie...

Ambience-  Ambience was good and service is also good...

A good experience....

The main course had the yummy biriyani. Best after Arsalaan. The dessert section has varieties ..recommended ones will be the chocolate brownies.. the firni.. the hot gulab jamuns..and do compelete your meal with the paan kulfi. I would visit again for such amazing dishes on the menu. Truly the best.

We went for their lunch buffet.
It was an awesome experience regarding the food and the prompt service. The surprise goodies for a special day.

The starters :

Chicken kebabs: this was the best according to me. They're juicy and tender.

Fish kebabs: these were soft and the aroma of the spices made it very heavenly.

Prawn kebabs: these were crispy and salty. Wonderful

Mutton seekh kebabs: these were being served by the waiters. And with the mint chutney it was superb.

Alu tikia: these were served with curd and churtneys. Sweet and sour in taste.

Sweet corn: these crispy fried corns.

Main course: they huge assortment of dishes that I don't remember the names. They tasted great.

Desserts:

Firni, lauki ka kheer, gulab jamun were among the sweetest.
There were brownies, cream rolls, ice creams etc
The kulfis which deserve a special mention. There were paan kulfis, chocolate kulfis, malai kulfis, Kesar pista kulfis, strawberry kulfis.

Barbecue nation is the ultimate foodie's destination... No matter what do give it a try.

Went there for the lunch buffet (non-veg) at 2.30pm. I heard a lot about the buffet so I was really looking forward to it but I was disappointed. One word - OVERRATED!

The starters were good but nothing made me go "wow". I liked the chicken wings. The skewers tasted good but not the very best.¬†

Main course - average. They have good options for people opting for Veg. I liked the Singapore noodles.

Desserts - average. I only liked the chocolate pie and the gulab jamuns. They have a live kulfi counter - tried out malai and chocolate kulfi. The malai one tasted good but I really didn't like the chocolate one.

Kudos to the staff! Very courteous servers.

The second best buffet restaurant for Indian food, in Kolkata. 
The starters are amazing and include prawn, fish, mutton and chicken kababs, grilled chicken wings, fried sweet corn (which trumps all other starters, even the non vegetarian ones) as well as potato, paneer and mushroom kababs. The starters are obviously the highlight of the meal.
The main course has a soup option along with Biryani (which is just average), a chicken, mutton and fish dish and assorted breads. There are similar options for the vegetarians too.
The dessert counter hasgulab jamuns, cheesecake, puddings, fruits, icecream and their speciality, the kulfi counter where you get six different types of kulfis with toppings according to your choice. It's simply heaven.

I will probably go back to this place again and again.
Loved it.

Ambience - 5/5
Food- 5/5
Service - 5/5.

Rating this place after my second visit. Just one visit is enough to know why it is rated so highly. A lot of options in starters, which is one of their main USPs, each of them delicious in their own way. I am specifically a fan of the Sweet Corn that they serve. Just brilliant. The main course has a lot of options too, but I have honestly not tasted much as I moved straight to the desserts. The desserts here are a must have too, specially the six different types of kulfis they serve. I can keep writing about the food, the space here shall fall short.
Coming to the service, I doubt I have seen more hospitable staff any where. With an ever present smile on their face, they will not let you leave till you are totally satisfied with the food. And if you do not seem to like any preparation, the chef will personally come to ask your preference and prepare something just the way you like it. Brilliant, isn't it?
Okay, now to cut a long story short, "SIMPLY THE BEST BUFFET IN TOWN".
A must visit, as many times as you want!
Cheers.

Well their is a reason that this restaurant is one the best buffet joints in town. The reason is their ability to pamper their guests to their hearts contents. No buffet restaurant in town continually asks customers about the taste of each item. Or instantly changes the item if the taste didn't match the patrons taste. It is such small intricacies that separate the good from the best.

This is really one the best buffet places in Kolkata. Service is too good, Waiters are courteous and they are very prompt to give you the exact one.

They provide a large variety of starters, main courses and desserts. All these items are equally good. I visited this place 2 times.

After eating a lot of starters also I was able to have main courses and yes desserts(actually I had plenty of the desserts after eating a lot of starters because they were too good).

Overall for both the times my experience was awesome.

An amazing experience.One of best buffet in town.Extremely delicious kebab can makes‚Äã you mad.
There are chicken, mutton,fish kebabs in starters.Fish kebab can give you a feeling of heaven.Main courses have biriyani,Roty,nun, mutton Rogan Josh, chicken, salads, soup etc. Main course is good but not as awesome as starters.Then come desserts‚Äã,those are as good as starters.Desserts list enrich with khir,gulab jamun, cheese cake, custard, brownie,5 type of kulfi ,fruits and ice cream.I might miss 2or 3 names, please forgive my memory.If you are a food lover,you must explore this place with family and friends.One more thing,staffs are awesome and very well behaved and helpful...10 on 10 for them.

Not the best buffet but the best hovering place for the starters.Though the timing creates a trouble but once you get in u can relish the full of it... service is too good, the waiters look after your needs and wants and bring exactly the ones within a second... the amount you get for the price you pay suffices the taste for the individual dishes.... main course should be altered with some more unfamiliar varieties.... the desserts are too cool than u expect.... the variety of kulfis tenders your sweet tooth magic.... and to beat the summer refreshments are a big yes yes which they provide along with the starters to help you keep healthy while munching!!! The party-giggers can spend enough of time here!

On the 4th attempt I thankfully got a chance to try the lunch buffet here. We are been welcomed with a complementary drink of aampanna and fresh lime soda. Along with that they served 5 types of Barbeques including fish, prawn, mutton n chicken. The starters they served are awesome and the best part is their service which was excellent. Even the main chef came to us to take the feedback of food. I have visited many restaurants but very few have offered this kind of quality food. This is one of the finest restaurant where people will get quality as well as service. In the main course I tried chicken biriyani which was not so good and then I tried butter nun along with mutton rogan josh which I liked. The eye catching part is there desert section where u will get loads of pastries, fruits, gulab jamuns, kheer, ice creams and coolfies. Lastly I must say that I really get surprised when the waiter returned the offered tip and said that this is against the norms of the restaurant. This is undoubtedly one of the best place to get some quality food if u r a foodie :)

Barbeque Nation, voted the best buffet unanimously, and for really for some good reasons !!

Starters are called Starters for a reason, but you never feel like putting an end to it. 
The Non Veg Skewers were definitely mind-blowing, especially the Prawns and Fish. 
Give a try to Vegetarian ones as well viz. Mushroom and Chilly Corn Skewers. 
Being at BBQ, I get all immersed in the Starters, that I actually forget that Main Course awaits !!

I had a little space for Main Course, and nothing great to mention. 
Need to mention, somehow didn't notice any of the live counter here.

The Dessert section had an assortment of Pastries, Ice Cream, Brownie and Gulab Jamuns.

I have to acknowledge, the staff here, for they were the perfect ingredients to the making of the whole experience being very courteous, asking our opinion on the quality of the food, trying to understand our taste buds. 

I feel they do need to enhance their Dessert portion a bit and have a live counter for some exotic Non Vegetarian items.

In nutshell, it was an admirable experience with the restaurant and the food (obviously). Recommended !!

Starting from the starters to deserts, words fail to describe how exquisite these are...only one thing that can be improved is the ambiance.It should be better in a place with such quality dining & if the ambiance will improve then it will add the cherry on the top...just perfect.

The most othentic buffet place in city with multiple and maximum number of preperations than any other buffet place. This particular has flourished itself across the country widely. The most intetesting part is it allows a number of time slots with different price tag accordingly which helps you to select your most preferable time. Serving so many dishes, it is budget friendly, good ambience and assisting staffs. Special mention includes kebabs, chiken salad, dum aalu an ofcourse pan flavoured kulfi.

We visited Barbeque Nation ¬†this week for the first time and it was a really nice experience. We were waiting for a long time for this particular visit and were excited too.
We went there at 12 and it was getting full almost instantly. We had already booked our seats, so seat availability was not an issue to us. They started serving their starters after few minutes. A complimentary drink was also served along with starters. Options for drink were Cola, Cold Drinks. Among the various starters I can remember Sweet Corn, Chicken Wings, Madrasi Chicken, Chili Garlic Prawn, Mutton Kebab, Fish Tikka, Cashew Potato and a Paneer item. Chicken Wings were fantastic along with Mutton Kebab and Cashew Potato. Prawns and Madrasi Chicken were also very good, but I personally had not liked the Paneer item and Fish item. After having starters we decided to go for main course, though we were almost full. We tried Corn Soup, Veg Noodles, Chili Gobi, Chicken Biryani, Mutton Rogan Josh, Chicken Akbari. None of the item were up to the mark. Biryani seemed dull along with the Chicken and Mutton items. We simply did ¬†not like the main course. It is understandable why people skip their main course at Barbeque Nation. Deserts were another attraction to us. There were Gulab Jamuns, Vanilla and Strawberry Ice-cream, Watermelon, Pastry, Phirni and Koolfi. Gulab Jamuns and Koolfies were really very good. Pastries and Ice-creams tasted good too, but we had not liked Phirni.
Overall we liked both starter and desert section, but the main course part was not good at all. Staffs were really caring. They took care if all the things were going well. Hope to visit again.

I had been to Barbecue Nation Sector 5 for the first time 4 years ago. It was 550/- for a lunch buffet back then on a Monday at noon. The food. *__* Jaw dropping, tonguegasm; is what it'll cause. I had assorted kebabs, fried seafood, vegetarian and non-vegetarian appetizers and a fine kulfi pan from the pan station that they had on that very day.

You want to reach there you have to reach at Salt Lake Sec.V first. The area is enclosed with many buildings of some offices.

If you are waiting with baited breath for a great buffet this place will not let down your hope.

Ambience & Decor 8.5/10
Service 9.5/10
Food 10/10

Pocket pinch wise it is the one of the best buffet in the town. Apart from everything you can "Barbecue" your starter as long as you want & the elicited service will provide you the starter untill you flag up.

Service- ok.  Staff was courteous but starters were not refilled on time. They would place a pile of 2 - 3 kind of starters on the grill at a time and we'll have@ to keep waiting for the other items. Some starters wouldn't be repeated till the end.

Food -  good.

The Kebabs just left me speechless and the concept of that grilling thing is very innovative and the first on i have seen. If you ask me why not 5 on 5 rating, that is because your kebabs were on point but you lost the half rate on your main course. I am not saying it was bad but as a food enthusiast, i felt that the excellent flavour which was present in your kebabs was not there on the main course. Alltotal I had an excellent experience and will hope to taste better main course dishes.

Good:1.Delicious kebab

            3.Polite staff
            4.good service
            5.We did not knoe that tipe is not permitted and had kept tip.the staff came out and gave back the money which was a nice gesture.

Bad: my Italian smooch had mainly ice with a very little liquid.It tasted good.When I enquired about almost a glass full of ice I was given a fresh glass with only extra water which made the drink tasteless

This place is a paradise for chicken lovers. Unlimited food is something you wanna hear always. The 10 starters are extraordinary. There is complimentary beverage. The dessert section is good. The main course is great with the most amazing chilly chicken. The service is very efficient. But it may take a while to get seats in there.

This place is my all time favourite for buffet. Ambience is nice & staff's are well behaved. Excellent starters. Coming to main course it's also good. Specially the mutton. But the best part is desert section. You will definitely fall in love with small gulab jamun & kulfi. Well I must say if you are a foodie and looking for great buffet this place is perfect for you. Also need to mentioned there cocktails are equally good.

I went for a Team lunch from office and found a perfect buffet offering similar variety in both veg and non-veg dishes. Starter was the main attraction for me. They served more than 10 dishes including veg and non veg. Main course was not bad either. However desserts were the show stopper. They offered ice creams, phirni, gulab jamun, brownie, pastry, 8 different flavours of kulfi and few more which I could not remember. Ambience was urbane and nice. Staff and service was great. In one sentence "The best buffet in the city" !

Truely the best buffet in Kolkata, really living up to its name!!! Food is just awesome, apart from that, i'm really amazed of the fact that how genuine their service was. It was spot on, checking whether we are liking what they are providing, want to try other combination of stuffs that aren't in the menu, they even made some special kebabs out of our request, i really liked the environment and the service which were provided to us along with the delicious menu! Specially the dessert section, the kulfis along with the scoops of icecream were out of the world. I strongly recommend everyone to check out the place for outstanding food and service.

I can't count how many times I visited this place, but every time I am surprised that they maintain so good quality throughout.
Nothing new to be told.. just visit this place, have unlimited kebabs, starters and buffet.
A must must recommended for all.

What new can be told about this place. Unlimited kebab starters and to finish it off, your stomach will be full. Still, we tried few other dishes to taste, all were equally good in quality.
We hang in this place quite often as this is in close proximity of our office at sector V, salt lake.

Located in Sector 5 near Big Cinemas. Visited this place for friends engagement party. The food was lip smackinglyly delicious as always. The chicken kababs were very good. Golden prawns was nice. Among the veg items, Potato in Kajun curry was delicious. Cheese cake and gulab jamun stood out in desserts.

Definitely very easy to locate, near RDB Boulveyard.
The place is always crowded, it's very difficult to get a seat without prior booking.
The ambience is amazing and so is the staff.
The starters are delectable. I was so full after the starters that I had to skip the main course.
The desserts stole the show, undoubtedly.üëå

Visited thrice and was overwhelmed everytime by the quality of food. Starters and desserts are a must have. The welcome drink is complimentary. The main course is something which BBQ can work upon as it is frequently skipped by the visitors because it can not be compared with the high quality of starters and desserts.

Such a brilliant concept this is turning into. Great great barbeque food. We went for a corporate team dinner. Ambience is so calm at the same time very alive. Starters are mouthwatering and served with a proper barbeque grill for each table. Mushroom and pineapple are amazing.

Main course is generally not so good at buffet places but that's not the case here. Great curries and dishes. 
Dessert alone is worth all the money you pay. Awesome pastries, brownies, kulfi, icecream, and so many things I can't even remember.

All in all great experience for a great price. Only suggestion is to book in advance as it's packed full almost every day.

Just one word to sum up my experience : "Name sells despite a bad product".
After many instances of delays, I finally visited the much-hyped Barbeque Nation Saltlake, for a Buffet Lunch with great expectations.
All my expectations were washed away from the word go. The restaurant has a large dining space, but its not sufficient for the number of people they accommodate in one sitting. As expected , the restaurant was full, and that led to a lot of chaos while picking the main courses from the spread.
The highlight point of Barbeque Nation is the generous spread of Starters served on the table with live grill in front. The idea and concept is unique to Barbeque Nation. What was disappointing was the quality of starters. The Non Veg starters included Chicken Tikka, Muttun Seekh Kabab, Ajwaini Fish Tikka, Prawns and few Veg items like Cajun spiced Potato, Sweet corns, Paneer Tikka. The disappointing part was that almost all the Non Veg starters were too dry and lacked enough juice to make them tasty enough to eat. Some were even burnt. When I reported the matter to one of the serving people, they offered me another variation of the Chicken Tikka, which was better than the previous one. That means they are capable of making good Kebabs but mess it up due to the volume of customers they have to serve in one go.
For the first time in my life, Vegetarian Starters tasted better than the Non Veg ones in a Buffet!!! I was pleasantly surprised myself.
As I said about the Main Course, all diners almost get up together for taking the main course, which creates a chaotic situation in the serving area. The Main Course items were good enough with good variety. Few disappointing things include a Fish item with bones, cooked in a mustard style which, as expected, was shunned by every diner. The Chicken Biriyani was tasty, but once the Chicken pieces were exhausted, it was not replenished.
Coming to the desert section finally. Variety of serving was good. Few pastries, Brownies, Phirni, Moong Dal Halwa, Mini Gulab Jamun, 2 varieties of Ice cream, and the 6 varied flavours of Kulfi. Decent spread. I have tasted better Phirni elsewhere, so it should not be their recommended dish as stated by Zomato. Moong Dal halwa was good. The best part of the desert section was the Kulfi counter. I tasted the Pan flavoured Kulfi and it was too good.
To sum up, I find no good reason for people to scream for a Buffet Lunch at Barbeque Nation. I have previously visited Chai Break, just beside Barbeque Nation, for a Buffet Lunch, and their quality, spread and serving is far better than Barbeque Nation in my opinion. My review of Chai Break is also there in Zomato for reference if somebody desires to read. Several buffets at Mythh HHI, Bridge at The Park, Novotel, Sigree, Jaisalmer and even Afraa are much better than Barbeque Nation. Even Hi-Brew Senses offers a good Buffet at a pocket-friendly price. Those looking for Table Top grill experience could try Sigree and Ocean Grill which offer similar experiences.
Barbeque Nation is definitely not in my revisit list of good dining places.

Barbeque nation is one of the best places in kolkata for food lovers where people come only for eating without any limit... Yes the reason is there awesome buffet system... All there items especially the starters are just awesome and there are so many lip smacking starters that it is hard to choose the best one out of them.

Suggestion:- This place is not worthy enough for people who have less diet.

You will find that the dinner is not so good because of the starters you had before

Lastly there deserts are just yumm awesome

A must place to visit for food lovers whether they are vegetarians or non vegetarians..

This place is a food lover's paradise! The charcoal grill set on the table with an array of kebabs- chicken, fish, prawn, paneer, mushrooms are so tasty. They also served Tangri kebab and Mutton kebab. Although I'm a non vegetarian I love the crispy American sweet corn! So very delicious. If you have space after starters head out to the main course- the biryani and salads are a die for. The dessert counter is elaborate and what I loved in particular was the live kulfi counter. Really nice concept. 

Tip: Have a lot of starters, skip main course, and have a lot of deserts ;)

Back at some time ¬†I went to this place and rated it really great. However, on this X-mas day, I again visited the place. But things got little worse right here. Back next day we got a review call from the restaurant and I explained to the lady what I did not like up there and wondered how they fall down? So what was my experience?¬†Starting with the starter I don't know why they changed the barbecued prawn type, which was very nice before. Turkey and Duck were special items on that day with a live counter. We requested a customized dish from them and they really provided it. The main course items were just the worst of all. The special item of the main course i.e. squid preparation¬†was awful and other items too I did not like. ¬†What I loved this time too was the kulfis. Overall, I really love this restaurant but please don't moderate the items so much that we stop liking them. And it will be really better if the change the main course items with signature dishes of their own.

Visited two times till date. Best in the business considering buffet quality and spread. They tick all the boxes in a good way. Only downside being the lack of variation in the menu list. A bit of variation can be attractive for repeat visitors.

Well known as one of the best buffet in the city, it's a pure delight to have a variety of sumptuous items. Starters are too good with equally wonderful service. From Chicken to fish, Prawn to Tengri kabab everything is a continuation one after another. Not to forget the Potato Stuff too. Coming to main course you can go for some salads, biriyani & side dishes (Indian), but hold your tongue for some delicious deserts. Out of 10+ visits of mine almost 70% of the time I have directly switched to deserts after starters. So don't think twice, just visit. P:S: my last visit (from office) had some bad experience wrt service, it was slow on that day. But that was the only one time, else each time was a super satisfactoryüòä

I am a regular visitor to this place since 2013. Last friday 3rd march I visited this place again but anyhow I did not like the food so much as i used to do 3 years back.... their quality has detoriated. They have stopped giving chicken tengri kabab in starter this time. But yes they are still the best buffet in town. My say is its still very good but not that good as it used to be 3 years back.... and the tastes are almost same as it used to be they dont bring much change in 3 years.... BUT I MUST SAY THEIR COOLFI ROCKS... SPECIALLY THEIR PAN COOLFI... IT MELTS MY HEART EVERYTIME I HAVE IT..... THEY HAVE STARTED THIS ITEM 2 YEARS BACK AND IT ROCKS FOREVER.... Anyways those who are looking forward to visit this place can surely go and must go.

I had visited this outlet of Barbecue Nation on the 27 th February...Well I must say that the starters and the desserts blew away my mind...I was so full after the starters that I could not even try the main course...What I really like about this outlet is their superb customer service...The staff are constantly vigilant ,asking if we are liking the food,if it is matching our taste..They literally make you feel at home...I wish I could give more points for the excellent services that they provide....And as far as the food is concerned,I completely loved it...
I would surely recommend this place to anyone and everyone...
They made my anniversary memorable and I'm indebted to them for that...
A very big thank you to the management and staff of Barbecue Nation...
Hoping to visit soon...

Awesome in all parameters...
Food, amibence, service everything is awesome.
The barbeques of chicken, prawn  and fish are obviously yummy but the veg barbeques are also worth mentioning. 
Please try the pineapple barbeques even if you are a pure non-vegetarian. Do not ignore the pine apple barbeques and the crispy corns.

I have been to BBQ Nation in quite a lot of states. However, comparing the same with Delhi or other states, this one was a bit lower on the mark in food quality, ambience and service. However, comparing the same to places to have BBQ food, this is a very good place. Live Kulfi counter, all-you-can-eat counters and with a complimentary drink, it is one of the hot zones to visit in SaltLake City.

I have been celebrating my special occasions in Barbeque Nation ( Delhi NCR) outlets since last 5-6 years.
This time we went to this outlet in Kolkata and had my worst experience. 
They only served 2 non veg starters along with 2 on grills.... the service was horrible. The items were over at our table and no one was there to attend to us. When we asked to speak with the manager the waiters did not get him to me. 
When we moved towards the main course. There was only gray in the name of mutton. I was standing there 4 sometime and no one came. When i went to have dessert there was no gulab jamun n moong daal halwa. When it came the halwa was tasting like sugar lump. At the end when I payed the bill, I expected to get the tab where we can share the review and it also never reached me.

Overall it was a very Sad Experience for me tonight.

Almost perfect ! Except a few main course items which got served late.. rest were worthy of its good reputation.

Moreover good and friendly workforce is an added advantage. 

Enjoyed it completely !

This one was by far the best experience I had. The ambience was very comfortable and the food was lip smacking. I espicially loved the dessert part and the corn dish. This place should be in everyone's bucket list ‚ù§

Imagine being a broke and finally managing to gather enough money to have a buffet at Barbeque Nation during "Happy Hours",only to find out that even after reaching the restaurant within the Happy Hours specified time,the offer won't be up for grabs for you.
0/5 for unclear rules.
Moving on to the food.
For starters,they seemed more eager to serve prawns than other chicken and fish starters.
On request to serve more fish and chicken wings for starters instead of prawns,they seemed more eager to serve smashed potatoes and mushrooms and cheese balls and sweet fried corn.
They almost made my non-veg meal a vegan meal.
However,the Mutton and fish kebabs were really good and so were the chicken wings.
3/5 for starters
The main course.
Oh crap!That dum biryani seemed more like haldi rice with a bit of spice in it.
And,being a buffet,there is always some customer or the other,who spilled the buffet table.
Buffet serving restaurants should have some staff taking care of that stuff.
1/5 for main course.
The dessert.
Omg!was that even a firni?
5 varieties of cake don't make a good dessert.
And as usual,the icream scoop section was badly spilled by previous customers and sadly no measures were taken to restore it.
And damnit! Increase the diameter of those gulab jamnus.You are in West Bengal for God's sake.We like our sweets big and round.
2/5 for dessert.
The service and the ambience were good,but imagine getting a table at 3 and being asked to finish your buffet before 4:30 because they would be closing down for dinner  :)

If you're a big kind of foodie and looking for a buffet place to dine in then this is the perfect place for you. Their staffs are extremely nice. The starters are filled with lots of kababs. All of the starters are so delicious that you will have no space empty in your stomach. Now coming to the main course, the salad section, veg section and non-veg section have various dishes. But the most delicious section is the dessert section. I am pretty sure the desserts will satisfy your taste buds (especially the gulab jamuns) There is a different section for kulfi lovers. Six types of kulfis are there. Paan kulfi will grab your attention especially. This place really deserves 5.0 ratings.

Whenever I drop in my flag stays up till I am satisfied with the plethora of kababs; be it chicken, mutton or even the occasional prawn. Ultimately I have to cut down on the main course as I am almost full by the time I finish with the barbecues. If you love barbecues it's the place to be!

The best buffet place in Kolkata. Good ambience with excellent service and food. If you are non vegetarian and love to eat chicken mutton prawn , a must go place in the city. Their service is outstanding as well. Once we didn't like one of the mutton  starter and after saying this to one of the stuffs, the chef personally came to us and after knowing our likes and dislikes, he prepared a dish exclusively for us - such a sweet gesture to make your customers happy! And I personally love their dessert section too. Full marks from my side !

This place is a wonder. Huge buffet spread! Humble staff. The buffet starts with number if kebabs, tikka, roast which are served on tandoor on table. A complimentary drink is also given with options of fresh lime soda, coke, beer. In main course you have everythin ranging from biryani, paneer, aloo, mutton, egg, fish, vegetables, number of salads and many more. Breads which you ask for will be served on table. In desert section you are spoilt for choices. Cakes, pudding, sewai, gulabjamun, fresh fruits, cheesecake, indian sweets, ice cream. The last but the best part is the kulfi. They have 6 varieties ranging from paan, kesar pista, stawberry, chocolate, etc. All are very refreshing and worth trying!

This was my first visit to this place. I just loved their hospitality. After informing them that I am a vegetarian and my companion is non vegetarian,they took complete care in making sure there was no inconvenience for me. The food was good, though I found the brownies a bit hard. The starters,main course and desserts were really tasty. Pan kulfi was the show stopper.

This is one of the best places in Kolkata for buffet. I have visited this place several time and always was fully satisfied with the food quality, menu and unlimited quantity. I visited with my wife and little daughter of 3 years last time on 9-th of February to celebrate our marriage anniversary. I found the place very crowded on a Thursday evening that itself speaks about the popularity of the place. We got a corner table just below the A/C vent. We requested to  change our table as our daughter was sufferings from cold but nobody cared. Unlike other times when a particular person came near our table and introduces himself, this time I found two people came and said both will serve us. Actually for shortage waiters they could not give personal care to a single table. So when I ask for some chutney to someone he goes to some other table whereas another person came with next keban stick who has no idea what we asked earlier. We asked something for our daughter. Though they have given some nonspicy kebabs but in main course there was nothing. Even the soup was very spicy. As it is common for a family to come with little child it will be appreciated if some nonspicy foods were made for them also. (When we visited Barbeque Nation in Vizag the Chef came and asked what he can prepare for the baby, that too in a crowded Sunday Lunch session.) The food was as good as always and refilled everytime we wanted. It is definitely an excellent restaurant for dineout. But please don't be oversatisfied. Sigree and Flame and Grill are there. I request the authority to keep an eye on quality of service too.

I went to this branch of Barbeque Nation for the first time on 11th Feb '17 and found it not at all comparable with the other branches I visited in Bangalore or Hyderabad. In this branch there was only five items in Non-vegetarian starter where as in Bangalore or Hyderabad we have ample of options. Moreover in those outstation branches, they have options of live counters and they also prepare starters as per choice of customers apart from their scheduled options. In salt lake branch, supply of starters were also not spontaneous. Service personnel were not much interested to supply prawns and only on several repeated demand they served prawns. Quality of mutton, chicken and fish of main course were also not very good, just OK. However, ambiance of the restaurant was good.

Having eaten numerous times with friends at Barbeque Nation I can only say the spread is A1 as always, the starters served efficiently and copiously, the buffet varied and delicious. An additional note of thanks for the Supervisor who came rushing out to return my mobile, carelessly left behind. My only crib is that booking is not possible on Zomato. No frequent diner-out would like to have individual apps for each restaurant. Pl BN simplify your booking.

By the time I write this review, this branch of the Barbeque Nation franchise will have received in excess of 5,700 votes, and nearly 2,700 raving, 4+ reviews; more than double the highest number I‚Äôve even seen for any restaurant in the UAE. Interestingly it is identical in concept to the darling of the Indian community in Dubai, AB‚Äôs Barbeque. For those who have not visited either, Barbecue Nation (and AB‚Äôs) takes the whole buffet concept to a different level by bringing skewers of pre-cooked kebabs; chicken, veggies, fish, prawns and minced meat, to tables which have a little built-in hot coal grills, where guests then ‚Äòwarm‚Äô them to their liking. Then, like at good thali restaurants where bowls are continuously refilled, here too stripped skewers are continuously replenished until the guest says stop‚Ä¶or he/she pops.

Great place for foodies, especially starters, we have been there so many times but on 19th Jan we have been there and it was our anniversary night, I am not going to put my reviews on food as we all know that is awesome. for anniversary they gave us a surprise cake and candles, it was lovely. Also at the end they took a picture and gave us the same with a bar-b-q frame. this kind of hospitality is rare. It is truly amazing.
            
One suggestion I can provide is that, they need to work on the main course, it is very much common like other restaurants.

So we all know the drill by now, sit and down and be prepared to be taken on a joyous food ride. Freshly cooked kebabs and tandoori items served right onto the table letting you eat as much as you want. Situated in the IT Hub of kolkata, the place hosts a lot of corporates and office parties. The starters have options from tangri kebabs, mutton seekh kebab, prawns and a lot more. The veg starters are pretty decent too. The main course offers limited choices in Indian and Chinese cuisine and the dessert sections hosts a range of pastries and firnis to end your perfect food date on a sweet note. If you are looking for a buffet place at a reasonable price, this is definitely the place to be.

One of the best place for buffet in town. Went for a dinner buffet and was glad with the food. They serve a variety of food. The starters were the best part which had chicken, mutton, prawns, panner kebabs to offer. All of them were tasty and served from live grill. I love their salads too. Then coming to the main course, they had alot of items for sure but nothing special. But the food was delicious. The dessert section was the best part. Had alot of variety and all of them tasted equally good, i repeat all of them. Went during the happy hours so got a discount too. Good amount for the money paid.

Ambiance 4.5/5 the space is little short there, they should obviously try to expand the space.
Service 5/5 the waiters were very helpful and was always ready to serve anything you want. Two people asked me about the food if anything lacking or not.I think they might be chef so now you know how good the service was.
Food 5/5 the starters and the desert are the main attraction here. Awesome food, nothing more to say. Must try the panmasala flavour kulfi.
Tip: go before 12:30 then you can avail the early bird offer then eat until you are full, no time bound.
It's a must try buffet for any food lovers, don't miss it.

Visited today to celebrate my birthday.... it was a wonderful experience with some lip smacking kababs on the grill and some other awesome starters off the grill. Main course was okay but other than barbeque, the dessert section was quite a delight with yummylicious ice-creams, kulfis, gulab jamun etc. Overall it was an amazing lunch spent which became even more special by the birthday cake which they organised for me. The service was too good, everyone seemed quite friendly. Will love to visit again !

Awesomeness at its best...that is how Barbeque Nation is! I have been to Bbq nation in Bangalore several times and this was my second visit to the salt lake branch in Kolkata. The desserts continue to be awesome as always! The starters were delicious and loved that the grilled prawns were crispy yet tender. The chicken wings were perfect and so were the mutton seekh kababs. Surprisingly the starters were light enough so I didn't feel stuffed even after eating tons of kababs. I loved that they had chicken soup in the main course since I love soups! In desserts the chocolate kulfi was superb. I was glad that my favorite desserts were there - tiramisu, chocolate truffle and phirni. Went to celebrate our anniversary on Republic Day. Additional 5 Stars for the super friendly staff. Cheers!!

Chicken biriyani,mutton kosha,Doi chicken, fish masala, 2types of chicken salad and many more in the main course.. In desserts Chocolate cake,cheese cake,firni,fruit custard,fruits,hot golap jamun,vanilla and Strawberry ice cream with chocolate and Strawberry sauce and at last 6 types of kulfies were there...

I love going to buffets but I rarely go to any. The main reason for this strange habit is that most places that offer buffets don't have good food. Then I visited Barbeque Nation and my love for buffets increased in manifolds. The food here is amazingly delicious. Complete from the starters to the desserts, the number of items is plenty and the taste awesome. You'll have wide range of options in both vegetarian as well as non vegetarian food. 
My suggestion: If you're planning a dinner here, skip your lunch as you are bound to overeat here. üòÅ

I usually don't go for buffets, as I end up eating way more than is good for my figure, but I do remember my experience here as an excellent one. Barbeque Nation follows the dining format similar to several Indian grills - unlimited kebabs served at the table, followed by a main course and dessert buffet, with one drink included in the price her head. I adored the Fish Ajwaini kebab and the Mutton Galauti Seekh Kebab - and this is high praise from me considering that when it comes to kebabs I prefer chicken above either fish or mutton. I must have eaten about a dozen galauti kebabs! For mains I took the Paneer tikka masala and the chicken biriyani. The former was beautifully smooth and went well with fresh naan, and the latter was well spiced and just how a good biriyani should be. I didn't take much, though, as I was saving up my appetite for the dessert. They do a yummy mud pie! Also, despite not being a kulfi person at all, I actually skipped ice-cream in favour of one of the kulfis from the live counter, and it was scrumptious! The perfect sweet creamy ending to a heavy meal! A great experience. Go there for sure if you want good, unlimited Indian fare.

One of the very few places where I can post a 5.0 review without a shadow of doubt. This by far, is one of the best buffet places in the city. Their kebabs are literally to die for! The cherry on the top is the very personalised attention that the chef gives to each of the customers. Barbecue truly knows how to impress! I loved their Achaari Mushrooms and Dahi Kebabs are something that'll drag me to this place again and again! I'll keep coming back for more!

Non-veg starters and desserts are winners.
Their main course has always been a little dicey, but i tend to skip it altogether usually! :P
Their anjeer and paan flavoured kulfis are my BBQ Nation first loves. :)
Great place for a massively satisfying dining experience.

The starters were over the mark as always and we were served a special chicken dish coz we complained that the chicken wings were over-cooked.
The dessert section looks better with the Park Street joint though.

Visited your outlet last week and was very disappointed to find that there was no music..when I was told that you had done away with the musicians I was taken aback as that was one of the reasons I visit your outlet frequently....your food has deteriorated over the months but I still visited with my family because of the music and good ambience and close proximity to my residence... Its an earnest request to have the musicians back with good live music to enhance your ratings and hope the quality of food is brought back to its former taste which will improve your outlet overall....thank you....

I always like to visit the place. Food quality is really good. Whenever I am here, I feel as if I have come to the heaven of Kababs. I also love the dessert they provide. The environment is also very soothing. Staffs are well mannered.

Barbeque Nation offers the best buffet money can buy for the non 5 star category of foodies. The unlimited starters and refreshing welcome drinks are surely the stars of the buffet. Be it the succulent prawn or the juicy chicken leg, the well marinated paneer or the crispy American corn, their kebabs literally rule the tandoori cuisine of Kolkata. Nowhere else have I tasted better grilled food in the entire city. The main course is a bit of a letdown though due to the lack of good entrees. The salads do try to make up for it. The desserts again are mind blowing. The perfect restaurant for a date since they offer the option of reserving a table well in advance using their own Android app.

I Always liked to go to this place not only for the food which is always great but for the live music that always made our evening enjoyable. I'm a little disappointed with it being stopped cause it was one of the thing that me and my family used to always look forward for. The singer was very good and polite and entertaining a great showman. Hope it could get back to the old way it was and i'm sure that i'm not the only customer who feels this way. THE RATING IS BASED ON THE LIVE MUSIC AND FOOD

First off all kindly remove/stop advertising ‚ÄúLive Music‚Äù from your Highlights as you no longer have music, stop trying to attract crowd by false adverts. My family and friends use to visit here because of the serene environment triggered by the melodious music and awesome food. But sorry to say you have lost your main attraction/charm. One free advise kindly get back your singer/music and you will get back your business, or else you will soon suffer a huge loss !!!! which I do not wish as I am a regular visitor of most of your branches, specially (New Delhi and Kolkata) and found the Salt Lake one of the best. All the best for 2017.

Barbeque Nation is not a restaurant, it is an emotion. i must say its an worth going place if anyone misses, for them. we took buffet for lunch, kababs were delicious, all the foods were extremely maintained in quality, the expenses is very less by which you can grab unlimited food whatever you want. personally my opinion, where kababs and desserts are just outstanding, maincourses were a bit low in taste beside them. otherwise ambience was also pleasant. i would like to visit the place again. thank you

Barbeque Nation is a celebration of good food. Grill served on the table, buffet lunch, sweets and salads and lots of happy people. Barbeque Nation has hit the right chords with its customers. We went there for lunch on a weekday and had starters all the way till we were full and later finished it off with sweets and kulfi. Now special mention in starters are prawns and the fish that stands out for me and mango cheese cake and kulfi were really good. And all this at a very small fixed price which hardly pinches your pocket.

I had my dinner on BBQ on 4/1/2017 and i was shocked with their quality i had started my buffet at 7.30 pm and without any drink charges my bill came Rs 1995 for 2 pax so per head came Rs977..But after paying Almost Rs 1000 what I got is just worst.No complimentary drinks,  Kebabs are over salted sticking fish was tasteless,mushroom not good ,paneer was tasteless,pineapple kebab was slightly ok,chicken wings were too bad,biriyani was cold and no meat in them,we are not paying this amount for eating cheap fishes like (baby katla fish)item name dhaniya fish.mutton tasteless,chicken a big bullshit,deserts are heart of BBQ but that day it was worst that day firni was tasteless no good options in desert.only gulab jamun tastes perfect like everytime and the ice cream.To be honest I am regular foodie of BBQ I will not go anymore for sure..Though their service boy wad very good and we also had a talk with their head chef their behaviour was appreciative..

I have to say I had one of the best buffets and spent the best times in a restaurant over here.
We went on the new year day and amidst the crowd in the restaurant, the waiters were worth mentioning.
They were highly concerned if we were satisfied with the quality and coming back to provide for FRIED BABY CORN as starters EVEN THOUGH THEY DINT HAV THAT ON THE MENU, on request for feedbacks.
That was something we were really taken back.
They had an unique menu that day, names inspired frm BOLLYWOOD FILMS that had lovely starters(chicken kebabs and wings, fish kebab, prawn kebab, swt corn, mutton & baby corn) and awesome range of main courses(all of which we cudnt taste). Other than the conventional dishes they had TURKEY, pasta, assorted salads, soup, raita, different veggie curryies and many many more.
The chicken dish, biriyani, crab and the pasta was cooked so fine, i wished i cud eat more!(sigh)
Now the desserts at BBQ nation is always good.
Starting frm the yummmmmy cheesecake, custard pudding, pastries, carrot cake,2 kinds of gulaab jamun, fresh fruits, icecream as well as a LIVE KULFI COUNTER having 6-7 varieties.
What more can someone ask for!

Again, it was the BIRTHDAY of my frnd for which we got a complimentary cake from the restaurant and a beautiful PICTURE of ours clicked and framed given to us. How nice!
Delighting experience, however comparing this visit with my visit to the PARK ST BRANCH of the same outlet, the experience there(park st) was tragic. Lacked the same mouth watering taste and variety, i ll neva recommend going on a lunch to bbq park st.

Go to this branch and have that delight which wud make u run frm one end of the city to the othr to taste their fine platter.
U ll neva regret emptying ur wallet :p

The best buffet in town without any doubt. You can never get enough of it. You will die eating and still won't stop. The moment they put the grill machine I prepare myself to pounce on the kebabs. The barbeques are amazing and tastes like Heaven. The prawn, fish, chicken, mutton, chicken tangri and even the corn is delicious. People don't really focus on the main course but that also includes a wide variety of Indian cuisine from chicken, mutton, pulao, paneer and other items. The desserts are of a special attraction with live counters on occasions. The brownies, cupcakes, firni, fruit salad, chocolate and strawberry ice cream with choco and strawberry syrup, different flavours of cakes will keep you spell-bound. I always take a million rounds of the barbeques and almost 2 rounds of the desserts. The service by the staff is very good and gets full marks from my side. They keep approaching you if you have any problem with the food. Their behaviour is very appealing. The price is reasonable and I won't mind paying a bit more for this amazing platter. The ambience is also good and well decorated. They will provide you with a cake if you have any occasion like birthday or anniversary. After a meal at Barbeque Nation, I can assure you that you won't be able to get up from your seat.

My family and I used to visit Barbeque Nation Salt Lake City. We used to love the place for its music where they have a live band duo performing every single night and the music was lovely the food was good and moreover it is a family restaurant so we used to take the kids along too. But the music had stopped and its a very sad thing. I will not be using this restaurant again till the music is back. Please get the band back. They are the best you shouldn't let them go. The Only attraction there is the Live Music where as the food n service has dropped. Kindly consider my request and put them back. We want the live music back.

One of the few restaurants in town that deserve a five star rating. Well, by now someone who is using Zomato will know how good the food is, but apart from that the service is really prompt and excellent. They do have room for improving the ambience of the place, but who cares if you serve such food. A must visit if you are in Kolkata.

Let me point the negative ones first. Comming on the buffet menu we all know that biriyani is the antique dish of BBQ_N to present inside the museum. Mutton was very solid in nature and consisyed of bones wid vry less meat on it. In kebabs, prawns were over salted..but the fish kebabs were extremely delicious. I enjoyed chicken, paneer and other stuffs. For desserts, BBQ has a massive collection. And that only satisfied my stomach before leaving.

It seems to be dropping to its lowest and customers satisfaction is not GIVEN ANY PRIORITY WHATSOEVER. Look into the matters at the earliest or else I'll begin my search for a better Restaurant WITH LIVE MUSIC !!!!! Also if there was a rating lower than 1 i would definitely award it to YOUR RESTAURANT.

if you are looking for a posh ¬†buffet then Barbeque Nation is the perfect choice .
its the perfect place for ¬†celebrate your birthday or any special day with your friends and families.

Located in Saltlake, sector 5..just next to RDB, this place is a foodie's paradise!

Everything was just awesome starting from their strater to main course to dessert. Their hospitality and service was really good and took very good care of everything.

Ambiance was good with a live music.
specially the dessert .. it was awesome .

pocket pinch is high but its adjustable with the food quality and quantity .

so 4.5 for this foodie's paradise...

Last week we went there for this little reunion, and as always the place did not disappoint us. We went for lunch without any prior reservation so we were a little bit worried that we may not get seats. However we were lucky and as soon as the food was served we knew we made the right decision. The best part was the starters, consisting of various kebabs. Though a non-vegeterian, I really liked the veg. starters as well. The main course was average, but the desserts made up for the main course. The cheese cake was one of the best , I ever had and regretted for not being able to have some more of them. The staff were very polite and the chef also visited to know if we liked the dishes. Overall, the best buffet in a pocket friendly budget.

Okay so this place has been on my wishlist since a long time and finally I got the opportunity to tick it off!
Located in Saltlake, sector 5..just next to RDB, this place is a foodie's paradise!
Firstly the starters: There were soo many starters..and all of them were good except the Veg Spider Kebab and the Mutton Gilati Seekh Kebab, which I didn't like.
Here's a list of the starters you cannot miss!
¬§ Paras Chicken: Amazing Chicken Kebab. You can have loads of it without getting tired.
¬§ Hyderabadi Wings: Soft, creamy taste. A must try!
¬§ Cajun spiced baby potato: Grilled to its best!
¬§ Paneer Mirch Masala: Paneer has never tasted so good!
And oh, we were given to choose a complimentary drink between fresh lime soda and beer per person. We were 2, so we had both. Fresh lime soda was good as usual..and the beer was Tuborg.
Now, the main course: I was sooo full with the starters that I couldn't each much of main course. Still tried to manage some of my favourite dishes. Loved the Biriyani and the Murgh Makkhani. Didn't like the salads. Salads need to be better. And the chicken soup was my favourite part of the buffet! ‚ù§
For dessert: I loved the vanila ice cream with chocate sauce, the chocolate mudpie and the gulab jamun. Didnt like the cheesecake and the koolfi.
Coming to the staff: I have never seen such helpful, warm and friendly staff anywhere before! They are the MOST keen to serve. They refill our grill even before we finish and we never have to ask them for anything. The staff deserves a 5 upon 5!
Ambience: One who hasn't visited this place will never know the vibe here. Every customer looks so happy and satisfied. And everyone is so happily busy eating! Thats the best thing about this place. And this place is soo pocket friendly. You have unlimited food and desserts for max 1400 bucks for 2. What else does a foodie want? That's why this place always remains full. Better reserve your seats before hand to avoid waiting outside.

Last week we went there, we were 7 people together so booked a table in advance via app to avoid problem. 
We went to celebrate the birthday of one of my colleagues. 
Everything was just awesome starting from their strater to main course to dessert. Their hospitality and service was really good and took very good care of everything. 
Ambiance was good with a live music. 
Since we were there to celebrate birthday, got a complementary cake and a photo frame of all of us. 
Great experience, definitely will go again and recommended to all, must visit atleast once.

This restaurant is right now Kolkata's favourite when it comes to buffet. They provide a lot of varieties in starter,main course and desserts. In starters fish and prawn items were the best. In main course, udta punjab de saag(mutton cooked in herbs) was pretty good. Their live kulfi counter is the main highlight in desserts.

The starters are to die for.
The bahubali chicken, the fish, the prawns, amazing service. Saturdays give you non-veg buffet for Rs 979/- with a complimentary drink. Complimentary drinks include fresh lime soda and sometimes a bottle of tuborg too.
Coming to the main course, it was to be very honest, disappointing. The matar dish was undercooked, the mutton saag was underseasoned. However, the sea food dish in coconut gravy was delicious. They also offer delicious sea food and chicken salad but the pasta was not upto the mark.
Coming to the desserts, the chocolate carrot cake was way too eggy. The blueberry cheesecake was slightly more bitter than it should be.
The firni is brilliant and so are the gulab jamuns.
Nothing can beat their kulfis. I tried out each of the flavours which were chocolate, strawberry, mango, malai and paan.
I would visit the place JUST for their kebabs.
Though the place has been an all time favourite, I don't know if it was the crowd that caused a detoriation in the quality of the food but I was slightly disappointed this time.

Twice no one picked up the call and third time some one picked up and disconnected the call. 2.5 stars is just for the food. With rising popularity they seem to have devalued the customer which is why such instances are happening

Specially the prawn tandoori is one of the best. You have plenty of options if you are going for buffet. Worth the cost for one that they charge. Also the desserts are pretty mouthwatering. Alongwith this live band makes the environment awesome. Great place to eat, enjoy and go home with good experience.

And undoubtedly the best buffet available in Kolkata at a economic price. The best part was the starters, served at a open grill on the table itself. There was chicken, mutton, prawn, fish, paneer and other various finger-licking delicious kebabs. The main coarse was also quite diverse and delicious with biriyani and curries. Also the seafood salad is a must-have. The desserts make it more fabulous with tarts, pudding, a signature king of small gulaab-jamun, choices of ice-cream and kulfi(chocolate, paan, kesar manai are the best ones). It also offers complementary welcome drinks (lime-soda/beer) and food is free for children under 3 years of age. The ambiance and staff were pretty cool. Also reserve tables from the app because it's becoming famous fast and getting a table would be tough even in weekdays. Overall it's just a complete experience, a one totally worth the money.

Been here before, the consistency of food quality is getting degraded over time. Previously it used to be very good. 

Ambience, Decorations, Hospitality, Sitting-arrangements all are good however the food quality has somewhat watered down. In buffet mutton daakbunglow, chicken biriyani, are just simply average. Lacks in variety of dishes. Starters also so so. Quantity can't be the substitute of quality. Know your taste before picking up randomly, otherwise you may get disappointed.

Been there for the first time. Heard lots of good stuffs about this restro. It is in the ground floor of the RDB building. The decoration and the ambience was very good. Stuffs are good and cordial. Its a north indian buffet restro. There was a offer going on that you can get a complimentary drink(coke, Pepsi,  limca, Fanta, fresh lime soda and beer). Now come to the food part. I went for the non veg buffet. I got five types of kebab according to the menu chart  i.e. chicken malai kabab, prawn kabab, fish tikka kabab, mutton sheek kabab, chicken wings kabab and crispu corn. There was no malai in chicken malai kabab it was simply chicken reshmi kabab. The most disappointing thing was that the sizes were too small. Now come to the main menu course. The chicken Mexican soup was just an average one. Chicken biriyani was not that traditional taste of biriyani. I did not like that taste. There were egg curry and  chicken masala but both the curry were same taste. Sarson machli was the most astonishing part it was just big piece of rohu or katla with bone. I also don't like that part. Next come to the dessert part. It was pretty good. I got pantua, cheese cake (less sugar), chocolate moose, brownie, vailla and strawberry ice cream. All were good and tasty. Now another surprising part was that there was a live kulfi counter. You can get 4 different flavours kulfi i.e. mango, choclate, tradional one and pan masala kulfi. All those were pretty awsome. So overall it was a average restaurant with respect to the taste of food..

It's known as the best buffet in the city and it has maintained this legacy through years. It's always in high demand so you must make a reservation. 
The interior and decoration is not out of the world but it's conventional. They have a open kitchen so you can actually see when your kababs are being ready. :-)
Coming to food they serve the most tasty and succulent kababs. You'll get variety of fish, chicken, prawn, alu, mushroom, paneer, pineapple kababs and other than pineapple all were great. Along with kababs you'll get one complimentary drink.
Talking about main course honestly I never had much space left in my stomach for them but they were good.
In the dessert BBQ nation have a counter of most innovative kulfis. My personal favorite was the pan and kesar pista flavoured. Other than kulfi they have all the usual dessert staffs like ice cream, gulab jamun, pastrys and all.
Overall it's a must try and you can always plan your special days here to make the day memorable.

This chain is famous all over India and is worth all the fame. 
The food is tasty, plenty and the service is phenomenal. 
I have been visiting this place since the last 3 years. 
I love the starters. The grilled prawns and mushrooms are my personal favourites. The sweet corn and mutton sheekh kebab served in between starters are lovely too. Now, coming to the main course, the menu changes a lot but whatever it is, it will always be tasty, well cooked and impress your taste buds. The desserts counter is my favourite ! You get brownies,pineapple cakes, all types of fruits and all flavours of ice cream. 
 The staff is very friendly.
The complimentary drink is only a cherry on top of the cake.
I love the ambience, food, decor, service and value for money. 
It should be a MUST VISIT!

This place surely is the best option for buffet. The kebabs were too awesome, absolutely fresh. Especially the fish n prawns. Not only non veg, but I must say their veg starters were equally good. I loved the corn n mushrooms too. They have maintained their standard throughout. The kurfi counter was awesome, the ice-creams n cakes were my all time favourite. The behaviour of the staffs were exceptionally good. They altered the taste of the starters according to our recommendations. They also brought a cake for the bday boy which was really a cute one. Had a lovely experience with my friends last evening. Would surely come back soon...

The only thing I liked and ate mostly were prawns other than that everything was average, Chicken tikkas lacked spices. Main course was horror, I took some chicken gravy and regretted my decision after having first bite, it was undercooked and plain. The ice cream counter was great. My advice : go for prawns and prawns only.

Finally a restaurant that deserves 5/5
Excellent service and exception food

A chain restaurant in with multiple outlets at various cities

The starters come with the grill and has various others dishes other than grilled items too as their dishes 
Extremely satisfying 
And if u are with the family best place to visit 
They provide complimentary food to children accompanied by their parents and the children food are non spicy and juice.

It is ok with the main course and they provide you a mock tail complimentary.
Had varieties of salad and their dressing too.
Mayonnaise dressing,mustard dressings and many more.

But you will be in love with the deserts 

The have almost every thing in the desert that the people love

From fruits to pastries to brownie to ice cream and last bug not the least they have lots of varieties of kulfi
Mango kuli with rabari is yum
Coconut kulfi
Kesar kulfi is also good
And paan kulfi endless possibilities.

They always asks you weather you are liking your food or not

If u want something to be spicy,they make every possible effort to make you satisfied.

And you get a cake too if u are celebrating something.
Great in their management.
They are best in every aspect.

One Awesome Experience of Food..! Cozy Ambience, Lip Smacking Starters, Tempting Desserts ..are the main attractions. I am not fond of fish, but their cilantro fish made me try it more than twice. Prawns were cooked to perfection, generally prawns are overcooked that makes them chewy. Starters are enough to fill your up tummy. Main course are worthy enough to leave some space. Chinese and Indian were available. Last but not the least.. the Gulabjamuns.. melt in your mouth. Undoubtedly Best Buffet in Town! Courteous n Helpful staff will make your food journey customized if required and smooth. Go for it.

My last double digit review (99th, off course) and what better than reviewing a place worth a thousand visits and a place I had almost visited a thousand times (8 times to be precise and counting) ! Barbeque Nation is a glutton's paradise where calories float in a surrealistic demanour. :)
My favorites are the Prawn starters, the Biriyani in the main course and off course the entire dessert counter. The Kulfi counter off late had attracted me to a new extent and I loved their Paan Kulfi to the core. Needless to mention that among the 6 BN outlets I had visited (from various cities), Salt Lake Kolkata outlet serves the best food and ambiance, although not the best service. :) Nevertheless, their service surpasses that of any big shots of the city and well, why not, they are a pan-Asian organization now. Kudos to the BN team, Salt Lake ! Keep rocking.

Big restaurant with lots of delicious foods to tickle your taste buds. 
Went there in a crowd of 7 , so the fun was beyond imagination. All of us opted for non veg buffet lunch. Foods served were really yummy and enough to fill ones tummy. Service was quick and servixe persons were polite. 
Starter consisted of everything ie fish, mutton, chicken, prawn, paneer, pineapple, mushroom barbeque etc etc. It even consisted of a complimentary drink(non-alcoholic)
Didn't try the main course, as I wanted to try all their desserts but one of my friends told me that its equally good.
Coming to the end ie the dessert it was just too good. Tried 5 out 6 of their kulfis(left the chocolate one) which were simply mind blowing. All the other items in were good too. 
A place worth visiting if you are a real foodaholic.

Kebabs, kebabs, kebabs, kebabs and sweet dish. 

That is a list of all the things I've ever had at BBQ nation. The franchisee needs no introduction in case of quality of food or in the case of service as both are amazing. 

The food is amazing and we usually fast for a day before we go here to extract maximum value for money :P 

All in all, a pretty great place if you feel like hogging and then feeling as though you're in a food coma for the next 6 hours.

This restaurant is arguably the best in Kolkata for buffet. They have a wide variety of starters. I liked prawn fry the most.¬†

The promptness of service is good here considering the high stature of this restaurant.

I'd recommend to visit this restaurant at least once for lunch/dinner buffet. It is however advisable to make reservations before hand as it's very difficult to get a seat here instantly and staffs are less cooperative to give you a seat (even if it's available) if you are less in number as they anticipate to give the seat to groups with more persons.

I previously visited the Park Street outlet of Barbeque nation and i was mesmerized by the entire package,the food to the staff to the decorum to the ambience-all complimented each other.So with huge expectations i decided to try out the Salt lake outlet,but was highly disappointed.
1.The kababs were not well cooked,the fish had a kind of stingy smell
2.The prawns were not of a reddish colour so the flavour could not come out
3.The variety in main course was very less
4.The staffs were serving very quickly and would not give u tym to have ur meal heartily
5.The coolfi counter wasnt well managed.
Thus to conclude Barbeque nation is at its best in Park Street...the salt lake outlet does break ur heart..

We treated ourselves here in marriage anniversary lunch.... The opulence of kebabs was simply breathtaking, if not new for we had experienced it before at Flame & Grill.

I do see nice reviews about this place. But my experience wasn't that good right from the beginning. By the time we reached it was already full so we had to wait now waiting was not the issue but the way they were allotting the seats was not organized. Then when we finally entered there was absolute chaos inside. We liked to order a drink and we had to request a lot to even get the menu card. Then came the started which was the only good part of the whole afternoon,  right after the starters the main course was so Bland n the taste of the food wasn't good and the options provided wasn't good either. Overall just the starters and the desserts were good. Not a good experience at all. I along with my friends have also been to the park street outlet which at least has far more space and far more options in the main course as well. So I don't think m planning another outing to this outlet again.

This place was the first one where I went to this franchise probably 8-9 years ago. Since then I have been visiting this place and must say amazing place. Love the food. Franchisee doesn't need any introduction or special mention. Love their services and food options. I would say it's a must try for anyone and everyone!

The best buffet in the town specifically starter and desert dishes but main course dishes are very bad. The ambience, hospitality is very nice. The starter dishes are just awesome. Beautiful kababs whether its prawn or fish or chicken each and every thing is good. Desert dishes are fabulous huge collection of kulfi must have. Its 800 per head without drinks though they will give a complimentary one.

Its all about our team lunches and the unlimited buffets. The barbequed meat, sea foods (sadly Prawn only), the unlimited starters...its just lavishing!! Frankly, I don't like the main courses there..I only go for the grilled starters and wide range of deserts.

Last week I went there and tried some of the veg starters like grilled mushroom, grilled fruits (Guava, Pineapple) which is good.

Ambience wise and staff service- its great..no place of finding the flaws there. Place is well decorated and has lots of seating capacity. Staffs behaviour is good enough. As an incident, I don't like too much of spicy food, I requested the same to staff. They are happy to help me enough and provided me the same grilled items with less spices. A great place for your perfect lunch.

Do try their Pan flavoured kulfi..(Image attached)

P.S-¬†
1. Don't forget to reserve your seat a day before visiting. Else, you will be in a long queue.
2. Don't forget to reserve your cab..You will definitely need it after your lunch..:P

Quality food , tbh. I generally take the buffet here and I've been to this place quite a number of times. I loved the restaurant , from the food quality to the staff. I have this thing for Barbecues , and so far BBQ nation makes pretty good reshma kebabs. The price in the weekdays is quite affordable and I would love to try out their park street branch too.

Among desserts dont miss hot gulabjamoons. New addition is the kulfi counter serving you 6 varieties of delicious kulfies after a heavy dinner.. Or lunch.. And that makes it more special... And adds to it the live music in eve.. Great place..really..

best place for a fast but a proper lunch... situated beside RDB, Mushroom starters are one of the best, dont get carried away by having a drink at the start as you might kill ur hunger :P ¬†fruit and kebab starter are good but X factor is missing. Tend to have only the starter as main course is generally not that exciting, desert needs improvement in taste.

Foodie? You literally cannot afford to miss this place! You'll get the best buffet you can get in the whole city. Well, we had non-veg dinner buffet for 6 people & veg buffet for 4, ended up paying something around 7500/- (all including taxes). Starting from the starter you'll get a long variety of unlimited kebabs (fish,chicken,prawn,mushroom,pineapple,paneer,mutton) with 4 kinds of dip. In the main course you'll get biriyani/pulao, the choice is yours. besides you can have lemon chicken soup or sweet corn soup with toasted bread. As I was more focused on the dessert part, I missed a few items. I had chocolate moose, phirni, mini gulabjamun (*mouthwatering*), pastries, and few more which I didn't notice as I was completely full by the time. The staffs are very nice and though it was a bit crowded, the service was fast. I loved this place, definitely coming again.

All praises seem less for this place it seems with every visit. The durga puja special festival was on and it was on in grand style indeed. The renowned open grill had the usual run of chicken, fish and prawns, which were delicious,  specially the fish and prawns. The special addition in the festival was the tandoori pomfret, a very well prepared and presented dish indeed. Then came the turn of the main course  (after a never ending line up of starters ). The bhapa illis was perfect and so was the prawn malai curry. In the desserts, the fruit truffle and chocolate brownie along with the live kulfi counter deserve special honours. To top it all, we even got a birthday cake complimentary for my cousin's birthday. A very satisfactory visit as always.

In simple words the best buffet in town. The main course is generally skipped by all to enjoy and immerse themselves in the crispy starters and finally finish it off with a mango flavoured kulfi. The festival time is an even better time to visit here as you get to try dishes from round the globe with different varieties.

Exquisite food decent ambience & wonderful service these are the things that defines this place. Visited this place on multiple occasions. The starters are mouthwatering whether it is the chicken kebabs fish kebabs or prawns. They will just melt once it reaches our mouth. Coming to the main course , here you will find a plenty of options both veg and nonveg. I usually prefer to have the Dum Biryani along with the mutton side dish and chicken salad. Finally the dessert section is a pure bliss. Starting with kesar kulfi, anguri gulb jamun,walnut pastry ice cream kulfis. They will also offer you a complementary drink. And another plus point of this place is that  the waiters are very courteous and attentive. At last i can only say that if its buffet its barbeque nation.

This was my first visit to the BBQ nation at Kolkata. I have been to BBQ nation at Bangalore (5 branches) and Mumbai (2 branches). With the hope of getting something new to see at Kolkata, but as usual everything is the same starting from the starters to the main course. If you have never visited BBQ nation before, you will definitely like for the first couple of times but after that you will get bored with the same menu. One thing is common at all BBQ nation branch is that, the main course is not good. They should focus on the main course as well on desserts, although the starters are good.

In mood for a lavish buffet? Drop in. Located in Salt Lake Sector - 5, this place is hard to miss. However, be prepared to wait for a while to get a table, this place is usually crowded.¬†

A pretty decent buffet spread, and the starters just keep on coming. Chicken, Fish, Mutton you name it, they have it. By the time you reach the Main course, you'll already be full. :P
Desserts is one section they can improve upon, they have those regular pastries, doesn't even look that appetizing.¬†

Starters - 5/5 (Lots to choose from, they're usually delectable)
Main Course - 3.5/5 (Pretty good)
Desserts - 2.5/5 ¬†(Could improve on the quality of the desserts)
Ambiance - 3.5/5
Service - 4/5

Everytime I eat here I am literally more than satisfied! Their service is surprisingly prompt even during rush hour. Their spread of course has so many items that you are overwhelmed everytime. I personally am never prepared for the deluge of food. But yes my theory is go for the starters and dessert (cause theyre really good) leave little room for the main course and try the mushroom and prawn dish. They are major hits always. Ive visited on more than one of their festivals out of which the thai festival was definitely the most memoreable! 

Also on birthdays and or anniversaries these guys go out of their way to make u feel special with deicated performances (by the inhouse band at night) and possibly also cake!

Best buffet restaurant at Kolkata. All the items are very good. Special attraction, different flavor of kulfies. Pan masala flavor is the best. Once I felt prawn kabab is little bit salty. I told that to one of the staffs. The owner came to me and served new kabab by his own and that was good. Really appreciate that :-)

Best place in Sector V area to have a sumptuous buffet! We went there for our team lunch in a group of 14 people. The starters were simply out of the world - Achari Fish kebab, Prawn kebab & chicken wings being my personal favorite. The choice in main course was rather limited and quality wise the items were average in taste. Mutton roganjosh was an exception with its extremely well cooked soft & succulent mutton pieces. The deserts again matched the standards set by the starters. Here I loved the Firni & got ecstatic about the special Pan kulfi. Overall - a very good dining experience. Will definitely recommend to visit üëç

Situated at the heart of Sector-V, Barbeque Nation is one of the finest places in the city to have buffet. The place was full of people when we reached there. Starters were delicious, serving a variety of items of Chicken, Fish, Prawns, Paneer and Mushrooms. We were also served a round of complimentary drinks of our choice. The main course wasn't that good. Chicken Biryani was good but rest of them didn't live upto the expectations. The desserts was the best thing. There was a plethora of choices. There were tarts, gulab jamun, pastries, two flavours of ice cream, phirnee, fruit cakes and fresh fruits. There was a live kulfi counter as well. Overall experience was lovely! The staffs were friendly. Would love to drop by soon.

Visited this place for the second time last month. It was truly a great dining experience. All the kebabs were cooked to perfection. The prawn was exceptionally good and a tad bit different. The mutton sheekh kebab was a bit though, but they replaced it and gave fresh ones on request. ¬†The mutton dak bunglow in the main course needs special mention. It was perfectly spiced, the biriyani served with it was light and very flavourful. Now coming to the best part of the dinner, the desert counter! They had a wide range of deserts. From hot gulab jamuns , caramel custard, ¬†american brownie to blueberry cheesecake, everything was fantastic. They also had a live kulfi counter and the chocolate kulfi, topped with chocolate sauce and choco chips was sinful ! The live karaoke added a whole new dimension to the dinner. I would definitely recommend it to all the foodies.

bhapa.The tandoori items,prawn fry,pineapple dish,masala potato,plain rice,dal,mutton Kasha..the list goes on and on..every item tastes beautiful and moreover it's less oily and healthy..the desert section too deserves a mention esp the variety of kulfis on offer..I will make it a point to visit here again and would recommend it to others too.

I like this restaurant for their hospitality and quality of food. Been there on Saptami afternoon for lunch. They have priced there buffet higher 1103pp as some new items were added in the menu for Durga puja festival such as pomfret fry, vapa hilsa, chingri malaicurry etc.

As usual all items were very good to eat. Desert counters were awesome.

My appetite was fully satisfied. Liked BBQ very much.

Only problem is I never can book a table by there apps or over the phone as it was always booked in advance.

Dropped in on a Friday night and was lucky enough to get a seat straight away. It's a tastefully decorated family restaurant with live music too. The best part about the buffet is the huge range of assorted dishes you will have on the menu on any given day. Usually, my only crib point is that I get full even without trying half the things. It really is the best buffet in town and the paan flavoured kulfi at the end is exquisite. I gorged on the starters, there were all sorts of kebabs..fish, chicken, lamb, prawn et all.. adn moved on straight to the desserts with just a taste of the dum biriyani and mutton dak bunglow from the main course. There are also live pasta counters for the Italian lovers. Last, but not the least, the staff is literally trying to stuff you with the food. Even when you say no, they will try to persuade you to have just a little bit more...quite in the fashion of Bengali moms. Over all, a lovely experience that I look forward to again.

This place really deserves to be the highest rated restaurant, at least in Kolkata. Only thought that came across my mind is how can you get so much food with so less money.. In one word this place is my personal favorite. I would suggest to devour the starters and the desserts, as you can get the main course in any other place. 
One main thing that made me fall in love with this place is the behavior of the waiters.. They were so humble. Even the cook came out and asked us and others about the food and if any suggestions for improvements. Though I frankly had no suggestions for them. I just thanked him for the food and the overwhelming courtesy that I received. I couldn't find any single flaw in Barbecue Nation..

Well what to write about it and what not to write about it. 

This will probably in 5th most visited restaurants of mine. I have been visiting this restaurant since it opened in BIPL Gamma building. Since then every time I come here I be happy, mesmerized but little bit 'tired' at the end by eating so much :D. This is probably eaters' paradise.

This is probably the first restaurant in Kolkata that bring in the 'style' of barbeque into the table, as prior to that I've never seen anything like this. This concept was itself a hit. I believe that was 2008-09. They not only introduced this 'barbeque' at desk concept but actually changed the whole idea about buffet.

At that time probably price was 299/- for 5 starters, 3 non-veg and 2 veg. Yes quite cheaper compared to what it is now. At that buffet was at places like BB's, Afraa, RHCP (name has changed now) etc. But no one near to Barbeque nation. They never had to look back since then.

Every time I visit this eatery, I get amazed. Sometimes with introduction of some special menu, sometimes due to staffs behavior and way of taking feedback or sometimes with the themes the follow. I remember one day their floor in charge came to us to take some feedback about the food. I said that Tandoori chicken was bit half cooked, but rest were really good. So to address this, came back with a special dish of dry chili chicken, "this is our today's special menu" - he said. And believe me it was marvelous. Even after putting hell lot layers of taste of starters my taste buds were able to relish it. 

Now they have introduced many more items in the desert section. Kulfi is probably is another feather to their success cap. Especially the 'girl' at kulfi counter at park street branch. "Sorry, sec - V boys at kulfi counter, she is really a Shifu in this department." 

So basically as the rating suggests, this is simply the best in town for last 8 years and I believe it will hold its spot due its service, food and innovations. To conclude, I would say if you ‚Çπ 700-800/per head to spend, and you can really eat (good food) then never think twice but go to Barbeque Nation.

A great place to have a sumptuous lunch and dinner. A restora well maintained and well decorated , and the beauty of the place is further enhanced by the hospitality of the people over there. From welcome drinks to deserts everything is so delicious that out taste buds will yearn for having the food again and again. I would recommend each and every person to try this out.

This is the best buffet place in Kolkata, period. Visited this place numerous times and their service exceeds expectation.  Only drawback is the taste gets you after you visit it for more than four times. A change in taste is always appreciated.. but still a very good place to go

It was special puja pricing was going on today....
The price was hiked to 1103/- from 732/- for non -veg lunch and for veg it was 900/-... which is a bit far I guess... otherwise it was an awesome experience...the food, the services was all great...as usual....

You can never find a better restaurant in Kolkata if you are a kebab fan. Awesome food and super awesome staff behaviour. On top of that they don't take tips. Even the chef came and asked us whether we would like any change in spice or salt in our kebab. ¬†Lebanese fish and Peshwari tangri was excellent in starters. And i loved Chicken Dum Biriyani, Balti Murg, Shikari Gosth in main course . Its very hard to decide whether to concentrate on the kebabs or main course or the desserts. It is a must try restaurant and i don't think there is any restaurant in Kolkata that comes even close to BBQ nation in terms of food and quality of service.

I have lost track of the number of times I have been to this place. And each and every time was totally worth it. Food especially the barbeques are awesome. But the best part is their service and the customization. And the live music that goes with the dining experience is so so good. For my child they will go ahead and prepare non spicy ones, which my son devours. My husband prefers extra spicy which they also pay heed to. I have never seen any other restaurant doing this. One of my favorites in Kolkata...I would recommend one and all to visit this place once for sure to take in the experience...

Amongst the crazy traffic and busy IT and corporate life of sec v there are numerous eating joints but none like this.. the place serves some lip smacking starters .. and you know it when you are a non-vegetarian and you can't stop yourself from eating veg food as well.. Cajun spiced potato, mutton seekh kebab, honey soya, chicken tangri kebab, the list goes on, piece of advice go there when you are extremely hungry coz you would regret missing a single item later .. undoubtedly the best buffet in town

A single word review should be there... Awesome, delectable food. The starters are like mind blow be it prawns, mushrooms, chicken, mutton or fish all tastes yummilicious.. All I like about this restaurant is they are for their customers.. Once we didnt like their mocktail and they gave complimentary drinks to both of us.. Another day the waiter broke a stack of plates just next to us where we were sitting.. For that also they gave us complimentary drinks..
Great going BBQ nation...!!

If kashmir is the paradise in earth then this is too paradise for the foodies.  Being a foodie the buffet always makes me so relieved and happy. The starters and the desert section is to die for. Specifically the masala corn, the prawn, and the mutton kabab is just heavenly good. The only thing that bothers a bit is the main course. The main course dishes are not up to the mark and not really tasty somedays. This should not be a problem if you are already full with kababs and the little space there can be filled up with the awesome desert

Well there is nothing that I don't like about bbq nation. But I don't know if service, style and etiquettes while welcoming and during the course of dining experience differs from city to city.
I have been to bbq nation quite a number of time in Mumbai and expected the same hospitality, elegance and style here in Salt Lake which I found is totally missing.

May be I have been spoilt with the courtesies rendered by the boys in bbq nation mumbai which I now wonder whether that was an overdose making me feel not-so-good during my visit to this place in Salt Lake.

No greetings at the door, no one introduced himself with his name as the service guy who will take care of this table and us as guests on that occasion. All they asked was "veg or non-veg" and "shall we start"? And then it started so heavily that just killed the fun. Every time a guy would come with skewers and just dump them over the mini charcoal pot - without even asking. Felt like they were in a hurry to get over with it. 
All the starters were good but very spicy. There was nobody who showed any courtesy nor asked even a simple thing as "is the taste alright for you"?
We were there for a birthday celebration.
The way the cake was served and presented..... it ruined each and every good feeling I had towards this restaurant.

The cake was served abruptly in between when we were ON our main course. It was dropped on the table quickly and the guy vanished even quicker from the spot. Now we felt so stupid as to "what to do" in that situation. Then after about good 2 to 3 mins this guys returns back to light the candle. The  live singer then took two names whose birthday was being celebrated. And he sang a birthday song which felt DULL. Unlike Mumbai and I am sure many other places, the service boys didn't gather and never came together to clap with us making that Birthday Girl feel Special!!!!! It's really sad to compare and see vast difference in two different places. 

I will keep loving bbq nation as I just love the food and ambience all over.

I think the bar is bit higher in other places.

I could finally make it here on my brother's birthday to try their lunch buffet! I would suggest table reservation because in spite of it being a weekday lunch buffet- I couldn't find a place in the 12.30-2.30 slot!
üëâFor starters we had(There is a live grill set at the table where prepared items are placed)-
In Non veg
Malai chicken,achari fish,coastal bbq prawns,mutton Lebanese seekh kebab and Hyderabadi wings!
Mutton seekh Lebanese was the best one out of the lot! Malai chicken was extremely soft and melted in mouth - achari fish was decent ,I didn't like the Hyderabadi chicken wings much and the prawn was bland.The manager actually came up to us to ask if any dish needed change so I asked for spicier version of prawn and my request was taken care of ASAP!
In veg
Bbq grill veg,Lahori mushroom,spinach paneer tikka,cajoon spice baby potato,hare mattar ki tikki.
Bbq grill veg comprised of grill corn and pineapple - very tasty and unique.
I liked Cajoon spice baby potato the best! We couldn't try hare mattar ki tikki as we were too full...so it is recommended that all the varieties of starters are asked for at first and then then best ones can be repeated!
The basic rule of live grill is that the starters are going to be continuously served unless the flag at the table is put down!
üëâWe were served a complimentary drink and were given a few choices-( fresh lime soda,aam panna,beer)
My brother chose fresh lime soda while I chose aam panna.Unfortunately both of us were served fresh lime soda üòû Nevertheless the fresh lime soda was good! üòÉ
üëâFor main course there were about 15 items including both veg and non veg! I loved their almond broccoli soup,mutton begam ki pasand and fish Kolhapuri!All the items were good but nothing compared to the starters!
üëâDessert section was not as impressive as the spread compared to both starters and main course was less.
There were about six varieties of kulfi,white forest pastry,moong dal halwa,mawa slice cake,two in one cheesecake,phirnee,two flavours of ice cream(vanilla and strawberry),fresh cut fruit,some pudding and gulab jamun.
I tried the chocolate kulfi and was disappointed while the moong dal halwa , pudding and phirnee made my day! The moong dal halwa is the best halwa I have ever had while the pudding had a certain crunch that took the taste to an entirely new level the phirnee too had almond slices that tasted very well!
They had also provided a complimentary birthday cake as it was my brother's birthday and it was very tasty!!
I would like to mention that apart from the excellent food served one also gets to experience their top notch service! There may be little mistakes here and there but right from making customers comfortable to even Calling up to take personal feed backs-They deserve every bit of the high rating that they have received in zomato!
A MUST visit for all!! üòÉ

If you don't visit really really early, you are surely not going to get a table without waiting for a long time. Specially on weekends! My kind suggestion is not to visit without prior booking. (They have an app now and the booking has become really very easy). 
Well, this one is not a regular review but a comparison between the two branches of barbeque nation, Kolkata.
The park street branch is more spacious, more accessible for those who stay outside salt lake and even outside Kolkata. Taking a 10min walk from park street metro station will lead you to the park street branch whereas you have to invariably depend on auto-rickshaw or cab to reach this salt lake branch. There is a very miniscule chance that you have to wait for a table at park street branch. 
But somehow I find the staffs to be more courteous than those of the park street branch. Food are equally good at both the places. 
EARLY BIRD DISCOUNT is available here for lunch but the same offer is available only for dinner in the other branch.
The only complaint that I have about barbeque nation is that the main course they serve is always an utter disappointment except on the food festivals.

There's nothing more to say bout this fabulous restaurant chain. Have visited this place a plenty of times and each time it was a different and pleasurable experience. Barbeque Nation never ceases to amaze me be it with buffet menu, live grill, happy hours or the amiable hospitality. Never seen the chef himself interacting with each and every guest even in the busiest hours and the ever smiling hosts taking care of smallest needs. It's not at all an exaggeration to say it's the best destination in the city to enjoy a hearty meal especially with a large group. Wish you all the best.

After visiting Park st branch with my family now it's turn for EP GP block Sector V branch on a Saturday lunch with friends. It is not so spacious like park st. We took aampanna n soda lime as complementary drink. Like previous one just again a wonderful blend of sweet n sour. All types of veg n non veg kebabs we tasted. Potatoes n special chicken items in starter were much better than park st outlet. Mushrooms in veg were also better than park st. Fish, prawns, chicken wings, pineapple n crispy sweet corn, paneer were like before.. As I told to my friends that main course will be not so good and it was proved right. Fish hioisin sauce or biriani or any other veg n non veg dishes were not at all good in taste. I just only took some chicken salad, Russian salads, methi chicken n papod. All r so so in taste. Now for dessert section it was little bit disappointing to my friends. In park st branch dessert section we enjoyed a lot. I did not find shwarma roll counter here..Only they like gulab jamun, firni n kulfi..We stayed there 1.30 pm to 4 pm n continue or gossip with all these heavy foods. Staffs were I think more attentive in park st branch despite of heavily crowded park st outlet...Over all it was nice experience for my friends for their first time visit...

Too Perfect!

This place is well known for its buffet.Yes,it's really the best place to have the buffet.I went there with two of my colleagues for lunch on sunday.

Ambience:You will find too many people in weekends.But the maintenance is in such a way you could enjoy your food and your gang without any disturbance.Overall ambience is very good, perfect music.

Stuffs and Serviece:  Stuffs are very well behaved and good.Serviece is prompt.One thing here if you do not book your seat beforehand, you may have to wait for a longtime outside for your turn.

Cleanliness: Very clean and maintained.

Food:All the starter iteams of buffet are brilliantly good and tastey.Main courses of buffet is not that much attractive.Desserts are delicious.You must try the Kulfis.

Considering everything I can give this place 4.5 out of 5.

I have been here multiple times and they have maintained their top notch quality n service. Its the best place for a grill buffet. Their fish n prawn starters are amazing. I also love the pineapple grill. The next thing which is special here is the kulfi counter n I am a big fan of their pan kulfi. The main course n dessert are also good but ones gets overly stuffed with starters. The ambience is also good staff is polite n helpful.only area they can improve is making sure that prawn starters are available without any breaks. Otherwise a fabulous place which never Disappoints!

One of my most often visited Indian buffet restaurants.Situated right in the heart of sector 5 it's mostly thronged by the IT crowd.Be it anytime of the day it's very unusual to get this place less crowded.
In the past couple of years the prices have shot so high that they have opened Early Bird hours aka Happy Hours,Mon-Thurs.If you can get yourself seated here by 12:30PM then the buffet price drops down to 632 inclusive of all taxes.
Since I've been here innumerable times hence can easily draw a comparison between AS WAS and AS IS. Today the lunch buffet wasn't that great. The service was below average.The assortment of chicken and fish served in the buffet was poor.The earlier mutton sheekh kebab has been replaced with some other mutton prep and that isn't tasty at all.The cajun spice potato and the sweet corn still hold the old glamour.Both the chicken and fish kebabs were tasty.The fish especially was tender and spicy.But my fav' was Masala Chicken Wings: Spicy tantalising and moreish.Another interesting starter was the Pineapple on tandoor.Very innovative and absolutely a delight to all the pineapple lovers.Little sour,tangy with the flavour of the hot charcoal.
Main course was again the same,nothing extraordinary. I enjoyed the seafood salad the most. Fish fry was poor,especially the curry leaves flavor was totally uncalled for. The biryani was average.
Dessert was of ample variety-firni,ice creams,kulfi,rabri, pastry,brownies,cantaloupe and water melon.The faluda-topped kulfi is served in multiple flavours-chocolate,pan masala and the one without any flavor.
          This place used to outnumber all other restaurants in this area only with the amazing diversification in starters and dessert.But today didn't find the starters that appealing. The desserts still hold their position high.No wonder their service has dropped.We had to push the waiters to bring in the new starters, there wasn't any enthusiasm at their end.So BBQ either you drop your prices throughout or improvise on the service and food quality and diversity.

The first thing that I noticed on a weekend afternoon was the buzz and the sound of cutlery. It was my first time at this place. I had heard a lot about this place. Finally it was my turn to try this place out.
The best thing about this place is the service and the personalized attention. We went during their lunch service hours. Stepped in late. Took our own sweet time to finish our food but not even for once did I sense getting irate or disturbed. By the way they served the food and literally cajoled us into taking second helpings and also trying out different options, i was one superrrr se bhi uperrr wala happy guest.The management and the staff have taken service to an altogether different level here. I would rate it 5/5 for service itself.

now for the fun as well as the most important part. Food......

there are small charcoal grills set in the middle of each table wherein pre cooked veg and no-veg items were being put on the grill after having been skewered. the size of the veg or non-veg items were all bite sizes which I liked but I would have loved them to be more tender. the different options for sauces and marinades that were laid out on the table did not excite me. once you are down with the bbq's you can flag down and move onto the buffet section. I specially loved there dessert bar.

Now answering the most important question... Shall I visit there again??? I would certainly do so.

The obvious favourites of course are their entr√©es. The barbecues. The grills. By whatever name they are called, they are undeniably one thing - delicious.

I'm personally not a great fan of their main courses. So I skip directly to the desserts. Which are the second high point of the meal. I'm especially smitten by their cr√®me br√ªl√©e. And their pastries are quite excellent too!

All in all, whenever I'm at Barbeque Nation, I forget if I'm at a restaurant or in heaven! üòÉ

Went yesterday, it was a Sunday. Went for a Non veg buffet...it was really awesome. The Chief himself came and asked if there was anything we need or if there was any special we want or not. The ambiences was marvelous and the best part was the hospitality rather than food. If the question comes for food one better be prepared because the food will always win over you if you start a fight. There are three course of meal. The attractive yet dangerous starter. The long and heavy main course and the light yet beautiful dessert. If you are going for the first time my suggestion would be target any one of the course because you will be exhausted in no time. If you are a really foodie try all but one can not finish Barbeque nation in one visit. If there is any special occasion there will be a complimentary cake at the end of your meal. Any ways this restaurant has a different feeling altogether from different prospective by different customers. I can assure you it has that ambiences to bring the WOW factor in. That was my review. And All the Best to those who gone visit.

There are few restaurants about which what ever you say never seems to be sufficient. And this is one of that. Went with my friends. Had a lot of starters. Amd then main course was OK.  Then again dessert was again good.

This restaurant chain serves only buffet. We took non-veg buffet. Awesome grilled kababs. You get one complementary drink. Awesome desert items. You get choice of 5 flavors of kulfi. We loved the kulfis. We were not much into the main course. You must have a  prebooked reservation; must for weekends. Good service.

I love Barbeque Nation. It's a good lovers delight. Whether you are veg or non- veg, they offer you exquisite dishes to fulfill all your gastromic needs. Their service is at par with the best hotels and restaurants. They make sure your palate is never empty. A place where you can enjoy food to the fullest.

My all time favourite joint for kebabs located beside the adlabs. This is the oldest joint in the city - a perfect place to taste wide varieties of veg and non veg kebabs that the city has gifted to the kebab lovers.

They serve the best starters ever!! A wide range of kebabs and tandoor delights in form of Chicken, Mutton, Fish and Prawn, the starters are literally sufficient for an overfeeding meal. The Veg starters are no less. They altogether give new flavour to vegetarian tandoor items. Main course was too much for me to eat anymore and deserts were too good .

Since it was just a stone throw away from my previous office complex, I used to visit this place quite often for dinner or lunch with friends and colleagues. And I'd say, every time I had the buffet, I used to wonder how can my stomach gets bigger than its normal size. If you like kebabs, this is the perfect place for you. 

They serve 8 items as starters and that's the best part. The kebabs are so delicious that in one visit we went on to have the desserts just after the starters skipping the main course :). I'll always recommend this place as an option for eating out.

Barbecue nation is well known as the best buffet place in town. This outlet is located in the heart of the  IT sector in Kolkata in the ground floor of RDB Bolevard. It is very easy to locate. The staff is very courteous and the service is good . The kebabs which are the starters are amazing. They have the perfect tandoor flavour to it. Especially the prawn kebab needs a special mention. The main course is very good as well but not as good as the starters. The desert on the other hand is amazing again. The small gulab jamuns are delicious and melts in the mouth. You can easily pop 3 to 4 of these tiny gulab jamuns. They have a variety of starters,main course and deserts. On weekends this place is always full and they even have live performances on some weekends which is a cherry on the cake. This place is surely recommended .:)

Well, when its comes to good food , I am a fan of Barbeque Nation, irrespective of the location becoz¬†food in each establishment is palatable.¬†
Talk about food, ambiance or staff , you can easily give 4/5 to each.
Situated in the heart of salt lake which gives the restaurant an added advantage.
Pre- booking in the weekend is advisable.

I had never eaten at a buffet in any restaurant before because I wasn't quite comfortable with the menu or the buffet setup in particular.
However , this place really changed my mindset about buffet lunch .
I went during the festive season. The crowd was spot on.these are the times when you actually get to test the service and the quality of food.

The menu was simply huge. Around 10 to 12 starters , yes that's the number of the veg starters. For non vegetarians , the list still continued.
Then was the lunch , which had a lot of options again.

I am somebody who is not fond of kulfis at all but here , I tried around 4 varieties and all of them were simply awesome.they had a total of seven though.
Ice creams , brownies , fruits and what not !
The dessert section was huge.

It's a must visit.
Worth your money.
Actually over worth.

Overwhelming assistance from the ataff and the management. Highly impressed.

As rightly stated in the "Known For" Section, Barbeque Nation indeed provides the Best Buffet in Town!! I have been visiting this place ever since it opened up in Kol. Been here many times and never got tired of it.

Served continuosly over the grill on the table, they serve the best starters ever!! A wide range of kebabs and tandoor delights in form of Chicken, Mutton, Fish and Prawn, the starters are literally sufficient for an overfeeding meal. The Veg starters are no less. They altogether give new flavour to vegetarian tandoor items. (I keep on asking for the American Corn and Potato) They actually go by the phrase "All You Can Eat" in literal sense.

Well, finally when you're done with their mouthwatering starters, you put the flag on the table down indicating it's time for the Main Course. Well, the Buffet offers quite a good spread. But after all the starters, I can never make to the Main Courses properly. Only Biryani with some gravy works for me, although I always keep the reserved space for their desserts which are just too good, specially the Ice Cream, Cheesecake, Brownies, Pudding, Pastries etc....just yummm!!

Well, that was all about the Food part from my end. Now here goes about the ambience. This place is well suited for Fine Dining. The ambience is quite sober. The best part I like is the Live Performance over here. That really rocks!!! The Singer last time was just too good and OMG! the tracks he performed!! I really couldn't believe it, one after another of my most favourite songs...Careless Whisper, Everything I Do, Words, Last Christmas....lovelyyyy!! I just love their performance. This is actually a place with class! Another notable thing about them is that they don't accept tips. Even if you offer them tips for their services, well, you're refunded with the same. Quite notable, I must say.

Overall, a really classy place which has always given me a high level of satisfaction....always a positive experience.

PS: If it's your Birthday, be ready to get surprised by a special Birthday Cake from their end. :)

Lastly, I realise this is the longest review I've ever written for any restaurant on Zomato! :)

Unlike my previous experiences in this very restaurant, my last visit went as a downer. We were ten of us very confident to savour the best buffet in town but I don't know what went wrong that day. Each and every item served either seemed stale, undercooked or just bad in taste. The manager replaced it everytime but just not a single serve was good as it used to be. Wrapping up with starters rather quick we went ahead with main course. Which saved the show. But something was wrong. What we all came back with was a bout of upset stomach each. I hope this was a one timer and obviously I will visit again. Hoping to come back to this review then and give it a full fiver. Coz this place was really really good before.

This place had been in my wishlist for ages. Couldn't make it till today. We had the perfect blend of "barbeque" non veg items with traditional indian biriani and we enjoyed every bit of it. The main course was sort of okayish as compared to the starters. Though the desserts were just excellent. Kudos to all the staffs for making it an enjoyable "foody outing"....

Counts among the best Buffets in town!  Undoubtedly they serve great starters and the Kebabs are just finger linking. The main course also has a variety of options which also includes a great number of salads. The desserts are again another set of attraction. Starting from live kulfi counter to gulab jamuns to firni to cake to custard to ice cream...they have it all. 
The buffet price is definitely worth it,  especially when you are an early bird. 
Overall a great place for buffet!

I really love Barbecue Nation. However, this branch off bbq was not up to the mark if we compare it to the other branches I visited (Guwahati, Delhi). Firstly, this place needs a renovation. The walls look shabby. Secondly, the waiters should allow the customers to at least breathe when they are serving the starters. They were in such a hurry that they ruined the moment pretty bad. The food was upto the mark as others but they did fail to give us a warmly ambiance. Disappointed!

I have visited this place several times, and never been disappointed. Today five of my friends and I visited for the lunch buffet. A special mention for the great staff, who were polite and accommodative. When a friend of mine found the grilled prawns too spicy, he was served specially made milder ones. My personal favorites in the starters are the prawn and mushroom. We didn't really try much of the main course and switched to the desserts, which were heavenly. Would definitely recommend a visit!

Honestly not the "best" buffet in town as people say. The non-veg starters had only one type of chicken kebab(small in size) but tastyyy, prawn kebab also tasty, but the basa fish they served was blunt in taste ,also the mutton kebab ws nt so good. Main was fabulous. Wide spread for mains. And the best part was the desert section. Aweeesomeeeee . so many options. Great dessert. But was expecting more variety in starters. Yup they also served complimentary soft drinks. Overall experience was good as the service was top notch. :)

Live chat counters had golgappa, papri chaat,  jalebi. The golgappa too tasted nice.
I was so full that I hardly could had main course. . but I couldn't afford to miss the heavenly desserts. There were almost 4 flavours of kulfi. I had paan flavour.
The shahi tukda N moong dal halwa was too too good... 
Last but not the least vanilla ice cream wid brownie !!!

Courteous staffs keep smiling throughout their service.

Both the outlets are great.
Some suggestions for further improvement:-
a)mutton seekh kebab can be replaced with som other grill.
b)Crab may be introduced in main course.
c)Hot chocolate sauce with ice cream is more preferable.

The prices vary drastically depending on days and hours but the spread is quite good and it justifies it's reputation every single time.

Although the table reservation might be a pain in the ass but one of the best places you can visit for a buffet outing because of the food and the wonderful ambience. I have been there many times and the singing performances during dinners are simply icings on the cakes.

This is in my top 5 favourite restaurants of kolkata. I love this place for the food and services it offers.

Ambience: The place has soft dim lights giving privacy. The restaurant is really busy so the place is always a little lively. Seat reservation is highly recommended even on weekdays because this place does NOT go empty at all. My rate : 8/10. The place is ideal for a sunday lunch, a birthday party or a get together.

Food: The starters are the celebrities of the entire course. The desserts cherry on the cake. These two sections will win your heart everytime you come. The fish kebabs are my favourite as they are very spft and juicy. The prawns are soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside crust. Shark meat is available sometimes... They are equally delicious. The chicken kebabs are also soft and spicey. I spend half the time gorging on starters. Even if you take non veg buffet you are still eligible to take a whiff of some of their veg items ... I always take the crispy sweet corn kernels..they are crunchy and sweet. They serve a light biriyani, which is actually a good idea because after the heavy starter you would want something to lighten up before you aim for the desserts. The mutton preps are to die for. They are soft juicy ,very tastey with a strong garlic taste... Try out their egg salad which I loved...although they change their salads all the time...then comes the desserts. Their desserts are one of the best. Especially the choco almond pie, souffl√©, the fruit salad, they also have a cake made of fruits and a wild colored creme top ... The tinny gulab jamuns are cute and very tastey...you'll love them... After tasting all of these you might skip the ice cream because they have a kulfi stand now that serves 6 flavours of kulfis that are simply mind blowing... I had the badam kulfi which is really good, the chocolate kulfi, the paan flavoured kulfi is a winner... The kulfi milk is really thik and condensed. The almond pie is one of my all time favourites...they keep brownies and firnis. They also keep shahi tukda, something you donot wanna miss. Their desserts are exquisite and very well prepared. The starters are lipsmacking. They also have 3 complementary drinks : a fresh lime soda, green mango panna and iced tea... Go for any...they are all refreshing and really tastey. I love the aam panna. But want to try the iced tea next time.

Overall : if you are looking for a place to throw a party or bring some friends or family for the first time ...then close your eyes and take 'em here...you will not regret it. Seat reservation is a must though. Rate: 10/10

This the best restaurant Kolkata have till now. Everything is so perfect here. First of all I should mention the awesome service by the waiters. Everytime we visited this place we were in large numbers but still they were quick in service. The food is cooked nicely and have excellent taste. There is a large variety of starters to choose from and each of them is fantastic. Because of these delicious starters I haven't been able to taste the main course much. Now moving on to desserts. This is my favorite part when I visit this place. This is one of the best part of this buffet. There is a huge number of desserts like cheese cake, muse, fruits, ice cream, sweets, etc. There is also a kulfi corner which is very nice. I visit this place at least 4-5 times every year.

Absolutely phenomenal. ¬†What more can I say. The buffet is unbelievable and the price they charge( Rs.733/- on weekdays) is peanuts for the quality they serve. Let's get into details, shall we?¬†

Firstly, it is recommended that you reserve a table, as the place is generally very busy, being IMO, the best restaurant in the city. We did so and were allotted one of the tables closer to the main exit, which was fine. Believe me, you won't have much time to take in the exquisitely decorated surroundings once the plethora of Kababs arrive at your table, steaming hot and smelling like culinary heaven. You will literally get an unlimited supply, ranging from Chicken, Fish, Prawn, Mutton. you name it. Our server, who was also absolutely excellent, even gave us an Aloo Kabab of some sort, generously dipped in mayo. ¬†All the Kababs are unbelievably good, beautifully succulent and soft. I am not a fan of prawns in any shape or form but even I sampled the prawn kababs and was bowled over.¬†

The downside to the Kababs being so vast in their supply yet so finger-licking good (Sorry KFC) was that we ended up eating too much of them, until we realized there was very little room for anything else. Personally, my belly occupies a rather large expanse and if mine wasn't big enough to accommodate all the Kababs, good luck to you all!

We went over to the main course and again, there was a wide assortment of items, ranging from salads, veggies, chicken, mutton, fish..you name it. The rice section had plain rice and a wonderful Chicken Biriyani which I sampled along with some Mutton Vindaloo. To be honest, the Vindaloo was the only let down of the afternoon for me. I also tried a bit of the Veg Au Gratin (who cares how it's spelled as long as it tastes delicious?) and the Paneer Tikka Masala, which were both very good in their own right. Unfortunately, my experience of the main course was limited to small portions of the above mentioned items, as I had already had a look at the dessert counter and heard a groan of excitement(that's how I choose to look at it!) from my stomach. ¬†My parents tried the rice, the fish and a few more of the veg stuff and were extremely satisfied.¬†

Now, the coup de grace. DESSERT! The Gulab Jamuns were incredible. Small balls of delight floating in a generous amount of sugar syrup. There was a fruit custard and a vanilla tart which I thought were okay, nothing special. The crowning jewel however, was the Chocolate Walnut Brownie, enriched by yours truly with an indulgent helping of chocolate sauce. Oh my Goodness, it was so good. I swear, if I wasn't already bursting at the seams, I would have probably had atleast 15 brownies instead of the solitary one I ended up having. There were also pastries (I tried one small chocolate one but there was strawberry and a few other flavors too), kheer, fresh fruits, ice cream and coolfies. Unfortunately, I didn't want my throat to join in the full blown rebellion that my stomach was threatening to launch, so I didn't sample the ice cream or the coolfies.¬†

Phew this was LONG. Anyhow, you all get my point. Barbeque Nation is absolutely awesome, represents value for money and in my opinion, is the best restaurant in Kolkata. The staff at the restaurant were always unfailingly polite and our server in particular, was an absolute gem. Not a bad word to say about this place.

I went there a month ago with my friends for the luncheon buffet.The buffet consist of a series of starters both vegetarian and non vegetarian followed by a section of scrumptious main course and an even better dessert.The dessert contains pastries,cakes,gulab jamuns,ice creams and whatnots.In the summer months,Barbeque Nation even arranges for a Kulfi stall which is absolutely recommended for all foodies.
The staffs are very helpful and the service is as quick as it can get.
The staffs even provide you with individual attention and make sure that you leave the restaurant content.
I absolutely love this place and would visit it again !

A lively place with an amazing setting, Barbeque Nation is one stop for all the fun.

Good food.
Intriguing ambience.
Live band.
Open kitchen (partly).
It has it all. Starters, Main Course and Desserts- all are delicious. It is a treat for both, vegetarians and non-vegetarians. 

If you haven't been here already, you're really missing on something very good.

Have been to this place quite a number of times but somehow haven't reviewed it before. But as they say, better late than never! 
This place offers one of the best buffets in town with not only its impressive ambience and courteous service but primarily because of the consistently delicious food they serve. From the diverse range of starters my favourites would be the lightly spiced prawns and the chatpata sweet corn. 
For all those who think that BN is only about starters n desserts, rethink. I loved the biryani, the crab masala, and some mixed veg recipe whose name I can't remember but it was scrumptious. Their menu changes sometimes n this was what I had the last time I'd been there.
Finally desserts are all good but special attention should be given to the phirni n the paan kulfi.
I hardly find any flaw in their food course except for a slight negligence in the salad section. But who cares when the rest of it is as good as travelling to food heaven ?

If you love your starters and can eat into an unlimited quantity of it, then look no further. Ambience good but had there been ¬†light it would have been better. ¬†Main course is buffet and serves many varieties.¬†
The starters ¬†and live barbecue keep on coming untill you ask them to stop. And once you are done with that then move on to the buffet counters for the main course. Andfinally the dessert counter choices starting from fresh fruits, gulab jamuns, 6 types of kulfis, cakes, brownies, ice creams etc

Its just too good to handle!!
 If you love your Kebabs and can gorge into an unlimited supply of it, then look no further!! Welcome drink (non alcoholic) is also served with starters. nice ambience soothing light. Very neat and clean! Main course is buffet and serves many varieties both veg and nonveg.  Stated with sweetcorn masala fry was just unexplainable and unexpectedly good. I never knew corn actually could be like this!! 
The starters live barbecue keep on coming and coming until you put the flag down (Literally). It will consist for chicken, fish, mutton and paneer and they are delicious and melt in our mouth types!! And once you are done with that then move on to the buffet counters for the main course which I might say is their weakest point. But the dessert counter again lifts it up with quite a bit of choice starting from fresh fruits, gulab jamuns, 6 types of kulfis, cakes, brownies, ice creams etc. The service is quick and top notch. Ambience is decent with live musicians most of the days.
Staffs are well behaved and very competent. Service is prompt. Ambience is cozy. Payment process is fast. 

One thing I must and should mention that staffs deny to take tips as they bill you service charge and it's again quite exceptional in India where tips practicing is very common and staffs are taking tips even after billing service charge. I am quite impressed. Hope to visit again soon. (Naw i became die heart barbequan)

My recommendation : try to hop in as early as possible specially if u visit Sunday/Saturday.When ever decide to visit you go just asap and Get ur sits reserved, or else visit next day üòëüòÅ

This place is at present my fav spot to hop on. Any occasion and its always the first option that comes in my mind. Writing a review would just be a failed effort to portrait the good times spent in here with some finger licking menu. The kabab, the one who hasn't been there yet please go and have it. The buffet manu has always been a balanced one and I like their menu selection. Love their deserts. They serve pretty good option to choose from but I'd recommend try all of em. :)
Have been there like 6-7 times in the last 6 months and the best part us their service. They do know how to provide good service. To me its a best option and I love it cause its pocket friendly. :) Hope to have some more menu and exotic desert to be added from the house and I'm not sure if they can someday come up with some turkey or similar menu for a family get together. If u can then sure u can count me in the waiting list. Keep serving good food. :)

Summary : When I first visited this place, I just said after completing my meal "ITS AWWWWWESOME !!!!!!!!".
Belive me, if u want to have buffet lunch/dinner in Kolkata with 100% value for money u should go here only.

Location : It is in Sector V, Saltlake, Kolkata, nearer to bus stopages SDF, WEBEL & College More.

Ambience : The restaurant is not as big as the park street branch, it is in the ground floor of a building, But there are properly accommodated seats to have ur food with ur frnds/family or collegues. Overall ambiance is good.

Food : Whenever I went there, always had buffet meal, never tried for ala carte. The meal starts with a welcome drink, follwed by Off the Grill & On the grill foods. On th grills u will have chicken kebabs , fish kebabs & prawns. Off the grills u will have fish, chicken tengri kebabs, mutton shami kebab & some veg items. These are ¬†starters....now u can move to main course, biryani, polau, rice every thing is there, mutton chicken fish what not !!! most of the foods are in Indian attire & delicious.

Well I am talking about non veg items only, veg buffets & veg main courses are also there.

They have a kulfi counter also, there are many many tyoes of deserts like hot gulab jamoon getting heated on a frying pan & many more.

All these items are in the buffet price

So go enjoy !!!

REMEMBER : Prior booking is mandatory, if u r going in a prime time, pls check with them. You can reserve seats by calling them. Big groups like frnds, office collegues have great opportunities to enjoy there.

Specials : Sometimes they arrange live music there, singers will entertain you a lot with great singing skills.

I am sorry for not uploading many pics this time, most of the pics are with collegues & not with foods, however uploading a live music glimpse. Hope u will enjoy.

So finally I get to visit this place...after hearing so much about it, I was very excited... This place is always full but luckily we had a table booked...starters are the main attraction here...they gave chicken kebabs ,fish , prawn ,lamb , sweet corn and chicken lollipops...all of them taste good....I wasn't that happy with the main course... It was limited and the taste was also very average.. But again the desert was out of the world....so many things they had...I will cut half a point for the main course but add half a point for the desserts.... Price value 100%...a must try if you want to hogg like a glut....üòÅ

No wonder it is the best place for food lovers in the town. Simply delighted at everything.  Every little detail put forward for the satisfaction of the customers.  From tremendous starters to finger licking main course and can't stop having desserts,  everything was simply superb. 
A hats down to the chef who personally comes and asks about the quality of food and when told that the fish was a little let down,  he specially sent a special course of fish for us and my God it was mind blowing.  
Raring to go back again.

So I went to BBQN after 2 years for the Delhi Khaogali Food Festival, and as per my expectations, the food quality and the variety did not change much, which is in a way a good thing. The  service was decent and the staffs were polite as usual. Loved the corn chat, spicy Cajun potatoes, fish tandoori, tangri kebabs. The mini mutton sheikhs were delicious. The chicken kebabs were usual. I have had better tandoori prawn in BBQN before.

The chicken shorba was pathetic. Amongst the main course I loved the shahi paneer, malai kofta, mutton pulav, mutton nihari. The chicken biryani was pretty basic. Did not try the fish and the chicken entr√©e.

The desserts were yummilicious, and were our second point of interest, after the starters. Starting from the gulab jamun to the badami halva, from the tiramisu to the firni, from the ice creams to the pastries, from the chocolate shots to the fruit salads and the shahi tukra, everything were spot on.

Eagerly waiting for a sea food festival, anytime soon.

I think this restaurant is at present best and value for money restaurant in Kolkata. I am simply delighted with the food and service! In very few places the Manager comes and asks " sir please tell us how to improve and where exactly are we lacking, your suggestion Sir". Yes this is the kind of service orientation here, that too in a place where hardly you could point out to anything!

Saviour for you when you are meat craving! And in term of taste they ask you about anything needs to be changed and they do change the spice level when ask so. I liked this branch better than the park street one more in term of taste. But this one is smaller compared to Park street one. I recommend prior reservation otherwise be prepared to wait for hours. They have this early offer where if you enter before 7:30pm you get buffer at low price. I liked the spread of main course too here. Frequently they organise food festival here where they introduce some speciality dish for the occasion. During the weekends in the evening they have this wonderful singers who sings and create a rocking atmosphere inside. You have other buffet place around barbeque nation but everyone is willing to wait in queue rather than opt for some other place and that's tell you everything.

Yet another foodathone, the standard of the grills are very consistent, savoured to the core. No doubts on the quality.
Cons - the menu lacks excitement and appeal, needs a change, the biryani on the buffet was absolutely not good, had a stale taste.
Generous deserts on display, some added tarts would do wonders.

Didn't want to give the 1 even to begin with. Barbeque Nation has been known till date to serve the best buffet with mouth smacking kebabs. But sad to say that management has been going on the downside for quite some time now. I had booked a table for 20 on 15th July and the booking was for 3rd August. I was confirmed the booking during Happy Hours which was again one of the main reasons for our lunch party. I have even received the message from Barbeque Nation regarding the same. 2 days back, their personnel called me up and said that they have a festival during that time and cannot provide us the Happy Hour amount. My question lies at one point only. Festivals do not spring up out of the blue. The decisions are taken much before which the Barbeque Nation person confirmed even. Then why was I confirmed the booking for Happy Hours when there was not any slot for the same.

The food here is so fresh and the setting/ ambiance so calm and tranquil that you feel its too good to be true. Service is easy and waiters are extremely polite. They know what they are doing.¬†
Starters, main course and desserts are all fantastic. Main course is great. Lightly spiced and ¬†and just goes with the flow. I can't describe how tasty and flavorsome the food is here. There is a rhythm to this place that I have not found anywhere in any restaurant. Every time I visit this place is like the first time.
Totally head-over-heels in love with this place.
Surely this place needs a five star rating. There is nothing quite like it. God bless!

And their food is just lip-smacking, specially their cashew spice potato and grilled fish. And the dessert section is also very tempting, including the kulfi bar. Paan mashala kulfi is an unique idea. And last time they served Malpoa and rabri, which was again mouth watering.
Visiting to this place is always a treat for your tastebuds.

One of the best places to go for a meal in a group. The ambiance is perfect, with the interiors decorated softly, and tables not too congested. I have never seen such variety in any other buffet, with each dish being extremely yummy. But the best thing about the place is the service. They make you feel at home every moment and you come out amazed and raving about the place.

I used to be a big fan of this restaurant.I visit there ¬†almost every month.But for the last one year,with every visit,I have realized that both the quality of food and the standard of service is degrading.

The waiters don't seem to be willing to serve what the diner wants.The last time I went I had to ask for prawns on the grill twice but they didn't seem to heed.They served it at the very end when we were almost full with all the others starters.I have no idea whether this is a cost cutting business strategy.

The buffet has also got nothing new in terms of the dishes being served.I once saw "aloo posto" on the menu. I mean seriously ??¬†

Another point is that they refuse to take reservations after 7 because of the early bird offer.Even if I don't want to avail that offer I am not allowed to book a table for a time later than 7.This is very inconvenient.

The only reason I give it a 3 on 5 (and not lower) is because of the dessert which I am very sure is also going to go down the drains very soon.

I wish the management at BBQ nation takes this into notice and lives up to the reputation it has created for itself over the last few years.

I absolutely love eating here. I've always opted for the buffet here. I love the starters. They serve a variety of grilled and barbecued prawn and chicken. This is more than enough to fill up your tummy and enchant your taste buds. I usually do not have much of the main course, but I do give the 'daal makhni'  and plan rice a try. Lastly I love the array of desserts. From gulab jamun to ice cream to souffl√© to pastries, they definitely leave you wanting more. The price is also absolutely minimal.

Where does a "Bhukkad" go when he/she has to satisfy the mind and not only the stomach...goes to Barbeque Nation...takes a non veg + sea food option and delves on fantastic "unlimited" starters till the time he/she feel that any more would mean you'll miss the main course and the deserts...and to add to that "Live Music" is also served fresh...

Visited this place a zillion times for office parties and what's better is someone else is paying...

Wonderful ambience... extraordinary starters and sumptuous deserts...

Main course can't say much as I could never control on the starters. I am sure it's good.

Loads of salad varieties and soups as well. You can order Tandoori rotis and nan as well all inclusive...

Great place to treat your friends especially the foodies and celebrate birthdays, anniversaries etc...

Expect spending 800+ per head and wait sometimes due to huge lunch time rush on weekdays...

Visit during weekends to avoid the IT crowd...

The most popular destination among foodies in Kolkata. No wonder it got 4.9 rating on Zomato. This place scores very high on all aspects.

On entering, the ambience will set up mood for one of a kind experience. This interior is nicely decorated with never ending buffet counters, mocktail counters, dessert counters and kulfi counters. Like other places, barbeque nation doesn't serves bland food in their buffet. Starting from succulent kebabs to chicken wings and tandoori prawn, the starter don't seem to stop. Their veg kebab specially that Cajun spicy potato, fried golden corn, and veg tikka is worth mentioning.
In main course mutton and crab were good. Can't say about the entire main course because we never got a chance to explore all the items.
Dessert section is equally mouth watering. Here hot gulab jamun, tiramisu, 3-4 types of mousse, cheese cake, brownie, 3-4 types of ice cream and fresh fruits are available.
Then comes the best part, the kulfi counter. My pick will be paan kulfi, chocolate kulfi and mango kulfi. Though kesar pesta, malai kulfi and strawberry are not bad either.

At least 90% of the items are mouth watering. Though if you haven't experienced the barbeque nation yet, buckle you seat belts up and get set for a food journey there

Well...putting it very crisp...They serve the best buffet in town , as far as the variety of dishes and taste is concerned ! The starter and dessert section is excellent. Unlike other buffet places, they focus on main course dishes equally. While you drop by there, make sure that you are starving üòú

As you all know this one of most popular buffet restaurant of kolkata . Their ambience and service are good. Both in veg and non veg starters you will get many good items . Though people are mad of their starter items I didn't found it that super mouthwatering . They also maintain a good taste for their main course dishes . In most of the buffet restaurant they doesn't take much care for main course. Their live kulfi counter and chocolate pan i like the most . They also keep a very good variety of tasty dessert items .

I planned a treat with my colleagues here. Loved the veg and non-veg starters especially the concept of raising flags. We are so full after starters that after that we skipped main course and directly jumped to desserts . I recommended this place to everyone who loved grilled food.

So Finally decided to hop onto this posh venture for food after hearing extensive appraisal and reviews from my friends. The food man , THE FOOD. If I had to put it in a scale of 'Yew' to 'Outstanding' , it'd rank as 'Out Of This World'. The starters were exactly on the point of being anything better than any starter you could ever taste. And the varieties were as plenty as clothes during sale. The Chef , the Manager , Even the waiters came to ask frequently about how the food was and even offered to change the fish recipe just because we didn't like it. NO RESTAURANT DOES THAT , PERIOD. Now they offered complimentary drinks too which were exactly on the point of tasting awesome. Now I didn't get on the main course because I've had enough main courses to fill my stomach over the past couple of years. I moved on to dessert , and that could have possibly been the best decision of my life alongwith not to opt for engineering. The Varieties were more than one could comprehend and lining with extensive mango , chocolate syrup and all other amenities , it was the best experience I've ever had being a foodie.¬†Now it's not finished yet ! There's also a kulfi counter with any variety of Kulfi you could imagine , ranging from Pan to Chocolate. The chocolate Kulfi is sumptuous while the Pan being something out of the book.
A tip - IF YOU WANT TO REALLY REALLY GO THERE , HAVE YOUR STOMACH EMPTY AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN , AND DO BOOK A SEAT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE , OR ELSE YOU'D BE LEFT HANGING OUTSIDE UNTIL THE PEOPLE IN THEIR HAVE EATEN TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT

Best Buffet I ever had till now..
Starter, Main course, Desert...Best in all 3..
I went there for a lunch buffet to celebrate my Birthday..
Very crowded restaurant.. Hard to find seats..
And this place and their servings made my day..
All the starters were very tasty.. Malaysian fish, Fried fish, Mutton kebab And chicken kebabs were mind blowing.. Prawn starter was okay..
In main course there were lots of items.. I tasted only a few of them.. Veg pulao, chicken biriyani and mutton were ¬†awesome in taste..¬†
Desert was delicious.. Pastries, mouse, casterd everything was yummy.. They have a culfi counter also..
I also get a birthday cake from them..
As we entered @12,.. bill for 2 was 1263 including taxes..
Truly the best buffet in town.. loved it.. Vl love to visit again and again

Nothing to say about Barbeque Nation. They offer one of the best buffet spreads in the city.

Visited this place a week or two before. Great food. 
The kebabs were the best among the whole course. There were all sorts of it- chicken, mutton, fish, prawn, mushroom and paneer.

The main course was good. Dessert was very impressive. The wide range of kulfis were a treat to the eyes.

Their hospitaly is very good.

I know there are not many people left who haven't been here. So the ones who are still, I definitely recommend this place to each of you.

The best experience I feel one can have if you crave for mughlai food. You should not even consider any place else. Moreover you'll be so much full after the starters that you'll feel to jump straight to the desserts which are again a delight. If you want to over eat, this is the place. And yeah, you'll find a place even if you cant make a booking over phone (that happened with us today).

Well by now almost everyone is aware of its wonderful buffet spread..the starters and the desserts being the star attraction..they absolutely rock both in taste and variety..whereas the main course falls behind a little bit..but it really doesn't count much since after having the never ending list of yummilicious starters that also in never ending quantity,i hardly take 3-4 spoons of main course and jump into the section of desserts which is again a lip smacking one..but yeah the price might be lowered a lil bit if possible..and not to forget the staff is excellent and very warm..:)

One of the Best Buffet in Town. Awesome food with excellent service. The starters are just the perfect you could wish for : Chicken kebabs, mutton kebabs, fish kebabs and prawn kebabs & punjabi chicken wings. Also, in Veg : sweet baby-corn, aloo kabab & pineapple cubes. Just perfect with a complimentary drink.

The Main course was good as well. There are plenty of items to choose from Veg & non veg delicacies.
 This is a self service option.¬†

Their deserts like Zebra cake, caramel apple, watermelon, gulab jamun, ice cream, Pan kulfi, kesar kulfi etc are delicious. Among all Pan Kulfi was the best n a must try.¬†

Overall a awesome place for a memorable buffet, but remember to book in advance. Trust me... you dont wanna wait hours for your food.

One of the best buffet in town. This sector V branch of Barbeque nation is located just opposite to RDB cinema hall. We were confused whether to go to Ocean Grill or Barbeque Nation... finally decided to visit Barb nation. Occasion was Birthday celebration of a friend. Had to wait 30-40 mins to get in.
Well ambience was pretty decent. There were 5 of us so got a corner table. One attendant per table was allotted.. our attendant was a really humble and sweet guy. He even surprised us by arranging a birthday cake for our friend. üòä
For welcome drink (which was on the house), there was aam panna sherbet, fresh lime soda, beer, cold drinks. Among starters there were chicken nizami tikka, mutton chapli kebab, parsley fish tikka, Spanish Valencia Prawn, Karachi wings(kind of chicken tandoori). Best were fish and prawn.
On the buffet Mutton Dak Banglow and Xacuti fish curry were worth mentioning. About quality of biriyani... let's say I've had better.
Among desserts I liked lemon bar with lemon sauce, pan pastry and of course gulab jamun.
Overall experience amazing. It's really worth the money. Looking forward to visit again. üòãüòä

We were surprised .our out station  guests told that is the worst bbq they have been to. Would like to tell bbq team, we come for the experience and not just food. Pathetic service bringing bad name to Kolkata and embarrassment to us.poor extremely poor.dissapointing.

Barbeque Nation is in my bucket list since I started using Zomato. Finally I visited today and experienced a great buffet lunch there.

‚óèLocation‚óè
Located beside Chai Break at RDB boulevard. Very easy to locate. You can see the crowd waiting outside.

‚óèAmbiance - Service - Decor‚óè
Ambiance was very so so but eecor was good and restuarant was quite a big one.
Service is top notch. No complaint at all.

‚óèDrinks‚óè
They had complimentary drinks with the menu which are quite good. Aam Panna, lime soda, soft drinks and beer are there.

‚óèStarters‚óè
This is one of the greatest attraction in here, they first give you the choice whether we need veg or non veg else they offered us both mixture of item including veg and non veg..
Serving skewers full of items in front of you on the charcoal grill was a unique experience.

Prawn Bbq was not that great but mutton seekh, chicken and fish was very good.

‚óèMain Course‚óè
There are plenty of main course from Veg items to non veg Items.
You have to go that section which has self service option. Took whatever you want.

We tried murg postun, chicken biryani, paneer butter masala, chicken salad, mutton curry and fish curry, except for the mutton all weee good.

‚óèDesserts‚óè
Dessert is also self service, there was plenty of pastries, sweets and ice cream with toppings.
I liked their gulab jamun, ice cream and chanar payes.
*Later they gave us a full cake due to their anniversary.

‚ñ†Live Counter‚ñ†
Another special attraction of the BBQ nation is live kulfi counter.
Among 6 flavours you can have unlimited kulfi.
Paan flavoured was excellent and a must try also mango was good..

Food is okayish. The dessert is superb at the buffet. You gotta try the pan flavoured kulfi. 
Kababs were of course amazing. 
If you're looking for a place to stuff yourself with dessert, barbeque nation's buffet is ideal.

I went, I saw and I conquered is all I can say..
Oh u BBQ u, testing my stomach abilities.. I showed u.. üòÇ
My friends got scared at one point seeing me..

Lets start..
The starters(which i didn't let them stop for 1hour) are the real deal of joint.. you have so many delicious choices and then you think, oh there is main course, there is dessert.. well don't.. eat as much starters you want and then some coz I am telling you, regret is not an option.
The complimentary lemonade is good.
Only regret, went on a day with no drumsticks üòê
Prawns were great and then we got some complimentary dishes, like chilly wings and mutton item and garlic naan
We also got a cake and it was awesome.
Starters went on and then main course it was. Loved the soup amd paneer, veg munchurian wasn't good and i liked the noodles
Non veg items were good but biryani, not to my expectations at all.
Dessert brought some of the lost sheen of biryani
Firni and kulfi is to die for, must must must try..

Ambience was good but due to biryani and the veg munchurian had to deduct some points..
But definitely going again.

Live Kulfi counter is awesome.It was anniversary of BBQ today so they gave us small cake to celebrate. There was a minor set back, we saw this ad on Zomato about complementary drink after 9 pm but the manager said it was a mistake in zomato and they mailed in about that issue.I don't know whose fault it is but that is a issue that you guys should sort out ASAP as it gives the customers wrong info. But the service recovery by the manager was great. Cheers to BBQ!!!

I had heard a lot about this place and today was my first time. My girlfriend and I reached at about quarter past two and it was jampacked during the lunch session. They initially responded saying they won't be able to accommodate us as we were walk-ins and there were plenty if reservations. But we persisted and they indeed tried their best and asked us to wait till half past three as an estimate. We were the last name on the list of lunch hour clients and after us they closed further reservations.
They were spot on, for we were escorted to our table right at half last three.
Service was swift and prompt. They set up the grill straightaway and on came kebabs one after another. As soon as you finished one skewer of kebabs, they'd replenish it with another one. Prawn, chicken, fish, mutton it was so all so juicy and beautiful, especially the chicken. Also I loved the fried sweet corn which was given.
The highlight of the day was when the chef came to enquire about the food, I gave him my review, and also told him that the fish kebab was a bit dry on the inside. He went away, and after a few moments we were served a dish of crispy fried dry chilli fish with onions and capsicums and were told it was with regards and best compliments from the chef in order to compensate our taste buds. I was spellbound! This particular dish wasn't even on the menu and they served it to keep a ckient happy. That shows the level of commitment and hospitality these people hold and truly this dish was the best thing I had today. The spices, the flavour it was all so amazing that it blew my mind!
One drink is complementary per head. We had aam panna and sweet lime soda. Both were nice and refreshing but I had less of them as I was concentrating more on the kebabs on the grill in the table.
The main course buffet was good but it could've been better. The chicken dum biriyani was of a different kind in terms of flavour, but indeed good. I was a bit disappointed with the quality of meat they had in Mutton Duckbunglow. Nothing wrong with the preparation or the gravy but the meat lacked flavour and had thick fibres. Other chicken dishes were well prepared.
Desserts were an absolute treat. Those piping hot small gulab jamuns were a huge hit with me. I also indulged myself in an ice cream sunday with two scoops of ice cream, two pieces of chocolate brownie and topping it all wirh chocolate sauce. And yeah I also loved their kesar kulfi at the very end.
Today we were also served a free mango-caramel cake of about a half pound as a complementary, since its their anniversary. Every client was being served that and it really tasted beautiful, especially the cr√®me crust.
Overall it's amazing! You can literally gorge and feast one kebabs and desserts as much as you want without complain. You can skip the main course buffet if you want to. But remember, when it's Barbeque Nation, barbequed kebabs are the real way to go! And please do save space for desserts. :P

Undoubtedly the best in this format. Though I am a huge fan of Speciality Group of restaurants but this one clearly beats Flame & Grill by quite a bit of margin.

I had a table reserved for the Saturday lunch. My birthday was the occasion. From decor to ambience, there is a certain great feature of the place. We were asked to make a choice among the list of complimentary drinks. The Aam panna was okay. The sweet lime soda was great and refreshing.
No sooner we began with the starters. Chicken kebabs, mutton kebabs, fish kebabs and prawn kebabs were offered with the sticks as non-veg items. Chicken tangri kebab and fish gelatino was served on the plates. For the veg, there were mushrooms and paneer offered with the sticks. Potatoes and corns were served on the plates. Everything was delicious!
Taking a 5 minutes break, we moved to the maincourse section. I began with the Thai soup with meat balls, egg fried rice and the chicken in black-beans sauce. The soup and the rice tasted great. But the chicken dish was disappointing. The black-bean sauce tasted awful. To the worse, the chicken pieces were not boneless. I spoke to one attendant about it. I was later served boneless chicken in the same sauce. It was better to eat but the taste was no better. But yes, I do appreciate their effort to prepare it for me in such a short time. The chicken biriyani tasted okay but got all messed up in the large handi by the constant stirring of the large crowd of other eaters. The quality of the rice used as steam rice was excellent and made a good pair with the mutton. The mutton roganjosh tasted good but the quality of the mutton used wasn't at level with this restaurant. The pieces of katla fishes looked royal. But since it was cooked in mustard sauce, I had an issue with it. Take it from a pure Bengali and fish lover, katla fish and mustard sauce don't pair well, just as great hilsa fish and mustard sauce do. Rest of the dal and cauliflower curry were average to okay.
Ah well! The exuberant spread of deserts was very eye catching. Every fruit and sweet tasted fresh and delicious. The tiny gulabjamuns were hot and fresh. The banana mousse was thick and creamy. The cakes were all freshly baked. Just one disappointment, the cheese of the cheese cake was stale, tasted sour and had spoilt the thing. It was perhaps the worst cheese cake I've ever had. But to the rescue, was the live kulfi counter. The man at the counter was very polite and amiable and served the kulfis and toppings according to my directions. And yes, all of the 6 tasted mind blowing!
I was gifted a chocolate cake with a candle on it, as a complimentary gift for my visit on my birthday. That was really sweet. Hence, on the whole, I have 4.5 each for the starters and the deserts and 2-2.5 for the maincourse. On the other hand, hospitality was very amicable and upto the mark, getting a full 5. The menu in the maincourse and the usage of sauce needs a check. I would really love to visit there again with a hope in improvement in the maincourse section.

I would say they serve the best buffet in sector 5..though price is also high as compared to other places in same area. Starters are the main attraction..specially the grilled prawn,crispy corn..main course is so so..the hot gulab jamuns are all time favourite..kulfi counter is available.

Ate kebabs,squids n crabs to my hearts content.the main course was a bit disappointing though... The desert section however made up for it... Reasonably priced... However there is scope for improvement in the main course section.... Whoever has not visited yet,should try it out... Its worth it..honestly.

The kebabs, the desserts and the various flavors of kulfi are too awesome have no word to say . I went there mainly for the kebabs and the dessert, didn't try main course :P . Foods are awesome.

Surely deserves a 5 on 5 and a place one must try..!!! The moment you enter (There can be a long wait, but its worth it) you will get such a good feeling about this place... Nice interiors, good music and courteous staff...
Once you are set, they will put charcoal in the chamber, provide you complimentary drinks and then start pouring in starters of your choice over the barbeque... You can have it as much as you want and they will keep pouring in the starters until you put the flag down (You almost complete your meal here. Little scope is left for the main course)... You can then proceed to the main course (okaish, pretty simple) and help yourself with the salads, breads, rice and curries from the menu. Once you are done with main course, next comes the sweets and live coolfi counter. I suggest you to try out different coolfi's over here. They are simply yummy...
All is well that starts well and ends well... Awesome food with some great ambience.. My tummy really calls for this place...

If you are a foodie and you haven't yet visited this place then you are missing out big time. 
The best place to go for a sumptuous meal, the kebabs are the best in town , my favourite is the prawn kebab, the best i ever had.. The main course is normal. Nothing special. But the deserts are again heavenly, especially the gulab jamuns which melts inside the mouth. 
Another reason i love this place is for the service, the waiters are very attentive.  All in all in a great restaurant and everyone must give it a try.

Located at sector 5 saltlake , BBQ nation offers an amazing mouth watering buffet spread with a beautiful ambience and the warmest hospitality I have ever experienced. I visited there today with 2 of my friends. We already booked our table 1 day in advance to avoid last minute rush. The best part of the buffet is  of course its starters. Veg, chicken , mutton , fish and prawns - all were lip smacking. We were also offered chef special starter ( one was fish and the other veg). The soup ( chicken with meat balls) was not very delicious. But it was immediately replaced once we provided our feedback. The warm hospitality and the quick service fascinated me a lot. Desserts were amazing with live kulfi counter and the orange cheese cake is recommendable. 
In a nutshell , I had a perfect time and a perfect lunch with my friends at BBQ nation. Thank you guys ! :)

Buffet @ Barbeque nation is undoubtedly d best in town....serves a wide varieties of starters (Prawns,chicken,mushroom,pineapple,fish,potato and mutton) ..even we got served a special fish starter. Main course was not exclusively good and d biriyani was certainly not upto d mark.Dessert emerged a clear winner with caramel custurd,zebra pastry,coconut soufle,ice cream and those hot gulab jamuns.
PS: special mention of the pan flavoured kulfi at the live counter and the pasta in white sauce.

There a few other restaurants in the city which serve kebabs on the table with a buffet but somehow Barbeque Nation is always ahead of every one, because they absolutely slay it with impeccable service, brilliant food, taste, quality, variety, ambiance. I could really go on with such adjectives. Especially the sector 5 branch is my personal favorite because that is where I would go very regularly for family dinners, get togethers, etc until they opened doors in park street which is now closer to my home. If you want to just dig in to great food, come here. But if you are coming on a weekend, be prepared to wait to be seated because the queues go up to about one hundred people during peak lunch and dinner times!

After a long wait at last managed to get inside the all famous BBQ Nation. Sounds like a dream come true. The restaurant is very well managed and their feedback system is fantastic as they continuously ask us about the food n if we have some problem they rectify it.

Their buffet is awesome but needs some rectification like Fried corn and crispy baby corn was too much oily. Their buffet as Grilled paneee tikka, Veg kebab, Dahi kebab, Tandoori pineapple, tandoori aaloo etc etc etc are all awesome.

Their deserts like Zebra cake, watermelon, Pan kulfi, kesar kulfi etc are delicious. Among all Pan Kulfi was the best n a must try.

Overall buffet is fantastic, interiors are awesome, seating is comfortable, staff is awesomely cooperative.

A must visit....

This is one of my favourite places to have great food. Let me get this straight, one has to work really hard to find a flaw with the place. The unlimited kebabs are outstanding, each one bettering the other. The desserts and the kulfis are sumptuous. Excellent flavour  mixed with a cozy ambiance and professional service gives a great feeling. As for the main course, well, if you are not a voracious eater, you will find it difficult to make it to the main course.

Well, according to me, this place ranks 1 among all the other barbecue buffet places in the city.

Easy to locate, below RDB Cinemas, Sector V, Saltlake.

Decor : Cozy, Average.

The buffet spread is elaborate to the extreme. Starters are served & refilled even before you ask for it. You will be amazed to find the endless varieties. I sooo love the prawn kebabs. Each item is finger licking. ¬†

Coming to the main course (if you have any room left at all), I found them a little above average. But then the starters and desserts totally compensate for the same.

I can visit this place again & again only for the awesome desserts that they offer. We were so full at the end that we could barely stand up and walk. Full value for money.

And yes, Service...Hats Off!!! I have never seen more courteous staff. Also, even if you offer tips, they will refuse to accept. Thumbs Up!

It feels like celebration every time I'm here. To top it all off the food is simply lipsmacking, with a huge variety of dishes BBQ nation is easily one of the best joints in Kolkata. would love to visit again.

We went there, on my father's birthday , totally elated by the ambience, a family feeling in there. Obviously attracted by the unlimited kebab servings. Be it veg or non veg, the kebabs were oh so good. Great flavours. I personally lived the prawns and mutton kebabs. We went for the buffet spread. Huge huge huge spread, variety served with total affection. The dessert counter again is my favourite part. The koolfi counter oh god üòç droolworthy. 
They also gave a small cake on knowing it's my dad's birthday, and also clicked us a family photograph which they immediately framed and gave us . The gesture of no tipping, is another plus point here. The attitude and behavior of the staff was very homely, thank you for a wonderful time. Would love to be served again :)

They serve the best kebabs in the city.. So much so that i missed my main course.. Hehehe.. I wish to visit here the next time to taste the main course items..
Coming to the kebabs..
Fish,chicken & prawn kebabs all were very much succulent,it needed no effort to tear the pieces.. The waiter who served was very prompt in his service and he did put up a smile everytime he visited.. ;-)
They served a complimentary drink of which we chose 7up! :)
Could manage to taste hakka noodles and 3different types of salads on main course.. But missed biriyani :'( i wanna go back! ;-)
On the dessert üç®
They had live pheerni counter.. And boy! It tastes heavenly! If only i could have controlled my greed for kebabs. Mummaaa! :'(
Fresh watermelon,gulab jamun,scoups of ice cream wid a syrup of our choice(chocolate,strawberry,the other one i didn't remember) there were mango cheese cakes too..
Last but not the least how i can i forget my LOVE ‚ù§
That's BROWNIE my dear! :D
And yeah i was being given a treat for getting a job,so they arranged a cake which had CONGRATULATIONS written..
Lotsa love to the team of Barbeque Narions,SALTLAKE. Keep up the good work.

Had a wonderful experience out here.. :-)

Idk about others but I was way over the top excited to check this place out. Had heard a lot of good things from my friends. The food and the overall place was really good and the staff was courteous and professional. However it didn't live up to the hype. I really liked the shrimp and chicken starters. Fish was just meh! Main course lacked the variety and I couldn't find any crab which I was really looking forward to. But I got beer so I'm happy but I think I would prefer the Bangalore outlet.

If you are at Kolkata, you gotta try this place. 
Order: We had the Sunday dinner buffet,which included all different kinds of kebabs such as prawn, chicken, mutton and paneer., just for starters. The main course was excellent, and the kulfi is the one that you will remember your whole life. 
My review: It's like a total food heaven, and it serves that you can't afford to miss. The whole money was totally worth it, and I would never hesitate to go back to this amazing placeüòç 
My advice: Only buffets are available here. Fill yourself up with starters, and enjoy the ambiance as they provide you the best grilling experience for you and and your familyüòé

Visited the Salt Lake one after a long time. Few points - though was offered lunch for free, complimentary drinks was not. So my kid felt discrimination. "Sigree" on the other side, far better than this on this front. Starters quality have gone down to a great extent, considering I've been visiting for last 10 years. Think only the location preference is giving a better edge, otherwise "Sigree" offers a much better hospitality with warm welcome. Lasoon Jhinga (Prawn kababs) was dull, hardly having any taste. The sweet dish is good, offers wide range, but starters would say have gone below normal. In total, I'd prefer "Sigree" now than this one in future.

Scenario: You are in Kolkata.You have 750 bucks and you are a foodie.What do you do?It's simple you visit Barbeque Nation in salt lake to have the time of your life.

It is situated just adjacent to the RDB cinema hall in Salt lake sector 5.I would suggest you to prebook your lunch/dinner as it is always crowded there.The service is good as the waiters always check your requirement and the service is quick

Now coming to the out of the world food.I would recommend you to plan your lunch.I am a big fan of their kebabs and desserts so i skip their main course.As it is an unlimited buffet restaurant you can't enjoy all of their delicacies at the same time so you have to choose some and skip others.

Must try items: Classic barbequed Chicken Kebabs.Soft and mouth watering mutton seekh kebabs.One should surely ask for the Cajun spiced potatoes.It tastes amazing.My favourite among the starter is the crispy corn.I never knew corn can taste so well.Its a must taste item for me.Among the main course you can try their pasta and variety of salads.Now coming to my favorite part of the buffet,out of the world desserts.You should taste each of them.They have variety of lipsmacking pastries,tarts, cheesecakes. Their mango phirni is just beyond explanation.Its that damn good. Make sure you try their soft and warm angoori gulab jamun.it is better than anything you have ever tasted in your life. You can also try stuffs from their kulfi counter which offers varieties like mango,paan,strawberry and chocolate 

End your journey with their amazing ice cream with chocolate sause.You are spending 732 bucks and believe me its worth every penny.Highly recommended.

I have thrice visited this place lastest being a month or two ago and never have i been dissapointed in any respect. This place is best known for its buffet where it offers a wide variety of dishes, most admirable being the starters and desserts. The welcome drink they serve is complementary which also comes with a range of options. Among the main course items their biriyani is very light and delicious and quite different from the regular kolkata biriyani. Only that everytime i went there i found the prawn kebabs were li'll undercooked even after complaining. The interior ambience is beautiful with nice decor and some soft music being played all the while. Each and every staff is very cordial. Even the cheff himself turns up to get some feedback. While waiting in the queue they serve cold drinks and try to get u the seats as early as possible. Price is justified compared to the food and service they provide. This place deserves a visit of every single foodie. Prior table reservation is highly recommended unless u can afford to wait a bit outside.

Very friendly and cooperative staff.. Going with a group and searching for quality food and best services... The best place at Kolkata is Barbeque Nation..

The restaurant serves best what's similar to its name.
"Lipsmacking" is what suits perfect with the galore of "Bar-be-ques".It needs no mention for those who have been there already;but for those who wish to be there,it's surely to be in your "to-do-list"! There is a succulent array of barbeques ranging from Chicken wings to grilled prawns,chicken kebabs to fish kebabs,mutton seekh kebabs to juicy mildly grilled pineapples.
The main course has both veg and non veg options to select from. Though I didn't find the main course dishes to fill up the plate with a variety.
The desserts are a paradise for anyone with a sweet tooth and even if one does not have much affinity towards it,one cannot simply resist from picking up a thing or two and is also suggested to go for it.
Service is at blazing speed. Extremely attentive to every guest's requests and needs.
Value for money-YES!

*Go for their limited period spread on offer, "Dilliwali Khau Galli" (Till 7th August,2016)
The flavours and goodness of the capital served on a plate!*

When it comes to live grill the first name come to mind is barbecue nation. Have been going there since it was in the BIPL building. The starter and dessert has always been excellent, but on a recent visit I noticed they have improved a lot on the entree.

This place has amazing food. Go for buffet when visit this place. Unlimited starters and all were equally good. Veg/non veg...less than 1000(inclusive of taxes). Albeit, a bit clumsy. But ambience is nice. Service is good too. Unlike other places, virgin mojito was just perfect. In alcohol, LIIT was also made nicely.

Ufffff...the foods...that's my expression when I visited here for the first time. Actually every time I go to Kolkata , Barbeque is a must visit. I can say that if you are a foodie and you didn't tried barbeque, you have missed something in your life. I love everything here the foods, ambience and service. I am never dissatisfied. It is a definitely 5star place for me. I think no one will bother about gaining weight when you are in Barbeque Nation.

best buffet I had in Kolkata
simply outstanding
BBQ's main attraction is their starters
Mutton seekh kebab & Chicken drumbstick is just wow!!
special mention should be crispy corn & Tandoori potato
after such a superhit starter , main course falls a little bit,but its still better
they should add one more variation of mutton gravy
desserts & live kulfi counter plays an excellent cameo

The best thing about this is their friendly and accommodating staff. Though we all know its great for non veg, i really wish they improve and get more items on veg for veg lovers. Its always crowded and booked with corporates. Seeing huge line outside I am sure most of us decide to back out even without checking. I wish the chef and management work more on veg lovers and their loyal customers too

This place does not need a review.The best barbecue buffet place in the city in a reasonable price.All i can tell about this place is"Gluttony is no sin and Barbeque Nation is a Heaven."Lovely environment,so many options of starters,main course,desserts make this place unique. Everyone tells about their dessert and startes,but main course was freaking awesome.Specially the biryani and the pasta.
As i said,this place does not need a review. I am writing just only to level up my foodie rank.

Buffet at its best. Barbeque nation is the place. The chicken is always well marinated and juicy. The live grills make sure the kebabs do not get cold. Main Course also has a great variety over Indian and Chinese. With Dum Biryani giving me a run for my money. Desserts and chaats are everyone's favourite. Make sure you leave enough space for it. Worth every penny.

Buffet at its best...barbeque nation is the place..this time however i found the veg starters more interesting..the cajun spice potato my personal fav..followed by spicy grilled pineapples...finger licking stuff...amongst the non veg starters..the fish and chicken were just above average and the mutton sheek kebab continued to disappoint me..the complementary fresh lime soda helped us eat like a hog...
Now coming to the main course..the chicken dum biriyani very average..but the show stealer was laal mass..the muttons were soft and juicy..lip smacking stuff..the dorowani chicken was unique as well..dint try the egg curry..the sarson fish was average...the chowmein did grab my attention..the gratin was too sweet for my taste buds...while the potato wedges were tangy..
The dessert tour started off with chocolate tart..above average i guess..the brownies pretty ordinary..white forest pastries and the cheesecake were too good...the smooth creamy texture did please me a lot..firni did not do justice to its name i am afraid..the anguri gulab jamuns were outstanding..the vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and strawberry ice cream were adding cherry to the cake..the journey finally ended with paan kulfi..till the whole meal made me so full to barely move myself...hats off barbeque nation...

You simply cant write anything bad about Barbeque Nation. The go-to place for almost all office goers here for any damn lunch party. Mouth watering grills, the aloo tikki, the grilled prawns, it never ends. And as if you are not stuffed to the brim, turn the flag down and head over to the main course section, and you are greeted with a wide variety of dishes. Almost never had any main course dish after the stupendous starters, but the one thing never missed, the desserts. Absolute bliss.
PS: Did not quite like the new kulfi section though.

You better ask your driver to go home dropping you at BBN! You will need lo....ong walk post dinner!
What you will choose from? Veg, non veg starters plus special servings like spring roll, fried sweet corns to begin with. Chef coming to your table and checking is pleasant experience. Spread for main course is equally mouth watering.
Icing on cake is by dessert options of Gulab jamun, ice cream and pan kulfi.
Even though mad rush due to weekend leading to crowded atmosphere inside BBN, attentive staff and close monitoring by smiling managers makes your whole dining experience worth visit.
One thing I missed in dessert was gajar halwa. Otherwise it's perfect for get together with friends and family.
If you can start your dinner as early as 6:30pm entry, you can benefit from early bird offer too :)
Go go it and have fun!

This place actually define "Jitna marzi hain khalo"
¬†Right from the kebabs to the pastries there is a concordance in the guidelines of the quality and flavors served. You can actually eat till your esophagus says" ok ! Its done!"
I go mainly for the kebabs and the dessert , and to my surprise they have a fruit counter too, where you can take in mangoes, watermelons, and much more!
Although I tried their Dum Biriyani and mutton roganjosh which was pretty awesome.¬†
The dessert counter was again a favourite place where you can customize your kulfi , with variety of options. I liked their cheese cake too.

Worth every penny.

It's Barbeque Nation...can't wax eloquent enough about it! 
The familiar unlimited grilled starters are one of the main reasons one comes here,scrumptious,delicious adjectives would fall short.eat as much as you can,they will keep filling up the live grill at your table. It's 90% cooked & you have to cook the remaining 10% literally-Fun as usual
 Service is also excellent-with courteous staff hovering around for assistance
Half marks off for the ambience- Falls below the Bangalore & Chennai ones I have tried. Everyone was seating together like a fish market with no privacy
Also the desserts section need to be expanded,the main course is stagnant as well, although Dum biryani
 & Chilli Garlic Noodles  were tasty
Pricingwise, reach early before 7.30 & one can avail the early bird offer of close to 220/- off. Worth the price for the amount of delicacies you get to hog
Prior reservation is a must as it was housefull even on a weekday. 
Would definitely visit again..!

Located below RDB Cinemas, Sector 5, Saltlake.
This small little are is now the Foodie Hub, with Barbeque Nation the oldest patron.

Started going to this place a few years ago. But was stoked to see the popularity and rage when i had to wait for 1 hour on a working day for Lunch.
So it is always safe to have prior reservation done.

Quickly moving onto the food part, just like reality, the starters are always well prepared with a great variety for the Veggies as well. The chicken is always well marinated and juicy. The live grills make sure the kebabs do not get cold and gives the eater a personal touch, by brushing etc.
Since i am not the sea food guy, i love this place for understanding the customer, as they always prepare a couple of chicken items off the menu.
Cajun Potatoes remain my favourite.

Main Course also has a great variety over Indian and Chinese. With Dum Biryani giving me a run for my money.¬†

Desserts and Chaats are everyone's favourite.
Make sure you leave enough space for it.

The only fact which stops me from giving it a 5.0 is that mainly their Menu is pretty stagnant with 1 or 2 changes in the items. So you seldom get to try something new.

Apart from this. Worth every penny.

It's a buffet restaurant so everyone become HULK üòúüòúüòú
Yet they maintained the ambience and the service is too good. Food quality is never been compromised, manager personally come and check about the food and other matters.

Took my parents for a meal here last weekend. First and foremost, if you are visiting this outlet advance reservation is always advised. The demand for the place is so high, making last minute plans for the outlet is not advised. The decor and interior is good, even if the restaurant is completely occupied, the ambience is still good. The staff is courteous and the chef keeps moving from one table to other to personally ask all guests to rate the food. The buffet spread is enough to keep you in the restaurant after the delicious starters are done on the table. The only thing which can improve is the space for movement near the main course and desert counters. Kulfi is a speciality here and is a must have among the deserts. Overall, a great experience as expected from a Barbecue nation outlet.

My all time favorite hangout place with friends since my starting of career in Salt lake. But unfortunately for the last one and half years we really couldn't make out time to meet up. But finally on last Sunday we have again lived our past @ Barbeque Nation. I feel amazed seeing that still their service quality is simply awesome. Though the prices have gone up in this past years, still i found it as value for money only because of the service and for some really really delicious preparations. Above all it was truly a happy ending for the lunch with the awesome desserts servings. Keep it up guys.

As always Barbeque Nation is awesome...no alcohol in Kolkata unlike Bangalore, but overall a nice place to hangout. The starters are one of the best amongst most of the other restaurants. If you are a non vegetarian you will be spoiled for your choices but little thin on selection for vegetarians. Nice ambiance and crowd accompanied by fantastic service. One of the classic places for starters and desserts but there is still a little room for improvement on the main course part...

Just as i entered i just whispered wow.. what an ambience to watch.. soon we joined our tableand our starter was served and i cant express how good the way of serving was 
, A small tandoor was placed on the table and things were grilled and roasted infront of us ..oh my god that was what we all said.. ..just awersome we had chicken,fish ,prawn ,mutton (kabab) in our staters
Coming too the main course the biryani was too good.. so was the nihari ghost.,everything was too good. But the desert just took my heart away, what a collection of extremely delicious deserts..wow.. 
BBQ just made our day... totally satisfied with the food ,the service and the ambience..

I do like the mountainous variety of options that Barbeque Nation provides to its diners. Right from the kebabs to the desserts there is a harmony in the standards of the quality and flavors served.

This might come as a shock but I actually do like the mains more than the kebabs. According to me the kebabs did have scope to be better. I love the mutton and the biriyani here. The biriyani is light and flavorful, neither heavy on the palette and nor on the stomach. The mutton is without a doubt the favorite part of my meal.

The desserts are delightful and I especially love the kulfis.

A place every foodie should visit as many times possible. A variety of 10-12 starters, ranging from chicken, fish, mutton and lamb kebabs to kick start your meal will leave you satisfied to the fullest. Some of the veg starters like mushroom and pineapple shashlik are quite delectable. The main course again is again top notch and one is spoilt for choices to save some room for dessert. Every true Bengali is born with a sweet tooth and I'm not an exception. Barbeque Nation has by far the best desserts compared to its contemporary buffet places. Having frequented this place quite a few times I've never been disappointed, on the contrary my love for Barbeque Nation has increased every time.

Starting from the offerings of Kababs veg or non veg whatever you take ,you will treat yourself.The foodies heaven. Biriyani with tender chicken , other paneer or chicken dishes are awesome. Special mention for the dessert section. The new koolfy section is mindblowing. The flavors are very jaw dropping. Do visit the place and try paan koolfy . That is amazing. The fast serving,courteous behavior of the resturant unit ,evrything shall add up to it. Visited this place so many times and looking to visit there soon.

I think when it's Barbeque Nation, things are pretty standard across cities. Delicious food, courteous service, nice ambience & a great experience overall. Since lots of offices are located around the place, it becomes quite crowded if you go during office lunch hours. So try avoiding the place during that 1 hour.

The best part is the service, they treat you as guests and are the perfect host.
I don't know which item to praise and which to leave out as all are equally delicious. However I won't have idea about the main course as I have never sampled their main course being too full after gorging the starters and the dessert.
Their mutton seekh kebab, chicken leg piece, prawn kebab and corn items are out of the world.
Hope to return again

Went for the Lunch Buffet on the 17 of May with my friends .Well the starters were good but the fish was less seasoned. They had Prawns. Mutton Kebabs ,2 types of Chicken Kebab, a corn prreparation and a baked potato preparation along with a complimentary drink. After the Starters i felt the main course was a kind of disappointing though it didnt lacked variety.But the best part of Barbeque Nation was the Dessert. 6 types of Kulfis really made my experience worthwhile and the cakes were simply awesome. Gave a 4 rating only because the Dessert in the buffet menu is the best in the town.

This is one of the buffet places that pops up in our minds when ever we think of Team Lunch. And guess what, it has never managed to dissappoint us. Its food, people and ambience are an epitome of perfection, except for the occassional times they bore us with their 'Enrique music collection'. I m glad they didn't play it during the last two visits.
The 'Kulfi corner' is innovative and is another reason to choose Barbeque Nation over other places.
Sweet Corn and Prawns in white sauce are my favorites. Apart from that they have a myriad of desserts to entice you.
Nice but expensive but a worthy place to fulfill your tummy and soul

I have been to Barbeque Nation Sector 5 a number of times I do not even remember to give a damn no more.
Starters: Grade-A would be an understatement, jewel of the crown being the char-grilled prawn. People stumble over Mutton Seekh/Chicken Tangdis - but I absolutely concentrate on the Prawn because nothing friggin' matches the perfection these folks have achieved. Correct seasoning in everything, spot-on grill, great juicy prawns. veg starters also, especially cajun spiced potatoes, are tremendous.¬†

main course: Leave and you won't be disappointed - everyone who is experienced about BBQ Nation avoids it hopefully. Standard 5-course meal at best.

Dessert - Kulfi counter, mindblowing, Gulab jamun, mindblowing. Pastries, custards and Pudding are a bit hit-and-miss depending on the menu of that day. Nothing that can deter you though, from a second helping. A minimum criticism on their face, they will be more than happy to apologize and offer chef's special dessert - a changed one not demonstrated in the menu of the day - as a courtesy. Management makes the hotel they say, and this calls for a ikkis topon di salami.

In short - this is the best restaurant in Kolkata. Everywhere, anywhere, anytime, in any price bucket, if you got the money. There is no chance of regretting the BBQN experience. Keep it up team!

This was one of the first places that I visited in Kolkata, was very glad in the end that I did, and I keep visiting it till date. The menu is like any other Barbeque Nation and really sets the benchmark for Buffets. They have maintained the standards unlike any other place and continue to excel on it. The food menu is fantastic and there is hardly anything you would like to leave. Starting from the appetizers and over to the main course there is hardly a point where you want to stop, and then there are the sinful desserts. Since the menu is so big, you might be forced to leaving something in the end. This is already a hit place for the people of Salt Lake and it does deserve a hands up and a shoutout for the way they manage hunger and leave you delighted. Cheers.

Barbeque Nation is one chain of restaurants that has never disappointed me in any part of the country (read: Delhi, Kolkata and Bangalore). The one situated in Salt Lake is one of the best places to cater to your gourmet food cravings. ¬†

Barbeque Nation is famous for its excellent starters.¬†Both the vegetarian and non-vegetarian starters here are delicious (read: prawns, chicken, fish, paneer and pineapple). The table, the serving style and the aura of the restaurant reflects class and sophistication. On my last visit, I had ordered non-vegetarian starters but my server was kind enough to provide me with the pineapple (veg) ones as well, because let me tell you, THAT is delicious. I had Iced Tea along with my meal, but I didn't really like it much.¬†

The main course and desserts are not at par with the deliciousness of the starters, so it is advisable to fill yourself up on those when you are on a buffet meal. Barbeque Nation is one place where I come back home feeling bloated, full to my throat and incredibly happy at the same time. No regrets - this place is too good.

Best experience... Service is too good and loved the food. Lots of variety and customer service is exceptional.. We complained for some paneer dish as we didn't liked it and then they immediately prepared a new paneer dish for us directly from kitchen. Awesome experience better service than the park street one.

Countless wedding & office buffets after, my mother had a depressing view of the Buffet. And I felt, it was my grand duty to change that. And what better place to fulfil that, than "Babu Ganeshan" (err, Barbecue Nation)?¬†So one fine evening, I decided to drag my pessimistic family to Barbecue Nation, Saltlake. We were able to encroach a nice corner couch; as there were few patrons at that time. And then, it was raining starters.. Chicken, Mutton, Fish & Prawn. My brother being the ''hisebi type'' decided to attack the Prawns, to recover most of the money. :-) While my mother was so impressed with dry-fried Corn, she barely had time for the ''amish'' (Non-veg Starters). So much so, she completely skipped the main course & jumped directly to the dessert.¬†
Hours of mindless gorging later, when we stopped; the view has completely changed in Buffet''s favour.¬†Like I said, ''my mother had a depressing view of the Buffet''. Until there was Barbecue Nation.

Availed the lunch buffet here as a birthday treat. The service is courteous and polite to a fault. We i.e a boisterous group of 13 people entered the place at 12:15 and left at around 3. At no point were we hurried or made to feel awkward. Special mention-complimentary birthday cake and the super friendly guy at the kulfi counter who kept suggesting what desert to eat.¬†

There is so much food that you forget the names. You overeat,and then eat some more. The Fish kebab, chocolate kulfi, paan kulfi, mushroom starter and the phirni-my favourites from the really good menu today.¬†

Tip-If too full, skip mains.

Amazing experience! Oh my God I don't even know where to begin. The main attraction of this place are the mouth watering starters starters and the desert items. The main course is good but not as good as the starters. But its still pretty delicious. Lots of items, lots of choices, you'll want to eat them all but you won't be able to, unless you want to burst open. Absolutely worth the money, fantastic customer service, they give you a cake if its your birthday, can seat a LOT of people, good decor. The behaviour of the staff is very good, they always ask for your suggestions, also give you suggestions as to how you can get the best out of their restaurant. Do book your seats beforehand, because there is always a rush- even on weekdays. Visit this joint ASAP!
PS - We loved this place so much that we forgot to click picturesüòÖ

Barbeque Nation is simply the best place in Salt Lake and all of this area for its class buffet and mouth savouring dishes. Starting from the tikkas, prawns to the desserts you will notice how these guys have put efforts even in minute stuff like kulfi and gulabjamun. The meal is awesome. Particularly favourite dishes include Fish Kebabs, Prawns and Pan flavoured Kulfi. Those who have not visited this place till now, please go while you stay at Kolkata. It doesn't matter if you're a foodie or not, you're bound to love this place.

I have visited this wonderful place twice - once for lunch buffet and once for dinner. The main differences are that the lunch buffet is slightly cheaper and there is no complimentary drinks with the dinner buffet. The atmosphere was nice, particularly when I went for dinner as there was a singer performing live on stage. When it comes to food their philosophy is that they want us to indulge in eating as much as it pleases us. The starter service flag was a nice touch. The starters comprise of a whole array of kebabs which are delicious. The Chefs are particularly careful about whether the taste is alright, checking in on us. We recommended some slight changes about the fish kebab and they gave us a modified version according to our instructions. My personal favorite was the Mutton Sheekh Kebab. The main course was a bit of let down for me. But the desserts more than compensate for that. The greatest part is the Gulab Jamuns. In conclusion I would say that it is a must go for Kolkata Foodies. I would also like to add that the staff were very friendly. I can go here again and again for the starters and desserts.

A heaven for foodies. You will find a waiting of 30mins-1hour even on weekdays. Such a great place this is.

5/5 in every aspect- food, service, ambiance and the decor. 

Your stomach will be full only by the starters. In spite of the full stomach, the taste of the food would force you to try the main course. After you've tried the yummiest main course, the dessert would tempt you. You would love the kulfi's, pastries etc. 

A person on a diet must not try to visit this place at all. You would be deemed to leave your dieting for that particular lunch/dinner.

Also, when it came to billing we had left a tip of ‚Çπ100 bucks. To my shock they don't accept tips and returned it to me.

I would love to visit here soon again. But this time I will go with an empty stomach.üòÇ

This is not a Restaurant. This is HOME. Eat as you like it (with spoon, hand, two hands, licking from plate), as much as you like, as long as you like.
The Starters are phenomenal (for the lack of a more superlative adjective). Be it the mutton, chicken, prawns or fish.. everyone of them is lip smacking. My favourite are the fish though. Off the grill starters are equally awesome and ask the waiters shamelessly to repeat them till you are satisfied. Try to get a central sitting fir better service. Another starter worth a shout out are the Chic. Drumsticks.
BOOKING OF TABLES IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. THEY ARE FULL EVEN ON MONDAY AFTERNOONS & WAITING TIME CAN BE PRETTY LONG! 
Their policy of offering one free drink (KF beer/Lemonade/Aam Panna/Aerated drinks) is really novel and welcome. I usually take KF premium. Try to avoid KF Strong! It tastes so bad that it will spoil your entire food-trip at the very outset. One time when I went here with i mom I settled for lemonade like a "bhalo chele" & it was nice too, mom took aam panna which was better in my opinion. 
MAIN COURSE IS MOSTLY SHIT. If you are a first timer, try the salads, they are the only nice things, or else skip over to desserts. 
If there is anything that outdoes the starters of BBQN, its the desserts of BBQN. 
Firni is my favorite amongst them all. Though i didn't see it on the menu in the last two visits and was extremely disappointed. The pastries are nice. The angoori gulab jamuns are a bit too sweet. I generally take ice-creams in soup bowls coz i find the ice cream bowls too small and inconvenient! :P I suggest you do the same, without any shame! 
PRO TIP : After starters have salad and freshly cut fruits (watermelons esp.) and wait for a while before moving on to desserts! Freshly cut watermelons cools tour interiors down and gets you prepared for a full fledged dessert-storm! 
And as if these all were not enough, they have opened a kulfi counter too a few months back! HOLY MOTHER OF GOD! 
By this time i assume you wont have space for even air in your stomach. Go to the washroom. Stretch a bit. Try the Paan flavoured kulfi. Pay the bills. Get the f*** out before you die from over-eating! 
PROS : Excellent staff. They want you to eat unlike other buffets where the service is frustratingly slow, here they over pamper you till you drop & beg for mercy. The floor manager roams around and asks you time and again if you are enjoying it or not and whether you have any suggestions. 
THE STARTERS & THE DESSERTS. 
The warm ambience and comfortable seating. 
Free drinks. 
No TIP policy
CONS : CUT THROAT SERVICE TAX (thus the. 5 deduction)

Excellently known for its buffet platter, Barbeque nation is a mostly sought after food hub for kith and kiln..This place located in the midst of tall buildings in sector 5 has its own grandeur...The place is well decorated and the soft music perfectly creates a relaxing ambience...The staffs are well behaved..One thing which I liked is the chef enquiring about the food personally..
Coming to food...Its a grand buffet platter where you get on to munch some yummiest meat balls and kebabs....Next is the main course which serves both veg and non-veg dishes.(Though I could not taste all the dishes as I was already full having starters) The biriyani is really good!
Last but not the least was the desserts..It was yummilicoius indeed!-the kulfis...aha!! There was a wide variety of them...
To end of...
My visit to this place is not often as its far from my home but yeah I got three chances to be there and every time it was a really happy experience...A thumbs up from a foodie to this place because it knows to content ones never ending desire for having yummy food...

First time at BBQ. Must say that the ambience is awesome for group outings. Went for the buffet option here as everyone else does but was a bit sceptical about it. But no doubts in my mind as the food is great with all the kebabs which will always keep you interested for more of it. I felt that the kebabs option was a bit less to my liking but that was well adequated with a rather long main course menu. Ending with awesome desserts such as hot gulab jamun, firnee,pudding,custard,kulfi,cake, pastry,fruits and........what more. Highly reconmended from me.

Part of a chain of Indian restaurants,,,, Kolkata‚Äôs¬†Barbeque Nation¬†offers a truly one-of-a-kind dining experience.... A dinner here starts with a pre-fixed menu of five barbecued starters which are the real draw of all Barbeque Nation‚Äôs outlets... Each table is equipped with a grill that guests can use to keep their starters warm or glaze with the accompanying marinades nd sauces... All tables also have a little flag: the alert service keeps the starters coming until the flag is up.... If you wish to take a break or proceed to the main courses,,, signal this by folding the flag down... The extensive spread of dishes offered at Barbeque Nation are influenced by international cookings,,, but deeply founded on India‚Äôs national cuisine.....

Yes its a eat all you can place.  . The concept here is that they keep bringing starters until you put a flag that is put on your table..  In a sense that you surrender and can not eat any more.  After that you can go and have your main course and desserts from the buffet. But the big point here is that they take great care of your preferences.  They will bring those starters which you like even if they cost more to them..  say mushroom tikka. There is a nice live band. All items are tasty but the smell of non vegetarian starters being served on the tandoor on the next table could be too much for a vegetarian sometimes. Oh i forgot..  There is cutout in the table where they put a live coal tandoor!!! when you take seat.  So you can have all the tandoori starters direct from the tandoor.  üò±Really nice concept..  Price point is also ok if you know how to vasulo paisa

Don't think this place requires any more reviews, but this is exclusively for the green dot people who might wana take a try at this place. I would suggest vegetarians to go and try once.  May be twice. But after that you would get dead bored of it. Same food, same taste, same items, same desert! After 5 odd visits there i can literally play guess the ingredients of the food here! All the non veg people love to go there, as you can gobble all you want and unlimited!!

Eat with no bounds.. Whenever I plan to visit this place or any of its branch I prefer to remain empty stomach all through te day. They serve 5-6 types of starters if u r non veg which gets added up with some delicacies from the veg side.. The main course is OK.. But again the desserts are again heart stealing.. The brownies, the cakes, the customisable kulfis.. Wah!!

Forgot bout the ambience, it's good too!! :p

I would like to give this restaurant rating of 10 instead of 5....... we went on 28th April during dinner time at this place in Salt Late sector.......The place is absoultely magnetic and so are the staff members ... they were so so happy in feeding us... even a chef came and asked us about the food quality and its preparation which we hardly see in any other restaurant. There were about 10 starters as we opted for VEG and we could not get enough of them....... felt like keep eating them non stop ... but our stomach gave the answer.......... we ate the starters soo much that we could not even look at the main course menu........ than we had deserts which were also mind blowing........ having a live kulfi counter having more than 6 kulfis with topping man on man... it was too good....... i am not a avid kulfi fan but i still ate 3 kulfi's ....... We again plan to visit them on Sunday the 8th of May as its my wifes birthday and we want to celebrate it at Barbeque Nation.

From the point of time when we stepped in to the point when we stepped out, service was extremely good. They have a standard menu which offers all you can eat kebabs, both veg and non veg, and a buffet dinner follows afterwards. The quality of food is very good and the taste worth remembering. The best thing about the place was that my friend was celebrating her birthday, and one of the waiters asked us if there was any special occasion. On finding lot the occasion, my friend was given a cake lit with a candle on the house, with a happy birthday song dedicated to her. It is gestures like this, apart from the amazing food, which make u have fond memories of a place and makes u want to go back. Also with such reasonable prices, why not? I'm definitely going back n going to recommend this place to all I know.

Big 5/5 for amazing food and ambience , I however  had an observation today.

Service was not that swift when we went to dine around 2.30 PM today , it usually is very fast and staffs are quite proactive in the opening hours ( 12 noon lunch time ). The chefs usually come for feedback ,which was unseen of, today. Otherwise, everything is amazingly awesome .

Barbeque Nation!!!!!!! It's my favourite. They serve the best kebabs and the best dessert in Kolkata.
Amazing is an understatement for such a restaurant. I don't like prawns too much, but the Prawn kebab at nation is my favourite. The biriyani in the main course is fantastic. I love the chicken salad and everything else.
This place is a foodie's paradise. Brilliant service and amazing food

They sing for you and get you a cake if it's your birthday üòÉ
However they should really consider improving on their main course because it's pretty average in terms of its taste when compared to the mind blowing starters and desserts.

This place has got to be every Kebab lover's Paradise. This place has got great kebabs and that too on an unlimited basis.. Which means you can finally satisfy your mind as well as your body ^_^
Also they have a unique system of "Serve until Flag Down" which catches the eye. Apart from the Kebabs.. The main course has a variety of items too and the desserts are too very good. The ambience is very lively as the crowd is mainly of office-goers and young people. Overall.. This place is indeed one of the best restaurants in Kolkata !!!

The best ever ! I was at bbq nation for dinner last night and I was just amazed at their service . They were extremely courteous and the service was super swift . The live music being played were the english classics from 90's . They had a great spread of starters. I also totally loved their desserts menu which included a whole lot of kulfis . Paan kulfi was the winner üëç We also got an early bird's special discount . Will be looking forward to dining with them again üòç

Heard a lot about this place before going there this Saturday and I must say that the food exceeded my expectations! Mouth watering kebabs and amazing desserts. Main course was equally good. "Eat all you want" is the speciality of this place :-) The waiters are cordial and during the lunch even the chef came out to ask us if we are liking the food. Overall lovely experience. I'm definitely gonna come back to this place.

Very few places deserve and get 5.0!

Won't comment on the food coz let's face it, each of us know it's super amazing, right from the 15 starters to the 10 desserts.

What really caught me was the service.
1. They explained each and every thing and the process since it was my first time there.
2. Live music was playing (and they were pretty bad ass at it), they made a point to take a song suggestion from each and every table.
3. My dad requested a happy birthday song since it was my birthday and they gave a complimentary cake on their own.
4. The next day I received a feedback call asking for the service, food quality, things to improve on, whether I had a reservation or was it a walk-in, and if we were allocated the table immediately.

Rarely do you encounter such great service and food all at once.

We went here on a dinner date to celebrate our anniversary .Knowing how popular this place is we made reservations . We waited 5 mins outside before being seated .The skewers kept on coming in and every bite of it was awesome .The mutton keema kaleji was the star among all .The waiters were courteous and asked us what we liked and we wanted anything more .So far the only restaurant in Kolkata where the chef came to ask us about what we liked and genuinely appreciated our feedback .The sumptuous meal ended with some awesome PAN flavoured Kulfi and hot Gulaab jamuns . We loved the place and plan to be there some day soon .TIP: plan to be here on a weekday lunch before 12:30 pm and you get early bird discounts which can save you a couple of 100 bucks :)- happy eating cheers

I just could not take pictures of the food and all as the overwhelming food just shook my senses and ordered me to devour all the food as soon as they arrived. From where should I start mentioning, the food or the location or the interiors or the floor managers? This review might not be a good one as a lot of thoughts are coming across my mind. We visited here to celebrate the home coming of my friend. The buffet has a large variety of food which look as good as they taste. the chicken kebab, tengri kebab, mutton sheekh kebab, fish and prawn kebabs were so overwhelmingly tasty that we could not go for the veg kebabs. In main course the chicken dub biriyani had a subtle yet flavorful taste. I loved the chicken butter masala and the mutton railways. I did not have space to try the sarson fish or any other veg items though they were all good looking especially the paneer butter masala. The dessert section which had caramel custard, gulab jamun, firnee, chocolate cake, mango cheese cake and water melons won my heart ¬†I loved all the kulfi they had especially the pan flavoured kulfi. I loved the concept of live performance where they took care of my request to hear "Hotel California". I just loved the place and foremost the hosts were very good to us, they took care of all our silly requests and demands and repeatedly enquired about of comfort and their service. Thak you team for taking care of us and making our evening special.

One of the oldest and best buffet places in the city of joy! Located at sector 5 this place is a crowd puller for office crowd as well as families! The service and hospitality is class apart, the main the quality of food though buffets are mainly quantity oriented. For the starters... The paneer to the chicken to the fish and the prawn were amazing. I dis not like the mutton sheekh much. For maincourse it was some amazing baked dish, the biryani, a fish curry and noodles which were my picks. The salads were well made though the nonveg salads hardly had any nonveg in it. The desserts were yummy, gajar ka hawa and blackforest  pastry were nice :)

Situated amidst the bustling IT Sector, it's quite a crowd puller. Even more so, during the weekends. The starters are it's main draw. It's barbequed veg and non veg items were too good. They took feedback about the Food from time to time. And I'm knowing, we didn't like a particular fish item, they served us a new item, without keeping us waiting for long. Service was quite good. The buffet was above average. The dessert platter was impressive! They even offered us a complimentary drink from their given list. One could get more than a wholesome lunch/dinner within a justified price!

Definitely one of the best place for dining in salt lake, BBQ lives up to its reputation. Good food, amazing ambience. The quality of food is as usual unquestionable Starters will take most part of your empty stomach and the remaining will be taken by desserts, so you'll hardly get to taste the main course. At times u might have to wait for 15-20 mins to get a table but it's worth it

Barbeque Nation is an absolute heaven for buffet lovers. The starters are absolutely delicious. Every single starter is perfect. Moreover grilling the starters by yourself issue quite a lot of fun! I had gone there with my parents sometime ago and we ate a tremendous amount of food! We definitely got our money's worth. By the taste well were through with starters, we were almost full. So I did not try much from the mains. I had some Biryani and some fish curry and some mutton curry. The Biryani was really good! Even the fish and mutton were full of flavour! Sadly could not try other dishes as I was saving some space for Desserts :-P
The desserts were very tasty. There was a huge spread from tarts to fruits to ice creams. Everything was great! 
The food as a whole is defined tasty but I must say it's not THE BEST. What really gives it the edge is the fact that all the dishes are consistently great and hence it is found to be value for money.
For those who can't eat much, this is not an ideal place as you're can get better food in terms of flavour elsewhere at some chosen restaurants! 
But I have to say, what you receive is way better than what you have paid for! 

If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.

Fantastic buffet, excellent spread and a wide range of options. The starters and the desserts are to die for. If you are one with a small appetite, I'd recommend just grazing past the main course, because if you have too much of it, you hardly have any space left for the totally yummy desserts. 
Highly recommend this place for a fantastic brunch with family or friends.

Its any Foodies Paradise. Eat as much as u can.
I Would have added another 5 to explain how good is this place if i could, this is my 1st visit to this here. This is not exaggerated, they are extra ordinary.
It was my sweetheart's Birthday and i choose this place to celebrate it, nothing could have been better than this.
Right From the start reception to the pan coolfi to end with everything is better than the best.
Ambience was good , actual the good food doesnt let u notice the surrounding, we visited in the afternoon session as such i guess the live music was not availabe though.
The starters there is no scope of improvement in this section i guess. Right from the sweet babycorn to the mutton shami kabab all were so tasty, so fresh and spices so accurate.
Main course i tried to remember were did i last tast such perfect biriyani with the flavours so distinct and the chicken so succulent.
Desserts , they could easily name it dessert nation too its so good. The variety of items were so impressive
At places the staff can be a big let down, here they were ever so courteous , always smilling , attentive like they could read the eyes, ready to help with all information.
They also had a surprise for us a birthday cake for her , even it was so good. Though its never about a cake or a candy but its about the warmth they did it with.
Take a bow barbeque nation salt lake. Keep it up guys.

Real good food, great staff and a perfect ambience .
The staff here is eager to serve you , you do not have to remind them over and over again for some order , unlike some restaurants serving buffet where you have to repeatedly ask for your order 
If there is some dish you really love and they don't have it that day on there menu they prepare it for you if you request, and yes if you visit this place don't forget to try the paan and malai kulfis.
I would say it is a total paisa vasool .
A perfect place for foodies , couples and even great fun with family.

Live Jelebis counter was interesting.During payment of bill I mistakenly gave  them 1000 Rs extra which was returned to me.Thank you BBC nation. I will be back soon.Value for money 10/10.

Main course is average, this being the reason for keeping back a star...
Coming to deserts,they are awesome....
The mini gulabjamuns and rabdi...
I love their wide range of kulfis,the paan flavour being my favourite...
Overall it is a very good restaurant...
Not too pocket-friendly but then again Kolkatans can spend hefty amounts on food....

This place is simply amazing when it comes to Kebabs. The non-veg buffet begins with 5 veg and 5 non veg starters with a complimentary welcome drink. The fish and prawn starters stand out in terms of taste from the others. The main course has a huge spread with a variety of North Indian dishes. The dessert section is simply amazing with a kulfi counter serving 6 different flavours. Above all the hospitality and service of Barbeque nation separates it as the best from the rest.

My last to last experience was not that amazing. But last week I had a opportunity to visit this place.¬†
As the name suggest the the menu is dominated with grills.¬†
The Buffet had a huge set of starters flowing fresh and continuously. They had some amazing prawn and mutton preparations. The starters were great, was worth indulging. Well the mains were not bad too. They were pretty good.¬†
Now comes the best part, the service, the service team deserves a salute, amazing hospitality, great hosting. The staffs are just too good. The best part is the attention that they give to every-individual is something worth. The managers are great, the waiter weren't confused, they exactly understood the need of a customer, even the person on the table speaks out his or her requirement. The people in the service were extremely humble and courteous. Honestly speaking, even star-rated properties should learn from them.¬†
The food was worth eating, definitely very tasty as compared to the other buffet places. At least far better than their immediate stupid competitor ! Guys learn from their service team and then dream¬†competing¬†them. ¬†
Keep Rocking !!

Food at Barbeque Nation in one word is delicious! We had non veg starters. Be it prawn or chicken wings or mutton all were cooked to perfection. However the fish kebabs stole the show, it just melted in the mouth. Even the vegetarian starters which come along with non veg starters were awesome. After the starters we managed to eat only desserts. The pan kulfi was out of box and nice. The firni tasted good too! Service is promt and waiters are courteous. The buffet spread had many options. However the lonely let down were the fellow diners who talked (read screamed) throughout very loudly. Would love to come back.

Excellent and unbeatable! An endless supply of kebabs made from chicken, prawns, lamb and fish. Followed by a buffet that is mostly untouched as most of one's appetite is appeased with the endless starters. The service can be a bit faster, though. And the taste of the kebabs needs a closer look by the chef. All in all, a buzzing place, for sure.

Disclaimer:This is the review of a self-confessed glutton with a Joey Tribbiani-esque appetite.
I have been planning to go to this place since January 2015.After several failed plans I landed up here on Good friday before catching a show of Batman V Superman.My boyfriend and I reached there at 11.45 am without prior reservations and were skeptical whether we would get a table or not considering the huge crowd that had already gathered there.We did get our table as soon as the doors were open at 12 pm since we had gotten the 7 th 'impromptu-reservation' token.
The place is sprawling and the decor is really classy and inspite of being jam-packed your conversation is not buzzed down due to loud chatter or inappropriate music.
After taking our orders for the complementary drinks(I went for an amazing iced tea while my partner got himself a refreshing fresh lime soda),the grill was set up and the starters started coming in.
We were served deep fried american corn first,followed by pineapple,mushrooms and paneer on the grill.Frankly if this wouldn't have been a buffet I would have kinda loved eating these dishes as the taste was fine but they are not good enough if you want to save space for the non vegetarian spread.In no time we were served fish,chicken and prawn kebabs on the grill interspersed by tandoori chicken wings and mutton seekh kebabs on the platter.Baring the fish kebab(I personally don't like fish in the first place)I loved the rest of the starters.My pick would be the tandoori chicken wings.Juicy,charry,succulent,it hit all the right spots.By the time the last seekhs of prawn came in, I was so full that I couldn't pig out on them but they were perfectly cooked and really delicious.A tip while eating the starters would be not to forget the lip-smacking pudina chatni,3 kinds of dips and butter kept by the grill for basting the kebabs.They just accentuate the taste that much further.
Most of the zomato reviews deem the main course as ho-hum so I just took 2 ladle fulls of chicken biryani,some chicken nizami handi gravy and a few pieces of mutton roganjosh.Surprisingly I LOVED the biryani and it went fabulously well with the rich chicken gravy and onion lachchas.The mutton was amazingly tender but the gravy was strictly okay.
Next we pounced on the desserts.I tasted the firni,sewaiyyan,gulab jamun,brownie with vanilla icecream drowned in chocolate sauce and kesar and malai kulfi with faluda and rose syrup from the kulfi counter.Well I would have paid the whole bill amount for the dessert part alone.Moreish would be an understatement.They are the star of the impeccable line-up.
The bill came out to be 732 rs all inclusive per head and boy were we happy after the 1.5 hour grand carnival.

I am a regular client at this popular eating place in Kolkata but yesterday was a tad disappointing in terms of the food, the seasonings in the grilled items and the assorted salads were either low or high. Was expecting a welcome drink like Thandaai on the occasion of holi which was missing.The main course and desserts were ok. Could have introduced some special holi sweets like 'Gujiyas'.
Just 10 days back I dined there with my family during the sea food festival and the food layout was spectacular with fantastic taste.

Such has never happened before and was not expected from BBQ nation..

Hope they take notice of this and taste the food before serving it out (specially the salads--they were so high on salt)

Nevertheless I am their fan and this is supposed to be a constructive criticism.I shall visit again with rekindled hopes.

If only I could have given it a 5+ rating. The service guys along with the ambiencr are, as usual, impeccable.

We went for buffet on a Sunday. The price was 730INR including tax. The menu was same old with kebabs raining of fish, mutton, chicken, prawn and several different veg starters. There is a new live pasta counter which was too delicious.

0.5 points are deducted as the main course was not so good. The mutton was not soft and the biriyani was ok.

The dessert section is a big winner. With gulab jamun, firni, pancake, fruits, ice-creams cakes- just a treat. Add to that there is a new koolfi counter where there are 6 different kind of koolfis, the flavors being pan, kesar, mango, strawberry, chocolate and one more.

Barbeque Nation, a chain of restaurants that has captured the prime seat in the hearts of foodies all over India! Iv been to other Barbeque nation outlets in different parts of the country and this one is among the better ones !
The service was super fast , and the food needs no introduction. It's basically an all you can eat place, and not a gud place to take your little eating/die conscious friends to!

Pros:
1. Yum!
2. Prominent location
3. Great ambience/ live music 

Cons:
1. Huge waiting time on key days. Maybe it's time to expand !

This is by far the best place to be if you are really fond of North Indian food. The starters are just too good n they serve top most quality. They have a long list of starters and desserts as well. Even the main course is very good. But if you plan to be here n have the best for your tummy one should go for the starters and desserts and enjoy the food. The most striking thing about this place is the ambience and most importantly the behaviour of the people who serve. You will really feel honourable when the chef will personally come and meet you and ask for feedback. This place has really some high standards. Pure bliss.

Eat. Eat. Eat. Repeat. - This is the mantra u need to follow if u are here. 
Starting from the starters u may want to stuff urself with enough starters to make urself cry. It is that good. Chicken, fish, prawn kebabs were served to us along with chicken wings, and we couldn't just Control ourselves and put the flag down, or maybe, we shouldn't have. 
Main course, after the starters of such supreme quality, seem lilliputs in taste. But the desserts were back to bring the smile back to ours faces.
The experience was fantastic. And of course the stuff were very organized and well behaved. 
Talk about the best places to visit in Kolkata, this comes right at the top of the stack.

I have seen the huge craze for barbeque nation,salt lake. 6-7 families waiting outside the door luckily we booked 12 seats..there happy hours starts from 12pm and ends at 12:30pm.we entered into the restaurant..
Ambiance: simple with live music available,slow music, good couch and cushions, washroom available.
On the table 1set of sauces like mayonnaise, chili sauce and tomato sauce..
1set of oil for greasing the kebabs like butter,oregano oil and chili oil..
Starters : grilled pineapple,button mushroom,paneer kebabs,barbeque chicken wings,chicken kebabs,mutton kebabs,fish kebabs,prawn kebabs and veg kebab..they also served crispy baby corn chat and dahi aloo chat which was too good.. but the taste of non-veg kebabs were same as I felt..
*They serve 1 complimentary drink the choices are: beer,fresh lime soda,Pepsi and aam panna.
Salads: green salad, chicken salad and prawn salad.
Main course : chicken dum biriyani, mutton curry, sarson fish, chicken gravy,choice of bread,veg pulao,schezwan noodles, veg Manchurian and many more..
biriyani and mutton was good but fish was stale. Barbeque you are best in Indian dish but Chinese is pathetic especially Manchurian was high in salt and tasteless..
Dessert: Vanilla and caramel pudding,fresh fruits, vanilla cheesecake, chocolate pastry,fruit cake,hot mini gulab jamuns,fruit tart,firni,vanilla ice-cream and choices of sauce available.
*ATTRACTIVE SECTION - Kulfi: badam,kesar pista,chocolate,mango,strawberry and pan kulfi and there assorted toppings.
............................................................................................
Ratings:
Starters : 4.5/5
Main course: 3.5/5
Dessert: 5/5
**One best thing for this restaurant one can leave the table while eating have a smoke and fresh air then get back to eating..
**customer service and staffs are slow at a time..
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

You will find all good things in other review comment. Let me share my own story. I went with my wife during sea food festival.. There was a bit of coconut smell in the Pulao.. When she said that, they said its because of coastal flavour and asked whether they would freshly prepare it. I was overwhelmed with their hospitality.

Starters were mouth watering.
Specially the fish and chicken were delicious.
Didn't try much of the main course.
Gulab jamun and coolfi was awesome.

The experience was wonderful.. The Chef, himself came to hear our commentary over the food. The food was the nicest one. In 732 rs one can stuff a hell lot of stuff into the tummy.. The respective waiter for our table asked us if we have any special occasion or not..we replied a "yes", as it was my parents 25th marriage anniversary.. And it was a complete surprise for all of us when the man came with a black forest cake with a lighted candle on top and wrote happy anniversary on the cake. Yesterday, there was a sea food carnival also. The complimentary lemon soda was wonderful as it helps digesting everything and makes way in your tummy for more delicious foods. Hospitality at its best.

The concept of on table grill is awesome. Ambiance is really good.
I visited this place a couple of weeks back and it was my second encounter with BBQ Nation.The staff is also very good and hospitable.
¬†This place is awesome for starters. They have variety of starters in both veg and non veg. ¬†After having the mind blowing starters, the main course was kind of a let down. The mutton curry was the only saving grace for main course. Then again, the deserts section was great. The live kulfi counter is the best thing about the deserts.

Overall, its a great place to visit if you want to have starters and deserts. Main course is still a let down, i hope they can improve on that and then this place can be worthy of a 5 rating.

The big buffet menu, the always crowded reception and the fast continuous service makes this place really special. The food is amazing. The deserts are better. As long as your don't put your flag down, the kebabs keep rolling in and it's really hard to stop them because they're just amazing. The main course is again something great but after all the kebabs it's hard to push much of it into your stomach. Then comes the best part of the meal which is the desert. Sweets, ice cream, cakes and kulfi is all you can have in a single desert menu.
Worth a visit for sure.

I love the concept of this restaurant for I love kebabs. Their kebabs are delicious and come in a variety as well, but the buffet is unimpressive. My suggestion would be to gorge on the kebabs as much as you can and fill your stomachs, because you don't want to lose apetite over an average buffet after gormandizing on great kebabs. Rating it  4, and not 5 only because of the buffet.

As far as food is concerned the starters were fav i must say...now going to main dish,the quality lacked that punch compared to the former and every cuisine tasted sweet which i personally didnt like...and at last were the desserts and gulab jamuns stole the show for me..kulfis tasted ok type as regular and pastries were good.

overall i wud rate it 4.5

This is not the first time I have been to this place which is already a big name in this city . This is the highest rated restaurant in Kolkata and there are very few people who doubt their   5 star rating . But being the best is not good enough . Being consistent is the key for every good restaurant no matter how much footfall it gets . So BBQ nation comes up with varities of options very frequently and we decided to try their recently happening "Seafood festival " which ends March 13 , 2016 . So they are serving their usual dishes and have added some seafood items . Now the question is has their experiment worked ? It's a big fat "NO " .
As usual their usual starters were terrific . we loved  their chicken tangri kabaab ,coriender chicken , BBQ grilled prawns ( yummy ) . But the seafood items that were included in the starters : - 


1. Fried squid ( 3.5 / 5 )
2. Fried pomfret ( 1 / 5 )

The pomfret was a huge disaster . coming to the main course , we were really excited about having a crab item in the menu . Some of us were planning to concentrate only on the crab but alas it was a complete downer . The dish was named "Jaffna devilled crab " and there was nothing devil about it . Mostly they were shells which had very less meat . 

The "srilankan shrimp rice " was okaish but still not something to crave for . The " halwa fish curry " is the basic Bengali fish curry so nothing to talk about that . 

The other items in the menu are as usual nothing much to talk about since everybody already knows about BBQ nation main course . I thought the mutton was the only saving grace in the main section .

The deserts were as usual very very good . The firni was classy and the kulfis at the end just give you the right farewell to a fine dining experience . 

My 4 star rating is for the starters and deserts and I feel that is what people should go for once in a while . It is not really bad experimenting but it is not a bad idea to be consistent in what you already do best . So the food festival is a huge flop but BBQ nation is still a hit for its usual food .

This is from a guy who isn't particularly fond of kebabs and Indian food that forms the backbone of bbq nation. 
This would be a combined review of all my visits and I wont talk about the kebabs and main courses here as I dont expect anyone to actually not know about them. 
What I would write particularly about this branch is their hospitality, their zeal to take customer satisfaction to the point where they make bespoke dishes just for ibe table (yes they served us even chilly fish!) 
The live counter that served white snapper wd mango pickle and the calamari were a surprise in the last visit and both lived up to the bbq standards. 
Probably bbq have the greatest variety of deserts in city that you get in a buffet. 
Wil end it by thanking bbq fr bringing kulfi into the menu. 
Would I go back? Absolutely not a kebab/ North Indian food lover. Stil its difficult to turn this place down.

My first encounter with Barbeque Nation was at this outlet! Awed by the new concept of on table grill. With a very warm welcome by the staff, the place is filled with the aroma of grilled veggies and meat. The grilled prawns are just out of the world and do save some place for the lavish main course that they spread out. Do try the dum gosht biryani and the deserts are splendid too.

I have nothing new to say about this modern-day-legend restaurant... just go there and enjoy to the fullest... a fine glitch in their armour is that their main courses are not nearly as good as its starters and deserts, but you won't complain as the kebabs more than make up for it... Last but not the least, the ambience and the service is also wonderful... So, go and have a blast... :-)

When you are hungry and want to eat a variety of unlimited food Barbeque nation is the place to visit. Awesome starters and fabulous desserts. I generally skip the main course. Highly recommended.
Ps- Don't miss the kulfis. The best kulfis i have had till date.

Barbeque Nation-"A paradise for the foodies"
After a prolonged waiting, finally had come to this place which was in my wishlist since a long time. I had experienced flame and grill , siegree earlier. But this is the first time in barbeque nation located at sector V beside RDB. Now I can conclude this is the best buffet in the town without any kind of doubt. This is known for its wide enormous variety in starters and desserts. At first we were offered one round of complementary drinks comprising of beer(tuborg),aam panna,soft drinks etc. In starters there were chicken hariali kababs, fish,prawn,mutton shiek kabab,chicken drumsticks, sweet corns, squids. The drumsticks didn't taste good. All others were outstanding. Next in the main courses there are plenty of veg and non veg dishes. I tasted chicken biriyani, crab, one praperation of mutton( could not remember the exact name). There were also one preparation of chicken in gravy , two fish item, soups, salads etc. Now the best thing of this restaurant for which I was delighted is the dessert. Hot gulab jamuns, two type of chocolate cakes, firni, vanilla ice cream with three sauces, fresh watermelons and papayas, six type of kulfis. 
The staffs were very polite and well-behaved. They asked several times whether they should repeat the previous dishes or not.
It costs Rs. 732 including service tax and vat per head. If you can enter within 12-12:30 pm on mon-thu u have to pay Rs. 630/head. Overall it is worth every single penny.

Knowing this restaurant to be the best buffet joint in kolkata we decided to drop by there. The kebabs here are unmatched. There are many varieties in the kebabs. But the biriyani and the mutton dish disappointed us though the deserts were a class apart.

On 28th Feb, I went to Barbeque Nation, after hearing so much praise about them. I experienced the most delicious foods among other Kolkata buffet restaurants. There was so much food, that you can' t have it all. All the kababs and starters were fantastic to say the least.

Finally visited this legendary place which has been on my wishlist for a long time.
It was my first visit to barbq nations, however not my 1st visit to a place of this kind as i have already visited its competitors, flame nd grill (9 times) nd sigree.
Now coming to the ambience, its warm and cosy and was a fine dining in all sense. Althou posch, it was nothing spectacular and it was a bit cramped up and less spacious.
We were offered complementary drink which includes beer(tuborg pite) , lime soda as well as soft drinks. Now not many places you beer as complementary drink!
Coming to the food..the variety of starters delighted me. Initially we were served grilled corn which was tasty. No other place serves this. Now i was spoilt for choice at the range of starters as we were served with both veg and non veg varities. At other places u are not served both variants and in veg not so many options are available.
However the grilled kebabs tasted good. Not too spicy or pungent. While fish, prawns, paneer, mushrooms and chicken skewers keep coming to the live charcoal grill, we were also served chicken drumstick , calamari fry and the spcl mutton seik kabab. The seik kabab was delightful.
The starters were good and appetizing.
Next on the main course..there was a wide variety. If u want naan or roti, u need to place orders to the servers. The main course is good and the wide variety will keep you happy. Its not the same boring menu that you would xpct frm any other outlet of its kind.
However none of the main course stood out.
Now what sets bbq apart frm its other counterparts, is its dessert section and the live kulfi counter. U will definitely be spoilt for choice with the wide assortment of desserts available ranging from mousse to brownie to gulabjamun with rabri, fresh fruits and others
The live kulfi counter cannot be missed serving delicious combinations of kulfi.
Service was fast and decent!
This place is a paradise for food hoggers who want to relax and enjoy their meal for a long time. They also give early bird offer to people who comes in btw 12 to 12.30.
Worth every penny!!!

We dropped by here for dinner, and it was a nice and fun experience altogether. The interior is quite good; ambiance and the live singing adds to the happy mood. They have a very wide range of starters and those are pretty delicious! Main course and dessert items are sumptuous as well. Although I would say the starters are quite better than the main course dishes served. No complaints about the service too, nice behaviour and quite prompt too. As per the taste of the food, I expected better, and I feel maybe this restaurant has been over hyped a bit and thus I refrain myself from rating this more than 4/5 overall.

I'm not really a buffet person, but i visited bbq nation since I've heard so much about it and it was a good decision. They have a grill on the table to cook the starters and then eat it. It's a great experience. I hardly had any mains but they were pretty good too. And the desserts were also amazing.

Everybody is aware of the simple fact that Barbeque Nation is good and you get total value for money. Hence, I would not make a fool of myself to describe that. Instead I would point out five items that blew my mind this Friday.
1. Alu Posto. Have it with some plain rice. The unique part about this Alu Posto was it was not pasted before cooking and that turned out to make it delicious.
2. Kashmiri Malai Kofta. Don't have it along with roti or rice. Get it in a bowl, and just have it like that.
3. Fish Curry. The Curry tasted outstanding. The fish tasted like fish.
4. Pan Kulfi. Don't wait for a review or anything. Just have it.
5. Chocolate Kulfi. Again, just have it.

The desserts were awesome. Tarts, pastries, coolfi, gulab jamun... all are good and very tasty. Overall a good experience.

BBQ Nation is the place for all the food cravers coz it serves the best buffet in Kolkata.   The mouthwatering kebabs, a huge buffet spread & some awsome desserts served by some courteous and always smiling staff in a lovely ambience will make ur visits here countless. If you had not yet been here ensure its your next lunch/ dinner venue and then you lament  what u missed. Dont step back seeing the prices as its more than value for money.

I went there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch today with my family,

Opted for veg and non veg buffet as part of the group.

On the non veg platter ,they had 1 chicken sizzler , fish sizzler ,prawn sizzler.fish was ok ,rest were quite good.chicken wings were spicy and juicy.

Mutton galouti was very soft and spiced.

On the veg platter best was a fried aloo dish- catjun potato.rest included grilled european vegetables,paneer tikka,tandoori aloo with andoori aloo was perfect balance

aditional part of starter was fried corn which was quite an unique snack.

They provided complimentary drink with choice of aam panna, lime soda, soft drinks,beer

They also provide a live pasta counter with choice of white and cheese pasta.we tried cheese pasta which was really very well prepared

Main course had choice of chicken biryani, chicken gravy item ,fish dissh .on the veg side they had option of veg polao, chilly garlic noodles, gobi manchurian,  dry aloo posto which was posto on top of fried  aloo and was really good.

They have a good assortment of desserts with firni,cheesecake,chocolate brownie fudge,fruit cake ,caramel custard ¬†& vanilla ¬†& strawberry ice cream choices

They now also have a kulfi counter with choices including mango,kesar,strawberry and paan kulfi.paan kulfi was really a standout and must try.

For us chicken biryani with its fantastic fragrance and lightness with very tender chicken pieces and paan kulfi with its  flavouring were really standout dishes.

it cost us 585 /head with discount.

defintely waiting for next visit,this was my 2nd visit within 1 month.last was for dinner with my office colleagues,

one thing they can improve upon is changing choice of starters but addition of kulfi conter recently is a definite winning step

Yesterday was Valentines Night and i decided to spend the time with my better half here and of course satisfy my voracious appetite (of food :-) ) that was building up slowly.
Chose the salt lake outlet basically due to Parking issues in Park street. :-p
But who knew another trouble was waiting up, reached there and was told :- Waiting time- 1hr 30 mins. Gosh... so much of time .. and so much hunger... went to a cafe beside just to hang around and save us from the mosquitos outside. Had a nice coffee though.
My phone rang and i was invited to have the seats at BBQ nation.Quickly went inside ..
Very nice staff. Polite and well behaved.Very welcoming.
Opted for Non veg Buffet.. There came the Live grill with a whole lot of kebabs following.
-Fish/Chicken/Prawn/Pineapple . I loved to roast them stick by stick.
We were also served Corn crunchy masala and mutton kebab along with aloo kebab on our plates. Later came the chicken wings.
I was confused what to start with.. they were all super deliiiiccccccious.Special mention- Fish kebab:- Succulent,soft,awesome masala and of course awesome taste.So i had about 5 grills of it i think.
Aloo kebab:- Never had something like this. Totally crunchy outside and buttery smooth inside..
Crunchy Corns- Simply awesome.. a little sweetish which was pairing up pretty good.
Prawns were so so.. as i felt they could have been more cooked from inside.
I was biased towards fish ,so the chicken grill was feeling neglected.. but i savoured it too.
I gained atleast 1 kg stat i guess and the main course was still left.
Cleared up and went for the main course.
Took small portions of - Chicken Dum biriyani,Handi Gosht,dora Wat chicken, Amritsari fish curry.
Biriyani was average,Handi gosht was awesome- well boiled and cooked pieces .
The Chicken item was also very good, less masala and oil, a little light type which i desired for after the monstrous kebab chapter.
Fish curry was also fine but i couldnt have it enough as i was already full ; but it was well cooked with all the correct ingredients.
Went on to the Desserts-
Lauki ke rabri - too good.
Mango Phirnee
Gulab jamun (warm)
Orange pastry
Fruit tart.. to name a few.
Mind craved but stomach said a big No.Couldnt have more .I was a few kilo heavy already i guess :-D
There was a live Kulfi counter which served - Pan/Malai/Mango/Chocolate/Kesar pesta/Strawberry flavoured Kulfis which would be served to you with perfect syrups and toppings. Had a few. And bid goodbye to the Food chapter.
Came the bill .Under 2k. Extras taken- Beer and VLC ( not the player - rather Vodka with lime cordial)

Location - Beside RDB saltlake
Experience - 8/10
Kebab-9/10
Main course - 8/10
Dessert- 10/10

Definitely Recommended to all foodies.
As i am writing this i am feeling hungry again.. oh gosh.

BARBEQUE NATION , which seems to be the  new love of all the foodies of kolkata..

serves..amazing starters..

prawn fish chicken mutton...yes all of them

¬†the fish is to die for..absolutely fantastic...

coming to the main course the chicken dum biriyani is very good,,the chicken is tender and juicy,,

although i neither liked the chicken nor the fish in the main course....

the desserts are FANTASTICCCCCCC

ESPECIALLY THE CHOCOLATE KULFI ,,

ITS fabuloussssss....

the menu consists of large variety of tasty foods...

and frankly all cant be eaten..just cant be..( unless you are a giant for something ..lol)

¬†could not give a perfect 5.0 rating bcoz of the too spicy amritsari fish and aloo gobi sabji in the main course,,

plus the salads are not so attractive,,

however,,.must try this GIANT BUFFET ONCE ...

the service is veryyy prompt and good,,,one of the most polite service in the city..i must say 

P.S : 1) THEY CHARGE 4% SERVICE CHARGE ( FYI...ITS NOT A TAX LEVIED BY GOVT.)..THUS TAKING EXTRA MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET OVER AND ABOVE THE NORMAL PRICE 

2) COMPLEMENTARY DRINKS ARE OFFERED BY THE RESTAURANT..

[AND ONE OF THEM IS BEER ,, :) :) ]

When it comes to great food there are few places which can beat barbeque nation! 
Whether it's the kebabs, or the yummilicious cocktails all the dishes on the menu are A-one!!
What takes the experience to another level is the service....even the chef gives u a personal visit once in a while to check on the feedback. 
Foodie tip: Go with a completely empty stomach if u r goin for the buffet......coz u can't get enough of those delicious kebabs!

Oh what do I say about this place! Well, I'm still not over my burps from tonight's dinner!

Food lovers' paradise and a perfect choice that'll help you reap every bit of the money that you pay. If you can eat and by eat I mean eat until you can barely breathe, this is the right place for you! 

We had hopped by on a Tuesday when dinner buffets are relatively cheaper at about 780 bucks minus the taxes. 

After tasting the Cajun Spicy Baby Potato and @Crispy Corn Pepper here,I swear I am never going to curse vegetarian dishes again! The non veg platter and starters were superb,each and every one of them. I especially enjoyed the fish (well,Bangalis afterall!)
The main course is a tad below the belt. The mutton was not well cooked and of poor quality. The chicken however tasted really well. Who cares about the main course when you have a table full of desserts to gorge on!

Yes, the best bit was of course choking on the desserts! My friends took a minimum of four servings and tried out eccentric combinations like mixing hot gulabjamuns with vanilla icecream haha! That is called getting high from good food! I especially enjoyed the tiny brownies over which I poured chocolate sauce (it's my favourite and most restaurants or weddings are so miserly in pouring enough chocolate sauce these days that I poured to my heart's content haha) and the paan flavoured kulfi.

I'd strongly recommend this place. It's not known for being the city's best buffet for no reason! Burrrp!

The obvious choice for a buffet. Barbeque is now synonymous with perfectly grilled kebabs, tandoors. The starters are the star of the whole course and very often filling enough for some to forgoe the entire main course! In non veg 2 chicken items fish prawn and sheekh kebab. I preferred the chicken reshmi coz it was melt in the mouth soft with just the right amount of seasoning. Be careful as to not overcook the meat as it tends to get stuck to the grill. Special mention about the fried corn which was new to me and i had more than 2 servings! For the main course they had a chicken and a mutton dish along with an egg item. Nothing extraordinary. Desserts were the usual mix of brownie icecream tiramisu and kulfi. Try the paan flavored kulfi it's a perfect end to a sumptuous buffet.

Went to have Sunday Lunch with family. The food was excellent as usual. Ambience and behaviour of the staff was very good. Apart from the buffet menu Pasta was also being served today. The pasta was well cook and very tasty. Moreover I found an addition to the kufti family - the chocolate kufti which was very yummy. Overall had a wonderful experience as usual.

It is undoubtedly one of the best buffet places in kolkata...with a host of other options just next door it still remains a prime attraction for buffet lovers...the food from the large number of starters to the huge spread of desserts including the signature kulfi sticks will surely make you come back to the place after your first visit...the service is also quite good and all these together contribute to the reputation that the placehas earned for itself

Not everyday one comes across such an incredible restaurant and surely Barbeque Nation makes sure that your experience with them is one of a kind. I hosted my boyfriend's surprise birthday party there and let me tell you, the staff was very helpful and cordial. Next comes the food and trust me, I was absolutely amazed by their serving process! Everything was so proper and the waiters were very friendly and they served without any hitch. I simply couldn't find any fault in their service.
One of my best experiences and I am looking forward to visit again.

Truly a foodie's hub. If you are in Kolkata and are ready to try out a buffet, Barbeque Nation is the place for you. The starters,the main course and finally the dessert, specially the gulab jamun..Oh my god! Thats like the cherry on top. You would get tired to having the food. But this place wont run out of serving you even more. Cheers! üòä

Awesome! Thats in one word.It offers a range of starters with real good quality of food.Tastes at its best.Kebabs they make are really worth being praised.Coming to the main course ,although by the time you go for this ,starters would have covered 1/4 of your tummy.The main course is good and has a good range whether you are a veggie,nv,a fish lover or chicken hooper.Coming to the deserts üòçüòçüòçüòç,its one amongst the best things that they serve out there you will be mesmerised by their  taste and quality... muffins,sweets,pastries and the list goes on!Their service is insanely fast and the ambience of the place is very vibrant.Its a bit on the expensive side but then if you are a foodie and hop around in search of quality food you should give it a try! ;)

As the Tag says 'Legendary'. 
Awesome buffet experience. Nonetheless at a not so high price. Getting a table at the restuarent is one of the main issue. Food quality and quantity - always a plenty. 
5-6 starters, 2 chicken tandoori, 1 prawn, 1 fish, 1 paneer tandoori. Other than that you get american fried and salted corn, chicken fry. Though it varies. 
I generally only go for the starters as I find them much better than the main course they have to offer. 
Chicken biryani, a chicken and a fish preparation along with crab/prawn is served as main course. 
Desserts has an array of kulfi's to try from. Pan and Kesar are my favorites. 
Other than these hot gulag jamun, mousse, 2-3 types of pastry (chocolate one is common)  and ice cream with chocolate sauce completes the desserts. 
And that's not the end!!! 
Fruits salads are also available as serving. 
Well as writing this review has been an enjoyable (long) experience - you will be in for a tr8 once you visit there....... üòú

Hands down, this is the best restaurant in Kolkata. I visited this Sector V outlet twice with a 2 years hiatus in between. The quality of food and the ambience have maintained its sumptuous appeal. The appetizers are indeed the best in town with even the veg ones being delicious. The dessert options are excellent and with the new Kulfi counter, there is no way this restaurant can get a score below 5.

PS: For people who want to visit Barbeque Nation by reserving a large table, here's the deal. For the lunch buffet, the restaurant accepts reservations only at 12 pm and 2 pm. In the time between, the entry is on a first-come-first-serve basis. We had only visited for lunch buffet both the times and I expect the dinner will also have a similar situation.

I had given a suggestion on their feedback call about the main course which i hope is brought into action.The main course does not live up to the levels set up by the starters and desserts. Paan kulfi is a must have! You cant ask for more!

Undoubted that this is the best buffet of Kolkata in a range below ‚Çπ 1000/-. To get the best experience one have to be predetermined about what he would like to eat because with myself being a voracious eater I realised that I had been unable to take single serving of all the dishes served when I had gone for the first time . 
Second time I had gone I had pre planned the menu in mind and had been very selective so as to make the maximum out of it.
Few important points to maximise the satisfaction level are as follows:
1. Come in loose comfortable cloths.
2. Do not have beer for a welcome drink , it reduces your capacity to intake.
3. Be there in time to enjoy the maximum servings of Barbeque .
4. It's more comfortable to sit on the chairs than the sofas.
5. Kulfis are awesome ......have some space for it beforehand.
Needless to mention here, the only guy who seemed to be annoyed here is the guy at the kulfi counter which I didn't like. Attitude was disturbing .

My first visit to "Barbeque Nation" and that's too on the auspicious eve of its 10th birthday: not only a delightful experience but also a day which will be preserved as a prized possession in my memoirs.
The ambience was itself very impressive and worth appreciating , and to add on to its decor, the interior was decorated for the occasion, which added an additional festive charm to the mesmerizing ambience.
So, to start of with, we(me and my family) were served with wide range of mouth watering kebabs. The way they serve the kebab on the table, with the charcoal oven inserted in the Central socket of the table, and the grilled pieces of kebabs aligned on it with the support of a stand is not only a mind blowing way to keep the kebabs tender, succulent, hot and fresh, but also a concept that deserves a standing ovation for its innovative presentation. And so far the taste is concerned, its something that's sure to make you fall in love with kebabs. Even the vegetarian kebabs were so tasty that, even a hardcore non vegetarian like me was delighted with it. And yeah!! The grilled pineapple and Cajun potatoes is something you just can't afford to lose to give a try among the veg ones!! And so far the non-veg ones are concerned, each and every dish was just outstandingly awesome.
In main course, the food was excellent I must say. From Biryani to mutton, each and every item was more of a delicacy that is sure to treat your taste buds with its signature touch of awesomeness. So while exploring through the variety of dishes, all of a sudden I got a stink in the fish in the very first bite. But I should mention the fact that its NOT A FAULT of "Barbeque Nation". Being a Bong, I'm a regular fish eater at home, and I easily figured it out that the problem is in the fish itself and not in the cooking/preparation at all. They have prepared it in the best way possible. So if someone deserves the blame its the supplier who supplied stale fish, and I cannot underestimate/underrate this restaurant for a mistake of someone else. Rather I should appreciate that the service staff and the chef himself were so humble that they apologized personally for a mistake which they have not committed at all, and were all set to replace my fish with a new one. However I preferred to stick on to the other main course items.
Coming to desserts, it seemed like each and every dish is crafted with the artistic considerations of a connoisseur. The taste of the desserts sure to linger in your tongue, and memory as well so as to make your head nod in delight, right then, and even after several days of your visit, for sure. And there comes the legend-The KOOLFI. Your visit is incomplete without trying out the awesome Koolfi served here in desserts.
Liked the concept of live music, and service staffs were super efficient in delivering the right assistance at right time. Their sense of hospitality is something that deserves a salute.
Last but not the least, when offered tips to the service person, voluntarily from our side(as it has became a part of etiquette with time) the service person politely refused and informed us that its not permitted according to ethics. For the first time I came across some service persons who are not only super efficient in their service, but also honest and faithful to their commitments and duty. Staffs of other restaurants should learn something from them.
And yes, received a beautiful "Barbeque Nation" themed coffee mug as a token of love for the occasion which is an added delight.
Overall, I must say that, this restaurant is just OUTSTANDING and even a 5 rating is insufficient to rate this restaurant. Will visit again and again and should recommend all the foodies out there.
Long live "Barbeque Nation"!!! Just Rock on as many decades as you can!!!

It is probably one of the best buffet in the town. The buffet spread is quite elaborate. Two of us went there on 22nd December. We immediately got our seats. The manager and staff were really helpful and courteous.. The chef himself went around and asked everyone for feedback. The ambiance was pretty good. Some festival was going on, hence the place was nicely decorated.
Coming to the food, they provide a complimentary drink at the beginning. So, we ordered fresh lime soda.. There were 5 veg starters & 5 non-veg starters. The veg starters comprised of grilled veggies, mushrooms, paneer, corn and cajun potatoes. I really liked the corn and potatoes.. The non-veg starters comprised of prawn, chicken, fish, mutton seekh kebab and chicken tangri kebab.. All of them had distinct taste and were really good.. 
Next, we moved on to the main course, which was pretty ordinary. Although there were a lot of items in the menu but none of them were remarkable..
The dessert section had to be the best one.. It consisted of two kinds of pastries, firni, halwa, gulab jamun, etc. And of course, the kulfi. We tried the chocolate, malai and pan kulfi. I really liked the chocolate one..
The bill for two came to Rs. 1260 inclusive of all taxes, which is quite acceptable considering the quality of food and service.
I'm looking forward to another visit..

Easily one of the best places in Kolkata , both the park street and salt lake one are good . Price is also less than Bangalore , Delhi etc. Good ambience ,great variety and quality food makes it a great place for parties,hangouts and treats. Only drawback is due to only two branches in a big city like Kolkata some days you have to be in waitlist up to 1hour.

After almost 2 years I visited barbeque nation on 30th December and I was very pleased with the fact that the restaurant have gain so much popularity in this years but their services are still 5 star and I was delighted with the kind of service and quality of food I was served.
From the non veg starters to the main course to desert everything was excellent.
The best part was since it was my bday that day so they offered a cake which was exclusively for me. This small small things actually make a big difference in customer service.. I would request everyone to at least visit the place not just for food but also to get a world class service feel.. Happy hogging...

The staff is also very courteous and helpful. You can expect a good experience when you visit. The parking is an issue as they do not have their own parking.
P.S. i liked the chicken wings among all the starters and the chicken lucknowi biryani in the main course.

If its barbeque nation then it definitely has to be very good . No fault in any food item .They served chicken kebabs , mutton Seekh , prawn , Paneer , american corn , mushroom as starter.Prawn ,chicken and Paneer show stealers as these three were cooked till perfection.They do even serve conplimentary beer.We already had our stomach full because of the starters.The main course had a lot of items few were very good and some were ordinary and few i dint bother to taste.
They had a long list of desert items starting from kulfies , ice cream , gulab jamun.
The only flaw in service was they served the grilled prawn after long time of serving chicken.Many times we had to ask for the prawn starters.

Food - 5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Ambiance -5/5

Visited this popular restaurant quite a long time back and yes, if you haven't yet, you might be missing out on a great deal. Locating this place is very simple so lets not go to that detail.  Anyway, there was a long queue as always. After booking a table with our names they told us it would take us around an hour or so. Not minding that much we visited the nearby ccd to kill time. The person called up once they got an empty table. 
    Well, coming to the buffet menu.. it was totally delectable! Probably the best I had so far in Kolkata. Not loosing the essence of a true 'barbeque', they serve the starters on the table and with few peaces of burning charcoal beneath it, they ensure it is served warm. I love their flag system of signalling the waiters when you're done with the starters.
 After three rounds of kebabs, you will not feel like having much of the main course which has biriyani and a mutton preparation, however, we tried a little bit of them. This was followed by another sinful round of awesome desserts! 
Oh, and they serve a complementary beer or a non alcoholic drink that makes it all so very nice.
Service is prompt. They refuse any amount of tip.
Overall, its a must visit for Indian food lovers.

Well this is my one of my most favorite restaurants in Kolkata if not THE most favorite. I have visited this place (Sector V) at least 25 times and surprisingly each time I found their quality top notch. Be it the taste of food, be it the variety of food or be it the quantity of food. Their service is also very nice. I shouldn't spend much words on foods because I think everyone is aware of that. Just want to mention about their newly added Kulfi stall. It's a must try. My suggestion would be to concentrate on starters and desserts.
Cheers. Keep it up BBQ Nation.

Awsome food quality. If you want a place just to dig into unlimited fooding this is the actula place for you. I was first timer last sunday. Ambiance was near to excelency, waiters alltym look after there customer and is well trained. "Veg biriyani ne mari entry" was one of the tag line i noticed above veg biriyani which was quite good. The live kulfi counter and the live rosted chiken was also at its best. Planning o throw my birthday party at BBq... Keep rocking \m/

This is probably one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. The staff are courteous and always available, the furniture is comfortable, an unlimited supply of unbeatable starters, and necessities like charging ports readily available. The DIY grill was the best thing of course, with the dressings provided and the baby corn, chicken roast and kebabs- fish, chicken and prawn- awesome! One can literally eat starters till they drop (the flag of course) and the main course menu is mind blowing, from plain and fried rice, puris, other Indian recipes, to many chicken, gosht, recipes, etc. And perhaps the next best was the variety of desserts available- koolfi, triple-layered pudding, different flavours of ice-cream, etc., the best desserts I've ever had. Everything at an affordable cost.

Four of us went To Barbeque Nation last July i.e. 2015. The food was mouth-watering and came sizzling off the grill. The dishes made us feel absolutely amazing. We opted for Barbeque Skewers, on grill at the table. Mediterranean style Veg starter included Corn, and Mushroom. And the Non-Veg starter comprised of Prawn, Chicken, Fish, and Afghani style Mutton Seekh Kebab. Going for the non-veg main course we had Chicken Biriyani, and Mutton gravy. We ended our beautiful feast with hot Gulab jamun, Brownie, Firni, Mud-pie, Marble cake, Pudding, Ice-cream, and Kulfis in exactly the flavor you crave for- paan, chocolate, pistachio; served with faloodeh. And at last there were Fresh fruits too.

A perfect place to have your lunch and dinner at a time altogether as you won't be eating anything for the rest of the day. There won't be any space left on your stomach when you leave the restaurant. 99% of the items are perfect and the service of the brother waiters will leave u awestruck. A perfect place for everyone who loves to eat.

This is the best place in town if you are going for  buffet ( north Indian ) . This time the added attraction was the live counter with duck, turkey , mutton liver etc. The expansive list of starters , main course & desserts is well appreciated & illustrated in all the reviews & my humble advice for all foodies is - enjoy them all ( if you can ) as no one will bother you about the amount of time that you need to consume them. I am going to finish this review with an experience which makes this place truly fascinating. Today while having grilled prawn we complained that they were heavily burned . No sooner it was brought into the managers notice a chef from their kitchen came to us & apologized for it . They promptly removed the dish and brought new perfectly grilled prawns for us and waited till we had them and enquired whether we liked them or not. This time we had no complaints rather we wholeheartedly appreciated their promptness and eagerness to serve their customers.

Undoubtedly best buffet in town. Starters, main courses, desserts all are extremely tasty, mouth-watering and of best-quality. As starter, fish kebabs are extra-ordinary...For veg lovers you can try paneer kebabs that is equally tasteful...Among desserts, kulfi with different flavors in one counter just superbbb...

Their paan kulfi is one of the best customised kulfi ever had. Over and all best place for a complete buffet experience. Staff take care of you as your personal assistant. Had a conversation with head chef and he served some most delicious vegetarian food for us.

Food items out here are brilliant. The kebabs were brilliant , especially the chicken , fish , prawn and the pineapple one. Drinks we went for Don , Fresh Lime Soda Sweet.
Then later on went for Chicken Biryani , Chicken Curry , Kulfi , Brownie and many more items. At the end of the day we were totally full and exhausted had a tough time driving but it was worth it. Overall a great and marvellous experience.

Only one phrase to explain it ; this place is truly "FOODIES PARADISE"üòÉ
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Barbeque Nation name itself says it is a nation of barbeques..A spacious place with ever smiling courteous staff-this place greets you affectionately since you take the first step in..¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This restaurant pretty nicely understands what carnivores crave for. .
" Ma√°m, are you a regular here or is this your first visit?" A question asked by the person serving the sheeks of hot chicken ,prawn,fish straight out of the tandoor in the grill of our table...Not being a regular but I'd definitely love to visit BBQ Nation again¬† ...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Coming to food, BBQ Nation is definitely the place for a buffet dinner...Non veg items as starters that is bound to fill 1/2 of your appetite to main course meals i.e ...Biriyani, chicken items,fish, prawns (if u r done with kebabs)..Then came to the desserts...This outlet comes up with a KULFI LIVE COUNTER where one can find at least 5-8 different flavours of KULFI!!
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The concept of live grill kebabs which is very attractive and trendy..simple yet elegant d√©cor with very comfortable seats..üòÑ
1000 bucks per person was the cost but if u r a foodie and have some gr8 foodie friends then u must explore this place...üòÅ

Barbeque Nation seriously I have lots of xpectations from u..
But am little bit of disappointed.
This is d best restaurant as per Zoomato..
Now lets come to the foods.
They served complimentary drink. We ordered Fresh lime soda..that is nice. :)
Starters- Really their starters r the best in town. They serve perfect starters. Soft tasty fresh well cooked well marinated chickens fish prawns mutton etc.
I must say chicken and prawn kababs were realy awsome. Well cooked. Little spicy in taste. Ohk vetki kababs were okeish types. Paneer kababs were not up to the mark. Because paneer taste was flat.
Now mutton shikh kabab..It was good..well marinated mutton kabab.
They serve one Japanese stafed aloo. Verry tasty.
After that they serve tangri chickn.. that is not up to d mark. That was not tasty.
After completing our starters we actually dont have place to eat main couse seriously.
Main course- I really dont lyk their main course item.. chicken dum biryani was good well cooked but chicken gravy item was not well cooked. Chickens were not soft atall. Now comes to the mutton portion..really disappointed. Mutton was not good quality. I tried only one piece but that was disaster. Either muttons were not well cooked or that was not good quality or I can say that was not reaji mutton.
Ok they serve rui mach with shorshe. I didnt try that. Ok that is the end of main course..why man. Flame n grill serve biryani mutton chickn fish prawns in their main course.. and u guys have better rating in zoomato. salads are not too good. Norml typ..
Dessert- their was lots of desert items..fresh fruits were ok. Pastries mishti gulap jamun etc..but those are veryy misti..I didnt try properly. Paesh was not good..tooo sweet.
They have 6 types of kulfi..I tried pan kulfi and malai kulfi..good in taste.
At last they serve a chocolate pan..that was nice..
Overall a good experience.

ALL you need to know about BBQ NATION
There is nothing here that you won't like ..from the moment you enter one get's ready for the 10-12 starters ¬†getting barbecued...mashed potato is the best I feel..even if you are a vegetarian,there are different starters for both non-veg and veg foodie's...non veg starters include tandoori chicken,fish,prawn,mutton seekh...veg starters include paneer,veg barbecue,corn etc...after having that much starter there is little chance you have main course properly given the fact that one has to pass through the dessert section having 7-8 delicious dessert after main course...the best way is to eat comfortably....even main course has all types of salad,biryani,veg and non veg items..dont over-eat here....the best part is still left..after main course comes the dessert phase...phirni,gulab jamun,flavoured ice cream are fixed desserts..the rest are changed frequently..FOOD is undoubtedly good...TIME is not a hindrance here..you can sit comfortably and take your time and enjoy the complete experience.....AMBIENCE is good..they have live music in the evenings...they have themes like beach,pirate etc where the people who serve food are dressed like pirates or beach persons and dance to the theme song(for example Goan dance in case of beach theme)...the entire interior is designed according to theme....SERVICE is excellent..you dont have to say anything...food keeps on coming..your views about the food is also taken.....PRICE is variable ..there is an early bird offer every day for both lunch and dinner...there is a reduced price during weekdays as compared to weekends.....WAITING TIME depends on number of people accompanying you..for 2 there's always a table available...but it is better to go for advance reservation....

Ahh...my favourite place! Barbeque nation, the first to introduce the concept of live grill has set such high standards that if you visit any other grill buffet restaurant after dining here, you'll walk out with a feeling that it could've been better. Even for a vegetarian like me, they offer a wide range of starters (and the menu gets revised regularly so you don't bored either). The main course is also pretty good. Coming to desserts, I'm lost for words. Excellent is an understatement. The service is great and its on the expensive side but totally worth it!

Hmmm
Barbeque Nation for a group of vegetarians was more of how much you can eat and recover the fixed cost rather than how good your meal is. It's a gluttony of mindless quantity rather than of quality. The starters were good. The skewer experience is nice. But the main course and desserts were disappointing. Cheesecake was hard. Phirni wasn't flattering. The only saving grace were the starters. Not planning to go back any time soon.

We could not make any reservation before going, but  when I informed them that my brother was on wheelchair, they immediately reserved a table for us. They even helped my brother to move around and tried their best to make him comfortable. I have nothing to say about the food except they are awesome! My brother also got a complementary drink.. :-P Mom and Dad were so happy about everything ^_^

We had planned it for a month. And lo and behold, the day dawned and we entered the pleasure dome of miracles. I will be honest : as I'm from a middle-class family, I've never before attended any buffet, let alone eaten lunch from a restaurant as fancy as this one. But today, for the first time, I, swathed in the aromas of heavenly spices and sizzling meat and fish and whatnots, tried to keep my head straight as I slowly chewed the food and tried to take everything in : the texture, the softness, the taste, the surrounding of the interior, the muted and calming lights, the tinkling sounds, soft murmurs of polite waiters... After we had vanquished the starters (non-veg only, fresh from the live-grill embedded in the middle of our table), we explored the 'On the Buffet' territory. It was too much for us. After Biriyani as light as feathers, veg fried rice, a dish of chicken, soup, chicken salad, sweets whose names I don't remember, papads, cakes, gulab jamuns, ice-cream bathing in chocolate syrup (Hallelujah! That syrup though) and chocolate kulfi (from a 'live' kulfi bar), We could hardly move. Still, as we struggled to breath and looked at one another, we knew it was worth it. And so our quest ended.

Now about the food..i have been to barbeque nation of other cities. they have better starters than in sector 5 , kolkata. The food quality here is very good..spl the fish kebabs and the chicken wings. The deserts as usual are great at every barbeque. overall it is a good place to celebrate spl occasions.

Be it a father's day treat by lil bro,  or an anniversary celebration just the two of us, or................
 ( Aare khanewalo ko khane ka bahana chahiye, haina?  ;-) ).
In my knowledge,  no one can beat barbeque when it comes to an elaborate starter spread. You name it, and they have it. Each and every item tastes equally good.  So much so, that at one point the main course becomes really unnecessary. The food quality is excellent. Also a special mention of their desserts too, esp the pan kulfi topped with pan masala, is my favorite. A must try for everyone..

so much had been written and posted about this place so far.. after many visits we have some issues.. I loved this place since their inception at previous establishment in the bengal intelligent park.. it was much more grandeur out there.. they shifted to the current place.. the taste and servings of starters had reduced (it's always unlimited, mind it) or we had no luck those days we visited.. why the biryani is always with chicken? it should be with mutton any time.. we are asking for beef tenderloins in their menu too. why not when it's all about grilled meat? Dessert section where they are strong.. and main course too good at these days.. my ratings on the basis of cleanliness, quality and quantity and behaviour of their staffs towards guests..

Well what to say, one of the most famous restaurants for their Buffet menu is Barbeque Nation. Their starters are very good and they keep serving you until you put the flag down. Main course is not so good (as in most restaurants). Dessert again is very nice. Ambience is also good.

If you love eating this is the place to be,simply amazing. Right from food to ambience,hospitality to decor everything is unparalleled. Value for money and everything is amazingly tasty. Kebab's need no description and the dum biriyani is simply amazing. Deserts and starter are the best part in the entire meal. Do try out the pan kulfi.

Well well, at last I'm here writing for the review. This place has a kickass platter of starters. amazing and very distinct tastes. It is the idea of indefinite food that may be saying this, but this place kill all competition by a long margin in Kolkata. The main course is average and the desserts are again very good. I loved the prawn kebabs and the mutton variants especially in starters. A must visit place.

Hands down five stars !! The ambience was pretty good. The light music and birthday songs with complimentary cakes were great gestures. The staff was very friendly and we'll behaved. The service was top notch. This is when I haven't even started on the food.
This was my first time in a barbeque nation and I must say it is the best buffet I have had ever. I have not eaten so much of variety in a single meal, where every single dish was awesome. In a buffet we generally pick our favourite dishes and go on to repeat them. It was confusing aa everything we had tasted delicious. Chicken, fish, prawn, mutton every single dish was cooked to perfection.
Finally, the desserts. The variety and the quality and rate if every single variety blue our minds. Ice cream, phirni, shahi toast, gulab jamun, fruit tart, chocolate pastry, profit roll was all too good. And to add on to that, there was 6 different flavors of kulfi. I really savoured the paan kulfi. recommend every single foodie, especially those who love non vegetarian food and sweet dishes to visit this place at least once. You would not ask for a review before going again.

Thank you BN for the amazing experience.

Had tried the buffet here a few months back. The starters were very well prepared. There was a huge variety n all was served hot n fresh. Relished every bite of the kebab variety but didn't quite enjoy the dinner. We tried the veg menu only but it was quite average. The dessert variety was also quite good but the taste was average.

I heard a lot about this restaurant. Finally, went at the Salt Lake Sector V branch for a team party. Barbeque Nation serves unlimited buffet. The price of the buffet is very intelligently kept and varies at different times. We went there at 6.30 pm. We opted for non-veg buffet. The starters include, barbeque-skewers of mushroom, paneer, prawn, fish and chicken along with mutton seekh kabab, chicken drumstick, spicy baby potato, crispy corn chilli pepper. We could not try the main course as we had plenty of starters and cocktails. We did left some space for desserts. Lot of dessert options with ice cream and six different types of Kulfi. They also have some good combination of mocktails and cocktails. Though they serve unlimited buffet as I said but food quality is not great. It is average. The place is very nice and cosy and the concept is excellent. 

Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Value for money: 5/5
            

Revisited this place on September 30th. Had a poor experience with the food quality. It has gone down drastically. Barbecues were tasteless. They were serving some Vietnamese fish called Basa which was absolutely tasteless. The only thing that is worth mentioning is their collection of desserts which is still one of the best.

Barbeque Nation is not just a restaurant, it is an experience. This week, my Aunt from Mumbai was visiting Kolkata. So we took her to Barbeque Nation. It was also our first time. From the starters to the desserts, every piece of food felt like heaven. The best part was that they served complimentary drinks, including beer. The kebabs including fish, chicken, mutton and prawns were tender and juicy. The main course covered a wide range of food - biriyani, mutton roganjosh, chicken chaap, rice, fish curry, noodles, etc. The desserts were aplenty. Gulab jamun, kulfi, fruit salad, cheesecakes, ice cream with choco sauce sealed the deal. The service was prompt and polite. They even refused to take tips. Barbeque Nation is by far the best restaurant I have chanced upon in this town.

Well,Many foodies have already posted their reviews.Still I just felt like reviewing on my point of view.Being a hardcore non veggie their grilled fish and chicken items steal my heart away.kebas will just melt in your mouth.Prwan kebab is the best one.Buffets are also good with drinks what made them more popular.We had scotch whisky with starter and dinner buffet.The best thing is they have griller in every table to keep your kebabs warm and soft.This is the first time I have been there,and I just fall in love with their food and everything.Though this not budget friendly.They worth every penny.Best place for celebration.Planning to visit soon again.

We were a group of 11 people and we went for the buffet like most of the other foodies and we were not disappointed given that barbeque nation has a good reputation among the city's best diners. The starters and desserts are the best and top notch in this place. The main course was alrightish,I loved the bizzarely savory salads though. The Biriyani in main course is below average which is not expected from a diner of this strata. There's a Kulfi parlor that's awesome too. Overall the buffet at this place is pretty good and subsequently above average.

Beautiful food, wonderful experience and exceptionally courteous staff.

I have nothing but kind words to say about a place where I walked in without knowing much about this place but left with among the best experiences I've ever had in a restaurant. The service was excellent to say the least.

And the food was really good - granted that there were certain items that went well with my palate and some which didn't - but overall the variety was enough to be impressed by but not enough to be overwhelmed by. The starters were excellent as described by so many - particularly the prawns and this "cajun potato" or something they served which had a notably excellent taste. The main course was fine - their biriyani being a lot more edible than most out there - and they also had some decent salads. Their desert and kulfi counter perfectly topped off the meal (try the chocolate or strawberry kulfi - I insist).

Overall, this was a wonderful experience which I wouldn't mind repeating or recommending to another.

Barbecue Nation needs no introduction. I was here on a weekday for a grand team lunch. Again, I am a vegetarian. It was nice to see their standard cajun potatoes make an appearance. Most of the starters were pretty good, even the paneer was not something I rolled my eyes at. The sweet corn, mushrooms and bread pakoda-like thing were the highlights. I didn't care much for the pineapple or babycorn, both too salty. Main course was rightly restricted and was surprisingly interesting. The kofta dish, the paneer, the dum biryani, all decent fare. The bum note was the dessert course. While the addition of kulfi certainly helped, the other options were lacklustre, both in terms of variety and quality. They can and have done much better in the past.

My colleagues gorged on the non veg starters. They were thoroughly satisfied, in fact they raved about it. So extra points for that. Even at Rs.700 per meal, this is VFM.

Barbeque Nation is one of the best restraurant i visited so far in Kolkata. Me and my hubby both are foodies we keep on tasting diff restraurants of Kolkata. But Barbq Nation is the best of the Lot. The asset of Barbq Nation is their staff , they treatment is so special and homely. We have started off with Non veg starters and among them Prawn is the best. We didnt liked their mutton sheek kebabs and it tasted like nuggets so we said that too chef and they immediately served us with an alternate mutton preparation.Their main course is equally good . Main attraction is also their desserts and coolfi.

Barbeque Nation is the best and we would like to visit over and over again

The main course was also quite decent...

The best of its class and unlimited tangri kababs, chicken lasooni tikka, prawn and fish tikkas which were enjoyed with the complementary drink beer/ice tea. The maincourse had wonderful salads, biryani, muttin and chicken dishes. We were amazed with the number of sweet dishes which were really very delicious especially shahi tukda and kulfis Fine and luxury dining (10/10), ambience @classy and generous service (9/10), best in class food (11/10). Surely visiting again.

Nobody ain't read any review to visit this place. As the name already suggests its a place for barbeques. On visiting Barbeque Nations during the pujas this year, I was overwhelmed. A bengali food festival had been organized especially for puja purposes.
Let's start from the beginning.
The kababs. Chicken. Paneer. Mushroom. Mutton. Basa fish. Prawn. Please try all. Prawn one especially, because you don't get it in most other places.
The in-between taste changers- a potato mash with mayo and fried corn roasted with spices. I would recommend you to have these and not refuse, if you want to eat more stuff.
The complementary drinks were brilliant, though you should have then as slowly as possible to continue eating heartily.
The main course, though extremely well made was mostly not touched because we were full already. However, the lemon chicken soup after heavy dose of kebabs acted as life savers.
We had bhaba ilish,mutton, chicken, holud pulav, ghee bhat, sukto with sorshey- a full on bengaliyana meal. And obviously the different salads.
And never take the desserts casually. Be it the kulfi section or the pineapple cake lined with freshly cut apples, the gulab jamun, icecream,sandesh or chanar payesh(a special dish made for the pujo purpose)

The trick to these places is to visit them taking ample time. We had entered the place at 11:30am around and left by 3pm. The staff is extremely well behaved and there service is heartwhelming. Even in such busy schedule of the pujas they catered to every need particularly. The place is actually with its price. And after such a heavy meal, laze around the RDB cinemas and watch a good movie.

A worthy entry to anyone's food trail. Good job. üëç

I take a 0.5 out for the bad behavior during their pujo booking over phone. Sorry, but it will not be tolerated.

As the name suggests . Its all barbecue all  the way.
The buffet is worth it. The starters are the best part of the meal and are real treat to the tastebuds. The starters are so good that  most of the customers don't have any space left for main course. The main course section could be improved . But moving on to the desserts section. It covers a wide range of both western and traditional sweets and does a decent job there.
Overall, the restaurant is a must visit for food lovers . Specially people who like dining in style.

Its almost impossible to explain the experience of Barbeque Nation. It is so far my best food experience in Kolkata.¬†
Though this place is costly, but still I would call it a value for money. We went here on a weekday evening. And I was surprised to know that as we reached before 7:30 pm, we had to pay much less (730 per head).
To start with, the service is very good. The decor doesn't really make you feel like you are sitting in the middle of a crowded Kolkata. With some elegant soft Western Classics or Bryan Adams in the background(played by an unknown, yet very talented singer), the food will take your experience to a whole new level.
The starters are amazing. Each one of them. I loved the Prawn starter, the most.

What distinguishes BBQ Nation buffet from the other places is that, they have an equally good Main Course and an even better Desert.
The brownie and the Kulfi are such delicacies.

If you are a foodie, then BBQ Nation is a must visit...

Barbeque Nation is famous for its kebabs, and with good reason.

To understand what I felt about this place, you have to experience it first.
The buffet hosts a variety of kebabs, ranging from chicken to prawn to mutton and more.
Its not the variety which is exciting, but the amazing flavours, perfectly cooked, soft, tender and what not.

The rest of the buffet is pretty good too, the biriyani was excellent as was the mutton. There was a variety of deserts and other items which I didnt try as I was too full on kebabs alone.

The service is good, the ambiance is a bit lacking however.

Would definitely visit again, and recommend to anyone looking for a great kebab trip.

You already know about this place a lot, so u do not basically have to depend upon my review to have a go to this amazing place. me, with three of my friends visited this place today, at the day of kalipujo at 2-30 pm. we did prior booking 6 days ago via a phone call. staffs are very co-operative and helpful. ambiance is very good, especially if you are a Enrique Iglesias fan. they all the time played his hits.¬†
Coming to the food, we had 731 non veg week days lunch package( though some of my friends tasted some paneers also) :P. From starter to dessert, only one word. outstanding. But we thought that the prawn kebab could be better and there could be some more items in the main course. dessert is 10 out of 10. they also give us option of complimentary drinks. we orderd beer and that was not at the par with the other items. there was no problem in booking and they waited till our eating is over, ie, around 4:30 pm( actually the lunch batch ends at 3:30 pm).
some special mentions, though everything is delicious.
starter: chicken kebab
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† chicken wings

main course: biryani
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†mutton ghosth
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†mexican chicken soup
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†all the salads
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†fish curry
¬†
dessert: chocolate sondesh
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†black forest
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† gulab jamun
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†firni

This is no doubt one of the best restaurants in the city and certainly the best one in buffet category. Go for it if you haven't yet.

Barbecue Nation is best in Kolkata for kebab. You start with starter and finish with desert with kulfi as a special addition. If you are a non-veggie and still want to try some of the veg kebabs, the mouth watering aroma and satisfaction of your taste bud will give you ample pleasure to try any of it specially mixed fruit one. Excellent ambience and wonder serving is going to give you another reason to visit this place all over again. The downside is, you may not like high pitch live performance.

This place has the best Buffet. Honestly you cannot have anything better than this. I have lost count of the number of times I have been here and still can't get over it. I think the Starters and the deserts and now the Kulfi section, its top class. Also the ambience is good and matches the excellent quality of food served

Barbecue Nation itself is a brand &  needs no review. Went there on 31st Oct, I was impressed by their hospitality.  Opted for non-veg dinner buffet.  Got the table instantly. 
Starters specialty sea foods are excellent. I found starters are better that main courses. 
Desserts were awesome. Try their various types of kulfis.

This is the best place to eat! Spend 2hrs so you can enjoy everything that's on offer. 
Love the starters. Pan kulfi is yum. Mains can be skipped and there's not much really. But one is so happy with rest that this is  happily forgiven! 
 Only downside is that the menu is more or less similar everytime so you don't want to frequent the place at short intervals.

This is the first time i went to this place as i had heard a great deal about this place but never had the chance as its quite far from my place. But i should say, what an experience it is. The food is just awesome and the best part is the food is very light and thus you can actually forget and eat all you can. The menu of the dinner buffet is very simple yet quite elaborate. The service of the persons in charge is also very nice, quite a rare thing that experience nowadays. Felt very much ease due the excellent service, kudos for that. Now the best part that i loved is the live music sung by two persona and it completely shifted the ambience to a different level. A very very nice experience and will definitely visit very soon. Keep up the good work guys!!!

Barbaque Nation.. grand daddy of all buffets in kolkata.Heavenly place for all kebab and non veg lovers.Though I have sampled some of their veg fare and found it good.Love the sweet corn they give so juicy crunchy and yummy.Kebabs are supremely flavorful. Have always been too filled up with kebabs to properly try their main course.They have a great collection of desserts and now they have started kulfi counter too.Delightful . Ambience and hospitality also deserve a special mention. Servers are extremely polite and helpful.

Untill recently this was the only barbeque nation outlet in kolkata before they came up with another one in Park Street. This place is very conveniently located for people staying in salt lake and north kolkata. However its pretty crowded place with a very small area and if u r looking to sped some quality quite time with your partner over lunch or dinner then this is definitely NOT the place to go for. But if u r group of guys looking to eat to ur hearts fullest and shout out loud without someone bothering u then this is ur place. 
One imp thing they dont mention is that if u r coming in for lunch by 12 and for dinner before 8 then u get a straight Rs. 100 discount per head on the buffet rate. 
If u have a bottomless pit in your tummy and is kebab hungry then hit the place. 
However i have a small note for the management- For your regular customers the menu now seems all the same everytime we visit. There is not a aingle variation in the main course neither in the grill. Please try to bring in variation every week and notify your customers through smses at least. Provide some good offers for regulars as on weekends your prices tough sky high and is completely not justified.

I don't know but cant give it full marks for its food. I will deduct a mark since I found the starters to be teekha or spicy that day. I dont think its lyk d same every day but other than this no complains. Food is good, place is good,ambience and live music that day was superb. We get live music in very few places at kolkata. The dessert brought a wide smile on my face and it ended in a good tune.

Coming to the Food awesome Barbecues,in starter. Again the Main course is always a 10 out of 10 with some new things in the buffet.Deserts are always a fav & the coolfi bar is also a must try.
Service is also great very friendly waiters.the only thing that could be change is the waiting time before we hit the deck for a full charge on the foods.but then again we can wait for a good treat.So over all a 5 out of 5 thumbs up.

This place is cool, with good ambiance, and service.
But look at it's terrorizing food. The starters were good, but the mains was like " O hOrror ! O HOrror ! O horror ! O Terror ! O Terror ! O Terror !!" I was so disgusted, the mains were absolute shit.
One of the waiters argued with us, misbehaved with us., In hospitality... this shouldn't be the scene.

We came here for a week day buffet lunch.First let me clear one thing..if u r lucky enough to get a table  within 12:00-12:30...it will cost u Rs 630 and after 12:30 it will cost Rs 730. Now coming to food...I was amazed by their continuos serving of starters. There are 10 types of starter: 5 from veg and 5 from non veg. All are fabulous in taste and the staffs will go on serving u until u put your flag down. In main course also they provide a variety of items starting from soup to biriyani,fish noodles,chicken, and mutton preparation and many more. But I didn't find the main course as delicious as the starters specially the biriyani. I expected a lot better biriyani from barbeque nation. Any way after main course you should keep space in your appetite for their desserts. They provide a variety of desserts from firni to golapjamun, pastries and fresh fruits and finally 5 different types of coolfies.

At least I can assure you..you will not regret coming here..I really wished to give it a 5 star but cant because of the main course. I hope they will try to make the main course delicious in future

An awesome experience. Really a great buffet.

‚òÖ LOCATION : (3.5/5) It is located beside RDB. Sector 5

‚òÖ AMBIANCE :(3.5/5) Decoration is nice and moderate sitting arrangement.

‚òÖ FOOD :(4.5 /5)¬†
Starters: Sweet corn fry, pineapple grill, musroom, paneer tikka in veg.¬†
In non veg.. there were chicken mutton and fish. and a tangri kabab.¬†
but the fish tikka is the best. also there were prawn. 

there were 3 types of sauce and 3 marinations.

Main course: many items... veg and non veg. also many soups and salad. I only tasted biriyani, chicken balti, and sikari mutton.¬†
main courses are not liked by me as i was full with starters

Desert:  a huge collection. vanila ice cream with chocolate sauce., kulfi, few cakes, gulab jamun(hot), phirni. also fruits like watermelon. myself ddnt like the phirni. but all others are good. it would be better if there were atleast 4 choice of ice creams like vanila strawberry chocolate mango etc.

‚òÖ PRICES :(4/5)  The prices are moderate. It was happy hour ¬†:) Only 630 per person¬†

‚òÖ SERVICE : (4/5) 
¬†Staffs are really very helpful. ¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† But if the main course taste will become better... then the rating should be 5 on 5

Overall the experience was greattttttt....................

The Early Bird discount is a kill. You cannot get a better buffet spread for this low a price (Rs. 650 A.I). 

Hospitality - 5/5
Food - 4/5
Cleanliness - 4/5
Innovativeness - 4/5
Variety - 4/5

I loved how the grill was incorporated into the table itself. One advise would be if the waiters could slow down on the serving of starters. Loved the concept of a live kulfi counter but it was the only item which kind of failed to satisfy our taste buds, except the mango kulfi which was really great. 

Great work, people. A must visit if you want to challenge your appetite. Keep up the good work, Barbeque Nation. Would definitely visit again!

This is the best buffet in the city.. Visited this for the third time. To be honest,one has to work really hard to find a flaw with this place. The unlimited kebabs are outstanding,each one bettering the other. Coming to the main course we just tried the chicken and the mutton preapartion. The desserts are sumptuous. The best feeling was celebrating 6th anniversary of BBQ nation. They offered a cute strawberry cheese cake and it was delicious.  Excellent flavour mixed with a cozy ambience & professional service gibes a great feeling.

Surely the best buffet in town. Great food and great service make this our favourite destination to go back to, over and over again, for every occasion. My last visit to this place was on Nabami afternoon for lunch.

FOOD-
Starters and desserts were awesome as usual, in terms of variety, quality, taste and presentation.
But, what pleasantly surprised us was a sumptuous spread of many authentic bengali dishes in the main course. It included ghee bhat, veg pulao, shukto, fulkopir kalia, begun basanti, potoler dolma, dhokar dalna, sorshe ilish, chingrir malaikari, chicken dakbanglo, mutton. Everything except potoler dolma tasted great ( sorshe ilish and shukto require special mentions). The buffet also comprised of other regular items like mutton biriyani, dal makhani, paneer, nun/roti and more.

SERVICE-
Service was prompt and warm. Even in the rush of Pujo, everything was as organised as ever. They didnt even miss to ask why we did not try the kulfi ( the obviously reason being our tummy was too full with yummy things by that time).

Amazing place that has a feel-good factor attached with it. Nothing complements 'great food' like 'a lot of warmth'! Keep it up guys!

P.S: Next day I got a call from their Head office, asking for a feedback of my experience. Really love their dedication towards serving better.

In this Durga puja time they served some authentic bengali food like CHINGRI MACHER MALAICURRY,VAPA SORSE ILISH,CHICKEN DAAKBANGLA etc.. these are my favorites this time. kebas r always awesome.. this time they served some other new desserts like rosogolla,chhanar payes etc.. this is also for durga puja.. these desserts are also very nice.. specially the chhanar payes... but Rosogolla was a bit hard..but this can be ignored after all of the yummy mouth watering food... :-)

Variety of starters from paneer tikka to guava kebabs to God knows what kebabs üòù the main course is also nice... But... My favourite meal of The day is desserts... So many types of sweets..from gulab jamun to baked rosogollas and chocolate mouse to jalebi. Yum yum yum.

The best one can have in town for sure. They serve 6-7 starters which includes chicken kebabs, mutton boti kababs and prawn kababs!!! They have such good varieties in Main Course as well from Hilsa Elish, Mutton Curry, Prawn Malaicurry and many more. They also have a live kulfi counter!! Price was higher though. For one person during durga pujas they charged 1100 bucks for Lunch Buffet.

Alright I am about to write a review on city's most admiring and adorable restaurant. I was waited for a very long time to go to barbeque Nation. Now where to start, 

1) Service - Extraordinary from start to end. There is always someone to wait us in such a crowdy situation. 
2) Food - The most important thing and I seriously don't have proper words to describe myself. 

Barbeque Nation you people have made my day. Can't wait to see you again. Gracious and ciao.

I was in little bit of dilemma whether to write a review on my today's visit to BN, Saltlake or not. What happened is today a shame for a foodie like me. I don't like to review a visit without cherishing full of my memories in every aspect it offers. That is the reason I usually write little long reviews. Few a times I surrendered the buffet lunch/dinner due to over eating but keeping some reservation for eateries like this one. And finally the occasion arrived. On the holy occasion of Bijoyadashami, to avoid crowd of park street, took a long drive to RDB, Boulevard, Saltlake. But I was wrong enough to wait for long 90 minutes to get a table of 5 at 3:30pm! Yes it was a lunch! Anyways, during this month of festivity, Barbeque Nation has been transformed into Bengali Nation with full of Bengali delicacies. Shame on me, I was tilted with starter & could not even touch a single item of main course full of our very own menu of hilsa, chicken, mutton, prawn, ghee bhaat etc.  etc. Desserts were ok, but not extraordinary as I have checked better options somewhere else. But must mention about kulfi counter with five flavours to lure your taste buds. Starters were exceptionally good, even fried sweet corn will bold you out! Be it chilli ginger prawn or fish or mutton, all starters will mesmerise every foodie. I wish I could have biggest belly in the world! I can't wait for my next visit to happen soon! Now the most important thing is their service. In such a huge mob, hundreds of people they were serving since 12:00pm, not a single point of deviation on their attentiveness. This is the greatness of BN. Have fun!

Last Durga puja I went there and I had to pay 1100 per person... but I can challenge you if you are a foodie and you enjoy food love eating... then it is the perfect place to be... the starters were outstanding from panner to mutton... the main course a rasgulla ka sabji... which was one of a kind... the main course had hilsa and it was superb... I entered the place a 12:30 and exited the place at around 5 p.m.   so of you can eat... these is the best buffet you can have and is worth the money you pay...

One who thinks of a buffet and doesn't know which place...close your eyes and step into the best served buffet in the country. They serve some total 30-40 items including starters and main course and you cannot find flaw in the taste of any of them be it your first visit or any number.I have myself been to this place for some 12-13 times and every time the quality has remained intact!! The no of options they have for the vegetarians is also appreciated!!No doubt they continue to be on of the top rated buffet restaurants!!

I frequent this place with friends. The staff here is extremely courteous and friendly. The food quality has consistently remained very good over time. They have a widespread menu with multiple starters and extensive desserts and main course menu.
The only issue is that after a few visits, one wishes to see some variety, some novelty especially in the main course menu.¬†¬†
Finally, do make sure that you are ravenous before you get here because there's soooo much to try, taste and stuff!!

Hmm..there is no word to describe Barbeque Nation..

Especially the hot gulab jamuns.. also liked the kulfi.. Employee behaviour was very good..

I don't want to bore you with the review for this restaurant.. This is just outstanding .. You can visit any time in the year..

Still I want to quote one unique experience what I had there . a dish panner tikka was served to us . we did not liked the taste of it .. Believe me they kept on changing the texutre, flavor and marination stuff for cottage cheese for 5 times until we said that now it's fine. I have never seen so much of dedication towards the customer.

My favorite kulfi .. Don't leave the place until u taste it ..

So who hasn't heard of Barbecue Nation, the place where you can eat unlimited kebabs till you cannot stuff your face anymore? I did. And therefore, being the foodie I am, wanted to visit the place badly. On 13th I visited the restaurant (we reached quite early, you know, to avail the early bird discount, which is kinda cool). And honestly, after trying almost everything - starting from the assorted kebabs to the main course, I was disappointed. Especially with the kebab section of which I've heard so much from my friends. What they did was because of the enormous rush that day, one batch of kebabs was properly cooked and the other wasn't and vice versa. The mushroom kebab tasted good, at least the first batch was. The second batch was chewy and undercooked. The chicken was overall great tasting, the only kebab I loved there. The fish kebab was terrible. Undercooking food stuff is one thing, but having some fluid ooze out of it? Not cool. The prawns were burnt. One batch was, anyway. By that time, we had lost our appetite. Hearing so much about a place and then being let down to this degree, one just had to.
The main course was slightly better. But well, the cake. The cake could easily have been from some local cake shop, didn't taste something out of the world. I'm not saying it wasn't fine, just not great. And also, the ice cream. Same thing.
The best thing there was the pan kulfi. It was just mind blowing. But yeah, if you're going to the famed Barbecue Nation, you're going there not just for one amazing paan kulfi and two awesome chicken kebabs. It's the full package that's appealing.
Maybe it was a bad day or something, because a place like that cannot be defined by one day. Maybe the next time I visit, I hope I'll be ecstatic enough to give a 5 star review.
But this first visit really disappointed me.
The hospitality was great, I have nothing against that. But what do you do with great hospitality when the food on the plate tastes terrible?

No better option for buffet other than barbeque nation. Lovely music and ambience. Lots of mouth watering starters. I stopped having its main course every time I go here now and settle with its starters and desserts. The stuff is best I have ever seen anywhere. They really like to feed their customers. The chef too take care at times.

This franchise never fails to disappoint, be in the city. This was probably my tenth Barbeque Nation visit in a fifth city. Let's go into the details:-
1. Food - Amazing is the word. Fish tikka was the best item on the grill. Grilled pineapple is an all time favourite. Other notable snacks: fried corn, soya, paneer tikka, potatoes etc. Chicken tikka could be modified and made into something more interesting for the palette. M.Ali Street Festival counter is a good initiative but beware - the dishes could be a bit too heavy. As far as main course is concernee, biryani was the hands down winner. Nihari Gosht had an amazing curry.
Okay now the main part - 'Deserts' !! That's undoubtedly the best thing about this outlet. Malpuya with Rabri ranks top on my list. Sheer Qurma deserves a special mention as well. Then comes the Paan Kulfi. The Kulfi counter is an awesome addition to the place. I wish they include baked rossogullas on the platter.
2. Service - Prompt and warm.
3. Ambience - again a well maintained standard across all their outlets. I felt this one is a bit crammed though. I luckily got a chance to listen to two wonderfully talented musicians playing live there.
4. Money - you know what you are paying for even before entering the place. Not more, not less.
5. Intra City Comparison - although its park Street counterpart is a bit more spacious, but somehow it felt better to go to the Salt Lake outlet.

We have been there for our office party...the ambience is too good and staffs are very professionals.
Location is also too good and they have arranged a valet parking in the most crowded place in sec v.
I am not impressed with the quality of starter Tey have served we all basically sense a chemical flavour on top of the starter and cause a loss of appetite. Main course is also not upto the mark but desert is superb.
My rating is 3 is only for quality deserts.

The best part of the place is its starters. .I luv them all (so what if I cant have the prawn..the rest are yummy too, yes even the veg ones)
I heard they have opened one in park st so am waiting to check in there as well.

If you call yourself a foodie then visiting this restaurant is a must if u haven't been here as yet. Its located in the prime area of Sector 5 next to RDB cinema with valet parking available. Never seen this place going empty, have had to wait a few minutes most of the time even with prior reservation. My suggestion would be to go with a completely empty stomach and eat till you drop dead!
Very good ambiance and well spaced out seating arrangement doesn't make this place look cramped up even on over crowded days.
However, over the last few years, they have not changed their barbeque/grill menu. The same kebabs are being repeated with some add-ons here and there on some days which can get monotonous after a few visits. The main course is changed frequently, but after dining heavily on its grill menu we have skipped their main course most of the days. The dessert spread here is brilliant. Once we had tasted watermelon here which was simply out of the world!
Now after numerous visits to this place, we mostly visit during their food festivals. I would highly recommend a visit during their sea food and African food festival. Its sometimes good to try dishes we have never heard of before. Shark and lobster during one such festival was surely a hit for us :)

The starters are awesome and so are the desserts. The main course is also better than most other buffet restaurants but after the binge on starters, main course is not even required. They do not take a single penny in tips as the service charge is included. Overall an amazing place

One doesn't need to read a review to visit this place but a good review would do justice to this awesome place. Getting place is an issue but book a week before and then you can enjoy some yummy food. The decor is good and the hospitality is excellent. Now coming to the food it was simply fresh and delicious. Every item on the menu was well cooked and tasted too good. I especially loved their fish- fresh and flavourful. The main course was great too. But alike the starters the dessert was also another big surprise.. New desserts and unlike many places they served malpua with rabdi instead of gulab jamun.. Even the kulfis were unique. I loved the sitafal flavoured most... overall a great experience and value for money...

I have become quite a regularite to this place since my office being in omega tower. It does not require much praise since it is a hot favourite of office goers around sector 5.
Huge options in starters which generally ends up with me skipping the main course and go straight to desserts. But one should try the main course as well. Their Biryani is very good. But what keeps me dragging to this joint is dessert. One'll  definitely get sweet tooth after trying all these. One more thing that is worth mentioning is their special Kulfi counter. Paan kulfi and strawberry/choco chip kulfi are worth trying.
Staff and even chefs are very welcoming and responsive to feedbacks. Great one in overall.

Had Some Buffets before.But was awaiting for this grand retreat..especially the kebabs..and the journey Started with The Chicken Rashmi one's..and It took a blink of a moment to get lost into my taste buds.Chicken Grilled Kebabs followed just to make the adventure more deeper..Chicken Tangri and Grilled Prawns were there to add deliciousness on top of that.Not to foget The Service was awesome. But at the Same time The Mutton Seekh Kebabs were a big let down.
Having Stuffed myself with Kebabs I moved on to the main course..The Achari Paneer was good..though the Mutton Kasha consisted of undercooked muttons which forced me to move on to Deserts.I wasn't complaining though as I had already stuffed myself with Kebabs.
Now came the Desert Part..So nice were the Deserts that they brought my appetite back.The Chocolate Brownie,The Gulab Jamun,Lemon Cake..all were equally good.On the last bunch served different flavoured kulfis   which added perfect last touches to "The Sumptuous Lunch"..:)
I would strongly recommend these to people who love to have a lunch with a "Grilled" touch.

1831 reviews already says it all.. There is just so little to say because when I just think of it my mouth starts watering.. Their buffet is like heaven for meat lovers.. Just how much awesome starters can you stomach and still leave some space for the main course and then wide range of desserts.. It might so happen that people get carried away by the starters itself.. So go there as hungry as possible and pounce on the food... Or not. Coz the food won't run away.. Take your own sweet time to enjoy each and every item. :)

NO ONE CAN BEAT THEIR "STARTERS",NO ONE....! And its very hard to have main course their because you will be loving their starter so much and you will busy eating starters so much that you will not try main course because you will already be full, and what's left will be filled up by desserts. Superb place to be after office.

This 'go-kill-ur-hunger-and-fill-ur-mind' place must be visited by every foodie, especially if you love variety of veg & non-veg kebabs. The main attraction here is the 'table grill' provided on every table and the skewers served as per your choice till you keep the flag down :)  Though the main course spread is good, kebabs and desserts are the main attraction.
They serve drinks as well and one can have it with the starters served in the buffet.
Ambience is good except for the cramped layout of seating.
This place is value for money!
Minus 0.5 for the seating layout and the main course.

Desert options are lovely,  specially the kulfi with falooda..  however two things I'd like to point out,  that the seating arrangements could be made a bit more comfortable...  And also please add some more options to the beer available as welcome drink..  I mean kingfisher only...  Not very attractive.

It was my first time at a Barbeque Nation outlet. Had gone there for an invitation, It was truly an awesome experience, the starters were just awesome and I had so much, that couldn't taste much of the main course. The dessert was equally delicious.

Simply Superb.

Food was really of the top quality.
Kebabs were very well cooked and the fish mustard was the one i loved the most.

Main course is well spread but the same old menu makes it a bit boring.

Desserts were delicious . The addition of the kulfi counter is the best ...different flavours lovely presentation.. 

Worth mentioning was the behaviour and courtesy of the staffs...they were late in serving the starters but they made up for that with complimentary mocktails.

All in all they do justice to the price they charge.

Definitely one must try this place out.

In all honesty, this is the best buffet place in KOLKATA. But compared to its branches in PUNE and Bangalore this one lacks abit. The starters and desserts are amazing while main course is comparatively okay. My advise is gulp down on starters and desserts. Keep the main course intake to minimal

I have visited this place quite a few times and this place never fails to satisfy my appetite. The tender kebabs they serve are my all time favourite.

If you are hanging out with a group of foodie then Barbeque Nation must the the desired destination.

Yesterday when we visited this place The Mohammed Ali Road Mumbai festival was on.

Although the standard of food served in Barbeque Nation is quite awesome, but yesterday I found the Starters of the Mohammed Ali Road festival quite disappointing.

The main item of this festival was Grilled Cuckoo bird, Mutton Kalejo etc.

No complaints regarding the deserts, they were delicious as always.

Dis is one such place where i alwz prefr to go whether itz wid my family or friend this is one of the cheapest buffet of the town and is probably famous for their kebabs.... Moreover their hospitality towards their customers are too humble n polite .....
But the reason im giving them 4 because i didint lyk their main course specially i personally feel they need to give some varieties to it,second the taste of the biryani is not at al gud and needs improvemnt

In the middle of sector V, it's probably the most in demand restaurant in this area. Pros are its location, the kebabs, and the staff really don't hurry you unless it's closing time.

However, over the last few years, they have not changed their buffet menu. The same kebabs are being repeated, and after you visit it couple of times, you might get the feeling, oh its the same thing again! The main course is changed frequently, but hardly anyone goes there for the main course.

It's a great restaurant, nice staff,food and dessert is great, but they should start innovating their menu pretty soon.

Barbeque Nation is an epitome of good service clubbed with awesome kebabs, good main course, above average music and ambience.. The staff is so welcoming.. Any request for any started item is always respected and the chef takes special efforts to make it as per your expectation. I'm a vegetarian and have hardly come across any restaurant with a larger menu @specially in starters/kebabs. Kudos to all @ barbeque nation

The price is a little high, but it's worth it!!üòäüòä Although yes, make sure you go for lunch and miss your breakfast as there are way too many varieties all of which are great!! You'll probably find yourself full and not able to stuff any more food and see that there's still a LOT left to eat. Ofcourse, the kababs are the best!!üòçüòç

The Barbeque Nation was actually a birthday treat thrown by a friend. We mainly went for the Grilled Starters where we had Sweet corn, Chicken, Lobster, Fish and Chicken drumstick. And then after having full tummies we straight away went for the Desserts. We had no place in store for Maincourse. However, I liked it as it is the first time I specifically went for grilled food. The layout was okay but the service provided by the waiters was fast and good. However, in the beginning we had to wait for nearly an hour to get a table as the rush was huge and all tables are filled. Get the outlets more spacious for more customer seating !!

The kebebs are good. I have been to this eatery on my birthday. There was a huge crowd, we had to wait for an hour to get a table. But once settled we treated ourselves with a platter on never ending kebebs. I liked the mutton kebabs of all. We were too full to go through the main course. The dessert was equally good.

Well, where do I begin!
This place is one of my favourites if not The favourite..¬†
I'll start with the food.. obviously..¬†
This is an excellent place for non-veg starters.. Actually 'excellent' is just understating it.. It is amazing man, just too good.. Even now while writing this review "mere muh mein paani aa gaya hai sirf soch k hi".. Starters man!! Moving on... The main course is good.. 'Good' because after the starters the expectation level is just too damn high.. And finally the awesome desserts...¬†
Apart from the brilliant quality of the food, another thing that is note worthy is the behaviour of the staff.. Polite,¬†courteous and always ready to answer your queries..They never get irritated no matter how many times you ask them the same question..
Another amazing thing is that the staff will ask your opinion about the food in general and the starters in particular.. and if you are not happy with some recipe in particular they will prepare it with a different combination of masalas and other things(I'll leave the technicalitis to the experts which is definately not me) ¬†and serve it to you again..
I'll recommend this place to everyone.. Everyone.. Just go there and enjoy!! Cheers :)

NICE : I went to celebrate my friends birthday at this place and it turned out to be quite a good one. Prior bookings resulted in easy sitting with no stand-in-queue drama. The atmosphere was very good despite being a packed day with low noises. The starters here though are amongst the best that I've ever experinced. They give u hardly any chance to keep your (forget plates) table empty as there is always something or the other coming your way, be it prawn, chicken, fish and what not. We were so stuffed that we had to rest for half an hour to start our main course. The only thing i felt was not at par was the main course food as it some how failed to meet the expectation of my taste bud. I feel it wasn't upto the mark compared to the starters but still i loved it and but recommend to visit this place. Waiting for my second coming too.

The service here is excellent. The staff is very courteous, and the food is delicious. Lots of variety. The starters are really good.

If you are a foodie you must visit this place. Awesome starters, Kebabs and desserts . Service is just excellent. 

Once I was there while the Roadside food festival was going on and I didn't like the biryani as it was very spicy . By knowing that .. The chef made some less spicy biryani and brought it to me. Yes . They do care about their customers and very much concerned about "customer satisfaction". I love this place .

Barbeque Nation.. I had first visited this chain of restaurant in Pune. The outlet in Sector V had always been in my wish list. Finally i got an opportunity to visit this place on my Birthday. A dream come true place for a foodie like me. This place does not take telephonic reservations so I was sceptical of getting a place without having to wait a lot. But I was lucky enough. Quite spacious. Hustle bustle everywhere. The staff was very courteous and helped us find a seat. Coming to the food, the onthegrill starters started to pour in. We had Paneer tikka, aloo, mushrooms, Lebanese vegetables, n pineapple. Aloo tikka was very delicious n well prepared. Mushrooms were soft and tender. Pineapple was the surprise package. Did not believe it could be so tasty. The Lebanese vegetables were a bit off as they did not hit the taste buds perfectly. Along with on the grill, there were other starters which were served on our plates. American Corn was superb. Amazingly orepared, and had a good crunch. So was Potato in Cashew Sauce.. The starters were the hero. I was so full by the time I reached the main course, that I had to settle only for biryani. The aroma of Biryani was fantastic. You don't find good veg biryani in Kolkata easily. This is one such place which provides good biryani.
Deserts....!!!! A very good spread !!
6 types of kulfi, which were then topped up with different dressings. Each equally tasty.
Hot gulab Jamun was yumm.. It melted in my mouth. And it was a pleasure to have the gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream. One should have it together to get the feel.

In all, I would like to say it was worth the money spent. And I would come back soon to have a delicious meal again.

A very happy satisfied customer.

I visited this restaurant for the first time long back and found it amazing. The starters were delicious, too many varieties to choose from, and unlimited so I could it all the items I felt without missing on the ones that I don't eat. The main course was good, nothing out of the ordinary, though, and the desserts are nice as well. The vegetarian plate is not really as good as the non vegetarian one though. 
The second time I visited, it was the same experience and I loved it again. The third time I visited, it was the same experience all over again, and that is where the problem lies. 
There is no variety, a couple of times is fine, but any more and you start feeling repetitive.
The menu items' names change but they are essentially the same. Would love to visit again if there was a change.

Hav visited many buffets n restaurants in Kolkata and Certainly BBN has the BEST food nd hospitality among all. They make u feel special from entering to getting out wid deir food n good behavior. Each n every starter compliments d following one. We tried both veg n non-veg starters. Their sweet corn was something unusual. It was fried corn. Potato had some mixed cream with it which was quite tasty. Dere was d Thai festival going on when we visited so we got to taste some tasty Thai food also. Main course was also very impressive. For dessert...mousse, cheese cake didn't seem me anything special but were good obviously. Minigulabjamuns r an attraction of dessert court.

It was the occasion of our 5th Marriage Anniversary, we visited Barbeque Nation with a great expectation reading the awesome reviews(?!). We had a reservation for 27th June as we didn't want to wait for a long time. To be honest I am much disappointed with the quality of food they served. The starters were over cooked and in some cases Prawns were even burnt!! The taste of the main course was also not upto the mark/ as per our expectations. The plus point as I must mention were the deserts. The deserts they serve were awesome.
Finally, I must say that Barbeque Nation is over hyped as it is reflected from the reviews. I have clearly mentioned my disappointment in the feedback card also.

I just wish that they change their buffet variety a lil.

Their dessert part was just awesome so many variety... live kulfi counter was uniqe. Bt one should visit the place once...

Don't judge me but this was my first visit to this place.

Now that that's out of the way, let me start by saying that I'll divide this review into four sections. 1) Service 2)Ambience 3)Food and 4)Feedback.

The service was one of the best services from any eatery, if not the best, that I have ever been to. From the moment we walked in till the moment we left we were made to feel like we had won some kind of a exclusive dinner for two or something. The staff was amazingly polite, friendly and yet in a very good way, informal. The satisfaction of my taste buds apparently was their sole priority.

2) The ambiance undoubtedly was as good as the service. We got nice cozy seats and I ate my way into fatso-land. :D

3) The star attraction there is the food and you won't really be disappointed with that either. That said, I did find the biriyani to be not up to mark with some of the others you find at different joints all over Kolkata. Personally I'd prefer a plate from Arsalan any day.

That said, they left no spatchella unturned to make sure I walk away tasting the best biriyani ever(more on that in the next section). By the time I made my way to the dessert plate I hardly had any room left, but from what did try, I was left licking the spoon.

4) Feedback:- This is probably the first restaurant that takes cares of its customers so well, at least, in my opinion. When I was asked how the food was, I genuinely told them that I had tasted better biriyani before and immediately he asked me what was missing and before I knew it, a chef(though, probably not the head chef by any chance) walked up to me and assured me that they would alter the it to my liking send a plate out. I personally have never seen this level of commitment all over a plate of biriyani. The final plate was better but I'd still go for a plate from Arsalan. Maybe it's just me. In any case, if the biriyani failed to win my heart, the service certainly did. :)

Legendary restaurant! If someone needs a proper definition of value for money they should pay a visit to this place. The amount of food that you can possibly eat(till you probably kill yourself for overeating) is nowhere near for what one pays. ¬†Very hospitable staff and individual attention to every customer is something that impressed me. Good ambience too. The mouthwatering kebabs were perfect in every sense. The live grill right in your table was new to me. One should take care to put a stop to starters at the right moment for there are loads more they offer. The main course has delectable delicacies. And finally the deserts- they were the star attraction for me. Overall, a fantastic afternoon!!!!

Went here for the first time in a office get together, the ambience was in between average and gud. The starters were OK OK not as good as compared to Sigree . The kebabs were not crispy, the main course for non-vegeterians were very limited and the deserts didn't had much options also, the only plus points were the kulfis !! One has to really try the pan flavoured kulfi. Overall was a average experience!!

Interior decor is not much to look at but once u get to the buffet u will gouge on it like anything. Grill is the same as in flame and grills. U get to enjoy roasting it. The food here is awsum. U wudnt b able to get enuf of it. A beer will certainly help. Main course is all about variety even though d taste is not as good as the appetizer. Desserts are average.

I visited this place with office colleagues as it was the chosen venue for a team party. It was a win win for everyone. The food specifically the starters are delicious my fav was prawn and fish kebab. Loved the allu tikia as well. Chicken was good. Their anguri Gulab jamun is lip snacking good. After all the starters you find it difficult to go to lunch buffet but their fish cooked with basil sauce is too good. Worth the long wait and slightly light purse üòé

If any particular restaurant had been on our wishlist, it was this one. Located in sector V Salt Lake, BBQ Nation, is one of the most famous and iconic restaurants you 
can come across. We reached just in time for the lunch buffet. Starting with the complementary soft drinks, the starters were again the star of the show. There were just so many items of it, that it would be difficult to recollect each of them. There were starter items on chicken, mutton and prawns. And multiple varieties of them. You would hardly be able to think about what you have just eaten. since the starters keep on coming. And, as is expected from BBQ Nation, the qualities of each and every items on the starter lists was absolutely great. In fact, we were actually so full after having the delicious starters, that we could even go on to the main courses. Rather, after having finished our lunch, we headed for the desserts. And there again, this restaurant delights your taste buds to no lesser extent. From ice creams to chocolate sauce, from sweets to fruits to kulfi, this place has it all. And again, we heartily enjoyed our desserts as well. The hospitality was great as well- we were asked how the meal was, after each serving. On the whole, it was a memorable experience again here at BBQ Nation, and surely, we are going to head there again in the near future.

This place is sooooo lively. It's always abuzz with foodies and families lining up to get into the restaurant. There is on demand live music and absolutely perfect setup for a lovely evening. All you need to do is tell the waiters whether you are a veggie or not. The plates will be set accordingly. And then a live barbecue on your table itself. You can order infinite amount of starters before you go puking, hahaha! Even the main course is great. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.

Positives
-non-veg options are really good 
- ice cream is great

Negatives
- Cheesecake was really bad
- At least keep someone for serving the ice cream as its a little messy task !

Clearly one of the best restaurants in Kolkata. Especially for people who love grilled food and more for those who're missing a Nando's in Kolkata. Barbeque Nation is right up there with the best restaurants in India. I've been to their Vizag outlet as well and the food there was equally delectable. Looking for grilled food? You won't find a better joint than Barbeque Nation in Kolkata (Calcutta).

On a Sunday evening my brother decided to give us a treat on his Birthday at Barbeque Nation. It was a lovely evening. They made our day. First of all I would like to thank Barbeque Nation for the lovely cake they arranged in occasion of my brother's birthday. And secondly it is not necessary to say that their buffet items were awesome. The first item was served baby corn. It was so sizzling and yummy.. they will serve you until you do not ask them to stop and put the flag down. Hot gulap jamon and the pan kulfi was beautiful. I have never tasted such kulfi ever. They serve 4-5 kind of kulfi..

This is the best place I have been in sector 5. Their buffet section is awesome, right choice for the foodies. The kebab sticks on your table griller will give you a great ambience. In starters, prawns is a must try. For main course go for the crabs (it's newly added in menu). For dessert you can choose chocolate cake and hot gulab jamun and orange tart. There is a kulfi counter which gives a choice from 6 flavours. Pan flavoured kulfi is the best.

If u plan to go one should be empty stomach. The food is such delight that you forget you have come with someone. The staff is very polite and took care of individuals needs of each person. Be it starters ,main course , dessert you will cherish each and everything. Jus forgot to mention one thing an option of soft drinks or fresh limes should also be kept in the buffet.

Have heard of this place and always wished to go and try their food but couldn't make it for some or the other reason. Finally made it possible on 31st of Aug 2015 as it was husband's b['day and am really happy to announce that made a great choice of restaurant for the special day. The starters were yum. All the starters were perfectly spiced and perfectly cooked (only the prawns were a under cooked I felt but that didn't affect me to rate the place :-P )Over all ambiance was greatStaff hospitality were very warming¬†They came and asked for what we required and how was the food. So thumbs up to that. I really liked the fried corn stuff. I couldn't stop myself ¬†from taking it every time they came to serve it :-PMe, my husband and my friend were so engrossed in the taste of starters that we couldn't even have main course. So straight away moved to dessert.Now another loving segment DESSERTS. The chocolate cake, Tarts, Phirni and yes least but not the last Gulab Jamuns. Complete bliss !!!!¬†Finally we were gifted with a memento which was really heart touching. Thank for that :-)I would love to visit again and again to such a lovely place¬†And yes visiting soon for trying the main course too¬†Thanks for your hospitality and food once again¬†Keep it up :-)

Heard so lot about this place from my colleagues, that my gastronaut nature has hauled to visit this place on this weekend. I reached here with my hubby for a buffet lunch. The Non-Veg Lunch Buffet costs Rs. 730 per person (inclusive of all taxes). No corporate discounts available currently as informed by a steward.

The steward asked us about our choice of complimentary drink, which we chose a soft drink and an aam panna. Then the array of appetizing and delectable starters began. Out of the lot, my pick will be- 1. Fried Sweet Corn. 2. Cajun Spiced Potatoes. 3. Zafraani Tangdi. 4. Coastal BBQ Prawns. 5. Lasooni Mutton Seekh Kebab.

Then we have moved to the main course section. Countless spread, but my pick- 1. Dum Biriyani. 2. Laal Mass. Here to mention that they have a spread of garden-fresh salads. In Dessert section I had a yearning for the Angoori Gulab Jamuns. Gulab Jamuns were luscious, soft & heavenly. Mango Pudding & Chocolate Brownie has also impressed my taste buds. Lastly the Chocolate Kulfi won my heart for the day.

Would definitely visit this place in future, as it can be declaim as the Paradise for Foodies.

Paid a visit today, for the first time. The service and the decor is great. Also the desserts and the fried prawns. But the kebabs were quite ok. Only thing is 'twas unlimited. The kind of thing that attracts a lot of people. The main course isn't worth mentioning. Not worth trying as well. So it's ok if you are there only just for kebabs and desserts. 
And finally to clarify, the price of the buffet is same as the one mentioned here on zomato, all taxes are included in that, also a free drink and bottle of water. 
Hope this helps, Cheers !

Barbeque Nation has been one of our favorite eateries since it's inception in 2004-2005 when we were located in Bengaluru. This branch of Barbecue Nation lives up to its reputation of warmth and eagerness of it's attendants to serve its customers. 

We prefer celebrating our special occasions in this joint and it has been no different in Kolkata. 

This place has received enough reviews and ratings which speak volumes about its quality and consistency. The kababs are wonderfully seasoned and juicy and tend to melt in your mouth. Our favorite have always been the Prawn variant and the Tangdi.

The attendants here are equally warm and cordial and are at your table as soon as you need them. 

Excellent food and service. Keep up the good work!!!

Exceptional hospitality, you don't feel as if people are bothering you too much or being over attentive. Service staff were always at your table at adequate intervals right when you needed. Awesome experience.

Food amazingly satisfied the palate each dish in the buffet spread.

In fact the chef too came to us and took feedback on the food.

Surprisingly they refused to accept any tips, just cuz they charge service tax.

In totality a great dining experience.

I dont think theres anything left to say about barbeque Nation. But my last visit makes me write this. After repeated visits I got a little tired of the same menu & dint go back there in last 6 months until last week & i'm glad I did so!! The same starters as it was. The chef came enquiring & i found the fish kebab lil undercooked. In some time I was pleasantly surprised as I was send a different fish kebab on behest of the chef. And man, tht was one of the best fish kebab I have had!! Thanks Chef!!! One major complain against Barbeque Nation was there are not so good maincourse menu,which I gues they took pretty seriously!! The food tasted awesome to say the least...Be it the Railmway mutton curry or the chicken or the biriyani!! Was pleasantly surprised by the inclusion of Crab in the main course menu...and it tasted good enough!! Next comes the star of the day, the deserts!! From the mouse, the mango pudding to the gulab jamun everything was perfect to say the least. Just a lil bit dissappointing was the chilly brownie & the pastries served. The kulfi added the last feather in the crown. Be it the mango kulfi or the malai one or even better, the pan one...I couldnot stop myself from having 4 kulfies!! Special recomendation for the Pan kulfi...even if u dont like anything pan flavoured,do taste the pan kulfi....its tht gud!! Thanks You Barbeque Nation...u definately made my day!!

If you are a foodie, you are just not allowed to live in this planet anymore if you never visited Barbeque Nation. üòÇüòÇ Please do yourself a favour of trying their buffet menu. Unlimited kebabs are the reason i visit again and again. I was regular of Barbeque Nation in Mumbai also. 
This perticular outlet is good. Wide sittings. Parking available. Located in RDB juat beside Chai Break. Just close your eyes and pay a visit. Try out anything in the menu,its a gurantee you wont be disappointed

A great place for buffet lovers.. Classy and elegant interiors, with wooden furniture, the ambience of this place is cheerful.

Having visited this outlet quite a few times, I must say that this place serves food of decent quality. The chicken kebabs are usually good, especially the Tangri Kebabs. I dont like the fish kebabs at all. The corn served at the beginning and the Cajun Spiced Potatoes are two items I absolutely love. The mains are usually okayish. The desserts are good, especially the Phirnee served in the cute little matkas.

What makes this place a winner is the sheer quantity of food served at a fixed amount per head. The huge quantities, unlimited kebabs, an assortment of main courses and desserts, the impeccable service- all add up to create a great experience. But if one sits down & thinks about the quality of each individual item, then there is a lot of scope for improvement.

And yes, as I have already mentioned, they leave no stone unturned when it comes to their service, which is one of the best in town & which is why this place is a favourite of so many people.

The main course isn't worthy at all.. The game changer were the desserts.. Loved them all.. I have my own way of mixing desserts and I could do it pretty easily.. Loved the pan kulfi the most.. They way it was garnished before presenting was awesome..

This place is where you can have your food,relax a bit and then can have your food again. The food,ambience,music( though I visited on a Sunday and they were repeating Enrique hits) and the location,everything is good about this place.
The buffet includes various kebabs,chicken,fish(yumm),mutton,sea-food,prawns,sweet corn and aloo tikkis. There was some kind of Thai food festival going on and we had thai-inspired dishes in the main course. There was Crab too. 
The desserts were something to die for. Firni,Brownie,mango mouse,icecream and then flavoured kulfi !! 
Beautiful ambience,too good food and pocket friendly. A must try!

Words cannot describe your experience inside this restaurant. The atmosphere inside is just buzzing. I've been here a few times & never seen this place empty though the size of the queue outside changes with the weather & depends on the day of the week (do not try this place without a reservation on weekends). The food is amazing & served non-stop @ your table till you 'raise the signal'. The rest of the buffet is a little underwhelming considering what you've gourged on sitting at your table. Excellent service with polite staff ensures your experience to be an unforgettable one.

If you want to give your tongue a standard feast then Barbeque Nation is just the perfect place. A wide range of variety with a classy ambience is what it is all about. The staff is extremely well behaved and will treat you just like a "jamai". They keep asking you again and again whether you like the food or not and if  you have any complaint kindly let them know. With the food i must say its something to die for. Starting with chicken , mutton, lamb and prawn all tastes extremely good. The main fantasy is the starters. Starters are so good that people dont feel like putting the table flag down which is a sign to denote that you are done with starters and would like to head towards maincourse. Maincourse inudes various kinds soups, biryani, friedrice, and exotic collection of all kinds of dishes. They will serve you plain naan, butter naan and rumali roti on request, by the time you finish collecting your maincourse and go back to your table you will find your request waiting on your table. The desserts are delicious especially the firni. Brownie with ice cream is another yumm. Never forget to take gulab jamun , its just amazing. 
The overall food , ambience and treatement is seriously amazing. A must go place for all foodies.

Food quality is great as always, just added another jewel in the crown with their ' Thai Food Festival '. I had been to several restaurants in India and abroad hence unhesitatingly consider Barbeque Nation as a top class Restaurant and perhaps the best in Kolkata. Five out of five is just adequate and obviously I give it a very strong recommendation.

This is still the best place to have buffet in Salt Lake.. From starters to desserts everything is good..
My top picks wud be their Ajwaini fish kebab,tandoori kebab and their recent addition, the kulfis..
And somehow if you can manage to get the happy hour deal it's absolutely amazing..

No wonder its a 4.9 on 5 on zomato.If u love grills nd deserts then this is the right place for uh... Went there with friends for celebrating birthday.It was an awesome experience. I must say the ambience was very good and the service was top class...
Now comming to the main part...they served us with plenty of starters...I specially loved the crab cakes... Those were awesome in taste.Even the simplest babycorn tasted unique.Their main delicacies were the variety of starters.Loved the chicken wings which were on constant grill.Just loved it.
After putting down the starters flag we went for main course. It comprised of various items such as biriyani ,mutton kosha,chilly crab,peanut chicken etc etc...Every dish tasted yumzz....
Now finally comming to the desert section...U will be amazed by the collection of their desert.Varieties of ice creams ,sweets,kulfis and the list goes on...
Overall it was the best place I ever visited
Njoyed a lot with

An unplanned visit to Barbeque Nation today from office for lunch. This place obviously is a pioneer in the buffet service. The starters were tasty and cooked with precision. The mushroom though could have been made better and was not up to the mark.. The chicken wings were succulent and made for a great change. There was some festival going on today, as a result of which, the prawns were not served through the sheeks available. Instead, they were crispy and were served directly on the plates. It was yummy. The main course and desserts were the normal stuff. I visited this place after like 3 years today as was surprised to see the kulfi stall. This made for a great change in taste in desserts and they were really delicious.¬†
This is a great place and is definitely recommended.¬†
Two things that I might want the management to notice:
1) The mushroom has to taste better. Though I am not a veggie at all, but I know the taste of the mushroom was awful.
2) The vents need to be worked upon. This is a grilled buffet place and its bound to be hot during peak hours. But even keeping these things in mind, the vent was okayish when I last visited this place.

All in all, a nice place with great quality of food and definitely recommended.

Nothing better then a sunday brunch at Barbeque Nation. I say this is the Best in its Segment of buffet meal. The best part is that they never leave there customers unsatisfied. Last time I being there I asked them for a cheese kulcha which they surely made but it was having less chesse and was of no taste, after serving they came to ask about the quality n service and i replied unsatisfactory for the bread, with no time they represented new bread even after my repeated request to not to get the same but they forced and got it and asked to have at least 1 portion. 

The taste was totally unforgettable as well the service.

The best. Simply the best. Buffet at its best. The only place where I have seen kabab being roasted on the chulha in the table itself right in front of your eyes. Endless kababs are being served and this is the place for a real foodie. If you get tired of eating Then you are presented with a wide range of mocktails and cocktails.

If I write another review by saying good things then it will just add 1 to the existing pile of reviews. So what I will say will be the points where this restaurant can improve. First of all they should make few changes to the buffet menu, specially they should add something different to the starter section because people like us who have visited the place uncountable times, it has become monotony. Secondly they should change the current chef who is making pathetic prawns and main courses. Service has become very slow in happy hour.

My brother had planned a pre-birthday treat for me,so we went to Barbecue Nation and got to know that a Thai festival was going on. On the menu were things we had never heard of before,but then all went well with us-extremely well!
The Thai starters were great,sweet n spicy. We loved Chamchuri coconut prawns specially.As usual waiters and chefs came and took our feedback. We didn't take any veg starters except for Lampang tofu. We were served 6 non-veg starters,all were delicious. The main course had a bit more variety than usual menu-Indian Railway mutton curry,Chilli crabs in Holy Basil,etc.The desserts were again extremely delicious. There were 6-7desserts. Apart from that,we had great kulfis from the live kulfi counter.
Overall we got great service and I thoroughly enjoyed my pre-birthday lunch!

Heard a lot about this place. So, decided to visit there. I am happy to say that I have been completely blown by every single thing of that place !!!!Sawasdee- a Thai food festival is going there where one can have an experience of Thai cuisine along with Indian. Now coming to there hospitality..... they have the finest table managers who takes care of your every need. they are even ready to improvise the dishes on demand.Starters are simply awesome. A lot of variation in both veg and non veg sections kept us all occupied.Now the main course tasted well but frankly speaking I couldn't pay much attention to it as I was focused towards the desert section.A touch of Thai cuisine was every where even at the deserts.One item that stole my heart was coconut cheesecake...... really innovative...mango sago pudding tasted beautiful... never tasted anything like that.... Firni was¬†of finest quality¬† which is way better than famous Arsalan et. al.¬†Also the famous paan kulfi (introduced to us by the table manager) was the ultimate finishing touch.....Note:- People who haven't visited there thinks that its too much costly as rumours have flown to distant places that it costs approx. 800 bucks per person. But its only on dinner. If you are planning to go there for lunch then I would suggest to be there between 12-12:30 pm (Mon-thurs) since there u get a discount of 100 bucks per person.......and this is not a rumour !!!!So, people who are still in dilemma should try this place with out hesitation..... U can even book your table in advance which will make the whole thing easy for u...... And one last thing, the price shown a Zomato is inclusive of VAT, Service charge and service tax....so u need not have to pay anything extra other than the rate showed.

The name says it all !!
Everythng was so upto the mark that am confused as frm where to start with :p
Well the ambience is undoubtedly classy with huge seating capacity yet spacious.

Food: Starting off with the starters,all wer tasty but I liked sweet corn the most.IT ws totally different frm anywhere else.
Was so filled with the starters itself that I had no place to eat the main course.coz they serverd us 8 different types of veg items.

Main course dint have much variety but then it was quite sufficient.

Deserts was again a super add in the the entire meal.N Number of variety.One just need to increase their appetite to eat al the variants.

Trust me your stomach will be filled but your desire to eat more will not.

Last but not the least- an amazing and delightful experience to be.
Recomended- a must must visit... :)

Writing a review for a restaurant like Barbeque Nation is as useless as the letters 'UEUE' in the word QUEUE! They will treat you to a point where you'll start hating the sight of food. The best buffet you'll find in the city.

Brilliant and superfast service. Relentless starters delivered to your sigree. Courteous waiters, and even the Chefs walk upto your table to solicit feedback. Endless spread and too many dishes to be able to remember. Among which I love the Mutton Seekh Kebab, Prawn, Tangdi Kebab, Fish Kebab, Chicken Kebab.. Oh, did I miss anything?? :-) In the Veg platter, I like the corn item and grilled potato.

Sad part is that after the bombardment of the starters, you tend to ignore the main course, simply because you can eat no more. However it doesn't take anything from the delicious Chicken Dam Biryani, Mutton Gravy and Crab or Fish Curry. Well the list of food items just never seem to end!

Then comes the desserts. Wonderful is the word. Their ice-cream tastes so good. The hot gulab jamun is something to die for. The Phirnee and custard, again so sweet. Even the watermelon tastes so fine.

Large space available inside the restaurant. Ideal for office parties or big get togethers or gatherings. Price of the buffet absolutely fits the food and service they offer. I've been to this place quite a few times and each time I have been happy, satisfied and overloaded with food. I just can't put the flag down! ;-)

Super service, super food, super rate, super experience! Thank you Barbeque Nation for being there. It's value for money!

Suggestion: They need to work on the cooling system. It can get hot inside with the sigrees and huge crowd.

Over time, a lot of restaurants have started offering buffets but I have always remained loyal to barbeque nation. Located just under end cinemas., it's like a paradise for foodies like me! 
If you have the appetite and cash to spare, don't look for options other than this.! What I love about this place ( besides its lip smacking kebabs) is their service.. I was there with my friend today but ulfortunately we were already full so couldn't guzzump d kebabs that we always do. 
What I loved is that their waiters come to our table to ask why we didn't eat much. Such chivalry is these days in much eateries and its a welcome change. 
P. S: focus a bit more on mutton kebabs

Writing reviews for restaurants like Barbeque Nation is funny...they are established joints of the city and need no introduction or reviews...so i will keep it short....unlike my other reviews :))

If you are a foodie and can eat a lot, go for this place...especially if you are a hardcore non-vegetarian....they will overwhelm you with starters...atleast 12-15 non-veg starters...probably 8-10 veggies but i didnt noticed them much...they will place a barbeque in front of you and the serving will be quick, efficient and relentless....unless you drop down the small flag in your table....items included fish, chicken, mutton, prawns, crab....tikkas, barbeque wings..fish tikka, crab cakes, shammi kebab etc....

The rest of the buffet is average and well spread out but you will not get bowed over after the start...but you will not mind much as you might have munched enough by then....a lot of people skip the actual buffet since they are too full...but they have a nice dessert section...quite a few items to choose from and keep a little space for the kulfis, they have some amazing collection...

very nice place...a bit of live music...busy...not much of an ambience....very quick service....you get almost everything....at the price they charge, its absolute value for money....around 750+ taxes for dinner...a place for all....

you will love this place if you are any one or all of these -(a) if you love to eat a lot, don't care about small helping many course tiny helpings, and value quantity and options for a good price ( a group I belonged to all through my student days)  (b) you dont care for a subtle pallete ( and your brain doesn't act like gordon ramsay's and you dont feel bad if the chicken is 30 seconds over-cooked) and (c) your pallete doesn't get confused if u jump from a pasta salad to a biriyani.

the spread is very broad, and the starters range from mutton sheikh to live grills. I usually love the cajun potatoes as well. the desserts spread is also very good and the best one is the gulab jamun. bbq nation mostly has a lot of special food festivals year around -so that counters the monotony of an otherwise standardised menu nation wide. there was a special kulfi counter when I visited last time and the kulfis were very good.

This branch is located inside sector five and is insanely crowded ( by insane I do mean insane) all the time. Ignorant of the implications of a place being located in sector five, I landed up there with my parents for their anniversary lunch on a weekday (since I thought weekday lunches typically get less crowd) and was penalised brutally by a 1.15 hours waiting time. I am not sure if the place takes reservations, but if it does, then please do. it can be life saving ! 

since we began eating around 2.15 pm types, the grills were filled up slow and the meat kebabs needed more marination and cooking. it did feel like they were running out of starter stocks and rushing to deliver the orders. it wasn't the best of the starters I had a bbq nation on this day ( which is why I am downgrading it to 3.5 rating).

in the end, bbq nation is a paradise of standardised menu based abundant food eating experience and works very well for large groups and family gatherings. while you may not fall head over heels in love with the food, do it give a try at least a few times.

Savory food, excellent ambiance and diverse choices. Be sure to skip the main dishes to immerse yourself into the decadence of the kebabs and the desserts. The price is a bit on the higher side but the overall dining experience makes it worth every penny.

A great buffet place in Kolkata. I wasn't aware of this place until me and my friend discovered it on a warm Sunday afternoon. We had to wait for a while to get a table but when we entered the place, immediately we realized that it wasn't an ordinary place. The ambiance was good and upbeat. We could hear laughter of joy and talks of satisfaction. Everything from the starters to the dessert was a delight. The service was really fast and all the staffs were really warm and nice. If you are in Kolkata or if you havent visited this place then BBQ Nation should be in your wish list.

I have been there several number of times, it is at RDB building.. Never tried their al la carte, coz of world famous superhit buffet.. In veg starters, crispy corn and baby potatoes are great, in non-veg starter the tandoori, prawn and fish was very tender and delicious.. Lots of variety in main course... Mutton and chicken dum biriyani are superb... They have many dessert dishes, I love the anguli gulab jamun and the pastry most.. Firni was also very yummy.. At the end, kulfi become the show stopper.. Approx 6 to 8 flavors of kulfi is there.. I couldn't resist myself, and tried 5 of them.. Malai, Kesarpista, Chocolate, Mango and Pan... Among them, mango was ok-ish.. Rest were awesome, especially Pan was mouth watering... The best buffet experience..

Barbeque Nation is the best buffet place in the town. Ambience is elegant and classy. This place is always busy it's better to book your table in advance. We didn't get the table in advance so we made in first come first serve option. Barbeque Nation is something beyond food. Service was top notch. Waiters were very polite and quick. Chief came personally to ask us about the food quality and taste. That was really impressive. Coming to food, there were plenty of starter. We had peri peri fish, chicken lemon and lasooni jhinga (prawn). These items were mouth watering. In main course there was lots of items but I had chicken dum biriyani, fired rice, alu matar, mutton, chicken, bhindi kurkure.I tasted Bhindi kurkure for the first time and I really enjoyed. In dessert there were ice cream, gulab jamun, firni, pastries, mango moose. Its was a great experience. At end they also refused the tip. It was their behaviour that will bring you here again and again. I will definitely visit again.

Let me start with saying that .. The staff is very friendly, which makes a lot of difference. You will get good food at many places but friendly staff is rare, its one of the feel good factors of any restaurant..... OK.... now comes the fun part... Well as we all know that the BARBEQUE NATION is famous for its kebabs and they have a number of them, if you are a first timer like me you might be mesmerized by the quality and quantity they provide, fish. chicken, mutton,prawn, mushroom,paneer, fruits... yes you heard it right, they even have fruit kababs,..... don't expect it to be mouth watering , but it adds up to the taste... Main course is what i was looking forward to but, i must say its disappointing.. my friends warned me for that.. so i wasn't expecting it to be awesome . there is nothing that need much of description... The dessert is the part where they change your disappointment to a sugary delightful experience., Gulab Jamuns are the best, on top of that kulfi is something that you should not miss , and the rest are the things that you should try even if its just for experience ..... Drinks are also one should look forward too. I WAS HAPPY TO BE THERE, AND I M SURE ANYONE ELSE WILL ALSO BE.

Simply Awesome. I first visited the place unknowingly during February 2015, and since then I use to be there every week. The starters (prawn, fish, mutton & chicken kebabs) are just amazing. My advice to any new visitor would be to plan your meal with 70% kebabs, 15% Main course & 15% desserts.

It used to be one of the best table-oven buffets with it's position hovering around Flame and Grill's. (Sigree, Global Grill).
But all the wonders get over when you turn down the flag on your table, which indicates stopping any further serving of kebabs on your table-oven.
The main course, though tasty and of good quality, is not at par with the price you pay. Moreover, the desserts are not as good as many other buffets. When you serve simple puddings and Indian sweets, no matter how tasty they may be, they aren't the ones that require sophisticated cooking instruments, utensils and qualified chefs, hence, you get them elsewhere too. When you pay for an exclusive buffet, you will expect exclusive items, which are now lacking in their present spread.
However, if you just want to dine out, and the restaurant does not have any expectations to meet, you can certainly go this place

Eat your heart out.. Wonderful place to go to if one feels like gorging on sinful loads of kebabs (Average Kebabs but in quantity). Barbeque Nation catches the attention of a first timer. The barbecue pit is actually built into the middle of your table-top, so you basically cook your own food!

The flow of starters as long as the flag is up is an interesting concept.¬†However the main course is disappointing, not worth at all. But the quantity of starters is enough that you don't even need a main course!¬†
Good food, extensive menu. Service is praiseworthy.Little congested 'n crowded place. The washrooms were clean with soap and paper towels, cleanliness is at a good level.¬†

This restaurant was buzzing with birthday parties and family outings. It clearly gets very busy, so worth booking ahead if you can.

One good thing about BBQ Nation is that no one would complain about the price after one has spent 1-2hours here. Have already been here 5-6 times and have always been embraced with a variety of tasty items.

Starters are very delicious and include chicken, prawn, mutton and fish. Their most recent inclusion is mutton liver keema

Main course is good with the normal biryani, chicken, fish and mutton dishes.

Best part is the dessert...firni, gulab jamun, two types of pastry, ice cream with sauces, fresh fruits and their very latest addition-kulfi.

Service is extremely good. The attendants are very courteous and are always tracking our plates and accordingly offering us something to eat.

Overall a very good and value for money experience.

Be it friends or family, this place has to be there in everyones list.

Advice: Go there super hungry as you will need the tummy space to indulge in the gorgeous food available.

This is the best restaurant among those who serve buffet. I have had lunch and dinner over there several times. But sometimes I do feel they dont keep the standards high but it's still pretty good and far better than its direct competitor Flame & Grill.

Visiting for the first time I had a misconception that this place is a paradise for non vegetarian only, but let me tell you its an amazing place for veggies too.. The food is simply awesome..the staarters will really take care of your appetite and you need not reach the main course. To add it on it was the live music and the wonderful Pan kulfi my favorite..!! Thanks for the wonderful food...it was really a treat

I have visited this place 3times and must say they serve the best kababs in the town. I love starters there and desserts the most over here. A must visit for people who love kababs. And a great place for a small office party.

This is one which does not require any comment or recommend, unfortunately this was my first hit to the place. Been there yesterday. Have not touched the main course, full of starters and desserts. Overall experience was like gone crazy over it. Though I have 2 recommendations: 
1. Mutton Sheekh Kebab is very garlic'y'. Though when I mentioned that to the person serving, he served us something customized on the same. Cheers for that
2. Can you have some more options on complimentary beers, like Tuborg, Carlsberg.
Overall I am crazy over it. To mention one special name I will name the Kulfi-s. I tried all 6 flavours and they were like superb and cool'icious'. 
Cheers and will hi(ea)t the sticks again soon..

This place needs no introduction. It's possibly one of the most popular restaurant in Salt Lake area. I've been there once and am already in love with this place! The starters are absolutely finger-licking delicious. We had ordered both veg and non-veg. While every single non-veg item was amazing the absolute winner for me was that Cajun Spicy Baby Potato. I don't even know how many potatoes I devoured! :P
I liked the fact that the staff is very well-mannered and pays attention to you. When they asked about the food, we said that we didn't like the Paneer Ajwani Tikka as much and they brought us more which tasted much better.
Moving on, the buffet was good and you'll realise it's too many items than you can eat after stuffing yourself with the kebabs!! My only regret... I was too full to taste more than 1 kulfi flavour.
So yes, it may be on the pricey side, but it's absolute value for money! You could also go between 12-12:30 on weekdays. It's slightly cheaper then. And it's always better to call and book a table earlier because of the rush.

This is one of the best chain of buffet restaurants which offers unlimited food to you .Though i am a vegetarian n this place is called heaven for non-veg still vegetarians wont be coming out unhappy .The starters are awesome being served unlimited times to you at your table over the bar-b-q which includes paneers, mushrooms, soya plus many more which i simply love . The main course is just fine as all the stress is put on having the starters but the desserts i would say is superb which includes ice-creams, pastries, gulab-jamuns, mousses, etc etc with an excellent ambience. In short an ultimate food destination for foodies.

This place require no intro - Have visited it n number of times earlier - but reviewing it for the first time on Zomato.
We went here for a team lunch as this place is nearby my office.¬†
Ambience is nice, but is disturbed by the overcrowding of customers at this place - which can't be helped.¬†
We obviously went for the buffet lunch - which consists of 5 veg starters, 5 non veg starters, main course and desserts.¬†
Staff are like over courteous and over polite - they try to make you as comfortable as possible.
Starters served (along with the superb green chutney) were as usual outstanding. Veg ones included Mushroom (which I don't eat), Paneer (nice), cajun spiced potato (good), corn spinach tikki (average), african grill (which I don't eat). Apart from these, they served special starters - Gobhi - which was out of the world and also served dry babycorn on demand - which wss just average. Another bread like starter was there - I don't know the exact name - but was excellent.
Moving to mains, it was the first time, I had tomato basil soup at this place - which was just ok. Veg Biryani was just average today - unlike Barbeque Nation. Most saddening part was that a mediocre Dal tarka was available instead of their fabulous Dal Makhani. Matar methi was there which was nice, patal bhaja - nice, and paneer - very good. Again, the masala kulcha was too good. Also, there was a variety of salads, which I did not taste.¬†
Thereafter, desserts included some cakes (I did not have), vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce (too good), phirni (so so) and gulab jamuns (good).
Coming to the most delicious part of the buffet - the special kulfi counter set up by them a few days back. It served some 6-7 flavours along with toppings.
I had the chocolate (Excellent) and Paan kulfi (Out of the world). It's the most delicious paan kulfi I ever had.

Overall, a very nice experience. Indeed, this is the best restaurant chain in the whole of Kolkata - Do visit and get BARBECUED!

Looking forward to another visit very soon!
Cheers !

Best place to eat in kolkata i guess. The starters are just awesome and yumm. All the kebabs are very delicious. The main course is also something to die for. Briyani and rogan josh are extremely tasty. They also have a variety of deserts. I recomend the pulao rather than the biryani. Pulao is served on special
 request and is damn tasty. Well i think thats the place you are looking for if you want the heartiest meal in kolkata. 
Keep it up
Best wishes

A long time intention to have a superb buffet comes to the destination -Barbeque Nation. This is the best place in the city for buffet now I can say.
In starter the kebabs were fantastic, chicken,prawn and the fish tikkas are terrific, wonderful, we enjoyed the starters a lot.After that in main course there were plenty of items.We have tried Veg fried rice with paneer and dal tadka,all were delicious,delightful and divine.Fish kolhapuri was excellent and extraordinary,I have never taste a fish as tasty as it.Chicken dum biryani is another appealing item of them.Another amazing and appetising item is Bhindi kurkure,it's a simple side dish but finger licking.In desert,there have plenty of items. Ice cream, firney are enjoyable,pastries are also pleasant, but that gulab jamuns were marvellous and lip smacking.
Ambience is wonderful and satisfying,but they should play a little better music,it's not too attractive that can play in your mind along foods.Staffs were very well behaved and mannered, even their cooks were also aware of customer need and also interacted with us about the quality and quantity of items.
Overall it's an amazing and satisfying experience and will be there again soon.

Undoubtedly, the best restaurant in town, both in terms of its food and hospitality. The 'on the grill' menu is the main catch with its perfectly spiced and barbequed prawn, fish and chicken. (I've never had the veg menu, so unsure about that). The nutpie and various flavoured coolfies are a revelation for your sweet tooth. And the best part, any preparation you didn't like, the staff makes an honest effort to supplement that with a kebab or desert of your choice. 
I've been here twice, both with friends & family and all of them agree with me when I say, Barbeque Nation is the best restaurant in town!

Awesome food, awesome ambience, awesome prices. The service is good, menu has variety, but the live music is sometimes too loud. I have been to this place lots and lots of times (the count runs into double digits, starting with 2), but could never move past the starters. Infact, I personally don't know anyone who has moved padt the startets and deserts and gone for the main course. Their USP is the variety in starters and deserts along with very affordable prices. This place is worthwhile foe die hard foodies, having a huge appetite.  Overall,  awesome dining experience.

This place needs no description! Probably city's best venue for north Indian buffet. The best thing about the place is value for money. the appetizers and desserts are stellar. The kebabs were perfectly cooked and they even offered to personalise the taste according to your preference which is a super plus. The chicken dum biriyani was amazing. The kulfi counter bestows happiness. Excellent service and friendly staff. The only sad part was we had to wait for 2 long hours because of the rush on a Sunday afternoon. But after what we ate, no complaints!

I just thought of writing . ."GO FOR IT RI8 NOW" for the review . .bcz u can't really write get into a full discussion of pros and cons about this place . .since it has hardly any cons . .:P
Just some tips:
If u r going on a weekend lunch or dinner . .go earlier than usual . .there will be a queue otherwise.
Don't eat much bfr . .or you will regret after.

The place is not very big but the seating arrangement will not mk u feel disturbed.
The buffet is AWESOME!. .They just keep serving you every kind of kebab for starters . .chicken mutton fish paneer mushroom veggies . .u name it and they don't stop until you ask them to . .
The chicken drumsticks are the best .
Also their main course dishes are great . .The biriyani is out of the world . .brilliant and its a shame they don't sell it separately.
Also their cold seafood salad and the coconut fish . .lovely!
Coming to the desserts . .they weren't as good . .the phirni did not have the proper texture and I didn't like their cake but their angoori gulab jamuns r to die for . .they also serve ice creams . .fresh fruits . .cheesecake etc.
All in all . .a place one must must must go to . .but with an empty stomach!

We were three ppl n one kid.
We had taken two veg & 1 non veg buffet.
The food was same as served in Mumbai or any other outlet.
The kulfi festival was on when we went there....had loads of kulfi with different flavours n toppings.
The service was though better then Mumbai outlets. I felt the servers there to be more courteous.
I think they should change their menu now has become monotonous.
Though the place is really good.
They also gave us a discount of Rs.300 on our bill. @Naresh Dhande

Whatever be the number of times I visit Barbeque ...every time I come out of this place  more satisfied... :-) The variety and quality of starters  served by these people is exquisite... Leave aside the non veg kebabs...even the veg starters like mushroom and grilled pineapple and Cajun potato were delicious. We ate our hearts out and were too full to try the main course. But please don't miss the dessert spread which ranges from ice cream and gulab jamun to fruit custard and yummy mousse... They have now started a kulfi counter where you can get flavoured kulfis with awesome topppings. Special mention :- pan and chocolate kulfi. 

So.....next time you are planning a birthday or a promotion treat, go for this place .. :-)

Awesome ambience . Paneer Tikka and Sweet corn for vegetarians and Kandhari Mutton seekh and Chicken leg for Non-Vegetarians is the best choice to start the  lunch. Apart from chicken,mutton and yummy non-veg dam biriyani ,Main Course also included varieties of salad and for me , eggplant salad was the tastiest choice. If you are visiting Barbeque Nation, you cannot afford to miss the DESSERT.  Hot Gulab Jamuns , Phirnee , kheer and kulfis are a  definitely a treat to taste buds. Although more vegetarian dished should be added in the Main Course.

If you are a resident of Kolkata, or even West Bengal, you are bound to have heard the name of this "Legendary Restaurant" from one of your friends or family. 

If not, then save some cash, increase your appetite and catch anyone of the innumerable buses to SDF and prepare yourself to be spoiled by the rich grandeur of ecstatic food. 

Having visited four times myself, here is my list of its KEY FEATURES: 

1. Quality of Food: The basic necessity of a restaurant is great food, and Barbeque Nation is few of the most amazing, if not, topping the charts in terms of Food Quality. Each and every item on the menu boasts of richness, freshness and of utmost perfectness. 

2. Variety: Now since we have embarked on the topic of items, this "Nation" offers a plethora of dishes- starting from our very own favorite Kababs (which is not just restricted to basic Veg/Non-Veg but many delicacies such as fish, prawn, chicken, potato, mushrooms, specials) to mouth-watering gulab jamuns, from the Shahi-aroma of Biryani to the finger-licking Koolfis, Barbeque Nation offers one of the widest variety of dishes you can possibly imagine.¬†
Personal Suggestion: Feast on the starters and the desserts as much as possible.¬†

3. Quantity: Being a buffet restaurant, the quantity of food offered per person is roughly equal to the maximum amount of food you can stuff into your belly. 

4. Ambience: Like a proper family restaurant, Barbeque Nation plays some delightful tracks to relax your mood, and also holds stage shows, with some wonderful singers, as you dine. 

5. Service: Again one of the best (getting tired of using this word now) and humble in the city. The waiters are polite and constantly ensure that you are well provided and satisfied with your needs. The Chef personally caters to everyone's needs and ensure that you are eating food, cooked with love.

Some of the other special features include:

1. Complementary Drinks: These include Aam Panna, Masala Soda, Coca Cola, Beer (you need to be of age).¬†

2. Koolfi Stall: This is a comparatively newer addition to the Restaurant but a delightful one, nevertheless. 

3. Location: An apt location, with plenty of transportation available (thanks to the Sector-V IT industry boom)

It's extremely hard to find any negative features for this restaurant but here a few minor ones:

1. Availability: You need to book your table (minimum 2-3 days), and be within 15 minutes of your reservation time. Considering the Kolkata traffic jam, this is a tight margin, but then again, this just shows the huge demand for Barbeque Nation

2. Timings: It would have been good if the restaurant was open throughout the entire day. 

3. Price: This might not be a negative feature for Lunch but 1000 odd Rupees for a weekend dinner is a tad too high. 

Ratings: 

1. Quality: 5/5

2. Quantity: 5/5

3. Ambience: 4/5

4. Variety: 4/5

5. Price: 4/5

6. Availability: 3/5

7. Location: 4/5

Overall Rating: 4.5/5

Me, being a big time foodie can say that its like i visited heaven. Ufff excellent food, so many varieties, such good taste, mouth watering kebabs. Once you enter you need to register your name along with your phone number. Then they will serve you 10 types of starters. Then they have a mutton nali ghost, chicken side dish and a fish side dish along with soup and dum biriyani. Then they have 10 types of deserts. With a complimentary drink. And the best part is tips is not allowed here. Best buffet restaurant i have ever been to.

Just love this place.

Visited this place a few days back and what an awesome experience it was.Simply amazing I must say.It was a kind of ocean of delicious food spread out before you to savour and relish.Right from the kebabs,the various starters,dishes in the main course,to the mind blowing dessert everything was amazing.I won't go in the depth naming each and every dish I tasted as they have been already mentioned in earlier reviews.A special mention of the Til Dahi ke Kebab as it was the best dish of the day.The angoori gulab jamun were also delicious.A must visit for each and everyone staying in Kolkata at least once to enjoy the service this place has to offer.And don't forget to book your seats in advance.

Well, this place has been reviewed by several people and none have rated this place below 4. And there is a reason for that because the food here is freaking awesome. Every foodie should have this delightful experience. The kebabs are the winners be it the chicken, mutton seekh or the prawn. The best thing of this place is that the staff is really cordial and friendly. They ask each customer how the food is and they are happy to serve. Being one of the most crowded restaurants and people flocking here every now and then, the staff is really well trained to manage everything in a suave manner. A great place to have both lunch and dinner with a bunch of friends or with a special someone.

Barbeque nation has created such a strong name for itself that you can walk in to any outlet in any city and they would guarantee that you walk out with a smile on your face for sure. I went on a Thursday night. The starters were amazing, as usual. The prawn
 starters deserve a special mention. They were fresh and juicy, and tasted amazingly good. I had starters for a good 45 minutes before moving on to the mains, by which time I was already full. But I still went for the biriyani and mutton roganjosh. It was extremely tender and melted in the mouth. 
Wrapping up.. I had a mango kulfi and ice cream for dessert.

I just have one request to the management. I have been here thrice now and they always put on the same playlist, that of Enrique Iglesias. Please update your soundtrack. I like his songs but it gets boring if you have to hear him for a good 2 hours during the buffet :)

All in all BQN is an amazing concept and I wish you guys continue to keep up the good work that you have been doing so far. Cheers!

Whenever I think of buffet lunch or dinner with my pals this is the first place that comes to my mind. What an amazing and sumptuous spread of food! All I ever have at this place is the buffet. The amazing starters fill me up every time and so there is no room for main course. I go straight for the desserts. The grilled prawns are my favourite! Among the desserts I love the cute little tarts they serve! Last but not least I'd like the mention the courtesy of the staff. They always welcome us with smiles and serve customized delicacies.

The starters are awesome specially the fried sweet corn, cajun potato, fish and prawn. Main course is also good, specially the biriyani. There's a live kulfi counter  for dessert. Have kept the .5 on hold in the rating as I want them to include a complimentary drink for the dinner too :)

Last month I went to Barbeque Nation with a friend for the first time. It was a big restaurant. The staffs are warm but too busy. I like the ambience.
To food. I loved the kebabs. Each is better than the other. Be it veg or non veg. Couldn't keep my hands off them. Then we went to buffet. I did not take usual rice and North Indian staples, mainly because my stomach was full of kebabs. Any way, took a bit of this and that, and as is always my habit while attending buffets, went straight to dessert. It was a Monte Carlo and it tasted delicious. Also was hot mihidana which I loved. Lastly, while passing by for dessert, I found fruit stall where freshly cut fruits were prepared. I was immediately attracted. The staff suggested mixed fruits, and I agreed. It was a concoction of mangoes, apples, cherries and bananas. It was a treat. Even my friend, who never touches fruits, was attracted by the way it was arranged and took one. Lovely experience.

The best thing about this place is the service and the personalised attention. These guys have taken service to a different level altogether. 5/5 for service. We went during their lunch service hours. Stepped in late. Took our own sweet time, but not even for once did i sense them getting irate or disturbed. The way they served the food and literally cajoled is to try  out different options, i was one superrr se bhi uparrr wala happy customer. In terms of food excellent concept of having the grills incorporated on the table. This is the reason why we can eat away lazily cos u dont hv to worry about ur food getting cold. But i had expected way more variations in terms of the bbq. A 3/5 in terms of food. But yes i will certainly visit again and refer friends too... Hats off to ur service team...

I went to this place yesterday to celebrate my birthday. I loved the place. We went for the buffet. It had unlimited starters. We had plenty of kebabs. The main course was awesome. The desert at last is worth mentioning. It had gulab jamun, cakes,  kheer, ice crm and also kulfi... food was delicious. As it was my bday we got a complimentary cake.  They clicked a pic of us and instantly gave a copy of it in a frame. very nice on their part. Even there is a stage and they sang happy bday fr me. Even they will sing for u on special reqst a song of ur choice.. very nice place.. will dfntly go again.

Great place for buffet dinner. Awesome quality , specially the series of kabab. Not sure if any 5 year child can share the food from his parent. Taking separate plate for him is not justified as hardly he with eat. Since charging ,900 / for 5 year child is not justified. Otherwise ambience is very good .I liked it very much...

If you have an insatiable appetite and cannot rest until you have tried twenty dishes at once, if you possess that metaphorical gluttonous fire that consumes anything and everything, Barbeque Nation is the right place for you. Located at the heart of the IT Sector in Salt Lake, ¬†it is one of the best buffet places in the city. Almost every time you will have to wait for quite a while till you get a table, but it is definitely worth it. The dimly lit interiors and the smell of meat grilling on hot coals is extremely inviting.

Coming to the food itself. Barbeque Nation not only serves unlimited quantiites of food, it serves food of top notch quality. Amongst the starters, the chicken, fish and paneer kababs were all exquisite. ¬†The grilled pineapple, with its tangy sweetness and slight burnish, was absolutely delicious. The complimentary fresh lime soda helped to cleansed the palate allowing us to go back for more and more. However what really stood out for me was the accompanimental sweet corn: with the slight crisp of its paper thin batter, the natural sweetness of the kernels and the flavours of the aromatics it had been tossed with made it extremly moreish and tied the entire course together.
The main course boasted of soups, numerous salads and bread rolls, biryani, chicken and mutton. All of them were good, but the biryani, with its restraint of spices and delicate aroma really stood out for me, and combined with the chicken side dish, was heavenly.

The dessert section has changed a bit since my last visit. Only one flavour of ice cream (vanilla was available). Instead, they serve 6 different flavours of kulfi. I tried the mango kulfi and it was lovely. Also the hot gulab jamun, the firni, and the kheer were decadant and delicious.

Service is very prompt and the waiters are extremely courteous, asking us after every course how we liked the food. I must say, I loved it. Why this place boasts of a 4.9 rating on zomato is understandable. A place I will go back to again, again, and again......

Went Barbeque Nation for the First time. First thing which Impressed me is the Ambiance. Other than the Fact that it has Comfy Seating Arrangements BBQN also offers You Live Music :) Spking about Foods,the Starters were simply "Lajawab". The live Grill placed on ur table will surely Make Your Day. They offer many types of Kebabs(chicken,fish,Prawn & Mutton). Don't hesitate to Ask for more kebabs as Their Staffs really Tries their best to Provide Satisfaction to customers. Main course were also good but needs to be a bit more hygienic. Finally,comes the Dessert section. No doubt it was good too. Finally,One can conclude Currently its the Best Restaurant in Kolkata :)

The live musicians sang classic English songs. The desserts were beautiful. The orange cheese cake, the mango tart, the kulfis, the icecreams with choice of syrups - they all made a fitting conclusion to the wonderful meal.

The word Utopia as the dictionary suggests is  "an imaginary place or state of things in which everything is perfect". Well, Barbecue Nation with it's humongous array of delicacies, beautiful ambience and extremely good staff is like an utopia for food lovers, only it's real, contrary to the way the dictionary describes the word.
Guests are welcomed with the smiling faces of the staff serving the welcome drink which is followed by starters that includes kebabs of every kind. The best thing about the starters is the live grill on your table. Which means you can season the kebab skewers according to your taste. The non veg kebabs are delicious for sure. But the veg section is also not far behind. In fact some of the veg starters surpass the non veg ones by far. The main course spread is humongous, of which the veg and non veg sections are equally good. The dessert section which is a paradise for people with a sweet tooth offers everything from gulab jamoon, ice cream, cheesecake, pastries to halwa and firni. Next in line is the live kulfi counter where you have six different varieties of kulfis to choose from. Basically, Barbecue Nation spoils you with choices.

Another thing that I'd like to mention is the amazing hospitality. After our lunch we had ordered virgin Mary from the bar. The service for some reason was delayed by a few minutes (which we didn't even notice). However, to our surprise the bartender himself came up to us apologizing for the delay and we were served another round of complimentary drink- The blue lagoon as an apology drink from the staff.
They make sure the customers leave happy and content.
No wonder why barbecue nation has been rated so high on Zomato.

This is undoubtedly the Mecca of voracious people like me. Go there, grab a seat, take ur time and just rediscover the taste all around. Whenever been there I have concentrated on my food in such a manner that every time I forget to notice their decor. Sorry for it though.  I thing any of their three sections starters, main course and dessert can satisfy you stand alone.

I was a little apprehensive in the beginning being a vegetarian but all my worries vanished as soon as I entered the place, live music(retro :)), happy people, relaxed and taking their time( see, you don't have to rush) while enjoying their food, bliss! 
Vegetarians don't you worry you have a lot of options. As you know food is unlimited and for starters there were 5 types of grilled starters and 3 normal starters. You can ask them to stop the starters when you're done and head for the buffet which has salad, rice(steamed and biryani), roti,  3 types of sabzi and daal and a lot of options for the desserts!
It was a pleasant experience and I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't been there already. 
And oh the service was also very good!
Bottom line you'd leave happy, with a wide smile!

Being a dessert lover,this place was like a ticket to heaven for me.
Pastries,brownies,tarts,ice-creams,gulab jamoon and what not. :')
AND the Kulfi Counter!!! *ecstatic squeal*
They have six different flavours with specific toppings for each flavour.How awesome is that?

Besides that,kebabs were okay,like in any other buffet in other restaurants.
Main course was well done.No complaints.

I visited this place twice before this visit..but due to the rush I couldn't find any seat. The minimum waiting time is 40 minutes. Finally on getting a seat I realise the reason for the rush. It's their food combined with service and ambience..the service is excellent..staff is polite and willing to serve.

All the food items are good..the chef made brownie for us on special request. I was touched by this gesture. 

In short a good place with well trained staff and good food. Number of food items completely complement the price charged for the buffet.

Barbecue Nation is a heaven for food lovers. The starters are simply awesome. Both veg and non veg items were delicious. The waiters were very courteous and served unlimited kebabs until we put down the flag of starters. Main course was also good but not like the starters. Next comes the desserts. I loved the angoori Gulab jamuns and kulfis mostly but other items were also good. What I liked most was the chef had prepared a bday cake for my friend on which ocassion we attended the lunch. The cake was yummy and came as a real surprise !!

There comes the time when your mouth decides. Barbeque Nation serves  the best buffet in the city and you can take as much time you need to finish your giant food course. The behaviour of the staffs is very warm and service is quick. I just love their fish kebab. They made it a bit spicy for me and the taste just blew my mind. Only not so good part is the desert. The koolfi is tasteless and the cakes and shandesh are dry. Only the hot gulab jamuns are mouthwatering.

best buffet in town. period. the kebabs were exquisite. The variety and quality of the veg starters simply blew me away. I found the chicken kebab a bit wanting but the rest was just too good, especially the prawn ones. But that's just the kebabs. After filling up on them, you turn around and realize there's a whole full course buffet waiting for you. Not going into details, but each and every item was splendid. And the choice of desserts - ranging from pastries to gulab jamuns, are equally good, if not better. Oh, and did I mention there's a complimentary drink for each person at the table? A tremendous experience I must say. A must visit for all the food lovers out there.

This place has been an all time favorite for me, and i have been going there since the day they had opened their doors for the first time. I would really like to keep the wait time aside which was more than 1.5 hours+  So I would really ask everyone to get the reservations done. The food was awesome with each dish better than the other. The best part is they give individual attention to their guests, for example I had some American friends with me, so they had taken an extra effort all by themselves to get less spicy food for them. I have really enjoyed my experience there as always so did my friends.

This is my new review... trust me everytime I come here I find it new.... so my review is also new :P
Starting from the entering to the restaurant... a warm welcome by receptionist.. afta we got the sit ( we went four of our colleagues) ... Mr. Paltu came to assist us... he was very well mannered... the most hillarious thing is... he still remembers me... well he served 3 sauces, one mustered sauce, one tartaric sauce, one mayonnaise ( according to me, it could be better)... and 3 oils to paint over the stakes... they gave us complementary drink... i took kingfisher beer premium... u can have sweet lime soda, 7 up... but once at a time... then they placed the grill on which they were about to place the stakes... in starter they served five non veg items one fish item, one chicken item, one prawn item, one tangri kebab, mutton kebab... the tastes were like yummy... u can have it as much as u want... in veg they had musroom kebab, baby potato with calzon sauce, babycorn fry, paneer kebab, zucccini fry, spider kebab ( this is a new item, cottage chese kofta wrapped with chowmine, nice one)... i loved potato and babycorn... btw mind the amount while u r eating this starters... coz they are super tasty .... but if u eat much u can miss others.... now in main course they had two section veg and non veg... in non veg there were dum biriyani, chicken ,mutton, chicken in oyster sauce, fish... in veg section there were paneer and chana, aloo with capscicum all are tasty... now in salad section i had fussili pasta, seafood salad, eggplant salad, chicken salad, cold cucumber with curd... each n every tasyes good.. specially i loved the eggplant salad, its unique... seafood salad was nice but mustard flavour was distracting the taste of seafoods, now in desert section we had angoor gulab jamoon which i had with vanilla icecream, then fresh fruit cream, firni, semui, browny ( not so tasty) and a swiss roll... then kulfi section... they had six types of kulfi.. kesar pista, chocolate, strawberry, mango, paan and other one i forgot... paan kulfi is the best one it tastes just same as paan... so again... BBN is like chumuliscious... go for it... ya kinda price hiked... but worth it... go grab it!!!

kababs here are delicious and delectable..the dum biryani and the raita is also mouth watering..
and no compliment can ever match to their amazing desserts,absolutely lip smacking..
the second visit was for my birthday treat,
and we received a complimentary free cake, and the staff took our photo and framed it.
so if u go on your birthday,they are pretty determined on making u feel special.. :)
if you are a food lover ,this is a place you should definitely visit..at least once..

Their kebabs are to die for which stops you from eating the main course much, but their Biriyani and mutton preps too are good! Their desserts are simply innovative and yummilicious!!

Been thre on Valentine's day '15...
Quite an innovative theme they put on. It was like a oceanic decoration and the  staves were all in pirate-attires with cranky and creepy big hats(missing on hooks though)! :p

Food was cool indeed with all those never ending starters! Bombay duck was delicious! so were the fish kebabs! 
After gulping so much of the starters main course was like stuffing our bellies with some more cotton balls just to do "paisa wasool" trick we all teens try to do and miserably fail (most of the times)! :p
And then came the starters, wow!  
Ice creams, hot gulab jamun, Brownies, cheese cakes, firni and so on...
Overall it's a nice place to hop into frequently! :)

An island of only foods. It's like you have foods all around. The best buffet in Kolkata without a doubt. 730 looks ordinary after that heavy meal. The starters are simply the best. The taste never gets over. And what a dessert platter. Perfect blend of a gastronomic course. Who needs a main course. A high five to this food paradise. The wait was worthwhile and would be coming more often. Schezwan fish is just yumm!!!

The name says it all!! Undoubtedly the best buffet in Kolkata in terms of food, ambience, price and everything. 
Well friends book your seats beforehand 'coz it remains totally full on almost all days! 
We were small group of 4girls.. and we relished our food for over 3 whole hours  with the courteous waiters ready to help at every moment!! 
Ambience- huge spacious place with comfortable seats and with live music performance in the background.. just sets the perfect mood for a grand dining experience. And the waiters were very polite and took care of every little things we wanted. The chief chef came to know opinions and also made a specially modified dish just the way we wanted it. 
Food- wide varieties of unlimited lipsmacking kebabs were served.. both veg and non veg! Out of this huge variety I loved the prawn kebabs the most.. and fish kebabs were equally awesome .. and all other kebabs were also good as expected.. the fried sweet corn needs a special mention.. it's delicious and something very unique. 
After this long series of kebabs we moved on to the main course (though our tummies were already 70% full!!!).. and here also an unbelievable variety of foods were arranged in style.. soups, biryani, oozy rice, chicken, mutton.. well, the list goes on.. I specially loved the palak corn in white sauce, the spicy mutton curry and fish kalia. Had to save some space for desserts, so couldn't try out the Chinese dishes.. 
then finally it was time for the tempting desserts.. beautiful appearances and equally tasty.. the butterscotch cheese cake was soft and smooth and had the perfect amount of sweetness.. we also had mud pastry, innumerable hot gulab jamuns, firni and icecreams. And at last we ended this awesome food journey with cold and sweet lovely looking kulfies! And returned back fully satisfied :)

Went there last Friday. The kebabs will make your taste buds flip! One of the best place for buffet in Kolkata. The yummylicious starters doesn't make the main course less appreciative. You can definitely gorge on the biriyani! The desserts are the best way to end the meal there. The service is brilliant! You practically don't even finish telling your orders and the food appears! A must visit for all.

How to go- Sec 5 SDF More,take the right lane beside Barista/ Subway. 1 mint. straight walk distance,you will find it on your right side.

Ambiance- Well decorated,cozy and have enough space. You will surely like it.

Staff- Friendly but stiff. When I asked for some particular dishes/kebabs ( specially prawns), they were taking time unnecessarily!

Food- kebabs were hot and good. But when it came to the particular One,like prawn,were unavailable. I hate asking for more again and again. Buffet were as usual good.
* Pros- fresh fruit salad, different types of coolfie and open grilled food section.

All good words for this one too..heard about this place since a long time and finally went in, and it did outdo my expectations.overall from the starters to the drinks,service and ambience, i would say, the money speaks for quantity , quality of food and all others.i wish to have more table reservation options, yet, for such a place of demand it can be expected that you can just hold a table over a phone call when people are queing for the entrance. I went to have a birthday occassion there and i was totally impressed by the complementary birthday cake and instant group photo they take and laminate and gift . A definite revisit and repeat.

Never restrict yourself when you are at BBQ Nation. We, a friends group went for the Sunday Buffet. Apart from prawns every item on the starter were awesome. On the main course we could not eat much, kofta "naramdil" and a chicken preparation "kuku paka" were among the best ones. Finally desserts proved why it has a consistent rating of 4.9.

Starting from ambience to courtesy all 5/5.
Food is tasty & yummy. Kabab was very good. I have never ate so tasty fish kabab yet . prawn chicken mutton kabab were also good . chicken tandoori is soft & tender .sweet baby corn was yummy.
In main course chicken dum biriyani along with plenty of salad with chicken & mutton preparations are also tasty , of course if you have enough space for it .
Dessert are excellent. Kesar kolfi along with ice cream and gulab jamun & pudding with various pastries are very good.
Definitely come here again.

Please call to check if seat is available beforehand else you might have to wait for hours. A lot of items to taste. The interiors are great. You can listen to music if you visit in the evening. The food is really awesome. You will love the deserts here. One of my favorite restaurants.

If you are really craving for good food and that too in good quantities ,then this is the place to be.I have never had so much food for such a price.Buffet is awesome.I have had nearly about 40-50 pieces of kebab!!!!!.And the type of meat that you get is chicken ,mutton,fish or prawn.You sit down to eat and you start of with their off the grill items,that is skewers having meat.And the skewers keep coming and they keep coming and they keep coming........ :) :) :)..After you finish of with their off the grill items then comes the items in the buffet.About 16 to 17 items on display. Murgh bagmati made me fall for it.I loved it.Then comes the desserts.Around 6-7 items -Cheese cake,anguri gulab jamun,phirnee,ice-cream with 3 -4 type of Hershey's syrup,brownies and kulfi.5-6 types of kulfi topped off with different toppings and may be 20-30 kinds of toppings....At last you have got a corner where you can get different kinds of fruits!!!!!Yes "FRUITS"...you read it right.

Their service was great and all that you get to hear are songs of Enrique Iglesias being played out......In a nutshell when you come out of it you are just going to say .."OOOOHHHH YEAAAAHHHHH"....Just go for it foodies.!!!!!

An amazing concept coupled with great interiors. Talking about the food, there is nothing you would Like to miss. This is one meal where you wished you had a larger appetite.
It starts from the starters and starters never end. There is a variety spread in deserts too ranging from baked items to sweets to ice-creams. The main course is worth mentioning at the +last. Not because its not as good, its just that your tummy refuses to accept more.
Talking about service, its the best in town. The items are replaced as soon as complained and the staff's courteousness would force you to visit again and again.

Again a suggestion from friends.. And I am not going to tell about what bbq natn served us... But what its food did to us... The amount of kebabs we ate as starters made us immobile for min 30mins post flagdown.. Each of us ate at least 45 kebabs per head and was still in need of more more.. Then came the main course for which we decide that we will visit another day ... Deserts were as excellent as the ambience with soft western music being played by an eminent singer.. Lastly we were thinking to tell the waiters to carry us out or at least help us to lift our ass from seat.. A must must go destination for every foodie

Chef gave us one veg and one non veg starter as a chef special starter which was not there in the menu which was really awesome... The best system is that u wl get a barbeque grill attached table where they use to serve the grilled items.. After having so much of starters u wl nt feel to hv the main course much... Deserts are really recommendable...!!

The fish kebab, chicken salad and cheesecake were my personal favourites. Come here. Enjoy the food. Feel contented. Go home.

Finally i made it to bbq nation last saturday on my anniversary.It was a special day for me which unfortunately did'nt turn out so good due to the lunch there.After all the rave reviews,we found the prawn and chicken kebabs to be quite stiff.Fish kebabs were good.In the main course we tried a few items which were good,but the biriyani was simply not acceptable.Loved the dessert section which saved the day.Overall service,ambience   is good.We had a prior reservation,so got the table on time.They even called next day for feedback which is a good & professional gesture.But i wish the food was that good as we had expected..wish i had listened to my sister's suggestion of going to Sigree global grill instead...üòê

Have been here for quite a few times and each time i get fancied by their new addition in there menu. A perfect place for any business party or personal hangouts,its has a live music ambience. The service here is also very good. It has a wide variety of mouth watering starters which includes tandoors and kababs. Main course is al bit low on side as compared to starters but it gets balanced by the range of deserts it serves. People having a balanced budget should definitely try this.

It is the last Sunday of June 2015. The rainy season is on and it was raining continuously. Still, BARBEQUE Nation is the name which tempt a foodie like me anytime. Hence, visited this place again with a lot of expectation. Since it's a Sunday afternoon, the place was crowded. I had to wait half an hour to get a table for two.

The first thing that stroke my mind is the background music quality that has improved since my last visit. The ambience is great and it does attract me a lot. 

The best thing is the service. I repeat 'the service'. One of the best I have experienced. The waiters are too friendly and fast. It's a pleasure to have food with such assistance.

A Sunday buffet lunch is the best I assume. There is a complimentary drink where you can take lime soda, cold drinks or beer. Then they set the grilling oven and the starters menu start. Believe me, they serve the best starter in town. Became a fan of the grilled fish, chicken, mushroom, prawn chicken tengri kebab and mutton kebab. Have them as much as you want till your satisfaction. There's also good starters for vegetarians. The GRILLED FISH is something that mesmerizes me.

Next is the main course section which is self serving. The BIRIYANI, MUTTON DUCKBANGLOW, CHICKEN SALAD, PASTA, CHICKEN MASALA, PAPAD, RAITA and some more were simply awesome.

The dessert section is a bliss. A blissful bliss. The CHEESECAKE is simply wow. The MIXED FRUIT TART, GULAB JAMUN, ZEBRA PASTRY, FIRNI, CHOCO MEL
ON CAKE are something you don't wanna miss. I will recommend to end the lunch with the delicious kulfi and ice cream.¬†
¬†

Well a full fledged lunch i must say. The cost is 730 bucks per person and it's complete "PAISA WASOOL". I strongly recommend this restaurant as it fulfills your every expectation and make you realize what a complete lunch/dinner is.

P.S Target the starters and dessert.  Don't give tips to waiter as it is not allowed.

The starters! Chicken,mutton,fish,tengri kabab,prawns,pineapple,mushroom,potatoes,paneer...u name it and you have it on the grill.
The main course is not too surprising with the usual biriyani,mutton,egg,etc.
The deserts! An awesome way to end the whole experience. Top notch chocolate pastries and cheesecake along with fruit tarts and customized kulfies to everyone's delight!

Finally got the coveted opportunity to tuck in at this Sector 5 eatery, unanimously hailed as one of the finest restaurants in Kolkata ... And well... enjoyed it to the fullest... ‚ò∫ Am gonna go for a specially detailed review for this one...
1. "Off the grill" items- Chicken satey and Bano tangri were great. But Burnt garlic basa (fish) was what really mesmerised me... Mutton birbali seekh kabab and tabuli prawns were ok. Chose the non veg menu but got complimentary veg items like Creamini mushroom with garlic paprika, Paneer naseman tikka. Again cajun spice potato and The small corns served were awesome.
2. "On the buffet" main course samples- Mutton Dak banglow, Murgh bagmati and dohi maach were tasty.
3. Desserts- Dont miss it. After delicious Angoori gulab jamun, Phirnee, Ice cream...they even have a separate Chef's recommendation corner for Kulfis which have their own combination recipes...
4. Ambience- Well...Addicted, Somebody's me and the entire Enrique collection was playing on the background. So I cant have any room for complaints. üòÄ The brick and wood decor is soft and soothening.
5. Service- This is probably where this restaurant is miles ahead than most others. The staff individually attend to the tables, take opinion about one's personal choices and likings and they even offer to mould their items and prepare some new ones... Complimentary beverages were offered to us. The 30 - 60 mins wait outside during lunch or dinner on weekends is unavoidable i guess... Also prior reservations cant be done.
Guys.. This is THE destination for a foodie in Kolkata. I strongly recommend it to everyone. :)

I have been longing to visit this place for quite long so finally made a plan with my bestie and visited today(Friday,26th Jun'15). It's an amazing place for eating out with friends as well as family. It's a lavishly spread buffet. Each and everything, be it the complimentary drink (includes beer),the mouth watering kebabs,the sumptuous main course or the treats to the sweet tooth is on a different level all together. If you guy's are looking out for buffet places then this can be "THE ONE". For a lunch it's recommended to reach there by 12.30 if you wanna avoid a queue.

Best place for office parties. They serve awesome buffet and the way they treat and greet customers is heavenly delightful.  Although their prices are going up much faster than is justified it only shows the growing demand of this place . In short their starters are not something to be missed you can compromise with the main course but do not leave an inch of your stomach vacant when it comes to the starters. Desserts and starters alone are a paisa wasool and the main course seems kike complimentary

I believe that this is the best place for buffet. The starters and dessert section are so good in taste.For that reason, I have visited this place 5-6 times within a year and I realized that the kebabs are not so tasty as early before. The taste of fish starter was really not so good as compare to earlier one. The chicken tengri kebab, also little bit dry. The mutton seekh kebab little bit harder I think. The main course little bit disappointed due to their taste. The biriyani taste are not so good and other dishes are rich in taste and some are not well cooked. But the dessert section is so good. The three flavors dip is provided with the vanilla ice cream. The fruits are refreshing and firni, tart, pudding, pastries all is good. The hot small gulab jamun also so good in taste.¬†
But after all this some little disappointed, It has no doubt that they are the best in Buffet section. Their way of serving, the flag down system, which is so unique and really awesome. The behavior of the waiters was so good and they happy to serve you more and more starters. And if you have some doubt in taste, they try to resolve it with a better one. When I asked for to much salty tengri kebab, they change it with less salty preparation. Again, when I feel that the black forest pastry are not like what they known for, the chef brings me the hot chocolate brownie which is not in the menu card. These are the positive thing I fell in here. Another thing is that This is the first restaurant I went where no tips is allowed to the waiters. We leave 100/- in the bill book, but the waiter returns it.

Overall good food. Nice ambiances. Good quantity. Stuffs are well behaved. I suggest all of you to visit there at least once.

This was one hell of an experience. I went there today with a friend. It was her birthday.  The food was amazing . To start with the starters. They were really really nice especially the Dijon fish. The hyderabadi chicken was yummy as well. The prawn preparation somehow we dint like. The hospitality was so great that the chef himself came to us asking as to why we dint like the preparation , taking down every aspect of our feedback. Now guess what. He told us "i am coming in a while with a new n separate preparation" . He did that and the next preparation he bought for us was so good. 
The deserts were great  as well. They even got a birthday cake for my friend. 
And the best thing. They took a pic of ours and in 5mins they gave us that pic laminated . This was one experience am never gonna forget. 
Thank you BBQ nation.

Umm kind of suffocative. Too crowdy. But worth it. We waited for an hour there were six teams before us. The ambience was okok not romantic but too loud. The man who was singing song was too annoying:/ as per as the light they should keep the music low for dinner and make it more romantic.

To the food the starter was good very tasty even the waiters ask you if you want more spicey or less and they will give you accordingly. Our first time and the waiters were very informative and polite. The main course started wd sweet sour corn soup which was wow and chicken biroyani mutton raita salads there were huge amount of food plenty but the dessert was awesome. Though I personally dont like brownies and the vanilla ice cream cakes were awesome mouth watering. The buffet was great. We took mango maza made with aam panna vodka was delicious. So over all its great will go there for lunch sometime for sure. Must try who haven't!!!!

The best thing about this place is that you can take your time... For starters,we had nonveg and veg items such as Cajun spiced potatoes, fish tikka, chicken drumstick, mutton seekh kebab and many more... They even customize your food according to your tastes...
The deserts are also worth mentioning like their live kulfi counter and their ice creams... Firni and gulab jamun too is good..

Every time I think of all the good places that I have eaten at, specially in Kolkata, I get tears in my eyes. Barbeque Nation doesn't top the list but it is easily number 3. I love this place. Even in Delhi. The quality is consistent. I have certain expectations about what I want. I am ALWAYS satisfied. And they have this feedback on a tablet thing. So cute. :)
Must try!

i have visited this place 12-15 times and for the vegetarian also they always come up with lots of different option. Always feel free to demand anything. i remember around 2 months back we requested them to make us a cheese mushroom , the chef immeditely came up with it in 15 minutes. this time in african festival we requested to make it red hot spicy mushroom and he came up with it. the cocktails were pretty descent and average. But the buffet is as usual pretty great.

Went there with my family..Had a great time and lovely experience...The starters are awesome specially the prawns..The best part is they go on serving the starters until you take your hands out of the plate.Coming to the main course,they serve really good biriyani. There are lots of other veg and non-veg items starting form salads to chicken and mutton dishes..Another best thing is the desert part..You cant go back home without having those hot anguri gulab jamuns even if u r full.the choco brownie,different type of cakes,pastries,fruits and the firniee is too good. They have now introduced 4 different flavors of kulfi.
Overall the place is nice,good ambiance,yummy food at low price.I suggest you to book your seats or you will have to wait outside..

Finally,I dropped in with 2 of my friends in the afternoon last monday (15.6.15).The buffet spread is extraordinary and they offer a complimentary beverage to go with it.Superb,fantastic,mind-blowing and I might run out of words. Service is spectacular. The food is amazing.The dessert section will make you go crazy. YOU MUST VISIT THIS PLACE! But if you are going for lunch,try to drop in within 12.30 otherwise you might have to wait in the queue for a long time.Take a bow barbeque nation...YOU ROCK!

I hit the place on First Friday of June. Luckily it was happy hour of Bar B Q and I have not to wait for a single second. And then start the food fest with the Bar B Q buffet. For starter there was so many types of Kababs. It make me crazy and I forget to down the flag.They continue to serve me the starters. So guys don't forget to bend the flag if you are complete the first serve of starters because there is lot more waiting for u in main course and dessert In main course I loved the biriyani and chicken preparation. the mutton preparation was a bit half cooked. As I was loaded with the starters i cut sort the main course and go for desserts. in dessert there was so many types of sweets, custards and cakes. I loved the cheese cake most and Hot Gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream scoop(Try this hot and cold combination it will be awesome)

Their hospitality and quality of food were not only great but also heart warming .The stuffs were so cordial and candid. 

Beside the charming ambiance there was two singers who entertain us with soft western musics. 

I will suggest all the lovers of Kolkata come on and visit the place with ur partner as It's a great place for a romantic date. 

Last but not the least the first restaurant i went where no tips is allowed to the waiters .

I have a tendency of having frequent 'meat cravings' and as the featuring tag of this place says, its one of the best place to satiate your cravings but not only for meat but fr awesome desserts as well. Firstly, prior reservation is highly recommended for this place as there is quite a rush from way before they start there service even. But no matter how long you get to wait the experience inside is worth the wait! They have a good spread of starters, both veg and non veg. The ones which stood out in my taste palate are: sweet corn, Thai ginger chicken soup, tangri kabab and prawn kababs! I didn't count how many soft and juicy prawns i wolfed down. The flavours n the soup was excellent, a very light yet pleasant aroma of ginger and some other lemon flavour was there. I was so full by the starters, couldn't dare to go for the main course buffet. Still just to experience the goodness hidden behind those closed-lid pots i opted for some chicken biriyani, fish kalia along with green salad and chicken salad. All had their unique taste and was worth taking. After taking some rest and making some more space to eat i went for their wide-spread dessert section. I had the best caramel custard here. The angoori gulab jamun ( small sized gulab jamun) served with vanilla icream and chocolate sauce was a sinful dish to die for. I was full till the brim of my throat but stil couldn't stop finishing that last piece of angoori..blissful!¬† In an all the food experience was exxtremely good and shall definitely come here again in some time.
A special thanks need to be given to the people who work there...such courteous people I have never found anywhere else. They will cme upto you and ask please tell us if you need anything...it made me feel am having food in some bengali marriage where the host is coming to tell "ja lagbe cheye neben, lojja korben na" (please ask for whatever you need, dont by shy)¬† Kudos to all the workers working so swift and hard to give us such a warm dining experience.

I have been here 2times. Both the time I had been overwhelmed by their behavior. The staffs are very courteous and soft spoken. They are welcoming and will make you feel better. Now coming to the food. The starters are awesome, my special favorites are prawn and fish kebabs. The kebabs are so tasty by the time you move to main course you will be almost full. Both the times I just had salads, dum biriyani and the  preparation of mutton. The mutton is well cooked and its very soft. I loved the mutton. In the desert counter not a single item should be missed. You will regret if you miss one. So plan accordingly. Fresh cut fruits are the best. If you have sweet tooth you will love the angoori gulab jamun. If you by chance don't like the taste of any food the chef will personally come and ask you the problem and prepare the food as per your suggestion. This type of courtesy you will   find rarely in any other restaurant.  As a whole this is the best in Kolkata. Reservations are required they are every day filled.

Firstly this place is for extremely foodie ones who can eat alot (not me). The best part of the food journey in bbq nation is the starters, they are so sooo good you won't feel like having the main course. Haha. M just sharing me and my friends experience. Second best thing is just pay and eat eat eat as much you can without thinking about the bill. And yes i loved the complementary drink it was refreshing. Main course was good too i just tasted everything because was so full with the starters. :P What else. It was perfect‚ô•

Hi ,

I went to Bar B Q nation yester day . I did not have reservation so got to wait for one hour , but after that the experience i have got is one of the best memory i have got in my foodie life .

Their hospitality and quality of food were not only great but also heart warming .

This is the first restaurant i went where no tips is allowed to the waiters .

I took buffet system . And quality of food as i mentioned before is unique . It is clearly shown that why this is one of the best restaurant in kolkata . Stuffs are well behaved and candid . Over all great experience . I suggest all of you to visit their at least once .

And one more thing i should say about an unique thing that is when you finish the starter there is a flag , you have to bend the stand of the flag down , a new concept to me .

Last but not the least want to thanks the owner and the stuffs for making yesterday's after noon special to me .

Hope this review helpful to all of you .

Thank you .

This is one place I love to visit. It is the house of one of the ¬†best buffet in Kolkata. I have been visiting this place since 2011 and every time it met my expectation. On my last visit I found some changes in dessert section, they have introduced a brand new kulfi kiosk along with muffins,mousse,sweets etc . I tried the Paan flavored ¬†and the Mango flavored kulfi, and both of them were awesome.The starters were as usual delightful but one thing observed that the size of the chicken and prawn became too small. Main courses are on par with few varieties in salad. ¬†But nonetheless it is value for money. ¬†Every season they are coming up with new dishes. Most importantly the service is one of the best in town and officials are very keen to maintain the same without any compromise.

I have been a customer of this shop for quite a long time. My association with this restaurant has been for long. Well I am writing a detailed review regarding the matter. True to it's name the restaurants specialty is it's starters that they serve. Well all of the starters are very appetizing and the quality is great. I have had no qualms regrading the quality. The food presentation is great. But like many other all you can eats the main course is the disappointment. After such good starters the main course does not suit the palate. On the brighter side the drinks and the salads are amazing. So is the dessert.¬†
So, if I have to rate it:
Presentation: 8.5/10
Quality:8/10
Ambiance: 8/10

Been here 'n' number of times. Been good always. Though you slowly start knowing the menu too well and can get monotonous thereafter. Anyway, if you want a good barbeque experience this has to be on your wish list! Lovely taste. Especially the prawns, fish and chicken barbeque. The mushroom, potato, crispy corn in the veg starters are worth trying as well. Not a fan of the mutton seekh kebab and the chicken drumstick.

In the main course, being a non vegetarian, having a piece of all items is a must do, knowing that you are already loaded with the starters ; )

In the sweet dishes section I loved the ice cream, mini gulab jamuns and the choco moose.

Un doubtedly the best place for buffet in kolkata. Located just near my office I have visited this place innumerable times. Be it a promotion party or a birthday we always select this place. The staffs are really well mannered and the food tastes awesome. I mainly concentrate on the kebabs as those are finger licking good. A must visit for all the foodies who are craving to have delicious kebabs. Not only the kebabs are good unlike most of the buffet serving restaurants the serve very good main course as well. And the dessert section is also worth mentioning. A big yes for anyone who wants to visit this place.

First of all 4.0 for the environment, but it was exciting earlier because their concept was new, but during my last few visits, their food quality has dropped a lot, the waiters will force you to take veg kababs no matter how much u dislike it, the number of preparations in the starter is few, the choice becomes narrower, earlier their main course was good but the way they have repeated it, and the way they maintain their quality is really poor.

Extremely good with outstanding staff courtesy. Me and my entire family enjoyed a splendid evening at Barbeque Nation at Sector-V last night,on the occasion of my parents anniversary.
Food was really good and the variety enormous. It is the same concept as Flame and Grill or Global Grill and hence the concept was not new to us.
Decor is plain and washroom is small,but the waiting queue outside is a sign of love,people have for this place.

If I am allowed nitpicking,then I would say a few things - AC was not very cool and with all those ovens and too many people,it was sweaty inside,and I had to ask them to make it cooler. Service was a tad bit slow,and we had to ask them to change plates or give water and things like that,repeatedly. Thirdly, getting a booking is bit painful. I almost gave them a miss,after they failed to answer my phone calls repeatedly. But fortunately,for a person called Debojyoti,who was extremely nice and courteous,we finally managed to have a great dinner. Debojyoti took a nice photograph of all of us and framed it at the end too !
Tabrez was a nice chap too from services.

They don't accept tips,in spite of repeatedly telling them to accept. Even the valet outside do not accept tips.

Well we dined out at the restaurant around three weeks back and the experience was enthralling..the service was quick and warm and we were served many more vegetarian options than was promised on the menu.. Aslo the restaurant was really busy and had customers waiting but they did not hurry us up inspite of the fact that we were eating at a really leisurely pace. One more thing worth mentioning was that the chef specially went up to each table to check on the taste of the food which did add a personal touch. Now, at the end while paying we tipped the waiters who politely declined saying that service charges were included in the bill.Even the guys bringing the cars at the valley service refused tips and said they were very content with their salary. The sort of hospitality experienced at this restaurant surpassed all expectations

I have been going to this place since it was born and it has never ever failed to please. Recommended for a Saturday dinner or a Sunday brunch the buffet offers you more than you can ever imagine of finishing off. For the record i have never ever had the main course. I just keep dunking one kebab after the other and soon when i am sated i move onto to the desserts! The kebabs are done to perfection although they also give you a grill to perfect them even more. The dessert section is also a section you should concentrate on as they have a wonderful spread from chocolate cakes to pudding to icecream to sweets. I have only heard stories of how good the main course is but never gotten around to trying it! If you want to go out for a date, a Saturday dinner is recommended but reserve your table in advance!

All though everyone knows about them... Undoubtedly one of the best buffet ... Awesome kebabs ... Love there veg starters as well specially the corn and mashed potato... Hell lot of variety in main course as well... Dessert section is also attractive.. I have tried their salads and soups as well.. Most of the people can not have everything available in the buffet... New introduction in the dessert section is Flavoured Kulfi... I do and will always recommend them to all the food lovers...

Note: One suggestion to the management from my side is : Please change the kebab recipes like in terms of flavour and new menu ... Specially the prawn , mutton and fish .. This may be I have been a hell lot of times here but I would look forward to this.

Today attended the Thai food festival .. And loved their Thai menu as well... The new prawn recipe and Thai style fish... New included in the buffet is crab in this food festival... Also pad Thai noodles and Thai style rice and red n green curry in chicken n fish items... All in all this food festival is worth a visit as alwys...

The best in town for buffet in town as of now and hope will retain its position for several coming years.

The range of starters, main course, sweet dish are really are worth to be praised.

However nowadays I feel if you are kebab lover and want to treat your taste bud with ample amount of kebab then I think such buffet restaurants are not the ideal place because as the quantity is huge here so sometimes the quality degrades.

Arrived at RDB Cinemas at 3.30 for a movie show of 4PM. While roaming around to kill extra 30 minutes in hand. Saw lots of people standing outside Barbeque Nation. Curiosity got better of me and I went there. They were not taking any new guests for Lunch and only the people who were in queue will be allowed to enter. For Dinner staff gave the details that if we enter before 7PM then we will be charged Rs.653 for Veg Dinner per person and Rs.750+ (Something I dont remember ) for entry after 7 PM. After we watched the movie came to Barbecue Nation at around 6.45 PM and the waiting had already started for dinner. We were given token number 21 and we were Number 5 in current queue. After 5 minutes we were provided with table.

The table we were provided was near AC and we were feeling the chill and asked staff to change seat for us. Staff was helpful and changed the seat for us. 

The restaurant served Buffet Menu and starters are served on table and Main Course and Desserts are to be self served from buffet.

We being vegetarians opted for Vegetarian Meals and details are provided as below.

Paan Kulfi-> Rabdi,Gulkand
Fig (Anjeer) Kulfi -> Caramel Sauce, Almond Flakes
Strawberry Kulfi-> Rabdi,Chocolate Vermicelli

We tasted all the starters and all of them were top notch in taste. Service was almost perfect. The servers were attentive and bringing back the starters for refill.¬† Only drawback was that we were not given drinks menu and we had to ask for it. 

We did not check all the main course items but what we tasted was very good and no complaints whatsoever. 

Desserts again were very good.

At the end staff took our photographs and printed it and gave it to us in a paper frame and envelope.

My personal favourites of the visit were Dahi ke Sholay, Spiced Grilled Pineapple, Pesto Mushroom, Almond n Brocolli Soup, Firnee, Fig Kulfi

We gave staff the tip and he refused saying they do not accept tips.

Few tips if you plan to visit this restaurant
Make prior reservations
Go on empty stomach or you may miss some of the delicious items.

Only Drawback, seats are close to each other and hence no privacy at all.

Well lets begin .. barbeque nation is really easy place to find as soon as you reach saltlake.. today i have been there with my best friend shreya and with someone i have recently developed a feelings within me...the sunday buffet was really an amazing one..both on and off the grill together together gives you absolutely a paisa wasool feeling at mere amount of 710 odd.i have been in buffets in quite a few resturaunts but i can assure you no other buffets in kolkata ranging within 1.5k will give you better experience.
If you think food and its price is the best thing then wait no...its their staff and service they have been the best staffs in any restaurants i have been in and trust me i have visited quite a few..we have ordered virgin mary apart from the buffet thing and since it took more than 15 mins 3 or 4 staff apologized for no reason then they felt it was not good enough and then they gave us blue lagoon for three of us without charging a penny and it was the nicest thing..ever i would rather give their service and staff a 10 on 5 ..if you are food lover go for it..it is the best buffet platter in the city at such a cheap price..

Not sure what it is that I can write about this place that hasn't already been written.. The current 4.9/5 rating says it all I guess! This is the go-to restaurant of my family for any occassion, and as such have been here more times than I can remember. The quality of the food and the service seems only to improve everytime I come here. Kudos to team Barbeque Nation!

PS: If there is anyone reading this review who loves North Indian cuisine and hasn't tried this place yet, I honestly don't know what you are waiting for. Go there with the highest of expectations and you won't be dissappointed. :)

This place is just heaven for non-veg lovers. With a grill on your table and the kebabs sizzling on it you can't stop drooling. From starters to the main course, everything is scrumptious.
The only problem I had to face is wait in queue for half an hour, so early booking should be done. But the food was worth the wait!

Its a great place for dinner, crowded at all times. The difficult part is booking a place for you in advance or waiting in queue to dine/lunch. The last thing you want when you are starving is to wait. But once you step in, the starters will blow your mind. always try the prawns. Main course is something i never caught upto as i always fill myself up to throat in starters. Deserts are lovely great gulab jamuns served hot and ice cream to top it.
What i never saw in my 4 years of visit here was innovation. The place accomodates the huge crazy fans like me, but i wished if it could expand or the interiors could have changed a bit. Well the place is always filled with foodies so when could they do the makeover i know that. 
A great and lovely place to hang with office mates and friends/family for dining/lunch.

I have visited this outlet quite a few times. And each time I have enjoyed thoroughly. 

The buffet is good. They have happy hours which is relatively less costly and you get the same experience. 

Starting from starter to desserts, each one is great. I am not a great fan of veg starters and I didn't find much verity but in non-veg buffet one gets starter prawn, fish, chicken, mutton and other red meats. 

Main course is on par but not up to mark if one is looking for mughal dishes. Apart from that salads and all are good. But starter itself will fill you up to the brink and you will end up just trying various dishes. 

But do save some space for desserts to treat yourself with ice creams, Bengali delicacies and other sweet dishes. 

If you are going with full gang of yours. Do visit this place.

It is very unfortunate for me that I have visited this great place only once, but with that single meeting I can blindly assure anybody this is the best buffet place in the city. On a fine Thursday evening we had our office dinner party here and went home with one of the most memorable eating experiences I have ever had. Full marks to all the wonderful mouth watering kebabs they serve. I loved the chicken leg and fish kebab the most. I was so occupied with the starters I skipped the main course, and thank god it was a good decision as I loved all the deserts they served. The yum mango cheese cake, the hot little ¬†gulab jamuns which can be combined perfectly with icecream, the kesar firni..every item was good. I will definitely visit this place soon and this time with family.

The restaurant opens up at 12:30pm while we reached at 12:45pm and still couldn't find a seat. We had to wait for 1.5 hours but it was worth all the waiting. The starters are the best you could possibly get- prawn, chicken, fish, seekh kebabs.. There are way too many dishes for a person to taste and most of them are marvellous. The soup was average but the desserts made up for it. The service is decent and the ambience is appreciably good. This is THE place for food in Kolkata.
Keep it up, guys!

Barbeque Nation serves, arguably the best buffet in town with a wide variety of starters amd desserts that will leave you spoilt for choices. A very spacious restaurant and yet you will have to book a table few days earlier to dine at this place...yes it is that popular!! And the waiters will leave no stone unturned to pamper you. The varied kebabs are the highlights of this place, each grilled to perfection and with their own unique taste. From fish kebab,chicken, prawn kebabs to lamb and even the sweet corn served at the very beginning will leave you raving for more and very soon, you find yourself full to the brim, with no appetite for the main course. Maybe this is the reason, their main course is a bit bland with limited choices to pick from. And also they serve only Indian cuisine! There is a lot of scope for improvement in the main course. However, coming to the desserts, here again Barbeque Nation wins you over effortlessly with their range of delectable desserts- fruit custard to butterscotch cheesecake, pineapple tart to gulab jamun, vanilla ice cream with generous toppings of chocolate sauce and mango sauce to firni and strawberry roll. Well..' A meal's well that ends well' and so you leave here, enriched with a complete and fulfilling dining experience only to count the days when you will be back here again.

Barbeque Nation is truly worthy of the 4.9 out of 5 rating that it has on Zomato. This place has set such a high benchmark regarding food quality, taste and service that I don't think any other restaurant in Kolkata will match up to its standards; basically Barbeque Nation has ruined all other restaurants in Kolkata for me.¬†

On a scale of five:
Food - 4.7
Ambience - 4.2
Service - 4.9

Almost everything that they serve is a treat for the taste buds. However, the following deserve a special mention:
Biryani - outstanding
Malai kofta - absolutely lip smackin' and finger licking good.¬†
Cream of almond and broccoli soup - has a rich smooth creamy texture and is delicious.¬†
Their luscious gulab jamuns topped with chocolate and vanilla icecream was heavenly; truly a 'yummy in my tummy' dessert!
Point to be noted - the icecream flavours were simple, just chocolate and vanilla and yet so delectable; their taste will linger in my memory for a really long time.¬†

Basically the overall experience was so INCREDIBLY AMAZING that pointing out the few little lapses feels like I am nitpicking and being over-fussy. Having said that, their range of kulfis and cheese cake do have scope for improvement.

Kudos to the chefs, servers and management of Barbeque Nation for providing such a phenomenal dining experience - your attitude is professional and at the same time very customer-centric; and this is a rare combination to be found in the restaurants of Kolkata.¬†
¬†
To the people who say that Barbeque Nation is pricey - buddy it's worth every penny and I challenge you to find another place in Kolkata that provides such a memorable experience in that price (parameters being quality, quantity & variety of food; service; ambience; overall experience).¬†

To the people who haven't been to Barbeque Nation - do go on an empty stomach. Ye log itna khilaate hai jaise koi mother-in-law apne jamai ko khilaati hai. :P

Well, the name says it all! I had gone to their Chennai outlets! Loved it! People from Bangalore and Kolkata also referred to this place as one of "the best" place to have buffet lunch/dinner in their city! I use to wonder how come this chain is at the top in almost all the cities of India where they have their presence! And yesterday while having dinner at their Kolkata (Sector 5) outlet I came to know why! Besides the food, which is just amazing, the management is extremely customer-centric !! They are there to help you, to take feed back from you, to listen to your criticism and act upon it immediately so that you have an wonderful experience! They are extremely proactive and professional! To sum it up they are there to make sure have a wonder dinning experience!

We went for a team dinner yesterday at this place.Interior is nicely done with lots of sitting arrangements. A small stage at the center,two guys rocking the ambio with soothing English oldies. A kulfi counter at one side. Open kitchen separated by glass, where you can see the cooks doing what they do best! And of course the delicacies - the buffet items by one side!¬†

Food wise a great experience. 4-5 kinds of Kababs- Chicken, mutton, prawn, fish! In between they serve these amazing continental dishes of baby corn and potato and tangri kabab. The flag, situated in the table is the marker that you want more. They will keep on serving it you put the flag down! One after Another round of Kababs!! The main course, I would have to say that the Chennai outlets had better options! Well, this one was good but not at per with their starters and desserts quality. The mutton dish had more bones than meat! Yes! The desert section indeed was splendid! Puddings, firni, cut fruits, anguri jamoon, ice creams, 2-3 kinds of pastries! And the best - the kulfi counter where you can order your own kulfi the way you want it!¬†

We had a bit of confusion at the start as we were told that a complementary drink is included, but when we arrived there we came to know that its there only during lunch! We had a talk with one of the managers and requested for the drink as they charge more in dinner than in lunch! Though at first they denied, which made us a little dejected, the manger later came and apologized and served us with our choice of complementary drink. :) ¬†This kind of customer-centric attitude is what has made this chain the best in the country! Extremely polite and helpful staffs!¬†
An exquisite experience again with satisfied tummy and mind! Best place to have a team lunch as well as ¬†family dinner.
Highly recommended!
Keep up the good work guys!¬†

Well its time to write my 100th review on ZOMATO and it can't be more apt than to write it for my favourite Buffet Joint in Kolkata..This has indeed been a Boon for foodies in Kolkata..the ultimate buffet lunch joint and perhaps the most popular and decorated one too..Well I believe everything abouth this place has already been mentioned over the years but what still attracts me after visiting this place for zillion times is their Superlative service..Honestly speaking I have never experienced more impeccable,more professional service in any other restuarant in kolkata..its jus t super fast..even before you finish all the skewers in your grill they will come up with renewed helpings of their lip-smacking kebabs..Everytime we visit this place we become so full with Kebabs that we literally had any place for Mains..though being a sweet tooth myself I always overeat in their desert section cause its just out of the world..The best assortment of starters and deserts..Period..Also love the concept of using the flag as an indicator to serve your starters..love the dips and condiments served on table..Only major flaw is the waiting time which is usually annoying and the quality of their Main course dishes which is yet to stand up to the benchmarks set by their kebabs and deserts..By the end of the meal we barely able to pick ourself up each time and feel content to the core..

The frst time i went barbeque nation i ended up goin there every weekend for two months ! The best thing about barbeque nation is that the staffs are ready to serveee anything you want ! 
Once we were servd kebabs that were not properly cookd ... but the bbq nation team were sooo apologetic they gav us two complimentary dishes n a drink to make us feel bttr , on a weekend that i went there was no cheesecake in the menu somehow the servr figured that we wantd a cheesecake and brought us a biggg plate of freshly made cheese cake! 
The third time i went was a weekend , generally i would say one should try to visit in weekdays as the menu is bttr and variety is much more compared to weekend! 
Long live bbqnation!!

Barbeque Nation Kolkata serves pure 'dil khush kardene wala' food.But its the starters and the deserts that steals the show.Though a hard core non-veg I loved the veg starters as well and they were perfect bliss.If you have a sweet tooth its a paradise for you...deserts are to die for.Main course is good but not excellent..overall its one of the best place in kolkata to have a meal...though the price a little on the higher side...but its worth it

Well finally I get this opportunity to write a review about bbq nation and I will start by saying that the place was somehow able to satisfy my test buds really well. The starters were really good each barbecue tasted different than the other and the speed at which I was served was great and also they were really clever in serving food. You will be full before you can reach the main course and thus allowing them to be a little less adventurous when it comes to main course. Even though they had a wide variety of food in the main course but nothing tasted special as because your senses would still be captive about the flurry of starters which you had. I was disappointed by the lack of taste in the main course but the dessert made up for it. From gulab jamun to the kulfi everything was brilliantly prepared and thus when you leave the joint you will be more than happy. You will forget about the flaws in their main course and you will more than satisfied. The fish and the prawn barbecues needs a special mention while the gulab jamun in the end tasted like heaven. Rightly said that "All is well when it ends well". They are a really smart bunch of people running the fabulous food joint.

What can I say about Barbeque Nation, this place never fails to impress me. Incredibly succulent barbecues. But what separates it from other similar places is the fact that each dish has its own unique taste. Not every dish on the barbecue platter tastes the same, which happens to be a very common occurrence in places like Flame & Grill and the like. My personal favourites happen to be the prawn, mushroom and fish barbecues and the potato salad or something-like-that that they serve at the beginning. The desserts are almost impeccable. Though I didn't quite like the double chocolate cheese cake as much as I had thought I would like it, but nonetheless the phirnee and tart compensated for that. Mango and strawberry kulfis are worth trying out. A little pricey, yes, but worth every penny.

A mecca for FOOd LOVERS.... Starting from the food to the service and ending on to the ambience everything is just awesome. It's an ultimate spread beacons.  
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ It is something where you get the best of service, the staffs taking care of your choices keeping track on your plates whenever you are finishing with the kebabs getting some more. A must RECOMMENDED place. Even you feel pampered when the staffs are bringing meats to be cooked with your choice of spices
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ now this is a place where you will be spoiled with choices. The large varieties of kebabs to eat chicken, tangri kebab,prawn, mutton, seafood, fish, etc. even the sweet corn that they provided was really nice. But if you're a veggie no wonder but there's also a huge list of starters that will galore you. Mushroom kebabs, pineapple kebabs, paneer kebab, potato kebabs. Mexican potato fries, Swiss roll, crispy baby corn, french fries, crispy paneer, etc. Now talking about the salad there were more than 5 options to choose from. Waldrof salad was a thick creamy one with potatoes cheese and mayonnaise chicken salad and seafood salad was something I liked green salad is something which everyone have tasted nothing to say about it. Lettuce salad was Colourful fresh food salad tasted really nice. Now coming to the main course it wasn't something special..! 

The chicken dum biriyani was well prepeared but it wasn't something very delicious methi chicken was light and tasty. Mutton Dak bunglow was a good filler. Macher kaliya wasn't something that went with the former dishes but was well cooked. 
The dessert part was huge cookies, brownies, kulfis (various flavours), ice creams, cakes, gulab jamuns and last but not the least strawberry cheesecake was just awesome... 

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Must say the staff is brilliant out here taking care of each and everything you need. Not even once we felt out of place. Their hospitality and such fineness did the staff executed. I would like to give up myself to this deliciousness again and again

First time had a buffet, the too with live barbeque. The starters were awesome, be it paneer tikka, veg kababs or crispy corns. 
The main course was North Indian Cusine consisting of Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala, Mix Vegetables, Nan, Zeera Rice, Dal Fry, and Biryani(veg) and all were the usual ones nothing special about.
But the variety on the desserts counter were amazing, consisting of Brownie, Firni, Tarts, Mini Gulab Jamun, Jalebi and Vanilla Icecream.
The ambiance and the service were both upto the mark.

Barbeque nation,the name says it all. It's the home of great barbeque food. Went there with my 8 frnz n we had the best time. Lets review it now
Ambience: Very proper for buffet arrangement. Very spacious with good seating arrangement
Food: Barbeque is amazing but the main course is bland and needs urgent improvement. The dessert section is good but need more indian variants.
Service: Prompt n very quick. The waiters are very polite and attentive.
Overall a total thumbs up and I totally recommend it.
P.S: The wifi needs some real boosting if the management is reading this.

The food is awesome and the servicing is jusf out of the world .the hospitality is really good nd they ensure that they pamper you till the time you say the word ' that all guys, no more '. It was a very special day and went with my girl to celebrate and came out with a extra filled stomach  and excessive satisfaction.

Currently there is no better place than this chain restaurant to enjoy barbecued and kebab meat n fish. 
The buffet is too sumptuous to ignore. Leave aside the taste and quality of the food which is world class but one thing which i want to point is BN really wants to caters for its customers. Unlimited buffet is really unlimited, they will keep on serving untill u drop dead of exhaustion of eating. They dont accept any tips watsoever. They with their evry step try to keep up tgeir standards which is a very imp thing. 
Kudos to BN. I have rated 4.5 coz there is alwyz a room for improvement ;)

INSANE is the word. Loved everything about this place. The staff is excellent and courteous. From the way they welcome you, serve you and till your last bite, they have a broad smile on their face. With the entire restaurant full on a Wednesday night, they served you right on time without any reminder for the same. The ambience , decor and live music fetches it more brownie points. Talking about the food: excellent spread for vegetarians too. Served almost 10 starters and all of them had excellent taste. The desserts were also brilliant with almost 10 types of desserts which were served. One thing which can be improved is their main course. It is good but does not match the expectations which the starters build in the beginning. This place is a must visit.

A great place to come and eat to your heart's delight.. The non-veg items include all types of sea food(fish, shrimp etc) , and meat (chicken and mutton). The preparations are delicious and the ambience is superb. And to top it all, it's a buffet!! So, eat as much as u can! The staff are good as well and the chef even specially prepared a chicken kebab just because i was unhappy with the variety of kebabs. Keep up the good work BBQ nation!!

I love their buffet spread. It is totally worth every penny spent. The starters are amazing not only in taste but variety too. This place gave me my first taste of shark- yes they had that too. This is one of the finest places for prawn and crab kebabs. Such a wide spread is pretty unusual. The general trend is to skip the main course after such a heavy buffet, but if you do it here, your loss entirely.Their main spread is equally diverse, from Biriyani to pasta to Sorshe fish. Do give it a try. I shouldn't start with their desserts, I am afraid I will never finish. Whatever you do, keep some space left for this. In short, you should possibly just reach as soon as it opens and eat on till evening if you want to enjoy it all. Please reserve a table, few lucky ones finally get a space at the correct time and nothing more disappointing than planning to eat here and then to settle for something else.

The complementary dishes are quite tasty as well as the starters.the main courses are a bit of hit-n-miss but do try the desserts.  
In short, It tastes good when you are giving treat but it tastes exquisite when you are on the receiving end.

Any time, Any day - Is a BBQ nation day. Doesn't matter how they keep on increasing the price, you would again and again go and wait for hours to get a seat over there. Many people now a days say that BBQ nation has become monotonous as their food variety is not at per with the expectation. But believe me, you actually don't expect much variations in the starter Kababs, tangri, prawn - you expect variety in main course and you put the blame as your stomach is already loaded with the huge starters and almost there is no space left to drop the main course.¬†
There must be very few people in kolkata who have not tried the buffet at BBQ nation. However, for a foodie, it's a mustttt go, anytime. And if you haven't been there ever, just close your eyes and drop in. Rest assured!!

Good range of kebabs and food.But the buffet tends to be over priced at times and kebabs are a bit too dry and lack the quality and execution. Being someone from the hospitality industry i would say that their buffet menu's should be revised, as i have eaten here quite a few times and have seen the same items bein repeated.

Barbeque Nations! The mecca for food lovers, specially buffet lovers! Located in the RDB Boulevard, this place has been in my dreams like forever and when the chance came, I didnt even hesitate once to try it out.¬†

We didnt have to wait at all as we were early birds, being there by 12 noon. We were showed our seats just by the actual kitchen and then food drama began.¬†

We opted for nog -veg buffet, all of us. We were served our welcome drinks... there was a long list there too, to choose from: pinacolada, lime soda, blue lagoon, beer and several others.¬†

The various sauces and garnishes were placed in our tables for enjoying the delicacies as we wanted them.¬†

The servings began then. The buffet included chicken grills, mutton kebabs, chicken tengri kebabs, prawn grills, pineapple roasts, paneer grills, fish and a lot more. And what set Nations apart from all other buffet restaurants is that you never have to ask or keep waiting for the next serve. The waiters themselves are too eager to serve you more and ensure that you can keep enjoying the delicacies without any time or interest lag.

We could hardly keep a tab of how many servings of each we gulped down before decided to try out the main course. The fish, prawns and the tengri became my favs and I really enjoyed many of them before going on to the main course.¬†

In the main course, I tried out dum biriyani, two other chicken preparations, chicken salad, eggplant salad, seafood salad and green salad. The sea food salad and the dum biriyani were my best choices. Wish I could have more Dum Biriyani but I was so full already... :)

From the desserts section I chose firni, fruit custard, caramel cakes, choco tart and icecreams. The caramel cakes and the choco tart were my favorites.... Yummy!

And then was the best part of the buffet! The kulfi buffet... Imagine... Kulfi... various types and yet on a buffet. I enjoyed two servings each of pan, kesar pista and malai but the best was the pan kulfi... You ought love it... the taste of pan in cold kulfi wrapped in tasty pan masala ---- a whole new approach. Simply loved it.¬†

About the staff, they are really very friendly and the chef even interacts directly with the diners for direct communication. Pretty good!¬†

And the cost? Well, you will be amazed! As we lunched during the happy hours, we were charged less than 500/- per buffet! OMG, totally unbelievable.

I had been to Barbeque Nation on the 12th of May for the weekday lunch buffet. First of all let me solve the FAQs
1. Location: Get down at SDF bus stop at Sector V, Salt Lake and walk for 2 minutes to reach the place. Its situated on the ground floor of RDB Cinemas between CCD and Chai Break. 
2. Cost: The weekday lunch buffet (Non veg) costs 690/- per person inclusive of all taxes. This includes unlimited food and any ONE drink. 
3. Reservation : You must reserve a table 4 days prior to your visit for complete assurance. 60% of the tables are alloted for booking while the rest 40% are on the basis of 'first come first serve'. Anyways, if you reach the place by 12 noon, you'll definitely get a seat. Otherwise you'll have to wait for the people to have their food and get out before you can enter. That happens usually from 1:30 PM. If you're on the second batch, you'll definitely find a seat. 
4. Food : You'll get a choice of any one drink among a Kingfisher Beer pint, mango panna, fresh lime soda, soft drinks. Now the Starters. They serve a wide range of kebabs on ur table over the grill. These include a chicken kebab, a prawn kebab, a fish kebab, a mixed veg kebab and a paneer kebab. The rest of the starters that they serve on ur plate are chicken drumstick, mutton seekh kebab, cajum spicy potato, a fried veg item and baby corn. All of them are tasty and they'll I continue to serve u till u put the flag down which indicates that u don't wanna have any more starters. 
Coming to the main course, it's on the buffet and you'll have to serve yourself. This includes a wide range of salads, 2 soups, rice, dal, a potato item, a mixed shaag, chicken biriyani, katla fish, a mutton item, a chicken item and and and I can't remember. :P
And finally the desserts, you've a wide choice. Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce, a chocolate cake, butterscotch cheese cake, custard, phirni, fresh cut fruits and my favourite 'Hot Angoori Gulab Jamun'. And they have a separate kulfi counter where you'll get a wide range of kulfis of upto 6 flavours and 20 toppings I guess. All of them included in the buffet. :) 
... 
Final review : I guess it's the best place to go and have your food with ur loved ones. The waiters are very very well behaved and you'll feel at home. The management is spot on and you won't find any sort of hustle and bustle going on. The food is tasty. The ambience is brilliant. What else do you need? It's not a one time visit. It's a place to visit whenever you can. It's brilliant. No wonder it's rated 4.9 on Zomato. Thumbs up for Barbeque Nation.

The unlimited spread beckons! In the true sense. Getting inside is a big challenge though. You have to sit in benches in the sweltering heat. Not only that, you have to watch people eating several delicacies from the outside stalls and elsewhere but you wouldn't¬† be able to go ahead and get some for your growling tummy. All because of the name Barbeque Nation.

Then, all of a sudden a gleam of hope builds up your confidence and brings you back to your senses. Some people actually coming out in bits and pieces, with a stagger suggesting they are either dead tired or zombies. You figure out that they are simply like overfed anacondas, unable to move and writhing in pain to move their muscles that aid mobility after a end-of-the-earth meal. And then, in you step!
Surprise surpise and more surpise! The aroma of charcoal burnt food tantalizes your appettite and then the decor steals your heart away. Add to that a live counter with a glass wall where you can actually see the items on your plate being made.
A treat for the sore eyes. And then when the first stack of skewers arrive, you jump in with optimism and wonder if this were actually your last meal.
¬†"How could God be so kind to me?" you think to yourself remembering that there are still, people crowding outside like you, waiting for a glimpse of the wonders inside. None of the patrons who enter the den once, leave any earlier than a couple of hours. So you feel bad but the ubiquitous selfish human in you tells you to keep digging in, skewer after skewer before you know that the sound in your tummy is from being fed up to the brim. You then pull down the flag like the nation has gone in mourning and proceed to the main course hesitantly.
A glance outside and you think you are the lucky one and maybe utter some words of gratitude to the Almighty. Perhaps, a prayer for the ones waiting outside like you were, an hour ago. Alright an hour has passed, and you are still brewing over the starters.:P
¬†A little biryani and the usual dal-chawal fare and some salads adding to the international appeal and a few koftas later you decide to move on the the heaven in inset.
Desserts! Ahhha...icecreams aplenty and gulabjamuns and some tarts later you decide to give the oft appraised pan kulfi a try. You sit with the overflowing plates promising not to get up again and call it a day. But you do exactly the opposite and get up again choosing a plethora of items to your hearts' content that makes you feel guilty but brings in pleasure at the same time. Finally, you cant talk and the server understands that you are done, presenting you with the paltry amount that put you in this heavenly spot. Too much effort to fetch the card from the wallet and when you finally get up to sign the receipt, you realize that its already been a good three and a half hours since you had arrived. such is the magananimity of this chain that its almost the same anywhere.

When you finally get out of the door, you get a glimpse of maybe a dozen more YOUs standing, sitting or running around precisely in the same fashion that you had been, a three and a half hours ago. Do they get to enter the den and experience the heaven that you just did? Well, they are not driven away but just promised that their fate will be decided in a while.The gates are still open :P While you spare a thought for them, they are actually thinking the same about you. Dead-tired zombie, tummy full anaconda walking with a slight imbalance and try as hard as you might, your body simply cant straighten itself up! You just glabber your way to your ride and wriggle in like the anaconda to get out of there before the people rip you apart with their glances and glare. Better luck next time for them and you sign off promising to come again and again.

P.S. A 0.5 deduction from the perfect figure because of the poor crowd management. You have to be always going in and coming out to know your current status or chances of getting a table. The management should get a small screen fixed outside showing the status against the¬† names. Makes things easier and offer the patrons a soft drink/juice(a kind gesture) for those waiting in the sultry weather.

A paradise for non vegetarian people out there for sure but being a vegan you won't go home very disappointed, there are tons of starters to choose from and they even provide off menu on request which I personally liked very much. 
Options in main course is pretty limited but u won't be needing it after having those juicy starters and watching mouthwatering desserts lined up for u. 
So in short if u r a grill lover or have a sweet tooth its a place to be or else avoid. (Try global grill instead)

The king of buffets in Kolkata!

 If the phrase "eat till you die" has any physical meaning, then that would be barbeq nation! They provide the largest variety of starters among all the buffets in kolkata. The main attraction here are starters and they are damn tasty. Main course and deserts are good too. Buffet is costly though, but totally worth. I have actually seen people vomiting outside because they consumed too much food. A true paradise for food lovers!!

Finally, after months of planning and cancellations we were able to finally visit the legendary Barbeque Nation. We had to make resrvations for 7 people on Sunday to get seats on Friday. Well, the journey was a hectic one but the good news is that Barbeque Nation is opening a branch at Park Street, how cool is that?

We reached there by 11 am in the morning. We sat on the outside benches for 1 hour and we slowly observed that a small crowd was building up slowly, we were lucky that we had reserved our seats.

Now, they opened the door at 11.55 am and invited the customers who had prior resrvations. We were directed to our table. The decor was breathtakingly beautiful and the ambience was awesome.

The waiters asked for our preferences, veg or non-veg, and we decided for non-veg. They gave us the choices for the complimentary drinks. I ordered Mountain Dew, and the rest ordered Soda Lime, barring one who ordered Beer. Our complimentary drinks, portable grill for the kebabs arrived. They served us for sweet corn first and that was the tastiest start to a plethora of starters.. The sweet corn was so tasty that I took it for like 7 times. Now the kebas arrived, aahhh, the aroma of exquisitely cooked kebabs made my mouth water. First came the fish kebabs and they were delicious,I had 8 sheeks of fish kebabs. Then came the Chicken tikka kebabs which were equally delicious,had lots of them as well. The Chicken tangri kebab was good and the mutton kebab was a hit. We also took Paneer and Mushroom kebab, they were delicious as well.

Then we went for the main course. I took a little bit of everything. I loved their mutton rogan josh, biryani,katla macher kalia etc. Their huge array of salads impressed me, the hawaiian chicken salad was the tastiest of the lot.

Then came the dessert part. The view of a wide array of desserts in front of me was a dream come true. The cheese cake was a let down amd the opera cake was too dry. The angoori gulab jamun, the chocolate tart, the ice cream took my heart away. I had 9 tarts, 13 gulab jamuns and one huge scoop of ice cream. Lastly, i had their pan kulfi, which was yummy. After the meal I had to sit for 15 minutes before I could walk again. The waiters were very well mannered and polite. I am definitely going back here again.

Being a Bengali, I have a fetish for sweets and they fulfilled my every desire starting from Rosogollas to payes. Ice creams are tasty too.

On the ground floor of RDB Boulevard, this place has made a name for itself as far North Indian buffets are concerned, in the last few years. Make sure you have a reservation or you might need to wait for an hour, even on a weekday afternoon.¬†They're particularly good at kebabs. They start off with complimentary drinks. We took the beer and a fresh lime soda It's one complimentary drink per person. Then they start off with the kebabs. Their prawn kebabs are incredible, though not often cleaned properly. So if you have an allergy, be a little cautious about the prawn. The mutton sheekh kebab and the fish and chicken kebabs were particularly nice. You can also order naan of your own choice at the table to go with the kebabs, though I wouldn't recommend it, since it becomes too dry.¬†After the heavenly skewers, comes the main course with soup, followed a range of veg items that we completely skipped over. The laal maas (mutton). chicken and fish preparations were again to die for, though not as good as the kebabs. And since most people fill up on the unlimited kebabs, the main course isn't much of an attraction. The Biryani is extremely mediocre and you might want to skip it altogether. The desserts are again what makes this place so good. They have rabri, walnut cake, ice cream of your choice of flavours and of course their tiny gulab jamuns which are perfect to finish off a heavenly meal.¬†I would say go for the kebabs, fill yourself up, take a customary bite off the main course and then head straight for the dessert.

This is the 3rd time we've went for team lunch at here. This particular outlet will never disappoint u. Simply blown over. The starters which include malai prawn,drumsticks,chicken kebabs,mutton serkh kebab,corn,potato etc were enough to fill ur tummy. In main course,Chicken Biryani and mutton rogan josh with chicken n seafood salad were too yummy. I've always been a fan of varieties of desert. The firni,cheesecake,gulab jamun n especially the Pan kulfi was very tasty.

‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫ dis was d first tym a resto reservation was made on my name!!!! Haha!! Nd dat also for 7ppl!!felt reaaallly gooood!! 
Had to call on monday to get a booking for friday!!! So u can easily guess the demand!!! 
Yes of course we took d non veg lunch buffet... And yes the price 690/head is tax inclusive!. And the early bird offer is only valid from mon to thurs. 
The food was good. Not fingerlicking. But good. This is more of an unlimited food for extremely hungry ppl. And please dont have more dan u can manage!!! (else u will end up throwing up almost everything u had just after entering home. Lyk some of my buddies n me!!! ??)
After gobbling a mountain full of non veg starters and putting the flag down i felt the urge to have mushroom n paneer kababs!!! Nd to my surprise they brought them!!! Dat was so sweet!!! 
A particular yoghurt dip was high in demand!!! We kept on asking for numerous refills which was done with a big smile! Finally the cute guy got us a HUGE bowl of the dip!!! My goodness!!! These ppl do know how to pamper their Customers!! 
The fresh lime soda was awesome!! 
The mutton pieces, cheese cake and opera cake thoroughly dissapointed me.
But wateva went happily inside my stomach was worth wayyy more than 690!!
My first buffet experience at a resto was awesome. Nd my sweetheart buddies made it memorable!! ??

This place doesnt need any more review bt still just sharing my awesome experience there. This is the only place i visited so far had no flaws from there part. From the food to the hospitality to the ambiance and the comfortable seating arrangement this place did impress me a lot. We went in a group of 7 and the experience was mind blowing. From the awesm spread some of the things which i gorged upon were tangri kebab, chicken satay, roganjosh, chicken salad, the gulab jamun,phirne, and ofcourse the kulfis which had options from malai to kesar pista and even pan flavour. Amazing overall. Totally satisfied from there part.

Kolkata Barbeque Nation had always eluded me for a long time but finally went there today and was not disappointed. a typical early bird lunch buffet which consisted of an array of delicacies.
For starters, they presented with a variety of kebabs chicken, fish, prawns, drumsticks, corn, mushrooms, mutton seekh and pineapples. If you have not tried the pineapple roast here you missed out. 
After such filling starters, came the main course. Lots of salad options chicken and seafood included. Biriyani, mutton rogan josh was mostly what i stressed on.
Deserts were amazing from brownies, fruits, tarts, cheesecakes, firni, a selection of kulfi and gulab jamun with ice cream with add ons chocolate sauce and strawberries.

A super filling lunch at a decent costing, with excellent food. i give it 4.5/5

Love this place. Very nice food within a very affordable price.  Their food, Chef, manager everything is very organised. Everything is just fine, but what I feel is the number items in their starter menu is a little less in Kolkata. I have been to Barbeque Nation in 5 different cities, in each of them each time I went they had  tried a new item in their starters except in Kolkata. So I would like to suggest them to introduce something new every week to their starter's menu and keep it changing every week. But I also must say that they improve their main course considerably.

Concentrate on starters and desserts rather than main coarse. The tastes are awsome. i would definitely visit many times more. Do try the excellet kulfis and ice creams.. :)

First of all I thought it will good like rest of the restaurants but after the barbeque started to been served my thoughts changed having so many menu in that price is really worthy. Each and every  item tastes awesome. But only one thing for which I was disappointed is that the drink served was not unlimited only one time it is free. Else every thing was really nice. Do try if anyone is planning for it.

As usual they have maintained the standards . Just not the starters, even the main courses boast of awesome taste . However was pleasantly surprised with their innovation in Desert menu. The pan and chocolate kulfi deserves special mention. However the biggest strength of the Restaurant is in the courteousness of their staff.

Awesome dining experience. The food was delicious. The kebabs were finger licking good spcly d prawn kebabs, fish hariyali kebabs an d chicken kebabs.though we opted fr d nonveg buffet, they also served us crispy sweet corn and some sort of potato kebabs with sour cream (which were left untouched).i came here with a friend (spcl one).we did not have to wait at all though it is a vry busy place.d welcome drink was refreshing. We did nt try all d main courses, just a little bit of dum biriyani and laal mash , sea food salad and papad. D desserts left us speechless(literally speaking as our mouths were full with those sweet delicacies). Every dessert worth a second serve ( may be 3rd, forth or as many as ur stomach can accomodate).i specially liked their mango pastry and vanilla ice cream with 3 kinda syrups (strawberry,mango and chocolate).we tried 3 kinds of kulfi (pan,kesar pesta and nuts with choco chips). The waiter was friendly and served us with a smile all d time. Yes we r definately coming back soon

Ps. The cheery on the top is they maintain a no tips policy

Yes I would like to reevaluate them.it was my 3rd visit there.went there to celebrate my aunt's birthday. But unlike the first experience they disappointed me big time.they started serving slowly and I don't know after serving 2 times ,why did they keep asking whether we want more before we downed our flag.its a buffet right???and u guys maintain a flag down service..then why asking?? Unlike first time they served less and yes we had to ask repeatedly to serve us d chicken kebabs and prawn kebabs.in fact they served us so slow that I decided not to wait for d chicken kebab and headed towards d main course. Barbeque nation is my favorite restaurant and I don't like to write anything negative about it. BTW d complementary birthday cake was a very sweet gesture which was highly appreciated by us.

We had been here on the occasion of our 30th marriage anniversary. The buffet platter was simply awesome. Following the welcome drink, assorted kebabs were served in skewers. The prawn & tengri kebabs were real hits. The galauti kebab, however, was a bit chewy . The Bombay duck was perfectly barbequed. We were at a loss to choose from main course dishes. The sushi was delicious. Prawn biriyani & chicken gravy items,along with some seafood items were delightful. The small,cute hot gulab jamuns rounded off our lunch.
As a very nice gesture, B N staffs served a spl anniversary cake for us. Finally, we must praise the service, which was efficient & cordial.

For people craving for tandoors and meat dishes at a reasonable price, this is a good place to go as you can just hog at a fixed price buffet. The starters are so heavy that you tend to get totally filled for the main dishes. The prawn and fish tandoors I like more than the chicken or the sheek kebabs. But don't miss the Mutton Biryani in the main dish - so do keep some space in your tummies.

If you would like to test your appetite, this is the place you wana hit. This place had got us to come back to back days. Surely tested our appetite. My first visit to a live charcoal barbq kinda restro. Had veg all the time. And each time they surprised us with something or the other. From their starters to the main course to the desserts you would want to eat more ans more and more. this place has the best varieties of starters. Babycorn, bread kebab, mushroom, paneer, aloo and the fruit kebab simply outstanding. Had a whiskey hazlenut cocktail which also was pretty amazing. You would be left no room for main course after the starters. Main course not bad though, but youll have very small portions of it rather just to taste. Each time had something different with the desserts. Though ice cream gulab jamun and pastries ans fruits are the common ones. Love the chocolate sponge pastry. Had loads of them. And if u love gulab jamun n ice cream, pour some ice cream over the gulab jamun. Amazing experience.... Perfect for hoggers.... ????

This is a paradise for people who can keep eating for the duration of two football matches. Non-stop. :P

Its important that you keep your appetite to its maximum when you reach this place because the mouth-watering kebabs and their endlessness will keep you mesmerised. And you'll regret that you couldn't grab some more. The prawn kebabs are most delicious but so are the rest! 
There's a sumptuous main course too, but I don't remember having it even once, because once you're done with your fill of the unlimited kebabs, you feel you could go without any edible stuff for the next 2 months. :)
Highly recommended for amazing staff behaviour, decor and of course...inexhaustible kebabs at their delicious best. :)

For being their one of the most frequently visiting customer will show my eagerness to taste their foods. well i find it for a good buffet in the town with a moderate pinch in the pocket . they offer you so many varieties on the table and also some customisable dishes that are off the menu on request of customers. this is what i liked about them, listening to customers choice and jovial nature of their staffs.¬†

coming to food it tastes really good , specially to mention their dahi kebab, chicken drumsticks, biriyani in the main course, cheese cakes in the desserts. you people have really made me njoy d food along your bands playing soothing musics , a great combo and a really value for money deal. But i'll suggest you to deviate a bit from the usual menu , which though you keep changing but is turning out to be more or less same. so kindly brings some radical changes in tastes and variety by introducing new cuisines frequently.

one of the best buffet i had. ¬†The starters are really good, especially the PRAWN along with the crispy corns. You can have as many u want till u are tired. I find the main course normal not too good but anyhow after the starters no1 can dig into it fully ¬†till you are tooooo hungry. Then comes the best part of the meal for me- the deserts, the gulab jamuns are small bombs of taste, it melts in ur mouth. Even the firnis are good. The kulfi section is a experimental box, do try pan kulfi.. its inventively tasty!!
No doubt the service is good. :-)

I'm giving 3.5 only because my expectation was very high for Barbeque Nation but the starters for what it is fomous was a big dissapointment. Two week ago I went for team lunch. The size of the kebabs they served can be viewed under magnifying glass properly. The same is applicable for both chicken , Prawn. And the service was bit slow. Taste was not upto mark.
For Main course it is ok ok type. I just want to tell for veg-people very less options are there. Crab was very good and fish item was also very good. Biriyani was average in taste.
Desert section was bit fine compare to starters and main course. Firni, Muffins, hot gulab jamun with ice cream all were peerfect. But the custard was pathetic. One thing which impressed me a lot was the coolfie corner. You can get different types of coolfies in this live counter. Don't forget to taste kessar Malai coolfie and pan-flavoured coolfie. Ambience was good also. So my overall experience was ok but not upto mark.

This place was in my wishlist from a long time.I finally visited it on the valentines day.We had to wait for a long time due to the long queue but our wait was worth it.Firstly i was quite impressed by it's beautiful decor n ambience n the staffs were very cordial .Now comes the food,the kebabs were too good more than i expected with 3 dips.We had prawn,chicken,fish,mutton kebabs,tangri chicken.They gave us beer as complementary drink,they had other options too like fresh lime soda n cold drinks.There was a sea food festival going on that time so they gave different types of fish n those were very tasty.In main course they had many varieties of dishes starting from breads,rice,prawn cocktail,chicken,fish,veg,salads and many more things.I loved their deserts.There was dark chocolate pastry,cheese cake,pudding,gulab jamun,firni,ice creams and many more.The best part of the deserts were the kulfis.They had 5 flavours of kulfi,I tried the paan flavoured one n I just loved it.They gave us a heart shaped cake n 2 beautiful roses because it was valentines day.The best part was when the chef personally asked us how the food was.I loved the homely environment.They don't take tips.The place is easy to locate.It's just beside the Infinity tank in sector V.I would love to visit this place again n again.Totally in love with this place.

Pretty good diner, the waiting time was a bit too long, couldn't book a table beforehand. Food quality was impressive, but when it comes to taste, I've tasted better main-course items. The starters were nice to munch on. The ambience was good. The desert was really good. Overall, the experience was better than most places I've dined in. A few nicks here and there, but you would be pretty happy with what you get.

Had been planning to go to barbeque nation for a very long time. The wait was worth it! Very delicious starters, just a delight for non-vegetarians. The main course was not up to the mark, but the kulfi counter and desserts just make it up for you. Overall, a very good place to have food. But, the main course really needs to be improved.

Very nice place which i have tried from last 3 years but kolkata branch is also good one ..
Must try this place . In kolkata i have never had such wonderful and delicious food and starters and kulfi counter which attracted me the most . Like we make our own yoghurt even like that you can make your own kulfi flavor with different toppings ????????????????

"this place serves the best kebab starters in the town". Thats it, the review is over.

What is good : 
1. Good selection of non veg kebabs and other non veg starters. 
2. Awesome dessert spread.
3. Good service
4. Happy hours at a reduced price (mon - friday, entry by 12:30 pm)
5. Nice crowd, vibrant ambiance.

What is not so good :
1. The price -- very much on the higher side. 
2. Average main course.
3. Long waiting times.

The place is very good, but a bit over-hyped. Fine dining does not mean eating more than one can digest, and most people do that to make the cost worthwhile. Most of the diners are guests of people throwing parties and are from the neighboring IT hub. Hence a lot of people who would otherwise not go there, just want to eat like there's no tomorrow. Nice to watch though. Once inside, you got to feel for the chicken !!!! :)

Their extensive buffet is their main selling point. Best place to enjoy a quick meal before or after a movie at RDB. Staff are very friendly and helpful even if you go for the buffet. Not sure about vegetarian, but the non-veg food here is really top-notch

EVERY restaurant joint SHOULD learn courtesy and etiquette from Barbeque Nation. Hats off to the person behind the training of its staff. I have been to multiple outlets in different cities (mumbai, bangalore & kolkata) and each time I am impressed with the staff. They are so so so polite and they make you feel so good. They genuinely serve you and force you to try different starters thats out of the menu. I have always tried 2-3 starters besides those on the menu and its all been awesome.

The concept, the quality everything is amazing. The starters are so good that you might not have space for the main course. There are always so many variety that you are spoilt for choice.¬†

I took my parents and my sister, they were experiencing this concept for the first time, and they simply loved it.¬†

The main course isn't that great but then you are so full with the delicious starters that you don't really look forward to the main course.
The desserts are sometimes good and sometimes average.¬†

The price they charge is worth the spread they provide. Definitely the best buffet place. A must visit on days when you feel like hogging to the point that you can't even walk!

So visited here today. As they have a african festival going on. The starters for the most part were good except for the paneer which was a bit undercooked. However upon mentioning it. The chef himself came to our table apologised and changed the dish. The prawns fish and mushroom starters were mouth watering good. The grilled lychee innovative and different. However the main course as always left much to be desired. Ive mentioned the same to the staff there on my earlier visits. Yes they are known for their grilled straters. Doesnt mean they ignore the main course. There was nothing in it which would save this course. And i wonder what is african themed about the biryani singapore noodles and butter masala paneer. Coming to dessert it was again average. Was very excited to try the kulfi counter which had 6 different flavours and various toppings. However the kulfis all tasted powdery and weird. And again nothing african themed in the gulab jamun cheesecake firni or kulfis. 
The huge pro in this place is the courteous and friendly staff. Our server kept checking after every course if the food was to our liking or not. And that was very pleasing
The other pro as ive mentioned were the starters. 
Coming to the cons. Too many. For starters. Almost nothing african themed about the african festival. Calling a particular dish moroccan african etc doesnt change its taste. Next as ive already mentioned the disappointing main course and dessert. 
Please buck up guys!

Best place for lunch and dinner in Kolkata. Worth every penny. Food is indeed delicious ,apart from the ambience you wouldn't complain about this place,really liked chicken , fish but mutton could have been better .starter is so good at this place u wouldn't be eating main course. And lastly desert which mainly comprises of gulaab jamun and ice cream which is better than most of the places in Kolkata.i would suggest to give this place a chance , you will be leaving satisfied.

There's absolutely no way you are leaving this place dissatisfied! You go in, you sit back and relax and there is every kind of braai is brought at your plate! A hardcore non-veg like me ended up having the corn braai the most! #wow Every bloody one was amazing, the mutton and prawn braai topping the list! Don't bother yourself with the main dishes on the buffet, stick to the braai! Desserts might be given a shot!¬†
Now, a little incident, I had ordered a mocktail, which wasn't much to my liking! As I was discussing this with Mum, a waiter seemed to have heard it, and then the Mixologist came out to talk to me! On knowing my dislike, he actually apologized and I ended up getting complementary drinks which tasted incredible!¬†
The ambiance could be a little cozy,with dimmer lighting! Don't even think of paying tips, it's returned,our's was!
overall, I'd give it a #ThumpsUp #WillVisitAgain #Foodie

Had visited this place on a friend's birthday and it turned out to be an amazing experience. We opted for Veg (unfortunately for me) as most of them were vegetarians. Overall experience was overwhelming. Though the grill makes one feel hot if kept for a long time as you just can't get over with starters, and the main course: its a history by the time you are done with the starters. Waiting for the next time to hog on the devilicious Non Veg starters. Who cares about the main course ?

My first experience in Barbeque Nation was during pujo and after that it became one of my favourite places to eat at Kolkata. They have lots of starters and by lots, I mean so many varieties of veg and non veg both that you can be full without even touching the main course so make sure you save some space for the main course. As I am more of a starters fan, I tried all of them and EACH was sumptuous and had THE PERFECT taste. I did not try the main course much but my family did and they loved it. The desserts section also has a lot of varieties with mouth watering pastries, pies and sweets. Also, they serve one free complimentary drink of your choice. The day I went, they had organized a karaoke and it was beautiful.
Over all, my experience with them was amazing. The staff is very friendly too. Also, there is a cook who will make you a dish that you want if it is not in the menu. I would definitely recommend it. Amazing place and most importantly, pocket friendly :)

Surely best buffet in the city... Starting from the starters to desserts, everything was delicious... In starters , not only the nonveg kebabs, potato cebab and sweet crons were awesome.... They serve almost 16 starters, which I think no other buffet restaurant serves in this city... Though there are varieties of option in complimentary drinks, I will suggest not to order beer at all, its better to have any cold drinks or fresh lime soda with the starter... In the main course I liked the biriyani and the crab very much... Cheese mango cake was best among the desserts... The service was excellent.., I have never seen and cook to come and ask the customer about the quality of food in any restaurant in Kolkata before... There is no question about the ambience... We will surely go again...
And to our surprise they gave a discount (charged 475 tax/ meal) as we were 1st customer of the day...
It was an awesome experience....

And after having the buffet...we came to the conclusion that we just had the best buffet in Kolkata..surely!! Located at the ground floor of rdb boulevard..it is a heaven for the kebab lovers. Everything was so perfect..from the starters..to the main course...even the desserts...aahh..evrything was so lipsmacking...and I ate more than I could manage. Among the appetizers...the crispy corn..and potato kebabs were so delicious! The main course had a lot of variations. The hot gulaab jamuns and the pan kulfi deserve a special mention. The manner of the staff was very courteous and helpful. Overall the whole experience was a class apart. Looking forward to come here again.

Quality of main course not upto the mark except mutton biriyani. But you have to get chicken curry, fish item, crab and mutton. And for sweet you have get long items with ice cream. And most loveable kulfi (several types) also get here. Awesome lunch for us. Best bbq for kolkata. @Sandeep Karmakar

Located at the ground floor of rdb boulevard barbeque nation is a heaven for kebab lovers. I have been to this place twice and both the times my experience has been amazing. It is undoubtedly the best restaurant in town for lipsmacking grilled kebabs and I just cant get enough of them. The hospitality and decor of this place is of top notch. The gestures and manner of the staff are extremely courteous and helpful. Seriously,nothing negative comes to my mind while thinking of their food. The kebabs be it the veggie,the fruits,the chicken,the crab are all equally delicious and yummy. However my personal favourite are the prawn kebabs and the mutton kebabs. They just taste divine. Everytime while in this place, I hog upon the starters so badly that there is very little room left for the main course and the delicious deserts. The main courses served here are average in taste,but the starters preceding it and the deserts after that are so perfectly brilliant that one can just overlook this small glitch. The deserts here are like the perfect end note to a beautiful performance.The ice cream,the gulabjamuns,the cheesecake,the fresh cut fruits and last but the best the phirnee are all a royal treat to the taste buds.The buffet charges around 700but the quality of food here is worth every penny.To put it together,this is the best place for an exquisite and lavish dining experience. It is exclusive and a class apart!!!Looking forward to visit here again very soon.

An amazing experience. Good food, proper service and a nice ambience. The kebabs were nice and juicy and they kept coming non-stop. :P
At one point there was a mountain of kebabs in front of my friends and i and we felt like we demolished an entire colony of prawns on our own. :D
Moving on to the main course; fresh and well cooked food. Only disappointment was the fish( which seemed to taste like "macher jhol" to us) and the mutton( not enough meaty pieces, mostly bones).
Then came dessert... it was pure blissful heaven! From the gulab jamuns to the variety of pastries to the firni and the most awaited kulfi bar!! We were in sweet tooth heaven! 
At the end of 3.5 hours of gorging in deliciousness, we simply couldn't move. :P
Overall...a reasonable price of 590/- (early bird offer  12:00-12:30) for a fabulous and hearty meal.

This was the place that I had been wanting to go for a long time!! Their buffet spread was extremely good and had a lot of variations. Among the appetizers the ones I liked best were the crispy corn,the potato kababs and the  mutton kebab. I found the lamb a little undercooked. Then from the main course to the desserts everything was lipsmacking and I ate more than I could manage. The hot gulabjamuns that they serve in the dessert section deserve a special mention. Another thing about this place that touched me was that the employees refused the tip that we had played them saying that they already charge a tax for their services! Every restaurant should do this for a good and long lasting customer relationship! I would say its a must visit for anyone with a love for north Indian cuisine especially the different assortment of kebabs!!

The food is delicious and the service is best as per the
reputation. Recently the Kulfi festival they celebrated was worth. If still I have
to make some black spots, it will be for spicy taste for Mutton Kolhapuri. As I
was non-vege, I could not suggest for veg people. One thing is sure i.e. this
place is worth for the money.

The 4.9 average rating (as of 12.04.2015) conveys everything that you need to know about this place. So it's better I do not say anything new about the food. All you need to know is that Barbeque Nation offers the most satisfying buffet in town!

However, I would like to add a few items in applause to the restaurant, which might not have come up in the existing reviews, as much as they should.

Valet Parking : The last couple of times we visited Barbeque Nation, it was a pleasant surprise to note the availability of valet parking at the facility. This offered us the most refreshing welcome, amidst the heavy traffic and evening crowd of Sector 5. And of course, as per the tradition of this place, the valet parking facility was Free of Charge!

Staff Behaviour : The first time we visited Barbeque Nation (a couple of years back), it was a truly remarkable experience to watch our host return the tip amount from the bill-book, thanking us for our generosity, and politely refusing the tip as per their no-tipping policy. Henceforth, it became a habit for us to receive similar cordial hospitality, and exceptional service, every time we visited this restaurant.

Warm Hospitality : Once, we had an amazing salad at the salad bar on the buffet -- the prime ingredient being eggplants. It was so unique that we discussed the taste and recipe with our host on service. He informed us that he did not know the recipe, but would try to know it from the chef. In about 5 minutes, the chef himself came out to our table, and explained the details of the salad recipe. I did never experience this kind of hospitality in similar restaurants across Kolkata.

Please keep up the good work!

Let me tell you .. this place is super awesome!!! I wonder if anyone would have visited this place and have a bad review about it! Because they have everything and anything !!! If you want to make your weekend perfect and grilled food happens to be your favorite, This is definitely a "there you go" restaurant!!! They serve you with the tastiest¬† starters... and you can have it as much as you want !!! Just make sure... you still have some space left¬† for the main course !!! And I think by the time one is done with main course ,it takes them quite some time to stand up and move up to get there dessert!! But the dessert is HEAVEN!!! There is not a single dish I didn't like ! A place to visit this weekend if you want amazing food and I must tell¬† you might need 2-3 visits of the place ... to taste each and every dish ! You see ...they have such a wide variety!!

If u ask me Best Buffet Lunch in Kolkata Right Now it is here. Its a Foodie Paradise. 
These people make Damn Good Kebabs. Starters are Endless (till u flag Down). 
Ya its Pocket Friendly. I went at least 5 times with my Friends. And we didn't flag down Starter for 90minutes. They keep changing Equally Good Main Course & Dessert Menu Regularly. And the Bar man in that Little Bar is A Expert. If u are regular he knows u by face. Everytime he ask me "Sir usual?" Me be like "Surprise me!"
BTW 10% if regular patrons are Medical College (College Strt) People.

Barbeque Nation. The name says it all. 
One of my friend told me about this place. Truth be told,I didn't expect much from this place. But when I had the starters, I completely went berserk. It was out of the world. Kebabs were just mouth-watering. 
Prawns were also delicious. Ambience was quite good. Service was 5 out of 5. It's a bit expensive but the food and service will surely make it up for you. 

Lastly I still couldn't figure out how can they serve so much of prawn at such a reasonable rate. It's been a different adventure here. You should atleast try this place once if not more than that. I assure that you would come with a big tummy and a happy face.

Update : after the park Street branch opened i mostly go there bcz the fd and service is much btr,today i had to come here,it was a long wait though i had an reservation,then kababs are good always,the service was oky not the best,then main course is getting worse day by day, desserts fail to attract as kulfis and gulabjamuns are the only thing worth eating.

But we had a good time.pls look into the taste of the items more.

I have been to Barbeque Nation 4 times till, 3 was in kolkata. Each time the place amazes me. My first visit to BBQ nation was in 2010 in Mumbai, dont remember particulars but I was spell bounded by the kebabs. It was extremely delicious. In 2014, went to sec V outlet 3 times. The last time, they had "Pat Chapman" food festival going, they had 5-6 special items. The deserts and the kebabs of Barbeque Nation are something out of the world. Those outshines the main course. The best thing about the place is, they really consider the feedbacks seriously. During one visit, being asked I told the chef "biriyani is very light,the flavor is missing", I think that's the case with almost every one. But surprisingly, the chef came back after 10 min with some extremely delicious biriyani but alas i was too stuffed! It's been 5 months, oh GOD! I miss the place..
I have decided when I will get a job, I will make sure that I visit Barbeque Nation atleast once a month if once a week at all not possible.

Bar B Q nation needs no introduction when it comes to excellent food & staff! 
The kebabs are beyond excellent, service is top notch main course extensive and desserts are amazing.
There is also a Kulfi festival going on - and amazing assorted kulfis are being served, starting from pan flavoured ones to strawberry flavoured ones. 
This is the first time I visited this place in Calcutta and there's a good reason why this place remains packed even on weekdays!! 
Please keep up the good service! There are very few places in Calcutta where starting from starters to desserts every dish is just so perfect especially in a buffet! Please keep up the good service! Can't wait for my next visit!!

Barbeque nation = Awesome food !!! 
It is the food heaven for grill food lovers. Starters r awesome so is the main course and variety of dessert is also very good. The new special addiction is the kulfi counter which is just the cherry on the top of a cake. I tried all the favors which they had to offer and the pan flavored kulfi is the best.

I cannot give less than a 5 to this place...it's the best restaurant i have been to...the food..the behavior of the staff makes you wanna go there again and again...
The starters are fantastic...nicely grilled prawns,chicken and fish...and the best thing is they serve tangri kebab...
The staff will make sure u never sit idle...they will ask u about the food and keep bringing starters till u get tired...it's like dining at your friend's or a relative's place...the main course is okayish...deserts are awesome...
Whatever this place serves is worth every penny

Well it was another day of venturing out to eat after reading a lot of reviews mostly positive ones. So I set off to experience the "stay hungry for two days and come here" place. The ambience was not over hyped. Owing to the fact that I went on a holiday, the place was pretty crowded. I had to wait for at least half an hour, (they had said 2 and a half), before my friend and me were placed in a table for two right near the kitchen. The kebabs were rolled out and yes it does justice to the hype. They were tasty and since they were coming up like rain, over and over again, the same flavors in the taste bud, it couldn't get better. After stuffing myself as much as I could, mostly with the prawn kebabs and fish kebabs.I decided to skip the main course, as my smart friend was doing, gobbling up the dessert. But my greedy stomach urged me to move to the buffet. It was NORMAL. Nothing out of the world. The biryani was ordinary, the pasta well horrible, and the meat and fish, just OK. The sight of my friend deliciously gulping the dessert, once more made me ignore the plea of my already over worked stomach. So I picked a plate and went over. I am not much of a dessert lover. But I did pick up the pie, a gulab jamun, firni and some fruits. The firni was truly awesome. I am pretty sure all of u must be wondering how come I was able to walk after all this. Well I did reach home and slept like a log. So for BBQ Nation here is the deal. Awesome starters, awesome desserts, in between is your greed. Be smart, unless you want to test the limits of your stomach. For if thy eats here thy commits a sin of gluttony of food and pleasure of sleep.

I guess this is what they call a perfect restaurant. The best Kebabs that i have ever eaten. Even though I am a hardcore non - vegetarian, the Aloo Cajun( maybe my spelling is wrong ) is my favorite dish. The buffet is okay, but they do lack a bit of variety ( that is totally compensated with the starters ).¬†
There was this Kulfi counter, I don't know if it was permanent ( I hope it is ), the varieties there were insane. You should definitely try the paan flavored Kulfi ( let them make it as it is, even if you don't like dressings on kulfi, try it just as they make it ).
The ambience couldn't be better.

The price seems a bit in excess( at first ), but it is totally worth it.
Would Definitely Recommend it.

Cheers. :)

Its an amazing place to party with your friends.
All the starters are awesome.
The starters consist of prawns, chicken, mutton,masroom. corn and potato...each of them are equally good. If u want ur food more spicy they serve all as u wish. I went to Barbeque Nation for lunch and dinner with my friends. The buffet with unlimited starters was opted for, and the staff served us the starters (mainly kebabs) at the table. The main course was okay. Then in desserts we had gulab jamun, choco mousse,ice cream,pine apple cake,kulfi. My god! I was literally full after having the starters.¬†
¬†I would love to visit this place again.

People definitely love this place which can be seen in any Sunday. I would recommend you to reserve a table before a day or two. Hospitality of this place is awesome and I haven't seen such in any place in Kolkata. You must go for this buffet. Food quality is brilliant and definitely deserves a 5 star.

Barbeque nations (sec-v) is the best place for Kolkata foodies. I just love to be in this place. Spend two hours here staffing your stomach and you can literally forget about all the worries of the world. Been here multiple times and the last being on 04/03/2015 for lunch. Somehow found that they don't mmmmm maintain the place properly. There is a couch which has torn cover and they are yet to replace it. Unfortunately we got that table only. They have added a live kulfi counter recently and it is great as usual. They did not have any special dish these days due to heavy rush. As the waiter informed in near future the food items will be revised. So my tips is to taste the best food line up Kolkata till date at least once before it gets changed for better . 
-- Update---
Yesterday again visited here for dinner and found the torn covers for couches are gone. Felt real good. The food is, like always, awesome. Pure Joy. :)

We go here for our office parties, it's Barbeque so food will be the awesome as expected I think I have gained weight partly coz of this only. We are kinda regular here coz whenever there is any event in office we end up coming here only. I have been to Barbeque in Mumbai as well I was kinda regular there as well for again same reason :P but the kind of service I got in Mumbai is not there in Kolkata but I am comparing it with the best so still this is good enough. Starters is what you have when you go to Barbeque and that's what's best here but compared to Mumbai options limited , then I personally jump into desserts directly which again is good but again options limited. I am a hard core Non Vegi but I loved the veg here so if u don't mind having veg which I do u will rather enjoy here more than me :P but nice place and I won't say I will love to go back there again coz I know we will end up going there again and again by default as a matter of fact coming Monday :P for lunch. I would have given it a full star but just compared to Mumbai I don't consider it to be up to that standard which is actually very high :)

I would say that I had the worst experience ever in my life at Barbeque nation. Went there for a treat with friends (after travelling for 4 hours), and we had a booking for 6:30 pm. Since we were struck in traffic so we called them and told them that we'll be late by an hour or so, so they told us that it would be totally fine and they'll keep our table reserved. But luckily, we reached there by 7pm only, but we go there only to find out that they have already released our table( and that too without even informing us) and now they can't accommodate us. So we, talked to their Reception Manager and told him the whole situation and that the guy on the reception told us that they'll keep our table reserved, but that stupid Manager and his receptionist inspite of apologizing to us or finding a solution to our problem, started shouting on us. The way he was talking was so rude and insulting. I dont even know who made him the Manager of a restaurant. Then this third guy comes, supposedly he was on a higher position than this stupid Reception Manager. So he was a bit calmer and we again told him everything so he ASSURED us that they'll give us a table in between 8:30 to 9 pm. So we were waiting outside the restaurant then suddenly after around 15-20 minutes, we thought that we'll go inside and ask the receptionist to do put our booking in their register, but then we find out that the guy who ASSURED us that they'll give us the table FOR SURE( and who was the General Manager of the Restaurant) says that he doesnt know anything and I have to talk to reception manager only,  and who says that he WONT(not Cant) give us a table before 10pm ( and the closing time is 10:45 pm) and the way those goons were talking was really intolerable. Then eventually we had to find an another place for dinner. 

After being such a reputed chain restaurant , I dont know how Barbeque Nation have such an arrogant and rude staff. First of all they dont provide us a table even after a prior reservation and then they talk like this. And what they say that we dont care that if we lose a customer and we dont have to respect our customer and blah blah. I have been to restaurants, big and small, but have never seen such a behavior. I think one think that a person seeks at a restaurant, other than food, of course, is good hospitality and BBQ Nation has severely failed on that one, no matter how good is their food.

In a nutshell, I would say WORST Customer service ever. But, for us, in a way it was good that it happened with us, because after that we ended up going to Afraa, which had the amazing food, service and ambiance. :)

Barbeque Nation is one of the best restaurant in city of its kind. Located in the IT hub of the city attracting the young crowd of the city.
Ambiance is quite good, so is service.
Regarding food, the kebabs are just finger licking. About 5-6 types of kebabs are served that includes chicken, fish, mutton and prawn. Don't forget to get the salads from the buffet table to complement with the kebabs. I don't think many people keep enough space in stomach to try the main courses. So didn't I during any of my visits. The desserts are again awesome with 7-8 varieties including fruits, pastries, cheese cakes, mousse, sweetmeats, ice creams. Do not forget to try your favorite flavor of ice cream at the ice cream counter.
Its worth visiting again.

Amazing , now n always. Whenever I visit this place, I get satisfied by super food. The fact that the staff's are really courteous also add to the good points. The tengri kebab, this time, was not upto the mark. When they were informed the same, they presented us with freshly prepared tengri kebab with some modification in the receipt, which turned out to be mind blowing. Also another special chicken kebab was presented to us , which was quite different. The fact that they are always trying to outperform themselves also fascinates me. They have, recently, added a new dessert to their already varied menu - the Indian kulfi, in 8 flavours and lots of toppings to choose from. The kesar pesta n mango ones were fantastic but the paan flavoured one, I ddnt like.

No amount of good reviews can be enough for Barbeque Nation! Even though I've tried their restaurants in other cities, the one in Calcutta, Sector 5 Salt Lake was an especially good experience.

We went there for a birthday celebration, and the staff went out of their way to ensure that we had a gala time. Food was up to the mark, and the chef's specials were indeed very special! Live music made the evening better.

Was floored by their spread of desserts - especially their "make your own kulfi" counter! Would highly recommend it.

Barbeque nation is to buffet as.... Picasso is to paintings, Mozart is to music, Einstein is to science and Shakespeare is to literature.
I couldn't find the apt adjective to describe this place, but I hope my analogies will suffice.

I have been here 6-7 times in the past two years, and every time this place has given me more than what I could ever imagine out of a buffet.
This is simply a one of a kind adventure which every mortal must experience atleast once in their lifetime if not more. If you have never been here, go now!

Located at the groundfloor of RDB cinemas. Went with my friends @ 12 and was surprised to see it flooded with so many people contending for their chance to get a table. Luckily we got the table in next 5 minutes.

Coming to the food, the starter kebabs were mind-boggling. They tasted like ambrosia...I dont even remember how many sticks of kebab platter did i guped down into my stomach...

The buffet was above average... But again it was compensated by the desert... Anguri gulaabjamun were amazing..!! It was over 1st visit and definitely will come again..

Just a small suggestion... Pls keep a soft drink at the end of the meal as it soothes and helps to feel light. Thank you. :-)

From the moment we stepped into this place till the time we left, it was a truly brilliant experience. First and foremost, I would like to say that I rarely faced such an interactive and hospitable staff. ¬†Eating food at a place where your opinions are taken into account and worked upon makes it a great experience. A small example, one of the fish starters was not up to the mark, so I requested the server to see if something can be done. The manager came and asked us what sort of taste we would prefer for the starter. After 10 minutes, the server came with the fish item, which was really better than what was served to us at first.¬†

Coming to the food quality, I have to admit that having eaten at a lot of buffets in Kolkata, this is by far the best I have had. The starters are excellent in taste (both veg and non-veg). People should go to this place for the sheer quality of the starters alone. The main course, even though pretty limited, is good enough to satisfy yourself. The dessert section deserves special mention, as the Gulab Jamun and the baked items were great. AND, if you ever make it here, DO NOT MISS OUT on the paan kulfi, which is just out of the world.

In the end, we were really satisfied with the ambience, quality and hospitality of the place and the value for money. We would definitely visit this place and recommend this place as ¬†MUST-VISIT.

In one word it's simply awesome. Be it food , hospitality, service everything was perfect. Starters are amazing. Though number of nonveg main course items are less in compare to large variety of starters but they tastes nice. Desserts are brilliant, but the show stealer is paan kulfi. They give complimentary beer too. Isn't it amazing? They just made our day. ^_^

I hav been to this place several time.. .. the place is just perfect for the ones who love to eat.. grills are awesome... though I would say main course is not that good.. but sweet corn will take your salivary glands to their maximum excited state... desert is awesome (I had 18 firnis myself)..ambience is also beautiful and service is also good.. though I would say that the guy with karoke has a shitty voice..but leave that if you want to eat a lot just go there....

It was my birthday treat to my friends. I wanted it to be special and it was, it realy was. The starters had lots of bar-b-q, fish , pron ,vegetables, mutton , chicken & fried sweet corn. I thought i wouldnt be able have the main cource because i had too much of the starters.
The main cource included mutton biriany chicken kasa two different preperation of fish and the desert.....well that was a different experiance all over. Cakes , gulad jamun and and what ever you can think of, ice cream included.
When i was eating there i practically had the feeling of being at a mediterranean beach, then when i moved to the main cource i felt like i was in north bengal & the desert was proper kolkatta, they surprised me with a birtday cake at the end and sang a birthday song for me. Ofcorse we could not finish it, but it was a pleasent surprise.
Loved the ambience , the people, the service and i hope to go back there again and again with more friends and famely

Well, been there only once. The quality they serve is not something that I can call "unparallel". But, definitely quite good. Best part is the well known "flag" concept - unlimited serving of variety of kebabs until you set your flag down. This new and innovative way of serving guests wins the heart of the guests very easily. After this kebab round we went for buffet. In the buffet, the menu and quality was quite average with respect to the cost I would say. All the delicacies - both kebabs and main courses were of a consistent standard. Main course Mutton was well-cooked though tasted quite ordinary. As a whole, average experience in a stylish and innovative presentation packaging.

Undoubtedly the best in business and best in town.Array of never ending delicacies on your platter matched with great service and sense of hospitality has etched its place in every gourmets' heart.
The chef even comes to you and asks how the food is, taking  every individuals input.When I told I didn't find the veg tikka tasty enough he went back to his kebab centre and after sometime came back with some finger licking good stuff.Now could you ask for anything more? 
The never ending supply of starters usually count for most of your input.So, you have very little space for the multitude of goodies still in the main course and ofcourse the desert section.
After 2hrs of gluttony we were stuffed and happy to the very corner of our heart. Buffet Ho to aisa!
Barbecue Nation is always the number 1 restaurant in my choice for Buffett business and that the fact it is in almost every city in India makes the fact more awesome.
Happy eating people!

Located just beside the RDB at sector V, Barbeque Nation is one of the finest of its nature. The system in it is unique and you'd love it. The starters are the pearl of this place. It's delicious and inexpensive in its own ways. No matter what's the occasion, it serves you right. I loved the ambiance and the way people treats you. The live muaic is one more plus to this place and you won't find that anywhere else.

The buffet is again above the mark and so is tge desserts. This is my favorite place to eat in and around Srctor V area. Prices are on the higher side to sone extent but then, you'd live the way this place is.

Visiting this amazing place is a treat in itself. This is the 2nd time i visited the place and must say the experience was even better than first time. Beer being added to complimentary drink and mineral water being added to the package were the 2 new additions. With the beer idea getting a wholehearted response.
Nothing new to say about the quality of the food, as its always been top notch. Specially the kebabs melt in your mouth and too hot to handle. The special delicacies of that day were Fish fry (Amazingly good), and the new Kulfi counter with various flavours and toppings of your choice.
Things have just gone from great to awesome, next time when i visit if i find the exact same quality and even further additions i will definitely make this a 5 star rating.
Also a special mention to the hospitable staff and the manager who visits every table to get one on one feedback. Also the chef had visited the table to ask us about the food. This was a great thing. Looking forward to next visit and the rest will be self explanatory in the pics i have uploaded.

Its an amazing place to party with your friends.
All the starters are awesome. The veg kebabs are a specialty. Pineapple was sweet and juicy, mushrooms were aptly roasted, the corn bits were great as always. Paneer tikka was soft and piquant.

BBQ Nation offers 12 different types of desserts to cater to your sweet tooth.

More items less price and quality has always been up to the mark.
For that it is always crowded. Better reserve a table before visiting.

Barbeque nation is famous for its lip smacking starters and sinfully delicious desserts. The starters consist of prawns, chicken, corn and potato...each of them are equally good. The main course is average but the desserts definitely makes up for it. The ambience and the decor is great. Brownie points for hospitality. Overall a thumbs up...Must try!!

I went to Barbeque Nation for lunch on a weekday. The buffet with unlimited starters was opted for, and the staff served us the starters (mainly kebabs) at the table. Apart from the meat items, the crisp-fried Bombay Duck, the grilled paneer and the litchis on skewers stood out as being very good.

The problem lay with the food available on the buffet table. Most of the food was fairly bland, and a couple of meat items were undercooked. The mini prawn cocktail was particularly bad. The only good item there was the crab masala.

The dessert section was equally disappointing. The tender coconut payasam and the vanilla ice-cream was good, but other items - the chocolate cake, the mango mousse and the kulfi - were fairly ordinary. There was something labelled "blue cheese cake" that was particularly bad because it did not taste of anything, appearing to be little more than coloured gelatin.

My disappointment with this restaurant stems from the fact that it has received a great deal of praise, both among acquaintances and in online forums. While the ambience was decent and the staff both polite and prompt, the quality of the food would make me think twice about going there again.

I have tasted the buffet lunches two times.. But the nothing can stand with barbque nation.. In comparison to other restaurant this stand in top of the list. The best place to taste starter and desserts.. I visited this place two times and everytime i get impressed.. The waiters and staff they will make u feel comfortable and smile on their face will make you feel you are at your own home.. Mutton kabab, chicken kababs fish kababs prawn all are just mind blowing and the lovely taste will make you feel to visit this place again.. The cheese cake and hot gulab jamun and halwa, fruit salad makes your mouth sweeter. One thing what i like about barbque nation is that the waiter and staff come to each table to ask how the people are enjoying and they will also make you learn to taste which sauces will be more tasty with different kababs.. In one sentence this is the best place in kolkata to have the buffet lunch.. One thing i can say my love for this place will continue even if i die..

Been here 5-6 times and still thinking of one minor reason to rate it 4.5... Nahhhh!!! Not getting any!!! CONSISTENCY in great Food and Service are the USP of BBQN. One of the Best buffets in town undoubtedly.
Location: Sector V, ¬†near Infinity or RDB... well, well, this place itself is a landmark.
Ambiance: Comfortable seating with great dining. The place has enough space, still not sufficient for the large number of customers. Be there on Time to get the table of your choice. 4/5
Service: Commendable and dedicated, to say the least. the staffs are really polite. The chefs even come to you to know your requirement. Waiting time is not much. Kebabs will always be there at your table and the staffs will continue their service as long as the Flag is up there. 5/5
Food: The most delectable part of BBQN and BANG ON!!! Firstly, they serve the complimentary drink. For the starters, I always found the kebabs very tender and juicy. No complaints at all. Special mention to their Chicken tengri kebab and Sweet crispy babycorn. UNLIMITED starter in its true sense. After gorging over their sumptuous starters and to keep some space for their dessert, normally I don't like to have much in the main course. Nothing specific to talk about. All are equally delicious (the ones that I tasted). Now comes the Dessert and Yes, there are large number of varieties which generally includes angoori gulab jamun, vanilla ice cream, fresh fruit cuts, phirney, 2-3 types of pastry, cheese cake etc. My favorite Angoori gulab jamoon with Vanilla Icecream steals the show every time. 5/5

Yes, It is my heaven when it comes to gorge on some great Kebabs combined with great service and comfort dining. Love BBQN!!!

One suggestion: It would be really great if this restaurant chain thinks of opening few more outlets in Kolkata or Suburbs.

There are few places where I personally find fully satisfied food and also dedicated servicing. Over the years Kolkata has evolved in many ways; sports, fashion, food, art, among these food is the perhaps the only way which has been always soft corner of every Kolkatan. Bengalis love to spend on foods of every kind. From grilled to chaat they simply love to relish all types. Gone are the days when every household follow their strict dos and don‚Äôts. Now there is hardly any boundary to experiment with all sorts of gourmet foods even there is mix and match. And one of such restaurant is Barbeque nation which stands out with their appetizing menu such as cilantro grill vegetables or honey chilli soya or kashturi prawn and many others. The restaurant has on its platter scrumptious items like methi murg, paneer butter masala, aloo capsicum dry, vegetable dam biriyani. Barbeque nation has brought some dishes from other lands such as Mexican chicken soup. The restaurant has reasons to impress people with sweet tooth, walnut cake with rabri, angoori gulab jamun, fresh cut fruits, phirnee, cheese cake, ice cream all are here to make you drool. So what are you waiting for?

Barbeque nation! The name says it all! Ambiance- Good and comfortable. At first they gave complimentary drinks and we opted for fresh lime soda! Starters- my god! Thai garlic fish- i just loved that preparation. Juicy and succulent pieces of fish and chicken too. I had a lot of their starters. I just could not stop myself. Then in main course we had biriyani, methi murg, chicken in hot garlic sauce,bbq chicken salad. All the dishes were very tasty but the starters were awesome. Then in desserts we had gulab jamun- it was the best! Then choco mousse,ice cream,pine apple cake,kulfi. My god! I was literally full after having the starters. I would love to visit this place again. Meat lovers don't hesitate and just go for it! Thank you.

So this place had been in my wish list for a long long time, being the most talked about restaurant in the city when it comes to kebabs. Finally visited Barbeque Nation today! Reservation HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I had to wait for more than one and half hours today(Sunday noon). I am a sucker for killer ambiance and decor, yes¬†
I do find out how the restaurant looks, before finding out about their food. And apart from mostly 5 stars, in most places in¬†Kolkata, you will never get both good food and killer ambiance at a time. Barbeque Nation is well decorated and adequately lit up.
¬† Talking of food, yes they do serve one of the best kebab spreads in town, soft, scrumptious and delectable, the kebabs will just melt in your mouth. I personally fell in love with their prawn kebab, and the chef's special grilled fish. And yes, they have live grille on every table, to keep you kebabs soft and warm forever.
They provide you with a complimentary drink as well, you can select any one from the few options which includes a beer, or aerated drink, or fresh lime soda or aam panna. I went for aam panna, but would recommend you to go for the aerated drink, which will help you to wash down the kebabs.
¬† They have a lot of options in the main course as well, but I was almost full by the time I had wrapped up with the starters. So could just have a little bit of chicken salad, and sea food salad, which were okay, but nothing close to the heavenly kebabs. So headed straight to the desert section. And I was floored. Though, they could have more options of chocolate deserts, I was mighty impressed with the spread. The hot gulab jamoons can just sweep any one off their feet. They have chocolate mousse and chocolate cake, which you can make even more chocolaty by adding as much amount of chocolate sauce you want. Vanilla ice-cream, pineapple cake and freshly cut fruits were a part of the desert spread. And don't forget to try out their kulfi, I loved the mango kulfi, which the chef made to perfection. And yes, you can customize the kulfi as per your taste. But if you ain't any expert like me, better leave it to the chef to serve you one of the best kulfis in town.
¬† Service is very quick and mind blowing considering the huge crowd that the staff has to attend. And ambiance is nothing out of the world(read congested) but good. You don't have to call them the waiters to ask for repairs, they come to the table and greet you with a smile(read great courtesy) ask ask if you need another helping of anything, or if you would like them to change something about their food or service. They don't accept tips.¬†¬†

¬† Pocket pinch is 1400 inclusive of tax for 2.
Must visit guys, and eat till you go blue in the face.

Ohh well......this place has THE best buffet spread in town. I have been to this place a couple of times and never it failed to satisfy my taste buds with its sumptuous menu. The starters are amazing and the vegetarian starters also taste great. The main course is a little down but the deserts section again is outstanding. The waiters are very courteous and promt in service. The decor is also good. In terms of menu and quality of food this place is by far the best buffet destination in town. The pricing is also reasonable keeping in mind the elaborate menu and food quality.
P.S - Do give this place a visit whenever you wish to have countless number of mouth watering starters and deserts :-)

Look... Its pretty much an established and widely known fact that BBQ Nation serves the best buffet in town in the sub 1000 range. Yes its better than its close competitors like Global Grill or way ahead of Ocean Grill. 
The kebabs are tender and juicy given the huge footfall everyday and round the clock production, its difficult to maintain such quality. Equally good are the veggies.
But let me not get lost in the goods and speak about the few negatives.
1. The biriyani has improved little over the years and does not taste anything close to some of the bests served in town.
2. The indian breads are below average. They are sometimes left raw in parts, the butter is applied almost next to nowhere and are anything but soft and fluffy.

In the end I just love every moment spent here. Everytm.

What more to say about this place. It's like been more than 4 years I have been going to this place and finally thought of reviewing this place. The food is just amazing. I like kebabs and grilled items more than anything. I recently visited this place for dinner and some sea food festival was going on. We tasted some new kinds of fish and I liked it to be honest. The kebabs were tender and very soft and I kept on gorging on those yummy and delicious starters. In the main course section they had prawn biriyani and to me it's one of the best biriyanis I ever had. Another item which I liked a lot was their prawn cocktail. The desert was as usual one of the best things to try out there with so many varieties, and as am more of a sweet loving person I simply couldn't resist it. To me this place calms me down and am in peace, coz there ain't nothing like eating.

This place is my all time favourite kebab spot. This place has the best kebabs compared to any of the other such kebab places. The food and dessert spreads really want to make you keep going even after having loads of kebabs! This place has a good aura to it. And the people are good too, they will not accept any tips in any circumstances! You would really want to tip them after the amazing service though.

I have visited Barbeque Nation on several occasions over the course of the last few months. And while, the Kolkata outlet of Barbeque Nation has been the best experience ever, there is always room for improvement.

I visited the Sector-V branch with a couple of friends for lunch. We were 2 vegetarians and 2 non-vegetarians. Now, the place was almost full, even on a weekday, at 12:30 pm. This speaks volumes about its quality of food and service. We were shown a table almost immediately, didn't have to wait for too long.

At lunch time, you get a complimentary drink with your food. We opted for 2 beers and 2 iced-teas. And then, the starters started pouring in. There are green plates for the vegetarians and black ones for the non-vegetarians so that the servers don't get confused. Each table has a grill and trays of a variety of oils, seasonings and dressings that one may apply on the skewers, as per one's taste. The starters were amazing, especially the Cajun Spiced Potato, the Salt and Pepper Golden Corn and the Tandoori Mushroom. For non-vegetarians, the seafood, especially the prawns, are heavenly and absolutely melt in the mouth. We had starters for quite a long time, till we absolutely could not take in another morsel.¬†

After resting for a bit (who said eating doesn't take effort!) we tried a bit of the main course. The Biriyani was good and so was the Dal, but we had no space to try anything else, so we skipped the rest of the main course and opted for the desserts.¬†

Now, the dessert counter had a selection of fresh fruits, ice cream with a variety of fruit flavored crushes and chocolate sauce, baby gulab jamuns, chocolate pastry and some pudding. The Gulab Jamuns were heavenly. Everything else was average, nothing special.

Finally, we called for the cheque, which came along with a tablet for reviewing and rating the restaurant. We paid the bill and left. Also, they don't accept tips!

Now, I LOVE Barbeque Nation (who doesn't?), but it'd great if you changed your menu a bit from time to time, especially the desserts. The service is great. In fact, the servers keep inquiring about the taste of the food and whether you require something else. Another thing I'd like to add is that they only offer Kingfisher Beer ¬†(amongst the alcoholic drinks) along with the lunch buffet. It'd be great if they served more variety.¬†

So, the ratings for Barbeque Nation would be as follows:¬†

AMBIENCE: 3.5/5

FOOD: 4/5

SERVICE: 4.5/5

VALUE FOR MONEY: 4.5/5

PS: Early birds (who turn up between 12-12:30 or something, are given a certain percentage of discount on their bills).

A few months ago I had promised to revisit B'BQ Nation while writing a review for its Bangalore outlet. Never knew I would be writing the next one for the Kolkata outlet.

Last time I had opted for the vegetarian buffet menu but this time I tried out their non-vegetarian delicacies. The menu on all their outlets are one and the same and even though I visited them after almost a year, there has been no significant change in the variety. Another place where there has been no change is the quantity and quality of the food- still sumptuous and tasty as the last time that I ate there. I still maintain that this place is slightly better suited to non-vegetarians and the dessert section is of the highest standards.

We were sitting on the sofas at the farthest end of the restaurant and would like to request the management to change the lighting system in that corner because it was a little too dark compared to the rest of the place. Staff behaviour is good. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the management for upholding such fantastic levels of culinary delight and request them to bring some variety into the menu-not just in the dessert section but also in the starters and the main course.

Food is always good, but the last time the service they offered was horrible. Despite reminding the manager for serveral times that we are celebrating a friends ¬†birthday he ¬†didnt got the cake. I had been in this chain of Pune celebrating anothers friends birthday and they really served us well by providing a cake to cut with some music and a photo frame. 5 stars for the Barbeque nation but 1 star for the one in Kolkata. Please improve your service in Kolkata and try to change your menu.

Food quality in all the item is very good. The way of delivering of food is make you able to fill that you r special for them.

Nothing new to write ,i have always been a fan of BBQ-N since my days from hyderabad... was surprised with the elaborate and delicious main course that they offered this time apart from the awsome starters. Generally the main course is just average , but on my last visit even with 3/4th full stomach the maincourse did tickle my taste buds well. ...cheers ¬†and kudos to the mngmt @BBQ-N...keep up the good work

The first thing that comes to mind is food,food and food.A rare combination of delicacy and unlimited food is here,add to it a very reasonable pricing.I have been here 4 times and must say with every visit my fondness for this place has gone better.Arguably the best customer service in town is here,Even the floor managers come to your aid when needed.Only the biriyani needs to get better,the. 5 deduction for that,and the waiting time is quite high,but again for the no. 1 restaurant in town it is a worthy wait

Today we had a team lunch from our office. My first visit to Barbeque Nation. Decor is fine you get a cozy feeling when you enter. 
We had buffet lunch service. I liked that grill on the table concept. We could actually char our own kebabs. It was a good variety of non veg and veg both considering there was a veggie in our team we gotta eat both. So it started with chicken kebabs mutton galouti fish kebabs and prawns and from veg I only tasted charred pineapple. Kebabs were served hot tasted fine like succulent.
In the main course Nonveg section had two types of rice chicken bhuna curry mutton sarson fish and crab salads had fresh strawberry chicken salad I only tried that one and indeed it was a good choice. 
Though here as well my favourite was Dessert. It had two types of pastries gulab jamuns variety of kulfis in which my personal picks were Paan flavoured kulfi and the strawberry one. Then it had vanilla ice cream with two different sauce payesh firni strawberry tart and mango mousse. 
My first visit to this place is worth remembering.

I don't think this place needs a review. I guess this is the Best Pocket Friendly Buffet one can come accross in Kolkata. Love everything about this place. Awesome food, specially the Biryani, do not miss the biryani at any damn cost, very very prompt service, the staff is amazingly polite and even cooked me up a special dish cause i found their Chicken Kebab a bit sweet. However the place can get a bit too noisy sometimes, still a third when compared to the Noise levels of Bombay Shiv Sagar.

Ambience- 3.5/5
Food- 4.5/5
Service- 5/5

Having a barbeque for yourself with piping hot dishes is a great way to spend time with your family and friends.
Both veg and non veg sizzlers are delicious.
Something creative should be there for dessert.

Aahhh.... Visited after a month... Got a Table quite fast on a Sunday afternoon. Liked it... Now coming to the main part. I am disappointed with the veg starters though non veg was bit better expect it to be more spicy. Ambience nice service good. Main course was OK not so great. In deserts I was expecting nice cheese cake but I didn't got that... I liked the gulab jamun and the kulfii. 
Not actually satisfied. Want to see a better taste in future visit if any.

This is one of the few restaurants whose buffet can be enjoyed whole heartedly. I'm more of a brunch person so I generally visit this place in the afternoons. The food is amazing the drinks are good too. They start of with an assortment of fried corn and onions which is simply to die for if had with some mango sauce. They have a preparation called vegetable special which basically potato fritters with a spicy tartar sauce which is quite lip-smacking. The kababs are the ones which are actually worth the wait. Chicken and mutton ones are heavenly where as the shrimp is not as good but delicious. They're quite innovative when it comes to deserts. Kulfi with many kinds of syrups , rabri and the classic icecreams with hot chocolate sauce and syrups of your choice. You may have a fresh lime to wash it all down but my personal favourite JD on the rocks is the perfect accompaniment with the grills.

THE BEST RESTAURANT in KOLKATA !

Each and every item is lip-smacking-finger-licking good !
The best part is the warmth of the way the staff interact with you !
Have been to this place umpteen number of times and each time i love this place more :)
The Best part is if you reserve a table beforehand ... they ask you whether u'll be celebrating something special... if its a yes from your side... they arrange for a cake with candle and serve that right after the main-course :) 
Once i was there celebrating my friends birthday... they even clicked a photo and instantly gave us a hardcopy of it on an envelope... that was an extremely nice gesture :)
The service of this place is so good that even the chef comes to each table and asks if the dishes were good... and if you say u dint like some dish, he will go back to the kitchen and make a different preparation and serve you ... :) 

More than the food, the warmth of the staff makes me keep going back to this place :)

TOO GOOD

Everything at barbeque nation is awesome, except for the fact that you may have to wait for an hour on festive days. My entire experience on Valentine‚Äôs Day afternoon was very nice. They have very comfortable cushioned sofas where you can spend ample time gossiping and having your food. The ambience, the slow music, hospitality, service is too good.

You don‚Äôt have an ala-carte option barbeque nation offers only buffets. The buffet includes a complimentary drink and you can choose to have beer. The griller is brought right on to your table for you to relish the juicy kebabs at your own pace. They start with fish, then comes chicken, followed by prawns and this cycle continues unless you are content. The specials, off the grill items keeps on coming at regular intervals. We had some sort of CRISPY SWEET CORN, JAMAICAN JERK TANGDI and MUTTON GALAWATI KEBAB. The tangdi was too juicy to taste, the mutton kebab had a vibe of Lucknow in it. We were also served with CRISPY FRIED BOMBAY DUCK.

There‚Äôs a flag at your table which you are supposed to turn down once you are done with the starters. After having at least 4-5 helpings of starters I walked towards the buffet spread to have a glance. They had quite a lot of stuff spread but I headed straight towards the desserts table. I had everything that was on that table at least twice. I had PHIRNI, MANGO MOUSSE, DEATH BY CHOCOLATE PASTRY, ANGOORI GULAB JAMUN, BLUEBERRY CHEESE CAKE, VANILLA ICE CREAM and KULFI.

Moreover to make the day special they served a complimentary heart shaped pastry.

**Location = RDB Boulevard, Salt Lake Sector 5

**Brief = Went there last November to celebrate a special occassion :P I was wondering whether we needed to make reservations, so called them up using the Zomato App :D But they informed that day being a weekday, they dont take reservations and it will be a First In First Sit principle. But thankfully to their cordial staffs I got the seat within no time after reaching there.

**Ambiance = We reached there around 1 and it was damn crowded.Their dim lights and simple yet stylish decor makes it a comfortable place to have food with family or friends or colleagues.

**Things Tried = They serve a complimentary drink, of your choice. I preferred Aam Panna and Fresh Lime Soda :)
Then came the most intriguing part of this place,i.e. their unlimited kebab starters.
It consisted of Murgh Boti, Tangdi Kebab, Casundi Fish and Chilly garlic prawns. Each kebabs were soft and very well cooked. I also loved their cajun spiced potato and crisply fried baby corns :)

After having a long time affair with the kebabs, we finally decided to try their main courses.
The main course had salads to begin with, then they had the Dum Biriyani, Mutton rogan josh,butter chicken masala are some of them which I tried. And each of them are worth mentioning as they were all really nicely prepared dishes.

They had a large variety of desserts. I tried gulab jamuns,firni,chocolate pastry(bit odd), vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.

**Recommended = Kebabs and desserts, I would prefer to skip the main course next time I go there :D

**Service = I experienced a fabulous service, the servers,chefs from time to time came and inquired about our likes and dislikes. I liked the tab they gave me to provide me feedback.

**Purse Check = Rs.1400/- for 2 people :)

**Overall = There is no doubt why people rate it with a 5 pointer so often :)
I loved the experience and would surely visit again soon.

Amazing food.Endless starters are a really good concept and often my friends don't have food the whole day if they know they are going to Barbeque Nation later on.We haven't yet managed to not gorge on the starters.The buffet dinner or lunch has a mishmash of different vegetarian,meat and seafood choices.Soups,breads and rices are always different.Everyone can  definitely find something they like.The dessert buffet is good.Not exceptional but good.I would suggest having starters and the desserts.Must try and well worth the money you pay.

If you are planning to skip breakfast and hunger panga killing you in lunch , the prefect destination for value for money food. 
Food : tonnes of variety to choose from different preparations of paneer to vegetables for starters ! A unique dish was cheese filled bread made in the shape of chicken legs . For non veggies it's obviusly the epitome of food but for vegans also there are tonnes of options. Most of the times the starters and the desserts are enough to satisfy your taste buds . 
Ambience : pretty decent nothing very innovative but properly done and a good fine dining experience 
Service : on weekdays generally there is no problem as the service is prompt and fast . Expect some delays during Saturday night. 
Location : sector 5 is among the buzzing hotspots of the city and caters to the it professionals as well as party goers in the nearby lounges 

Thumbs up to this place !

Best known for its starters and the service. The main course items are ordinary but who wants main course when you have unlimited starters. ???? It's always difficult to find a place at lunch time and believe me my last 4 attempts went in vain. I would give it 5 out of 5 if Kolkata barbq provides sea-food. Personally I like Hyd and Pune one better than Kolkata because they served octopus and squids. But I would give more score Kolkata in hospitality department. Cheers!

This is my first visit here and I am writing this review on their wifi network :P 
The best thing here is their starter service. There are lots of varieties ranging from mushroom to prawn to chicken to mutton waiting to be served on a recurring basis. Their quality of food is great and their service is awesome. You will never have an empty plate in front of you. Even the head chef would ask you whether everything is alright and would make changes according to your taste like we demanded the prawn to be spicy and he obliged. 
I have not tasted anything from the main cuisine yet :P when you have this awesome of a starter you seriously dont want to move on to the main cuisine.
Dessert consists of tarts and chocolate cake which I am going to taste in a shortwhile. Don't miss this. A full 5.

I feel Barbeque Nation is heaven-on-earth for food lovers, be it a vegan or a non-vegetarian. They have an exciting variety of both on-the-grill and off-the-grill starters and all of them are very very tasty. I do not go for having the main course because their starters are way too overwhelming to be compromised for the main course. They even have a variety of desserts which are very good. The hospitality is very warm, the staff there are actually very happy serving us and very pleased to see us happy on eating what they are serving and make every effort to make the food right for us and as per our taste. The ambience is also very good.

P.S. The best buffet in Kolkata ! Kudos.!

BARBEQUE NATION
I may appear a bit skeptical in my review for this place, but that is totally dependent on my personal experience. To begin with one fine afternoon we decided to try another budget buffet, I had been to the funjabi  tadka which is just in the opposite building to the barbeque nation with almost the same menu and identical prices.

The joint aimed to draw the fancy of the salt lake working crowd is booming well, we went at around 12:20 , they  have an early bird advantage scheme which allows patrons who reach within 12:30 a certain discount, the interiors are very well decorated and the ambience compliments the dim lights well, as the previous reviews have raved about their starters which are skewers placed in a hot oven right in the middle of the table, they have an option to choose between sweet lime soda, ice tea, beer as a complimentary drink, we opted for sweet lime soda. The starters are an endless array of kebabs on skewers which the servers keep a close eye on whenever finished so that they can replace it with a fresh one , their service is spot on and the employed servers make the experience more enjoyable, full points for that, among the starters what I liked the most was the tawa machchi  and the Cajun spiced potato, others were the normal chicken, fish, mutton seekh kebabs. 

To begin with the main course I was somewhat flummoxed at the combination they had- nonveg biriyani, kadhai chicken, mutton rogan josh, chilly garlic chicken, fish kalia, chicken soup among the non veg essentials , I was too full with the kebabs to peek over the veg side, the dum  biryani was tasty, the mutton rogan josh had very small pieces of mutton , I have had better , the kadhai chicken was meaty and the gravy had a balanced consistency to it. They also had a chicken salad and a sea food salad along with pasta and the various other assortments; I didn‚Äôt try the fish kalia or the chilly garlic chicken.

The dessert section interested me the most and when I visit the next time am just gonna concentrate stuffing myself with the cake n pie, they had firni, ice-cream, butterscotch cheesecake, mud pie, 3 layer pudding, angoori  gulabjamun, strawberry roll, fresh cut watermelon and papaya . The cheesecake and the mud pie were to die for the mud pie was a piece of heaven and the cheesecake melts in your mouth, accompanied by some chocolate sauce.  
 
The bill for two came at 1180 bucks , which is very economical, the chefs coming to ask you if you like the taste as per your palate is a nice touch, although I would recommend separate slots for each item rather than clubbing it with another, also the mutton rogan josh has room for a lot of improvement . All said and done a nice place and definitely worth each penny.

Writing my first review here, and what better way to begin with, than THE Barbeque Nation.
This place is simply a paradise for all the voracious folks out there. I mean how many buffet places literally coerce you into having yet another helping of their dishes?
They would probably get a full house even if there was a curfew on the streets!
To start off with, one is served an assortment of kebabs along with their choicest dips and chicken legs (a complementary beverage per person during lunch hours too).
The chefs keeps visiting lest you come across some food not to your satisfaction and lo & behold, they would provide an exclusive dish just for you!
Once one is done with the starters (after perhaps an hour, and more or less spent), begins the array of main course. Breads are provided at the table itself if you ask for it (and yes, without any additional charge). Then arrives the nectarous medley of toothsome desserts. 
(These lots should really provide a home drop off because one can hardly move after spending about 150 minutes here.)
All in all, A FEAST FIT FOR A KING.
p.s. The stupendous attendants do not accept the 'traditional tip' here. They would probably pursue you even out of the country to return the same!

Food is really good. They do go in invovations with there food items which is good.
Food quality taste is really good no match to any other buffet which you get in kolkata.
Main dishes and dessert sweets all good and they keep changing it to.
Service of attendents is also good.
All in all a great package.
But now cuming on to the price in lunch buffet the price is different and dinner buffet is different when items remain same why the price is less and more and plus lunch buffet you get a complimentary drink which gets missing in the dinner buffet. Strange thing
But anyways its great i often go there good food great taste.

How you review barbeque nation?!!
You just say its AWESOME. The food is just out of this world. If you haven't tried the nation yet, you probably haven't been to the culinary heaven of Kolkata.
PS its only all u can eat buffet. If u plan to eat here, dont eat anything from the morning, or else u will regret it. :D

This is hands-down the most satisfying and budget-buffet in town.
If that isn't enough of an incentive, then let me tell you the taste of every delectable bite is exquisite, the hospitality extended towards the customers, very very warm and the spread available fantastic.

Although it was crowded, no one had to wait too long. We were immediately given a seat upon arrival.
To start off, the starters included
Fried Sweet Chilli Corn
Mexican-style roasted Chicken Drumsticks
Mutton Sheek Kebabs
Two types of fish kebabs
Hariyali Prawns
One Chef's Special : Pineapple Chicken

Complimentary Drink : Soft Drinks or Fresh Lime.

Main Course : By the time I was done with my starters, I didn't really have a lot of space but their Chicken Biriyani, Amritsari Fish and Mutton Kasha.. Yes, my mouth's watering as I type this out! :D

Dessert :
Vanilla Icecream
5 kinds of Kulfi- Fig, Pan, Strawberry, Mango, Malai-kesar and respective condiments.
Mango souffl√©
Fruit Cake
Banana Cake
Fresh Fruits.

Pocket pinch : 690/-

So verdict : I'm in love with this place!

If you are in Kolkata and you are looking for a place to have awesome starters,delicious deserts  and amazing cocktails (I am not talking about main course,as you are hardly left with any space after having starters) this is the best to be at. Though the ambience is quite average, their service will make you feel special for sure..

Last Thursday night I visited this place.

The ambience is good.

It started wid many starters...frankly speaking it justifies its name...coz starter portion is too good.there s no complaints Abt dat.

Bt when it comes to main course.it disappoints me..the varity s not good enough for dis portion.

ND most irritating thng is Dey r not using fillet when it comes to a fish dish.d fish s full of bones.

It totally disapoints me.

ND again when I come to dessert portion it delights me.

The place s fully crowded,still d servce is very good.

Overall my experience is good..bt not too much satisfying.

Whatte a place boy!! Perhaps they are the ones who mastered the true concept of a buffet in Calcutta; and nobody's been learning from them, such a shame. 
I go to this place for the starters, 10-12, are one of the most entrancing treats one could expose their taste buds to. Also the dessert options. 
The main course can be a bit of a disappointment as compared to the starters but not bad either. 
Overall very good food and ambience, service is prompt, and the whole buzz of the place keeps your gastronomical journey going!

what an experience..had an excellent buffet which includes 4 types chicken kebab,2 types fish kebabs,chicken tandoori,prawn kebabs,fish amritsari(fry),naan ruti,breads,paneer makhani,chana,baby aloodum,chicken salad,seafood salad,pasta salad,raita(its really good),chicken biriyani,mutton roganjosh(little salty),fish kalia,vaat,alu fry..in desert we had-mango cake,chocolate cake,fruit cake,watermelon,papaya,firni,gulab zamun,kheer(with lots of ghee),vanila ice cream,kulfi..food quality is awesome..they have lots of variety to choose from.

Now according to hospitality i would like to give them 5 on 5. whenever you are tasting a new dish the manager comes to you and ask if u are enjoying your food or not..one of my friend had a sweet punishment today .she said mutton roganjosh  was not so good and then she opt for the desert.suddenly some one came 2 us.this time not the manager but the Safe himself.ask her to wait for a while becoz his juniors are making a new mutton dish specially for her and she had to taste it.the new mutton curry was better than the first one.then she went for the desert.:D what a hospitality.so u you see they cook not only for u but also especially for YOU, the food lovers..

¬†its a must visit for foodys..<3

Our friend treated us to dinner at this place recently.
Location is in the hub of business district of Salt Lake Sec V. They therefore have that advantage of a virtually captive clientele.
Ambience is very good.
Service is efficient in terms of speed but details/ quality of service have to be paid attention to.
Choice of the place was keeping in view availability of vegetarian options. Our host was all for this place because of the Starter Menu and Kulfi choices available.
In beverages service was good. But don't know why options for serving Vodka or any drink are not asked for at the time of taking orders. They bring Seven up with Cherries added for adding to Vodka.
Secondly they have to add Miller Lite Beer to their menu. No reason not to promote better brands and likewise no reason to promote Kingfisher or some others.
Starters were very good especially Mutton Sheekh Grilled Prawn Grilled Chicken items and Potato, Paneer and Dahi Kabab among Veg Starters! Grilled Fish was bland. Quality of fish and spices used were not to our liking.
Thereafter we went for the buffet spread. Biriyani was ok only so far as mutton quality was concerned. But the Spices in Biriyani fell short of expectations. Rice was white in patches and portions and spiced in portions. In veg Khara Subzi items were over spiced. The other option of Alu Posto was a plain option. Tandoori Roti was good.
In sweet dish their much touted item of Kulfi made to choice turned out to be short of expectations. "Pista Kulfi" turned out to be Kulfi coloured dull green. When I asked for Pista Kulfi they added Paan Masala to "Pista" Kulfi before serving. That was a dampener.
Rest of the items in sweets were ok.
Finally I would rate Sigree Global Grill and Flame and Grill slightly better than this Restaurant!
4.6 Average Zomato Rating is a little over rated. 4 would be objective.
I wish they apply their minds on such issues as pointed out here and not settle down to a level of complacency!!!

Review of a vegetarian and non alcoholic 

Atmosphere : 9/10
Service : 8.5/10
Starters : 9/10
Soup and salad : 7/10
Main course : 8/10
Desserts : 10/10

++ early bird offers Monday -  Thursday 
-- few non alcoholic complimentary drinks

Being a vegetarian,  I pretty much believed my options would be limited.  But trust me,  I was blown away when they started pouring those starters one after another. 
I know the non-vegetarian folks would be skirmish,  but it was a treat to have 5 starters on the grill and another 7 on the plate.  Each being served as it was prepared. The assortments were standard and fresh. The main course offered many 
options but except for the tandoor items it was not exceptional. The salad options were however limited.  The desserts were 
fabulous.  The queue and overflowing plates were acknowledging the opinion. 

As for the service,  I requested  for and was served a starter even after my dessert. So,  they do pretty well on that front I believe. 

The complimentary drink options need to be broadened. Including a few mocktails won't hurt. 

All in all if you can,  do indulge in the experience.

The first barbeque nation I ever went to and one that predisposed me to loving all the others that I would go to later.The first thing that we noticed were the family sized tables which could seat all of us comfortably and the live grilling stations they put at our tables.
The staff has got to be almost this short of Goa friendly:),exceptionally quick service and smiling staff who love to feed you.They even have a read my lips please no tips badge which they wear and point out to you with a smile if you insist on a tip.If you go on a new year or christmas day they put up dances by the staff which are amazing.This place is also the reason why I had begun associating the brand with live music and was disappointed at the barbeque nation at pali hill[it's now reopened as bombay barbeque] when they did not have the same.
Food is amazing,I am a vegetarian and can tell from the delight that I see echoed on my non veggie friends faces that the non vegetarian is as good as,if not better than the veg.Starters are the stars of the show though.The rest of the buffet spread is good as well,but pretty average tastewise.

Awesome place. The buffet is a baseline for the other restaurants serving buffet courses. All non-veg starters - mutton,fish,chicken ,prawns and crabs (occassionally) are awesome, among the veg best are american corn and alu tikka. Just yummm.. Whenever I hop in here I jump directly to deserts from the starters. The range of deserts is awesome. From ice creams, brownies, souffles , cakes , fruit salads to firni and hot gulab jamun. Specially the sinful combination of hot gulab jamuns with cold vanilla ice cream would force you to crave for more. The staff is very cordial and co-operative. They ask you if you want anything in the menu to be changed or customized as per your taste and they do the same. Will I go back there? Everytime I am planning for a budget buffet restaurant with awesome food, this is definitely one of the first choices. Yes I would come back again and again.

This was the first barbeque nation I have been to. It was an awesome experience. There was some food festival going on with a theme of foods from across india , and I loved the variety in the buffet spread. There was prawns and chicken for starters and we loved it. The desserts were very good . There was an impromptu dance performance by the waiters which was so nice and they danced to the theme . the waiters were very good and served us well. The overall ambience was awesome. I have since moved to Bangalore and am looking forward to visit the Barbeque Nation here soon.

Often after my visit i write reviews and areas they should work on and they responded positively. Well when it comes to buffet,usually restaurants didn't come up with our expectation,as they try to maintain the quantity,not the quality.¬† And as i am a foodholic,¬† i used to roam and try different dishes and restaurants but this has been probably best food junction in the city... :)

Does this place even need a review?!

One of the most popular places in this city, where I go back again .. (pause) and again ..(pause) and again!

The best part - You can never have enough! The bitter truth - You are bound to put on weight! :-P

They have provided an add-on which started from today (and I hope it goes on forever) --> Kulfi Nation, where we got to choose from 6 flavours and create our own kulfi!
 I had to drop the idea of having the regular vanilla ice-cream with the hot gulaab jamuns and chocolate sauce. Why? I was so full of the kebabs and kulfi.

P.S. - The gallery here is already filled with too many of the sumptuous kebabs and the biriyani that they provide. Just adding the kulfi-snaps from today.

Been there several times recently. Every time got spoiled and overate. Don't go there if you are worried about your weight and calorie intake !! Best of kebabs and tikkas as starter, with a drink as complimentary followed by full course meal. You can eat as much as you want. Worst is their sweets, desserts and ice creams which is 100% sure to make fun of your will power. You are sure to fill up your quarter plate if you dare to go near that section. Enjoyed the food and saved lots of money too as this place which serves such variety and quantity doesn't burn your pocket at all.

I visited Barbeque Nation a few days back and this being my second visit to the place, I was left fairly impressed by the whole ambience. The service, as expected was very good with friendly staff constantly aware of refilling our table with starters and asking for our reviews on the food. The prawn starter, though, was a bit of a letdown. It was a tad bit dry and burnt. The other starters were very good! So was the main course! The desserts were the highlight of the afternoon, though!! A lot of choices and all very tasty! The mango pudding, although a bit too sweet, was good. Other than that, the overall experience was enjoyable and I would definitely come here again!

Everytime i go to this place few things happen. 
1. I forget the limits to my appetite. 
2. I cannot seem to eat and gossip at the same time. 
3. I forget to turn the starters flag down and the waiters keep on putting more sticks in the oven. 
4. When it comes to the main course i never quite get enough of it. 
5. The desserts make me feel like im a mischievous child.
6. I cannot get up from my seat after a session of gluttony.

Thats the beauty of our bbqn. A place having true respect for all the gourmets out there.

It was on my birthday that I went with my friends to Barbecue Nation and some of us had actually fasted or skipped meals since 2 days prior to the food trip and and were went looking like salivating ogres. Either way, upon arrival there was a queue even though the restaurant wasn't even open. 

NOTE: They should make a first come first serve entry in their log books so that the people who arrived first can enter first otherwise unruly people just shove around and get through. I mean seriously, people behave like kids sometimes. :|

Continuing... we were served mocktails, a cheese and corn based fritter-y dish and kebabs right at out table and we gorged like crazy. They actually were not able to cope up with our speed of eating (didn't help but notice that others were quite slow in eating and we had at least 3 different people bringing us kebabs). After 60+ skewers of kebabs we decided we should move on to the main course, which we were pretty much hopeless at having because of our uncontrollable love for all things grilled. 

Undeniably the star dish was vegetarian, take that! It was a malai kofta dish and it was truly extraordinary, naming all the dishes for the date I went is pointless because they had a temporary run of filmi names for Christmas-New Year - all the dishes we had were great and sadly the desserts were not up to the mark except of course the tiny bite sized gulab jamuns in all their glory piled up together. Pretty much every other dessert was not worth eating sadly - the quality ranged from poor to okay except for the aforementioned gulab jamuns there were a solid 9/10. Except desserts everything was awesome, the jhinga kebabs and mutton kebabs were worth their salt. 

After our meal we were unable to move and were paralyzed, thanks to overeating, I hope the management don't hate us for making them work more than other customers because of the sheer amount effort they had to put in due to our ingrained habit of going into overdrive at buffets. Will revisit, definitely!! :)

Been here. Done that. Yo! We reached around 1:30pm and it was totally packed. Waited for almost 30minutes before getting a table for 2.
We availed the non-veg buffet. What surprised me was the inclusion of one hard/soft drink per head in the buffet. I have been to other buffet places and they only served soft drinks. Anyways so we took one pepsi and one kingfisher premium beer.
Started with the lemon coriander chicken soup. Expected bread sticks or something to go along with the soup. But none! Nevertheless the soup was good. Since i dont eat anything spicy at all, it was a bit spicy for ME. But i liked the soup because it wasnt bland like other buffet places.
The grill was set up. We were served the kebabs and other starters along with 3 table marinations and 4 table dips. The fried sweet corns and potato wedges were good. I loved the dhakai prawns. I think i almost filled my half stomach with the dhakai prawns. Then i liked the mutton gilafi seekh kebab. It was soft and juicy. Mirch masala tangdi kebab comes third in my like list. It was full of masalas and went too well with the green chutney. The hara bhuna chicken kebab and jamaican jerk fish kebab were sort of okay. Those too went well with the other table dips. The 'today's special' was tawa fish which was yumm. It was stir fried fish with pineapple and veggies. Had a tangy flavour.
We then shifted to the main course. I first tried the assortment of salads. There was a russian salad of fruits and potato and lettuce with pesto or cream. I liked the seafood salad. I could only understand the prawns in it. I dont know what other meat went in it, but it tasted good. I loved the chicken salad. It was pickled and tasted sour-ish. Just what i love. Lol! There was another salad with zucchini and cottage cheese. Too bland. But it went just fine with masala papad.
Shifted to the REAL main course. I liked the dry chilly chicken. I liked the mutton rogan josh. I heard the fish kohlapuri was good. But i absolutely loved the non-veg dum biriyani and dora wat chicken. The chicken was heavenly. After every bite i couldn't just help going mmmm.
Had just little space in my stomach to try out the SINFUL desserts. The firni was good. So was the butter scotch pastry. The watermelon and papaya slices were fresh. I had the vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and do i need to describe it? The mudpies were good. A bit dry, like it should be. But the star of the show (read:luncheon) was the mango pudding. I helped myself to a lot of it, infact till i could eat no more. Simply delicious. No wonder that particular item was finishing the fastest.
Overall a wonderful feast. I remembered to click a few pictures too. Hehe! A must visit for everyone. Price was reasonable. Go with your family or friends or that special someone and enjoy the spread. Cheerie!

After a long wait i finally got to visit this restaurant. The ambience, the food, the service .. everything is beyond compare. The best i have had so far. In fact they were so hospitable that a friend of mine did not like mutton stater so they served a chicken stater especially for us

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†I know probably everything about this restaurant has already been spoken of. The only thing i would like to add is that even if you go there on week day do reserve before going or else you might face a long queue.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†
¬†Hence i would say that its a must visit for every foodie. :-)

One of my favorite place in any city, but was a bit skeptic about its Kolkata eatery till I visited with my family group of 14 members. Very easy to locate as it is the road behind (I Suppose) infinity building and is on the ground floor of RDB Cinema. Staff extremely courteous and knowledgeable. They know and care for each of their customer which is most important. Starters were excellent with taste to crave for and was truly unlimited, but i wish they also had a few more tikka options. Main course were excellent with too many options. Same thing with desert. I simply loved the Biriyani which can be easily compared with Arselan or India Hotel, rather i would say this was better with the mouth-watering true awadhi taste. Ambiance is the only category which needs improvement if i compare with Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Mohali, Chandigarh or Hyderabad as I have eaten in all these outlets. Special Thanks to the Restaurant Manager Mr. Ali. Please keep it up. We were there for lunch during weekdays. Real good value for money.

Barbeque Nation is the one of the best restaurant i have ever been. First of all food is really mesmerising. Quality of starters are really too good. Specially fish kebabs r out of the world. I ate so many starter and i was literally unable to taste all the main courses. Among the main course biriyani was good. And the mutton preparation was mouthwatering. Finally the desert. Halwa and gulab jamun was the best part. Firni was little disappointing. But cheesecake was good. Last but not d least i am ready to give a standing ovation for their hospitality. Simply an outstanding experience.

The barbeque is this restaurant's saving grace, the skewers were varied and tasty, but the food in the main course leaves much to be desired, to top it all off not a big buffet person. But if you eat a lot then it's a great place

The best place ever if you want to go for buffet. They have a wide spread of starters which they serve you. I was almost filled with the starters (chicken kebabs, prawn kebabs, mutton kebabs ). The maincourse spread was also pretty good, but i didn't have place for them in my stomach :p I shifted to the desserts section which had ice cream, gulab jamun, sweets, cakes, jalebi..oh so many yummy things :) They serve you the starters really fast, but you have to help yourselves with the maincourse and desserts.¬†
The ambience is really good. There was a food festival goin on when we went. The waiters had to follow a theme of all indian style serving. They even danced in rajasthani style. All this for free with the food, what else do you need!! Perfect for going with your office colleagues, families or loved ones. You'll really love it.

A great ambiance, combined with an excellent service is what I liked here. We went for the non-veg lunch and were instantly awed by the place. We went on December 31st, 2014, and there was a Bollywood theme for the occasion. What I particularly among the starters were the tandoori fish, the fish fingers and the mutton seekh. I did not try the main course as much as I would have liked for the simple reason that I had heard that their desserts menu was awesome. In the main course, I had pasta which was reasonably good. The desserts menu did not disappoint me as it had a combination of ice-creams (complete with chocolate, strawberry and mango (or was it pineapple) sauces), cheesecake, pastry, halwa, gulaab jamun and fruits (which i chose not to have). Overall, I liked it very much here.

This place had been bookmarked by me many days from now..and today ultimately i got to visit barbeque nation! This had almost become my dream restaurant,since the day i heard about it's positive reviews from my peers and they reviewed this to be the best place for having buffet in town. I have had buffet in many restaurants but to be really frank,i found this place the best of all. I wouldn't say that the ambience quite attracted me..the ambience of places like mainland china,machaan are more likely to attract you,but in terms of quality and variation of items..i bet no place can beat this! I went there with my family today for non-veg lunch buffet,we had to wait for 30mins since there was a huge queue..and people already waiting before us..after going inside i found out what was taking people so much time to eat. We were first seated beside the washroom,after complaining they readily changed our seat. We were seated comfortably..then they brought a charcoal grill on our table and started serving kebabs as starters. My goodness! How many variations of starters do they have..it would almost take people 40mins to finish off with only the starters! First they started with some sort of corn starter,then one by one all came..prawns,chicken,fish,mutton,some fish pakoras,3 sorts of chutneys and 3 sorts of sauces were already placed on the table. They were so hospitable that after every meal they were coming and asking us whether we liked their preparation or not. All the starters were just fabulous..then we started off with the main course which wasn't provided at our table. Mutton biriyani was simply awesome,the mutton almost melted in my mouth..the fish side dish was also good,the raita chicken salad,seafood salad,pasta everything was upto the mark. What i didn't like was the soup and chicken side dish,for which i deducted 0.5. I found the dish tasteless really. When they came to ask about the main course,i complained about the chicken and they were extremely sorry and were apologising so many times,then they said that they would cook the chicken again for me,they brought over the chef. I said i was totally full and couldn't have 1 more bite..they were sorry again and said that they would focus on the preparation to make it better. For desserts they had chocolate cake,custard,fresh fruits,whole chocolates and gulab jamun. All the items were extremely delicious. When my meal was over,they brought over chocolate brownie with hot chocolate sauce which was out of their list and said that it was a special preparation for me since i didn't like their chicken side dish. I was extremely elated since i am a huge fan of brownie. The way they take personal care of their customers is extremely rare and satisfying. Barbeque nation really won my heart and am really looking forward to my next visit here. Well done barbeque nation and keep up the good work!

Apart from sumptuous non-Veg starters, they also serve great veg starters‚Ä¶. Though the main course can be slightly average, but nobody cares‚Ä¶. Besides they have impressive desserts too.

Went here for an office gathering for lunch. Heard about this place many a times thus was a bit excited too, but it stood up to my expectations. The best part of this food endeavor was the FLAG UP &  FLAG DOWN. sheekh's and sheekh's of kebab came by.. Awesome kebab states. One can only have staters to fulfill their food desire, but then they also have these deserts to savour your sweet tooth. Enjoyed a lot.. Can select this place if want to treat somebody and value for money food.

The best place the serves buffet in the city is this restaurant, Barbeque Nation. The starters served here, both veg and non veg are just awesome. It's too delicious. They provide the best tandoor dishes in their starters. The main course consists of a wide variety of dishes and they are also outstanding. The ambience is perfect for couples, friends or colleagues. The administration takes great care of their customers and the chef himself comes down to take feedback about the food and tries to mend if there are any discrepancies. I just love this place.

Well, this is my favourite place . The food is very good ,service is excellent ambience is excellent. I have been to this place twice and always want to go back . The buffets are a bit higher priced but that's reasonable because no other place in kolkata offers such good quality food with so much variety. The restaurant is located in salt lake ,so the place remains busy with company folks enjoying meals every other day.
Its a must to visit this place for every food lover .

My first time in BBQN..was awsome. Had almost all typess of kebabs with numerous repeats. Liked the regular chicken one the most after that the prawn one and the tengri kebab.. Didn't like the mutton one personally.

Didn't have any space ¬†for main course, so settled with a bowl of chicken soup (with invisible chicken) just to kill time and make space for the dessert.¬†

Desserts were really good needless to say the halua or the ice cream all are really good.

The theme was bollywood so we encountered some funny item names but it was good and the ¬†srvice was really awesome.

In Barbeque Nation, if the crowd is heavy outside the door at 12:00, you can be rest assured that you cannot have your cake and eat it too.¬†
Pros:¬†
1. The Ambiance: Before we were taken to our tables, I took out some time to fully see the place. It feels like an old texas bar with a smell of grills and alcohol mixed together with audible music coming from the speakers over you.
2. The Service: Wow. Just Wow.
3. The Food (especially the starters): Of course it has a plethora of kababs to excite your taste buds. The starters are awesome.
Cons:¬†
1. The main course: Sheesh. That was a disaster the day I went. If there's a healthy crowd then the chefs have a hard time putting up with the amount of food, and hence you can see a little bit of quality deterioration.¬†
2. The desserts: Now my friend who always goes there promised me that this place is also known for its desserts, but the day I went, the desserts were not up to the mark.¬†

Would I go again: Yeahbsolutely! But I would rather pick dates on which the crowd wouldn't be too much for the quality to deteriorate.

This place does not even need a review. One of best restaurant in town. ¬†The ambiance is pretty amazing. You surely need luck to get the buffet at peak hour's . The starters are very good, though the service is slow. In the main course the biriyani is quite good, and mind you the portions are enough for 2 people. The decor is also very good. Highly recommended but before you go just call them and book a table.

Well Barbeque nation literally does not need any more reviews. It is already the most popular buffet in town. Having read those rave reviews on zomato and seeing some marvelous pictures finally went there for my birthday treat.

The ambiance is nice and its large enough to incorporate quite a large number of people. We went there on a monday and before 12:30 and so were lucky enough to have the non veg buffet at just 590 per head incuding taxes.

Coming to the food we had taken kingfisher strong alongwith the starters. The kebabs being grilled on the table in front of our eyes was a traet indeed. There were 5 non veg kebabas and 5 veg kebas. the non veg kebabs consisted of chicken, mutton,prawn,mushroom and fish. I personally did not feel like having those veg kebabs in fear of losing my appetite but they turned out to be very good. Apart from the five varieties there were other special ones too. Amongst the veg i especially liked the kashmiri veg kebab which was the day's special. Amongst the non veg ones the chicken tangri kebab was my personal favourite. Finally we had to put the flag down as a sigh that we had enough of the kebabs. My heart was telling me not to put down the flag but sadly my tummy disagreed.  The waiters were very very courteous and helpful. On my saying that the mushroom kebabs were a bit hard they apologised repeatedly and even offered me to have a second helping so that they could ensure that the new ones are to my liking. The chef himself came to us and said perhaps those mushrooms were not roasted properly.  I had to try those mushroom kebabs for a second time as they were requesting us repeatedly and very keen to make sure they were better than the previous ones and they actually were.

Then comes the main course. The waiter recommended the biriyani. However i was not in a condition to try it. Took a bit of rice and it did taste good,tried the pasta which was okayish. There were a lot of salads and other dishes of chicken which sadly i could not try due to stomach constraints.

Finally came the desserts. I longed to have everything at once. Had two helping of ice cream with chocolate sauce over it. The cute matkas containing firni were also good. There was a certain pudding the name of which i have forgotten. there were cute little gulab jamuns and chocolate cakes. I simply could not have enough of those desserts. But had to give up as i was too filled up.

The bill came up to be as low as 1180 for two ppl. Moreover they do not even take tips and returned the money politely.

Overall a great experience

food - 5/5

ambiance 4.5/5

service-10/5

value for money - 10/5

will be visiting again, again and yet again for those kebabs and desserts.

It was fun using the skewers! By the time I was through with starters I was full. But I tasted some of the items from the main course they were equally good. Next came the desserts. What an amazing spread! Blackcurrant cheesecake,hot tiny gulab jamuns,ice cream and everything else and all were exceptionally good.¬†Great place :)

Been here recently for the 3rd time and found many changes . They stopped giving welcome drinks , added a few dishes and taste of food have changed. Being the most popular buffet in town , the place is crowded and eventually the service has become sluggish and disoriented. The starters included 5 veg and 5 non veg . Among the veg starters , the CAJUN SPICED POTATO and KASHMIRI KEBAB were my favourite. Among the non veg , the HYDERABADI TANGRI and MUTTON PUDINA SEEK KEBAB were better tasting. In the maincourse the only dish that I found highly satisfying to the palate was FISH IN OYSTER SAUCE . Rest of the items were more or less ok. The desert included a variety of options out of which I liked the FRESHLY CUT FRUITS . Barbeque Nation has held its name high for a long time now and would love to see keep doing it.

One of the best option to have buffet in Kolkata, if you are Mughlai fan. The starter have serve ranges from Chicken, fish including prawn, mutton, mushroom, paneer and others. The serving is fast & prompt, and they will keep on serving unlimited starter, till you can have them. Few of the kababs are awesome.¬†
I've been to this place quite a number of times, and are pleased with the spreads they offer. In the main course, they generally serve veg & non-veg biriyani, a dish each with fish, mutton & chicken and an equal number of veg dishes, and a whole lot of salads.
At the end, if any portion of your stomach is still empty, you can indulge yourself with the dessert ranging from Ice cream, hot gulab jamun, few types of brownies and fruits

Though this will always be in my list, but after many visit, I find there starter are more or less the same without any variations.

We got our seats, the complimentary drinks (Beer/lime soda/iced tea/cold drinks) ws served n then the live grills on our table was on, and the starters were served!! The yummiest grill food I ever had!! Seriously the heavenly prawns, the grilled fish ,the chicken, the paneer, the corn never seem to end. They were delicious! About the main course, honestly I didnt have the appetite to eat anything else after the starters!! But yes there was a lot of dishes in both non veg n veg sections. The dum biriyani, sea food salad, mutton, lal maas,raita, hunan chicken etc etc. They were so yummy!! n hv a place left in your stomach fr the yummy desserts. The anguri gulab jamus, the mawa cake, the ice cream, the fruit cream,the fresh cut fruits, nut pie,phirni n the sevai was great!!¬†
Within a reasonable price u can have a delicious meal to fill your appetite!! The ambiance was quiet good, so are the staffs!! The chef himself came to ask for the feedback!! :)¬†

Lovely!!! Soothing atmosphere. Very calm and pleasant. The buffet is always very nice. ¬†The chicken and fish kebabs are soft and delicate. I like their dahi fuchka too. Desserts have a large variety. There is malpoa, hot gulab jamun, custard, gajar ka halwa and many more. I just wish they would change the stereotypical style of placing vanilla ice cream with brownie and chocolate sauce. Otherwise its perfect for a family gathering on occasions like anniversaries, birthdays and other celebrations.

After visiting more than 10 times, I have lost count of number of times I have been to this place. Now that I am writing the review, I must admit this place is heaven for foodies. Unlimited starter coupled with complementary drink (only during lunch time) makes the experience all the more enjoyable. I really liked the ambience, and specially the style where taking the flag down indicates stopping the starter. It's serene as long as the person supposedly called the singer does not take the stage. Have hardly taken main course as starter alone can satisfy one's needs. Irrespective of preference, please do try cajun potato. Simply incredible to say the least. Also gulab jamun with ice cream is a must try. Once In a while they do arrange street food fiesta where you can enjoy phoochka and jhaal muri. All in all a must try for everyone. In my opinion, Kaafila and barbeque nation are the top two contenders for best restaurant in Kolkata.

I went to barbecue nation to celebrate our 10th anniversary with my hubby n son.we booked the place exactly six days back n felt ourselves so wise to do that as the place was overcrowded. At least 15-20 families who dropped inwithout prior booking were waiting outside.it was almost 2.30p.m. when they closed taking names for lunch.
Coming to the food:it was our first occasion and we were safisfied to the core of our hearts.first came the complementary drink....lot of choices but we had aam panna.the starters were out of this world.since my hubby doesnt take any kind of meat,the options were limited him I requested them to serve a little of veg starters to him.they served both nonveg n veg starters to 3 of us......they even insisted on taking more varieties of them . occasionally they came in person to ask about the food quality n our choices n preferences. We only tasted a few from the main course spread as we were qt full with the starters.then came the surprise...they arranged for an anniversary cake for us at no extra cost....so nice of them.they even clicked a snap of ours,got a quick print n framed it for us  to make our day more special.we had vanilla ice cream with 3choices of sauces-chocolate,strawberry n pineapple.,angoori gulab jamun,slices of watermelon,some sweets from the dessert section.the best  gesture was that they refused to take any tip saying that it is against the company's policy..my hubby insisted a lot but failed.we would love to come back to bbq nation again and again n recommend everyone to have this experience at least once.

So we had decided to celebrate our first salary here tonight. It was an amazing experience. Great food, quality service and live music, all enjoyable with awesome company. The unlimited starters are all good. The fish delicacies were all very well cooked too. I'm a fan of starters and desserts so won't comment on the main course. Recommend it to all foodies who love buffet meals! :)

If you love chicken/fish/prawn/mutton and can gulp, this is the place to be! Absolutely amazing! Undoubtedly good kebabs of all sorts. Vegans might feel a bit out of place however the main course takes that away. Very good biriyani. However the deserts can be a let down. They prepare differently every day, so might be a good idea to ask over the phone whats on offer.

Perhaps the best rated restaurant in Zomato. Sunday lunch was perfect. Great starters and  deserts. You can skip main course, still no regret. Waited for almost 45 minutes, Sunday rush, but we knew that wait is worth.  Highly recommendable.

Recently I visited the much hyped BBQ Nation in salt lake, sector 5 kolkata.I should say the restaurant lived upto my expectation.the ambience was majestic with just the right amount of light...however the place was bit over crowded and the buffet is not at a very spacious location.the tandoori starters are quite delicious and they just keep on flowing.you can even ask for a customised starter from the chef with the choice of sauce and spice.i went there with one of my friend and sat for almost 2 hr.the food was very tasty and there was a wide variety in both non-veg/veg.the dessert section was ok with lot of stress on cakes and pastry.however, do try the hot gulab jamun (ice cream was missing ,which would had added the hit).

Great place to go for food lovers!!!!

If you're a foodie, YOU HAVE TO VISIT THIS PLACE.
If you manage to get hold of a table (its full on ALL 7 days of the week), you are in for an excellent experience.
Starters keep coming in and seem never ending. The options off the grill are good too. We specially liked the starter Dahi ke Sholay. After starters, if you have space left in your stomach, you can move on to the main course, which is equally good. Word of advice: save precious stomach space for desserts (Trust me its worth it and is essential for the complete Barbeque Nation experience). Desserts are amazing, specially the little gulab jamuns.
Nothing beats the Barbeque Nation experience. Period.

Whenever I am in sector 5, Salt Lake, I am in search of good restaurant as the place is full with lot of good restaurants which are never empty. Last week when was in the same place I saw Barbeque nation. The restaurant‚Äôs menu was quite attractive and tempting so I thought why not I should give it try. It was a first hand experience for me and couple of my friends. So we started with paneer naseman tikka and singaporian mushroom. Both the items were quite yummy all the ingredients cooked really well with each other. Though I personally loved the tikka. Then we ordered mutton till seekh kebab. The spice and meat simply melted in the mouth smoothly. Our next item was mutton dum biriyani with that we took methi murgh. We took hardly any time to finish the murg and rice. I took rice twice so did my buddies. We all love prawn so I ordered kasturi prawn which was simply delicious. I love chatting with my friends while having great food. And undoubtedly this restaurant fulfilled that comfortably. Lastly we had walnut cake with rabri and ice cream. Sweet item after any meal completes it.

I have been to this place four times and every visit the experience deteriorated . The menu never changes, which is kind of boring, they should rethink it once in a while, at least pep up their dessert choices. During my last visit, we got seated around 9.30 which is close to their closing time, the service was initially really slow and starters were not that good . Upon informing the manager they tried to serve some different varieties of starter but the quality was still not up to the mark. It did not really settle down well with me, especially because I vouched for this place and took my gang along, and the experience left a foul taste in our palate.

Barbeque Nation: The city‚Äôs one of the leading food joint which is just beside RDB Boulevard, Salt Lake Sec-5 , famous for its extremely delicious food. Finally it‚Äôs time to pen down my experience at BBQ Nation- the nirvana for a foodie. The ambience is great with soothing lights and comfortable seats. Coming to the food section straight way. 

¬†Starters: It was a graceful start with the kebabs and a complimentary drink (pick and choose from many). 6 varieties of starters which included Yorkshire lamb, Spanish Valencia Prawns, Albuquerque Atomic Chicken, Jamaican Jerk Chicken drumstick, Outback emu Chicken, Mighty Hot Mal Thai Fish. The Valencia prawns and the Thai fish were so superbly cooked that I repeated it many times. The chicken kebabs were delectable too but the one that stand above all was the lamb. It simply blew us with its flavor & juicy taste. After some rounds of starters we hopped towards the main course. 

Main Course : The buffet was wide spread with Gourmet Salad, Egg & Bean Salad, Raita, Pulao, Kashmiri Kofta ,  Chicken Soup, Mutton Dum Biriyani,  1 Chicken gravy and some more ( I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt recall all the names). Surprisingly I relished the veg dishes more than the non veg ones. ‚ÄòHeavenly‚Äô is the word perfect for them!! Do try the veg dishes atleast for once. 

Deserts: This was what I was waiting to gulp down. The desert section was loaded with fresh Fruits, Sliced Fruit Cakes, Bread and Nut Kheer, Brownies, Angoori Gulab Jamun, Vanilla Icecream served with 3 types of sauce and Firni. What else one could wish for ? We kept on filling our greedy stomach. :D The kheer and phirni just took us to a different world, the best that BBQ Nation placed at the desert section.

Service: All these heavenly dishes are complimented well with a pleasant service. The staff is always at their tip of the toes for any kind of help. Two thumbs up for them. 

It‚Äôs indubitably an astounding place for every foodie. It is to be kept in mind that if you are visiting it for the very first time don‚Äôt forget to reserve the table!!

Finally... visited Barbeque Nation. After going through the reviews of many fellow foodies decided to go there but every time I called up to hear that they were fully booked. But this time made the booking a week prior to my visit.

The kebabs were really very tasty specially the chicken kebab and the mutton sheek kebabs and the fried crispy corn.But the real delight for me was the prawn kebab which were just cooked to the perfection and the best ones I have had till date. The special marinades and dips complemented the kebabs nicely. Coming to the main course, the fried fish was my favourite. Then there was biriyani, butter chicken,  a mutton preparation and also a veg fare to explore, for which I hardly had much space left in my stomach. Finally for the desserts, there was Ice-cream, firni, cakes,gulab jamun. Overall too much was  offered for one meal and I ended up tasting only a spoonful of everything.
The service was also pretty good considering the rush they have. Definitely I will be visiting again to satisfy my craving for kebabs.

so coming to the food which was awesomee..on the grill we had those varieties of kebabs..and a drink of ur own choice in which we had aam panna and freshlime soda..i loved boti kebab,dorah kebab,chilly garlic prawns,and kasundi fish was a delicacy...each one was fingerlicking good..it fills ur tummy almost..and there was less space for the main food..

in the main buffet we had so much variety ..took pasta salads and other salads..nonveg dum biriyani,rarah gosht,fishfry ,butter chicken were very tasty..it was real good food..

and here comes the desserts which were extremely tasty..chocolate pastry is mind blowing, phirni,sheer korma, ice cream in chocolate sauce..angoori gulab jamun..were fabulous..u just cant miss those desserts..

loved the food..loved the service..staff were very attentive and they took care whether we liked the food or not which i liked..it worth that rush during any day of the week...i would like to go there again and again..awesome tasty food just made my day..!!!

One of the most fulfilling buffet experience in town. Right from the start to the finish, it was a great gastronomic indulgence. Have been there 4 times. Will be there again soon. Must try: the delightful kebab assortments,mainly the prawn ones. And desserts, anguri gulab jamuns are both visual and edible delights. So are the hot brownies and choco tart alongwith kesari firni and what not... So I must stop here.

Their kababs are the best in Kolkata. The thought of kababs drags me to this place everytime. Though the maincourse isn't that great but you know you would be so full eating kababs over the top that you would forget about the maincourse. I also loved their angoori gulab jamun. It melts in your mouth instantly.

Last time, I had been to this place for one of my closest friend‚Äôs birthday treat. So, the time we spent there, that was awesome. Talk about food, fun, service, value for money.. Ambiance was not that best.

***********************************************

Ambiance- 4.0

Food Taste ‚Äì 4.5

Location- 5.0

Service- 4.5

Value for money ‚Äì 4.5

********************************************

Ambiance- this place is quite a bit cozy and not very much spacious as they try to fit as much people as possible at same point of time. In this section only, I can think of some improvement and as I can see for last 3 years same seating arrangement. ‚ÄúChange is good if it‚Äôs for a better cause‚Äù, so they should trying that part.

Food- Mashallah‚Ä¶ Starters you can‚Äôt get better than here. The way they taste, three sauces on the table, olive oil, chilly, hot garlic prawns, chickens, and then baby corn (mind blowing), whatever they serve in starter, that‚Äôs the best. Hands down, no comparison. Main course, they change periodically with season preference and customers‚Äô choice, which is good but yeah other competitive vendors looking to cross this restaurant with taste of food then here is the area they should target. Biryani, Rice, Mutton, fish. Chicken, everything ok but not as good as it could be. Obviously, once you get best starters, your expectation gets higher (human nature). Then the dessert part, gulab jamun, ice cream etc etc. all are fantastic.

Location ‚Äì sector 5, 2 min from my office and 10 min from my room, what better can I get. Full marks from my side.

Service ‚Äì Talk about Pampering‚Ä¶ only one restaurant till date where a staff member comes and says ‚Äúsir, why aren‚Äôt you eating sir, we are bringing more, kindly finish sir..‚Äù like seriously who does that ???? May be my mom or my good relatives. I am a crazy fan of prawn items and one of the staff somehow realized that, mark my word- he was literally keeping an eye on my plate, whenever the prawns are off my plate, next batch of prawns are on the grill ready.. I did not get a single time when a piece of prawn is not present on my plate. And staff members give you space ÔÅä once you move to main course and dessert.

Value For Money ‚Äì undoubtedly,if you are a food lover, you can‚Äôt utter any bad words about this restaurant and you would have a smile on your face and tummy full of foods, full marks on this.

Barbeque Nation ‚Äì Thank you for the food quality and it does make us wonder how do you serve so much prawns in starters being so less price as compared to others. Keep up the good work. ÔÅä

This is the ultimate, always the 1st choice as a nearby restaurant from our office. It may be someone's birthday, anniversary or might be a team lunch. Not only me but our guys always prefer BBQ. Visited this place more than 15 times, so you can understand that this is my favorite restaurant.

The buffet is Kolkata's best buffet. All the starter items including veg and non-veg both are awesome. The specialty of BBQ Nation is their chef will ask you personally if you need something special or if you want to customize the BBQs. The main course is also very good with various combinations. And finally the desserts, one of my favorite especially the culfie stall, please don't miss that.

I was a regular once to BBQ nation. And I have been patronising this Kolkata outlet since 2009. 
It was superb and I loved the food and mostly the service. But lately, last 2-3 months, the service has deteriorated big big time. Twice I had to turn back disappointed having taken my family to lunch. The ushers actually cannot control the crowd anymore. Both on both occasions, after an excruciating wait, I had to leave. Surely would not visit again, no one would care as they do not care for good service anymore.
It is very disheartening to see such a wonderful place, becoming sub-standard by just poor management.

Had been there quite a offen. Most of the office parties of my life have taken place at this food-joint. To start with food I must say they prepare good, tasty and ample of starters. I hardly got chance to proceed to main course after finishing my starters. In the starters you can have prawns, sliced chicken which are served on the griller for barbeque. They serve motton as well as veg items in the starters too. I personally like the crispy fried corn which is also the part of staters. In the main course you can have biriyani, motton and chicken dishes; but hardly had the appetite for them after finishing the starters. Oh I fogot to mention that don't try the soups 'coz they taste yawk! Desert is full with sweets, pudding, pastries,fruits and ice creams. In a sentence, it is one stop destination to fulfill your appetite. Now coming to the cost, it's very reasonable compare to the quality and quantity of food they provide. The d√©cor of the resutant is awesome along their service.

Starting from the starters to the desserts. It seemed to be an endless journey. The unlimited spread beckons. 
Quality and Quantity is awesome.

Besides the giant main course deserves special mention.

Condition to visit Barbeque Nation: 

One needs to have urge to eat, appetite to have enough enough food, should completely be in love with food. 

It will be difficult to resist the temptation to visit the restaurant  again n again for the quality and quantity of food. 

Staff maintains best of etiquettes, customer friendly.

the grilled food tastes heavenly when you add sauces to them. Last time (may be 6-8 months back) when i went there, they had crab in starter which is missing now days.

Apart from that, the buffet is very well spread. But ¬†need to include rabbit, shark, duck, turkey.

Probably the best restaurant I have eaten in my entire life. Oh man were do i begin. The starters are simply heavenly. Be it the Tengri or the Reshmi or the Sheikh or the Prawn or the Fish, each and every Kebab are simply delicious. And the crispy sweet corn that they give goes amazingly well with Kebabs. I'm not much of a veg person but one thing i absolutely love are those small Aloo Tikki, they are just too good!!! I personally feel that the main course falls a bit flat in comparison to the starters, that doesn't mean that they are bad. They are pretty good but the do lack the punch and the "WOW" factor of the starters. The Biriyani is a must try though. And now the desserts, it is just blows you away with its variety and taste. Mousse, Custard cakes, Brownie, Ice cream with two topping (I generally like Brownie with ice cream chocolate sauce and i guess its a raspberry sauce, Firni(absolutely amazing), ¬†Hot gulab jamuns, and fresh fruits.
I'm not gonna say it a definite must try cause everyone who doesn't live under a rock knows it.¬†
I have been to this place more times than I can remember, but would i like to visit it again, Yes obviously again and again. I simply love this place and i eat like a monster when i come here and I'm not ashamed of it.

A family favorite, Barbeque Nation has never failed to deliver on its quality & spread. The non veg starters are out-of-the-world. I somehow have a liking for their Biriyani, in the main course. The Firni & Angoori Gulab jamuns are yummy!
Make sure you go there with a prior reservation, else you'll be left waiting hungry for eternity!

Oh the food! Lovely as you can term it. The buffet consisted of barbeque serving that almost filled my tummy. The chicken, and prawn barbeques are worth mentioning. Littles bits of happiness, as I would term it to be. After we turned down the barbeque indicator, we moved to the main course section consisting of chicken biryani, Russian salad, mutton preparations, along side a range of delicacies to keep your taste buds moving. The choco layered cake as well as the mixed fruit pudding was the ultimate delight.
PS: as it was my birthday, they offered me a complimentary cake and the the vocalist wished me a happy birthday song. A day well spent. Thank you BBQ Nation.

Best buffet ever. I wish the flag never goes down for this restaurant. It's a personal favourite of all the college gangs. The chef is so thoughtful of whatever your starter preferences are,which goes a long way in making the experience memorable. Kudos!

Awesome Spread. Serves north Indian cuisine mostly n buffet. They have an array of kebabs served on live grills on the table itself. Don't miss out on the sauces served along with the kebabs. They serve prawns, fish, chicken, mutton,corn etc. The main course consists mostly of biryanis, rotis made on Demand, lots of vegetarian dishes,salads,chicken n mutton side dishes.
I love their dessert spread. Hot gulab jamuns, kheer,mousse, brownie, ice cream with many choice of toppings, firni.
One of the best buffets in Kolkata

Its a place for people who can digest a lot of stuff in a very shot time.
This place has good interiors to go with the great staff. Its probably the most fitting buffet in town for gluttonous people :P, the starers never cease to arrive and most of the times you will rarely care for whats in the main course, believe me if you are a normal person you will not have any space left in you for the main course after all the delicious starters they have to offer. 
The main course is as like all the other buffets in town are minimal.
There are a lot of options in the desserts section you if are capable trying it out, you will like it.
Overall this place is great if you are really hungry and feel like eating the world without puncturing your wallet.

Its a shame that a foodie like me didn't get a chance to visit this awesome place. Visited the place for the first time yesterday and instantly fell in love! The decor was good! I wasn't very lucky with the music though, but it is just no reason to dislike a place. If I gotta rate it in terms of food and service, its just 10 on 10. Would love to visit again! In love with Barbeque Nation! If you are a foodie, you aught to land there!

Heard a lot of this place and finally got to visit the place recently while attending a team lunch with colleagues. And honestly I was blown over. From the mouth watering kebabs to their elaborate main course, finishing off with delicious desserts, it was truly a sumptuous spread. And what I liked most was their service quality and always ready to help staff. the kebabs and the tandoor require special mention though. For deserts the cheese cake and chocolate pastry were too good. In the main course, the mutton could have been a bit softer though. Will certainly like to visit again.

Simply awesome place. Courteous attendants, with great prices skills. Will make you feel like a treasured and  valued customer. Nice decor and ambience. The food, especially starters (both veg & non-veg) are superb. In the main course they noticed that we had taken very little byriani. So, they came and asked us if something was wrong. When we said the byriani was a bit oily for our taste,  they brought us a separate serving of oil-fired byriani with 10 to 15 minutes. 
the deserts were awesome too and by the end of the meal we were feeling like royalty. The price is on the higher side,  but considering the food and service, it's great. 
Cons: You need to make a reservation well in advance or else you'll have to wait for a long time to get a table.

This is my go to place !! 
Be it for a birthday party or anniversary celebration or family get together. This is the place you'll find me.
Their buffet is marvelous.
They start with butter corn. Followed by the kebabs. There is chicken,mutton,fish and prawn. The paneer kebabs are mouth watering and so are the mushrooms.
After the appetisers,comes the entr√©e.
With soup,biriyani,dal,paneer,chicken,mutton and chingri. It is a complete wow.
And last but not the least, the desserts complete the splendid meal. They have fresh cut fruits,gulab jamun,mishti sandesh,ice cream,firni,cake and brownies.
Their hospitality makes it a wonderful experience. 
I would go there again and again.

If food is a religion. I would say this one's a pilgrimage, the holy shrine of desi taste. Go and get a binge. Don't even dare to think to check your diet. Raise your 'flag' get... set...  and go. Now break upon the sumptuous Kebabs. Your plate will get overloaded with bunch of varieties. They serve at least eight different types of kebab in the buffet. Get yourself a complimentary pint of beer and dip into this magical trail. So now after you have reached the summit of starters you can now put the flags down and 'surrender'. But that's just the beginning, like the first session of a test match. Then comes the main course. Move a bit and savour another round of mouthwatering dishes. The 'meateatarians' would definitely try out the veggy delights. Actually, now you tend to think which one to take. You are already so full. But hang on, the desserts aren't touched yet. From gulabjamuns, firnis, ice creams, soufles, aaah... it's an action pack game that you need to conquer. Don't just worry about the pocket. I bet you, it's  ultimate vfm. Lastly when you are done.. the taste just lingers on and on.

Brilliant..brilliant and just brilliant..

Starters: Delicious will be an understatement. Around 12 types of starters. Thou personally I have always preferred prawn starters.

Main course: Very difficult to have them after loads of starters.

Dessert: Too GOOD! Ice cream, sweets, custards, fruits, pastry..WHAT NOT !!

Hospitality: The BEST one can expect! They would come and ask you how was the food, whether anything needs to be changed etc. If you want to change taste/spiciness of any starter then they would LOVE to do that for you.

Been there 6 times. More to go !!!!!!

I have never written a review for Barbeque Nation before (even after numerous visits to all the branches of this fabulous restaurant in Bangalore). But for the first time we had the opportunity to visit it in Kolkata. 

There is really nothing to write about the quality, quantity and service etc of Barbeque. It is undoubtedly the no.1 buffet restaurant in India.
 But, I must admit that they are becoming exceedingly good at their job day by day.¬†
We went to Barbeque during the diwali weekend (for Sunday lunch) without prior reservation. There was a mad rush and we were told that we would have to wait for at least an hour. We kind of expected that to happen. However, the good thing was that they were specific about the waiting time. Did not make false promises and did not make us wait more than the promised time. Also offered us complimentary soft drinks while we were waiting.¬†
Finally, when we got our table, the service was super fast. We were hungry and in a no-nonsense mood. We started gobbling up the non-veg grilled starters. We told the waiters that no veg items should be served (we are strictly NON-Vegetarians :) ) and we did not have to repeat the instruction again. During that weekend, the "Grill the World" festival was going on at Barbeque and all the grilled starters had a distinctly different flavour. The prawns tasted out of this world!. This was a pleasant surprise. One's taste buds may get a little  bored after numerous Barbeque sessions in the past. But due to the subtle variations, it did not happen this time.

Normally, we never concentrate on the main course in Barbeque. But this time it was different. Starting from the heavenly chicken broth to the mouth watering Biryani.. everything seemed perfect. We were cursing ourselves as we had too much of starters and were left with no space in our stomachs for the main course.

Finally we ended our ¬†lunch with a plateful of desserts and a very happy mind.¬†

The staff were extremely courteous and prompt throughout our 2.5 hr session...and they do NOT accept TIPS!!!

That's why we visit Barbeque! For a gastronomical extravaganza extraordinaire! :)

A MUST VISIT PLACE FOR ALL FOODIES.I visited this place with two more foodie friends who can gorge.Starting with great ambience, the moment you enter this restaurant you will start feeling hungry.The main attraction of this restaurant was their kebabs be it chicken,prawn,mutton,fish or fruit,they just melted in our mouth.Serving was prompt.We were almost full for the main course but we still managed to taste chicken biriyani which was again great.Coming to dessert,there couldn't be a happier ending to this gala meal.Firni,gulabjamun,pineapple pastry,watermelons,ice cream with chocolate sauce and lots more to finish with.No pinch in pocket.Will visit again.

This is the first time that i am writing any review, was actually forced to by the service quality & feel good factor. We visited Barbeque Nation for lunch on 26th Oct'14 to celebrate my sister's birthday. We have nothing to say regarding the food quality as it is simply excellent. What really mattered for us were:
1. The chef himself came upto ask us and all others persent table-wise regarding the food quality, service & whether we have some suggestions on any aspect
2. The manager came next to ask whether we were there to celebrate some occasion...to which i immediately informed regarding the occasion, i.e. my sister's birthday. We completed the buffet course and requested for the bill when the manager presented us a cake with a candle to mark the occasion. We were totally taken aback seeing this. He then clicked a picture with all of us together in their camera and when we were about to leave, this picture was presented framed in a Barbeque Nation photo-frame.
Have celebrated our special occasions in several restaurants in and around Kolkata, but never have we felt this warmth. The guesture really means a lot...

This is by far the best restaurant i have ever been to. I love eating out...so every second day, we dine out..out of the numerous restaurants i have been to, this completely bowled me over. Firstly,  the food id par excellence.  Both in terms of quantity and quality. They served at least 10-11 starters. They even served non spicy starters for my 3years old son. That did it for me. Secondly,  hospitality. This is actually what won my heart. The staff was making an effort to come to our table and ask for our feedback. They served around 10 to 12 dishes in d main course and around 7 to 8 in desserts. Lastly, they dis not take any tip...they refused saying its not allowed...the valet parking person also refused to accept tip... i recommend this place to everyone... it would cost u around 750 wid tax... i absolutely loved the whole experience

There's nothing new to share about the unbeatable stature that Barbeque Nation, so i'll just go ahead and share an experience of mine..
It is one of those many times that I went for lunch to this place. We are almost near the end of our staters and thinking to bend the flag with an over-filled belly, when the chef comes to us and asks how was the food. Well there is nothing to complain about the food, so instead i tell him that the mutton item is same eveytime I visit, and its getting boring. So he asks me to suggest any mutton items that i would like. I take a leaf out of the movie Ratatouille and say to him, "surprise me" ;)
What followed was really impressive.. Within 15 mins they prepared a new item of mutton and served us to taste.. 

To servise like that, hats off.!!

Being one of the most widely visited restaurants (in recent times), this place has made its mark in its own way by serving the best grilled food and Kebabs one can ever have in Kolkata. Its undoubtedly the best buffet restaurant in Kolkata. The best thing 'bout the place are the Starters and the Desserts (not that the Main course is bad or something)! I believe, the best way to enjoy Barbeque Nation is jumping from starters to dessert (skipping the main course). The unlimited supply of Kebabs is main USP of the restaurant. If someone likes to hog on their food, then this place is a must visit! :D 

Now, lets talk 'bout some other stuffs. The ambiance was good. But  what I really loved is their prompt service and excellent hospitality.They even bring the Chef at each table to ask 'bout your likes and dislikes! Lastly, all I can say is this place is worth every penny! I'm definitely looking forward for my next visit! :)

My "oh so delicious" first time happened on 21|10|14. I heard about this place for numerous times from equally many number of people.
Well the one liner review would be : "The joint exceeded my expectations, which was kinda huge"
Still I would write a short, to the point review.
Toppings:
1. Before even mentioning the food I would like to mention their extra ordinary service. The way everybody runs that extra mile to earn your satisfaction is truly commendable. It just can't be described in words. Just visit and get enlightened.
2. I have never had such kebabs. Those were delicious. Certainly the best Kolkata can offer not to mention the variety of 'em.
3. The ambiance was truly superb. Its still carrying world cup vibe. The music was soothing and was accentuating the feel good factor.
4. If u know the right dates & times then this could be quite economic provided you are a great eater, cuz trust me u will learn a new definition of the proverb "I'm full" when u drag yourself out from the restaurant.

Downers:
Gotta be nitpicking to find a downside of my experience. But if I push my cynic self a bit too much then I would say the main course wasn't that great compared to starters and desserts.

I will rate the place 5 kebabs.

EDIT* revisited after a year on 04/10/15...and if it was possible I would have given another 5 stars to this place.

There are already 964 reviews available of this place, So one more review won't make much a difference. :)
So I just want to share my experience of food, decor, hospitality ¬†and ambience of arguably Kolkata's most widely visited restaurant.¬†
The buffet spread here is excellent starting from the starter to the desserts. Although I opted for a Non-vegetarian buffet, but still served the vegetarian spread as well. The opening corn Kebab, the alu tikki kebab, the mushroom Kebab and the mix vegetable Kebab were all very good from the Veg platter. The non-veg spread was equally delighting with the Prawn Kebab being the best. The accompanying dips make the whole starter experience more enriching.¬†

I didn't spend much time in the Main course section. There are lot of options but after a heavy starter intake, didn't feel the urge to gorge into them.¬†

The desserts experience took me to a new high. With options ranging from Fresh fruits, Gulab Jamun, Kheer, Firni, Browniesand four choices of ice creams made me indulge in them more and more, even though my tummy started to give in.¬†

The best part of dining here is their warm hospitality. The staffs take care of their guests in the best possible manner . They literally pamper you and coerce you to taste various items. They offer to make the dishes more suitable to your taste by asking again and again, if any change in preparation of the starters should be made.

The ambience is bright, the decor has been made perfectly suitable for a cozy dining experience. They keep on changing their theme ans so changes their interior.¬†

Now come to the pocket pinch. The pricing is reasonable enough. You can reduce the pocket pinch by being a early bird here. It's always advisable to book a table here or reach early as this place does not go empty even in a Monday noon.¬†

So here are my ratings :-
Food--4.5/5
Ambience--4/5
Staff behavior--5/5
Pricing--4/5
Overall-----4.5/5

For all people who can gorge, this is paradise for you. Barbeque Nation is that restaurant which serves a grand buffet with an array of desserts and delicacies. This place is only for those who have a humongous stomach. If you want to relish the Main Course, you have to trim your appetite for Kebabs. The grills are well done, the Kakori Kebab was sinful. The mains usually have a choice of soup, and substantial amount of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. It is a bit cumbersome to describe each and every dish, because their offerings are very dynamic. 
But nonetheless, they serve some authentic bengali preparations, which might be an added bonus. 
Its worth the money, provided you CAN EAT. And much better than Sigree-Flame and Grill and Sigree- Global Grill.

Shall I write a review? Shall I not?

I wonder why I'm so late in writing a review for BBQ nation. The place continues to be one of my favourites in the town. The kababs are superb, main course is good (unusually good for a buffet actually) and the desserts are simply awesome. The chicken kababs have deteriorated a bit over the times but the fish kababs these days pretty much compensates for it. The Biriyani is quite good, rest of the main dishes I hardly ever tried (since I'm too full by then). The desserts include the likes of Firni, Caramel custard and hot gulab jamun and many others. A huge thumbs up!

Splendid, outstanding,terrific, extraordinary.....I am falling short of adjectives in praise of BBQ Nation. It was my first visit to the restaurant and it was the best experience I ever had in any restaurant. We went on a weekday for lunch. The international food festival was going on at that point of time. The barbeque grill was placed on the table and the waiters started serving starters one after the other.¬†
¬† ¬† ¬†Starters: Yorkshire Lamb, Spanish Valencia Prawn,Chicken Drumstick,Mal Thai Fish and a couple of other starters. We didn't want to have the veg starters lest our stomachs get full, but the waiters requested us to taste those as well.I could have never imagined servers urging customers to eat more at an unlimited buffet.
¬† ¬†Now coming to the main course, there was Murg Dum Biryani which is not like the usual biryani you have at other restaurants. It contains less spices. Then there was mutton rogan Josh, Fish in Hot basil sauce, Mexican Chicken and another fish item. Advantage of choosing Non-veg buffet is that you can have the veg items as well. But you would too full to taste those items. There are four choices of bread-Plain roti,Tandoori Roti, Plain Nan, Butter Nan which were served on the tables.
¬† ¬†Desserts! Heavenly! Anguri Gulab Jamun was perhaps the best. They were being boiled in a non-stick container kept over an induction cooker.Then there was mawa slice cake, walnut brownie, firni, and ice cream with chocolate puddings.¬†
¬† All these for Rs.590. Very reasonable pricing I must say and the most surprising aspect is that they refuse tips politely :) Service was too good. While serving starters they ensured that the grill was full of varieties ofkebabs. Every 10mins the waiters would come on the table and ask our opinion regarding the quality and taste of food and whether they can make any improvements.This kind of concern is extremely commendable and I hope this does not fade with their ever increasing popularity.

Had been there one & half year ago for dinner buffet with my colleagues. Once you be there you won't regret your decision for entire life. For food I will give them 5 on 5. Its just awesome especially starters. Ambiance & service is equally good (4.5 on 5). I will recommend every foodie to go there at least for once.

One of many visits, few changes I noticed today comparing to my last one on early this year. First of all, Mutton Biriyani (which was really good) replaced by Chicken, not much variations on buffet from my last visit.

The fish (Basa) tandoor item was not good. They served a preparation with lamb which was pretty good and chicken tandoor items are also good in average but no variations.I remembered, last time we enjoyed the ambience and the food more than today.

BBQ Nation serves the best of starters..no doubts. From prawns to fishes, or from chicken to mutton, they would continuously help you indulge. Main courses though are not good, but great starters and deserts more than make up for that..

it was always on m wishlist to go to Barbeque Nation in Kolkata as i have only been there at Bangalore where i got to taste the seafood festival few years back. few days back it was on my birthday 13th of October'14 me and my wife went there to have dinner after our office. No doubt that the food and the service is too good, but just as we say in the corporate world " Serve the client more that his expectation" I myself have received that kind of service there. The person Mrinal who attended us is the restaurant, i informed him that it was my birthday and asked that if he can arrange for a pastry and a candle so that we can start of with the meal cutting the cake for my birthday, he instantly arranged that, moreover he said he has asked the chef to prepare a fresh cake for me, which was also served while we were having the desserts. More over they helped me take few pics of us in my camera to capture those moments. suddenly another guy of the restaurant came up with the camera and took our pic, i thought it was taken for them to post it in their site for their promotion, but within few minutes they came up with that pic printed and framed and gave it to me. i was so happy and exited. At my age it is not that i celebrate my birthday but on ¬†that day Barbeque Nation made it so grand and i really felt so special. I went on the Monday the rates were discounted, and since me and my wife was so happy ¬†that i wanted to give good amount of tip, but there also they honestly said that they do not take tip as they charge service charge in the bill which is quite low than the amount of tip i was planning to offer. Now talking about the food, starters like fish and prawns were amazing, Dal makhani, mutton rohan josh was really good, and had a plate full of desserts. Thank you Mrinal@Barbeque nation for making that day so special for us. i have been to Flame and Grill but compared to the price the quality of food and the service was extraordinary. Hope to visit more and more. Few pics attached taken on that day

I have been to this place numerous times ,even then i never miss an opportunity to visit again.This is the best place to go for a sumptuous treat....be its yours or your friends (its better when friends pay  ;)  ).
Nonetheless,a great place for even a connoisseur,barbeque nation lives upto every standard that you can probably think of. 
Every kebab that they serve can be requested to be made as per your taste.And don't ever complain about a food,else they might feed you to death :P
The service is the best that you will get in any restaurant at this price range or even more.
Every dish has its authentic taste,flavor and aroma. Try going to this place during a festival that they host quite frequently,as the already big never ending menu becomes even larger.
The anguri gulab jamuns deserve special mentioning. I always save a large portion of my appetite for this,which taste even better in combination with the vanilla ice cream and chocolate icing.
In short this place is simply heaven for gourmets.

So don't think twice before going to this place...just dive into their utterly delicious irresistible dishes...trust me,its so good value for money,you will willingly pay much more than what they charge you....bon appetit :)

What should i say when everyone knows its food and quality and quanity. No one is comparable to this buffet. Only the concern is the place is too small and overcrowded. Also the reception counter is just at the front of the entrance with people who cant manage queue. So whoever is having shouting his name first is being served first.

on 7th of oct'14,¬† I wished to have sme kababs in my lunch, so flame & grill was on my mind as i visited their twice before and their service is quit good. 

On the mean time one of my friend suggested to try out BBQ, Saltlake.
so as per his suggestion i visited the place for lunch.

Decoration was quit good with flags of different nations. Welcome to the guest was quit good.¬† 

Food - The starters - kababs were awesome¬† we filled our 80% of our space with the starter. 

Main course was also gd but i tried out paratha and mutton only which was gd.

The deserts ranks second after the kababs as the gulab jabun was awesome. 

I will surely visit BBQ next time and will recommend u to visit.

It gives a tough competition to Flame & grill.

It's been on my wishlist for quite sometime now and finally been there, done that. Well to tell the truth I did go once there but it was completely booked so this time I booked for lunch beforehand. And as expected it was awesome.

Loved the starters, especially mutton tikka, chicken tikka and prawn, so much so that later I regretted upon having tasted the veg starters. But my sister did love the kajun potato. 

The must try for main course was the chicken, the biriyani and the paneer. The mutton was not well done that day.

I did try to taste everything in dessert section. My most fav was obviously the angoori gulab jamun. Other than that I liked the Mexican pie and ice cream.

Enjoyed every bit of it and after such an exceptional choice of meal they gave a choice in mouth fresher too.

P.S. : For someone who doesn't know, always, always, always get reservations.

Barbeque Nation has always been a benchmark for buffet to me. Have been here couple of times. But the review never got written. Anywas, let me start. Yesterday I was in barbeque nation for a team dinner. We reached there before 7pm to avail the early birds offer. For that we had already booked out table a day advance. A food festival was going on. Pat Chapman the famous London based cook has designed the menu for the day. The mood was set, the ambience was energetic and our position of the table was awesome, just by the singers' dias. Grills started, chickens grills shrimps fishes. I cannot recollect all the names of the menu, but they were all mouth licking good. The fish grills were soft and juicy. The shrimp preparation was with wine. Was perfect! Since I don't take meat, i cant comment but based on the feedback it must be awesome. Ya i week say here, if you don't take meat like me, the options will be bit limited. But the servers wil ensure you get enough repeats of the fish items and will check with chef if some other items could be made.
 The musicians were awesome! West life, back street boys, savage gardens name it, was there in their menu :). 
Reluctantly we had to bend the starter flag as we were just full after an hour of starter. Sluggishly we moved for the main course. Some of my friends jumped directly to the desert :). Any way meeting with the tradition, i started with the soups and some rice with other items. But seriously we were just full. With the customary main course dining, time for dessert. It had gulab jamun, casanta, brownies, firnies and some other international items. Sampled each of them. Were yummy and great! 
After one and half hour dinner when we left the resturent, tummy satisfied looks were beaming from all's face and for the resturent folks it was just another day at office!

I am a foodie, I prayed for good food and God answered me through BBQ Nation. till date have been there for 4 times. Each time I ate more than my capacity and came out almost crawling as my legs refused to carry my weight. Staffs are also very nice. I love the personal touch when the chef visits and ask abt the food. Every day there is a different menu. I wish I got my hands (or tongue!!) on the crispy golden corn and prawn kebab (for got the variety) once again. The small gulab Jamoons are so awesome that u will forgive your worst boss even, when u are eating them.

I am so glad that Barbeque Nations has gained such popularity of late. In between the burtling crowd at sector 5, this restaurant has the ambaince worth every penny! The grilled chicken, prawns, fish, paneer and veggies are delicious. The mashed potato that they serve is divine. The main course gives us decent options but the star of the place is the dessert platter! I love the firni, malpoya and small gulab jamuns served hot! The extraordinary part of the place is the lovely live music played by some talented musicians at a corner. It gives you a westernized feel contrasting the Indianized cuisine. Very well behaved and efficient staff. A must visit place this is!

An addition to my review, went to this place last night on my mum's bitthday. Was impressed by the treatment.. food.. Pat Chapman's exquisite dishes.. especially the Lamb dish.. the complimentary birthday cake was out of the world And the instant framed family photo that they gifted us was very sweet indeed! What made our night memorable was the music . He sang to the tunes of Oldie hits and birthday song dedications.. on my request he sang Vincent, Jamaican farewell, Cant help falling in love and more. From my last night's experience, the 4.5 shoots up to 5!!!

The drinks and cocktails on the menu are impressive. It's a tad bit noisy but then again there's a lot of energy you will like...Great place to be with friends... One amazing thing about BN is that their food is same and perfect in any location, be it Ahmedabad, mumbai or Calcutta! Dont know how they do this but it is simply amazing.

Must try: Crabs and Prawns!!! And the Pineapple and Mushrooms!!! Simple heaven!!

Advice: Carry some Hajmola. You will definitely over eat when in BN. ;-)

The food tasted not awesome but awefully awesome. I guess they should had named it 'Royal Barbeque'. 'Mishti doi'....yummy and the rosogolla...akdomsa authentic. 

Ambience is somethimg will attract you besides the food. Well behaved people around you and always ready to help you. Okay I am hungry again :-P . A good place for a good luncheon with family and friends.

I was happy to find them handling the crowd pretty well. Their manager was well behaved to be very attentive. However, they really don't care to act on whatever they hear, as they are located in an office area and are sure to attract a lot of local IT cattles who will flock in like idiots.

They can improve the spread in their main course and offer a delightful dessert spread.

Avoid office lunch hours for value of your money otherwise be a part of the office cattle herd and waste someone's money and your time making the restaurant owner rich.

Its the most wonderful restraunt to which I have ever gone.Have been to Flame and Grill and other buffet restraunts earlier but Barbeque Nation just bowled me over.The ambiance : Excellent Lighting , Excellent music...Seating arrangements awesome..The tray arrangements of the buffet and the overview of the kitchen where the kebabs getting grilled provides excellent ambiance. Food: Over the top of mind. Quality of the food and the taste is just mind blowing. Grilled food at its best. Service: Never will find a group of better managers. They will ask you for every / any problem / addition you are having or you want to your food..They will prepare you anything special outside the menu that might suit your taste buds.A very personalised care.Complimentary drinks within the price tag.A very satisfying outing with the family to Sunday Brunch of Barbeque Nation.Have been earlier also.And will definitely be returning with friends during the pujas.Keep it up Barbeque Nation...We Foodies love it large in quantities and taste.

Friday nights are always eagerly waited,but this one was different. We planned for a "self-treat" in bbq nation and our eagarness for friday night became unbearable. Had to wait for about 1 hr to get a seat inside,but once we got one, it was just tooo good. Especially the jamaican jerk fish was out of this world. Though the cost was a bit high, but still the food was worth the hole in the pocket..

People have written a lot about this place and indeed it's really worth the praise. Let me first come to the cons the mutton delecacies were not upto the mark they lacked flavour,  the biryani was also not very good other than this the main course was good. Now the starters all of them were mouthwatering especially the prawn kasundi,  chicken tengri and pineapple kabab,  the crispy potatoes were equally good.  A must try is kosa potol, jhinge posto and khatte aloo. The salads have different flavours so is a real treat fresh fruits are a must as they act in re-energizing your taste buds. The deserts very good not great try vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and angoori gulab jamun its just delicious. The service is undoubtedly one of the best I've seen it's like the Bangali 'jamai-adoor'

Barbeque Nation is certainly one of the best places you can visit if you are looking for a buffet menu within Rs 800/-. Famous for its grills, it scores very high when it comes to the quality of starters they serve (they could improve on the vegan side), the ambiance is good (enjoy your dinner while the band plays) and certainly the hospitality of the crew is something you would definitely appreciate.



Generally the starters contain a range of kababs of chicken, fish and mutton. The veg dishes include starters with paneers, potatoes, baby corns etc. Main course contains a lot of variety too, but by that time you would have very little space in your tummy. As far as the desserts are concerned, the gulab jamuns will keep you busy.



Only thing where they could improve on is having a bit more variety in there starters, which ofcourse is great for people visiting for the first time, but becomes a touch monotonous for people like me who visit often. 



Visit this place with your friends, your family, your spouse. You will not be disappointed. :)

Been there couple of times when I'm in Kolkata and love the ambiance of the place. Unlimited Kebabs, soft music and good food. ¬†Its a good place to be with family or out on a causal date night with husband. I have been here numerous times and always had a pleasant evening.¬†

It would hard to pin point a specific ¬†set of dishes. Most of the food they serve are really good.

This restaurant ¬†undoubtedly falls in the category of THE BEST restaurants in Kolkata, if you are up for Buffet lunch or dinner and you are in love with Kebabs and all. Super-duper-delicious, mouth-watering starters, top amongst all restaurants in this category like Flame n Grill or Sigri etc. We went for Buffet lunch and they started exactly at 12:00 o'clock (which was their scheduled time). Absolutely fantastic service. We didn't wait for even a single second. It gets finished and within glimpse of eye , our plates are full with food. They offered Chicken Kebab, Mutton Kebab, Special chicken sausage, Roasted Chicken leg-pieces, Prawn Kebabs. There were some veg dishes as well ( I mostly don't remember those, as I'm a pure non-veggie :P). I din't touch main dishes, but they were equally good as I heard from my colleagues. And some wow desserts! there was firni, gulab jamun, fruit custard, and some other sweets. Gulab jamun was best among these. Absolutely loved it. Cost was also reasonable ( Rs. 587/- per person including tax in happy hours), if you compare with other restaurants ¬†of its likes.

P.S. : I strongly recommend everyone that if you plan to visit here, go for Buffet. And for the first timers, don't waste your hunger by eating out main dishes. Keep Calm and Eat Starters ( and a bit of desserts) only ! :D

With an intention of having the grilled kababs, I along with my fiance went to barbeque nation after a hectic day.
Buffet for dinner...
Sounds simple...
But to my surprise i got a lot of positivity inside this place. A beautiful, simple but crowded place. Whether it's about reservation for our table, the food, courtesy of staffs... Everything is so so good about Barbeque Nation. We get to hear beautiful numbers from the live band itself.
Little gestures really brings smile on one's face... And that's what this place does to us. Chef coming and asking about the dishes... And if something is missing in any of the items, they make sure to give afresh items of the menu. Food is great. The hot garlic fish is the hot item. Prawn kabab, and what mouthwatering deserts...!!! :)
I simply love this place.
The only thing I want t to add is the complimentary drink in the 'Dinner buffet' so that one need not to pay extra to have to that. Otherwise it's definitely a delight for me and my family...!!!
Thanks...!!! :)

The buffet spread however could improve but once again its the kebabs that will make you visit the place over and over again.... 
P.S try the desserts it's just awesome....

BIG NEWS: THEY ARE COMING AT 24 PARK STREET ADDRESS LATER THIS MONTH.
I am writing the review on this restaurant after making a visit for uncountable times. Because it 'was' one of my favorite place. Not now. This is simply because of their regular course of buffet menus which I feel needs an immediate innovation. Though under this rate, they are offering great food. Most favorite part of their spread is the dessert section which I love like anything. ¬†The ambience is good specially after 7PM. The prawns are dry and hard. Chickens were spicy and ordinary. But the staffs are amazing. Biriyani was good too, usual kind of. But the dessert is rocking. I drool over the gulabjamuns the most. I love having them with a dollop of ice cream. Try it. Its fun. New introduction is the kulfi counter and liked this very much.. Oh the taste spells perfect in mouth with the toppings you want. Mango, kesar pista, malai, strawberry, chocolate kulfis were on offer. The vegan buffet had no stopping in options too.
I wrote in the review to introduce something authentic bengali which is my demand.¬†I may not visit in near future as my taste bud asks me to try something new every time.

Grilled food haven! Main course is a little weak when Its comes to the vegeterian options. But the grilled food is to Die for. Overall ambience is average cos u have to Keep requesting diferent stewards for a particular item.  At Times you have to Ask 10 Times to serve a particukar option. Maybe the place is crowded all the time so the non attentive staff. But grilled food is good.

So this was someplace I was craving for..and had regrets , that how did I give this place a miss everytime for some reason or the other...  HOWEVER ..I did not feel too bad after having a office dinner here.... To put it simply it's not that.. It was not good, but wasn't the best either... Part of this judgement may arise because of the huge expectation I had while I entered it's premises... Thestarters were good..but I heard they had cut down on the main course to a great extent... The ambience and behaviour was good.... But the starters were too mainstream for my likings... I thought its just a tad little overhyped...not definitely the best I have ever had... But the desrts deserve a mention!! I entered with the feeling that.. May be my wait is over now... But went out feeling that I certainly had better than this before..why is there such  a buzz around this place??

Loved it each time I went there. .

spectacular ambience ,wonderful staff and service, good food..all the right areas .ticked!!
one of the rarest places in Kolkata where we ¬†vegetarians wont feel that the options are limited..

would surely recommend this. .

the only negative point is that they need to change their menu frequently!! becomes boring after a second visit!!the kababs are awesome!!the main course is average tat is if ur not stuffed enough after the starters!! but their briyani is likeable!!make sure to save space for their deserts!!the ice cream is one of the best i have eaten!!the best part is wen the chef comes up to ur table to receive ur feedback and puts in the extra effort to deliver the dish to ur table if something is amiss somewhere!! the kind of service is seriously comendable!!hats off to the managment!!
keep up the good work !!

This is a place which will defiantly give different dining experience! but its mostly a place for friends not much a family place. They stuffed us with so many variety of starters I couldn't even imagine. I just asked one of the waiters curiously if an starter was there, he replied its not in the menu today but pls wait for a wile.. guess wat after sometime he came with that starter, can you imagine that, also my wife tried with 1 name & she also got it! I've would've given better ratings if the preparations we high quality, they were above average. The desserts were better, gulab jamun!! We were so much stuffed with the starters that only for trail shake we ventured into the buffet, which had decent spread & above average preparation.

If you have visited the Barbeque Nation outlets in other cities like Mumbai or Chennai, you can notice great difference in food menu, ambiance etc. Sure, friendliness of the staff kind of makes up for that, still the main thing is food and the menu is a bit repetitive. Improve that and the outlet can be really good.¬†

Still... thanks for the hospitality.

Last I went was July 2014 with my friends and had a lovely experience.....from then I had in mind to take my parents to barbeque nation as well..... after 2 years today I went with then at the sector 5 outlet.
We reached @ 12:20 pm availing the early bird discount.
The d√©cor was the mostly same...... Ambiance very soothing.
One part of the kitchen has glass giving one a feel of live kitchen .
We asked for amm panna for the welcome drink.
Then the kabaab started flowing......
There was curry leaf chicken kabaab.....tasted diff from the normal kabaabs.....it was grt. It had that aroma of curry leaves and the smokey flavour of grill .
Then there was American crisp corn, chicken wings, mushroom grill.... Grill potatoes....baby corn.....mutton kabaab......jerk fish kabaab......cojun sauce baby potato ( creamy texture and cheesy in taste).......only a lil complain abt the prawn.... there was shejwan prawn.....it was a lil bland..... The taste didn't come out well ...and the tail was over charred.... making it taste in the bitter side than smokey
Coming to main course I am always a salad person here after I am stuffed with starter ....
Seafood salad
Cold salad
Chicken salad : it was grilled chicken with mayo and cabbage and lettuce ....heaven.
I don't much indulge in fish and mutton. ...just teaspoon of gravy to taste ... okayish
Chicken was good ...biryani was gud....
Rather I loved the chicken manchow soup and the.veg main course Panjabi Chole was perfectly soft. There was a palak veggie yumm .
Stir fried vegetable.... nice
Desert
Live kulfi counter
Cheese cake
Brownie
Fresh fruits
Custard
Pheerni ( I missed the baby handi in which it was served last time I came. ..they were super cute )
Apart from food why I came back to this place and will always go back again and again is the way how the staff and the managers make u feel comfortable.
They  keep on asking what u need . They are patient with u......I complained abt the prawn and they offered for a new batch of prawn....I was too stuffed to say yes. U keep on calling them for this and that and ask for the veg stuff when u r having nonveg and they actually make u a veg dish.....hehe....
The way u get treated by them makes u go there again..... I would actually give them a big thank you..... Barbeque wont have gone this far without the warmth every customer gets.

Had a lovely afternoon with my parents....looking forward for my next visit .

One of the great food joints in the city in the upper mid range category is BBQ Nation. It's a barbeque style restaurant with coals at the table, live music, open kitchen, friendly staff and awesome food. Specializing in kababs, one must try the chicken tengdi here. The kababs as starters will definitely exceed your expectation but they are lacking variety in veg section. Warning - the outlet may not be a good choice for vegetarians.

Went there last sunday to attend a birthday party of one of my colleagues. I cannot think of a better place to host a party - musicians sang a happy birthday song for him, a house cake was prepared (ordered previously) and served, couldn't find a single reaosn to frown on the overall ambience. Courtsey of house staff is excellent, pampers you like anything. The chef always visit your table for feedback which gives that additional personal touch. Dessert tastes like heaven, one of the best that I tasted in my life. Special mention for simui payesh and vanilla icecream. 

Cons : hot and sour soup is nothing close to a chinese preparation. Not sure why a barbeque restaurant will even try to make a chinese soup but the one available was between a shorba and a soup, matching to neither one of them. And I already talked about the lack of veg starters, more importantly the lack of innovativeness.

If it has to be grills then visit barbeque always......... Best buffet restaurant in kolkata.



The kebabs are mind blowing consisting of live grill & personal touches of spices to add along with deserts like gulab jamun, pastry, caramel custard , firni & raw fruits..........



However, menu course is a bit let down in fish section but overall a superb experience which i will cherish over and over again even after 5-6 visits..........

now they provide birthday cake if we intimate them that we are celebrating somebody's bday there. Further, They refuse tips.

Service is excellent, felt as if I went for a marriage party where the host ask you about the and tries to stuff your plate. A person was taking feedback about the food. Though there is scope for improvement in desserts section.
Tip- don't forget to do pre booking during weekends n special days. I went there for lunch, ended up doing dinner.

Everyone sported a smile, always ready to help you out and ask your feedback. Even the chef did rounds around the tables seeking patrons feedback.

Have been there many times. Office parties, treats and casual treats, BBQ is always the first option.¬†
This is the place to party, no doubts. Go there and party hard. Drinks are awesome, food is great, starters are mind blowing. You simply can't resist the corn fry which is exponentially becoming the drawing force nowadays. ¬†

Service is awesome, chefs come and ask all the time what more cud they have done to arouse our taste buds and you are simply dumbfounded. The ambiance is great, specially the tandoor zone surrounded by glass looks awesome. The bands can improvise a bit but the Bryan Adams songs played there are good,. U can also try a bit on the singing part if u wish and thats a great thing too. More or less BBQ makes u feel home but with a tasty food that grabs ur attention.

Looking forward to visit BBQ again. :)

What to say about this place. this place deserves all 5 ratings food, quality and services. celebrated my Mom's bday there and all of us were quite happy with the food. Though can improve on main course (as in better options). When they got to know we were celebrating bday they gave us a complimentary cake for my Mom. The starters were too yumm and desserts were fabulous.

There's no getting over THIS. The food is just awesome. I would have rated it a 100 stars, but unfortunately Zomato draws the line after 5. The kebabs are just amazing and the buffet is to die for. The concept is really nice, reminding the older crowd of days when people insisted that you eat more. The prices are justified, and really, I couldn't care less. All that matters is the FOOD. And good food is all they give.

Had Sunday brunch with group of colleagues. The starters were yummy and lots of variety for vegetarians too. The bread pakoda shaped like piece of meat was nice. But the main course was a bit of let down. The usual rice n chana masala palak sabzee. The pasta salad was bland. Desserts were nice - warm gulab jamuns with ice cream tasted good but nothing innovative there. Only buffet was there -so good for big groups.

Barbeque nation:
Being a food fanatic,I was waiting for a head start to write my first review in Zomato. Well,I got my promising starter in this journey,it's none other than Barbeque Nation.
We booked for 10 voracious foodies a week ago.As we reached the front gate,its ambience just blew my mind.The servers and assistants were so cordial, we never felt uncozy.

Now let's come to the starter section.Belive me,this is the best starter section I've ever tasted in my life.The chicken malai kebabs, mutton kebabs were the best among all.Our target was not to let the flag down as long as possible and after 1 hr. 20 min. Of fight,we finally surrendered for the starter section.the kebabs just won all of our hearts.They fulfilled almost 70-75% of our stomachs.

We invested only 5% of our bellies for the main course.the mutton dum biriyani simply tried to outrun our calculations by its taste and smell, but we anyhow controlled ourselves.The chicken n mutton dishes were all delicious...the different types of salads were good and all other dishes in the main course remained untouched by us.

The last 20-25% was devoted only for the dessert section. The ice cream with chocolate sauce,the firnee,the hot-small-cute gulab jamuns were simply mind blowing.all other items including cheese cake,chocolate pastries, mango pastries played their jobs. Last but not the least,watermelon triangles made the swansong of the buffet.

So,at a glance;
Pros :
1.heavenly ambience, that makes your mood of the day.
2.unimaginable behaviour of servers and assistants(have you ever seen in an unlimited buffet,a server is pleading you to taste an item even when your stomach surrendered???I was so moved that i felt like in home)
3.the majestic taste of kebabs.
4.the melting mouth watering desserts.
5.the genuine concepts(like barbeque oven in each table,the flag idea,starting with welcome drink and many more).

Cons :
1.The washroom.It's so small that only 1 people can use it at a time.
2.The limited access of welcome drink.atleast the non-alcoholic drinks should have unlimited access...just a single glass isn't so sufficient.

So,my friends,those who are real lover of food but yet didn't find out the gate,barbeque nation is always there for you.you'll surely fall in love with it,I swear.

The best in town. I must say besides the delicious food, the ambience and the hospitality shown by the team is unmatchable.. If you are looking for grilled food. This is the place for you to visit. You must try the non veg buffet. The kawabs are amazing especially the chicken tengri kawab..

Atlast After lots of planning ten of us, foodie friends decided to conquer Barbeque Nation.

We are all grilled food lovers so obviously we decided to take charge on the starters.
All the starters were mindblowing.Specially Murgh Malai Kabab and Mutton Seekh Kabab.
It was so delicious that when we stopped over starters,we were almost 70% Full.

After such a heavy game with Starters it was difficult continue the same,so we went quite
light on Main Course .The Biriyani was light yet very tasty.The Chicken dishes were average,
nothing special.

Being a sweet tooth, I love the dessert part more than anything everytime I eat in a buffet.
The Firnee was so so.
Cheese Cake, awesome.
Mango Pastry ,good.
Ice Cream, Great.
Fresh Fruits with cream,refreshing.
Gulab Jamun, Excellent.

I am a proclaimed sweet tooth but here i couldn't place the dessert part on higher rank than the starters,so amazing was
the Kababs. So, to all the foodies out there,this is the experience you all should add to your collection. awesome :-)

If i would have rated BBQ Nation 3 years back, it would have gotten 4.5 for sure. I believe the rush was the same then, but they concentrated more on the quality then. 

Even though they do their best to ensure that you will leave the place pleased, they miss out as the quality is not that great. Considering the competition that they have, in the form of Global Grill currently, they are walking on thin ice. Maybe the count of people would remain same, but the reputation will degrade everyday, which is not good. 

For the past three visits, my veggie starters have been dreadful to say the least. Either they are underprepared, overcooked or too blunt or less spicy. They keep on bringing me alternates, but to know results. Even the quality of their popular desserts have jumped down quite miserably. 

I feel bad, giving this place, which was v close to my heart for the experience, which it gave me once, a bad rating, but I cannot help it. 

Hope I can get a better response in the future. 

Hope this review

I almost wait for the day when I'll be visiting Barbeque Nation next.Its just worth for everything even if you have to wait in a long queue for almost 2 hrs during weekends to grab a seat here.There is just absolutely nothing to say about its food.It serves one of the best kebabs in Kolkata.I have been in Pune's Barbeque Nation branch too.But I like the one in Kolkata.The decor,the staffs,the food,the ambience are just perfect.You can come here for a romantic date or with friends or for small family gatherings,or may be for office parties.The ambience suits everything.

Coming to the food,there is a wide variety of starters,mostly kebabs both veg and non-veg followed by an array of beautifully placed main courses and deserts.Among these what attracts me the most are the non veg kebabs and deserts.The spicy roasted prawn kebabs,mutton kebab, fried corn, fish kebab,the soft chicken kebabs and in deserts gulab jamuns, bengali payesh,bownie are my favourites.Generally I just take a spoonful of biriyani and any mutton dish from the main course.Although the main course dishes are also delicious.You can also find some trendy salads which also taste very nice.

And the excellent thing about Barbeque Nation is that the chef himself will come to you and ask you about the taste of each and every food and even you can ask him to prepare the kebabs as per your choice of spices or taste.

An amazing Buffet experience with some courteous staffs and a beautiful decor is what you are going to enjoy in Barbeque Nation...

I went there for a casual lunch with two colleagues on Thursday. The restaurant was pretty crowded but we got seats immediately. We went for buffet and the waiter promptly served the grill and the kebabs and we were given complimentary soft drinks. The kebabs were really tasty and they kept them coming. The waiter came and inquired us about the food and a bit later a chef came to ask us about our food. There was a starter called chicken sausage which was not at par wd my taste palate,it was a bit less spicy according to me. The chef noticed the abandoned sausages on my plate and asked me why didn't I like them,how could the dish be improved,etc. He then went away and a few minutes later,the waiter came and served us a new dish consisting of chicken sausages as complimentary from the chef. The new dish was amazingly good and this notion really got to me as it was really caring and courteous on their part to do something like this for a customer. The main course and desserts were very good as well and had a lot of variety unlike many buffets served by other restros of Kolkata. We had a great experience there and can't wait to visit it again.

Barbeque Nation has always been one of my preferred choices when it comes to buffet. The offers, the varieties and especially the manner in which it is served has always attracted me no matter wherever i am. If you are starving and you have a group of patrons who can actually EAT, then its the perfect place to go. The prawns, fish, chicken and the special servings of the day....each item is worth paying for. To top it all, it has live music in some of the cities. Just sit back and enjoy the ambience, the music and of course the food. The main courses are average but the desserts are too good. A place you can depend on, when you have no specific restaurants to go, in your mind.

Want to have good kebabs? And that too unlimited? Then this the right place for you. When I visited the restaurant a food festival was going on, "GRANT TRUCK ROAD FOOD FESTIVAL".
They had KEBABS like "KASUNDI CHINGRI" from Chittagong, Bangladesh as well as "MUTTON CHAPLI KEBAB" from Pakistan. The kebabs were brilliant and were served in a sigri. 
They also had other kebabs in fish, chicken etc.
Also had a wide range of buffet from Biryani to mutton ,to fish , breads etc.
Their dessert section was really attractive. They mentioned a dish named " Ganne ka ras ka kheer", I felt excited by the name,  but it turned out to be a pure bengali " chaler payesh".The gulab jamuns were good.They also have a well stocked bar.
One last thing to mention, surprising surprising, the stewards / waiters said they don't accept "TIPS".They returned back my Rs100/- Tip amount. This is the first I had such an experience in regards to TIPS. I was impressed because I have seen places where stewards/ waiters strive for extra or more TIPS.Keep up your service. A VERY NICE PLACE TO VISIT.

Best Buffet Restaurant in Kolkata...They will serve the starters until you get tired eating :) :)..Main course and Desserts you have to take of your own..Many people often take desserts after starters..bcoz starters are too too too gooooood..and they wouldn't hv some empty space in their stomach to put the main course :D..Trust me its fabulous :)
Must have starters:
1. Corn fries(itz really awesm)
2. Prawn kabab
3.Chicken Kabab
4.Mutton chapra kabab

Must have main course:
1. biriyani
2. mutton
3.Salads

Must have desserts:
1. Gulab jamun ,IceCream with Chocolate Sauce,Firni

P.S. When you pay them you don't have to hesitate..You will come to know that it worth the price

This place is superb for the starters they serve. I am a vegetarian and I had this misconception that only non veg starters will be having various varieties. I found 6 different items for veg starters.The buffet is very much affordable and you will not regret for a minute spending that much money on food. Main course food is average but the dessert part was great. Nice place to have food with friends because you will be engaged at least for 1 and half hour.
Be sure to book the table in advance because you will find the place crowded. The reason behind this is the location of this branch. There are a lot of IT offices around here and they always book this place for their lunch meetings or any treats. 

Updated: In my second visit, I found they have a fresh item - Kulfi and that's too in 6 different flavors.. It's a must try... Better than the ice creams...

Edit (21/8/14): Had another great lunch here. Won't ramble much. Splendid kebabs (the mushrooms, tangdi and fish are worth a special mention) and main course was quite good too. The desserts were lovely. I loved the angoori gulab jamoons more this time because they weren't fiery hot in the centre. The chocolate truffle pastry seemed a tad watery- maybe they had used too much syrup to keep it moist. However, when I added a spoonful of chocolate sauce on them, it just took them to another level. There was a 2-in-1 (mango and strawberry) cheesecake which got me really excited but it wasn't very good. It felt too thickly set with gelatin and tasted more like blancmange than creamy cheesecake.¬†
_______________________________________________________________________

(5/8/14)
There is nothing much to say about Barbeque Nation except that it is brilliant in terms of food, service and price. In fact, almost all the reviews here echo the same, so I am not going to spend time embellishing BBQ Nation in eloquent adjectives. Instead, let me jump straight to the experience.

We had learnt that on Monday through Thursday, BBQ Nation docks about Rs.100 off the bill if you visit within 12:30. So we reached pretty early and got a seat just when the place was opening. They reserve 60% of the seats and 40% of the seats are available on first come, first serve basis. The restaurant is oddly long and not very wide, so unless you sit near the buffet tables (which are probably reserved), it is a long walk. The tables are not widely spaced, so its a challenge carrying a plate laden with food through the crowd. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is very lively and not at all like Flame & Grill or other buffets where the ambiance is quiet and almost serious. I really loved it.

Now coming to the food- we were served those delicious, crispy, spicy fried sweet corn. I didn't take more than a spoonful because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to eat kebabs if I eat something deep fried at the start, but it was delicious and next time I'll be sure to ask for a second helping. The kebabs, unlike those at Flame & Grill (at least on weekdays), had great variety. There were two chicken kebabs and one fish, one prawn and one mutton on the non-veg starters.¬†

The Kasundi Prawn was delicious and the medium sized prawns were grilled to perfection with the mustardy coating. The Murgh Boti kebabs were soft, not overly spiced and delicious. Same goes for the chicken Tangdi kebab. But the Mahi Anarkali (fish kebab) was just on another level. The fish was so soft that it was falling apart under the slightest pressure of the fork and the taste was that of clean, pure fish. The mutton Chapli kebab was okay- I don't like that much spice and I don't like mutton either. All the kebabs were succulent and soft. I mean this is the first time I have eaten kebabs at a buffet where the knife was completely unused. I liked the Cajun spiced potatoes, which were fried and slathered in a slightly sweet mayo sauce. I will try the other veg kebabs next time.¬†

I was so full of kebabs by the time we finished with the starters, I did not have appetite for main course. But I regret that because the main course was not a perfunctory one like Flame and Grill's. It had Fish Amritsari- a batter fried fish, which I didn't like because I had had too much of beautiful fish kebabs by then to like this. I didn't have the chicken, mutton or biriyani, but my friends said they were quite nice. I had some of the Shahi Paneer and Khatte Aloo, because I can never say no to paneer and aloo, and both of which were really nice. My boyfriend had the Jhinge Posto and Kosha Potol and he went for second, third and fourth helpings of the stuff! There were lots more on the menu, though we didn't venture that far. I took spoonfuls of the chicken and seafood salads. They had a really tangy, refreshing taste and I suggest everyone have a spoonful of the salads because that cleanses the palate.¬†

Though I have a humungous sweet tooth, I didn't have enough space in my tummy to eat a lot of dessert. But I did take small helpings of everything there was except the vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. The Angoori Gulab Jamoons, boiling away in a nonstick wok on an induction cooker, are deceptively hot and make sure you crack them open and let them cool a bit before popping them into your mouth (the wait is agonizing though). The Kora Pak Sandesh was pretty bland and I think Kora Pak Sandesh should be served only in winter because it is incomplete without Nolen Gur. The Ganne Ki Ras Ki Kheer was lovely- plain kheer with a distinct taste of sugarcane. The phirni was so damn good; it tasted of the delicate saffron and was not overly sweet either. You could easily have a few pots without feeling queasy. But same cannot be said for the mango pastry that was very sweet and I couldn't eat more than two bite-size pieces of. The brownie was fudgy, but I suspect that's only because there were slathered in chocolate sauce on the tray. Nonetheless, I liked them. There were fresh watermelon and papaya slices, which is a must after such a decadent meal.¬†

Coming to the service, it is, in a word, unprecedented. I have not seen such a welcoming and friendly staff. They come and ask about the food every five minutes, ask us if we need any alteration on the kebabs and even the chef came along to say the same thing. When you go to Barbeque Nation, you will get nothing short of what we Bengalis call 'Jamai Ador'. One of the servers brought along the Tangi kebabs and when my boyfriend asked them to give just one, they were like, 'Sir, arekta nin.' I could have never imagined servers urging customers to eat more at an unlimited buffet. In fact, they even called up next day to take feedback. This kind of concern is commendable and I hope this does not fade with their ever increasing popularity.

P.S.: They don't take tips. Really.¬†

P.P.S.: This restaurant is not imaginary.

Situated in saltlake , it is one of best place for barbecue lovers...the dishes were unbelievably tasty. The bar is well stocked Ambience is also nice. Service was also apt! The waiters actually know what they are serving and which platter goes best with what! Buffet price is affordable and somewhat lower than other restaurants. Planning for the next visit soon!

I have been to three Barbeque Nation restaurants across the country, in Kolkata, Bangalore and Vadodara, out of which the one in Vadodara has been the best. Of course, the ambiance, the decor and the way in which food is served is quite similar in all places, but the one in Kolkata suffers from many problems. While the space is much smaller, there is not much that can be done about this now. However, the arrangement of the tables may be made in a way that makes it look much more spacious. Also, the service was very poor at this restaurant, with the guests not even being served water before the food arrived. Also, we had to wait for the starters a few times when our grill was empty, while at other times, so many of the starters came together that many of them either got burnt on the grill or we had to rush through the food. Much more attention needs to be paid to the service to make the experience fulfilling. The main course was good in terms of variety and taste, but the desserts, which are generally very good at any Barbeque Nation, had almost got over, even though it was not too late into the night. In order to preserve the reputation of the brand, Barbeque Nation should definitely pull its socks up here.

Undoubtedly, The #1 Foodies' Hub in Kolkata right now, Barbeque Nation stands out in it's competition with the..... umm..... EVERYTHING!!!!... It's just the perfect place to go with your family, have a nice lunch (or dinner, but I'd prefer having lunch, more) or with your friends to chill out, have a beer, enjoy the buffet spread.... Service is commendable... Ambiance: elegant(but not overwhelming).... And then the food!!!!!!..... I mean, how could one eat at BBQNation and not like it?!?!?!... Now, for the pricing: The last time I entered, we were five guys, we had opted for the gorgeous yet pocket-friendly Weekday-Lunch-Buffet, and we got a bill of around 3.3k(but that was one and a half months back)...

Final Verdict: When you feel down, and no one's around to make you feel better, leave it to the chefs at BarbequeNation to cheer you up..... (At less than a grand, of course)

I have been to this place thrice. And the fourth time i realized it doesn't serve anything other than buffet! :/
Anyway, its a good place to go for treats when the group is huge. And i think the only course that keeps this place in business is their starter platter. The kebabs are great. Well cooked, scrumptious, and the best thing, UNLIMITED! But the rest is just sad affair. On everyone of my visits i mostly filled myself up with the starters because the main course is bad. The desserts are so-so i must say.¬†Overall a good place to visit with a big group of friends or ralatives or maybe colleagues.

Went there many times and each time mesmerised.. really had a great experience dere.. first they served fried corns.. which were very crisp and awesome taste, then came the kebabs, which is the best part of the buffet, all the kebabs were awesome, just loved the prawn and mutton kebabs. then the main course which was ok with biriyani and a chken and mutton gravy dishes for non-vegetarians, the chken was great. then the part of the desert when wen ur tummy is full of kebabs and biriyani u still have space for those delicious gulab jamuns, chocolate brownie, firrnee and types of cheese cakes. Now they have introduced deliciuous kulfis,there are 6 types of kulfis in the counter to choose from . Among the kulfis I tried the paan kulfi was best,very unique. the mango fulfi was tasty. the malai kulfi and pista kulfi was good like usual kulfi. Overall a ¬†place where u can get varieties of indian and mughlai dishes.. all of those are very delicious.. ¬†ambiance is good.. ¬†the staffs are too hospitable which really counts for this place..

Ok, barbeque nation. Where to start....let's just say for people like me, who just want to eat and eat good, this place is heaven. The buffet is very much affordable and you will not regret for a minute spending that much money on food. The kebabs are legend of this place and its fame is country wide. The deserts are too good. Not many people look for the main course items in a buffet(frankly I eat too much kebabs to be looking at other foods), and yes this place is a helluve place for food. Go and try it once amd you will be forced to return on an average day every time.....

Barbeque Nation is one of ultimate places in the city to have unlimited Kababs & Starters.  & the unlimited trail of Kababs will definitely make you WOW!!! & not to forget the awaiting main course & deserts. And as a matter of fact they also serve an extraordinary north indian Buffett main course with some fantastic deserts.. The ambience is very lively & the service is just awesome (even in full packed).

Ok let's face it, BBQ Nation is awesome. Though the place is a bit quite tight and you may be unlucky to grab a place without proper booking. They keep 40% for First Come First Serve and 60% for Booking. But believe me, be there within 12PM (when the restaurant opens) if you don't have a booking or you may miss the opportunity. About the food it's awesome. It serves the same cuisine as of Flame n Grill, but much better than them. Options in Kebabs are much flexible and higher then FnG, main course, desserts have better options too. The food, the taste feels much better than FnG. Well, what can I say, it's awesome. Shef comes directly to customer to know their feedback and believe me if you have any grudge tell him, he'll try his best to please you. We wanted some more option in mutton, as Mutton Sikh Kebab was the only one in Mutton based preparation. He offered us some different preparation after around half n hour and it was too good :) Well, be there, enjoy the delicious food :)

Its been some time since i last visited this place but the experience was very pleasant and worth a mention. First of all, the idea of 'reheating' kebabs on grills at the table is not a novel concept. If you consider the time line, Sigdi/Flame and Grill got the concept in South City first I believe. Anyway, the area where they manage to take a leap over them is the variety. The kebabs, although a little inconsistent in the marination, pack in a lot of flavour especially the non-veg ones. The service is very courteous and prompt and the set main course options are pretty good and again more variety.¬†
My rating on the place:
Food: 4 for taste. 3.5 for quality as the desserts are rather poor.
Ambiance: 4 it is what it is. Lively and fast.
Service: 4. Courteous staff and fast service.
Value for money: 4.5. Reasonable for an all you can eat and quality and flavour.

Honestly, I would frequent this place a lot more if not for its distance from my residence.

Barbeque nation is just awesome. The ambiance is sober and nice lighting inside. Food Quality is nice and its very hygiene and less spicy. The best part is hospitality its awesome they always care for the customers. They takes feedback from you about the food quality.

In the food section starters ¬†are very delicious from various types of shik kababs to tandoori. Main course also very delicious and the desserts are too good specially angoori gulab jamun.¬†

In one word barbeque nation is best for buffet and its also priceworthy

The mutton sheekh kabab...yummm. prawn kabab...yuummmyyy. chicken rashmi kabab...yummier!!! Its mouth watering and delicious. Though after eating so much of kababs i hardly eat the buffet meal... but i must say they serve good food. It tends to become a bit noisy when its full house but given the taste of food my ears can bear that noise :p

Very good ambience and probably my fifth visit. I think they have established themselves on the front of good food and the bigger battle now is on the service front. Visited on the occasion of ID and we were a group of 25. Serious misses in identifying veg and non veg and delay in supplying the barbecue items. No dedicated captain for 5 tables. Not recommended for larger groups.

If we talked about the ambiance it is pretty good and as per my experience i have been there many times this place is highly recommended for starters while if we talked about main course its not the special characterstic of this restra.... overall the place is highly highly recommended for first timers..

Went for the first time last day. I will always prefer reservation or else you might get upset on reaching there. Firstly, the ambience is very nice. Proper arrangements. Secondly, there were mini tandoors on each table which I saw in Kolkata food circuit for the first time. Now about the food: The starters were really good, a wide of kebabs. Liked the fish and prawn kebab the most, although I'm not that kebab fan. Time to time service was really appreciable. Now in the main course, first I tasted the non-veg biriyani which wasn't that good. The other dishes were quite delicious. Atlast it was time for the deserts. They were just Yumm!!!  Now that's all. According to me a value for money meal. Will go there more often.

Pardon me for using a metaphor, Miroslav Klose might not be the costliest player in the world, but in terms of delivering at the right time, he is unparalleled . 

Barbecue Nation is one such place which never fails to deliver.. 

Food : Given the variety and the sheer quality, you can't ask for more.. 

Service : This is where these guys really pamper you ;they really make you feel special. They cook dishes the way you want them.. They bring their chef to your table to tell him about your likes and dislikes 

Ambience : Nothing mindblowing, but definitely up to the scratch.. The place just lifts your mood. 

Pocket Pinch : The best way to spend your money on food. You feel paying them more after you recieve the bill, the level of satisfaction is such ;but lo! You can't because of their No Tip policy..  

Truely the best place to spend your time eating and getting pampered..  A huge thumbs up..

One if the best places to go if you are a very good foodie and have a good appetite.. ambience is good and quality of starters are pretty good... best thing is that they won't stop serving u starters unless you put down the flag. Additionally main course is very good. Service and hospitality wise it is very good. The waiters are good in their hospitality. If you love buffet lunch definitely visit this one.

Highly recommended, must visit for its kebabs and service!!¬†I have been eating my heart out at Barbeque Nation since quite a while now....5 years or more!Infact I am soooo fond of its gulab jamuns I remember telling the manager once that I would be more than happy to pay Rs. 200 and just enjoy the gulab jamuns there.¬†Many places serve wonderful food, but what I recall about restaurants probably more than its food is its service and the service at Barbeque Nation is simply awesome.The spread in tantalizing and sinister. Its so good that you can't do without over eating. Foodies or not its a place to relish.¬†
I am hungry for more and definitely look forward to my next visit.

Awesome ambiance, Awesome food, Awesome Service sums it all!
To be honest we had a lot of apprehensions in nailing down to this place for the concept of unlimited starters are pretty old now. This place is refreshingly new with a truely Indian taste! Loved the unlimited concept of starters & my tummy was full just by eating starters.The Pulao in the main course is one of the best and the Dal Makhani is absolute heaven! The best is the end in the deserts section! the 5 different but Bong sweets are bliss to the sweet tooth and the end with the pan leaves you simply satisfied!The charges are pretty nominal.
Service is awesome as well and the owners engagement with the guests are appreciable.. Barbeque Nation stumps all other barbeque outlets in all terms and wishing them good luck in their future endeavors!

Barbeque Nation - The much awaited 'King Restaurant" of Zomato Kolkata was visited this sunday. 
<><><><><><><><><><><><>
Location:

It is located just opposite to the building of Buddha Lounge. To be more precise, take the first right from the nicco park crossing when coming from the em by pass flyover and thereafter after crossing mc d take left. 
<><><><><><><><><><><><>
Introduction: 

It was the "Birthday" of Barbeque Nation and for this reason, they had been providing more items off the menu too. As i visited Barbeque nation for the first time, they had a huge waiting list outside. Never mind, i went with my family and we waited for half n hour to try this restaurant. As we got a seat there were musicians who were playing the music and it was quite enjoyable. On the other hand, as it was over crowded, it was too much noisy too which is totally acceptable. As we took our seat, they had started off the buffet for four of us. 
<><><><><><><><><><><><>
Food:

As my mom is vegetarian, we had a veg buffet for her too. They had placed the barbeque grill on our table to let the kebabs stay hot and we can enjoy our meal. Nevertheless, on the grill were:-

1) Prawn Kebab - I am not a prawn lover. However, as they had kept it on the grill i went on to try it. It was however hot and crisp too. :) 

2) Chicken Malai Kebab - The chicken kebab were awesome. However, i expected it to be a little more succulent.

3) Fish Kebab - Fish kebab tasted fine. However, i had better kebabs of fish before. The marination could have been more better. 

They were literally throwing barbeque grills on our tables. One of them fell down and they removed it with 'no questions asked'. This was what i really liked. 

On the table:- 

4) Mutton Sheekh Kebab - This was off the grill and served separately to us. It was really good and totally up to the mark.

5) Jacked Potatoes - It was really good and this was also served to us off the grill. To my knowledge, i found quite a lot of vegetarian dishes here like mushrooms and fried vegetables. This place is equally good for the vegetarians too. 

6) Chicken Tangri Kebab - They were served quite hot and it tasted good too. :) 

7) Kiwi Soda - This was too good and it was unlimited on their birthday. I don't know whether it is unlimited always or not. 

8) Orange Sherbet - This was lovely too. The masala acted as an add on to enhance the flavor. 

The above items including the beverages were unlimited. Order as much as you want it. :)
There was kashundi, green chutney and tartar sauce on the table. They had served us extra water bottle too. 

They had given so much of kebabs on our table and within every three minutes they were getting off the grill items too. After eating a lot of kebabs, my 60-65 percent of the stomach filled outright. After completing the grill, we had to turn the flag down so that they stop serving starters anymore. However, i did not forget that they have buffet to enjoy too. So.. i went on.. and shifted to the buffet... 

The buffet items which i had tried were:- 

9) Chicken DUM Biryani - The chicken was too succulent. The aloo was perfectly cooked. This preparation of biryani was quite unique. However, the aroma can be more enhanced. 

10) Chicken Gravy -Pardon me. I forgot the name but it was on the bone chicken. I tried the gravy of it and it really tasted amazing. 

11) Kaali Daal - The Daal was too good. I really loved the preparation and would love to come back for more. 

12) Roti - They had been preparing fresh hot roti and naan's and keeping on the tables. I had ordered for it and believe me, it was served totally hot and it was quite good too while eating with the daal. 

Apart from this, they had mutton shorba, mutton gravy and even fish in gravy. However, i could not try so much the first time. 

After taking two times of biryani and dal, i was 90 percent full but i did not give up because the last thing which they had was DESSERTS!!!!!!!

I took each piece of dessert on my plate so that i can enjoy and taste all of it. I took:

13) Mini Gulab Jamun - It was lovely and hot. 

14) Firnee - It was served in cute small matkas. It tasted really different and good. :) :) 

15) Paais - We call it semiya. It was lovely. One of the best preparation i have ever had. 

16) Shahi Tukda - The shahi tukda was quite hard. However, it was good too.

17) Walnut Brownie - It was good and totally to my liking. 

After finishing all of it, believe me i was so full so full. I had overeaten out of the love of food. They even had ice cream where you can add on the chocolate sauce too. I could not eat more as i was quite full. There were quite more items on the buffet but due to time constraint and stomach constraint i could not try more. :P 
<><><><><><><><><><><><>
Pros:

1) Prime location.
2) Courteous staffs.
3) Food is Total VALUE FOR MONEY.
4) Unique concept of placing the grills on the table. 
5) Amazing hospitality.
6) Prompt service.
7) Good food quality.
8) Amazing ambience.
9) Huge seating capacity. 
10) Provides good food for the vegetarians as well. Vegetarians are not neglected here as in some of the eateries where there is only non veg food.
11) Have a big feedback form. They value feedback a lot and listen to their customers with ears open. 
12) The live music band performing was quite soothing and a very good concept. 
13) Customer is highly valued here. 
14) The staffs serve you with a smiling face. 
15) Quite a lot of items to offer on the buffet as well as on the grill.

Cons:

1) The BIGGEST Con which made me deduct 0.5 points is the washroom. The washroom is quite filthy after people throw paper napkins there after eating. They only have 2 washrooms. They are catering to so many tables and they MUST have at least 1 washroom per 15 people. As far as i counted, they were serving 126 people roughly and only two washroom was a big TURNOFF. It should be cleaned both side. It should not be just about the tables and it should also maintain equal hygiene inside. I don't know whether any foodie mentioned this but i had immediately got this into the notice of the management. 

2) Some of the staffs were quite not knowledgable about the dishes. When asked them for inquiry, they just immediately get some other staff who is quite knowledgable. A little basic knowledge should be imparted to all the people working there. 
<><><><><><><><><><><><>
Suggestions:

1) As i already mentioned, the number of washrooms should be increased for sure. Otherwise, a lovely place to dine in. 
2) The chicken Dum Biryani can be enhanced quite more. 
3) The Chicken Kebab needs to be more succulent. 
<><><><><><><><><><><><>
Summary:

Food quality 4/5
Food quantity 5/5
Value for money 5/5
Taste 4.5/5
Hygiene 4.5/5
Ambience 4.5/5
Hospitality 4.5/5
<><><><><><><><><><><><>
Meal for Four - It costed us 3500 approx. 
<><><><><><><><><><><><>
Conclusion: 

With respect to the service, the staffs were quite well mannered and had the cap on top of their head which shows sign of hygiene as they do care about hair not falling off on the food. Secondly, the staffs had been continously asking us on how we enjoyed the food and what do we love. After all this, they have a feedback form too which clearly shows that they value the feedbacks quite seriously. As we were visiting first time, it was quite courteous of them to explain us their concept very well. 

I really had a great great experience here and in the end, they provided me with a 100 rupees voucher too. I have attached a few picture. Pardon me for the quality of pictures as i was more into eating rather than clicking picture. :P Would love to come back again.

I visited this place several times, very time I feel new to this place. Foods just awesome. I love the starter and dessert.  All the staffs of this place too good. they always want to ask feedback about their service and quality. Master Chiefs usually 2-3 times on buffet table to know about food quality. But missed Crab Items here. This should be include on buffet. Friends please avail Early bird offer on weekdays. 

Barbeque Cheers :)

Barbeque Nation and what do u remember, the non stop starter trail. You go there, reservation is advised. They will start with starters and they are on grills built into the table which you will love. And then it starts, almost 5-6 starters in non veg and 5-6 in veg. Even before u finish the one on your plate it keeps getting replinished such that you are full in starters itself. In veg do try the aloo tikki... its awesome...
In my last 3-4 visits I have found the best way to enjoy Barbeque Nation. Skip from starters to deserts. Main course is similar to most other restaurants of this category so I generally skip it. Staff is good, ambience is good, service is good and food is the best

we have been on 4th June to have lunch, which was a Jamai Shosti day..
the restaurant was FULL TO IT'S EDGES, but they have managed the entire crowd so nicely..!
the menu was just Awwwweeeessssoooommeeee..!

it was the birthday of My Man, & they have arranged a nice cake & even taken our pic, gifted a card as a memento..!!
this was the fifth time we've visited, but we got every time a nice & different experience..!
we would really look forward if you guys include Crab in your Menu..!
also it'll be better if you keep some different choice of Indian breads as well..
Thanks

if you are a kebab lover like me,you must visit the place. 
the best north Indian buffet in the city in my personal views.

coming to food ,the quality is recommendable. starter and desert platter both taste heavenly. especially hot gulaab jamun , 
ambiance is soothing and service is really good.

in one word MUST VISIT.

Spacious ambiance. Yummy deserts. Awesome starters. And customized for you (like spicy, non spicy, extra vegetables, more sweet or more salty etc etc). No clue about the main course though since i was too full with starters and deserts. I have been to delhi as well as bangalore ones and they maintain they same good standard and ambiance in all. Which i think makes the place reliable to come again and again with different guests. But you must be the type to be able to eat big amounts of food though or else you will be missing a little on the huge menu. :-P

man,this place serves kebabs and  lot of them...you can eat a lot and still  find something on your plate

 personally, i  had never had a chance to relish their course due to lack of space in my tummy..and morever the desserts were an added distraction..

the concept of live grills is cool..the service is sometimes patchy and the crowd control is a bit of bother on some days
the ambiance is ok ..but the excellent starters and the wide range of desserts compensate for other issues..
 a must visit for( heavy eaters!) as well as for large groups..

 if possible aviod this place on weekends and on special occasions (pujas) when there is hevay rush and the accompanied everlong wait

Every time I visit BBQ Nation, I regret not having two stomachs. The food & service here is too good.

What I like about the service is that waiters bring food continuously without being told. Recently I visited BBQ Nation and Flame and Grill (South City) within a week and this aspect came out very clearly. In F&G as in many other Barbeque joints, we had to ask the waiter many times to get the food (we were served 4 rods i.e. 12 prawn pieces for 7 people and that was all we got for 5 min.)

Another great feature is their welcome drink. It goes a long way to make you feel welcomed.

The food is nice, but post starters every time I practically skip the buffet and go straight to dessert. However I always make sure to have the mutton from the Mutton Biriyani.

This restaurant has a brilliant feel the moment I set foot inside.  The concept of having a grill at your dining table is not really popular in the city, but Barbeque Nation maintains it very well. The buffets over here are exceptional. Nothing too oily, nothing too fried, the food seemed perfect. It being my birthday, the chef cooked me a special dish which was totally sublime. There is a feel good factor about the restaurant, with the waiters coming instantly whenever required. The Chicken grills are a must try. However, they have kept a singer to entertain which is really not needed as he does not complement the food. Overall it is a must-go with your family and friends.

After listening to all the feedbacks and reading the reviews I decided to visit the bar b que nation. And I must say its really a place to visit and satisfy your hunger for kebabs. We went their like 4 of us and easily got a table. Their service is very much satisfying and the taste of kebabs are out of the world. The quantity of starters you start to have that no place remains for the main course actually. And the desserts are also appreciable. But one drawback is the ambience. It was very noisy and sounded like a local bazaar. But as a whole I can say that yes it is really a place to visit and satisfy your hunger.  I would give 4.5 to this place.

I am spellbound by this name, and every time I think of this name I only remember the best starters I tasted... The tasty, lovely starters still seem to be in front of my eyes... Starters are the best here. Kebabs (Chicken,Mutton), Prawns, in  uncountable numbers with the best taste are cumulated together here. I remember spending a couple of hours digesting the starters through the oesophagus of my human body. Kebabs are really tasty and they are too good. It was tough for me to taste main course after flagging down the starters. Though I tasted Biriyani, with Kashmiri Chicken and Mutton Rogan Josh.. Taste can't be sacrificed here whatever you gulp in. 
Now comes the last items, the famous Desserts.. They are speechless.. Perhaps the best I ever tasted in my life. Starting from the gulab jamuns to icecream, tarts, pastry and fruits, and what else can you expect.
This is no doubt the best place to be in here for a lunch or dinner but you must be a food-holic and if you are passionate about food at the cost of money.  Be in here once, and I am sure you can't control yourself from writing a review.

If u r a kabab-holic, u must visit this restaurant. They provide the best kababs and the best prawns I ever had. Chicken, Mutton, Prawn in uncountable numbers........ what more can you expect?? Price is little higher, but if you love quantity with quality its okay to be in either at lunch or dinner.. Nowadays I also find Turkey meat with duck... The Main course seems too smooth.... But after having a lot of starters for nearly an hour, when I flag down my flag on the table, I cannot taste much main course everytime, but they seem too tasty I can assure....
And lastly, the desserts, they are the best... Pastry, sweets, fruits in varying nouns......

Overall Experience: One of the best in Kolkata.....

Best North Indian buffet in the city. I have been here a number of times thanks to all the office parties held here. Every time i come to this place,its quite amazes me that they have kept up with their food quality over the years. The staff is so courteous even though the place is always stuffed. And if its your birthday they will bring a cake and take a pic and make a card out of that pic, just as a token gift. I think that's something that makes any birthday girl/boy feel special. And a special thanks to them for these endeavors. Oh and the birthday cake is the yummiest cake you have ever had. Coming to the food. Well ever one loves the starters but the main course is pretty good too. Most of us are so full by the starters are over that we cannot appreciate the main course. 
Must have starters:
1. Corn fries
2. Baked fish
3. Prawn kabab

Must have main course:
1. biriyani
2. mutton

Must have desserts:
1. Gulab jamun , gulab jamun and more of gulab jamun. (No one can eat just one) :P

This is the best buffet in the city.

A delight it is... the place is beautiful in every sense. Food is awsum.. among non veg items they havnt missed a thing and for veggies you'l not get such variety anywhere else! They keep a number of veg dishes. As for starters the kebabs r lipsmacking. And for deserts they have some 6-7 items. The place offers such amazing food that its no doubt its the best rated restraunt in town. Our stomach was tucked up before we decided to return home!

The ambience is decent, washrooms are clean, staffs are well attentive and they do not accept tips! There is bit of a queue before you get an entry. . Bt everything else compensates for that!

So basically. . Its a must, must and must visit for everyone!

Barbeque Nation is best for that special meal with family or friends. The spread is top quality. Love the starters, especially the tengri kebab. Has to be one of the nest. And the best part is that you can eat for as long you can. I have had times when we spent close to 4 hours for a lunch!! The desserts are top quality too,so most of the times, we give the main course a pass. Overall a top quality experience, just that there are queues on weekends and weeknights..

Had a stupendo-fabulous dinner...  Although this wasn't my first time, still I would like to add that as usual, their service overwhelming, their food salivating, their ambiance ecstatic. A dinner or lunch with friends or family, whichever you choose, you will perfectly enjoy it, I am sure.. They have changed the prawn dishes, serving Mexican prawn nowadays.. which is I must say a brilliant move as every time  you visit if you have to taste the same food again and again, it would be a blunder. The mango mania we had was just too good! They should do something about the chicken and mutton.. Although we talked to the chef and told him to serve the chicken kebab as he prepares the Cajun spicy potato. That was also delicious.. The waiters are so well behaved and so caring.. maahn!! I think everyone should give them a pat on their back and say "thank you"! I would give them a 4.0... coz of the same mutton and chicken.. shud try out something new...

Heaven for us! Our gang of foodies visit the place every year once or twice and needles to say, we litteraly drag ourselves to home every time! The starter kebabs are so good that we just ignore the main course and go straight for the dessert. Last time we went there, a sea food festival was going on. The new fish kebabs, as well as the changed ambience really set the mood. The stuffs, as,every time we visited, were well courtesious and had good sense of time. There was one special dish, a grilled vetki salad, the kind of which I never tasted before. It was marinated vegitables with pieces of grilled vetki fish, with a splash of lime! Awesome! Lastly, a tummy full of kebabs, a glass of lime soda in hand and "leaving on a jet plane" in the live concert, I could not want anything more from life! Just like that! That was the level of satisfaction!

Went for a Saturday Lunch in March,2014. Its a heaven for the Kebab-Lovers. Chicken, Tengri, Mutton, fish , prawn...
Prawn kebab was literally burnt. Fish was the best of all. Main course nothing special to mention. Again lots of desserts, love the walnut cake with rabri, it was fabulous. Complementary drinks was also good.
But best part is their people, the servers are very courteous, and they don't accept tips.

I had a horrible experience once, way back 2013 i visited this restaurant. Visited it then on a festive occassion. It was very overcrowded and people were jostling for spsce. Coupled with unhelping and ignorant staffs, substandard quality of food. It was terrible.
But i thought of giving it a second chance and went back to this restaurant again. Visited during lunch hours on a weekday. Almost no waiting time. Staffs were helping and courteous. Food was really good. Huge range of dishes they had to offer. 
Their kababs are crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Dont remember each of their names but there were 3 types of chicken kebabs, one type each of mutton, fish and prawns, veg kebab and paneer kebabs. Their buffet had quite the variety of foods ranging from biryani to chicken kassa, mutton rogan josh and paneer butter masala. Before i could proceed any further i was almost full. So i helped myself with gulab jamuns and pastries from the dessert section. In the end, i was satiated and bloated üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Overall the past memory of mine with this restaurant was healed and i had a pleasant experience this time. Will go again someday.

The praise of this place can never be overstated....This place is heaven for foodies....
The starters were the best part of it...they were all very different kinds of kebabs of chicken, mutton, fish, prawn, paneer, mushroom and so many to remember...!
Now coming to the main course you wont be able to taste all the varieties they serve....Do taste their dum biryani , lal maas...paneer...
The surprise for us was that it was BBQ's 4th anniversary,So there was another live counter of duck and turkey in addition..lucky us....YaY! The turkey was mouthwatering....the sauces in which it cooked were lip smacking....
The dessert section too had a wide range of varieties to choose from....There were three types of sauces to put on the rich vanilla ice-cream...small gulab jamoons....2 types of cake, 2 types of pastry....fruits....and Oh yes,That heavenly Firni in terracotta pots...!
The staffs of this place are extremely well-behaved and attentive....They insist you to try all the things and enquired about the taste.....!
When we ask for the bill, we were served a pineapple flavoured sponge cake...'4th anniversary BBQ' written on it...! We were asked to cut it...It was awesome...I cant express how much joy you'll get over there...!
we'll be back soon....!

Couldn't help but give it a lip-smacking full 5 points :D Barbeque Nation always has a long corporate queue infront of it on a busy weekday. It's better to have a reservation from before, although the two times I have been there, I never did have one, and they adjusted me quite fine :D. The most loved part here for me is obviously the delicious platter of unending kebabs, fries and baked starters. :D Smoking on the grill, or directly hot from the chefs pick of the day, The Starters (note how I marked each word with a Capital :P) is never a let down. Love their desserts which I jump straight to after stuffing myself with kebabs :) Mains provided by them are quite a lot, but never really had the tummy space to dive in to them.
Lovely hot,small gulab jamuns, cheesecake, firni are some of my personal favourites. Love their idea of porviding two wonderfull jellies , mango and strawberry , and chocolate sauce with the ice cream, which takes it a to a whole new level of vanilla :D.¬†
P.S. You get a beer complimentary :D (another favourite part) , and for the non-alcoholics there are options of lime soda or cold drinks .
In a nutshell.. Puns intended.. Lip smacking good

Barbeque nation catches the attention of a first timer and excites him or her. A live grill on your table with brushes which allows you to smother your food as it grills is an enjoyable experience, provided by none other in whole west bengal. 

The flow of staters as long as the flag is up is an interesting concept. Barbeque boys are generous too, who keep on filling the grill with choicest starters.

I have actually lost count of the number of times I've been to this place. The location, the ambiance, the food, the service, everything sets them a class apart. It's a holy spot for all kebab lovers! If you want to go for unlimited kebabs, then go for this place. Till you put your flag down they will keep on serving you all sorts of starters, that includes chicken/mutton kebabs, drum stick, crispy baby corn, chicken, fish, prawn, mushroom, veg, paneer, etc barbeque. And they serve complimentary drinks as well, that includes - beer, coke, aam panna, fresh lime soda and ice tea.¬†

Also I really like their desserts that includes ice cream, sliced fruits, gulab jamuns, etc. They have newly introduced Kulfi, try out their Paan Kulfi, it is an absolute bliss. Most of the times I am so full after the starters, that I can't even move (literally) to the main course or dessert section!! But anyways, couple of times I have tried their main course which is not really as good as their starters or even the desserts. So better fill yourself up with the starters and desserts and just head back. In the main course you can try out their pasta and few salads that they have, there are fresh and sets you up to carry on hogging after the heavy starters :)

Cheers!

Today was my first buffet lunch and I am extremely glad that I got to experience that with Barbeque Nation.
With such great reviews and comments , there is simply nothing to add on.
The starters were excellent and the way and speed they served us,was superb. Gave full attention all the time. Very courteous and friendly. I loved the ambiance as soon as I entered the place.
The theme of football World cup was everywhere...very impressive.
After the impressive starter with the grills which included Chicken,Mutton.Fish,Prawn and Potato along with Chicken tandoori.
we plunged into the main course,which had not much long list,but taste was good.It included Mutton Biriyani,Mutton rezalla,chicken reshmi and two types of chicken salad.
After that, we dived into yummy sweet dishes.Loved the Phirni and super hot Gulab jamun along with two types of fruit , Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce , 3 types of cake and Chocolate fudge.
Overall , I loved this place and wish to visit again also.
Worth visiting people ! :)

It was a Saturday afternoon around 2. We had to wait for 20 mins to get our seat. This was my first time and the moment I entered, I felt soo good. Starters and desserts were awesome. Though I feel the main course has a scope of improvement. If starters and desserts were 9 out of 10, on the other hand, main course would score a 5.
What makes Barbeque Nation stand out in compared to Flame and Grill is the hospitality. The attenders were very helpful and caring. Even the Chef came to each table and asked if every thing was perfect or not. To me, the hospitality and the behavior of the staffs does play an important role in making it to my revisit list. And Barbecue Nation surely knows how to make their customers feel wanted.

694 reviews and 4.5 rating overall, that pretty much sums up  all that there is to say about Barbeque Nation.

Visited here today, for the first time at exactly 12:28 (and hence we got discount. And it also happened to be A's birthday. Yay!) They have put up flags for world cup after regular intervals and the servers were in jerseys! A person in Brazil jersey attended to us :)
 The choice of complimentary drinks included beer, coke, ice tea, fresh lime soda and aam panna. A ordered the beer strong and they somehow brought him Premium, on mentioning this, they instantly changed the drink. 

The kababs srated coming in full flow. They have red skewers for non veg and green for veg kababs. I had Pineapple kabab for they first time ever today. Nicely made that was. They had chicken and fish and prawn and paneer and what not in kababs. When we reported the prawn kababs to be a little undercooked, they immediately changed them. The kind of attention that the servers give to each of the customers is commendable. There also were mutton seekh kabab, chicken tandoori, rice cake, fried corns and what not. I specifically did not like rice cakes, rest of the starters were perfect! 

The main course again had so many items but being so full with starters, I could hardly enjoy the main course. The Dum biriyani was perfect with little oil, so was the muton rogan josh and moti palak. I did not like the Sarson fish for my own dislike for mustard. 

The dessert section was a treat to the yes amd taste buds! There was double chocolate cheese cake and this was the best thing that I've had in my entire life. I could not do justice to it, being so full. 100 on 100 to this specific cheese cake! The phirni, pastries, angoori gulab jaamun, ice cream were all pretty decent The sight of the dessert section is so heavenly that I cursed myself for overeating the starters.

All in all, a nice place with VERY nice dessert section and servers.  :)

My favourite place to go for buffet lunch/dinner. The service of the staff is really nice. They are warm and courteous.
They serve the best kebabs in Kolkata!!... I am a fan of every special item they serve daily. Turkey in hot garlic sauce, some shark dish and chilly prawns are among my favourite special dishes.  They are unique and mouthwatering. The main course has a wide variety of veg and non veg spread. Dessert I would say is just fine..( reason being, I have had better desserts elsewhere).
Prices are good too.
Overall a wonderful place with super awesome food!! :)

Does this place need any review? It is just simply spectacular not only from the service point of view but the main thing that every restaurant is about, the food, the food here is spectacular ( you may think that i know a single adjective!) .  Beginning from the starters which came in with unequaled proportions, eat as much as you like, i mean they just literally went on and on serving us mouth watering delicacies of prawn , fishes variety of chicken, mushrooms, paneer name it and you have it. 
Frankly speaking we chomped down so much of starters that we barely had any room left for main course. We sat and relaxed for a little while and then pounced on delicious main course which awaited for us. The biriyani was excellent, so was the mutton and fish. The turning point of the lunch for me was the dessert platter. I was in heaven ! 
Thank you, so much Barbeque Nation for making my special day ever so special for me and my friends!

Well I saw the hype on Zomato for a long time and finally i got a chance to visit the place. I have to say its bang for the buck. Everything from starters to the deserts was fantastic and the special live counter was good too. They offered us complimentary beer :D which was unexpected. 
The service was excellent and the kabab sticks were replaced as soon as we finished the prior one. The manager constantly came to our table asking about taste of food which was nice.
Finally when we offered him Tip he rejected :o 
Overall one of the best experiences i had and definitely would recommend anyone eyes closed. :)

The true heaven for foodies indeed. A few words off BbQ nation is just simply not enough to make you understand the ultimate joy that any foodie will get visiting the place. To start off, the kababs are truly amazing .... And by kabab i not only meant the nonveg items only , the veg kababs are also equally amazing. The variety of main course provided here are unimaginable followed by all those finger licking items like icecream, gulab jamun, moose, tart in desert. A total yummm experience for any person .

Sigh...Touted as the best restaurant of Kolkata..I was planning to visit this restaurant since november,2013...weekends passed away and Barbeque nation eluded me...

Last Sunday,I finally visited this place to find out what the hullabaloo was all about..

Reached at 11.30 am as I was unreserved.People started pouring in even before it started.
The ambience was great...nicely lighted..
The ftable has a live counter,where the kebabs are served and you have to take it off the sheekh and have it..Chicken,mutton,prawn,fish...u name it..People come here to eat flesh..and they get it in as much quantity as they can intake...The carnal insticts of man gets unleashed here.....
TOO MUCH PRAWNS...i forgot i had allergy..and these prawns had tails,which i ate too(carnal,you see)..and soon the itching started..the rashes came out..I had to go out and get medicine...

The medicine took some time to kick in,and I didnot have the heart to go through the main course..My friends got me desserts and i just tasted them...DAMN THIS ALLERGY..

They called me up twice to enquire about my wellbeing and feedback..IMPRESSED..i would have been more impressed had they given me a FREE buffet,the next time,but they didnot..:(:'(

This is a foodies paradise..PERFECTION..They call you back for feedback,but they really dont need any..
DESPITE my Allergy,I would visit this place again...and again..and again...

Ive been to this place a couple of times and every time it was presenting itself more gracefully.....The food, the decor, the ambiance is without equal.....

This buffet is really awesome, specially the non veg one.....you can get the barbeque of almost everything from veg to non veg in starters......It usually serves crispy fried corn, sheik kabab, chicken drum stick, barbeque of chicken, fish, prawn, mushroom, veggies and paneer and many others.....And they just feed you until you give up or until you bring the flag down which they provided.....within the main course there is a couple of salads like chicken, egg, seafood salads and many others....mutton biriani...fish, chicken and many veg items......In the desert you get sweets, fruits, ice-cream and hot gulab jamuns.........

This place really lives up to its reputation......and You will get you face stuffed at a moderate price....

Yesterday, means on 25th i visited the place yet again. It was equally awesome. They were celebrating Bollywood Week with name of the foods regarding Bollywood. The menu was a little different and the best part is they were having 'turkey'. I even got a cake as a parting gift. So, yesterday was fun though the price was not a bit high...

I went to the place with a pile of expectation that was raised by so many good reviews of BBQ nation.
And yes, it has lived up to it's  expections. 
Starters: the kabebs were too good (both veg and non veg). A note for non vegies  - try some veg starters, they are a real treat.
Main course and dessert are also good. 
With good food and even better hospitality,  this is the place to be.

I have visited this place more than 15 times. the ambience, decoration, stuffs' behavior everything show their rich class undoubtedly. Regarding food, they really maintain the quality standard and hygine. actually this used to be the best place for kabab and dessert lovers for its unlimited quantity. 
but in my last few visits, i noticed that their quality is not going at par with the price. the prawn kababs are generally over burnt, no change in chicken or mutton seekh kababs. in the main course, i dint like the biriyani. the rice is not proper for actual biriyani. mutton pieces are maximum of bones in biriyani as well as in gravy. the other items are also soso. though in dessert section, they are still maintaining the class. so i would request to look into the above points. but i would still vote it as a "must go place"...

I have been to Flame n Grill and now I have been to Barbeque Nation.. the concept of grill is quite the same, and food is more than good, and definitely much more than your capacity! But the icing on the cake is the complimentary drinks that they serve.. and the service is oh-so-good, I mean did you know that there exists a place in the world where they refuse tips politely (reason being that tips is already included in service charge!)?!! I have been to chili's, TGI friday, and never seen such a behaviour...

Visited yesterday during the happy hour. World Cup themed and the person serving is was dressed in Brazil Jersey, so I was automatically feeling happier. I'd heard a lot from friends about this place but since it was so far from home never got the chance to visit. The starters were simply amazing though the main course failed to impress that much. I'm not saying it's bad or anything but it wasn't as amazing as the starters. Prawn, fish, chicken, mutton kebabs, grills n tandooris adorned my plate. Sadly no beef! The Biriyani and a particular fish preparation were truly great! Again, Biriyani from Arsalan n even Oudh 1590 fares much much better, two Biriyanis from two different gharanas. The dessert section was equally lustful. With chocolate pastries, pies n cheese cakes along with kesar firni, gulaab jamun( awesome) and ice cream in the list, it's best to have a lil less of the main course and a ton of e dessert. But that's just a suggestion. I guess everyone in Kolkata has already been here. So, this won't be much help. Anyway, if you haven't then this should definitely be on your must visit list.

One of the best places in kolkata for Kababs ....... I have been here on multiple occasions as its my 'office para'...... 
If u are a kabab lover, then this is the place to be ....... chicken and prawn in sticks .......the fish kabab served separately is quite soft and quite tasty .......then they also serve chicken leg pieces separately ....... its mainly a place for starters/kababs, so dont expect good main course in buffet .....though they serve biriyani in main course but taste is not at all up to the mark but who cares .... your hunger and appetite is already taken care of by the kebabs ......... infact in comparison to the main course, the desserts are good specially the firni which they serve in small earthen pots ...... last time i went there i had 10 firnis :P
Also at the end, the cook would personally come to ask for a feedback from you ( not always though) ....and is quite good behaved ......
But for me personally,  as i have been there so many times and also not being so much of a kebab lover ,its not in my wishlist now ..... :)  but i would surely recommend it if you are a kebab lover and haven't visited this place till now ......

Barbeque Nation is  so popular that if you want a reservation you will have to book four to five days in advance. But don't fret, because they allocate about 40% of their seats ( this is hearsay) to people who just walk in. Reach early though. 

Now the average person who comes to BBQ nation fills up on the starters, skips the buffet and goes for the desserts. Try as you might, you can never seem to break the pattern.The grilled fish and prawn kebab deserve special mention here. Don't be shy and ask for whatever your heart may desire. After you are done with the savouries, head on to the dessert layout and get yourself some gulab jamuns with ice cream. Your self restraint will be tested to the hilt as you decide whether you are full or can go for another round!

To sum up, eating here is an experience. Highly recommended

This is the only phrase that comes to my mind when I think about this place. Been there few times and experience was very good each time. Staff behavior is another very positive aspect of this place. 

The kababs and desserts are the very best of kolkata.

Would like to visit this place again again.

THE BEST BUFFET IN TOWN IN THIS RANGE!!
BBQ nation is the 1st choice for any person in Sector V when it comes to buffet lunch/dinner. The food is just amazing!! They have several options for veg and non-veg items. Main course may not be that good, but the starters are so filling that I generally jump to dessert from starters.
The best part about it is, the chef personally asks everyone how the food is. If you do not like something, they take it to heart and make it a point to make you fully satisfied before you leave the restaurant. They don‚Äôt take feedbacks and stop there and postpone the improvement for your later visits. They make the improvement then and there by bringing a completely new dish catering to your kind of taste.
The service is superb, the chef is amazing and the manager and waiters, extremely humble. I love this place, not only for the food, but also for the OUTSTANDING service they provide.

The main attraction is kebabs & desserts..

Man those are delicious & mouthwatering...

They have provided 1 welcome drink(beer/fresh lime soda/aam panna/cold drinks)..

next the main course was good too but after the kebab we were stuffed..
Chicken hot & sour soup.. 2-3 types of salad(pasta salad/chicken salad/seafood salad)....chicken dum biriyani..chicken prepariotions..mutton rogan josh...

Then dessert..
Fresh cut fruits..castard..firnee...cake..chocolate tart..angoori gulab jamoon..vanilla ice cream...

Very delightful place for foodies. Variety of foods, starters, main course, side dish, sweets etc... Unlimited until your tummy is full. We went together as team meet of 18 members. Awesome to the wonderfulness when you are there with a huge gang. Servings at its best. The servers don't leave your plates empty even you do too. The starters will itself make you full your stomach to the max. Chicken mutton prawns what else you need for non vegetarian. Ambiance is very good with light music and singers in there sang very well. On weekend it's better to book the tables. Because to get a table it would take nearly an hour or so. I have been Barbeque in chennai too but my vote goes here for the quickness serving.

This is my favourite restaurant in kolkata. My visit here is atleast once every month. I love the food. Why you need to choose when you can have everything. Being a vegetarian, I get to have almost 8-10 starters, then a vast spread of buffet main course followed by yummy deserts. Above all service is beyond expectation. They dont say no to anything. Totally satisfactory. Love to come here again and again.

Barbeque Nation is undoubtedly the best restaurant serving Buffet in Kolkata. The restaurant staff are very courteous and they take proper care of their visitors. However,  you might have to wait before you get a table due to the rush.
The starters are delicious, specially the corn starter, the tangri kebab and the mutton sheekh kebab. In the main course, the biriyani is really tasty and so is the mutton curry. The dessert section keeps on changing. However, the firni and gulab jamun are constant and both taste amazing. 
If you are a foodie and want to gorge on food, Barbeque Nation is the place to visit. You won't be disappointed.

wowwwwwww is the word I use every time I go there. Everything is perfect. The staff members, the ambiance and the food. The kebabs are nothing compared , finger licking , mouth watering (running short of adjectives). Never bother for the main course as they are good but after the kebabs I never have the appetite to go for it expect the chicken salad which is like a food from heaven. The only shortcoming is in desserts they give vanilla ice creams and there people scoops in out from various direction thereby letting the ice cream in a pathetic state. I suggest that a waiter must be there to scoop out the ice cream in the right manner. the gulab jamuns are mind blowingly sensational. If they add hot jalebis (like flame & grill) in the dessert section it will be more appealing. Anyway wish the team a thank u for giving we the foodies such good food at a good price and wish u keep up the good work in the future. A place where all foodies must visit in Kolkatta.

Just now, came back from a quick lunch with my wife from there. Ohhh, this is the best place for buffet food. PERIOD.

Having eaten in all 2 BQ @ Bangalore for last 5 years, this was my first venture and it was awesome. The kabab spread was just too good. I didnt spend much time on veg starters, mainly concentrated on non-veg ones. Carribean Chicken, malasian Fish, Prawn, Kasturi tangri, Mutton Gilafi Seekh - all were just too much with complementary drinks.

Main course was also damm good, but my stomach was already full. 

Moved onto dessert section, with 3 type of cakes, Hot gulab jamoon, ice-cream, chocolate sauce, and malai.

Overall, an awesome experience. This is the BEST place for buffet, PERIOD.

Hard Truth: I think nobody(including me) comes here for the buffet.
Everyone is here for the grill. The food is and ambience is really good. And especially during the seafood festival. The placed is always jam-packed and I don't even mind waiting in line to get a table.

It goes without saying that in an all you can eat grill, over-eating definitely happens every time. But the sheer variety of the kebabs and starters keeps you glued and you really have to think twice before putting the flag down (If you know what I mean). We generally skip the buffet, we just have the Mutton biryani and skip over to the desserts which are also good. 

I am especially impressed with the way the staff handles the crowd. Never will you find this place without a waiting line. Once you're inside, the waiters treat everyone as their priority. 

The live band playing on weeknights really sets up the mood as well. It is one of the best restaurants I've visited in Kolkata. It's definitely worth the wait.

The name barbeque nation is enough, nothing to write much, still just for a formality and though I am writing review I have to write.
Well we all know that the starters starts with sweet corn fry which is so much delicious that you will take it atleast for 3 to 4 times, after that different kinds of kebabs like fish, prawn, mutton, chicken and chicken tengri kebab and a chef's choice if there is a festival then only make you eat 15 to 20 pieces if you are a foodie like me. In the middle the main course is also very good, especially the mutton kasha and the butter chicken masala.
Last but not the least the awesome desserts will make you go woooo, hot gulab jamuns, watermelons, double layer cheese cake, another type of cake (i forgot the actual name :-p), mango tart, ice cream and the main attraction the kulifis of different flavours which you can't resist.
Atlast a tummy filled with delicious foods when you are standing in front of the exit.
When me and my friends decides to go out for buffet we suggest many other restaurants along with barbeque nation, but at the end of the day we shortlist this particular restaurant. That is why I visited this restaurant for more than 5 times.

Birthday? Lets go to bbq  nation. 
First salary? Buffet at bbq nation? 
Group outing? Dinner at bbq nation before we return... it has been a cascade of visits to this place in sector 5 saltlake at rdb boulevard  ever since I first went there for a treat. Before I begin the indulgence called the buffet, a word about the ambience...subtly nomadic, amidst an otherwise modern interior.the best thing about the buffet is the sheer variety of items they provide at a price at par with most other restaurants which may leave you wanting more...starters and desserts are the usp of this place with very few people who are interested in the main course! Desserts are yummy..you are spoilt for choice between almond slices, mudpies, hot gulabjamuns firni...its a paradise for those with a sweet tooth and love grilled food.

Planning for a Team Lunch and that also including the Higher management was always tough...You would never want a situation where.... the food is bad, the service is not classy, the ambience is dull etc, etc, etc......However if you really want to Play Safe....Barbeque Nation is the place to be!!
Please remember to book your table in advance as the place is always filled with food lovers, and try and catch the Early Bird Offer where they serve a Non-Veg Buffet for Rs-587 including a complimentary drink.
I need not explain about the Starters as they are all Yummy and the Hardcore Non- Vegetarians have a blast....(Please come really hungry)...eat till you feel u have had enough but the Service never stops providing you with the awesome food and also makes it a point that the Vegetarian people do not feel left out.
Main course is also awesome provided u can eat it after the awesome Prawn, Chicken, Mutton, Fish Starters.
Desserts has its own charm in BBQ Nation...various types and kinds of cakes, fruits, Firni and Ice-Ceam makes you feel that you have just completed a meal where you have ate like a King and satisfied too!!

It's a heaven for foodies. Taste, ambience, staffs are of the top notch. Not rated 5 only because it's available in only one corner of Kolkata.

Superb starters. Can hardly ever do justice to the main course because I always get so stuffed with the appetizers. Delicious desserts too. Friendly servers and while the live band doesnt have the best singers, it does keep the ambience cheerful and relaxing. Overall, I can find very little to complain about.

Oh these guys know how to pamper you! The service boys force you to eat and yes the barbecue items include chicken drumsticks, chicken breast, prawns, mushrooms, pineapple. The buffet spread is also nice but by the time you get to the spread, you are done already from the tandoori items!
The barbecue funda is a little out of place because everything placed on the grill is already barbecued and ready to eat. So leaving the barbecue hot plate beside, the ready to eat skewers with prawn, chicken, paneer, pineapples are no doubt good. The ambience is good too. Weekends it costs more per head while weekdays give you a better deal.

We went there for many times but I was overwhelmed this time..! I was finding potato in biriyani but failed to find it..So I asked one of them and got reply 'hm..we will see it.' And when i came back to my table , there were two potatoes in a bowl on my table..Oh..!Then I felt so good..!
It also happened several times that we told them that we were not liking the taste of any particular kebabs. They changed it immediately and chef came to us to talk about our disliking..
This is really nice..! Keep it up..!


------------------------------------------------------------------------
There were so many kababs  in starter...fish, chicken, prawn, mutton...mutton sheek kabab and garlic fish kababs were very good but prawn kabab was not so good. As we were so full with starters we almost skipped the main course.Though in main course , Chicken salad was very delicious. Desserts were very good too.So many options in dessert section made us happy. Gulabjamun and cheese cake were delectable.Very good experience...

This place has no competition as long as you are interested in kebabs and other Indian dishes. By kebabs I mean chicken, paneer, mutton, prawn, potato, fish, mushroom and virtually anything that can be placed inside a tandoor. The staffs over here are very friendly. They would be serving you kebabs stick after stick, and would help you reach your desired taste. What I mean is you can ask them to adjust the salt or chilly and they would do so in the next iteration of the sticks. You can customize the experience to this extent.
Apart from the kebabs the hyderabadi biriyani in the buffet is worth mentioning. I still wonder which was softer, the boneless mutton pieces in it or the potatoes. With an aroma of coriander and saffron, and the subtle sweetness of beresta it is a dish worth preserving a part of your appetite  from the kebabs.

My recent visit to this place. I am disappointed. The biriyani now comes with chicken. Perhaps they have ditched mutton for chicken to curb the cost. Or maybe they make it with chicken on some particular days of the week. The chicken sticks came very late, as they pushed more on the fish sticks which came in relentlessly. 
I will have a lunch once more before I change the ratings though, just to be sure that this is not a one off case.

What's the occasion today? Now that is the question you are going to ask yourself as you enter this restaurant. Like most of the eateries, it too, is boisterous but yet imparts a charm of it's own which none can complaint about. 
The ambience is quite neglected but that is easily overlooked by the jovial mood of the crowd and of course by the live band. 

I am not going to talk about the service as that is vestigial in this restaurant. Each table has got it's own barbecue stove which will surely promote those who are unschooled in this art.

Each day there are specific selections of barbecue that liberates us from a mundane experience. I am not going to be spoiler by telling you every chunk of the piece but would suggest the reader to have a practical acquaintance. 

This is the probably the best hub to hang out with your friends and make some noise. Make sure that you work yourself to be familiarised by the long queue which surely be worth it.

It's all in your mind they say.

When you land in barbeque nation it's not just the food but the service that impresses you.

Go for the grills and desserts.

Food has a lot of variety.Prawns and chicken cubes are delicious.Mocktails are tasty and you crave for more.
If you have a sweet tooth you will obviously love it in the end.

The staff are extra caring,trying to know your view point and improve every minute.Infact my companion complained about starters being too spicy,they brought a subdued version of the same.

There is a sudden burst of euphoria when the staff dance to the music and entertain the guests.Your fun moments are caught on camera and gifted to you.

If you want to have fun with some food...this is your destination.

It has one of the best buffet gourmets in the heart of Kolkata. By far one of the best restaurants to go for a buffet. The range of items is huge and you will have quite a number of things that you'll fall in love with whatever your taste is. The location is also good except for weekend dinners when you'll face a huge problem getting cabs.
The thing that surprised me the most is the taste of the Biryani. I have visited quite a number of good restaurants and had buffet but there is a common observation: You like the starters, main course is not so good and your review of dessert will depend on your specific taste. However, here, the moment I took a spoonful of biryani, the taste buds sat bolt upright. 
Also the waiters are great and its a nice place to hang out with both friends and family. Add to it, the long time for which you can actually sit and have your lunch. Great place, not only for the food but also for the behavior of the waiters.

It was BBQ Nation that brought the binge culture alive in Kolkata. The bong is a foodie, but little did he know that the binge quotient in him can really touch the ceiling when there is a place like BBQ Nation. I will candidly give it a 4.5 and why not, each time I take my family and friends there, joys galore!
I prefer hosting parties here, because I don't need to painstakingly place orders, and can still make everyone smile. Most people go ga-ga over the kebabs and desserts, and understandably so. They are truly outstanding. However there are a few things that I would want to point out which I personally like ...one, the veg kebabs that are equally good, two, the biryani that is oh so delicately flavorful (I am not an avadhi biryani fan, but I love it here for the lightness and aroma), three, the dessert ofcourse, esp. the firni, four, the complementary drinks (it was a novel concept back in 2010), five, the staff that is always so couteous (high five to them because it is not easy to keep your cool with a gloriously gluttonous crowd around demanding more and more food).
Also I would want to share that on my dad's bday party, they made it truly special with a mini cake and a candle. It was a sweet gesture which shall always be remebered endearingly. Thanks!

Great place, good ambience, nice professional staff.

Food: kebabs are just awesome, be it chicken, mutton or fish, all were too good to decide which one should you gulp more :P
Could not have much of the main course, as I wanted to save for the dessert...there were 5-6 items in the dessert and I liked most of them...

One incident that took place, when they asked for our feedback, one of my orriya friend said he did not like the fish kebab. Guess what, to compensate, the shef served us with the most delicious fish kebabs we ever had and also fried ice cream :)

I would strongly recommend Barbeque Nation, its value for money...

There are many great restaurants in Kolkata, but I must say nothing comes close to Barbeque Nation. Me and my friends were in complete admiration of this restaurant's service, ambience and food, especially the starters.

Me and my two friends went there to have lunch on a hot Saturday afternoon. One of my friend's birthday was on that day. So we planned to celebrate it in Barbeque Nation. It was their second visit but for me it was my first time. So, I bought a cake but we had to wait outside for a couple of minutes as there was no place inside. I found it interesting to see such a rush at that time.

After waiting for some time we went in. The restaurant was having an African theme; something called 'Hakuna Matata". The walls were full of African paintings and the decorative artifacts also consisted of some kind of African masks. We sat and the starters came. They were all kebabs, consisting of Potato, Corn and then Chicken, Fish and Prawn Kebab, Mutton Seekh Kebab and Chicken Tangri. They were all delicious. I found the Fish Kebab a little less spicy but everything else was wonderful.

Then I went for the main course. There was some African soup, chicken biryani, some chicken dish, an African style mutton dish, sarson macchi, chicken salad, sea food salad and pasta. The chicken biryani was awesome and others were also not bad. But I didn't like the mutton and sarson macchi that much. The smell of mustard in sarson macchi was a little overpowering. The mutton lacked enough flavors. But overall the main course was top-notch.

Then I went for desserts. They had firni, vanilla ice-cream and various syrups for adding on the ice-cream, chocolate cake, tart, pastry, hot Gulab Jamun, watermelon slices and papaya. All were delightful but I found the chocolate cake to be a little hard. And it would have been nice if they had kept some more ice-cream toppings like dry fruits or some other flavor of ice-cream.

In the end my friend cut his birthday cake which I bought and since we were already full, we gave the cake to the waiters and they thanked us for this gratitude. They liked our gesture so much that, they came with a camera a little later and took our photo and then presented us a hard copy of that photo with a happy birthday greetings card. I was really surprised and happy to see this kind of behavior and service. I will definitely come again here to be welcomed by the courteous staff of Barbeque Nation.

Value for money is some thing comes to my mind while thinking about Bar B Que Nation.
Had been to BBQ Nation atleast a dozen of times but can't recollect the entire spread at one go....

Let us start from the begining...
Prawn Kebab, Fish Kebab & Mutton Kebab are the few worth remembering from the starter.

Main course I had never been much interested in. Bt have always tried little bit of Mutton Biryani.

Another unforgettable part is the desserts. The hot gulab jamun, firni, unlimited icecream..... its simply a wow experience.

Concept Dining, Awesome service are the two pillars that balances this highly popular restaurant in Kolkata.

The kebabs..be it the prawns or the basa fish are something that this place is famous for.the desserts are a beautiful blend of Bengali gulab jamun and English cakes and tarts.
What really amazed us was the service.the cook himself came up to ask about the food quality and when we told him about the chicken kebab not being so juicy,he immediately sent us freshly grilled ones.this is definitely one of the best dining options in Kolkata!

Was here one sunny afternoon in April with 25-odd friends. Had heard all the hype about this place and in my book, that's not a good thing, because expectations soar higher than they should when a place is highly recommended and the experience usually turns out to be lacklustre. So I stepped in with an air of skepticism, into an interior done up nicely. We were shown to a row of three tables (we had to wait a long, long time for that, though) and I immediately noticed the sparkling glasses hung above the bar which created quite the effect with their dazzle. We tried the buffet there and my doubts about the place were dispelled as soon as the starters were ushered in and I had munched into one of them. The kebabs are so good their flavour lingers in your mouth long after you have dispatched them to your stomach. The Paneer Naseman Tikka was especially juicy and succulent and the luscious Mutton Till Seekh Kabab was the right mix of subtle and spicy. The best thing is that their range keeps changing with time so you may get to taste something absolutely different from that which is listed in the menu here but still very scrumptious. And what's more, they keep replenishing the empty grills with more kebabs hot from the kitchen until you are satiated and bid them to stop! I remember not having much of an appetite for the main course but there was an equally delectable array of delicacies on offer in that segment. The desserts were pure bliss and here again, the variety on offer was jaw-dropping, to say the least. I have an insatiable sweet tooth so I tried them all but not all of them were as good- the small cheesecakes were stale, for instance, and the ice-cream was very ordinary. But do try their phirnee and the hot gulab jamuns- I loved those!
A word for the service-they were very friendly and hospitable and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable, right from arranging the seats and then the food.
A very memorable experience because of the starters and the desserts. I had indulged myself so much that afternoon (or evening, to be precise) that I just had doughnuts for dinner and still felt full. I am definitely going back there, maybe to try the same stuff again!
It was a treat, sponsored by me and a few other friends but the pocket pinch was still lower than I had anticipated, because of the disparity between the actual prices and those reported here.

This is THE place where I have to visit at least once a month. Best buffet spread available in town. Unlike other kebab-on-the-flame restaurants, this one actually makes the main courses a delight, sweet dishes are to be savored to the fullest . They bring variety on your plate every single time, often you'll find food fests going on.

In a word this is a complete value for money restaurant you'll find in Kolkata.

Okay so people there's nothing new to talk about Barbeque Nation a 4.5 / 5 is an understatement. It should be 5/5!!
The only reason why i would deduct a .5 is that there were many a times the place was full and we had to return with a long place only to return the next day, those disappointing days when we couldn't have barbeque nation's food can sum up and deduct .5... they must take up a bigger place soon!!!!!!
Everytime in Zomato we talk about the food but this time I wanna to talk about its Service : impeccable, excellent, surprisingly pleasant, makes you feel like a king and queen!! I absolutely love their service, i doubt who would not.

Food -- Brilliant!!! though can add more chocolate desserts, guess i just want more n more :)

Can open more outlets so that everytime we dont have to visit sector 5 for it !!! 

Loved the place, totally!

One stop moment of truth. 
No one comes here for the buffet. Its all about the grills, the meat (or the vegetarian, and they are equally wonderful!) and the smoke that let's you know you are about to enter into a Kebab frenzy. Does Barbeque need my review? No. They are good at what they do. You know, I have always been very positive about people who know how to work hard. Because it shows. And when its about food being served? 

Barbeque has set its own genre hasnt it?

It was a pre-exam night. And I wanted all the kebab gloriously basking before me. I wanted the buffet too! But obviously without the intermediate, dal, chawal chicken legs! The ending should always be as marvellous as the beginning. I am a dessert person, and I loved those small earthen pots of firni that they had served that day. I had six of them, or maybe seven... And what else I have to say?

Keep up the good work! Its a good deed to feed people well.

One of the best places for a buffet meal at a reasonable price. The starters section is huge and the kebabs and fishes are served with skewers and the waiters will serve them till the flag mast is lowered. Barbeque Nation was observing sea food festival during my last visit and the chef's special on that day was tandoori shark which was the best starter I ever had at this place. One pint of beer is complimentary. The main course is decent. The desert section is again huge and finishes the hearty meal very well. The waiters are helpful and serve with smiling faces. The chef visits the patrons and ask them for suggestions. The location is excellent and is well patronized by the staffs of the IT district. A highly recommended place for kebabs, tandoori prawns and deserts.

The awesomest (sic) restaurant I've ever been to. The food, the decor, the service everything was pretty much out of the world. Once the kebabs start rolling in you will forget everything else and start stuffing like you have escaped fresh from a famine. The chicken fish prawn and mutton all of them were pretty awe-freaking-some. They would give flame and grill, their penurious cousin a run for their money any given day. I never thought the main course could get better but against all odds, it did and how. 

About the main course, the biriyani was perfectly moist and the mutton brilliantly soft. The platter of salads and the raita was great too. I felt bad I could not eat more as I was too filled up on kebabs. 

The dessert section had variety and each of the items was delectable. The phirnee was indescribably good. One thing that pleased me the most the service which was as courteous as it ever gets. 
And wait, they serve complementary beer too! Haha!

I have recently been there on 10th May,2014.I reached there around 2pm.This is the first time i went there with my girlfriend for our celebration of years of togetherness.As i entered,the ambience was awsum,the service people,restaurant manager was too were very cordial to us.The food line up started with the super delicious starters.The starters were so yummy that you will feel not to end.There was a turn down flag to discontinue starters,trust me you have to put it down because there is such a long varied list of yummy starters that you will be over without going to the main course.Then we moved on to the main course,i would like to point out that the main course was also of that level,the chicken dum biriani was too tasty,the thai fried fish,all the items was given an african cuisine speciality.

The funny thing that was goin at the back of my mind was as if whether am into the famous satyajit ray's goopi gayne baga byne film where one clap is bringing all my wishlist of delicious food.

The main course also comprised of lovely chicken salad,prawn salad and other items too.After the main course,the varied list of deserts will bring out the child in you.The icecreams,chocolate cake,chocolate cream cake,firni,mango wafers,gulab jamun and 1 or items too.
Then the suprise thing that happened which made my visit unforgettable is,one of the restaurant manager came to us and asked whether something was special and to our suprise they brought us a jelly fruit cake which was finger lickingly delicious with candles,then we celebrated our 1st year of togetherness.They clicked our picture and gifted us a lovely greeting card with our picture.

I would refer this to all foodies like me to experience your dream of foody world in reality..and you never know stories would also be made on your visit too. :)

It was my first time. i called them to know about the price & way to book tables. the way we had the conversation it clearly left a mark on their standard of service. i called them on the day in the morning but somehow they were not able to receive the call but they called me back...truly showed their class. next was the usual talk about the ambience....TOP CLASS...the lights, atmosphere, the table everything was perfect. on getting a place to sit we were first asked served water. next the we were asked whether we are ready for lunch. on getting a positive reply the began serving. we ordered non-veg so starter was of chicken, fish,prawn,mutton. the waiters were serving extremely fast. whenever the grill was empty they quickly asked us what we would like & it was served to us. ooo i forgot to mention they also serve a complimentary drink (thums-up, sprite,mirinda,beer).they kept on repeating the starters until you ask them not to. 
then came the part of main course at least 4-5 different non-veg items would be there ranging from fish, chicken, mutton and prawn & egg!!!! with the option of 2 type of rice & 2 type of bread. they also had 2 types of soup!!!!!! man my stomach was saying "I am almost full" but then my eyes fell on the dessert counter. it was like..........really very hard to express.
The desserts were again splendid especially the chocolate brownie, gulab jamun and pineapple pastry. The cheese cake needs to get better. We again loved the service as we were served cheese cake at our table when the fresh stock arrived. To top it all, we were served a special plate of freshly baked cake. I liked the idea of keeping fresh fruits as desserts because that kind of balanced the extreme sweetness.A special mention to the ice-cream really delicious........
truly speaking, the buffet spread is HUGE and a normal foodie can't eat such enormous food offered in a single buffet. this is the BEST buffet of the town. 
Last the price we went on a wednesday for lunch we made there by 12:30pm & was charged 587/-rs per person without tax....
SIMPLY LOVED IT & I AM SURELY COMING BACK NEXT TIME.....

Well i am not a huge buffet fan which made me this late to visit bbq nation! With sour experience of haka's buffet i thought it wont b that good also. But it bound me to change all my preconceived notions!

The foremost thing is that blew me is "Hell lot of Options" in the menu & the second is "Food Quality". 

Even the staffs out there are so good! They are friendly, warm & immediately act according to ur wishes.

This is definitely one of the best place i have visited in recent times.

like everyone i also found the experience to be really good. i dont want to echo what others already mentioned about this wonderful place but rather leave a negative note about this place..during the buffet when we asked for repairs for cold drinks they told that it would be chargable...it was really strange and didnt find any cause for it.....

I went over here on my birthday this year with my friend to give him a buffet treat. We had to wait for around 5minutes before we were allotted our seats. Firstly I must mention about the staffs here who are very courteous and helpful. They helped us in every way by making us aware of the dishes being served, knowing our preferences and making us feel comfortable as well. The buffet began with a variety of kebabs; veg and non-veg which tasted awesome. We were also given complementary drinks as well along with starters. I opted for fresh lime soda while my friend preferred beer. We were so full after the starters that we had to wait for a while before heading for the main course. In the main course I loved everything except the fish preparation which tasted very normal just like those we have for lunch everyday at home. But it was obviously not that bad. Then the desert portion was full of my favorites. There were chocolate cakes, fruits, vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce, pudding, pastry, gulab jamun, etc. I was more than satisfied with my birthday lunch. Barbeque Nation gifted me an awesome experience. I just have one request- Please try to open a branch at south kolkata. :) :)

The food in one wrd is -awsummmm. But i am not talking abt the main course. Its the starters that makes all the difference. Varying cuisines, taste, shape and flavour this place has got the best starters in the town. Nd not to mention the desserts. The main food in between - u can skip tht. But make sure u dnt miss the starters nd the dessert. O those small gulab jamons.. :*

Food - 9
Ambience - 9
Starters and desserts - 20.. :-)

A name all are familiar with whenever buffet or kababs are discussed. Definitely a fitting name to the variety of kababs being offered.
We were a group of 3 people visiting this place for the first time and we enjoyed it completely.
There are kababs being served till the point you ask them not to.
Chicken, mutton, fish, prawn and exotic fruit...all grilled and served hot. Though prawns are a bit risky but rest of the kababs you can have till you are full.
The main course is a bit dull as compared to the colorful kababs presented but it also happen that you are too full to have another bite of main course after the never ending starters.
What finds a special mention is the line of dessert being displayed. You just can't decide which one you would like to have once more than the rest of the bunnch. But my personal favorite still is the "CHEESECAKE" and the "MINI GULABJAMUNS" couldn't have enough of them.
So just go and ravish all the delicacies and remember to have a spare stomach ready in case you run out of places.

Been to ths place about a dozen times!! Their food and hospitality is unparalleled! The starters are mouth watering and something to die for!! So are the anguri gulan jamun, desserts...! Been fortunate to have been served shark on a couple of occasions bt its nt a regular item! The price has gone up a bit in the recent yrs bt its bearable fr the quality of food! 
The only scope of improvement is the main course, which doesnt live up to its reputation!!
Overall, the best restaurant in kolkata at present!! A big big thumbs up!!

Barbeque nation has been a long time favorite of mine. I always go there by 6.30 so that i can get enough time to enjoy the variety of dishes presented there. I went there on 1st may (our anniversary) to have dinner. Was greeted warmly by the manager and and gave us a seat. We started having the delicious spread soon. there was special basa fish which was awesome. the punjabi tangree was another superb preparation. there were 5-6 non veg starters(prawn, 2 chicken, 2 fish, mutton) and 5-6 veg starters(vegetables, paneer, aloo, mushroom and a roll). There is always a huge rush for people to have the starters. Then comes the main course which is even a longer list with all sorts of food, both veg and non veg. Some people like me have the energy to walk up to the main course while the rest plunge towards the desserts. The desserts section generally contains hot gulab jamuns, ice cream with 3 types of sauce, firni, fresh cut fruits, cheese cakes or brownies, different tarts and black forest pastry.

The real surprise for us came after the dinner when the manager came up to  the table to wish us a happy anniversary with a cake and a candle on top of it. We were spell bound by the surprise. on asking on how did they come to know of this fact the told me that they had kept the feedback form with the details in their database and matched it with the phone number i provided while entering the restaurant. They took a snap of us having dinner and made a beautiful card out of it. We felt really special on the day. Thanks a lot Barbeque Nation.

Amazingly good food and service at reasonable rates.
The sheer quantity and quality of the offerings coupled with the fact that it is served piping hot- the kebab skewers are kept on a love grill at each table and you are given a choice of marinades to roast them with if you so desire.
     Coming to the food, they offer 5 different veg and non veg starters each in addition to several other starters that aren't mentioned on the menu. For veg they have paneer, potato, grilled vegetables, mushroom and pineapple. Non veg has fish, chicken, prawn and mutton.
The main course is nothing to write home about and honestly after the starters you wouldn't be bothered to try it.
The deserts however are heavenly. They have amazing gulabjamuns, ice cream with several types of glazing, pastries, cake, phirni...
And the best part, if some item isn't in the buffet, they prepare it for you.
And lastly their service is brilliant and they don't even accept tips!

Warning- go early or make a reservation else you'll be forced to wait. I had to wait for almost 45 minutes myself.

Barbecue nation is one of the best restaurants i've been to... Not even kolkata but in any city I visit. But my recent visit to bbn was not less than a shock. The buffet was 1000 rupees. Generally in other cities its around 600-650 rs. Food is good no doubt... But its definately not worth 1000 bucks.

The ambience was quite good. Heard a lot about the kebabs before coming here-but the chicken kebabs were not up to the mark as they were not crispy and the portioning was not good, the prawn kebabs were good but even then the prawn sizes were not big. The fish kebabs were quite good but the chicken legs stole the show among them.The chicken legs were crispy,big and were tasty. The main course was just normal and the complimentary drink accepted-Lime Soda was Ok.The deserts were quite relishing-starting from the Gulaab Jamun to the Sheer Korma to the Strawberry Cake and also the Icecream with Chocolate Sauce. Overall a good experience, but found nothing special to distinguish it from Flame N Grill.

Like kebabs? Frequent on buffet? Looking for that warm service? This is the place. Been there multiple times and am sure will go there ever and ever again. Their kebabs - Starting from veg (aloo and paneer) to non veg (Chicken, fish, mutton and prawn) are just fabulous. The prawns had been the best always. Talking of the main course, you would be lucky if you get the biryani and mutton raganjosh on your day. Try their wide spread of desserts as well. 

Never could I try all their dishes on a single day..such is the variety!!

i have been to bbq nation quite a few times and i must say they have the most elaborate buffet of the town. this place is always buzzing with people from all corners of the electronics sector and i like the ambiance here. they have various buffet options and pricing to suit your taste and i like the way they have planned it.
food starts with various kebabs served hot on the table. kebabs include veg (aalu,paneer) and non veg (fish, chicken, mutton, prawn). you can have as much as you can since they offer unlimited in the buffet. they would put a small chullah in the table and serve the kebabs upon it to keep them tender and hot all the time. the kind waiters would keep bringing the kebabs to you until you ask them to stop :)
coming to the main course, not much to write for as i don't have much space left in my stomach after gulping such an enormous amount of kebabs. but, that doesn't mean the main course has less items. you will be amazed to see the number of offerings present in the main course and the variety of it. at least 4-5 different non-veg items would be there ranging from fish, chicken, mutton and prawn again. finally the dessert must be mentioned separately. you will get at least 8-10 different options raging from gulab jamun, ice creams, custard, fruit salad, cakes/pastries, kheer, gajar halwa and what not!!
truly speaking, the buffet spread is HUGE and a normal foodie can't eat such enormous food offered in a single buffet. they also serve alcohol if you want to sip a drink or two during the starters being offered.
this is the BEST buffet of the town. period. a must visit for everybody who love kebabs and tandoori dishes.

It is one of the best places for having buffet meals. the quality of food is great , no doubt..  i have been there 5 or six times.. and everytime i was satisfied to the core. my only suggestion to the owner is that they should bring variety in desserts and starters. Moreover they have the same startes as flame n grill.. so it sort of doesnt highlight them, specially for foodies. since I have been there so many times, now I dont feel like going there anymore, because I get the same menu everytime. but no doubt there food quality is great.. the menu is huge. the service is one of the best. I have never seen any waiter there having a stern look or who is tired of serving so many tables at the same time.. 

so one should try ii out at least once or twice.

Absolutely awed by the spectacular experience at barbeque nation last monday night. We were simply spellbound by the whole experience. I would give more brownie points to the service than the food. The starters were delicious especially the mutton seekh kabab and the kasundi fish. The oriental barbequed prawn needed to be barbequed a bit more. The best thing was the way the waiters kept on enquiring about the food. Even the chef came and had a talk with us.The prawns were ushered back after being grilled a bit more. They even served us a chef's special prawn starter. Loved the gesture! The main course was good but not as good as the starters. But special mention needs to be taken of the dum biriyani and the mutton duckbunglow. The dessersts were again spendlid especially the chocolate brownie, gulab jamun and pineapple pastry. The cheese cake needs to get better. We again loved the service as we were served cheese cake at our table when the fresh stock arrived. To top it all, we were served a special plate of freshly baked cake. I liked the idea of keeping fresh fruits as desserts because that kind of balanced the extreme sweetness. Thanks barbeque nation for serving an ever memorable dinner

Four of us friends went in,got fresh lime sodas and behold what comes in next.The most succulent,tasty piece of babecued chicken i have ever tasted(and ive tasted alot of these).They put in a grill in the middle of each table.Serve the kebabs on it.There were baby potatoes,pineapples,mushrooms,prawns,fish,mutton,chicken and paneer kebabs.They keep serving you with utmost generosity and insist you have more,until you turn the flag down which says Serve Me No More.
The main course was a huge spread including soups,salads,rice,noodles,various curries and stews.
I was really excited about the dessert section but it was a let down.The cheesecake was too spongy and the brownie too dry.Though the firni and mini gulab jamuns were excellent.

What really sets this place apart from the rest is the sheer magnitude and variety of quality food they serve.And they do it with a smile.

Highly Recommended.

food was good. as the hotel is there for preety long time now at sector 5 in kolkata, so the hotel waiters are sick of serving to customers, what i felt. we initially took unlimited food package. so there was unlimited kebabs. but waiters were serving us more of fish kebabs than chicken. when asked for it, waiter  behaved rude, told me "sir first have the fish and then i will give you chicken". i did not like it. hotels should know that we are paying money and not coming to eat for free. so waiters be careful next time some body gonna get hurt real bad. 
please know that customers needs respect so if you do not give them respect, you will never get respect in return. NOTE < NOTE< NOTE

I went with my 5 friends yesterday for the dinner buffet. As the restaurant is always full, we r being asked to wait for 30 - 45 mins. Thanks to the front desk, we got our table well before the stated time. 

The food was really good (in starter n dessert section), though I expected some more varieties in the main course.

The brownie points went down for the service, they were a bit reluctant and I found them a little unhygienic while they were clearing the plates from our table.

Overall, its a good experience n I will surely recommend THE barbecue nation to others.

This might be one of the best restaurants in Kolkata. Barbeque Nation lives up to concept of eat as much as you can is totally awesome. If you are in Kolkata you should never miss this one.Loved the concept of live charcoal grills on your table itself for the kebabs and starters.

The starters are great, and with the complimentary beer they serve, the tandoori chicken just makes your day. Veg is equally delicious here as compared to Non Veg,with a wide variety of kebabs for both. Loaded with starters to my neck, i didn't even dare to look at the main course, though they looked delicious. Deserts were awesome, especially the brownie and the mango pastry.

The hospitality and service is super awesome. We had some issue with the food, they swiftly changed  the dishes and the chef himself came to our table to ensure about the food. 

They will just ensure that you keep on coming back to  Barbeque Nation. I suggest every foodie has got to try it.

As the name suggests the only thing this place is good for is the barbecues. Once past the starters, the main course tastes bland. I have had better biriyani in local joints. So my suggestion would be to keep the flag up and hog on as many kebabs as you can. The fish kebab needs special mention. They did not have it on the menu the day we visited, but on special request the chef prepared a serving especially for us. Good points for Barbeque Nation there on customer satisfaction. Then jumping straight to the desserts. The had generous servings of pudding and pastries along with gulab jamun. Just the right recipe to hit the sweet spot of a Bong ;-)

The best buffet. Period. Unlimited kebabs, each of which is al dente..perfecto!
3 tips-
1. If you are having non-veg, they might not give you the veg specials like mushroom etc. Don't forget to ask. They definitely wouldn't refuse a customer
2. There's a happy hour which they never publicize, which is, on weekdays if you enter by 12.30, you will be charged flat 500 (which might have increased by a little) including taxes.
3. After a inhuman amount of Kebab stuffing, you might be the kind who shifts directly to desserts. But, wait a minute. If you go past their Biriyani and Prawns in the main course, it might be the greatest mistake in your life.

An amazing restaurant
I have been to this place more times than any other restaurant in Kolkata. 
What I like about this place is the quantity. Like most people, I would also say that the quality is not the best I have ever eaten but it is great and combined with amazing variety of food that the restaurant  is easily my favourite in Kolkata.
I have lived here for only two years. So, there a lot of restaurant I have not visited.
Now coming back to BBQ Nation
What I love
1. The Starters
Stupendous. The variety is excellent and each dish is perfect. Again its not better than individual orders that is served in most restaurant but it is great for the amount and variety offered. In Veg I love the Cajun Spice Potato. In non veg, the prawns are easily the winner. I also like the mutton sheek kabab and Chicken Tandoori ( I dont remember exact names).
2. The Speed
Fast. Really quick. They will ask you whether you will eat veg or non veg. And then they serve whatever drink you order and the starters are served immediately. 

What I dont like
1. The empty stage. I have been to this restaurant more than 5 times and only one time out of those visits, they had live music. Now, I am not expecting a guy to sit there all day and sing and other people to play the instruments. But from
19:00 to 23:00, I think there should be someone there. This restaurant has a branch in Ahmedabad. I visited it frequently (Because it was very close to my apartment not because it was my favorite). Every time that I had dinner at that place, there were musicians/
2. Desserts
Okay, I didnt expect them to have amazing desserts considering the variety and amount of dishes available. But, still I expect the restaurant to have decent ice creams.

What I hate
1. Only one thing
The main course. 
It lacks variety. Yes they have kept a lot of different things. But I would never visit this restaurant for its main course. 
This is the reason I gave it a 3.5. Else, it was easily a 4.0 restaurant.

If you love grilled food ... its one of the best stops Kolkata offers. You love the chicken and prawn kebabs but the basa (fish) kebabs seems to steal the show always. The staff are cordial and try their level best to ensure you never feel ashamed to ask for just one more round ( after the numerous rounds of starters you have already taken in and lost count of). The main course as always seems to be a tad shady but the desserts make it up.

Food is good, price is cheaper compared to the location of the restaurant and quality of food. Its just 750 bucks per head for non veg buffet lunch.

Have to say this one is one of the best restaurant I have visited in Kolkata.. The ambience was brilliant so was the food.. The table having the grilled thing one is amazing.. The starters were brilliant.. The main course was also very good.. I have already visited Barbeque Nation 3 times and would love to visit more..
3-9-2014..
Okay so this was my 4th visit to the restaurant... Though the price have increased a bit but the food there was brilliant.. In the starters they had Prawn, Chicken, Fish, Chicken Tangri Kabab, Mutton seekh kabab.. The starters were brilliant.. Loved every bit of it.. Then they had a main course with Hot and Sour Chicken soup, Biriyani and fish,mutton Nd chicken as the side dish.. among these three the Fish preparation was the best according to me.. But what surprised me this time was the deserts.. The deserts this time were mind blowing.. The anguri gulab jamuns, Mexican Pie, Chocolate pastry, Firni, ice cream.. But the best one was the Blue sea cheese cake.. It was brilliant.. The color and the taste was brilliant..

Been there three times and each time the experience was well .......FULL   -  FILLING. Full  & filled separately . and on 25 th December  the special christmas buffet was something to die for .  But for all the people who happen to be first time visitors .My humble advice is please don't overfill yourselves with the sumptuous kebabs and starters since, some of the best preparations await you on the buffet table .  The service is unbelievable .  the waiters are courteous . The cook has the habiit of jumping outta the kitchen and asking you about the food (that's mushy) .   

Whenever you come ..... please come in leisure . sit back and  eat till you drop . the prices are reasonable, considering the taste of the kebabs and the service .

And to top it all they don't take any tips  (why so ?)  . I myself quite humbly passed on a tip to which they replied  they have a no tips policy . If the food on offer is a surprise , this is a shock .  

Anyways  when i  limped back out of the restaurant .  i could feel my  tummy tallking to me , it sure sounded angry . probably i had a couple of kebabs too many .

I have been to this place a few times, but more recently I went there twice during the sea food festival held in Mar-14 end. Of course I don't think anybody ever complains about food quantity in barbeque nation. 

The good: Good service, at least in the beginning, we had the waiters as well as a what seemed a consulting chef discussing food quality issues and even making alterations to help us. There were also quite a few new items on the menu which made it more exciting. I liked the red snapper and the basa as also fried sweet corn among others. The so called shark was ok but nothing special.

The bad: none of the exotic items that they had come up with, except for maybe the red snapper, was anything to write home about. The mussels, the squid, the king fish, the basa, they were all cooked in the same way in the sauce (mussels were undercooked). The calamari was the size of a baby's ring than the actual size of  an onion ring and even the staff were blissfully unaware of this fact, not to mention it was not the most fresh thing one could get. No effort has gone in making the main course at all more exciting, I had to literally search for octopus with a microscope in the octopus whatever curry they had made. If you want your USP to be starters only then just do away with the main course.

I can‚Äôt believe I have not reviewed this restaurant earlier. how can I miss it? I have visited this place at least 10 times in last 2 years. It‚Äôs befitting that this becomes my 50th review. The concept of eat as much as you can is really tempting. It goes without saying that you overeat every time you go to this place. After a while you just want to put the flag down(you know what I mean). The kebabs are not very great but the sheer variety will keep you glued to your place. The novel concept of delivering smoking charcoals on your table is very good. They also serve customized kebabs for example on one visit we wanted grilled chicken without any spice for my nephew and they happily obliged. Another time I complained that prawns are too spicy and they immediately served a fresh round of prawn which were crispy and with less spices. The service is amazing even when they are jam packed. I also like the live band playing on week day evenings. The main course buffet spread is average with mustard fish, biriyani, kaali daal etc. the daal is yummy though. I generally skip the main course and go directly to desserts. The desserts are yummy here. The choco fudge brownie, sweet gulab jamuns with hot ice cream and chocolate sauce, fresh fruits, firni‚Ä¶you name it and I love it. If you have not booked your table then be rest assured that you will have to wait around 30 minutes. But that wait is totally worth it. So anytime you are in the mood to celebrate food go to Barbeque Nation. It will not disappoint you.

Heard about their buffet a lot and being recommended by many of my friends but never had the chance to visit this place. But this Saturday I got the chance to visit this place. We opted for the Saturday non veg buffet. The buffet started with different types of Kebabs- Prawn, Chicken, Fish ,Chicken Tengri Kebab and Mutton Sausage. We ate a lot of Kebabs( seriously a lot) until our stomach gave us a call " Stop it dude".. Then we went on for the Main Course and Side dishes. I tasted all the things that were there started from Non Veg Dum Biryani, Fish Fry, Mutton Dukbangalow, Chicken some dish don't remember the name and then went for the different types of Salads and some the veg dishes. This didn't end here. I went to the desserts portion and had Double Chocolate pudding, Gulab Jamun( very sweet), Mexican Pie, Fruit Cake, Firni, Ice Creams and in fruits Water Melon and Papaya. This was pretty much I had that day and really my first visit to this place. The service by the way was really really good and I loved the food. All in all I am looking forward to visit this place again in near future without any doubt and I thank Barbeque Nation for giving us such a good experience.

superb ratings, high expectations, some distance, bit of a queue, decent decor, happiness to get a seat, lots of skewers, various preplated starters, attentive staff service, tucked up tummy, average buffet, pocket isn't drained, leave out satisfied  !!!!!!!!!

Located in Sector V in RDB bldg beside Infinity, Barbeque nation has been the most trending restaurant in zomato since forever. The restaurant is quite big, spacious enough and seats are pretty comfortable. The decor is decent though nothing grand about it and a bit to my disliking. The staff is pretty attentive and try to customise ur starters to ur liking. When going for places like these, speed of skewers being replaced matters and the place does good here.

Coming to starters, there are 4-5 starters served live on skewers and another 4-5 that are served direct to ur plates. I have always felt that the kebabs served live aren't that great be it here or Flame n Grill but the fact that u can have them unlimited makes up for it. Appreciable fact is that the staff tries to satisfy the customers with marination as per ur liking to their level best. After having all the starters, hardly any space is left for having the main course.

No matter how much i have stuffed up myself with the kebabs, i love to have the main course and the place disappoints in this respect. The spread is pretty good with quite a few preparations that aren't exactly traditional but i am not so fond of their main course vegatables except black dal which is nice. Desserts section is pretty good and has quite a number of options one can try with firni being my favorite.

Comparing it with flame and grill (FNG), i feel this place offers greater variety in starters and desserts, better and faster service but FNG gives a more grand feeling and a better buffet.

Somehow every time i have visited this place during lunch time i have been disappointed with the food quality. If you're really hungry only then I would suggest you to visit this place.
Though the staff is courteous. If you provide them with a feedback they will certainly take care of your complaints. Visit this place for the kebabs and desserts. Items on the main course can be given a miss..

The best restaurant in Kolkata I think. I am a huge fan of those grilled dishes. Labanese Chicken shiks, Porn kebabs are very very tasty. Their caption The World On A Grill says about the quality of food indeed. Main courses are also great but I dont like the veg dishes so much. Biriyani tastes good and the side courses are mouth watering. There were several kind of salads and I taste every one of them. One cant eat the main course too much because of the excellent starters. Last part of the meal is the delicious and mouth watering- the deserts. There were several kind of cakes, cut fruits, sweets, ice cream and firni. The gulab jamun is the best gulab jamun I have ever tasted. I made 15 gulabjamuns!!!! The server boys are always very caring to the customers. One can not simply have the main course because of the kebabs and deserts, they are too much tasty. There were approximately 30 items and one pays only 555+ tax. But drinks were not free. Although there was a complementary drink like cola, sprite, beer etc which one can consume without paying any extra cost. That was a great lunch for me and I am very much eager for my next visit.

Been there for veg lunch buffet and all I got was disappointing lunch. The grill starters were already half burnt before they were bought, then the special starters where tasteless.
The soup was ok.
The ice tea was well prepared.
In the main course the paneer was the only thing which was upto the mark all other vegies were not upto the bar b q nations mark.
The desterts was the best of the lot.
I have been to the bbq nations mumbai and bangalore also and they are far more better and have far better menu compared to this place. One word to dwscribe the place if u r a veggie please stay away.

To be honest this is the place for people who loves to eat rather devour food.
The starters and desserts are just awesome. Nowhere else you can get such good starters and varieties of desserts in buffet.
Food cost is a very much in accordance with the quality and variety of food they provide.
Must go place for all.
They even ask for feedback and if you are not satisfied they will provide you with alternate dishes

Now this is what I call 'Pura paisa vasool'. Before I come to food I would really like to thank them for the wonderful hospitality and service that they rendered. A hospitable host is always brings the extra flavour to the food. They offered complimentary drinks as per your choice(beer, soft drink, fresh lime soda, ice tea) and soon the sea of kabas started pouring in. Just to make the meal more satisfying we requested them to mix up the vegetarian and the non vegetarian starters. Vegetarian kebabs were as good as the non veg ones. My personal favourite was the aloo kabab, falafel, mutton sheekh kabab and the murgh tikka kabab. We tried 3-4 helpings of each kabab and were totally full. That was a time for little chit chat over the drinks to digest the servings of meat you have gulped down. Post that we moved on to the main course and helped ourselves with some chicken clear soup. It really served as an appetizer to the biriyani and the rest of the spread. We started off with some chicken salad and sea food salad, some mutton biriyani, some chicken mutton and fish. We also tasted the vegetarian cuisines which were really good. The final dessert was mouth watering. Here's where the restaurant could improve a bit or bring in something innovative. They had iceceam with chocolate sauce and honey, strawberry cheese cake, firni, pastries, fruits, cakes, puddings and gulaab jamuns. The whole experience was really nice and we walked out of the restaurant well fed, contented.

Starved all day, and drove down to this place with parents. Winters are always the best time to eat all you can. The menu stays the standard. Starters have always been the favourite, and with a couple of beers you can keep going on. Desserts were elaborate yet light. They have got the menu right and the place leaves you with no complains.

It was my friend's birthday treat. Being a weekday I had thought maybe getting a table won't be a problem. But whoa! How wrong was I. There was a huge waiting and we had to wait an hour. It is better you try to get a reservation rather than going there impromptu.

However, I believe the wait was worth it.. I usually over eat at my favorite places but this time, I think I broke all my records. I have never overeaten so much in my life!

After taking order of drinks, the waiters started giving out the starters.
Truly speaking the starters are enough to fill your belly and you just don't need to even go near the main course.. I couldn't even count the number of starters we were served.
The starters were good..my favorite being paneer tikka. The only thing I didnt like was that they were rushing this time- unlike the last time when they took everything easily. The starters were thrown on the barbeque one on the another which wasn't impressive. 
Other than this, I must say the service was good.

Coming to the main course, we actually had to wait for awhile to have it- that's how full we all were!
Main course was decent . because I was already full from the starters I don't think I can judge it correctly. They tasted well though. There were options of rotis, 3 sabzis, biryani and salads ( I just saw the vegetarian section. Do not know much about the non-vegetarian section).
After filling myself with the main course I took a short break again and moved towards the deserts. 
The deserts looked good. My favourite being vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce- I took 3 damn servings of it :3
The other options were gulaab jaamun and black forest cake. 

Overall, I loved the experience. On some fronts, the experience was better than my last visit and the opposite for some other fronts.



----- 21 Jul, 2013 -----

The first thing that strikes you as soon as you enter this restaurant is its similarity with flame & grill.. & well, for me , when it comes to the the taste of the food- flame and grill wins. 

I'm a vegetarian so my reviews go that way-
The option of kebabs on the skewers were less, however, we couldn't get enough of the waiters serving us various other items again and again. 

The place is extremely crowded and noisy, though somehow because it is so spacious, it doesn't get IRRITATING. 
I loved the baby corn & the American corn dish. 

By the end of the kebabs we were extremely full to move on to the main course, so we took a break. Despite the long waiting queue outside and the rush, the waiters didn't complain about the time we were just sitting & chatting away.. A big plus!

The soup was nice, the items in the main course mediocre. However, the biriyani was good. 
The varieties of breads was good and oh, same goes for the complimentary drink. :D

Coming to the desert, the fruits were tasteless and only two were offered. 
The phirni was nice - specially the small pots in which they were served was uber cute!
How I wish they served brownies though- I've been dyyyying to have that!!!

And the best part was- when we left after paying the bill, the manager ran to us and returned the tip saying they don't accept it and it is already included in the bill. 
The hospitality is amazing, the food? Could've been better.

Visited the Kolkata outlet for the first time after visiting the Mumabi Outlet. As I entered I found the place little cramped Up when compared to Mumbai. The staff was quite couteous and friendly. The decor was like any other outlet. Coming to the main section for which we all wait "THE FOOD" . Starters was pretty nice as always I really wish they change their conventional Items which they have been serving for quite some time now and introduce some new variety. However few dishes which was new to me were crispy chilli paneer that was pretty nice and crispy babycorn which was just dry. The main course was nothing great . I however missed the veg hakka noodles which was always present in all the Mumbai Outlets. The chicken biryani was again not upto the mark as the chicken was dry. Coming to my fav part the deserts were mind boggling as always with angoori gulab jamuns and firni taking the entire experience to a different level. Overall a pleasant experience though I still wish they introduce new items so that we look forward to visit the place weekly/monthly so as not to repeat the dishes.

I had visited this awesome place for my husbands birthday. This was so far the best service I have experienced in any restaurant. Being a vegetarian, I did not expect much dishes in this place. But then I was wrong. In starters, 2 variants of potato (never knew potato tastes this good), a variant of corn, and then grilled potato, paneer, capsicum, pineapple, mushroom, chicken, prawns and mutton.  Followed by the soup, there was 2 types of rice, roti and 6 veg side dishes including dal, paneer, palak, cauli flower, potato and veg manchurian and similar non veg variety as well.. There were 7 dessert variants too...Adding to the ambience was live music. After serving each starter, we were asked if we were enjoying the food. Our suggestions for making some things spicy , crispy etc were done when served again ( Wow who would have expected that) ..When they came to know its my husbands birthday, the live music people sang birthday wishes, and they even brought us a cake with lighted candle for cake cutting. They took our photos and printed and gave it before we left...The tip we had given was returned telling there a no tip policy and it is included in the service tax.  We have heard of customer is our king motto almost like everywhere. but this was the first time I experienced it..Would recommend it for all..

I visited this place on Saturday with my wife. This is the sixth time I went to this restaurant. As everybody knows this place is renowned for their starters and way of presenting it. I liked it very much as they place a barbeque on table and serve starters on that. I must say all the starters were mouth watering except Paneer kebab. They served 5 Non-Veg starters (Chicken, Mutton, Fish & Prawn). Chicken Kebab is same as always but nice one. They don't have much variation on Non-veg starters. But I found Veg is quite interesting. Golden fried Sweet corn was most lived one by my wife. In Non-veg Fish was really nice. it had some ajwain flavour which makes flavour really awesome. Every time they serves same Mutton Sikh Kebab. I am very sorry to say they need to learn how to prepare Sikh kebab.

Coming to the Main course, Mutton Biriyani was good but Chicken gravy was too bad.

Desert was splendid. Angoori Gulab Jamun was yammi. They have improved their service a lot. Now people will keep on asking you how the taste of food, do you have some special request and so on.

We went for lunch. I had been fore warned about the multitude of starters and appetisers so was extremely wary of over eating!   The Cajun potatoes were definitely yummy even though  I almost waved it aside as it was just the humble root. The Punjabi tangri kebab and the Australian grilled chicken were both good, tender and flaking off the bone. The angoori fish kabab was a little too spicy for my taste; however, on mentioning this,the waiter very kindly got me a plate of specially made non-spicy ones. Very thoughtful service I have to say. The prawn kebaab was slightly disappointing as it was really shrimps but the taste made up for it.
The main course really was not too striking though it had a number of dishes to keep both the discerning and the non, satisfied!! Chicken biryani, chicken butter masala, laal maas, fish in mustard were the non-vegetarian dishes. Though the biryani was well cooked it was a little too oily for my taste. The lal Maaas was excellent and do not let the flaming colour frighten you! It is really not hot...the salads were good, there were cool cucumbers with dil, the standard pasta salad(very dull and boring) but the seafood salad made up for it with its mustard bite. The brinjal salad was an unhealthy one and a misnomer too  because it was really fried brinjal topped with bits of onion and tomato.

The desserts were mixed. Vanilla ice-cream with a number of syrups laid neatly alongside...chocolate, mango and orange, then grape-sized gulab jamuns, small pots of phirni, lemon tart which was actually not one..it was a mini tart shell filled with yellow butter cream, a dry walnut cake which had a bit of raabri drizzled on it were on offer.

Hola foodies

Had an amazing eve with friends.

The idea of buffet with a plethora of starters always fascinate me. The starters were a mixed bag. Some of the starters were insanely sizzling. Mutton Galoti was soooo spicy that  I am sure to give me a hard time tomorrow morning. Fish Kababs were just perfect. Also liked the chicken tangri and aloo tikkis. Garlic bread was the best I ever had. 

The main course never attract me, however, I didn't want to repeat the mistake I made at Flame n Grill. I had to taste the Biriyani. Simply loved it, specially it  being on the spicier side with added pepper.

The desert menu shuffles. No one will ever see the same combination of deserts on next visit. Yet, the desert menu on my visit was hopeless. The Firni was notable, it was better than the one served at Arsalan, alas it was too small. I spent the first matka realizing the taste, the second one admiring and the last one to love it. I also liked the fruit salad with cream setting and caramel topping. The ice cream menu was restricted to vanilla only, however the gulab jamun topping tasted good.

The overall fooding experience was better than just good.

The deco was something new. We often come across posters from silver-screen world hung on the walls of restros. Here the potraying of fancy characters from popular children movies was lively (specially that of Ct Jack Sparrow). The overall setting was brilliant with comfortable seatings and shiny table tops.

The hospitality was adorable. The Chef himself came to pay us a visit. Amidst our cacophonious discussions, they never showed any signs of concern and kept their spirit high.

The only of concern was the live band playing at the background. Amagine Pankaj Udhas singing Hotel California. It was tooo drab and hard for the ears.  

Anyways the overall experience was great and I strongly recommenr Barbeque Nation to the non-veg foodies.

In school I remember our English teacher teaching us the difference between a connoisseur and a glutton. I am pretty sure she didn't pay Barbecue Nation a visit!!! 
My friends and I opted for the non veg unlimited buffet on a monday night and I must say my English teacher was proved wrong! You can be both a connoisseur and a glutton at this gem of a place! 
For the starters we were served jeera machhi, two types of chicken, one mutton, one prawn and the tengri kebab all equally good but the jeera machi and the prawn really stole the show! We also had cajun potato ( never knew our humble potato was so tasty!), a mexican veg grill, paneer grilled and grilled mushrooms. They were so so good that we were at the kebabs for an hour!
We followed the starters with soup. We had a sea food lemongrass soup which I found refreshing but my friend disagreed so I guess it is something of a personal taste.
For the mains we had mutton biryani, fish in mustard, mutton dakbanglow ( my pick among the mains) etcetra etcetra...(the variety of dishes was too astonishing to be fit in this humble review).
Dessert was a fitting end to an impeccable meal. We had phirni, sheer korma, nut pie, icecream, orange pastry, fresh fruits and gulab jamuns! WoW! Really couldn't find fault with a single of them! 
The service is the best I have seen in a restaurant! Your plate will never remain empty that is a guarantee, they are that fast! You will be politely asked about the food every 20mins or so by the manager whether you are enjoying your food or if you need anything.
The decor is pleasant with live music. The seating is plush and luxurious.
If you haven't been to this place yet you are missing out! 
This is my first 5 rating on Zomato. They are worth it. Period.
P.S. Book well in advance as this place is always full! If you call on a monday you can book tables for wednesday!

My husband and I are very impressed with this restaurant. We haven't had so many scrumptious food laid out in front of us in Kolkata before. The service is top notch and the ambience is classy. We were so happy we wanted to tip them handsomely and surprisingly they firmly refused the tip twice(inside the restaurant and at the valet). Wow, right? We specifically enjoyed the never-ending flow of appetizers. Definitely the best buffet in Kolkata!

I visited BBQ Nation last week after quite some time(I had stopped going thr in the middle since I found the food same n repetitive). But I have mention that the restaurant service n food quality has improved buy leaps n bounds now.
First of all they have introduced many new starters for both veg n nonveg... and the food was yummy. Then the soup in the main course... It was a chicken Mexican soup n was of lip smacking goodness. So was the biriyani...mutton...n even some of the unique veg side dishes.
The desserts were wow as usual... Cheese cake... Pastries... Custard. Special mention for the chocolate tarts which were too good.
I must also mention the service which had improved quite a lot with multiple waiters attending your table and the manager and chef cooking down asking for feedbacks!
Very satisfied with my visit... N would love to visit soon!

We went to Barbeque Nation to celebrate our friends' marriage and we asked for some help in decorating a cake we had brought with their names.
What they did was much more than we expected, they gave us not only our cake but another cake which was an amazing touch. The waiters even took a lot of our photos and instantly brought across a card with a photo of the couple and us with a message which again was very touching.

The food was top notch and so was the service, I can't complain about anything except the fact that I couldn't eat dinner because I ate so much for lunch. This was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to come back again.

Excellent service, great barbeque - love the ambience.¬†

The trick at BBQ Nation is to enjoy the grill as much as you can. The non vegetarian grill is superlative.¬†

Main course is just about alright and the dessert too is nothing to gush about. 

Overall great place to have a laid back meal and total value for money !

Let me start by saying that if you haven't visited this place already, do so SOON!!!

A delight for kebab lovers, Barbeque Nation deserves the INSANE rating for its excellent customer service, wide range of veg and non-veg options and last but not the least, most of the items in the buffet taste awesome.

To be on the safe side, reserve your table previously as it gets filled quickly. Also, as it is a buffet, you need to wait for at least 1 n a half hours before getting your table. 

On taking our seat, the manager asked for our choice of complimentary drink. The options are: fresh lime soda, cold drinks and beer pint. (These are the ones i can remember presently). You will get 1 of these drinks once for free. My friend chose Sprite while i chose fresh lime soda.

Soon after, they placed a barbeque grill at our table and started serving the kebabs in the grill. This personal grill gives one the option of customizing the kebabs according to ones taste of spices. We chose non-veg, so we could enjoy both veg as well as non-veg items. Along with the kebabs, sweet corn, mutton seekh kebab and chicken leg pieces were served(i forgot the name) along with some other items. 

After serving all the various kebabs , they came and asked us which ones we liked and also asked us for our suggestions. At the same time, they keep on serving the starters until you put the flag down at your table. You won't have to ask them to serve, they do it before you ask. So good is their customer service. 

Out of all the kebabs, i liked the mushroom kebab and kasturi prawn kebab the most. I also liked the chicken leg pieces as they were soft and and the right ingredients in the perfect amount. Haven't tasted anything better previously, these were so good. 

I was completely filled by the starters. So, i decided to skip the main course and go to the desserts part. My suggestion is: Please don't miss the deserts. Butter scotch pastry is so soft that it melts in your mouth. Angoori gulab jamun was another awesome item. Really likes it. Also the phirnee, served in small earthen pots, taste very good. To end it all, there was ice cream.

Previously i had asked the manager if he could arrange a small cake for it was our anniversary that day. So, before checking out, he not only brought us a complimentary cake specially prepared for us but also clicked a photograph. He then got it printed and gave it to us in a beautiful paper photo frame for the memories to last forever. And all this within a couple of minutes. This was a beautiful gesture shown and really made us feel special. I would like to visit this place again n again for its excellent customer service.

For those asking about the cost, a non-veg lunch buffet on a weekday cost us 1190 INR for 2 people. Also, the waiters here return the tips given as service tax is already included in the bill. Didn't see this gesture anywhere else yet.

Am visiting this place again soon and i would like to refer it to all foodies out here. Simply the best, at this price range.

Unlimited buffet, but staff willing to customize the items to your taste. Where else would you find this? Portions are ample, staff friendly and helpful and variety of options both in veg and non-veg,  specially the latter. Went for lunch on a weekday afternoon and was lucky enough to find a place in this joint bang in the middle of Kolkata's tech-city, since it's mostly filled to capacity. Kebabs comprised chicken, fish, mutton & prawns with very prompt and warm service, continuously enquiring about any modifications necessary and egging on for repeats.
Main course was standard with mutton being softer than anticipated. Desserts were good too with a complimentary beer or soft drinks. The tab for two was cINR1400,  all inclusive.

UNLIMITED KEBABS!!!!! now thats what i am talking about... when the concept first came to kolkata i was very sceptical of the whole thing cause i thought they would not be able to live up to the quality and with the no. of mouths they need to feed it would not be possible at all... 

BUT Boy!!! was i surprised.... i being a vegetarian had more than enough options to eat from and the food was just great!!!!

the taste was spot on even though some of the dishes served in the start were not authentic kebabs but i can live with it cause they were very good to eat... the roasting part is great fun and the people serving there make sure that your roast is always full and they get you exactly what you want...

the main course form the buffet is above average as well... though i dont why they do not keep Dal Makhani or a kali dal which will go superbly with the food... 

i have visited this place quite some times and will continue to do so as the food is just great!!!!

an advise... do not miss the biryani here... for a buffet it tastes quite good... and the paneer kebab is a  must which you will keep re ordering.

Been to this joint too many times to really keep a count. Located in the heart of sector 5, the business and IT hub of Calcutta, it's location is enviable! The standard of food as always is maintained at a decent place. This review is not about a particular visit but a consolidated review of all the times I have visited for various reasons-business, personal, with family or friends. 

The starters in this place are a notch above the rest and it really IS the barbecue nation. The barbecue being cooked on the table top with a smattering of sauces and rub downs of your choice is a novel experience. Generally I find their mutton sheekh kebabs to be the best of the lost. The chicken reshmi or diced variety which they might serve on any particular day comes a close second. The prawns, fish and mushrooms vie for a close third. The kebab I least like is the chicken legs cooked in any particular style as the meat remains chewy in the middle and not as delicious/moist as I would expect a chicken leg to be.

The main course is nothing to write home about. The usual vast spread of biryanis, a fish item, a mutton and chicken items, some veggies, a dal and rotis to accompany, salads of various kinds (green as well as the more fancier varieties) and papad. I more or less prefer to have the least amount of food from this spread, opting to go for a little bit of the biryani and whichever non-veg item catches my fancy on any given day!

And then straight onto the dessert, which is a sweet tooth's heaven. I love the variety of delicacies they have and the taste lives up-to the beauty of the dishes. The firni deserves a special mention as do the delicate little cakes which are made of different fruit flavorings. 

The specialty to me of this chain, is the concept of the flags. Unlimited kebabs get refilled on the stove placed in front of you on the table till such time you raise the flag to surrender.. How awesome is that? 

Ambiance is great to go with larger groups of family, friends or even friendly colleagues! Overall, a nice place to go to from time to time. But since the menus are fixed and rarely change, the frequency of visits will have to peter out eventually!!

Unlimited Kababs on the skewers ! 
BBQ Nation was the first joint in Kolkata to introduce this concept and boy was it a hit ! 
The kebabs was served on an oven right on your table. There are two modes always - an option without the prawns and a slightly costlier option with mainly the prawns. Suggest you go for the latter. All the kebabs are pre-cooked and served right in front of you to create the ovenish feeling. You get a variety of chicken , fish, prawn, mutton, paneer and other vegetarian kebabs. 
The kebabs run till you say 'enough' and they request you to proceed towards the buffet. Needless to say, there should never be any space left to relish the buffet. However, if you do, you must know that the buffet is great as well. 

Worth mentioning is their dessert spread which accomplishes the task of entertaining your stomach to the fullest. You are guaranteed to come out with a smiling face from this restaurant.

If you are a kebab lover, this is the place to be! Though FnG has a similar set up, but I would rate them higher. 

The ony reason I am unable to visit them quite often, is that they are only in Salt Lake Sector V. I would ask them to open a branch in south kolkata.

They mode/style of service is simple. There is only one way: They serve all food unlimited , till you raise the flag & surrender. 
The starters, on the live barbeque at your table has an array of kebabs coming in.

 Mostly, people dont make it to the buffet table. Suggest do that right at the start - you will find lots of accompaniments for the kebabs being served. Also, the dessert table is very interesting and surely you need to set some space aside for that.

Hope to see them soon in south kolkata. and not doing just luncheon business @ sector V.

Recently had a go on this one!! And my god! What an amazing experience it was!!! Food was superb!!! Especially the sea-food! Basa fish was sooo damn good! Every foodie should visit this place.. Awesome food, awesome ambiance and to top of it amazing service. 

Starting from the starters. They have all sorts of good things! You won't even believe how good a smoked and grilled the pineapple tasted!! It was sooo delicious!! Trust me! And then the mushroom!! Grilled juicy mushrooms. Loved it. Paneer was super soft and ultra delicious and the aloo tikka was also a treat to your tongues. Now coming to the non-veg part. As you'll all expect it to be; it's more than that! Soft chicken, ultra soft Basa fish especially imported from Vietnam and Awesome prawns will take you to the next level of Grilled Meats. Even the mutton Sheekh kebabs were fantastic too. Chicken tandoori(Legs) were also awesome and despite of being grilled the juiciness and the softness of the legs were still intact!!! It didn't loose the moistness at all!!! This was really A WOW!!! Maybe I'm missing a few things. But these were all that I could gather right now!

Now coming to the Main Course. Honestly I didn't have much place left in my stomach for the main course(After having gobbled up a lot of starters); yet I tried their Dum Biriyani; which was really good! And the mutton was also soft and spicy Indiana style. The salads were awesome too! And there were plenty menus for the veg too.

Now the desserts! You can't miss the Gulabjamuns and the Firni! God they were sooo good!! Trust me! There were others too. Like Vanilla Ice Cream with a few choice of sauces on them! And the rasgullas, Cheese Cakes and Custards were there too.

Now lastly, I visited this place On the V-Day! And there were a few things extra for the Couples. Like they stalled there a live counter, where two special preparations were served! And they even gave us a complementary Heart-Shaped Vanilla-Strawberry Cheese-Cake! And we loved each and every part of it! Not to forget the live music was there too!!!

So i recommend this place as a must go Restaurant for the food lovers out there!! You won't regret!!

I had an awesome experience , when I visited with my wife & daughter. It was my anniversary  & boy it turned out to be one of the best , if not the best dining experiences I ever had. The best part was the Service. That's what we call - " DELIGHTER" in customer service. It was also the last day of the Persian festival so the buffet theme was based on Persian flavours. But the food was good.  We tried all the grilled starters. The live grill was really enjoyed by my daughter. Also we liked the Aab Ghosht & Konkan fish curry . Then the desserts  - Phirni , Aangori Gulab jamun, Cheese Cake etc. Everything was really good.
But the best part was towards the end. When we had finished , the waiter brought us a Anniversary Cake.
It did'nt finish there. Then he clicked a photo of us & before we finished the cake, the colored print of the same in a nice frame was given to us as a token of gift.  Barbeque Nation rocks !!!!

Barbeque Nation- a NATION apart. If they try to claim sovereignty, it won't be hard for them to find citizens. This is one of the very few restaurants where people go for starters all the time. As a matter of fact, their starters are probably more famous than the main course.

I have been wishing to go to this particular place for a long time and at last I got the chance today. I visited the place with my family. We had a reservation at 2:30 PM. We got there early and fortunately got a seat quick.

The ambiance was nice. As soon as we were settled, the "Barbeque" began. And thus began an epic food journey. The kebabs were great, of course. Special mention goes to prawn and fish kebabs. They were simply awesome. Although personally I think they could have done a better job at removing the tails of the prawn. The Rosemary Chicken Kebabs and Mutton Seekh Kebabs were equally great- Tender, soft and juicy. But the prawn and fish kebabs really stood apart.

The kebabs were really well-cooked and the best thing is I can easily monitor how well cooked they are before eating. I like kebabs with a pinch of lemon juice and salt and adding them before the kebabs are taken off the grill really increases their taste manyfold. Barbeque Nation gave me that chance by placing the grill right at the center of our table.

The Chicken Tengri Kebab was a bit of a disappointment. It tasted great. But as soon as I got to the bone, I noticed spots of blood that shows the pieces were not cleaned thoroughly. It is not quite what one expects from a restaurant of such scale. I did not have the courage for anymore Tengri Kebabs after that. This is the reason why I would not rate it a 4.5.

Apart from that, the starter course was simply fabulous for a Kebab lover like me. This is why I went there in the first place and got more than I hoped for.

After the kebabs, we decided to try the main course. First I tried the Dum Biriyani which I did not like much. I prefer biriyani with a light flavoring. So next I went for the Kabuli Biriyani. This was what I was looking for- right spices at correct amounts. The only setback in this particular dish were the chanas. It could have been far better without them. All the other main course dishes I tried were good.

As for the desert, the Ice Cream and the Firni closed the deal well while the sweets and the cake were nice flavoring on what was an wonderful meal.

Another special mention is deserved by the Staff there. Everyone was warm and their service was great too.

Really enjoyed my visit there except for the Tengri Kebab incident.

Would suggest this outlet to shut shop . I hope the owner looks into this review . I dont know why but neither the landline nor the mobile number given was picked up   . what the hell . was calling up to book for a gathering . This unprofessional behavior has left such a scar that before even the marriage had to happen its a divorce . Sorry cant patronize such outlets . there are good ones in salt lake lije Abcos , Stadel , 6 Ballygunge Place , azad hind , which are extremely good and have the courtesy to receive guest calls.

BY FAR THE BEST LUNCH BUFFET IN KOLKATA. I VISITED THE PLACE YESTERDAY ALONG WITH MY WIFE ON THE 4TH ANNIVERSARY WE COMPLETED. WE ENJOYED THE PERSIAN FESTIVAL GOING ON & RELISHED A SUPERB MEAL.  They have 4-5 sets of fixed menus which are used on different days ,  we got rosemary chicken kabab, kabab-e-barh,chilli tangri kabab,spicy prawn kababs. THE AMBIENCE, FOOD QUALITY, SMILING FACES OF THE STAFFS WERE AS USUAL LIKE ALL OTHER TIMES. SPECIALLY SHANKHO IS MY FAVOURITE, BUT OTHERS ARE WELL MANERRED, COURTEOUS AS WELL.AT PRESENT I CAN'N THINK OF GOING TO ANY OTHER PLACE IN KOLKATA OTHER THAN BBN.GOOD LUCK TO THE BBN MANAGEMENT FOR THEIR NEW GUWAHATI OUTLET, ALTHOUGH I KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO SUCCEED WHEREVER  THEY GO. THANK U ALL FOR UR SERVICE & LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKE A VISIT IN FEB 2014 AGAIN.

This is by far the best Buffet restaurant in kolkata, it was in my wishlist for long time but didnot find any special occasion to go there but finally managed to go there.. prior Table booking over phone is absolutely mandatory otherwise one has to wait for hours to get in as minimum 2 hour is required to finish the meal so table turnover time is very long, its wise to book table even in week days also.. we had booking at 12.30 pm and when we entered it was almost totally filled up with guests , after getting table the portable charcoal grill arrived and waiter asked for what type of drink we want, we decided to have lime soda, beer was also available i think..They have 4-5 sets of fixed menus which are used on different days , today we got rosemary chicken kabab, kabab-e-barh,chilli tangri kabab,spicy prawn kababs, grilled basa, falafel,cajun potatos,shish paneer in the grill and for main course there were lentil soup, salads, rice, chicken biriyani,dal,mix veg, achari paneer,mix saag,alu anardana,murg khurchan, aab ghost,nellore fish curry and for dessert there were fruit cream, cheese cake,brownie, cocoanut narang, apple pie, phirnee, gulab jamun, vanilla ice cream and fruits..Though all the items were good but the best was the kababs and we saw that most of the people are eating mainly kababs and from there straight going to dessert, skipping the main course but this type of thing i dont like as everyone should try every item to have a taste of that.. Mineral water and soft drinks are included in the buffet price.. Ambiance is grand, service is impeccable, foods are delicious and price is also within limits of everybody..Tipping is not allowed as service charge in included in the price.. one will have his/her best gourmet experience here at Barbeque nation, its a must visit place for everybody..

This was my sixth visit to this place. I have been here with my family, my wife, my friends. Everytime my verdict has been same..... Just Brilliant...... The range of starters you get is just unbelievable. Both veg & non-veg starters are equally excellent. Special mention for Barbeque Gobi, sweet corn roasts, sweet potato roasts, chicken tengri kabab, iranian roasted murg amongst others. The service is also best in the class. They will continue serving you in grills & in plate till you say no. And all of these with a smile... always. Sometimes they will even surprise you with items out of menu, like they did us with Shark kebab!!
After you gobbled up all the starters, you'll go for the grand buffet. The widespread choice of soup, salads, biriyanis and both veg & nonveg items are excellent. Special mention for the Methi Gosht....never had such a beautiful mutton preparation anywhere else.
After all these, when your stomach is overflowing with food, you'll understand the wide choice of desserts are still left. Don't miss them....at any cost. My advice- have very little main course, and keep space in your stomach for the desserts. The platter of hot gulab jamun is just brilliant. 
The price has gone up with time, but their service & quality has not deterred. They are also the only I've been where the waiters return their tips happily, as it's already included in the bill. 
Overall you'll come out after a sumptuous meal with a big smile in your face & a belly full of barbeques......

this restaurant has something different,something very good which keeps it over any other food joints and that is the service.never try to tip them because they dont encourage tipping,however they say tips are included in the bill.
regarding the food. 
starters-these were extremely good,the tangri kebab,fish steak,prawns,chicken and mutton.
maincourse-we didn't even care to taste them,though they must be good.
desserts-they were very good
p.s tell them the occasion,if its a b'day party or an anniversary.they try to make it special and take care of your health while starting with desserts.

Awesome place for barbecue lovers. I visited the place during the pujas last year. I couldn't even pass through the starters being a guy who can eat a truck load. Only if the kebabs and tikkas were more moist! The main course was great too, though couldn't have much of it. The ambience was just great. It was a great touch that the Chief Chef himself attended each table to know if the food was alright and how the guests would rate it. The waiters were cordial, humble and they even clicked my picture for me as I went alone. The only drawback I could find was the high price. ‚Çπ989 with taxes seems very steep for whats on offer. And one more thing is the buffet only system as you really have to have a big apetite too fully utilize the money spent.

Always wanted to go to this place..and finaly we went there last week for our staff party..Non vegetarians Had enjoyed the food..but me Being a vegetarian was little disappointed..watever starters came on our table were cold and the coal in the Grill was not hot too..even after heating for 15 mins on the Grill It Was cold only..
I kept asking for paneer starters but They arrived only after half an hour..They Were cold without Much of marination..Wen i complained to the Manager, he thereafter tried his best to satisfy us with some other dishes which were off the Men√º like paneer chilli and dahi kebab which i wud Say were Really good..but the point is going to barbeque Nation means enjoying the Grill items which unfortunately were a let down..
What saved the day for me was their main course (can u imagine..Most people dont go there only and skip it)..the malai kofta Was very good..dal makhni Was good too..
Desserts Were average..Nothing great..
Good thing is the waiters and Managers Are very polite..
Overall an average experience..

This place makes eating out a delightful experience, not only because of the food, but also because of the service.
We had gone there with a 1 year old baby, and they gave special attention to our needs and comforts. The waiters were very courteous and polite. The service was prompt and effective.
The food was excellent with all the different grill choices, and the buffet spread was very tasty, with each dish having its own distinctive flavor. 
Will definitely visit again.

well....I visit this place again and again...visited in Dec last and was disappointed because we had to sit without being served anything.....all the other tables were getting food but our table......blah!!!!!!! Being their Mushroom Kebab fan...i was very disappointed their taste has gone down....God knows why!!!!! Apart from that we had a cinnamon banana kebab which was the most bad in taste...their mustard fish tandoori had too much of Mustard in it...their mutton seekh kebab was ok...though the Mutton paya soup was good...their apple strudel was a bit soggy....and coconut flank was very chewy......cant say about the main courses cause I usually prefer Kebabs and then dessert....
And yes.............their pasta was super bland........
Please increase the taste.....

----- 15 Mar, 2013 -----

its just awesome....whenever i think of "kababs" barbeque nation comes to mind.......have been here more than 15 times. if one is fan of mushrooms one should check out here.....simply delicious whether its der mushroom or paneer or the potato,chicken,fish,prawn..special mention for their prawns because their quality and size of their prawns are really very good as compared to other buffets....their main courses are also good.but i always look forwards for their "desserts" with angoori gulab jamun,fruit custards,phirnee etc all so yummy and delicious
as compared to other buffets in other restaurants...still prefer this place only.......only 1 complain..the menu is more or less same every time......please try to change it.....

Best buffet in town. My favourite because of the awsome starters and mouth watering desserts. I never have place  enough in my stomach to eat the main course. Another good thing is the complimentary beer they serve. Staff is courteous and service is promt. What adds to the experience is the personalized service they provide,  like the chef roaming around asking about food. I feel bbq nation should open more outlets in  kolkata.

Excellent Kebabs and unlimited - that can be the only reason I never feel tired to visit this place. 
The main course selection is also wide, but I never get much chance to explore it, thanks to the Kebabs. :)
The dessert is also great. Overall a very nice experience.
The staffs are very courteous, they even returned the tip that we happily provided, saying it is against their policy to accept tips from customers! 
Apart from that, this place is very famous, and is always crowded on a weekend specially. So be prepared to wait a little bit after adding your name in the wait-list after reaching there.
Good job BBNation - keep it up!

Worth the money for any foodie.. Especially the non- veggies. The starters are mind-blowing and you wouldn't mind jumping straight to the desserts.. Even though the mutton biryani and non veg mutton curry is worth a try if you have any space left. The chef is good and they do take special care to suit your taste in case you don't like any dish. Try the cocktails here and its pretty reasonable compared to salt lake city rates. The mojito is awesome :)

It hurts me to write this review but went there a week and a half back and had very bad experience. This is one of my all time favorite places and one of the major reasons we preferred it to places like flame and grill is that they give equal importance to veg options as well. But this time was a sheer disappointment. Waited for over  20 min after the first round of starters and had to ask them over and over again ... 

The my horror the veg tandoori skewer had GUAVA, BANANA, And Pineapples ..... HORRID ! and they seemed to be quite ok with serving tandoori FRUITS !  they golden corn was hideously oily and everything had whole jeera in it. The stewards were newbies probably hired for the new year/ Christmas season and were rude. On creating a fuss... the chef came and said ... that he was going to help but already 1.5 hours had passed and he had eaten what ever garbage was served... On yelling they made a fresh lot of started and then started giving us complimentary desserts... These people should understand that the benchmarks they set once should be maintained. And bad service cannot be compensated with complimentary desserts and one cannot be pleased if u finally decide to give good food 1 and a half hours into service 

None of us touched the main course and were hugely disappointed in the service.


----- 11 Oct, 2012 -----

A fantastic eatery. 
The food is delicious and the service is awesome. The restaurant is very busy during weekends and I prefer going on weekdays. The choice of starters is wonderful. The kebabs are always juicy and succulent and also the vegetarian selection is good. 

What I like is the color coding of the skewers in red and green for veg n non veg.
The decor is nice and the crooners singing add to the old world Calcutta charm to the place.  

The main course spread is nice and their mutton preparations are usually brilliant . The last time I had a Fish Curry was yummy too. 
My mother was Wow-ed by them. She was very disappointed as she is a diabetic and could not eat dessert. The chef on hearing this got her a sugar free custard with fresh fruits in a matter of 10 mins. 

On my last visit also they made a special mixed Veg Stir Fry for us. 
A very pleasant place to go to. Love going back.

This place has never disappointed me on terms of taste,ambiance and service.Mouthwatering grilled starters(unlimited) and excellent buffet spread,this place has always provided a value for Money.I have been there  6 times with my husband and never have they disappointed us.

This is the reason why we always give it our top preference during festivals or celebrations.
The chef comes to each table and asks personally about the food quality and this gives you a personal touch.Not only does he asks ,but also replaces anything you want them to improve and presents a fresh plate to taste.

Thank you Bbq nation !! Love you! :)

Barbeque Nation has its standards. It has never disappointed me with its spread of salads, delicious starters and fantastic main course(which most people miss because of the unlimited barrage of starters that keep coming their way once they settle down at a table :) 

My umpteenth meal in this fantastic eatery was last night. However, this time, the expectations were not fulfilled to such a perfect level. Starters could boast of only good prawns and chicken legs. Grilled fish and grilled chicken were both smelling of mustard and the jingle bell fish served during the Brazilian festival did not satisfy my palette. The roasted corn, of course, was something that a even hard core non-vegetarian like me also enjoyed.

Dessert was good with its traditional spread, although the rum balls were a Christmas addition. However, since they have raised their tariff by a huge margin, it was expected that better rum than McDowell's Celebration would be used. 

All in all, I had a good time last night but my extremely pleasant experience of the earlier times were much better. It was just because of last night's  performance that the marker stops at 4.0

ok, first things first if you are going here PATIENCE is something you'll need. this restaurant is buzzing at all times when it is open....the moment you enter there is this hubbub of activity all around you. there is a clink of plates and forks accompanied by that beautiful aromatic smell of burned meat....my advice is you might have to wait in line so be prepared.
next, the service is excellent 5/5 on that. the waiters are really nice and keep an eye open for empty plates. as soon as your grill is empty in comes two more sticks of grill fish or meat. the grills are reaaalllyyy good, a MUST TRY: the yezo fish. it just melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting for more....the prawn and the other items are okkayish. I was disappointed by the taste of the mutton till sheekh kebab....my experience at another grill restaurant made me eager to have a taste of this particular meat here but i was immensely dissappointed. i liked the fact that there are complimentary drinks, soft drinks as well as hard drinks but a never ending supply would have been better!! 
the buffet is quite good, in terms of variety that is....i first got confused and went to veg side but i have to say the veg dishes are better. the veg biryani is excellent when you compare it to the non veg mutton dum biriyani. The lal maas is quite good but the methi murg is better. There is an attempt of Innovation in terms of the salad but the sea food salad is a failed attempt is must say, the dressing does not match the delicate taste of the sea food. The BEST item on the menu was the chicken soup. being a big fan of soups I relished every spoon of it!! The deserts are again a BIG PLUS point and will leave you craving for more.....the mini size of the gulab jamuns make it easier to eat multiple number of them. 
over all experience, was quite good, i really luved it, the palce lives upto its name and the ambience does not intimidate you like other posh restaurants do.......its a full paisa wasool place and you would definitely want to go back especially for the grills!!!!!

This place has never let me down, ever (period).

Located in sector V, the it hub of Kolkata. The place is famous for scrumptious starters served over live charcoal grill on your table.

The pro for this place is food and service. The starters served has varieties with options like fish, chicken, prawn and complimentary drink (you can choose a beer, lemonade or softdrink) The staff also brings kebabs and veg items too even if you have opted for non-veg buffet. During weekend they also serve delicacies like Shark (yes, I am talking about the real stuff), crabs and varieties of fishes.

The main course is has spread of Indian curries and mouth watering biryani, I must say it tasted better than some places which are well known for biryanis. Salads and pasta are also available.

Then comes excellent spread of yummylicious desserts. Starts with hot gulab jamuns to mud cakes, caramel custard, fruit pies, fresh fruits and the list goes on.

The staff is excellent and takes good care of the customers. The chef too visit the floor once in a while to chat with customers. I remember once the fish they served was under seasoned and the chef went back and prepared spice crusted pomfret specially for me and personally came to serve it. I was overwhelmed with this gesture and the preparation was impeccable.

Only one regret is the spread and menu, it's the same since ages except the once in a while specials like the Shark tikka (it was yummy) and the pomfret.

Hello there,

Visited the barbeque nation of Calcutta after half a year almost. 
My last visit was few months when I'd come with a very dear friend of mine when we were in town and two of her friends. 
What can I say, you guys never fail to meet my expectations...
This time, frankly, you 'exceeded my expectations'.
I was there to celebrate my friend Prateek Dutta's birthday on 13th dec 2013 lunch 
Mr Nazrul was our server. You're an absolute delight bro. I asked him discreetly whether he could organize something for the birthday celebrations. Pat him on his back when you do your briefings prior to the next shift from me will you?
Not only did he get a cake, but also a photo greeting card which had our pic printed and ready within less than 5 mins.
Whoever came up with that idea, sheer brilliance!!!
A massive thanks to Mr Mrinal. Very helpful F&B captain too. He always was quite watchful and personally assured me he'll ensure the day is made special. 
Sankha. Brilliant host. He's got the most welcoming rasgulla smile. A great prerequisite for a host and he's effective too. Got us a table within 5 mins on a busy day and also retained the card when we accidentally forgot it and gave it to us when we came to get it back. 
The only issue, and I just say this as a constructive criticism, is that we ordered for two salted lime sodas and specifically mentioned it shouldn't be sweet. But two sweet lime sodas were served. The bar server was very apologetic and offered to get it changed right away. But it was ok, you guys are so awesome with the rest of the work that this seems but a minor glitch. (F.Y.I one free beer with your meal folks)
You guys do a fabulous job keep the buffet topped up and clean.lastly, the food production team for being the reason why I LOVE barbeque nation. Those starters are blow-the-roof-off-the-place amazing!!! The Irani chicken marinade was fab, the chili fish was nice and crispy, the dips as splendid as ever. Main course: loved the mutton biriyani, the mutton was just cooked to perfection, salad section was amazing, the dressings were nice. Desserts: loved the caramel pudding, chocolate gateaux and call me crazy, but you guys seem to read my mind with that hot gulab jamun induction top. Ice cream topped with hot gulab jamun is simple my customized favorite. 
Keep the good work up. Your restaurant has evolved to be a trendsetter classics in India. I wish you all the luck to ensure you sustain that position. 
I'll surely visit you soon.

Lastly, for all my friends reading this and contemplating visiting the restaurant. 
If you haven't been here already, what are you waiting for?

It was an awesome experience of having dinner at Barbeque Nation as they made our day by making our wedding anniversary so so special...First of all they arranged a sweet cake for us and took our photo all from their end, but I never never expected that they will be printing that photo and will be giving the same to us by pasting the photo in an anniversary card!!!! That was a real surprise and it made us very special... And among the other things everything was flawless ... Right from the quality of food, service offered by the staff, the live band, the kebabs, each and everything was awesome and surely deserves the highest rating...I will never forget my experience and will always prefer Barbeque Nation as my First choice...

The food is really excellent. It has three parts the starters, main course and the deserts. In starters they have option for live barbeque and you get to choose from a wide variety of options like 2 preparations of chicken, mutton, fish, prawn in non veg and paneer, potato , mushroom in veg.. In the main course you have both fish, chicken and mutton and rice preparations like biryani in non-veg and paneer, dal makhani in veg. Deserts have ice cream, choco truffles, cakes, gulab jamuns and cookies.

Of all the starter was truly awesome and the deserts was pretty good. The main course was ok. Overall it was a good experience. The restaurant has become pretty expensive since the last time I had dinner about 6 months ago, prices have almost doubled.

Whether it be ambience, service or food... This place is simply the best, IMO the best place to eat with a group of friends, have visited it more than 15 times and wouldn't mind going for another 15 (atleast) 

Dishes which get a special mention from my side : aloo cajun starter, chickhen leg piece, biryani with raita and phirni and among drinks, the watermelon and kiwi martini is a must try :)

Amazing FOOD!
Splendid AMBIENCE!
Super-fine SERVICE!

I have been to Barbeque Nation in other places but in Kolkata, it was my first visit there with a friend of mine and I loved it here as well! I must say that the food they serve is indeed mouth watering and every single dish tastes yumm! First of all, the   quantity of the starters is a lot for two people and after gorging on them for a few minutes, both me and my friend was tired and we werent sure if we could enjoy the main dishes or not! But being in Barbeque Nation, one would never like to miss even a single thing and although we were full, we tried the main course as well! 

Barbeque Nation is a bit pricey and one should avoid going there alone or with only one partner as one would feel that they paid much but ate little! Go there with a bunch or friends or take out your whole family for a dinner and you would enjoy being there! It is indeed one of my favourite eating out places and I will always be in love with the food they serve! Needless to say, the waiters were very cordial and were constantly in a smiling face which I really appreciated! 3 cheers to this place and I am planning to go there soon !

I have been to Barbeque Nation atleast 5 to 6 times, and this place has fascinated me every time. I have mostly been there to avail the early bird offer, that is, for lunch if you reach there by 12:30, you need to pay only 499/- thats it! Most likley that price has been hiked recently, but still its a good deal! Whenever there's a plan for Barbeque Nation, I skip breakfast and get into an eat-all-you-can mode. The starters are fantastic. Main course is average, but you dont need to reach till main course. Try to fulfill your apetite in the starters itself. There's a small flag in a small stand on every table. You need to bend that stand when your table is done with starters. Till the time the flag is up, they will keep serving.

Food as in starters was brilliant, both veg and non-veg starters. Buffet was average. The soup they served - corriander chicken soup with a hint of lemon was delightful. All in pretty good.

It was in my wishlist the moment I started working at Sector V. It has a great ambience...keeps on always adding fun to the atmosphere for people who dine in. It has all the colors of fun and comfort which will make you crib for it. And the biggest factor, the food, is simply great. The best of the lot, to me, is the mushroom items and the wanton soup. I simply loved it. They have almost always a complimentary treat for you which is pleasantly surprising..be it a memento.. a cake or a souvenir.

I would highly recommend you guys to have a sneak peak into the restaurant and please your appetite. Price will be summing around 600-700 per head if you deserve a lovely feeling full stomach.

Have a gala time. Cheers!

Well after so many positive reviews from friends and zomato, finally able to crave some time to visit the place and that too for an office party!! With high expectation we started with kebabs.. Tried both veg and non veg starters and each of them were delicious. Still among them Prawn and mashroom steal the crown in my opinion. Salads in maincourse were upto the mark. Biriyani and sides didnt get much space in the stomach full with starters. In dessert section also pastries, tarts, ice cream with three types of sauce and hot gulab jamuns relishes the taste bud!! 
With nice ambiance and service,  these mouthwatering varieties are really value for money. During happy hours i.e Monday- Thrsday till 12.30 only for Rs. 587/- (including tax). Really one can see me there any time soon.

One of the best buffet I have ever had. 
Starters are amazing. If you're a non vegetarian then this is the place for you. Even veg starters like cajuan smashed potato and tandoori panner was exotic and mouth watering.
My opinion dont go for main course.. or go for it but leave some space for desserts. :P 
Best main course was biriyani and goan crab curry. 
Last but not the least, DESSERTS. If youre a gulaab jamun fan.. you will go crazy. I can bet on that. 

Food: 9/10 (not 10/10 is because less chicken items in the main-course)
Ambiance: 10/10 
Service: Depends

This time I could not resist myself to give you guys a perfect 5/5. Recently went to the place when the pan India food festival was going on which was just awesome. They added more non-veg kebabs and a super line up of 3 course meal. The whole restaurant was themed as a station and the staffs were acting as koolies on platforms. That was quite creative and entertaining. After the dessert they even treated us with a complementary cake and celebrated my wife's birthday which was quite memorable to us.

They won my heart completely on my last visit and had a nice time there. I just mentioned them that the chicken kebab is missing something, surprisingly they came up with a plate of chicken kebab specially made for us to try which I think is a high level of quality and service as well as customer satisfaction. keep up the good work guys and thank you very much for the lovely surprises.

I was definitely impressed with some of their dishes(starters) but to conclude upon the main course & the desserts,I would simply say that it's not worth the money.In dessert you have only Vanilla ice cream,gulab jamun,firni & pudding.For main course their are breads that are not the best made & 1 paneer,1 dal makhni & 2 other vegetables that are average.
Bar-b-q nation dwells upon only profit making by making consumers consume low value items & not giving them their worth for their money.
Dessert combined would cost:- Rs 125
Gulab Jamun-10per pc
Firni-35per pc
Vanilla ice cream-40 per scoop
pudding-40 per slice.......
Main course is definitely not worth the rest Rs.525......It is overpriced But the consumer is ready 2 pay provided they get their money's worth.My money upon this restaurant wouldn't go down satisfactory.

This is Gluttons Paradise for a non veg person. The place looks a bit crowded, but that is the only flaw I can find. Awesome food. They specialize in starters (tandoors). Best Indian starters I've had till date. Go only when you are super hungry otherwise you won't be able to give justice to the food and the concept. If you are lucky you might get to hear the live music. The staff is very hospitable and they even try to personalize food as much as possible. Kudos! :)

It has been a long time since I had been here, almost a year I guess. I was in for a pleasant surprise; not only in terms of the food but also with the ambience! They have revamped the starters - the mutton liver dish was a star among the new items. Also there are nicely done fish and mushrooms items. The decor has been themed out along Indian Railway stations! You even have waiters dressed up as typical train vendors selling everything from chai to spiced cucumbers. Try out the tea and be pleasantly surprised that it is actually a pallette cleanser and not a cup of station tea! The main course remains decently good though few people actually try it out. The desserts are still fabulously mouth watering. Do make sure you save some apetite for them. The price has been bumped up, but the food and service both match up to it.

we had heard so much about this place, that we just couldn't avoid going there this time.One might ask as to why use the words like "couldn't help", and "avoid". Well, in my mind there is always (often proved baseless) apathy about these so called  restaurant chains which have a pan Indian/global presence and are not specialized in a particular segment.Sort of a "jack of all trades master of none" scenario.This was precisely the reason I had stayed away from barbeque nation so far.
However,this time, mostly based on the continuous no.1position it has maintained in zomato, we decided to give this place a shot.
Four of us, went there on a sunday. We were there by 11.55 am. 5 mins before the restaurant opens, so we were one of the firsts to be seated.The decors good.classy.as expected.but nothing extraordinary.
The thing we were eager for is the food.They began with the famed kebabs.There were 2 types of chicken kebab. 1 prawn kebab, 1 fish kebab, and mutton sheek kebab. each of them had different names, like chicken Mediterranean, and prawn blah blah...but who cared, each of them seemed pretty much indian to our taste buds, and delicious in their own ways.The supply was  unlimited and did not slag for a moment, unlike other buffet joints,where they tend to slow down on the prawn part, and bring skewer after skewer of chicken instead.The chef special kebab of that day was grilled fish in pineapple, which was just out of the world.chunky juicy discs of bhetki marinated in a light sweet and tangy sauce...umm.

I feel the quality of a restaurant is seen by the quality of its relatively unimportant dishes.These tend to get neglected while paying more attention to the mains.Here this was not the case.I was as delighted by the prawn kebabs as with the crispy corns served with the kebabs as an appetizer.They were mouth watering.

After countless skewers, we shifted our attention to the main course.there were 3-4 types of salad(veg and on veg), an array of dahibara and chaats, soups, mutton biryani, chicken, mutton rogan josh and another fish preparation. I cant even remember the veg mains as none of  us were in  a position to even try them, over full with kebabs.But as much as we could see, there were ample options for the vegetarians as well.Each of the dish was excellent especially the biryani.The rice was really flavourful and the mutton tender. We were sorry that we could not do justice to the main course.
In other indian buffet joints like flame and grill, which also served excellent kebabs, the main course is pretty neglected, and the tastes do not do justice to the fame.We were very happy to note that this was not the case here.

The dessert section had ice cream with different types of sauces, lemon tart, fresh fruits, firni, caramel custard and assorted pastries.I felt they could do better in this section quality wise, but overall it was decent.

another thing i must mention here is that the service is excellent.The waiter were very attentive to our needs, and were even insisting us to have more, just as if we were in a relative's place and not in a commercial place. The chef greeted each table warmly and asked repetitively if any improvement suggestions need to be made, and if we would like any of the kebabs to be more spicy or less spicy, then he would immediately do it.
Loved it!

Pros-
Good ambience..recently all india food festival is going on.so they decorated the place like a train travelling through famous places of india where their branches are located..even tha chayewala,jhalmuriwala, shosawala are present !!!
Excellent food..not to mention THE BEST
Heavenly service-service is too good..this one aspect draws me everytime to this place..they accept criticism, suggestn with great attention..even on next day of my visit I got a phone call from delhi head office.they asked me repeatedly whether I had any complaint, suggestns..they are just so delicate in behaviour....
Price-though steadily rising, still reasonable
Cons-

The only problem is with the deserts... There's so may to choose from! All of them mouthwatering.

Writing a new review for Barbeque Nation for foodies is like trying to introduce Sachin Tendulkar to cricket fans (yes I am caught in the farewell hype :) ) - every foodie has been there, most many times and some more than me and knows the restaurant like the back of their hands (though I am not sure how well we know the back of our hands).

So, instead of review from scratch, I will try to list the improvements I found in my yesterday's visit compared to the last visit some 6 months back.

1. The service has become more personalized. My daughter was having problems with the spicy starters and was hardly able to eat anything. The waiter noticed this without our pointing out and surprised us with 3 sheekhs of chicken and prawns without any spice on them - customer delight 1... and as always they still don't accept tips.

2. The food - they have managed to deal with the only complaint I used to have - the kebabs were much more tender and juicier this time and the prawns had not shrivelled up. The timeless tandoori chicken was great. The spread was ample as always and there was more varieties of food than you could have - the sign of a true blue buffet.

3. The experience factor - BBN seems to have taken a conscious effort to ensure that dining there becomes an experience. the place has been decked up with a railway theme for some on going food festival they are having. We had noticed that some of the waiters were dressed in the red uniform of railway porters. Suddenly in the middle of the soft crooning by the live singers, there was an announcement of train departure. As eyes turned, the "porter dressed" waiters had formed a train and was chugging around the restaurant. The music changed to Bollywood and the porters broke into a flash dance that lasted for 5 minutes ending with applause from the patrons. Next, when the singers took up my song request (I love doing this), they called out my daughter and took her up on the stage as they sang the song - my kiddo was of course pleased as punch. Towards the end, a waiter came to our table and requested for a picture on his cam. The bill came with the picture printed and framed. 

So we ended up not only with a sumptuous dinner but also some great memories to keep.

Barbeque Nation brings you the best of North Indian food in town along with its extremely praised ranges of kebabs. The restaurant is located in the famous location for serious office area that is Sector V, Salt Lake. Barbeque Nation is also have their outlets in various cities including Kolkata of course. There is no doubt about the excellence and professionality of the restaurant as they have been topping in Zomato's chart for quite some time so I went to Barbeque Nation today to give it a taste.

They have very good buffet options and maybe one of the best in Kolkata. Firstly you are given choices of welcome drinks from which you can choose on. Secondly you make a choice of starters and kebabs which are veg, non-veg, and mixed. Mixed can be a good option as I felt veg. kebabs and starters were very good. The staff at the restaurant made our stomachs heavy just be starters as they served us more than 10 varieties of kebabs and starters (prawn, chicken, fish, paneer tikka, Mexican veg, mushroom tikka, baby corn and more).

Going on to the main course, you have some finger licking North Indian food waiting for you. After looking at the food, you will want to have everything you could find right from salad. Talking about salad, the Chicken Salad was good. Others included a boneless (or soft bones) chicken dish, a mutton curry, fish curry, yellow dal, biryani of-course and much more. The Chicken Curry was delicious and even the Biryani was good to have. Also you can always ask for Indian breads such as naan and tandoori rootis.

Deserts section had usual stuff like Ice Cream (with choco-sauce), brownie, gulab jamun which were always hot and fresh, pastries and more.

Prices are mediocre but will not hurt you get to have marvelous food and the best services from Barbeque Nation.

Ambiance of the restaurant was very good with good dim lighting and pleasing surrounding. The size of the restaurant is large but a restaurant like Barbeque Nation will always have people waiting outside for tables. The staff and waiters were very polite and will keep you asking if you want anything or how was the food. They will also keep a check on your glass of water and will fill it to the brim as soon as it comes near to empty. They are also very honest as they will not accept tips even if you insist them to have, as it is not allowed by the management.

To sum up, I would like to say that this restaurant is the best place for a Sunday lunch, dinner or should be visited on festive occasions (if you are lucky to get a table). However I am quite sure that corporates of Sector V can come here come here any weekday and can enjoy the food on a less crowd day. Also this restaurant is a must visit for all non-veg and kebab lovers. If you haven't visited, you are missing out.

It is one of the best restaurant in kolkata and is at no 1 position in top trending restaurants in kolkata for a really long time .So I decided to pay them a visit with my family and we reached there at 2:00 PM .When we entered the building, we saw so many people eating there like it was first time they had eaten.
Starters depends on your choice whether you want veg,non veg or both . We had taken both veg and non veg which included delicious mouth watering kebabs of fish,chicken,prawns,mushroom and paneer .We were also served sheekh kebab and a veg salad . The quantity of starters was so much that i was feeling my belly is filled ,so i drank their complimentary drink which was sweet lime soda that helped to gulp down the food so that it had more capacity in my belly to eat their main course.
Now the main courses were very delicious which ones i had eaten like mutton biriyani , every type of salads like sea food salad,veg salad ,non veg salad etc( which was the first time i had seen) and tarkadars chicken and mutton items.After eating all this smashing dishes i knew i had to eat desserts as everything in the restaurant was cooked to perfection.
So the desserts included ice cream with any flavor you would like so i poured chocolate fudge all over my ice cream and there were phirnis which was excellent.There was also chocolate mud pie , gulab jamun ,fresh fruits and caramel custard which was delicious.
They have very good service ,outstanding quality and quantity of food ,reasonable prices and large seating arrangement which is why i gave them a 5/5 because they deserved it.

This restaurant has held on to the numero-uno position on Zomato for ages now.Thus i was itching to pay a visit for  a long time.At last managed to do justice on a weekday lunch with an old friend.Reached the place at around 1:00 PM only to find people waiting outside.Was quite taken aback. We were finally offered a table after a waiting time of 20 minutes.
Once inside we noticed a "food factory" in operation and some serious big eaters.I mean Bongs were always known to be big eaters but this was serious hogging :) 
And now coming on to the buffet spread. I was shocked!!! Reason? After having tasted buffet spreads across all major cities in India, i always knew buffet comprised of a large variety of dishes, but believe me the spread over here was huge to say the least.
The starters comprised of kebabs of all possible variants-prawn, fish,mutton,chicken,paneer, mixed veg,mushroom ,baby corn.The good part was the size of the portions on the skewers was optimal to reduce wastage.Kudos to the management on this aspect.As far as the taste was concerned - mutton sheekh kebab, chilly fish,murgh makhmali kebab stood out.Rest was passable, nothing great.
They also served us a complimentary pint of beer which was the icing on the cake.They do serve a range of nice cocktails-not a part of the buffet though and has to be ordered separately.We had the vodka based caprioska  and it was well made.

Now the main course was also vast just like the starters.I was almost full, thus tasted a small helping of a  couple of items. Mutton biriyani, murgh curry, mutton gravy,fish curry,pulao,yellow dal, mixed veg tawa fry,veg kofta curry,potol(parval) kosha , range of salads.What impressed me most was the mixed veg tawa fry, the humble potol kosha and the mutton biriyani. Rest of the items were decent, not outstanding though.They serve the bread items on the table on order.No option of roomali roti was a let down .
Amongst the desserts tried the phirni-excellent, caramel custard-yummy and the hot gulab jamuns- very good. The spread also had cut fruits,pastries, ice cream brownie.
On the flip side we found out that the waiters do tend to serve the kebab skewers hurriedly on the table and other starter items in a pretty rushed up manner.Thus one finds ones plate already full just when one has started out his meal.Probably the adrenalin rush during a full house is the culprit.
To sum it up, excellent variety of items, vast spread- excessive in my opinion, polite and very courteous staff , prompt and efficient service at a competitive price is the USP of this place.My suggestion would be to reduce the no. of dishes and focus more on quality as only a  few dishes would  impress the discerning foodie.

The number 1 in Kolkata.. & I was yet to experience! I tried in every single instance.. but never happened.. sometimes because of non- availability.. & sometimes because, my co-foodies were tired of this place.. 
I literally jumped off when I was asked to arrange a treat for my team.. non-kolkattan team.. & I was sure they would be loving the brand name of Barbeque Nation.. & so did happen!

I made a reservation 3days before and was informed that Early Bird prices were increased during Puja. I was OK with everything in order to visit this place.. and ultimately, ended up reaching the venue 5mins before they even open their door!! They politely asked us to wait for 5-10mins and called us inside after a few mins. The decor is classy.. Dim lighting, Nice paintings on the wall, wooden tables.. and the smoky smell in the air.. it was getting tougher to resist! Black & Green plates respectively for Non-veggies and veggies..Nice!

They offered complimentary drink.. which included beer.. I opted for sweet lime soda.. 

Now started the flood of starters.. Chicken, Mutton, Prawn, Fish, Corn, Potato, Babycorn, Mushroom... The quality of Prawn was good but lacked spices.. Chicken was a little hard and the pieces were small.. Fish was the best of the lot.. tender and flavourful.. & the potato kebab.. fried with wedges in chat-like preparation.. tasted awesome! We all asked for a repeat .. thrice!! The service was good and quite fast I would say, considering the restaurant was fully packed!

The main course was a huge spread.. I had very litte space left after the starters.. but wanted to taste some of them. & I was disappointed.. There was Mutton Biryani.. Chicken and Mutton items.. a number of salads.. & the most terrible part was one of us discovered bones in the fish .. we had complained and they apologised for the same.. But nobody took the courage to have it again!

I moved to the Desserts section.. a lot of options.. Phirni, Gulab Jamun, Shahi Tukra, Vanilla ice cream, Fruit Gateu, Jamun cheesecake, fresh fruits (watermelon and papaya), Chocolate Mud Pie.. Shahi Tukra and Jamun Chessecake were a complete letdown... So was the mud-pie.. Gulab jamuns were awesome.. others were just average!

Very good service, super-special hospitality, loads of food.. but somehow they missed on the quality of their items.. Barbeque nation has been a pioneer in such kind of buffets, but they need to buck up in order not to lose out before their competitors! Frankly speaking, this place seemed to be a little overhyped and I have had much better spread in other places.. 

Not more than 3.5/5 this time.. & I really wanna come back to give it a full 5/5!!

Went on a weekday with colleagues and oh boy!! it was full. First thing you must do is to get a reservation before.
Live grilling on table is always interesting. Excellent kebabs/grills. A lot of variety is there for both veg. and non-veg. Beer was chilled too.
Main course too had too many options. The best part was the dessert for me.
Even there was live band performing. Overall a great atmosphere to hang-out after hard day's work at office. 
However, the live band sometime sounds too hard for your ear drums as the place is not that big to have that acoustic effect. The sofas are comfortable but they were torn. They needs to be refurbished. Billing is on slower side. All these things takes away a star from them.

Having heard a lot about this place from friends and seeing good reviews on zomato, i finally decided to visit this place with my family. The concept which is being picked up by quite a number of restaurants now is their tagline. Starters in the form of grilled items served to you on your table via a live barbeque is their hallmark. Served alongside butter to flavour your live barbequed items and their select sauces to accompany them is the one classic acts of this place. Though the decorum and the concept is quite good, the taste did not touch the heart much. The mutton bhuna gosht was good, but the prawn and the chicken tangri were too dry for my liking. However the labnese chicken and the parsley fish preparations were quite good.
By the time we came to the main course, I was more than half full. So, I decided to taste only their mutton dum biriyani and mutton dak bangla both of which were nothing more than good. The servings of sea food and chicken salad were very tasty. Intending to keep some space for desserts, I decided to end my main course though I had not tasted a host lot of veg and non veg items on the menu. 
In the desserts section, the angoori gulab jamuns were just yumm..... as they were piping hot and just melted within the mouth. The other items including the cassata pastry and the fruit cake were not upto my liking though the chocolate brownie was as good as expected.
Overall, it was a good experience but nothing close to being exquisite.

I had a different opinion after my first visit to this place, and that was unpleasant but I admit now,when I had a chance to revisit this place after quite some time I was really really impressed, hence I decided to completely edit my first review and write new one ! :)

It was my Dad's birthday this year and somehow everybody decided for Barbeque Nations. I was sceptical because it has been more than 2 years and I had a really bad impression on my mind. However we reached there without a booking and got a seat quite easily on a Saturday Evening. Truly their service has improved. Then came the BBQs and the little fries and appetizers and the drinks. Most were good, some needed a little improvement. But I must say their services were truly worth praising.Anyways there was a live band performing and somehow they came to know it was my dad's b'day and then came the surprise, they played the birthday song for him, the management brought a cake, we celebrated a little privately and then as a token of remembrance they clicked few snaps and gifted dad a lovely greeting card with those attached. This little idea of celebration was such a pleasant surprise. I don't have words to appreciated how happy that made all of us.
After this BN became my favourites and I decided to visit them often, so within a month or so I was here again. This time their service was even better, and the food was so out of the world, they served seafood just as I recommended them the previous time and I just fell in love with one of the fish preparation.

Well as an end note I can only say that the first impression is not always the last impression !

PS: I forgot to add, the price they charge is nothing compared to the number and quality of food have and the service they give!

Every time I have been to this place have fallen in love again. 
The best thing I like about this place is the behaviour of the staff, from the manager to the waiters, they are always welcoming.
The food needs no more description....what i like is all the kebabs and barbecues are well cooked...yet never dry.
The buffet option could do with some variations...with repeated visits...it becomes a tad bit boring.
The pricing is very very reasonable.
Simply put....this is a wonderful place to eat out with friends and family...

For a person who loves food, especially the grilled ones, this is the place you need to be when you are trying out a new place. Without doubt, this place serves the best buffet in Kolkata. I have visited this place multiple times over the years and it has never let me down. The service is excellent and so is the ambiance. If you don't like any particular dish, you may let it know and the chef will prepare the food according to your requirement.
Being one of the best buffets in the country, the pocket pinch is on the higher side. But its definitely worth it!!!

Barbecue nation: famous for their concept, and of course, unlimited helpings. Presence: Nationwide. The one in Kolkata is located in RDB boulevard in Sector 5- the IT area.
I went there about 3 times, the most recent being on the 8th of October, 2013, with my mother and little sister.
We had booked a table beforehand. The restaurant opened promptly at 7 pm, and we got our seats. we chose the non veg starters. The menu for the non veg starters consisted of lebanese fish, Australian grilled chicken and grilled prawns. The prawn and fish was delightful. The chicken was good enough. My mother did not really like the chicken, so the chefs made a special chicken starter just for her. Besides the above, which was being served in skewers, the waiters were coming with other types of dishes like mutton kebabs, bass and cajun spiced potatoes.
After a lot of stuffing, we finally started the main course buffet. The biriyani was ok, nothing very extraordinary. The other items, like the mutton rogan josh, were just about ok.
About the desserts, the angoori gulab jamun was extra soft and delicious. The fruit custard and ice cream was good too. The pastries were not up to the mark, though. I could not help but notice that I have had the same dessert each time i visited. I expected at least a little change in the items on offer.

So to sum it up,
Food: Very good, but tends to get quite monotonous after a few visits.
Service: Excellent. The waiters were ever courteous and helpful.
Ambience: Good. The live music was not bad.
I would recommend Barbecue nation to anyone who can eat a lot, and also to experience the interesting concept.

Have been to this place once in july this year with my girlfriend. i would like to comment and rate this resturaunt for its buffet only. if you love soft and juicy kebabs with the perfect flavour then barbeque nation, sector V  salt lake is the perfect place. 

the best thing about the menu is the  various varities of delicious starters that they serve. we ordered both veg as well as non veg starters and we were served atleast a 20 types of kebabs of chicken, mutton, fruits, prawn, fish & paneer. it was so delicious that we filled ourselves with it only. however, the main course isnt that good. the biriyani could have been better and the menu combination for the main course should be improved. the pancakes and tarts in the dessert were good but the firni tasted awfully bad. the varities if desserts should be increased. adding a complimentary soft drink or a hard drink will not be a bad idea to make it a perfect buffet.

A buffet and worth every single penny paid.

Barbeque nation is a pioneer of the concept of serving kebabs on the table with a variety of condiments and a grill to boot, and let the closet chefs conjure up the finishing touches to an already well prepared assortment of kebabs. Their service quality and taste is consistently outstanding nationwide. My first tryst with Barbeque Nation was this outlet at Salt Lake. 

Service: Extremely courteous and well trained on the finer details and taste of the kebabs.

Ambience: Classy interiors and a heady smoky smell of the kebabs being dished out an all the tables. Its a setting that instantly increases your hunger pangs.

Taste: Superbly done, and a huge variety. The tangri kebabs, fatty shammi kebebs, and fish ajwaini tikkas are personal favourites. Lapping these kebabs in a piping hot tandoori roti and taking scoops of the green chutney is simply an otherworldly experience. Put a few pegs of Glenlivet scotch in the equation, this is sheer ambrosia in the form of kebab and sharab. Though one can rarely muster any appetite for the main course after gorging endlessly on the kebabs, their biriyani are worth a bite or two. The piping hot gulab jamuns are the reliably good sweet ending to the meal.

We visited this place on a Saturday night this September. Charged 525+ taxes as we were there before 7:30. Total came out to be 649 per person. Brilliant experience overall.

Menu: 5/5
5 types of starters all mouth watering. But the day's special fish fry was just amazing. Authentic bengali fish fry that you can find in exotic hidden locations in Esplanade/College Street/DumDum was recreated that day. Coupled with mustard sauce (kasundi) its a bong foodie's delight!
Food: 5/5
Brilliant as always. This is my sixth time visiting a Barbecue Nation and the food just keeps on getting more and more awesome.
Service: 5/5
Okay I wanted to give them 10/5 in this one. They set the bar when service is concerned. And This is the first time I was there in a Saturday evening. The restaurant was full to the brim and still not a moment's delay. And the waiter always asks with a smile whether you liked the food or not and if you did why are you not having some more! The waiter also brought the day's chef and the manager to greet us and ask if everything was ok or if we had some improvement suggestions.
Ambiance: 5/5
Very crowded on a Saturday night and yet I am forced to give them 5/5. The reason being the brilliant outlay, the lighting and the Saturday night special, THE BAND! Performed some of my favorite melodious love songs. Although the decibel levels were a bit high with so many guests but they just made it all up with their service and the waiters' smiles.

Overall verdict: Guys, please don't change anything. I love the place. I love the food. I love the service above all. There are other restaurants at this price point but every time I want to go out, Barbecue Nation is my first choice. And whenever I go to another restaurant I come back comparing them to you and come back disappointed. I am willing to pay more but I won't accept a service any less or food any less than what it is now. You have set the bar that high.

Location: Opposite to RDB Blvd., Sector V, Salt Lake (very near to Omega towers)

Serves: North Indian / Mediterranean, specialties in Kebabs (starters)

Pros:
1. Nice ambiance with live song performance
2. Buffet (weekend) lunch / dinner is exceptional
3. Food variety and quality in buffet is awesome. The kebabs are simply lip smacking and keeps on coming till your belly is stuffed. Probably kebab lovers will have entire lunch and dinner on starters and desserts... skip main course, but do try their Biriyani. It is simply awesome.. the aroma and taste of the Biriyani will give a tough fight to Arsenal / Shiraz.
4. Desserts are awesome - gulab jamun, phirni and cakes.. simply love it !!
4. Great value for money

Cons:
1. Veg items in the buffet are not that great
2. Waiting time

Cost for 2: 1400 (non-veg dinner)

Must Try: The buffet lunch / dinner (non-veg) : the fried corn, chicken tangri kebab and mutton is just mouth-watering... the mutton and chicken are very tender and will just melt in your mouth...thumbs up to the Chefs of Bar B Que Nation... u r a tough fight for the 5 star professionals... Cheers !!

Barbeque nation is such a place which will never disappoint you.
I've been here twice and liked everything about this place.
The range of kebabs is almost endless,I especially like the Fish kebab which has a mustard flavor.
Biriyani in the main course,is sure to satisfy your taste buds.
The best is the gulab jamuns!omg,they are so soft and has just the right amount of sweetness.You can't have enough of it!
Though Phirni was a complete let down.

The ambiance is lively,waiters are always smiling and ready to help you out.

Not because they have a buffet (well , maybe a little ;) ), but because I love the kebabs and food they have. I do not like any other buffet restaurant as this one because of the taste of food and behavior of the people here. Well, behaved and trained staff. 

I love this place ! hands down !

A buffet spread sprawling with lengthy varieties as per the cost is concerned.

Been to this place a number of times but my last experience was out of this world. I felt that i didn't go to a restaurant but was invited to a total foodie friends place for lunch. The starters are just awesome with a whole lot of variety unlike any other place. Main course is also good ( If you are able to have it after trying out the various starters). Coming to the deserts what i would like to share actually, last time when i visited the place i was given a feedback form which i filled mentioning about the wonderful lunch i had but i expressed my disappointment for the deserts that were  in the course that day and went to the washroom.The moment i came out from washroom to leave from the restaurant a person came and asked me what was it that i didn't like about the deserts? When i told him that i am a chocolate freak and there were no chocolate deserts he pleaded me to give me a few minutes so that he can get some deserts prepared for me. I requested him for some other time,maybe next when i visit  as i was too full to even have a bite of anything but he wouldn't allow me leave the restaurant dissatisfied. He finally got me plate full of 2-3 types of chocolaty deserts with blue lagoon so that i can digest  ;) A meal with such love and affection that too in a restaurant is an experience to be remembered and shared. A restaurant with food served such cordially is rare to find and must to be visited not only once but again and again. BBQ nation rocks!!

Being an almost regular to the all you can eat buffet place, because of the close proximity to my home, BBQ nation is a foodie delight. Offering a wide array of both non veg and veg kababs as starters, it certainly leaves you delighted both in the variety and the overall quality. It was surprising for me being a non vegetarian that the vegetarian kebabs too were delightful. However it does go downhill when it comes to the main course as the biryani is nothing to write home about while the accompanying chicken and mutton dishes are just about okay. Thankfully the wide array of desserts makes up for it to an extent.

This is my second visit to bbq nation after two years, with reference to my first review they have added a kulpi counter which superb delicacy. 


Oh my god i went there once with my friends, i ate until i got tired. Delicious unlimited kebabs, prawns, tandoori. I was like the movie "charlie with a chance of meatballs ", i ate a heap of gulab jamuns in dessert, it was so yummy. I feel like my tongue getting wet while writing@ this review.
It was an awesome experience.

I visited here only once with my family. I liked everything here. The food,the decor and the service.. Everything is just perfect. My uncle who came from USA was surprised to know that kolkata has this kind of restaurents. The Kababs are just mind blowing...specially the prawn kababs...they were delicious... I too liked the crispy fried sweet corn... The Buffet was also good though we could not taste it as we were almost full having the kababs... but I liked the seafood soup and in the desert part I liked the firni that comes in small matkas... I would to come back here again and again...

TRIED TO RESERVED 2 PAX OF LUNCH FOR 20 TH OCTOBER,2013. BUT NOBODY RESPONSE THE CALL FROM LANDLINE   
OR MOBILE NUMBER. IF THERE HOSPITALITY AND AMBIANCE IS BAD SO THEY ARE NOT COMPETENT ENOUGH TO SERVE BEST FOOD. SO THEY ARE AVOIDING BOOKING...

their buffet spread is the best in kolkata...with some good dishes in the main course section also which are generally not given that much importance in other restaurants...
their kebabs r splendid..
so are the desserts...
they serve a complimentary drink of ur choice...
plus the happy hour thing is another attraction but only if u can enter by 12.30 pm(and not register yourself and stand in the queue only)....


overall an awesome experience...deserves a 5...

This place has always been my first choice for buffets since the past two years. Impeccable food, so much variety and every single dish is amazing. Starters are mainly kebabs... which they will keep serving you until you turn the little flag down. The main course has mostly Mughlai preparations with a few Salads nd pastas thrown in. The desserts is paradise for all you sugar freaks out there. Behavior of the staff is something that will make you keep coming back. they're extremely humble and courteous. Happy hours make the place affordable, and they never except tips!! All in all a must try, not too many continental dishes... but still top notch. Bon Apetite!

The barbeque is great and ideally one skulls fill their stomach with the barbeque as the main course is not very appealing! The desserts are not very tempting either!

Barbeque Nation never disappoints... Be it the kebabs, or the main course spread or the wonderful desserts to finish off... Went there today after almost a year and came out utterly satisfied and full... The starters were good as usual and today's Chef's special, A Grilled Fish was also good... My favourite in the Veg starter section is the Cajun Spice Potato and the Punjabi Tangri in the Non Veg section... There were mushrooms, paneer, prawns, fish and mutton as well... When we were almost full with the generous helpings of starters, we could not possibly overlook the sumptuous main course spread... I liked the Mutton Dum Biriyani, the Nihari Gosht, the Butter Chicken, Fish Amritsari and the Kashmiri Aloo Dum but could help myself to small portions only thanks to the preceding starters... The range of salads were also good... The desserts were great as well, my favourites being the Hot Gulab Jamun, Fruit Pudding, Caramel Custard and the Zebra Pastry... 

The one thing about this place is the ambience, with music playing in the background... The waiters and the managers are all very well behaved and make you feel at home... The wonderful service has to be one of the plus points of this place... Food, of course, being the first and foremost... You have the chef visiting each table asking for suggestions... The only improvement I could suggest is they could look at playing around with their buffet a bit as it has become repetitive.... Also the main course is something they need to pay more attention to though the starters and the desserts make up for the average main course... But all said and done its a great place to go and eat to the fullest... Possibly the best in terms of buffet restaurants in the city...  A paradise for non-vegetarians but the veggies wont be disappointed either...

Oh My! What an Experience! There are only very few restaurants that have made me their fan and trust me Barbeque Nation has done just that on the strength of its Starters and Service. To start off, the location is fantastic. There is valet parking, Thumbs Up for that. The minor glitch ? - There's always a waiting line outside the resto. Expected because of its massive popularity. The ambiance is really heart warming and makes you feel welcome. The Service is top notch. The Starters are fantastic, Lip Smacking and Awesome to say the least. The two mocktails we ordered were both a Class Apart. There were I think around 13-14 starters in vegetarian (whoa!). The dinner main course was ok types. Desserts were average. There's no tipping system. The live performance was good in parts. The performers were putting a lot of heart in their performances. Definitely visiting again soon. 4.5 stars for BBQ Nation.

A Classic Place that is one of a kind in Kolkata. I am a lover of this joint and like to visit it at least once a month with my friends and family. I Simply love the concept of live grill on the tables & Live music That is quite soothing. The starters are simply exotic for both veg & Non veg people. Main course is selective but nice quality. I simply loved the desserts section.
The Price might seem steep at first but once you start eating one can simply forget and get stuffed to his necks!!!
Thunbs Up!!! Please Visit At Least Once Guys otherwise you wont know what you are missing!!

mindblowing eating fiesta .. just an overflow of chicken prawn paneer and wat not ... starters itself was mindblowing ... had hardly any room for the main course ... main course is a buffet so took very little portions of almost everything .. still took 2 plates .. oh i cant even remember how many times i changed plates ... after the main course it was sweet dish .. hot boiling bowl of gulab jamun, a full drum of ice cream, a huge dish full of custard, cake, small pots of phirni .. take as much as u wish .. my recommendation take a bowl full of ice cream and pour  hot gulab jamuns in it along with the syrup and eat together ... pure delight .. got reminded of Ratatouille. ... just two words - PURE JOY

It was a heavenly experience, with immaculate coutesy and delectable as well as scrumptious food, which melteth in the mouth. One was already stuffed with the endless varieties and supply of kebabs and grills, before one realized that there was an equally tempting buffet spread just beckoning to be tried. I had but one regret - I carry just one stomach to stuff myself. It was a harmonious journey of the taste buds, the kebabs, the buffet and the stomach.

Recently my father, who is a strict fish-itarian, was extremely touched by their courtesy, when after serving him all kinds of imaginable fish kebabs, one of the stewards soptted him at the buffet looking for yet some more fish preparation to go with his polao. The steward politely asked him to take his seat, and sent him the fish dish at the table.

Even after all this, they complained to my father - "Sir you have not eaten enough" ("Sir, apni to kichhui khelen na").

That's what we call OLD WORLD ANTORIKOTA

Finally finally... Barbeque Nation struck off my wishlist. And boy did I eat to my hearts content. There was no room for disappointment and even if there was the management took care of it to give us a "fine dining experience". 

It all started on a lazy friday morning when my friend with his customary "aaj kuch karte hai" proposed dinner at Barbeque Nation. I lapped the plan and immediately called them up for a reservation only to be told that all reserved tables are booked and the remaining tables would open up on a first come first serve basis. With nightmares of being turned down again like the last time playing in my mind the manager assured us that if we reach by 8:30pm we will definitely get a table. With this we coaxed another friend of ours in joining us and planned to leave at 7:30pm calculating that the drive from southern avenue to sector V will atleast take an hour. But as usual nothing goes per our plan. My friend's car got stuck in his office and finally when we started it was well past 8. I made another frantic call with the fear of a futile drive to rdb looming large only to be assured that we'll get a table albeit a waiting time of 30 mins. Finally we reached Barbeque Nation logged in our name and prepared ourselves for the long wait. Within 2 minutes my phone rang and we were informed that our table was ready. And right that moment I knew "tonight's gonna be a good night"! 

As we entered we were greeted with a whiff of burning coal mixed with the aroma of charred meat and the live music doing its magic! Guided to our table I noticed the restaurant well spaced out and tables with their centres cut out for the live grill to be placed. The decor not too fancy but cozy enough to keep you happy.

The waiter explained to us the choices of the buffet. Being voracious non-vegetarians we settled for the non-veg option. On enquiring about the complimentary drink we were told that it is only included in the lunch buffets. So we ordered a peg of 100 pipers each.

As we had opted for both the veg and the non-veg kebabs so first we were served a skewer each of paneer, mushroom and a mixed veg kebab. The paneer tikka was ok but the mushroom kebabs were best- each button mushroom roasted to perfection. Then came the non-veg kebabs and frankly speaking I lost count of how many skewers the three of us had. There was a chicken kebab, a fish kebab, a prawn kebab, a mutton shami kebab and a chicken tangdi kebab ( I was so engrossed in eating that I forgot the names of the individual kebabs but who cares). All the kebabs were equally delicious. The chicken kebabs were tender and juicy and roasted to perfection. The fish kebabs were equally awesome but my favourite were the prawn kebabs that were cooked to perfection. I just couldn't have enough of the kebabs and skewer after skewer were served and the accompanying mayonnaise and the curd mustard dips enhanced the taste of the kebabs. The best part as that all the kebabs were tender and smoking hot! As we were having our kebab our drinks were served and to our surprise they got us another peg free which simply lighted us up!

Even after having so many kebabs I did save some room for main course and had a single serving of the biriyani and the sides of mutton chicken and fish. The gosht biriyani was lip smacking and could give any top notch biriyani joint a run for their money. I also found the mutton quite to my liking but owing to the heavy load of starters and to save room for desserts I cut short the main course which also had many options in veg.

Coming to desserts they surely know how to end it on a sweet note. The gulab jamuns were hot and tasty. The pastries were awesome. But the two best desserts were the malai souffle and the phirnee. I wish I could have some more but I was too full to have anything. Finally the three of us sat there sipping our whiskey and letting the heavy load of food settle down.

Barbeque Nation is such a place where you can't give a single bad review. They don't let it slip even for a moment and the management simply won my heart. Right from assuring us a table to ensuring our food suited our palate so that they could tweak it to an individual's taste. Every 5 minutes someone comes up to check whether you need something and no matter how many times you call them to your table they always do that with a smile. 


The ambience too was amazing and the live singer simply enhanced it. And yes they do cater to requests and I was lucky that they ended their performance with my request of "stand by me". 

Pros: the starters and the desserts but their hero are the waiters!! One good thing is they always serve bottled water for which they don't charge extra a rare sight in any restaurant. 
Cons: well nothing but one improvement is that I didn't quite like the fish goan curry much and it could have been better if the fishes in the main course were deboned.

Overall they do provide a fine dining experience and they do it with great humility which is wanting in many restaurants of kolkata. Maybe when you know that you are the people's favourite you are humbled and let your food do all the talking. Certainly my most favourite restaurant in kolkata and I'll never have enough of barbeque nation!! I am definitely coming back again!!

i had 3 appearances there and all time i njoyed it.... little costly but paisa wasool. kababs as the starters will increase ur appetite. prawn kabab and fish kababs are the best. mutton shik kabab is good, mushroom kabab nice. Deserts are awesome and all colorful deserts will fulfill ur desire. nice environment specially at night time. but never try to go for main course. it will drown u to water and all goodness will be bitter. main courses are phaltu and it will only occupy ur stomach to hinder u not to take so much deserts. but overall great to be there.

I have definitely fallen in love with their buffet.Its a paradise.The starters are awesome and plentiful....chicken,mutton,prawns,fish,paneer,potato.....whoo!
The murgh jeera tikka was awesome,along with the spicy cajun potato.I loved their service as well....the waiters were gratious and my plate and sheek was constantly full.Yes,they add a grill to ur table and give u sheeks of kebabs!The chef came to visit us personally and asked our opinion...i was at a gastronomic high and muttered 'its pretty perfect' without even thinking!
I had read that the main couse was unobtrusive,and i didn't spend a lot of time over it.The tom yum soup was good,the paneer heavenly,the chhole a bit on the saltier side....and the salads amazing!There was a chicken salad,a sea food salad,a pasta salad,apart from the usual vegetable salads.The mayo was amazing,too.Next time i go,i'll surely devote more time to the main course.
Now the desert....enticing.....the chocolate cake sinful,the caramel custard,icecream(vanilla,dipped with chocolate sauce) seductive,the fresh fruits a delight,the 'barbooza' a wonder! Angoori gulab jamun and phirni were delicious as well.
My stomach was bursting,my spirits soaring!One thing....they kept a watch over each of us and kept changing our cutlery each time we got up,suiting our needs at that point....
They give a complimentary drink,but we had gone on a dry day and i selected fresh lime soda.
I am simply waiting to get there again!

Food quality is amazing. Staffs are so courteous. One can't get such wonderful buffet in just Rs. 500. Kabab quality was just awesome. Ambience is good. Since they have huge demand so the place it bit crowded. But considering the food quality one can easily ignore that. Best part is, even chief chef personally came to meet us. Apart from food what was noticeable is, just beside my table there was a family with 2 small kids. Since they found fish kabab was bit spicy so they requested and chef prepared less spicy fish kabab for kids. I am sure that in buffet meal you won't get this customization in any restaurant. 

Just go there and enjoy your meal.

If you go before    12:30 pm then u get it below 500.Do make a call if you go before 12:30.Also they returned the tip and said that Service charges are included.Great hospitality service and food.BBQ ROCKS!!!

I was overjoyed to find out that BBQ nation had finally opened up in Kolkata.  I remember stumbling into the place just because I had gone to a movie in the cineplex next door. The place had just opened up and offered a great deal.

Have been there multiple times since the food is always amazing and fresh. I guess the highlight which differentiates from other outlets is freshness of the food. The outlet is also slighly lower priced than the other outlets around the country. The favorite dish of mine remains the cajun potato and the prawns.

The desserts on offerings are also great - "hot" gulab jamun and Phirni. Service is great - if you think anything is missing , bring it to their notice - they take care to compensate for it.

Tip : Please reserve a table, the fact it is located in the Sector 5 ensures a 100% occupancy in peak hours

Hail Barbeque Nation, Hail Kebabs, Hail just about everything. If only the seating capacity could have been bigger so that i can go there to have lunch on every Sunday of my life..!! The pricing is little on the higher side for the kind of place that its situated in because of the students and office goers crowds. A great place to visit with friends and spend quality time especially on evenings where they have a live jamming session with two of the most soulful and friendly singers i have seen. Luckily we sat just infront of their stage and they let us get involved wid their singing and also they sang most of our requests from Hotel California to Its My Life to Akon's Beautiful and even Chin ta ta ta...!!

The LORD of the yummiest Kebabs! It's like going to the Mecca of Kebabs which is right here in Kolkata. How I wished I had 2-3 extra tummies with me to eat more of their splendid and delectable Kebabs. I was there with my girlfriend and both of us loved this place for their excellent atmosphere (you can see the chefs working in front of flame right inside a glass room), food, and service. It was a pleasure to visit this place and we were determined to visit Barbeque Nation again and again. :) One thing, if you are there for Kebabs, don't put your flag down. Also, they served chilled beer too.

INSANE Rating for Barbeque Nation from my part.

Very good buffet indeed, but, in my opinion a bit overhyped. They are definitely great and one of the best, no doubt, but having many other strong competitors in the market, in my view, they definitely are not the best for weeks after weeks to be in #1. Food wise, best starters among all buffet selections in the town, good mains, excellent desserts, nice ambience (though I did like their previous address, the new one is little cramped on a full house day, which they do have probably all the days). The staff are very good and capable, but, please don't get hurt, they were much more friendlier few years back. I understand the waves of guests they have to tackle now a days, and definitely they do that very professionally and nicely. But, taking price, ease of access and parking (parking gives them a -1 on my scale), variations, quality and friendliness of staff, they are definitely on top 5, but, not 1. I can't stop myself quoting Manik babu (Mr. Satyajit Ray) here, "a creation can never be termed as The Best as because majority of people voted it as the best." My apologies to anybody if I hurt unknowingly. Fact still remains and i truly accept, this is one of the top buffet offers in Kolkata and I am a fan of them too.

BBQ Nation has always been one of my favorite restaurants specially for their starters. Its not only the taste of the Kebab, but the overall package of how they serve it and the way you can even get kind of cooking exp (virtual though :D) is the best part. Though I am strictly non-veg person but surprisingly I absolutely love their Potato Tikka/Kebab with its sweet and spicy flavor. The next thing I like is the never ending options of their desserts. This is the part when I love to re-fill my plate as many times as possible. To me, main course is kind of 'Ok' and I really dont care as long as their starters and desserts made my 'Paysa Usul'.
Price is at a little higher side but I know thats worth the food they serve.

This restaurant is THE restaurant for most foodies enjoying grilled barbecue items, particularly for those office goers in Salt Lake Sector V. They serve never ending helpings of starters as much as you can eat and will keep serving you as long as the flag on your table is high up. The waiters takes care in ensuring that the skewer rods on your table have the choice item that you prefer. If you love some specific item and call it out, sometimes I have also had the cook come down to take your complements and then offer you alternative items that  you would suggest to be cooked as per your own recipe. The sumptuous spread after the starters followed with an equal great spread of desserts is full money's worth. This restaurant love pampering their guests and the guests also acknowledge that by repeated visits.

kebabs kebabs kebabs . what can i write about all those fantabulous splendid grotseque brobdingnagian ambrosian demulcent kebabs. i m in love with kebabs and this place is a heaven for me. i would rather die than to lower the small flag on their table. a huge variety of chicken kebabs,mutton kebabs,stuffed mushroom kebabs,shark kebabs gratify my tongue and satisfy my mind.
though i hardly had their main course but all those diametric distinct salads,biriyanis firnies makes me hypersalivating. one day i will definitly try to bypass some of the kebabs,put my flag down and go for plateful of main course.
n yes they serves you a complimentary drink. 
i will rate them 5 as their is minimum cons and theirs a secret of getting the buffet 150 less but i m not going to disclose it ,u foodies hunt the kebabs and know their time secret ;-)

Okay, so what can I say about this place that haven't been said already....? Well, I had first gone there not knowing much about the place or what to expect....And what I experienced was seriously Insane ! Its a paradise for non-vegetarians like me....the Kebabs just keep on coming and I seemed to develop an appetite which I never knew existed ! Just loved gorging on the succulent Kebabs...the Fish kebab was the best.The Main Course was good enough.....with Biryani, Curries, Salads and a lots of other stuff. 
Service is awesome and you never feel rushed....you can take your own sweet time, enjoy the music and then get up to taste the yummy Desserts. What i loved most was the Firni and ofcourse, the Gulaab jamuns with Ice cream. Its a wonder even to me how I managed a plateful of desserts after all that......Yes, the food was that good. Cant wait for my next visit there.....Heavenly ! A Perfect 5. :)

Barbeque Nation is perfect place to eat if you are not greedy for  kebabs... on my visit to 25th December 2012 I was going for chicken  kebabs... and aftr 6 steaks they deliberately gave me two stale steaks of chicken  kebabs. It was to stop me eating more steaks or.. accident... It sets my entire mood off. Never visited them again.. nor gonna recommend it to anybody else.

A saavy restaurant offering lavish Buffet during day & night,conveniently located at sector 5.
The ambience is good & the spread is also very varied & sumptuous!
Has a lot in common with Flame & Grill.The service is good & staff prompt & courteous.
The price is between 550/- to 650/- and is definitely value for money!
A la carte is also available.Difficult to find a place on week ends without booking!
Tandoori Prawns,Mutton Sheek kabab, Chicken Malai Kabab is awesome.Has a real good spread 
of main course and those who crave for sweets will definitely wont be depressed!
Overall rating is excellant .......a must visit with the family!

what do u say for a place which has great food,fantastic ambience,reasonable price and yet such great service..
i could only think of one thing..i want one in south calcutta.bigger and better than the one in sector 5.
one tip..they keep you serving kebabs leaving you with little space for the rest of the buffet which is quite good too,especially the desserts..so visit the buffet counter before you start stuffing up to your necks with kebabs
happy eating

This is my fav resto in kolkata.hv been there arnd 4-5 times. every time i visited, i was never dissatisfief.their huge array of mouth watering kebab starters are awesum.they even serve some special items attimes, like last time we had shark. the service is too good.main course is average.desserts are again superb.they range from baby gulab jamuns, firni, ice cream with chocolate sauce, fresh fruits, pastries, brownies, custard etc.. 
the best thing i like about them is their personal touch.the chef himself came n ask us how was the food. once we complained that there r no chocolate pastries in d desserts, the chef then personally baked us gooey chocolate brownies and they also gave us another set of complimentary mocktails. and another big thing, we offered tips but they gave it back. it is this kind of gestures that makes your dining experience extra special.

For all the food-o-philes, this is The place which definitely will make you go gaga for you can gorge to your heart's content without the slightest element of regret. Ambiance is  awesome with a soothing live music that makes the experience worth remembering. If you love grilled food, missing out on this place is an absolute crime. Each of the starters are a delight in their own way and I surely cant categorize which one is the best. Given the quality, taste and decor...you will not mind the pinch in your wallet. Staff is cordial and ensures that your skewers are replenished even before you can gulp down the first lot. The only suggestion..don't stuff yourself with starters...for the main course is equally amazing. The choice of salads and desserts is unique. 
The flip side...there is only one in Kolkata...time for the management to seriously think about more branches across the city for the food loving Kolkatans..BURP!!!

Probably the best place you have in the city for North Indian food......you'll have an awesome array of starters, veg as well as non-veg......the kebabs are mouth-watering and you can never have enough of them......there is a pretty good spread for the main course as well, but then after the starters you probably won't have much left for the main course......the desserts are exciting though......the hot gulab jamuns along with a couple of scoops of vanilla ice-cream are a big hit......

Apart from the food, the ambiance too is praiseworthy......the service is usually fast (except at the very peak hours)......the staff are cordial and there's also a small stage and a mic......looks like a setup for a karaoke, though I haven't yet seen anyone singing there......the only disadvantage is the location at Sector V.....which makes it a tad too far for a weekend visit......but then again their main target customers seem to be the IT industry crowd there......so can't blame them......

And if its your birthday, let them know......they'll arrange for a cake and even sing Happy Birthday to you......would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good Indian food......

Also want to add another thing to the above review, While we were leaving the waiter caught up with us and returned the tip we left for him mentioning that the restaurant charges a service fee and thus he couldn't accept the tip. 
I was pleasantly surprised and amazed with such behavior. There are a lot of places that charge service fee and yet do not mind the tip. This is the only place I have come across that actually returned the tip. 
Even the Valet didn't take money for the service for the same reasons. 
Very very pleasantly surprised and amazed. EXCELLENT.

Being a vegetarian I was avoiding this place for the longest time . Finally was dragged to BBQ nation by a friend and was not at all disappointed. The decor of the place is very pirate-y and although we had to wait for almost half an hour for a table it was all worth it . 
The starters were excellent and by the time we were done with them we had no place for the main course . The main course was quite average though. The service was really quick and excellent . Our plates were kept full and the kebabs kept flowing in till we told them to stop . 
Would love to go to the place again . 
I'm told the non veg is to die for . So all in all a must try if you are in this part of the city.

Probably one of the best buffets in the city. Cannot say much about them. You need to go there and experience. I am giving them 4.5 out of 5 only because of the reason that they give too many items in the main course after such a huge amount kebabs. It is difficult to eat most of them after unlimited kebabs. My recommendation, they should reduce the the number of items in the main course, as people generally go to Barbeque Nation to have unlimited kebabs, not focus on the main course. The desserts are also really good. They will have a special kebab every day apart from chicken, mutton, prawn and fish. Last time I went they served Shark Kebab, it was really awesome.

Barbeque Nation is the 'Baap' of buffet joints. Somehow I feel they revolutionized buffets in India. Plus its a buffet where you don't even have to get up to get most of the stuff. The restaurant is practically designed to gorge on starters and then finish of with a generous helpings of deserts. The intermediate main course doesn't really stand out neither does it make an effort to. The place is always busy and a good place for friends and family, not for a date. Its an ideal place for an office lunch. Anyway the service is prompt and ensures that you eat much more than your stomach can handle. However I must point out one thing, since I have been to this place quite a few times, now I find the place boring because they served the same starters every time I have been there. The place needs a refresh in terms of the menu. But even after saying that I feel the place has a lot to offer, especially for people who have not been to a buffet like this. Surprisingly (I say so because I am a pure non vegetarian) one of the stand out starters is the potato patty in kaju. Refreshing taste among the deluge of chicken, prawn and fish tandoors. Oh yeah, I cant judge whether the place is cheap or expensive, if you are a small eater then surely it is expensive but if you can eat as much as I can then the place gives enormous value for money. So call a bunch of gluttons and get down there and eat your heart out!!!!!!!!

Went to this place as it was the highest rated Restaurant in Calcutta. And it might just have earned that. 

The starters kept rolling on and we couldn't decide whether to start with one or the other. Most of them were really good and we are ourselves full with all the wonderfully barbecued items.

However, the best thing about the restaurant for me was the service. The staff kept coming and offering us things politely, took feedback and acted on it instantly. Always on hand and always smiling. Definitely made the meal better.

One con I had was the 'band'. I don't know if it's the same every night, but on that night it was a low. Started off well with a couple of classics, but then moved on to shambolic hip hop and pop music like Justin Bieber. Really? Wasn't in tandem with the place.

Will be going back very soon.

one of the best places i had ever been to...we reached at the peak hour without reservation and had to wait for 45 mins...but once we got  a table, the food and the service mesmerized us...the waiters were not only cordial and speedy , they proactively came up for feedback on food and service every now and then...there were 6-7 types of kebabs and every bit of it was delicious...the complimentary drink was good too...we were almost full when we were done with starters...still tasted a  few of their maincourse items...the chicken lemon coriander soup was yummy...however the Gosht Dum Biryani was a  lil cold , hence couldn't meet upto my expectations...but once reported the waiter apologized and requested for some biryani they were about to serve...coming to the desserts, think i tasted the best phirni in town...the best part was the chef himself coming to meet us , with a  special dish...hot almond pie! All's well dats ends well...and this one was as good as the rest of it...he took feedback on our entire experience. i felt they made us feel so special, which they do to each and every customer who visits there...they make u feel at-home...specially when it comes to comparison with Flame and Grill, Nations wins in terms of the quality of food, hospitality and even the charges (felt the service was worth my money, wouldn't have felt bad spending a  few hundred bucks more for the amount of food we enjoyed).Kudos Barbeque Nations for being such a  foodie's paradise!

I still feel full, and my stomach still jiggles with the few extra jamuns I had, but I'll still write.. :P 

Zomato says 'Excellent', I say 'Insane'.. This place is a foodie's paradise! From decor to food to hospitality, this place is a clear winner.. They serve food like there's no end of it, and you keep eating like you're Joey Tribbiani! This place simply blows you away..
It was my partner's birthday and we reached 10 mins before noon.. They politely told us to wait, and we were the first to be ushered to a table as soon as the place opened.. It was tastefully decorated.. Perfect lighting, beautiful paintings on the wall, wooden tables, and music playing softly in the background ( although I strongly recommend them to do away with the Justin Bieber tracks ASAP, they really don't go well with food).

We were given the choice of a complimentary drink.. And I was happily surprised to see them offering beer!

Now the starters.. a flood of kebabs of different types- Chicken, Prawn and Fish with Mutton steak and Tangri Kebab. Succulent and tasty as they were, we were served and served again with surprising speed, as if one waiter had separately been allotted to look after our table! The mutton was tender, topping my list. My partner liked the prawn best as she, although not being a voracious eater, easily had quite a few sticks.. And they kept asking us if everything was fine, if we needed anything.. The Chef came to meet us, and I casually mentioned to him that it was my partner's birthday.. Which he remembered and surprised us later!

The main course had such a huge spread that I've even forgotten a lot of those names by now.. But there was chicken Lemon coriander soup, which was a tad too tangy for my palate.. There was Chicken n seafood salad, mushrooms in teriyaki sauce, naans/lachha paranthas, Gosht Dum Biryani, which was as good as anything, chicken n laal maas (mutton curry if you will).

By the time you're done with these, and you start feeling that you might just start floating, a delectable spread of desserts awaits you.. Phirni, Gulab Jamun, Vanilla ice cream, Fruit Gautex, jamun cheesecake( which btw my partner thought was a brilliant idea, n I agree), white forest pudding, fresh fruits,mud pie......... Did I miss something? Possible, given the number of items sitting there.. Phew! And yes, in case I forgot to mention again, the waiters were in the polite best, asking us with every item if it was okay..

Just as we thought we couldn't be any more satisfied, they presented us this beautiful cake for her birthday.. It was White forest, and one of the softest and creamiest I've ever had! #Cherryontop

Seriously, Could I write anything more to praise them? The food is excellent, the service prompt, and hospitality ideal.. They're worth every good word and brownie points they've been earning so far.. Deservedly one of the best restaurants in Kolkata.. They asked us to visit again.. They didn't need to! :)

P.S. They don't take tips.. We tipped them real nice, but the chef politely refused saying they already charged us with the service tax! Now that's something you don't get to hear quite often, do you?

         Try to make a reservation before you go.. 'Cause in all probability, this place will be full.

Barbeque Nation is one of the best restaurants in the city and offers the most lavish buffet in both veg and non-veg for foodies, who are seriously looking for delicious food at economical prices. The service is by far the best you would have ever come across with waiters, managers and even Chef coming to you and taking your suggestions, feedback and implementing the same almost immediately to ensure you have the most satisfying meal money can buy. 

The management has ensured that not even a single scope is left open for the visitors to complain and they take customer service very seriously and you will feel it the moment you step inside the restaurant. On our most recent visit, we were offered double the items in starters than what was actually in the menu and we were too surprised and astonished at this unusual gesture. With over 10 starters given in veg, we had no reason to regret choosing Barbeque Nation as our first choice. Kudos to the wonderful service. I feel its better than many other star properties in town, in terms of quality as well as service.

We had planned to go to this place for many days,but somehow it was not happening,but i didnt loose the chance to go when one of my friends wanted to give a treat to me and my girlfriend for his new job.God bless him..:)

well,we chose to go there for dinner for some reasons..1.there will be much less rush than the busy lunch hour of sector five..2.parking can be done easily..3.as we saw the rate chart in zomato,we thought there will be more varieties in dinner than lunch.So one fine evening i drove them there and parked my car smoothly and felt a cool breeze through the alley of our famous IT hub despite being a much-humid-less-rainy day. 

Oh,it was a vast place to dine in though a little bit congested and noisy comparing with flame and grill or mainland china,two other famous restaurants who serves great buffets in kolkata.

The courteous staffs greeted us well and took us to our table and there was live music also and the popular numbers on speakers made our evening with a good start.A burning box came within a minute to take place just middle of our table and we ordered non veg and then...it was a series of starters...prawn,chicken kebabs on the burning box,mutton seek kebab on plate along with fish finger,crispy corn,a large amritsari chicken tengri.we didnt have to tell them to repeat instead they were coming to us time to time to know our wishes and we  gradually became monsters :).They provided ice for drinking water also to make us comfortable.

At the time we remember that there was main course also we were almost full,so took some time and chatted within ourselves and listened the live performance,the manager came with the head chef to greet us and share our ideas about the food,a big thanks to him.

Then we went for the main course,there were several types of salads,mutton biriyani,mustard fish,a chicken and a mutton item,soups,papad and we had very little space in our tummy :).So we took little of everything and again it became large and we struggled,each and every time we went for a new dish,on return we were more than happy to see that they already made our table clean and set new cutlery.

They had about 10 types of desert..firni,cheese cake,browny,ice cream and etc and at last we completed.

Regarding the taste of the food i cant say they are the best,as i got better kebabs and biriyani in other not so expensive places in kolkata,but the experience of buffet was awesome,its not only a place where you go and eat your food and return happily,rather it is place where you can enjoy the evening and remember for long.

PS-the staffs refused tips :o

Being a non-vegetarian i was very pleased with the vegetarian preparation. Good place to spend time with friends. Although, the floors were a little slippery for a buffet. It was like i had to skate through to the buffet table and back to my seat. Desserts were disappointing. another important thing to remember is being a crab lover but u don't always get it.  Waiters and valet guys don't take tips. Its included in the bill. However, try calculating the bill once....you will figure out the only flaw in the restaurant. well over all i would say good food and good ambiance...

Excellent service. My wife asked for a soup without ajinomoto. The chef came and explained that the sauces might contain ajinomoto. And then, he made us a special soup with any sauces that might contain ajinomoto. Simple gesture, but goes a long way. 

We left a big tip, but the waiter rushed outside and return the tip saying they don't accept the tips as they charge a nominal service charge. Thumbs up!

Barbeque Nation is the place if you love barbeques. I get stuffed with the starters every time that I've been there and the main course / desserts just gets ignored!

The best thing is the barbeques with the sauces available at your table.

They have a huge spread for the main course, lots of options in salads, soup, maincourse gravies all indian chinese and continental, staples from rice, noodles and biryanis, the dessert section had neatly arranged little pastries, brownies, phirni, gulab jamoon, ice-cream and freshly cut fruits. Unfortunately we were so full of starters that we could not do justice to the other stuff, generally people tend to overload themselves with the starters and then they are too stuffed to try out the mains and desserts. However I feel the best way to have is that after a set or 2 of the starters.. move on to the main course and try out the desserts. This way, you get to enjoy the whole spread offered.

The waiters are friendly and the ambiance is nice. The place may be a bit expensive but its worth it once in a while.

My Rating-
Taste - 8/10
ambiance - 8/10

If you love buffet meals,you just have to visit this place.
This place offers probably the best buffet in town.The spread is just unbelieveable.I dont think any other place offers so many items and so many varieties in their buffet spread.
The quality is also very good.The kebabs are just excellent.They offer about 8-10 types of kebabs which includes varieties of veg,chicken,mutton and also prawns.The desserts are aslo brilliant both in terms of quality and varieties.The quality of the Biryani and the main course items are slightly inferior to that of the kebabs and desserts.But then the quality of the kebabs are just so good and its likely you will be very full when you actually move on to the main course items.So i guess its a bit difficult to judge.
The only disadvantage of the place is its location.It is a bit difficult to visit if you do not have your own car specially if you visit the place for dinner.

Visited this place again a few days back.The buffet was absolutely excellent as usual.Though the prices have increased,the quality has been maintained.The service too was impeccable.Another good thing is that here tipping is not recommended.Overall we had a wonderful experience here and that too not for the first time.This place surely deserves a 5 out of 5! :)

Yesterday I went to Barbeque Nation with my family... We've been coming here for 3-4 years now. Every time, the entree and desserts please me and my parents awfully. The prawns and mutton kebab are my favorite in non-vegetarian menu, and Cajun spiced potato and fruits in veg 'off the grill' menu. Have to agree, the main course has been same over three to four years, so they need to change that a bit. Desserts are delightful.
Overall, the food is totally awesome!

Last Sunday we tried the food at Barbeque Nation. The buffet is excellent. Huge array of chicken, mutton, fish, prawn, shark kebabs with fried corn and dips. Mushroom topped over all! the chef himself came and asked us about the kebabs and when we asked for some chicken variations, they got 3 different chicken kebabs under 15 mins...wow. The waiters are gentle and service is worth praising. I would always suggest anyone who loves to have kebabs to surely visit once. Do not miss to have their desserts, they are  fantastic.

I have gone to mainland china a lot of times and its hard to get down to saltlake from santoshpur very often, whrn u dont work there. So, this was just my second time there, with my family. And it was a just afabulous experience, keep aside the othe sunday night one. 

 The food quality is excellent, with the mushrooms, and the soft and juicy muttons being my most favourites!!! Other than that , the fish was awesome,along with the chiken and the prawns. 
The ambience is also good, but the songs are played very loud, even if so , they can play soft melodious piano tunes, rather than make people sing bollywood or english music. 

The service is no doubt the very best i have seen amongst all other restraunts in calcutta. After learning my father is vegetarian, they brought three other fish items very soon, and all were excellent. 
The BIRIYANI, one of my most favourites were just so good!! I have never eaten a biriyani with so less oil, and with the perfect mixture of of plain, coloured rice. The othr side dishes were also good , but special mentioning is required for the gulabjamuns amongst the desserts.
    And amongst all restaurants, they are the first ones whom i have seen to refuse a tip, and give it back, with pleasure. Hope i will also be third time lucky to get such a wonderful experience

i chose dis place for treating my friends on my birthday,which is on POILA BOISHAK...i had  completely no plan for giving a treat in a restro,n invited all my friends at my  place as the previous years..bt just a couple of days before,my mom fell sick coz of the tremendous heat of april,n my father asked me to take my friends out for lunch.
now,came the problem! its 15th april almost all restaurants in the city are over crowded,n perhaps i didnt want to feed stale or uncooked food to my friends.moreover,i failed to get reservations for 7 of us anywhere..all the mainlands n the park street bunch refused..barbeque nation came to rescue!
they didnot give us a reservation either,but asked us to arrive sharp at 12 when the buffet starts,as they keep 40% of their seats unreserved for flying customers. we arrived at 12:25 n were amazed to find the entire place was almost full! still they managed a table for us n then started the story of its hoisted flag!
innumerable array of chicken,mutton,fish,prawn,mushroom,shark kebabs with fried corn and dips!! i found the mushroom topped over all! the chef himself came and asked us about the kebabs...we asked for some chicken variations and suprisingly they got 3 different chicken kebabs just in next 10 mins! the waiters were too gentle,their service was worth praising!
coming to the main course,soup,biryani the best in town,bhetki in mustard sauce,chicken butter masala, a prawn n muttom item, with salads n  pastas! the veg section had another spread including ghee-bhat, dal,paneer,mushroom,a delicous brinjal item etc etc! the spread in the maincourse was  VAST..no other restaurant in town serves such a huge spread and that too,every item was cooked to PERFECTION! we also got complimentary BEER pint at this price!Gosh, how do they manage all of these!
next the deserts blew me off,flavourful pastries,payesh,gulab jamunn,cut fruits,malpua,ice cream with strawberry,mango n choc sauces and oh yes the firni!! 
THERE ARE NO LOOP HOLES...n well,we got the early bird offer..that comes to 500 per head inclusive taxes instead of 630..yippeeee!!

This place is just opposite to my ex-office. I have been to Barbeque Nation a numerous occasions and been a quite regular at there food festivals. I would always suggest anyone who loves to have kebabs to surely visit once. Do not miss to have their desserts, they are really good. Extremely courteous staff, always have been helpful. When live music is played, you can send your request of songs and they play them delighfully !! 

Kudos and do keep re-inventing !!

BARBEQUE NATION-The name that instills hunger!!! If I need to site the one restaurant where I would like to have my last sumptuous meal before leaving Kolkata, it would be THIS. Barbeque Nation is bound to satisfy even the most fastidious person on earth and that too simply with their awesome preparations. Their buffet is the most fascinating one in Kolkata, both in terms of quality and the choices they provide you. Barbeque Nation has the axe effect on people who love to eat. This restaurant can make foodies go "Bow chika Bow Bow".

Located in the IT-sector of Kolkata, it enjoys brilliant advantage of the location. But the thing that makes it what it is, is FOOD. Its their brilliant food that has made Barbeque Nation the most sought after restaurant in town. My college being very close to the place, I have had the opportunity of dining here quite a number of times but still I get goosebumps on hearing the name. Barbeque Nation is so popular among my friends circle that we don't need to coax each other to shell out extra money for giving birthday treats at this place. Nowadays however it has become extremely difficult to get a place and the last couple of times we tried to reserve, we had to be disappointed. So please plan properly if you want to dine here.

The decor is unique and has the "Pirates of the Caribbean" theme. However I noticed this on my third visit because who bothers about the theme when the food is soooo goood. Some time back they had a huge number of choices but now it has been limited. Moreover you would be asked whether you would opt for the veg starter or the non veg one. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how the veg is but the non veg starters are the best you would ever get in a buffet spread. They have a flag which can be turned down if you want to stop refilling your starters. The waiters are always cautious and keeps on refilling. In starters, most of the times they have two chicken kebabs, one prawn, one mutton and a fish kebab. 

I personally don't like the mutton too much but others are just too good. Like most other buffet restaurants in town, Barbeque Nation also has a live grill on every table. Once you start your starters and keep on having them you are bound to repent on the amount that you can consume. The kebabs are soft and succulent and the proper marination makes them appealing not only to your taste buds but also to your olfactory organs. I head to this place to satisfy my avarice for good food, but somehow my mouth wants more than my stomach can hold. At the end of a tiresome journey with the starters, every time I get so full that I skip the main course. The main course is appealing though, with biriyani and other stuffs. But honestly speaking I saw their entire main course menu first time in zomato:P.

I tend to give myself a well deserved rest for about half an hour and then jump on the desserts. The desserts are also exotic. Everything, starting from the brownies, to the sweets are top class. But the fruits are not that good. Especially, every time the papaya remains insipid. But these are trifles that I just don't like giving a damn about. Run to this place for brilliant starters and desserts. I really need to go here again. So that's it and what else to give but a 5 on 5.

Ambience is good. Service and hospitality of the waiters and managers is appreciable.  Cost for two is around 1500 /-.The buffet the provide  is awesome (items may change in case of any festival). As appetisers they provide :-
Fruit kebab (innovative and not bad), paneer kebab(good), a dry preparation of smashed potato(very good),prawn kebab(very good),chicken tengri kebab(good), chicken kebab(good), basa fish kebab(good), mutton salami kebab(not bad) etc. in mail course they provide plain rice, some veg items like mix vegetables, a fish item(gravy), mutton Biryani ( very good with tender mutton pieces), a chicken item ( gravy), a mutton item ( gravy). The side dishes often varies from time to time. The desert is also good : mango cream, strawberry cake, chocolate cake, different flavoured scoops o ice cream with chocolate sauces. The little gulab jamun is also awesome.

Barbeque nation is truely one of the finest places to visit in the city.  I just made a trip there with ny cousins and thus we discovered a whole new place in salt lake area. Whoever said that salt lake is not among the 'happening places ' in the city is surely wrong because last night i was there in the restaurant with at least 100 other people who were there till late night. 
For the food , its an absolute ten on ten for me ! Specially their mushroom and fish finger ! The american corn dish that they served first was very unique and interesting. Usually you will find restaurants giving a salad of american corn but this place takes you a step further. Among their main course, the biryani stole my heart away along with the rich dal makhani, both being a very weak spot in my food pattern. 
Apart from the food the pricing is perfect for any one who seeks good food in terms of quality and quantity. The service men are always on the go ,replenishing your platter every time and the chef personally came out and asked me for a feedback( which means either he is extremely down to earth or he has some secret crush on me ) which made me feel important. Haha ! 

So basically don't think twice before checking out this place because no matter where you go, barbecue nation will never let you leave hungry ! 
So keep your flags up for more such fabulous restaurants and as usual let me know if i did any help to your decision about eating ! 
Till then, keep eating !

Awesome experience!! Nice ambience..mouth watering dishes..love going there again n again...the people who are criticising the restaurant don't know how to savour the delicacies offered by a decent cooking joint. For them the grapes will always be sour. The other joints such as Ocean Grill & OMG are absolute trash & there is simply no comparison.

horrible experience never want to go back there, first of all it took so damn long for the management to give us seats, the place is very noisy with people shouting and talking, the food standard has gone down badly since this was second visit to Barbeque nation. The staff were very rude and just wanted us to clear off the table and kept asking can we bring you the cheque... which is very unethical.

one of the finest restaurants I have ever been... really...the ambience is pirate ship themed..
its really cool...then there is live music too...I went on a Saturday so don't know if live music is there during weekdays or not..anyways.. the staff were really very friendly and well behaved...and everything was done to make customers feel happy....coming to the food..their starters are the best!!  lots of kababs...crab...shark kabab...chicken kabab paneer kabab etc etc....the alcohols are also moderately priced not very high...! honestly in restaurants u don't only pay for food..u pay for an experience and a nice service.. if u want very cheap alcohol u can go to olypub but return with a horrible experience.. so never complain about prices if service is good..in main course there us not much choice... I guess that can be improved ..but the starters only filled my stomach...anyways...1 very good thing is the staff were honest...when we tipped them .the manager immediately came and returned the tip saying they charge service tax so they won't accept any tips..that was really nice considering many restaurants (staff) run behind u for tips!!!  and as it was my dad's birthday they played a special birthday song for him by the live musicians and also gave a complimentary chocolate cake!!!  these small gestures touch our hearts ..people only look at money...sometimes we have to look beyond..the services we get is a lot more than what we pay for...yes for most of the people it will be costly as it was for us...but the services compensated it...overall a very thrilling experience riding on the shores of a pirate ship towards barbeque nation!!!!! please improve the main course...

Barbeque Nation is one of those places which needs to introduction. All-you-can-eat buffets are always high in recall with value-conscious patrons, and I'm no different. That said, it isn't cheap, but BBQ Nation seeks to offer loads of variety. Given that my office is in Sector 5, we eat here often. 
I wouldn't call it awesome, but I would recommend it to people looking for a place to hang out and eat in big groups. Service is prompt, which is nice, and there is no dearth of variety no matter if your diet is veg or non-veg. What makes me dock it some points is that the marinade for quite a few of the starters is the same, so even with different meats, you end up with similar flavours. Also, there is a lot of repetition, especially if you're a frequent visitor. The kewra laden biryani is a particular pet peeve of mine personally, and I do wish Kolkattans got an opportunity to try some "real" biryani sometime.
Lastly, i think the drinks are absurdly priced, which means that if you're the type who enjoys a drink or two with your food, you're going to experience quite a big pocket pinch. 
Ultimately, BBQ Nation doesn't succeed as a 'stand-out' kind of place.

I think thisn is the destination for Sec-V crowd at lunch time! Specially when the happy hour stars from 12 PM! But it is very tough to get a place if you do not have an advanced booking. Their speciality is their starters .. you will have delicious veg and non-veg starters in front of you in the grill till you are over and put the Flag down! You will hardly have any space left to move towards the main course. In the desert also you will be spoiled for choices.

Yes with no doubt Barbeque Nation will be the first choice for a non veg kebab lovers, yes its also for me.There buffet price is also affordable as they had different options with diffident trimmings. I really Love Korean Prawn of there,its so tasty..Then Punjabi tangri its really spicy.
When I visited Barbeque Nation I ate only the starter & desert because after that I had no capacity to eat other things though there was many items in the buffet menu ,but was impossible to eat for me. Ambiance is also good & also the behavior of the staff they are really friendly.Overall this place should be visited by everyone specially those are kebabs lover...

This is one of my favourite places to eat in Salt Lake Sector V area. The decor is also quirky with murals that seem to be inspired from Pirates of the Caribbean and Finding Nemo ! Good value for money , quick service and the starters are superb. Infact by the time your done with the starters there is no room to really enjoy the buffet ! Service is good and the waiters keep your plates full with the delicious starters. The have a grill on your table and an assortment of condiments which you can use to personalise the flavours.The skewers are colour coded with red for non veg and green for veg dishes and its these little details along with the good service that has made this restaurant a big success. They serve up pretty decent dessert as well though to be honest I never have room to do it justice.

A must try joint for foodies that experiment with innovative food and if u go by the rating it has already been rated 4.5./5 the highest any restaurant has got in the city...

It was my fifth visit to Barbeque Nation, but it was the first time that I really enjoyed the meal. There can be a reason for this, because all my previous visits were on the days of some celebration/occasions(pujas, national holidays), when it was extremely crowded and the quality of the food was compromising.
But this Monday, when I entered the place with my fiance, I was greeted with a warm smile and the stewards were very well behaved and the service was pretty good. They came up to ask about the food and also offered complimentary dishes.
The fish was fresh and the preparations were awesome. We loved the parsley fish and the complimentary chilli fish was crispy on the outside, and soft inside- perfect! Fish steak was in a way innovative, but the topping made it soggy (though tastewise it was ok). We expected something better in chicken, but it was standard. The jhinga anarkali was a bit raw, but it did taste good. By the time, we were done with the grills, we barely had place for the main course. So, we decided to just go for the chicken salad and chicken and mutton preparations. 
The dessert spread was also interesting. they had strawberry souffle, icecream, firni, gulab jamun, cakes, but what stood out,was the caramel custard!! yumm.. . 
Overall, the experience was very good! we would come back for more!

A place worth a visit. What else would you expect from this? Being there was an immensely superb experience. From having the best, (when i say the BEST i do mean it) buffet in town. 
Starting from the ambiance, dim yellow light, cozy seats, now that certainly has to be romantic. 
With very warm people, and great service, always asking for a review about the food. Any complains and they will make sure you get a better one just in 2 mins. Starting from the lovely crispy sweet corns which just kicks your taste buds and makes it ask for more of it. The alluring mushrooms kebabs are terrific. The parsley fish, ahhh just goes in your mouth and melts.. Chicken mutton and what not, and the Prawn (its like the oh my god), is lovely, just stays there on your taste buds forever. 
The lovely lovely lemon grass chicken soup is like the devil, you'll want more and more. Always ask for the soup with your starters though. 
Coming to the main course, a huge lay out. Lovely light mutton biryani with perfectly cooked mutton. Variety of salads and some with lots and lots of mayonnaise is just wow. 
After the kebabs i don't think you would be able to enjoy the main course much, but then take your time and indulge into it. 
And then you just dont wanna miss the sinful desserts, would you? With the caramel custard and the mud pies, the mini phirnis and gulaab jaamun, ohh and the mousse, its just goes on.

This is a awesome place for any kebab lovers. Here you will surely get the best buffet in town.
Everything bit of it is awesome:
> Food
> Ambiance
> Serving
> Behavior

Various types of mouth watering endless kebabs are really the best thing in Barbeque Nation. 
It is a place where your taste buds can't rest.

Personally I didn't like Firni of Barbeque Nation. :( (One bad thing if you ask about BBQ)

One best thing is waiters of Barbeque Nation don't take tips from customer. This is rare to find such a service in any restaurant. Barbeque Nation might cost high but it will give a ultimate smile to foodies after getting a hole in their pocket..:D

If there was any restaurant which could have got a 5 on 5 from me then this could have, would have, should have been it. With nice cool decors awesome food and all of them at great prices...the decor being slightly dim and the live chulha and the pirate of the Caribbean decor it stood out with a close chance also they used to serve a complimentary drink along with it...Even gave my birthday part here, went to birthday parties here and had an awesome time....From a flame and grill fan I changed to a barbeque nation one because of its wide spread which was what flame and grill used to have at one time...though I still believe flame and grill, South city mall had slightly better decor but then it was made up and crossed its benchmark with the huge buffet spread....
Sadly the buffet spread has shortened and shortened way too much for my liking......The corn has gone, the salad is not that great, the cauliflower roast is not there too, the chicken kebabs have come down to just the one, the mushroom kebab is not there anymore and the crab is neither...Now I have no reason to not go back to flame and grill again.
Though the waiters are very alert and they keep refilling without you having to ask them, they bring over their chef if you like their food too much to introduce him/her to you...
They also used to take suggestions now all that is gone...They have reduced the price and even made it confusing to add to the sad point of the reduced menu...I do not understand the logic....I wish they bring the things back on their menu and like start it all over again...I also missed my favourite mousse...I want that spread back without it it is just a 4 for me.
The sad part here is that they do not mix and match their menu but now there IS no menu...For all those of you who will be going now, you will never know what Barbeque Nation was....You can be happy with the existing spread though....
I wish somebody from zomato or somewhere can bring this to their notice that I want the buffet at Rs617 odd and the old menu not the new cheaper version with the lesser menu.

This place won't disappoint you and I can say that quite confidently for sure. To start off the ambience is very attractive and quite innovative and creative I would say. The design pattern is very interesting and unique. 
Yes the pricing is on the high side but for having a meal once a while is pretty ok I guess. Their Mediterranean cuisine is a must try, it will be new and refreshing to your taste buds. The european section is decent and the North Indian cuisine is well done.
The staff are sweet and friendly and always ready to welcome you with a smile. 
Overall I was highly satisfied with the food and service and hence rate it 4. I would definitely recommend you this place.

really impressive place with a great spread. the concept is great, food amazing and the pricing is pretty pocket-friendly too. a great spread of starters with awesome waiters serving. our sigree was never empty.. the prawn kebabs were really good and the tangri kebab was a clear winner. perhaps the sexiest legs in town ;)
didn't focus much on the main course, but the biriyani and mutton dakbunglow were great. the meat was really soft. the salads section have some scope for improvement.
then the dessert section was a perfect ending to the great meal. from firni, ice creams, gulab jamuns.. to almond cakes and pastries.. everything was on offer. a complimentary drink is also on offer and you have a choice from mocktails, lemonades and beer.
coming to the best part, this restaurant has a great early bid discount policy and it is quite easy to avail too. you just need to enter before 12-30 in the afternoon, which many buffet specialists do anyway. ;)
i will strongly recommend it to all and give a 5-point rating to the restaurant for being great in almost every field. all boxes checked, will definitely visit again :)

The restaurant that leaves nothing more to ask for.
There's a reason Barbeque Nation is the top restaurant according to this site.
Actually, there's more than one:
„ÄãThe food. Yes sir, this is, and I kid you not, the BEST buffet you'll get in town. The huge range of kebabs and other appetizers, which they'll keep bringing to your table till you turn a little flag on your table down, is certainly going to leave a lasting impression.  Not just kebabs; there are also dishes like griiled fish and crispy sweet corn they shall offer, and every single dish is worth tasting.
The main course is better than most places too. However, the biggest treat after the starters comes from the desserts table, with the most amazing choices laid out. From ice cream to nut pie to pineapple pastries, you shall be entertained all right.
„ÄãThe service. Yes, very few places deserve as much praise for extremely satisfying service. Our waiter (Tanmoy) deserves this mention for such great and friendly service.
„ÄãThe price. It cost 2 of us a total of 1236 (including taxes! ) for such an awesome experience. Also, most importantly, they do not accept tips! Yes, believe it!

Finally, the place is really spacious. Next time I'm coming at night, as they have live music too then.

Went there on a weekend.
Loved the good. Great quality.
I  liked the concept of live music and get to hear your favourite songs on request.
The ambience is amazing and its a great choice to go both with family and friends.
I went for a buffet dinner and they have a great variety!

The kebabs were the best out of everything ! A
nd in deserts don't miss those small Gulab Jamuns, trust me they are worth it !!

Definitely a must go. A high five from my side. Apart from the kebabs the main course is extremely tasty especially the mutton dak bunglow. And last but not the least the desserts are delicious. :)

My journey with Bbq Ntn started just a few days after it first opened few years back at a location opposite to the one currently now. At that time this concept was so new, the flags, the grill box in the table which attracted so many people and rightly so. The food was amazing and so was the service. After some time however the quality started to wane and my visits stopped altogether.

Switch to 2013: After lot of convincing by friends I visited this place again in its new location. It truly had returned to its past glory. The food was awesome, the service excellent and I was literally asked for my opinion after every new kabab hit the table. My fish kabab was slightly undercooked and it was something that brought the chef to my table with a new batch. Courtsey at the highest level indeed. The main course was a great supplement to the endless kababs as well.

A few tips for people going for the first time:

Option1: Eat everything you like in small quantities from kebab to main course to desert

Option2: Concentrate only on kababs!!!There are enough variations to complete the meal

Option3: Less kabas and main course and then maximizing the desert.

As you can see, endless options to enjoy yourself at this amazing place.

A highly recommendable place for foodies with a constricted budget!

The starters were exceptionally good and came in a variety, names which I cannot even recall. They started with corn which was delightful. My favorites were the fish (It just melts in one's mouth), prawn, Mutton Seekh Kebab, Garlic Fish, and not to forget the Mushroom preparation. There was a wide variety of main course including Dum Biriyani, mutton items etc. There was a Chicken Salad which was yum! But I was too full with the starters and could not risk missing the dessert, which was the best part! There is probably more than one can choose from...starting from Brownies to Firni, Ice Cream, Fresh Fruits, Fruit Custard and Lemon Cheesecake. And all were good. The Kiwi Sundae was surprisingly an uncommon item, good to taste. In fact I don't think I could complain about any of the food items except for the Gulab Jamuns which were a little too sweet. 

The ambiance is a fusion of traditional and modern times. I found the sitting area to be very cozy. The stage area is an attraction and I would suggest they come up with a karaoke contest soon!!

Service was extraordinary. In fact the chef came to our table for feedback after we sent back the tandoori. After noting down my complaint (the tandoori wasn't soft to my liking), he sent the item to our table after preparing it specially for me. And then re-checked with us. The staff were very organized and prompt.

Oh and I almost forgot the "aam-panna" which was complimentary and kept us craving for more than just 1.

I am recommending this place to all my friends...and am hoping to relive this the next time I visit Barbeque Nation.

Cheers!

One of the best buffet we had in Kolkata. The starters were very good. Also a huge range of desserts was available. 
I have been visiting this place at least 2-3 times for past couple of years. I still remember being taken aback by their no tip policy which I admired.

But over the years things have definitely deteriorated. For example if you take a non veg platter they would deny dhai ke panje a signature dish for vegetarians.

first of the ambiance is great at this place with live music in the background and comfortable seats...and now the most important thing ie the food is just brilliant....every day they have a nice collection of starters including tangri kebabs,prawns,fish,american corn,mutton kebabs etc.....u can sit back relax with ur friends maybe take a drink or two and enjoy a nice conversation and hot kebabs served on the grills in front of u.and each day u will also get a signature dish of teh chef who will come and ask for ur suggestions as well..after u are done with the starters then move on,with a heavy stomach ,to the main course buffet .... that day we had a nice collection which included mutton biryani,fish in mustard sauce,chicken curry,normal rice,tadka,panner etc.the taste was decent..after fighting your way through this u reach the final destination that is the deserts...from cheese cake to fruit custard,from ice cream and brownie till pineapple pastry and gulab jamum everything was there and all of them were good....overall the service was good but sometimes the waiters seemed inattentive but no worries its a good time to have a gala time with friends and family must visit i must say...and the best thing its not that heavy on the pocket even for FOODIES like me

On 5th June 2013 we went for a dinner.It was our first visit.Our Observations are 1) Fish starter was perfect.Prawn was nice and soft also well cooked. Chicken was ok. sweet corn was good.
2) Main course- Biriyani was wonderful, Mutton was soft and very tasty.Salads need to be developed. BEST  PART IS  THE Desert. Just W O W. best combination I ever tried. Comparing with Flame & Grill........Barbeque Nation is the best. 

Staffs are well mannered and very helpful.  Ambiance was nice. Carry on this standard.

I have visited them twice - both for Dinner after 9 PM. Compared to restaurants serving the same fare ( Sigree, Flame & Grill), they are way ahead in terms of the choices, quality of food, service and therefore the VFM (Value for money). Compared to most other restaurants, even compared to the restaurants in Taj and Park, the service is way way ahead. They have really trained the Waiters how to be courteous and attentive while imparting knowledge on what is available. Almost all restaurants should learn and try to ape the service levels here.
The starters are wide and the best part is you can have them customized (less spicy, more spicy, with different sauce/flavor, made-for-a-child, etc). Even if you opt for the non-veg option, you can also have many veg items ( including pineapple, mushroom, etc). Just request the waiter and they will be delighted to offer the customized dishes. The Chef also does visit to find out if you are enjoying the food.
The main course (if there is any space in your stomach by then) is varied though a tad underpowered. The desserts are just yummy.
And after all that food and the heavenly service, they say that service charge is included and so they do not accept tips !!
When live music is played, you can send your request of songs and they play them delighfully !!
I have visited all these Barbeque joints and Barbeque Nation is way ahead. Kudos and do keep re-inventing !!

When this place came up, it started out as some sort of a pioneer, And it probably still continues to be the same. I have been here twice and loved it on both occasions. The buffet is really very good with a good choice of starters, very decent main course. But what sets this place apart is an amazing array of desserts to choose from - Strawberry cheesecakes and brownies and ice-creams and sweets. I am a dessert person and rarely do restaurants serve buffets that have a good final course. 
The drinks menu is pretty decent too.
And the live karaoke is very very good !
Thumbs up to this place !!

I was taken here by my sister and brother-in-law and omg I loved the place. Since my brother-in-law knew I am a big foodie he knew treating me here would be an ultimate thing. The whole non-veg buffet was amazing. Tried out all that given. Service was very good and the chef personally had come to ask whether the food and the quality was good or not. The answer was yes. 

Then we had shifted to the desert section and had Gulam Jamun, Custard, Cake etc and it was amazingly delicious. What I loved best about the place was the live music where the singers were singing English country songs, the ones that are my favourite. 

So in short I loved this place.

Being a kabab-lover this has always been a special place of fascination for me. In course of my ventures through the yummilicious dishes (and not to mention the essence) of this amazing restaurant, i have found this to be better than any other kabab-buffets of this city. And if can be entered before 12.30, I think even a fellow having low appetite like me will have his money's worth in return of the food. The desserts are also delicious (especially the gulabjamuns, the ice cream and the pastries). 
     Speaking in general, the main course foods have just been touched by me only a couple of ocassions,bt tasted really wonderful to go along with all the items those came before THE FLAG WAS DOWN :P .
    The chefs come twice or thrice in course of your eating to take reviews and the "ITEM OF THE DAY" that they provide is just awesomeeee :D :D 
   In a nutshell, the reason behind me giving this a perfect 5/5 rating can only be understood after experiencing its ecstacy :)

Step inside this place and you will be greeted by the smiling waiters, beautiful ambience, live music and an instant feeling that you are going to have a gala time eating out here. The waiter places the live grill, and you begin. The unlimited kebabs come on the live grill and some of them (chicken tengri kebab, some Shark kebab, mutton, sweet corn) are served on your plate, and all of them are mind-blowing. By the time you are almost full, you remember that there is the main course and an awesome platter of desserts waiting for you. The main course is nothing special, but the desserts platter is a bliss. Service is excellent.

If the waiters are informed that it is your birthday, they instantly arrange for a sweet cake and the singer out there dedicates the "Happy Birthday" song to you. 

Extremely satisfying experience every time I visit this place. Cheers! :)

If you love kebabs, and have an hours time, go and enjoy.
Have been there with friends multiple times. Most of the time, we ended up skipping the main section and continue having the kebabs. Veg guys also get some kebabs, but well, if you are not having chicken, mutton, fish & pron, what are you going to have on a kebab day?

But the only pinch is the price. The food, services and the ambience dazzle you, but they sure cost you much. This restaurant is recommended only if the budget is appreciable.

My hubby took me to barbeque nation for dinner on my birthday. Food quality, ambience is awesome. I am mad with non-veg foods so we just had non-veg starters. As we didnt had the veg starters, they prepare seperately a mutton starters and served us. When my husband secretly informed them about my birthday, on the spot they arrange a small cake with a candle. Not only on my birthday, I also visited with my office colleague for lunch and we got the same attention like-manager and chef indiviually came in to take the feedback. Most of the time, you will notice, waiters eagerly wait to get tips from the customer but here they will not take any tips as well.

Starters are excellent. Kakori, galauti and what-not kebabs jostle for your mouth until you are full. Then you move on to the main course which is cooked in a kitchen with glass walls for you to see how clean and hygienic your food is. Main course is mediocre though. 

                                                 And at last you move on to the dessert section which is another mind boggling experience. Good ambiance and great starters and desserts made my day.  :D

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to kolkatans!


Have rated it so high due to the following reasons.

FOOD: Unlimited variety of kebabs under one roof. Apart from the live grill, they serve you other kebab dishes on your table as well. Though the food was a little spicy for me, I enjoyed the corn, the chicken kebabs and grilled garlic prawn.  The main course had a lot of variety too....DESERTS were awesome....starting from mud cake, choco brownie, firni, ice cream,gulab jamun etc etc

AMBIANCE: Live music played by someone...its really nice to see something different they have tried to put up. The place is spacious and located in a very convenient spot at sec v.

PRICE: Early bird discount policy....Cost varies from weekdays to weekends.
Visit before 7.30 pm to get a discount. Don't remember the exact cost...but it was somewhere around rs 650 including taxes (Sunday dinner before 7.30 pm)

SERVICE: Excellent, N no of waiters is the biggest plus point..they were extremely polite, prompt and kept taking feedback from time to time. The chef particularly took our feedback and since i told him that the food was a little spicy for me, He specially arranged for a dish named fried ice cream balls. 

Wishing them ALL THE BEST! Keep up the good service.

Pros- Food Quality
         Ambiance(They also have live music on sat&sunday nights)
         Service
         And,of courese the varieties of food available to dig into.
Cons-Well I could not find any :p :)
                                                  Surely one of the best buffet available in the city at this price. The people here are really welcoming and well behaved and the head chef here comes and visits all the tables ask for a suggestions and is the food nice,which is really nice.And on our last visit he also prepared us a special prawn which is one of the best prawns I have ever had.
And now coming to the food, they provide you with about 10- 12 types of kebabs,and each of them are amazing.They also provide you with 3 types of marinates and 4 types of sauces with the kebabs.You also do have a option for soups here. And in the main course you will be having one mutton,one chicken and one fish dish along with a mutton Dum Biryani,nuns,roti's,non-veg salads and more.And if you want more one can also have the foods from the veg section. And after all this you are left with the desserts and after seeing the section one can fall down after having all this amazing foods. Here will be having 8 types of desserts which are Phirni,Vanilla Ice cream with 3 types of sauce,Pineapple cake, Frozen Pudding,Cheesecake,Gulabjamun,Brownie,a Indian Sweet. And all this at price of 620 at Sat&Sun nights which is almost like a sale and a paradise for food lovers.   One which surely be on Cloud Nine after visiting this place :)

1.Live chulha
2.Flag system
3.Colour coded skewers,red for nv,green for vegetarian
4.Complimentary welcome drink in the afternoon
5.Early bird policy
6.Zero tipping
Food is just out of the world!You'll get Australian to Thai to Japanese to Mediterranean to Persian every cuisine in one buffet!
Biryani and angoori gulab jamun are classy!
And unlimited chicken,mutton,prawns,crab and fish kebabs! what more do you want,rush to this place for a once in a lifetime experience!

Visited the restaurant a couple of years back 

Heard about the restaurant from my cousin brother.
A restaurant is a must visit one if u love kebabs.
It was something about Rs450 few years back and one should invest only on kebabs,the main course is not that good the Biriyani sucks to the core but the kebabs cover it all and it's unlimited
The best time to visit the restaurant is when one is very hungry and during winters so one can invest on more and more kebabs

frankly speaking i'm a student with no money of my own and me always wasting my father's hard earned money on useless things like food beverages games and parties all the time.
ahhhh one more thing that i forgot to mention is that i love cricket like hell and therefore spent a lot on cricket matches and this character of mine is known by all. 
I'm the biggest fan of KKR may be in the world.
Therefore when last year KKR won the trophy marvelously all my friends demanded for a grand treat for the spectacular win.
As soon as i came to know about this i was thinking of giving them a treat in some hotel or dhaba which can be frequently seen on the roadside. While browsing the net for some reasonable restaurant for treat i came across zomato's BARBEQUE NATION and as a result i immediately informed my friends and soon a day was fixed for the grand treat to be given by me.
And the day came when i along with all my friends went to the restaurant and have our seats anxiously.
The inside of the restaurant was a grandeur and iconic in itself. 
I was fascinated  by the interior decoration and the planning of the restaurant.As we got comfortable we got the menu cards which we turned into to look out the various food items available at that restaurant.
Then one by one ordered our choice of food like i did a mutton dum biryani.
two of my friends ordered for  steamed rice and mutton dak bangla and there were one vegie who ordered Indian Grill Veg and Phaldari Kebab.
The moment the food arrived and the aroma reached my nostrils water started coming out of my mouth.
Slowly and steadily we enjoyed the food and closing my eyes we ate and ate and ate. The food on the plate ended before it even started i felt .
It was one of the best food i have tasted in recent times .
thereafter we ordered for the desert and in the desert was two chocolate brownie one cassata pastry and one ice cream.
 We ate to our hearts delight.

I have visited this place many times since its very near to my office. The starters are really good and they serve variety each day.
The deserts are also very nice.
What I do not like that much is the main course. I know most of the people go there to savour the unlimited starters. But the Main course is almost same over the time, at least I have found it so all the times i have visited this place over 2.5 years. The same restaurant in Bangalore, which I visited twice serves very big size crabs for main course and there sweet dishes also have many more varieties.
I would rate it 4.

If one were to ask which restaurant we would like to treat a large group at my option would single handedly be barbecue nation(of course it is priced bit on the higher side but if it is an important occassion and budget is not a big constraint would still like to consider this).
What makes dining an experience is their superb levels of service.Repeated without end the starters are good enough to fill you up.Of course for regulars some variety would be good.
Main course is regular bit the biriyani is loved by many though I personally hardly taste any main course since I need to have the desserts.
The gulab jamun is nice but best is firni.I find their icecream bit too sweet.
Wish the live music that goes on there could be softer but overall it's one placemakes u I 'm always ready to visit since it makes us all very happy and contended.

Okay, this is the thing. I cannot believe I have not reviewed this place till now. I have to say, I have been here, mostly with my best friend, countless times (because we were both incredibly frustrated with our jobs and wanted to kill someone, preferably ourselves, by overeating), and I am yet to find a time when this place has not delivered great food. 

The best thing about this place is the fact that they will give you kababs  till you throw down the gauntlet, rather flag, literally, signalling for them to stop!! And I love the way they would come and charge you for the food, and nothing else, and yes, if you tell them what you want and what you dont, they remember each part of it. 

the only place I would like them to improve slightly, would be in making slightly better biryani. It is inconsistent in its taste.. some days its GREAT and some days its just about meh. 

My other favorite, apart from the kababs, is definitely going to be the desserts. These guys keep this HUGE array of desserts and I love the fact that they do not skimp on it. And they also have beer!! (winner!!). 

So well, yes, if you are like me, and want Really Good Food, without frills, then this should be the place to go to.

This is my 2nd time here and first time with my wife. As usual, this place is excelent & being here is like an amusement to a food lover. We took the Lunch (for Rs 495/-), and it was a fabulous time with all their starters (10-12 types of Kebabs & frys), Main course (couldn't count) and finally Desserts(8 types).
All the dishes were nice & tasty, Specially my wife got delighted when she explored the dessert section. Kebabs were excelent. We couldn't eat enough the Main course items bcoz we were almost full with the kebabs.
The ambiance is very good, Waiters were courteous and so helpful, Food is excelent......what else do you want!!!
Best place for buffet..in the city.



----- 18 May, 2012 -----

I and my Lab colleagues  Visited BBQ Nation last Thursday (17/5/12). It was a B,day treat.
The food was very good. Ambiance was excellent and the concept of Buffet (We had Lunch there) was brilliant.
I liked the food very much specially the kebabs, Salads, Biriyani & the dessert section. Lunch buffet costs Rs 485/- (non-veg) per head.
"No one can eat just Once"....I want to visit this place again & again...!

If you've been here, you will probably have gorged on lots and lots and lots of kebabs. Yes, in a city full of buffet platters, a place like Barbeque Nation brings you beautifully conceptualized kebabs for as long as you can eat. What I also love about their buffet is their desserts: I think their buffet is the best one in terms of desserts in the whole of the city! :D Also worth a try are their biriyani and their salads,specially if you are a salad junkie!
Now, about their a-la-carte. I really love some of their dishes: their continental fare is surprisingly good and their flavours are always fresh and strong. I'm a big soup fan,so I always like to try their soups. Quantity of food is pretty good.

As if the owners knew how popular this place was gonna be,they made sure its built over a large area to ensure comfortable seating! I love how they serve kebabs. In general,their service is great and theyre quite attentive to clients.

Another plus point is the location. People who dont stay in the heart of the city have to travel all the way to park street to eat good food like this. But now things have changed and there's places like these that really beat all others. Worth a visit, no matter where in Kolkata you stay. :)

I don't know how many other people have rated this restaurant below 5! This place deserves a perfect 5 on 5!!
We went for lunch today. From 12-12.30 the rate is 485 for non-veg buffet and an extra 6 rs if you want to have the veg items too! When you enter you are greeted with a complimentary drink like aam panna.any soft drink,and even kingfisher's beer! God knows how they manage to give a 150-200 worth beer at that buffet price! And,when they asked how my aam panna was,I told it was a bit too sweet,they told me I could have another drink of my choice! I took a fanta,and even after that they didn't take away the aam panna from the table!
Each table has grills so that the kebabs remain warm. You are served with 5 veg kababs like grilled veggie,paneer,mushroom and the cajun-spiced potato which are good. Fish kebabs,which I found the most tasty,prawn kebabs,chicken and chicken legs,mutton seekh kabab(Wow!)! The sevice is excellent and they ask you for refills every 30 seconds! The manager,the waiters,and even the chef,come and ask you how you are liking it and if you wanna suggest anything! I knew from the chef that the fish was basa,imported from Vietnam! We got a special grilled fish too which was only for today! 
Now,after finishing about 12 types of kebabs in unlimited helpings,you can take rest for sometime or head over to the main course. (Self-service in the main course and desserts) Chicken sweet corn soup and a tomato soup starts the buffet. There's mutton dum biryani,which tastes better than arsalan's,then there's two types of chicken,paneer,prawn,mutton gosht! You can take roti's or nuns too by asking at your table. There's a raita,a pasta salad,egg salad. You can also have veg dum biryani,some tasty gobi,some green paneer! And there maybe other things which I can't remember! Take as much time as you can,relish the flavours and please praise the authorities!
Now for pleasing your sweet tooth! 8 dessets waiting to seduct you! Butterscotch cake,firnis,truffles,a tart,brownies(if hot it would have been better),vanilla ice cream with 3 types of toppings,and cute melt-in-the-mouth hot gulabjamoons!
We took two hours to eat and filled in as much as we could! Now,for the bill! For two,it was Rs. 982 inclusive of taxes! When we left Rs. 50 for tips,the manager happily returned that saying the waiters already get paid and they won't take extra money!!! With this,we said goodbye!
They had given a response sheet and I wrote the best of words for them. Even then I felt it was not enough. The way they had treated us,giving so much respect,being so sweet and hospitable,I have never seen 10% of this behaviour in any restaurant till now. The fact that they refused a tip earne them so much more respect! When we asked how do they manage everything at such a low price,they told that as we are happy,we are sure to come back. And they are right! Today onwards,anybody who asks for a place to eat I'll recommend them The Barbeque nation and I ll also go there as frequently as possible! You know,their mere behaviour costs so much in today's world! I was feeling so damn pleased I wished to hug everybody while leaving! So,for the best food and the bestest hospitality without hurting your pocket,do visit the Barbeque nation and come out the happiest person on earth! :-)

what do you want in a restaurant? good food?plenty quantity?delicious variety?good service?nice ambience? you will find everythng in dis place from the moment you step in. yesterday i went there to have my anniversary lunch there and it was my first time, but i was pretty keen on trying dis since i heard so many good reviews. the veg as well non veg kebabs, the starters came coming and it took me near about 45 minutes to let it go. it was so delicious. they had 4 kinds of rice but i was so full that i could take pinches from every dish. i personally liked the oozy rice. the veg soup had such good balance and the raita was absolutely refreshing. little spicy, sour and some herbs made it refreshing. but what makes you ga-ga is the dessert spread. fruit custard, cheesecake, fruits, simmering gulab jamuns, mistis...if you leave any, including the ice cream, you are missing a lot. we were also served a cake from their side, special dishes like orange tarts and one more dish which had fried icecream and strawberry sauce. they do make you feel special. and their constant questions whether you need something or whether there is any suggestion is a quality to look forward to. it deserves the 5 on 5 rating!

We had been to BBQ's nation for our team birthday celebration party. It was really outstanding. The barbequed chicken, prawn and that potato with mayonnaise sauce was stunning. As we are a team of 18, but they managed superbly. We had buffet. It was indeed a day to remember. Thnx for the awesome taste. Keep up the good work.

Never ever have i been dissapointed by this resturant! Never! I visited it last month and was served for the first time ever, real crab kebabs. It was just awesome. The unlimited in flow of kebabs makes my day! The music is nice too, as the guy who plays there has a good set of songs under his sleeves. Foodwise their biriyani is awesome and their mutton is as soft as cotton. 
Barbeque Nation is for the times you feel like you could eat a horse. A BIG LIKE for Barbeque Nation. I have often twon parties here and have also brought people here. I make it a point to visit this resturant once every month.

Awesome experience. I am a vegetarian and I hv never been to a restaurant that has this many delicious veg dishes to offer; and all of that within an affordable buffet rate. About the non-veg dishes I would say it must be awesome too because all of my friends love it!

Ambience is good and behavior of the waiters is too good. Once I got a complimentary dish of sweets merely because I had politely commented that "the babycorn was overcooked".

My only complain which can be easily ignored by others is regarding the veg main course. The items are not MY favorite.

Well you need a special place for a special occasion & that's exactly what we found in Barbeque Nation (saltlake). I tied the knot a few days back and me and my wife wanted to throw a dinner for our closest friends. 

1: Mr.Ali who took our appointment on behalf of Barbeque Nation was extremely helpful. He actually took notes as to our requirements and needs ,providing inputs which helped us plan the dinner & to top it up on the day the dinner. He made it a point to call and touch base. This kinda hospitality is really rare here in restaurants around kolkata which really touched us.

2. Once we all were at the venue, we were introduced to a chap called Mr.Abhijeet who made sure we get the best of service who was always around keeping track of our needs and which was really touching was even though all the tables were full,the service is excellent. Not once we had to wait for our orders or our drinks. Must say the staff is brilliant out here as they worked with such finesse and execution to meet each order of ours with always a smile on their face and extremely attentive making sure to meet our needs.

3: Another striking feature was, the staff actually passed on the word to the karaoke duo who actually dedicated numbers to me and my wife which was very special. Normally the guests only go and dedicate, out here they made sure the finer details are taken care of making sure our night was special and we as guests felt pampered to the hilt.

4: In terms of food we were spoilt for choice, the quality ,the taste and the choices galore that were an offer is simply intoxicating for foodies like us. The ambiance with its warm lighting and hospitality made us feel at home. Not for once did any of our guests and us included we felt out of place. It was as if we were in our home itself ,such warm was the hospitality and vibe of this place.

5: One of the factors that stood out was when being it our special occasion and we were overwhelmed with the service we got, we wanted to give a tip as a token of appreciation, but it was returned with a smile and informing us that service taxes were included in the bill. This kinda service and staff with such warm is literally extinct in kolkata.

6: Not only us,but our guests also thanked the people managing our table for such a lovely experience we had, 

I must say thanks to Zomato, for having this place on its card, else we would end up with something far less satisfying, Barbeque Nation is definitely a place to celebrate your special occasions because here one doesn't just relish the mouth watering & juiciest kebabs in town but also you get to make some epic memories with your loved ones...THANKS, ZOMATO, THANKS BARBEQUE NATION & ITS STAFF... ,

One should head for Barbeque Nation- at Salt Lake, Sector V- for all things grilled and to sample their mix of Mediterranean, European and Indian cuisine. The moment you enter the restaurant you are greeted with a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' inspired decor. The waiters are not only adept in serving food but will also entertain you with a well rehearsed dance performance. In the evening there is also a live band to serenade you with classic English songs.
The starters are a meal in itself; once you start you just can't stop yourself. At the same time the service is such that they do believe in indulging their customers with refills and refills of delicious Korean prawn, Punjabi tangri and the lightly flavored parsley fish. The vegetarians need not feel disheartened. One should try their Cajun spice potato, a mildly hot dish that suits the Indian palate very well. The malai paneer tikka is to die for. The good old phaldari kebab that is usually reserved for the monsoons should not be missed. 
After the starters, the main course can be overlooked. But it will be an incomplete experience. The main course is a mix of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. From soft and juicy mutton dishes to khoya mutter , aloo capsicum dry- just to name a few- there is no dearth of food items on offer. For the more adventurous, try some squid dishes and the sea weed soup which are on offer on certain days only.
If there is any place left in the stomach after their lip-smacking starters and the main course, the desserts should also find a place in your stomach. In this section too, one is spoiled for choice. One can take one's pick from the list of sinful delights like the cassata pastry, angoori gulab jamun, ice cream - vanilla or chocolate, fruit cake, phirnee . For the sweet-toothed there is definitely no end to the evening or lunch whenever you choose to drop in to sample their food.
Barbeque Nation certainly ticks all the right boxes when it comes to food, service and ambiance. Delights of all kinds from the food to the sea-life inspired decor are to be found here. One does not have to burn a big hole in one's pocket to have such an experience.

To put it simply, best place to have kebabs. The variety is really pleasing. The concept is catchy (you ge to grill your kebabs right on your table). One thing that I must mention is that hospitality is awesome, they literally pamper you. About the buffet that follows barring a few items it needs to improve the taste of lot. Dessert again is awesome. Go there if you want to be spoilt for choice. The 613 bucks is money well spent.

You want a buffet meal in Kolkata??? You want some quality north indian food?? You are a kebab fan??
Trust me.."THIS IS THE PLACE"...
If u ask me..this place has got the best north indian kebabs in town..loads of variety and the best of taste..makes this place the perfect one...
1stly a warning..DO NOT go to Barbeque nation  if you are dieting..coz trust me you wont be able to resist..
All the kebabs are equally good and mouth watering..and plus you have varieties in a dips/chutneys as well..
Rest of the main course and desserts were also very good and had great options..but actually the kebabs were so good..i think i can overlook the little "glitch" that the main couse might have..
The ambience and the service was excellent too...
My friend didnot like the mutton kebab that was served..bt the chef was upto it immediately and had a separate special mutton dish prepared for us..which was really a nice gesture..
Overall i would say its really worth every penny..go before 12:30 and they have d best prices..
Will be there soon!!:):)

This was an awesome place when it was first landed to Kolkata. I was always interested to hit this place...

The best Buffet in town... The choice of dishes... wow

but now.... I will not rate it even 4.. !

A place named BBQ nation should be something as it sounds...

You will get the same cost saving kababs.... no speciality one's..

Then come's the eating competition... I just dont like that...

The Desserts are just awesome.. so expect that nice everyday... 

I will suggest , if you can eat a lot... & want to eat a good buffet... hit this place...

I can bet , in terms of buffet, they are still chart toppers...

Excellent starters. Great service.
Ambience: It is a huge place perfect for a family gathering or an office party (well they have these regularly owing to their location) or a birthday treat. yet the seating arrangement ( and the buffet spread and also the service) is so versatile that the odd couple will not feel left out amidst the crowd. They also play live music in the evening. But I have to say I still miss their previous location...
Service: A foodie is not only the one who loves to eat but also the one who loves to cook for and feed their guests. And this place I feel loves to feed their guests. The starters are served by the waiters who are very prompt, efficient and cordial. And I'll say the same about the management. So thank you Barbeque Nation!
Food: The starters especially the kebabs are awesome. More so if you use the different chutneys they provide to brush your kebabs with during the on-your-table grilling process. Yeah I know it's hard to resist the temptation, but do grill the kebabs a bit and brush them with the chutneys provided before you pop them in your mouth! For the buffet spread, I'm sorry to say I find it pretty ordinary except for the hot gulab jamuns or the li'l cakes or the ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert but I'm not at all complaining.
Recommendations: Well I highly recommend the Barbeque Nation Experience for every foodie and even to the non-foodies...the way they place the hot charcoal grill in the centre of the table still blows my mind, even after 20 or so  odd visits!

 " lovely attention to each and every persons, super tasty food, was over- flowed with their service, best class service - beyond imagination....."

Great place, and one of the best buffets in town. The Kebabs are awesome, served fast on table. The variety of kebabs and desserts are really impressive. The only thing that marks it down is the main course which is very basic. The service and ambiance is also great. In short, if you love kebabs, this place is for you...and you'll get good desserts as well. and at this price, its even good value.

An ideal place to visit in case you want to eat to your heart's content. The buffet is simply mind blowing. Every table has a flag, and unless you set it down, they would keep serving you. I never could go beyond the starters - mainly the kebabs, and the fish delicacies. If you can reach beyond the starters, the phirni and other desserts are also recommended!

This is the place to go if you love kababs or if you want to eat variety of food. The starters are of wide range and so are desserts. Overall the food is good. The price is bit on the higher side. So if you are going to treat a large group of people (e.g. team lunch etc), you need to keep tab on the expense. You get a discount on the lunch buffet if you go by 12:30pm.

A great place to dine out my mom is a vegetarian hence when she complained about the taste of the kebabs they replaced it with the better ones. It's a nice place and the live music gives it a great ambiance. A must visit!!

So they place this small charcoal grill in the center and they keep on refilling with the juiciest and succulent kebabs around. It's really hard to decide when to actually stop. If the chef was the father and the food his children, then the kebabs were definitely the spoiled brats. After a much debated discussion with my friends we decide we have had enough and move on to the main course. My hopes are high and I am really looking forward to the next part of the journey. I take my time and decide to go for something simple .They could have given us more options. Back at the table I feel as if the energy that was in the cuisine had somehow vanished. It was like the person you feel in love with, now you find is just like other regular folks. We agree that the name of the restaurant is justified. They have excellent barbecues but unfortunately that's about it.
Feeling that the real 'experience' was over we headed over to conclude our meal. Scooping up ice cream like an 11-year old boy suffering from malnutrition, my eye caught sight of the lustrous syrup. I always did prefer extra sauce. And there's these cute looking orange blocks mated to these creams. Mango cheese cakes they said.
We weren't expecting much but boy were we in for a big surprise. The simple ice cream tasted really good and the Mango Cheesecakes, ohh! were heavenly. I loved the cakes so much that my ice cream had melted and its fun making abstract art with the chocolate syrup. There was no doubt that we were going to go for second helpings, perhaps even a third. I couldn't decide how many Mango Cheesecakes I could stuff myself with.
The taste was still lingering by the time we got the bill. They deserved a healthy tip which they politely refused.
Now for the other aspects - the ambiance was satisfactory and the service was really good.
apart from the main course, our taste buds were thoroughly entertained. So it deserves a 4.

Excellent place! The food, the service, the ambiance - I love everything here.

The chicken kebabs here are one of the softest and juiciest I ever had and they are among those few places who make tasty Sheek Kebabs. Unlike most places they don't make it over spicy. Though kebabs are their main attraction, the buffet menu is equally tasty. But apart from the kebabs, their best part is the dessert section. You will regret if you have eaten too much kebabs.

Service here is excellent. Friendly, fast and attentive. Also complete value for money.

I have seen other places where service charge is included in the bill, but if you leave additional tip they just keep it. Here if you tip they will return the money politely and let you know that service charge is included in the bill. A five star from me!

Nice place to go and eat if you are a kabab fan ... the grill in the centre of the table is fun !!! the starters are good .. the staff behaviour is excellent ... thats the 'wow' factor here !!! But still i am giving it a 3 because they lack variety .. they should introduce more variety in the main course which is very average ...

Awesome place... and a must go if you are a foodie and stay in Calcutta.

The place has a wonderful ambiance, the staff are welcoming and polite and the way they make you comfortable and welcomed is something so places in Calcutta could take a lesson or two from. The kebabs which are served at your table AND served till you drop dead or put the flag down. Believe me your mind would never want you to put the flag down but your poor stomach can just eat so much.

The main course is a lavish spread, but I hardly ate anything after all those kebabs that went down. The desserts are wonderful too! I wish I could eat more than what I can generally eat - but that is just me - there are some who are really big eaters and this is the place to be for them. And yes, do remember to ask for the mutton kebab which they do not have on the go for some reason.

I wish they saved the brain from so much math with all those confusing timings and prices. I am sure they are doing good business to stop these "price brackets".

Another thing they should do is start serving complimentary soft drinks. I am sure that would not be so much of a dent in their profits (and if people drink more they eat less too :-) )

They should just have 2 price brackets - Veg and Non Veg and everything should be included (unless you ORDER something off the wine list etc.)

A brilliant place for Kababs and if you can make it before 12.30 you get a buffet for lesser price! Really nice place and waiters almost beg you to have more!! :) I took buffet and I loved all their Kababs. Fish Kababs especially were extraordinary! The main course was very good with lots of options! You can also tell them to bring roti/naan and they will serve it to you hot! And the options for dessert were amazing! Their firni comes in tiny earthen pots, and they are very very tasty!! Also they give you complementary beer! :)) A must try for Kabab lovers!

One of the finest places to celebrate with loved ones. Went on X-mas, though had to wait for half an hour but the kebabs are amazing, the chefs ensures eachieved quest has a delightful experience, even when I pointed that kebabs seems a bit oily, the Executive chef ensured I am served with kebabs to suit my palate. Would recommend this place anyday

This place is a real Haven for all foodies and specially the Kebab lovers. Visited this place a few months ago. Got surprised from the very beginning with their reception which was really hearty and worm. 
after we settle down starters were began to come in a unstoppable manner. there were 5 veg and 5 non veg starters and all were mind blowing delicious. most of the starters were kebab items and really mouthwatering. The starters were continued until we put the flag down on the table.All the staffs were awesome and well behaved and they were asking us for which one we preferred, even one crab item i didnt like and I told them as a result they made another type of special crab for me. which was a real good part.
ok the main course was really elaborate with soups, dal, mixed veg, polao, biriyani, chicken item , lamb item and fish besides all types of salad which was really really wonderful for the foodies. come to the last part which contains endless variety of cakes,pudings, firnies , ice creams, fruits etc.
The starters they will serve you at the table and they serve until we down the flag off. Then the main course you have to get yourself and which will never end. So its really a foodies paradise. 
Lets come to the price aspect which is quite ok as per the food quality and service for lunch we spent Rs.607 per head which is actually affordable for a place like BBQ nation.

A little PRELUDE- Before I went to this place I looked on the reviews written here. I formed the impression that it is a very nice place to eat out and how uptight are the people who had written  the negative reviews.
Upon visit, lo and behold those uptight people turned out to be correct.

The food is not good{in the buffet, have not tried the a la carte dishes} but the service  is mind blowing.
 Example- We found a piece of rubber band in the soup, and I complained about the tastelessness and how cold the starters(those that are not served in the tandoor) were.
   To make up for this they gave a host of complimentary stuff- a mock-tail and specially made starters.

But the bottom line remains, the main course was not good neither was the dessert.
 So, if you are looking for good food do not go here, but if you want to experience excellent service do visit this place.
 

PS- my rating is only for the service. I can not even think of rating the dismal food.

Went there in time for dinner buffet. Good food, nice ambiance, excellent, I repeat, excellent service. They offer you a really wide collection of starters. Not all of them are uniformly or consistently good (last time I found the mushroom and the fish kebabs to be the best but this time they were not so good and instead I liked the chicken and prawn the most) but still you will always find some you like. I didn't have much time (or space) for the main courses but the spread was reasonably OK and the mutton biryani was great. The desert section was also very good with brownies, ice cream and three sauces to choose from. I would have liked to see some mousse though.

Overall one of the best buffets in town and at 644 per head including taxes (before 7:30 P.M slot) a great value for money. I will give it 5 stars if

(a) They start offering complimentary drinks during dinner buffets
(b) Do away with their somewhat strange and confusing policy of charging different prices before and after 12:30 or 7:30 PM

A great place for a good dine out! The concept of finger licking good unlimited starters with a not so bad main course never seems to be out of fashion...ever.
You'll definitely like it if u have a huge appetite like me...or go 'the more the merrier way' with your whole gang.
The starters are fresh, the meat is succulent n just rightly done. Don miss d potato with yogurt on top or the prawns or the fish. Wat I adore is their cute table grill, nice n compact, keeps ur kebabs warm n lets u do them a little more if that's wat u want. Don bother on the main course too much..its not too better than average..but do try out the desserts.
If u're lucky u might just get to see the waiters dance, its a delight to watch. N u don have d reservation problem with the branch here like in bangalore..so Go n make d most of it.

I went with my colleagues  to BBQ Nation,kolkata last evening for dinner.

Though I am not new to Barbeque Nation,as was quite regular to the restaurant when was in bengaluru.We had ordered the Nonveg Buffet for 30 people this time.

Had a Very bad experience for the first time visiting Barbeque Nation in Kolkata.

To my disappointment , 2 of the starters chunk had Strands of Hair , and I had to show it to the table manager (Mrinal). The Sector V,Kolkata Branch manager was not available for comment.

The 2 Starters where hair was found :

1.Red Snapper
2.Cajun Fried Crispy Calamari

Despite such a good name, I really doubt on the food quality/standard maintained in the kitchen of Barbeque Nation.
Why I am putting this feedback over here, as their website http://www.barbeque-nation.com/ doesn't have a comment or feedback system like other food chains.

If there is no feedback how could they improve the quality of food...

I am a foodie and i just love this place, the prawn starters are out of the world and the potato cutlets with mayo sauce is amazing. What i also like is that they keep having these food festivals and adding new things.

They chefs are also considerate and they actually gave us a few more vegetarian options when one of friend asked for it.

and yeah not to forget the sweet dishes phirni and fruit cake and gulab jamun and icecream, well you end up missing the main course, straight from the starters to the desserts :) ...

This is the 2nd Babrbeque Nation I visited.. the first one being in Chennai.

I must say as most of the people will agree.. this place has its identity... which is truely unmatched. 

1. The quality is consistent.. same in both Chennai and Kolkata.
2. Service very efficient - One waiter for every grill
3. Very unique concept for putting live barbeque on the table for serving starters....
4. They probabaly serve the best and the most satisfying starters in the town... a grt value for money.

Its all great except a few small notes:

1. The prices are now soaring high.. specially weekend dinners
2. The main course has always been on the low side.


One good thing of Kolkata BBQ nation over chennai is.. it is much less crowded. U can simply walk in without booking on a weekend and u'll get places.

All in all... one which u cannot afford to miss..!!!

Different kind of Barbqued starters where you can give your personal touch is just awesome.At times you over eat starters as a result i have missed gorging on main courses. 

One thing is for sure if you want treat your friends, family where you dont think about quality and quantity, then you should surely visit this place.

To top it all you get a complimentary drink which acts as cherry on the top :)

Till now The best buffet i have visited.

lets start with the food. They have a very spread menu for starters. chicken kebabs,mutton kebabs, prawns ,fish. you can not just eat them all.their is a nice thing,that in every table there is a flag,when you feel that you are done with starters then you have to put that flag down and they will stop serving starters.

in main course there are at least 12 items to eat,but a normal fish curry doesn't go with other foods,which i did not like. But the biryani was awesome ,less oily and the mutton was well cooked.

In desserts their are ice cream,cream wayfers,pooding,brownies,ice cream with three options for sauce.I just loved their food.
Next come to the staffs, they are very well dressed and well mannered,but in case of many people they get really confused(i noticed this thing twice) which can be improved.
and the decoration,the environment the sitting arrangements,live music everything is just too good.This place is like heaven for foodies,i Will suggest everyone to try this place once.

pick your starters as you like them while its on the grill and you before you can ask them for a refill its already done. thats how the service is. they take the initiative and always wear a smile on their face.
special mention for the Pineapple Kebab if its on offer for the day.
Do keep space for the huge spread main course and desserts.
Note : They do not accept tips !

I visited BARBEQUE NATION for the first time on a friend's birthday. We had luckily found ourselves there when The Seafood Festival was on and as soon as we were seated the journey commenced, after starting with the humble chicken, fish and prawn kebabs with some Long Island Iced Tea to gulp it down with, we were deeper in the sea and were served squids, shark, octopus and I cannot even explain how amazing I found them to be..We had counted eleven sorts of kebabs and they were only starters. A lot of my friends in the group had stuffed themselves full with the assortment of kebabs and retired to desserts while the main course was pending. I found myself accompanied by only two other friends in a group of eight who were game for the main course.. I have only praises to shower on the Barbeque Nation..The environment is great, the service is great..Oh, yes and the desserts are bloody awesome...ENJOY

Just love the food here. Nice spread of Kebabs and Main course. Nice cheer around no matter what time you land up there.... only one problem... The place gets very noisy if people for nearby office, in big groups, and mostly stag start singing and dancing with the crooner. The management should discourage this and it becomes unbearable for other diners.

The ambiance and the decor is very nice.. I love the way the serve the starters on the grill on your table :D
It has a huge variety in its buffet section especially the vegetarian kebabs, more so because there are hardly any, at other buffet places. the main course and the desserts are awesome too. Although the buffet is priced slightly at a higher side ie around 600 per person, but every penny spent here is worth it :D

The place is very warm and welcoming. The service is very good. I remember telling the chef when he asked , how did I like the food that the babycorn was maybe cut into too small pieces n then fried and served. He immediately served ones that were perfectly proportionate with respect to the taste of the babycorn and the spicy crispy portion. Infact he brought it twice. All the starters were great especially the cajun spiced potato. The array of desserts was wonderful the pick of them being the out of world gulab jamun. My expectations were not so high being a vegetation. But it exceeded my expectation by providing more than what one could eat in one sitting. The main course was awesome too. But in between so many starters and deserts I could have little of the main course. The experience was the best I have ever had in any restaurant.

It's a very good place for people who like tandoor and grill. The food is very good. Perfect ambiance and wonderful service. When you start your meal, they would put the starter grill in front (this is not something new for poeple who have been to flame nd grill). They have a huge variety of starters..starting from fish, chicken, crabs, mutton, prawn. Most of the starters are wonderful. I also had the luck of trying the veg starters. The mushroom starters are excellent. Chicken tangri is good and so are the crabs and prawns. The best part.. have them as many as you want. Now coming to main course..they serve some good chicken salad. Biriyani is ok. The desert is a matchwinner. It is simply awsome. On the whole, if you are really hungry, this is definitely the place to go. Certainly the best restaurant in sector V area and that too by miles.

As usual with a buffet, you tend to eat a lot upfront and end up having no space for the rest. Barbeque Nation does not disappoint when it comes to the quality of food. Their starters are just about medium done and you can make them well done on the little tandoor provided at the table. The marinades and sauces just add to the experience and the taste. Don't go overboard with the starters since the spread is pretty impressive. You can also have a drink to wash down all that food. Not too expensive but even if you think it is, it's worth the cost. Go for it.

Had to wait a full 55 minutes before we could get a place..
Grill stuff and food galore... and tasty. For folks with abode in salt lake ,  
Normal meal = 350 Rs ( perfect place and not expensive for the array of things served)
special = 450 Rs ( with sea food ) + 1 bottle beer
Place is nicely built up. Food starts to disappear from wonderful place to go there with family and friends ..worth a try.. everything is available from shrimps to masala papads ! i would say you should visit this place once !

overall would rate it as 3.5

When my boyfriend discovered this place, I remember his emotions. It was like, why didn't I find this place before? For some personal issues I couldn't be a part his adventure and missed my date that day but was surely thrilled to hear out his experiences and I felt just the same when I myself had the boon to have lunch here with him.
The entire staff at the restaurant is extremely welcoming. I never had, in my life, a better server to wait on our table. 
The decor was very soothing. The sitting arrangements were very comfortable.
Coming to the food, there is absolutely no a-la-cart option here and all is buffet. This was the best buffet experience in my life. 
They start you with 5-6 non-veg (chicken, mutton, fish, prawn, crab) and 5 veg kebabs (Cajun spicy potato is a must try) which are amazing and of unlimited portions. To add more thrill to the joy the kebabs are placed in your table on a live chullah and if you're new to this concept then you're sure to love it. They have a flag down option which is to tell them to stop pamper you with kebabs and till you do so they're gonna keep coming back and fill you with your favorite ones. 
After the starters you'll feel almost full for sure and then will come the main course and the desserts. Both the main course and the dessert section is equally great. One can't afford to miss the hot Gulab Jamuns. They are just divine and even with a full stomach you will fell like eating a lots of those devils.
During lunch hours, they provide a welcome drink.
They've got an early bird policy, i.e., if you enter this place early and occupy your table then your bill is going cost less. Do check out the updated time schedule over phone before you decide to visit this gem.
On the weekends they also play live music during dinner.
Great value for money, a must must must visit place. If you still haven't found this place then go for it now.

What an amazing experience! Lip-smacking starters like Potato Calzone, Grilled Artichokes, Mushroom  Burgers, Pineapple,  Potato, Paneer... all on skewers! 
On the non-veg front, there were 2 types of chicken, a fish, a lamb (mutton) & prawn, all prepared on skewers as well. 
The sun n sand festival (which finished yesterday) was on, so there were live dance performances in addition to their everyday live-music performances which was a bit of a distraction, but the kids present in the restaurant seemed to enjoy it the most. 
The chef & the floor-manager personally asked people on every table whether everything was upto the standards, if there was anything that needed improvements? 
Since we were enjoying our experience and having praised the same to both of them, we received another 2 separate preparations at our table, compliments of the Chef! 

Dinner was also too-good a spread with usual regulars along with a few new additions (because of the sun 'n sand festival) like Creole Rice, Alomnd & Broccoli Soup, Cheese-Ball Curry etc. 
Absolutely love the place. 
Wish more such outlets opened in Kolkata!

I visited bbq-nation some time back and the ambiance, food, decor & staff courtesy were all great! The best thing about my experience of visiting this place was that I had gone on a Sunday & had reached at 6.30 p.m.. The gates of the restaurant were supposed to open only after 7.00 p.m. but the welcome staff were prompt enough to ask me for my number, and then had promptly called me as soon as the restaurant was open! They even held the table for me for 10 mins. 
I was happy to see them doing that for a guest on a Sunday, when they usually don't even take reservations. 
Most importantly, the food was great as well!

an  excellent  restaurant  located  in  salt  lake  ,  go for the buffet guys, yes endless  choice of kebabs plus  main course  & desserts  ,  ambience  is  breathtaking  more so  because  of the posh crowd  ,  no rowdies  here , only decent  people  .  try  and  ask for their  fish kebabs  & prawn  kebebs  with  green  chutney  .  once  you visit  you will  be hooked to this  place .  But  yes try not to  drink  too much here as alcoholic  drinks  can  be  a  bit costly , but  if  you are  a techie who  wants to  impress  his  GF/  Fiancee  ,  then definitely  take  her  to  this  place.  she will  say YES to your proposal even  before finishing the food .  that's  my guarantee  .  i would have given  it a  5  star but because of the cost of the alcoholic  drinks  i gave it 4.  i have just 1 request to the restaurant owners here , i.e please start  an ALCOHOLIC DRINKS BUFFET  ....  that is unlimited  alcohol  at a  certain  price , for example charge Rs 700 / person  & allow him/her   to have unlimited  alcohol  ( ALL POSH BRANDS Please   ) & see  how  this  restaurant generates  triple the business  it  is  doing  now  .  i ask this because many of mine techie friends have requested me to appeal this  to barbeque-nation

this place as usually rocks like the rest of the time. but during lunch hour if you can get a seat before 12.30 then you will have the entire food with the same menu for only 491 bucks and that too will come with a welcome drink. barbeque nation has it all.
i visited the place during their sun and sand fest and found out that the entire place has become a beach themed restaurant. apart from the decor, there was live music and a small dance from the in house stuffs. the food was also superb. and instead of only five non veg starters we were given seven including squid. and all this for 644 including the taxes is not too much. 
barbeque nation is worth it whether it's lunch or dinner. head over there as soon as you get the chance.

The best restaurant I've visited and the best experience I've had. The king of all restaurants. The menu, the irresistible kebabs and the endlessness of the same, the desserts, the soothing decor, the warm service and the lovely live music is sure to take your breath away. A bit expensive though but for the experience, it's value for money. I wanna visit again for sure. 
I'd like to have a guide book for their events and festivals. If you're a kebab fan then get ready and go to this lovely place and I'm sure you'll fall in love with it instantly, like I did.

One of the best places if anybody wants to have some lip smacking food. Earlier the buffet was less costly. But right now also one of the best menu set by them. firstly The Drinks, Cocktails and Shots are superb. Unlimited Kebabs are there to accompany them. For non veg we have Fish, Squid, Prawn, Shark, Tuna, Lobster, Crab, Clams and so on ........... ( Sea food Festival ) for meat lovers  Chicken, Turkey, Mutton, Lamb. There best veg kebab is CAJUN SPICED POTATOES. For main course they have again Mutton Biriyani which is best Kolkata style dum biriyani. For desert they have SAHI TUKRA which is excellent. And if you are the regular one you will get some extra also. Sunday they have live music with old classics.There service , presentation, crockery, guest attendance is one of the best.

A kebab lover has a dream of eating away kebabs as long as the stomach can take it... its quite evident that we finish our kebabs always wanting for more...here our wildest dream comes true. Eat away kebabs until you are fed up & plead us to stop, probably that's the motto of Barbeque Nation :).
The unique feature of serving kebabs until you bow down your flag is quite an amusing feature. But it doesn't stop there, you have the amazing main course & the dessert to reckon with. The pasta is awesome & am not even talking about the main course. Among the desserts a special mention should be given to the Anguri Gulab Jamun :P :)..

Delicious food. Top class service. Continous serving of starters till you put down the flag that is given to each table. the best thing about the place is its service. Staffs are well behaved and they are so eager to serve you the starters and kebabs. Amazing malai panner tikka Frankly after having the tikkas and starters I was not in a position to eat the main course so tried some desserts. Deserts were too good specially firni was amazing. Angoori Gulab jamun was really hot and delicious. Rosogolla, Vanilla ice cream, Fruit cake, cassata pastry, chocolate brownie are worth mentioning. Really loved the place. One must visit the place. lastly but not least we offered tip to the staff which was returned to us as they dont take tips, for them their tip is your happiness.

Took the buffet lunch @613/- per pax incl tax. 
Kebabs are wao.
Went for starters, starters and starters till it practically filled up my stomach. Explored salad bar - it was equally good.
Soup was good.
Then dived into desserts. 
What a combination in totality.
This is really king of all restaurants in Kol but mainly for NON VEG. Can be a regular monthly destination .

Simply aWsuM ....!! 
The service is excellent with lots of varieties of Skewers and Kebabs 80% cooked right on your table which also has a small grill/Chullah with Charcoal for the rest to be cooked. Moreover the interesting part is the live music/band to entertain you while you eat. All dishes are very very tasty and the desserts are superb....especially the pastries and brownies. Since there are more than 25 items in the buffet menu , at the end you will feel tired...even if you just taste some of them.

If you are food lover and have respect for Kebabs/Sizzlers...then do visit this place atleast once with empty Stomach (Just Kiddin') ;)

Its just DELICIOUS...!! :))

the non veg lunch buffet costs around rs 750/- (inclusive of taxes) and is a value for money especially for the wide range of kebabs they provide in the starters. go for the fish and prawn items first coz in very few places in kolkata will you get such succulent fish items. even the veg buffet would thoroughly satisfy you if you are e kebab lover

This is my 2nd visit to barbeque nation and i loved both of them.
They have a starters course which consists of all the barbequed meat and veggies which is the main attraction of this place.It is served on a grill in front of the table that keeps them warm.

This is then followed by the main course which you might not be much interested after you are filled up with the starters.

They also have a variety of desserts in the end which are also quite good.

The restaurant is also known for its excellent service and staff, who keep on coming to you to know if everything is fine.
I was surprised to see that they do not accept any tips.
It was a really good experience.

My wife and I were frequent visitors to Barbecue Nation around 2007 when the launched their pilot restaurant in Kolkata. Frequent may be a bit of an understatement as we'd practically land up every weekend for the first 2 months..there food and overall package and presentation brought a new kind of ding experience to the city. 
Unfortunately we found the menu fairly static and the buffet didn't have much variety. Much like 'seen one then you've seen them all'. Our best bet was to visit a couple of times a year to keep. The food is great, The service brilliant. Was taken slightly by surprise during my last visit earlier this week when I saw I enthusiastically they were enforcing their no tip policy..with a vengeance must i say. After the meal me tips to the overtly enthusiastic waiters, the valet all cam flying back. Impressed. One of my guest's a gentlemen from the US visiting home summed it up pretty well. "Wow thats more meat than I have for the 4th of July Barbecue!" :)

tired of having delicious kebabs we sadly down the flag as if we surrender to the mouth watering kebabs...Hardly tried main course (Starter filled the stomach)
...but tried desert every time specially hot gulab jamuns were awesome! 10/10 for service and food. Must visit place with friends and family.

I would say, a nice experience for the starters. I personally feel with a tandoor in hand it is difficult to go wrong with a Kebab. So I would say, comparatively easy thing very well done by them. I would have loved a bit more variety with their fish choices, baked Bhetki or tandoori Pomfret nicely done would have captured my heart :).
For the main course I did not have so much of appetite after tasting a piece of all of their kebabs. But for others who might be having a better consumption capability, might complain on the limited choice of main course.
I liked the dessert options too.
What I absolutely adored there is their staff, and it was eminent that it was different from any other restaurant in Kolkata that I have visited. So kudos to the service!!!!

Have been here several times for the kebabs. The kebabs here are too good and the good news is that you can have them in unlimited portion! But all is not well here. The main course in this restaurant is very average and some dishes like the fish item is perennially bad. The dessert again is good. It is a good idea to stuff your self with loads of Kebabs and then head straight for the dessert.

I don't want to drag this, but in simple words if you want to enjoy different types of Kebabs this is the ultimate place you can visit. Very nice environment, with light live music. The buffet packages are very nice and worth the money, you will get to eat almost 14-15 different dishes from starter to dessert.

However, all the kebabs were sooooo delicious that I ended up having only starters and no main course..;) and the price was around Rs. 700 with taxes..
Definitely want to visit there again...

Okay. I love Kebabs. And if there was one place where i thoroughly loved having kebabs then it was "Barbeque Nation". Had gone to the one in Bangalore and once i came to Kolkata, i made a beeline for the only one of its outlets @Saltlake. And by the lord, it was just simply awesome. Loved the food. Specially the starters. The prawns could have been made a bit better and the veg starters could be a bit more in variety. But the chicken and the mutton more than made up for it. Desserts are just simply too good. And i had indulged myself more than what i could satiate myself with. Loved every "juicy, awesome and tasty" bit of it ;)

Over the past two years, I had been attending the Sea Food festival (usually arranged in February) here and the dishes served during the festival ranged from Red Snapper, Basha, Baby Octupus in Thai Sauce, Pomfret Curry, Calamari (Fried Squid), etc. The ambience of the place is also quite elegant.

Was among the very few people who visited "Bar B Q Nation" when it opened first. This place was bang opposite to RDB (where it is situated at present). One of the floor managers, Ms Sonali would walk an extra mile to ensure that guests are comfortable, their likes and dislikes are attended to. Till now i have visited Bar B Q Nation AT LEAST 15 times, (8 at old location and 7 at present NEW location). Everything about Bar B Q Nation is good EXCEPT for 2 points:
1. People like me who do not have ANY sea Food are not left with much choice in the Non Veg Starter section. I always call up in advance to inform that i am coming and request for an addition of 2 chicken items in the starter section. They always reply that ONLY ONE can be added. 

2. I on most occassion find the menu a repetition of what i had on the previous visit. Your menu card on the net boasts of so many items. Why not regularly change the items? 

FYI, i will again be going on the 29th of January (i have made a booking for 12 pax in the name of Hamza Malkani). Would like you to look in this matter

I was really excited to visit their new joint @ Kolkata. So for my 1st anniversary I choose the new BBQN of Kolkata.
As always they were at their best. I love the FOOD...its taste, quality, variety everything is amazing.
Their SERVICE is unmatchable and staff is highly motivated. I can't think of any other restaurant I had such an amazing level of service!
AMBIANCE good enough to please anybody, they have good taste for music and live band was soothing too, sufficient light & noise control.
I am Delighted...

Have been there nearly 10 times, since it is situated in the heart of the IT sector. The concept of unlimited starters is great, and the first experience is Awesome. But after a couple of times the initial awe passes and you realize that the non-vegetarians have better choice of starters. Vegetarians have a limited choice. Also after the initial round of Kebabs, the later skewers tend to be a bit soggy/raw. Apart form this one drawback, the eating out experience is unmatched.I liked the choice of drinks - mocktail/ light beer/ cola. The Buffet has a very good selecton of salads. THe mutton is generally well cooked. But one thing that stands out is the dessert bar. It is laden with a wide variety of relishes for your sweet tooth. I would reccomend it for Project parties or group dining.

i was mighty pleased with the ambience and the decor and the concept of having a barbecue grill serving hot kebabs. the chicken tasted good, the vegetables fine but the fish wasn't that good (maybe i am wrong), coz i dont eat fish often, but my entire team would vouch for the same. the buffet was neatly placed and had an interesting spread right from eggplants, biryani, noodles to dal-chawal; the flavours were fresh and the taste decent enough. am not a dessert man but the varieties were many and i know the place is popular for its non-limited desserts. overall the experience was satisfying (but for the fish kebabs), the service was good and thus barbeque nation is a must visit for sure. all the best for a great future and i am sure with age the outlet would scale greater heights

I visited BBQ Nation 3 times and each time my experience was quite satisfying. This is a new addition to saltlake sector V's food map and it's an instant hit among techies. The main attraction here is the buffet lunch and dinner. 2 types of buffets are available right now. One is for Rs. 310( tax) and another one for Rs. 450( tax). Both the times I went for Rs. 310 buffet and it was awsome. The buffet contains 3 parts : starters, main course and desserts. They serve the starters along with one drink(soft drink/Beer/mock tail) to ur table. The main course and desserts, u have to get them from the serving tables. They have 1 interesting feature for serving starters. There is 1 flag in each table and that will be standed up initially. They will continue serving u starters untill u bend the flag down. Starters mainly include Barbequed Chicken, Fish and Vegetables. Main course contains a variety of Salads, Rice/Biriyani, Naan, Fish, Mutton/Chicken etc. Dessert section consists of around 10 items that include Pastry, Brownie, Firni, Sweets, Ice-Cream, Pudding etc. If u are a foodie,then u must visit this place. Barbeque Nation provides a large pool of quality foods at a resaonable price.
