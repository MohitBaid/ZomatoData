Nice place with great interiors and delicious food along with a variety of hookahs. One must definitely try chocolate shake if u are a chocolate lover..!!But not that quick in serving according to my personal experience..!

The staff of this place don‚Äôt even know what hospitality stands for and this place is just wastage of money and time ... this cafe shouldn‚Äôt even exist in such a competitive location where good cafes like dugout , firefly and bj‚Äôs lounge are doing this business and making sure that they maintain the standards required by the guest ... üò§üòë

Very pathetic service. The hookah started leaking. Some issues with the setup and they blame us for whom hookah is a regular thing. The waiters keep staring at girls if you are with any. A very bad experience.
Would suggest not to waste money and time at such a stupid cafe.
CS: The food tastes pathetic as well

I gave a lot of thought before rating 3.5. Wanted to give a 4 star for the great ambiance and amazing hospitality. However, what disappointed me most were the insects at the cafe. They needed serious pest control to be done. The flies even had a chance to take a dip and taste my thumsup. One of my friend is also seen next to the glass in the pic, which am posting herewith. Anyway, i didn't like the thumpsup too as it was without any fizz with lots of added ice, making me feel that am drinking black, sweet water. Nachos were good. The games put there are fun too.

Visted on a friday night..(15.09.2017) where all the cafes had waiting time, to my surprise it was almost empty. It was my first visit and it@ was terrible. Flies all around me and my food. Feeled disgusted.. who won't? Food was also not so great. Cafe and lounge has generally dim lights and it was too much light.. didn't get the feel of a cafe/lounge.

It was de fresco and had once visited it years back. It then changed itslef to Bang Bang cafe, visited this again with a big group. Ambiance is nice and adaptive to your needs. 

Tried many things, pasta was not that great, had too much puree in it. Vegetable lasagne was great liked it. Coke pitcher had just ice and no fizz. Oreo shake didn't have any Oreo peices. Babycorn was decent, was crispy.

The cost for 2 is definitely more than what's mentioned on zomato.

The rating defines the cafe's worth to its customers. The cafe is decent but the staff are disappointing and rude to its customers. The cafe is underground but the washroom is at first floor which is absurd. Usually the cafe is empty (maybe because of the horrible staff and their service) I doubt this cafe will work. Rather dugout is near and far better than this cafe.

Would like to keep my review short. From outside the entrance seems like its a very happening place. Somehow i did not like the ambience with so much of bright lights and as well as the crowd - smoky all around, though its hookah bar.

Food is Good.
Hookah is decent .
The most annoying thing is Mosquitoes and the worst Song selection of the songs. 
It sounds we are sitting in a Cafe of 19th Century.
Please it's a Request to have a Good Playlist .
Songs Like Zinda Ho Main , Instrumentals of I don't know which era .

It was a good cafe few months ago but now it's has degraded the ambience.

Okay when I visited this place, it was flooded with people. After seeing the menu, we figured out the reason for the crowd..its their exceptionally low prices! Hookah for Rs.180 only and ice base for just 20 bucks!! What else does one want?! The quality of hookah was good too as per the pricing. We also ordered for this Supreme Chessy Mushroom, which was again very cheap probably for 120 bucks, and oh my, it was soo soo filled with cheese, one could simply drool over it! üòç
Ambience: Well lit, bright nd colourful seats, a giant screen playing music videos. Just, the videos weren't clear. The best part about the place was the ceiling! Please make sure you check it out! Have a look at the picture, and you'll know what I am talking about. 
Location: Paddapukur area, right opposite to Jai Hind Dhaba.
Staff and service was fine. 
I highly recommend this place to all lounge goers. Thumbs up to this place. Keep up the good work!

YES.. You heard right
One of the worst hookah parlour of the town
We orderd fruit chillum which was not there
Then the waiter suggested us smokey mojito as our demand was dance smoke.
The hookah was very bad...with the least smoke as possible
We complained
They replaced the pipe 
Again same problem
They again replace the base
Still not what you call a denced smoke hookah
Food was OK but too expensive for the taste
At last out of frustration we ordered red bull which again was not there
So we ordered thumps up
That was also not there
Similarly no soft drink was available but 7up
Staff there was not friendly
So over all
You can say that it lacks the features to be a cafe or hookah parlour
If you just want to enjoy the brightness of a room like a photo studio
Go for it

#Highlights of my experience:
I ordered for home delivery from this newly opened veggie cafe using an online ordering app. Delivery was hassle free. I ordered a veg burger,  didn't realize that 3 burgers of the same kind would arrive. Though the price was reasonable the Burger was dry and tasted bland; even the veggie pattie inside couldn't save the day. 

Wishing the team all the very best for the future!!

This hookah bar is just opposite to Jain Hind dhaba and very close to Bhawanipore college and Forum mall. It's actually a walking distance from there. My friends and I have often been to this place when we are in a mood to have some hookah BUT at a reasonable price. Because of its cheap price ( rs180 for hookah only ), a lot of young students come here. The service is kinda slow for hookah. I guess it takes like 15-20mins for them to serve you hookah. The food is alright. Last time we ordered schezuan noodles but it doesn't look like schezuan at all, considering the fact that I am doing a culinary course so I know about food more. However, on many occasions I have seen the place often have house flies which is very irritating!! The AC don't work that well and sometimes it feels kinda hot inside. They have tons of board games over there and the table itself is writable. I enjoyed playing random games on the table itself as they provide you with a couple of board markers. Overall it's a very cheap place but I would like it if they could improvise the place a bit.

This caf√© has newly opened up exactly where De‚ÄôFresco Caf√© used to be, opposite Jai Hind Dhaba, and to good effect. Much bright and lively ambience welcomes you with cheers of ‚Äò‚Äôhoo‚Äôs and haa‚Äôs‚Äô‚Äô during match hours. They have a giant screen projector making sure all sports buffs get to watch their favourite matches grandly. Seats and sofas have been arranged in an awkward manner making the seats uncomfortable. Sofas, though, have velvet finish which remains soothing. Look up and you‚Äôll find liquor bottles assembled in the ceiling amidst the wood work. This concept, all though not new, has been executed better than the original one {Tyre Patty}.

The food impressed me beyond what I had expected from this place. They have this huge menu containing almost all items that you can crave for. So here it goes‚Ä¶
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Supreme Cheesy Mushroom : These were super amazing with cheese sauce poured all over. The mushrooms were succulent and had amazing texture.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Devil‚Äôs Fondue : Don‚Äôt get too excited by the name, its just fondue. But hey, its ‚Äúfondue‚Äù. Nothing can ever go wrong with this thing. The bread crumbs were evenly baked. They also provide an extra bowl filled with assorted vegetables and paneer to go with the breads.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Crispy Noodles : This was suggested by the server. I found the noodles to be really crispy induced with spicy sauce but I feel the failed to score on the taste of vegetables and had too many onions.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Summer Breeze : This has to be their star beverage. An amazingly complimented mixture of red bull, cranberry, orange juice and bunch of the juices to bring about great flavour. The presentation was also worth a mention.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Shisha : We ordered two shishas, a Blueberry Mint and Royal ‚Äòsomething‚Äô (don‚Äôt remember exactly). Both had dense smoke and nice flavours. I just loved one of the MYA hookah stands they served us.

The staff is polite in behaviour. The service was remarkably slowly though. Maybe because of the weekend and the KKR match, but that‚Äôs no excuse. The servers had to be told a couple of times. Other than this, there weren‚Äôt any flaws. The pricing policy deserves a special mention, as they provide amazing food for ‚Äúthe lowest prices‚Äù in the city.
