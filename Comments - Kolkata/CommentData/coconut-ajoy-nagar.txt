I have been here one month ago. 
Food is simple and bland.
I ordered masala dosa and medu bada. 
Not worth your money.

Located in Metropolis mall. This is a south Indian food joint. But they also serve chat and kachoris.  We ordered plain sada dosa. It tasted really good.

Ordered through swiggy. Good one. Shall try more dishes in future. Â Even though I am not a south indian food lover, but this outlet seems pretty good.
