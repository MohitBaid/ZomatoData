Went to this restaurant today evening...very bad experience. .. no Ac ( one stand fan was given),  bad sitting arrangements,.. food was delivered very late which was not at all tasty...waiter even didn't served us food..just kept the food on table and left.... menu card which was given was like a piece of toilet paper...food was less than our expectation...worst experience in my life in a restaurant....
