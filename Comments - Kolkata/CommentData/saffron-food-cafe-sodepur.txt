If you are looking for the best south indian food around sodepur, drop in here. They make some great dosas, idli, vada and every possible dosa you'd love to taste. The ambience is cozy and the staffs are cordial. ;)

This place is clean but it is too small nd clumpsy... Not more than 20-25 people can hv their food together!
No big table for more than 6 is available.

I'm pissed off with their staff and servicing and I'm not going to this shitty place ever. I went there with a friend. Soon as the food we ordered reached our table , they stood along our table and kept staring at us. I obviously felt uncomfortable. It seemed like as if they were in a hurry to empty our table. As soon as we finished our food they gave us the bill and soon they asked us to leave. How rude. How can their staff treat the customers like this. I got offended and soon left the place. This type of ill treatment is not at all acceptable.

Love South Indian? No more words, visit this place at once! Dim interiors, cold environment, cooperative staff, and what else do you need? More south indian items are available than we have heard of their variety.
