The quality of the food is a bit home like... it was not over done but the dry chilli chicken was full of red colour and the chicken was quite hard... the biriyani was normal... so I liked it on a average basis... as much I have heard the Bengali cuisine is quite good... I am still to try that... so my advise try normal home style food...

Right outside my house almost and again on Jessore Road. Been a long time since i have ate and the quality of food back then was good. Be it the Fish Fries, Chow or Biryani, which back then was really really good but recently the quality has fallen according to people i know and they have done nothing to improve. Not much of an atmosphere to talk of. Just few tables in an AC room near the reception. That's all.

Not recommended.

Had the most amazing chicken sandwich (totally free of fattening mayonnaise), here, today. I had been to Nagerbazar for some work pretty early in the morning, and couldn't find any restaurant which was open at 9:30. Strolled about for a while and chanced upon this place. The place was decent enough, and the food seemed affordable as per the menu. Loved the tasty sandwich and the tastier coffee and masala omelette. Nice, neat place, situated in a chaotic location.
