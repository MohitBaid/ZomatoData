Ambience is clean & nice.

This small kiosk is located at the barasat suncity mall food court. They serve mocktails, mojito, ice creams. The only place in the food court where you'll get good food at a good price. Loved their sundaes. Tutti fruit and sundaemonday! Although I found no difference except the names! But that's absolutely fine when you get yummy sundaes at Rs110 only. I'd suggest definitely to include the green pista flavour in your sundae when you order one.
