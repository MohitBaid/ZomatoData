This outlet is pretty well known in this locality. It is almost at the back of beyond, after Kohinoor Market in Topsia. I have been hearing about it ever since the time I had to visit a client and the landmark was near Albela Biryani!

So one day after finishing my work with this client I decided to stop by this outlet. It is non-descript, a shop by the road which has some space downstairs and seating upstairs. Upon asking what was available I was informed about biryani, which I decided to give a miss, since I am not too fond of rice dishes. I was told there was beef bhuna which I decided to try. An oval steel dish full of boneless meat (soft, well cooked, and tasty to boot... not rich or oily), with 2-3 tandoori rotis and a Thums-Up came to just over thirty rupees. Very satisfying indeed.

Be warned it is not great place to sit. No air-conditioning and of course one tends to stick out like a sore thumb!!!
