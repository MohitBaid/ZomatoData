This restaurant shows another menu with high price lists. This is basically cheating with the customers. Restaurant should be develop or don‚Äôt attact with Zomato with this types of fake price lists.

Ordered egg hakka noodles and chilli chicken. The chicken was too spicy. The qauntity was quite good. Pocket friendly. It's a perfect place for students.

Ordered food from here once.
Everything is just so oily. Even for the Chinese dishes, you can see the oil literally just floating on the gravy.

And I didn't like the taste either.
The fried rice was okay, but I guess there's only so many ways to screw up a fried rice. Didn't check the review before ordering it. Biggest mistake ever.

Worst chicken biryani ever!!!
Spoil the whole mood of having a good biryaniüò´
"Hyderabadi Biryani" near XTREMFIT GYM is much better with an affordable price.

Had recently ordered a few dishes from this restaurant. The quantity, I have to accept, was appreciable. The quality, not so much. Again, being a Food & Wine Critic (TX, USA), this review might seem harsh to a few kind souls.

Let's consider first things first. The food quality, taste, and innovation, is all a foodie needs when he orders in a restaurant (In-House or Home Delivery).

But, what I got here, is a below-par experience on each. Especially, the quality of chicken served, needed some quality check. They were smelling so bad that I had to throw away the Chcken Roll and the Tikka Masala gravy. What was left to me was Butter Naan, and it was good. But there was no masala no chutney available with a Naan, which should be a must.

So, with no more choices left, I had to order from a different place for some gravy item. This is surely not the experience that anybody wants to have for online ordering. Just because no one will tell you on the spot about the rotten chicken pieces, it does not mean you'll serve them stale food, be whatever the reason.2 stars given just for the quantity of the delivered food.

Good for average food. 
Ambience is good. 
New look makes it a bit better. 
One can easily have a table here.
During festive season  it becomes a bit crowdy.

My experience is not good. I ordered chicken drums of heaven and mutton biriyani by swiggy. But quality is appropriate, biriyani oily and mutton size is very small and drums of heaven too salty and coating thikness is heavy.

The quality of food has gone down from before. The tandoor section must work harder.
The mixed fried rice was okay. The chilli chicken was good.

Sabita has undergone renovation recently and though the front looks good , the interior could do better. The tandoor section could do better. I have tried both their Chinese and Indian. I wouldn't recommend their Chinese, but their Indian dishes are quite good.

This place has been renovated recently , it's not really swanky , but definitely better than what it used to be before.Try their mutton Rogan Josh . It's really good. But their tandoor section still needs a lot of work.

This restaurant is located near Dumdum junction. They have a vast menu.

Ambience is ok with sitting arrangenents.

Service was quick and staffs were ok.

Tried Chicken tandoori and  egg chicken roll. Chicken tandoori was bland, a bit dry and chewy. Egg chicken roll was nice but oily.

Overall an ok experience .

There isn't much to talk about the ambiance of this place, it is descent and clean. When it comes to the dishes, I would say that it lacks the taste it deserves. I had ordered for chicken kassa, to go with my chicken biryani. I found the chicken piece in my biryani to be undercooked. The presentation was not upto the mark and the staff members were rude.Would not recommend to someone if a better option is available.

Well the ambience isn't much. They use blue lights, which I feel doesn't go at all with food places. The food isn't of great quality either. I had the tandoori chicken which was very dry and hard. Also had the kabiraji which I felt was full of unhygienic oil, as it gave me chest inflammation. And the fish used in the kabiraji was about okay.

Have been to the lower section of the restaurant. The decor is minimal as in there is hardly any ambience you can expect. I dont know about the upstairs section though. Had tried the tandoor and kabiraji which left me and my friend really unhappy. The tandoors are  like extremely dry ,and the spices hadnt entered the insides. The kabiraji was full of oil and given the price the meat was nominal in quantity.

Located just opposite of Indira Maidan on Dumdum road towards railway station, Sabita has been one of the first food joints in Dumdum which was within "mango people"'s affordability. Interior is not that good, not very well maintained. The biriyani is good at the price they serve, but they should use the scent a bit less.

It's a mediocre restaurant. Not well maintained, very few staffs, and they are not well dressed or smart like a quality restaurant should have. Some foods like chinease chicken dishes, paneer dishes, rotis etc. are tasty. Biriyani, momos,eggrolls of this restaurant are something which I don't like. By no means it can be a go to restaurant for anybody, just good for random eating. Don't expect anything exceptional.

the place is like 5 steps away from my home..earlier the food used to be disgusting..they used to put mustard in chilli chicken..i mean who does that??!! but a few days back i ordered chicken bharta,chicken kasha and rumali roti..it was superb..it really tasted great..i told them not to put any tomatoes in the dishes..and to my surprise they didn't put any tomatoes..no other resturant does dat..so it was a thumbs up for me..at this price point u will never get food better than this..plus the quantity is also very good.for example chicken bharta costs 130 bt the quantity will easily serve 3-4 persons..
though d ambience is not that great but if u r looking for good food then i would highly recommend this place..

Being near my home i have visited it a lot of times. one cant be too bothered with the ambiance if one wants to visit here .............
it is in fact not what id call a well maintained restaurant 
very few staff 
but there is one thing about this place which allures me 
the chinese they make is out of this world 
be it the fried rice 
the hakka chow or the gravy chow 
the garlic chicken or the dry chilli chicken 
all are superb beyond explanation 
the paneer butter masala too is one of my top favorites  here and i must admit i didnt have a better one paneer preparation till date cant say the same about the sahi pameer though 
the biryani is lame as well 
but the soups are good 
the prices are reasonable 
waiters are friendly as in informal 
so while lack of sophistication brings this place down its mastery of a few dishes takes it up a few notch of my fav restaurant  list 
--------------------------------------
overall 
food 4.5/5
ambiance 3/5
price 4/5
staff 4/5
