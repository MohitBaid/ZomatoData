I have tasted biriyani from almost all the famous places in kolkata like arselan, aminia, siraz and many other restaurants. But biriyani from this small place is one of my favourite. The dishes may not be very hygenic or served beautifully, but tastewise it is value for money and also can give a tough competition to some famous restaurant. The aloo is cooked very well, spices are well mixed and the biriyani is very very well balanced. It is neither too soft nor too spicy. And if u eat from alishan for a regular basis, you will definitely fall in love with biriyani.

If you are a biriyani lover & don't want to spend much then this is one of the favourite 'Biriyani Hut' venue. Have ate biriyani & chaap from here a number of times but takeaways are better than to sit & eat because of its low space. It is located near Dhakuria Railway Station & at least once a visit can be given.

I tried biriyani from here after a long time my intial visit was disastrous, however priced reasonably the Biriyani taste is good, should not be compared with the Kolkata Imperials however it is indeed good at this price, quality of meat they serve is appreciatable and good.
Mutton Biriyani and chickn champ from here is my on my order list and I can suggest people trying the same.

Love Biriyani ? Then you must come here once. The cheapest with good quality of food is served here. At ₹70 chicken biriyani is available and ₹85 Mutton Biriyani. Only Biriyani and Chap is served here nothing else but whatever th they serve they serve good.

Good for people who can't afford a Shiraz or Arsalan or Hanglaatherium biriyani. A full plate chicken biriyani is for 70 bucks where you get a substantial quantity of rice, a piece of chicken (not a full biriyani piece, mind it), a potato and an egg.

The flavor is overwhelmingly of the Attar and once you are used to the authentic Mughlai Biriyani, you wouldn't really like to have from this joint.

Quality of food is quite nice. The mutton biriyani is considerably cheap at Rs. 85. Other dishes are satisfactory. Ambience is not so good. Typical para type restro.

Alishaan Biriyani House opened up in the mid 2014 and has been a local favourite. This is a very small biriyani hut like you get for roadside shops. But the quality of food you get is a little better than what you get on any roadside shops. This place is in my neighbourhood and it has become a local favourite for some time now. Main business is from Take Away. Very few people actually sit and eat there. They specialize in Biriyani which usually has One piece of meat, One big potato an egg and biriyani rice (whatever place is left in the pack). They also make Chaaps which are also decent enough. This is more of a local biriyani place where you are walking down and feel like having biriyani but not too expensive. You can also have extra piece of meat, potato and egg if you want with some extra money. You can try this place as take-out, for a lazy dinner at home. 2.5/5 for me.

A small dhaba I would say, rather than a restaurant. Has one of the cheapest mutton biryanis only @ ₹85... Quality is so-so...Good for takeaways...
