Had a horrible food experience when i decided to get my food from this place. Availed the services of swiggy today to taste the following:-

1. Chicken pakoras - 5 pcs of huge chicken pakoras which would seem a bargain at Rs 80 but all that glitters isnt gold. They use major stuffing of cabbage & potato with a chunk of boneless chicken to present the huge pakoras which is so unnecessary & like any cheap road stall. Mightily disappointed with the preparation.

2. Grilled chicken cheese burger - Nonsense in the name of burger. The buns were cold & stiff with stuffing of barbequed grilled chicken, a veg chop & cabbage,mayo & cheese slice. The veg was a huge turn off & the presence of is still a mystery to me. The grilled chicken was somewhat ok. The cheese slice could have been melted a bit instead of just serving it from the pack. Just lazy & casual of serving anything to the customer. Also the packing of the burger in a plastic container was a bit odd.

Nothing to comment upon.

Small cafe serving very budget friendly food
Had sanwich combo 
Cold coffee with ice cream
Fresh lime soda
The staffs are very friendly
Have pool game..dart game
Innovative idea in a place like garia stn..
One thing which is becoming a very negative point is that the atmosphere becomes a little suffocating..
As the cafe is not properly ventilatted..
