That 0.5 was for the pita bread. Please , like please go through the recipe of a shawarma before making it. It's not a egg chicken roll where you put blocks of chicken and tons of onions and cabbage mixed with chilli sauce and tomato sauce. I had ordered two shawarmas for home delivery and it literally left a bad taste in mouth. I don't know it was the mixture of sauce or the consumption of onions and cabbage.

They serve poor food quality. No taste and no quantity. I have ordered chilli chicken. The size of the chicken was that of an eraser. And the gravy it tastes like red chili paste. No at all recommended for anyone.

I have ordered twice from this place and stuck to ordering their namesake dish. I haven't visited the shop, but from the price and quality, one can guess the standards.

Service: Shawarma King is rather light on the pocket and cost for two would hardly cross ₹350. Their packaging is neat and they do a decent job with delivery. No complains. 

Food: I ordered chicken Shawarma wrap and chicken Shawarma salad both times. One might wonder why eat the same thing in two different formats. Well, the salad just has greater quantity of what they stuff in the wrap, and that's what I love. First time I ordered, things were nice and fresh. And that made me order second time, which was yesterday. This time though, I received what seemed very old chicken and cabbage. Probably the rotten left overs from vegetable shops. I'm down with an upset stomach and fever as I write this. Be careful while ordering.

Though it is a small area just at the Kankurgachi crossing; it is worth sitting on those street side chairs for the mouth watering food they serve. I was impressed when I saw they were using spices of some good brands. The Egg Chicken Shawarma Wrap was too delicious; way better than Shawarma Nations. The chicken steamed momo they serve are a loot for just Rs.40 ; good amount of stuffings.
Looking forward to many more visits.

Nowdays the craze for Shawarma dishes is going bit low. Where the Shawarma King is serving the worst Shawarma in his kingdom.

Well this is a small roadside restaurant with sitings on the road serving Chinese, Kebabs, Momo & Shawarma dishes. It's located just beside the Kolapuri Center on Kakurgachi Road crossing.

First of all the restaurant didn't felt very neat & clean. Neither the behaviour of the staffs were satisfactory.

Coming to the food we ordered Chicken Shawarma Wrap that was served in a paper plate. Now be it a roadside restaurant but the pricing of it wasn't that cheap to be served on paper plate. Chicken filling of the Shawarma Wrap didn't felt that great. Also the mayonnaise used was very less. Chatni provided with it smelt bad. It wasn't like the Shawarma should be rather it felt like somehow made.

Shawarma Kings is the worst leader in their catagory. Not hygienic, not tasty & absolutely not worth its prices. Consider other places over here will be the only recommandation.

Shawarma Kings is strategically located at the busy Kankurgachi crossing, beside Kolhapuri Center. It is a very small outlet without any seating arrangements, where you can drop in to have a quick serving of shawarma, chowmein, momo and similar kind of fast food. 
The shawarma counter, cash desk and wall-fixed eating tables are all tucked inside a 10ftX10ft room which feels very stuffy and congested. Nevertheless, food is quite good here, both Lebanese and Chinese quick-bites are satisfying and available at pocket-friendly prices.

A pick up joint near Kankurgachi Crossing  mostly serving tidbits like momo, kebebs, pita, and of course shawarma. I tried their shawarma, it was decent barring the overflow of mayo. Guys, get it right - shawarma has a yoghurt based middle-eastern dip - albeit, you may add a bit of mayo for convenience but not that much! Service is prompt, pricing reasonable.

Great shawarma joint that has opened very recently.  
They serve wide varieties of shawarma in either romali or pita bread. 
While we ordered for romali bread, manager suggested us to try pita bread instead, which was indeed a wise advice.  
Shawarma had enough mayonnaise and spice level was perfect.  
Loved my visit!!

This is a small joint is beside Kolapuri Center kankurgachi 3A bus stop. 
we ordered : 
*Chicken cheese shawarma wrap - It was stuffed with mayonnaise,chicken,cheese and toppings..
I found it too much of mayo and didn't find a good taste of chicken it was like big chunks of tasteless chicken..
As it's a newly opened shop hope the dishes and the taste to be rectified.
hope to visit again!

It is a small shawarma joint.I too am a huge shawarma fan.But what I got here was overcooked chicken,a sweet sauce and hence,a bad package on the whole. When I first had shawarma in Pattaya it was full of vegetables and had a crispy pita bread. I suggest you not to go there to waste your time and money. I would give this place one more try though not very soon.

This is long overdue -- a shawarma shop I can walk to. In all honesty, at first glance, Shawarma Kings look like the place that'll serve up a decent shawarma for an indecent price. On the contrary, the shawarmas they serve are massive, stuffed throughout and relatively cheap compared to most other joints. When it comes to taste, I've had better -- but I've had far worse. I'm not complaining, it's tasty and it comes in large quantities.

The place itself is clean, and the staff seem to be very dedicated. One man even called me in to ask me to 'like' their Facebook page. Unprofessional, but effective.

80 for a large shawarma and the rest of the menu seems to cater to lighter wallets. Inexpensive without being inedible. I live for places like these. Absolute gems and I can't begin to describe how thrilled I am that I have the option of simply walking to my neighbourhood Shawarma Stall.

Ambience/Interiors: n/a
Service: 3/5
Food: 3.5/5
Value for Money: 4/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.

Kankurgachi's only shwarma shop, though they serve Chinese too. The wraps are quite filling, ingredients are quite fresh...pita bread is a bit different from the other Lebanese joints...they serve a shwarma burger which I actually prefer more than the wraps. Haven't tried the Chinese menu yet... looking forward to that. Very much value for money!
