Had a plate of Chicken Pakora. The sizes are pretty big but the entirety is filled with filings with a small chunk of chicken. Tasted great though! 100 bucks for eight pieces.

Located near the bike parking of Mani Square Mall and i am very surprised to see that even people are willing to seat there and have their stuff thats so amazing. Goutams have made their name by themselves and any youngster living in North Kolkata will tell you about them.¬†
It was a veru sudden visit after my lunch so just had their Famous Cold Coffee with Ice Cream. I guess there is someone who makes cold coffee like this, m not saying they are the best but no doubt a better cold coffee to have.

A little joint near mani Square parking. Best place to have cold coffee or hot chocolate in a budget.
I loved its coffee with ice cream... It also serves snacks like momos pastas.. I had both the steamed and fried momo...they taste equally good.

This restraunt is located beside the parking area of mani square mall...they have utilised the small place very well. I was just so amazed by this business idea.
This is not a proper restraunt though.
They serve very tasty food mainly Chinese at very cheap rate. Quantity and quality both awesome. I tried egg fried rice and schezuan chicken with hot chocolate in desert. Every item was very tasty specially the pieces of chicken were very spicy yet likable and I'll definitely visit here next time when I visit Mani Square mall.

Pocket friendly food joint, serves decent quality food and quantity is somewhat sufficient for one. What else do you expect in such a cheap rate! Serves as a quick rescue to your sudden hungers.
Ordered Chicken Noodles, Garlic Chicken and Lemon Chicken. Not much difference between the two side dishes. Try sometimes if you visit Mani Square and need a quick food in a cheaper rate.

Day by day this place is going to dogs, I used to have tea, chese balls and tandori chicken when We came back home late, but now a days the service staffs runs after the tips and moreover they can bluff you if you do not calculate your bill, you will end up paying 100 Rs more. Food my god they used to serve fresh food now the give such an unhealthy food just se the amount of oil on dal makhni, and chickens are also bad....Goutam‚Äôs was my fav spot during late night now I will think 100 times before parking my car near the dhaba....

It is situated in the parking lot of the mani square mall and the order was

Chicken drumsticks
White sauce pasta (with cheese)
Cheese balls
Crispy babycorn
and cold coffee with ice cream

The crispy babycorn was simply yum and so was the drumsticks
They charge extra for the cheese on the pasta but don't give enough cheese ( although you might think cheese is never enough, the quantity they serve really isn't)
The cheese balls are okay-ish
The cold coffee with ice cream is simply pathetic, the coffee is bland with no real taste of it's own and they just throw in a large chunk of vanilla ice cream.

This small eating joint is located in the parking area of Mani Square mall. Decided to go to this place with my friend after I heard a lot of hype about it, but to be honest there is nothing great about this place. A very average eatery. It is inexpensive but the quantity is very less.  
We ordered hot chocolate with ice cream though I couldn't find a single taste of ice cream in it. Cold coffee with ice cream which was not upto the mark. Crispy chilli baby corn was over fried. Lastly the mixed sauce pasta was quite good.
 This place is just over hyped and one should avoid visiting this place in a hot and humid afternoon.

gautam's has impressive impact in the CC1 area, but this one is also good.. at the back side parking area, of the mall, there is the joint with few chairs and tables. foods are not bad. order chicken chow mien or fried rice or crispy babycorn, or order a hot chocolate, one will enjoy snacking or fast food of gautam's only if u just forget the dirts and smokes of cars, ambiance of parking lots etc etc!!

It's a small eating joint outside the mall, beside the parking lot. They have put table fans. There are small tables and chairs. 
We have to order at the counter, get the bill and wait for the food, and get it by ourselves from the counter once it's ready. 
Coming to the food, i have had their chicken white sauce pasta, baby corn, chicken fried rice, veg chowmin and cold coffee with ice cream. There's nothing that special about the taste. Quality is fine, doable. 
Price is average.

Nd what ever they have..
Is not at all good to eat..
I ordered a shezwan chow..
I've attached a photo of it, you may see..
The chow is all red..
I don't know how much sauce have they used..
Cz I've never seen a shezwan chow this red like blood..
My friend ordered pasta, it was also worst to taste..
Nd place is ok types..
Open seating in the parking lot..
You'll see cars passing by all the tym, person parking there bikes..
Good place to enjoy rain nd cool breeze..
The service nd the spokes person is not polite..
Nd when we entered the plate were all there on the tables nd non of the staff have the responsibility to clean..
We have to ask the person to clean up the table so that we could sit..
What I've heard was the cold coffee with icecream of this place..
Nd I didn't liked it soo much..
It was ok ok..
The Gautams on the e.m bypass is much more better then of this..

Decided to go to this place after I heard a lot of hype about it, but seriously its just overhyped, there is nothing great about this place.
Its in the parking lot of mani square mall, we ordered the hot coffee with ice cream ( liked the concept and the taste was good), cold coffee with icecream, cold chocolate with icecream and black current blossom.
Black current blossom was shit, seriously, black current is one of my favorite flavor, but this was just too sweet third class syrup of black current made into a shake.
Coffees were fine, nothing exceptional, I have tasted far better cold coffee with icecream for 50-60 bucks.
We were very hungry so we ordered veg chow, which was fine.
Then we ordered fried rice, and manchurian, it was not good at all, the gravy of manchurian was so watery, I mean how can you call that a manchurian, the small place next to my house, serves 100 times better manchurian than Goutam's for just 45 Rs. Fried rice was ok.
I didn't like this place, and don't know why this is so hyped.

Goutam's is situated in the parking lot of Mani Square. Open and being in the parking area, it was pretty hot and humid during afternoon time. A very average eatery.

I don't usually expect exceptional stuff in places like these, but they serve generally tasty food. Best part, they are open till late into the night.

I ordered Veg Chowmein and Veg Manchurian. Chowmein was a treat ‚Äì great serve size, balanced vegetable content and high on taste at just some 40 bucks. Manchurian, however was a turnoff due to excessive garlic content. Further, the quantum served was also below par.

Food is served hot and fresh. Prices are so reasonable and cheap. Overall, it's okayish. Recommended !!

In kolkata you would find very rarely find a good food joint post midnight.
I was returning from my College at near about 3.30 am after being placed in a famous Private company.
So to celebrate that moment I with my 3 friends went over there.
We had garlic chicken and chicken fried rice.
Food was very much average.dont Expect hifi hygenic  food over there as it is street food joint.
As far as I have heard Cold coffee and crispy chili baby corn is a must try..

In Kolkata you would very rarely find a good food joint post midnight. And especially for night life people crave for such places. To satisfy such people, Goutams provides fast food and Amazing coffee till late night. People come here for a long drive and midnight cravings. Babycorn, noodles, Manchurian are must try. Cold coffee is a must try.

Goutam's is situated on the basement parking lot of Mani square in kankurgachi. Since it is situated in the parking area, it was pretty hot and humid during afternoon time, even though they have a couple of big standing fans. We only ordered for two cup of coffee, we wanted to have masala chai but they were out of it. It costed us rs50 for both. Coffee was pretty good but it took them about 15mins to prepare it. Looking at the menu, the food items was pretty cheap. I will surely edit my review again if i ever get a chance to eat there.

We often come here to hang out . It provides a nice relief from the expensive restaurants in the Mani Square Mall . The hot and cold chocolate is good . So is the tea though I think it is overpriced . The chicken chilly and crispy baby-corn is delicious . Please do not try gravy noodles . It is absolutely bland . You will have a hard time gulping it down.

A very average eatery. Its inexpensive but the quantity is also quite less. So there isn't any point being inexpensive. Talking about the food, we have had chicken pasta in red sauce, chicken momos, vegetable fried rice, chilly chicken at this place. The pasta was just soaked in a blood red sauce, spicy and oily with negligible chicken. The momos were very small and 5/6 in number, they tasted better than the other dishes. The fried rice was oily and the rice wasn't properly steamed. Was undercooked in my opinion. Lastly the chilly chicken was like any chilly chicken you get at a street side shop.

Goutam's is a small outlet in the parking area of Mani Square Mall.

The place is not very fancy but the food definitely is! We ordered chicken noodles, chicken pasta and hot chocolate. Food is served hot and fresh. The breezy rainy day made the taste of the food and our experience better. So we decided to order another round of hot chocolate followed by hot coffee. Having hot coffee/chocolate on a rainy evening is totally a bliss!

Coming to cleanliness, this must be looked into. We found the tables greasy, and some stains here and there. But, food quality+quantity wise, no complaints.

This is the place to hit if you're low on budget.

Visited just 4 days back with 2 of my friends. It's just attached to the parking basement of mani square mall. The seating arrangements are fine, but it gets a little hot there. However, it's a good place to go with friends and just chill. We ordered chicken pasta in white sauce and crispy chicken. The pasta wasn't too extraordinary. Crispy chicken was good, served with two dips- schezwan and mayonnaise. Looking forward to better food!!

A cool place for night hangout, Goutam stands out due to it operating till late hours. The rolls are pretty tasty. The specialty however is the hot chocolate which really stands out.

Goutam's has been there for quite some time now and has developed their fan base fine enough to keep the place more or less buzzing with people...This is one where you can have a taste-buds satiating, stomach filling bite at a very economic cost...I tried their crispy chicken and cheese chicken roll yesterday..the crispy chicken @130/- was apt in quanity for 2 and tasted fine enough, but nothing noteworthy...the roll was really thick and tasty but the quantum of cheese was way below what it should generally be , especially if an additional rs 30 is charged on a base price of rs 50..neways, it is really a great place for a quick bite when u r hungry..no complaints and was overall satisfied..do try...

If you dont wanna spend a lot of money inside manisquare mall then you can surely have a lot of things here.
1) during peak hours people just fight cheaply for tables n chairs ( infact I have seen ladies walking out of SUVs running like mad and fighting for chairs , boys not be under estimated try tricking other's chairs n tables meaninglessly ) whatever....
2) quality of food is good, tastes nice.
3) they provide normal water , but it tastes pathetic .
Every 'Goutam's' in town have this unique feature .
5) Its outdoor at the parking place so beware for rain, sun , heat, dust .( they have one or two maximum stand fans)
4) Staff are somewhat careless , manerless and useless except the chef, who cooks really nice.
( I once told one of their staff " the one who doesnt wear uniform and hat " to turn the fan on, he said its not working but when a girl went and asked he turned it on .
Also the same person when takes order doesnt know what is available or not , doesnt even care to ask his colleagues )
5) Goutam's at Saltlake opp. CC1 is much better.

Still to save money you can go there or I would recommend another place that is Manisquare canteen which is much cheaper with more variety plus its indoors and have a lot of tables.

Went to have Christmas snacks today eve, with family. A pretty decent place at the parking zone of Mani square, good to heal appetite.
 I tried the salt lake oulet before. This area is quite similar to it by size. Easy to locate.
After shopping, we went there. There are wooden seats at seating zone. So here's the things we tried -
1. Egg chow - a less spicy, light dish. No extra oil, well cooked. 
2. Pepper fried chicken - served with two dips. Sweet chilli tomato sauce and mayonnaise; a little bit rich. But not too much. But the two of them were really hard to eat for me aloneüòÇ as they were big in size. So I shared. üòã
3. Hot coffee - served in a clay pot. We ordered two of it. Nice.
4. Cold chocolate with ice cream - this one was such a blast. A large scoop of ice cream floats on the drink, with dust chocolate. The words "most Delicious" is proper for it. You will have to use both the straw and spoon to finish it!üòÇ
Prices are so reasonable and cheap. Definitely recommended.

Goutam's is the coffee lovers' paradise. Earlier, we used to come down often to their Ultodanga outlet for some coffee after late night drives. It stays open for a long time. This outlet is located in the parking area of the mall and it sells some really good hot chocolate. I specially love the Cold Coffee with ice cream from here. The hot chocolate is equally good. The shakes and coffees are very good. This place is totally recommended for some good beverages to boost your energy. Happy Dining! :)

On my visits to mani square i always dropped by Goutam's. Set up in a garage area it is a small outlet offering nice food . The prices are good. Food quality is good. Quantity is a little less but its not a major drawback. The place is quite airy. Crispy chilli baby corn is my fav. Cheese balls are not upto expectation i wish they added a little more crisp to the pakoras. Hot chocolate and black currant blossom are superb .

I user to be a keen visitor if this outlet during my visits to Mani Square mall. But lately there has been a steady downfall in terms of their quality of food and services. I have their fried rice and chilli chicken before and found them average. Today I had egg chowmein from here and I was not at all happy with it. It was barely palatable. Extremely dry and with barely there egg pieces. I would still say that it's a decent joint with cheap prices but Goutam's is known for far better quality. I hope they pull up their socks.

Very very poor. Their quality has gone down. Felt miserable and sick after having their food. This place use to be good earlier but now they have deteriorated their quality. The food was not good at all and the worst part wasn't fresh either. Not recommended at all.

The location of this outlet of Goutam's is a little odd. It is in the parking area. So, foods are bound to be a little unhygienic. The food delivery was quite late. But, the food quality was more than average.
That was the first and tge last time I ate there. I prefer other Goutam's outlets anyday.

Review: Goutam's

A nice little food joint with value-for-money pricing, today we will review this one section by section.

Location - 3/5
At the ground floor of the parking building of the Mani Square mall, this place is almost impossible to locate unless you accidentally spot it while entering/ getting out of the parking, or someone gives you a very precise direction. Grossly, the location being just on the side of Kolkata bypass, it is very easily accessible by public surface transport from most parts of the city.

Facilities - 4.5/5
Having a very well organized parking place both for 2 & 4-wheelers, you actually can have the food sitting just a few feet away from you car. This place a well spaced dinning area, and takeaway facilities.

Ambience - 2/5
Under a shade there are a few low tables and stools, mostly clean, and some chairs lying around, a totally informal place, strictly for an informal friends meet, and grabbing a little something after you park, or before you take off. This is definitely not a place where you want to take your family or the special one, even for a quick bite. Seating arrangements are not very ergonomic for having food properly, no back-rests and knee height tables make your life a little difficult. No walls between the parking place and the eating area makes this place airy, but bring down the "hygiene quotient" quite a bit.

Food & Drinks - 4/5
It is a place mostly for fast foods, and noodles, fried rices, momos, rolls, lollipops etc. taste exactly how you expect them to taste from a food joint of its league. Overall things taste good, and money you will pay them for the food is very appropriate. No alcoholic drinks available, but coffees, shakes, hot-chocolates taste very good for the bucks you will pay for them.

Service - 3/5
Self-service from the counter, you will get your food in thin disposable plates with plastic spoons. Staffs are courteous in general and don't make you wait too long to serve the foods. Some proper utensils would definitely be more helpful for "balancing" your food.

Overall - 3.5/5
If foods at the food court of the Mani Square mall feels too expensive to you, and you just want some quick bites on tasty foods in pocket-friendly price point (with no problem regarding the ambience or disposable plates), this is the place to hit before getting into your car, or just after parking the car. One of the places I usually visit when the month nears to the end, and visiting sophisticated restaurants are not a good idea. :D

The main course we ordered were some rice preparation , schezwan noodles , garlic chicken and chilly fish. The sides tasted so so and so did the main courses. Then we tried out the cheese balls and crispy chilly baby corn. Omfg. They tasted heaven. The memories of the starters still makes me drool.

A small outlet hidden in the parking lot of Mani Square mainly selling Chinese and snacks.  If you want to avoid the expensive over crowded food court then this is the place for you. The cold coffee with ice cream is surprisingly quiet good and not sickly sweet or bitter which is the case for most places selling cold coffee. The Chinese dishes too is good on the appetite.

Downright over hyped.  The food is somehow palatable. The only thing that works for the place is the reputation it has earned over the years from its bypass outlet.  As soon as they tried to spread their sheet, a steady dip in the taste and quality of food could be noticed.

Located at the parking lot of Mani square mall.
You'll find the prices really cheap. The service was fast.
We had chicken noodles, chicken fried rice and chili chicken
The chili chicken tasted horrible. It smelled of raw meat. The noodles and fried rice wasn't good either.
Not recommended.

Just like most of the people here, I would also admit that these guys were great when they were just limited to their bypass outlet. This one, just like their Salt Lake outlet provides basic/decent/horrible food at cheap-dirt prices. A small place with few options to sit, the prices here are extremely cheap, so do not expect outstanding quality food from here. Tried Noodles and Manchurian on the go. Both, being just okay, could dig in a few bites and leave out the rest. An ideal place if you are short of money, but if you prefer quality, better avoid this place.

Visited this small food joint this April with two of my friends! It is located in a garage at the back of Mani Square. üòÇ Had ordered Crispy Chilli baby corn, schezwan fried rice, garlic chicken, chilli chicken, cold coffee with ice cream and strawberry blossoms! Baby corn was awful, the worst I ever had. üòëüòë Corns were literally raw, not properly cooked. The gravy of chilli chicken contained excess of soya sauce, so just ate the chicken pieces! üòè Schwezan rice was okay. We liked the noodles, garlic chicken and cold coffee! üòã Strawberry blossoms was the best of them all.  üòç Prices are cheap! So this place can be visited again sometime. üòõ But definitely not ordering those tasteless items ever! üòÇ

I am nt really into d street food kind of chowmein nd pakoras sold in stalls along almost every road in Kolkata. So after seeing d chowmein I realized dis wl b dose oily noodles wid spicy otherwise bland chicken dishes,and thus stayed away frm ordering main course or starters.
Could hv tried d momos...bt as it was hot decided to hv a drink at first instead. Ordered cold chocolate wid ice cream. Heard really nice feedback abt der drinks at least. It was not chocolate. It was some cocoa powder wid a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Well if dat is cold chocolate I really dnt knw what else to say. Obviously did nt order ny food.
People who really love having proper chocolate nd good Chinese food should nt visit this joint..they are bound to hv a bad experience.

My 2nd visit to this place in as many years ‚Äì but I prefer their bypass outlet much more. The outlet is conveniently situated adjoining the parking lot of Mani Square. Numerous cane stools have been placed for seating and the place was majorly occupied when I visited it ‚Äì which also speaks of its popularity. They also serve certain combos on office days @ lunch hours, which are quite economical. Ambience of the place is nice and gives the same highway dhaba feeling as their bypass counterparts. 

I ordered Veg Chowmein and Veg Manchurian for takeaway. Chowmein was a treat ‚Äì great serve size, balanced vegetable content (capsicum, onions, carrots etc) and high on taste @ just 40 bucks. Manchurian, however, was a major turnoff due to excessive garlic content. Further, quantum served was also below par ‚Äì 8 small pieces.

Service is nice and prices not high. They do charge you extra for takeaways!

This outlet of Goutams is located at the parking lot of the Mani square Mall.
They have a small sitting area with small tables and stools. A cozy and small one. 
Had pasta and crispy chicken from here which I found really good. Try there mixed pasta tastes nice and good in quantity as well.
A value for money deal. Cold coffee is not as good as the other branch.

To me they sell some of the best and tastiest rolls in the city. A friend had treated me to their chicken roll, which despite being spicy is worth the taste. Crisp and with a delectable filling wrapped in the soft hot roll, Goutam's is recommended for any one who fancies a good street-side food such a gorgeous Goutam's roll !

This joint was been recommended and shown by a friend of mine so we went for it.

Location- it is a small joint located in the parking lot of Mani square.
It is mostly used by the staffs of the nearby offices and by those persons who are aware of it.

Food- we went there to have a gossip along with that a bit of snacks.
We ordered for chicken momo fry,chicken lolipop,crispy baby corn and coffee.

Chicken momo fry-the momo was spicy and the pan fried sauce was excellent..the chicken stuff was in fair amount and it was value for money.

Chicken lolipop- the lolipop are small in size rather a bit small than I expected however there was no coating of maida..on a whole the small size was shocking however keeping the price in mind it was OK types.

Crispy baby corn- it was nice and tatsy and the quantity was also good..normally we find this dish with a bit of gravy however in this place it was dry and was nice..they serve it in a plate with toothpicks.

Coffee-i was being told that the coffee in this is value for money and is tatsy however we didnt find that on that day even the friend who remomended this was also disappointed.They serve the coffee in long earthen pots with a pinch of coffee in it for the taste and also a bit different look.

Located on the parking area of the Mani Square Mall.
It has very few seating arrangement. So if you are in a huge group, Alert for them !
Crispy Chilli Baby Corn was over fried. 
Cold Coffee was watery. Hence none of them was upto the mark.

Prices would seem reasonable but not as per the Food quality. 

Service is slow. Staffs need to be more efficient.

Overall, it's okayish. You may try the rest of Goutam's outlets. Or some other outlets maybe ! :)

Ambience- 3.5/5 ( Decent enough as a small stall ) 
Hygiene- 3.5/5 ( OKish)
Value For Money- 4/5.

Located in parking lot of busy Mani Square this joint is frequented by all sect of people. This is a kind of off shoot of hyper busy Goutam's on EM Bypass. With time this joint in concern located at Mani Square has evolved and have started keeping food of different types ( Rolls, Momo. Noodles even Pasta). Have tried the dished here quite a few times too. They seemed OK to fill you and nothing exceptional. Prices were also affordable sorts. But what I personally prefer to have here is a hot cup of tea served in earthen pots, specially Masala Tea.The tea is very unlikely Tea of Bengali taste and is prepared in milk only or with more portion of milk. So its thick but strong at same time. They have generous does of cardamom and tea masala. Visiting with group of friends you can gulp in few cups with the adda going.One advice to management: to have few higher chairs for elders to sit.

Visited this food joint couple of times and even today, I went along with my friend. It's a nice place for a less noisy chatting session (although a bit cramped up place!). We had ordered crispy chicken and chicken chowmein and I liked the crispy chicken more than the latter. The prices here are quite reasonable and no wonder I keep coming here! The place ain't a hygienic one, given the fact that the parking lot is right next to it, but I guess we can compromise on that part. :)

Small and cosy food joint located just behind the Mani Square Mall. The place is a tiny fast food centre with a variety of finger licking food items. I had hot chocolate and crispy chilli baby corn. Both were yummy and the quantity was also sufficient for two. I liked their sitting arrangements with small centre table and 'mora' surrounding it! I also had their chicken egg schwezuan noodles and crispy chicken parcelled. Those were also too good to have. Service is prompt and the quality and quantity they provide can definitely win one's heart!! The place is very clean and well maintained which is also a pleasant factor for me. So I am eagerly waiting for my next visit to this place. :)

You have to self-serve and they cook up food pretty fast. The crispy chicken is my favorite. The open sitting area in the parking lot is a bit hot for the summers but its awesome in the winters. I enjoy the coffee here too..
Easy on the pocket and good on the taste buds so, yes I'd visit here again..

A hidden fast food joint! Its location is its best as well as worst aspect. Best bcos even many regulars of Mani square are unaware of its existence, so u don't usually find it crowded which in turn leads to better service and food. Worst bcos it is not so comfortable to sit for more than half an hour and hot days will make u regret leaving the ac food court a few floors above.

Coming to the food, it is quite a cheap and filling alternative to the expensiv food court in the mall. U get mostly Chinese. The taste is nthing extraordinary but gud enough for anyone's liking. The Crispy chilli babycorn is what they prepare best. The coffee is strongly  recommended. Preferably cold coffee (or cold chocolate if u are a fan) with ice cream. Its gud enough to beat the likes of ccd and coffee world at half the price in that department. Many can vouch for it. I simply adore it! This place makes my Mani square visits worthwhile.
(Also to b found infront of CC1)

P.S.: Please do avoid this place in case its crowded. They don't prepare food as good as when there is no rush.

The original Goutam's is an absolute gem. This outlet of their's however only manages to perform decently well. I expect outstanding food at drop-dead bargain prices from a food join which I have spent most of my childhood eating from.

I personally love where this eatery is located -- a parking lot. A few small tables and chairs make up a rather cute little joint. However, this outlet struggles to provide in other areas. They definitely don't make brilliant food, but their chow is still edible. Their drinks don't bode well with me, but as far as I can make out, the effort is sincere.

Average staff and average food make for a decent lunch, one which perhaps leave a bit to be desired.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

This small food joint was once my favorite. Goutam's serves good food, but is hard to even discover if you don't have a Mani Sq regular with you. It's far inside, at the basement of the building beside the parking. The beverages are special attractions. Pocket friendly as well. A perfect snack joint and hangout spot with buddies, if you don't like crowd.

Yesterday was my first time in this particular outlet. Earlier I have been to the other ones anyway firstly it was too much crowded but we 4 could somehow manage to sit without table. But sooner we grabbed a table after the order was done :)
Food:
1. Chic fry-awesome !so we ordered another plate to munch on after finishing the first .
2.Fish pakora- red alert! Never ever try fish pakora here if you are not a high bp person!  There is no salt in it !! When  asked the person in the counter gave an amazing reply...YEH AISE HI BANTA HAI..ISKA TASTE AISA HI HOTA HAI :/
3. Soda shikhanjee- ok ok type!
4. Fresh lime- very refreshing.

So, pocket friendly, nice adda place.
P.s.- will try pasta as I heard alot bout the same.

When I was in college with limited amount of pocket money, this place was an easy go. Highly affordable with a sumptuous amount of food is what attracted us. I remember even treating out friends on birthday with loads of gossips and happiness.
Recently I re- visited this place after around 3yrs. Now when I compare food quality with other restaurants I find flaw in the taste. Don't know if the quality has degraded or my tastebuds have adapted to tastier food.
Since I made lot of memories over food at this small joint, I l always feel nostalgic visiting it again,

A smaller version of the goutam's at bypass. But offers almost everything from coffees, momos, sandwiches etc. The perfect joint for some snacks here and there. Although this one isn't open till late night. But great cold coffee with ice cream.

Baby corn wasn't at all good. It was just pathetic. I actually had lot of expectations but when ate it, had a feeling as if I can't ever in my life dare to have it.

When I visited this place, this place made me remember of canteen. Kind of nostalgic you may say. It is located at the rear of Mani Square Mall. The sitting place is small beside parking lot but I really loved it because it seemed perfect to hang out with friends. Food in terms of quality, taste, presentation is more than enough if you consider pricing. Delivery time is really fast. They won't keep your tummy yelling for long!

If you want to try varity of food in budget price gautam's is the right choice. In a mall like mani square where highly famous restaurants like MacDonald, pizza hut , subways etc gautam's manage to do people come and eat there. Amazing.

This joint is just beside my office and I am very regular there. Specially for the Momo s and chili babycorn. I had pasta last week and it takes yummy. And the quantity is enough for two. Even two is less at times. Recommended for pocket friendly, street food with loads of variety from soup to chowmein to pasta to sandwich. Can't ask for more under one roof.

An absolute no frills budget eatery. If you are in mani square and just don't want to spend too much bucks for overpriced food items then this is just the place for you.  Located in the garage and offering a cash only service , they have been delivering tasty food for years now. However off late their quality has sharply deteoriated and the quality of oil and spices are going downhill. The place is losing its charisma probably due to the complacency that sets in once you start doing well for a long enough time. One should order coffee here, both hot and cold are prepared with a great taste, however never order any chocolate drinks , they taste cheap. The quantity served is really really good and the taste is just okayish considering it's a budget restaurant don't expect any oomph factor in yhe the food but it will no doubt be decently prepared. They need to work on the quality side , with cheap inputs they are doing a big compromise on quality

Goutam's is one of the more trusted outlets to try out street food in calcutta.  We tried out the crispy chilly babycorn and chilly mushrooms and it seemed to lack the zing of the past, however, the cold coffee is still as good as ever. Do give it a try if you happen to be around the EM bypass area or at the mall.

Goutam's is a decent fast-food and snacks joint located near kankurgachi. I like their indianized version of schezwan rice and the egg chicken rolls. I've also tried their pan fried momos. But they are only okayish. All in all, if you're looking for a decent and filling meal, in and around kankurgachi, this place can be a good option.

This tiny yet cozy roadside strip of blossoms and variety of other combos are great for the pocket locked people. Mani square and em bypass joints serve the same food and both are good if you don't have that high rising nosy sensation. My fav is strawberry blossom and the fries. The amount of food can be shared between more than two people. You can sit and discuss lazily without getting any cold shoulder like other places. Hang out once if you really want to get the easy breezy feeling of the place.

Located off the EM Bypass, Goutams started off as a coffee and tea vendor which slowly grew to mammoth proportions now even offering Chinese and Indian fare. Its hot chocolate and cappuccino ensure people coming in from all corners of the city to try the grub offered. The super quick service and late night availability make it a place to reckon with.¬†

We have always loved our No Frills experience at Goutam's. A must visit!!

But the evenings can be fun with gentle breeze blowing. The smoothies mainly strawberry and litchi ones are my favourite. Soda shikanjee is another hot pick of this place.

A perfect place for takeaways or food for late night drives. For a lazy person like me, Goutam's is an ideal food joint where they allow you to order your food, delivered in your car and you can simply eat in your car, parked on the road. The food is cheap and okay. I love the cold coffee and dry chilli chicken. You can try many other dishes. It's a place where you gotta drop in from late evening onwards since parking on the road has a restricted time span.

This particular outlet is located in the Multi Level Parking not the Mani Square Mall itself . I ¬†am so happy to see the way its grown because I have been a patron right from the beginning and we would drive down to the bypass only for the Cold Chocolate in Summer and Hot Chocolate in winter. The Cola Float is another thing that I still love. The Non-Veg Combo is great value for money... its indianised slightly oily chinese food but quite tasty ... they serve up Chicken Momo ¬†, Chilli Chicken, Veg Chow and a Cold Drink in the combo. Their Chilli Baby Corn and Schezwan Paneer are also quite decent. Fond memories and value for money make this a place I try to stop by whenever I visit Mani Square :-)

Location: Ground floor, Mani Square. 

This outlet of Goutam's is not exactly located in Mani Square, but, actually in the Multi-Level Parking Building. 

No ambiance as such but, a couple of stools with tables have been placed so that people can sit and enjoy their order.

The fare out here is nearly the same as the other outlets (EM Bypass near the flyover ; Opp. City Centre 1), but, the quality of the food is a tad lower as compared to others. Beverages are just the same, nailed. 

Recommendations chalked out on the basis of six visits:
-Hot Chocolate
-Hot Chocolate (with icecream)
-Cold Coffee (w/wo icecream)
-Babycorn
-Paneer Pakora

The staff maintains a friendly relation and the service is quick.

Prices are pocket friendly.

A place to drop by for quickbites. :)

Located behind the Mani square mall at the basement of multi level car parking bldg, it is quite a convenience to grab some quick shakes, blossoms or even eatables for your journey because sitting there itself n having is not that good an idea to me !!!

The brand has grown over the years especially for its cold coffees, cold chocolates, blossoms etc and as a result have opened couple of new outlets here and there, this being one of them. This outlet provides few plastic tools in front of their stall which is not that comfortable and i would rather avoid them this way and head to the food court. Prices are reasonable. The staff service is fast but do not expect anything beyond. The chinese fooding options are available but stuff is oily and i dont like them at all. I would prefer them only for the cold chocolate or a cold chocolate which are pretty much value for money and good enough to refresh you.

If you hunt around mani square you will never be able to find this outlet . Especially if you have not come in a car as it is located in the multi level parking lot. But is quite a solace for gautam lovers for their cold coffee and the cold chocolate. Even the hot teas and hot coffee in the terracotta pots is quite popular  . 

had the crispy chili baby corn the other day but i prefer the outlet opposite city center the food there is a tad bit less oily and the coffee is better . 

For people who want to grab a budget bite and sit for a long time the people don't say anything and a very comfortable with kids chilling and hanging out for a long time . I have often seen large groups of school kids come here.

I was impressed by the speed with which a person attends to you as soon as you park your car and sound the horn. Goutam's is value for money. I'vre also had their Chowmein. The give good quantity which is enough for a proper dinner. I hope Goutam's mauntains its quality and service. It has a long way to go.

Goutam's - much recognised as cold coffee specialist. 

Breif: 
 This is the Goutam's which I loved the most because I always used to bunk school and come with my salt lake friend's here. Whats so special about this Goutam's is that it is the only fast food which is located in the parking lot of mani square. Secondly, it provides prompt service and caters to the large number of its favourite customers who love sipping in a coffee and spread laughters in the gala time. Thirdly, their cold coffee has never disappointed me. I could always drink a few more glasses before I could give up. This small fast food chain has managed to catch the new integral part of the city of joy- salt lake as it has started spreading its branches all across. 

Suggestions:- 

1) maintain more of hygiene
2) serve with a smiling face
3) maintain interpersonal relationships with customer

Recommendations to my dear foodies: 

Don't miss out cold coffee with ice cream here, crispy baby corn and veg Chowmin here. However, Chowmin would be bit of an oily affair though.  

Costly affair? not at all. Pocket friendly. :-)



----- 21 Jun, 2013 -----

Location : Goutams is located at 3 places- em bypass near airport bridge, mani sq parking lot, salt lake near city Center. Now talking about em by pass Goutams they offer coffee, sikanjis , some Chinese dishes and Indian tandoori items too. 

Discussing the pros and cons now, 

Pros :
1) quick service 
2) food is delicious
3) it's basically follows the system of park and eat.
4) prices are low

Cons: 
1) not hygienic 
2) no proper seating arrangements 
3) food is oily

Must try; cold coffee, baby corn and rice wd chicken/paneer

Since I stay in salt lake,this food joint has become home for me. Its inexpensive,has good tasty food and is perhaps the E M Bypass branch is one of the few places in kolkata with the open-eat-outdoors facility. 
No seating at all sometimes becomes a problem,but then its on the main road and there is a huge parking space in front of the place where they serve in every car. So,its very much manageable.
The service is quick unless you go on a Sunday evening or a holiday. The food is unhygienic,but really tasty... addictive I must say.
The rolls,the cold coffee,the fried rice with a paneer side dish,all are a must have. Nothing can beat the hot chocolate they serve in the "bhaand" on a cold ,wintery evening. 
The other outlets are decent too,but the main branch has a good feel to it because of the location. Food is good in all the branches.
I keep going to gautams for a roll and a cold coffee . Its a good place for a fast,quick,tasty meal.

Kudos to Gautam's for opening up under Mani Square and giving me a glass of hot coffee when I need to unwind. This inexpensive little joint is my favorite in Mani Square when I just want to sit somewhere and have a cup of tea with my cousin. They make an excellent, and very addictive Paneer Pakora, not to mention Crispy Baby Corn, and they have good coffee, tea and cold coffee - made in a way which is very Bengali, straight from an espresso machine. They also have chow mien and other  Chinese gravies, which I am not much of a fan of. However, for pure adda, this place is a must.

Oh I've heard stories about this place time and time again about how young guys and girls would spend their days eating momos, but I never knew there was an outlet in the Mani square parking lot and I was astonished to find a place to eat in a parking lot. 

My friend and I went ahead and ordered ourselves some crispy chicken, chicken noodles and coffees. At first the food seemed full of flavor and the food seemed pretty goo, I seemed to understand how people spend entire evenings munching here, but after a while I noticed the amount of  oil that they put into the food and I was taken aback. I am not a health conscious guy mind you, but still if you literally see oil dripping off of your crispy chicken you gotta be worried. Nevertheless, the food tasted great, the time flew by and I couldn't understand that we were eating somewhere because the informal seating gave way for perfectly casual conversation. If I get another chance and hopefully I will, I will definitely look for some spicy food here.

One question though, Why would they put Ice cream on hot coffee? And even if they do why would they print something like this on the menu? Why?

One of the hot favourites of the people of  Kolkata residing in & around VIP Road, EM By Pass, Beleghata , Ultadanga & Salt Lake.This is a favourite eatery of mine & when I want to settle for for a quick bite the 1st place that I can think of is that of Gautom's!People come from far off places too & usually sit in the car, which is parked diagonally opposite in front/ beside  the Palacial Make-shift  Marriage Lawn/Ground.Young waiters , wearing an orange cap & a shirt whcih is a part of their uniform attend you within no time to take the orders!One should try the Chicken Rolls & the Chicken Pakora served with onion rings and a sauce in a tiny clay container,  specially prepared as per their recipe and is very yummy!I also like the coffee sprinked with drinking chocolate &  served in clay mugs designed on the outside.You can enjoy the bites without getting off the car and that too  at a very affordable price.Its a hit with the youngsters & also with people who are having the mindset of a youngster ,like me! In fact Goutams's has a faithful & dedicated  client base who  are regulars &  who throng the place with friends & family .This is one place open from the evening till past midnight on week ends, & closed on Mondays!You  can also pack some food to carry for your home!
P.S: This place has maintained its quality since its inception & definitely  deserves a special mention for this.During the rush hours, specially on week ends , one may have to wait a little longer.....but it is worth the wait!

A long drive to goutoms and then some cold coffee and momos. Goutoms used to be the talk of the town a few years ago. And the location was such that on an evening with nice weather this would be the place that would come to mind. The cold chocolate and the  momos used to be excellent. The only problem used to be the waiting time and also sitting in your car and eating or standing on the footpath and eating.
I went there after quite a while last weekend and do my disappointment the standard of food has really dropped. The traffic on the road has made it quite annoying to stand and eat. Even the coffee and chocolate shake don't have the same taste. The city center outlet is much better with a sitting area and also food wise.
Would suggest the other outlet .
