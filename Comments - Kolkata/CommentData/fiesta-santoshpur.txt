A nice place with great Chinese. Prices are little bit on  the higher side but they are actually worth it. This place doesn't attract a lot of people because of the location. Can be kept in the must visit list though :)

üòãüòãToday On 17th November 2017 We Celebrated Dona Ma'am's 33rd Birthday In Our School. And In The Lunch They Made Rice And Chicken Curry With Sweet Gulab Jamun. After That I Decide To Visit Fiesta, Santoshpur For The 4th Time. I Traved With My Friend Debottam Dasgupta From 8B Bus Stand To Santoshpur By Bus No. AC9 For Rs. 7/- Only. And I Have Seen My Friend's Home Where He Stays For Over 30 Years From 1984. Located Near Joda Bridge. Coming To Food: In The Chinese Main Course I Ordered 1 Plate Veg Hakka Noodles For Rs. 170/- And Hot Garlic Chicken For Rs. 240/- And In The Soft Drinks I Ordered Blue Sea Drink For Rs. 90/- I Tasted Like Blue Lagoon With CGST Rs. 12.50/- And SGST Tax Rs.12.50/- The Bill Came Rs. 525/- The Scenario Was Awesome And The Food Was Excellent And The Drink Was Stunning And The Staffs Were Friendly As Well With Their Service And Ambience. Thank you Fiesta For Making My Day Superb.üòÜüòÜ

Good decor, fair ambience, comfortable seating and satisfactory lighting. Fiesta has been creating quite a buzz in my locality for sometime and so I decided to give it a try as soon as I got a day off. We ordered a humble Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, which was perfect. No complaints. For main course we ordered a Seafood Fried Rice and Kai Pad Khing (Fried Sliced Chicken flavoured with Ginger and Yellow Bean Paste). The fried rice was good, with squids, prawns and octopus flakes, but quite basic as there was nothing special about it.  The poultry dish was full of flavours but a little dull to my taste. With a lot of contenders serving way better Oriental food, Fiesta needs to step up a little more to get in line. And the cost is a little on the higher side as the portions are not as big as u can expect at the given price tag. Overall, a good place but needs improvement. And also, they put forks on the left of our plates, so I think a little brushing up of cutlery knowledge is also necessary for the staff üòõ.

We had a birthday party on 6th Oct 2017 there. Although the place still looks small, the service, food, and cordiality are great. The lamb, fish preparation was great. Starters were also great. they prepared rice and a chicken preparation for kids only, but the test was great that I licked some. Overall a great experience.

Just visited today with my friends , and I was carrying Little Voucher with me for Dinner. They welcomed us as usual and after that I intimated them that I was carrying Little Voucher. After that they provided me the QR Code and asked me to scan the same for redeeming those vouchers. I did it and took my seat. After that one of the twin brothers present inside the restaurant came to us and told that they won't be serving us as they have already backed off from Little. They elaborated like they are in continious touch with Little , but might be Little representatives are not taking action on their request. 

My concern is that , if they are aware of this fact that they will not accept Little Coupns , why the heck they redeemed my Vouchers? They are not at all supportive in helping us out with this issue and moreover they stepped back telling me that its not their fault. Atleast they should contact little , serve us with food and take compensation from Little for their fault , while saving and not harrasing the customers. This is absolutely not acceptible. 

Not sure how this type of issues will be addressed in correct manner from reputed restaurants like Fiesta. I feel that its my mistake I opted for Fiesta :(

P.S. The twin brothers present inside the restaurant might seem to be well aware of minimum etiquettes and how to take care of guests , but when the issue cropped up they just stepped back and started ignoring us.

Ordered Chinese food from this restaurant which I had not heard of earlier. My nephew did it and wow was it a great experience. From the fried rice to hakka mix chow to the chicken preparations they were simply outstanding. ¬†The next time Im in Kolkata i will definitely order food from this place. Why look anywhere else when its just next door. It really is since I have a house near Jora Bridge Santoshpur.

This place is so much more than what you would expect from a para restaurant. I've been here a couple of times and even though I don't remember what all I ordered, one dish, dessert rather, always stands out. The Darsan with Ice cream that they serve is pure gold. It's melts easily in your mouth and is just the right amount of sweet. Plus, it's a refreshing break from the typical desserts we are used to eating. So if you're skeptical about trying this dessert, go ahead, give it a try. You probably won't regret it.

wish there was a way to add ur zomato orders to the review directly, now i have to remember what i ordered,¬†
Chicken fried rice, hot garlic chicken and chicken drum sticks. The fried rice was good but the other two dishes ¬†were. well pardon my language crap.¬†

How can you put mushroom in hot garlic chicken, which btw wasn't hot or garlicky but creamy cause of stupid mushroom. drums of heaven were crap too, chicken was ok and nicely done but ¬†the essential part which includes the sauce is all wrong, tasted more like it had jeere baata and stuff. ¬†If that was chinese then well Tangra is doing it all wrong. ¬†And worst thing you can do to me when am hungry is ruin my mood with shit like this, a lot of peeps here know me in person and they know what am talking about.

Dont know if its a one time thing but will i order again.??? no F-ing way!!! would have given a 2 but the fried rice deserved extra marks

Located between Santoshpur Jorabridge and Minibus  Stand to the left when coming from Ajaynagar side, this Chinese restaurant is worth a visit. Had very basic Chicken Hakka noodles, Mixed Fried rice and Chicken dish whose name unable to recollect at the very moment.

They served the food with chopsticks although the basic cutleries were also present. (Added more of an authentic Chinese touch)

All the food items were well cooked and tasted fine.

I have seen this place while traveling towards ajaynagar and thought of trying this one out based on the rating of Zomato. I must say the rating is quite significant. Yesterday me and my family went for my father's birthday treat. It is a cozy restaurant and  window seats always attracts me. We ordered spicy chicken lemon garlic soup and barbeque steamed chicken for starters. The barbeque steamed chicken is a must try. It tastes different and it will suit the taste buds. This is my favorite dish there. Its something that I have not had before. There presentation is good as well. Then for main course we ordered chicken fried rice, chicken hakka noodles and chicken gar gra tiem which is a Thai preparation. It went well with the Chinese dishes. I even liked the chicken fried rice. It was simple but very tasty. The quantity is okay. The only thing I felt is that it's a bit overpriced. 

Special mention about the staffs and service. The staffs were extremely courteous. I have seldom seen  staffs who are such well mannered and having a helpful attitude. 

Overall a great experience. Will surely visit again.

Santoshpur  Main Road is an unlikely location for a restaurant of this kind but this one rises far higher than what you expect from a 'para' restaurant. It's a steep climb up one flight of stairs to reach the dining space which is clean, well lit and well appointed. Nothing fancy though. Service was prompt and caring, but we were the only diners on this Saturday afternoon. The food was very very good and managed a distinct taste. The prices are reasonable, but not inexpensive. We ordered the Chilli chicken for starters as recommended by others. It was a trifle too salty but good overall. The soup was really nice as was the fresh lime soda folk which they got the sweet salty combination perfectly. The prawn main course and the mixed fried rice were both good though the rice was a tad too spicy because of a generous sprinkling of Chilli powder, I suspect. Overall, well worth a visit. And they deliver.

I have seen this place while traveling towards ajaynagar and thought of trying this one out based on the rating of Zomato. I must say the rating is quite significant. Yesterday me and my family went for my father's birthday treat. It is a cozy restaurant and  window seats always attracts me. We ordered spicy chicken lemon garlic soup and barbeque steamed chicken for starters. The barbeque steamed chicken is a must try. It tastes different and it will suit the taste buds. This is my favorite dish there. Its something that I have not had before. There presentation is good as well. Then for main course we ordered chicken fried rice, chicken hakka noodles and chicken gar gra tiem which is a Thai preparation. It went well with the Chinese dishes. I even liked the chicken fried rice. It was simple but very tasty. The quantity is okay. The only thing I felt is that it's a bit overpriced. 

Special mention about the staffs and service. The staffs were extremely courteous. I have seldom seen  staffs who are such well mannered and having a helpful attitude. 

Overall a great experience. Will surely visit again.

An above average Chinese restaurant in the middle of Santoshpur. The food here is decent, nothing extravagant not very simple. Good balanced cuisine. The service and the staff behaviour was top notch. Very hospitable. Overall good experience

Santoshpur  Main Road is an unlikely location for a restaurant of this kind but this one rises far higher than what you expect from a 'para' restaurant. It's a steep climb up one flight of stairs to reach the dining space which is clean, well lit and well appointed. Nothing fancy though. Service was prompt and caring, but we were the only diners on this Saturday afternoon. The food was very very good and managed a distinct taste. The prices are reasonable, but not inexpensive. We ordered the Chilli chicken for starters as recommended by others. It was a trifle too salty but good overall. The soup was really nice as was the fresh lime soda folk which they got the sweet salty combination perfectly. The prawn main course and the mixed fried rice were both good though the rice was a tad too spicy because of a generous sprinkling of Chilli powder, I suspect. Overall, well worth a visit. And they deliver.

Ordered all the items form the recommended list of online ordering. Appreciate the punctuality and packaging. And it's pocket friendly too. The food reached before time. However the taste of food was not too good I would say. The sreamed momo, sweet and sour chicken were great. Fried rice was nice. The basa fish side dish missed a few flavours. The chopsuey was okayish.

I ordered my food for a home delivery... the starters it had were some mushroom and baby corn both were smelling bad and had a very bad taste. The kung pao chicken i ordered should have been medium spicy while they didnt even pay any heed to that!!

An accidental discovery borne out of being alone at home and not knowing where to get food from...

Sop don't treat this review as an absolute since I haven't visited the place yet & have only ordered my food one before.

Having said that I must place before you what all I had ordered - chicken coriander soup, chilly chicken & par ga triem (sliced fish in black garlic sauce).

I must say that all of them were quite satisfactory..
No bad feeling but nothing euphoric either.

I am sure will give an update here after I explore the place further..

Feasting at Fiesta is a delightful experience as always. Difficult to select one over the other to appreciate. Still Pla Muk Kra tiem and Roasted Lamb with Bok Choy & Leek was worth re-mentioning. To top it, hosting of Nilanjan and his team deserves more than appreciation. Missed Subhanjan this time. Had lunch on the day following Christmas. Looking forward to return soon at the slightest excuse.

For starters, we had Diced Chicken with Pepper, Chili, and Garlic. It was fantastic. In the main course, we had Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Hunan Chicken, Hot Garlic Fish (Bhetki). The rice was well done. These guys know how to handle their rice. The noodles was quite good. The Hunan Chicken can use some improvement. It was on the less spicy side, but it tasted a bit too bland. Also, it had too much cornflour in it. The Bhetki was quite well done. It surprised me.

The Fresh Lime Soda was okay. We asked for sweet soda but they either forgot or put less sugar in it. It wasn't sweet at all.

The decor is amazing. The staff is extremely courteous.

And the food arrived just on time. 

Particularly, the Fried Rice is suitable for the Indian Taste bud.

Similarly,the Thai preparations are pretty nice. The Hong Kong Chicken was a bit bland. 

Overall, nice experience.

An innovative and unusual taste of Thai cuisine , perfectly cooked food and served with warm hospitality. This place has stolen my heart! . Really good food, good ambience and overall good behaviour of the staffs. I have visited this place once and ordered food "Gang Ped Pla " today via Zomato. The delivery person was so cooperating that I am overwhelmed ¬†so ¬†much. And the food is undoubtedly "FataFati (fantastic)" . Please visit this place once in a week! :) Try some Thai cuisine instead of Chinese. !!!

It is just of the crossing near my home and hence we often go for home delivery. There is a dearth of very good Chinese restaurant in Santoshpur area, but Fiesta tries to plug that deficit, albeit just for the time being
Price: over priced
Delivery: pretty good
Staff: gentle
Food: I tried conventional Chinese I.e. chilly chicken and noodles which is good

Till date without any competition this has thrived and enjoying monopoly as its only competitors are the road side eateries.

Maybe with a bit of competition and other Chinese restaurant coming up near ajaynagar it can achieve much more

I stay here, I saw everyday, but never counted them seriously. And today when my mother in law wanted to treat us, I just casually selected it since it's location is nearby and rated well at Zomato.
I really got surprised....ordered Chinese for 3 adults and 1, 10 yr old boys dinner @1000/-..... Awesome food. True taste, good portions, courteous delivery boy and resto- order taker.
Specifically try pan fried mixed chowmein and drums of heaven.
Satisfied and waiting to taste their thai quisine:)
@recently tried squid dish- rubbery and chilli crab claw- no crab meat, only thick flour cover. So abstain from trying these irregular dishes.

We ordered Nam prik praw kai, crispy baby corn,pan fried fish and roasted lamb in bok choy leaf...all tasted fantastic...specially the Nam prik praw kai. Then for main course we ordered 2 Chinese noodles and 2 fried rice. The noodles were better than the rice. Then we had Hong Kong prawn,hot garlic chicken and Nam prik praw ka fish as side dishes. Overall we had a nice experience there and surely suggests all to try it once.

Fiesta is one of the nicest restaurants in Santoshpur area.

##Location:¬†
Located near Jora bridge close to Ashirbaad Sweets just above the HDFC ATM.

##Experience: I was here on a Sunday afternoon for ¬†lunch. From their menu combined with Thai and Chinese tried some of the Chinese items .
Mixed fried rice- Very fresh prepared and made well.
Hakka Noodles - ¬†Blended well with the ingredients
Oyster FIsh - Fish used was fresh and not smelly
Virgin Mojito - Decently made but the presentation can be improved.

According to me this place is one of the nicest family restaurant. Though was here for a short time but definitely liked the food and to mention their good service. Good work.. Much appreciated.

I have had food delivered before from here and it was really good, recently I ordered from this place and the rice had extra pepper, the fish and chicken had BONES!! They also had BONES in the noodles. A place that charges higher prices than competition. Would not recommend this place as you can find cheaper alternative with better quality. Trust me quality has gone down hill.

Came for some light snacks that day. Tried the Crabmeat Soup. It was very creamy, thick and yummy filled with loads of crabmeat. We also tried the Sweet and Spicy Chicken in Chilli Plum Sauce. The sauce was on the spicier side but it tasted extremely delicious. We also had the Oriental Prawns which were pretty good. I loved them. The food is overall good. Didn't try the main courses although. Have to come later sometime for this. 
Ambience is okay with minimal decor as expected at a fine dining in Santoshpur Area. The staffs are courteous and helpful but they need to be trained well in handling cutlery as they call themselves to be a 'finedine'. Otherwise everything is perfect. Happy Dining! :)

On an otherwise pretty forgettable Sunday, which involved alot of travelling, inclamant weather, mediocre to bad food and sundry,¬†Fiesta¬†managed to hold its own standing tall, much like it does, literally. Walked in for a quick lunch plan, not giving the team much of a heads up. A spiral stairway takes you upstairs to the main hall, which has a few tables and chairs and sofas. Ambience and decor is minimal and simple, as one would expect from a fine diner at Santoshpur.

Fiesta is a little gem in South Kolkata.Amidst the mushrooming so called Multicuisine restaurants that have opened in recent years in Jadavpur Garia Santoshpur area this Asian restaurant is a class apart. Firstly the warmth In their service will definitely make you feel special. Then the food. Trust me their Cantonese noodles is the closest thing to Mainland China's renowned dish you will ever get for half the price almost. The food is tasty and you can feel the ingredients are of highest quality.
Special mention Tai Pei chicken for starters, Mixed Cantonese noodles and old school Chicken sweet corn soup.
Once I went there I kept going back. Thumbs up to the twin brothers.

It was a sunday rainy afternoon i went to someplace and waiting for my friends until i got a call from them and known they are here dining in. Reached this place.
Its a ¬†Small but good looking place at Santoshpur Jora Bridge. On the first floor looked very cosy and silent. Sitting has been good where the road view is also available from the transparent glass.
I joined in and the following were already on the table.¬†

Virgin Pinacolada : Until i had the drink the drink was a bit hot but could get the taste of pinacolda in it. It was creamy and tasted quite good.

Mixed Young Chow Fried Rice : The rice was white in color with black eggs in cut two pieces in it. Rice was okeyish but not upto the mark.¬†

Oyster Fish : Tried the oyester fish with the rice and somehow it given the ¬†rice something to cheer about. The oyester sauce with the better quality of fish turned the things little well for me.

Thou a very small lunch for me but still it was a good experience coming up this far from my home. I wish them well. Cheers!

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

FIESTA is a small restaurant on the first floor of an unmarked building close to Santosh Jora Bridge, beside CCD. Immaculately done interiors in white and grey, with a vibrant blue wall to break the monotony, a fresh rose on the table , a minimalistic stairway in brown and glass walls welcoming natural light this restaurant impressed me with its simplicity and cleanliness. Nilanjan our server for the day was diligent and friendly.

Fiesta was located very near to the santoshpur jora bridge. Its in my wishlist from last one month and finally today I went there and packed some item for dinner at home.

This is a small restaurant at the first floor. Deco and ambiance was good. Service is also good I think because we ordered and waited for 30 mins and mean time they offered water and some mouth freshers. Staffs were courteous and mannered.

Coming to the food the Fish in oyster sauce is very good and everyone at home liked a lot. Chicken hakka noodles and Cantonese noodles were so good and well cooked.
Singapore chicken was so so and spicy.. 

Will try some different items in future surely..

Kudos to team Fiesta.......

This review is solely based on the delivery provided by Fiesta via Zomato. 

So the only thing we can talk about is packaging and food. 
Packaging: Very, very nice. There was no spillage and all the necessary sauces were delivered. 
Food: Normally, I hate Chinese food delivery because either the food loses its crunch and becomes soggy or the dishes lose their heat esp. The gravy ones. But this very evening I was sick and was craving for soup, yeah so FIESTA CAME TO MY RESCUE.
I had ordered a chicken coriander soup along with a chicken fried rice. 
The soup was great and soothing. Perfect to taste, perfect thickness, perfect combination ingredients. Bravo chef, bravo! 
The rice too was amazing, but I believe it would taste much better when paired with a gravy side dish especially something spicy.(well, Duh!) 
Over all, amazing flavours. 
Would love to visit it one day. 
But I state that its slightly expensive for home delivery and dine in. ~ 370‚Çπ after Zomato's discount(for a soup and a rice, woah! )
Happy dining.

Edit #1: 
Ordered again from this place and I was truly contended with the quality of food and packaging they have maintained. 
We had ordered for a plate of dry chili chicken and a thai green chicken curry. 
Both of the dishes was amazing as dtated above. The thai curry was the best Ove had it yet and it was a little on spice as I had asked them to prep it that way. 
The chili chicken was great pretty similar to our expectations. 
Overall amazing dinner thanks to

Ordered without knowledge Cantonese noodles for first time and told them to make it spicy.Got corrected and they suggested a lip smacking hot zesty chilli garlic noodles and it was really good.
Delivery time - very fast
Customer Service - very polite

Went to this place yesterday night itself. Nestled cozily in my locality it had appeared quite wannabe at first.Well, yesterday my conception went for a complete toss. Not only is the decor nice it has a favourable extension on the oder side of the building and provides a luxury ambience. The food is reasonably priced and of optimum quantity, we were seven people and needed five platters of mixed fried rice. The Thai soup has a mood uplifting taste. Not only is it restricted to that, the chef takes special orders for the levels of spice one might want in their food which is an added perk! Finally the extremely well behaved staff make the experience delightfully savoury!

A hidden gem in Santoshpur, located near the CCD. This restaurant packs a nice and cosy interior coupled with good food and cordial staff. It specializes in Chinese and Thai cuisine. However, we strongly recommend their Chinese selection. 
Their dry chilli crab claws and mixed meat meifoon is a great combination.
Next we tried Khao pad kra prao i.e. Mixed Thai basil fried rice which was quite spicy. Along with it we ordered a black bean chicken - sliced chicken with black gravy and lemon leaf, which was again spicy.
We also ordered pineapple juice. But to our despair, we found it to be a packaged juice.
This place scores high in terms of top class Chinese cuisine, well trained staff, value of money experience and no added tax.

Looking from some quality Chinese restaurant, around kasba/santoshpur, who can  deliver at Ramalal Bazar. Suddenly came across this restaurant. Before going to the food, I must appreciate the person who had taken the order. He was very polite, he understand our need properly and gave a honest guidance.
Delivered at perfect time, properly packed. Quality was very good. Value for money. Really want to try their specialised dishes.

This particular place is very close to where i stay and hence have ordered twice from here for home delivery. But recently decided to give this place a visit to experience their dine in facilities. The restaurant is located on the first floor and a very small and cramped stairways leads you to their eatery. Their interiors are done in a very elegant way without making anything flashy. It is very sober in appearence. The staff and service is absolute first class. The twin brothers in charge are very polite and friendly. They are alert all the time to attend to your requirements and is always smiling which should be appreciated.

Now coming to their food, i ordered for a Dry Chilli Crab Claws for starters along with Blue Sea from their Mocktail List. The Mocktail was very refreshing and the best part was it was not too much sweet which is the scene almost everywhere now a days. The Chilli Crab Claws tasted very fresh. The Crab Meat was cooked in a fine way and even the coating was on the crispier side. The diced onions and capsicum cooked in the red sauce gelled well with the crab meat. My father was also praising the Clear Soup he ordered in terms of the taste and also the quantity of veg and chicken they used in making the item.
For the main course, we ordered for the Spicy Fried Rice with Basil (Thai), Cantonese Noodles and Chicken cooked with Garlic and Black Pepper. The Cantonese Noodles was fine in terms of taste but a bit disapppinting in terms of the quantity of the gravy. The Spicy Rice on the other hand was enough for two persons sharing. It had a very subtle taste and mildly spicy. A bit different from the normal chinese spicy fried rice. The Chicken item looked very pale but tasted quite good. Though it lacked the garlic tinge but the gravy was rich in black pepper flavour and the addition of Gondhoraj Lebu juice added a new dimention to the dish. Very innovative.

Overall quite satisfying. A very balanced eatery with good food, ambience and service.

Have been ordering online from Fiesta for quite some time now. They make some mean Chinese dishes that taste a little "hatke". Have tried their Kung Pao Chicken, Hot Garlic Chicken, Hong Kong Chicken, Chilli Chicken, Devil's Chicken and Tausi Chicken. Except for the Tausi Chicken which I thought had a funny taste, all the other dishes were amazing, and worth trying. Only issue I have with Fiesta is that they add cabbage in their Veg Fried Rice, which I don't appreciate at all. Overall the food tastes great, no issue with consistency whatsoever and the quantity is good too.

Fiesta is located near Jora Bridge, Santoshpur. Heard a lot of good things about this place. So decided to order dinner from Fiesta today. This review is completely based on their home delivered food.
We ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Hong Kong Chicken and Kai Pad Med Memong. Rice was decent, not extraordinary and I had certainty tasted better Fried Rice. Kai Pad Med Memong was the best part. It was really nice and something new to us. A sweet smell of lime was there (probably), which was really nice. Hong Kong was also pretty good. All the items seemed less spicy to me, but my parents liked them because of that.
Quantity wise all the items were decent too. 
According to me, the pocket pinch was on the higher side.

Can't tell about there deco and ambience... since the review is based on foods I ordered for home delivery from Zomato... the delivery was in time... and the delivery boy was very well mannered... My order consists of...

1. Chicken streamed momo... it was very average, expected some more punch from it, but it failed...

2. Mixed fried rice... I found it to be little flat, though it came with good quantity of prawns, chickens and egg, but didn't made me much exited...

3. Schezwan chicken... since I am a spicy person, it was not hit me so much, but gonna well with the fried rice... the combination makes me feel wow...

So I decided to give a visit to the place in future for having a complete experience...

Yes pocket pinch was acceptable...

We delivered the food from this restaurant for our dinner.. we ordered Crispy Veg in chilli plum sauce, Chicken Hakka Noodles and Hunan chicken... the quantity was enough for the two of us... now coming to the food i just loved the dishes the were way too good...
the crispy veg in chilli plum sauce was yummy the veggies were crispy outside and soft inside the sauce in which the veggies were tossed was awesome it had a bit sweet tangy and hot flavours which was very compatible with the crispy veggies... the noodles was good nothing extraordinary but the taste was good with all the veggies and chicken plus it wasn't oily and that was the best part... finally Hunan chicken shredded pieces of chicken were present into a broth like gravy with some veggies.. when i first saw i had doubt if it will taste good or just chicken and veggies dipped in a cornflour broth... but to my surprise this dish was way too good.. the broth was light with distinct flavours most importantly there was a refreshing texture to it... the broth me and my sister literally loved this preparation.. you can have this dish as a whole meal... overall it was a very good experience plus the food just made our best dinner ever... recommended :)

I have tasted lamb at many places but they have served me the best of the lot. Thai dishes are full of surprises. Fishes are better comparative to chicken dishes, Prices of mocktails are on the higher side, that is why I do not prefer while I visit.¬† I have always enjoyed my food and the ambience whenever I have visited there. Their service is top class and always very attentive towards the customers. I am waiting, when this place will going introduce some fascinating desserts and pork dishes.

This place is literally a minutes' walk from my place in kolkata and I drop by frequently when I visit. I like the place, it's good to see places like this open up in the area. My mom's a big fan of this place as well. The food is good. My go-to combo here, starts with the crabmeat soup, the pan fried prawn momos, the sweet and spicy crispy chicken, followed by nam prick praw goong, dried chilli lamb, mixed meat scezwan fried rice or noodle, or both. Everything is quite good. Except Thai, don't order Thai. Very courteous staff. All in all a good place to eat often.

Overall, a very satisfying dinner.
The Tom yum was aromatic and light. Missed the som tam. Would be a fitting addition to the menu. The Momos were alright. Could be better with a thinner skin and some interesting tidbits like celery, garlic, bamboo shoot. The broth accompanying the Momos was very good though. The fried rice was fragrant and the bokchoi stirfry was super with an assortment of textures and shapes from the greens, wood fungus and shiitake. Some water chestnuts would've made this outstanding. Would have liked the naturally fermented soy sauce used for the 'gravy', and not the industrially produced one. 

The service by one-half of the twins was awesome - attentive, proactive, cheery and honest. It's a cozy space where one is made to feel welcome. 

I will come again when in Kolkata. And will bring friends and family.

Very inconsistent food. Having heard good about this place I ordered food twice. It was a Tom kha prawn soup, the quantity was too less, half a small bowl. A chicken in chilly paste which was nice and a crispy fish was horrible. The next time it was Chinese, a noodles which was nice and a gravy sechwan chicken which had tons of cornflour in it. Would not order again if I have other options!

Fiesta, a place for some fine Chinese and Thai food. In the hot summer afternoon, a cool place to have some food and even mocktails to quench the thirst. The cool Blue Sea mocktail was quite refreshing. From the main course menu, Chicken Singaporean Rice Noodles and Sliced Chicken in Black Bean Sauce helped to get rid of the afternoon hunger perfectly. The thing I liked the most about this restaurant is that along with other usual spoons and forks, you may also help yourselves with a pair of chopsticks. This was totally new to me, and I loved trying it. And even, to my surprise, I actually managed it too. Foods taste awesome and service was also up to the mark. Costs of foods were a bit high, but the quantity balances it finely. And for the ambience, well, nothing unique in it. A rating of 8 out of 10 for this small eatery will be perfect.

Based on their inputs I ordered the mixed fried rice, mixed chowmein and chicken in oyster sauce and carried it home. The food was really good and everyone enjoyed the taste. I am glad that there is a decent chinese joint in Santoshpur. Look forward to a dine in experience on my next visit.

Location: A bit tough to locate in Santoshpur, but follow the map and you will find it. On the 1st floor and got large neon signs.

Parking: Easy at night.

Seating: approx 30 cover, and they hae another floor with additional 30 cover. Decent ambience:

Food: Great. Their thai soups are a must try so are the thai dishes. 

Service: Excellent. Especially the twin brothers who are really attentive and helpful.

Value for money: Definitely.

Will visit again when in Kolkata.

Came for dinner on a weekday in January 2016, found the restaurant to be located on main road, 1st floor n roughly around 6-7 tables only. Seating was comfortable, as it was visibly empty, we took a glass window table overlooking the busy santoshpur road. Decor is simple and tastefully done, liked the blue textured wall. As it was winters, ordered a chicken tom yum soup, starters were pan fried chicken momo and golden fried prawns. Soup was really tangy with lemon, loads of thai flavour of coriander, garlic and chilly and other spices, got my nose leaky with hot and spicy combination :P Momo was not very good as filling had a bigger dose of onions than chicken, pan fry sauce was good and the presentation of the momo was pretty with well-crafted carrots served along. Next was piping hot prawns, the batter was not too great and was very lil crispy when hot and after turning cold, became soggy. But given the element of hot food in winters, it scores. Main course was chinese chicken chopsuey, mein foon rice noodles with chicken and diced chicken in oyster chilly sauce. The chopsuey was good, noodles very crispy and chinese flavours in gravy with a host of veggies and pineapple. Main course both gravy and noodles were totally winners. Loved the noodles, something different and the chicken oyster sauce was great in taste. Also as we were celebrating a birthday, overheard from our conversations, we were offered complimentary cold drinks at the end of meal. The twin waiters were on their toes literally serving us and keeping a tab on food on the plate as well as feedbacks on dishes. It was a great dining experience as the waiters were very attentive and courteous. Would like to come back for the main courses specially as a lot needs to be explored on the menu. The restaurant should get more foodies and become more popular.

The quality and quantity of the food is just perfect. The fried rice is way too homely and the taste of the tai pai chicken which I took as the starter was yummy...the chicken was succulent and its crispiness was perfect.

This place is very close to my house and i visit here regularly. All i can say about this place is that it has never disappointed me. The restaurant is very small  and the seating not for many but the food is mouth watering. The staff is very courteous and helpful. The service is quick and prompt. They have a wide range of chinese and thai dishes and i promise u wont be disappointed. The mushroom salt and pepper, the lamb in black bean sause, and the seasonal squid fried rice are a must try. All in all, i have had wonderful experiences eating here and will keep visiting this place.
the only problem with this restaurant is that the seating is very limited and the location is not very prominent.

A five minute walk from where I live, Fiesta has picked up its business in recent times after struggling a bit in the first six months of its life last year. My first time here, and not a bad experience. The space is small, but is very, very neat. We ordered mixed Pad Kee Mao, which is Thai rice noodles(noodles made from rice and not wheat) prepared with basil and bell pepers, along with Kai Pad Prik Daeng, which is sliced chicken prepared in classic Thai herbs, like lemon grass. We also had some sweet and spicy crispy chicken.
The amount was enough, and the taste was good. The Daeng was flavourful, the gravy really strong. The crispy chicken was great.
Not your regular cheap Chinese place. This is a bit more authentic than what people actually think Chinese is. Will visit again.

Located at Samtoshpur right opposite to Puran Dhaka Restaurant & beside Titan eye+.
Ambience & decor was quite good.
Coming to food
Firstly we ordered Hot & sour chicken soup. It was 'The Best' . 
Then we ordered Schezwan chicken rice & devils chicken. The taste was good but a bit salty.
All staffs are friendly.
Looking forward for my next visit.

You can say that it is arguably the only restaurant in Santoshpur with good food and ambience. Staff was extremely well polished and courteous. We had no idea about how the food will be but it was beyond our expectations. We ordered Khao Pad Kra Prao and Kai Pad Prick Daeng. It was suggested by them by the way when we asked about good Thai Dishes. We tried Chicken Fried Rice and Hunan chicken as well and it was worth a try. Overall, the experience was nice and pocket friendly too

An awesome place to roam around with your family and friends in case you are a chinese/thai lover. A small place lacated just beside CCD at Santoshpur Avenue carries the power to provide you a happy meal. I visited the place twice within a span of 15 days as I liked every single thing about it.¬†

The first thing you notice while entering is the smiling faces of the staff available which automatically gives you a positive vibe to begin. Beautiful ambiance is the second turn on. Last but not the least is the food of-course which can make anybody's day. Say it veg or the non-veg preparations, the perfect mix spices in the food takes your hurt away.¬†

Another must mention will be the price chart. Comparing to the food and ambiance you will end up feeling that you just paid nothing. A complete Budget Restaurant.

Well, although I live very close to this joint but I never imagined that ll serve such goof food. Not to mention the staffs are courteous and very polite, and the food is very good indeed. The place is very small and cozy and we tried Raad Nah and Cantonese noodles with Pla Pad Fish which tantalizes our taste buds. For starters we took double cooked lamb which is was awesome. The Thai dishes are great and authentic. My mother liked the lamb very much and I loved the crab soup as well, the crab meat soup could have a bit thick though but over all, I am highly impressed by the quality of food they serve. I recommend them.

You know how some places have that ever positive vibes, this is one of them. Right by the road not too far from Jora bridge tucked away in the first floor of a well designed building, this fine dining place is a perfect for a Sunday evening date. The food beginning from the clear soup to the thai chicken red curry served with rice cooked in lemongrass, to the Pad Kee Mao, to the Darsaan with vanilla, takes your breath away. The flavours perfectly blended in your plate to give you the authentic fine dining feel. Of course there is the service which deserves a special mention thanks to its generosity, politeness and absolute courtesy. The behavior of the staff is extremely commendable and adds a lot to the fine dining experience. This is a place I would recommend for all food lovers with a taste for the finer aspects of dining.

A little 20 seater restaurant situated on Santoshpur Avenue,bang opposite the Puran Dhaka restaurant,on the first floor of a building.

The ambiencw is quite good and posh even.the service is also good,smiling and helpful.

We ordered roast lamb with bokchoy as starters,and scezwan rice,thai fried rice,tausi chicken,and a thai chicken dish (I forgot the name,the one with chilly paste and bell peppers.)

The lamb was quite nice in taste,quantity was sufficient for two as a starter.a bit less sauce would make it taste better though,in my opinion.

Both the rice was quite good in amount.can be shared between two adults and a child easily.the scezwan rice tasted better,though amount of chicken was less.the thai rice was a bit bland.

Tausi chicken was lightly spicy,in a datk gravy,flavoured with mushrooms and with the distinct smell of bamboo shoots.if you like the smell,you will love it.if not,you may avoid it.we liked it.

The thai chicken was very tasty,perfect combination of spicy and tangy flavour.however,for the price,the quantity could have been a bit more for the side dishes.
Our total bill was rs.1328/- including taxes.
Whether I will visit again?well yes,if I am in the area.or try their home delivery maybe.

Fiesta is a cubby-hole size restaurant on the main thoroughfare and parking is a big issue here. But I visited on a Sunday and could manage. Neat and smart decor and Very Friendly staff! (At times over friendly and mildly annoying. Lay off guys, don't overdo it) The fiesta crabmeat soup was excellent, and so was everything that followed. Roast lamb, sweet and sour pan fried fish, crab claws with dumpling envelope and pan fried gravy noodles. The servings are generous and the taste will make me go back. I heard that they run a pretty neat delivery service too, as far away till spencers in kalikapur at least. Recommended.

Its a very small place with very small accomodation hardly for 20 people, but elegantly decorated and staff is too courteous always with smile on their face. 
Regarding food, we ordered Thai food only and surpisingly it tasted different from chinese which only a few restaurants serve. Quantity was normal and price though not cheap but just appropiate.
Will definitely visit it next time to taste chinese.

This time the added fun were the lookalike twin waiters. Extremely hospitable and almost willing to do everything for you with genuinely smiling faces. No wonder it's my little daughter's fav dining place too. The best dining place in this part of the city when it comes to Chinese and Thai.


This puja there was bit of embarrassment. Had taken some friends. Food, service etc were good as usual. But the washroom was messy and unclean. Please improve

I didn't imagine I would have to so highly recommend this place before I lunched here, notwithstanding the interest the menu of this place piqued in me. Tom Kha Soup is very very highly recommended. Really liked their lamb. We tried their Roasted Lamb in Bokchoy and Shitake mushrooms. Mixed Raad Nah, Goong Garang with lamb, Dry Chili Crabclaws, Crispy Veggies in Garlic Pepper- everything we tried were delectable, much overwhelming our expectations of the quaint little place.
The restaurant is really tiny, a twenty seater or so, but from what we saw, remains fairly empty. The staff is overtly courteous.¬†
Please, please, try the roasted lamb in bokchoy and leek here. Possibly their best dish. :') Please try Pla muk-kra tiem too.

A nice cozy place situated on the first floor of a building near jora bridge,Santoshpur. Been here a couple of times.  The interior, though small, is nicely done with wooden tables and chairs, a counter on one side and open window overlooking the main road on the other. To some the place may feel a bit crampy. 
The waiters are polite and courteous. They often offer you suggestions while ordering if you ask them. The service is quick .

This place only serves Chinese and thai delicacies. And they serve it really well!! Fried rice and noodles - the way they should be. Aromatic and flavorsome. Has that unique Chinese trait which Chinese cuisine lovers like me often crave for while having Chinese dishes. The meat dishes are exquisite and well cooked. loved their mild garlic chicken and Thai chicken. Conatins 8 to 10 pieces per dish. Enough for 2 to 3 persons. The soups are good too. They serve Thai dishes as well which I am yet to try. 
Overall, a nice place serving superduper Chinese and Thai cuisnes. 
Price is reasonable.

There are all sorts of little restaurants popping up in the Santoshpur area these days that I've been dying to try out. Fiesta was recommended to us by a friend as a great place for Thai food - something you don't see much of in Kolkata, I feel - and it did not disappoint.¬†

Food: We ordered only Thai food and it was just *perfect*. First came Tom Yum soup, which was rather more sour and spicier than Tom Yum soups I've had at other places. For starters we chose Dry Chilli Crab Claws and Roasted Lamb with Bok Choy and Leek. I cannot recommend those two enough, I think I'm going to have wistful dreams about those two starters. Seriously, just try them, even if you're not hungry or you don't like Thai food - they will transform your life. Ok, I'm kidding. Maybe a little but not much.¬†

For the main course we had Thai Lamb Red Curry, which came with rice - rich and delicious and creamy -, Kee Mao Pao, a papery-thin rice noodle, very spicy Tausi Chicken and Khao Pad (so-so fried rice).¬†

The food was exquisite, which is an adjective I throw around a lot but which I really meant this time.

Ambience: The restaurant is tiny and cozy, the decor fuss-free but neat. It gave off a very nice "family-friendly" vibe.¬†

Service: Service was quick and efficient. Our host, Suvanjan, explained what went into the making of each dish (and helped us pronounce the names correctly) and was extremely pleasant and friendly.

Quaint little place with extremely polite staff but can get a bit annoying when they keep wanting to serve you and your trying to have a conversation.

Will definitely go back for their yummy food.

This is in my locality but it still was a discovery to me when I first had food here and then never stopped. It thrilled me to have such good Chinese so near my place. Though people interested mainly in the Thai part of the menu might be disappointed by the limited choices, the Chinese part makes up for it. I would recommend their crispy fried preparations. The oyster sauce preparation was also good. I usually prefer noodles, but after I had the Fried Rice here, I order only that. I think that's the best thing here and it could convince any noodle-lover to switch sides. Their spice varies according to their preparations and there is a choice for every palate. I also remember the staff being very courteous and friendly, voluntarily serving the food. The cost of the food ends all doubts. It is the best value for money if you are looking for good Chinese with a student's pocket.

As soon as I looked into the menu card thought of trying something very different n it was Thai. I thought the best Thai in town was by benjarong but I was wrong.this place had an awesome Thai menu.Ordered for Tom kha soup,nam prik praw pla and green curry...it was simply delicious and something which I had really longed for.A must visit for everyone dose who would like to try out something different.

To start with if you drive in here at a busy time, you may not get parking here. Then comes the first floor bit. You have to climb some steep stairs to reach here. Apparently they are working on expanding in the ground floor but till then.....

Coming to decor, like others have said before its simple and crisp.

WHAT really appeals for a place like this is great service extremely well behaved and well trained servers (which one doesn't even find in fine dine places these days) and good food.

I ordered lamb roast in bean sauce and plain steamed rice. The portion was just right. In fact there was plenty of extra rice left. I had ordered a fresh lime soda, which I feel they could improve upon though.

Hands down, best Asian food I've had in ages. This small food place can give the big guys like Mainland China and Benjarong a run for their money. I've visited this place almost 5 times in the last month... And still can't get enough of their food... Absolutely love their Pad Thai, Tom yum, chicken in black bean sauce, chicken with bamboo shoots...etc etc... Can't wait to try each and everything from their menu... Keep it up guys.

The restaurant was pretty good. The food quality was good and the interior was nice and cozy. The service was good. The people there were well behaved and very hospitable. As we ordered large number of preparations the serving speed seemed comparitively faster.
This place is most enjoying with college mates. And one more thing (a family finished their starter and the called for the waiter and the just said  "main course" and the waiter said " its ready sir" and the family said" we didn't order the main course only " ???  lol!!!!
And I asked for a coke the served me with a fork. Hahahahahahah But the place is nice to go ???

Awesome experience. The food is yummy and a great break from the typical Chinese cuisine. Loved the ambience and the service is excellent. We had found something wrong in a dish and they promptly replaced the whole dish and did not charge us for the extra dish. Andrew is the man to look for once you are their. All in all a great place to go with family.

The menu card made me order from here.. It offered thai food which was different from the typical chinese and Mughal food available around. We ordered thai food from there and everything in the order was really different and good. I just hope the resto keeps the quality same.. Its now my best option in this area for a good family food fiesta....

It's an interesting and amazing experience at fiesta, Asian fine dine. Very nice, cosy and warm ambience with a soft, sobre interior... Well behaved, smiling face staffs are there to attend us.service is really good and quick. We have tried   Po -tac soup, with sea food(tangy spicy thai soup).then crab claws as starter (you must try this),in main course we tried mixed hakka noodles,  diced chicken in garlic sauce,  and rice with thai red curry. All of them are  real pleasure to the taste buds. So you people must visit this new place and try it's real thai and Chinese preparations.. It's yummy ;-) would like to visit again and again and again...

Last night after watching a movie.. There was no food at home so it was a sudden decision to eat out.. So why not trying out a new one which is just near to home.. Though it was quite late night we(family) were heartily welcomed.. The order was served really early.. The food was classic.. Behavior was very polite which is rarely seen in Kolkata restaurants.. Ambience is good.. Interior and serving style with the quality of food and availability of items in the menu has impressed me.. Will definitely visit again..

Well, this place is just 5 mins walk from my home but never visited it. I was very apprehensive about the food before stepping in. Even I had to wait for 5mins before entering as it was full! But trust me it was worth it!

Coming to the decor, its simple, warm and inviting. The place is not too big but its okay. The food, quality and quantity wise both were very delightful. Found a perfect place for Chinese cuisine just in my neighbourhood, yay! Was so busy in eating that forgot to click pictures. The staff were extremely courteous and always lit their faces with a smile. Service was very prompt!

Give this place a try, its really worth it!

Found the perfect piece of China in the heart of our neighbourhood! The place has the perfect ambience, food, hospitality and easy on my pocket. We had Chicken Taipei, Cantonese Noodles, Tusai Chicken and Darsan and every thing was just too good. The key word to be used for Fiesta is Authentic and I found the food here better than the Chienese heart throbs of the town.

One week back..
What is Mayuri's favourite place for 'Chinese' cuisine?
Answer: Chowman
Few minutes back...
What is Mayuri's favourite place for 'Chinese' cuisine?
Answer: Chowman....err Fiesta...Chowman...forget it she is confused.
So, why is Mayuri confused?
Answer: This new place in a not so upscale locality (unlike @Chowman in posh Golf Green) has matched the standards of cooking of her favourite restaurant. She loved the pan-fried noodles.

Alright, enough of third person...I loved the pan-fried noodles. LOVED THEM.
The spicy lemon & garlic soup was delicious and if you have a blocked nose just go grab a bowl.
¬†The service was good and the gentleman who was waiting on our table was extremely COURTEOUS.¬†
The good thing is the restaurant is accessible by public transport and it is in a very busy, yet clean locality. So, go ahead and give Fiesta a try! ¬†It is also cheaper than Chowman. And that is a big compliment. :)

This is like two minutes walk from my apartment. And naturally the husband and I could not resist trying a new place when we saw one opening up round the corner. We were pleasantly surprised. The decor is non fussy yet comfortable and inviting. The staff are courteous and the service is prompt.¬†

Now coming to the food. We have been happy with all that we tried till now. The items that we tried are --
Po Tak (tangy soup like Tom Yum minus the coconut milk makes the husband happy)
Spicy Lemon Garlic soup (not for the faint at heart -- sure remedy for stuffy noses!)
Diced Chicken with assorted pepper and chili garlic
Mixed Meat Fried Rice
Fish in Black Bean Sauce (a must try)
Stir Fried Gravy noodles. Okay, this is not in the menu. Just ask for it. This is tossed in soy based sauce, but if you want it white, try the Cantonese Gravy noodles.

The cost for two with a soup, two soft drinks, one rice or noodle item and a side dish comes to roughly 625 to 650.¬†

I would have given them 5 on 5 had they offered home delivery for those lazy afternoons or chilly winter nights when you are in a mood to order in some steaming spicy soup and comfort food alongside.
