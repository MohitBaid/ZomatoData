Okay ish... Unnecessary use of red pepper and condiments sometimes hampered the real taste of the recipe and made all the chicken recipes taste like the same...

Another thing, they forgot to deliver an American Chopsuey dish in my home delivery... I ordered through Zomato and paid online... However I raised the issue with the restaurant and Zomato and both of them assured me a refund...

Would have rated them 3 otherwise...
