A bit of surprise to see this sweet shop in Zomato. This sweet shop is just 2 minutes walk away from my house and I have visited this place numerous occasions. To be honest I don't prefer their sweets much. The quality is not bad but it can be improved a lot. The price is lesser than many other sweet shops around and that brings customers here. This place has been years now since its birth as I am seeing this place when I was small. They have very limited amount of sweets with less variety. The owner is quite friendly and well behaved. They also sell samosas and chops in the evening. This place can be located as you move towards Manton from James Long Sarani. You have to be little alert as the place is small to be missed out. One of the few things which I really like about this place is their snacks and mishti doi.

Last words: 
The best thing about this place is its very very reasonable as you don't sweets in this rate.

3/5 only for value for money
