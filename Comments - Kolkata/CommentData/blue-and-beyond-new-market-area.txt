Located on the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay in the New Market area. The ambience is very good especially the outdoor sitting on winter afternoons. The staff is helpful.
We ordered sizzlers- Kung Pao Chicken with pan fried noodles and grilled lamb chops with mashed potatoes, saut√©ed vegetables and garlic bread. The food is not up to the mark- I have had better. Also proper cutlery should be provided for the dishes.
Is this place of a second visit? Only for the quiet ambience that it provides.

Located on the top floor of Lindsay Hotel, New Market this is a beautiful roof-top open-air place! You can visit for the amazing ambience and romanticism that the place offers!
On a cold winter evening, to celebrate a special date we decided to give it a go!
The menu has a variety of yummy starters and we took Chicken Teriyaki among those.
It was filling and delicious. The drinks were good as well.

The best thing about this place is the ambience no doubt! You can get an amazing city view from there.

For one starter and two alcoholic drinks, the bill was around Rs 940!

Price is a little higher. Service is good. Seating arrangement and view are brilliant.

Took my mother for a lunch while shopping in New Market area. It took me a while to spot the restaurant as it is inside Lindsay Hotel. It was a cloudy day with intermittent rainfall,so we sat inside. The fish was good as it was made with betki and not Basa!!! But the satay chicken had a weird smell to it which was not very pleasant. The ambience was good though! I think it would be better to pay a visit in the evening.

Firstly the ambience
My favorite rooftop in this zone
The view is just too good
The staff are courteous
The price well if compared to food and ambience it is ok
I tried
Pepper chicken dry - cooked in South Indian spices it is perfect lovely succulent and mouth watering
Teriyaki chicken - flavor might be different but chicken is dry and chewy though recommended here not my first preference
Crispy chilly babycorn - pretty ordinary the usual crispy nothing unique you don't find elsewhere but yes babycorn being my favorite I always order it
Mahi afghani - lovely just lovely I do recommend it not too spicy not to bland to taste perfect balance and the fish is fresh and perfect
Chicken biriyani - nothing special considerable quantity had 3- 4 pieces of moderately sized chicken perfectly cooked
London house sizzler - just too good*recommended* all the items mixed together yet all retains their flavor

When cravings r big and the season is winter what more can u have other than red wine.. associating with some lip smacking good continental delicacies.. and the restropub adds a boon to it as it provides an amazing rooftop view from the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay.  They offered a perfect blue and beyond ambience that was worth cherishing and the staffs were courteous enough.  The amazing view of the city from the heights added more to it. Got a cabana for us. Low light and well decorated which gives a perfect blend to a perfect romantic dinner with your loved one. We ordered teriyaki chicken which was their speciality. It waa boneless chicken pieces sauteed and cooked in ginger soya sauce. Then took the chef's choice was lat me kai (lmk) a dish having  chckn dices tossed in chef's special sause. Then we had the lamb chops sizzler which was served with boiled veggies mashed potato and garlic bread. Its a delicious meal if u want to go for lamb/mutton cuisines. And we also had a draught beer mug and a cocktail which they called Sangria but i called it love. It was a perfect drink of red wine along with apple slices. But yeah they will not provide u with a cake as complimentary one. You can take ur own and can celebrate the birthday there as we had it. A perfect romantic dinner date it was. And the bill was reasonable too according to the delicious food they served üòç All the staffs r way too generous and helpful. So as a whole its a perfect date spot.. ‚ù§

Visited in a wintery night of December. The ambiance is great with glittering Kolkata offering a charming view. Now for food we ordered fish finger and crispy honey babycorn. Fish finger was not upto the mark. For main course fried rice, hot garlic chicken and chicken bharta and kulcha. Main course items were good. I would like to visit again mostly because of its great ambience.

Standing in front constantly watching us..and then started switching off the lights..they also off the AC it was really insulting.. Hope not to visit never ever again..if they are so punctual they shouldn't have taken our order..we would have moved other options..behavior was really rude

The rooftop on the 10th floor of the lindsay hotel.
The location is prime,as it is situated in the heart of new market.
as soon as you step out of the lift,staffs greet you well,there are two portions of this restaurant,one is a closed normal dine in place and the other is the rooftop,trust me the view is amazing,you can see the howrah bridge,kolkata skyline,
now coming to the food
We ordered chicken tandoori which was bland,there was no masala to it,
Then i ordered for biriyani coz i was having a craving for biriyani,it didn't taste good
The chocolate brownie sizzler was good.
overall it was a good experience,the rooftop view just stole the show so a 4rating.

The place is right in the middle of the city near new market and the rooftop restaurant is nice. But the food leaves much to be desired. I went with most favorite items such as teriyaki chicken and mahi afgani but was not fully happy with the quality. The chicken was dry and chewy. The fish was ok. I left the restaurant post starter and went to better joint for food.

Very disappointed by this place. This place had all the things gunning for it, but how royally they've screwed up.

The view is breathtaking, that I'd admit, and its the only thing the 2 stars are for. The place is cramped like anything, with barely any privacy between the tables. Worst thing that comes out of this is, when people on the table beside are smoking like chimneys, its not a pleasant environment.

The food was also pretty bad. We took a chicken a la grecque, which was strictly pedestrian. With no hint of flavour and in which an overall bland taste was present.

Food tasted good - special mention for Teriyaki Chicken. It was awesome. Chicken manchurian was on the spicy side for me. Good 5 course Chinese meal accompanied with beer made our stomach full :D
Will have to come back here during evening to enjoy the actual scenic beauty and ambiance of the open air restro! :)

We ordered a sizzler (kung pao chicken), tengri kababs, breezer and cosmopolitan. Food was really delicious in taste and the cocktail was also tasted perfect. Great job. Its a must visit for those who appreciate the ambience and the taste at the same time. Great place for a date also. ;)

Rooftop on 9th floor of the Lindsay. Just at the Mirza Ghalib street end of the new(Hogg) market entrance. The craftly carpeted entrance simulates a museum which gives nothing away about the panoramic blast that is to come. The place scores high on ambience (live violin adding to the charm) while lets down a bit on the service and economic front. The audio speakers were broken last time I went and it wasn't until the violin started playing that it turned up the mood. A drink during sunset at this place could be a life changer for people in search of cupid.

And i think they get money to use green chutney bcoz they bathed the dishes with it before serving only...not only dissapointed with their food but also from their staffs...we couldn't track the plce so we call to ask them and they even couldn't give any landmark... 1 point was only for brownie and decor..also they only give importance to tourists...üòÇüòëüòëüòë

"Blue and beyond" location - Esplanade, Kolkata. 
The restuarant offers a rooftop experience to their customers so we added the nearbuy coupons just to experience such specialties; but to our disappointment : 
1. Every single dish had a very cheap essence with an unexplainable spice to it which will intialy tell you that this is off the restaurant menu. 
2. No coordination in service as you can expect your main dish to arrive first and then they might add you with the appetizers and even after that if you try and ask for an explanation they might give you a street brawl fish market feel to it.
3. Dare not try and argue with them as they offer a revengeful service to you if your feedback goes in a negative way and you might end up with stained cloths and wet shoes 
4. Don't even expect for a compensation as they offer nothing and just nothing to it. 
5. If you ask for a complain register they might provide you a feedback form. 
Just a wow experience from our side.

Old is gold....holds absolutely true for this restaurant. One of the best roof top cafes with very amicable staff. The chicken stew is a must try dish here. 
Visit either with ur friend for a cosy chat or with your soul mate for a romantic dinner.

The ambience is no doubt good.Visited here yesterday.However the thing is that they should keep more staffs who can attend there customers as we had to call the staffs a number of times to place our order.Food was good but not amazing.But still its no doubt a nice place to hangout under the open air.And yes the staffs who were there were courteous.

"Blue and beyond" location - Esplanade, Kolkata. 
The restuarant offers a rooftop experience to their customers so we added the nearbuy coupons just to experience such specialties; but to our disappointment : 
1. Every single dish had a very cheap essence with an unexplainable spice to it which will intialy tell you that this is off the restaurant menu. 
2. No coordination in service as you can expect your main dish to arrive first and then they might add you with the appetizers and even after that if you try and ask for an explanation they might give you a street brawl fish market feel to it.
3. Dare not try and argue with them as they offer a revengeful service to you if your feedback goes in a negative way and you might end up with stained cloths and wet shoes

Hello...
I am an ex-employee of Hotel Lindsay. After leaving hotel in 2010 i was unable to visit but at that time Blue & Beyond looks different. The food is specially very much authentic at that time too. Mr. Phillips was GM at that time hope still he is there. Now, i am happy to see that its look much more better than earlier. Also i have seen the reviews and comments are amazing that people are very much delightful after visiting. I will give 5 out of 5 to you. Hope i will visit soon.

Blue & Beyond is located on terrace of Hotel Lindsay in Dharmatala.
A fine dining open-air luxury resto bar and lounge - cozy, comfortable and beautiful ambiance. 

Amazing experience to have evening snacks or dinner. 
Though half the rooftop is covered and air-conditioned, but one must see the city below from the open terrace - spectacular.

The bartenders are great, the drinks are consistently well made.
Food is amazing but kinda heavy on the wallet for the quantity offered. Drums of Heaven is a must try.

The kind and courteous staff add on to the overall dining experience. 

Give a try to enjoy food beyond hustle and bustle with panoramic view of the City of Joy !

There are many rooftop bar and restaurants in kolkata.I visited most of them but According to me this should be number one in Kolkata as both food and drinks are concerned. I visited many such bars where i found foods are below average.They concentrate only on drinks.But here you will get one of the best unique cocktails ie flaming lamborghini as well as in food you will get mouth watering Sizzlers,Teriyaki chicken or their kebabs.The thing that i like here every items are presented in a very unique style. For example a simple Cryspy Chilly baby Corns are served in a fried Papad which i found very unique.
And the most important thing this place is cheapest compared to any Roof top lounge in kolkata. Ex- You will get 60ml Blenders Pride at 225 or Vat 69 at 265 which i guess you will not find anywhere. On Top of it the management and all the stuffs are very courteous.Overall a very nice place to spent with your loved ones.

Me and my husband went there for his birthday. The ambience is very nice, service was good,  even the starters were not bad, but we had ordered some main course for dinner which comprised of very basic mixed fried rice and hot garlic chicken. There comes the horrifying climax!!! It was so bad that we both suffered from acute food poisoning that night!!! And also, we had packed some food for home and my mother-in-law had some of it. She too suffered from the same!!!!
I am never going to have food from that place again!!!!

We bought a nearbuy couple meal coupon. During the afternoon the place is quiet . We ordered Hot & Sour soup first . The soup was not really delicious. Then we had our starter - 'Chicken Tangri Kabab' . The kabab was good and it was soft . But I felt the marination could have been better . Then came the main courses . We had steamed rice , yellow dal tadka, chicken dum ka murg and tandoori roti . The roti was hard and dum ka murg tasted awful . The chicken pieces had a bad odour and the preparation was not good too. The dal was light and had a delicious taste. At last we had strawberry scoops . The scoops were really good . The roof top view of the city is not very secnic but it's a open place under the sky to enjoy .

Lamb chops are really well made and worth a try, the fish fingers specially the one with bhetki is finger licking.. they have a variety of food items and till date nothing disappointed me..and I am planning to visit this place once again very soon..

Located on the top floor of the lindsay , this is probably the most romantic place to have dinner in central kolkata . With a nice view of the kolkata skyline this placee offers you an exceptional ambience , altogether different from what it is , 9 floors down .
Staffs are really really courteous and well behaved .
Service is promt . Had teriyaki chicken ( as zomato suggests )  and believe me , it was gteat !
But again , it's the ambience that appeals more than the food .

It was the durga puja dashami and we were four colleagues over there for a grand lunch. It is a picturesque location which is at 9th floor of lindsay hotel just opposite of the simpark mall gate 1. u can see the victoria memorial, second hoogly bridge and the howrah bridge with the entire city and believe me it feels really nice.
¬† ¬† ¬†we ordered baby corn majesty, mahi afgani¬† with budwiser and carlsberg. both of the starter was yummy. and the best was mahi afgani , it was made of bhetki fish and it is a must try here.
¬† ¬† ¬† In the main course there were mixed noodles, veg fried rice, dry chilli ckicken, lamb hot garlic and chicken hot garlic. Lamb was not upto the mark but all the other dishes was worth a praise.¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† nicely decorated place, very neat and clean. the roof top arena was very nicely arranged. The only flaw which i found is that the elevator. It can carry only 4 persons at a time.

Talking about the place,its an amazing one...its located on the 9th floor and if u want to experience a rooftop view then this is very suitable..a beautiful scenic view of the whole city
Now moving towards the food side,the quality is fair but quantity is very less and the price is tooo much according to quality...the sizzler wasn't even sufficient for one..and I would really suggest u not to go during pujas as u will not get enough options..just a piece of suggestion,try to go for a dinner rather than for lunch just to enjoy the rooftop and the lights
We had
1.sizzling troublesome chicken - amount is very less..i won't suggest
2.fried rice - tasty but amount is less for 2
3. Schezwan chicken - good quantity
4.hot chocolate brownie - its a must... totally loved it <3

In a time when our vision is concluded by some artificial erections , you will be amazed when a paranoma of¬† kolkata with faded second Hooghly bridge and Victoria, will be offered to you .. 9 th floor view, sip in cocktail , breeze , eyesight - all these will surely rejuvenate your mind ..

The location of this place is in the mid of the hustle and bustle of new market area, yet if you are in the restaurant you'll understand what tranquility means. Russell street offers you an old open air joint for food and beverages. Have to say the sizzlers here are too tasty and with that atmosphere it worths every bucks you spend. Cocktails are my favorite here. If you are in kolkata still want to have peace of your mind with your own surroundings I'll suggest you this place.

Want to have a rooftop view experience while having a drink. Then this is just the right place for you. The ambience is very good with thw whole of city view from just a glance from any seat you wish to seat upon in the restaurant. The food is average, better to go with indian food here rather than continental. The prices are also bit on the costlier side and would be too much for people who would be thinking to consider this for having an adda.

Awesome place. Beautiful scenic view of central Calcutta. Good taste of the food with romantic ambience. A roof top restaurant in Calcutta might be a bad idea due to hot humid weather (March to September). An air conditioned room is available though with limited tables, and that is much preferred as the view is the same as outside. Good place for couples...!!

well to start with this place, coming back years after almost seemed like walking down the memory lane. as a kid new market shopping often landed us here, when the restaurant was known as Jharokha. as a child I always enjoyed the food and the hospitality. Then it did a make over to blue and beyond. The recent look of the place is upscale and smart. the view from the rooftop has always been magnetizing. However, i was a bit disappointed with the food though! dont think i will cone back for food, might be for the terrace and some nostalgia. we ordered deewani platter, chicken was chewy and the prawn was dry. repelled we ordered the chicken salad, which was fair enough. White Russian drink was average.

Well well well , if u are here for some good view of the city then u are bang on in terms of place. The place has AC as well as open terrace section both up to the mark. 

We we're staying in the same hotel so went here for dinner. We ordered for Cream of mushroom soup which was perfect in taste. Veg Schezwan rice was just too too spicy to eat so please avoid it. Hakka noodles were basic. We ordered one gravy along with the rice just to sooth down the spice of rice don't remember the name but it was bang on in terms of taste. Drinks were ok.

The staff was very courteous and very cooperative.

Only minus point is the location, very difficult to come by car here as it's in one of the busiest Lanes of the city, even cabs I doubt come here.

Being a mumbaikar I don't think it is one of the places to visit in the city , u can give it a miss.

At the departure of the dusk, beyond the bustles, towards the blue. "Blue and Beyond" synonym for elated and exceeding.The entrance itself describes the alluring art and culture of " The Bongs", expressed as grey memories on the wall. Either the high rise prominence of Tata steel, or the blurry view of victoria is enough to describe the city of joy, from the 9th floor.It becomes more eloquent when accompanied by sip of cinderella and so cheesy cheese sticks with mayo and lastly succulent tutty fruity...I will again visit there soon...

The restaurant located at Lindsay Street in Esplande isn't hard to spot if you know the place throughly. It is just opposite the simpark mall. If you are reading this review then I should make this clear that this place is just perfect for any occasion- be it a romantic date or birthday. Located at the 9th floor, the view from the restaurant is exotic which can just lift up the mood . With Victoria Memorial on one side, Second Hooghly Setu and Howrah Bridge on the other side , this place has surprised me a lot. Away from the hustle bustle of life Blue and Beyond provides a solitude which you can enjoy with your friends and family. One plus point about the restaurant is there is smoking zone and you can roam around the place with your drink till your food comes. Now coming to the food , since the mood was so romantic and it was drizzling a bit, I had order Tuborg , one shot of Camino Real Silver tequila and Smirnoff and along with that was the Teriyaki Chicken. And after me and my friend were done with it we ordered one Grilled Lamb Chops . Teriyaki Chicken was so delicious that I kept of licking my fingers after it was done. It is a must have when you visit this place. Grilled Lamb Chops was a sizzler and it was quite heavy. We provide 5pieces of lamb finely cooked along with some veggies. The platter look so colourful. But we already had so much the whole evening we packed the rest of the food. Everything costed us around Rs 1800.

So who ever reading this , I would recommend you to visit this place once coz the sumptous food along with the extraordinary view of the entire city can give you a feel good moment and memories you can't forget.

Happy eating folks.üòä

With lots of expectations and good reviews.. I entered this restaurant today. It's a well known roof top restaurant and that's its USP. First thing that caught our eyes was the space.. Chairs are well maintained and nicely placed.. Even though it was full, it wasn't uncomfortable. Ambience is just awsm.. Cool breeze and roof top view is great. I got lucky that rain just stopped minutes after we entered the restaurant, and they quickly arranged for the seatings for customers. Service is good and staffs are very supportive.
About food.. Again.. Tariyaki was finger licking but u must have it before it gets cold. We ordered a fresh lime soda and blue n beyond spcl mocktail, both were nice and upto the mark. The main course though was not the same. The lamb was supposed to be spicy but was more tangy or can say sour. Rice and Dal makhani was below avrg. I am sure they can do better and they will. It's a one time must go place..
Cheers!

Blue & beyond...the name says it. Well I visited this place yesterday evening for the 1st time. I heard about this special rooftop restro from my friends...nd my 1st impression was just wow. The place is perfect for romantic date,though i visited with my cousins. After settling down we ordered a plate of drums of heaven with couple of beers. They served the drinks very fast but it took a really long time for the food. It was not so much outstanding,a bit spicy just like other chinese cuisenes. Then we ordered two sizzlers...chinken a la grique & lamb chops. The chiken sizzler is really awesome,cooked in red wine sauce...& the spices and herbs mixed with it made it delicious. But we got a bit disappointed with the second one...the read meat was soft,cooked well...but it was not the lamb chop actually. The flavours was awesome i must admit that. The ambience was cool,with soft music and breeze. The view of kolkata skyline from the top was a lifetime experience. But they are so much slow,that we have to wait long time after ordering the food. And not only that, they have a long range of bar menu,but unable to deliver most of the common brands. After all the staffs are friendly,well mannered and helpfull too,that's why i'll go there again.

If someone asks me to define my visit experience to Blue and Beyond in a single word, it would be "Tranquility". The ambience of the rooftop dining area is just magical. Perched above the city, you will feel the absolute peace in all your senses, specially at night.

Coming to a detailed analysis of my experience --
Ambience - absolutely magical, nothing can be said about the view, one has to experience it first hand.
Food - We started with mix fruit cocktail and Foster's beer. For starters we ordered, chicken Teriyaki which is their signature dish and is a must try. Main course we ordered Chicken Stroganoff, sauteed chicken in gently sour sauce served with rice was nothing less than absolute perfection.
Staff - As courteous as can be.

Overall, considering in all the factors, I will say that I will definitely be visiting this place again. For the chicken Teriyaki has been awesome. Surely Blue and Beyond is a bit pricey, but given the ambience it is totally worth it. I will recommend everyone to experience the night dining experience here at least once. If someone‚Äã is planning for a romantic dining experience, there can be nothing better than this, but do ask for the high tables by the boundary for optimum view. My final verdict is 5 on 5.

I've gone there a couple of times. Located at the top floor of the Lindsay Hotel, it offers quite a nice view of the cityscape. 
Coming to food the ones that I've tried are-
1. American corn- classic and tasty 
2. Reshmi kebab- Good
3. Crispy fried chicken- it was more like chicken cutlet and was very dry. Not recommending this.
4. Grilled lamb chops sizzler- Amazing üòç
5. Mutton mirch bhuna gosht sizzler- One with an Indian twist. Recommended 
6. Sizzling brownie- Nice
Staff were well behaved as well.

This place is ideal for couple or someone who likes have a food in open air as it is a roof top restaurant.The ambience here is 5/5 specially after the sun set.We had couple of sizlers and drank some liquors.The sizlers were good but served it little late.The price is bit on the higher side..Must go for fellas who is planning for a dinner date in roof top......

Visited a year back for my birthday treat with my boyfriend.. after reaching the top floor of hotel Lindsay u have to pass by a gym n a beautiful picture gallery.. the rooftop ambience was relaxing n great, reached there just before sunset hence enjoyed daylight as well as evening neon light.. n the good things end there.. food was average, rather blunt and overpriced. At such a price most well known restaurant of the city provide better quality or double the amount as the amount of food provided was not even adequate for one n above all at that price.. as for drinks we took whiskey and beer.. so nothing much to say on this part.
Service was good but could be better..

Went there for a drink..
The staffs were courteous enough..
The cherry on top of the cake was the scenic beauty from the hotel.. Being situated on the 9th floor,it provides u with a mesmerizing view.
Though the hotel is situated at the extreme location of the Esplanade market area,but the roof top view is amazing..
And we were offered a discount on the drinks too..

This is one striking beauty in the New Market Area.A breezy dinner it was at the roof top.It had the  perfect scenario to wonder at from the 9th floor taking a sip from that exotic glass of mocktail. After a tiring day you can go sit and enjoy your dinner gazing at those sparkling beauties above you.
You can also plan a dinner hangout preferring a good drink with your friends.(if you are planning to get home drunk )
For me ,it was one wonderful breezy dinner date with  mom.We had continental food though, I enjoyed it's mock tails the most.Had dinner two times here during my stay at kolkota and my special mention about "Orange Blossom"..It was just the one I was looking for.
If you just prefer to sit inside and enjoy staring at the ambience from inside the bar ,even that can be one one good idea Besides ,they also provide some place with a roof where you can sit during the monsoons basically without the rain drops on your soup bowls.
Go and gaze at this beauty in the city of joy.I am sure one will be contended with its little charisma !

Went for a date here and it is absolutely perfect for the same. Pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side but you wont mind it as the ambience makes up for it. We mostly had starters which tasted good but were nothing extraordinary. Four stars for the ambience, the view and the service.

The part that draws you back to this place is its amazing view. The open terrace with a magnificent view of the city.. Sitting almost in the middle, is a beautiful experience. 
The beverages are good, so are the starters. The "Lat Me Kai" and "Teriyaki Chicken" being my favorites.. The main course disappoints though. Wouldn't recommend for a dinner/lunch. 
What is suggested though, is maybe a nice casual hangout, with a few drinks and starters.. 
And a lot of admiring the view. 
Cheers!

1st of all happy monsoon!!
Blue and beyonds, is one of the oldest restrobars of Kolkata. As we all know places like new market, esplanade, and parkstreet area has been the centre of prolific night life. Since the British era esplanade has had rich culture and heritage itself.
Hotel Lindsay is located just at the centre of Kolkata, a symbol of Kolkata's culture and heritage. Which is also the entrance of the roof top restrobar blue and beyonds. A lawn fully decorated with the pictures of the maharathis of Kolkata, will lead you to the bar! If you are a bengali you must have known those famous personalities.
Due to rain the outdoor seating area was not available. Compact in size, nicely decorated with blue nion lights, comfy seating arrangements.
Service was quick, all the staffs were really courteous.
We ordered teriyaki chicken, mahi fish, blue and beyonds cocktail and virgin mojito. The chicken dish was decent but not the best. The fish preparation was really good, fresh and soft vetki fillet marinated with mustard sauce. Blue and beyonds has quite a huge spread of cocktails and mocktails.
Price is little on higher side, rooftop seating area is the main attraction of this place. Decent option for one time visit.

A beautiful restaurant with rooftop sitting arrangements on the top floor of Hotel Lindsay at New Market.
Unfortunately,we went on a rainy evening and so obviously we could not sit at the open area.
The indoor is beautiful and cozy with a pretty live bar and mocktail counter.
‚Ä¢We ordered for two mocktails-Blue & Beyond special and Fruit punch.
Blue & Beyond special is an amazing mocktail topped with vanilla ice cream and made with sprite is very refreshing.Also,the fruit punch is pretty good.

‚Ä¢For starter we had the Dewangi platter.
Dewangi platter is basically a kebab platter having chicken,lamb,prawn and fish kebab,2 pieces each,spiced and cooked to perfection.
The lamb kebab tasted so good.
The chicken pieces were succulent.
The best was the jhinga and fish kebab.Absolutely lip smacking.
‚Ä¢Moving on to maincourse,we wanted to have basic chinese food.We ordered for a chivken schezwan rice which was well cooked and quantity is fine.
And we took a lemon sauce fish,was not extremely sour neither too spicy and the fish pieces were soft.

The staffs are well behaved.
Service is prompt too.
We could not have a candlelight dinner because of the rains,but the indoor sitting arrangements are pretty as well.

All the items were aptly served and both the sizzler as well as the lasagne was piping hot and tasted awesome. The service was very good.

I found the place overpriced, food was not that good even both in terms of quality and quantity. We took some nonveg appetizers ,beer bottles and a virgin mojhito. The food was bland and bad and expensive. The only thing I liked about this place was the ambience and nothing else. Never going back again.

Its all about the ambience. Forget the taste and quality of the food and cocktails. That sums it up. We ordered Waldorf Chicken Salad amd there was no chicken in it. When we complained it was changed. The Lamb chops were all bones and no lambs. The LIIT and Classic Martinis were not tasty at all and way too strong. The Martinis were way too sour.

Situated in the Heart of City, Lindsay Street with a rooftop view which covers almost the entire famous buildings in the city. It also got a indoor AC sitting which is more comfortable during the Summer but one can enjoy the cityview with fresh air only in the rooftop sitting.
Food is just awesome as I heard from nearly everyone of my friends and colleagues. We ordered the speciality, Chicken Teriyaki is just yummy. The best teriyaki ever had till date. Mocktails are pretty good but not the best, tried Muddy Water.
Hospitality of the staffs are to be mentioned specially as rarely one can experience anywhere. They were very polite, nice, friendly and comes with good suggestion always.
A Must Visit......

The ambience from the roof top was just mind blowing. Took their combo meal which included soup, starter, main course, dal, bread, rice and Ice-cream. Food was just awesome.

You get to see hair in your poached egg and then service body just comes and says we can only change the egg. As it's in 9th floor the view is really good but other things are not good at all. The service boys are lazy.

9th Floor of Hotel Lindsay, this place is surely a hit with its beautiful view of Kolkata, the open rooftop seating area and a menu to be happy with.I dropped in with my friend Sreyasi Ray at about 3:00 pm on a Saturday afternoon and opted to sit indoors overlooking the rooftop space.It was a captivating view, our beautiful city with its bustling crowd looked scenic from such an altitude.Coming to the food, we ordered Pina Colada and Cranberry Saga as the coolers.The Chicken a la Greque was our choice of sizzlers along with Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce.Serving time was moderate.The coolers were okay to taste.The chicken sizzler was well-cooked but I found a few lumps in the mashed potato and a few of the veggies served seemed stiff.The fish was good, soft on the inside and the gravy was not extremely spicy.Service was good, the staff is polite and helpful.This place is must visit for its ambiance, one of the best rooftop outlets in the city.As for the food, there are areas to improve.

What better a place than to have a college reunion.
A gang of 8, we choose the corner seat, sadly, they could not fit us there and neither did they make an effort to put us together at our choice of place.

We had beers in abundance as the only form of beverage. Although they did run out of Budweiser

We started off with three different starters, crispy lamb, pepper chicken and chicken teriyaki, out of which the teriyaki was miles ahead of the remaining dishes we had.¬†The service was fast, but i do doubt the quality, which i believe was compromised.

For main course, we stuck to basics, noodles, rice, schezwan chicken, stroganoff, steak.
The ambiance is what kills it all, its a ripper, the best probably what the city has to offer.The food was good nothing exceptional although i expected more from themNevertheless, a s repeat visit would be only for the ambiance

It has a good ambience  if you choose outdoor seating you get a good view of the city.. for me the rating is only for its ambience food really disappointed me.. but will visit this place once more to try some other dishes as bad days do come in evry1s life once but not always.. so let's see what it has in stock for me in my NXT visit..

This rooftop restaurant located on the 9th floor of hotel lindsay, in the sreeleathers lane. On a cool brezzy day, its a nice place to visit. They both have indoor & outdoor sitting area. The decor was nice and music choice was really good. I visited this place on a saturday evening with my elder sister. Being a non-alcoholic i ordered 'Moctail~ Sherley Temple'. Which was quite good and my sister ordered Mug Bear, and with that we ordered their famous Chicken Teriyaki. That was delicious and that bear wast chilled at all. And after that i ordered One 'Penne Creamy Cheese Italian Pasta' & one Kingfisher Ultra Max. they served that pasta with bread. The dish was a total flop and that bread was too bad. And they suddenly gave me two ultra max but i only ordered one for my sister. When i asked that waiter to cancel one because we only ordered one, he simply said & i quote ''You told me two. I have written it on my paper. I am not wrong. You dont have any choice. You will have to take this''. I told him that i am a non-alcoholic and i dont drink but he wasnt even listening to me & was being quite rude so we wanted to talk to their manager but then two another waiter came and told us that what happed! so we explained & then that other waiter said its ok, we are going to cancel this. Basically after that we were so angry that we did not even order any desert. They basically spoiled the whole mood. Never going to visit this place & will tell my frinds to not go for sure.

This is one of my favourite places in Kolkata...whenever I visit this city, I always go to this place...There are many rooftop pubs now in kolkata...but this is the most romantic place out of all....I have been visiting this place for last 5 years I guess...The food did not use to be tasty by then...But since my last two visits, the foods are exquisite I guess....It makes a perfect 10/10 in every aspect now...

So, why 4.5. It"s because of my last visit...For the first time I bought two coupons of 999 from Nearby..one coupon of 999 offers 3 large drinks/3 pints of beers and one starter in weekdays...The combo price of the same from menu comes around 1100..so we are getting a discount of 100-150...In zomato, they also show you that combo offer...But when u visit the restaurant, the waiters won't give u that...I feel if u r promoting it in Zomato, don"t hide it to the customers in your pub....Also when I availed that coupon , I had given all the 6 large pegs at one time, saying this was the policy..Also, the beer offer inclydes beers like Heiniken, Tuborg,Burdweiser etc...but the waiter told us that only draught beer is available..there is no stock of other beers...but I saw they are serving other mentioned beers to the other customers...I also felt that we were not being attended properly by the waiters for the coupon...Usually whenever we go to the place, we get a jovial treatment from the waiters....Guys, you are giving only 100-150 off around 1100 worth...so please don't act like u r giving it in half price..

Guys, please dont make a bitter experience for me...for the last 5 years, this is the most beautiful rooftop pub for me...please don't force me to stop going there...

'Blue & Beyond'- truly amazing ! The name says it all. It is a grand experience. ¬†As you pass through the nicely decorated corridor with city landmarks ¬†to reach the 'summit of your culinary opulence' you are really doing justice to your gastronomic entity. The open rooftop with grand seating arrangements speaks of aesthetic taste of the owners. As the sun goes down, a gentle breeze woos you as you enjoy your food and drinks. I engulfed all i could from this popular yet classy culinary destination, as i went with my friends last july.¬†
We started off with cocktails, accompanied with delicious 'Mahi Afgani'. As we continued pampering ourselves with gorgeous 'Pomfret sizzler' and mouthwatering 'Kung Pao chicken', a gentleman at a corner of the restaurant began playing with a guitar. This is truly an added attraction for us.
The hospitable staff will enhance your comfort!

Coming to why I didn't rate it to be 5 is the service :/
No water served till good 10mins and I literally had to ask them for water and the menu card !
The food was okayish, nothing to die for !
I ordered a pepper chicken steak and some chicken greque sizzler !
Please visit only if you wanna catch up over a beer or some drinks üëçüèºüëçüèº

I have been here for a many times. The place is fantastic at the 9th floor, the rooftop ambience is arguably excellent. You can order a pint beer and njoy the lovely evening with the beautiful live violin performance. But the main problem is foods. The quality of the food is pathetic. But to enjoy a lovely evening with your loved ones with a drink and snacks then this is the best place to hang out.

As a beautiful place for hangout with friends or planning for a casual meeting of official works there can be hardly any place better than this restaurant. You can sit here for countless time and enjoy the scenic beauty around the Kolkata with sips from cold beer and mocktails. Though I don't drink alcohol but the ambience is itself so tranquilizing that you will love this place for it only. As per food quality I will give it 4 out of 5 because it's not so much delicious . We ordered sizzlers and gravy chowmein there. My friends ordered few bottles of beers also. But quality of food can not equalize with the neat behaviours of the service and colourful decor of the rooftop lounge. But I will visit it again because of the view it provides. Hope next time they will make the dishes more drooling. :)

One of the best ambience but worst will be a lesser word with the kind of hospitality they have. Our steward, Ravi Kumar, was least interested to serve and attend us when required. When asked for the bill, he was in his own dream world to be able to attend immediately.
Food was just average & the mocktail was over sweetened with the ice cream over flowing the glass.

The restaurant should keep a check on the kind of people they hire on the stewardship as this spoils the complete experience of the guests.

Thumbs up for the ambience. Roof top cafe with a full view of kolkata. I have been to this place multiple times during weekend evenings and I always found a flute player playing rabindra sangeet. 
This place is a bit expensive but perfect for a date or a hang out with friends. 
Located near to Sim Park-15th floor of Hotel Lindsay. Food is average and service is pretty good.

The blue sky above and beyond that, good food, soft breeze, the right kind of music and a view of Kolkata from the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay. This place with it's outdoor seating is beautifully romantic. We had ordered Mahi Afghani and Chicken Teriyaki both of which tasted amazing. The Kung Pao Sizzler was ordinary but the yummy Apple Tart very much made up for it. A lovely experience!

I have always had a soft corner for rooftops in particular! This in particular is one of my all-time favourites. The view is spectacular and a delight during sultry summer evenings!

A cosy decor, lovely breeze and the surround-view of Kolkata's old world charm will pump up your dull evenings!

Coming to food, loved their teriyakki chicken in appetizers and kung pao chicken in sizzlers.. 

This place will suddenly help you beat the "blues" and give you an experience "beyond" food.

Lovely rooftop restaurant.. though unluckily we went on a stormy evening .. hence had to sit inside.. but still we stood outside for sometime and it was beautiful.. We had ordered cocktails like Singapore Sling , Manhattan and Long Island iced tea.. all were good..

Regarding the food.. Makai Dahi kebab, Dewangi Platter (assorted kebabs) were okay but best was the veg. sizzler named "Mexican Mariachhi". It was absolutely delicious..

we had also tried "caramel custard with icecream".. It was pathetic.. It was bitter!!!!! Definitely not recommended..

Overall a good experience apart from a few loopholes here and there... :)

What to say, about this restaurant, location was perfect for couples on top of terrace of 10 storied building of Lindsay hotel , breezy atmosphere would certainly make your evening with your loved one; however when it comes to food, I wonder how a restaurant can prepare food without taste, I ordered veg food which honestly was tasteless, being vegetarian I would not comment on non vegetarian item. But, honestly they should improve theirs food quality which is predominantly most important for any restaurant.

Blue n beyond, located on the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay, adjacent to Hogg Market, is a nice place to spend an evening especially on a cool breezy day. The rooftop seating arrangement is what makes it special. Though they have indoor seating arrangement, their USP is the former. 
Coming to the food, Chicken teriyaki was good,  but the were serving only draught beer on the day. 
Overall good place to hangout after a sultry n sweaty summer day.

We ordered teriyaki chicken, taste was average, mocktails we tried and it was as usual, as a whole like this place coz of its ambiance on a roof top. So will suggest everyone to try, nice place to spend time... and one more thing service was very good... all were very polite... üëåüèª

The highlight of this place is its ambience and location, you would be disappointed if you go in search of tasty food, as food is extremely average here. Even the basic lime soda doesn't taste good
Barring food, everything else is perfect
Try grabbing the tall chairs towards the side. It will give an amazing view of victoria memorial, second howrah bridge and Indian museum.

If one wants‚Äã to get a breathtaking view of Kolkata, please head to Blue and Beyond. It's the place to be. The rooftop seating on the 9th floor of Lindsay Hotel is one of its kind in Kolkata. They have arrangements for candlelight dinner for couples. Well had gone with a friend. Ordered Budweiser beer and Lassi. For food, ordered cheese kurkure and mixed grill-- London House. Both the dishes were prepared to perfection. A huge shoutout to Manoj for his excellent hospitality and awesome service. Would definitely love to visit again.

Blue and Beyond is one of those restaurants with a rich heritage, that has been renovated in recent times.
LOCATION- Top floor, Hotel Lindsay, Lindsay street.
DECORUM AND AMBIENCE- It is probably the No. 1 destination for foodie couples for a candlelight dinner in a romantic setting in the city right now. The rooftop from so many floors above offers panoramic view of the central Kolkata...the music takes the experience a few notches higher too. The day being the Chrismas, we had to wait for 20 mins in their waiting room before being directed to the rooftop seating.
FOOD- Overall not upto the mark. Mostly the quantity of food served really bothered us.
1. Crispy Chilly Babycorn- Tasty... Dont expect anything exceptional though.
2. Teriyaki chicken- Boneless chicken cooked in ginger soya sauce and honey...their signature item...succulent and delicious...but well, the size of the pieces were disappointing.
3. Dum ka Murgh and Kadai chicken-
Amount was lower than what they serve in other restaurants at this price range. Both of the items lacked taste or aroma...seemed to be hurriedly prepared.
4. Mutton Rogan Josh and Indian bread (butter naan)-
Rich, moist and palatable...we ordered a second serving of this mutton item since we were unsatisfied with the chicken preparations. The amount served again was low.
5. Darsaan with ice and Fresh Lime soda-
Deep fried honeyed wanton strips served with ice cream...lip smacking as it should be. But the disappointing fact is that most of the other desserts on the menu like Shahi Tukda, Tutti Frutti, and their famous Faluda with Pistachio ice cream were unavailable. Fresh lime soda was okayish.
SERVICE- Poor. The place seemed to be understaffed. The servers seemed to be too busy. We had to keep calling them again and again to note orders. The service was slow...it reeked of inefficiency. The servers dint bother to serve us on the plate until we requested them to do so.
Overall , the restaurant dint meet my expectations from it. The items were grossly overpriced (over and above what was mentioned in the menu card) , may be because it was the 25th of december. The servers surely need training...would hope the management will pull up their acts together.

Beautiful roof top seating, overlooking the city. We went here on sat night around, 830 and were just in time before it got too crowded. The table was too small for two people and the waiter even spilled one of our drinks. The service was slow. However the food met expectation but the service killed the hunger pangs.

Went there on a summer evening with a friend of mine. At first we opted for outdoor seating but didn't like the weather so went inside. It's a terrace turned restaurant so outdoor space was much bigger than their air conditioned space inside. Food was expensive as well as the drinks. The service was pretty slow but the staff was courteous enough. Will visit this place only on winters.

Great venue. The place looks good. Food is nice. But if you are going for the outdoor seating then you might wanna skip the noon time. Until 2:30 it's not quite greeting because of the heat. But after sun down the lighting up there will totally make your day. Plus the view is nice. And it's near simpark mall. And food is okay. 

But the chicken teriyaki is great. Blue and beyond mocktail is nice.

Went there few weeks back. It was a windy evening and the rooftop seemed so perfect. The seating, the lights etc made a perfect ambience. 

Booze was priced reasonably. The service was also great.

You can also smoke right from your seat - something that smokers miss a lot these days in various bars and pubs.

But the food is bad. I didn't try any main course, I meant the usual starters that you have with booze... I tried out tandoori and lat me kai.... Both were bad, non standard and not well done. 

The complementary cheeslings saved the day. 

Over all the ambience is great if the weather is great, the booze with smoke feels quite perfect, just the starters played spoilsport.

We had 2 drinks pasta and the chicken preparation which is made with red wine. The food was good but the price was not budget friendly. However there was no rush and we could sit there as long as we want.

Went here 2 years back on valentine's day. A lovely ambience when you enter the gallery leading to the restaurant. It has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement. We ordered for crispy chilli babycorn, pesto flavoured penne pasta, blue lagoon and a beer. Babycorn was decent but the pasta tasted very average. Given the quality of food, I found the restaurant overly priced.

Wonderful ambiance and the rooftop view is great.The stuffed mushroom, Lamb Chop Sizzler were good and tasty.But the fish in Nicoise salad, one of my wife's favourite salad, turned out real bad and had to be changed. Request from my end to check the dishes like salads specially - salads needs special checking as the ingredients are served mostly in uncooked state - and a bad ingridient like in our case can play serious spoilsport.No complain about the chicken stroganoff which was the replacement.No complain about the quality of service.

The food is quite good however I was disappointed when the famous teriyaki chicken turned out to be quite too salty and not at all holo to the mark... But the cold coffee with ice cream and the sizzling hoy brownie with vanilla ice cream was just too too fantastic to make me keo complaining... The service is good and a good place to hang out with your partner.

A very convenient metric of rating a restaurant is Quality*Ambience*Service/(Price)^3.¬†
Blue and Beyond is overpriced.
The quality of food is better in any "para" restaurant, to be honest. The non-veg mixed London House sizzler was as much a London House as Kolkata is London. ¬†Mashed potatoes and boiled carrot with chicken stew (or broth) served on a massive cabbage leaf. If you look hard, really hard, you could find a couple of alpenlibe sized sausage pieces drowned in the stew. And a boneful¬†of lamb piece. The Teriyaki chicken was better though. The Manhattan tasted like Kalighat. ¬†I mean who messes up a Manhattan?¬†

The service. Hmm. We had to order our food thrice. To three different waiters. Ask for water. Thrice. ¬†Weren't allowed to sit where we wanted to, on the pretext of "It's a Friday, we keep this for a bigger party." And then a very big party of one and a half people got to sit there!¬†

The view is ordinary. The actual block of interest is blocked. Still. That's the best part of Blue and Beyond. But not worth it. ¬†The numerator stoops down, the denominator surges.

Just an exorbitant and expensive place that compromises on quality, quantity as well as taste. All the items were overpriced, the food was distasteful, the view too isn't to drool for! To begin with, they didn't serve us water, we weren't allowed to sit where we wanted to and fifteen minutes after having ordered we had somebody come over to take down the order again. The Manhattans we ordered tasted nothing like the cocktail is supposed to, and the mixed non veg London House sizzler was just carrots and potato mash and meat stew. The Teriyaki chicken was still sort of edible but given the price, I would rate the item a big zero. We were extremely disappointed! If the prices are soaring, the quality and taste should be matched! I would recommend overlooking the glitz and glam of the place because it is way below expectations.

** Location =Top of Hotel Lindsay at New Market.

**Brief = It was my Valentine's Day visit with Triasha Banerjee¬† hence it has a special value ofcourse !

** Ambiance = Awesome view from the top, fabulous decor owing to the special date and top notch attentiveness from the servers. And we chose to sit in the open terrace. Sorry not much photography was possible that day :D

** Things tried = Chicken Teriyaki and soft drinks as starters.
The teriyaki was just too good, served piping hot.

Then we opted for two portions of chicken rice, one schezwan chicken and the other a garlic chicken. 
The quantity was enough for 2 and we had a great time having the food with the cosy music giving a pleasant and romantic feel to the occasion. We had chocolate ice cream for desserts.

**Recommended = Chicken Teriyaki, Hot Garlic Chicken.¬†

** Purse Check = Our Bill came around Rs.2200/- and I think Rs.1800/- to 2000/- would suffice for 2 persons.

**Overall = Definitely worth giving full marks based on my experience.

Ordered hot and sour chicken soup,chicken teriyaki,crispy lamb,dry chilli chicken and Hakka noodles.Food was average to good. The chicken teriyaki and lamb was pretty good. Though I found the teriyaki on the harder side but the open terrace was bit windy and the wind may add to the hardness,given the fact we took too long to finish off. The service was very good and fast and an extra point for that. Will definitely visit again to taste their continental spread!!!

I visited this restaurant last evening and so here's what i think about the restaurant. 
The interior designing and the overall ambience is their best attribute. The view was great too and they had a really good playlist of songs. However, the service was very poor. We had to repeat orders because the waiters had forgotten or missed noting down the orders. Many of the food, drinks and other items such as the cigars that we wanted to try from the menu could not be described. The food was average. No complaints. Presentation of the food and drinks were decent. Another complaint would be the availability of their beers. We had ordered a tower in which the only draught beer tower available was kingfisher. It was not the brand that bothered us but rather the availability. When we tried to order some more, they ran out of all beers not specifically kinfisher and it was only 7:30 in the evening. So, to conclude my overall experience I give it 3.5. The point 5 because they had given us a 10% discount.

Good view of the city from every side of the rooftop. Overall quite a romantic ambience. I ordered tequila sunrise and it was good. However, the penne pasta in cream sauce was horrible and didn't had any taste. Also, chef had added juliennes of bell peppers of red,yellow and green colors from his own which I am allergic to it. I asked the server and he had no idea what I am speaking about. May be some other time, I'll visit again for a good sunset view and good cocktails only.

Today visited this amazing rooftop restaurant with my boy friend for having a candle light dinner and the location of the place is just superb. This place is ideal for a perfect romantic date with your loved one's under the sky with cool breezes and the awesome view of kolkata from the 9th floor. The dimlight
makes the ambiance more adorable with light background music. The ambiance is really eye catching as well as refreshing.
Coming to the foods, our order includes
SOUP: Sweet corn soup
STARTER: Tengdi kebab
MAIN COURSES: Butter nan With Dal makhani
Jeera rice with Dum ka Murg
DESSERT: Ice cream
The soup tasted quite sweeter but was ok to eat with adding pepper. Tengdi kebab tasted quite good which was very much well going with the served pudina chatni and salad. The dal was nice served with butter toppings. The nan was not very soft so I didn't like it that much. Jeera rice was served with lots of Jeera seeds that made the rice imbalance of flavors. Dum ka murg was nice also. All the foods were just fine but the main attraction of today's dinner was the beautiful ambiance.
The restaurant has good potential if they improve their quality of foods a little bit more. The service was prompt. Overall a great dine in experience and had some great quality time here today. Definitely coming back.

Located next to new market in hotel Lindsay,this place has one of the best rooftops in the city and that is majorly responsible for the awesome ambience...the food and drinks are pretty good, and service decent..definitely recommended,mainly for the ambience and the rooftop view..

This roof top restaurant in the esplanade area has a great ambience. Ordered sula savignon blance (a white wine) and rum mojito (it was wow) as the drinks. Teriyaki chicken and chicken Hawaiian salad as the starter (both were unique). Veg Hakka noodles and hot garlic lamb in the main course. All the food were very tasty. Pocket pinch was slightly high but its okay considering the location of the restaurant..

The ambience is good; the rooftop view obviously adds to the feel. The setup is amazing with the lights after sunset adding to the feel. For the food, starters and dessert are very good. I had Chicken a la Grecque and Grilled Chicken with pear which were very delicious. However, do not have Chicken Stroganoff here; what they call 'Stroganoff' here is not what it's supposed to be. It's basically rice topped with white chicken. The staff are well behaved, an overall decent place to go to.

The ambience is well, perfect and their playlist goes along well too. I heard them play Lynyrd Skynyrd, which is rare considering amount of pop and hip-pop that constantly plays in almost all places around the city.

The food (Crispy Fried Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken and the Chicken Hawaiian Salad) was good but can be better!

The ambience was just awesome. The whole new market is visible from the roof top. Nice place for a romantic date. There was special Valentine's Day menu. We ordered Jack and Rose for starters and Sizzling Troublesome chicken for main course. Food was nice but the price was bit on a higher side. It is a lovely place for a date and a must visit for the couples. Kaushik Paul

Ambience very good. Candle lights, rooftop, nice people, very high and breezy place. Bar available. Food is rubbish. You must be certain whether you are going to pay for ambience or quality of food before visiting thik place. Taryaki chicken is another rubbish dish, sauce and more sauce. Chilly fish I think is better in Suruchi restaurant, tasted horrible. A high price paid for rubbish food. Drink is very costly without reason.

Valentine's Day dinner. It was too crowded and we had to wait for more than half n hour. Then we got ourselves a rooftop seat. We didn't had any starter as we coukd barely understand what is what. We directly ordered main course. Mutton Rogan Josh and Mutton Bhuna Gosht Sizzler with Butter Naan. 
We also ordered Faustino (Spain) wine for the both of us wh@ich we didnt like at all. But still we enjoyed ourselves a lot. Thanks to Blue and Beyond for giving us the opportunity to have ourselves candlelight dinner in the rooftop with great food and music. 
In the end we were so full we didn't order any desert we had sweet lime juice and I had Phillies Chocolate Cigar. 

All together a very nice experience.

The ambience is the only plus..We visited the restaurant on 14th afternoon..Few of the staffs were very cooperative indeed but can't tell the same about everyone,specially when someone from the staff member comes in between our meal and tell us to switch our seat.You should maintain minimum manners and there should have same rule principal for all your customers.anyways moving on to the food we had ordered teriyaki chicken as starter which was average but in the mains we had ordered chilly lamb,which we regret ordering.We had a great expectations from here so we chose to spend the special day here but the experience was pretty disappointing.The rating is only for the great ambience and few of the well mannered staffs.

One of our favorite places to hang out in New Market. Blessed with a fabulous view, this place has the potential for so much more. 
We had the teriyaki chicken for starters, which was succulent and yummy. With this, we had mojitos - the drink was nice but disappointingly small - especially considering the hefty price tag. We had a mixed noodles and chicken in hot garlic sauce as mains. For dessert, we had freshly made hot darsaan with ice cream - delicious! 
The service was attentive and we got our food and drink pretty much on time, except an absurdly long wait for the dessert. 
There was a special Valentines Day menu with insanely funny names for the usual dishes - there was a Ghost Mumtaz which particularly caught our eye!

The prices seemed a bit on the higher side this time, 2500 including our mojitos.

Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend and opted for the rooftoop seating. The place is quite good with an extraordinary view from the 9th floor. We ordered Red Wine shots for startup which was heavenly. It was followed byTequila Sunrise which I didn't like much. For starters we ordered Teriyaki chicken. The chicken was saucy and loaded with flavours and is a must try. For main course we ordered the London House platter. It contained a looooooooot of items starting from shrimps to fish to chicken and sausages. The staff are quite good and would love to visit the place again.

Based on the bullfrog I ordered, it's better to order conventional cocktails like a margarita, which turned out to be fine. Ordered a veg starter platter first. It was kind of below average. Then we ordered a non veg platter. We left it mostly uneaten.

The roof top open air seating is a jewel amidst the busy New market area. It offers a spectacular view and is a great place to hang out or have a romantic date. Among the various things we ordered Chicken Waldorf Salad and Chicken a La Grecque are my personal favorites. Not a big fan of their dessert menu as it offers very limited and regular options.

I and my fiance visited this restaurant yesterday evening.We had ¬†very high expectation from this,since we did hear a lot about their ambiance and all. Starting with the seats they allotted the good seats for 3 people(which was weird since basically couples would choose this place for its romantic ambiance)so we got a really bad seat which we did change and had to sit in the center of the terrace thus we got no view of the city.The music was monotonic,lights were so bad that we couldn't even take pictures and worst was the food.we ordered Chicken chow-min and ¬†kung pao chicken in main course ,it was so bad that we had to pack it and later serve it to our dog.The ambiance is average.The behavior of the staffs were good everything else unsatisfactory.To sum up we were very much disappointed and also it ruined our date night.

The place was awesome.It was actually a romantic place. That's the reason I gave rating 2.5 out of 5!
Because when it comes about the taste of the dishes and the behaviour of the staffs ¬†there is nothing talk about them!¬†
It was a over expensive place. I am not alchoholic so whenever I went any place I prefer foods only. And after went at this place I feel I wasted my 31st Eve...!

They did not have most of the beers listed on the menu, no draughts either. The pints are overpriced. As this was my first time here, I chose to order something very simple, crispy baby corn. It wasn't crispy and it had that vegetable oil smell that you should not be able detect in a place that charges as much as this place does. Also, full set of silverware would be nice. I only got a fork and no spoons or knives. The plates had been sitting in the open before we arrived, gathering all manner of Calcutta dust and grime!

I loved the ambience though, especially after it got a little dark and the fact that the place doesn't hassle you over smoking in the open.

PS the downstairs ladies' restroom toilet had a nasty skid mark in it! I'd expect a decent mid tier hotel like this to have better maintained public facilities.

Far from the madding crowd, this rooftop restaurant is a wonderful place to hangout with friends. The ambience is lovely and they play some really good music in the background that adds to the overall feel of it. We began with cosmopolitan, sangria and virgin colada and for starters, we ordered mahi afghani and teriyaki chicken, both of which were absolutely delicious. Then for main course we went for kung pao chicken sizzler and mixed grilled- london house sizzler. The lamb chop was particularly good and well cooked. Even though we were pretty full by then, we couldn't resist ordering some dessert- sizzling brownie, hot chocolate fudge and american banana split with ice-creams of three flavours. ¬† We were so overwhelmed with this place, the view (which was "to die for"), the food, the ambience, and of course the music, that we ended up ordering another round of dessert because we didn't feel like leaving just yet. This time it was the apple tart and needless to say, it was yum! We had a great time and are really looking forward to visiting this place again.

P.S.: The sunset from the rooftop was exquisitely stunning!

Well, had visited this place at new year. 1st turn down was the staffs did not even wish d customers which supposedly was expected in a decent restaurent. Secondly we sat in the couch, but after sometime we decided to sit elsewhere as sunshine was coming so we started to change then a waiter came and said that we cant. Extremely annoyed we asked the reason, he said the order has been placed with the table number. We said offcourse things can be managed if its bothering the customers. Unfriendly and improper behaviour! The food we ordered were some Hawain Chicken Salad ( which pretty much had only lots of mayonese) and A duck dish (which had only bones)! Quantity was poor which means value for money was nil, dishes were not clean! Only good stuff was the skyline and ambience!

Heard a lot about blue and beyond from a couple of friends and so was very excited to take my husband there when we went to Calcutta during Xmas time. I don't know if it was because of the season holidays or was it regular, but the place was just too crowded!
The tables were piled up right next to each other without any space to move between them. The waiters were rushing around and hardly listening properly. 
The steward who did come to serve us was disappointed that we did not want to order liquor. Apparently everyone has 'drinks' along with food and it's looked down upon if you are not part of the IT drinking crowd. He tried to push the drinks menu thrice on us and on constant denial got very disgruntled as he wasn't getting good business from us.
We ordered their specials - chicken teriyaki for starters and chicken steak sizzler. The steward was all praises for these items. Sadly the teriyaki was swimming in sweet sauce with no other taste viable; and the steak sizzler was not at all cooked well. We wrapped up our dinner within 10minutes and hot footed out of the place with the steward again trying to make us buy drinks. The items were heavily overpriced and not at all worth the amount charged!
Had to end our night with some chicken and egg rolls from the street which were worth the money and definitely better in quality!!

Let's come to the food, we ordered" Chicken teriyaki" followed by Zomato, which was good but not as @expectation..
"Chicken a la Grecque"- This was something so
Unique.. Served grilled breast with good black paper flavour, got a little bit of cheese flavour which was so mouthwatering, veggies like baby corn, carrot, porato,  cabbage was there along with that..
All over I was fallen in love with this place..‚ù§

Amidst the Hussle bustle of New Market, you find this rooftop cafe with an amazing view of the city. I was utterly disappointed with the service. I went with my friends and ordered pitchers which they said was not available for the day. So, we settled for a pint of beer , some cocktails including Old fashion , screw driver and for food we ordered #Deewangi_Platter which had chicken kabab, fish, prawn and lamb. I liked the Platter. Prices are on higher side probably because of the location and ambience. 

P.S - Ambience is the only reason, I'd like to visit for the second time.

Place is amazing. Winter evenings cannot get any better. Food and drinks are are also reasonably priced. Couple of turn offs - parking, slow elevators, unhygienic washrooms. The service is super lousy, half of the time you have to keep your hand raised for minutes to get attended by the forever gossiping waitstaff. Such a waste to the lovely space. Hope management does something to lift up the place.

The food and service is equally good in the heavy rush. The staffs are well trained and well behaved also. We try Indian dish there this was to good and the dessert we order brownie with ice cream sizzler which was too good. I and my friends impressed very much.

Visited this place on 24th December and for very obvious reasons, the place was over-crowded. The staff was courteous and provided us with a nice seat. The ambiance was average. Expected it to be more nice because of the open terrace; but since it was over crowded, the place lost its charm.¬†
Coming to the food, the menu that was shown in Zomato was replaced with some new festival menu which was really annoying. I wanted to opt for Red Wine in glass which was available in the old menu, but the new menu seemed to serve red wine only in bottles. However, the staff arranged a red wine cocktail which was average in taste. The starter was Chicken Terriyaki which was really good. We ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Hot Garlic Chicken in main course. The quantity seemed really less as compared to the price.

Decor s awesome. But not too many items in the menu.

We had ordered for 5-6 items. When my order reached my table, there were no spoons in any of the items. When I asked for spoons, they gave me only one spoon, that too a small one. I had to use the same spoon for all. Food was good, I wont say very good...

A roof top lounge amidst the crowded New market is a pleasant place to be in. The view from the 9th floor is simply breathtaking. Open air lounges are rare in Kolkata and one this truly stands out. The only thing missing here is the Sheesha. Nice ambience, good food and a cozy atmosphere you'll get here.. It is a bit over-priced but a very romantic place for couples to have a peaceful date. N yes, I enjoyed my date too with one of my closest friend. A perfect place to grab a drink with your date.

It's a perfect destination for any romantic date or a dine out with family members. Becomes even sweeter if there is breeze and soft music on the eve. 

Situated at the rooftop of a hotel, Blue and Beyond is a big yes in recommendation..

Looking forward for a place to go for a date with your loved one? This is the place you can opt for. Ambience and service will make you comfortable and cozy.You can experience a good view of the city from the 9th floor. The attenders are helpful and guide you through the menu.
We tried singaporean chilly Crab, which was as appealing to our eyes as to our gastronomy. Crabs are difficult to cook, and this dish was perfectly cooked, the meat tender. It was served as well perfectly, the shells carefully separated and used for garnishing.
Mahi afghani was also good, the fish was fresh and juicy, not very spicy.
There are good variety of cocktails and they can twist them based on your personal preference.
A great place to dine out.

I visited this place with my friends on Christmas Eve.
This place is an ideal destination for couples and the open air restaurant is very nice.
However the food was a big disappointment.
Please don't try food here. They are just charging money for the ambience and food is a big time let down. The food is very expensive and the taste is worse. 
So if you are planning to visit this place, please don't go thinking that you are going for food. You can enjoy your company but not food.

This place is quite popular. Obviously, being located in the hub of Kolkata, this rooftop restaurant has a good view and from the seats we got , the newly rising " The 42" is a great sight.¬†

But the service was terribly bad. We went on the Christmas eve and this was a pathetic experience. We had ordered a couple of drinks and the suggested terriyaki chicken along with some sizzlers. But what place is this where the food comes way before the beers. And the staff should have checked on the stocks, on a Christmas eve they went out of stock of beers. So we had to change our order. Wait some more till the complete order was finally there. Ugggh!!¬†
I didn't mention how much time it took them to bring the bill too. Bunk that.

I admire the ambience alright, but being a popular place in esplanade i certainly feel this should be improved upon.

This place is not good. Ambience is fine. But the servers don't even know the bar stock. They took an order of 3 drinks (beer) and came back with just one and left. When asked as to what happened to the rest of the order they finally confirmed that they had just one bottle. I would not suggest people to come here for drinks.

Negatives-
Indian food tasteless!
Highly overpriced!
Waiters extremely slow!
Service bad!

Positives-
Good view


No point of ordering food one by one as they will literally wait for your next item. 
The papad on which crispy baby corn was served was a nice idea though the papad was tasteless again!

In short one time visit place.

A rooftop restaurant at the heart of City of Joy with a spectacular view of horizon and sunset, what you want extra more from a place to celebrate any occasion of your love one! Been there few days ago to celebrate my Girlfriend‚Äôs birthday. I actually want to surprise her by taking her from a restaurant that will be different from other restaurant, so I choose it.

Location - It is on the top floor of the Hotel, The Lindsay at Lindsay St. Take the lift and go the 8th floor, then an easy direction will take you to the restaurant.

Ambiance - In one word, it is just awesome. There is both indoor and outdoor dining facility is available. Basic chair table and cozy sofa arrangement. Outdoor sitting arrangement is more attractive than the indoor one. You will get spectacular city view from outdoor.

Stuffs and management ‚Äì Well management is fine. After reaching the restaurant they escort us up to the table and give us menu card. Stuffs are all well behaved, polite but less experienced I guess. Cz when putting my order when I ask them to suggest some food, in some section they got little confused, but you can ignored it.

Food ‚Äì We ordered Sula Savignon Blanc and Mojito as a drink. Teriyaki Chicken as a starter and Chicken Hawaiian Salad, Veg Hakka Noodles, Hot Garlic Lamb as a main course and Hot Chocolate Fudge as a desserts.

Sula Savignon Blanc ‚Äì It was my first time to have any kinda white wine. So after discussing with the Stuff boy, with his recommendation we ordered this one. It tastes good at first few sip than it become bitter and bitter towards the end part. Not a good experience to have white wine for the first time. :P

Mojito ‚Äì As a second drink, we ordered this cocktail. White rum with perfect blend of mint leaf and ice, make this one super refreshing. From the first to last sip you will get the taste of refreshment.

Teriyaki Chicken ‚Äì It is one of the most popular dish over here, so we ordered this one. Six pieces boneless chicken was there with a super tasty gravy made by blending Honey and Soya sauce. Chicken pieces were juicy from inside and it tastes good too. Sometime sweet taste and sometime spicy feel make this dish one of the most popular dish. Super recommendation.

Chicken Hawaiian Salad ‚Äì We ordered this one also by discussing with the stuffs. When the dish came, I was fully fall in love with the outer texture of the salad. It looks justified it taste also. Shredded chicken pieces with blend of pineapple, wow what you want more. Perfect mixed with veggies like tomato, lettuce and cheese make this one really delicious. One pineapple ring and cherry on the top of the salad make this dish really attracting one.

Veg Hakka Noodles ‚Äì Thick noodles fried with lots of veggies. Good in taste, not oily in nature, overall good. But one thing that will disappoint you is the quantity of the dish. The quantity is ok for one person but can‚Äôt share it if you are really in empty tummy. Quantity should be increased, otherwise ok.

Hot Garlic Lamb ‚Äì Among the different kinda variant of Lamb like Chilly, Szechuan etc. we choose this one. The dish is really good and goes well with the Hakka noodles. Little garnishing on top looks well. Lamb pieces are juicy and really feel tender in mouth. Gravy is also suitable for any kinda rice or noodles. Little sweet, little spicy in nature goes well.

Hot Chocolate Fudge ‚Äì Although we are almost filled in stomach, we still order this one to have a happy ending of our dining. Three vanilla scoop are there with chocolate sauce and Choco chips on top. It really feels like a happy ending when you taste this one. Every vanilla bite you take melts in your mouth with an additional flavor of Choco sauces and chips make this is heavenly one. Super recommendation.

In conclusion it is obvious that Blue and Beyond is one of the best Rooftop restaurant in the city. With all the food mentioned above it cost only 2.4K INR which is really and affordable one. They added very little amount of VAT and Service TAX, no additional charges are there which is really a nice one. Perfect food at affordable, rooftop, awesome view of city all these make this restaurant an ideal place for dining with your love one and spend some quality time. Will visit this restaurant again and again.

Coming to the food .. We ordered chicken lat me kai ..it was good. But the chicken and pomfret ¬†sizzlers were an absolute delight. The chicken pieces were tender and juicy and the fish almost melted in our mouth , well prepared and fresh. The cherry on the cake was the vanilla custard. It was perfectly sweet and came with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream

MAIN FEATURES¬†

1. A Very rare restaurant at 9th floor
2. open air seating
3. romantic , occasional live violin

a places in the crowd but way above it.

ambience ::

a hot shot place . not very crowded yet soo very cosy. the seating the view the chairs all will give you a feel like you are Europe.

the waiters are good and helpful .

food::

now here is a hiccup.

its relatively much more costly than average , ¬†lowest is 250 for a coffee, but they worth it.¬†

other food items are not that unusual , mediocre.

anything special??

the view of old Kolkata¬†from the rooftop, a rare for people like us, a place where we can shoot a serials episode ,
¬†

go have a blast .

Ambiance is catching but the food I found worst than anything. Disappointed in my first visit. A simple non veg plater costs 550.00 served as cold as ice and not pice worthy at all. Srvixe tax and Vat calculation is incorrect, though didn't go into conflict. S tax is already  included in package water by the Govt but here you gotta pay again 55+20.05% . Not well trained staffs. All together the trustworthiness has come to its nadir.

Heard a lot about this place, waited a long for going there. After visiting this place I got dissapointed... When we reached there was one was outside who would escort us to the tabel. We got inside then decided to seat outside under the sky.  After some time an attendee came with menu card, we ordered teriyaki chicken which is a preparation of chicken saute with garlic,seaseme seed and honey, tandoori roti, chicken dum ka murg and muddy water which is a preparation of chocolate milk shake served with chocolate syrup. They gave us a plate which was full of dust. I took a tissue and rubbed the plated very well, that tissue literally filled with dust. Quality is ok, quantity is very less. Pices of chicken in chicken dum ka murg was like popcorn size. Price is little high if you judge this place on the basis of quality and quantity. Service is bit slow. They even took 15 to 20 minutes to get us the menu card. I will rate this place on the basis of 5 points, which are:
Ambience : 1/1
Service : 0.5/1
Quality : 1/1
Quantity : 0.5/1
Price : 0.5/1

Overall : 3.5/5

We ordered the chicken a la Grecque but the chicken was so hard we could hardly bite into it. We left the place without eating anything.

The place is located at the 9th floor of Lindsay Hotel,near Simpark mall. It is an equal distance from both Esplanade and Park Street Metro

The open air seating is perfect for winter days. You can spot a view of the Howrah Bridge and enjoy the kolkata skyline. The seats are comfortable. However at 1:30 p.m,they were still cleaning and setting up. Moreover they suddenly started playing some generic music at 3p.m which we found a little absurd.

The Chicken Teriyaki as suggested by zomato was delicious and cooked to perfection.

The mixed grill London style had perfectly cooked meat and vegetables,only marred slightly by an obese bland boiled potato.

The bill was 1048.  They gave us change upon giving them the new 2000/- notes.

The weather was perfect so we sat in the open air area and I have to say it was really breezy and peaceful with a great view. It was 1.30pm but the restaurant hadn't opened properly then with people still arranging chairs and cleaning up. We ordered the much-in-demand Teriyaki chicken and were not disappointed. It was soft and the sauce tasted great. Then we ordered the London Special Mixed grill which came sizzling on our table so plus points for that. The fish and prawns were well cooked but the mutton was a little chewy. Also the jacket potato side was just that, a boiled potato with no seasoning or flavour. The bill came to be around 1040/-. All in all, with the pleasant open air ambience and the food, it was a more than satisfying experience.

The place Blue and Beyond quite suits the name... Star studded sky above.. with dim light all around and arrangement for candle light for couples looking for that romantic quotient..set on the terrace of 9 storey Hotel Lindsay.. amidst one of Kolkata's busiest street but the noise won't play a dampener for that perfect romantic date..  I visited Kolkata after a couple of years and wanted to catch up with my friends so we decided to visit this place on 22nd November 2016.. my first impression was pretty positive basis the decor.. the crowd and hospitality.. We ordered a beer tower and drums of heaven.. and we purchased buffet dinner.. which had an option for non veg soup.. one starter.. jeera rice.. butter naan... Dum murgh.. and chocolate ice cream... being a Tuesday, still the restaurant was pretty much occupied with approximately around 25 guests.. however service was pretty fast.. and food was good,tasty and fresh.. the only turn on was that they won't let you stay after 11pm at all.. in fact they had even got our beer packed as parcel as there was a lot left... over all a good place to spend time with your better half or catch up with your friends.. but as per me strictly during winters...

Just a request to the management that please try to keep the place open at least till midnight otherwise it acts as a mood spoiler.. Rest I had a good experience...

Blue and Beyond has been in my wish list for a long long time. Upon entering the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay in the lobby you'll find a beautiful black and white photo gallery of eminent Bengali personalities - reminding you of the rich heritage of this very city. It was kind of exhilarating for us as we were totally unaware of its existence.

Anyway, The restaurant. It has 3 sitting areas - the bar, the open air sitting, and the other is a tiny dine in facility looking upon Central Kolkata, the Vidyasagar Setu and even the Indian Museum. That, I swear, is a view to engorge after the sun goes down!
We chose the latter one as it was afternoon, and of course it was hot outside. üòê

Now coming to food, we ordered :

üî∏Chicken Teriyaki as suggested in Zomato - it is one of the best I've had in a while. Period.

üî∏Chicken a la Grecque and Grilled Lamb Chops - both came with a side of sauteed veggies and a weird tasteless boiled potato with skin on or as they call it 'jacket potato'. The proteins were soft, succulent and delish, though I didn't quite get the jacket potatoes !

üî∏Their namesake mocktail was a total disappointment. The topping of vanilla ice-cream was totally melting making it a really gooey affair. üòë

The service was poor. Though. The staffs are nice. The food is good. The ambience is great. This is indeed one of those rare restaurants in Calcutta which is perfect for date nights. üòã

I was planning to visit this place since a long time. Finally visited the place yesterday on a very special day with one of my friends. The ambience was mind blowing as I expected or rather more than I expected. The dimmed light, the breeze on the rooftop and the lovely tune of flute made the ambience romantic. It's the best place to visit with your partner specially after evening. Food quality and quantity was good. This place made my day :)

This¬† is one of the oldest pub in Kolkata since a decade located on the 9th floor of the Lindsay hotel - recommended by couple of friends. Visited with my cousin last saturday evening to enjoy their outdoor seating overlooking the city of joy. But unfortunately due to rains, we have to opt for the indoor cozy seating arrangement with a small bar. Ordered prawn cocktail which tasted very delicious. I like the long corridor that ways to the lounge which has an amazing array of black and white photo display from old bengals, cinemas which will really make anyone very nostalgic. Appreciate their warm hospitality towards the guests.

The good old calcutta with british made buildings surrounded , this place is right at the top of hotel lindsay opposite to ss hogg market. A classic roof top restaurant to be precise. It earns the brownie points while entering - series of photographs depicting old bengali and hindi movies as well as never to be forgotten personalities. A food joint below the blue sky- increases the appetite. The menu has a wide range of food. Went for a lunch and a soup is must to start for me. The tomyum soup has a great taste with perfect combo of pungent and sour spices. The winner is the burmese dish- chicken khawsuey , first time i had in kolkata- takes me to the memory of sabyasachi at rengoon in pother daabi. A must try i must say. Sizzlers are also good. Service is excellent as well as the time they take to serve. Kolkata excels in food - this place gives the perfect example.

It was on diwali occasion and we got a lovely window seat in the a.c room. But the chairs were not good to feel comfortable. The ambiance was altogether very pleasing. The food served to us were more or less good and quite pleasing in terms of quantity. Especially the preparation of afghani gost was mouth watering. But it was disappointing again to wait for water. The waiters were more concerned on the order and perhaps less attentive of their duty. Attention could have been given on a very few particular things like tissues, the spoons (had to ask for it for two times), and the dishes where the foods were needed to be served with a little decency. The taste of all foods was worth to pay. The ambiance calls us again to visit. Hope next time I shall score a 5 on the review card with no complaints.

The lunch experience was quite pleasant,being a rooftop restaurant one can have a very good view of the area from here. They had both outdoor and indoor seatings,since it was a a bit hot so preferred to have indoor seating. The ambience was quite good and even the food was also tasty.
Overall experience was quite pleasant.

First things first! This place has a spectacular view!!!! S.P.E.C.T.A.C.U.L.A.R is the word. Food wise, this place is little on the higher side. But a mug of beer with fries on backdrop sun setting on behind the victoria memorial...is just breathtaking. More than food one should visit this place for its ambience and view.

Hearing a lot about about this place, the roof top seating and the view, we friends arranged for a mini reunion here around three years back, in around 2013. Unfortunately, the roof top part was under renovation then and we had to sit indoors.
We sat in the table with high bar stools at the far end.
Food was good but kind of pricey. The way to the washroom was not very great.
Would like to visit again though for the outdoor seating and revisiting the memories...

I see this place has got good ratings but my experience at this place was extremely disappointing. Went there on ashtami afternoon for lunch. Our main attraction was the rooftop ambience of this place. But we were not offered a seat there.  When we asked for one they told us that at that moment they weren't serving there. But we later found out that one table was already occupied. Instead they had offered us  a table on the topmost floor. It was just like a hall with a few tables. We asked for a table beside the window which could accommodate 4 persons. They were reluctant at that too and told us to sit at a table for 2, though all the tables were available at that time. 
Next coming to the menu..  The menu they are displaying in zomato is not valid during the puja days.  Instead they gave us a puja special menu with a lot less items in it.. The menu card looked like they were selling street food. 
The service was also not good. When you go to such expensive places you at least expect the waiter at your table to serve you good. We weren't even served by a waiter. We had to call them to take our orders. And the one who came to us had a face with a frustrating expression and sheer reluctance. 
We thought again and again to leave the place, but just for the sake of decency we ordered a foster pint and a plate of crispy baby corn . Price for only that too came out to be Rs 461. Such expensive is this place. 
Allover, it was an all round bad experience. We actually went for a romantic date on a romantic  occasion with very high hopes. But we had to leave this place with utter disgust and disrespect. 
Blue and BEYOND disappointed me BEYOND expectations.

The best thing about this restaurant is the view of Kolkata. The service was poor for hotel standards, we had to get up and walk inside to get the waiter's attention. The food was good but portion size was abit small. One thing I would suggest is a sun shade in the pergola as the clear plastic makes the seating area too hot for people who want to be outside to enjoy the views. Overall, the views were stunning, seeing Hooghly bridge and Victoria memorial was a highlight!  I would go back again for the view experience.

Planned to visit this place for months but got postponed due to rain ‚òîÔ∏è as my only reason to visit this restaurant was rooftop open air seating experience! And it was worth it.

Unlike pictures the rooftop seating area is not that large but spacious enough. The view of New Market from the rooftop is amazing (üì∑ Coming soon on Instagram). You can even see Howrah Bridge from there.

All that said, ambiance is 5/5 !

Coming to food, will provide the feedback below:

‚Ä¢ Konjee Crispy Lamb: Tastes okay, nothing like Flavors of China's

‚Ä¢ Chicken Hot Garlic: Tastes good

‚Ä¢ Veg Fried Rice: Generic in taste but notable thing to mention is the quantity. It's is really less compared to any other restaurants in Kolkata. For 2 remember to order 2!

Rating for Food considering taste and value for money: 2/5

Stewards were very good and friendly - 5/5 üòä 

Overall nice lunch üç¥ experience and next time will go for dinner!

The late lunch at Blue and Beyond in new market was a beautiful experience. This is a roof top restaurant with an open air seating as well as an indoor seating. The ambiance is exceptionally romantic and good. The sunset looks amazing from this place. And in the late evening the city lights look beautiful. Old country music and a nice sip of cocktail is what this food delivers. The staffs are very courteous and helpful. We had a konjee crispy lamb which was tasty and the lambs were quite soft. We had also ordered a chicken fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce. Both the dishes were rich in flavours. More than the food the ambiance will make you want to visit this place over and over again. A little on the costlier side this place is a sure recommendation for everyone. :)

First impression you get over there is "kolkata has a new look". I liked everything about the place it's a nice hangout with friends as well as a romantic place for the beautiful evening. I liked the food. The service was courteous. The interior and the outdoor area was also good. I sat there first thing I ordered was chicken manchow soup. It was not exactly manchow but it was good. For snacks drums of heaven was ordered and it was good. Maincourse was lovely with a lovely romantic weather to accompany. I would suggest you guys to at least visit the place once with friends or your partner. You would definitely go there again.

Probably they're most beautifully renovated hotel in Calcutta. While coming down from the 9th floor of their restaurant I realised how beautifully they have preserved the culture of Bengal and made the corridors of hotel very beautiful, but we are here to talk about FOOD!
The restaurant is charming with a good old ambience. We have ordered the LIT the friendly mock tail and Sangria. 

It's the worst Sangria I've ever had in my life. Sangria the Spanish mock tail is made by preserving the red/white wine with some fruits overnight. But they have served the Sangria with cut pieces of Apple,which was probably made 5minutes after the order with chilled red wine taken out from the refrigerator. They don't even have white wine sangria, neither a pitcher for sangria which is a shame. 

The starter we have ordered was Drums of Heaven which was decent but I had Diarrhea issues after having that in the next morning. Sorry for giving you the update about that, but I am trying to make you careful.

The staffs are well behaved but not so well trained and smart which is at least expected in a very nicely decorated and posh looking restaurant. 

B&B You need a huge renovation on your drinks and food section ! Do that and I'll edit my review then.

This restaurant can be categorized as one of the best ambiance in the city. Situated at the rooftop of Hotel Lindsay, it is a photographer's dream. You will almost every view of Kolkata you ever dreamed of. The food is good, the service is better than expected, and the cost is affordable. Just one negative point, there was no item of ice cream at the time I visited. But afterall everything can be compromised just because of the ambiance. I wish to visit again.

Blue and Beyond is an experience.Not a restaurant.
Located way high up on an open balcony, the ambience is beautiful. With the cool evening air rippling through your hair, you can enjoy the food and drinks with your loved ones. The food is not something extraordinary, but its not very bad either. My lamb chops were especially delicious. The drinks are well made and perfectly enjoyable as you sit gazing at the city adorned in its lights under the night sky. 
Go there just to experience eating under no roof.

A visit to Blue & Beyond was long due.¬†

The USP of this place is it's super romantic ambiance on the open terrace. However, it is recommended you always visit for dinner otherwise the whole charm is lost.

We were there on a Saturday evening and the place was almost full.¬†

We ordered beer, Screwdriver, Reshmi Kebab, Drums of heaven, Chicken a la grecque sizzler, Tandoori roti, Butter naan & Kadhai Murg.

The Screwdriver that I got was a glass full of ice with a faint yellow liquid at the bottom. After stirring the liquid part, the drink looked like a light yellow syrup. I tasted it to find there was not a hint of orange juice or vodka!¬†

On raising the concern to a senior staff, he made a face as if we were ignorant about the cocktail!¬†
Now, all three of us being from the Hotel industry (studied in a premier institute & having worked in premier hotels of India), we have decent knowledge & experience in the dine & wine sector. Hence we refused to accept that drink as a screwdriver & returned it. ¬†The replacement that we got had a strong flavor of Vodka but again full of ice and some yellow syrup which was anything but ¬†orange juice!!! They could have just said that they were running out of orange juice packs!¬†

Anyway, we decided to let it go. We proceeded to the starters & main course which were pretty good. Kadhai Murg was finger licking.

Service is awful. The waiters weren't even serving the dishes unless we were asking for it.¬†

Portion is sufficient. Price little bit on the higher side.

The rooftop experience here is a must for everyone.

Located at the heart of the city,it doesn't get any better.

Prices are marginally on the higher side compared to other such places but nothing too OTT.

The collection is not bad but not all drinks on the menu are available every time.

But B&B is a place everyone must visit at least once.

Disappointing. Great Food and courteous service - but very smelly, hot and humid in the open and even more smelly inside the area which is air conditioned. Went on a Saturday night and the AC part was so smelly there wasnt a single soul sitting there. Sat in the outdoor area which is inadequately lighted and very humid due to the absence of fans. The food was excellent (10/10 for pan fried veg noodles and 7/10 for the veg mexican sizzler) and service was very good and fast - but the ambience is a total dampener. Regret going there, at least during summers

It was a sudden plan and meet up with a friend. My friend suggested this place as he had been there quite often and fir the open terrace sitting arrangements. But unluckily it was drizzling so we had to sit inside.. Where afterwards we shift our sit to open terrace when it stopped drizzling. The view is pretty nice! Coming to food.. It has got variety of drinks, we ordered long Island tea which came with a bowl of cheeselings, French fries and one chicken side dish. Didn't try there any main course food. Had sizzler and chocolate ice cream which was pretty fine! Overall a nice experience.

Landed on a rainy day so was unfortunate enough to sit outdoor. However the sitting arrangements inside isn't that good. It was just a small room wth some couches and big wooden table. Coming to the food we ordered afganifish which tasted good. Teriyarki chicken was something which i did not like much. The chicken isn't  that soft. The soda lime which was quite sour was replaced by the waiter after we complained. There was music only for outdoor sitting and not for indoors. Service was quick though and the price is also reasonable.

Forget the food you have to go there just for the view and the ambience. Sitting on the roof of the¬†tenth floor you can see the Kolkata skyline, the Howrah bridge, Vidyasagar Setu. You also have the option to sit inside the room the decor of which is also good. The food is good. Don't expect some extraordinary food. The behaviour of the staffs were also good and caring. ¬†So you must visit once to have the view. Choose a breezy¬†soothing weather to sit outside.

Great place for having drinks with friends...place makes some awesome cocktails..personally their rendition of tequila sunrise is a winner. Blue and Beyond did justice to the name as even though¬† it's situated in the most bustling and chaotic¬† part of the city, the New Market area opposite Hogg market, yet it provides sort of a sweet escape from all these discordence. Open air, Rooftop..situated at the top of the Lindsay Hotel, the restaurant is bound to provide a surreal experience with musical performance daily evening. However the food is so so ..But when it comes to blue and beyond it's less about food but more about having a relaxed laidback evening with a few drinks with friends.

The ambiance was great. You would simply love the rooftop. 
The foods are delicious too. But the thing that turned me off was that they ran out of certain beers. I don't really expect a bar to run out of regular booze, that's something that should never ever happen. So, we had thought of ordering draught beer and asked for a 3000 ml one, and a while later they let us know that they can not serve that, then we were left with no choice other than asking for Pints, so we asked for Heineken Pints, to which they apologised for not having Heineken in their stock. We had to settle for something else. It probably was not a big deal, yet so disappointing.
However, the staffs are very polite and the service is pretty fast. 
So, if you want to watch our beautiful Kolkata from as high a terrace as 9th floor while sipping your favourite drink, you surely should check out this place. I am sure you would love it in there.

Located in one of the busiest areas of Kolkata - New Market. Roof top restaurant and hence the view it offers is stunning and of course the ambience as well is amazing. Service was quick and good. However, the quality of the food was disappointing. Everything from starters to main course was below expectation. Pricing is right for the ambience but not for the food. I would recommend this place for a drink in the evening and probably stop for dinner in one of those late night eat outs.

After work I dropped in at this rooftop cafe with my friend in the evening. Its located on the 10th floor of hotel Lindsay and from the roof you have an amazing view of the city along with howrah bridge. We ordered for Chinese Mixed Noddles which was little spicy and quantity was sufficient for one person. In drinks we wanted to have Draught Beer Tower but due to unavailability we had Tuborg Beer Pint. The staffs are polite and helpful too.

But for drinks, we ordered Glenfiddich but unfortunately the waiter heard it as JD and served the same. We have to keep ourselves satisfied with JD. But overall it was a very nice experience.¬† Will visit again. :)

The location is exceptionally good, located in the midst of the very crowded new market. We ordered some drinks, chicken sizzler. Food was good, but the catch was the ambience. Absolutely amazing is the word. Won't really mind munching on some chicken lollipop and watching the city lights from up above. :)

Been here twice,
yet to understand a bit more about this place.
Shall make it simple for all of you to feel what I have felt being there.

Pros:

1. Its in the middle of the busy and buzzing lindsay area.. so it worked very well ...location wise and as a prompt call

2. Its within a decent property

3. The 9th floor lobby is too well done though in a simple way

4. There are options of both indoor & outdoor seating

5. The interiors and seating arrangements.. overall look and feel of the place would stay in your mind

6. You cant beat the terrace view of the city and the Howrah Bridge

7. Serving boys are well mannered and trained

8. Alcohol availability was Moderate

Cons:

1. The theme of lobby and the seating space have a big disconnect and seems like different properties

2. May be the Pathway markings could be done better throughout the lift door - stairs - indoors - outdoors

3. Had a feeling... they are not too good with the food options...may be more visits and more dishes could tell that better

4. There should be discounts for people consuming more... foodwise or alcoholwise

This place deserves a 3.5* but I finally had to give it an exXtra .5* because of the cool breeze I enjoyed on the terrace keeping Howrah bridge on my horizon.

*I didnt experience their Banquet service though

Awesome place.. It's a rooftop restaurant cum bar with a wonderful view of the heritages of the city of joy... There's live music in the evening.. Whether with friends or boyfriend / girlfriend, if you want to spend some quality time and enjoy serenity leaving aside the everyday hustle and bustle, this place is a must visit.. Though slightly high priced, but you would love everything else about this place... And if someone is there to sponsor you, then you'll definitely not be willing to leave this place.. üòú

Loacted on the 9th floor of Lindsay hotel this olace offers a great skyline view of our city. There are both indoor and outdoor sitting facilities. The food is great. The play live music on tuesdays. Their draught beer is a steal for money. As a tower of draught beer costs around 1k. A perfect place for a date as well as hang outs. They even serve you ciggaretes. Pocket pinch for two would be 1.5k(without alchohol) 2-2.5k (with alchohol)

Have been on my wish list for a long time and after all the buzz and fuss managed to get there yesterday for dinner and to celebrate a friend's birthday. The rooftop is a beautiful and a perfect romantic setup with a beautiful view of the city skyline. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious but a little less in quantity,it was okay though and the drinks were exquisite.
We ordered a Mojito, cranberry saga, crispy chilli baby corn and a grilled chicken sausage with pears sizzler. Not a single dish failed to delight. Happy and pleased with the experience.

Looking for an ambience for a quite drink and food with friends or loved ones... there are a very few places as good as this. It's a rooftop restro bar overlooking central Kolkata from the 9th floor. What else to say. Comfortable sitting and amicable waiters... the food is standard as well. The feel of the cool breeze while enjoying a drink is exquisite. Rates are on the higher side but will make up for the location rather than the food. Overall a great romantic place for a dinner.

Situated in the heart of the New Market area (Lindsay Hotel- opposite the Sim Park Mall), this place is pretty easy to find once you know what you're looking for. 

We went in around 6 in the evening in a pretty large group of around 10 on a weekday and they had no problems accommodating us without prior booking. The first thing that catches your imagination about this place is the ambiance. Located on top of probably the ninth floor of a building in the heart of the city- the view is magnificent. Luckily enough, the weather was pretty fabulous that day too, so that went well. 

We ordered multiple helpings of the chicken teriyaki, lat me kai, drums of heaven and reshmi kebabs along with beer towers. The teriyaki was pretty unique in the way it was presented and tasted good. The lat me kai was decent as well. I did not find the drumsticks much appealing to my taste, but the reshmi kebabs again were good as usual.¬†
The service was good. You can smoke at your tables. And the pocket pinch is substantial but understandable.¬†
I would've given 3.5 rating but the extra 0.5 for the amazing view of the city skyline from up high.¬†

p.s. the entrance is pretty unique as well- you walk through a couple of rooms with photos of old Calcutta and superstars of yester-years put up all around you.

PS: Check out their cool range of Cigars, dunno if they still offer it.

I would rate this place very good if not for the slightly overpriced menu and the problem in spotting it for most bypassers. Having stayed in Kolkata and knowing the new market area, one generally knows about Lindsay hotel but it's difficult to know that it has an open air restaurant at the terrace. Nice ambience, beautiful views and good decor. One of the nicer open air restaurants in Kolkata.

This rooftop food hub is one of the best in its class. Designed for special occassions this place provides the perfect ambience for long hours of talk under the sky while enjoying the city lights. The food also are quite descent. We had CHICKEN TERIYAKI (3.5/5), MAHI AFGANI (3.5/5), GRILLED LAMB CHOPS SIZZLER (3.5/5) and THAI PANEER SASHLIK (2.5/5). What is really  impressive about this place is the location, the arrangment and if both the old gods and the new gods have their blessings upon you, then you may even get to enjoy a live violene performance playing some of the old classics on sunday evenings.

Given a bong that I am bong, who loves his 'adda' and beer on a given Friday afternoon too much, I decided to explore this place which I have so much heard about. Accompanied by my best friend, I decided to drop by this roof-top 'bangali rock' to catch up with my friend and the rest of the things and the wind atop 10 floors. the panoramic view of my majestic Kolkata, is beyond words. The service has had been superb. Though the place had run out of draught beer, well, how much I have had wished for that, yet the ambience had subdued that. The next time, I wish they keep their barrels full with draughts. A Friday well spent..I hope for many more to come.

Well this resto-bar is famous for its ambiance and we went there to enjoy the ambiance and we did that thoroughly.¬† The open air rooftop dining area has splendid atmosphere, the panoramic view of the city is mesmerising. It is ideal for spending some romantic time. We went there for a small office party and indulged in heavy eating but unfortunately the food items served here failed to impress us. Why the food quality is not at par with the ambiance and the cost?? management should look into it also as the main purpose of a restaurant is to serve good food, not just to provide wonderful ambiance!! We ordered chicken lat me kai, mahi afghani, ajwani jhinga, jhinga was very bad, fish was decent and lat me kai was good. for main course we ordered mutton biriyani, masala kulcha, dum ka murg , mutton rogan josh, none of them has managed to impress us, dum ka murg was one of the worst we ever had, hard, semi boiled chicken in sweet gravy, rogan josh gravy was also very sweet, why so much sweetness is infused within the mughlai dishes who knows! to our surprise the biriyani was also sweet, though one can't expect authentic lucknowi biriyani in such places but sweet pulao like biriyani is not acceptable at all and masala kulchas didnot have much masala inside. overall the main course was disaster. fresh lime soda was good ,on the contrary. During our 2 hours stay we saw that many people came, had some drink and left, may be this place is meant for mainly drinking but that doesnot mean that the food quality have to be such low!¬† The waiters were polite and serving time was relatively quick. per head cost without alcohol was over rs 1000/- which is normal now a days in good restaurants but the management must look into the food quality. My rating is mainly for the ambiance as we didn't enjoy the food..

An amazing rooftop restaurant. As it was quiet sunny, the day we visited so we preferred the indoor sitting. Beautiful view from the ninth floor. Firstly ordered mocktails, Cranberry saga and Blue n Beyond. For the starters Chicken teriyaki and mahi afghani. My personal favorite was chicken teriyaki. For the sizzlers, ordered Chicken a La greque and Kung pao chicken. Each and every dish awesome in taste. The staffs are also very friendly and attaintive. Finally ordered a cup of vallina ice cream. would love to visit again. thumbs up for the place.

This is a place defined by its ambience...especially the panoramic view of Kolkata you get. Unluckily for me,the terrace was closed that day.
So I ordered a teriyaki chicken,a crispy conjee lamb and my friends ordered a tom yum soup. I had pegs of black dog to wash it down with.
The teriyaki chicken was good,but not the lamb.The lamb lacked any flavour of its own.
For mains,we ordered a kung pao chicken sizzler and a chicken ala grecque. Kung pao chicken was a bland affair,really unimpressive. The other sizzler was marginally better,though I've had far better garlic bread elsewhere.
In my opinion,the open air ambience makes up a lot of its charm...take that away,and you are left with moderate food,good service and a lot of taxes ( quite expected in such a place).
Will be going there again to have the rooftop experience... hopefully, it will be better.

Between all the hustle bustle of New Market, standing tall is Blue and Beyond. Now there are many restaurants in New Market area, so why Blue and Beyond? Blue and Beyond because it's one of the most serene roof top restaurant in the city. Sitting on top the nine storey building, sipping on your draught beer, viewing the entire city, you feel something! The cool breeze washing across your face not only relaxes you but also provides you with a soothing atmosphere.

Again, the credit to visit Blue and Beyond goes to my loving girlfriend (

One of the first rooftop places to open in Kolkata.
Located in New Market Area, right on top of Lindsay Hotel.
The entrace and the walk to this place from inside the building already gives you hint of how the hour is going to pass by.
Ambience is always pretty cosy in such places.
This is much of a place for drinks. Food is good too out here. Like the Lat Me Kai chicken.
But that's a sure pocket pinch as you know you'd be better having it at some other place.

If you're coming for drinks, a nice place to visit with the open air adding to the charm.
I'd rather give it a double thought if i only went for food.

Went there last week. The ambience is all that is there to talk about. The rooftop is well decorated, with comfy sofas and lights. Could have been cosy and romantic in the evenings, but was too crowded for comfort. The space indoors (AC) is quite small and not that great. The food is so-so and the service slow. Plus it is located in a congested area. Parking is really a problem. Don't know what is "blue" or "beyond" about it, perhaps it refers to the once in a blue moon time that one will go there.

Being situated on rooftop of Hotel Lindsay, the ambience is beautiful specially if the weather is a lil on the cooler side. Nice couches have been placed and the view from the top is beautiful.
Food is good but a little higher on the cost part, but then comparing the overall experience and if you want some change from sitting in same boring ac restaurants its worth it.  Must try..

I had a very fond memory to this place.. this place was my first ever rooftop experience. The whole experience of rooftop and open air concept was new to kolkata then..six years back when they had their old basic decor but in my recent visit also the interior didn't appealed me much.
Such a mismatch in the interiors...two separate lounge ( I dont know why they have that separate lounge, one section is too small with only two table is around and close to eachother )

Only because of the beautiful skyline..I found this place a good catch for a romantic evening. ( but that just it )

The service is disappointing.. staffs are arrogent and rude,they're not professional at all.
Even when i enquired about the happy hours half of them were not aware in which exact time it gets over
Because of this issue my experience went very bad,which later went to a misunderstanding.

After all this I was in no mood to chill so we ended up ordering just an Chicken Sizzler and some beers.
The food is average nothing to write about.
Draught beer wasn't available that day. ( Again disappointed )

As per pricing..the place is pretty much costly.

Conclusion - Location wise it's a great place to chill and relax in the open air terrace while watching the kolkata skyline but interms of hospitality and food they seriously need to improve.As a Foodie I'll suggest to rectify their flaws in quality of food.
Or else kolkata have many more such places were both decent pricing and good food are available,With a better professional staff.

The rooftop restaurant at Hotel Lindsay offers a beautiful view of the city‚Äôs skyline... The restaurant is spread across the terrace with a pergola installed on one side.... There‚Äôs a small indoor seating section too... The entire area is adorned with white furniture offset by a few plants thrown in to add a touch of greenery.... Located in the central part of the city,,, this place is a great vantage point to view heritage nd landmark buildings nd bridges... This place is frequented by a lot of foreigners nd hence the menu has been designed accordingly... Must try the¬†Lat Me Kai,¬†Konjee Crispy Lamb,¬†Mexican Mariachi Sizzler nd¬†American Banana Split among others............

It was drizzling that afternoon! My husband (then boyfriend) was leaving the city the following day for a good four to six months and he took me to Blue and Beyond to spend some quality time before we said goodbye for a while!....
We sat ourselves in the open air disregarding the little droplets of water falling. And the time spent was beyond beautiful... The rooftop view with the drizzles and slow kick of all the beer...well, was by far one of the best moments of my life!
I honestly don't know how the food tastes here. But all I can say is that the rooftop view, the feel, the conversations mingled with the beer and the drizzle (if it does) can etch everlasting memories in your life, like it did for me!

Now you know what to do! Cheers!

Blue and beyond, the name is self explanatory. Still would like to take the opportunity to describe what I felt being at this place. A rooftop restaurant at the 9th floor of hotel Lindsay famous for its scenic view from the rooftop. Yes, the view is mesmerizingly awesome. You can see and enjoy the beauty of Kolkata really well. The view of the iconic Victoria memorial and pricepghat is a plus. I can write all day about how good I felt being at this place.
Anyway, coming on to other aspects of this restaurant. The food was really good. Our order was constituted of appetizers only, which includes dewangi platter, lat me Kai, konjee crispy lamb and afghani gosht kebab. The bhetki fish from the dewangi platter was just awesome, tender and tasty. Apart from it the platter includes pieces of prawn kebab as well as chicken Rashmi kebab. Lat me Kai on the other hand is a Chinese preparation with all spicy sauces followed by the konjee crispy chicken. The Afghani gosht was also very good.
The service is also very good despite the rush at this place. Though the price is too high for many to afford(including me aswell) ;). Next time if I visit this place, which I will, I will opt for the happy hours which allows 25% off on bills or maybe try to dig into somebody else's pocket. 
I am giving this place a 4 rating because it rained and spoiled our mood somewhat, which is a major drawback of rooftop restaurants, but in all this place is too good. Specially for couples want to spend lone time with an awesome rooftop view of the city of Kolkata.

Beautiiiful place.. Just like u imagine when u see a movie. Perfect scenic beauty and a beautiful view of entire Calcutta from all the sides. This was a perfect place. Just inside new market area at hote lindsays rooftop. The gallery you pass thru has famius personalities framed. 
So the ambience now u know is beautiful. 
Service and staff friendly and good.
Food I ordered 
Tandoori platter-dahi kebab was tangy and just right spicy, paneer was okay not really well grilled , and gobhi was good. However chutney was nornal not the mint one. - NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.

Continental style sizzler- sufficient for 2 nice taste. Cutlet of cottage cheese and boiled potato veggies and spaghetti.. Was good. Can try.

Pocket friendly 300 per head without alcohol

One of my favourite resturant. I visit this place atleast once in a month. The place is so awesome that you want to be there for again n again. The music collection was awesome. The night view is much more grand than day view. Food is awesome and the staffs are friendly. One thing I must say draught beer isn't availble most of the time. Though they are on menu card, the availability of pint beer is disappointing. I didn't get my brand most of the times. Ovearll it's good... Love the ambience.

Been there yesterday and i guess i spend one of my beautiful evening in Kolkata. Excellent food and the behavior of the staff also very friendly. Though the sizzler was not upto the expectations but apart from that all other food was good to have.  Garlic fish was really mouth watering. A must visit if you want to enjoy your evening in a rooftop on 9th floor.

One of my most favourite places. This place is so wonderfully decorated and has an awesome ambience. The rooftop view is mesmerising. Maybe cause of its location it gives a beautiful view of city. It might seem overpriced but once you try the food and the service you get you wil realise it's worth every penny.

We were stupid to have visited this place in summers. But otherwise, this is a lovely rooftop restaurant. We could see the beautiful skyline of Kolkata - Victoria, Howrah bridge and the Hooghli Setu, to name a few. Coming to food and drinks, we ordered - Long island iced tea,Caprioska,salty dog,between the sheet,dewangi platter and the tod man pla (thai fishcake) . The food and drinks were good. I also loved the live music which was being played. It's a great romantic place to hang out with your significant other or even friends and family.

Well.. We went on a dry day due to election.. But any way first of all the room view was awesome.. Refreshing after the tiring day. Started with mocktails and starter like chicken tariyaki and veg tandoori platters. Then went for main course like thai red curry , nan, veg fried rice , chicken moghlai and ya price is reasonable and will not make hole in your pocket.

This is one of the best rooftop restaurants in kolkata. Located in new market. The view is good from here. The place is spacious and has a nice decor. They play good music. I had a great time, the food was good. They do not serve sheesha which was a disappointment for me, they should include this menu too. Other than that place is good. Only visit in the evening.

I totally loved this place. The view from top is awsome. One of the very few rooftops in kolkata.The food is delicious and the service is good. The only difficulty you will face is finding a cab, because it is situated in the main market area which makes it impossible for the cab to come. So you will have to walk a lot. 
Reasonable price of drinks and the ambiance is good.

If you are looking for a place where you want to make memories with your family or friends or partner, this is the place where you should be. Snugged in the midst of a always bustling new market area, this place offers the much needed get away from the daily. 
The restaurant is on the 9th floor and they have both indoor and open air seating arrangements, but if you are not taking the open air option, you miss out on their best feature. The strong gusts of cool breeze , the comfortable seating and the food all conspire to give you a surreal feeling. The food, according to me is good but not great. I tried the teriyaki chicken which could have been better, lat me kai chicken was good, so was the lollipops. The cocktails were carefully made and I loved the pina colada. Booze is cheap here. The food just adds on to the ambience , which is the star of this place. The staffs are very well behaved I will definitely pay another visit, soon.

This place is absolutely great with its ambience, food and decor. Located in one of the busiest places of Kolkata its very easy to find; Top floor of Hotel Lindsay and you reach your destination. To begin with the interior and decor, its really attractive with fancy furniture in its rooftop. One thing which I felt is that the number of tables are much more in that space. The bar section is simple and well placed in the other section of the restaurants. The rooftop ambiance is my personal favourite and I always have a great time when its open air. But it will be difficult if you go in summers. The view from the top is quite fantastic as you can see the city from the top.
The staffs were well behaved and polite, they were knowledgeable and had answer my questions about food pretty well.
The following food where ordered and I enjoyed all the items
#  Crispy Fried Chicken : Crispy exterior  of the chicken with the soft juicy interior was what i can describe this item served with French fries.
# Chicken a la Grecque (Sizzler) : Sizzlers are one of my favourite things and this was one of them which i ordered for experiment. And the experiment was successful. I loved the preparation, the chicken was soft with a red tangy gravy associated with buttery rice with veggies.
#Chicken Schezwan Rice : Well cooked food. Nothing more to describe.
#Chicken Hot Garlic : One of the best hot garlic chicken i have tasted. It was one of its kind. Everything was perfect in it, right amount of ingredients i suppose.

Ratings:
Food: 4.5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Decor: 3/5
Hospitality: 3.5/5
Value for money: 3.5/5

Overall 3.5/5 is what I wanna give to this place.

Last Words:
A perfect place to visit with your partner. An awesome place for a perfect date in the rooftop ambience with quality food. The price is on the higher side but you wont be sad after you spent some good times here. So definitely a recommendation for this place.

Blue & beyond..what can I say...
Went there today for a meet up..located at new market..landmark: near about bazaar Kolkata store.. (Have to cross 2/3 buildings from bazaar Kolkata).It's on the 9th floor in hotel Lindsay.. A rooftop bar cum restaurant..indoor air conditioned sitting is also available..
First impression after entering the restro entrance was wow..Walls are beautifully decorated with old pictures of some legends from different fields...Perfect setting for a pleasant dining experience.we wanted to enjoy the view from the rooftop..so we chose to sit out on the terrace than indoor under the ac! The view was mindblowing!! 
Now coming to food..ordered kung pao sizzler , cranberry mocktail & virgin colada!!! Service was quick...ambiance was fantastic..choice of music too needs a mention!!! Drinks were refreshing..kung pao chicken was really spicy but tasty...Even though it's pricey....it has become one of my favourite dine out places after today..
Would love to go back ...soon ...!!

They have revamped this place.. Oohhh.. The view from the 9th floor of hotel Lindsey was already breathtaking and with the changed interiors, they have made it better. And hiked the prices too!
Blue and beyond is one of those few places where you can sit in the open air and enjoy your food with a magnificent view of the city surroundings having some pretty decent food.
Their service is okay. The waiters seem to disappear after the food has been served, so your left sitting waiting for your bill to arrive. Ah well, the view makes up for a lot of flaws. The Chinese they offer is pretty much the same tasty Kolkata Chinese that's available everywhere. We ordered cheese balls and crispy babycorn as well as crispy lamb by the sides and weren't disappointed. The Indian food is good as well. The menu isn't extraordinary, but the food is good and the experience is a must have. Will keep visiting.

Location : 9th level, Lindsay Hotel. Beside Simpark Mall.

Lindsay Hotel is one of the oldest in Kolkata and has maintained its prestige over the years. However, their main attraction for the general public is their restro cum bar, Blue And Beyond. After coming through a circulating/confusing passage you reach the restaurant. As you enter the outlet, a beautifully furnished bar lit with blue neon lights welcomes you unassumingly. However, they should work on the ventilation as the bar area was replete with the smell of alcohol, which is least tolerable. Then crossing over to the open terrace section, it‚Äôs a completely different scenario. Fresh cool breeze welcomes you as a make your way towards the inconspicuously designed seating arrangement which is both eye catching and comfortable. The scenery from the top is awesome and gets amplified manifolds during the night. The amazing city landscape with the Vidyasagar Setu in the backdrop is a delight to your eyes. With no taller structures in the vicinity, you are ensured of an unclogged view.

This place is mainly famous for its cocktails and starters which are its stronghold. The fact that I visited with my family is what constrained my boozing and restricted me to stick to the staple main courses, whereas I would have loved try out the acclaimed items. So our order went as follows.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Sweet Corn Soup : As far as soups go, I have had the opportunity to taste the best in town and I feel the quality here is a bit diminished. Nothing wrong with the main areas, just the sugariness was in excess. Otherwise there was nice texture and density.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Crispy Chilli Babycorn : This was the pick of the starters as it had no flaws. Amazing crunchiness and spice levels were good. Not at all chewy, which is a must. Great dish.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Spring Rolls : Another let down. These weren‚Äôt even slightly good. The stuffing inside was too much of onion to compliment the lesser outer covering. The outer layer was not well cooked as it had some rawness. A complete negative.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Main Courses : Paneer Butter Masala was good with thick dark gravy and nicely marinated paneer. Kadai Vegetable again had too much onion content and less of other veggies, so lost some of its key elements there. Dal Makhani was really good and the saving grace for our dining experience.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Breads : Butter Naan and Tandoori Roti. Both were evenly cooked with no burnt portions. The softness and texture were commendable.

All in all it was an average dining experience with extra points for the amazing ambience. This place is truly famous for its drinks and starters, which I‚Äôll surely be back to try out soon. Service is swift but needs better training for handling orders and keeping a constant check on customer needs.

This one of the best roof top restaurant in the city in terms of ambience and food quality. Amazing place to hang out with family and friends over a glass of drink. But the management should introduce some crowd control to prevent untoward incidents. Not everyone can handle alcohol but a screening of who is allowed and who is not can be done.

Just like the name suggests.. The experience you will gather here are just beyond words. It is tough to put it all in a review..For a start I would say the indoor decor is absolutely fascinating.. But the view of the drenched city from the terrace after a heavy shower will make you fall in love.. In the evening, the lighting in the outdoor section and the live instrument played by their artist only will only delight your mind. The Martini Rosso, Blue Lagoon, Chicken 65, Lat me kai.. we kept ordering just to be there for a little more and they served their best.

Top class rooftop restaurant situated on top of hotel Lindsay in new market area. A bit on the expensive side but every penny worth it. The food is delicious. We had tequila shots and the whole treat by college seniors was great. A great place to visit once in a while. This is a very nice place to visit. In winters, one can also have lunch outside the AC area and enjoy the view from the rooftop. Desrvingly placed in the romantic collection of kolkata.

I used to go there for the romantic ambience and the view, as well as the quaint "bonediyana". What it lacked in food ,it made up with these aspects. And, as a rooftop restaurant, the seating will still blow your mind, while the halls, decorated with old photographs, make for a great background for selfies and groupfies. But, upon my recent visit, the food and drinks disappointed me so much that perhaps even the Himalayas in the skyline would not have been able to compensate for it! The mutton sizzlers tasted like boiled, UNSEASONED leather pieces. The chicken was chewy to the point where the gums started aching. The cocktail and the whiskey, on the other hand, felt like coloured water. The 'hit' of alcohol was missing, even after 3 pegs. I'm sure I'm not doling out a single buck here any time soon.

The lift seemed to take an eternity before coming to stop on the 9th floor with a slight jerk. The door opened revealing a narrow passageway and a door at the end of the same. Little did I realise then that the door was the opening to another world- a world of old world charm, of soothing river breeze and of pure bliss! 
But first things first!  The door at the end of the passageway opened to yet another passageway, this  one a long circuitous one, with walls adorned by black and white photographs of many a famous personality who happens to have had a connection with our very own Bongobhumi! As I walked down this passageway,  it almost seemed like a hall of fame,  the luminaries of the past seemed to smile at me and congratulate me for having come to the very spot that had been a source of joy De vivre many aeons ago! Then I suddenly saw a room bathed in diffused blue lights and I realised that I had reached the end of the passageway and heaven was but a glass bar room distance away ! 
Blue and beyond is a lounge bar situated on the top floor and therefore open to the manifestations of the breeze blowing in from Hooghly. For those who prefer the controlled temp and draught of the air conditioners, there are two air conditioned enclosures. However the beauty of the place can only be savoured if one chooses to sit in the open, surrounded by British architechtural grandeur and sip one's poison while letting the breeze play the role of an impatient lover eager to touch and caress every bit of the partner's body! 
Such a beautiful surrounding could only enjoyed to its fullest if one had some good draught beer for company!  I ordered for some only to be told that draught beer is only available occassionally.  Nevertheless, a beer it was that I chose accompanied by some chicken lat mei kai. The chicken preparation was nothing great to write home about but in keeping with the soaring spirits of  noisy, laughter filled  group of garrulous Britishers, I had two pints in quick succession. 
Ss i let out a contended  burp, I watched the lights of the Indian museum getting switched off. It was time for ghosts of th British Raj to celebrate on the roof top of the museum and probably lament at the degeneration of their once famed city of the great empire. 
I walked back to the lift, under the watchful eyes of the luminaries,  hanging from the walls on pegs.

A Great Place with an awesome ambience, viewing the City of Joy from the roof top gives you a different feel . The Staffs are equally good. I liked the Lamb Chops and Chicken Teriyaki. I had the Dewangi Platter as well and I feel the quantity should be increased a bit.I won't say that the Food is awesome but you can give a 3/5.¬†
The way it has been decorated is worth seeing. The black and white pictures in the hall pushes you to a different era.¬†
Go out with your friends or special ones in the evening and you will love the place.

Blue and Beyond is located atop Hotel Lindsay. The place is quite interestingly decorated, and is going to catch your attention immediately. The view of the city from there is simply fabulous, and adds on to the pleasing ambience of the place. The food is pretty good too. To sum it up, if you want a quiet romantic getaway, and are ready to shed a few extra bucks, this is the perfect place to be! One can choose to sit either in the open air portion of the restaurant or the interior.

Owing to its location the rooftop restaurant provides you the view of Victoria Memorial and Howrah Bridge on one side while the top view of New Market area on the other side. The service was prompt and the staff was well behaved. We ordered Teriyaki fish that was quiet nice. Overall, a good hangout place!

The food is good
The service is very good
The ambience is perfect
I'd go back again another time or more

I could not just get enough of this place in two hours. I went there with my boyfriend for my bday treat. I was amazed by the ambience. View from 9th floor was simply killing. And adding to everything was the breeze that was just so romantic. 
 Coming to food it was good. We have ta le mai, minced chicken with chilli garlic sauce. It was delicious. We also had tandoori chicken. It was very soft and juciy. Loved them as well. Drinks were also  wonderful. 60 ml of rum was enough to make me feel good. Also we had blue lagoon COCTAIL which was again nice. 

Over all i had a beautiful dinner. Not to forget the waiters and staff were friendly and so well mannered and the service was simply superb, fast and hassle free. 

Just one thing as the name suggests blue and beyond i excepted blue lights, blue sofas, but it was all yellow üòâ.

I actually took a random guess while trying this outlet, aim being to entertain a few guests....i have believed that reviewing a restaurant or the restaurant itself is not just about the food but the overall place/scenario/surrounding/ambience et all....i can hardly believe that you can actually get a place like this in Kolkata....this is an awesome rooftop joint with a breathtaking night view of the city....this is my best experience of Kolkata joints so far....the pleasant night breeze of the Ganges, a great view, pleasant music, soothing lighting & all you will need here is some romance/good company....loved this place wholeheartedly.... food qualifies only a 3.5/5 but this is more than compensated by the place, if you see the pics, you would notice the historical theme all through the entrance till the open air restaurant arrival.... i have a soft corner for historic themes and when it is Kolkata that makes for something special....touched a chord!!!....folks don't miss this place....summers or winters, forget the food, relish the place....i am definitely coming back, happy gourmet indulgence....and a few drinks to boot ‚ò∫

Staff response time is really long. Apart from that the rooftop is really a romantic one for a date. Service is courteous. Food quality is good. One can actually have a relaxed time over here. A suggestion - Please improvise on the music. That would add up to the value.

Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant! I would not comment on the taste of the food because the restaurant didn't give me a chance to taste their food! :D yes, that's right! The hospitality and management was sooooooo horrible that we had to leave even before we ordered. The lady whoever was in charge of receiving customers did not even get back to us instead shouted at the other staff in front of everyone. Also when we were leaving other members said sorry and asked us to stay back but she opened the door for us to leave!
Extreme arrogance. This behavior of the staff may even lead to losing customers. As far as I'm concerned, I would definitely NOT recommend this to any of my friends.

Also to be frank, the pictures that are shown in Zomato are very very deceiving. The actual place is highly congested and you can overhear the conversation going on at the next table. We were highly dissatisfied and disappointed that I had to leave with a heavy heart(since it was my bday treat). 

Thankfully we found a MUCH better place, Jhaal Farezi, which was totally a warm and fantastic ambience with great food & drinks! 

P.S - The artist playing music at Blue &Beyond was exceptional. The rating of "1" goes to it!!!! After all talent has to be appreciated. 

Good Luck BnB!

This place is located on the 9th floor of Hotel Linsday. Known for its ambience, it has great terrace seating arrangements. Food is great. All the ordered dishes were yummy. Their staff is not that courteous so overall poor hospitality. We ordered some chef special mushroom, sizzler platter and hakka noodles. Food is great no doubt just that they can work on their service.

This place was an instant favourite. Away from the hustle bustle of New Market this place is a breather. It's a rooftop restaurant with a view that is in its true sense picturesque. Coming to the food we ordered calypso fish and kung pao chicken. The fish was delicious so was the chicken. We ordered tutti frutty ice cream for dessert which was rather disappointing I must say.The ice cream had melted and it was blunt. But over all it was a pleasant experience.

Checking over the reviews and rating me and my friend planned to make a visit to this place and have some chill time. Unfortunately this place wasn't that great as much I have heard about it. It's located in the 9th floor of the Lindsay Hotel. Well they have nicely made use of the roof top. I liked the way they have put the chairs and all looks great. The small shacks really look amazing but the place ain't comfortable for an afternoon chill. To my surprise when I reached the place I heard that they have stopped serving with the hukka which made me feel so dis hearted. Anyway I thought of seeing the food & bar menu and ordered the below things :

‚Ä¢ Red Wine Sangria - To my surprise the waiter was really confused with this drink and had to actually confirm it twice with their management which was funny. Well the sangria wasn't that great since the wine was very sweet and the apple pieces were chopped very big and poured. The quality of wine was bad.
‚Ä¢ Caprioska - This drink was made well and was quite refreshing too.
‚Ä¢ Fried Chicken American Style - It was no American style it was totally Indian. Two pieces of fried chicken with a thousand island dip. Didn't taste that great. The chicken didn't seemed that fresh, it had a stale smell in it.
‚Ä¢ Stuffed Tandoori Alu - Extremely spicy with awful taste. Quality of food should be improved.

Overall the place is good. The service providers are quite prompt and the ambience is also nice. But should surely improvise over the quality and taste of food.

Visited this restaurant on Feb 2016 evening, located on rooftop of Hotel Lindsay, opposite underground parking of new market. Entrance to restaurant is well decorated with pictures of old bengali film artists, famous personalities etc. Got a table quick it being weekday evening, slight breezy and dim lit gave a great ambience, with seating arrangements ideal for having a long chat . Ordered Dewangi platter, Sizzler Chicken a la Groceque and chicken gravy noodles to go with Salty Dog drink. The platter was good with all kebabs equally tasty, had a jumbo prawn with mutton seekh and chicken and fish. Sizzler was great to taste as the sauce was lovely but required either rice or more bread to with it. The noodles was bland to taste but had a lot of veggies and chicken in it. Followed by super hot sizzling brownie. If you have company, great place to hangout in evenings, with decent food as their menu is not vast or have a speciality per se. Staff was cordial and service was good.

The only decent drinking cut chilling place in the new market area! It's on the rooftop of a hotel and it's nicely done. The service is decent enough, I have not had much issues with it. They make good cocktails, yes really good ones! The food has never been upto the mark... They have served raw, hard food many times! And it's high time they need to work on it.

The beer towers and pitchers were not available.. Thats the con..
The roof top view of 2nd hoogly bridge, with sun setting in the back ground. Eden Gardens to its left.. A place where you will feel relaxed and out of the world..

I still remember it was 13th of November 2015 when I visited this place. The day was just a couple of days after Diwali. The fireworks lit up the background sky and this open rooftop place in the middle of New Market on a building which stood high above the others had a great view of that open sky. I would surely say, this was one of the best dinner I ever had. The food was amazingly perfect with a good quantity of it and as a matter of fact, the price is quiet reasonable when compared to the place and location. This should be a must visit for everyone and surely if you're planning a perfect date.

P.S. You do not have to worry about the parking since their free valet service takes care of it.

Blue and Beyond - A great place with really bad hospitality.
=====
Location+ Intro+ Conclusion:

It is situated in new market area. Head straight from Shree leathers and you would see this on the same path. It is located at the 9th floor and has open air as well as two lounge inside.¬†

I had been here with two of my friends and as soon as we entered, we were surprised with awe. One of my friend had visited this place earlier and she said to had a good experience. The music was excellent and we were loving the ambiance. We entered at around 4:05 pm and we decided to shift to the other lounge. We were 5 minutes late when we arrived and when we shifted, it was 4:13 pm. At that time, the happy hour closed at 4 pm and we just requested the staff 'Mr. Saurav Hazra' so that if he can allow us. He checked up with the management and said us that it's not going to be available. We were like okay. Just after few minutes, another staff 'Mr. Kismat (The Junior Trainee - the one with white color dress)' on it's own will came and told us that he will give us 25 percent off as a rule of Happy hour. I had been to this place for the first time and i did not know who is junior and who is senior. Everybody serving are same to me. ¬†Hence, we gave increased our order for beer from 3 Tuborg to 6 Tuborg to him. Just after sometime, Mr. Saurav Hazra again arrives saying that we can't give you happy hours. It was wrongly said by the junior staff saying that he is new trainee. We called both the staffs and asked him and he was still confused with what he just did. Thereafter, Mr. Saurav Hazra is asking me directly that "HAVE YOU COME HERE FOR HAPPY HOUR". I think till date in this hospitality industry, nobody has this audacity to raise such a question at least to me. I mean. I am a customer and i have to come to your Restaurant to enjoy my dining experience and satiate my palate. Even then, i was like okay. I just told him that it's not happy hour and to make our drinks from 6 drinks to 3. He was still like we cannot do that sir. I told him straight away that we are going then and thereon, he just finally did our order to 3.

If you are in the hospitality industry and that too serving inside a hotel, this kind of behavior is not expected from the staffs.¬†

Just after finishing my beer, i left the place because i personally have never felt so DISGUSTED before.¬†I didn't even feel like eating after the kind of attitude and behavior where the staff does not even APOLOGISE.

I would request the MANAGEMENT OF BLUE AND BEYOND to kindly give their staffs a BASIC training on how to BEHAVE. ¬†So much confusion was caused and the things could've turned worse just over a matter of minutes. I asked the staffs their name and kindly noted down so that management can take notice for the same.¬†

Blue And Beyond is a treasure and is a must visit with your special someone. You can never get tired of visiting this place. The ambiance is AWESOME. Try booking a table on the side facing side (like table no. 20) and you will love me for that !!
I have tried Mahi Afghani. It is one mind blowing dish you might want to try. The pieces are well cooked, succulent and juicy. As for drink, you might want to try Moscow Mule and Caprioska if you are fond of vodka.
The best time to visit is after sunset and before rains, where there is a strong petrichor in the air!
Hope you have a lovely and memorable time there!!

Ambiance: 5 out of 5
Food: tried mahi afgani, lat me kai for starte. Mahi afgani is mind blowing. Chickens in lat me kai were a bit stiff.Coming to the main course we had ordered jeera rice, raragosht of lamb, chikcen khawsuey ( a Burmese dish), Mixed gravy noodle, chili chicken. Rice was average, lamb was so tender and tasty. Burmese dish was delicious, it was kind of bengali chingri malaikari type flavour due to coconut milk used. Mixed gravy noodles was average and again chicken in chili chicken was a bit stiff. Overall 3 out of 5 for the food quality.
Cost benefit: To my opinion, food is a bit overpriced here. 2 out of 5 for price.
Courtesy: Staffs were average. Not rude and not courteous enough to melt one's heart. 2.5 out of 5.
Overall it would be 3.2 out of 5. There is lot of scope to improve. I am giving 3.5 for the variety of menu they provide.

Blue and beyond is the restaurant which s located in the Lindsay hotel exactly opposite to simpark mall new market area esplanade.... 

One of the reason to choose the place is awesome view of kolkata due to the central location and height of the restaurant which is in 9th floor good to throw private parties..

The only thing made my experience not good was the bad service when i ordered for starters i dint get a spoon or glass of water even i had to catch ur servers to ask everything i needed even though i dont wanted to disturb them but couldn't help as i came with a group of 15 people, the basic sop is to serve water first i asked for regualr water he got mineral water and served all of us and was charged for that, 2nd i had to ask many times to change the plate for maincourse and to refil the water, food came very late after having food asked for finger bowl he have me after 15 minutes my guest felt irritate and went to washroom to wash thr hands which is not good..
I asked the waiter why the service is happening late he said thr is no staff he is the only one looking after all tables that too on sunday...!! 

The only reason i've given 3 is coz of views and the taste of the food and the person playing flute !!

Romantic is the word that sums up this place and aptly i chose this spot for a valentine dinner. Great choice as to the place but wrong day! After an hour long wait we finally got first glimpse of the famous rooftop and yes it was worth the wait. Candlelit tables cozy but a little too snugly fit for my comfort. Nevertheless the cool breeze and the moonlight made up for the mood. Coming to the food ; the dishes were named with obviously love being the major theme! We ordered love in tokyo as a starter which was basically chicken in schezwan sauce nothing to write home about though i liked that it was served bbq style. For the main course we ordered a sizzler and pasta for which we had to wait literally another hour great for catching up but not so good for the hunger pangs. Sizzler was not sizzling but the pasta was creamy enough to make me forget the sizzler. Service is sadly lacking majorly and they are totally inept at handling large crowds as well as orders. Overall maybe another day would have been better but then as they say first impressions the last!

It is one such place that is very easy to locate and equally difficult to forget! The open air rooftop is just a pure bliss! Superb decor!
Speaking of food, we had ordered for the dewangi platter (non vegetarian kebab platter of chicken, fish and lamb)  and Chicken A la Grecque (Basically a chicken steak, tossed in red wine sauce, served with jacket potatoes, saut√©d veggies and garlic breads), both of which were exquisite. Also we tried Martini Rosso for the first time! Initially we had great trouble liking the taste of it despite our desperate attempts! But when we failed and we notified them about our poor experience, they actually sort of customised our existing drinks  and made them taste just the way we wanted it to! Overall, it was a pleasant experience. The brisk wind movement on the 10th floor of the hotel, on the serene winter afternoon, just added to the super effect!

Chose this place for anniversary dinner. Was disappointed. Place is too cramped up. Sangria was the worst i have had. Sizzler was tasty but the bed of rice was actually 2 spoonfuls of rice and jacket potato was a whole boiled potato with its peel. Pasta was bad. 
Staff was ok. The place has been over hyped on zomato.

Visited this place on Valentines day. The entrance is kind of disappointing, but then upstairs, in the air, you gonna love it. The weather was good, that could be one reason it all looked very soothing and a little romantic because of the red and white balloons. Coming to the food - we ordered Hawaian chicken salad and a sizzler. Food was not very great. 
4 stars for the entire atmosphere.

Among the few rooftop restaurants in Kolkata this one was in my must visit list for some time.unfortunately i chose the valentines day date here. As expected they had decorated the place with baloons candle lights and flowers. But the service was very poor. The food also not good.their much talked about dish teriyaki chicken turned to be a disappointment. The chicken was not well marinated. Mutton rogan josh was decent. As people say on occasions not to expect much.this place proved that point.however the overall ambience was good with music and all.will try out this place some other time. :)

So, this place deserve a huge round of applause for destroying the day...
Starting from the moment we entered it took an hour to get the place...since it was 14th am just fine but then the disaster started...we ordered for drinks...ur guys dont knw what "on the rocks", took 10 min to find the opener, now coming to food there was a mexican sizzler that we ordered, arrived in proper time but ur guys dont even knw the table numbers the wer going to every table asking for it...the portion was small taste was pathetic...and tell me does jacket potato means boiled potato wrapped in foil,I have seen people leaving due to the delays...if you people cant manage such a crowd close the restaurant on the day when footfall is high, I felt like ordering something else but everyone was leaving just like that...I waited for more than a hour and left in half of that time...
One of my friend suggested me this place he liked it very much but it was terrible...if u people cant handle pressure I just dont have any further comments...
P.s: and get some new card machines I have to go to the reception to pay the bill and she was sitting there alone.

Fabulously amazing ambience & first of its kind, what a scenic beauty of the city of joy's heart from the open terrace view. You have to fall in love with the arrangement along with the food in any lazy evening. We were there unfortunately during the valentines week & the food menu was almost void of varieties! We were disappointed by the lack of options(we were having one chicken item to choose from for main course,how painful!). My recommendation would be a definite visit to this place but not recommended during some special occasions where the menu is cut short like this!

Located in Lindsay street, new market.
An outdoor seating area. Nice view and great ambience.
The place is well lit up. 
Although the presentation is great, the food is not good. 
Should be visited only for the ambience and yeah can enjoy the view with drinks.

I had heard a lot about Blue and Beyond from many sources, and decided to try it out last Friday Night!
Blue and Beyond is situated at the top of Hotel Lindsay. The area on the Lindsay Street is quite crowded as well as noisy and that made me have doubts on Blue and Beyond and the view from there. Nonetheless, once you reach the top those worries are more than taken care of. Being a Friday evening, the place was full.

Ambiance - 3.5/5
The place has a beautiful rooftop ambiance with different sized tables placed in between a lot of plants and flowers! One edge has Sofas lined as well, which definitely are more comfortable! The lighting is also nice and dim, setting a good mood for the evening. However, I was disappointed with the Music. There was low volume music being played from a speaker in one corner of the Seating area. I could even hear the Kitchen Chimney noises along with the music which was slightly undesirable.

Food and Drinks - 3.5/5
We had ordered only three dishes - American Corn with Pepper and Salt, Veg Tandoori Kebab Platter and Jalapeno Poppers. Both Corn and Kebabs were good! Jalapeno Poppers here were quite different. Made of Jalapenos and Cottage Cheese, not Cheese(mentioned in the Menu). I didn't quite like them though.
Drinks we had ordered the standard ones. Mojito, Draught Beer and Tequila Shots.

Service - 4/5
The service was really good. Both food and drinks hardly took any time once we placed the order. The service staff was very helpful and kind as well! Cheers to the service!
They do close at 11pm sharp. And they are serious about it. I would have liked to sit there for a little while longer, but couldn't since they were closing down.

Overall - 3.5
Really good place to visit with a group of friends or with a special someone! What makes it even better is that it is not that heavy on the pocket! Just that, probably I had higher expectations from the place, I found something slightly missing in the overall experience! But hey, it is a really great place! Do try it out :)

I would like to break up this 3.5 rating to clear confusions. 
For the ambience and view and setup its cent percent marks. The walk to the entrance wih the bnw photos of bengali legends like manna de,  uttam kumar and hrithik ghatak was overwhelming to say the least. 5/5
The food was decent. 3/5 when we ordered a chicken sizzler. 
However coming to the drinks I choose a manhattan and my friend a sweet martini. 
I was disappointed on inquiry to discover that they serve cocktails made out of only liquor brands. Which was dissapointinh from an esteemed place. 
The drink tasted nice but definitely won't be yhe reason I would come back again. 
Lastly the service and staff. 1/5.
My date was feeling cold and I requested to move our sitting from the open to places with shade. Though the place was quite vacant she refused blatantly which was a shocker. 

Would I visit again?  All thanks to your ambience that you get me there.

Had huge expectations from this place after reading the reviews here..and it did not dissapoint! The ambience was nice, though the seating could have been a little more spaced. The staff was very soft spoken which added to the experience. The food was good, we loved the American corn! Overall expense was around 3k which was not too heavy on the pockets considering the number of drinks and dishes we ordered.. Overall a must try place!

A perfect rooftop restaurant situated on the 9th floor of Lindsay Hotel amidst the busy new market area. Parking is not a problem (+point). The restaurant though is a bit small but its perfect to spend an evening with friends and your loved ones. I wouldn't call it a family restaurant. The view was great..music was good and so was the food. The tandoori platter was to die for. Though I didnt like the american pepper corn. Their spicy masala papad is a must try. And yes i have never found such soft and yummy tandoori rotis anywhere else. Would visit again for a proper main course menu.

The first glimpse itself mesmerised me. The place was romantically lit up. It's that place where you need to be with your special one. As I visited in the first week of Feb, the open rooftop seating was quite comfortable. Can't say what it will be like during the sticky summer months. My favourite pick of the evening was Mahi Afgani - a brilliantly done tandoor fish preparation. The only bad taste was that the guys charged me a large peg of scotch when I took a small one....

One of the best places for a romantic dining experience overlooking the entire city under the open sky. Even better if it is with the warm lights for dinner. That is Blue and Beyond.

This lovely restaurant is tucked inside the top floor of Hotel Lindsay, at the end of Lindsay Street (opposite New Market). Finding it inside the hotel might be bit of a problem but you can call the staff beforehand for help. 

We had CHICKEN STEAK and PENNE IN CHEESY SAUCE. Both were delectable, with the pasta scoring higher on my card. Quantity of each was sufficient for one.

The open air seating arrangement is with plush orange seats creates an amazing dining area. While you also have an AC seating area, the experience of dining under the stars is worth trying out. 

Cost for two : Rs 1400+ .

I went there yesterday with my boyfriend who just came to India and wanted to eat nothing but Indian food. So, it was a great responsibility for me to take him to a good place. I have heard of the ambience of this place quite a lot. We liked the look of this place when we reached there. We wanted to sit in the open air area but since it was daytime and moderately sunny, had to shift indoors. 
The staff was a little slow than ususal. At first they couldn't get things ready before 12:30pm, when the opening time is 12 noon. 
Coming to the food, I would say that it is not value for money. It served less food for quite a lot of money. We ordered mahi afghani, peas polau, chicken dum ka murg and fresh lime soda sweet. We were utterly hungry by the time the food arrived and I should say that the whole thing couldn't quench our appetite completely. Tastewise, the food was moderately good. But I don't think that I can give a rating higher than 2.5 for this

With the advent of Tinder, I can imagine this place being classified as "Tinderlicious" (the name just sounds to naughty to me).  The heritage New Market Area, the beautiful Nakhoda Masjid, the iconic Howrah Bridge and the Vidyasagar Setu, all in a 360¬∞ view make this a perfect place to take your Tinder date.

But only if you guys aren't into food. The overglazed Chicken Teriyaki tasted of soy and ginger, making it more of a Machurian than a Teriyaki. The distinct sweet nuttiness of the teriyaki sauce was just missing.

While I am not going here again, I would definitely recommend it to those people who seek an amazing view!

This place is really well known for its romantic open air ambiance but I fail to see it. It has been truly said that place doesn't matter when you are with the one you love....it seems like this restaurant simply banks on it cuz of its open air rooftop. The place had been decorated with blue strip lights and couldn't in any manner be called romantic with families all around n kids making their way through the tables.¬†
Now let's come to the service: The waiter was not only ignorant about the dishes on the menu card, he also happily ignored the requirement with the dishes or serve them as per instructions. He forgot to give the mint dip with the starter and when reminded twice, he got mint leaves instead. By the time he got the dip, the kebabs were cold and hard. In spite of requesting him to get a Ceaser salad with feta cheese he forgot the feta cheese and got the salad. When inquired, he said it's chargeable (This should have been mentioned when he took the order. However, I asked him to add it anyways) the salad served in the name of Ceaser salad was a Greek salad!!!!!!!
The drinks got spilled while being served and the main course was above average.
As I mentioned before, it's all about company. I went there with my fiance and had a great time but this place had nothing to do with it, except may be the cold weather.

Indian food items are average though....sizzlers are innovative. Alcohol is over priced compared to peer group.
the management must look to keep the place cleaner....special attention required to the crumbling toilets !!
All said and done....deserves a visit and then I leave it to your personal choice.

When an onshore client comes to town, and you want to take them somewhere different and new, you expect to give them a good experience. Unfortunately, our experience at the Blue & Beyond, where we took a couple of our onshore clients and a whole team was less than satisfactory.¬†

I have given the restaurant a rating for 2.5 only for the rooftop ambiance. Apart from that, there is nothing that's too impressive about the place.

Food: Is just about average. They skimped on the starters. They brought out the mint dip after half the starters were finished. They served the salad after the starters were over. Since there were a majority of non-vegetarians and only a couple of vegetarians, the latter were royally ignored. After 2 sets of starters arrived for the others, the vegetarians got served their first starter. Completely not acceptable, especially when there's a whole team of 15-20 people and only 2-3 people get left out. The main course was average - we ordered a variety of dishes, but not one was outstanding. Worst of all, we had to threaten to cancel the orders since it was taking way too long, and then magically the dishes appeared within minutes.¬†

Drinks: Were good enough. But then again, nothing great. You get better stuff at more decent prices in lesser known places in Kolkata.

Service: Is poor. I am sorry to say, but I had expected better service from the restaurant which has so many good reviews all around. The service was slow, the behaviour was rude, the attitude they oozed was one of sheer indifference. They could be least bothered how our experience was, which is a very sad thing in the hospitality industry.¬†

Ambiance: The rooftop area was nice. The lighting is lacking, especially if you sit out in the open. They would have done well to give us some candles, but possibly those were reserved only for the coochie-cooing couples who came in pairs. Again an example of biased and indifferent service.¬†

Cost: You charge for the ambiance, I agree. But the bill amount for 18 people was absolutely unbelievable - I mean, we could have gone to Hyatt for that matter by paying a few grands extra than what we had to shell out here.

All in all, not a happy experience at all. You need to really pull up your socks if you want to have continued patronage.

When one is on a rooftop restaurant with bright orange decor and overlooking Howrah Bridge, Hogg Market and other old Calcutta areas on a beautiful wintery noon, the beautiful ambience makes up for the fact that the chicken teriyaki served is a very Indian version of chicken manchurian (but a good one) and the daiquiri is plain and average. 

That's blue and beyond in a nutshell = beautiful, beautiful (and romantic) ambience (with good music and hospitable staff) + better-average food (invariably indianised) and cocktails. 

So visit this place mainly for the ambience, with flexibility for food and drink expectations.

As for the food...well i was paying more attention to pacify my friend over relishing the food...we vowed never to come back and honestly never did.

Looking for a perfect and romantic date with your partner? Well this is the place with a quintessential view of the Kolkata Skyline. Breathtaking it is. What an ambiance! 
Wheather someone would love the food or not, one would definitely fall in love with this place with the aura of Blue & Beyond.
‚Ä¢
Situated at the top of Hotel Lindsay, one will find pictures of our legendary movie artists and a small workout area/gym at the entrance. After that is the entrance of the wonderful restaurant with a bar counter. The rooftop open area is beautiful with unique seating arrangements. The view is just overwhelming. One can view the victoria memorial, to the whole Maidan and even the Hoogly Bridge. Almost the whole Kolkata Skyline is visible. 
‚Ä¢
Now about the restaurant, the only thing I would want to say is that service is a bit slow. Otherwise the food is good. This place is not something what foodies describe as 'Gastronomer's delight' but a place to relax with your loved one with good food. 
‚Ä¢
We ordered Cranberry Saga Mocktail, that came in a long glass and looked quite appealing. It is well concentrated with ginger, rosemary, cranberries. Loved it. 
‚Ä¢
Next we ordered the Teriyaki Chicken. Heard a lot about this dish from Blue & Beyond, thus we decided to give it a try. Frankly we loved it.  Perfectly tender and juicy chicken meat, doused in a sweet and savory teriyaki sauce. Not sure about those cherries tucked on either side. 
‚Ä¢
Next what came was the Asian Prawn Noodle Salad due to our noodle cravings. These translucent noodles are served cold and it is full of crunch and spice and herbs. This fresh and colourful salad packs ingredients to create this lively prawn salad with lime and sweet chilli dressing. 
‚Ä¢
For the main course I had some Burmese delicacy known as Khawsuey or as Blue & Beyond calls it on their menu card Burmese Kaukswe. The thing didn't appeal me much. It is basically a coconut curry served with spring onion, bell pepper & burnt onion along with noodles. The Kaukswe is subtle, lightly curried, flavoursome but it is too sweet and the smell of excessive coconut wasn't to my liking that much. 
‚Ä¢ 
For the dessert we ordered Caramel Custard. It was great to taste along with the vanilla ice cream scoop but honestly the presentation can surely improve.
‚Ä¢
Blue & Beyond was an astounding experience for me and my partner. The food and drinks were good but not extraordinary, but what Blue & Beyond will attract people to go back is their stunning ambiance and setup. Absolutely amazing.

This has been one of those much visited old favourites for quite some time now. The ambiance is out of this world. It renewed my love for the Tilottama that is Kolkata. Have been there during drizzly evenings, breezy sunsets and chilling winter evenings. The experience has always been amazing. Everything else takes a backseat as you sit in the open air with a mug of beer or a well made cocktail and indulge in some leisurely discussion. Coming now to the food, I have tried the Fish Finger, Lat Me Kai, Drums of Heaven, Teriyaki Chicken and Konjee Crispy Lamb, besides others. However, I am yet to try their exciting sizzler options, and look forward to the same soon. Thanks Blue & Beyond for the wonderful experience, each time and every time.

I wanted to visit this place for long and finally I got the opportunity some 2-3 days back. It stands tall in the heart of kolkata and is very easy to locate.

Once I entered the restaurant I was taken aback by the breathtaking views of Kolkata- a city which never gets old! We preferred to sit inside to avoid the sun. Elegant and romantic are the two words which best describe the ambiance of the place. So far so good. Then came the jolt.

We ordered cold coffee, beer and milk shake. While the milk shake was smooth and chocolaty, the less said about the coffee the better. There was no hint of coffee and it tasted so bland! I was thoroughly disappointed and immediately called the server. He obliged and brought a fresh one which was refreshing and flavorful!!

We ordered dewangi platter (assortment of kebabs) and drums of heaven for starters. The Dewangi platter looked appealing. The portion was generous considering the price and the kebabs were soft, succulent, well prepared, rightly charred. Drums of heaven was bad. Plain bad. There was little or no hint of chicken and I was thoroughly disappointed.

Next we decided to go for sizzlers We ordered chicken a la grecque, kung pao and mixed grilled- London House.... Chicken a LA grecque was eatable. Period. Kung pao sizzler was simple noodles with oodles of vegetables mixed in an unflavored gravy. And nothing else. Coming to the mixed grilled item- that was disastrous!! It smelled horrible. Still, we decided to give it a try. The mutton was chewy and we struggled hard to even separate the lamb from the bone and it tasted so horrible that we called the server and asked him to replace the order which he did. But in no way could we eat the item. We then asked the server to give it a shot and he even failed to cut the lamb into pieces and finally they decided to not charge anything for the dish.

Thoroughly disappointed with the food and with no intention of trying other dishes, we asked for the bill. It came around some 2500- 3000. We paid and we just left. Never shall I visit this place again. Elegant ambience is laudable, but the food matters. People usually don't go to restros with the sole purpose of boozing right?? This place needs to really work on the quality of food which they serve for there are other worthy competitors around. :)

To sum it up,
Ambience- 5/5
Service- 4/5
Food- 2.5/5

Ordered Tandoori Platter, Tandoori Aloo and Tom Yum veg soup and Budweiser. Food was pretty average and the beer was as it's supposed to be. 

Ambience is always awesome to be on the 9th floor in Central Kolkata. Service was decent and prompt. 

Visited the restaurant after almost a year before it was renovated to its present state.

The rooftop experience out here is so good that it will instantly lift your mood. Leaving the hustle bustle of new market downstairs, and climbing all the way up is what it takes to be here. It's a perfect place for a romantic date as well, especially when it's breezy and wintry because that just adds to the drama. Would love to go back again!

I had heard the name of this place from quite a lot of people and recently tried this place twice. This is one of a kind place in Kolkata and the rooftop view and ambiance is absolutely mind blowing. My fb status said: Beneath the blues and flute going beyond boundaries. If you are done with the ambiance and view when you sit down finally to have a drink and some food, you will be surprised by the great quality and taste of food. Excellent service by the staff, and as they say after every drink they serve. CHEERS!!

Had plan to spend 2016 new year eve@ BLUE AND BEYOND...been there and got a seat for two of us.
Food was good,ambience was good,staff were polite except one lady staff named miss antara biswas ( as was given by their staff).She was too rude and unpolite and is totally unaware how to greet their customers and make them feel comfortable.She was really iritating and spoiled the eve for us which make us decide to shift to another place and had to end up only after having starter...
Really would have been a nice experience without that staff..The management must take some necessary steps against such untrained and unmannered staffs.

Blue and Beyond. This rooftop is nicely decorated and the view from there is also very nice. The bar is separated from the actual place. You can order it,and it will be served. Else on the deck. The food is good. Candlelit dinner was the bestest part of the evening. Loved it.

Very nice ambiance and good food. Nice roof top view of Kolkata. Food quality and service is also good. Enjoyed my evening. Only drawback was the chili chicken was not boneless whereas now a days all restaurants serves boneless chicken without asking.

This is a rooftop restaurant and this is the main reason I chose it. The rating for anbience is 4.5 as I found the seating arrangement is not to spaceous. Price is on the higher side.

We went for Afghani Gosht and Drums of Heaven in starters along with Daquiri and Screwdriver in cocktail. Then we had a sizzler, most probably London mixed sizzler (check the name plz) which contained a bread, fish,egg, prawn, chucken sausages and mutton (which was not soft unlike others).

They are having a seperate set of menu for the Christmas and New Year's eve.

Should you visit or not??? Definitely YES.

Perfect place for a warm winter afternoon. Seating is comfortable and the view is really good. But the Christmas menu was a let down. It is so ordinary that it defeats the purpose of having a special menu. The normal menu is so much better! It should have been kept in addition to the special menu.
In any case, the mocktails are good, and although there were very few veg options, whatever I had was quite alright in terms of taste. It was quite an enjoyable courtesy the ambience, and I would like to go back again in hope of a better menu!

Located on the 9th floor of lindsay hotel at the backside of the new market this place is just perfect for taking out your loved ones for a romantic date. 
A nice cosy place.  Prefer to visit the place aftr sunset then you will enjoy the beauty of the place,  and the cold wind touching your soul if you seat on the roof top.  They infact have inside seating arrangements. 
Yuup prices are on a higher note. 
To those who are students or have a limited expence you can download  little app.  The little app provides different  combos that can be availed at blue and beyond in a much lower prices during the weekdays. 
All you need to download the little app,  then search for blue and beyond.  Buy the coupon that suits u.  Call the resturant for the timing to visit as durings national holidays the offer may nt be available.  And just redeem your coupon on your visit.  You dont need to pay any extra charge other than what you paid while you purchased the coupons. 
Now coming to food and drinks. 
They are good. 
But the most attractive  thing and the reason to visit this place is itz ambience.

On 25 th december i had lunch in this rooftop restaurant.It is situated on the 9 th floor of Lindsay hotel.First of all i would say that this restaurant has the best ambiance.As this one is a rooftop restaurant You can have a great panoramic view of kolkata,that's probably the USP of this restaurant.I had Budweiser beer,blue lagoon cocktail,lat me kai,fish finger.Foods were good in taste.Fish finger was served with the white mayonnaise & it was superb.serving time was quick,though i felt a little bit overpriced.

Bitterly disappointed.

My friend and I went on Christmas night to celebrate the occasion and were left high and dry due to the poor service and indifferent of the staff towards their customers.

We had ordered for American corn salt and pepper and sizzlers. Instead of bringing us American corn, the waiter brought us crispy chilly baby corn. During a span of 45 minutes where we waited for our dish to arrive, we atleast reminded the waiters 5 times to which they seemed least bothered. We later found that they had not even started preparing our dish. What a way to spoil a Christmas night. Neither our stomach nor our soul was satisfied. The food isn't great either. About average.

Though, the ambience is something. One of the first rooftop resteraunts opened in kolkata, the view it provides along with the decor and the candles are pleasing to the eyes. However, the callousness of the staff left us high and dry and I give them 2.5 for the perfect ambience.

The best roof top cafe of the Kolkata located at vibrant heart of the heritage part of the city on the top floor of The Lindsay Hotel. View of heritage Kolkata from their is mesmerizing. The plush low sitting lounge or those high chairs fits the mood and occasion of your visit. Its breezy, chilli on winter and best place to enjoy sizzlers with your favourite drink.

We ordered for Sizzling Troublesome Chicken and Kungpao Chicken Sizzler. Sizzling Troublesome Chicken is succulent diced chicken on bed of fried rice such a lovely dish while Kungpao Chicken Sizzler is diced chicken pieces on layer of noodles. Both tasted awesome with smoky finish of sizzlers but Troublesome Chicken is my pick and recommend all to try.

We called it a day with Tutti Frutti. Few scoops of two-in-one flavour with chocolate ice-cream and sprinkle of dry fruits and topped with chocolate sauce one can't ask for anything better.

Service is very slow and bit messy. The servers were dropping things now and then. Basic training is required to improve service. Cost is bound to be on higher side. Cost us INR 1377 inclusive all.

Frankly speaking....don't ever think of coming here, unless you want to get fooled & curse your goddamn bad  luck on your way back. Barring the ambience everything else is below ordinary. To top it all, price in the menu on their website is way less than the actual price on the menu at the restaurant. Nice way to trick people. Wonder how long can they go on fooling people.

The restaurant looked good. View is good from rooftop; located in a proper place, near New Market. We were here for basic lunch. Ordered Teriyaki Chicken, Chilli lamb, Chicken fried rice and ‚ÄòBlue n Beyond‚Äô. Teriyaki Chicken was very good will try it again. Chilli lamb was very properly cooked and soft, tasted great. Fried rice was tasty but I felt that amount of chicken in it is slightly less. But it was adequately spicy. Blue n Beyond was ok. Seating arrangements were proper. It was overall a satisfactory experience.
I wanted to try 'Chicken a la Grecque'. But sadly till 02 Jan it is off the menu. Now they are serving Special Christmas menu only.

This restaurant was on my mind since quite a few days but couldn't make it out. Finally I did it and that too on this Christmas afternoon. I was amazed to see the ambience out there. Though I had a preconcept regarding the ambience(thanks to zomato reviews) still being there n experiencing the open air sitting freezy wind n the magnificent rooftop view of the city was beyond expectation. I enjoyed the atmosphere thoroughly. Coming to food, I found it quite expensive comparing to its quality. Food was ok but nothing to mention about.i opted for lat me Kai chicken, fish finger and blue lagoon cocktail.i liked the cocktail more than the food. Though it was a Christmas special menu so items they were offering that day were different from their usual one. I would love to visit their again on some normal weekend so that I can taste some dishes. But frankly speaking apart from the price issue I found it as a good option for friends to hang out.

After getting a good feedback and many good reviews from various sources, I went to Blue and Beyond on the evening of Christmas. The ambience on the roof top with a fish eye view of the City of Joy  of was really charming. The music was also very soothing and added to the overall experience on the evening. 
Coming to the experience with food quality and service, their Christmas menu was different from the regular one, which was good. The cocktail and mocktail were server well. Then we ordered starter, from when the quality of service degraded. The brought the starter after a lot of time and didn't even bothered to serve those to our plates. We served those by ourselves. Then again we had to call them several times to order our next item, the sizzlers. After bringing the sizzlers, the waiter was not ready to serve that and we had to call him back to serve that. Maybe they were not prepared for the Christmas crowd.
However, having said that, the quality of food was very good and could well please our taste buds.
Maybe we shall visit once more during non festive season to try their regular menu and quality of service.

Only the roof top view of Kolkata on an evening would attract lots of customers here. A great treat to the eyes indeed. However, quantity and quality of food is very average and prices seem far more expensive. Even a simple mojito was filled half the glass with ice! Would only visit again for the awesome rooftop view.

Blue and beyond is located in the vicinity of one of Kolkata's heritage place New Market area. The rooftop restaurant provides excellent view of old Kolkata. One would get a warm feeling of old Kolkata here. A perfect place to enjoy your evening with a choice of a drink and some titbits. The main course served is kind of okayish, not so good to impress your taste buds. Pocket pinch is bit high considering the quality of food served. This place is just to enjoy the view and ambience..not to satisfy your tummy.

Positive point is the location and and the ambiance. It's on the top floor of Hotel Lindsay, just opposite Hogg market entrance. You can sit outside on the roof or inside. The food we ordered were sizzlers and they were okay, nothing extraordinary there.¬†
¬†Went there on Friday night around 10 p.m. They let us in and order our food, but by 10:50, they asked us to finish our food early and pack up, as the restaurant will be closed by 11 by their rules. It was a shocker for us. All the restaurants atleast tell you that you cannot order anymore since they are closing, however this one asked us to finish our plate by 11 and we had to eat as if we were trying to catch a train.¬†
The rating is all for the ambiance and a roof top space for dining. For the price, I would definitely look for other places, if I want another roof top dining experience.

With a breathtaking panorama of the city, this place is ideal for a quiet, romantic dinner. The bar is well-equipped. I ordered for a White Russian which was done nicely. Food is good, but can be improved upon - especially the quality bit. The Spaghetti Bolognaise was well done, but the meat in the Chicken Sizzler was a tad chewy and dry. However the tutti-fruity was the real dampener here, with the fruits being completely stale. I have to say I was disappointed.
And also the prying birds (read crows) were slightly off-putting.

Located in the refurbished Lindsay hotel opposite New Market, on the 9th floor is located Blue and Beyond, which has the option of indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is a must , for that gives you a 270 degree view of kolkata. The food and liquor menu is widespread with a lot of options . It's perfect for a romantic evening or to relax with family or friends and in winters its a no brainer. Average cost for two with drinks would be around 2000-2400 bucks. But for the ambience and superb birds eye view of lit up Calcutta, its a must must visit.

It's a dinner for two sister and we were looking for something different where we can have our we time.
We headed for this restaurant and it's easy to find the way. We were excited enough for this place and after we went it's like wow... superb location and that too open at roof top. U can view the extreme places from the roof top. The arrangements the music the place is just too good. How nicely they will put a candle in your table and will make the ambience more peaceful.  We were super happy. 
Next comes the food. I must mention that am too poor to memorise the name of the dishes.
We ordered for a tandoori platter. It consists of chicken, prawn, lamb and fish. It didn't clicked so well as we thought of except the fish and prawn.
We had our cocktail along with the starter. I won't comment much for cocktails as it varies on the taste from person to person. 
Next we wanted to have something in sizzlers so we ordered for our favourite crab sizzler. A good presentation which will make u salivate. Along with that they were providing one complimentary Tuborg beer. 
Overall experience was awesome. 
Want to have some quality time with special people you can always visit this place.

I adore the place... primarily because its the only rooftop place i came accross in kolkata... its in the heart of new market... the old town market area and a perfect simple place for a sundowner... so rating of 4 is purely for ambience. Location and open air on a rooftop..  
However must mention... food is oh tooo average so just drinking there is a joy... and the management is typically kolkata painful for no reasons. We turned our chairs to face the city ... and we were told... that cannot be done... we were a quiet bunch of 3 only. 2 girls and a boy... not loud. Not boisterous.. then. At one point i got comfortable in my seat and folded my legs... another rule was thrown at me that i cannot sit in any other way besides forward with legs touching the ground. It kind of just spoils the evening when every inch you turn.. they are unnevessarily painful to nice quiet people who just want to relax and see the sun set on the city. So im a bit bitter about the dumb rules they imposed which i could not make any sense of. But once again. Must go....beautiful location. Good music. Alchohol rates are fine and a must watch sunset site in kolkata

Went to this place last thursday post work with a friend,this place is on the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay,which is bang opposite to New Market on Lindsay street.Since i personally love rooftop restaurants this place has already scored a brownie point for that,the ambience and the view is really nice,even though if the company is good i wont be too interested in the outside view ;) . We just had a few drinks and a crispy chilly babycorn (being a hardcore non-vegetarian i am not very fond of veg dishes but this one tasted good.)Two Miller,Three small smirnoff and a starter was billed around 1500/- ,so its not very reasonable but not too pricey either. Specially since i liked the place i don't mind the prices either.I would definitely recommend this place for romantic dates :) .

Blue and beyond. My new exploit in the culinary world. And what a marvellous experience! A rooftop restaurant with splendid view of the new market area and great food. For starter my friends and I had ordered drums of heaven. As the sizzler festival is going on now, our choice for the main course was chicken brochette pepper sauce, Singapore chilli king crab and pan fried fish with orange sauce. The food was simply yummilicious!!! The chicken brochette may remind one of a lovely chicken steak. The crab was soft and the fish just melted in the mouth. The lovely decor adds another dimension to the delicious food. A place to visit again and again!

A group of 5 friends found this hide-out on a rain soaked evening back in 2012. Very few people knew about this place back then and we used to visit every Friday after work. This is one of the first rooftop places in Calcutta and has a brilliant view of Victoria memorial, Second Hooghly bridge, New market area etc. They used to have really great sizzlers, lamb chops is top of my mind. I also remember their amazing grilled pomfret. BnB (as we call it!) has undergone a serious renovation to catch up to the fancy pubs mushrooming every other month and succeeded with no doubt. However the quality of food has declined over the years, we now go to BnB for a drink or two everytime we all are in Calcutta since it is high up on the nostalgia factor! The waiters are really friendly and ever-smiling! I'd recommend this place for an informal hangout with close buddies.
P.S. BnB will always be on my to-do list when in Calcutta!

Honestly we entered almost 1 hr to it's closing - and all that my gang has in mind was "pre/post/Drink" - with the some chakna doing it's rounds.sorh Kali Pujo round the corner - the crackers and the music playing all around.honeslty couldn't do much of looking around but it's a good welcoming place in Kolkata - no offence meant! Pretty firm about their timings - sharp "bye" at 11 :p
The entrance hall - with photo gallery (wall of it!) - from Bengal's musician/actors/poets/ freedom fighters! Gave me such joy to be able to recognise three of thirty Atleast :p

When you get a view of the entire Esplanade area from the Rooftop it's amazing , just amazing! It was a monsoon afternoon gradually tuning into a beautiful evening while we wee munching on crispy baby corn. I had khawsuey ¬†....not the best that i had had but enjoyable on a cool moist and windy evening! Loved their Greek style chicken and the afghan ghost kabab was also very nice. The food is not stunner but the view from the roof top certainly is!! just the perfect place for your first date!
P.S: those walls with photographs adorning them just before you enter the restaurant is the reason i am giving the extra (.5) in the ratings!!!!! Made me HAPPY!

The rooftop view of this place is just perfect. You can spend some lovely time with your partner in this restro. The virgin mojito , chicken reshmi kabab and fish fingers were tasty. I personally liked the ambiance , seating arrangements and the paranomic view. While you enter , the lobby of the place is decorated with photos of bengali tollywood actors , actresses and directors which creates a nostalgic feeling. 
#absolutely recommended !!

I love the ambience of Blue and Beyond, the roof top haunt of Lindsay Hotel in the New Market area.... The lovely open air seating arrangement overlooking the old Kolkata, Hogg Market, Free school street and adjoining area.... The food and drinks are fair, pocket pinch is moderate but the live music is amazing.... Go there to enjoy an hour or three with friends or just the pair of your for a quiet evening amidst Old Kolkata charm and haunting flute playing in the back ground while you sip your poison and munch on fish fingers....

Have been here quite a no. of times and each time I have a blissful feeling just sitting at the terrace and watching the starlit skies and city lights !! Out of the few outdoor seating restaurants available, I think this is the best ! GOOD food with a decent spread ! Alchohol is  a bit expensive considering Old Monk Rum is priced at INR 196 for 60 ml !! GOOD service on days the restaurant is not filled up ! Great Outdoor Seating experience !!

This place has a killer ambience. If you want to take your girl out for a date, this is THE place. The view from the rooftop is amazing and very romantic. We made reservations for a friend's birthday party. Everything was perfect except the food. I didn't find the food to be very good; it was just okay. Truth be told, I was expecting something better. Other than that, everything's nice about this place.

Superb Ambiance.The decor is the best of all. Shamiyana style seating and having dinner on open air with cool breeze blowing just felt awesome.

Personally I felt the taste of food is not excellent but better than average.

Price is on the higher side but for the mood and feel this may be accepted..

It was 'Saptami' morning, and I was supposed to meet up with a school buddy who was in town for a few days for Pujo. We thus planned to meet up at some extraordinary hang-out zone, and Blue and Beyond seemed apt for the moment. Situated on the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay, the place is apt for romantic dates, or group parties. We were at once, taken aback by the serene, almost Goan ambience and the scenic, photo-friendly open-air seating area. Since it was drizzling a bit, we chose a table underneath the shaded roof-top area. Though the staff seemed a bit over-worked, the place was empty (Could be because we were there at 12 noon sharp, and it was 'pujo time', so people in Calcutta were busy pandal-hopping). I was a bit disappointed since the item I decided to try (Chicken a la Greque) was not available, and we had to choose items from the Puja special menu. We ordered for Chicken Forestiere sizzler (We got a complimentary pint of Fosters), fried fish and a Cuban rum based drink 'Maitai'... The food quality seemed good, but it was over-priced (Though the over-all package, with the aerial view of Kolkata, more than made up for the price). Overall, it was a great escape from crowded restaurants during Pujo, and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. In fact I would love to visit this place again on a misty Winter afternoon, with someone special. Just a suggestion, though : The fans and the bamboo scaffolding looked very ugly and jarring in such a beautiful place. Nonetheless, a great experience.

Best place to visit with your special one and have dinner or lunch. Lovely set up and cozy sittings to keep the romanticism which goes perfect with wine and tasty food. Tried several veg and non veg dishes. Price is a bit high but apt with the mood and feel. One point I disliked is that not all the liquids are available, I mean the brands. You are being forced to look for some other option. Lunch is fine in wintery noon times. They have this shaded sittings to hide from the shine.

Simply Awesome. Mind blowing and fantastic.¬†No matter how much praise is done, it will be less.
I have been planning to visit this one for weeks, finally visited this on saptami.¬†
I will give 5/5 for service, ambience, food, decor everything.
The decor is the best of all. Such peaceful yet vibrant. The outdoor seating is perfect for a nice romantic candle light dinner.¬†
The food is perfectly cooked with the right blend of ingredients that makes it simply yummy. Lucky to have visited during their "sizzler festival" as sizzlers are one of my favourites.

Located in Lindsay Street, opposite New Market, this restaurant is in the 9th floor of Lindsay Hotel. Decided to visit this place because of the appealing photos uploaded here and the rating provided. Outdoor seating was what we were looking forward to.
The ambiance no doubt was good. Due to rains we had to constrain ourselves to the indoor seats. The indoor seating arrangement is more of a lounge than a dining area with sofa seating which made it uncomfortable to dine.
Chicken teriyaki was good as said in the recommendation. But rest of the food was a tad too salty and we had to continuously remind the waiters to reduce the salt quantity. And the taste wasn't anything exceptional.
All the reviews states on how its lovely to sit on the terrace for a lovely view of the city, specially at night, but for us, the food was a total disappointment which will make us think if we want to come back again just for the view.
Pricing was decent, neither cheap not exorbitant.

This is a romantic place. The decor is really nice but we visited this place for lunch so unfortunately we couldn't sit outside on the rooftop due to the heat. We had ordered Tom yum soup, and kung pao chicken sizzler. The price is too high although the quality of the food was good. If you want to a nice romantic date without eating a lot then u must visit this place at least once :)

Find me a better place to chill out in the winter time. There isn't.  Value for money place with great food and a lenient bartender. A fantabulus view of the city with its sights but no sounds thankfully. Great ambience and when you think about it that does cover most of the things that one looks for, the bonus being the best months calcutta has to offer with add greatly to the experience. Order some of the cocktails that the owners recommend. You may be surprised. Also some of the dishes are quite new. Crowd is very different thank to its location. The place is frequented by people from various countries and not that it really matters but it does offer a welcome change. I'm just glad I didn't have to get up every 5 minutes and say hi to people I don't really want to meet when I'm out. So I say a perfect way to get away from it all and still be around.

This place was in my wishlist for many days and it was the last week when I finally nailed it. We were very pleased with the outdoor seating arrangement in the top floor. The restaurant is actually located at the terrace of the Hotel Lindsay. The corridors are decorated with photographs of Kolkata. But we found out the place to be small as per our expectation. There were provisions for both indoor and outdoor arrangements. The place has a great ambience. Indian Museum, Victoria memorial, Hoogly setu can be easily spotted from the roof. The waiters were nice. We used both indoor and outdoor seatings as the restaurant was moderately filled. We ordered sizzlers. They were good in quality but a bit overpriced as per the quantity. This is a great place and the ambience is actually the VFM. Still, I feel it's a bit overrated.

The food is really good,although its expensive but given the fact that it provides such a great view of the city,I'd definitely recommend it. The staff is also amazing, in short a good place to try out.

It was post-exam, and few of us close friends were looking for a place to let our hair down, and relax. We were primarily looking for a restaurant with great ambiance, and this place caught our attention while surfing through Zomato.

Located in Lindsay Street, near Hogg Market, this restaurant is in the top floor of Lindsay Hotel. The USP of this restaurant is definitely it's location and ambiance. There are 3 sections, of which two are indoor. Although the indoor section we were seated in was a bit cramped, the seats were comfortable. The Outdoor Seating area was beautiful, with white and orange toned furniture. The restaurant offers a panoramic view of Kolkata, and it was surely a delight to watch how an old city is fast becoming a new one, with modern architectures.

We ordered fresh lime soda, beers, and sizzlers. The sizzlers were served smoking hot. The Chicken a la Grecque had a large piece of chicken breast, in a delicious tangy red wine sauce, a small bread, a few assorted vegetables, and a jacket potato. It was okay. The Kung Pao Chicken sizzler had smaller portion of chicken, but came with noodles. However it was bland in taste.

Food: 3/5

Service: 3/5

Ambiance: 4.5/5

We were lucky to go to the restaurant in Happy Hours, and received 25% discount on the overall bill.

Go there, if food is not your primary need, but you need a good place to drink, chat, and have food maybe. :P

My experience about blue & beyond is not so sweet.Blue & beyond comes under the most romantic restaurant of this city of joy but it has little regards for the the couple as they are more concerned about large groups. Yesterday I visited there I took a table of our own preference but sadly we have leave that table as it was started raining.Then they almost force us to sit on tiny & uncomfortable, congested table where we can barely move our hands.Even I requested several times but they were deef to my request.
 If we are talking about food chicken teriyaki is very good. Rest of the items like soup,mocktail & sizzlers are not bad.
My only suggestion to them plz you should have more back up arrangement during rainfall..

What sets apart Blue and Beyond from any other resto bar is its location, ambience and last but not the least, extremely courteous waiters. The food here is obviously top-notch but there are many other restaurants which serve quality food. I came here for the first time with my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday and I was expecting good food. I was not disappointed. We ordered trerriyaki chicken as an appetiser accompanied with¬† beer and screwdriver, pasta fetuccini with cream cheese and sausages as the main and hot chocolate fudge for desert. What took me aback and in a pleasant way, was the view of the city lanscape. Nothing can beat the experience of having chilled beer, with good music in the background, while taking in the view of Kolkata. To top it all, the pleasant behaviour of the waiters made want to visit this place again. All in all, a beautiful afternoon spent beautifully. This is one of those diners where the ambience steals the show.

Starting with the location, it is on the 9th floor of hotel lindsay, opposite to simpark mall in new market. We went there at around 12.30 and found the waiters ready to welcome us. There are 2 indoor sitting and 1 outdoor sitting facility. If its not a very hot sunny day, i would recommend you to choose outdoor, to get a glimpse of central calcutta and get your mind blown by the sweet breeze. The waiters are very courteous and gave us the privilege to choose seats according to our choice. The overall ambience, awesome playlist of background music deserves 5/5. But the food was not really upto the mark. The chicken teriyaki and drums of heaven tasted perfect,no complains. But the chicken noodles,szechwan chicken tasted pretty low grade. It was kind of OK. Nothing more. If i visit this place again, it would be solely for the ambience and the starters. But trust me,overall, its really good enough to visit this place and get an opportunity of terrace dining!

I went with my bf yesterday..in starters we ordered CHICKEN TERIYAKI, PANEER SHASHLIK and in moctails we ordered MUDDY WATER.
Chiken teriyaki was good but definately not the best...! Muddy water was really nice...
In main course we had CHICKEN A LA GRECQUE! i must say this is one of the best dishes they have...totally breadth-taking and finger licking dish. I would love to rate that dish 5 out of 5 :)
We ordered HOT CHOCOLATE FUDGE in dessert.

Overall staffs were well behaved...food was good enough... And the ambience was out of the world :) we really enjoyed our time...hope to visit soon :)

Superb place, awesome view, sooting breeze, chilled beer..what else you need? 
This place is end to end awesome from every perspective. I will start from the beginning. This is located in a little crowded place. Beside bazaar kolkata. Parking is a big issue. But you are lucky enough if you can park in park-o-mat (simpark mall) which is located outside the hotel.  Though I was one of those few lucky ones ;) 
Its located in the Lindsay hotel. Its on the 9th floor. As your lift reaches on the 9th floor, a amazing cosy corridor welcomes you. As you walk towards the restaurant, you enjoy a nostalgic kolkata by the photos of some "gems of bengal" on the wall. As you enter the restaurant, a different world welcomes you which will be totally unexpected. Sitting inside is good but outside sitting is which you gonna die for here. Outside sitting gonna give you an amazing view with super breeze going on and nice music to the add on. You surely gonna plan your next date here in your mind, or if you are with your better half, you are already having a great time. 
They have wide range of menu. Starting from North Indian, to Continental they have it all. And mark my word, every food is made to the perfection and utmost taste. I suppose they have specialist chefs for every cuisine. :D Pastas, Tandoori Chicken, Sizzelers are made to the finest. Never had such perfect food in a long time. And not to forget every food is fresh. Service is quite good. Very welcoming staffs. Alcoholic beverages are quite cheap and the foods as well. 
Overall total 5 marks from me for an out of the world experience.

But they need to take care of their draught beer stock!  We were there today ( Sunday) and the Beer Tower isn't available !!! 
They also didn't have kingfisher ultra or tuborg!!  We had to settle for Fosters (330 ml) , which was pretty disappointing !

Right at the heart of the city when you climb up to the 10th floor and see the mesmerizing view of this beautiful city all spread out with her warmth on front of you the first thing you do is take a loong breathe. The location and view is the usp of this place. It has both roof top and indoor sitting but evening is the best time to visit the place. The service is very good. Food is just normal. They serve a wide spread but as for taste they are not worth their prices. In cocktail, d caprioska was havn less mint and lot more ice. In starters we ordered crispy chilly baby corn which was not very soft and d masala didnt enter the coat of the corn well. The mixed grill was good, having a lavish spread f chicken lamb fish egg vegetables. That tasted really good. Overall the dining experience was good. Appropriate for couple dates as there u wont mind paying those extra bucks for that wonderful ambience.

A perfect place to take your date, blue and beyond certainly lived up to my expectations with its location, seating arrangements and the offering quality food and drinks at reasonable prices. You can sit inside the lounge or on the roof top and it's quite windy in the evening time and that adds a bit of flavour to your visit if your better half is with you, so cheers to this place :-)

Went there on a quite Tuesday evening. As others mentioned, its on the eighth floor of the Lindsay Hotel right in the middle of the New Market. Its a crowded area, and they do provide free Valle parking. I found this place to be smaller than I expected, as it is not on the top floor but its on an open section on the eighth floor. View of Kolkata is stunning. Music volume was low which I really liked about them. Its not actually a place where you will go to enjoy good food. The real selling point for them is Drinks which goes really well with the open sky and city view. Together they create a perfect setting for your date with the special someone. Don't expect top class experience as in 5 star, but still a nice place to visit once in a while.

I actually wanna rate it 4.9 coz the restaurant, the place both inside and outside, the behaviour of waiters/waitresses, the songs they played, the view from the roof top....everything, i just loveeeed it..but not 5,coz I expected more from the food. I have always wanted to visit here and AT LAST!! :) It is quite easy to locate this restaurant. It is inside Hotel Lindsay which is just beside Bazaar Kolkata in new market area, and also opposite to Sim park mall. I got there and loved the english songs they played. And also the view. You can see the Howrah Bridge too :p
Anyway I had Chicken teriyaki as starter..chicken hakka noodles & Schezwan chicken(a little disappointed on this particular one). I didnot remember whether i had to wait or when actually the waiters came to serve the food, i was so very happy sitting on the roof top and listening the songs :D

Had a long time wish to visit the place after seeing the pictures on Zomato itself. Finally had the chance to be here on a Tuesday evening. This is located on the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay in Esplanade area. We chose to sit in the open rooftop area, though they have indoor seating option as well. The very first thing which will strike you is the ambience. Its a perfect venue for a romantic candle light dinner with your counterpart, its simply is an outstanding place. Food and service were very much satisfactory. We tried the Teriyaki Chicken and Konjee Crispy Lamb amomgst starters. For main course we chose Pasta and Hot Chocolate Fudge for desserts. Drinks were also within budget.

Undoubtedly one of the best open air bars to hangout in the city...the thing that makes this place special is its location, i.e. on the 9th floor in the heart of the city...the view from the rooftop is awesome...the place is not at all pocket friendly so be sure you have some more money than usual...if you want to have a perfect date(provided your date drinks) this is the place...overall this is one of the nicest places i visited till date..!! cheers.. :)

This was the place I wanted to visit for a long tym and yesterday got a chance to be there.
Its a roof top bar with indoor n outdoor sitting arrangement.
The view is awesome. And if it breeze you wont want to leave the place.they have this romantic candle light thing.
They serve a variety range f drinks and food.
We had ordered lat me kai,chicken teriyaki n crispy chicken and sizzling brownie.
There is a scope for improvement in food.
One thng is dat they serve premium beer with low percent alcohol content.
And the last thing its nt at all pocket friendly. Dare to enter wen ur purse is heavy with money.

I visited this place on a Sunday  afternoon and  found this place quite cozy. I loved their playlist and the ambiance in total. Loved the food and even if it seems that it's a bit costly but the quantity they serve does justice to it. A must visit for spending a romantic time. Interior is very beautiful too along with the open rooftop part.

This is one of the best open air restaurants you would find around! The decor outdoors is really attractive. Yes, the sun plays spoilsport and you cannot really look to go for outdoor seating during the day, but this is a good place nevertheless. I had to sit indoors, albeit on the roof, just along the outdoor seating area. This is slightly small; so too many people have to fit in there.

Once you get over the decor and visual attractions here, you come to the food. This is rather good. Just remember, things are very light here. There's nothing really that spicy! We had Cronjee Crispy Lamb as appetizers. This tasted really good. We followed it up with Szechwan Freid rice and honey chicken. We purposely ordered honey chicken to neutralize the spicy texture of the rice. But it turned out to be pretty light. Nevertheless, I loved the Honey Chicken. It looks pretty ordinary, but it has a good smooth texture.¬†

The quantity is decent, enough for one person. The service was really good. Serving time was less and there were people always there to help us!¬†

They also gave us a 25 % discount on the total bill, and that was pretty surprising (and amazing)! :D

My suggestion: Go there during the evenings, maybe for dinner, for best effects! I guess there is good music played during the evening. It will be a nice atmosphere to take in during this time of the day!¬†

Kudos to the staff! :)

One of its kind outdoor sitting pub on rooftop of hotel Lindsay, with mood lighting, cool breeze around & splendid view of central Kolkata, this place offers some rare on of its kind option in town to spend quality time with someone special.

This restaurant is not a family restaurant, it has a Bar for boozards, retro bar with few tables,hardly any space to move or sit properly and with only one split a/c running. Good for cozy couples....
Terrace has tables and chairs with good views but not for lunch time, b'coz of the heat. Food not up to the mark, with hardly any choices. Lack of communication and understanding with the staffs, where customer lands up paying extra bucks without any rhyme or reason.

Hi,

This is my favorite place in Kolkata because I like terrace. I have visited this place many times whenever I am in Kolkata and I suggest it to other people as well.
I sometimes go alone, sit by the terrace wall and look at the nearby buildings.
Music is conventional and popular. They serve quick and well. It is not very expensive but definitely not on the cheaper side.

This is a great place to hang out with friends or alone.

Best of Luck!

Quite liked this place for its open air ambiance in the heart of Esplanade. 

A good variety of alcohol followed by a decent array of food items makes this place ideal if you want to be away from the hustle-bustle of Park Street but still want the experience of a new age bar.

Now coming to food we had ordered lat mei kai chicken, chicken a la kiev sizzler, fish calypso sizzler and kung pao chicken sizzler and some cocktails.. I loved the food. Only that lat mei kai was very very spicy..
As per price ,yes, its a bit costly.. But then the ambience is sooo good that I would love to pay for that... I think everyone should visit this place atleast once...

This place is all about the white theme, old monk rum, dry chili chicken and the view of Kolkata from the top.

They allow smoking which is an advantage for people like me.

The pricing is on the higher side but the view, the courtesy of the staffs and the good food compensates the same.

Try the sizzlers as they are good.

Heard of this place for sooo long.... wanted to taste it for sooo long.
& finally.
Well you feel like something man! feel what's it to be like on the top of kolkata.
A view of the howrah bridge, second hooghly bridge, shahid minar,, new market. Enjoy the cityscape like no other place. Add to that the cool breeze you get on top of a 10 stored building.
Although the price is on a bit higher side it doesn't pinch that much on the pockets when you are with friends sharing it.
The food was good. But will visit again just for the ambience.

Now coming to the food, the teriyaki chicken out here is a must. Loved it to the core. Along with that had ordered Mahi afgani, chicken a la Grecque sizzler, shrimp penne pasta with creamy sauce, red wine and cosmopolitan. Food out here is not only presented beautifully, but also tastes delicious and in generous portions and also great staff.
Will highly recommend this place!

The open rooftop indulged me to visit this place and I am not at all regretting. We ordered crispy chicken which was ordinary but the dip was yummy, then we ordered lat me kai which was yummy with a pitcher of draught beer. It was a lovely experience for me even when the weather is not that pleasant. Will visit again for sure.

If you are with your girl and searching for a place to dine and hangout, this is the best Kolkata can give you.

Food and liquor is a bit over priced but worth it with the view in the evening. And music..just the way you like it.

If you are dating your girl first time, Blue and Beyond would bound her to fall for you with its amazing beauty and romantic ambiance.

Its just not a recommendation but also a request for all the lovers in the city¬† to visit¬† Blue and Beyond at least once.

The restaurant is good but what makes it spl is its rooftop and open air sitting arrangments.
The view of central kolkata you can get it right from there. And it comes to food the kebabs wer so soft and the gravy items were also mouth watering..but at the end of it wen i ordered a coffee dey failed their taste as well as dey tried to act over smart with mixing the two coffee moreover the waiter noted down the wrong oder and he was expecting me to have whatever he have bought so ultimtly it is the big turn off. Service was kinda good.
Overall value for money but managmnt cpuld have been better.

I went there during lunch hour. So sat inside. The rooftop is good for evening time. The crowd was less so it was quite  peaceful. Ambience is good. Service is good. But they need to improve the interior. It is not at all good as it is shown in zomato pictures. Now coming to the food, mocktails are really good. Sizzlers are the speciality of this place. We ordered Roquefort prawn sizzler,that was outstanding. Then another dish I liked the most was pasta with spaghetti in cheese sauce. I would like to tell people who are going to visit there should taste these two. The american banana split was good enough. And corn fried rice and the chicken preparation was normal one but tasty. Allover the food was really good.

Blue and Beyond was loitering in the Zomato 'Bookmark' list for quite a while when I decided to take the plunge on a Thursday afternoon.¬†

When we walked in , the place was empty except a young couple lost in each other . The sun was mercilessly beating down ; hence we gave the open air terrace a miss and settled in the adjacent air conditioned resto bar. ¬†For those with a cultural bent , I would recommend that just before you enter the restaurant spend a few moments appreciating the wonderful black and white photographs of yesteryear movie stars , singers , poets and the like.¬†

We had appetizers in mind and ordered a plate of Reshmi Kebabs which arrived soon enough. The Kebas were soft and succulent , but what really scored was the accompanying Pudina Chutney and both of us ended up having spoonfuls of the chutney after the Kebabs were gone !

For the main course we went for Lamb Roganjosh, the famed Kashmiri delicacy accompanied with masala kulchas . The dish was well made with the flavors of cardamom, cinnamon and other spices coming through, though some lamb pieces were bit boney and we had to maneuver to get the flesh from the bones. The masala kulchas were pretty decent .¬†

We finished off our meal with two cups of coffee which could have been a little better.¬†

Post our meal we ventured outside for the much talked about view from the rooftop and proceeded to point out the buildings and structures which we could ¬†recognize. The unique thing is that it being located almost bang in the middle of the city, u can see a whole lot of things from there. For me the most impressive were the views of the Indian Museum from one side and 'New Market ' from the other. It should look different when the night lights come on and I might drop in just for the views some time soon. We didn't go for the drinks this time round, so that can be yet another reason.¬†

For the young couples , the waiters turn photographer quite happily and hence I guess it a big plus for the crowd.¬†

When we paid our bills and were venturing out, a couple of waiters asked us to return soon, which was touching.¬†

Go to this place with the right kind of people and take your own time with the food / drinks and the views . You should not get disappointed.

I was here with friends but this is perfect if guys want to take their lady loves out on a date. Also the windy terrace space is amazing and plays cupid.
They have a good selection of wines by the glass... good for me they had a Rose'... perfect.
For starters we had Veg bruschetta... ill give it a 3.5/ 5... a good attempt.
You should definitely try the chicken teriyaki... completely stole the show... the best I have had till date.
Kung pao chicken sizzler was good.
Overall the staff were good... good service and presentation and the I loved the ambience.
P.s. plus points for the see through glass into the kitchen where you can see the chef prepare your dish.

The landmark of Lindsay hotel is simpark past new empire cinema.the restaurant is in 9th floor of the hotel.
What‚Äôs good
As you come out of the elevator,you are ushered into well lit corridors canvassing the many moments of ‚ÄúBengal ashmita‚Äù.the walls are adorned with black and white pictures of ray,uttam kumar,soumitra,and many more legends.As you walk past the centre piece table,the restroom facilities into the restaurant area,you find three sitting choices.the first one is a lounge styled sitting area right infront of the bar.the next one is the open roof top with one of the best views of Kolkata skyline.without straining your vision,you can catch the iconic bridges,eden garden,oberoi grand,etc.In the eveing this section¬† is even more endearing with a small fountainplace¬† and the perfectly placed dim lights all around you.it becomes an assortment of golden and blue specks and the perfect romantic setup overlooking the dear city.there is also a small ac room beside the billing counter which can accommodate around 20 people.this room has glass windows allowing the same view albeit restricted.In essence this eatery celebrates Kolkata and tries to capture the city in its essence and plethora.
The food is good,if not top notch.Their ‚Äúpiece de resisitance‚Äù,the London house grill gives you a chance to taste a wide range of sizzlers,but only the fish and lamb stands out.chicken ala grecque serves up large portions of chicken breast with boiled veggies,potato,and bread.we tried the blue and beyond mocktail and it was a cool blue drink of sprite and icecream.the amaerican banana split looks cute with triple flavor of icecream scones on pieces of banana flooded with chocolate sauce,choco flakes and cashew in a boat like bowl.
What‚Äôs rotten
The staff is too crass for such a crisp undertaking as this.we went there on 26th april.it was a Sunday.kolkata had been hit by rain,earthquake and a fire outbreak in citimart.we needed a respite,and really wanted to try out their open rooftop.But when we went there,we were told that section was closed.it wasn‚Äôt raining anymore and we inquired if it was gonna open anytime soon,and we will comeback later.but they said it was closed for the ENTIRE day.later the waiter said it was closed because the place was understaffed for the day and if we wanted to sit outside ‚Äúwe would have to carry our plates there,finish our food,then pick up our plates and bring them back to the indoor section‚Äù. Well,how ridiculous is this?it sounded like the staff had decided to take a day off for the rain and earthquake and simply wasn‚Äôt unwilling to inconvenience the patrons.This proved to be a fib though.An hour later,people were allowed to sit outside and service was resumed.clearly,they have no sense of propriety.the indoor place is actually very crammed and we felt like cooped up.we would have loved to come back later.
The waiter also seemed to fail to comprehend simple requests like ‚Äúplease bring the dessert 15 minutes later along with the mocktail‚Äù. When requested to serve the steaming sizzlers,he served half of it and disappeared and never showed up again.there was small cubicle for him in the room but he was never there,inspite of atleast 10 guests¬† seated and having their food in that room.So,when our glasses were empty,there was none to refill¬† with water.after paying the bill with card,we requested a change of 500/-.he soon came back and said they didn‚Äôt have the change.However,on explaining to him that we were trying to tip him and needed the change for that purpose,he seemed to find the means and procured us the change.
¬†A lavish setting marred by mismanagement,something that has become the curse of this city,is how I feel like describing this place.

Environment and location is the main attraction, will force you to hang out with best buddies or with special person for good time.
Price are high in respect to quality, not worthy.
But beer with Motton kababs can be great combination.
Seeing busy new market from eagle eye is really beautiful.

Can't think of going here again. Service is so bad and 'late' that waiters forget someone has ordered something and are waiting for an hour. Food was horrible tasteless as in. We ordered thai rice, veg thai curry and a paneer dish. Everything was sweet and weird taste. Before ordering they said it will be spicy but it wasn't. Very disappointing. Overcome. :(

Want to woo your girlfriend? Take her to this place. No kidding! My boyfriend brought me here on a date, and I have loved him more, ever since (:P). The outdoor seating is amazing, it sort of takes you back into a time reverie, with the old world Calcutta busting below you; the view of the Howrah bridge is breathtaking. Be it a sultry summer afternoon or a chilly winter evening, this place totally gets you!

Blue and Beyond is the ultimate romantic hot spot for foodies to enjoy a fine dining experience with delicious menu in the heart of kolkata on Hotel Lindsay..The gorgeous ambiance, the elegant decor and the lip smacking food adds to the perfect evening with your friends and companions..Hotel Lindsay itself a heritage hotel has been in the hunt for decades now..Right from the corridors decorated with stills highlighting Bengal's culture and heritage to the open roof top seating arrangements this place spells class..The aqua blue colouring goes aptly with its theme,the comfy couches, the roop top view overlooking the cityscape, the gentle cool breeze and the Live Music adds to its mood..The service here is generally apt,however on our last visit they actually goofed with our orders,served us some wrong kebab,and served the correct order only after finishing the former one,and we end up paying for both..definitely expect more professionalism from a place like this..The pricing though on the higher side but worthy of the food served here,indeed cullinary expertise of the highest order..Loved the concept of serving Kebabs on sizzler plates..its adds a punch to the dish..However won't recommend having heavy booze here since the prices are way too steep..A 60ml Jack Daniels would cost you Rs.895/-!!!something you will find in a 5-star establishment..Last time we went there they had some Kebab festival going on..
We had Mutton Shikari Kebab and a Chicken Kebab..both served on Sizzler plates and were soft,juicy and spicy..loved the charredness..Highly Recommended..We also ordered Chicken Teriyaki which was not that great though..The Chicken was a bit stiff and the sauce didn't blend well with the protein..We also ordered some cocktails and they were quite nice too..loved the mixing..Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.2600/-(incl tax) for the starters and few drinks for 3 people..Highly Recomended..
Food: 4.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 3.5/5

Visited this place tonight with a colleague ..... The most elegant rooftop view of the city under the evening sky ..... Soothing breeze caressing our drooping spirits .....
Coming to the F&B service ....
The service staff were cordial ..... We tried out Blenders' Pride & Smirnoff with lime cordial for the drinks accompanied by Chicken Lat-me-kai and Veg spring rolls ..... The chicken appetizer was really superb .... We found a lot of Western grills & sizzlers on the menu which we plan to try out on my subsequent visits to this nice place ... To add to the ambiance was the live guitar performance,  but the volume was too loud for comfort .....
However, a delightful experience as far as the first visit is concerned .....:-)

This is my THE mosttt favourite place in Calcutta when it comes to ambience. Blue and Beyond's splendid view from the roof top is just breathtaking.. awesome ambience with great music..a MUST visit with friends or your loved one for drinks.. they serve a.wide variety of liquor..food options are plenty as well. Last time i visited it, it was late Saturday evening and slightly crowded..Today, visited this place after a month, in the afternoon ( happy hours ) time with a friend..and it was pretty much empty. The weather was not too warm, infact it was extremwly breezy,so chose to sit on the terrace itself.. we ordered 2 glasses of Sula Chenin Blanc( sparkling white wine ), along with Reshmi Kebabs..later also ordered Chicken Lat Mai Kai.. both were extremely well-cooked..the kebabs were soft and succulent, but the Lat mai kai stole the show. Ended with few puffs of Cohiba Mini Cigar.. Lovely time spent. After the happy hours discount, the bill for 2 came up to 1900. And it was absolutely worth it.

This is a place that can take away all your week's tiredness and give you back a wonderful evening to remember !! Celebrating the serenity of the city of the joy.. this place is located in the hustle bustle corner of new market... And yet would never fail you when it comes to a peaceful outing... Located of the 10th floor of Lindsay hotel... It provides you an awesome view of the Howrah bridge on one side and the kolkata life on another... You can lose yourself to the tunes of the best bands and enjoy the blowing breeze .ambience is superb!! Being a veggie... I don't get to like much places in kolkata... But this place didn't let me down when it came to food!!! I had jalape√±os poppers as starters followed by the main course of butter paneer masala, naan , bundi raita, and veg biryani with a sweet lime soda...and I enjoyed every bit of it...it's a bit overprice, but its totally worth it.... I would definitely recommend everyone to be there at least once !!

Happen to go to this place today. . Was on my list for almost a month.
The way to the place was so spooky and clumsy as the main lift was not working. 
Finally wen reached felt good.
Good and happy faces.. great welcome to us. Great ambience and sooting lighting. 
The place is one of a kind... a true view to city of kolkata from the rooftop. 
The food is also tasy and yum.. the drums of heaven is what I liked with a pint of beer. 
Worth the money...tasty and awesome view.

Well well well.. fond memories attached to this place! The rooftop setting, the dim lightings, the breezy weather , soft music playing in the background sets out a decent romantic ambience!! I have been here for my share of drinks so I would not be able to suggest a lot about the dining here!! But what you cant miss out is on the lovely rooftop view of the entire city from up here.. And after a few drinks , everything else is just perfect !! ;) :p
In a place like the new market ..atop the tall Lindsay..what else could you possibly want.. A dinner date with your love cannot go wrong in a place like this!!

A very nice restaurant with a beautiful romantic ambience that too located in the middle of new market. Once you come here, you will take yourself away from the hustle and bustle of the city life and get yourself lost with your loved ones. The food is really good too. We had London special mixed grill, Roquefort prawns, prawn cocktail for the main course. For desserts, we had cream caramel and tutti fruity. The main course was perfect. But I think the cream caramel could have been better. They even have us a 20% discount because we visited during the happy hours. You can make your romantic date perfect and indulge yourself in the most exotic way. Happy Dining! :)

For me, this rooftop restobar atop the Lindsay Hotel is like a still from a dream. The open air, the sitting area beautifully done up in white, the gurgling fountain surrounded by ornamental plants-overlooking the city in all its glory literally takes your breath away. What's even more pleasing is that they have an amazing playlist including your favourite tracks from james blunt, john mayer, coldplay, beatles and even pink floyd that transports you to another kind of heaven. They offer a wide range of cocktails from which we ordered the blue lagoon ,strawberry kiss, mai-tai and Bloody Mary,the drinks were all deliciously mixed. On the waiter's recommendation, we took chicken teriyaki and the dewangi platter which had a lip-smacking combo of barbequed tender chicken,lamb coupled with fresh water fish and prawn. Next came up the sizzlers- Chicken a la Greque and Mixed grilled-London house. The latter was an assortment of shrimps, lamb chops, chicken sausages and fish with a topping of onion rings and fried eggs. Both were served with jacket potatoes, saute√©d vegetables and garlic bread...Truly a treat for our tastebuds. The penne pasta with mixed sauce and garlic bread also left us raving. For dessert we treated ourselves to American Banana Split which consisted of three scoops of vanilla,chololate and strawberry ice cream scattered with chocolate chips on a bed of banana...and yes it was as delicious as it sounds,if not more! We sat in the open air, late into the evening, sipping from our glasses of whiskey and gazing at the amazing skyline, as we let ourselves drown in the surroundings. And it felt like time itself seemed to slow down. Isn't this what romantic dining is all about!!! Now all the pampering is going to cost you for sure, but Blue and Beyond is a must visit for every Kolkatan, if not for anything, just the ambiance.

The price will not satisfy you but yes a big group with loads of foodie people will help you get adjusted to the price. The food is good. Want to get the bird's eye view of old kolkata as this is located on top of the lindsay hotel. Then this is the place for you. The kabab platter and sizzlers are good.

NOT RECOMMENDED. not at all. never had a worse experience. the staff is highly rude and incompetent. no manners as to how their customers need to be treated.¬†
today i had gone there to celebrate my birthday dinner . i chose the place solely on the basis of reviews on zomato. i made prior reservations specifying for the 'lounge chairs' , good 6 hrs in advance . and when i arrived, i was not allowed to sit there . reason i got was that only ppl more than 5 in no. could take those seats, inspite of those places being empty . i had to make requests, and still they were not considered. i had spoken to Mr Abhijeet who was least co-operative. there was another lady co-worker who had absolutely no manners and it seemed like she was purposely trying to put us down. keeping the attitude aside, we were also denied our choice of alcohol(beer) and the food was also just descent. We were so upset that we jus decided to skip dessert and wanted to get out out of that place asap.
i had selected this particular place only for the rooftop ambience which after i was denied, i had to move indoors. the entire incident has been disappointing to the next level, ruined my special occasion evening. the food and the ambience was not as flamboyant as the sarcasm of the staff. i would never want to visit this place ever again even if my life depend on it !! highly dissapointed and upset.

One of the very few rooftop restaurants in Kolkata with a view that stretches across the new market and esplanade area. One might consider it too hot to visit during the summer, but there are indoor seating arrangements as well. Though, I would suggest you sit in the open area with the curtains, cushions and low couches. The outdoor area also allows smoking.
I had visited the place for lunch on New Year's Eve. Though the menu was cut short for the festive season, it was a lovely experience with delicious food. The chicken teriyaki appetizer, mutton steak and  Chinese sizzler are highly recommended. I have also been told that the brownie with ice cream is a must have dessert.
They provide valet parking, however driving up to Lindsay Hotel through the packed road can be terribly tedious. I hope to visit again on a cool evening.

Cool breeze and a rooftop view were the only great things of my first visit to BnB and it was my B'day party too. I had good expectations from this place but they failed to b met. Drinks were not chilled, Food was not hot. Cocktails were a disappointment. Long Island Iced Tea, Maitai, Cosmopolitan were everything else except for what's a cocktail. Teriyaki Chicken and Mahi Afghani tasted very good and succulent but they were cold. Chicken a la Grecque and Mutton steak - London house are sizzlers but they were not @ all sizzling. They tasted good but! We asked them to get it hot not taking it cold this time and they got back to us just warm! What's the point am making if the drinks r warm and food's cold, its the experience, tasty food (though it could have been great) and just my luck!! I hope u have a better experience.

Blue and beyond is situated on the rooftop of the Lindsey hotel, opposite the Hogg market. The place is just paradise for people who love to hangout with friends . It has awesome food and even better view. It is a popular joint for people who loves to drink and some nice sizzler and Chinese food. 
The place have been recently renovated. Trust me if not for food or alcohol one should just visit the place for its ambience and feel. It is infectiously lively !!

The ambiance is the USP for this place, you gettu have a good view of Kolkata, Second bridge, Victoria palace. The splendid view, lots of breeze, cocktails, sizzlers add up to make it a memorable time.¬†

Cons-
I would have rated it 5 had the indoor seating been more ventilated and serviced better because we had to shift indoors when it got too windy and there were signs of rain. The indoors got way too suffocating since the A.C was'nt working and the sizzlers were choking us with suffocation.

First thing that greets a customer on his way to this place is the insane New Market chaos. Then he gets into the Lindsay Hotel building and is guided by helpful guards to the elevator which he takes to the topmost floor. A few turns and behold this amazing place! Rooftop, beautifully decorated and with the right music playing!¬†
Second thing that greets the customer is the menu card that is loaded with continental and standard choices. The food is amazing, maybe not out of the world but way above average and better than most restaurants in this price bracket. Service is prompt but can be more. It took them more than five minutes to notice us sitting right in the middle of affairs.¬†
Third thing that greets the customer is the sunset and the city skyline. Grab a beer, light a cigarette, take a bite and relish them with a lovely view of the city.

Ambience is just excellent and if you go for a dinner the view of the city at night from this rooftop restaurant is just amazing. The food is good and decently priced. There is also a person playing flute which adds to the beauty. The service is also good. One suggestion i have for the restaurant is try to improve the quality of the chinese dishes you serve and bring more variety. Overall we had a good time and i would recommend to try this place.

I have been visiting this roof top delight in the city since I was a kid! Food is good, there is a great bar with interesting mocktails and cocktails! But, what one should visit this place for, is definitely definitely definitely the ambiance! The feel this restaurant gives, is like no other! You are greeted by an ever-smiling lift-man at the beginning! You go into a hotel and then to it's rooftop plaza! The view of south Kolkata's busiest area and beyond makes you joyous! Though I loved the old decor, the revamp has been chic and upped the glam quotient! An interesting place to visit!

The setting, from entrance to the final sitting arrangements, in a word - beauty !
Rarely you have such places in Kolkata. The roof top with the view of the whole city below, windy, with the flower and plant arrangements is surly admirable !
As for the food - I had a very bad experience with the crispy lamb as starter, it was too salty ! Later it was fixed. It kind of killed my appetite. The main course - sizzlers, brought back flavours. The drinks were as expected. But yes, the mentioning of music is needed, it sure did bring back teen-hood memories !

Blue And Beyond is one of its kind restaurants at the rooftop of Hotel Lindsay. The hotel is locates opposite the New Market at the Globe theatre side entrance. The place is huge and offers a birdseye view of the surroundings. Along with that, it serves delicious food and a heart warming ambiance. The place is open and perfect for a date and a good time with whoever you seek it from. Evenings can be enjoyed the most at this place.

Their service seemed professional and prompt and the guys out here would take care of your orders swiftly without a delay. I loved the arrangements in their bar as it's quite surreal. The prices might be towards the higher side but you wouldn't find a place like this anywhere around this area. I'd definitely recommend Blue And Beyond to everyone.

**Happy hours are from 12 Noon to 4PM all week including weekends. 25% Discount on total bill amount during this time period. (Updated information as of 08 June 2015).

Blue and beyond is one of those romantic places to taka your girlfriend to for a quick celebration.Though I dropped in for lunch,I believe the place looks even more amazing at night.It has an easy-to-find location and is at the 10th floor of Lindsay hotel.
Service and ambience were quick and prompt , the cushions won my heart. We opted for an indoor seating despite the place being known for its outdoors.(the heat was unbearable).
Coming to food, the restaurant was serving a special chinese menu foto poila baishakh and that was the only menu we had to choose from.We ordered for a Manhattan and a frozen margharita, both of which weren't upto the mark at all. But the food made up for it. Chicken teriyaki was perfect:the sauce being exactly the way I love it and the chunks of chicken were succulent. The gong bao fish was a bit bland,but still better than the cocktails. The bill amounted to a not-so decent sum considering the drinks which made up for half the price.
I Dont wish to visit the place again.but even if I do, I I make sure its not during poila baisakh and during the day, coz for both these reasons,u miss out on a lot .

An absolutely different experience and a wonderfully pleasant ambience from the normal hum drum one gets at the other restaurants. I would definitely keep visiting this place more often and recommend it to others. There is one particular aspect that irked though. When I tried to get reservations I was told that on weekends reservations are not taken for people coming after 7 pm. However when we went there,  we found there were a few unoccupied tables. On requesting for arrangements to be made for us to sit there, we were told that those tables were reserved leaving me flummoxed.
I sincerely hope that the management does not discriminate amongst its patrons, and is there is any such practice it should be immediately stopped.

This is a very posh bar located just opposite to the legendary 'New Market'. To start with they should have kept in mind about parking before opening this place. Valet Parking is available but due to the locality and the chaos that refuses to stop all day you tend to worry a lot about the safety of your car. The outside seating area is well decorated and is a lovely place for hanging out. The seating area at the corner with the shade is quite uncomfortable. They need to change the stools with cusions with proper chairs/couch. The prices are quite on the high side and the food is good but nothing that will pull you back to this place. The biggest positive is the view which is serene. Perfect place to hangout with your loved ones during summer.

To be honest, this is the most romantic pub I have visited in Kolkata. Makes it even better if you target the happy hours during the dusk.
I would not say that they serve awesome food, but it is a little more than above average, a 3.5/5 for the food.
Ambiance + Music = 5/5. Wish the music was a little louder than it generally is.
An added advantage of Blue and Beyond is you would fall in love with Kolkata all over again and if you wish to surprise your company he/she/they would fall in love with you.
My verdict: Make the visit.
My tip: Avoid summer afternoons if you want an outdoor seating.

It had been a fantastic evening there. It was my spulmate's birthday. I talked to them to arrange a table well decorated with baloons, candles and roses. They provided table number 2. I guess it is the most wanted table for those who want to enjoy the scenic beauty of Kolkata as well as a cosy dinner with someone special... so it was wonderful..!! :-) :-) Spring was in the air, the air was blowing well... and the ambience.. it was just perfect. When you will step in the Hotel Lindsay.. it is all about CITY OF JOY--KOLKATA! <3 <3

We ordered starters, cocktails and main course also... Mahi afgani and Mojito cocktail were just wow! I would love to visit this place again just to eat that mahi afgani dish, actually its vetki dish in peshwari style. The dish was suggested by them. Service and suggestions were very good..not merely satisfactory...¬†

Go and have a great time! (y)
and don't miss mahi afgani! :-)

I found them very nice and helpful.but about the food I was truly frustrated.they don't even use rui fish for fish finger,forget deshi sweet bhetki.they use the smelly Bombay bhetki which is used in cheap roadside joints and biyebaris by caterers.this is unacceptable.ya the ambience is number one in Kolkata.

A decent place but way below my expectations!! The food was not upto the mark! The lamb was not properly cooked!! The chicken sizzler was not worth it!! The thai curry was still decent!!

The most attractive part of this place is its ambiance.In the middle of ¬†a most crowded place in Kolkata a open air rooftop arrangement on the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay will definitely give you a wonderful feeling. The food we ordered was quit good specially ¬†Konjee Crispy Lamb, Lat Me Kai and Grilled Lamb Chops. The service was also good.¬†
So overall ¬†a nice place to hangout with friends with nice music,good food and a lovely ambiance.

Decor : 4.5
The place has an outdoor seating that looks upon the Howrah bridge and other renowned buildings. The other side looks upon the new market area.
Every Tuesday they have candle light arrangements which is perfect for couples going out for dinner. However they play rock music of bands like Guns&Roses, etc which sets a funny mood. And the music from the mosque also adds to it.

Food:
I really hate having vegetarian best friends sometimes.
So there was this veg appetisers called Jalapeno popper which is also not present in the zomato menu. It tasted fine. I only enjoyed the besan ka coating.
Giving it 2.5
Pesto spaghetti : 3.0 nothing extraordinary.
Apple tart : 4.0 must try.

Value for money : they have higher price in their recent menu than what you see in the zomato menu. Not all but some.
So 3.5

Service: 3.5

I don't really visit the new market area often but if I do I may visit this place for the rooftop arrangement if not anything else.

Being a foodie i came to this place very often, but not food. Only the ambience and open air concept. We r paying here just for the concept. Nothing else. Food quality was not good, but becomes poorer day by day. Why not they appoint a good sheff i don't know. Anyways hope this review will open the eyes of the management so that we can recommend others about it.

This is a restaurant you take your girl to.Everything about it, from the food to the service, is just perfect!!! The service at the bar is prompt and the waiters really do mean business. And every dish of lamb that they serve are simply out of this world. The price is a bit on the higher side and cost for two generally touches the Rs.1800 mark (add another 100 to tip the waiter), but if you are not really short of cash, you won't mind spending it here. Come in the evening and you'd realize how wonderful this place actually is. And being at the top of 10th floor of the Lindsay Hotel, I think this is one of ¬†the best rooftops in the city. My love and I, are in love with this place and I can't thank Blue And Beyond enough for all those wonderful lazy weekend afternoons that I've spent here. (P.S. Its a smoker's heaven)

I never had any idea of such a wonderful place existing in the ever crowded New Market area. Thanks to Zomato, for igniting my desire to try Blue and Beyond, it was a mesmerizing experience throughout. Perhaps, one of the best rooftops in the city. The great view of the places around and the evening breeze, are perfect!! 

I went there on an evening, the place is on the 10th floor terrace of Lindsay Hotel. The passage leading to the restaurant (rather resto-bar) is full of wall pictures of great Bengali artists, the filmmakers and all. The main restaurant place has a bartender's area, an indoor place to dine and larger open air sitting area. They allow people to smoke in the open air, so a bit irritating for non-smokers!! Overall their open air sitting is perfect for boozing, gangs of your peers or a romantic dinner. I managed few minutes to enjoy the view of the city from different angles, fabulous! Especially the view of the Museum. A guy was playing flute over there, he was really good to enrich the ambiance.

Coming to the food, we didn't order much, just a Non-veg Tom Yum soup, Paneer tikka, Grilled chicken sausage and lime soda, coke to finish it off. Food was decent, could have been better though. Soup and sausages were Ok, I liked the paneer tikka most. The waiters were very polite, but service is very slow. But honestly I didn't mind much to enjoy the time under the stars and the melodious flute being played. :)

Overall a wonderful experience. But the quality of food and service should be better to match up with the ambiance, that would make Blue and Beyond a sought after place!

One of the most old hotel in Kolkata, has got an amazing d√©cor and interior. Upscale. Food and service quality is good. As I have been living in dubai I love to smoke while drinking. In India most of the restaurant and bar say a big no for smoking. I couldn't really enjoy night out here that way until I found out about  this place and what made me feel like am in paradise out of no where , a roof top bar with an amazing view of the heart of the city. Having a glance at Howrah bridge; a cool breeze ; sipping at LIT was really awesome. I feel like this place is perfect for any occasion. I feel to go for a candle light dinner. Though the draft beer made me laugh, not chilled and way too different. What am being used to with back in there. According to me its perfect place to drink with some little food not for full course dinner.

When I went there for the first time, it was a chilly December evening. We had Sizzlers on the table, Bryan Adams on the speakers and we were enthralled by the most amazing view of my own city. Have revisited this place 3-4 times and with each visit my experience only got better. The sizzlers (try London House and Paneer Shashlik) are very good and Mahi Afgaani is a must try.

Well I have been to this place a number of times before. However, with its new interiors I was expecting much more from this place.
Although the menu card has a long list of beers , when you ask for it many are unavailable.
We chose to order from the continental menu, and it's a bit disheartening ! The fish that was ordered had that typical smell and the mutton steak had too much lentils! The only satisfying dish was the lamb chops which were well done!
Their trp continues to be the location! The windy terrace never disappoints you and nor does the music or interiors!

I am giving this low rating just for the special arrangement on special day to generate more revenue. I have no doubt about the location or ambiance. I would have given 4.5 but on 14th February they made 'special' arrangement. Small tables which can hardly hold 2 plates at a time. There were candle stand, a rose and menu already on the table. So the food plates were struggling to fit in. Menu was so short and overpriced for that day only. I mainly went there to have continental food but alas. 4-5 items were there. All the items were specially named and so was illegible for visitors. Two foreigners asked me for help as they were in distress with the menu. Prices were higher than the regular menu. The tables were arranged so closely to fit more and more tables that even waiters cannot reach each table, so imagine what can happen to the visitors. Food was average. Nothing special. They should think about increasing the quantity now after increasing the price. But full number for their creation of ambiance of rooftop open candlelight dinner with live violin playing romantic tunes. I had a high expectation from them. But now I am thinking twice should I go for that high budget again? Won't it be visiting a casino? Have to decide.

This place had been on my wishlist for quite a long time and so when I saw it in the Zomato Valentine's day collection,I decided to finally pay it a visit.

Located on the terrace of Lindsay Hotel,it gives one a picturesque view and a captivating ambiance.

The place was decorated specially on Valentine's day with heart shaped balloons. We had a reservation for lunch and were given outdoor seats.

They had a special Valentine's day menu. On recommendation of the waiter,we took a bottle of Sula Brut Methode Tradtionelle(sparkling wine) and it was wonderful,crisp and light.
For food,we took a mixed non veg platter and butter naan with chicken rezala. The taste of food was good but the mutton kebab, initially, was not cooked,but on complaining,the replacement kebab they gave,was much better.All in all an amazing experience. It is every bit of romantic that it promises to be and is great for a date. Looking forward to a candlelight dinner here.

The cocktails were decent. This is one place where you will enjoy the view and weather simultaneously..
Reasonably priced and a place you can enjoy with family,friends and a perfect candle light dinner with someone special!

Being here thrice in a row that too in the same month has made this place my favourite hangout !
The location of this restaurant definitely adds an oomph factor as young crowd of kolkata or who-ever visits kolkata goes to new market once for sure :D
The ambiance, the decor, the view, the breeze... I've fallen completely in love with blue & beyond ! 
I am not a big foodie, but yeah i like to eat good stuff.... the price of the dishes here are slightly on the higher side but the place itself makes up for it :)
The staff are very courteous and the food served is okie-dokie.
Not too rich.... yet quite tasty !
I 've had 
Lat me Kai chicken... it is a bit spicy.
Mahi afghani.... Awesome fish-dish... truly lip smacking :)
Golden fried prawn... this dish tastes really good... but u cannot eat it with spoon ;) have to use fingers :D
Teriyaki chicken... the smell of ginger adds to the flavour !
chiken biriyani... they give two leg pieces of chicken and an egg too... now that really talks high about the value for money :)
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† To add to this i would like to say that they don't make the biriyani quite rich, thus no gastric problems guaranteed ;)
For the dessert section i would suggest to go for the tutti fruti... the fruit-in-icecream stuff can really make your day :)

For people using cars... they have valet parking also available... :)

Such a beautiful place in an over crowded area like New Market is unexpected. Thumbs up for the ambience!! 
Comming to service: Not satisfactory!! We had to wait atleast for 20 minutes to get the menu card and then another 15 minutes to put the order... Although the food arrived on time. Please do make the necessary planning in this field!!
Food: Chicken Teriyaki was delicious and beautifully presented!! Drums of Heaven could had been better had it been served hot but was okey...
Overall a nice experience...maybe just because of the ambience I dint mind sitting there for the extra minutes...

The most interesting new bar in Calcutta. It's not fancy. But it's quaintly cool. And that too right in the middle of New Market. Open air. Fantastic views!

One will surely be taken aback by this place. Truly one of those hidden treasures that new market has to offer. Located just opposite to simpark mall, blue and beyond is on the 9th floor of hotel lindsay. The view from the 9th floor is  breathtaking. The ambience is just perfect for a romantic date or maybe hanging out with your coterie of friends. The hallway which leads to the restaurant is done up with pictures of tolly stars from yesteryears. This place gets full marks for the ambience and the service offered, no doubt on that. I cannot comment a lot on the food though as I just had a few starters and they were just passable. The portions are small and do not justify the price that it charges. This place is good a tranquil evening over a few drinks with your closed ones. One good thing is you dont get an inflated bill which is usually the status quo at some other popular bars and pubs around. Normal vat and service tax amounting to 15% on the total bill (instead of 30% at spe or irish house). One must definitely check this out just for the ambience if not anything else :)

As they say themselves, The 'rooftop restro bar' is unique in its kind. I was quite in a hurry that day I ended up going there accompanied by my wife, it was a warm afternoon though. One of the server offered us a seat at the edge nearer to the bar itself which was changed to a table of three outside on request. I was pleased to see the reaction of the server when I made the request. He was cordial and helpful enough.

We tried Salty Dog for the first time and it was quite an experience. I heard they make quite good coffee and cocktail, it is the time I certify that also.

I also liked the food items prepared. We ordered for teriyaki chicken and chicken al a grique, both the dishes tasted nice. It was a nice suggestion to try the later by the server.

So far so good, a small thing which caught my sense was they were more attentive towards and keen to serve the foreigners more than us. This discrimination, if minimized would result in more goodwill of the restaurant. Though this would not stop me for going there again with perhaps more time in my hand and couple of friends.

Okay went their for just casual lunch. I must say that this place is really cool. the ambiance wins it all. it is just spectacular. It is situated on the 9th floor of hotel lindsay.the view of kolkata from this restaurant is ¬†so amazing that you can spend hours here. It has three sections most beautiful is the outdoor seating one.we sat their only. We ordered two fresh lime soda. nan, lamb sizzler and a mutton mince kabab type of sizzler I am not able to recall the exact name of the dishes and also banana split with ice cream. I must tell that for me the food was not very good quality it just tasted decent I mean the lamb sizzler tasted a little better than the mutton sizzler. It was too dry inside and it was very crumbly may b they used a lot of lentil in the kabab as I did not tasted any meat i it. ¬†The nan was also good nothing extraordinary but but nothing bad. The staff was really friendly and was present at all times for any service we required. The food was served real quick. But seriously i will visit again just for the ambiance. It is really amazing.
Pros-AMBIANCE!!!
-food tasted good except for the mutton mince sizzler
-staff is very friendly
-service was quick and according to the instructions
-price charged was fine for me
Cons-Mutton mince kabab sizzler was just not good.¬†
No other con

Finally, after a long wait, I had the chance of visiting Blue and Beyond.¬†
Located in an old clandestine area of Kolkata, this place has quite the opposite feel to it.¬†
The rooftop setting with Kolkata as your backdrop leaves you delightfully satisfied. The romantic feeling might be an added charm for those who are on dates.¬†
I visited here with a bunch of colleagues to try the very famous and chic, Cosmopolitan. It was my first experience of Cosmopolitan so I have nothing to compare it with. But the drink was spectacular. The service was quick and prompt. I have no complains whatsoever.¬†
Sometime soon I would like to visit again and watch the sun go down peacefully with a glass of wine and some lip smacking food.

What a brilliant romantic ambience. The place to be on a winter evening with your date. The view from this place is really nice. The hotel it's situated in has an old calcutta charm to it. Valet is available so no problem there. The food is nice, nothing exceptional. However, the romantic ambience is sure to make you fall in love with your partner. Although new market area did make me sceptical about visiting this place but boom I was on a perfect date!

The least expected location for a rooftop restaurant: the most congested bylane of Kolkata - Lindsay street in New Market. You just can't stumble upon the place unless you know it. The view is a little disappointing, but everything else works out good. The pic out here is a little better than the actual look but it's not disappointing at all. A slightly above average roof top restaurant, but only slightly.

BLUE N BEYOND,roof top view,amazing ambience,chilled breeze of air and the feeling was awesome...now coming  to the food..starting with starters the chilli prawn and pan fried chilli fish almost tasted the same,ajwain jinga yet was another disappointment and tangri kabab was the worst among all..The charcoal flavour was missing in all the ordered tandoor items..last but not the least the sizzler tasted average..though the food didnt suit my palate much yet I must say the service ambience were appreciable...
Just a lil improvement in the menu can make ur restaurant one of the best in kolkata..‚ò∫

Frankly speakn ..i was prty disappointed by this place. After seeing the pictures and all i had high expectations frm this place but it didn quite match up. rooftop resturant with one part having the view of new market other part had the bridge view. But not that much great as shown. Probably should have visited during evening for a candle light experience. But i found one f the cushions stained there..maintainance not so great. N food.. i liked none. If its for a cozy bf-gf outn or bestie gossip evening then definitely its good..but there are better places as well.. so i cant give much rating to this place.. and as for shall i visit this place again? probably no ..

We ordered kind of the whole menu. Great variety in everything be it veg or non veg. The open lounge is pretty comfortable and they don't say anything if you make noise. :) cool hangout place for sure ;)

For me there is one place for the perfect lunch, the Blue and Beyond, restaurant with its mouth watering offerings is simply irresistible. Everyone knows that lunch has to be fulfilling and complete as it is meal at the middle of the whole day. At the same time nutritious value and quality should be kept in mind. Take any food item and it is simply awesome, like their tandoori platter or crispy chili babycorn or veg spring roll and my mouth starts drooling. On the non veg items I like golden fried prawn this is Chinese delicacy prepared with prawn dipped in seasoned batter. The prawn laced in sauce in simply gorgeous. Also my favourite is another dish, chicken nuggets, this crispy fried chicken is out of the world in terms of the flavour, texture and taste. Whenever I go to the restaurant I try one of their soups like sweet corn soup, or French onion soup. Yumm on the platters of sizzlers malai aloo achari paneer hits inside the mouth with cream cheesy potato delicately spiced or Calypso fish, a Caribbean styled preparation with grilled fresh fish topped with pineapple salsa. The restaurant has assembled Chinese, Indian, Burmese and thai, items so there is a lot of chance to experiment with food paradise.

A great place to stop for a quick bite if you are tired of shopping. Great ambience,  lovely view of the city of joy. They have tried to create a fusion between continental & Indian cuisine.  Ordered for Veg Sizzler, Chicken Sizzler & Fish Finger. Veg patty was made of cottage cheese which wasn't held properly together. So the moment you cut open, it was into pieces & chunks. Besides when asked for Garlic bread wiyh cheese, couldn't serve. Anyways the boiled veggies & the sauce used was nice. The other two items were good. Overall an average experience. Need to improve the service & work on the menu.

Ambience: "The Perfect Date" restaurant is what I like to call it. Needless to say the roof top factor adds to the awesomeness of the place. View is very good. It has utter romantic decor, lightings and music. There are both open air and A/C segments. Seats are more comfortable in the A/C segment though. I rate it 4.5/5.

Food: Quantity is sufficient and quality is excellent. I had tried sizzlers and it was delicious. I rate it 4/5.

Service: High in demand so low in speed. Staff is well behaved but not technically courteous. As in, they might not pull the chair for you but will listen patiently to your order n reply politely. And that suffices. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Bit costly. I grabbed a discount coupon before going there.

Overall I give it 4/5.

Classless in the one word, also the manager didnt seem to give a *** when we politely asked him to reduce the volume by 10:30 pm...

Also they advertise draught beer pitchers and towers.. which is, as you can guess, a lie...
never going back.

Have been to this place several times since I love it's ambience, especially after it was revamped. But unfortunately my last visit wasn't pleasant at all. Firstly , we asked for cocktails and were let down coz there ice machine were not working. Even the alcohol was served with just chilled soda. After half an hour, a big group of foreigners arrived there and looked for a place were they can sit together. They happened to like the very place were we were seated. As a result, the manager was rude enough to hand us the bill out of the blue and inform that we need to vacate the place! REALLY!! Shouldn't they have at least  bothered to request us to relocate to a different seat or at least inform us about the issue!! It seems that they are more interested to entertain the foreign tourist and ignore the local customers! DISAPPOINTED!

This hidden gem of a place is housed on the rooftop of Hotel Lindsay in the New Market area.I can vouch for the fact that almost all foodies must have passed by this place without being aware of this excellent watering hole.
If you want to have a panoramic view of the Kolkata skyline and watch the sun go down, want to have a drink or two in a calm and serene atmosphere at Esplanade amidst all the chaos,have a romantic dinner date then this has to be your go-to place without burning a hole in your pocket.
The seating is comfortable with pristine white garden chairs,cosy sofas, dim lighting,excellent music.Seating area is divided in to several sections-indoor lounge,private dining hall and the outdoor area.
The drinks menu is pretty exhaustive and a vast array of cocktails and imported premium liquor is available.No idea how authentic the cocktails are and i intend to sample them in my next visit.I had enjoyed my favourite vodka-Absolut Blue.
The food menu is limited and the taste of the items is lacking to a certain extent.I had the Lat me Kai chicken-a chinese dish which had small cubes of chicken stir fried in spring onion.The chicken 65- a south indian dish was not authentic at all and was served with mint chutney.I have had better versions of Chicken 65 elsewhere.Somehow the food failed to impress me.Maybe wrong choice.
Prices are on the higher side but much cheaper than other more reputed lounge bars.Staff behaviour is polite and courteous.Service is relaxed and not rushed up at all.¬†
Truth be told i am hooked on to Blue and Beyond.:)
P.S. Since the seating is in an open area smoking is allowed.Thus it is a added bonus for smokers:)

A roof top restaurant on the tenth floor building is not something that you come across very often. It is the best rooftop restaurant I have been to in kolkata.
Visit this place in the day time for the view of old kolkata.
At the night for candlelight and romantic dinner with your partner.
Even though it provides a awesome ambience the quality of food doesn't really do any justice. If you are a vegetarian you can give this place a miss. Even for non-vegetarian there isn't much of options. And what ever is there its average. Staff is helpful and courteous. Visit the place for view and ambience.

The rooftop view is mind blowing, and is apt for a warm sunny day. The seating is superb, and the whole decor resonates with the name. We ordered kungpao chicken sizzler and teriyaki chicken. Teriyaki chicken was out of the world, very tender very tasty. Kungpao could've been better. Quantity is moderate, just enough for two people with an average appetite. The service was good. Prices are a bit high, but the setting makes it all worth it.

being tempted by the reviews in zomato and the pictures which shows the scenic beauty of this place and being suggested by a friend we decided to hit this one fine sundy evening! and guess what! we definitely made a right choice! situated on the 10th floor of the Hotel Lindsay, this outdoor bar-cum-restaurant captures the facing New market. The framed pictures at the entrance depicts the golden era of Bengali cinema. we ordered for a Harvey Wallbanger and a Heineken lager beer with a plate of chicken teriyaki. since it has an outdoor seating arrangement, smoking is allowed. we ordered for a packet of classic regular and it costed us 145 bucks without taxes and vat. the wallbanger was rightly tendered and i loved it :* ¬†the teriyaki was also good. price is on the higher side, we paid a total Rs. 1147; but then its okay compared to the atmosphere they provide. One thing i must state we both did not like to have groundnuts with our drinks. Infact we both don't like groundnuts. the staffs there are courteous and helpful. ambience is too good. Its really 'Beyond' our expectations. looking forward to our second visit! ¬†:)

Situated on the top floor of "hotel lindsay". The "blue and beyond" fits more than perfectly for this joint. Everything over here is literally "beyond" expectation and imagination. From the spectacular aquamarine shaded false ceilings in the interior area. The cozy cream sofas, the sleek bar chairs, the graphical cushion pillows everything is just majestic. Now coming to the open air sitting area- The acrolyc work on the sofas here gives yiu a feeling to be close to nature, then the lights which hangs over each table are "mesmerizing piece of artwork". Seems like every furniture and accessories were handpicked nature itself to give you that holistic feeling. Now finally coming to the view of the open horizon which couldn't be described in words. Sitting with someone close to you and enjoying such a smothering view of nature in a breathe taking ambience and sipping your favorite drink is something unbeatable and unmatchable. The foods offered here are awesome too. They serve indian, chinese, continental etc and with utter perfection. Their sizzlers, golden fried prawn, kung pao chicken are among the best. World renowned cocktails like-white russian, gimlet, jim collin, mojito, margarita etc are delivered with conviction too. The experience in this place "Blue and beyond" is indeed "Beyond" explanation and could only understood when you will pay a visit here. Hurry up there is a piece of gem waiting for you here, don't lag behind!!

Blue and beyond is the place where you would find the food of your choice. With outstanding restful environment the restaurant offers something more. The food is heavenly I personally recommend everyone to come to this place and relish each of their item. I simply love their veg appetizers such as paneer tikka and mashroom kali mirch. The first one spicy cottage cheese slices cooked in tandoor and the second item is mashroom saut√©ed in black pepper sauce. It is truly refreshing. Also their golden fried prawn is simply irresistible. This prawn preparation is cooked in butter. Also another favoutire item is chicken nuggets. This crispy chicken is yummy. Your kids will surely love it. Among their massive collection of soup items I ordered French onion soup, then came my steamed pulao with hot garlic lamb. The lamp curry and rice combination was superb. After that I had Thai chicken curry. The taste and flavour of all that was simply gorgeous. Lastly the apple tart completed the whole meal.

This is one of the best roof top restaurants in kolkata, situated in the middle of new market. This is a perfect place to hangout in the evening in winters. The food is good and the service too is satisfactory. The prices are similar too good park street restaurants. There is happy hours everyday from 12-4.

Ambience location are awesome. In new market, my expectations were much lower. I was looking for a beer and a good view but they have a nicely fine roof top. We had beer and they took 15 minutes to get it. Apparently the waiter forgot to give our order to the bar. Considering there was only one other table occupied that is pretty much as bad as service can get. I think if you just want beer and a good ambience this is still a place to try out. Its on top of Lindsay hotel.

Did you check the cover pic? Yes it is as good as that in reality.¬†
Very well maintained. A rare place in Kolkata and it's surprising to know that many people don't know about this joint, yet.¬†
You will have a wonderful day. Come with friends. But not on an economic day. It's expensive. Depends on your wallet. Sizzlers will cost somewhere round 450 without VAT and drinks cost bombs. But yes it is worth paying. A premium food joint I must say. Good news for faggots! You can smoke when you are under the open sky. And please don't be a fool who will choose the Air Conditioned side. It is a windy place and you actually pay for the sexy view of Kolkata that the terrace offers.¬†
Nothing special to mention about their food. Good quality, decent taste. :)

First time i visited the place, it was hardly impressive. The entrance through the very crowded lindsay street was most unimpressive but they my friend convinced me that the best is yet to come. It was so true... You can really look down to the entire Kolkata from the roof top restaurant. The food is excellent, the view is something you should not miss, especially at sunset, get a beer pitcher some nice side orders and you are all set for blast with old buddies or better still take your lady love, nestle in a cosy chair overlooking the terrace and enjoy a drink or two and look at the sunset behind the Howrah bridge sky line, nothing could be any better.

Much hyped restaurant with absolutely rubbish ambience. Never visit this place with kids as they are subject to compulsory passive smoking.

We had ordered Lamb Sizzler. The food was half cooked and the staff was adamant enough to argue that it was the way Lamb is cooked and we do not have experience of having it ! ! ! ¬†Although we were served (with some delay) chicken sizzler as an alternative.

Indian cuisine is at par with any good restaurant. Chinese was little better but still no way near the restaurants in 'China Town'.

The view of the city is majestic though.

A very nice place for people who want to have a nice drink with a beautifully decked up rooftop open bar cum restaurant right above lindsay street hotel (new market area).
One can have a romantic date too over here as the scenic beauty is so mesmerising from above and to add on there is soft violin music played too here.

My verdict - For a change do visit this place instead of those boring bars in town

Pros :-¬†

Outdoor seating
good ambience
good stock of drinks
nice location
the kung pao chicken sizzler was good

Cons:-

Staffs are too lazy and most of the time they don't listen to customers and bear a different attitude of their own which customers don't like.

English rock music is good but it should be upto an extent. The bar is not only for foreigners only. Loud music causes disturbance. And when asked to lower the volume down a bit, they said they cant

And last but not the least, the soup was pathetic. Sorry for the language but this should be the word to describe it..

This is a roof top restaurant(9th floor). And the view is just awesome. On the left corner you can see the vidyasagar bridge, onyhe right hand, there are the victoria and princep ghat..  

The vast kolkata looks amaizing from the roof at night. 

The food is very fresh and very tasty. 
The service is also very good.

Its best to go when the weather is slightly cold.

The cost may be a big high but is one of a kind experience.  


very nice place to hang out with friends and family..

But when I called Blue and Beyond to avail this they said during durga puja this deal can't be availed. This is absolutely not acceptable. Why they mentioned in the groupon durga puja deal page?

If you are looking for booze, smoke and fingerfood, an open air sitting with magnificent view of the city or even for a romantic date, Blue & beyond is the place to be!
If you want ur meal here, i would suggest, stay away!
The draught beer pitcher is reasonable priced,so a big plus if you are in a group.
But for the food we had in a couple of visits, sadly could not impress us!
Lat me kai was nice, just that the chicken was not tender.
Chicken ala greque sizzler, again the chicken not cooked properly,some parts were raw, i found a bone in it..the garlic breads were missing.
Next the chicken kung pao sizzler was sliced chicken in a mix of noodles with a spicy sugary gravy, i didnot find any cashew nut in it. It was a after a long time i had such bad food. Absolute waste of money.

My rating is Just for its amazing ambience.

This is a roof-top (open-Air) Bar-cum-Restaurant. It is located on the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay (now renamed to The Lindsay!). Had been one of our favorite haunts for the last decade or so. But the food quality has dropped off lately (2-3 years) along with their prices shooting up. Starters (Chicken, fish) are priced around Rs 300-400 with drinks also priced around the same amount. However, with the renovation, the decor of the outside sitting area has become better, contributing further to the ambiance. Having a drink with your friends, 100 feet up in the air, under the Stars, with the whole (almost) Kolkata skyline in front of you....is a tremendous feeling that cannot be described in words, and probably that is why I would still visit the place in times to come.

Blue and beyond. As the name suggests, an ultraviolet blue coloured open rooftop restaurant, nested on the rooftop of the nine storeyed Hotel Lindsay, has both open and closed sitting area which provides a misty view of kolkata skyline. The closed restaurant has a glass window, which looms over maidan, victoria memorial, second  hoogly bridge and can make you fall in love with the city of joy once again :)
It has a cosmopolitan ambience because of its location and you get to interact wid a lot of foreigners who come to visit Kolkata and most of them are very friendly and ever smiling.
The place is a complete mood filter-mugs of beer, close friends, deep rooted, memorable evenings and bites of starters. 
????
Coming to the food, it serves excellent starters. I had the best fish fingers of kolkata in blue and beyond. And they were served with tartar sauce which added up da taste. The same for fish and chips. Apart from that we ordered crispy chili baby corn for starters. And to my surprise it was served in a curved papad plate which was also edible. Sizzlers on the main course were also good. And breezers were served with cheese namkeens. But price is a bit high but its worthy because of the enchanting ambience and long hours of gossips.
I would highly recommend this to my friends specially for a get together :)

I bet most of us have not seen the Calcutta skyline like you can from this restaurant. And no one believes me when I tell them. The span across the right to the Vidyasagar Setu is a green ocean! Looks majestic.¬†
Enough about the scenic beauty that this place blesses your eyes with. Blue and Beyond has the best drought beer served in town. Period.
There are lots of choices when it comes to seating. We chose the one on the far right. You only get THE view from there. :D. Though, the open area looked great as well. The food is reasonable and tasty. They don't try to go European or American. They keep to the basics. It is a welcoming change.¬†
One can have a dinner date here or can just come to let loose after a hard day!¬†
I must say, I had been here before the re-decor and then later after. The changes they have brought to the place is unimaginable.
Great work guys! Cheers! :)

The terrace decor and the quaint seating makes this place a great hangout with friends or near and dear ones. I had a Classic Martini while my companion ordered Blue Lagoon. The drinks were quite amazing. On the sides, we ordered Corn and Cheese Balls, Chicken Nuggets and pasta. The food was amazing. The service was prompt. The seating arrangements, great. I would recommend this place for sure. As for me, I am looking forward to visiting again.

Went to this place for the first time in the evening. Ambience, view of Kolkata etc. was sensational as expected. Service however was poor. They didn't have draught beer(which is what we went for). We ordered two kingfisher ultra beers.  One of them turned out to be completely flat. On complaining,  the waiter took the beer to the bar... Juggled and stirred it in a glass and brought it back saying 'look sir, there is gas in it, that means beer is not flat'.  The steward claimed he was an expert in 'flat beer' and was adamant that my beer wasn't t flat. In spite of all efforts they refused to change the beer.  
I then politely asked them to get me a different bottle and that I would pay for the flat beer if needed. 
Thankfully, I wasn't charged for the flat beer, but the service was disheartening.  Perhaps this is why one should stick to South calcutta when going out. 
Great place but sorry not returning here anytime soon.

Oh i can die for the 'Chicken Drums of Heaven' served here. This is one dish i think no other restaurant can prepare in Kolkata. I am a total fan of Blue and Beyond not only because of the food here but also the ambiance which is unique. If you sit on the roof you can view the entire city of joy while you drink and eat. Its even more beautiful in the evening when the entire city is full of lights. The restaurant has got a very English kind of a feel and is perfectly located in the New Market Area. I loved the continental dishes here and also the Italian pasta. SImply yummy!!!

A perfect rooftop resturaunt on the 9th floor of hotel lindsay near simpark mall, esplanade.
It is advised to take the seats near the railings and a mersmerising view is assured. The best time of the day to visit the place is ofcourse after the sun sets.
We had chicken-ala-greque sizzler and lamb chop sizzler and they were wortg every penny paid. The waiters were really very polite and the place is simple yet very well set up.
A recommended resturaunt for a wonderful date.
P.S. Advance booking will be an intelligent thing to do since the place isnt that big to accomodate the number of people that visit it after sunset.

A Perfect Place For a Romantic Date with your "Special One" !! A midst the Chaos and Cacophony in the New Market Area, It's once peaceful place where you can experience the beautiful wind touching your face, Gives a refreshing feeling..The Beautiful view from the rooftop, a plush green maidan with Victoria Memorial adding more beauty to it...The Vidyasagar Setu on one side and the Iconic Howrah Bridge on the other gives a perfect feeling of being a "Kolkattan"..The entrance to the resto-bar gives you a nostalgic feeling of being a part of the City of Joy .. Looking forward to spend my special one's b'day on 11th Sept at the restaurant ..I simply loved the ambiance, the food, the restaurant staffs. Teriyaki Chicken was just perfect and the Golden Fried Prawns were a delight to my taste buds..Keep up the good work..To wrap it in an one liner, "It took my breathe away" ..

There was a time, when I was so regular at BLUES AND BEYOND, that almost all the staffs and chefs knew me. I had unbound access to the kitchen where I used to discuss with the chefs on the recipes of the foods which I liked. Times have changed and most of the old staffs have left. BUT, the charm of this place remains to be equally mind blowing. Nestled on the rooftop of the nine storeyed Hotel Lindsay, it offers a brilliant view of Kolkata if the weather is in your favour. The closed restaurant has a big glass window which looms over Maidan, Victoria Memorial, Second Hoogly Bridge, etc and makes one fall in love with Kolkata once again. It has a cosmopolitan ambiance because of its location and you get a chance to interact with a lot of foreigners who have come to visit Kolkata and most of them are very easy to get along in a conversation. 

Coming to the food, this place serves the best Fish Finger I ever had. The same goes for Fish and Chips. They serve several types of Sizzlers and most of them are really good !!! In fact, none of the foods I tried till date hasn't really disappointed me. The price is on the higher side, but it worths considering the food quality and ambiance of the place. 

I would highly recommend¬† this place to everyone.....

Location----> Located in New Market just opposite to Simpark Mall, this restaurant is in the roof top of Hotel Lindsay at the 9th floor.

Ambiance--> This place is all about the ambiance. They have recently renovated the restaurant , however the ambiance was also good before. Now, as soon as you enter this place, one word would definitely slip from you mouth  and it is "WOW". The decor is just wonderful. This is a very romantic place and it is highly recommended that you must come with your special one here. The lunch/dinner under the Sky at 9th floor rooftop is fantastic. However, if you go there during monsoon they have arrangements also, you can definitely sit in the AC bar. You will definitely love the view and if you are a Kolkata lover like me, you will just enjoy it.

Things tried--> 1) Shirley Temple---> This thing is made with 7 up and lemon juice and you will definitely like it. 
                       2) Tomato basil soup---> This is wonderfully made and garnished. I just loved it !! 
                       3) Dry Chillie Chicken---> This item is just perfect as a starter. 
                       4) Pan fried Chicken Noodles
                       5) Sweet and Sour Chicken---> I have been to many restaurants in Kolkata and tried sweet and sour chicken  from at least 10 restaurants but in blue and beyond they made this item the best!! 
                       6) Darsaan with ice cream---> Now I have been having darsaan ( in Bengali commonly known as "jibegoja") from my very childhood. But had no idea that the blend of darsaan with vanilla ice cream could be so wonderful ! 

This is absolutely a romantic place and I just loved Blued and Beyond!! A must try restaurant in Kolkata !

Usually the roof top eateries are uncomfortable in Kolkata as most of them are in the 3rd or 4th floor of a building. But blue and beyond, being on the 9th floor of Lindsay hotel, is an exception. The ambience is awesome. The corridor through which one reaches the main eatery is a photo gallery which gives it a different look. 
Now coming to the food, it's not compatible with the ambience. We ordered the dewangi kebab platter which consisted of chicken, fish, mutton and prawn kebabs. It tasted ordinary. Then we had Lat me kai which tasted like crispy chicken. Being a brownie lover I would say, the sizzling brownie was good but nothing special. 
Having said that I would recommend this place as a great place to have a drink and admire the beauty of Kolkata.

in the breeze while it was drizzling we sat outside in the open rooftop with a big bear mug and a plateful of steaming kebabs - an intimate group of 4 & that was the best we could have that weary day. i have had some of my private hours in Blue & Beyond but have not been there many times. in a winter night we sat inside the dimly lit cozy rooms enjoying the romantic vista of Esplanade and adjoining areas. i have not tried much yet & so far have only tasted some of the crispy starters among which i liked konjee lamp & drums of heaven over beer and some coriander soups. they got to offer so many varieties in appetizers, but i would like to try their sizzlers & mocktails next time. the sitting arrangements were uber cool, though for a girl of so short a height it seemed difficult to reach the table high up. lol joke apart it's a warm cozy place ideal for chilling out at night.

A breezy drizzly evening , a ‚Äúoh-so-romantic‚Äù rooftop ,in some lovable company and yummy food‚Ä¶. what else do you want to make your birthday dinner all that you planned for ! That is quite my BLUE & BEYOND experience . I must mention here that this place in Lindsay hotel (new market ) have undergone renovation of late and those who have gone there before must plan a visit sometime soon just for the sake of the wonderfully done interiors . Digging on that LONDON HOUSE SIZZLER with a fizzy cool drink in your hand and looking at your city pacing by is sure a moment to cherish. The GRILLED LAMB CHOPS are to die for and you must not miss the APPLE TART ! The staffs are nice and prices are quite moderate .Take a moment out of that mall ,gorge and most of all do not forget to soak in the view around . All I can say my blue and beyond night was anything but blue ‚Ä¶!! ÔÅä

I was initially quite skeptical about visiting one of the hotels around new market as I have read far too many articles about them being shockingly shady. but i love eating in open spaces and the pictures on Zomato were too much of a temptation. On entering Hotel Lindsay, I instantly knew this was the right place to be.
 The old elevator, operated by a smiling old man, took us to the top floor. There was a long and beautifully done corridor, adorned by pictures which reek of Kolkata, which led to the final flight of stairs. On entering the actual restaurant I instantly felt oh-so-happy. It was completely empty, being a lazy weekday afternoon. But the staff was energetic, knowledgeable and helpful. Also, the view is amazing.
We ordered blue and beyond salad, a mixed sizzler and apple pie. And I thoroughly loved each one of them. The dessert was exceptional indeed and I am longing to back soon. I loved every bit of this place!

Blue & Beyond is a rooftop restaurant in Hotel Lindsay. It is situated at New Market and is one of the oldest heritage hotels of Calcutta. This restaurant has an open area along with the enclosed section. It is well known for its awesome scenic beauty along with enjoyable food/drinks. We went there yesterday afternoon to enjoy a quick lunch. Ambiance was really awesome and sitting arrangements were comfortable. We started with ‚ÄòShirley Temple‚Äô & ‚ÄòBlue Lagoon‚Äô mocktails, both chilled & smoothing specially Shirley Temple. We finally decided our appetizer, starter, main course & dessert, staffs seems quite helpful. We had ‚ÄòChicken Lemon Coriander‚Äô as appetizer, which was perfectly warm for our mouth, nice taste but I was expecting more fillings. Next we had ‚ÄòChicken Reshmi Kebab‚Äô as starter, when served it was looking awesome but tasted very ordinary. For main course we had ‚ÄòButter Naan‚Äô, ‚ÄòDal Makhani‚Äô, ‚ÄòKadhai Chicken‚Äô & ‚ÄòVeg Pulao‚Äô. Butter naan and dal makhani was perfect, butter naan was soft and crispy and dal makhani also well cooked. Kadhai Chicken tasted average but chicken pieces they used were fresh and soft. Veg Pulao also nothing extraordinary. Dessert we opted for ‚ÄòDarsaan with Ice Cream‚Äô and we have no complain about it, perfectly made and really yummy. I think this is a great place for friends to have some drinks and order some things to share.

Went to this place last year.. went again with my friends a few days back! what a drastic change!!
One of the most refreshing places in kolkata. Truly a breather from the cliche restaurants in park street.
Firstly the ambience, Its mind blowing. the view and the colour effect.  The victoria memorial and the ganges present a breathtaking view from the restaurant.
i would love them to open more restaurants like these. Kolkata needs to get alive! and this is definitely helping..
We ordered  crispy chilly babycorn- it was pretty good... u shuld definitely try it.
The burmese khowsue, which is a new cuisine served in town and prepared very well here. Even the sizzlers are good.
Try their sangria and trademark drink- the blue and beyond-SO REFRESHING!!
Well, all i can say is i have found a new hangout place, definitely gonna come again.. CHEERS!!

I absolutely love the ambiance of this place. A little on the overpriced side, food quality is okay. Continental fare is better than the Chinese fare but the kebabs were decent too.
They have recently renovated the place and unlike before have converted the whole place into an open rooftop seating area which I love. I am totally partial to the expansive view of Kolkata it offers accompanying the beer. 
I recommend this place if you love open spaces and do not mind mingling with dear old Kolkata from a different angle.

Visited this place on poila baisakh. Its located on the top floor of hotel lindsay, in the bustling new market area. We visited it in the evening. The ambience was serene and romantic. On Tuesdays they have candlelight, and we were lucky to visit it on Tuesday. There was live music in the form of a guy playing violin and it added to the atmosphere. We ordered blue lagoon and absolut vodka, the prices were reasonable. For food we ordered roasted duck in butter and garlic sauce, the duck was a bit too well done and the butter was a bit too much. Then we ordered chicken khouse which was a new thing I tried and it was quite spectacular. Overall its a nice place to go on a romantic date.

First of all let me say that the place is intoxicating.. an amazing view.. and you actually feel one with the elements.
For starters we had Mushroom Kali Mirch and I realized that it was the best Mushroom dish I had ever had... the flavour was unforgettable. So we tried the Lebanese Mezze platter and the Crispy Chilly Baby Corn and both were very good. I went for the Tomato Basil soup after that which just had the right blend of flavours. My friend was also happy with the Minestrone soup he had. We finished off with the Burmese Khow Suey which was I was forced to give full marks to. 
However, the staff ought to be more familiar with the menu.

We decided to come back as the fantastic ambience left us wanting to repeat the experience.. and believe me it is not just the view.. it is something about the place.

After Blue and Beyond started its renovation, I was pretty disheartened to think that the place where I would go and have a cold coffee and some munchies in peace will change. But K was hopeful, so we ended up there around 7 o'clock one summer night to check out the differences made. 

The good news: Once we entered, we looked around and realized that the decor had been done pretty nicely. The servers seated us on a table for four in the open air zone and we were left alone with a pair of menus. We picked up the menus, and we realized that the prices have doubled, if not more. 

As we were two women sitting there, the servers were quite reluctant to serve us - coming to tables around us, and especially being very polite to the foreigners sitting besides us, but not us. We wanted to order more food, but seeing the attitude, refrained.  At this point, a man started to play flute - and let me say, it was BEAUTIFUL and the sole reason why I will give the place a 3/5. 

The cold coffees came now. I was shocked. Previously, they used to make one of the best cold coffees, with ice cream and chocolate sauce. This time, a pair of glasses were placed in front of us, and a watery concoction was given to us, and was called coffee. We stared at it, and then drank it and nearly wanted to cry. Tasteless and WARM, this cold coffee was just plain BAD.

Our bill was around 155/- for the two glasses of cold coffee (plus tax). The waiter took about 15 minutes to get us the bill and I am sorry to say, despite the decor, will be very reluctant to come back here.

This is a quick take of Blue and Beyond where I went the other day after renovation work began on it. Well, actually, my friend and I wanted to know what they were doing to the place, and we were both shocked to see that they have completely changed the way the hotel was/is. First, there is a doorman in the lift, which previously was not the case. Then, the interiors have been changed of the hotel, and the restaurant is now moved to the 10th floor. We went up and realized that the space on the 9th floor that was there before is being renovated, and the open air part has been shifted to the roof over it, so if you look down, you CAN see the renovation work going on. Anyway, my friend and I went and sat down on the top floor for a drink and a chat. The servers apologized for the changes, and I saw that the seating arrangement has definitely changed - the wrought iron chairs have been replaced with cheap-looking sofas. Our drinks came in a short time, and we were okay with that, but the fact that the space was less than half did not sit well with us.

----- 21 Dec, 2013 -----
I really cannot believe I have not reviewed BnB yet! It is one of Kolkata's best kept secrets (or at least, used to be!) and I have spent countless hours here. My last visit was with a few very close friends who are all aware of this place and we all went for a drink and something to eat in the afternoon. They have remodeled this place recently, and while I am not much of a fan of the decor, I do like coming here to familiar faces.  Our server just smiled at us when he seated us, and we got beer quickly, along with Lat Mai Kai for starters. The beer was chilled, and the grub was hot, a great combination, and we spent the next couple of hours sitting there, drinking and eating, our mood extremely relaxed. 

Then we ordered our main course - As I was not too hungry, got the fish finger. The fish finger was very crisp, nicely fried, and extremely tasty.My friend got himself some pasta in a cheesy sauce, and he loved it. Our bill, after the beers and food, came to around 2K, which was perfectly fine.

It is one of the very few places in Kolkata to have a roof top seating arrangement! T'was pretty disappointing to check out the new seating area because of some renovation. We had been there on a blazing summer afternoon once and the AC bar inside was heavenly. Offered an awesome view of the city and its essentials while sipping on Bailey's Irish Cream :)

People go there pretty much for the experience than the food. Allows one to spend a lazy afternoon or quiet evening even though you are bang in middle of one of the busiest shopping areas. Never went for food so far but nice place to hangout!

Located in the top floor of Hotel Lindsay opposite the main entrance of New Market Blue and Beyond stands out mostly because of the ambience.It offers an outdoor seating facility as well as an indoor air conditioned section.The outdoor open air roof top section overlooking the busy city is an excellent place to spend some quality time.This is one of the oldest open air restaurants in the city and still it is a place which is difficult not to like.The air conditioned section is very spacious.There is a wonderful laid back casual feel about the whole place.It is absolutely perfect for a long chat over some drinks!

Coming to the food,the quality is not the best.Long back when I was a kid I used to visit this place with my parents for dinner attracted more by the ambience.Back then the quality was quite good but it has deteriorated subsequently.Of late I have visited this place mainly for drinks and I have had mostly snacks like fish finger,fish fry,crispy chicken,drums of heaven etc.They are just about decent and a bit inconsistent too.One may consider this to be more of a pub than a restaurant.

The service is a bit slow.They tend to give more attention to the foreigners.The maintenance needs some improvement.The outdoor section though a wonderful place is not cleaned properly and regularly.The prices are a bit on the higher side.

In short Blue and Beyond offers an ambience you are sure to love.This is a perfect place to spend some quality time over drinks or may be with someone you want to impress..
Enjoy...Cheers!! :)

The first time when I went to Blue and Beyond around 3 years back on a friend's recommendation, I was totally impressed. Anyway I have a fascination towards open roof top places and this was the best that Calcutta had to offer at that point in time. It was not that famous back then and was the perfect place to take any person that you want to impress ;) 

Location and Ambiance : Located on the 8th Floor of Lindsay Hotel (near New Market on Lindsay Street), Blue and Beyond is a bar cum restaurant which offers open air as well as air conditioned seating options. You have to take the elevator till the 7 th floor and then take a flight of stairs to reach the restaurant. I have been there 3-4 times and have always opted for a table outside. The view is really nice overlooking the busy Central business district of Kolkata along with the Church bells ringing every hour truly does magic to the ambiance. The tables and chairs are basic.  They should regularly clean this place as I have found a layer of dust on the tables most of the time ! 

Food and drinks: I have been there with my friends, colleagues and also few friends who came down from Mumbai. All of them readily liked the restaurant for the setting and ambiance but the food taste and quality was inconsistent and varied on each of my visit. Initially I used to love the Chicken Lat Me Kai but on subsequent visits the taste deteriorated. They make pretty good pasta (spaghetti) with arabiatta sauce. Tried Fish and Chips once but it is was very average. You may try the crispy chilli babycorn as it is usually well made by these guys. 
They make nice Mojitos but beer availability is an issue. They usually stock Kingfisher and you might not get your choice of brand out here. Otherwise the bar is well stocked with premium spirits and is priced decently. Smoking is allowed so a plus for smokers.

Service: Service is just okay, nothing to write home about. They usually give a lot of attention to the foreigners and you might have to wait for quite some time to get your order during peak hours. 

Conclusion: This is definitely one of the must go places in Kolkata, but I stopped visiting as the prices started to increase and the food and service deteriorated. On a recent visit I found out that the restaurant is under going renovation so they are operating only a part of the restaurant. Just had a beer and left and noticed that now the prices are decent. Will visit soon :) 
Food and drinks for two should cost around Rs1400. A 3.5 for Blue and Beyond, I wish I could have rated them better.

I am divided on revewing Blue and Beyond with a wholesome 4 and have gone with the statistical average.

Ambience - 4.5
Food - 3.5

Locating Blue and Beyond is a piece of cake. Situated right opposite the main gate of New Market, the Lindsay Hotel may skip one's observation at the first go if not acquainted with the location. But just specifically looking for it makes sure one cannot blink and miss it. My visit to the Lindsay hotel has specifically been for Blue and Beyond. The rooftop restaurant has both open and closed seating area, and is done up extremely classily. I am a sucker for the open seating which provides a beautiful, misty view of Kolkata's skyline on a winter evening. You possibly cannot not like the ambience here. Mostly visisted by young and the middle aged, it is flocked by huge groups of foreigners almost all the time. The way the tables are set, allowing one to peep at the football and cricket matches on the television, enjoying long conversations over beer adds a whole new level of casual classiness, which is absent in the eiither extremely informal bars or expensive lounges. This place is a complete mood lifter - mugs of beer, close friends, deep rooted, light hearted conversations, a bite of the starters from time time ensures lovely, memorable evenings. 

As much as I love the ambience, my food experience here has not been beyond good enough. Over different visits I have tried the chilli baby corn, fish and chips and the grilled lamb chops. The chili baby corn is nice, perfect to go with chiiled beer. The fish and chips are okay, nothing great, and the lamb chops average, very average. The point is a teetotaller may or may not enjoy the food here (excluding the ambience). And according to me, a restaurant with an elaborate menu, not claiming to be a pub, failing to impress in the food category, is definitely a disappointment.

Update on Ambience -
On my recent visit to BnB, I was mightily impressed with the revamped look. It looks classy and suave, but a little congested. They could have left some space between the different tables. It almost looks as if people are cramped up together. But nonetheless, I love the use of the white cane chairs, the flowing waterfall and the live music. We ordered for a whiskey sour and a beer pitcher to cool down the heat wave in Kolkata. The whiskey sour was lovely. It had enough alcohol in it to be potent, yet tasted comfortably like a good cocktail. I sure was taken aback and in love with the drink. The draught beer was served absolutely chilled, so a heartening experience at that too. 
The only aspect which I did not like is the crowd. Of course BnB can't exactly do something about it but I wish there was a method to scan the crowd who can have an access to the rooftop lounge. I sure don't like weird, drunk people clicking thousands of selfies and clicking their fingers to call waiters.

When the hints of winter come into the air then Blue and Beyond is one of the first places that I put on my eating out list. Honestly its lovely especially if you can grab a table outside with a view that encompasses New Market , Shahid Minar , Howrah Bridge and Vidyasagar Setu . This is a place to visit with close friends or a loved one  ..... where the conversation flows along with the drinks and the food. The best part about the menu is that there are options for both the veg and non-veg category. My personal favourites are Lat Me Kai , American Corn Pepper Salt , Conjee Krispy Lamb and Irani Machhli all of which are pretty good. The Pasta's are not bad but not the best I have had. If your not much of a drinker try the Cinderella Mocktail .... quite tangy and refreshing or in the cooler months the Hot n Sour Soup is a decent bet.

Please note: This review is about a year old and quite long before they renovated the place.

 The only thing good about Blue and Beyond is the marvelous view. With the cool breeze and the gorgeous Kolkata skyline you can enjoy their open air roof-top for hours. They stock very limited beer brands. The chicken that they served was rubbery. Avoid if you are looking forward to a hearty filling meal. Service is best described as average. I have been there once and would choose not to visit it anytime soon.

The major attraction is ' the Kolkata skyline' one gets to see from the rooftop of the hotel. Food is okay sorts with nothing remarkable. In case you happen to drop in on a day when renovation is at its peak (just as we did), don't get disheartened for if you get the couples' table near the windows, your eyes can go for a partial soothing. Place is quite large with a simple yet elegant decor. For all those souls who love to gaze out of the window rather than the platter in front - must give this place a try !!

Went to the place after reading all the reviews... It was a reunion and we were group of 5... First the place... Roof top where the view is gud and as the sun goes down the lights get dim.. Second the starters were ok.. Since all of us were veg the food was edible enough except the hara bhara kabab which was dry... Service was quick and good (may be we were in group)... Had lots of drinks and even the waiters were laughing at us..

Very unsual thing about the place is: They place good music which was little surprising.. Being in a location where u dont expect decent english music but they were playing some good numbers... 

They have three kinds of sitting arrangements: 1) For the family - Sofas and chairs (Restaurant) 2) Roof open place where there are chairs with smoking facility 3) Couple place where you sit with your date (Its a closed place on the roof.. High tables with chairs)

Overall a budget place in case u have to throw a party for friends (for 5 with drinks costed me 9K)

I occasionally drop by to feed my eyes with the magnificent view as the food and service  of this establishment is quite average !!! I have only eaten the starters here .... service is not too quick and the food is sometimes decent and sometimes quite poor in flavour .... starters that I have sampled from time to time and are usually decent are Lat Mai Kai , American Corn Pepper Salt  and the Conjee Krispy Lamb. The best time to go is winter when one can sit out and enjoy the bite in the air. The ambience inside is just so-so hence I avoid going on a very hot or rainy evening !

Blue and Beyond gets a 3.5 for me. 

The 3 points are for the ambiance. It is a rooftop restaurant and commands a spectacular view of the Kolkata skyline. You can see the Shahid Minar at one end the Second Hooghly Bridge, the Howrah Bridge and New Market sprawled just below you. It is fabulous place to hang out with friends or go for a date after sunset. I recommend going there after sunset not only for the way Kolkata looks from up there lit up in all her finery but also because the place opens at 12 Noon. Also avoid the really hot and humid summer days and obviously the monsoon season.
 
The food and the service together earns 0.5 from me. The starters are alright and the main course is simply inedible. Last time I went there we had ordered Crispy Chilly BabyCorn as Starters and Pasta with Chicken in Tomato Basil Sauce for the main course. The BabyCorn was just okay. The ingredients used for the Pasta was far from fresh and it was actually stinking. 

The service is also very sloppy. I have a suspicion that the waiters sample each drink before they serve it. They not only mix up orders and forget to serve you but also keep on breaking glasses at an alarming rate.

Their cocktails are however not bad. But be careful while ordering a cocktail. Specifically ask the brand name of the alcohol that they are going to put into the drink. Despite what is written in the menu card when the bill comes you might be surprised to see that you have been charged Rs 650 for a Screwdriver. The explanation being they had used Absolut.(Happened to yours truly.)

Although the service and the food is frankly terrible , I would still recommend this place. My suggestion would be to go there during autumn or winter evenings, order a drink(which is expensive, I agree) and a starter if you feel like it and enjoy Kolkata.

I found 6 drinkers shouting and laughing at each others poor jokes,they looked rich so the staff were also not discouraging them to bag some bucks..I ordered lamb chops which were a bit saucy than expected..the kebeb platter was,I would say thikthak but the quantity was not enough..and lastly they have served our warm brownie with ice cream on a sizzler tray and two metal spoons over it,which were as hot as the tray..my partner almost made a mess of her lips by the warm spoon..even after when we ask for plates they have taken so much of time that our icecream dollop was totally melted by then,after getting the those most awaited plates,I was shocked to see the waiter just shown us his back by putting those plates on our table..he made us transfer the brownies in the plates by our own..I have been to many places,some of them good some of them not,but I can hardly remember a place where I have received this kind of Service..the view was great but the other aspects were pathetic..expensive too...

What sets apart this place from most restaurants is the view that it offers from the roof top of a high rise hotel. There are of course a few other food top restaurants but this one is strategically located right in New market. My personal recommendation would be to visit it post evening for a glamorous view of the city and the cooling breeze. The food is not very unique or special but an evening with friends on a roof top which towers over most other buildings in vicinity is quite an experience and unlike the other roof top restaurants the prices here are moderate.

On top of Hotel Lindsay, just opposite Hogg Market (New Market), Blue & Beyond is one of Kolkata's oldest rooftop restaurants. For a long time, it was the ONLY proper rooftop fine-dining restaurant in the city. The view that this place offers is wonderful - an expanse of Central Kolkata, the Maidan, Victoria Memorial in the distance - truly beautiful. And that is why it has its own dedicated rush.

This is a place to frequent when one needs to 'slow' life down, just take a chill pill. Its great for a romantic date or even to introspect alone, looking at the view with a sip of a Martini. The drinks are moderately expensive.

Obviously the prices will be a bit high, since its a 3 star hotel. The bar area is nice. Feels great to have food inside the glass enclosure beside the terrace on a rainy day while gazing at the city.
Personal ratings:
Food:3.5/5
Ambiance:4/5
Service:2/5
Value for money:2.5/5

"very  very overpriced   unless you  are  a  firangi  (  white   male/  female )  ..........  don't  even  think  of  going  there........   vat  69  which  costs 180 / ¬†large peg ¬†elsewhere costs  here 395 / 60  ml  peg  ..........  very very  overpriced  i  tell  you  ........  service is  also  sloppy  .....  remember  you were warned  ..........  don't  tell me  later  that  i  didn't  tell you  .....  better go   someplace  better. ¬†"

That was 3 years back . forgot about this place till one colleague suggested let's go there ..... so edited my review¬†

Went there ¬†around 3 years back . Now however it's even more pricey .... when one friend suggested let's go to ¬†" blue & beyond ' ...... I immediately remembered my last experience here , 3 years back ....... so thought of checking the menu on ¬†zomato ........ as expected ... even more pricey .... even teacher's 50 which has become very basic among today's youth ........ will set you back by Almost rs 600 / large peg .............. I mean ¬†that's ...more expensive than even Irish house ...... Atleast Irish house has better offers during Happy hours ........ but ... then again ....... i have given up ¬†3 years back ........ so no point changing my opinion now ... atleast ¬†today's youth have the advantage ¬† of menu ¬†on zomato ......... when i went ¬†3 years back ..... zomato was still a startup to most ... & even though this place was listed ...... drinks menu was not uploaded if i can remember correctly ....... so i went with an open mind ....... came back ¬†much wiser ......... after coughing up 4 grands .... for 3 people .... ¬†with limited alcohol & negligible finger food ........ But then as ¬†I say ....... if you can afford to spend 10k ¬†for an evening ........ no place better than blue & beyond .
