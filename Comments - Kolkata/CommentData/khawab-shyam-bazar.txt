Although only one salan and one raita was given where 2 biriyani was odered, but biriyani was so perfect that i have give that rating.
Spiciness, aroma, oiliness was very good to give a heavenly taste.
Rice was also very good in quality, cooked upto the mark.
One of the best biriyani available in kolkata, must try.
Thank u for such good food on 31st.

It was my khawab to visit khawab since college days n been there for two time. This place is very easy to locate, walking distance from Raj ballav para, Baghbazar. Though the place is small but the decor is very attractive. If you tired of typical type of Biriyani then you should visit this place. Here the biriyani is served in handi along with salan n raita.the aroma reminds u of Hyderabai dum biriyani!!! All I can say it's very tempting!! Apart from that kebabs n tandoor are also very tasty. Staffs are also well behaved. Overall a nice experience.

This place is located diagonal to the house of Girish Ghose. Usually not crowded and can find a quick seating. The place is small and holds around 25-30 ppl. 
We ordered a Hyderabadi style biryani and chicken malai kebab. Loved their spicy biryani. The biryani is offered with an aloo and a egg. Portion was filling and offers good value for money. Their malai kebab was good. Size wasn't satisfactory but soft enough.

At the onset lemme say that if you are looking for a different style of biryani (like u get in hyderabad) this can be your destination. Had mutton biryani half n chicken chaap. Biryani was good but lil spicey. Chaap wasnt good though quantity was good. Staff was very polite wch is quite rare nowdaz.
Overall decent but not great.

If you are tired of the Kolkata Style Biriyani and you want to try a different type of Biryani, this is where your search stops. The biriyani is served with complimentary salan and raita and the taste is unlike the Kolkata style biriyani. It has a spicy and aromatic flavour which is the Hyderabadi style dum biriyani. Along with biriyani the restaurant also serves wide range of kebabs and tandooris. In the deserts section, if you don’t get firni, never settle for shahi tukda because its just not worth it. The quantity which is offered to you is awesome at the price mentioned. A good place to try Biriyani Hyderabadi Style.

Went there today for lunch ... though we reached there at 4:45 pm so we had to wait for about 15mins to get a table for two ... but after placing the order they were really quick in serving the food which was medium hot ... almost nothing other than biriyani was available obviously because today is nabami so they must have ran out of most of the food items ... but other than that their service was good food was okay ... i would love to visit this place again on weekdays / after puja so that i can get the best out of this place ...

Khawab has surprisingly good biriyani . The special biriyani is fabulous and even the veg biriyani is edible. Kebabs are also the speciality though I wouldn't try the chello kebab out of loyalty to Peter cat. Biriyani is served with raita and salan and one is good enough for 2 ppl.

Nice interiors.

But the quality and quantity of food isn't good.Tried their biriyani - the biriyani did not have a proper piece of potato which leaves a plate of biriyani incomplete.The quality of rice wasn't good as well.The chicken piece was decent though.

Read about this place in various reviews on zomato and so I and my friends thought of giving this place a try as I never had awadhi biriyani before.
LOCATION- This place isn't very much hard to find. It is located at a merely walking distance of 1-2 mins from Raj ballabh para. 

AMBIENCE AND DECOR- Unfortunately I couldn't get to click pictures of their interiors but trust me this place is great. It is a small cozy restaurant with limited but awesome seating. Nice and rich ambience and decor I must say. I was really impressed. The restaurant opens at 12pm and closes at 3pm and again starts functioning at 5pm.

STAFF- The staff there were truly great and humble. They welcomed us inside the restaurant gave us proper seating,helped us with almost everything from laying the menu card on the table gently to serving desserts. This place is surely great. 

FOOD- Now coming to the most important part the food of the restaurant. This restaurant serves hyderabadi delicacies FYI.
For starters we ordered "MUTTON SHAMMI KEBAB". It is priced at ₹140 for 4 pieces. I personally felt that it was a tad overpriced because the size of the kebabs were quite small. But it was delicious. That's the USP of this dish. ❤
For the main course we ordered TWO MURG (HALF), ONE MURG BIRIYANI (FULL) AND ONE GOSHT BIRIYANI (HALF).
The HALF MURG BIRIYANIS costs ₹140 each ,the FULL MURG BIRIYANI costs ₹200 and the HALF GOSHT BIRIYANI cost ₹170 respectively.
The quantity of the half biriyanis were very good. They give more than sufficient amount of biriyani required for one person. It had two pieces of MURG/GOSHT, One EGG and One ALOO served with SALAN AND RAITA. The quantity of the full biriyani was also very good. Its sufficient for one person but two people can also have it if they are not much of a biriyani lover. It had two big pieces of CHICKEN, one EGG and one ALOO.
The taste of the biriyanis were exquisite and truly wonderful. ❤ As I never had a SALAN before I was sceptical about how it will be. It was good actually. And the RAITA was oh-so-delicious. ❤
At the end our main course they also provided us finger bowls with warm water in it. Trust me anybody will love that gesture.
For dessert we had firni. I always thought the firnis are to be served always in the frozen form and I was also habituated with eating the firni in the frozen form scraping every last bit of it from the clay pot untill that day my friend told me that this is the pure form of firni and it should never be frozen. The firni was really good with garnish of nuts and pistachios on top. 
I was afraid that the restaurant will close and the whole day would be wasted. But fortunately it was opened and they were running 45 minutes late which is wayyy after their closing time. Sorry for that. ❤
They escorted us to the gate,greeted individually goodbye. Seriously who wouldn't appreciate such courtesy.
To conclude I had a great lunch there and hope to visit this place again anytime soon.

Kabab nd fish finger was really good, fish finger was very crispy nd juicey, but the biriyani was really disaster,if u r a moghlai biriyani lover then plz don't try it there.
Mutton shammi kabab - 3. 5
Fish finger-4
Murg biriyani -2 ( with out smell, with out flavor)
Not for "kolkata biriyani" lover.

After a long adda near Mayer ghat in baghbazar, this was the place I hopped in with my friends after researching a lot on zomato. 
We ordered chicken malai kebab and a small handi biriyani. 
This handi biriyani came with a surprise... There were so many of the mutton pieces...eggs and potato... I loved the ambience as well as the food.. The biriyani is served with salan and raita which was pretty new for Me..And three of us, being not a heavy eater... We were filled by only one small handi... The total bill for 3 was perhaps 538.

Only 4seaters are available. No 6 or 8seater.
The ghost handi special is ok for 3 people not 4.
Half plate chicken biryani is ok for 1people.
Quantity is less. You won't get full after having biryani.
The mutton were a bit dry.
The side raita and chutney was good.
Butter nan was good.
Murg methi malai was also good. Soft tender chicken of 4 pieces.
Overall a good quiet place.
Price for food is moderately ok. 
Pocket pinch ₹1800 for 7 people.

Went for a dinner with family. The weather was bad as it was raining too heavily. Firstly they can't accomodate 6 seater so we had to sit 3 in a table which was very uneasy. Secondly the Biryani was too spicy and was overcooked. Had to wait long for the food to be served. And nothing seemed extraordinary.  Sorry but the experience wasn't more than average. Only the decor was a little bit of feel good beside  everything.

As for the food we had malai kabab and ghost biriyani. Both were really delicious and the quanitity was also good. Specially the biriyani was really full of flavour and there were many pieces of mutton.For the price range it is a highly recomended restaurant in north calcutta.

It's a restaurant which specialises in hyderabadi biryanis. The place ia pretty decent and the staff is courteous. We ordered a chicken biryani and firni. The biryani tasted unlike other biryanis I have tasted. So much so we din't leave a grain of rice xD. Also the biryanis are served with raita and salan. The firni was okay-ish. Overall experience was good. Would go again to try out the rest of the dishes.

Very disappointed with the quality and quantity of the food. Reviewing an earlier experience during Durga Puja when we had to wait for 2 hours to get a table, but only to be served Biriyani, as nothing else was there in the option. Now waiting during Durga Puja was natural, but which was not expected was the poor taste of food and lack of option. Should improve in all sense.

A quite and isolated place near Raajballabh Para, Khawab never got any attention, due to its non-charming attitude to lure people. No promotions, no advertisements, no glitterati at all. And there came a day, when a friend of mine took me here, almost without my intention.
As we both loved kababs that goes easy with us we had Assorted Chicken Kabab Platter and Mutton Shikampoori along with Fish Afghani Tikka. Believe me people, I was surprised by their quality. The fish was tender and smoky, beautifully cooked and Shikampoori was so great that even a Lucknowi would die for it. The minced mutton kabab is sparingly found in Kolkata, but I will recommend this place for kababs, specially the mutton kababs. Their Handi Gosht biryani is a bit awadhi and a bit of hyderabadi in style and taste, but it is alright for those who are calorie concious. Loved the simply lit place and loved their food. Dig in guys.....

For the hyderabadi cuisine, Khwab is a well-known joint. They’ve got their outlets in Deshapriya Park, Girish Park and Unnayan, Ajay Nagar and their base kitchen in Kasba, Ruby. The specialty of this place is they serve hyderabadi cuisine dedicatedly and know their business damn well. I tasted their mutton handi biryani family pack with salan gravy and raita. At 350/- a package, they give rice (enough for 2 heavy eaters), 6 medium pieces of meat and 2 eggs. Extremely VFM.

Decor is old mughal lined with a mix of modern ecletic located near rajballav para, towards bagbazar.
Known for their biriyanis, however tried aloo paratha, naan, malai kabab and chicken tikka masala. Desert was double ka mitha which is just a fancy name for sahi tukda and firni.
Paratha and nan was good standard. Malai kabab was a lil dry with hardly any malai and lacking quintential sweetness. Tikka masala had 4pieces only served in handi, okish taste.
Firni was the least favourable. Overall a forgettable experience

It cost Rs 140/- for 4 pieces.
They were a little too burnt at the sides but it was delicious.
Not too good, but worth the money.

A Hyderabadi based restaurant! The interior had some typical Hyderabadi garnishising along with the giant fans hanging over. I Was out with my friends due to a minor kebab craving. As we were searching for some places in zomato which serves kebab in the noon time, this place got listed, but then it was an absolute blunder to visit the place.
We ordered a platter of assorted kebabs which were hard as rocks; and were undercooked as well! Then we went for ordering the mutton shammi kebab, which tasted more like a vegetable cutlet. In short both tasted horrible!

We went there on Nabami night. and trust me we had vomiting and lever problem.
I don't know what to rate it because less than 1 is NA here else I could have rate it the same.
We ordered for Chicken Biryani and Malai Kebab. So dirty place and surrounding of toilet smell. Waiter Mr.Ujjal did not know anything about the food quality.
However we took digene to digest it finally. Am staying just 1.5 Km away from this restaurant and for sure that we won't go there.

Utter mismanagement is what I faced today when I went to Khawab at Baghbazar. I called them up to know if home delivery was available during puja which they denied. But they assured that the special Thali will be available for take home during puja. When I personally went there at 1.10 pm it was still not ready to serve anything and they said they are not open yet though they publish they are open from 12 noon and no where mentioned the changes. I requested them to take the order for take away where they said Thali is not available for parcel. I informed my communication over phone. They then called up someone and said they will arrange. They took order for fish Thali and asked me to return after sometime. 
On my return after an hour they informed fish Thali will not be available. No reason given. I asked them to give chicken Thali. They provided the same after half an hour waiting. 
On return I found there were shortfall in the number of items to be parcelled and I was not in a position to return.
Moreover behaviour of the staff was not at all good. When asked something they were reluctant to reply. Heard from others that whatever was ordered mostly was not available.
To add to the surprise, there was no water available in the toilet. 
I am totally disappointed. Food is not bad. So cook is good.

I had no idea that this small joint at shyambazar could give me such delicious biryani. The Ghost (Mutton) biryani was awesome. The perfect blend of spices. Everything from the meat, moisture and flavours were awesome. They can easily challenge the likes of Alibaba and Aminia any day.

P.s. Just one thing, if u do come here order the Ghost (Mutton) biryani as their chicken biryani is not that good.

As we are the quintessential Bengali college students living in Calcutta, a friend and I had to visit Kumortuli on Mahalaya. Considering we both are massive foodies, and we always look for places wherever we go, Khawab seemed like the most viable option here. It was 30th, so we were both strapped for cash, so we had to make something out of what we had. We entered Khawab, it was completely empty. They switched the lights and fans on, and then we realised how beautiful the interiors are. The person who waited on us was a very polite soft spoken human, who answered all our questions without a cell of irritation. We unfortunately couldn't get his name. We ordered Mutton Rogan Josh and tandoori roti. The Mutton was brilliantly cooked, the gravy was heavenly, the pieces were large enough and soft enough, and the roti was good as well. Overall, I have got no complaints with this place. Not exceptional, but if you're hungry, go to this place. The food and the service will satisfy you for sure.

In bagbazar area this is THE BEST.no question asked. The hydrabadi biriyani that they serve here with onion and cashew fried and raita are just heaven. Also the kababs are their speciality.motton kosa with Alu I think this is the only place to give Alu which enrich the gravy. Seasonal haleem also a good dish. Most unique thing is they provide hari made of clay for biriyani for take away. Must visit.

Would rate them in negative, if possible. Walked in with a couple of blogger friends for our Ramadan Walk. They have got these huge fans on the ceiling, which is just for show and gives no air in actual. The AC doesn't work well either. The Aam Panaa Shorbot which we had ordered was served after decades. The Mixed Kebab Platter had hard kebabs. The Biryani was good in quantity, but was stale. We could literally feel the awkwardness while having this dish. And to our surprise, the waiters lied on our face stating that the Biryani was fresh.

In short, please avoid this place.

One of the best places in north calcutta for biryani lovers. the interiors have a very awadhi feel to it and it's dimly lit so that you can feel cozy while enjoying your food.
-------
I had mutton from here and believe me when I say this...I was bowled over by their biryani.
The taste was just perfect, not too spicy, not too oily and the meat was so tender and juicy that it fell off the bones. They served a achaar and a "chaanch" with coriander and mint with biryani. These two things were really amazing and elevated the taste of the biryani to just another level... Somewhere close to heaven i guess. 😊
-----
Do try this place, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. And be ready for some exciting celeb spotting weekends.✌
Cheers!🍻

We know our city is famous for the only type of Biryani in the whole World with potatoes in it. We know most of the people of this city are sentimental about that one piece of big juicy potato in their plate of Biryani. And we know they think Kolkata Biryani is the best in the World. We love Kolkata Biryani too. We love that piece of potato too. But we love the concept of Biryani also. And hence any type of Biryani, when well made, means happiness to us. We don’t compare and see every type as a whole new dish, and believe us, it is the most successful way to enjoy the World of Biryani.

Ambiance is like, you are in British era and having lunch in an Indian restaurant. Service is nice and cost is little high. Overall experience is more than good.    
One thing, I personally feel they are the specialist on Kabab. It was really awesome taste.

Went to their shyambazar branch today. Not very spacious but easily accommodate 18-20 people. There's a touch of nawabi culture everywhere in the decor accompanied by old photographs on the walls. Ordered murg biriyani full, mutton shammi kebab and mutton achari. Food quality is standard, nothing extraordinary. Liked shammi kebabs most. Staffs are very polite and well behaved. Overall good experience.

Dum ka Murgh is way better than any restaurant of Kolkata, be it Arsalan or Aminia. Tandoori Roti is so crispy and well cooked, probably the best in city. Personally, those who is a fan of Lucknowi Biryani can't easily like Hyderabadi in the same way. Would just recommend to include the Kolkata style Biryani in their menu. It would be an icing on the cake. Would visit again for sure.

I have not personally visited this place but at my office, Khawab has a stall in the cafeteria. They serve only few selected items as they have to bring it from their mother store. Previously I had tried their cello kebab once and mutton kasha and paratha the 2nd time. Today it was a no lunch box day for me so I tried their biriyani. A very spicy and typical hyderbadi style cooking, served with a boiled egg and finely cooked smooth chicken legpiece that almost got melted inside my mouth. The onion raita was also literally complementing the biriyani.
So if you are a biriyani lover and want to try the varieties of biriyani available around us, do try at this place.

This place claims to specialise in Hyderabadi cuisine. Went there yesterday to check their claims and were not much disappointed.
The ambience is quite regal,especially the chairs are a nice touch.
We started with a shammi kebab...it was okayish, lacked flavours.
Next was the gosht biryani special handi. Now,I've been to Hyderabad myself and had had the biryani there. This one was close,but a bit different. The biryani is heavy and spicy (usp of hyderabadi biryani in general) and the accompanying raita and salan acted as welcome palate cleansers. The quantity of this handi is huge and one handi more than suffices for three people ( with voracious appetites like ours). The mutton pieces within the biryani was flavourful but a bit on the chewy side.
The service was quite good, with the servers attending to all our needs diligently.
Pocket pinch :660 bucks (prices are inclusive of taxes).
Overall, a nice place to visit once in a while,when you want to taste something different.

I ve tried hundreds of big restaurants in my life,but never ve got this kind of guest welcome as this outlet has given me. 
Something was written on every tables "BE THANKFUL TO GOD THAT A GUEST HAS COME TO EAT HIS OWN FOOD ON YOUR DASTARKHWAN"....Its an Urdu couplet. I was astonished how I was grandly welcomed by the service staffs as their guest. Just AWESOME. 

* Location : Just a stone throw distance from GIRISH MANCHA BAGBAZAR or just opposite of famous গিরীশ ঘোষের বাড়ি in Bagbazar st, I ve come across on numerous occasions this outlet and lastly I entered. 

* Ambience : When you enter, the decor makes you spellbound and you feel as a royal Hyderabadi nawab. You can never imagine a very old and traditional Bagbazar st can have this kind of most beautiful Hyderabadi decorating restaurant. Its not a very big outlet,but very much neat and clean. Mostly I liked a beautiful মাটির হাঁড়ির smell in and around the restaurant. Ambience was amazing with astonishing decoration. Old style mirrors,statues,chairs...all are maintaining nawabi style. Even they were serving all foods in real copper dishes. I liked it so and so much. (rating 10 on 10)

* Food : I had ordered the best items here....
1. Fish tikka kebab : Perfectly made with pure bhetki, those kebab pieces were very smooth and lip smacking. Very good taste. (rating 10 on 10)
2. Chicken methi malai kebab : May b kebabs were made by well trained chef; otherwise so much beautiful kebabs couldn't be made. (rating 10 on 10)
3. Paneer butter masala : Big pieces paneer, very good taste. What I liked best that paneer item was not at all oily,but taste was awesome. (rating 9 on 10)
4. Mutton handi biriyani : Served in a clay handi, its hyderabadi style dum biriyani, taste is different than Lucknow style biriyani. Nearly 3 people can easily consume in 1 small handi, quantity was so huge and the mutton pieces were small, but there were many. (rating 10 on 10)
5. Butter nun : As usual.
6. Mutton nihari : Suggested by one of the service staffs (as I was searching for some light and less spicy mutton stew like item), I personally didn't like its taste. (rating 4 on 10)
7. Mutton shammi kebab : Another supar hit item, very good taste. If someone likes pure fried and dried kebab,go for it. (rating 9 on 10) 
8. Chello kebab : Pure dehradun rice ghee bhat with 2 kind of chicken kebabs, 3 kinds of mutton kebabs and an egg poach. Personally its my all time favourite item anywhere,I liked it very much. (rating 10 on 10)

* Service : As I mentioned above, the staffs think the guests as their God. So they welcomed us warmly and rather kingly. Very well mannered service and fast and swift. (rating 10 on 10).

* Price : Amazingly average....very much average,I was dumbstruck to see my bill as I took so and so many items. (rating 10 on 10)

* Bad luck factor : The location itself. The restaurant is located rather in an off bit place, so it gets full empty sometimes. Otherwise it would be very hit with all positive sides.

* Must recommended : 1. Fish tikka kebab, 2. Gohst handi biriyani, 3. chicken methi malai kebab, 4. Mutton shammi kebab.

Yesterday I visited the restaurant. The place is small but cosy. Interior decor is nice with good wall hanging and subtle lighting. As their tagline shows speciality in kebab and hyderbadi biriyani, we ordered chicken methi malai kebab, gosht biriyani and firni. The kebab was very nice- tender chicken pieces with perfectly blended spices. It tasted delicious with pudina chutney. Biriyani was served with raita and mirch ki salan. But I did not enjoy it. The mutton pieces were bit hard and not so tasty. Firni was perfectly palatable.
And the fact worth mentioning is that the staffs well mannered and very co-operative.

So it was one of those evenings when we just randomly thought of trying this place. We were greeted warmly and the place has got a majestic feel to it. The decor resembles the mughal era and it is so aristocratic. It is divided into two sections and we were the only hungry souls.
We ordered mutton shami kebab and chelo kebab. The mutton kebab was nice not exceptional. But the chelo kebab just blew us over. This is like the best bang for your buck kind of a deal. The quantity and variety of kebabs they provide will make you wonder if it is not really a dream. The aroma was enticing. Without much further ado we dug into them. Trust me they are heavenly. The 3 chicken and two mutton kebabs topped with a sunny side up were impeccable. One has to taste to believe the amount of perfection in them. The rice was kind of bland but that can be overlooked. No surplus tax too and one can gobble to one's heart's content without creating a hole in the pocket.

Had been there tonight with family. It is at Rajballavpara near Girish Ghosh's house. Ordered assorted chicken kabab and special gosht handi biriyani. Kabab was awesome, perfect apetizer. Biriyani was typical hyderabadi cuisine. Masala was just right, aroma was reminding the biriyani had at Hyderabad years back. Quantity was sufficient for 4. Mutton could have been softer. Kitchen is visible & appears to be hygienic. Must try for Hyderabadi biriyani lovers.

This is mainly a mughlai restaurant located near Manindra College, Shyambazar..

The interior of this restaurant gives u the family restaurant themed feeling and several dishes photo has been laminated at the entrance of the gate (from right side),you can click photos or selfies over there..

Now come to the food,I've ordered Murg Biryani which was spicy but didn't give your taste bud too much spice as it is normal chicken Biryani..I like the biryani as it was different from other restaurant.. Here u get egg in place of potato with raitas and gravy..

The staff are friendly and very cooperative and assist u in quite good and well-mannered..

Most of the people don't know about this restaurant but I'm sured after visiting this restaurant you"ll recommend to other as well and keep this restaurant in list after Arsalan,Shiraz,Haji Saheb and Aminia..

If you are a big fan of Mughlai and Awadhi cuisine-this is the place.The Mutton Biriyani served here is outstanding and sumptuous.The Kebabs will make you will feel like a Mughal Emperor or a Nawab because the quality,quantity,taste and the tenderness are that good.The spices are balanced and perfect.The other veg and non-veg dishes are just a feather to the cap.The surprise of this place is that they serve rolls too and trust me they are off-the-hook.The decor and ambience is perfect.The only turn-down of this place is it's low accomodation capacity.Otherwise this place should be a must visit to those who have tried Aminia or Shiraz.

This restaurant has an elegant theme. A perfect ambience to have dinner or lunch with family. The interior design is impressive. If you are looking for a place to celebrate birthday or a decent family dinner, this is the place to go. I must say, Khawab is the most underrated restaurant in Zomato. The food, the service, the ambience are so good. The prices are not that huge and you get satisfied with every bite you take. the elegant theme gives you a Nawabi feeling which you once read in History books. A small place but a very well maintained one. The washroom is hygienic and clean. The location is a good one. A 15 minutes walk from the Shyambazar metro station. Seat Reservation is mandatory during festivals like Durga Pujo or Christmas.  

Now let's talk about the real stuff. 

Murgh Biriyani (full plate) had two chicken peices and one egg. It tasted oh so delicious. We ordered chicken butter masala, but the good waiter recommended us chicken tikka masala because there would be 4 peices instead of 2 if we order the latter. I found the Chelo Kebab unsatisfactory. The Butter rice with omelette was represented well. However, the Mutton Kebabs looks small and weird. They didn’t even taste good. The chicken Kebabs tasted great. Try ordering the Mutton dishes (with bravy) because the spices they use blend very well.

Service : 4/5

Ambience: 4/5

Food: 5/5 

A must go for Hyderabadi Biriyani lovers. 

Looking forward to go there again.

Awesome place. Small but cosy. The ambiance is great, when I went it was mostly empty. The interior lighting was subtle and the staff was amicable. Coming to the food we ordered Murg Biriyani and Chicken Tikkia. The food came in ample quantities and the aroma was rich. The blend of spices was nice. Tasted like Hyderabadi biriyani but I guess that's what it was. Moreover a great place if you want good food and a quiet place to talk. Totally recommended for a family lunch/dinner. Would definitely go again.

I really have no idea why this place is rated so low. It has everything that a good restaurant provides and that too at a very affordable rate.
The ghost biriyani is brilliantly cooked where the mutton is tender and almost melts in your mouth. Ambience is very sober and the staff is very courteous. To add to it the service is prompt. To sum it up this place is definitely worth a visit, if not few visits.
Would love to see them go up the ratings.

The best part being the calm atmosphere... And the gosht biriyani in handi.. This place is a must visit for all foodaholics... All food here are of the Hyderabad gharana... The humble behaviour of the staff are also noteworthy

When it started off, Khawab was a go to place for most people in the locality. But now, half the time it remains closed and this place has also faced a dip in quality except for the Biryani which is awesomamazing! The staffs are helpful and the ambience is delicate. But considering the quality, its overrated.

such an ambiance, totally in love with it, had the assorted kebab platter.. decent and warm service, could have been a bit faster, kept us waiting for along time. 
kebabs were tender, well cooked, but didnt like the sour taste in every thing .. 
had double ka mitha as desert , it  didnt taste more than a bread soaked in milk, flavored with cardamom... :P :P

We happened to crash on this place by chance..Located close to Girish Ghosh's house in Baghbazar we spotted this joint while looking for some decent eatery in the vicinity..Khawab has specialised in Hyderabadi cusine..they have also opened an outlet near Deshapriya Park as well..The interior is quite small with a few seating arrangements..seating and decor is decent enough,nothing extravagant..The servers seems to be new in the trade,so a bit inexperienced..Coming to the food I have found the dishes to be abit more oily,also overall the menu lacks consistency,some items are quite delicious while others are pretty ordinary..We ordered:
Mutton Shikampur Kebab: A burra kebab made of minded mutton,it was quite nice,loved the blend of spices..
Chicken 65: It was not good at all..the flavour of coconut overpowered the entire dish..
Gosht Handi Biriyani: Though it is supposed to be a Hyderabadi style biriyani but it lacks authenticity.. also not as tastefull as expected to be..a tad dry..
Chelo Kebab: This was actually better..the rice was nicely prepared,also the kebabs were soft and cooked nicely..
Chicken Tikka Masala: It was decent..the chicken pieces were soft and the gravy was tasty..
Double Ka Meetha: A hyderabadi version of shahi tukra..again good but I have tasted better version of this sweet dish in other restaurants..
Overall it was a mixed experience which suggests they are yet to acchieve perfection in half of their dishes..scope for lots of improvement..Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.1400/- approx for 4 people,so quite economical..

Khawab is a kind of resturent which is belongs a gharana,like a special trend in their dishes. But almost a tresure in the heart of north. A very suitable place for dine out.

have always heard mixed reviews about this place, so with fair bit of optimism i chose to try them out for a takeaway. But it was utterly disappointing experience.

Located near shaymbazar, khawab is couple of years old and has opened few more branches in the city. The staff are polite and warm. The pricing is veery reasonable and serving very generous.

However the point where it lacks is the taste of food. The food tastes average and is too oily.I tried the black dal that was very thin but edible. The paneer makhani was too oily and very bad. The tawa paratha was a disaster and way too oily. The veg biryani had a huge serving and lacked taste as well as aroma and was very mediocre.

Overall it was a bad experience and i would prefer to avoid khawab!!!

Visited this place during the pujas. They did not have most options on the menu. Basic items like naan/roti was not to be found. The food was average and vegetarian food,though present on the menu,was really sub par. Non veg kebab wasn't bad but nothing to write home about either. The portion sizes are large and two can easily eat from a plate.The manager was grumpy,inhospitable bordering on rude. However,the person who served us was polite enough. However,wouldn't go back again.

P.S-People from hyderabad would be shocked at what these folks serve as hyderabadi biriyani

Been to this place once, a month back for a real quick lunch. Lately got a chance to taste their food again since they have put up a stall in our office premises. Both the times I have tried their Hyderabadi Biriyani with Raita, the Raita goes well with the Biriyani but to be very true the Biriyani didn't quite please my taste buds, more so because I felt it was too spicy & oily for me and tad overcooked. Though the chicken piece in there was big and tender enough. Really loved their Egg Paratha with Aloo Sabji, I guess a must-try if you want to go for a quick snacks at this place. Their Paratha with Chicken Chaap also tastes good, but it is quite oily and can make you feel full for hours. Would like to try out their Chelo Kabab next. Overall a nice place with quick service and good food at very affordable prices. Cheers!

We are very much disappointed after getting food from Khawab, Baghbazar, Kolkata. today we placed bulk order  for Chiken  Mutton and Veg Biryani. Our experiance was so horible when we found a "Big Insect" in Veg Biryani and the  taste of food was worst, Mutton was so stuff, and over burned, rice was not so fresh.

 we clicked a snaps attached herewith for reference.  even when we complaint to Store Manager of the said store  we got only "SORRY" message that's all.

I have visited this place multiple times with my friends, even now they have a small outlet in my office canteen also. all their outlets present in kolkata, are not big enough. so, the ambience is good, nothing special. rather i would like to mention about their stuffs more. they are quite helpful and well-behaved. you can take their advise if you are planning for a random tour of their menucard. 

now coming to food, i have tried chickken malai tikka, afgani fish tikka, mugh and gosht handi biriyani, egg and keema paratha. i must say their kababs are really delicious, their main attraction. they prepare mainly hyderabadi biriyani, but it was soso, didn't like too much though i am very much biriyani lover. quantity-wise it was fine.
regarding the paratha, egg paratha is still better, i could not like the keema paratha at all, the keema amount was very less and cosidering this, the price for the non-veg parathas looks quite high compared to their quality. i can find many restaurants in kolkata preparing much better paratha in lesser price. 

so, as a whole if want to fulfil your 'khwaab' i.e. 'dream' for kababs, i can suggest this place...

I visited "Khawab" last summer with some of my friends. the ambiance of the restaurant was very elegant, along with their service style.  They sure will make you feel like you are in "Khawab (it means Dream)". Now talking about their food I can say the Biryani is not up to the mark but their Kebab platter is delicious. We also tried "Double ka meetha" which I tried before on a different restaurant but never tasted good as it was in here. So overall it is a nice place to try some authentic Mughlai cuisine, but if you try their Kebab and Desert then you are in for a treat....

I don't really know why this place has such low ratings! I visited the place some time back,but just loved their food. The decor is nice and the ambience was really good. Besides the waiters were always ready to help and helped us with the menu. Prices are reasonable and quality of food is also good. We had ordered for the assorted kebab platter and all the three types of kebabs tasted truly great. The biryani (special gosht biryani in handi) tasted great and the amount was really nice and I was more than satisfied with it. The raita served alongside the biryani goes well. Dahi ke chatni tasted good too. To wrap it up we ordered for firni which was more like any other restro. But surely the main course is the draw here and will make you visit this place again.
I want to go back as soon as possible and wanna know if their standards have fallen,else why such low ratings??? :(

I had pretty bad experiences in khawab outlets that is in anderson club southern avenue and deshapriya park.food was cold and full of bony mutton pcs nd quite dry and undercooked.so i always against of going to khawab bt oneday my bf wanted to go to Khawab- Baghbazar outlet as he heard you get good hyderabadi biriyani.i was not very happy still i went nd after tht meal i fell in love with this place.this outlet. its a small place may be may b 15-20 seats bt as u enter the place it will give u a royal look. chairs tables and pictures on the wall and the ambience too good. staffs are quite co operative. we ordered mutton biryani one small handi and a mutton curry dish.when the biryani came it was amazing with kaju nd fried onion on it,big mutton pcs(4pcs) nd eggs(2pcs) PERFECT HYDERABADI BIRIYANI!!!!mutton was soft tender juicy and biryani is jst perfect with less oil. mutton curry dish was fine. the food was so nice tht i cant believe they run same outlets in anderson club and deshapriya park....you should go to khawab baghbazar to have food only...rest of the outlets r quite horrible...i think they should close those outlets and conc on this only....and last bt not the least you should try their mutton halim durin ramzan months....u wnt get tht good halim newhre in kolkata...not even arsalan...its amazing!!!!

i tried their haleem during Ramzan months...its diff than any other haleem available in kolkata...its jst like Pista House(HYDERABAD)....meat are minced and its a semisolid consistency(jst like mutton keema) bt its diff thn any popular mughlai shops in kolkata....bt last yr 2013 when i had this halim it was more meat bt this yr 2014 they reduced the amount less meat nd price increased....atleast when they sell something unique then they should take care of their quality....

Khwab is one of the most tastiest restaurants in the heart of Calcutta.  Tandoori chicken is one of the very best tandoori i have ever tasted. The murg biriyani is just gorgeous, wit spicy flavors of India. The kebabs are awesome with some smoky taste. It is great altogether, with good ambiance, and good service status. The only problem is you will feel complete lack of privacy. the place is bit small to maintain huge number of customers. The place is bit noisy too. For great food, great service, and home delivery times i have rated it 3.0 2 points are deducted cause of the restaurant space, and noisy environment. The place is bit over crowded. Else its a perfect weekend dining restaurant. i can bet you will love the food.

Khawab … The magnificent Hyderabadi Biriyani Joint now opens a Nicely decorated and Amazingly beautiful Restaurant at Bagbazar … 
From the extensive menu of them I suggest to start with Chicken Malai kebab, Mutton Shikampoor Kebab and Mutton Nargis Kebab …
Just bowled out by their awesome Shikampoor Kebab ... everyone should try this Hyderabadi delicacy..
As main course I like to have Gosht Biriyani In Handi along with the Rogan Josh or Murg Tikka Masala or Chicken Jhalfreji .. Anyone who ever tried their biriyani will have to return to re experience that Heavenly Hyderabadi taste .. 
They also offer unique Keema Paratha and Chelo Kebab which I advice a must try .. 
and not only that, Visitors also offered there an Extensive List of Rolls too .. 
Service here is very good and The staff are always ready to help the customers ..
And all these in a very affordable price ..
Overall, Dining at this beautiful Restaurant is really a Memorable experience ..

I am writing my review on my 2nd visit. 1st time I availed their take away service. This time I tried dine -in.
Me with 4 of my friends entered the restaurant near about 10 pm on last sunday. We waited for almost 15 mins to get a table. Meanwhile I am really enjoying their ambiances. Great wood works complimented with good wall hangings and light arrangements. When we got the table it was almost their closing time. We ordered for 2 Chicken Biriyanis, 4 Parathas, 1 Bhuna Gosht, 1 Sali Gosht, Salad and Kulfi. We friends are quite a foodie. But when they served meal was quite a heavy. Parathas are soft and crisp. Muttons are juicy and well cooked. And really you can feel two different unique flavor in two mutton dishes (which i couldn't find in many restaurants, gravy r used to almost same many times, even in arsalan). Biriyanis are served in handis. Tastes really good. Service guys are waiting for our desert order even after their closing time with a smiling face. One extra mark for their hospitality. We finished at almost 11 pm. But they greeted us with the same way the used to do in normal times.
Now the best part. Bill amount is Rs. 1112 inclusive of all taxes (almost Rs. 222 every person). This place should come under "Pocket Friendly" option.

I had a desire for very long time to visit any one of the Khawab outlet, yesterday had the opportunity to visit the Shyambazar outlet though its not in shyambazar, its situated in Baghbazar!! Their tagline shows that they specialize in Hyderabadi biryani and kababs but after tasting both biriyani and kababs i can surely say that if that items are their specialities then they must stop preparing those items as they are horrible!! Hyderabadi Gosht biriyani was like rice soaked in ghee with raw chewy mutton pieces,, one of the worst biriyani ever..I have tasted hyderabadi biryani at hyderabad and khawab biriyani doesnot come even close to that, its not hyderabadi biryani at all, it can be called Khawab biryani only, they should know that the quality of biryani depends on its aroma, flavour, taste, quality of meat etc not on how much oil or ghee is used in that..only plus point is that the proportion is huge, one plate can be shared by two easily and may be three also.. Now comes to the kababs, we ordered chicken hariyali kabab and mutton shikhampore kabab.. hariyali kabab was not at all green, it was charred to the extent that it was looking totally black.. Shikhampore kabab was like galawati kabab but very dry and tasteless.. After having disastrous biriyani and kababs we thought that now we should try some bread items and to our surprise they didnot have any breads other than parathas, a full fledged restaurant serving only parathas as bread item is really surprising to see.. we ordered veg items - alu paratha and veg jhalfarezi with chicken 65..Parathas were very big in size , one is enough for one but as it was tawa paratha not tandoori ones so it contained lots and lots of oil and very little potato stuffing..veg jhalfarezi was surprisingly good and chicken 65 was the best of the lot..  atleast we get to eat some good items at last.. the restaurant is small, having only 6 tables and can accommodate about 25 people but the time we spend there only one table was occupied other than us, rest of the 4 tables were empty and on a sunday evening an empty restaurant on an area where there are not many north indian options present tells a lot about the quality of the restaurant!!! pricing is very pocket friendly and vat is included in the price.. Though the restaurant is very neat and clean and staffs are polite but the main items they serve are not good at all so its not a restaurant for repeated visits, one visit is enough, for me atleast..

Authentic Hyderabadi Gosht Handi Biriyani = 100% shuddh desi ghee se bani hui khushi! The best I've ever had. The Basmati rice was fragrant, the mutton pieces were soft and juicy, the egg was cooked to perfection and the spices were just right. I was literally in gastronomical heaven this afternoon. Experienced foodgasm after foodgasm with every spoonful I had. My cousin had ordered paratha and chicken chaap for lunch. Both of these tasted super freaking awesome. The thick gravy of the chicken chaap was both creamy and flavourful. The chicken just melted in my mouth. Still salivating. We ended the meal with firni, a dessert made with crushed rice grains. For me, the ambiance of any eatery is very important. Besides the fact that Khawab played only soothing Jagjit Singh ghazals softly in the background, the ornate wooden furniture, black-and-white photographs of old #Hyderabad, the dramatic lighting and the orange walls all commingled to give the place a very royal, vintage and opulently classy look. The photo of the #Charminar and the one showing a procession led by the Nizam in 1880 were magnificent and awe-inspiring at the same time. Loved the quaint, quiet, subtle and sophisticated air about the place. I also liked the paper table mat used at Khawab because of the couplet written on it in Urdu.

It really pains me to see that this place has received such low rating..!! I have been there several times and there is no doubt in my mind that they make just amazing..any other word would be an understatement...amazing Biriyani and Kebabs.

The ambience is good and location is great. Situated on the main road it's imposible to miss it out. The waiters are friendly and the kitchen has a transparent glass cover so you can see the chefs at work in case you have hygiene issues.

I've tried their variety of biriyanis and they make it really well. Their raita is tasty. Their kababs are great too especially the hariyali kabab. The quantity they provide is sumptuous so good value for your money too. I highly recommend this place for lovers of Biriyani.

yesterday it was my 1st visit to this place and i just loved it! its insane! completely insane! we ordered for a gosht biryani with dahi ki chatni (rs. 175 with tax), a green salad (rs. 50 with tax) and a firni (rs. 45 with tax). the waiter there helped us in choosing the right menu. we already had heavy evening snacks, so we opted for light dinner. Gosht biryani consisted of 8 pieces of mutton, a egg and no potato, this place serves you total authentic hyderabadi food mind it! the gosht biryani was enough for two of us. however if you are hungry then you should go for half plate biryani each. the biryani comes with dahi ka chatni and raita. the biryani was too good. it was light and had a very mild smell. those who prefer light biryani with just a hint of 'biryani' smell will like it. to our astonishment they had served 8 pieces of mutton at this price!! and that too the pieces were of normal size, not even of small sizes. the total bill was rs. 282 with a service tax of about 4%. their prices are vat included i assume. the raita served with the biryani tasted good. the dahi ka chatni will work as a gravy for those who prefer biryani with some kind of gravy or chap. the firni served was also good.
the staffs are very cordial. the place is very warmly decorated playing too good jagjit singh gazals...  :D  i just fell in love with the environment at once. and to the top of it they were serving us in typical hyderabadi style.
atlast we ordered for another raita, and guess what it was complimentary!  :)  will definitely visit this place again.

If it claims that the hyderabadi biriyani is its biggest usp then sorry i dont think so.... during my last visit i firmly felt that if hyderabadi biriyani is what you want to have then you can visit some other place and consider some other option than this.....

I had been to this restaurant with my family today. I ordererd for biriyana, kababs, parantha & alurdom as well as chicken 65.
The food quality was horrible. All foods are of same raste. The spices are not properly mixed. The potatoes of alurdom was not cooked properly. The khabab too tasted horrible.

Awesome restaurant. The Handi Biriyani and Dum Ki Murg is just awesome. One of the best biriyani place in Kolkata. Beside the food is really reasonable. I've visited Khwab more than 20 times and everytime the food and hospitality is awesome. 
N.B: Don't visit here at the Durga Puja times, because their main delicious menus will not present at the Puja Days. 
Beside their kababs are also very very delicious. I just love Khwab. :)

Basically me and a friend of mine entered this place cause we couldnt find any good  food joint nearby.But to my surprise  the well-decorated interior and the extremely courteous staffs impressed me instantly.We ordered chicken biriyani ,mutton korma and chicken malai kebab.I found the chicken malai kebab a bit too salty .The biriyani was very light and well-cooked.The mutton korma complimented it pretty good.The service was fast enough.I wouldnt say the biriyani was the best biriyani I ever had,but its worth a try.Overall this place is doing quiet well.

This restaurant claims to serve authentic Hyderabadi food. While the decor and the ambience do attempt to evoke a sense of Hyderabad, the food is not really that good overall.

Ordered Haleem (a special, since Ramzan was on), a plate of Gosht Biriyani and a Double ka Meetha for dessert.  The Haleem was unlike what I'd had before - it was rather dry. It was also served in a very small clay bowl - the sort used to serve firni. In my experience, haleem is usually served in larger quantities. The biriyani was not great either. The rice was cooked properly, but the meat was not tender enough. The amounts of the Mirch ki Salan and Raita served along with the biriyani were too little. The only really good item was the Double ka Meetha, which was rich and sweet.

The waiters were polite and the service was quick. However, barring the dessert, there's no item that can be recommended, so this place is not really one that needs to be visited twice.

The Location of the Hotel is Just Beside the " Home of Girish Ghosh"  at Bagabzar . 

The "Khawab " is very Small Restaurant Having only 5 Tables with Beautiful Interiors of Old Style .
It  reminds me taste  " Old Calcutta" .Wooden Louvered Window  , Historical Wall Art Photography Collection , The Music , Ambience ,  is awesome .

The Kababs are somewhat "Special " , very Tasty and Not the usual stuff that the nearby restaurants used to offer . The Assorted Kabab is very well designed in view of customers requirement. Their speciality is Biryani .  They served Biryani  in a Handi . After a very Long Day I got a chance to have this type of Biryani - Awesome and not very spicy topped with fried Onion. This is the only place where I found that the Mutton Side dish is supporting the Biryani .  

This place  serves only Hydrabadi - Mughali dishes . But in that range also they are quite good in satisfying the customers requirement .

The Waiting time was long but worth . 
You can plan for Take Away if u are in Hurry .

This Place is Very small dine-in so if you  are planning for large Party Please be carefull .

Oh, this one was impressive. On a hot Sunday afternoon, anything with a bit of shade and less shimmer causes upto you beseeching you into a fiesta of indolence and this was the place where I found the  perfect ambiance to relax myself and yet have a sumptuous lunch. Their interior has an Awadhi touch to it, and not the blatant brush up "on the face". 

As you soothe into the idea of settling for a Biryani they offer you lots of choices of sides and starters to go with.the staff are impeccably courteous,and their service was as smooth as it could be,backed by a prompt service.

We ordered Chicken Biryani(full) - it came with two pieces if chicken and an egg, and Aloo Paratha, Boondiya Raita and Double Meetha. Each of these were delicious, and the Biryani is worth mentioning, easily more impressive than Arsalan, Shiraz, Alibaba, Bedouin, Royal, etc. Its a must try for all you foodies. I do find a major  fault with the Raita, and would be happy to be served Raita with actual "boondiya" in it when I order one but they served it in a portion fit for a family (in a bowl the size of frying pan) and I hate to say I was appeased.

Go khawab! you have captured our culinary (khawa) dreams( khwab). Time to take on the tandoor moguls of Kolkata.

Good Hyderabadi Biriyani at Kolkata. Though the quality of Mutton was not very good. Decoration is nice. Service is ok and staffs are attentive. Less crowded. If you have no other choice around Shyambazar / Bagbazar area then only recommended to visit.

This place makes (yes, they still make) the best Hyderabadi Biryani in Calcutta. That can be the only reason to visit this place repeatedly. The restaurant is very small, but, apart from one table, which is just in front of the washroom, is comfortable. Decor is nicely done and maintained. Service is friendly, quick and attentive. 

Now the food in details. Among the starters Chicken 65 was excellent. Loved the spices and loved the soft chicken. Chicken Shashlik was good too. Shikampoor Kebab and Shami Kebab were tasty but a bit dry. 

Next the main item. The half plate biryani (2 pieces of mutton and an egg) is enough for two people if you order starters, side dish and desserts. The taste of the biryani is completely different if you are used to only Calcutta biryani. They should not be compared, but loved as separate dishes. We visited this place several time in the past and were always impressed by the biryani. This time too the rice and the spices were excellent, the raita and the mirchi ka salan served along with the biryani were great too. But the mutton pieces were disappointing. We were used to absolutely melt in your mouth pieces. This time both the pieces were boney and a bit tough too. I sincerely hope this was one bad day in the office for the chef.

Side dishes here are never very exciting. But yes, the chicken and the mutton pieces used to be great. This time too (Mutton Rogan Josh), unlike the biryani meat, the mutton pieces were tender.

Among the dessert Double Ka Meetha was just OK. The bread was too thick. But the Firni was a winner. It was not solid as found in most places here and the texture was more like the Payash. Excellent!

Positives - 

Go for the Mutton Biryani and don't order any side dish with it. We have tried 5-6 Chicken / Mutton items and found the best combination is the biryani, raita and mirchi ka salan.
Firni
Starters. Specially Chicken 65 and Chicken Shashlik

Negatives - 

Quality of mutton deteriorated (Though I sincerely hope today was an exception)
They have discontinued about 40% of their original menu. 

A 3.5 from me

A place not worth visiting. Its a two minute walk from my home & so opted for a delivery...the quality of the meat is horribly low. I tried it thrice & was disappointed each and every time. Found a bone inside a Hariyali kebab & I was shocked to see how small the portions are. Its a no no for those who want to visit.
