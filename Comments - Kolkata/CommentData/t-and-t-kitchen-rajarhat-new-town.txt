This place is near Unitech gate 2, it's a roadside eatery...so don't expect much here, however if you are from Mumbai or if u have been to Mumbai & you are a fan of roadside Chinese of Mumbai....then you must visit this place..this place will offer you triple schezwan rice (Mumbai style) & it taste pretty good..

Momos are what eases my stessful day in office. Their chicken momos are so juicy, it just melt in your mouth. Though the soup is just not upto the mark. A plate of chicken momo will cost you 80 bucks which is slightly high I feel. Overall a good road side momo joint around the office place.

T and T kitchen provides the best indo-chinese street food in rajarhat area.Pan fried veg momo is the best item here,as it is very tasty and also very cheap.Shezwan mixed chowmin is also very tasty.Here, Chilli chicken and fried rice is also very tasty and its available at a very reasonable price.Overall all the items here are very tasty and also very cheap.

After hearing alot about this place we went to try it. However the chicken steam momo turned out to be a big disappointment. Yes there were 8 big pieces of momo but it seemed that all of then had only onions as their stuffings. We didn't find any chicken whatsoever. Plus the extra oil on the momo didnt help. It left us with a bad taste in our mouth. We had to eat something else after that to get over the taste.

They'd set up stall at Labony Housing during Durga Puja this year. Tried their chicken pakoda on Dashami. The set of 5 pakodas reminded me of the ones sold at Bapi Da's. They were fresh, crispy, good in size and stuffed with good quantity of delicious chicken. Sprinkled with lemon juice and accompanied with fresh-cut onion rings, they were appetising enough to replete one's stomach. The chicken pakoda is definitely worth a try.

This is a street side stall right outside my office. It has proper arrangement like table and chair to enjoy your food. I have had Chicken Hakka Noodles and Chicken Steam Momo. Both of them were very low on the pocket pinch. Hakka Noodles was scipy and had a decent amount of vegetables. They Serve a good portion of Noodles for one person to have. They served around 8 Pieces of Chicken Steam Momo for 50 bucks. Each of them were quite large. The stuffing was decent but the only turn off for me is that they use a lot of oil in preparing their momo.They are very few options outside Unitech Building and the offerings of this place is quite good in comparison to the other stalls in the area.

This place is just outside of my office, so is often visited by us. This is a roadside place so ambience is not at all expected out here but the quality of food is really cherishable. The food over here is very spicy and tasty, and quantity of food is worth for money as well.

I visit number of time to this out let ,all the crew and owner seems to be  well mannered .comparing  to others nebour out let they are hyginic and all food they give are fresh and healthy to eat.
Quantity and quality of all cusine are well maintained .
I have tried all dishes .my best cusine i could say is juicy momo.
Note: if u are late evening than i could say u will be unlucky person to order momo.cox their stock finish within 6pm.
I have tried .tempura,golden fried prawn,steak and pakcho noodles are are well cooked .

So i should say must visit and try their dishes.

Soul satisfying food at its best!! Well we eat at T&T kitchen atleast 6 times a month- it's our personal favourite food joint outside the unitech gate2. The momos are just juicy to the core, not only chicken but even the veg momos ooze with delicious juicy fillings.. Every version of their noodles and fried rice are so much in demand that they need to boil fresh noodles very evening. Authentic dry chilly chicken not only tops their menu list, but also the best of Kolkata chilly chicken. Other than this tempura chicken is a must try and in the never disappointing list- it is in fact soo good that you will surely come back for more. The chicken/fish in oyster sauce is a humble pick me up light chicken dish if you're looking for a light calories dish. Life can be quite a downer when you try roadside fish recipies but with these guys you can sure to have a great experience- everything is great! However I will reserve the best for the last- soups! Every recipie is the perfect "chicken stew for the soul!! " my personal favourite is the mixed lung fung soup- it might not be as daring as its Chinese original , so be rest assured you won't find any snake! But cooked with fresh bamboo shoot topped with a thick egg white froth, it's an absolute treat for the soul! I am yet to try out the thenuk- hand made noodles and the pasta- but believe me it's worth paying the first visit, coz you're definitely gonna come back for more! Way to go T&T!

Perhaps the best and also the priciest outlet for Chinese cuisine outside Gate #2 of Unitech. When you go out of Gate 2 turn left and keep walking towards Gate 1 till you reach this outlet on your left. Their food has a touch of authenticity - we had pan-fried momos (quite spicy), veg fried momo (ample filings of onion) and chicken steamed momo (lived upto the expectations). The chefs are all folks of the north-east and they are quite friendly. It's quite a popular joint among the Unitech people who like Chinese and in the evening there is quite a crowd so the service time is slightly high.
