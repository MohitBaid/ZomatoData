AFC is a road side stall, in the lanes of rammandir. This is an amazing crowd catching place, as the lane is a hub of tuition going students. I visited the place to have some snacks with a friend of mine after a tuition. We had corn cheese garlic bread, mixed sauce pasta and corn cheese sandwich. The garlic bread tasted amazing, however the sandwich could be improved. The pasta tasted amazing but the quantity is a little less. They also serve amazing pizzas, overloaded with cheese, which I plan to taste the next time. However, they don't serve authentic Mumbaiya Vada Paw, but serve Veggie Vada Paw in its name.
