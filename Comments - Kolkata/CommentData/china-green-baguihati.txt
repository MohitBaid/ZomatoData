Amazing food out here.The varieties of fried rice are mesmerizing as well as different preparation of chicken.Mixed fried rice and singapuri chicken goes well and the ambiance is also soothing but late service.

BAD . MOST WORST SERVICE . ALWAYS WRONG DELIVER. WRONG ITMES . BAD BEHAVIOUR. MOST WORST RESTAURANT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY JUST DON'T CLOSE THE RESTAURANT. WROST SERVICE . WROST DELIVERY. WORST FOOD .
DON'T GO THERE. MOST WORST SERVICE.

1. IF YOU ORDER CHICKEN ITMES YOU WILL GET DELIVERY OF VEG ITEMS.
2.And the next day when you go to restaurant you need to wait over hours to Change your order.
3. Bad Flood quality
4. WORST behaviour.

5. Don't go/order From the resturant

I have spend ¬†a lot of special times in this restaurant, with my friends and family. Each & every time, when we visited in this restaurant, they served us very tasty foods all the time. The food quantity are also very nice. If you have a special heart for Chinese Foods, China Green will be a good choice for you.

It contains a lot of my childhood memories.. That time it was the only restaurant in Baguihati which had best Chinese.. But in the mean time food quality falled drastically..  But since last 6months I am visiting their place and it has improved a lot.. Dry chilly chicken is one of the most delicious dish of them.  I am really liking their food now.

I don't write reviews regularly rather this is my first time, but trust me this place is the worst to visit. They just have a attractive sitting area and that's it. If you ever see the inside of the kitchen or the way they process their food and the hygiene standard they follow, you will never ever step inside again. And for my personal experience, year2008 was the last time I ever ordered from here because I found a tiny half of a cockroach in the fried rice I had ordered. So, you can pretty much guess from that what kind of "hygiene" standard they follow. It's better to stay hungry than waste your money in here.

I am a nearby and regular customer for this joint. Be it home deliveries or dine in, I have checked out max dishes here. The food has never disappointed me taste wise and quantity wise. For spicy preference must try chicken manchurian here. Fried rice can also serve as single main course dish without any sides.

Few years back this used to be the best Chinese restaurant in baguati but as the time passed their quality of food and services have fallen. Even last time  when we visited the restaurant the services were very poor half of the items in the menu card were unavailable. We had to have biriani in a Chinese restaurant because Chinese wasn't available. As expected biriani even didn't tasted good. China green lost it's glory totally.

The restaurant is the best option for Chinese in baguiati area.Now if you have your choice area Spread till chinarpark or shyamnagar,then lots of better option,but in baguiati I guess the most decent option is this.
This restaurant is here for quite a few years now,as I remember my dad used to bring chicken Chow from here when I was in my school which is almost 8 -9 years now which was the best THEN.
Now to the food part.Tried sweet corn soup(non-veg) , Chicken fried rice and Thai chicken.
First the quantity was huge. The soup was disappointing as it had more egg white than chicken or corn.The rice was nice and cooked properly. The chicken gravy tasted same as sezwan chicken.
So to rate it, good place to have dinner as it's the only descent place to eat in baguiati.

An average restaurant at your nearby where you can visit for Chinese, tandoor dishes. The place is not so big but the ambiance is really nice. I have visited here so many times with my family, friends etc. I have tried chicken noodle, Singapore noodle, chopsue, biriyani, naan, paneer items which are so so in taste.. If you are resident of Baguiati area and you are running out of money but want to eat Chinese food then this restaurant is a perfect place of your hunger.

The only reason I am giving it 2 is because the staffs were very polite and well mannered.

There was a time when 'restaurant' and China Green were synonymous in Baguiati. Things have changed. Food quality has declined, so has service. They take customers for granted and serve half-cooked food. Don't even think of visiting here during pujas. They served us uncooked shrimp last time.

China Green is an affordable decent restauraurant.The vibe of the place is not bad.Although it offers chinese,mughlai and other indian dishes.The chinese items have the best value for money.The quality and quantity of the items are good enough.The quality and service of the place during festive time decreases.The overall main attraction of the place is the peaceful atmosphere  the good quality food at decent prices.It has nothing special to offer and the price have also gone up a notch.But if you are looking for a good enough bite with a decent price tag,this is the place to go.Suggested items:chicken reshmi butter masala,mixed gravy chowmein,butter nun,reshmi kabab,chicken tikka masala.

Good alternative to the fancy ones all around. This little joint is hard to notice. In fact none of the people I went with noticed it. The price seems to have gone up recently, especially the rice items which I felt were a tad more expensive compared to the other fancy places. But the food is still good. The garlic chicken is excellent and I loved how the chicken pieces were soft and well cut. Overall this is a good place to go to only if they don't increase the prices again.

The ambiance is what attracts lot of people. Quiet yet crowded. Food is good and tastes well. It is very popular among the Baguiatians. However, I don't like their Indian section but no doubt their Chinese section is worth trying. Also, I find it little costly compared to their food quality. ¬†Its a family restaurant and can take your kids or your parents for a good dinner. To conclude I would prefer their Chinese always. :D

Location and Description: Its too inside the Baguihati bazaar. near the baguiati VIP market. Place is been a bit awkward. from outside if you see u will find the resto looks empty and quite but its always crowded from inside.

Ambience and Staff: This place has got quite big ambiance for sitting, very lengthy with dim light and full air conditioned.
Last i went with my family and relatives long ago. We parked our car which was a headache there. Its a good place to eat Chinese food.

Food: Coming to the food so we ordered Tandoori chicken as starter which was good followed by the Sweet corn soup which was also very nicely made. In the main course we had Mix rice that was really an average with Chilly chicken and prawn Manchurian (very nice). Nan was on a oily side. Prices were a bit factor then also and now i can see its a big factor still.

QNQ & Prices: Quality is good but sometimes i felt quantity is not too god. prices are a bit high.

Conclusion: Overall a nice resto to have chinese stuff.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

This restaurant is one of the oldest in the locality. i remember visiting this place with my sibling and cousins as children. ¬†It would to be our saving grace whenever we wanted to eat Chinese food but did not have enough pocket money to spend on an expensive place. The food quality is consistent over the years and till now i love the egg fried rice that they serve here. The chilly chicken is simply awesome here. It is the typical chilly chicken which a Bangali would love to taste. Do not expect a hifi fine dining experience here. If you are in the mood to have some local good chinese food then this is your place to be.

Being the nearest restuarant to my home, i have visited this place innumerable times ...... infact i had watched this restuarant the very first day it opened (i was a school boy at that time though :) ) ......... Its one of the very few local restuarants here that have stood the test of time :) ...... quite a number of restaurants have been inaugurated and later on closed in the same tenure .....one of them being the one inside AC market, just nearby to China Green ....... 
The cook in china green has changed several times ....and so have their preparations , though retaining the same names of the dishes ...... e.g previously they used to make paneer butter masala in thick white gravy , after which they changed it to brown colour and making it more spicy ..but retaining the same name of the dish ........ then later on after getting reviews/complaints from customers , again changed it back to the previous one(white gravy less spicy) ...... 
In fact , few years back ,the taste of quite a number of items here deteriorated ,then i switched to another local restuarant named Hotel Taaj to satisfy my palate ........ but thankfully after they changed the cook again, it slowly retained its position gradually ........ though overall, i would still rate Hotel Taaj better than this one, but i should say Chine Green also doesn't lack far behind ........
As of now, the food overall tastes quite good ....have a variety of items ....... but 'quantity' not as much as u would get in Hotel taaj .......
Ambience is standard compared to a local restuarant .......
I have tried all types of fried rice items and side dishes chicken items that are in the menu ...... for veg section i like polao ....with paneer butter masala  ......
Quite a few years back they used to serve some special chicken dishes, i dont remember the names now ....but the preparation was special in the fact that the chicken pieces were cut and shaped in such a way that they looked like prawn or a fish in gravy, but were actually chicken and u wont be able to realize it before u take a bite ,or unless already known ...... :) .....but sadly they stopped it after sometime ..i donno why ...... :(

Am a local n have been its customer for a while now. Recently I see the rise in quality of the food standard. I generally go for a home delivery, but dining in is good as well. Service is not so good though.

The worst restaurant I have ever visit...no service at all. They even don't know how to behave with the customers.... they will make you wait for the food for so long and then will say "sorry sir, we don't have enough food..."  They just spoiled my birth day...I wish I could ban them...now it's up to you...do you really want to go there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Excellent Restaurant in the Baguiati area where good restaurants are really scarce.Its a small restaurant having muticuisine dishes.
Price is very reasonable.Rs 400 for 2 persons if you take separate dishes for both of them.Its a perfect place of hangout nearby our Home.
Highly recomended.
Also have Home delivery facility.They also accept credit and debit cards.
