If its possible for me.. I would have rank them - 5.. 
I was a regular buyer of them due to the location of this restaurant.. They does not maintain their food quality and test and apart from that they are not also manners worthy people.. If they did a mistake on taking order or placing food.. They will not admit that ever in spite of they starts to do misbehavior.. Guys please take this as a serious note.. They uses slangs also when they start scolding or fighting.. 
Substandard people.. Very low behavior... Low quality food, inefficient staffs.. And more over starts to act like local goons.. 
I would like to approach zomato to make such filter like - 1 to - 5.. For this kind of restaurants..

This is my new go to place for " cheap end of the month Chinese food " that i have discovered this year ðŸ˜‚ 
Shourav's is located near Ruby more, 5 mins from the narkel bagan bus stop. It's a typical roadside para r restaurant where you go to meet your sudden hunger pangs. I've always had take away from here. And till date I've had their fried rice, Hakka noodles, chilli chicken, chilli garlic chicken and pan fried fish. I loved almost everything each time but the pan fried fish was best till date. People who live nearby please do visit this place or order in. I'm sure that Shourav's will surely satisfy your cravings for Chinese food anytime of the month and not burn a hole in your pocket ever!!!
Happy Dining Peeps :)

A small food shop with limited seats but relatively large menu. That's what this place is for me. I have tried fried rice , chili chicken, some other chicken dishes,chicken noodles,wraps . I liked the egg roll of this place. They give large quantity of noodles which seemed to be a bit oily to me. Chinese dishes were not that good.

This is a tiny Chinese restaurant and is quite popular in its locality. My family is used to having their rolls and Chinese dishes for the last few years. Price is reasonable and quantity is decent. This time we ordered Veg Hakka Chowmein, Dry Chilli Chicken, Chilli Chicken (gravy), and Veg Fried Rice. But, we were quite disappointed with the quality. The Chowmein was ok but the Chilli chicken especially the dry one was just a waste of money. The chicken was stale. The rice was a bit hard and had uncooked pieces of carrot. Just because Shouravâ€™s has been our all time favourite local eatery, I will certainly give it another try.

It's prolly the best take out joint in Rajdanga area. The place is a little shabby. Once you taste their delicacies, there's not much to complain. 
Home delivery was within the given time. We ordered mixed hakka noodles, schezuan hakka noodles and chicken egg rolls. Quantity was good. Taste was good only if you ignore the dripping oil. Easy to locate. Pocket friendly.
I will obvio give it another go!

One of the most trustable food joints in the area, Shourav's has earned my loyalty with its fast and accurate service, and good food. It's been years now, and I can't think of a single occasion when their food failed to satisfy. Tasty, affordable dishes to pick from an extensive Chinese menu, Shourav's probably provides better food than expected, at the given price.
