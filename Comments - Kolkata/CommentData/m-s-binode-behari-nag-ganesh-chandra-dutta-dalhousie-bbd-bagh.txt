How on Earth does this eatery have such a low rating? Located at a walkable distance from Millennium Park , this old eatery serves proper traditional Bengali snacks.
So to pay a tribute to the beautiful winter we decided to go for the ever famous Karashutir kochuri served with oh-so-delicious chholar dal.And the surprise? Everything was served on banana leaves! Eco-friendly for sure!
After this we craved for something sweet and thus tucked into nolen gur rosogolla and kalo jam!!!OMG! These sweets just ended our meal on the perfect note! Would certainly visit again!
HappyEating!

This is a good place with a friendly man who manages the place. This place has great samosas and a friendly atmosphere. Went to this place while it was heavily raining and the hot samosas that they served tasted really nice and was perfect for the weather.
