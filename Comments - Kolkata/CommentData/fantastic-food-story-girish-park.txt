Ambience is simple, location of the restaurant is an added advantage.
Quick delivery service and even during rainy season.
Food is light and easy on taste buds. Pocket pinch is average.

The food is not that great according to it's price.
Specially tandoori roti was so hard that it cannot be eaten.
The food is little spicy here.

Since my mother did not feel like making dinner after a hard and tiresome day, she called me up asking me to get dinner packed for the family.
On the suggestion from one of my bestie and since the place was near to GP metro station, I decided to give this place a shot and landed up at the restaurant.
Ordered the food on the basis of suggestion from the waiter, got it packed and went home.
Since I was hungry, the first thing that I did on reaching home was having food. To my surprise, all the stuff that I had got was super delicious, special mention to Navratan Kofta.
The Dal makhani and the Kadai Paneer were also upto the mark, a balanced mixture of spices and cream.
The masala kulcha was soft even after 1hour of the food been packed.
Would definitely visit the place again and ask vegetarians to give this place a shot üëç.

Food is good..
I ordered CRISPY CHILLY BABY CORN and VEG SEEKH KABAB ..
Crispy chilly baby corn was very nicely cooked and yummy..
Veg seekh kabab little bit spicy but it was too delicious..

Please add more veg starters like paneer reshmi kabab,, paneer kali mirch kabab,, paneer hara bhara kabab because its a vegetarian restaurant,, i think you should add different paneer kababs to choose from menu..

Best dish of this restaurant is their spring rolls and the sauce they serve with this dish.
Chilly garlic noodles is also worth having.
Adequate quantity with quality.
Drinks are also too good.
We tried
Orange mojjito and mint mojjito, both tasted equally good.
Do try their spring rolls if you're reading this review :)

A much needed Dine in restaurant for Girish Park Area is finally here. 
Feeling little starving so for a quick bite visited here this evening to try a dish from here. 
It was situated in the vivekanand road just a minute walking from girish park main road crossing before domino's.
This was a multi cuisine restaurant which serves Chinese, Continental, North Indian and South Indian. 
D√©cor was really good a perfect dine in place. Beautifully designed and decorated restaurant. Area wise huge. Restaurant is in the first floor where There's a dine in area, separate couples sitting arrangement, a Hall for private parties. Comfortable sitting arrangement. 
Ambience was really good and so as hospitality. Friendly and helpful staff. Service in reasonable time and presentation was really good. Price was pocket friendly.
I tried their Butter Masala Dosa it was perfectly made and tastes really good. Sambhar and coconut chatni also tastes good. They maintained the quality of food very well.
A really nice experience with food and hospitality. A Must try place. Highly recommended to all.

As soon as I stepped inside..the first thing that struck me was the colour red. Then came the quirky names on the books ;
'Angels & Lemons ' 'The Famous Pies ' 'The monk who sold his chapati' Really? It was so creative! The place had already created a tiny niche in my heart.  It's not a very big restaurant...yet it's comfortably small. I liked the d√©cor. I hadn't been to a restaurant like this at Vivekananda Road. ( Obviously I can't compare it to the ones at posh localities ). It's simple yet beautiful. Good ambience?  Check. Good service ? Check. It wasn't too fast..but they've just opened and it was during Pujo.. so I forgive them. I'm sure they'll look into that soon. Good food? Check. The place is 100% vegetarian. The food was tasty, the quantity was sufficient (not too much, not too little) and the price was fine too. They don't have the complete menu as of now..and some of the items might not be available.. but do consider the fact that the place isn't even a few months old. The people are kind. Both criticism and compliments are welcome. We were personally asked about our take on the food. I think it's a good place and has a long way to go. Do come :)

Staff was friendly...food was ok ok...well not so bad toh not too wow also...but yeah good... according to the price everything was ok..but I feel the service needs to be looked into as in..too slow service...I ordered Nacho's and Pizza and they took around 30mins to bring my order...which was quiet annoying...and even after that wait if food was good the wait would have been acceptable...but Nacho's were seriously Yuk...as in needs serious attention... overall Noodles and all were ok...not bad...only Nacho's were on the worst side... place is well decorated...liked it...may visit again to get a better experience next time..!!
