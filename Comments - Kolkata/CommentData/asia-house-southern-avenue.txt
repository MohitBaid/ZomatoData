I recently visited Asia House for a bloggers' meet. I have been here a couple of times before, for bloggers’ meets, as well as a regular customer. My suggestion to the restaurant team will be to maintain the same level of quality and service on a regular basis that they offer during bloggers’ meets. I have tried the same dish twice here on different occasions, and found them different. The new thing that I noticed during my last visit for a bloggers’ meet is the addition the new 'meal in a bowl' to the menu. While the original menu is still in place, you can also choose from their ten options of the Signature bowls. 

The bowls we tried included the Bangkok Chilli Bowl, Chefs Late Night Bowl, The House's Laksa, A Chinese Lost in Burma, and the Indonesian Goreng Bowl. They varied from each other in terms of contents and flavours. I also loved how the Japanese concept of serving a wholesome, filling meal in a single bowl is catching up, and Asia House has come up with so many options in terms of flavours of China, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc. in them.

My favourites were: a) A Chinese Lost in Burma, which is a bowl of soft and juicy dimsums in a delicious hot and sweet curry, with crispy noodles; b) The House's Laksa, with a creamy yet spicy curry covering thick flat noodles. Unfortunately, we had to return the bowl because the noodles were completely uncooked, which came to our notice only after having tried them. 

The Chef's Late Night Bowl and the Indonesian Goreng Bowl were quite simple dishes. If you love really spicy food, then you can try the Bangkok Chilli Basil Bowl (which we tried with noodles). It brought me to tears!

We also tried the Shanghai Hawkers Soup, which is a nutty, garlicky bowl thick broth, filled with silky cubes of tofu, though it was quite bland. This was followed by the Asia House Special dumplings, which, with the lighter-than-air skin and a delicious sauce coating the melt-in-your-mouth dumplings, are an absolute must-have. 

To put a sweet ending to the meal, we had the fried ice-cream, with a lovely coconut coating. I have tried this at many places, but have never quite liked the end result, which usually has a soggy or doughy coating, a very strong flavour of coconut oil, etc. But, this one was quite good, with a light, crispy coating, and just the right amount of coconut flavour in it. We were also served the darsan and Vanilla Ice cream. I am not a big fan of darsan, and sadly, this one at Asia House did nothing special to change my mind. 

To sum it up, I liked a few of the items here. As I said,  Altogether, my last experience tells me that they have the potential to become a favourite among Asian food lovers.

So, the common rice bowls comes up with different variety fusions, with dimsums,  noodles, pastas and a wider range to choose from.  The interior is elegant, accompanied with a cosy atmosphere. What else? A good number of starters, which is sure to increase your food cravings.

Don't wait anymore, grab your bite!

A new addition on the lake view road eateries list, this place is quite small and hardly has any decor to speak for. 

Coming to the food, we ordered for their house special dumplings - the dumplings were thinly coated, the filling was good and the sauce on top made it taste even better. Lifted the taste of the dish. Next we ordered chopsuey, with fried noodles. Found the taste of this a bit bland. 
The meifoon noodles we ordered were good but the kung pao was also bland. Over all didn’t enjoy the food much. I would still like to try their bowls, question is if I would like to take the chance.

We ordered dinner last night based on the reviews  shared in zomato and I truly felt this has been overrated for some unknown reasons. Anyways, I am gonna share my experience which was quite average. We ordered 
Veg Thai Chilli Basil Noodles : They provided Meifoon which was little moist in texture and had no basil flavour for sure but didn’t taste bad. I didn’t understand why meifoon was provided, not sure if that was a  mistake as the description didn’t say it comes in meifoon neither I ordered Meifoon.

Thai Chicken Fried Rice : No thai flavour, not spicy nor any flavour of lemongrass. The rice was quite oily. Didn’t taste bad . Was edible.

Pan fried chilli fish : The batter used for the fish was quite thick. 

Sliced Chicken with celery and wine : This was a disaster. It was some kind of boiled chicken in a white broth. The gravy was so runny that we misunderstood the sidedish as some soup. Even soup tastes and looks better. And neither the gravy nor the chicken had even proper seasoning of salt. Forget about any other flavour. I am amused to have experienced such quality of food from one of the very few such highly rated restaurants. 

Packaging : It wad such badly packaged that half of the broth from the “chicken side dish” was floating inside the packet which ruined other boxes and the sauces.

Delivery: Ordered via Swiggy.

I would not recommend this place to anyone as this was my 2nd experience with them (1st was a dine in and was even pathetic in terms of food)and both the times it’s disappointing.

Looking for an authentic Chinese restaurant which supports a group hangout ? Well, you've come to the right place. The decor is satisfactory but the food is excellent. Try their Fried ice cream with chocolate syrup. Pure heavenly. Go give it a shot if you haven't already !

Ordered food via Zomato. Based on the excellent reviews I picked this restaurant. Mixed hakka and chilli garlic noodle, the Chicken Kai Pad Kraprow and Sliced chicken with bokchoy in rice wine - I must admit the Chicken Kai Pad Kraprow was sumptuous, so was the Sliced chicken in rice wine. Kai pad has the exquisite aroma of “godho lebu” or scented lime which made it stand out. 
The chilli garlic noodles blew me off. It was tangy , oozing flavours and very very tasty indeed. 

Asia House easily is one of the best Chinese go to place for me now . I wish the restaurant all the best.

Visited this place during the pujas. Although it was crowded but since we were just the 2 of us, we easily got a table. We ordered a tom kha soup, garlic noodles and a vegetarian gravy. The quantity was decent for 2 people. When the soup was served, there was a hair in it and I raised it with a waiter. He instantly took that bowl away and came back with a fresh bowl. The owner too came up to our table and apologised for it. Because of the crowd, the service was slightly slow.

Neat and tidy place serving very good Chinese food. A must try food joint for me. The best part is that they have not spoilt the dishes by complicating it with loads of fancy herbs and spices (very common now days) . Simple and yet tasty food. Chef's special Hawker soup recommended to set the mood.

A small restaurant with limited seating arrangement.  The cafe has a great ambience with unique lighting. Restaurant is perfect for family dinners or any kind of get together. There are limited staff (Two when we visited) The staffs are very friendly and polite. The prices are on the higher side for most of the dishes. Would suggest anyone who goes to here to try the
1. Mixed Schezwan Noodles (might be a little spicy)
2. Kung Pao Chicken

Ambience 4/5

Southern Avenue is that part of the city which has a lot of small sized power house eateries like this and are easier on the pocket. Asia House, located on this street, is a small yet comfortable restaurant which serves Oriental cuisine in a budget.

I was totally here for a quick no bull Chinese dinner and was impressed with the food. It was extremely tasty and the portions are decent. What's not right here is the service. Food takes a lot of time to arrive. My Drums of Heaven which was the best I had in a while took ages to be served. The hosts are efficient but the kitchen staffs.. mmhmm not much.

If good Chinese is your highest priority, a lousy service doesn't bother you, and you aren't famished like I was, then definitely this restaurant will bring you much joy and peace!

Cheers!

I try to be 100% honest in my reviews come what may. So this again is my honest verdict on a restaurant whose average Zomato rating is one of the highest in Kolkata. Let's call a spade a spade, I found nothing above the bar impressive about Asia House. On new year's eve, one does expect an hour long wait in any eatery in Kolkata and of course I understand that. However one does expect good food and service once you do get a seat which I am sorry to say, was not the case with Asia House. The ambience is minimalised and low on decor, however it does exute a warmth altogether. Now to the food,
Entrées comprised
✴Crispy babycorn in Kaffir lime and Thai sweet chilli--
"Let down" is the only word which pops in my mind when I think of the first starter. The lime punch was over powering and the sweet chilli failed to balance the dish culminating into an overtly sweet hit on the palate.
✴Konjee crispy chicken-- Failed to satisfy again. The crisp on the outer layer was fine but the chicken filling was quite hard and chewy.
✴Takrai Fish-- Another let down... The fish lacked the flaky smoothness you expect from a good quality fish dish and the balance was again missing with an overpowering sweetness looming large on the palate.
✴Asia House Special Dumplings-- A cracker of a dish to be very true, in fact it is the one starter I would highly recommend. The dumplings were soft and light with the texture of soy sauce playing wonders on the palate. We loved it so much that we had to order another portion of the same.
To the mains then which were better than the starters in every way,
✴General Tao's favourite chicken-- The chicken pieces were soft and the dish overall tasted great, the gravy being the highlight of the whole affair.
✴Pla Pad Kraprow-- A Thai fish side with the flavour of Thai hot chillies, herbs and basil sauce, this was a better fish dish than the fish starter. It had a better balance and the gravy again was good enough.
The chilli garlic noodles taken along was one of the best noodles I have ever had and as for the rice, though the texture could have been better, the flavour was well and good.
The desserts were the greatest saviours of the evening for sure.
✴Darsaan with Vanilla ice cream-- Hands down, the best darsaan in town. They were crisp, not overtly sweet and the chewy candied texture was well balanced with the ice cream.
✴Fried ice cream-- Definitely one of the better fried ice creams I have had. The coconut layer had an immensely beautiful taste which went well with the ice cream beneath.
✴Brownie with ice cream-- Though it was nothing extraordinary, it was good enough for sure. The only thing I didn't like about all the ice creams was that they melted away pretty quickly which you don't expect from a perfect ice cream quenelle.
The staff is limited and lacking in professionalism and I expect much better service since the waiting time in between starters and mains was abominably long which takes the spirit away from a meal. The pocket pinch on the other hand is not high.
So, overall, a bitter sweet experience sums up Asia House for me.

"Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what’s for lunch".

The coastal periphery of the planet was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. And now, we must admit that by approving multiculturalism in this Oriental side of the world, we are paving the road to White, Black, Indian, Asian to stupefy the world more with their pioneering talent. And as it happens, it is also cropping up in food and science. Every day they come up with new facts and, fares. 
Consequently, that proficiency can be seen in this eatery house, to conserve the lost cuisines of Asia and to present itself with marvelous platters of this continent. Wherefore, it gives a justification for its name: Asia House. A delightful eatery house,  with sensational decoration and aroma of Asian culture, besides unfailingly ready to show hospitality to every habitué. 
As a result, they acknowledged our presence with their signature concoctions, which got going with Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup, knocked up by fresh vegetables in an Asian broth flavoured with lemon and coriander. As the lemon and coriander was perfectly blended, it gave a recommended taste to the tongue. Appetizing! Next we wended our way to Burma to taste the Chinese over there, named: A Chinese Lost in Burma, where pork dimsums were dipped in a bowl of hot and sweet curry with crispy noodles and poached egg. Very flavorful and substantial to gulp it down. Till then Chinese were successful enough to trespass my tongue. Let's see how much they can outstretch themselves.

However, then Vietnamese had took away the position to astound me with Vietnamese Pho, which was a traditional Vietnamese soup with rice noodles, tofu, bean sprouts, bok choy, coriander, spring onions, red onion, basil, lime, chillies and, served with steamed rice. Vastly solid to digest it alone, nevertheless, their strike was perilous till then. Cherished every 'munch' of it. Although, the food strike wasn't concluded there, and the next catapult was from Indonesia, named Indonesian Bakso, consisted of Bali street vendors sweet and spicy broth, dimsums, peppers, lime and steamed rice. A third time, hefty and tasty platter to cram down. Nevertheless, the strike appear to come to an end with The House's Laska, made up of aksa curry, served over a bed of steamed flat noodles with burnt garlic coriander, fried onions, lamb and chilly oil. However, the stroke take us all to the city, named: Ho Chi Minh City Bowl, prepared of Vietnamese black pepper over a bed of red chilli rice and fried egg. And the concluding two dishes wholly usurped our tummy to forbid us to munch any other stuffs. Thus, undeniably they had left a signature to our heart and mind to lure us again to themselves. Admired every tick over there.

Searching for some good asian cuisine to celebrate my friend's birthday, we stumbled upon this wonderful and humble looking establishment located a few minutes from Quest Mall. Warmly welcoming, we chose to start off with roasted chilli pork and asian barbecued chicken. The pork was deliciously cut and tender on our tongue, while the chicken may have suffered in comparison but was a strong dish nonetheless. For the main course, we had Bali Street Vendor's Stir Fried Fish and experimented with a pork bowl of a Chinese Lost in Burma...the fish was excellent and while the bowl did threaten to overwhelm us with its quality, it proved an excellent complement to the fish. 

The staff was very pleasant and gave excellent recommendations when we were a bit confused. The decor while simple, is pleasant. In all, an excellent gastronomic travel of Asia - all for around 1400 which was wonderful value for money. Will come back again soon!

🔍location - Its located near southern avenue. 

👆Brief  -  For the first time I walked in to the Asian house and I obtained the best feeling."Asia house" launched some  authentic Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Burmese, Singaporean dishes, which are their Signature bowls. This peaceful place has the most delicious food for all the food lovers out here. 

💒Ambience -  wherever i go any to treat myslwf6in any restaurant , I always love to observe what is around me. The uniquely textured walls produce a smooth yet flowing look, this is place awesomely decorated with bamboo baskets, wooden blogs, filament bulbs 😍 and has the capacity of sitting 20 to 25 people. And the washroom is available there.

👤Staff - Each and every comforting smile the employees have on their faces makes me feel relaxed. The staffs are courteous and service is top grade. 

😋Things tried - 
Lemon Coriander Soup - we started our lunch with this simple looking soup, which actually carriers a tremendous taste itself, nd reminded me the famous saying that "dont judge a book by its cover".
It was made With fresh cut vegetables, small diced chicken pieces, floating coriander leaves and lime grass. 

🍴A Chinese Lost In Burma- It is actually a PORK based bowl, it was red, hot and sweet curry with pork dimsum along with crispy fried chopsue. 
And finally the pouched egg on top was like the cherry on the cake 😍. The dimsums were so soft that melted in the mouth, and the flavour superb. 

🍴Vietnamese Pho - This dish was so different than any regular dishes, This bowl was based on white gravy full of boiled seafoods, sprouts, carrot, onion, coriander, lime grass and Mei fun and a pinc of flavour of mustard. I loved this dish like anything, surely im gonna try this dish again! 

🍴Indonesian Bakso - It was another hot, red bowl with chicken dimsums along rice with butter. It carries the flavour of pepper, lime and it was perfect for the spice lover like me. I loved the dish for the authentic and strong taste of peeper yet it was not that much hot. 

🍴The House's Laksa -Now this bowl was like full of surprises, it was made by flat noodles, chopped fish.  It was mainly cooked into yellow coconut milk and was garnished with some barista and Coriander leaves. I had no idea that this bowl will rock the most, as we ordered two more bowl of The House's laska. 

🍴Ho Chin Minh City Lunch Bowl-It was hot and spicy, it was mainly lamb based, along with the veggies. The colour of the gravy was dark, lovely. The lamb was too juicy and perfectly cooked. It was served with steamed rice. I loved the dish so much. 

🍴Darsaan with ice-cream- The desert are like the happy ending of a movie.  We had crunchy, sweet darshaan along with vanilla ice cream. 

💰Purse check - The quantity of the bowls are good enough for two person, in that way it is pocket friendly. 

☺️Overall - Truly it is one of the  finest restaurant in Southern avenue. The restaurant  has a clean yet warm appearance. There, foods are just blessings. I must try and money worth restaurant 😍.

Southern avenue is adorned with restaurants serving diverse cuisines and has become the second Mecca for food lovers after Park street.  Asia House near Lake Kalibari is one of the most popular Pan Asian Restaurants and has already become very popular owing to the finesse with which they serve different cuisines- Chinese, Thai, Burmese, Vietnamese,Malaysian, Indonesian and Singaporean. The ambiance is really classy with simplistic yet sophisticated decor- the walls done in hues of white and red, upturned oval cane containers in place of chandelier and Japanese paintings adorning the wall altogether makes for a  Typical oriental setting. Christmas is just around the corner and winter has finaly set in which calls for hot and delicious meals without being overly spicy.Keeping that in mind a new concept Meal-In-A-Bowl being introduced by Aisa House which is basically a meal by itself and customization is available according to the liking of the guests. The Team Panchphoron was invited over by the management of this place for a food tasting session and here’s what’s so special about these newly introduced bowls-

A very tiny place with innovative decorations...we always have the voice in our heads telling us to recycle reuse and save our planet...this restaurant has very aptly followed that voice...General day to day stuff used for decor in brilliant ways.coming to food did not try the bowls which I suppose are good from the reviews...went ahead with coriander burnt garlic rice,chicken khowsuey,pepper garlic fish and tausi fish,the food was nice but the quantity is pretty less.there were hardly any mushrooms in the tausi fish.the staff was very courteous and pocket friendly...no can’t say that.well if you want to deviate from the big players in Asian cuisine you might check out this place.happy eating everybody!!

🔍location - Its located near southern avenue. 

👆Brief  -  For the first time I walked in to the Asian house and I obtained the best feeling."Asia house" launched some  authentic Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Burmese, Singaporean dishes, which are their Signature bowls. This peaceful place has the most delicious food for all the food lovers out here. 

💒Ambience -  wherever i go any to treat myslwf6in any restaurant , I always love to observe what is around me. The uniquely textured walls produce a smooth yet flowing look, this is place awesomely decorated with bamboo baskets, wooden blogs, filament bulbs 😍 and has the capacity of sitting 20 to 25 people. And the washroom is available there.

👤Staff - Each and every comforting smile the employees have on their faces makes me feel relaxed. The staffs are courteous and service is top grade. 

😋Things tried - 
Lemon Coriander Soup - we started our lunch with this simple looking soup, which actually carriers a tremendous taste itself, nd reminded me the famous saying that "dont judge a book by its cover".
It was made With fresh cut vegetables, small diced chicken pieces, floating coriander leaves and lime grass. 

🍴A Chinese Lost In Burma- It is actually a PORK based bowl, it was red, hot and sweet curry with pork dimsum along with crispy fried chopsue. 
And finally the pouched egg on top was like the cherry on the cake 😍. The dimsums were so soft that melted in the mouth, and the flavour superb. 

🍴Vietnamese Pho - This dish was so different than any regular dishes, This bowl was based on white gravy full of boiled seafoods, sprouts, carrot, onion, coriander, lime grass and Mei fun and a pinc of flavour of mustard. I loved this dish like anything, surely im gonna try this dish again! 

🍴Indonesian Bakso - It was another hot, red bowl with chicken dimsums along rice with butter. It carries the flavour of pepper, lime and it was perfect for the spice lover like me. I loved the dish for the authentic and strong taste of peeper yet it was not that much hot. 

🍴The House's Laksa -Now this bowl was like full of surprises, it was made by flat noodles, chopped fish.  It was mainly cooked into yellow coconut milk and was garnished with some barista and Coriander leaves. I had no idea that this bowl will rock the most, as we ordered two more bowl of The House's laska. 

🍴Ho Chin Minh City Lunch Bowl-It was hot and spicy, it was mainly lamb based, along with the veggies. The colour of the gravy was dark, lovely. The lamb was too juicy and perfectly cooked. It was served with steamed rice. I loved the dish so much. 

🍴Darsaan with ice-cream- The desert are like the happy ending of a movie.  We had crunchy, sweet darshaan along with vanilla ice cream. 

💰Purse check - The quantity of the bowls are good enough for two person, in that way it is pocket friendly. 

☺️Overall - Truly it is one of the  finest restaurant in Southern avenue. The restaurant  has a clean yet warm appearance. There, foods are just blessings. I must try and money worth restaurant 😍.

As it's reputation proceeds this restaurant provides good food along with subtle ambience and obliging services. We ordered siu mai, asian house special dumplings, barbecued chicken as an appetiser. Siu mai was best in the lot, the chicken and dumplings were excellent as well. 
 For our main course we ordered pork khowsuey, Vietnamese pho, mee gooreng, pad thai, asian sliced chicken in bok choy and wine sauce, moo pad kraprow. Each and every one of the dishes were excellent. My personal recommendations would be khowsuey and pad thai. Both hinted subtle sweetness. Mee gooreng is a spicy noodle. While Vietnamese pho is a bland but clear soupy noodle with burnt spice aroma. Chicken in wine sauce and moo pad krawprow, in comparison with other dishes not much extraordinary but definitely well made.i would be going back again soon.

In between the battle of big Asian Cuisine brands this small restaurant somehow wins the race by their Signature Bowl dishes. They recently updated their menu card with some authentic Indonesian, Chinese, Asian dishes & we were the lucky team to try them all.

Asian Cuisine has always been in craze, not because of the distinct flavour of it that everyone likes, also the way it is garnished and served makes our mouth watering. Asia house have done a brilliant work to deliver the best possible experience.

This place is actually very small, still very adorable. Simply with wooden baskets , wooden logs, paintings on white walls and filament bulbs creates an decent and comfortable ambiance. Sittings are comfortable too.

We started with...

Lemon Coriander Soup (4.75/5) :
----------------------------------
I must say this soup was excellent and one of the best I've tried in Asian cuisines. With fresh cut vegetables, small diced chicken pieces, floating coriander leaves and lime grass, this white soup looked very simple, until I took a sip of it. Very mild flavour of lime grass tasted just perfect that most of the restaurant overdone it. This soup is must for those looking for lite meal.

Now coming to the long waited Signature Bowls. Long waited in the sense, each of the these bowl takes near about 40-45 minutes to prepare. It takes time for sure but the result that comes is also superior.

A Chinese Lost In Burma (Pork Based) (4/5) :
----------------------------------------------
A bowl full of crispy fried chopsuey noodles dipped into red hot & sweet curry with floating pork dimsums in it & as final touch a pouched egg on top, believe me this bowl looked just amezing. Starting with the pork dimsums that just melted in the mouth with its wonderful taste and the hot & sweet curry with crispy noodles having its distinct flavour was nothing less than perfect. This dish gave us an idea of true Asian style signature dishes.

Vietnamese Pho (Seafood Based) (4/5) :
------------------------------------------
We were overwhelmed with the taste of Burma bowl & they surprised us with a mild flavoured bowl. This bowl was based on white gravy full of boiled seafoods, sprouts, carrot, onion, coriander, lime grass and Mei fun. This thin rice noodles dipped and boiled into white gravy tasted very natural. It was also served with another bowl of steamed rice mainly this dish was refreshing and tummy filling. Although Pho is mainly made of beef or chicken but this seafood variant didn’t taste bad either.

Indonesian Bakso (Chicken Based) (4.5/5) :
--------------------------------------------
Oddly named it was another red gravy bowl, this time with chicken dimsums and steamed rice. It tasted very authentic with the flavour of pepper and lime in it. Mixed with the rice this tasted sweet spicy and little tangy. It was another delicious bowl to love.

The House's Laksa (Fish Based) (4.5/5) :
------------------------------------------
Now this one was the best among all. Flat noodles and chopped fish was cooked into yellow coconut milk based gravy that had burned garlic, brownish fried onion and coriander in it. Coconut milk based gravy tasted just amazing with its own flavour. Just the flat noodles could have been cooked a little more.

Ho Chin Minh City Lunch Bowl (Lamb Based) (4/5) :
-----------------------------------------------------
The most hot and spicy bowl among all. Lamb cooked into this dark red gravy with steamed rice in it and green & red  chillies on top with an pouched egg, this one is perfect meal for hot & spicy food lovers. Lamb mixed with the rice was cooked brilliantly to love this bowl too.

After all this hot bowls a dessert was must & Darsaan was the way to go.

Darsaan with Ice Cream (4/5) :
--------------------------------
Crunchy and sweet darsaan with cold vanilla ice cream, best combination of all time after Asian cuisine.

Final Words :
--------------
Quality and quantity of every dish with its brilliant taste doesn’t give an option to complain over here. Pricing is also set to very reasonable. At the end of the day, this one is must recommended to everyone looking for a good set of meal options.

Asia House , in Southern Avenue is a nice , cozy little place that has made a reputation for serving authentic pan asian cuisine.
The quality of the food is excellent , whereas the quantity is more than enough.
The place is lightly decorated , while mild tibetan flute music is played in the background . Overall the ambiance here will provide a calm sensation , so that you can enjoy your food all the more.
Some dishes which we had are:-

>Lemon Coriander Soup- A bowl of hot steamy soup with chicken and a hint of lemon grass , works perfectly as an appetizer.

>A Chinese Lost In Burma- It’s crispy noodles with a spicy soup base . but that's not all.It also has pork filled momos. A dish that makes you more hungry just by looking at it .

>Vietnamese Pho- This is a noodle soup in white base , and filled with fish and prawn . The noodles are very fine and the soup base is light yet very tasty.

>Ho Chin Minh City Bowl - A bowl of fried rice served with hot spicy gravy which has superb and fine cooked lamb . A dish spicy enough to bring tears but also a dish that you can't stop craving.

>The House's Laksa- This was the showstopper . A bowl of flat noodles with fish fillets prepared on a base of coconut milk. Exploding with flavours , each spoon fill is going to make hungry for more . This was undoubtedly my fav dish there and will surely visit again to have a go at it.

>Indonesian Bakso - A noodle soup with 3 nice and juicy chicken dumplings. The taste is commendable .

>Darshan with Ice-cream- vanilla ice cream with golden fried crispy darsaan , was a perfect sweet end to the menu.

These are the signature bowls here , each bowl is prepared with time and care , so patience is imminent. But all the patience is repaid in double when you are greeted with such delicacies all to yourself.

As i said the quality and quantity are excellent here , the price well within grasp . so try out these dishes with your friends and family.

Whenever I crave for some authentic chinese cuisines, I think of Asia House. It is located near Southern Avenue. They serve Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Burmese, Singaporean dishes and Excels in all.
The decor is simple yet sofisticated with good music. The wall painting , wall hangings, DIY arts are interesting. The staffs are courteous and service is top grade.
Coming to the food, we had a Soup as a starter and five signature bowls which are Asia House special and a dessert to wrap ta story!

🎆 Lemon Coriander Soup- The soup was very delicious with ample amount of chicken and hint of lemon grass in it. It was of perfect consistency and flavour.

🎆 A Chinese Lost In Burma- Crispy noodle with spicy soup that had juicy pork-filled momos in it and garnished with a sunny side-up egg. The pork filling in the momos was awesome. The heat of the soup along with the noodles was creating some hulabaloo inside my mouth.

🎆 Vietnamese Pho- Pho is a 'Noodle soup' served with lots of prawn and it is a signature sea-food dish. It is a comfort food for all fish lovers.

🎆 Ho Chin Minh City Bowl - Fried rice with spicy gravy and beautifully cooked lamb blew our mind. Well garnished fried egg was too good. Perfect amount of heat and soft meat was loved by all.

🎆 The House's Laksa- This was House's Favourite and is most wanted. Perfectly cooked flat noodles with fish fillets and rich gravy with lemongrass essence.

🎆 Indonesian Bakso - Noodle soup which had three soft dumplings with chicken filling. The flavourful chicken broth was finished in a jiffy.

🎆 Darshan with Ice-cream- Crispy Darshan with vanilla ice-cream was paradise for dessert lovers.

All the lunch bowls was slow-cooked so that the flavour could induce into each other. Their signature bowls are really worth a try specially The House's Laksa.

So they are here with their scrumptious Signature Menu launch for the upcoming Christmas festival. Me alongwith my foodie bloggers of Panchphoron went there to taste out the cuisines. And must say each and every dish is a bang on. They are serving cuisines from all over the world. Starting from Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian.. you will find a lots of variety up there. Every item is a wholesome meal. So in accordance with the quantity and quality and price this food joint will definitely win your heart. And yes they don't use Ajinamoto. That means it will not harm our health.
So guys lets jump on to their Signature Dishes-

■ HO CHI MINH CITY STYLE BOWL- Stir fried rice served with meat broth one poached egg. Basically on the spicy side. The broth is made of black pepper and the pork meat was extremelly juicy. The meal was very well prepared. The flavour of the broth will just pop into your mouth.

■ VIETNAMESE PHO- Traditional Vietnamese noodle soup consisted of broth, rice noodles, herbs like spring onion, basil and many other green vegetables. It consisted of Tofu and the Tofu was prepared really well. Served with steamed rice.

■ A CHINESE LOST IN BURMA- The dish is unique as its name only. Crispy noodles with lots of sweet and sour broth. The noodles consisted of dimsums and one sunny side up poached egg. The broth contained sliced pork which was really tender. A wholesome meal for 1.

■ CHEF'S LATE NIGHT BOWL- A perfect healthy meal. Consisted of stir fried rice. Served with poached egg and kung pao styled chicken balls. The chicken broth consisted of veggies like green and red bell pepper, corriander leaves. The broth was on the thicker side as it had cashew in it. Must try.

■ SPICY MALAYSIAN CURRY BOWL- The curry bowl is quite interesting. The chicken broth made of coconut milk and kaffir lime. Perfectly seasoned with fresh cream. Served with steamed rice and fried shallots on top of it. Looks wonderful.

■ INDONESIAN BAKSO- Bakso or baso is an Indonesian dish made of meatballs (Veg/Chicken/Pork) with tapioca flour. Basically served with rice and tangy broth on top of it. The seasoning was excellent and the meatball stuffing in dimsum with chilli and pepper was just mouth watering.

■ BANGKOK CHILLY BASIL BOWL- Steamed rice served on a bed of chilly basil chicken broth with sunny side up. The chicken was soft ans succlucent. Broth had that tanginess into it. Garnished with corriander leaves. Again a wholesome meal.

ASIA HOUSE...newest addition to the list of my favourite Asian delicacies. The place is very simple and subtle with minimalistic decors, still had a touch of authenticity in it. The Owner alongwith all the staffs are very courteous. They described us about their dishes..how it has been prepared.
So they are here with their scrumptious Signature Menu launch for the upcoming Christmas festival. Me alongwith my foodie bloggers of Panchphoron went there to taste out the cuisines. And must say each and every dish is a bang on. They are serving cuisines from all over the world. Starting from Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian.. you will find a lots of variety up there. Every item is a wholesome meal. So in accordance with the quantity and quality and price this food joint will definitely win your heart. And yes they don't use Ajinamoto. That means it will not harm our health.
So guys lets jump on to their Signature Dishes-

■ HO CHI MINH CITY STYLE BOWL- Stir fried rice served with meat broth one poached egg. Basically on the spicy side. The broth is made of black pepper and the pork meat was extremelly juicy. The meal was very well prepared. The flavour of the broth will just pop into your mouth.

■ VIETNAMESE PHO- Traditional Vietnamese noodle soup consisted of broth, rice noodles, herbs like spring onion, basil and many other green vegetables. It consisted of Tofu and the Tofu was prepared really well. Served with steamed rice.

■ A CHINESE LOST IN BURMA- The dish is unique as its name only. Crispy noodles with lots of sweet and sour broth. The noodles consisted of dimsums and one sunny side up poached egg. The broth contained sliced pork which was really tender. A wholesome meal for 1.

■ CHEF'S LATE NIGHT BOWL- A perfect healthy meal. Consisted of stir fried rice. Served with poached egg and kung pao styled chicken balls. The chicken broth consisted of veggies like green and red bell pepper, corriander leaves. The broth was on the thicker side as it had cashew in it. Must try.

■ SPICY MALAYSIAN CURRY BOWL- The curry bowl is quite interesting. The chicken broth made of coconut milk and kaffir lime. Perfectly seasoned with fresh cream. Served with steamed rice and fried shallots on top of it. Looks wonderful.

■ INDONESIAN BAKSO- Bakso or baso is an Indonesian dish made of meatballs (Veg/Chicken/Pork) with tapioca flour. Basically served with rice and tangy broth on top of it. The seasoning was excellent and the meatball stuffing in dimsum with chilli and pepper was just mouth watering.

■ BANGKOK CHILLY BASIL BOWL- Steamed rice served on a bed of chilly basil chicken broth with sunny side up. The chicken was soft ans succlucent. Broth had that tanginess into it. Garnished with corriander leaves. Again a wholesome meal.

■ INDONESIAN GORENG BOWL- Indonesian stir fried rice with meat, vegetables and spices. The meal consisted of Chicken Satay, one sunny side up. Served with peanut sauce. Seasoned with sweet soy sauce. Must try.

Asia House is one of the authentic Chinese restaurant  which does not use Ajinomoto in their dishes making it  good for consumption. To find this restaurant you have to enter the lane keeping Jugals on your right and walk straight leading towards the Lake View Road and on your right side it is.

The ambiance is very calm and quiet with designs and paintings  making it simple yet eye catchy.

A warm and cozy place to enjoy with your people and eat their delicious food.

The service is fast and good.

The food we ordered was :

LEMON CORIANDER SOUP (CHICKEN)

  This soup was very refreshing and soothing as it contained small pieces of chicken and and fresh vegetables with lime and coriander. A must have for all seasons as the ingredients present in them will always make you want more of it.

 A CHINESE LOST IN BURMA ! (PORK)

 This dish is contains dimsums which are stuffed with pork and was soft and delicious.The curry was hot and sweet  giving it a different twist to the taste by the presence of friend noodles in it, and topped with an egg poach.A crunchy and soupy taste with chopped porks in it with a hot and sweet taste would definitely win your hearts.

VIETNAMESE PHO(SEAFOOD)

 This is the traditional rice noodles which are fine thin noodles which are mixed in a soup where there are bean sprouts ,spring onions,,red onions,coriander,lime and chillies .It was a sweet one and refreshing too.There was steamed rice served with it.

INDONESIAN BAKSO(CHICKEN)

 This contained chicken dimsums and sweet and spicy broth with chopped chicken and also pepper and lime was present in it served with steamed rice. Tastes  delicious and authentic Indonesian street foods’ taste.

THE HOUSE’S LAKSA(FISH)

 This a must try for all as it contains steamed  flat noodles with chopped fish into a curry which contains burnt garlic coriander making it a sweet and little bit spicy .The curry is made out of coconut milk and has the taste and smell of it giving it more reasons to dig in.

HO CHIN MINH CITY LUNCH BOWL(LAMB)

 This dish was the spicy one due to the presence of black peppers into it but a curry with chopped lamb and a bed of red chilli rice thus  making it a spicy one and ,topped with fried egg.

Even though its spicy but great in taste .You might end up in tears but might not like to share the food.

 Of course we all love the simple vanilla ice cream served with darsaan, giving it a crunchy sweet and cold sensation.

The price is affordable and quantity is really good thus it satisfies our heart ,our pockets and also our tummy. Do try these dishes and also the other ones present .A good family restaurant .A must visit for all.

Ordered in last night and was shocked to find a cockroach in the burnt ginger capsicum fried rice. (Please see images) I've eaten at Asia House a couple of times and absolutely love the food. Did not expect this from a place which serves one of the best Oriental in the city today. As a restaurant it's a cute little tidy place, but clearly the kitchen hygiene is not up to standard. Serving roaches in the food is just not acceptable. Had recommended this place to a number of people, but after last night's experience I'd strongly say think twice before eating from a place that is okay not maintaining its kitchen hygiene and serving cockroaches in the food.

Was thinking to visit this place for a long time, atlast got the opportunity.
It is an awesome restaurant the food, the decor, the waiters all on point..
Its just a 5mins walk from the jugals sweet shop towards the southern avenue via the lake road..
The dishes we ordered are:
●khao pad kratiem(mixed)- it was a rice loaded with prawn chicken nd egg and beautifully cooked with masala and exotic herbs. Its a self sufficient dish.
●roasted pork in black pepper sauce- it was cooked deliciously kind of must try of the restaurant.
● sliced chicken with asian bok choy in chilly wine sauce- the chicken! So nicely cooked that it almost melted in our mouth.

It is quite pocket friendly restaurant. The above 3 dishes would serve 2 with good appetite.they serve quite a lot.. and the waiters r good friendly nd helpful.
Overall a must visit restaurant..

If you are in Kolkata and wanted to taste some delicious pan Asian cuisine then there is one good place in southern avenue which can surely fulfill your desire – ‘ASIA HOUSE’. This is truly a unique restaurant where you can find not only some great Chinese food but also you can find dishes ranging from Indonesian to Vietnamese to Malaysian cuisine and lots more. The interiors are very smartly decorated with red and black themed seating arrangements and beautiful artwork and sculptures hanging on the wall to give it a vintage Asian look which is really commendable. Recently they launched some of their Signature Bowls and invited #TeamPanchPhoron for this event. The concept is really cool and each dish or I can say each bowl has its own identity and something to tell about the cuisine. The Signature Bowls which were there are as follows : Bangkok Chilli Basil Bowl, Chef’s Late Night Bowl, Spicy Malaysian Curry Bowl, Vietnamese Pho, Indonesian Bakso, A Chinese Lost in Burma, Indonesian Goreng Bowl and Ho Chin Minh City Lunch Bowl.
                                          ...

Most of the dishes are awesome and mouthwatering. If you like spicy south east Asian  countries food - go for it. Check rice or noodles or side dishes in favourite section / most sold section. Each portion are very generous and difficult to finish by one person. Great food & great service (home delivery). Keep going...all the best.

There are very few places which specialises in a particular cuisine & masters it, Asia House is amongst one of them and its the oriental cuisine which they have truly mastered. #Teampanchphoron went to try their new signature bowls which made every member of the group fight for the scrumptious dishes they served. A total of 8 bowls were served which include:
•Bangkok chilli basil bowl
•Chef's late night bowl
•Spicy Malaysian curry bowl
•Vietnamese Pho
•Indonesian Bakso
•A Chinese lost in Burma
•Indonesian goreng bowl
•Ho Chin Minh city lunch bowl
Among these spicy malaysian, indonesian bakso & goreng bowl were my personal favourite & are recommended. The dishes were pleasant to the eyes and was equally tasted good.
Do give a visit this winter to indulge yourself into the array of some beautiful bowl dishes inspired from all over Asia.
P.S.: Try their fried ice-cream which is also one of a kind.

I had ordered in from this place a while back. Chef's special chicken and pork dumplings, Vietnamese Pho and Nasi Goreng rice. The dumplings were excellent.. soft, succulent and juicy, and the Chef's special sauce was yummy as well. The Vietnamese Pho was delicious, fragrant and light. The Nasi Goreng was good, but I have had better versions of the dish. Their was a slight problem with the bill, the restaurant had charged me less whole Zomato had charged me more, but that was rectified soon enough. Overall, delicious, and I can't wait to go and check out the restaurant.

Asia house has a beautiful ambience. Maybe it's the minimalistic yet pretty decor or the absolutely fantastic music or both. The waiters are very efficient . We ordered lemon garlic soup and a coriander soup both chicken and a pepper chicken. All 3 were wonderful, though I feel the lemon garlic soup could use a little more lemon flavour. For main course we order 2 pan fried noodles and a fish the name of which i dont remember , both the items tasted great, i dont remember the name of the fish but it has a light sweet taste, people who dont like spicy food can definitely try this fish since its really tasty. We ordered 2 fresh lime sodas along with All this. Our total bill was 1700 and this food was perfect for 4 people. So pretty reasonable✔✔

This is another time I am writing a review on Asian House. This time we ordered soup and Jiangs pan fried chicken. This was appearing in starter. We usually see all staters as dry  ( to the best of my knowledge) . But this not fried properly and with gravy. This was disappointing. If I was having food in the resturant then surely I would requested to change the dish.

I took a home delivery for today's dinner from Asia House.This is located at southern avenue,exactly beside the Raymond's shop.I don't have any idea about  interior but the food speaks up a lot.I ordered
●mixed Hot basil fried rice
●Sliced chicken with celery and wine
●Prawns in Chef's secret sauce
Coming to the first one,the quantity of the rice was sufficient and the taste was good,not so spicy.
Sliced chicken served with wine,celery and garlic sauce seemed a mouth-watering dish to me before ordering.The smell of wine properly mixed with the sauce was delicious but the chicken pieces disappointed me.The sliced chicken turned out to be shredded and a mismatch with the sauce.The prawn was the best among all.It is a li'l bit spicy but didn't matter at all as the prawn made up the whole dish so  yummy.
A li'l pricey but foodies, if u want to experience different cuisines and seafood,you must visit this place.

The menu provided plenty of choices from dishes of all around the asia'n region which included speaciality dishes from singapore,Thai,chinese,indonesian and japanese cuisine,we decided to order "Crispy Babycorn with Kafir Lime in Thai sweet chilli" which cost us Rs 230/. To be honest the dish was ok babycorn where cut in small cube size 1inch each accurately making each of it exactly of same size cotted with conflour,deep fried and sauted with Kafir lime juice along with sweet chilly sauce.The taste of sweetness along with a tang of sourness of lime made dish a bit different from the others,where as it was crispy outside and soft and juicy inside which gave a deadly combination,the only thing which could be done to make the dish better was adding onions and capsicum along with some garlic or else it was ok, i would rate it 4/5. After the starter we decided to go for "NASI GORENG"(Indonesian rice) this was amazing really served in ample quantity,rice well cooked,mixed with different kinds of vegetables,which included Green capsicum,red & yellow pepper,cabbage,brocoli,fresh mushrooms and many more making the dish colourfull and healthy, a bit spicy not much ideal for me, i would rate it 4.5/5.
Along with NASI GORENG we ordered "SINGAPORE RICE NOODLE"(Rice noodle tossed with singapore curry sauce) a speaciality dish of Singapore.
Noodles where as fine and thin as sewai (seva english term) not much spicy but decently cooked along with different vegetable in it,overall okay i will rate 3.5/5 it cost us Rs 205/. For accompaniment along with these two dish we ordered "Babycorn & Mushroom in Chilli Garlic Sauce" this dish was fab with lot of gravy and ample amount of half cooked vegetables like capsicum and onion which made it more crispier, it cost us 240/ bugs which was value for money 4/5. The service personal "Joydeep" was so courteous that i have no words to explain taking care of his customer as his own guest very polite humble,and of caring nature i will definietly suggest you guys to go out and try this restaurant if one has interest @ Authentic Asian Food! :)

This Pan Asian joint located in Lake view road, have garnered a good reputation serving Asian delicacies.

AMBIENCE - This place is neatly done with dim lighting, Chinese characters drawn on the walls, bulbs hanging from the ceiling gives a cozy feeling, nothing fancy though. 

FOOD - We have tried Shanghai Hawker's Soup, Takrai Chicken, Coriander & Burnt Ginger mixed rice, Nasi Goreng, Roasted Pork, Sliced Chicken with Asian Bok Choy in Chilli Wine Sauce. The soup is very light & loaded with meat, prawn, tofu, mushroom. Nasi Goreng tastes amazing with Sliced chicken with asian bok choy in chilli wine sauce. The Roasted pork is also mention worthy.

SERVICE - The staffs are courteous & they know there menu inside out. If confused ask them for suggestions, you wont regret.

POCKET PINCH- 900-1000 for two.

Another of Southern Avenue’s newly opened gems.

Location and parking:

Located beside the Raymond showroom on Lake View road, which is just adjacent to Lake Kalibari,it is an easy find by Google Maps. Paid parking is available on the road on the opposite side of the restaurant.

Ambiance :

It is located on the ground floor of a residential building and decorated in a rustic manner with both sofas and chairs for sitting. They have a spacious, clean washroom at their premises too.

Food:

Went in for a weekday lunch and ordered the following-

Asia House special dumplings(Pork)- 6 pieces of dumplings bathed in soy and mushroom sauce. The skin of the dumplings was thin and there was a decent amount juicy pork stuffing inside.

Mixed Vietnamese Pho-
This is from their ‘Signature Bowls’ part of the menu.A light broth with overtones of kaffir lime and lemongrass flavours,containing rice noodles(Banh Pho),chicken,shrimps,tofu,bok choy and other veggies.It was accompanied by a bowl of normal rice (not the usual short grain sticky rice that they serve in SE Asia). The dish can be called a full balanced meal by itself. However spice lovers should think twice before ordering this,as the flavours are subtle and trying to add sauces,etc to spice up the concoction will overpower the real flavour of the dish easily.

Crab Kraprow-
Two medium sized whole crabs(with claws) tossed in dark chilly-garlic sauce with hints of lemongrass. The sauce adds a balanced zing to the sweetness of the crab meat.

Asian Barbequed Prawn-
8-10 medium sized prawns with onions and three coloured bell peppers in a light and balanced bbq sauce which wasn’t overly sweet and sticky. The prawns were fresh and grilled just right.

Service:

Special mention to the gentleman who attended us, for being very helpful in the ordering process(completely forgot to ask his name though). The rest of the staff was very courteous too.

Will definitely be back to try out their other specialties.

And due to smelly shrimps they home delivered another pad thai noodles and dumplings free of cost the next day !! Kudos to the owner ,highly appreciated !!

My friend and i went for lunch during the durga pujas.
The interior is decorately quite graciously.  Had Chili garlic noodles and Bali street vendors pork. Tried chili garlic noodles for the first time. Loved it. The noodles cooked beautifully, the intensity of the spicyness was quite good. It was not too spicy. Non-spicy lovere can try this for sure. Coming to the pork, it was soft and beautifull. The pork was just heaven. Best pork i've had till date. Pork lovers dont miss this one. Will come again with my family to try their other dishes😁

Beware.. call them and ask if they could arrange space for you.. or whether it is open for public or not.. I booked a cab and went there having shopping bags with me in my hands..  the guy there didn't even let me enter and told me that it's closed (may be because  some party was going on over there.. i guess.. as a couple was welcomed to come in while i was standing there..)
A representative could have come out and discussed the matter with us.. it would not have been this disappointing then..

Visited this place last week ,located on southern avenue, this is quite a place !!
Decor is simple and singing to the theme of the food... ASIAN.

The menu for the day was
Vietnamese Pho(chicken)
A delicious soup. Nothing is more comforting than a bowl of pho. Rice noodles were beautifully cooked and the hint of lemon grass was very tasteful!

Lat Me Kai (chicken)
A stir fried dish of chicken with a strong essence of soya and chilli oil, probably!

Takrai (fish)
Another stir fried dish of basil scented fish. This was the star of the entire course for me. Delicately cooked, the fish screamed of the basil flavor!

Chicken with pok choy in Chilli Wine Sauce
A nice sauced up dish of chicken in wine sauce. The sauce was a genius, mixing Asian spices into wine was clever and delectable at the same time.

Tausi (fish)
On a spicy side, this dish was stirred up with black beans and mushroom which gave it a slight bitter taste. Very unique and yummy!

Burnt garlic capsicum Fried Rice
it was a great accompaniment to all the above dishes as the burnt garlic and capsicum went very well .

Egg Hakka Noodles
Stir fried noodles with scallions and eggs! Nothing can go wrong with scallions and eggs and delicious wheat noodles!

Darshaan with Ice Cream
The fried sesame coated Wonton sheets were amazing with the ice cream.

On a whole, a great experience.
Budget friendly and easily located, this place should be a bucket list visit.

Thanks guys.
Cheers!

Located on lake view road opposite to Ashoka building this place gives a decent view from outside. The place is nice but nothing extra ordinary. Decent and average decor which has a capacity of around 30-35 people. The prices are pretty reasonable and the quantity and also pretty good. Each chicken dish has like 10 pieces. For starters the lat ma kai chicken is nice and so are their Momos. The coriander and burnt garlic rice is pretty nice and so is there pad Thai. Only thing was was not that good is their laksa. The lemongrass was still a bit raw and the quantity too which they have written serves for 2 is very less compared to the other dishes. More or less satisfactory experience and won't burn a hole in your pocket.

We had Chicken Takrai, General Tao's favourite chicken, Laksa and Darsaan. 
Laksa, in particular, was out of this world. Such was it's depth of taste and flavour, we were mesmerised.

This place was suggested by one of my friends for my birthday treat. So we had been there last Saturday & since then its my new favourite asian restaurant. With the warm & cozy ambience,it serves some lip smacking great food at reasonable price. Staffs are very generous & helpful. service is good too. So we ordered keong's sweet & spicy chicken, konjee crispy chicken & crispy garlic pepper chicken for the starter. Though every item was delicious still my favourite one was the crispy garlic pepper chicken. For the main course we ordered mixed khao pad kratiem, mixed fried rice, kung pao chicken & xao sa ot. Both the chicken sides were unique in their own way. While kung pao chicken tastes great with mixed fried rice, xao sa ot had unique lemon aroma & flavor & it compliments Khao pad kratiem very well. Last but not the least for the dessert we had chocolate sundae.

Asia House is a small Asian food joint located at Lake view Road which serves Great Asian Food at a very reasonable price and which is very exquisite in taste. Asia House gives us the opportunity to taste different flavours of food from different parts of Asia. I have never tasted food like that before and it has very interesting names too. 😋

LOCATION- Located at lake view road besides Raymond's and its a few minutes walking distance from Lake Kalibari and Jugals as well. 

AMBIENCE- The place is quite well lit and attracts natural lighting. It is a very decent place which accommodates quite a fair no. Of people. The Decor and The Wall hangings are very gorgeous and grabs every bit of attention. Seating arrangements are also top notch. I am seriously impressed. 

STAFF- The people working here are very helpful and generous. They are very well mannered and everyone among the staff has a very friendly nature. 

FOOD- Looking through their menu I found the name of the dishes very intriguing and interesting. Some of them seemed familiar and some of them didn't. So I thought of experimenting.
It has been quite a long time since I ordered a soup at a restaurant . So that day I decided to try one. I ordered CHICKEN VIETNAMESE PHO. It is a traditional Vietnamese soup made with Rice noodles. The soup also had many veggies like red onion,spring onion,basil, etc. It tastes very good. 
For starters I ordered LAT ME KAI and TAKRAI
LAT ME KAI basically is made with either Chicken/Fish/Prawn. I ordered the one made with Chicken. It was made with white wine and other spices and garnished with spring onions. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I liked the taste of it very much. 
TAKRAI also comes with options like Chicken/Fish/ Prawn. I ordered the Fish. It is Thai dish. It was soft and delicious. 
For the mains I ordered-
SLICED CHICKEN WITH ASIA BOK CHOY IN CHILLI WINE SAUCE, TAUSI FISH, BURNT GINGER CAPSICUM CHICKEN FRIED RICE and EGG HAKKA NOODLES.
The SLICED CHICKEN WITH ASIA BOK CHOY IN CHILLI WINE SAUCE consisted of chicken pieces tossed with asia bok choy and flavoured with chilies and chinese cooking wine. The chicken in particular was soft and tender. And the dish in whole was truly great. 
Next its TAUSI FISH. Tausi fish is basically thinly sliced fish which is marinated and then pan fried with mushrooms tossed in black bean sauce. The fish was very soft and tender and the black beans added a very interesting flavour to the whole dish.
The BURNT GINGER CAPSICUM CHICKEN FRIED RICE was so good. After a bad mixed fried rice fiasco I had a few days back this tasted like heaven to me. The rice was light and not heavy and exquisitely made. 
The EGG HAKKA NOODLES also tastes very nice and the price is also very reasonable considering the amount of noodles given. Its more than enough for two people. 
Finally after being full from so many things it  was time for the desserts. For desserts I ordered DARSAAN WITH ICE CREAM. Darsaan is generally deep fried flour strips tossed in a burnt honey sauce and finished with sesame seeds. I honestly never even heard of darsaan and I was trying it the first time. For people who never ever had Darsaan trust me this particular dessert tastes like heaven. Truly. And it pairs greatly with scoops of vanilla ice cream. 
The whole lunch was worthwhile.

To conclude ASIA House provides a wide variety of dishes which is found in different parts of Asia under one roof. So if anybody gets bored with having biriyani ( which am sure doesn't happen) then make sure to check this place out. Its a hidden gem. 

P.s. - Their special spicy sauce is to die for. Tastes great with noodles. 
CIAO ❤️

Sorry for being really late on this review.

Went there almost 2 months ago with my family and one of my friend and his wife for a dinner. So lets take a walk through my experience.

Ambiance : -------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Small and cozy. That day they had some problem with their AC and water was dropping from that AC unit on my friend. So we had to tell them to turn it off. They turned it off immediately but after few minutes someone started it again, probably because of not enough air circulation inside. In my personal opinion, the restaurant should have some more lights. 

Food : --------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We ordered...
Chicken Sweet Corn Soup

Hot and Sour Soup

Roasted Pork with Black Pepper and Bok Choy

Roasted Pork in Sweet and Sour Sauce

Mixed Coriander and Burnt Garlic Fried Rice

Chili Garlic Noodles

The Chicken Sweet Corn Soup was nice. The Hot and Sour Soup was not at all hot. My friend ordered that, because he likes spicy and hot, but it was not hot according to him. Both the Roasted Pork dishes were fantastic along with Fried Rice. Same thing happened with my friend with Chili Garlic Noodles, it was not hot according to him. But I think that was totally his personal taste issue.
In my opinion food were great. 

(I can't eat hot food ... ha ha ha ... totally ok with no hot taste in Hot and Sour Soup) :P

Staff : -------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice behavior. Our order took quite a long time to come. But I cannot blame the service staffs for that. I seen lot of online food orders from companies like Swiggy,Zomato were there and they were finishing up those orders first before our order. So it took time to prepare our order.

Price : ----
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Price was reasonable. No problem at all.

Overall Experience : ----

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My overall experience was quite nice. I would highly recommend Asia House to Asian Food Loving people. I'll go back there again for sure. Keep it up Asia House.

Asian Street Food at its Best.

Located a few hundred feets from Golpark,stood this Semi-Exotic Typical Asian Eatery.Basically 10mins walk from Golpark towards the Lake View Road.
The neat Decor is worth appreciating. 25 to 30 people can easily accomodate. Soft and Soothing Music adds to the restaurants good Ambience.

Visited Yesterday with my fellow mates for a Brunch.
The menu that we decided were.....

🤘Chicken Vietnamese Pho
An exotic soup,loaded with minced chicken and veggies.Had a tinge of Sour and Spicy with Meifoon in the soup.Innovative and Refreshing as an apetiser.
🤘Chicken Lat Me Kai
Started the proceedings with some Glamorous crispy Chicken cubes sauted with pepper salt.
🤘Fish Takrai
Tender Fish Slices pan fried with veggies in an exotic Thai Sauce comprising of Lime Juice,Fish Sauce and Sugar.Served with Lemon Grass.Standsout.

🤘Slice chicken with Asian Pak Choi in Chilli Wine Sauce
An authentic Chinese dish with a basic White Gravy.

🤘Fish Tausi
A Chinese Gravy dish,with slice peices of Fish,veggies and Tausi(visual of black beans).Salt and Chilly Flakes were visibly noted.

🤘Burnt Ginger capsicum Fried Rice (chicken)
Had a Brilliant Aroma,MSG free.Yet tasted so good.

🤘Egg Hakka Noodles
Unique flavour was noticeable.Quantity is enough for 2.

😍Darshan with Ice Cream
Slice of Vanilla Ice Cream served on top of Honey Glazed Darshan.

Reasonable Pricing,Enough Quantity with Great Quality,Upto the mark Service,Courteous Behaviour and Brilliant Food.These qualities altogether makes this Asian Dining Destination a must visit for all.

A place which houses authentic oriental cuisine - does full justice to it's name. Located on the lake view road, this cute little Asian food joint has been stirring up a storm with not just food, but also their rather impressive service. The place is neatly decorated with wall art, dimly lit lamps hanging from the ceiling - making the ambience look picturesque all the more. Coming to the food, all the items I tried were well made, true to the taste with perfect balance of flavours and generous portion sizes. So my recent visit here was literally a feast :

Appetizer :

•Vietnamese Pho (chicken) >> a light soup with perfectly cooked rice noodles and chunks of chicken was a delight to start the meal. A dash of lemon & coriander added that extra flavour. (4.5/5)

Starters :

•Lat Me Kai (chicken) >> Cubes of chicken, deep fried and well coated with sweet & spicy sauce. (4/5)

•Takrai (fish) >> The winner of the meal, soft and juicy fish stir fried with veggies, in a keffir lime based sauce. Simply loved it. (5/5)

In the Mains :

•Sliced chicken in Asian Bokchoy in Chilli Wine Sauce : With a white wine base, this mild and sweet flavoured chicken seemed quite soothing to the taste buds. (4/5)

•Tausi (fish) : With a distinct aroma of black beans and red wine, this again was a winner. Soft fish well made with a light sauce, complimented the rice/noodles very well. (5/5)

•Burnt Ginger capsicum Fried Rice (chicken) >> Right balance of burnt ginger and stir fried rice, this one was true to the taste. (5/5)

•Egg Hakka Noodles >> An all time favourite, this was well made. (4/5)

Dessert :
•Darshan with Ice Cream >> No meal's complete without some Vanilla Ice cream and deep fried darshan. Ordered this on repeat, it was that good. (5/5)

To sum it up, it was indeed a great lunch. Will visit again!😍

South East Asian delicacies is fast becoming one of the most sorted after cuisine in the city.People are ready to experiment when it comes to food.As a result new chains are cropping up serving authentic dishes from Thailand,Singapore and Indonesia.One such gem of a place on a quite lane in Southern Avenue is Asia House.

The decor is simple ,neat with a hint of red here and there.The food is absolutely mind-blowing.On my plate I had

🍁Vietnamese Pho(chicken)--Light flavours of bean sprouts,lime,basil and a hit of chilli hits your palate as soon as you take a spoonful.The soup had chicken cubes ,paper thin rice noodles topped with egg drop.Just what warm comfort food is all about.

🍁Lat Me Kai  (chicken)--Chicken tossed with different spices and topped with cooking wine and spring onions make for a delicious starter

🍁Takrai  (fish)--The fish was soft and spiced up with blast of flavours coming from the bird's eye chilli ,lemon grass and coriander as soon as you taste them.

🍁Slice chicken in Asian Bok choy in Chilli Wine Sauce--This dish deserves a special​ mention because of the huge burst of flavours that it had.Slices of chicken and bok choy in a white transparent gravy finished with chinese cooking wine.The wine flavour shines throughout the dish as a hero.

🍁Tausi (fish)--The fish is marinated and then tossed with mushroom in a black bean sauce.The unusual combination of mushroom with fish makes an impact.


🍁Burnt Ginger capsicum Fried Rice (chicken)--Chicken fried rice flavoured in burnt chinese ginger and sprinkled with spring onions.Pair this one with the sliced chicken in wine sauce and loved every bit.


🍁Egg Hakka Noodles--Simple spicy egg hakka noodles.I paired this one with the Tausi fish and its a definite recommendation for all.


🍁Darshaan with Ice Cream--Caramelised darsaan tossed in sesame seeds served with scoops of vanilla ice cream and its a wrap

Asian flavours is not only about chilli sauce and Asia house has explored all sides of asian cuisine.Flavours so extraordinary should be celebrated.Kudos to team Asia house for contributing to the city's list of flavour den.

Asia House is a bright addition in the restaurants of Kolkata serving Asian foods, beyond Chinese cuisine. We went there for a weekday lunch. We started our meal with nicely-made chicken lime coriander soup. For main course, our selection was set combo meal. I went for "saigon lion" which served Vietnamese pho (lemongrass flavored clear broth with diced chicken, rice noodles and bean sprouts) and rice paper roll (transparent rice paper roll stuffed with rice noodles and veg julienne). I Tasted pho and rice paper roll before in Texas and I liked both the items quite well. Having said that, at Asia House, both these items were made to perfection and tasted awesome. My other colleagues opted for "Bo bo Bali", a combo of nasi goreng with two skewers of chicken satay and all of them liked the combo. All the combos were served with brownie and ice-cream, which marked a happy note to our lovely lunch. We will love to visit the place again.

So there is a new addition to the list of my favorite Asian restaurants, Asia House. Sumptuous food made with attention to detail and is AjinaMoto free. So that's something which makes this place rather unique for me. I have been there before and loved everything I ate. There are quite a few dishes which stole my heart away once again when I had gone for a group lunch yesterday with my foodie friends. Here's what we ordered :
😍 Starters:
1.Vietnamese Chicken Pho ( a soup with rice noodles) 
2. Lat Me Kai
3. Takrai Fish
4. Roast Chilli Pork 
5. Asia House Special Dumplings 
😍Main Course:
1. Sliced Chicken in Asian Bok Choy cooked in Chilly Wine sauce
2. Tausi Fish
3. Asian Barbequed Fish
4. Egg Hakka Noodles
5. Burnt Ginger Capsicum Chicken Fried Rice
We also had Fresh Lime Sodas as an accompaniment  and Darsan with Vanilla icecream to finish off our beautiful culinary experience. 
Each and every item has something unique to offer,  be it the Takrai fish which had this subtle lemongrass flavor which I loved, to the Roast Chilli Pork which I probably can live on for days. All the items mentioned above are highly recommended if you haven't tasted them yet. The service of staff was prompt and the ambience of the place quite nice. Will definitely come back for more.

It was my first visit in Asia house.loved every thing about this place. Asian food ain’t about simplicity. It’s about the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish.so today our menu was.these

Soup- • Vietnamese Pho(chicken)
this is a simple noodle soup.The way all the spices and flavors come together is incredible.

Apetizer •
Lat Me Kai (chicken) - Deep fried chicken cube tossed with spicy sauces.

Takrai (fish)-its pan fried fish slices with Thai and fish sauce.

Chicken dish was ordinary but fish took its place on a good note.

Main course-

•Slice chicken in Asian Boc chow in Chilli Wine Sauce-
An authentic dish of China. Served with simple white gravy.

• Tausi (fish)- it's a Chinese gravy dish which includes some veggies and black beans.

• Burnt Ginger capsicum Fried Rice - this chicken fried rice is flavoured with burnt ginger.

• Egg Hakka Noodles- spicy and unique flavoured noodle.tested so well.

• Roasted chilly pork- roasted pork cube,well tossed with sauces.best chilly pork I ever had.

These dishes were extremely delicious.it was enough to please my taste buds.every thing was perfectly cooked, flavoured and spicy.the special attraction was roasted chilly pork, which was cooked extremely well.combination of chilly pork and haka noodle will be the best recommendation.

Dessert- • Darshaan with Ice Cream
Sliced vanilla ice cream with darshan garnished with honey and seasem seeds.these one was the cherry on the cake.

The service was excellent.All staffs are friendly. A senior attendent who's name is Jayanta Mukherjee, he is so prompt and he maintains the professionalsim of hospitality in a best way.

Overall it's worth to rate them 5.0
Keep serveing like this.All the best to Asia house team.

As I was free today so I went to this Chinese restaurant named Asia house which is 10 to 15mins away from my place where I live. The decor inside the restaurant was simple and subtle the ambience was nice .Now comes the food and service.The service was really they greeted me nicely.
I started of my lunch with a soup named
Vietnamese pho which is a chicken soup with rice noodles in it.
Then after that it was the starters in which there was two types 
Lat me Kai which is chicken preparation 
Takrai it was a fish starter Both the dishes were good but according me takrai was my favorite . 
After this then came the main course which includes :
•Burnt Ginger capsicum chicken fried rice
•Slice chicken with Asian pok choy in chili wine sauce which tastes damn good.
•Tausi fish
•Egg Hakka noodles.
At last but not the least darshan  with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top.

A quaint little restaurant off southern avenue. This place has quickly made a reputation for serving Lip-smacking Asian fare. The place is done up well. Ambience is good too. Coming to the food, while the khawsuey on my first visit was a disappointment (too much coconut for my liking) the next visits have been outstanding. Have tried the takrai chicken, nasi goreng, shanghai hawker's soup, roast chilli pork etc. Each one of them was delicious. A special mention must be made of the staff here. They are very attentive and knowledgeable and in case you are confused about what to order,you can always ask them for recommendations.

We were their first customers on a Tuesday afternoon. So naturally the place was empty and we got to chose our favourite cosiest spot without any hassles!! We were a group of 4. Went on recommendation from my friend's Friend. What caught my eye in the menu is that they mentioned "MSG free" meaning monosodium glutamate (ajinamoto) free. Such places are extremely rare where msg is not used because msg is a taste enhancer but very bad for health. Anyways, coming to the key points of this place:
1. Very close to lake kalibari. Infact a 10 minutes brisk walk from golpark would take you there(provided your GPS is on!! Otherwise you may get lost!!!!)
2. Décor: neat. No hanky panky. They've both sofas and chairs for seating. This place can easily fit 25-30 people at a time.
3. Ambience: nice music. Nothing much to say about it
4. Food: ordered Jiang's chili chicken for starters, Kung pao chicken, siagon mixed rice and meifoon for main course. The starter was delicious but it's quantity was less for 4. But the Kung pao chicken had 10 pieces of diced chicken, so that was sufficient for us. Needless to say that the mixed rice n noodles were more than enough for us.!! I never tasted meifoon before. It was my favourite dish!! Loved it totally. Such thin noodles!!! We couldn't finish all items so asked them to pack.
Bill was around 1200(a little less than 1200). 
Worth visiting again!!!

Food Quality: Good√
Food Quantity : More than enough for 2 persons√
Staff behaviour: Good√
Service: Slow×

Food tasted here:
Chicken Fried Wonton: size of the wontons are too small and very oily. Not satisfied with what they serve. So the starter we chose was not up to the mark.

Koong Gra Tiem: prawns cooked in thai garlic, black pepper,and basil sauce. Excellent in taste. Hot because of crushed black pepper, and a refreshing taste for basil leaves. Not oily, a simple dish to try with rice or noodles. Prawns are perfectly cooked, soft and succulent.

Nasi Goreng (Mixed): Indonesian Fried rice. Small grains of rice, little bit of spicy tossed with mushrooms, chunks of chicken and prawns. Crushed black pepper make it a little bit hot, chopped red chillies are also coupled with the pepper. One bowl of rice is more than enough for 2 people.

Fried IceCream: A scoop of vanilla IceCream rolled on coconut crush and deep fried and garnished with sesame seeds and chocolate sauce! I love the crunchy outer covering,full of coconut. A must try dish!

Had visited this place with a couple of friends a few days back.The ambience here was pretty good but i found it quite weird to find a lot of mosquitoes in here. Coming to the food , I had the chilli pork and pork dimsums for the starters which were pretty good.I loved the chilli pork though the slices could have been a bit slender.The garlic chiken and mixed fried rice were good.I found the size of the chicken pieces to be pretty small as compared to the price.The quantity of the food portions wasn't that much and I expected it to be a bit more for what they were charging us.I had chocolate brownie with ice cream and ice cream with pie for dessert.Both were good.Overall, thefood was satisfactory, staff were friendly and courteous, and service was prompt.

I went to Asia House with my family for my Pre-Birthday Dinner. It is located very close to Lake Kalibari. It's a small place with really nice DIY decor. The ambiance is great. Service was a little slow but the staff were really helpful. We had Starters and Desserts there and got the Main Course packed.
What We Ordered---
Soups & Starters:
Sweet Corn Soup (Chicken)
Manchow Soup (Chicken)
Crispy Babycorn Oriental Chilli
Crispy Chilli Mushroom
Jiang's Pan Fried Chilli Fish
Lat Me Kai Chicken
Konjee Crispy Lamb
Mocktail:
Fresh Lime Soda
Main Course:
Thai Chilli Basil Noodles (Chicken)
Hot Basil Fried Rice (Chicken)
Fried Rice (Mixed)
Chicken In Asian Barbequed Sauce
Xao Sa Ot Chicken
Desserts:
Ice Cream With Chocolate Sauce
Fried Ice Cream
Darsaan With Ice Cream
What We Liked & What We Didn't---
Almost every item we ordered for Starters were great. But the lamb was a little hard to chew. The Sweet Corn Chicken Soup was delicious. Among the Main Course items, I loved the Thai Chilli Basil Noodles. The flavour was really good. But we didn't like the rice dishes much. The Chicken Sides were pretty good. The Desserts were good, especially the Fried Ice Cream.
Pocket Pinch---
Our bill was around Rs. 3800..
Verdict---
It's a must visit if you are a fan of Asian Cuisine. We loved this place and will definitely return for more.

Asia House : the house full of great flavors and surprises. Being an oriental cuisine lover, I found another destination to add on my list. If you want to have Asian cuisine then definitely it is the place.. 
Location : Pocket friendly,  neat and clean,  well maintained small joint located near lake kalibari. Easy to locate. 
Food and services : service was awesome and quick. We had our lunch their on Sunday. We ordered Asian barbequed grilled chicken, capsicum and onion tossed with some barbeque sauce and great flavors..  Very tasty. Burnt garlic rice,  sliced fish in chef's secret sauce and fried ice cream.  I never had fried ice cream before..  Vanilla ice cream coated with coconut flavored batter and deeply fried served with chocolate sauce..  

Overall a great experience and I would surely go back and try another food and would recommended all foodies to come

😅😅Today My Dad Dropped Me To Navina Cinema, Tollygunge Prince Anwar Road To Watch The Film Ittefaq For Rs. 90/- Premium Stall From 12:00pm - 2:00pm.

Visited this place for the first time just yesterday. Lovely cozy ambience, very well behaved staff with a lot speard of menu over chinese & asian food. We ordered for Sui Mai, indonesian fried rice, pad thai noodles and Xao Sa Ot (fish) and all were awesome. Price is a bit high than mentioned in zomato (Around 1000 for two). But food qualtiy & quantity is very nice. Hope to visit it again.

Located near lake kalibari, lets find out what this Ajinamoto Free restaurant has to offer.

Ambience and decor: A small place with cozy seating. Sofa on one side and chairs on the other. Has basket lamp shades with rice lamps inside. Perfect for catching up with friends.

Staff: Takes care of the guests and makes sure to fill your glasses whenever its empty. A thumbs up for that.

Food: This is where things get seriously interesting. Ajinamoto free food! That itself is a big thumbs up. We had ordered barbecue lamb, saigon egg fried rice and mings special pork. The meat was super soft and bursting with flavors. The lamb was moist enough. The saigon rice had the nuttiness of the mushroom teamed with crunchy peanuts. The pork was not loaded with fat and had an amazing lemongrass flavor to it. The orange darshan was a bit of a let down as the darshan was not crispy and kind of soggy. Quantity and quality of food could rival most of the best known places of kolkata.

Overall : With a pocket pinch of 1500 for two(5 dishes), its pocket friendly and serves beautifully cooked meat with amazing flavors. A must try.

Asia House : the house full of great flavors and surprises. Being an oriental cuisine lover, I found another destination to add on my list. If you want to have Asian cuisine then definitely it is the place.. 
Location : Pocket friendly,  neat and clean,  well maintained small joint located near lake kalibari. Easy to locate. 
Food and services : service was awesome and quick. We had our lunch their on Sunday. We ordered Asian barbequed grilled chicken, capsicum and onion tossed with some barbeque sauce and great flavors..  Very tasty. Burnt garlic rice,  sliced fish in chef's secret sauce and fried ice cream.  I never had fried ice cream before..  Vanilla ice cream coated with coconut flavored batter and deeply fried served with chocolate sauce..  

Overall a great experience and I would surely go back and try another food and would recommended all foodies to come

And my love for Pan Asian Food finds another home. The not so new venture by the famous "China Wok, Hindustan Park" is an ideal eatery for people like me who always have a soft corner for Asian delicacies.  Located at Lake View Road, it can easily be located if you're a native else you always have your Google Map. 
The decor is quite simple potraying an allusion through Chinese characters, nothing fancy. Although the place is quite neat and scrupulous. 

Food we ordered : 

#Shangsi Crabmeat Soup
Thick and creamy soup with crabmeat and vegetables. - It had a very subtle taste, quite elementary but not at all bland. A great savoury to have in winter evenings. 

#Roasted Pork with black pepper and bok choy - This is one of their signature dish and they truely master it. The pork was tenderly cooked, soft and juicy from inside with the rightful amount of spicy heat from the black peppers and most importantly it had little to no
portion of fat in it. I absolutely loved each and every gulp from the salver. 

#Fried Icecream - Ice cream love is never too young nor too old. Like everything this frozen happiness has been styled and rejigged a lot. Ice cream that too fried is one of a kind. Although this dessert is now available everywhere, but this was my first encounter with this individual and guess what I was awed by the uniqueness. The creamy vanilla ice-cream with crunchy fried coating of coconut and cornflakes was ideally perfect to call the day off. 

Overall, a wonderful experience and would recommend all foodies out there to come and get overwhelmed by the variety they offer.

What an amazing experience. After having a terrible experience at their outlet and reviewing about the same, not only the owner personally contacted me, but I also had food delivered at my doorstep inspite of the fact that I live quite far away from their outlet. I am truly delighted by this gesture. Coming to the food, I really misjudged it at first. They send me spicy lemon burnt garlic soup, sui mai and pan tossed chicken with schezwan sauce, smoked chilies and peanuts. Packaging was perfect. The soup were scrumptious, very spicy indeed. The sui mai was surely the show stealer. The chicken dish was bursting with flavors. Everything was cooked to perfection. I would surely go back to the outlet to try other items.

Food was amazing. However, the waiters seem inexperienced and they mixed up 2 orders serving chicken to a pescetarian(those who only eat fish and no other meat). This was a grave error and it wasn't realised by us till it was already too late. Keeping that aside, experience with other dishes wasn't bad. Its a little on the costlier side.

Visited on Diwali night after seeing the high zomato ratings.
The evening was unfortunately marred by the agonisingly slow service even though the restaurant was half full at that time.
Starters took a good 40 minutes to arrive.
Overall food quality was nothing exceptional but not too bad either.
For two plates of ice cream with darshan ordered for dessert, again had to wait for another excruciating 30 minutes before they managed to rustle up one plate of the stuff. The second plate did not turn up even after 15 minutes. Finally had enough, paid the bill and left, lesson learnt never to trust a zomato rating again.

Asian cuisine includes several major regional cuisines: East Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian, Central Asian, and Middle Eastern. A cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions,usually associated with a specific culture. Asia, being the largest and most populous continent, is home to many cultures, manTy of which have their own characteristic cuisine. Ingredients common to many cultures in the East and Southeast regions of the continent. So, if you are looking for some Asian food then this is one of the few who have carving out a niche for themselves.

The small yet spacious restaurant which serves brilliant Asian cuisines, ASIA HOUSE, is situated just near the Raymonds outlet of southern avenue branch, more accurately near Lake Kali Bari..
Being here has cheered me up for another visit..
I will sum up my review in following points:-

Decor- Quite pretty.. Its a fusion of Old things with new techs, Like rice lights or tuni bulbs are attached to small little round baskets weaved with bamboo..

Space- Not very big enough though 25-30 people can seat comfortably.. The seats and sofas are very comfortable and relaxing.. There was some soft balladic english classic songs was being played setting a perfect ambience for lunch dates..

Service- The service is extremely good.. Once I tried to put the chicken piece from the big bowl to my plate(intentionally being a little slow), the server came hurriedly and asked if I needed any help for that, I acceded and he helped me with it.. Each and every dish was hot and quick..

Now coming to the most important topic which is

FOOD- I must say I may not be a food blogger but I have had enough of chinese cuisines for years, But I felt this restaurant will be my one of the Best till date.. We order 4 items namely,

1. Lemon Coriander Soup with Chicken- When this was served, It took few seconds while enjoying the aroma, prepare with coriander leaves, lime, broth and ofcourse soft chicken pieces.. One word : AMAZING

2. Lat Me Kai with Chicken- This deep fried juicy boneless chicken as starter have always stole my heart prepared with cooking wine, ginger, garlic, chillis and spring onions.. It is a good starter to look out for..

3. Chicken in Asian Barbequed Sauce- Your taste buds will take some time to change the taste to a sweet and tangy tasted chicken dish and you will enjoy this very much..

4. Coriander and Burnt Garlic Fried Rice- Finally, the rice was well cooked and had a bit of coriander and garlic merged taste which I felt was flawlessly going with the chicken in asian barbequed sauce..

Experience was Great.. Will visit again..
And those of you who are reading reviews and are confused to go there, for them I would say Dont Waste Your Time.. Have a Great Meal..

One of the best Asian joint in Kolkata. Although not that busy all the time but the taste is amazing.

Starter

1.	Asia House Special Dumplings (Pork)

2.	Asian Barbequed (Chicken)

 The dumplings were amazing. But the coat could be a bit thinner and it would be amazing.

The barbequed chicken was good. Soft and succulent.

Main Course

1.	Mee Goreng (Mixed Indonesian Noodles)

2.	Xao Sa Ot (Pork)

The noodles where amazing. It tasted almost authentic. The noodles were soft and not chewy. Well dressed and seasoned well. The portion was nice to. Enough for 2. 

The pork was delicious. A bit sweet but nice and smooth. The strong taste of star anise was an added bonus. But the needle like lemon grass was a complete let down as it was dangerous if you are not careful having them.

Drinks – Fresh Lime Soda and Cola Float

Pocket friendly and nice and worth visiting.

We were around 22 people and I must say the small team of Asia House was able to cater to us with ease and a smile on their face. Spicy Lemon Burnt Garlic Soup. Lemon Coriander Soup

Not a very difficult place to locate for people of south Kolkata. Next to Raymond's seconds shop on lake view road behind lake Kali Bari. Nice cozy place. Food out there is simply fantastic. We had couple of starters of Asian barbequed chicken and Keong's sweet and spicy fish. Both were excellent. In the main course we had slices fish in sweet garlic sauce, roasted pork in sweet and sour sauce, mixed mayfoon and burnt ginger fried rice. For dessert we had darshan and ice cream. All the dishes were fantastic. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The portions were ample for three of us with enough to carry back for breakfast for the day next. 
A wonderful discovery of Asian cuisine in south Kolkata. I am sure to revisit to try the other gems from their menu.

House which has full of flavours in it… Yes..!! Asia House one of that restaurant where you can dine in if you are looking for ultimate Chinese cuisine. Go for it…!!

Located at Lake View Road just near to Lake kalibari , very much near to Southern Avenue. I must say they will serve you the best. I must salute for their hosting. Loved it…!! Looking forward to visit again. I will give 5 out of 5 for their hosting. Very much pleased indeed.

Ambience is good. Décor is simple but it’s good. I will rate 3.5/5 in terms of ambience and décor.

Now comes the main part ie., Food..!!

Before describing the items we had, I would like to describe the most awesome dishes. 

*Roasted Chilli Pork – The best ever Roasted Chilli Pork I ever had. The quality of the pork was too good. 

*Asia House Special Chicken Dumplings- Dumplings were mindblowing. We ordered it again.

*Khao Pad Kratiem – Oho that’s awesome. The fried rice with a flavor of lemon in it. Adding lemon grass in it is a nice idea. Good job by the chef.

The decor of the place is nice. Service was somewhat slow and we were quite hungry, though, the staffs were attentive enough to refill our glasses from time to time. We ordered asian barbequed chicken for starters which was quite delicious. Then came egg fried rice, chicken fried rice and schezwan chicken fried rice along with chicken xao sa ot and roasted pork in devils sauce. We were told the last two dishes were the most spicy in the menu, but neither of us found those to be spicy. The chicken was nice but the gravy had too many ginger julliens which we didn't like. Liked the pork, though would have liked it better if it was a little more tender. The schezwan fried rice could have been better, the other two fried rice was nice. Overall in my opinion not worth 4.5 stars.

Decor is simple and nice..service is quick enough.
We had crispy chilli babycorn(which was less babycorn more hardened batter)
Veg rice(on the sweeter side but good)
And a chicken side forgot the name which had small cubes of chicken and average.
Didnt find the rated standard as per zomato.

Another restaurant hunting trip ends in a disappointment... I am bit worried seeing such a restaurant to carry a rating of 4.5. The restaurant business in Kolkata seems to be a booming business...Although to complete the journey from a restaurant with a nice decor which serves food at a reasonable cost to a eatery which have a dedicated fan base is a long and arduous journey... Not to be too harsh... Their pork pepper bok choy had some promising flavours and their pan fried fish was good as any.  Hakka noodles was just a bit subtle for my taste buds, although serving veg noodles when the order was chicken noodles, to the lone customer there, doesn't really help your cause. The prawn in barbeque gravy was not bad.

Visited this place after being truly impressed by its zomato rating... Had a good meal... Here goes the details. 

1. For starters ordered the Asian Barbecued chicken and some Roasted chilly pork which has been listed as one of the must haves here. 
For the chicken I must say the flavour was exquisite and the sauce had a nice hint of black pepper . Though the chicken pieces were uncannily too small .The portion served was good for being a starter for two..
For the roasted chilly pork , I am going to run out of superlatives... The pork  portions was pretty good with nicely done pork pieces with minimum fat. The sauce was really too good to even start describing ... 

2. For the Main course ... Ordered their much loved Kung Pao chicken and some Khao Pad Kratiem ...
 
The Khao Pad Kratiem with chicken was a special yellowish Thai fried rice with a hint of lemon . Altogether a very nice dish which tasted good alone without any gravy to accompany.

The Kung Pao chicken was great.this was arguably one of  the best Kung Pao you can find in kolkata.   Just one word for it...The chicken pieces were small once again which might come out to be a deal breaker for many eaters... 
The fried rice served was good enough for two, so was the kung pao ... 

3. The interior decor complete with low asian music playing over the speakers was a great thing to behold. The place is cosy with a yellowish lighting inside which adds to the flavour of fine Asian dining.. 

I deduct one mark from my rating solely because of the size of the pieces of chicken... And something which had occurred to me which might be overlooked by others .. which is the pocket pinch... The food here is somewhat overpriced to my liking and as zomato suggests the cost for two at this place is ₹700 ... I found that not very abiding... A tag of ₹900 might go for it more aptly.

This is a small joint at southern avenue near lake kalibari!
It has a small capacity like 20 peoole to accommodate but the decor & the ambience appear very cozy. The staffs are courteous. 
We ordered chicken sweet corn soup. Then in starters we had chicken takrai & Asian barbecued fish & chicken. It was puja time, so the whole menu was not available but the amazing part is they didn't compromise with the food quality. Whatever they served was tasty. For mains we had mixed hakka noodles & mixed fried rice, chicken fried rice, general tao's favorite chicken & lamb in chilly garlic sauce. All came in great quantity esp the rice & noodles. The lamb appeared to be a bit bland but the other dishes were good. Overall a good pocket friendly experience. Will surely visit once again!

Located in the Heart of Southern Avenue , close to Somaj Sebi Pujo / Lake Kali bari – right beside Raymond’s Seconds Showroom. While Southern Avenue has many restaurants offering delectable Pan Asian food , this place is my recent favorite. With a wide array of offerings like Chinese, Thai, Indonesian, Seafood, Asian, Malaysian, Singaporean their chef from Shanghai, China has nailed it. Being a experienced chef and a Chinese by origin his secret recipes definitely gives the place an edge.

Asia House - the name only explains to us its cuisine . Its anothe hidden gem from the streets of south Kolkata , located just near the Lake Kali Bari . They excell in their Asian delicacies , the food is just " woooaaaoo!!! " over here . 

They has a sitting capacity of around 36 people . The ambience is just mood lifting with soothing music , dimly lit up bulbs and led lights , some hanging along with a thick rope some placed in baskets made of bamboo . It was very cozy . 

Now coming to the service . One fine afternoon we went there with our group of 22 foodies , for a post puja meet as bijoya sommiloni , and they way they served us at a time was really commandable .
The stuffs are very courteosu and friendly .

Now coming to the food . First we were served cold drinks . Then came The Spicy Lemon Burnt Garlic Soup ( Chicken ) and Lemon Coriander Soup ( chicken ) . Both the soups were equally good but i like the coriander one most .

Then as starters , we were served with Asia House Special Chicken Dumplings , Pan Tossed Chicken with Smoked Chilli and Peanuts and Asian Barbecued Fish . Each of the dishes were lipsmacking but I must mention specially about the Asian Barbecued Fish and Asia House Special Dumplings which were just heart touching . The fish pieces were appetizing and the dumplings were just mouth-watering .

For main course we were served with Chilli Garlic Noodles ( Spicy egg noodles tossed with chilli garlic sauce , a bit sweet in taste ) and Khao Pad Kratiem ( Thai stir fried chicken rice with burnt garlic and smoked oil ) . Along with these there were Pia Pad Kraprow ( Sliced Fish in Thai Chilli Basil Sauce with fresh red chillies ) , Hong Kong Sweet and Spicy Chicken ( Pan tossed chicken finished with roasted chilli , sliced ginger and roasted cashewnuts ) and then came the most mouth-watering , lipsmacking roasted chilli pork  . The pork was so soft , juicy and spicy that i will say it was the best one i ever had .

For desserts we were served Vanilla Ice Cream with Darsaan . It was also a new item for me and tasted really well . I will definitely visit this place again .

Asia House is a restaurant serving an eclectic mix of different Asian cuisines from Chinese to Thai to Vietnamese to Indonesian. Last Saturday, Team Munching Monks went there to savour some excellent food and to have the best time as a group.

Coming to the most important section - Food.
The following are what we were served for lunch.

Soups:
• Spicy Lemon Burnt Garlic Soup - Spicy and tangy.
• Lemon Coriander Soup - Thick and flavourful broth.

Starters:
• Asia House Special Dumplings- Excellent, the best among all the dishes.
• Pan Tossed Chicken With Smoked Chillies And Peanuts - Smoky and spicy.
• Asian Barbequed Fish - Tender chunks of fish in barbeque sauce.

Main Course:
• Chilli Garlic Noodles - Very basic, good flavours.
• Khao Pad Kratiem - Thai style rice with chicken.
• Pla Pad Kraprow - Spicy Thai gravy based fish.
• Hong Kong Sweet And Spicy Chicken - Chicken with cashew nuts in a Chinese style gravy.
• Roasted Chilli Pork - My all time favourite!

Dessert:
• Darshaan with Ice cream - One of the best darshaan i ever had, served with vanilla ice cream.

Overall the food was great and what was even better was the service.. Serving a group of 22 continuously with an untiring positive attitude is commendable.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to be together and spend such an incredibly wonderful time!

Asia House is one of the restaurants serving delectable Asian Cuisine and they did full justice to their name. One fine afternoon our group of 22 foodies visited this place and we came back with lots and lots of good memories. Asia House not only served us with delicious spread of food but the way they made all 22 of us comfortable as guests is surely remarkable.  Located at Lake View Road, just beside the Lake Kalibari lane, it is easily locatable. The aura of this place comes from the dimly lit lights inside and the rustic interior. Staffs were very courteous and well behaved.
                                                                ...

Team Munching Monks was invited for a taste testing session at Asia house and what awaited us was an afternoon full of good food, laughter and amazing hospitality.

My experience summed up in 3 Points (For those who don't want to go through a long detailed review):
●Ambience : 3.5/5.
●Food : 3.75/5
●Hospitality and Service: 5/5! (+1 in the overall rating for this!).
We were a total of 22 heads in a 28 seater restaurant and the staff members were humble enough to serve us whatever we wanted with a smile on their face. Even after an event of 4.5 hours, we were still asked if we wanted anything more on the table, with that sweet smile intact! The service provided by Mr.Biswajit Das, Mr.Prasenjit Adak and Mr.Manash Shaw, is commendable!

FOR A DETAILED REVIEW, PLEASE KEEP READING.😊

Coming to what we devoured and how our tastebuds reacted to the dishes:

1)Spicy Lemon Burnt Garlic Soup (Chicken) @Rs.160.00 (3.5/5): A very light chicken broth consisting of fresh vegetables and flavoured with lemon juice and garlic. The hint of garlic was somehow overshadowed by the lemon juice but the soup was overall pretty enjoyable!

2) Lemon Coriander Soup (Chicken) @Rs.170.00 (4/5): A concentrated version chicken soup with adequate egg drops and chicken. There was a prominent flavour of coriander with a generous sprinkle of coriander leaves which wasn't overpowering at all, though. A bowlful of this soup is actually very soothing to the tastebuds and soul.

3) Asia House Special Chicken Dumplings @Rs.210.00 (4.25/5) : Tender juicy excellently steamed chicken momos served with a pan glazed soy and mushroom sauce. Though there was no taste of mushroom shooting out, the sauce was really well made with garlic and soy! The dumplings were stuffed with chicken without any other nonsense stuffing and the tastebuds relished every bite of it along with the sauce.

4) Pan tossed chicken with Smoked Chillies and Peanuts @Rs.260.00 (4/5) : Chicken nicely coated in a sweet and midly spiced sauce and then topped with crunchy peanuts and roasted red chillies. I believe a slight drizzle of peanut oil would have taken it to another level! Nontheless, it was amazing on its own.

5) Asian Barbecued Fish @Rs.295.00 (3.25/5): The fish was supposed to have a nice smokey barbecue flavour but it was honestly missing. I would have also preferred the fish pieces to have a crunchier outer coating - that would definitely lift the flavours to a new height and add some texture to the overall dish.

6)Pla Pad Kraprow @Rs.310.00 (3.5/5) : In easier language - Sliced fish in thai basil chilli sauce with fresh red chillies. The fish used was basa and without doubt, it was of really good quality. The sauce it was doused in, was well made with a dominant flavour of lemongrass. Really liked it. The only flaw this dish had was that the fish was overcooked and hence the flaky texture was totally minimised.

7)Hong Kong Sweet and Spicy Chicken @Rs.280.00 (3.75/5) : To be very honest, the gravies of both the fish and this had the same base with slight variations here and there. This dish had a prominent sweet aroma of Star anise. It wasn't very spicy though. More on the sweetish side, it went very well with the lemongrass friedrice.

8) Khao Pad Kratiem (Chicken) @Rs.205.00 (4.25/5) : Not the most authentic thai style friedrice but enough to make you crave for more! With a dominant taste of lemongrass, tye friedrice stood out of all the main course dishes! Loved it.

9)Chilli Garlic Noodles @Rs.180.00 (2.5/5) : The noodles were well cooked with independent strands of noodles but the only trouble was the usage of tomato ketchup to a point where you could actually feel it overpowering the other flavours.

10) Roasted Chilli Pork @Rs.275.00 : While all the other 21 folks of my team devotedly devoured this dish, I wasn't a fan. Since I had just one spoonful, I wouldn't rate this dish.

11) Darsaan with vanilla icecream @Rs.195.00 (4.75/5) : I can confidently vouch for this to be one of the best darsans I have had in the city! Warm gooey honey topped fried flat noodles topped with white sesame seed are served with 2 scoops of vanilla icecream. The concoction of warm and cold compliment each other brilliantly. I would go again a hundred times just for this.😍

Definitely recommended for darn delicious and mouthwatering appetizers, specially dumplings. Go to Asia house for a quite evening dinner and you surely wont be dissapointed. 😁

Happy eating.❤❤
Eat.Salivate.Repeat.💗
Stay beautiful. 🙈💓

"Asia House" is one of the newest entrant in the scenario of delectable Chinese foods and has gained a huge popularity within a short time. We went here last Saturday. 

The decor was quirky with dim lighting. Coming to the food, we started our journey with cold drinks followed by Spicy Lemon Burnt Garlic Soup and Lemon coriander soup. Both the soups were delectable and we loved them.

For starters, we were served with Asia house special chicken dumplings,pan tossed chicken with smoked chili and peanuts and Asian barbecued fish. Each of the dishes were delectable however special praise goes for the Asian barbecued fish. The fish pieces were delectable and had a perfect blend of different spices.

For mains we were served with Chilli Garlic Noodles and Khao Pad Kratiem(Thai stir fried rice with burnt garlic and smoked oil). Along with these the side dishes were Pia Pad Kraprow (Sliced Fish in Thai Chilli Basil Sauce with fresh red chillies) and Hong Kong Sweet and Spicy Chicken.

As a surprise we were served with roasted chilli pork and believe this is the best pork that I have ever tasted.The pork was soft,juicy and spicy. It was decadence.

For desserts we were served with the sinfully delectable;e Darsaan, Apart from food,the hospitality of this place touched us.  They managed a group of 22 people with a constant smile on their face. Brownie points for that. I will definitely visit again.

"灵魂感动体验" (Línghún gǎndòng tǐyàn) meaning "Soul Touching experience" is what we had in mind to sum up my culinary adventure at this wonderful home like place which really left us spellbound. A total of 22 crazy foodies of Team Munching Monks visited Asia house for a big get together on the eve of Bijoya Sammilani.

The outlet Asia house is located at a primary location near Lake Kali Bari(The lane beside Dugout). The outlet has adequate sitting capacity of around 28-30. Simple decor of little chinese houses looks really adorable.

Anyways coming to the food we were served the following by the team of Asia House:-

1. Cold drinks

2. Sweet Lime soda - Very well made sweet lime soda with the perfect dash of lime & soda mix. Refreshing to say the least.

3. Chicken spicy lemon burnt garlic soup - The first of two soups which we were served. The soup consisted of chopped mixed vegetables,chicken bits along with chopped garlics and chilli flakes. The soup was really light & really punched in with loads of flavours although i felt the lemon essence overpowered the soup.

4. Chicken lemon coriander soup - A very different soup in terms of taste from the previous one. The classic combination of coriander with lemon never goes wrong. The soup had right consistency as it should be. Simple yet flavoursome. Recommended.

5. Asia house special dumplings - Calcuttans are die hard fan of momos/dumplings & they would give in just to have some delicious tasty momos. The special dumpling platter had 5pcs with generous chicken stuffing with an unqiue mushroom sauce dressing over the dumplings. The presence of garlics,coriander in the sauce just stole the show for me. The taste of the stuffing was tremendous in terms of taste. Recommended.

6. Pan tossed chicken with smoked chillies & peanuts - Diced chicken wok tossed in glazed soy sauce with peanuts,chillies & bell peppers. The chicken was cooked to perfection which was obvious from its tenderness. The balance of flavours were really well maintained which certainly made our tastebuds dance.

7. Asian Berbequed fish - Diced basa fish in glazed soy sauce & honey with onions & bell peppers. Loved the dish to our fullest. The fish was of superb quality. The taste of the whole dish had rustic flavours. Totally loved it.

8. Khao pad kratiem - In simpler terms burnt garlic thai friedrice. The thai friedrice was the star staple in our main course. The infusion of lemongrass just took the dish to a whole new level. The rice also had a great aroma to it. The quantity per plate was very generous. Highly Recommended.

9. Chilli garlic noodles - The second staple served along with the thai friedrice. The noodles were a bit flat as compared to the first staple. The flavours got us going but that wow factor was somewhere missing according to me.

10. Hong kong sweet & spicy chicken - Diced chicken served in sweet & spicy hong kong styled gravy. The gravy had good texture & consistency. The taste was simple yet very delectable with our staples. The presence of star anise also gave a different dimension in terms of taste. The chicken was also well made.

11. Pla pad kraprow - The fish main side dish served with our mains. The taste of the dish was overall good but i found the fish a bit overcooked personally.

12. Dry Roast chilli pork - The dish had roasted shredded pork with onion,chillies & capsicums. The dish tasted nice & was really enjoyed by us. The dish had equal proportions of pork meat & fat.

13. Darsaan with ice cream - Personally i think i had the best darsaan with ice cream so far in kolkata. The honeyed noodles were super crunchy & not too overly sweet. The ice cream was also of good quality and really went well. The quantity was also good. Recommended.

The long range of food really made us happy & well content. The service & hospitality really deserves a salute with credits to Biswajit Das,Prasenjit Adak and Manash Shaw who made us feel like home. The owner Mr.Varun Rajgarhia is doing a fantastic work in serving authentic asian food to the people of kolkata. I wish him all the best for the future!!

3. Chicken spicy lemon burnt garlic soup - The first of two soups which we were served. The soup consisted of chopped mixed vegetables,chicken bits along with chopped garlics and chilli flakes. The soup was really light & really punched in with loads of flavours although i felt the lemon essence overpowered the soup.

4. Chicken lemon coriander soup - A very different soup in terms of taste from the previous one. The classic combination of coriander with lemon never goes wrong. The soup had right consistency as it should be. Simple yet flavoursome. Recommended.

5. Asia house special dumplings - Calcuttans are die hard fan of momos/dumplings & they would give in just to have some delicious tasty momos. The special dumpling platter had 5pcs with generous chicken stuffing with an unqiue mushroom sauce dressing over the dumplings. The presence of garlics,coriander in the sauce just stole the show for me. The taste of the stuffing was tremendous in terms of taste. Recommended.

6. Pan tossed chicken with smoked chillies & peanuts - Diced chicken wok tossed in glazed soy sauce with peanuts,chillies & bell peppers. The chicken was cooked to perfection which was obvious from its tenderness. The balance of flavours were really well maintained which certainly made our tastebuds dance.

7. Asian Berbequed fish - Diced basa fish in glazed soy sauce & honey with onions & bell peppers. Loved the dish to our fullest. The fish was of superb quality. The taste of the whole dish had rustic flavours. Totally loved it.

8. Khao pad kratiem - In simpler terms burnt garlic thai friedrice. The thai friedrice was the star staple in our main course. The infusion of lemongrass just took the dish to a whole new level. The rice also had a great aroma to it. The quantity per plate was very generous. Highly Recommended.

9. Chilli garlic noodles - The second staple served along with the thai friedrice. The noodles were a bit flat as compared to the first staple. The flavours got us going but that wow factor was somewhere missing according to me.

10. Hong kong sweet & spicy chicken - Diced chicken served in sweet & spicy hong kong styled gravy. The gravy had good texture & consistency. The taste was simple yet very delectable with our staples. The presence of star anise also gave a different dimension in terms of taste. The chicken was also well made.

11. Pla pad kraprow - The fish main side dish served with our mains. The taste of the dish was overall good but i found the fish a bit overcooked personally.

12. Dry Roast chilli pork - The dish had roasted shredded pork with onion,chillies & capsicums. The dish tasted nice & was really enjoyed by us. The dish had equal proportions of pork meat & fat.

13. Darsaan with ice cream - Personally i think i had the best darsaan with ice cream so far in kolkata. The honeyed noodles were super crunchy & not too overly sweet. The ice cream was also of good quality and really went well. The quantity was also good. Recommended.

The long range of food really made us happy & well content. The service & hospitality really deserves a salute with credits to Biswajit Das,Prasenjit Adak and Manash Shaw who made us feel like home. The owner Mr.Varun Rajgarhia is doing a fantastic work in serving authentic asian food to the people of kolkata. I wish him all the best for the future!!

Kolkatans specially the Bongs are never tired of having chinese cuisine. Located very near to lake kalibari this restaurant serves wonderful chinese and asian cuisine. The decorations are very well and smart. Service of the staffs are very humble and quick.

Munching monks were invited by Mr. Varun Rajgarhia for a bijaya sammilani cum pre diwali bash celebration. The service provided by Biswajit Das Prasenjit Adak and Manas Shaw was quite heartwarming.

True Hospitality is welcoming strangers on their own terms. And Asia House did just that. I visited this place with my friends. We were a staggering group of 22 and the finesse with which they handled such a group spoke of their expertise. Located near Lake Kalibari, this gem of a restaurant serves authentic asian cuisine at reasonable prices.
The dishes on our menu were-
Soup-
√Spicy lemon Burnt Garlic Soup(Chicken)- It is a spicy broth with garden fresh vegetables, lemon juice and burnt garlic. Very flavourful. Highly recommended.
√Lemon Coriander Soup-(Chicken)- Coriander and lime flavoured thick soup with fresh vegetables. The warmth of this soup seeped into my soul. Very good.

Starters-
√Asia House special dumplings (Chicken)- Steamed Chicken Dumplings topped with glazed soy and mushroom sauce. The dumplings were a complete hit. We ordered the dumplings multiple times. They were soft and moist. The filling was great. The sauce tasted a tad sweet. But it went nicely with the dumplings though.
√Pan tossed Chicken with smoked chillies and peanuts(Chicken)- Stir fried sweet and spicy chicken with roasted chillies and peanuts. Another favourite of mine. The chicken was juicy and succulent and full of strong flavours. Loved this one. Recommended from my side.
√Asian Barbecued Fish- Sliced fish pan fried and tossed with Asia Barbecue sauce and honey. This one tasted great as well.

Mains-
√Pla Pad Kraprow- Sliced fish in Thai chilli basil sauce with fresh red chillies.
√Hong Kong sweet and spicy Chicken- Pan tossed Chicken with tossed chilli, Sliced ginger and roasted cashewnuts. I loved the occasional bite of ginger along with the spicy flavour of the chicken.
√Roasted Pork in Soya sauce- Loved this dish. Very soft to touch and tasted great as well. Hero of the day.

Rice & Noodles-
√Chilli Garlic Noodles(Egg)- This could have been a bit better. Tasted a bit bland after the strong bold flavours of the starters, but tasted good nonetheless.
√Khao Pad Kratiem(Chicken)- After the amazing starters and mains, this dish came out as a winner for us. We loved the rice. It is Thai stir fried rice with burnt garlic and smoked oil. This dish really won us over.

Desserts-
√Darsan with ice-cream- This one was a showstopper. I loved the Darsan. It was beautifully made. The ice-cream was perfect.

The fresh lime soda and coke worked wonders as thirst quenchers.

The lunch was a complete hit. The décor was simplistic. Could be improved. Special thanks to Biswajit Das, Prasenjit Adak and Manash Shaw for their service

In South Kolkata region, you will gets tons of option to satisfy your Chinese food craving but Boss, you are in Kolkata and you hardly know where a surprise come from! Yes, a small joint near Lake Kalibari will give us such surprise, was really beyond anyone’s expectation.

Been there few days ago with my friend gang.. The restaurant itself is small in size with sitting capacity of maximum 32-35 persons at a time but within this limitation, how they serves us is really something worth remembering. So before entering into food part, I will want to special thanks to the management. Kudos to all the service boys out there. All of them are very humble, courteous and very much helpful. Service is a bit slow, but it was okay.

Now come to the food part. Frankly speaking, I have never heard about this restaurant before, so was little doubt in my mind about their food quality. But when the food came to the table, both the decoration and the taste of the food blows everyone of ours mind. Really a hidden gems for the Southern Avenue area.

The food we had are –

Soups -

1. Lemon Coriander Soup (Chicken) – Lite in flavor with distinct lemon aroma. Little amount of veggies were their but good as a starter soup.

2. Spicy Lemon Burnt Garlic Soup (Chicken) – Another soup with Gandharaj lemon and garlic infusion. Little bit of spicy in nature but tastes really well.

Starter -

1. Asia House Special Dumplings – Probably the best Dumplings I’ve ever tasted. The outer coating were so soft and the mashed chicken filling inside was too good. It was juicy, soft as well as tasty in nature. The dumplings comes with Soy and Mushroom Sauce. The sauce added extra flavor in your mouth.

2. Pan tossed Chicken with Smoked Chilies and Peanuts – Another highly recommended item here. The chicken pieces were stir fried with chilly and peanut. The chicken pieces were soft in nature and sweet as well as spicy in nature.

3. Asian Barbequed Fish – Another fish starter item from their menu. The fishes were pan fried with Barbecued sauce. The honey touch in it was also really awesome. The fish pieces were so soft that it literally melts in your mouth.

4. Roasted Pork with Black Pepper and Bok Choy – One of the best pork item, I’ve ever had. The pork pieces were so soft, crispy fried. Must try item for ant pork lover.

Mains -

1. Pla Pad Kraprow – A Thai fish side dishes. The fishes were well cooked with chilly sauces and the Basil leaf infusion in it was really amazing.

2. Hong Kong Sweet & Spicy Chicken – Chicken side dish with roasted cashew nuts. Pan tossed chicken were well cooked with roasted chilly and sliced ginger. Recommended side dish with any types of rices.

Rice & Noodle -

1. Chilly Garlic Egg Noodles – Normal traditional garlic noodles with egg scrambling. The noodles were spicy in nature but tastes okay.

2. Khao Pad Kratiem (Chicken) – Another Thai item. Stir fried rice was well cooked with garlic and chicken pieces. Chicken pieces were soft and huge in quantity. The rice also had lemon infusion, which definitely catch your attention while having it. One the best rice, I’ve ever had.

Desserts -

1. Darsaan with Ice Cream – I shall call it showstopper rather than a normal desserts. After having so many good dish, it really need a beautiful ending and the Darsaan did that job awesomely. One of the best desserts I’ve ever tasted. With vanilla ice cream, the item tastes like heavenly. Must must try item here.

After having the above mentioned dishes, one thing just came in my mind – Wowwwww…..Such excellent quality tastes from an unknown (was to me) restaurant was really something, that make my day. Love the food, love the hospitality

Serving 20+ customer in a gang, at a time was not an easy job but how the stuffs managed it in such an limiting space, deserves a big Thumbs' up. One thing I just want to say to the management is, Just give a little attention to you interior decoration. It can be improved a lot.

Overall a great dining experiences and will definitely visit this restaurant again.

Asia House offers authentic Asian cuisine and the best part is the main villain Ajino Moto is absent from their dishes.
We had:
*Lemon Coriander Soup (Chicken)* It had the egg whites in perfect concoction with the zesty lime and coriander flavour.
*Spicy Lemon Burnt Garlic soup* I guess for clear soup lovers who like sour flavours this is a good start to the meal.
*Asia House special Dumplings* The dimsums were well prepared and the soy sauce glazed over it is a likeable surprise for many.
*Chicken Pan tossed with Schezwan sauce, smoked chillis and peanuts* Again whenever Asian dishes use peanuts the food quality is upgraded. The crunch and the spices are a hit together.
*Asian Barbequed fish* I have affection for fish starters, hence I liked it well enough.
*Chilli Garlic noodles* personally this was a disappointment. I expected the smoky distinct flavour of garlic n chilli which I always crave for in this dish instead of a sweetish tomato flavour.
*Khao Pad Kratiem* this rice has a definite different taste the thai oil and mild burnt garlic flavour managed to stand out despite us having so much of other foods.
*Pla Pad Krakow* I didn't quite like the fish it seemed pulpy and overcooked but the sauce was distinctly good to remember.
*Hong Kong Sweet and Spicy Chicken* this was bland that's all I can say.
*Roasted Pork in Chilli Soya sauce* the pork pieces managed to be crispy and soft at the same time. That was impressive.
*Darsaan with Ice cream* now I have had darsaan at quite a number of places till date but this dish here was amazing, after all the spices the refreshing light and crispy fried wide noodles with the vanilla ice cream was a culinary fulfilment.
The coke and lemon lime soda were thirst quenchers from time to time.
The service and hospitality received was more than appreciable. The ambience is pretty decent. It was a foodie meet up and I had an amazing time with

When it comes to Chinese food, I tend to get very choosy. So, when I, along with my group of foodie friends decided to visit Asia House for Saturday Brunch, I was a bit skeptical about how the food would be, because honestly I didn’t hear of this place before. 

We started with two soups, a) Spicy Lemon Burnt Garlic Soup - I am not too fond of spicy stuff, so I won’t comment on this one. 

b) Lemon Coriander Soup - This was very smooth, light, full of chicken pieces, aromatic and easy on the palette. A perfect start to a hearty meal. 

Then we went with 3 starters, 

a) Chicken Special Dimsums: I am a sucker for dimsums, and I just had to order. Turned out really really well! RECOMMENDED! 

b) Pan Tossed Chicken: This one was great again. Big ups.

c) Barbeque Fish: The best starter of the lot. The softness will take you to a different world. RECOMMENDED!

For the main course, we ordered:

a) Pla Pad Krapow: Sliced Fish in Thai Chilli Basil Sauce with Fresh Red Chillies - The fish was as smooth as butter. Ought not to be missed. Go for it!

b) Hong Kong Chicken: A varied variety of Chilli Chicken, I would say. Tasted fair enough. 

c) Chilli Garlic Egg Noodles: The noodles was fantastic! The taste is still there! Amazing amazing preparation.

d) Khao Pad Kratiem: Burnt Garlic Stir Fried Rice - Can easily vouch for the fact that it’s one of the better fried rice I have had! 

Overall a great experience, must must visit.

Thanks Tanmoy Da for taking me there!

Yet another restaurant on the by lanes​ of busy Southern Avenue. Clearly this place gets a tough competition from it's fellow neighbours but it indeed keep up a good fight.A small area smartly designed with spacious seating arrangements. A vast menu card is what everyone likes. Lightly cooked soups or spicy grilled pork, we ordered every kind of dishes. The chef did a commendable job. Soups were light yet tasty. Starters were exceptionally good. Coming to the main course rice dish is something everyone should try. Kla Pad Krapaw is pure bliss. Ending our taste rollcoaster with an awesome dessert called Darshan. A treat to your eyes as well as tummy. Appropriate justice to the name. I loved this place.

Based on Zomato ratings,I settled for this restaurant for a nice Chinese lunch on dashami and I wasn't disappointed. The chilli pork deserves a thumbs up at the very start! You can choose your fish and meat from a varied choice of sauces. Their quantity is enough for two. Going by the name, I was expecting the noodles to be a little different from other restaurants but it was ordinary. Overall it was a good dining experience with a lovely ambience.

Went there today around 12:30 pm. I had very very high expectations from this place & will not say that I'm completely disappointed. At the same time it was not very satisfying. 
This place has a damp smell but the interiors is beautifully decorated.
We ordered takrai fish & jiang's pan fried chicken for starters. The fish was beautifully cooked and has a sweet & sour taste to it. The chicken tasted average. The salt was less put in the chicken. 
Now after the starters were done the waiter took the plates but didn't take the used forks. He kept the used forks on the napkins and brought separate plates for mains. This is a bit disappointing. In all these years that I've been to restaurants, every time the waiter changes the spoons alongwith the plates. He doesn't keep them on the napkins which are to be used to wipe our mouths. 
They took quite a bit of time to serve the mains. For the mains we ordered simple mixed fried rice & chicken in chilli soya sauce. The rice was bland. It needed more prawns and chicken. The chicken main was cooked well enough. The main reason why we didn't order another plate of rice was because they take a fair amount of time. So we cancelled another fried rice. 
The place is good & they have huge scope for improvement. The taste was good but I had expected better by looking at the reviews. The staff was cordial and polite but they need to speed up their work.

Located very near to the Lake Kalibari, this is a wonderful restaurant for Chinese and Asian cuisine. Service of the staffs are extremely courteous and service is quick. Not a very spacious joint, but well decorated with smart decorations.
Food is quite good but nothing extraordinary.
We ordered Jiang's Pan Fried Chicken - It was medium spicy, small pieces of chicken , soft and well marinated , tossed in a pan Fried sauce, along with bell peppers and veggies. 4/5
Asian Barbequed Pork - An awesome preparation made of soft and juicy Pork tossed in Barbequed sauce. Simply amazing. 5/5
Mixed Fried Rice - Taste wise good, quantity sufficient for two, ample amount of chicken egg and prawn. Prawn pieces were not cleaned, the black strips were present in prawns which made it a major drawback. 3/5
General Tai's Favourite Fish - Prepared with Basa fish, tossed in a sauce with honey, roasted chillies and chili paste. It is a sweet yet spicy preparation, really awesome of you like sweet taste. Fish was very soft and well marinated. 5/5
Vietnamese Xao Sa Ot Chicken - We disliked this item , it was horrible. Lots and lots of ginger and lemon grass , and a smell as if the gravy was rotten.Horrible.Yackkk. On informing the staff, he himself insisted in modifying the preparation for us. That was a very nice gesture, since we would have wasted the whole plate without taking a single more spoon of it. The modified version was far better and edible. However the taste itself was too much of ginger and lemon, not at all liked by any of us. 2/5
Overall it is a wonderful place, not very expensive, average 500 per head with starters and main course. Very good service, the staffs are polite and helpful. Not everyone insist on modifying a preparation after half of it is consumed already. However the food could have been better than this. Ambience and crowd is good. Overall 3.5/5 .

Visited this place for dinner on nabami after a frantic search for a restaurant where we'd have to wait for less than an hour. We ordered sweet lime soda, Taipei fish, Vietnamese Xao Sa Ot Pork and Nasi Goreng (Mixed). The food tasted quite satisfactory. The pork was really tender and well cooked. The fish was also delicious. The pricing is slightly on the higher side, but this restaurant on lake road is worth a visit!

One of the most awful experience i came across this nabami evening while having my dinner here.The ambience is pathetic and so was the food and management.I had ordered Tafri (which was supposed to b a fish prep) that was nothing but mass of thick cornflour dipped in whatnot sauces!The coriander burnt garlic rice had nothing to do wd coriander.The vietnamese chic prep was completly tasteless,though chicken pieces were felt.To end,i will just suggest u never to visit this place as a homecooked maggi is a way more better option than having a meal here.

Panchami afternoon we, a group of 8 hungry people, went there.. had to wait for about half an hour before getting seats.. we ordered Takrai, Chicken Vietnamese Xao sa OT and mixed fried rice.. Takrai was great.. delicious crispy chicken pieces.. the chicken dish was nothing special (happens in all restaurant during puja season) and mixed fried rice was pretty ordinary.. but the quantity of everything was very decent and fit for 2 people.. decent experience and would really recommend everyone to give a try..

The most attractive feature of the restaurant is it's prohibition of MSG. Restaurants have been using msg to add taste to their dishes over the years, but Asia House is setting an example by making as delicious dishes without its use. The quality of the dishes is just not to be questioned. Only the quantity of the dishes were a bit unsatisfactory. Improving that part can make the restaurant one of the most successful ventures in the city!

So it's Durga Puja and the foodie that I am , I started browsing through zomato in search of 'hidden gems' ; and my search ended here . A Chinese restaurant quite close to where I stay with a rating of 4.4/5 . What more could somebody have asked for !! "I have found a hidden gem ; prepare yourself to be amazed" - I told my family as we entered the restaurant ! And Asia House did amaze ; but not in a good way though ! It's a tiny place with around 7-8 tables with no ambience so to say . The service was quite average ; the attendants seemed lost , often literally !! The food was ordinary ; very ordinary ! The quantity was good vis-a-vis the cost ; but somehow it lacked quality and taste ! We were an extremely disappointed bunch of people when the ordeal finally came to an end . It's so hard to believe that a restaurant which is so highly rated can mess up so bad ! Maybe it's not a place to visit during such 'overwhelming occasions' as the Pujas !

It was a panchami noon and two hungry souls visited this place.. Location is quite amazing.. The interior is little small.. However we were on a rush.. And and did not order much of variety.. Only 2 items..
The mixed coriander and burnt garlic rice was sumptous and the roasted pork in blackpeeper sauce was really the showstopper... I have never tasted such a good pork item in recent times.. Excellent food quality.. And if the place was a little big it would have been a great one.. The staffs were helpful and even in puja times the food came before expected times..
And lastly the price was also satisfactory.. 
P. S it is a lovely place for college goers.. So there will be always high volume college gangs present.. Personally it reminded me of my college days..

During Durga Puja I had my previous experience where many well restaurants degrade their quality of food. But after yesterday's experience my opinion have changed. We had a family dinner consisting of 14 people. Ambiance wise it's very  simple. Very cooperative and courteous staff. 

We had ordered chicken hot sour and chicken sweet corn soup - good taste and sufficient quantity. 

They suggested us to try Asia barbequed chicken - a must try. Soft , tender and well marinated chicken with both sweet and spicy taste.

Chicken Hakka Noodles - It was ok in taste

General Tao's Favorite - They suggested this one too. Gravy based chicken,sufficient amount. Those who prefer sweet gravy they can try this one.

Came across this place while pandal hopping so thought of having lunch there . The ambience is good
. We ordered chilli garlic veg noodles and chicken with chilli soya sauce . The food was way beyond my expectations . It was delicious and the best Chinese I had after a long time . It was spicy and the perfect blend of hot and spicy . The food was very well cooked .

We stopped by at this place for a quick lunch in between pandal hopping during the Durga Puja.... Because of the puja rush and since we were a group of about 10 people we had to wait for about 20 min....but the staff were very helpful and even took our order while we were waiting outside to save time.... Despite the puja rush the quality of food was quite good and the price was reasonable too....

Heard a lot about this place so during Pandal hopping came here after exhaustion with a friend of mine. Its a very small place with few tables but ambience is good. There was a compact Pujo special menu. Ordered mixed cantonese noodles and honey glazed fish with smoked chili with a couple of fresh lime soda. The waiter came and told us that they ran out of ice so we had to cancel our order of fresh lime. Again we got pork instead of fish but i k not complaining as it was good quality meat. But such blunder should not happen. Food tasted good but the quantity of noodles was a bit less. Thanx to the staff for changing our table to a better one. Pricing is okay. Will try more variety on my nxt visit

Awesome food, soothing music and courteous staff. We went for lunch and had belly full of Asian dishes. For starters we had keongs sweet n spicy chicken and takrai chicken. In the main course we went for conventional chicken fried rice and Kung Pao chicken along with Asian barbequed sauce. Lip smacking and mouthwatering

The word "food" itself makes me happy! N when it comes to Oriental cuisine, the tongue goes out of my control! I have been to this place twice.... N amazed to find out how efficiently n creatively they have given an outlook to the restro... You would fall in love with the lights sheltered under cane baskets (jhuri)... Let's come to the main part... We tried many signature dishes including konjee crispy lamb fry, coriander & burnt garlic rice, chicken in Hunan sauce, Asian barbequed chicken, mixed meifoon....each dish would make you crave for the restro again n again... Happy fooding!!!

Thai food do not taste right at all. Thai green curry & Tom kha soup were miles away from real taste.

Highly over priced compared to the standard of property and services.

Mostly good reviews and high ratings on Zomato made us try out a new place. But there's disconnect between reality and expectations.

Hope things improve in future.

All the best!

Went with a group of 6,the owner approached us times twice or thrice with warm hospitality.We tried different Asian dishes apart from Chinese,like Indonesian dishes and some of their signature dishes.Had ordered right from starters,main courses to desserts and it came out to be a reasonable one.
Almost every item amazed us with its delicacies except the General Tao's pork turned out to be a sweet one though we expected a spicier one.Mostly chicken dishes were shredded and not diced one.Fried ice cream demands a special applause,it had a Thai inclination with vanilla icecream under fried coconut cover.
Nothing special about decor.It was spacious and nice ambience.Overall,a good experience on a weekday afternoon around 1pm.

Today I went this little but cozy Chinese outlet for lunch with my friend . It was in my since long times . So finally when I got the chance to visit it I was excited for this.

First come to the decoration . It was nothing fancy . But the ambience is really cozy and plus the soft English songs played add there were extra point .

Now coming to the food. We ordered steamed momo , Hakka Chaw (mixed) and chicken in devil sause. The foods are really amazing .

The momo is very juicy and the fillings are really tasty . Being a momo lover it was the best start for me.

But a small tips - giving some soup with it will be more preferable .

The Hakka chawmin is the best I have till date . It is loaded with lots of chicken , egg and prawn . But according to me it could be little more spicy .

The devil chicken is another dish worth try . But again they described it as most spicy dish . But I really didn't find anything spicy in it . But if you overlook the matter , the dish is amazing one .

Then as a desert we have Chocolate broeney with chocolate sauce. Being a chocolateover I enjoyed it fullest . The browney is soft , just the way I like it .

Now it's time to talk about the bill . It is the only cause why I rated as 2.5 . They charged us 1026 including GST. But unfortunately didn't give us any bill . Even they didn't show us any paper documents regarding the bill . Even we need to go outside to pay the bill as they didn't give the bill on table . When I asked about the GST they told us that they are charging it but didn't show any GST number . It is really VERY UNPROFESSIONAL . And thus thing just spoiled my entire lunch . They should provide us the bill . If they continue to do this then atleast I will not visit their outlet again .


P.s. - If they change their this attitude then the restaurant is one of the worth visit ..

Me and my friend love to explore new eatery spots and we find this place really satisfying.They serve the food as their name is. They serve several type of delicacies such as Vietnamese, Thai, Shanghai, Indonesian. Their quality and quantity of food is quite decent for two person per plate (If you do not have very big appetite then only :) :). As it's a small place so do not expect very nice and well decorated ambience but it is surely one of the best place for food. Last but not the least the best part of this restra is their food is without Ajinomoto.

Located near Lake Kalibari this place serves some really great Asian dishes, we ordered some pretty common dishes like Fried Wanton, Chicken Meifoon , Singapore Mixed Rice Noodles, Sliced Chicken in Chilli wine sauce and Roasted Pork in black pepper sauce. Food was excellent staff were very friendly. And the pocket pinch is not too high. For dessert we had Fried ice cream, paid parking is available on the adjacent lane.
Overall a good experience will visit once again.

Love everything about this place. It's new feather in the growing pan asian delicacies over the city.
Have been here for a number of times and keep coming back. Thai chilli basil noodles,mei goreng,pad thai noodles and meifoon are good among popular main course options.
I tried pad kee ew once, a spicy indonesian rice noodles which I liked but it had too much of kafir lime leaves,that it would often get stuck in your mouth.
My friends had neua kae kraprow lamb and roasted pork in chilli garlic sauce ,they were quite good in taste. Other than that kung pao chicken,general Tao's chicken,dimsums,chicken in wine sauce,xao sa ot,m oo gra tiem are among my favorites.
Coming to the service. The stuffs are very friendly and prompt. For the payment they accept Paytm also. So I can go cashless anytime. ;)
The decor is minimal that goes quite well with the theme of the joint with some soulful music playing.
Creates a nice and cozy ambience.

Definitely a go to place! :)

I had an amazing experience here. Started out with the soups (Asian Hawkers Soup-Veg and Indonesian Bakso-Chicken) with were beautifully infused with their signature flavours of galangal and kaffir lime. The fried wontons were very tiny in terms of the individual size but they were very well made and had 8 pieces so it was fine. Main course I had Potatoes and American Corn in Hot Garlic Sauce and Balinese Curry in Chicken both of which were well made but the star of the main course was definitely Khao Pad Kratien which is a garlic based rice dish. It was simply delicious! Dessert was the fried ice cream, which was a ball of ice cream covered in coconut crumbs and some chocolate sundae which was good too. Our server was well informed and guided us well while choosing the food dishes. However, the portions of the mains are decently sized and one should order carefully. This place is definitely worth a visit.

Asia House is certainly among the top notch places in Kolkata serving the pan asian delicacies with utmost precision and perfection. 

Why I say so??
Pan Asian cuisine can be the easiet and most difficult at the same to conjure up perfectly since the foundation of this culinary concept lies solely on the subtlely of flavours than an excessive amount of spices and colors. Asia House nails it with their handful of skillset and panache. 

USP:
-> Authentic taste 
-> No MSG 
Also to mention about their expert old Chinese origin chef who has been brought up here from Shanghai.

**Location**
Southern Avenue area just the right Lane before Lake Kali bari if you are coming from Golpark. It's just near the Raymonds showroom. Can easily be located and find.

**Food and Ambience**

Having a decent dining area inside Asia house has kept their decor very quirky with the hanging rope bulbs from the celling with a chinese decorative themes all around. Simple and sober I would say which certainly creates an ambience for a good meal.

Well coming on to the most important part of any restaurant the food is certainly their biggest strength. My experience started with a mouthful of delicious starters and warm soup. 
Shanghai Hawkers Soup was very light and delightful with the starters alongside. Hua Hin Highway rolls stuffed with tasty chicken stuffing with the Kaffir lime flavour added more fun to it. Also to mention their Asia house special dumplings which is one of their signature dishes which is a must try. With all these my favorite was their Takrai (fish) which was tossed in Thai herbs and Chilli coriander and lemongrass flavour. 

Mains: 
Pla gla Tiem: A fish gravy dish tossed in black pepper and basil sauce is a good choice to have with rice. 
Khao Pad Kratiem can be a good option for rice with this which made of Thai smoked oil and burnt Garlic rice .
For vegetarian lovers can try the veg option of the rice with Pak pad Kraprow which is an exotic veggie main gravy comes along with Thai chilli Basil vegetables with lemon grass and burnt chilli paste. Delicious.

Hong Kong sweet and Spicy Chicken went really well with the Chilli Garlic Noodles.

Dessert:
Darsaan with Vanilla Ice cream made it a perfect conclusion to the whole dining experience with its sweetness. Also ordered for their ice cream sandwich which is one of their signature dessert option here.

All in all I really liked this place and their food. Also to mention about their service quality, food quality and quantity has been really generous. Asia House surely one of the places I would recommend.

Pan Asian cuisine is certainly not a new genre in Kolkata. People here being the food worshipers that they are have always welcomed new flavors with open arms. Asian cuisine has almost attained a reputation of being a house hold name. Adding to this growing popularity of Pan Asian food is Asia House situated in southern avenue, one of the food hubs of the city with its wide array of restaurants on either side of the street.

I am quite a huge fan of Asian cuisine, I might choose it over Indian cuisine any day but not all eateries in the city satisfies your crave as well as Asia house does with its beautiful decor and prodigious food.

I recently dined here on a invitation, gorged on some beautiful cuisines.
Apart from the thick Sanghai Hawker's soup and House special steamed dumplings for starters Asia house offers perfectly crispy Hua Hin highway rolls (crispy rolls stuffed vermicelli, kaffir lime, roasted peanuts and chicken) and the phenomenal Takrai fish (fish tossed in lemongrass, chili, coriander and herbs).
The fish here never disappoints! The pla gra tiem is a proof, with its beautifully cooked fish in black pepper and basil sauce.
Apart from the fish the Hong Kong sweet and spicy chicken, pak pad karprow which is a beautiful ensemble of vegetables with lemongrass and burnt chili paste gives you a serene harmony of flavor and taste inside your mouth.

Last but not the least, The Dessert!

Crispy yet sticky honey drizzled Darsan with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream is what happiness sounds like. Now I have had Darsan at a lot of places but they usually fail to create a balance of taste between the Darsan and ice cream resulting in a over sweetened palate. But this was made to absolute perfection low on sweetness and high on foodgasm quotient!
An extra .5 for the dessert!

Ambience: 4.2/5
Food: 4.6/5
Service: 4.5/5

Wandering in the streets of Southern Avenue and zomato shows up a suggestion of Asia House. 
We gave it a try and it was above our expectations of the place. The interiors to start with; very creative and perfect lighting that we find and would want in an oriental restaurant making it a very nice and comfy ambiance. 

Staff was very friendly, though they could not really explain the items on the menu eloquently enough. 

We had ordered, Vietnamese rice paper rolls which were bombs of flavors; first it seemed sweet, then tangy sour, then a little nutty and it was hot and spicy, it got over in no time. The second dish ordered was Konjee Crispy(cannot really comment on that, me being a vegetarian can just speak on the beautiful aroma it gave out and looked awesome as well).
The main course was Mee Goreng, you won't need a curry with it as these noodles are tossed well in Sambal sauce and wow what excellent taste it had! The Sambal sauce was the champion ingredient. A little on a hotter side; so, people with less knack of spicy food: Beware! It was a perfect way to finish the dinner off! If you are looking for good oriental food this an excellent place with various cuisines of Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and China.

Roaming in around Southern​ Avenue you cannot help miss this place with its warm welcoming charm sitting in one of the bylanes. Dimly lit and aesthetically decorated it provides a nice ambience to its diners. Asia house happens to be one of big names in the city when it comes to Asian flavors. One can only be reassured when they find out even the chef hails from Shanghai itself . It cannot get any more authentic, can it? 

We have been there a couple of weeks before on an invitation. Dinner began with Shanghai Hawkers Soup followed by Asia house special dumplings. Both came in choices of veg and non veg with chunky pieces of tofu replacing the chicken in the vegetarian option. Then came in the Hua Hin Highway Rolls with its very tasty lemongrassy flavor followed by Fish Takrai and Pla Gra Tiem both of them being absolutely delicious. 

Main course comprised of chili garlic noodles which was a bit dry, Khao pad kratiem, stir fried chicken with cashew nuts and Hong Kong sweet and spicy chicken. All of it tasted pretty good and the succulent chicken along with its delicious gravies did justice to it. We concluded our dinner with Krispy darsaans with ice cream and few bites of an ice cream sandwich. It was overall a good visit. I like the place and the food and will stroll in later again for a filling meal. Service is good and the servers are extremely courteous. Overall a good place for a family dinner or a hearty meal.

A must visit for all Chinese cuisine lovers. We ordered for chicken fried rice and pork in barbeque sauce. Both were amazing to taste. There were atleast 10 thick pork pieces. Worth the money. And it's not  expensive either.

Good food, great service and happy conversations with a table full of happy people, are what make for a good meal, for me. And that is just what I got here, at Asia House, when I went there on an invitation. Be it the super crispy Hua-Hin Rolls with a lemony chicken filling, or the Stir-fried Chicken with Cashew Nuts, or the Fish Takrai in an aromatic sauce,  I liked most of the dishes at the table. 

However, the dumplings, which were a hit at the table, weren't much to my liking and I found the coatings to be thick. The Pla Gra Tiem or the fish in a sauce of black pepper and basil, was my favourite dish of the evening and it paired really well with the Thai smoked Oil and burnt Garlic Rice. 

Of the desserts, the darsaan was as good as it gets. The crisp strips of syrup coated pastry with a dallop of Ice-cream on top was an apt end to a meal which I thoroughly enjoyed.

This restaurant is located at Southern Avenue, near SBI e-corner. We ordered roasted lamb, egg fried rice and chicken in wine sauce and all of these for rs. 909 only. All the dishes were very tasty and the quantity was very much satisfying for two people. The lamb dish was really good! Very soothing and simple interior decoration and the staffs were very polite and helpful.

Please see my review when Asia house had opened, but now thrice I have been disappointed about the quality of food being served. The owners during lunch time are not there & the chef is serving food which is horrible. As most good restaurants which start well & end up ordinary Asia house seems to be going that way.

When the world was still opening itself to the idea of chinese cuisines, Asia House had already unleashed it's charm upon us. When you step into this place at Southern Avenue, the vibe of the place does half of the work for you. Not only does it decide your mood for the meal but also the way you will be judging the food. Asia House has a clean vibe with it's pitch bright and white interiors. Simple and decent, it sets your mood instantly.

Love for Chinese food in Kolkata has always been something on top of the list and Asia House is here to fulfill your delights. Located in the lane next to Lake Kalibari, this place is all you need to make your evenings wonderful. Indeed a family friendly restaurant with clean surroundings, wonderful decor and spacious accommodation.

What's an evening without great drinks?
We started off with the Fresh Lime Soda. Needless to say, the start itself predicted how awesome the food for the rest of the evening was going to be.

Our meal started with the -

1. Shanghai Hawker's Soup : It was a traditional chinese thick soup with tofu, bok choy and mushrooms. They set a perfect tone for the meal. On asking the staff, we were informed that the chinese items were made by a chef from Shanghai exclusively for this restaurant.

2. Asia House Special Chicken Dumplings : Steamed chicken dumplings were topped with their signature sauce made from pan gazed soy and mushrooms. The dumplings had perfect proportion of chicken stuffed in them and went hand in hand with the sauce served alongside. It was perfect.

3.The Hua Hin Highway Rolls : Crispy Thai Rolls were stuffed with vermicelli, kaffir lime, peanuts and roasted chillies. They were both crisp as well as delicious. The spices blended well which gave a very authentic taste and left us wanting for more. The peanuts definitely complimented it. The quality was good and the taste even better.

4. Takrai (fish) : Well, if you are a fish lover, this item is definitely worth a try. Sliced fish was tossed with lemon grass, Thai herbs, bird's eye chilli and coriander making the marination perfect and the dish on point. It tasted absolutely fantastic. The quantity was great and the taste of the fish was so clear and distinct , that the aroma along with the spices came out to be wonderful.

Therefore, putting a fullstop to the superb starters, we moved on the main course. For the mains, we tried their -

5. Pla Gra Tiem : Sliced Fish tossed in black pepper and basil sauce, this dish served as a side dish to the Khao Pad Kratiem which was served along with it. This dish was soulful with the fish cooked to perfection. The basil sauce gave a smooth texture to the gravy making it an absolutely perfect side dish.

6. Egg Khao Pad Kratiem : Burnt Garlic Rice was cooked in Thai smoked oil. This item was an absolute main course and topped up the nutritional quotient. The side dish went well with this simple yet elegant dish to make it taste even better.

7. Chilli Garlic Noodles : This dish as the name suggests was plain yet delicious. It was inclined towards the sweeter side making it overpowering and the side dish that we ordered with it ( Hong Kong Spicy Chicken ) gave an amazing company to it. The noodles wasn't chewy. Inspite of being at a cooler temperature, the noodles wasn't chewy, but soft.

8. Hong Kong Spicy Chicken : This dish was loaded with chicken and had a subtle gravy in comparison to the other dish we had ordered. Both had a different flavour though. The chicken pieces were decent enough and were juicy too. It went best with the Noodles and we totally loved it.

Asia House has also introduced Signature Bowls which are a perfect delight. I'll mention a few of them which I loved.

📍 Indonesian Bakso : It provides a choice of Dimsums ( Chicken/ Pork) , accompanied with lime, pepper and steamed rice. The major constituents summing up a spicy as well as a sweet broth. The authentic aroma with the spices blending perfectly is a treat to the tongue as well.

📍 Chef's Late Night Bowl : It provides the choice of Chicken or Fish or Pork or Lamb. The meat served with stur fried rice, crispy noodles and fried egg, this delicacy is a hit.

📍 Vietnamese Pho : Traditional Vietnamese soup with rice noodles, bean sprouts, bok choy, coriander, spring onions, basil, lettuce, being its major ingredients, this wholesome bowl is absolutely a brilliant dish with a classic twist of Vietnamese and is decent enough to gulp too.

📍 A Chinese Lost in Burma : This bowl consists of dimsums dipped in a bowl of hot and sweet curry with crispy noodles and poached egg. With the catchy name and the presentation on point, one will definitely develop a liking for it at first sight.

These bowls are Ajinamoto free and yes, they are themselves a full dish with each bowl serving two people surely.

Finally we were served with the desserts at the end of the enormous meal.

9. Darsan with icecream : Deep fried flour crisps were tossed with burnt honey sauce and white sesame seeds and they were served with icecream. The icecream had a perfect flavour of vanilla. The darsan was soft, crispy as well as luscious. The darsan was on the sweeter side, though but the taste was unique. We absolutely loved it.

This place serves huge quantities and quality food. The service is appropriate and the staff co-ordinates well too. Appreciated. Not only does the taste woo you, but even the prices won't burn a hole in your pocket. This place has a huge potential and hence, it is a must for all chinese food lovers.

Recommended.

CHINA INVADES INDIA

at

Asia House, 17A, Lake View Road, Lake Terrace, Southern Avenue

at 

FOOD TASTING @ ASIA HOUSE (COURTESY ENTREPRENEUR VARUN RAJGARHIA)

Well, the Chinese have finally managed to invade India and not only invade, they have managed to set up a huge “camp” under the name and design “Asia House” at Southern Avenue! And quite to our delight, they offer not only outstanding Chinese cuisines, but PAN-ASIAN cuisines!

Asia House, quite commensurate to it’s name – serves authentic ASIAN cuisines, although, this tasting was more inclined towards their Chinese (as well as Thai) stuff!

Size of the place is huge (the sofa sets and standalone chairs can easily accommodate 35 odd heads) – so, you need not be bothered about a comfortable seating even if you are bringing your family along!

The “basket” shaped lighting and bulbs suspended using rope light sets atop do catch your attention!

A warm welcome by the steward as well as all other attendants does make you feel quite at home! Lighting is deliberately kept dim at one half and bright at the other to maintain a soothing ambience, although this does not impact one’s dining experience!

Now, coming over to the most important part – FOOD !!!!!!!!

(i) Shanghai Hawkers soup – Could not have asked for a better appetizer – a ton of thanks for those tiny tofu cheese cubes as well as the Chinese bok choy cabbage leaves! 

(ii) Asia House Special dumplings – A very generic starter prepared in a special manner, this was made in pan glazed soya sauce (and thus had a blackish gravy) as well as mushrooms – definitely a winner – especially when had with their signature sweet and spicy sesame topped sauce!

(iii) Crispy Babycorns – The name states it all, do I at all need to elaborate? If yes, then my answer would be that they should initiate “Babycorn preparation” coaching classes!

(iv) Hua Hin Highway Rolls:- Don’t know where on the map Hua Hin is, but definitely know that this one was lovely, low on oil content, high on taste and rich on vermicelli as well as peanut stuffing (just imagine the peanut crunch on a roll-bite).

(v) Veg Pak Pad Kraprow – A wide range of thai chilli basil vegetables with lemongrass and burnt chilli paste – this one combined as a nice side dish with rice, noodles – but was remarkably tasty when standalone had also!

(vi) Veg Khao Pad Krotiem – One of the better rice palates you will ever eat – especially when curated with burnt garlic and topped with generous amounts of coriander and corn! Trust me when I say that even after eating almost the entire rice bowl, I was still craving for more! This one does fill your tummy as well as your heart as well as the soul!

(vii) Veg Chilli garlic noodles – A big thank you to the chef for preparing a veg noodles of this caliber – indeed one of the best in my recent past – 2 things doing the trick for me – the sweetness imparted by the sweet ketchup used in its making and the decent chopped vegetable content!

(viii) Darsaan with vanilla ice cream – Who thought that there would be such a fine balance of honey content in this crispier than crisp darsaan – imparting it just the optimum sweetness – neither low, nor high! They did perfect justice to our taste buds when had with the vanilla ice cream scoops!

(ix) Ice cream sandwich – This one, their signature desserts - vanilla ice cream stuffed between couple of chocolate layers and topped with roasted crispy cashew nuts as well as chocolate sauce – could not have had a happier ending.

(x) Fresh lime soda (sweet  salt mixed) – The only item in the entire tasting event, which felt below my expectations – since the soda had lost all it’s fizz and the same was not cold when served. Understanding my dissatisfaction, they served me a modest Thumbs Up soft drink, which helped me digest all the above!

Pocket pinch, again is commensurate to what they serve – both in terms of quality as well as quantity – and you get your every penny’s worth! Their market-standing can be understood by the fact that there was no dearth of any dine-in or home delivery customers even on Thursday, a weekday, when we had paid them a visit!

Kudos to king blogger Krishanu Das for this invite!

For all those confused souls, who were in two minds to visit this place or not – hope my review would open your minds, your eyes as well as your mouths, so that you can cherish heavenly fodder!

The Indian subcontinent being a part of Asia itself, it is not a surprise that Asian cuisine plays such a big role in our everyday lives. Be it Chinese, Thai, Burmese, Vietnamese or Malaysian, these dishes occupy a big part of our diet and we have grown accustomed to them by now. Additionally, by the meticulous use of various spices, other ingredients and cooking techniques, we have given this cuisine our own twists and incorporated them into our daily consumption. As the popularity grew, so did the demand for Asian cuisine and in response, several outlets serving up such cuisine have sprung up all over the city of joy. Asia House is a pretty recognizable name when one talks about the Asian food scene of the city of joy and my recent visit to the restaurant let me know exactly why. Located in the heart of Southern Avenue, Asia House joins a plethora of eateries in the said location(you will find a new place to eat in every corner of Southern Avenue) but clearly manages to stand out from the rest. Lets talk about my recent visit. 

The restaurant is spacious and clean and will easily accommodate a large number of people. I do have to point out that one half of the restaurant is better lit than the other. Seating is comfortable and the ambiance is family friendly. Asia House lives up to its name by serving a large  number of cuisines from Asian countries- you can find Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Singaporean, Burmese and Malaysian food in their menu, which gives you a large assortment of dishes to choose from. Once you have made up your mind, you are obviously in for a treat because their food is hearty and filling and  most importantly delicious. We also learned that the chef hails from Shanghai himself. 

Lets talk about all that we tried now. 

Shanghai Hawkers Soup- Traditional Chinese thick soup with chicken, mushrooms and bok choy. The vegetarian option has tofu instead of chicken. Thick soup served piping hot with generous serving of chicken, mushrooms and bok choy made for a good start to a great meal. 

Asia House Special Dumplings- Plump, juicy and full of filling, these dumplings made for yet another great starter. The signature sauce made it even tastier. Also comes in both vegetarian and chicken options. 

Hua Hin Highway Rolls- Thai crispy rolls stuffed with vermicelli, kaffir lime, peanuts, roasted chillies and chicken/vegetables. Crispy, hot and with a generous and delicious filling, this was definitely my favorite starter. 

Fish Takrai- Fish tossed in lemongrass, thai  herbs, bird's eye chilli and coriander. Soft and crispy on the outside pieces of fish cooked to perfection and tossed in a delicious red gravy. Really worth going back for. 

Pla Gra Tiem- Sliced fish tossed in black pepper and basil sauce. Soft succulent fish pieces in a very delicious sauce, the pepperiness of which was my favorite bit about it. 

Hong Kong Sweet and Spicy Chicken- Chicken in a sweet and spicy gravy with dry chilli, sliced ginger and chilli paste made for quite the delicious main course. The chicken itself was soft and juicy and the gravy lifted the dish to a whole new level of deliciousness. 

Stir Fried Chicken with cashew nuts- A less spicy chicken in gravy dish garnished with cashew nuts. Yet another tasty main course dish. 

Pak Pad Krapow- Thai Chilli Basil vegetables with lemongrass and burnt chilli paste. Spicy and tasty especially due to the use of lemongrass which made it smell really great as well. 

Khao Pad Kratiem- Thai smoked oil and burnt garlic rice that came in both vegetarian and egg options. As I am a big fan of fried rice, this dish was the perfect accompaniment to all those main gravy dishes for me. 

Chilli Garlic Noodles- Basic chilli garlic noodles which were full of flavour but a tad bit too dry in my  opinion and genuinely craving gravy to be eaten with. 

Darsaan with Ice Cream- Deep fried flour crisps tossed with burnt honey sauce and white sesame seeds. Sticky and crispy these tasted beautiful with ice cream. Also I may be a bit biased towards this cause I am a sucker for desserts. 

Ice Cream Sandwich- We also ordered the classic Ice Cream Sandwich and it was delicious. Nothing can ever go wrong with this dish. 

We devoured all this delicious food with the help of fresh lime soda and soft drinks which they also serve. 

Hopefully by the end of this review, I have convinced you to pay Asia House a visit. What I have tried was only a tiny fraction of their immensely vast menu and I will certainly be back to try out more. Thank you for the invite

We had some sweet corn soup and sweet chilly mushroom, and the preparations are very good. Will come back for some non veg dishes.
The people serving are very friendly and even packed for me on request some hot and sweet garlic sauce which they prepare in house.

It was a sudden plan and suddenly this restaurant came to my mind. It is easy to locate and the place didn't disappoint me either. When we entered the restaurant it was fully empty and we chose our place to sit. The staffs were generous and polite and they kept asking about the taste and preparation of the dishes whether we like or not. Coming to the food, in the starter we order for Chilli Roast Pork which was damn tasty. It was my first time of trying pork but I loved it to the utmost level. In the main course we ordered for Chicken fried rice with Kung Pao Chicken & Sliced fish tossed in chili wine sauce. The fish was soft and good to eat but the chicken was the best. The flavor taste with cashew nuts was mouth lickering. The amount of food was also quite good. In the deserts section, we opt for Chocolate Brownie with ice cream. It was tasty and perfect to end the lunch 😘 Overall it was a good experience and the pocket pinch for two was around rs1450. Foodies should visit this place to try out other tasty foods here as provides different sorts of Asian food. 😊

Pleasantly surprised by my dinner yesterday. The place isn't very big but is designed well, love the Chinese painting and calligraphy on the wall.

 Staff was warm and friendly, the food that I ordered was:

Basil fried rice : spicy and yet flavorful and the quantity was really really good

Kung pao chicken : the taste was nice, just the chicken was slightly over cooked. But it tasted nice 

Mee Goreng : really tasty and again good Portion size. A little less oil could help 

Roasted lamb : really well cooked and was complimenting the rice well. Absolutely loved it.

Overall a good experience. Will come back again soon!!

Had visited this place sometime back. Was pleasantly taken aback with the sheer range of the menu. It truly covers most of Asia barring the Indian subcontinent)
The service was great and so was the food.
Ordered the Indonesian Bakso, the Asia House Wok tossed, the Kai Pad Kraprow, the Khao Pad Kratiem and the fried ice cream. 
The prices were pretty reasonable and absolutely justifiable. Really excited about visiting this place again to try out the other dishes.

Food was good but behavior of one staff was very rude... specialy near to end of our dinner. Advise to management new customers are important for you but those who are on table to finish their food they r equally important to you. Please change your staff immediately...Same problem I had faced for last 2 times...

update 20-aug: we gave it a shot second time and got ourselves asia house special dumplings, hong kong sweet and spicey chicken and khao pad kratiem rice. one thing which first came to my notice is the amount per serving - its huge! a portion of rice could easily serve me, my wife and my 10yr old son! the dumpling was very tasty specially because some kind of herbs were spread on it which made the aroma finger-licking good! the chicken was nice, except the fact that the coating was a bit thick. overall, very satisfied with the food and this time the delivery is super quick. no doubt they have invested in quality and crm (customer relationship management), resulting into happy customers like me :)

planning to visit the restaurant. all the best, asia house!!

------------------------

                        i love thai food and wanted to try out asia house. so, opted for home delivery and ordered:
egg hakka noodles - good amount, can serve two. noodles were not too thick.
mixed fried rice - standard item, nothing fancy.
kung pao fish - with cashewnuts, but can count them easily as only a few were there :D
chicken xao - with lemongrass, this was good.
chicken lat me kai - it was spicy.
food was ok. what turned me off was the delivery. took almost 2 hours to reach me where as i am in jadavpur and they are near golpark. everytime called them, they said their delivery boy had left long back but nobody was able to contact him. later, when the delivery boy finally reached us, he said he left the restaurant just 20min back!! so, couldn't figure out who lied.
advise to whoever wants to try them out - always opt for COD if using home delivery. i used credit card to prepay and had to wait for the order for 2hrs and couldn't cancel.

It is mind blowing to see the number of restaurants, that have come up in the city today, serving Oriental food of the highest quality. Till a few years back, if one would want some good Chinese food, the options were limited and available in pockets of the city like Park Street, Tangra to name a few. But today it seems that you need not look far, cause the neighbouring restaurant might be serving some of the best Oriental food that one would like to get his or her hands on. And, Asia House is certainly one of those neighbourhood restaurants. Amazing food, some of the best that I have ever experienced . I do wish them all the best in their endeavours and I hope they keep serving us the same way in the years to come. Oriental cuisine... so good that you find it hard to describe in words. Each item was unique in its own way. This experience just left us wanting for more and for sure we will get more in the future.

After seeing such good reviews and ratings on zomato decided to visit this place for dinner with my family today.. And guess what this food joint made our day..😍

Location :- Lake view road.. just 2mins walk from Lake kalibari.. This place is well located with ample space for parking... quite easily accessible from southern avenue...

Service :- The staffs were polite and courteous.. The place being empty the time we entered so the service was prompt and they took good care and kept on asking if we liked the dishes or need anything more...

Ambience :- it's a small and cozy joint with max 30 accommodation at a time.. white painted walls wit Chinese signs.. white porcelain cutlery.. perfectly lit.. overall a perfect ambience with Good music on background...

Food :- Now coming to the food..

1) Drums of Heaven (oriental) :- simply lipsmacking.. it was perfect.. The best doh I have had in years... (5/5)

2) khao pad kratiem :- it's a Thai dish.. perfect blend of spices with gondhoraj leaves.. It was superb.. (5/5)

3) mixed schezwan fried rice :- It was also good.. The quantity of each dish were huge... more than enough for two... can perfectly suffice two very hungry souls..

4) seafood fried rice :- once again a good rice with sufficient amount for two.. goes really well with the Thai side dish..

5) chocolate brownie with ice cream :- this was the show stealer.. 😍 wow.. The taste.. its was simply yummy... will keep you craving for more and more...

Overall a perfect place.. and the pocket pinch is also not high.. The prices have changed by 10 to 20 rs.. its not updated in zomato yet...

Total pocket pinch for 4 of us including 2 mixed rice Parcel was 2000..😀

Foodies do visit this place if you really love Asian cuisine.. bcz it's not only Chinese it serves all sorts of Asian delicacies.. keep eating..😍

I LOVED THIS PLACE.
The décor, the ambience, the service and above all the food was just amazing.
Was really surprised that such a wonderful restaurant had no other customer except us for close to two and a half hours. Please visit this place if you support their effort of serving authentic Asian cuisine of mind-boggling variety.
We were three people and we ordered the following :
Beverages :
Fresh Lime Soda
Iced Tea
Starters :
Vietnamese Rice Paper Rolls (chicken)
Honey glazed chilli pork.
Mains :
Chicken Mee Goreng (noodle-based staple)
Hot basil fried rice (veg)
Xao sa ot (fish preparation)
Sweet Garlic Lamb
Dessert :
Didn't have any space for it :)

Each and every item tasted divine. The portions were more than sufficient.
My favourite item was the Vietnamese Rice paper rolls which were succulent steamed dimsums with a refreshing filling of vermicelli, chicken and peanuts. I can go back for this particular dish forever. The pork was good too, chunky pieces of lean pork in a Chinese gravy with bell peppers and onions.
I personally liked the subtle Thai flavours of the basil rice more than the pungent flavour of the Mee Goreng, but I like my Oriental dishes a little light and non-spicy ; so that could be the reason.
For the same reason I preferred the light and refreshing Xao Sa Ot, with the subtle flavour of Kaffir Lime and lemongrass coming through over the robust flavours of the lamb in a sweet tasting garlic sauce. But, each and every dish was delectable.
Do visit this place. You won't be disappointed.

It is a small space, cute and cozy.
I am a fan of the chef's special dumplings. Had two servings, one with pork and another with chicken.
The chicken khawsuey was near authentic and very coconut-y in a nice way. 
The Thai fried rice was bursting with flavors. I wouldn't need anything to accompany it really. Still ordered the lamb with basil and lemongrass. Unfortunately, the lamb was too salty for my taste. Any points I took away was for the lamb and the absence of any hot beverages on the menu. East and south-east Asian cuisine without a warm cup of tea is never really complete.
As for dessert, the pumpkin pudding with a side of ice cream was the highlight of the meal. Completely refreshing and perfectly balanced between sweet and salty. Recommend.

Perhaps the best Asian cuisine available in the area. Quality and quantity both do justice to the price they charge. Thai red curry and Malayasian Curry are scrumptious. I have tried the fish variant. Black pepper basil sauce prawn / fish is too good. I have been there and ordered online as well. Taste of food remains same which is highly commendable. Haven't tried too many starters, just tried prawn dimsum which was good.

This place is a perfect example of how looks can be deceiving. A small joint in one corner or lake view road, this place whips up the most amazing Chinese fare. I had the garlic pepper chicken starter, mixed meifoon and General Tao's pork. The chicken starter had a hint of pepper overdose but the meifoon and the pork were brilliant. The meifoon was done just right and the pork was melt in your mouth.
The ambience and service were pretty amazing as well. Definitely visiting again!!

First of all, I have to make it clear that this review is solely based on the food. It was special as after a hard day at work, I got my dinner delivered at my place and that too with some mouth watering delicacies. All thanks goes to the owner Varun Rajgarhia who arranged everything for me.

Now the food -

I requested the owner to choose the dishes for me and I must say he had a nice choice -

1. Hua hin highway rolls chicken - It's a type of Thai chicken spring roll with a twist. Smooth, light, crisp- crackly skin covers the filling of chicken, vermicelli, chilli and Thai herbs. It is served with dipping sauce. It was delicious.

2. Spinach & black pepper dumplings chicken - Puréed spinach that replaced part of the water of the dough made a thin soft covering with a filling of chicken, spring onion, black pepper. This appetising dumplings just melted within my mouth.

3. Spicy chilli oil dumplings chicken - Light red colored dumplings with chicken filling served with spicy red chilli sauce with Chinese black vinegar & chilli oil and tasted average.

4. Pla Gra Tiem - Fresh and soft sliced fish cooked in thai garlic,black pepper and basil sauce. It was scrumptious.

5. Thai burnt garlic rice egg - Sautéeing the garlic till brown gives this rice preparation it's unique flavour. Together with green chillies, egg and soya sauce, burnt garlic lends an exciting touch to perfectly cooked rice. It is garnished with basil leaves, fried garlic and tasted amazing with pla gra tiem.

Overall it was an amazing experience indeed. One thing I have to mention that the delivery was bang on time.

Calcutta and the multitudes of its culinary stories.  The evolving stories of food is evolving with Kolkata and Kolkata now no longer remain a hub for only Chinese food – Asian cuisine has steadily evaded and made a place for itself making Kolkatan palates crave for much more. making its way into the food scene . A latest addition to the Pan Asian Food scene in the city is the Asia House.
                    

Location : The address reads 17A LAKE VIEW ROAD. This restaurant  is located close to the Lake Kali Bari. Take the lane beside Birla Institute and it’s a stones throw distance on the left side.

Decor and Ambience : The place is located at the ground floor of a typical south Kolkata residence. The whitewashed walls of the exterior gives it a very Japanese feel. The interiors are enthralling  with white as the backdrop which gives a serene ambience. The pretty uncomplicated decor is very soothing to look at. The white washed walls with Chinese writings in red on the pillar , the handmade baskets up the ceiling and the wall hangings and artsy frames strikes your eye and gives it a very rustic Asian food feel.

Food : Asia House is a take on  modern Asian cuisine. It serves a plethora of Asian delicacies which includes Chinese, Thai, Burmese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malaysian, Singaporean and Hong Kong cuisine.

If you like Chinese and looking for a good Chinese restaurant then Asia House will be the perfect destination for you. The place located in Lake View road, near Southern Avenue. The place is famous for their mouth-watering Chinese preparation. They serve not only Chinese but also, Thai, Burmese Vietnamese, Malaysian, Indonesian & Singaporean dishes too. The decoration is simple yet very nice, and the ambiance is very peaceful. The place can accommodate 20-25 person at a time. Recently they launch their Summer at The House Menu, and they arrange a bloggers meet up for this special event.  At first we all are welcomed by a glass of fresh lime soda which was very cool & refreshing. After some time we had, Asia house’s spicy seafood soup which was very delicious as well as very healthy.
After that we tried the special Summer at The House Menu, in which they served,
Asia House Special Dumplings – Steamed dumplings which was prepared with wheat based flour wrapper, wrapped a portion of minced chicken meat with spices. Served over a piece of banana leaf topped with signature sauce which was extremely delicious & spicy made from Asian prunes & shrimps. If you love momos and dumplings then you have to try these.

Hua Hin Highway Rolls – Minced chicken meat putted inside the rolls and it was deep fried in oil. Outer layer was super crunchy as well as inside portion was soft and flavourful. It was stuffed with vermicelli, little bit of kaffir lime, peanuts and roasted chilies. This is a very famous Thai preparation. The chili & honey based sauce was just perfect with it.

Jiang’s pan fried fish – It was a fish preparation, fish pieces are tossed with chef’s special signature dark soy sauce & star anise sauce with kaffir lime, chopped onion & bell peppers along with little bit of chopped ginger & lots of garlic. Coming to taste it was mouth-watering, sauces are perfectly coated the pieces of fish, little bit spicy as well as sweeter. The taste was really good.

Indonesian Chili Chicken – it was a dry preparation, sliced of chicken pieces are tossed in chili sambal oelek sauce made with varieties of chilies, shrimp paste, fish oil along with other ingredients. Later on used extra bit of scallions and green peppers. Served with sprinkled sesame seeds & crushed nuts. It was spicy and very soft. 

After soup and mouth-watering starters we tried the main course preparation. We had,

Wan Chai’s Midnight Chicken – A delicious preparation with a unique name. The name is quite interesting as it was served in the streets of Shanghai after dark. Diced chicken pieces pan tossed in roasted chili sauce, soy sauce, bell peppers and finished with peanuts. Chicken pieces are perfectly cooked, very soft and tasty. The gravy was look wise dark but it was delicious. A must try dish.
 
Bali Street Vendor’s Stir Fried Fish – Very famous & authentic dish of street vendors of Bali.  Fish pieces marinated and it was stir fried with various types’ sauces like chili sambal sauce, sweet soy sauce with sliced chilies. The gravy was not very thick but it was simply superb in taste, bit spicy one. Fish pieces are very well cooked, very soft and melted in the mouth in no time. A must try for fish lovers.

Saigon Black Pepper & Mushroom Rice – Vietnamese black pepper fried rice with famous Saigon black pepper & chopped fresh mushrooms. Cooked with soy sauce, burnt garlic & peanuts.it has less amount of oil and taste wise very good.

Indonesian Mee Goreng – Famous Indonesian street vendors noodles prepared with homemade sambal oelek sauce along with sweet soy sauce. This is an egg based noodles which has chopped omelette, stir fried vegetables along with one portion of half prepared omelette which has poached egg yolk. Coming to taste noodles are perfectly cooked, the taste was little spicy and tangy.

After having those lip-smacking dishes it was time for desserts, and we tried,

Ice Cream Sandwich – Frozen vanilla ice cream between two chocolaty wafers, and topped with chocolate sauce and roasted cashew nuts. The taste was simply amazing. 

Fried ice cream – Vanilla bean ice cream deep frozen and it was wrapped in sesame paste & coconut flakes. Served with chocolate sauce. Outer layer had a taste of coconut and the inside portion was full of melted Vanilla ice cream. A must try dessert. 

Every preparation we tried was very delicious and nicely cooked. The quality and quantity both were very satisfying. And their warm hospitality made the place very special. This place is a gem for Chinese lovers. If you want to enjoy authentic Chinese Delicacies at very attractive prices then Asia House is your destination. A small place with a delicious surprise.
 Had a great time with team #Panchphoron.

Went there for Sunday lunch with my folks and was not disappointed at all. Its located in the lane just before Birla Academy of Arts , a few buildings away beside the Raymond shop. The decor is beautifully done and minimalist. Now coming to the food , for starters we ordered Chicken takrai and Shanghai Hawkers soup . The chicken takrai had the right amount of spice and tang . The hawkers soup was a bit salty but tasty nevertheless. For main course we went for their speciality Khao Pad Kratiem , kung pao chicken and Mee Goreng. Each dish was delicious and had a distinct flavour profile . Though there is one suggestion that I would like to make , the chicken pieces that they serve both in main course gravy and starter are smaller than the other asian restaurants I have been too , they should improve on it cause quantity does matter along with quality . All in all , this place is a sure destination for lovers of Asian Cuisine and I would surely drop in again .

In search of something different, we got this nearby. Quite small restaurant. Perhaps 7-8 tables of four pax each. Food wise not disappointing at all. Shanghai hawker's thick soup is really good. Being the first timer, they suggested me to take tarkai chicken as starter. Crispy, sweet & spicy, mouthwatering taste. General Tao's chicken is ok with Khao Pad Kratiem Mixed Fried Rice. My personal opinion. They should try to improve the taste of fried rice in a different way. Perhaps they are said to be MSG free. We took a starter again at the end. Sui Mai Chicken Dimsums. Cute little bag like shape. Price is mid range. Quantity is good. Service is good though a bit late but staffs are very courteous. Hope to visit once more until a pathbreaking Chinese one!

Asia House, a supposed authentic Asian restaurant. Could easily be located. Ambience is going to have little role in the time you spend here, not much to offer. The staffs are really nice and friendly. 
Now coming to the food, I ordered Asia House Wok Tossed Pork, recommended by them. It had a tangy flavor, however I felt the meat was a little stiff to my liking, to which the manager had a valid clarification that they do this in order to avoid the nice fat of the pig-meat to get cooked. For main course we had Mixed Hakka Noodles which I liked the most;along with Kung Pao Chicken which wasn't too bad but not great. Quantity is not an issue, the amount is more than enough for two people. 0.5 additional points for the amiable nature of the guys attending us.. Can be better.

I came across this place from the 'Great Chinese' collection of zomato and trust me it's really one of the many great places to enjoy Chinese in Kolkata.
The Ambience was decent taking into consideration that its a small joint.
We were warmly welcomed and the staff was courteous and asked as multiple times if we liked the food or not.
Coming to the food
We had mixed fried rice and kung pao chicken.
The quantity and quality both were great, like we thought we would have to order again but we were full by the time we finished it.
For dessert we had Fried Ice Cream and it was made to perfection.
Being a Chinese lover I really liked this place and the expense was also reasonable.
Would love to visit again.@

A warm welcome from the staffs. The inner ambience is really good. Staffs are well behaved. I will give extra plus point for the service.
The soothing music goes very well with the wall decor.
Now coming to food, though it was my first visit, bt am really impressed. Food quality n preparation is good. Only the pork quality should be little bit soft.
Otherwise all r quite good

After much waiting finally went to Asia house..I visited China Wok another franchise of this group..thus got a sudden surprise treat which made me visit this place..
Thanks Varun for all things..
Kolkata has seen a growing trend in Asian cuisines in the last few years..Where Asia House at southern avenue is one such which I find to be the best..
At fist it was a lunch treat from the team which was was good, and this Friday I went there to check out some of the house special items..
Asian Mushroom soup with prawn 
Mixed fried rice 
Chef's secret Sauce.
The taste was too good..the way it's been cooked and served us made me click alot of photos ..

Good food. Even better service. This is what Asia house turned out for me. I had mee goreng which is Indonesian styled noodles and Asia house wok tossed. I am not very fond of spicy food but boy I loved the noodle. The friendly staff is all the more reason to go back there. A nice little addition to the culinary world of the city!

Asia House is a recently opened place in the Southern Avenue neighborhood and promises good Asian cuisine, where dishes, other than just the Chinese cuisine, like Burmese, Chinese, Malaysian, Vietnamese can be tried. The simple ambience is very soothing and ensures a pleasant dining experience. Seating arrangement of the restaurant is for around 25-30 people at a time. The restaurant is decorated with lots of wooden buckets attached from the ceiling and enlightened with a variety of fancy lights and hand painted walls. The menu is exciting since you get the entire Asian deal here. The quality of the ingredients, taste of the food as well as the portion size is equally impressive.

hi everyone…. this summer when all of us are being baked by the Sun can we give a break to our Moms or to those cooks who cook for your home everyday and give ourselves and our friends and family a treat at the four month old kitchen of the city called #AsiaHouse…

from the name itself you can understand what kind of food they serve.. Basically they serve Chinese, Thai, Burmese and Vietnamese food… But my recommendation is not only for the food but also for the ambiance and the pricing of the food…very reasonable… and one more thing don’t forget to take the photograph of the swich board and post that on instagram as that’s of that Brittish era..

Now let me come to the MUST TASTE FOOD from the Menu :

ASIAN MUSHROOM SOUP (MIXED) – it’s basically thick flavored asian soup with fresh mushroom and spring onion

ASIA HOUSE SPECIAL DUMPLINGS – steamed dumplings served with chef’s secret sauce

PAN TOSSED FISH WITH SCHEZWAN SAUCE, SMOKED CHILLIES & PEANUTS – it’s actually stir fried sweet and spicy meat cooked with chillies and peanuts

SLICED CHICKEN WITH ASIAN BOK CHOY IN CHILLI WINE SAUCE – this is basically sliced chicken cooked with Asian bok choy and chinese cooking wine

GENERAL TAO’S SLICED FISH – this is a Burmese recipe where sliced fishes tossed in a chilli honey sauce

NASI GORENG – this is Indonesian Fried Rice..choice is yours you want to have it with veggies or only with egg or chicken or pork all all in one I mean Mixed.

THAI CHILLI BASIL NOODLES – once again choice is yours..but as a Foodie, I’ll suggest you to go for the Mixed one…

FRIED ICE CREAM – they will serve you vanilla Ice Cream rolled in coconut crumbs and deep fried serving with yummie chocolate sauce…

DAARSHAAN WITH ICE CREAM – they serve deep frie
d crispy flour strips tossed in honey and sesame with Vanilla Ice Cream

That’s all for now…

for the address please take help from Google..

Happy Tummy in advance..

Simplest thing that makes someone smile? – Food. And being a Chinese food lover, Thai, Burmese and Vietnamese are just added to my list of favorites. So, we went on to ‘Asia House’, near Southern Avenue, which is just a gem of restaurant for Asian Food.  Delicacies from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia as well as Chinese, Burmese and Thai are served here.  A restaurant with a seating capacity of around 25-30 people at a time, decorated with lots of wooden buckets attached from the ceiling  and enlightened with a variety of fancy lights and hand painted walls. So we headed up to our destination with my foodie fellows for our food tasting session.  The decorations already impressed us and the ambiance was quite good. The food was served in utensils all the way from South Asia

At first let's take a moment and thank our host "Asia House" for such a wonderful experience.

It was a Wednesday evening and I being on a vacation at Kolkata decided to have delicious

Chinese food(though far-eastern food I must say). So gave a call to my beloved friends and

asked for a suggestion from Rajdip da. As always he came up with this wonderful venue

i.e. Asia House at Southern Avenue and that was the beginning of this delightful experience.

Every single thing was well maintained and ambiance was more enjoyable with the song "Hotel California"..

Let's talk about food. Maravilloso!!! Sabroso!!!

It was a new bunch of items they came up with, named "Summer at the house".

Now I'm gonna list down the name of the dishes and #MannKiBaat of my taste buds :D

1. Asia House specia dumplings: You may call it soup, I call it a masterpiece of chicken, herbs and prawns. Don't miss it.

2. Hua Hin Highway Rolls: Well, it's a kind of chicken spring roll, served with ketchup dip. The surprise is,

     it has aroma of aromatic lime(Gandhoraj lebu). Very crispy and tasty!!

3. Jiang's Pan fried fish: For me chinese cuisine is incomplete without a delicious fish recipe.

             Very delicious and spicy.

4. Indonesian Chilli chicken: Chilli chicken at its best. Well cooked, spicy gravy, goes very well with noodles.

5. Wan Chai's midnight chicken: Go for it. Trust me, this recipe and fried rice are made for each other :)

6. Bali Street vendors' stir fried fish: I thought of one fish recipe but got two :D , the gravy was so tasty

      though the name contains the word "street" .. loved it a lot :)

7. Indonesian Mie Goreng: Fried noodles with minced chicken and garnished with poached egg above it..

     cut a foil from the poached egg, wrap chicken pieces and some noodles wiht that and

     enjoy :D

8. Fried Ice cream: Dessert starts from here. Ball shaped and stuffed with tender coconut, served with cream

      and liquid chocolate. There's a surprise inside it, I'm not gonna reveal, you have to

             pay a visit and find out :D

9. Ice cream sandwich: Served with chocolate sauce and once you finish eating, you are still left with

         cream and chocolate mixture.. Finish asap,  before your friends jump over it   :D

Me and my friends really loved this place and looking forward to pay another visit next time.. Till then will cherish
these lovely memories... :) 

Thank you so much...

Happy eating... :D

This place has a decent decor and the staff is also verry sweet and polite 
Now coming to the food today it was Vietnamese food time 
Spicy Vietnamese noodle salad-was not at all spicy for some reason it was sweet and wet 
Vietnamese pho-the famous pho well it had a verry strong smell and taste of lemongrass and no other flavour other than that the soup was good 
Vietnamese rice paper rolls-this was not at all good had no taste or flavours only tasted like raw vegetables not at all good 
Xao sa ot-this was the only dish which kept me happy this is verry much like chill chicken which we eat but with its own taste it was really good nice and fresh flavoured kept me happy 
Overall not at all happy with my food


So after reading my review the owner himself contacted me and was not at all happy with the food that I had got and apologised, @to make it up he then later send me two of his best dishes from the Thai menu which to my surprise was far better than my 1st experience and was flavourful and had a balance of flavours 
Hence I changed my opinion and rating of this place

I would suggest everyone to not to judge this place by their simple decor and lack of space.Their dishes make up for it big time. For the starters i would recommend the Asian barbecue pork and the takrai. I loved their main course chicken dish with Bok Choy(Chinese Cabbage) . The fried ice cream with a touch of coconut tasted real nice and overall their price was very reasonable. Would love to visit again

Poila Boisakh evening, tried our luck with Cuisines from the Orient at the Asia House. Firstly the place can be a bit tricky to locate, as is the case with most of the upcoming restaurants in and around Southern Avenue. The ambience is warm but the area is too small and there was a tremendous rush due to the festive mood. Nevertheless the staffs were jovial and helpful. We ordered Pad Thai noodles which was tangy tasty but way too spicy. We just loved their Taipei fish and Kung pao chicken,brilliant indeed. The prices are very reasonable which is one of the USP of this place. Their crowd management skills needs to be honed up. They were really at a mess while serving a few take away orders. Also they missed out on these orders while providing the bill, which I corrected while paying. Overall a mixed experience. Would like to visit them in future on a less crowdy day maybe.

After making an online order which was supposed to be delivered by 10.26 pm. It is 11.41 pm and i am still waiting for delivery. There is no helpline and the restaurant claims there is traffic and the delivery person is stuck in it. Clear breach of contract since payment has been made and perhaps the worst service delivery ever. 

Update on 02 may 2017:

After the false start and no food and my review, received a call from the owner who had perhaps read this review. While there was not much that could be done about the sorry experience, he delivered the same items the very next day so i could review the food.

The tausi chicken was nice with big chunky pieces, not submerged in gravy but having just the right amount of sauce. Not too spicy, not too excessive but quite right. The rice too was quite good and the quantity justified the price.

The attitude of the owner was humble, he was willing to listen and have a dialogue on what went wrong. Despite the false experience the first day, management showed they were open to feedback and willing to change.

Hoping for better experiences going forward.

Extremely bad service, inadequate staff and tasteless food. What came as crispy fried noodles was a mashed pulp and the chicken in oyster sauce tasted like a chicken chutney. They don't even have adequate cutlery and crockery if footfall suddenly increases. For three of us there were only two plates and my wife had to eat from the serving plate. They apologized but to what avail? It is a take away joint and they should remain like that. Three customers complained along with me and they had the same experience.

Ordered Pad Thai noodles and dimsums. The noodles were yum, although a bit on the spicy side. The asia house special chicken dumplings were great!

Kolkatan never get bored of Chinese food and never stopped to appreciate those. which is why so many Chinese restaurants have managed to become so successful in the city. The most talked about upcoming addition to this list of Chinese restaurants is Asia House -Pan Asian Cuisine. We got the chance to get a glimpse of what the restaurant has in store for us. The best part, which also sets this restaurant apart from any other Chinese restaurant is that it doesn’t only focus on Chinese cuisine. It is truly a Pan Asian restaurant with dishes ranging from Malay, Thai, Burmese, Vietnamese, Malaysian, Indonesian, Singaporean cuisines.The space is elegant, comfortable and inviting. The start are warm, helpful and unobtrusive. Flavorsome food with interesting texture. The chef has obviously put a lot of thought in his creations. As we walked into Asian House, we were immediately seduced by both the aroma of the tantalising smells wafting through the restaurant, as well as by the excited murmur of happily munching clients. The interior is both smart and trendy, and gave both a happening vibe with a balanced sense of a cozy intimacy. The restaurant’s decor is impeccably chic with lots of natural light, minimalistic with hints of the perfect Asian theme.The look, the scents, the atmosphere, the menu all tell you that if you are looking for authentic Pan Asian flavours, you have come to the right place.

We went here on a mildly-sultry day in April '17 for dinner. Of the things we had was Shanghai Hawkers Soup which was good, the sweet honey glazed Keongs Sweet n Spicy chicken was very nice, specially on the crispy edges, the Mixed Meifoon was soft, light and wholesome, and the KaiGra was all right. The small but elegant ambience was very nice, and also the simple artwork on the wall, deserves a mention. Last, but not the least, the host were very hospitable (if only they wouldnt stop us in our discussion so many times, because we were already so late that night, i'm sure they werent trying to be rude, but unfortunately kind of panned out thatway). Surely would visit again sometime.

Asia House is a new gem, which offers Oriental delicacies , which are msg free and healthy located at Lake View Road, Southern Avenue , Kolkata.

Ambience  & decor -  moderately spaced of about 25-30 people, ambience is very soothing and decor is unique. Simple things are put together to create an impressive interior decor, which has an Asian touch. Lighting is fab too.

Staffs & Service - Staffs are courteous, well behaved and service is prompt.

We Panchphoron team went on a food tasting event on 6/3/2017, we had the following - 

Soups & Starters - 

1) Vietnamese pho ( chicken )

2) Asian Mushroom soup ( chicken )

3)Sui Mai ( chicken )

4)Pla Sad Takrai 

5)Indonesian Chicken Satay

Mains - 

1) Kai Pad Kraprow

2) Sliced Fish in chef's secret sauce

3) Khao pad kratiem ( chicken )

4) Chilli Garlic Noodles ( egg ) 

Desserts - 

1)Darsaan with icecream 

2) Fried ice cream 

All the dish were up to the mark and nicely cooked.

My top favourites were -

1) Asian Mushroom soup ( chicken ) - It is thick ginger flavoured Asian soup with mushrooms & spring onions.It was generously filled and was lip smacking.

2)Pla sad Takrai - Thai crispy fish tossed with lemongrass, bird's eye Chilli, coriander and Thai herbs . Fish was so soft that it melted in the mouth and was succulent and yummy. Highly recommended.

3)Sliced Fish in Chef's secret sauce -  It is made from Asian prunes and shrimps was very savoury. Highly recommended.

4) Chilli Garlic egg noodles - was well cooked, spice balanced and was delicious.

5) Fried Icecream -  Fried vanilla ice cream infused with coconut flakes and finished with honey, white sesame and chocolate sauce. This was truly enjoyable and mouth watering. A thing not to miss.

Thanks Asia house for your warm reception.

Loved the honey glazed pork at the restaurant.

Had a detailed telephonic conversation with the owner regarding service issues, so editing the review based on my current experience after food was delivered at home. 
I am really amazed at the amount of effort and care taken by the owner to solve reported issues. Kudos.

Coming back to the food, the chicken in black bean sauce was perfect. Liked the khao pad.
I would look forward to visit once again soon.

"Don't judge this place by its decor n ambience, judge them by the delicacy they serve". The walls n floors of this place is not impressive at all...even the decor is very simple...but what dominates everything is the taste of the food..! We had the following:

#Asian Barbecue lamb- the exotic smoky barbecued lamb in shredded forms were just too good. The tangy taste with garlic chopped adds a nice flavour to the dish. The shredded lamb was meaty, soft n good.

#Chicken Hakka noodles- the shredded pieces of chicken all over the noodles with some veggies tastes good. The quantity was sufficient to serve 2prsns completely.

#Chicken fried rice- rice with spring onions tossed with chicken perfect in taste n cooked till perfection.

#Tausi chicken- chicken pieces cooked in a tangy sauce with cashew nuts n veggies n mushrooms. Good n different in taste that went perfect with the rice n noodles!

#Fried Ice cream- an invention from the chefs recipe. The vanilla Ice cream coated in coconut n sesame paste which is quite crunchy n caramelized from outside while inside stays the chilled vanilla Ice cream which melts down like a chocolava cake...garnished with chocolate sauce n honey n sprinkled sesame seeds...wonderful creation in a whole!

The food was good, the quantity was sufficient, service was generous, the owner was courteous n above all they gave us the Fried Ice cream as complimentary from their side. That simply pampered us. We look forward to visit soon...simply for the taste of food....

As one swallow doesn't make a summer, one bad dinning experience can't  judge a restaurant. Got the food delivered second time. This time ordered items were perfect and to my liking. Veg manchurian was too good. Both the rice and chilli garlic noodles were nice. Normally I go by the reviews posted and was disappointed first time. But second time my faith in reviews was not misplaced. Everyone has a bad day and maybe yesterday was one of those days. Worth trying.

Asia House, is a newly added golden feather in the wonderful collection of great Asian restaurants in Kolkata.
The moment you step in, you will be amazed by the rustic asian decor- cemented floor along with wonderful ceiling decorations.

The menu is quite elaborate. But it is mostly composed of modern Asian cuisine (not the monotonous spicy and oily indo-Chinese).
On several occasions we tried,

SHANGHAI HAWKER'S SOUP (5/5) thick; filled with chicken, tofu, mushroom and veggies; tastes subtle yet delicious.

THREE PEPPER CHICKEN (4/5) crispy chicken chunks fried along with bell peppers in slightly spicy sauce.

TAKRAI (5/5) a must try dish!! Chicken chunks tossed in a tangy sauce with mild basil and curry leaves flavour.

BALINESE CURRY With STEAMED RICE (3/5) a thick curry with very mild flavours. However, it didn't taste like a Balinese dish, rather like south Indian curries with coconut milk.

KHAO PAD KRATIEM (5/5) basil flavoured aromatic rice which will leave you greedy for more. Must try

CHICKEN IN ASIAN BARBEQUED SAUCE (5/5) chicken cubes dipped in a tangy gravy, went well with Khao pad kratiem.

SANKAYA (5/5) a quite different kind of dessert, not served in many places. It is a pumpkin custard with jaggery flavour, served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Brilliant is presentation, even better in taste.
All the dishes come in handsome quantity.

Service is super fast and polite.

Best wishes to Asia House.

Food is something which makes me smile. being a hardcore Chinese food lover i always prefer to eat any kind of Chinese,Thai foods. apart from the North Indian or Bengali dishes, i tried Burmese,Vietnamese foods which tastes as good as Chinese dishes. “Asia House” is a hidden gem in the city which is located near Southern Avenue area,serves delicious foods all the way from Singapore,Malaysia,Indonesia as well as famous Chinese along with Burmese,Thai dishes. it has capacity of seating around 25-30 people at a time. decorated superbly with lots of wooden buckets attached from the ceiling which is enlighten with various types of lights, hand painted wall & various types of Chinese utensils which came here all the way from China. i was went there with my fellow foodie friends over a food tasting session. i was quite impressed by the ambiance of the place as well as it was well decorated with very average interiors. this place is maintained very well, a proper glimpse of Asian cuisine.

Food has it own space of joy for all ,or lets put it this way its probably the only ultimate source of happiness in everyone’s life. And when you get it yummy and wholesome its even better and delightful indeed. That is what ASIA HOUSE made me feel in my recent visit at their location 17 A, Lake View Road, Southern Avenue, Kolkata .

Went With Very Very High Expectation, coz we have tried china wok, which belongs to the same owner but were terribly disappointed.

The place is easy to locate and well done up. On our arrival the place was empty and AC was switched on after we told the to.

For Starters we ordered Vietnamese Glass noodle salad and Some Tofu Dish , both of which were good.

For Mains we ordered veg fried rice, Assorted veg in Hot basil sauce and pad thai.
Pad thai was bad, except that everything we ordered was good !!

Desert we orders Darsans which was excellent.

Overall except pad thai food was average, but it was the service and the attitude of the staff, which force people never to visit this place...

We went there for dinner on Valentine's Day. The dimly lit place with creative decor really created a romantic ambience. We both wanted to try Asian cuisine and this place had always been on our checklist. The person who took our order was slightly confused with the names of the dishes and what each dish had to offer. The disappointing thing was they were reluctant to serve sui mai as it would have taken more than 30 minutes to prepare. If you are running an Asian restaurant then you have to prepared to serve each and every dish and sui mai being a popular dish in Asian cuisine it's  expected that your customers are going to come and opt for it. We ordered the Thai seafood soup Pho Taek. The broth was light and flavorful with the right amount of chilli and other seasonings and had the aroma of thai cuisine bursting out from it. For starters we got Tak rai checking with was crispy sweet and spicy chicken with lemongrass and it was delicious. I wanted to lick my entire plate and bowl of soup. The started really hit the right cords but the graph sort of went down in mains. We had ordered Thai green curry and steamed rice. The curry lacked the flavour of lemongrass and it was just the spice factor that over powered my entire palette and I could not taste the other ingredients in the curry. Maybe it lacked a bit of lime juice which would have made the flavours shine through. The graph sort of went up in desserts where we orders sankalay, which is pumpkin custard with ice cream. The custard was rich and the flavours were really unique and good. For someone who hasn't tried pumpkin custard before this was surprisingly good and worth the risk. All in all we really enjoyed our dinner and I hope that next time they'll be ready to serve sui mai and other signature dishes on the menu.

Went there for the first time on Valentine's day.  It's a small and cozy place. Not too extravagant but simple and comfortable. We ordered a mushroom, chili and garlic soup, which was really flavorful. For main course, we got the hot basil fried rice , which too was different and tasty and the chicken side dish had good taste and authentic flavors. Over all, I would recommend this place for a relaxing brunch with your loved ones. And its pocket friendly as well. BONUS!

​Calcutta is no longer a hub for only Chinese food. Asian cuisine is steadily making its way into the food scene and has distinctly established itself as one of the most loved cuisines by Calcuttans. Since the last few years, Calcutta has seen the emergence of a number of Asian cuisine based restaurants. Let me guide you to the latest destination for Asian food in the city – Asia House !
                                                                ...

Kolkatans have always been an ardent fan of Chinese cuisine and this has almost been their second best eat-out option maybe after Mughlai! Though for some, Chinese is definitely their first love when it comes to eating out. There are infinite numbers of street side stalls selling Chinese dishes along with piping hot dimsums in the city. But anyway, the bottom line is pretty clear, Kolkatans are well aware of their Chinese food, they have almost grown up eating these dishes. And it’s challenging to open up another Chinese restaurant as well as satisfying at the same time, since you get to serve loads of fanatics of this particular cuisine. But these days people are very particular about their health and what they are consuming, so people tend to be very serious about avoiding Ajinomoto in their food while they are opting for Chinese dishes. Also at the same time, they now love to try out other South East Asian cuisines like Thai, Burmese or Vietnamese, Indonesian apart from just the vanilla Chinese, which was the only available option in restaurants even few years back. Keeping all these things in mind, several restaurants are coming up in the city that meets all these needs and requirements of the current restaurant goers and food fanatics. Asia House is surely one such place which tries to keep up to all these expectations, and being a newly opened restaurant they really do have loads of time and potential to make it big in their domain. They have been trying to produce modern Asian cuisine while still clinging on to certain old school processes of Asian cooking, signature flavors and aroma.

Kolkata has seen a surge of a number Asian restaurants in the last year, namely 2016! One such is Asia House which was discovered by me one fine afternoon while I was ambling in the by-lanes of Lake Road.

Last week we were invited for a blogger's meet at this restaurant and I am oh so delighted with the spread!
Mr. Varun and Ms. Shreya were the perfect hosts who made us feel at ease and organized the blogger's meet perfectly. Before I begin, a very big thank you to the both of you.

Coming to the location - it is situated at Lake Road, towards the side of Southern Avenue. There's a big Raymond's outlet right beside Asia House, so that could be a marker for people visiting this beautiful restaurant.

The décor is minimalistic and transports you to a little Japanese household, complete with the traditional cherry tree motif to haikus written on the walls. The seating arrangement is comfortable, and special mention has to be of the lighting. Really eye catching.

Now let's talk about the menu for the afternoon. The starters were beautifully prepared, but the main course clearly stole the show.

> Starting with the soups :

• Shanghai Hawkers' Soup - This soup originates from the streets of China, and was made popular by the vendors. This particular soup was thick and had an abundance of tofu, bok choy and mushrooms. The flavour of burnt garlic was perfectly balanced making it an ideal choice for any soup lover.

• Vietnamese Pho (Chicken) - Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup consisting of broth, rice noodles and chicken. Asia House prepared this soup to perfection. The flavours of red chillies, onions and lime created a beautiful fusion. This soup touched my heart with the first spoonful. Recommended!

> Starters :

• Chicken Sui Mai - My love for any type of dumplings is undying. Henceforth, Sui Mai appealed to even before I had tasted it. Cute, small little dumplings stuffed with chicken, that's Sui Mai for you. The flour wrappers were thin and well prepared which added to the appeal of the dish. It was served with Garlic and chilli oil which went really well with the Sui Mai. Recommended!

• Jiang's Pan Fried Chilli Chicken - Asia House decides to give a twist to the good ol' chilli chicken and how! The chicken pieces were saucier, cooked with an assortment of bell peppers, roasted chillies and star anise. If one wants to experiment with chilli chicken, go for this dish!

• Pla Sad Takrai - This was a Thai speciality dish which includes the word Sad, but makes you anything but that. This a fish item and I loved it! Crispy fish tossed in lemongrass, Thai herbs, chillies and garnished with coriander leaves, this is Pla Sad Takrai. The fish tasted brilliant, was extremely soft and juicy. Recommended yet again!

> Main Course :

• Khao Pad Kratiem with Sliced Fish in Chef's Secret Sauce - I decided to couple the Thai speciality rice with the this beautifully prepared fish dish which went absolutely amazingly well. The Thai fried rice had a light hue and didn't look that appealing. But they say looks can be deceptive and how! This particular fried rice turned to be the show stealer of the afternoon with its mild lemony fragrance and aroma. This was an egg fried rice which was cooked it Thai oil. Strongly recommended. And do take my words and combine it with the Sliced Fish in Chef's Secret Sauce, which included Asian prunes and shrimps

• Chilli Garlic Noodles and Kai Pad Krapow - When I say that this is the best ever chilli garlic noodles that I've ever come across, please do believe me! Visit Asia House and taste this dish to understand what I'm talking about. The noodles tasted out of the world and I'm still struggling to figure out how such a staple Chinese item could taste this brilliant! Couple it with Kai Pad Krapow, which is a spicy chicken side dish to enhance the dining experience. This too, was a Thai speciality dish which had sliced chicken tossed in hot chillies, herbs and basil sauce. Strongly recommended yet again!

• Pepper Chicken Schezwan Rice - This one again is Asia House's take on your regular fried rice. It looked spicy, and tasted amazing. Combine it with either of the above side dishes and experience the best of Oriental cuisine on your plate. I had this fabulous rice with both the above mentioned dishes and it only enhanced my taste buds.

• Chicken Khaosuey - This is probably the first dish that comes to our mind when we think of Burmese cuisine. Asia House presents this popular Burmese dish with utmost authenticity! This is a delicious noodle soup made with curried chicken and coconut milk. Served with a variety of condiments, with every spoonful there is burst of flavours in your mouth! As we were too full, we ordered for a half plate of Khaosuey, but the quantity of the half plate too, is quite a lot for one person.

> Desserts :

• Darsaan with ice cream - Yes, you can judge me all you want but this was the first time I tried this brilliant dessert, and I loved it. Crispy fried flour strips tossed in burnt honey and caramelized sugar served with vanilla ice cream, oh this was pure love! I almost wiped off one whole plate of this. Recommended to the core!

• Fried ice cream - I'm not very fond of fried ice cream but I must say I was impressed with what I was served with at Asia House. It's an earnest request, please do not leave this restaurant without ordering this particular dessert. The crispy outer layer of fried ice cream with coconut and the toppings of sesame seeds and chocolate sauce made it an instant hit among my foodie friends, so much so that we fought with each other till the last bite. Strongly recommended!

As I conclude my detailed description of the items served at Asia House, all I can say is that I had an amazing experience here. Each of the items made my day!

The service is prompt and the staff is very friendly and helpful. This place is a hidden gem that just can't be missed. Even if I visit this place a hundred times, I won't be able to satisfy myself. This is a gem of a place right in my neighborhood and I'm so glad about that!

All my love to Team Asia House!

I wanted to visit a reasonably priced nearby restaurant...on browsing zomato i came across Asia House.
Its located near Lake kalibari in southern avenue.The place is small and decent nothing fancy about the ambiance and decor.
The food was also average like its pricing.Portion size were small and when we ordered momos they were half the size of a normal momo.
Mushroom based starters were not that great
That god for the MAIN COURSE!!!chilli garlic noodles and tsing hoi potato were really nice😊

I also tried "moe green" which I thought would be different as its from the Indonesian cusine...but it was just a slightly spicy version of the regular hakka chow

If u visit this place dont expect any delactable variety of dishes...its just a regular neighbourhood food joint

'Asia House' is located at just crossing of Lake View Road & Raja Basanta Roy Road.I heard that Asia House is the another outlet of China Wok.I'd been there with my lover for dinner.Ambience is attractive & well decorative.Atfirst we ordered here  'Asia House Special Chicken Dumplings' & 'Jiangs Pan Fried Chilli Chicken' as starters with fresh lime soda.Dumplings are too small,taste is ok.Jiangs Pan Fried Chilli Chicken is good not excellent.They forgot to mixed lemon with fresh lime soda,they gave me just plain soda water (sweet).Then we ordered  'Hot Basil Chicken Fried Rice' with 'General Taos Favourite Chicken' as main course.Hot Basil Chicken Fried Rice is very tasty,but General Taos Favourite Chicken is horrible,gravy is too sweet & chicken pieces are too small.We ate just dry Chicken Fried Rice.Overall very terrific experience.Price is very high than their quality.Stafs are very polite & well behaved.

I gave that extra half a point because the food was better than expected and more so since it doesn't contain Ajino Moto I could enjoy Chinese. Goes to say all those like me, can have ajino moto free Chinese here. 

Portion sizes are bigger than the place in itself as the can accommodate about 30 people max. Don't really know how it would be when full house coz with just 3 tables occupied, the place was already loud and echoing. Service is undoubtedly Just about OK, you can't ask for more... guess the staff needs to be trained a little more and inculcate English. 

Situated in the heart of Southern Avenue, it's difficult to miss this place but only if you it exists otherwise it's surely a miss. 

They have done it up very lightly with the least possible investment and I appreciate the intelligence of the owner. Just that I didn't quite like the finishing of the Windows, it feels very outdated. 

No complain on the food whatsoever. Well cooked and rightfully so too. Appreciate! Do well.

My first visit to the place. Not difficult to locate for foodies frequently visiting Southern Avenue. I got to know the place began to offer Pan Asian food only in last October. The place was almost empty when I entered around 1 am. Well, Chinese theme music was playing in the background to give the place the needed ambience. It serves around thirty odd people at a time. The waiters were helpful enough to guide me through the menu. As advised by them, I ordered Cantonese Noodles served with Prawns and with it I became adventurous and tried King Crab for the first time in life and ordered Pepper Garlic Crab. The food was served after fifteen twenty minutes. The quantity of the noodles was good enough for one big foodie like me. Taste and quality of the noodles and Crab - okay,could have been better. I'd request them to offer knives with non veg dishes specially while serving crustaceans. You also get one coupon which if brought in the next visit within two months give ten percent discount on your orders. Service was good. Cost me five hundred forty rupees so not too pricey. Recommended.

The place serves mouth watering chinese food. The ambience is good. Dim lit with walls painted with chinese scripts. The seating arrangement is quite comfortable. I have been there thrice. And each time the food has been equally good. Its tasty and not too oily. The noodles and especially the starters are very delicious.  The waiters and the manager is courteous.

This place was suggested by a friend. I am fond of Asian Cuisine and was looking forward to paying a visit.

Ordered:

1. Veg Khaosuey - tasted very rich, with the perfect amount of vegetables. It came with a perfect condiment basket with fried onions, fried garlic, fried noodles and lemon slices. 

2. Green Thai Curry - The steamed rice was fragrant and perfectly cooked. The curry was flavorful but on the spicy side. Also, one might think that the curry was too thin and runny. I had a similar concern, to which they answered that it was because they didn't use cornflour to make their curries thick, an answer that was backed by logic.

All in all, extremely flavourful Asian food. Options for non-vegetarians are aplenty. Interiors are simple, uplifting and cosy.

If there was a negative scale, I would have marked on it. It's not even worth giving 1! We ordered from swiggy and after 1.5 hours, we had to call them to check if the food is ready to be delivered. They say, we are sending in 10 minutes. After 15 minutes, when we again call, they tell us that the burner is not working and we will be unable to deliver. Now, this is ridiculous. We are sitting hungry, waiting for the food and they don't even have the manners to inform us if it will be late. If you can't handle such traffic, why do you over promise and under deliver? Pathetic customer service, no accountability and no responsibility of informing the customer. Will never ever order again.

Firstly the order was 1hr late and food was cold. The packaging was horrible as the sauces and gravy leaked out of the boxes. The chowmien was the only good thing. Momos and Sui mai were very dry. Kung Pao veg was sweet and schezwan fried rice was not even close to spicy. 
I would not recommend the restaurant for delivery.

So after a failed attempt for a great meal, the owner called a couple of times to apologise for the delivery delay and bad food. I was offered a complementary meal as a gesture. 
So it's time for the next review.. This time the food was hot which was good for starters. The soup was fantastic and very authentic Chinese. The basil rice and veg in black bean sauce was a very good combination. 
I would like to thank Asia house for the hospitality offered and for the great food. I would definitely order again and wish to visit out restaurant soon.

Excellent food and very friendly staff. The Khawsuey, crabs and Shanghai Hawkers Soup were absolutely fantastic. A wee bit disorganised but may be because they are new, the restaurant was full and there were seven of us with each ordering his own. They should also do something about mosquitoes as we had a couple of them buzzing around our ears.
Will surely go their again.👍

Hidden gem! A must visit restaurant that makes delicious Asian food.

Not too big. Decently decorated.

We ordered:

1. Lemon Coriander Soup: Clear soup with dices of prawn, chicken, mushroom and flavored with lemon and coriander. Perfect comfort food. 2 portions would be good for 3 people.

2. Takrai Chicken : Crispy, perfectly flavored fried chicken preparation in Thai style. Loved it! A must order starter.

3. Keong's Sweet & Spicy Fish : Another must order dish. This one is a crispy fried fish preparation with a hint of Kafir lime. So good that we wanted to re-order!

4. Khao Pad Kratiem Mix : Thai style mixed rice. Tasted average. To make it taste better, I would suggest to have it with the gravy of the side dish.

5. Prawn in Schezwan sauce: Gravy could have been thicker. Nevertheless, the Prawns tasted awesome!

Service: Courteous. There's scope of improvement though. Takes quite long to serve the dishes.

Price : Absolutely reasonable. Till now they do not charge any taxes.

Recommended!

This sister concern of China Wok is conveniently located with limited seating capacity. We ordered Shanghai Hawkers Soup, Roasted Pork, Pan Tossed Schezwan Fish and Keongs Sweet & Spicy Chicken (was a bit sweet) for starters. For mains it was Thai Chilli Basil Noodles (oddly the noodle looked like vermicelli), Khao Pad Kratiem (traditional Thai rice) along with General Tao's Favorite Pork, Tsing Hoi Fish and Chicken Hamchoi - all the items were great but what didn't work our way was the service. Although the owner, manager and waiters were very courteous but they simply seemed a bit disorganized. Messed up delivering the soup with 80% order served and rest kept waiting, so they served a complimentary soup to keep all engaged !! They took care of the guests and also took the feedback instantly. To make up for the service they also provided a complimentary desert.

It is a small and cosy place which has recently come up at Southern Avenue beside the Raymonds showroom. Ambiance is good and the place has been maintained well. Staff is courteous but needs to brush up their knowledge about their very own items which are available. Among the delicacies ordered the Prawn Lat me Kai was definitely the pick of the lot.Pricing is also reasonable. Overall a decent place which can be tried out.

Been to this place twice within first half of January. Our first visit (on 1st Jan) was unplanned. We stood in a queue at Hatari and started searching nearby places. We found China Wok. Upon calling them, they suggested us to visit Asia house, their newly opened sister concern, as China Wok's chimney wasn't working properly. The place is conveniently located near Lake Kalibari. Southern Avenue always feels serene and parking opportunity is ample.

We had to wait a few minutes as the joint was full. Once we entered we found the place has a very simple decoration. The stuff were very cordial. We mainly ordered Thai cousine. Each of the item had a specific taste and they were delicious. The Thai style drums of heaven was heavenly. The Krateim (Thai rice) and Kraprow (Thai chicken) were yummy as well. In desserts Fried Ice cream needs a special mention. Overall we had a good experience on both our visits. But on our 10th Jan visit Thai drums of heaven tasted a bit sweeter than usual and fried ice cream was already finished.

Pros:
1. Location
2. Cordial stuff
3. Tasty food.
4. Homely ambience.

Cons:
1. Price is at higher side. Although now they are not charging tax.

After glancing through the positive reviews about this place in Zomato,I visited this place on 1st Jan with my family for lunch.the decor and ambience is nice but not very spacious.coming to the food we ordered chicken lemon coriander soup which took our hearts away.The flavour of the soup was mind-blowing.for main course we ordered chilli garlic noodles,burnt garlic and coriander rice and spicy Hoisin chicken all of which were very good.though I felt the chicken wasn't spicy enough.the only thing that disappointed us was the extremely slow service.the same person was taking orders,cleaning up tables and clearing the bill which was a bit irksome.i hope they will work upon this soon.otherwise a good experience.

Newly opened place serving Asian Cuisine beside Raymond's Showroom. There is plenty of car parking space available around which is a big plus !

The interiors have a nice calming effect on you. White walls and minimalistic design are very soothing on the eyes. 

We were a party of 4 and we ordered the KUNG PAO CHICKEN, NASI GORENG, KHAO PAD KRATIEM ( Fried Rice), GENERAL TAO'S FAVOURITE CHICKEN.

We tried the SANKAYA for desert which was totally worth the extra calories after the heavy meal  !

Portion sizes were generous and the place seemed adequately staffed for its size. Didn't face any service issues or delays. 

The best thing about this place is their sheer variety of options to choose from. Exhaustive selection in both meat and vegetarian section. 

The place is a must try considering the limited places we have in the city for Asian cuisine. Prices were reasonable and I'm surely coming back for another round very soon !

Asia House is small restaurant located near the Lake View Road – Southern Avenue junction – with a bold red signage, very difficult to miss…Out of curiosity we went for a sort of recce… Below is our experience:

Asia house special dumplings – 6 pieces of dimsums available in veg/chicken/prawn and pork variety..opted for chicken, the speciality of the dish is the chef’s secret sauce which turned out to be good…a combo of light soya with rice vinegar, hint of chilli, jiggery and some other secret ingredients…

General Tao’s favourite chicken – sliced chicken in chilii-honey sauce…excellent flavour, but the chicken slices were overcooked and not succulent

Tsing hoi prawn – prawns in a mild sweet and sour sauce, high of flavour and taste, served with seasonal veggies…good

Khao Pad Kratiem – This was the winner, Thai fried rice with thai oil and burnt garlic, light, fluffy, aromatic…very good

Wrapped it up with darsan – served with two scoops of vanilla icecream

Décor – minimalistic but effective

Cordial atmosphere, prices are very reasonable …portions are moderate, but it is not clear what is their USP (probably moderate pricing). The menu is quite extensive and includes Asian delicacies, not just usual Chinese …

Asia House is a new branch of China Wok, which gained quite a reputation in South Kolkata within a year. After having visited China Wok on several occasions, the manager himself insisted that we visit Asia House too.
On receiving a New Year discount offer from Asia House, it was time to pay a visit. Its situated beside Raymonds Seconds shop, near Dugout 2. I am glad to admit, they serve some delicious Asian delicacies here, that you shouldn't miss to try. The ambiance, music and decor was all so serene. The waiters were courteous.
We ordered Asian BBQ chicken for starters, followed by Coriander & Burnt garlic mixed rice, Pork (Moo Pad Kraprow), Gen Tao's sliced fish.
For dessert we tried 2 items.. Sankaya (sugarcane jaggery & vanilla) and Fried ice cream. Sankaya was supposed to be a pumpkin custard dish, instead of jaggery.
Nevertheless, each item was special. We loved all of it!

One short visit for late lunch at this asian eatery was quite a nice experience . The decor is clean and soothing. Staff is very cooperative with friendly service .
We ordered one starter and a maincourse for two , CHICKEN SATAY tasted excellent but just four skewers were little less for the pricing , CHICKEN KHAOSUEY was my choice for maincourse, kind of an average dish i had here , as my last experience of khaosuey at mamagoto was way beyond comparison. Also the meal which serves two was given in a single bowl , without further distributing it , so that needs rectification.
Overall i felt this place has potential for popping up as one of the favourite destination in south kolkata soon , if the price to serving portion ratio is taken care of, as mostly feedback i got from my mates had the same complain.

One of the frontiers of Asian dining in the city. The modern decor, vibrant feel, personal service and robust food make it a perfect destination for Pan Asian food lovers in the city. The menu is out of the box and elaborate and would make you want to try new Asian dishes.

We loved the Xao Sa Ot , Malaysian Curry and Thai fried Rice. The Sankaya which is Burmese pumpkin custard is subtle and a perfect end to a great meal. Don't miss the place. It will make you keep coming back for more !!

Packaging is basic but clean and hygienic. Amongst the various dishes I tried their Asian Mushroom Soup, Chilli Garlic Noodles and Assorted veg. In black bean sauce deserve special mention . Kudos to the Asia House team. Rarely does a new restaurant work in such an organised manner. Waiting to try their dine in.

Now coming to food..I actually visit this place seeing the ratings on zomato..the food indeed doesn't dissapoint me..we ordered :
#chicken sweet corn soup - well nothing different from the soup served in any other Chinese restaurant but the quantity was indeed less compared to other restaurants but still d taste was good to look over that fact
#jiang's pan fried chicken - well yet another dish which I ordered aftr getting a very positive review from zomato nd I must say this actually won my heart..it the chilli chicken with something different nd it tastes delicious
#chicken Cantonese noodles - well it was not at all upto the mark..the gravy was actually tasteless nd without any salt..it cannot be called a proper Cantonese noodles dish
#chicken meifoon - nice one but still needs some improvement
#kung Pao chicken - nice one but firstly it seemed tasteless as there was no salt in it..but after adding salt it tastes good..

The restaurant is a small one with not many tables but the friendly behaviour of the staffs nd their tasty starters will definitely give u a reason to visit this place for d second time..!

What a nice place in the heart of South Kolkata for all the Asian food junkies like me. It's contemporary decor, alternate art, young and vibrant feel and modern food make it a must go destination for all.

We tried their Spring rolls, Vietnamese rolls, Kung Pao Chicken and Nasi Goreng rice. Needless to say the rave reviews about the place have been earned through great food and service. Food was excellent and very fresh. A special mention to the Vietnamese rolls which were mind blowing. Service was quick and very polite and the place is easy on the pocket. Don't Miss !!

Asia House is one of those places that truly encompasses the modern Asian experience. I found the ambience go be genuinely romantic with dim lighting, light music and a young vibe to the place. The interiors are visible from the outside and that's what pulled me and my fiancee into dining there last week. We called for Babycorn in Thai sweet chilli sauce, Vietnamese Pho Soup, Jiang's pan fried chicken and a fried ice cream to finish our meal. The Babycorn was crispy, well seasoned and had a great balance of spice and sweet. The Vietnamese Pho was fresh, had lots of crunch for a soup and had a hit of chilli which was a pleasant surprise. I liked the Jiang's chicken with a pronounced flavor of star anise which added depth to the dish. The dries ice cream was the pick of the lot with its subtle flavors and thin crisp batter. All in all a great time. Keep it up!

Asia House is an excellent no-nonsense, hardcore Oriental food lovers paradise. Everything about it speaks the same. I say purely in terms of the food quality and taste, while there are the added benefits of an elaborate menu and attractive pricing. I wish Varun all the best in his endeavour.

We called for food delivery last night at our residence in Tollygunge. Order consisted of a Spicy Malaysian Curry, Steamed Jasmine Rice and Indonesian Chicken Satay. Food arrived in an hour from ordering as promised. It was piping hot and fresh. The Chicken Satay was well cooked and a distinct smoky flavor came through which lifted the dish completely. The Spicy Malaysian Curry was great too and had a generous helping of veggies in it. I was informed that they make their own curry paste and the freshness really came through. Rice was good too. It had been strained properly and was not wet. Highly recommended !

The place is cool and the decor is fun. This seems much like a "chinese bodega" (sans alcohol), if such a thing may exist. The lighting is dim and that gives this place a personal feeling. Now coming to the most important part- the food. The taste is good no doubt. The starter that I ordered was roasted pork with bok choy and black pepper and it was Amazing! For mains I ordered Nasi Goreng and Takrai Chicken. The side dish was good too but the Nasi Goreng could do with more flavour. The strong thai flavour of the meat was overpowering the rice which is supposed to have strong flavour as well. And a major downer was that the portion of the side dish was too less as compared to the main which led to the chicken running out before the rice. However, I can't deny that I would like to give one more try.

After going through numerous reviews,i decided to hit this place with my friend. The expectations quite matched with the previous reviews. The ambience is very soothing with some good music at the back.
Coming to the food..
Sweet corn soup (chicken) : nothing different from other well known restraurants.
Roasted chilli lamb : it was diced and well preapred. Along with some vegetables. 
Jiang's pan fried chicken : i would recommend this one to everyone.. this is very delicious. Its crispy and soft 
Fried rice chiken.: The quantity was okay for an individual. 
Tsing hoi chicken.: Little spicy,chicken is soft and tasty.

Just beside the old Raymond showroom near Asoka cinema hall in Raja Basanta Roy Rd lies this small authentic Asian food eatery. New but humble beginnings for this place. The decor is subtle yet elegant with the ambiance of a hole in the wall food joint of Shanghai or Beijing. The food is of good quality, ingredients used are fresh, yet I yearned for more. Perhaps the nuances of being an obsessive compulsive foodie. The bok choy pork was standard however some of the pork required further roasting. The prawn salad with cold meifoon was a delight. The shangshi crab meat soup was well balanced and simple. The rice with hint of thai chilli oil was properly prepared but needed a little more pizazz to it. A touch of more spice maybe. The prawn side dish was wonderful. The manager/owner asked us about the food yet the service was dismal to say the least. Had to ask for the menu at the very start and the boys seemed disinterested in serving. Needs a lot more fine tuning and honing of the skills. The food is on the right note. Will certainly give it a try once it sorts out its rookie mistakes.

it was one friday evening nd me and husband decided to try Asia house under the impression that the place serves some excellent kwaswey.we ordered for a kwaswey .it was clearly mentioned that it serves 2. 
we got the khaswey served in two small bowls good enough to accomodate only 3 rasagullas..it was down hill from there on. we ordered for three items and in all the cases the quantity of food served was abysmally low.I must ad the taste was really good however the quantity served was extremely disappointing to an extent that you feel cheated.
this place might be a great experience for people who want to taste diffrent foods ..go back home ...and have their dinner
Not my kind of place..

Kolkata is full of Chinese restaurants all around. Most of them are serving the conventional Chinese dishes, only a handful of them have set them apart by their excellent and unique menu and items. I was glad to get invited here by the owner Varun for a food tasting event at this place.I was excited from the first day when he told me that he is coming up with Asia House. The newly opened up Asia House is hub for Chinese, Thai, Burmese, Vietnamese, Malaysian, Indonesian, Singaporean dishes. And they are doing it really well when it comes to taste, decoration, presentation and uniqueness of their dishes.

We tried home delivery last night after reading the great reviews on Zomato. Our order consisted of tom kha soup chicken, chicken xao sa ot and Singapore rice noodles. The person taking the order was well informed and convinced me on being a little adventurous. Food was delivered within 55 mins at my residence in alipore. It was hot and fresh. I enjoyed the flavor of tom kha which had mushrooms added with chicken. Xao SA ot which is Vietnamese chicken was the pick of the lot with its heart warming flavors and bursts of chilli. Singapore rice noodles were well made. All in all a very satisfying meal. Try it. It would be hard to get disappointed.

While I am quite apprehensive about trying new places to eat, we decided to order food from this newly opened restaurant at Lake View Road. Our order consisted of Vegetables in Black Bean Sauce, Vegetable Fried Rice and vegetarian Sui Mai. The person taking the order on the phone was well informed about the dishes to our surprise, as the menu is very modern and different. Food arrived in 50 mins and was hot and well packed. I especially liked the assorted vegetables which is amongst the best I have had in the city. The freshness of the ingredients came through and the food was surprisingly light on the stomach. The containers said no MSG and I could not taste any. Will try the dine in very soon. For now it's. Perfect 5.

Asia House is yet another restaurant which has put its mark in the list of Pan Asian Restaurants in Kolkata. This place is a perfect place to have some delicious asian food in very reasonable pricing. What I loved about the place was its quirky decor, fast service and some good food.

Location : Raymonds Southern Avenue, just few steps from Dugout 2

Decor: Quirky wall, old wooden ceiling, cemented floor and some nice pictures in the wall with the theme.

Food:
#Spicy Vietnamese Noodle Salad
#Asian Mushroom Soup
#Jiang's Pan Fried Chilli Chicken
#Mushroom Pepper Salt
#Sliced Fish in Chef's Secret Sauce
#Chilli Garlic Noodles
#Fried Ice Cream

All the dish were extremely well prepared. But my favourites were The Pan Fried Chilli Chicken, Jiang's Pan Fried Chilli Chicken and Sliced Fish

Last Words:
One of those places you will always enjoy because of its pricing and taste. A new place in my list when I have to go for Chinese food.

This restaurant which has opened very recently near Lake Kalibari,just beside the famous Raymond's showroom,is beautifully decorated and a serene calmness prevails all around.The food from the starting is wonderful and very tasty.The various items of chicken are delicious and well cooked and the pork is also nice. The dessert in the end adds a cherry on the top which is baked ice-cream which is excellent.The ambience is superb and the service is very good.One should definitely try this restaurant. :)

Location : This restaurant is located just next to Raymond's showroom in the lane just beside Dugout 2.

Decor & Ambience : Beautiful downlighters and baskets, pictures on the walls and overall white color gives a very interesting feel to this place. I loved the fact that they have chopsticks on each table and I love eating with chopsticks!

Beverage :

Fresh lime soda : Neither sweet nor salty, just the way I like it. Use of black straws is a plus!

Food :

Spicy Vietnamese Noodles Salad(shrimp) : This was a cold salad and tasted awesome. The noodles were neither too hard nor too soft. The shrimps were lovely and crunchy. I loved this dish!

Asian Mushroom Soup (Chicken) : The soup was good. I liked it!

Jiang's pan fried chili chicken : Who doesn't love chili chicken? I absolutely loved this dish. But if you're used to the Kolkatan Hakka styled chili chicken then be ready to be surprised as this thing is nothing like it. 

Mushroom pepper salt : I love mushrooms and this dish was done very well. The mushrooms were coated in a light batter and tossed in salt & pepper!

Sliced Fish in Chef's secret Sauce : The fish was tender and extremely flavourful.

Chili garlic noodles: I loved these noodles because the flavours were balanced so well. This was neither too spicy nor too hot. I loved it.

Fried ice cream : This was the perfect dessert to one's meal at Asia House. A huge dollop of ice cream coated in a coconut-y batter and deep fried, topped with sesame seeds and served with chocolate sauce was served. It was sooo goood!!!!

This newest property has come up near lake kalibari, next to the famous Raymond's shop. The restaurant specialises in Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese cuisine.
As for the ambience I like the minimalistic yet very unique decor. 
The menu card itself is so beautifully done.
For starters there were
Vietnamese Salad-The salad enriched with raw vegetables is nice and crunchy, fresh and healthy.
Chicken Takrai- A dry chicken dish which is a befitting starter.
Main course
Khauwswey - This dish is delicious and I highly recommend this
Sliced fish in chef's secret sauce- nice and beautifully done. This fish is indeed palatable.
Khai pad Kareem Rice- A beautifully prepared rice, light and tasty.
Dessert
Fried Ice cream infused with decicated coconut-This is a beautifully done fried ice cream, unique in taste.
Darshan with ice cream-A delicious dessert that I will like to try again.

Service-The service was quite good with about 3 servers who were polite and efficient while serving us.The owner was also very humble and was intouch with us to know the feedback on dishes served.

Food-All the dishes served were good and in taste as well as presentation.But there is still a scope for improvement in some of their dishes which we will describe below and some were there which just spellbind our toungue.We had-

1:SOUP
•Tom Kha-The soup was excellent in taste but was thin and the vegetables were quite raw.

2:SALAD
•Som Tam-Good

•Crispy babycorn oriental chilli-This dish could be slightly enhanced in taste.
•Mushroom pepper-Good

4:MAIN COURSE
•Chilli garlic noodles-Great

The new Asian Hub at Southern Avenue excelling in a number of cuisines- Chinese, Thai, Indonesian, Vietnamese and more.

Located close to Lake Kalibari, near Dugout 2.

The hospitality of each person out there was something which every customer shall want.
Had gone there for lunch and the orders were as follows:
Beginning with Fresh Lime soda..
Asian Mushroom Soup- Decent.
Spicy Vietnamese Noodles salad- that didn't go well with my liking though.
For starters, Jiang's pan fried chilli chicken
Chicken Takrai and Mushroom pepper salt. Loved each one to the core.

For the mains,
Tausi Chicken- some other form of chilli chicken.
Sliced Fish in Chef's secret sauce- loved it. I really wished to know the secret sauce recipe!
Khao Pad Kratiem Rice- egg fried rice in better words.

For dessert,
Fried ice cream- coconut flavour filled the taste buds. Good thing.
Darsaan with Ice cream- honestly, the dish of the day for me. Can't describe in words how amazing that was.

Had a great time there. And sure you too will. Improvement in the quality of salads should really help them..

Asia House is a newly opened restaurant situated next to the Raymond Showroom on Lake View Road, Southern Avenue. It serves alternate Asian Food by which I mean Asian Dishes with modern ingredients.

The interiors of the place are very nice and soothing. The restaurant is minimalistic with raw cement flooring and a black ceiling. But there is a soul to the interiors unlike many restaurants opening today. The lights are artistic and the wall graphiti is very modern. You must actually go there to experience this.

We were a group of 4 for Sunday brunch and ordered Chilli Babycorn, Spicy Vietnamese Noodle Salad, Kung Pao Vegetables, Sui Mai Veg, Khao Pad Kratiem Rice and a Sankaya for desert.

Food was great and served fresh and hot. I could make out that all ingredients were fresh and perfectly cooked. The dishes had an honesty about them which many popular Asian restaurants in the vicinity lack. We were served with a smile and the owner was humble and very polite. We loved our experience. We will go back for sure to try some of their other offerings.

For the first time I visited a newly opened restaurant ( without reading any review on Zomato from the real experts) and I am really happy that I did. I am pretty excited to be one of the first reviewers of this place.

Ambiance- The restaurant is situated in the first floor of a old house in the area. And the best thing about the interior is the simplicity. The minimalist decor made the place soothing, calm and peaceful. I am just in love with the cement floor, white walls, paintings and the unique lamps ( please do stare up at the ceiling and you will know), wall art, calligraphy. This is the best interior I have seen in a restaurant till date. I hope they will never change this rustic and artistic interior to glam it up :)

Service- the stewards were very courteous and helpful. The menu card has a huge range of variety and they tried their level best to explain the food and help to pick the  dishes. the service was pretty quick too. There was a lady sitting at the reception (I think she is the owner...or manager..I don't know) who asked us about the experience and helped us to get the dessert pretty quickly (again, I am happy that I ordered it. Will tell why) 

Food- Ahha..Hear comes the best part. First let me tell me clear this out. I am not a big food expert. So, I am writing what I felt, without knowing the exact science or history or whatever. So, take it as a commoner's opinion. Also, I will mention a few small things which I feel can be improved. But that definitely did not affect my rating as I believe that as a newly opened restaurant, there is always scopes of improvement and I am pretty sure that they will do. 

Asian Mushroom soup (chicken) - This is the perefct start for a meal. A nice warm bowl of soup that will make you happy and content, but not full (so that you can eat all the other things that you want to). The mushrooms are super fresh. The ginger and spring onion julienne add the perfect burst of flavor to this plain soup. The menu says it is supposed to be thick and creamy. But I felt that the thickening was more due to cornflour. I would have loved it if it was a little thinner. 

Asia House Special Dumplings (pork)- This was again another great stuff for the starters. The dumplings were soft, with enough meat in it and steamed to perfection. Well, I don't know what the secret sauce was, but it accompanied the dumpling perfectly. 

Lamb Khawsuey- I never had this stuff before. And i loved everything about it. it is a thick soup with perfect burst of flavours. The lamb meat and noodles is well-cooked and the spices in the soup is pretty relatable to Indian spices too.

Pan Fried Noodles (Mixed)- Just what it should be like. Enough vegetables, meat and prawn and the gravy is not heavy either.

General Tao's favourite chicken- Err... too sweet for me. The menu said it is tossed in chilly honey sauce. But the honey part was too much highlighted and there was no hint of chilly. I actually had to add some pepper and vinegar to neutralize the sweetness. Maybe some people love such sweetness. But i will appreciate it if they ask the customer if they will prefer that much sweetness (I had it for the first time. So don't know if it is supposed to be like that only.)

Sankaya- This is there specialty too. the pumpkin pudding is probably made with jaggery and any Bengali will love this warm custard (it is more pudding type) actually in the winter. Also the sweetness is not excess which makes it the best dessert to end a heavy meal.

Overall I enjoyed the experience a lot. I will go back again to explore the diverse cuisine there.
            

(No pic of Sankaya and pan fried noodles as I was too hungry and ate them up)

Heard good reviews about the food at Asia House so thought of calling for delivery for a lunch gathering at office. I was surprised to see how well they had packed the food. The food was delivered on time and was at the right temperature. Quantity and quality of the food is worth a mention too. The quantity was way more than what I had expected.  The soups were brilliant especially the Vietnamese Pho. Everyone loved the soups. They were very different from the soups that we usually have at Asian restaurants. 

For mains we called for Singapore Prawns and Nasi Goreng. The Prawns were good with a pronounced flavor of curry powder in the curry. The Nasi Goreng was the pick of the lot. It was medium spicy with roasted peanuts and vegetables. 

Packaging was good and clean and the delivery boy carried change. Will try the restaurant next time !

Located next to Lake Kali Bari Temple, Southern Avenue. Take the first left after the temple into Lake View Road and you find Asia House on the left.

Interiors are fresh and different. The place is artistically done up with grey cement floor and bamboo ceiling. Vegetable baskets are used as lights and the filament bulbs add a touch of sophistication to the place. I liked the wooden switch boards and black ceiling. I also like the wall paintings and caligraphy. But the special feature is the Buddha wall with small random objects. That's something I have not seen anywhere else.

Food is great to taste and most of all is Ajinomoto Free. A special mention to the Chicken Takrai and Shanghai Hawkers Souo which was superb. I recommend the Thai Burnt Garlic Rice and General Tao's Fish for mains and Sankaya for dessert . Food is great in terms of taste and quantity and service is prompt and polite. Highly Recommended !

Asia House is a lovely new place with the sort of New Modern Asian cuisine that has been taking Calcutta by storm but at extremely pocket-friendly prices! 
Just out for a drive and contemplating which new restaurant to try, my husband and I chanced upon this place and decided to give it a try. The interiors are very interestingly done up incorporating 'Chinese' influences but with a contemporary aesthetic.  It has a very feel-good vibe since every element blends in perfectly. 
And the food! Food is phenomenal. Beautiful flavours. If you didn't remember that you were sitting somewhere around Southern Avenue, you could well be forgiven for thinking that you're dining at some super-expensive (and pocket-pinching) restaurant at a five-star hotel. 
We ordered the Crackling Spinach with Asian Spices for starters and a vegetarian Balinese Curry with steamed rice and Singapore Prawns for Mains. They were all excellent, but special mention to the curry. Better than any I have ever had! We ended our meal with the delicious Fried Icecream.
I highly recommend Asia House to all food-lovers. You will not be disappointed! And we, of course, will be going back for sampling some of their other stuff.

Chanced upon this newly opened place with a friend for lunch. The interiors of the place are fabulously rustic yet luxurious and restaurant is awfully well managed. It has a fresh young vibe to it with wall paintings and bamboo ceilings which gives the feel of sitting in a Chinese hut. Seating is comfortable and the floor staff is humble and well trained. We called for the Spicy Malaysian Curry, Steamed Rice, Sliced Fish in Chilli Wine Sauce and the Mee Goreng. Food was great and was served hot. Service was prompt and we appreciated the addition of modern flavors to the dishes. Prices are reasonable and inclusive of taxes. A thoroughly enjoyable meal at a highly recommended restaurant!!

I recently tried this rustic interiors place on Lake View Road. Loved the interiors with wall paintings, Bamboos on the ceiling, cement flooring and Chinese alphabets on the pillars.
Now the menu - Brilliant take on the modern Asian cuisine with so many options(PS - I hv never seen a better menu at any Modern Asian cuisine restaurant in India).
Food was really good. Frankly the soups were brilliant. Tried 5-6 items from different Asian cuisines. Loved everything we ate. The quality and quantity of food served were tremendous. Frankly I do feel the prices are on the lower side and need to be hiked up.
All in all an amazing place and a must visit. Will defiantly will be going back very very soon.

Landed up at this restaurant this afternoon with my husband and daughter. it is Located on Lake View Road on Southern Avenue opposite Ashoka Apartments.

The restaurant interiors are great although I am surprised they have not posted any snaps on Zomato of the same because it is easily the best looking asian restaurant in town that I have been to. Rustic brick walls with a raw cement floor which is adorned by shades of orange and black and asian wall paintings. I liked the woodwork too which adds a modern feel to an otherwise rustic place. Chinese bamboos adorn the ceiling and the lights in the restaurant are artistic. They have buddha wall which would be a feature in many a selfies in times to come.

We ordered for Indonesian Chicken Satay, Nasi Goreng and Sankaya for Desserts as we were in an adventorous mood.

The Chicken Satay was perfectly grilled. I was happy to taste the smokiness in the dish which made me believe that the dish had actually been fire grilled rather than pan fried. The peanut sauce served with the dish was also perfect. I have had the same in many places in Bali and the dish was as close to the original as it could be.

The Nasi Goreng rice was also superb. it had been slightly caramelized creating a crisp feel in the mouth and was slightly spicy and sweet. It was garnished with cucumber and peanuts like it should have been.

The Sankaya was a first for me and i liked it a lot. Its Burmese Pumpkin Custard and was served with Vanilla Ice Cream and Cinnamon sauce. I liked it a lot and so did my family. We polished off all the food.

Service was decent with kind smling stewards although I think they need more time to get use to a very modern and different asian menu to other restaurants out there.

Will come back soon for more of their delicacies. Until then, RECOMMENDED !

Two of us friends landed up at this place in the afternoon today while coming out of work. The place is brand new and newly opened. The interiors are very appealing with chinese bamboos and wall paintings. Even more interesting is their menu containing asian dishes from all over the far east. We ordered Thai Papaya Salad, Chicken Momo and Darsaan with ice cream for dessert. The food was very tasty and price was reasonable. Will definitely come back soon.

LOCATION:

Located on the the very prime Lake View Road off Southern Avenue. For those who are not well versed with the location, its the restaurant right beside the Raymond Showroom on Southern Avenue opposite Ashoka Building.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Southern Avenue and its surroundings is fast becoming a food hub with various restaurants and cafes opening in every by lane. For a foodie like me, its a great experience to walk around the bylanes discovering new places to eat. Some have been great and others not so good. Asia House sits on the main stretch of Lake View Road and enjoys prime frontage on the same. The restaurant serves modern Asian Cuisine. For those wondering what that entails, its modern takes on traditional Asian cuisine. The restaurant serves a host of Asian cuisines such as Chinese, Thai, Burmese, Indonesian and Vietnamese. 

The first impression of the exteriors is great. Old textured wall with a black colored Asian window staring into a very impressive looking dining room. I could make out from outside that the place looked great and when I entered the restaurant I was absolutely amazed by the interiors. For appreciators of rustic and artistic looking places like myself, this place can be termed " the best in town". Rustic cement flooring, asian bamboos hanging from the ceiling, fruit vendors baskets which have been converted to lights, filament lamps hanging here and there, wall paintings of a Japanese tree, or Asian caligraphy running through pillars in the restaurant in bright orange which are offset by great modern wooden furniture and arrangements. There is a certain artistic brilliance about the place which needs to be experienced. Orange and black couches adorn the restaurant floor and the chairs have orange upholstery.

I was further notified that the restaurant had opened today. We were a group of four friends and were seated on table overlooking the window.

 WINE & DINE:

We ordered a portion of the Shanghai Hawkers Soup vegetarian and Tom Kha Soup Chicken along with Chicken Takrai Roasted Pork with Black Pepper & Baby Bok Choy and Indonesian Chicken Satay for starters.  This was followed by General Tao's Favorite Chicken, Sliced Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce, Smoked Pepper Fried Rice & Chilli Garlic Noodles.

We were served our order of beverages within 5 minutes of ordering. 

The Shanghai Hawker's Soup was great and hearty. It had a host of fresh vegetables such as mushroom and bok choy and was served in a spicy broth. A soup was seasoned perfectly and had shards of burnt garlic in it which created a plethora of flavors in the mouth. One of the best soups I have had in a while.

The Tom Kha was also great and I was happy to note that they had not made the soup very thick which is a common mistake made my many asian restaurants while making coconut milk flavored soups. The Tom Kha had a hit of Bird's eye chilli and galangal in it and they were generous with the quantity of chicken they used.

Our dish of the day was the Chicken Takrai which contained sliced pieces of crispy chicken, tossed in asian wine, lemongrass, chillies and had a hit of kaffir lime and gondhoraj lime towards the end. The dish had a fantastic balance of sweet, spicy and tangy and I liked the use of pickled chillies in the dish. I will go back for this dish. Its easily the best Takrai I have had in town.

Roasted Pork with Black Pepper and Bok Choy : The pork had been cooked well. It was soft and flavorful and was not chewy or stringy. The Pork had been roasted in in a lot of flavors as the meat itself without the sauce was quite tasty. The dish had black peppercorns which had been roasted, bay bok choy leaves and a soya based semi gravy. I loved the cooking of the pork but felt the dish could have done with less black pepper.

The Indonesian Chicken Satay was once again great. The chicken skewers had been grilled perfectly so as to char just right. They had smoked the skewers and coated it with lemongrass which gave it a punch and an authenticity to the flavors and this was served with peanut sauce which was sweet and buttery. Simply loved it !

The General Tao's Chicken had sliced pieces of chicken in a chilli honey sauce. If you like sweet chicken preparations, you should go for this one. I found the dish to have great flavors. The chef also did not make the dish over sweet which was a plus.

Sliced Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce was spicy as the steward said it would be. I dont like very spicy food so I did not eat this dish. But my friends relished it and polished off the same.

The Smoked Red Pepper fried rice was very good. While it had the flavors of smoked red chillies and a great aroma about it, it was not overtly spicy and I really liked the same. Would go back for this one too !

We also called for a Chilli Garlic Noodles Chicken. The aroma of the noodles was great. It had been tossed in roasted chilli paste and garlic flakes. I liked the addition of burnt garlic to the noodles which gave a typical dish a not so typical yet flavorful dimension.

PRICING:

Very reasonable for what they offer. It costed us Rs. 400/ head and we were expecting the bill to be much more with way they place looked and felt.

POINT TO NOTE:

While the restaurant had just opened, I found it to be very well organized with the stewards well informed and the kitchen producing food on time. The owner was on her toes over seeing and instructing the staff and correcting where they were going wrong. It was great to see this !

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

A thing of beauty is a joy forever ! Please do maintain your one of a kind beautiful interiors, quality of food and service. Do not let time & crowds get the better of you !

VERDICT:

One of the asian restaurants to watch out for. They have the potential to be the best modern asian restaurant in the city ! Highly Recommended !
