The quantity of the food is less but the taste is marvellous. The ambience is nice. The environment and lighting adds a smirky feel. The wrap rolls are a must try.

Stand alone taste, quality and service.... Yumminess overload... We started our course with tomato dhania shorba... I am really not a big fan of shorba but this sure made me change my mind....the consistency and taste was calling out perfection perfection perfection... The tanginess of the tomatoes with the freshness punch or coriander was another level... Next comes the garlic bread... Now i imagine its a very commonly had dish... This one tho had a twist... Presented in a very unique way... Skewed rightfrom the center there was this burj alarab of garlic and bread... Infused with mozerella, red and yellow peppers and a hint of basil.... There was technique there was bag of flavours there was sophistication and there was a shout.... I want more... Absolutely flawless... Last comes the pizza.. Now this is the one I would like to rate 5/5.... This tandoor pizza just takes u by surprise... Thin crust but cooked in tandoor... And Indian blend of Italian recipe... Cottage cheese, zucchini, peppers and onions... And outburst of slurrpiness... Beautifully cooked... Wonderfully plated up... That plate sure can play with ur mind... The chef sure knows to make his eaters want more n more... Kudos to him...
We also ordered a course of sizzler which i would rate 2/5
And A pesto Khandvi which could be given 3/5
Green apple cooler 4.5/5
Kokam cooler 5/5
 Overall and exotic and modern food with Indian idealism... Would sure love to come back here....
Would like to give a hi-fi to the chef and the management.... Good work guys

Best food at cheap rates. Good ambiance. Friendly staff. Kitchen closes a bit early. Perfect lighting's and crowd.  They Should include alcohol in their menu or at least hookah otherwise it was the perfect place for parties. Do give it a try.
We were 6 people and we ordered 6 dishes i.e pasta pizza chilly garlic noodles Maggi kababs, garlic bread and baby corn chilli. We got the bill of just 1500 
Isn't it pocket Friendly??

Looks tiny but very spacious. The food was lip smacking and the menu had really good options to choose from. I ordered the afghani platter and each element was done delectably. The cheesecake and choc a bloc were done really well. The soya burger can be improved. It‚Äôs small and a bit of average in taste. I had a really hearty meal and didn‚Äôt burn a hole in my pocket.

A very nice place with beautiful decor and ambience. A good place for the vegetarians and for the non vegetarians to hang around with their vegetarian friends :D 
Okay so we went there in the year ending week, and to start with we ordered The Great Garlic Bread, White Sauce Pasta and after reading so much about the dish with a twist we ordered The Pesto Khandvi. Okay to begin with The Great Garlic Bread the presentation was awestruck, it bread was pushed in through a seekh with overloaded cheese which was literally melting down,  the dish got our hearts there itself, it tasted good as well, the bread was fluffy and soft. Next moving on to white sauce pasta it was a regular one only nothing extraordinary. Pesto Khandvi comes next on table, I found it a little watery (may be because I gulped it in, in just one go) but the taste was good (though one should go for it only if they like khandvi, because there's not much difference besides the fact that the khandvi batter was pestofied). Next we ordered Mezze Mazze (The Mezze Platter) again the presentation was good but I  didn't like the way the Pita Bread was filled reluctantly. The dips were good in taste, overall the platter was okay to taste. 
Coming to the staff and service. The service was good, the food was brought to table on time but yes there they do not help you in getting your food from the dish to your plate, it's like "do it yourself".
All in all it was a positive atmosphere and can be given a try. 
Thank you :)

I‚Äôve been contemplating to try out this place since a long time and finally I happened to step in today with my childhood friends. The decor is bright and spacious. In the beginning I found the menu too confusing to start off with but once we had the pesto khandvi which was mind blowing it became easier to order the rest. Popeye‚Äôs chaat was very satisfying as It reminded me of Delhi street chaat. The watermelon feta salad was ok not bad. The Thai thali was also ok I wasn‚Äôt too excited by it. In drinks. The cold coffee and green apple mojito were perfect.I really would like to go back and try out the Indian options next time.

It is rarely one goes to a place which serves fusion food which both tastes and looks good. Their Popeye chat (spinach papdi chat) is good and so is their pesto khandvi. The som tam salad sauce is very different and nice. Their green apple mojito completes the meal. The servings are good and prices are moderate. All in all a nice place for a decent meal. The best part is their bill which comes with a plant and a bottle with seeds which you can take home :)

This cafe is on the first floor and on the main road. It's very easy to spot. When you enter the cafe, the ambience is very close to nature and they even sell seeds to you if you want them.

Coming to the food we ordered, Green Apple Mojito for drinks. The drink was quite fresh and one could get the taste of green apple. For food we first ordered their very famous dahi kebabs. However, they weren't up to the mark at all. They were deep fried due to which the skin had become kind of hard and the filling of dahi was quite a lot, which brought down the taste of it. I wouldn't recommend anyone to order these. We then ordered their cottage cheese broccoli sizzler. The sizzler was quite nice except for the fact that the cottage cheese pieces were quite huge. Given that cottage cheese doesn't has its own flavor it didn't taste good after few bites. Apart form it the rest of the sizzler was good. For deserts we ordered paan panacotta, which was really good. It was probably the best dish that we had here. It had the perfect taste of paan and the panacotta was perfectly made. I could easily go for a second serve of this desert. 

Overall the service was fast. It's a good place to chill out on a lazy afternoon. 

TL;DR - good drinks and deserts, quick service, worth one time visit.

Its the festive season and my friends and I planned to hangout. We came across this place on Zomato and decided to give it a try.

The place is extremely nice and cozy and gave Christmas vibes.

My friends ordered Chocolate Peanut Butter Shake and Gems Bubblegum Shake and they liked it.

Then we ordered Dimag ka Dahi, Nachos and Mezze Mazze and all three were good, especially, dimag ka dahi which is basically dahi kababs with the usual mint and coriander chutney.

Also, their presentation is commendable!

Bonus points to them for playing all Enrique songs and taking us back to our school days when his songs were on repeat in our playlists.

However, just a small let-down was their service. No it wasn't slow... It was too fast! üòÖ

Overall, a good place to chill!

The food was amazing here! I had mushroom soup which also had a crisp bread. Believe me, this would be the crispiest bread you could ever have! They serve garlic bread in a skewer in upright position which is not something that you would expect, very new presentation. Must try the "Kaboom" sizzler for paneer lovers. Ambience was also great. The staff is also very good and service is fast too. I would rate the restaurant 5/5.

Location-opposite Nina showroom and Pantaloons on camac street on the first floor.

We were looking for a good vegetarian cafe, it being a saturday and we landed u here.

It had all.the cafe essentials from Italian pastas and pizzas to Indian starters and a host of beverages and desserts.

We ordered a pesto creamy sauce pasta and hot chocolate.

To our utter disappointment, the pasta was not worth it at all, and the sauce was so thin, felt like water.

Coming to the hot chocolate, I know it is a difficult bet, but here to it disappointed us more than expected.

Coming to the decor and ambience-, it is really a cool and well maintained place and very well laid interiors too.

It can have be less clumsier though.

Staff was courteous and prompt.

Pocket pinch, I would say is on a slightly higher side.

Had been there a few days ago.  We had taken the dimag ka dahi (dahi kebab). A unique dish with a crunchy outer coating and a soft dahi filling inside which is sweet. This is a decent one. The quantity however is less. The strawberry cheesecake shake was pretty good served with 2 wafers wrapped in a paper and tied to the bottle. The pasta in  alfredo sauce was an average dish with  a very runny sauce which is not at all creamy and thick. And it did not have that zing in it. The ambience is very pretty and service is really good as well.
The food can improve though.
You can visit this place once.

Ambiance and decor was beautifully done by the management.

We went for a lunch at Sunday afternoon. Place was crowded at that time.

We ordered Gondhoraj and Litchie Mojito for drinks.

Drinks were served in a jar like container looks indentical. Tasted good but a bit sweeter.

From starters we tried Mushroom Packed. Which was stuffed Mushroom and deep fried. Loved it.

Main course we had Alfredo pasta. It was also good.

Service and hospitality was very good. Will visit soon again.

The cafe has some notebook games just to pass time, a screen playing sports mostly, newspaper and other things to keep you entertained. I've visited this place 3 times already and plan to go visit again. The interiors seem eco friendly and well done.
Food recommendation - Watermelon Feta cheese salad is excellent, but everything I've tasted so far has been great. Haven't been disappointed so far!

Entertain underwritten!

Just a push can trigger your whole impulse to accomplish the longing you have for it. So did my friends, they had accorded the idea and I executed it. And this time site was Cafe 4/1. 

Magnificently adorned in modern style. And indeed it's first impression was A1 to us. Nevertheless, it's a vegetarian eatery house. And being carnivorous, some of us didn't appreciate the menu. However, my offer to taste every food of the world was accepted and we decreed for baked cheese berry globe, and it's appearance just took us aback. Man, it was something! Besides globe, there were strawberry cheesecake shake, chocolate peanut butter shake. And indeed they are signatures. Admired every sip of them. And our final call was on latte and Tandoor momo. And this time too they stroke hard to our heart to imprint their signature. Thus, I would like to rate 

Ambience 5/5
Food 5/5 
Presentation 5/5 (I would prefer to give more than 5).
Service 4/5

Hence, I would suggest you guys to visit this place. You will surely cherish it.

Thanks for reading. Follow me on Instagram/ Zomato or on chakravarty8supratik.wordpress.com

This cafe has a very calm and composed ambiance. You can drop in with your friends for a small chitchat.
The food offered is one of the best in the town. It seems as if each delicacy has been prepared with extra care.
I ordered a white sauce pasta and a Choc a bloc volcano.
Both were super delicious. The dessert was simply amazing in its presentation and taste both. 

Second visit -
After having a great experience from the first visit, I definitely went there for the second time. But this time I was disappointed, the food was not up-to the mark,
The great garlic bread only looks great, tastes not good at all. 
Also the pasta was very plain
The tomato soup was decent though.

Usually I refuse to go to an all veg place but this was persuasively recommended and accompanied to by a fellow carnivore friend of mine and I was rather pleased with her choice. My first meal in Kolkata after I moved here was at 4/1 and we ordered a mixed pasta, dahi ke kebab or whatever it is that they called it and my favorite hot chocolate and a blue berry cheese cake for her. They were all spot on in flavor and presentation and needless to say we were full and flying on our way down the cafe stairs. The ambience is a sunny yellow just like their China and in the end you ve saved a few chicks their wings too!!

Went to this cafe with a lot of hope as a foodie. And I was not disappointed. This place has got great ambiance and a large seating capacity as well. The decor is modern-chic at its best. Located in camac street right above the showroom of 'Exclusive Lines'.

This is a PURE VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT and doesn't have a bar. This guaranteed few things, that food in all probability will be good, service will be quick and will probably not have loud banging music. And it was so. Going with my mom, I was relieved that the music being played here was soft-instrumental which was quite pleasant. 

 We were a group of three, my mother , wife and myself. Our order consisted of the following: 
1) one portion mushroom soup
2) one cheese garlic bread 
3) one mushroom risotto
4) two gandharaj mint mojito
5) one soyabean rice and sauteed vegetables sizzler. 

All the items were par excellence although the soyabean cutlets served on the sizzler was a tad too deep fried. Other than that, a must visit place. I'll be definitely visiting again because they have an extensive multicuisine menu including indian and Oriental offerings as well. 
Best part is that it's very economical. Total bill for above for our entire order was Rs 1664/- including taxes.

we ordered jain Thali. The food was like home made. I bet every every one will like it. I didn't give 5 star as the rates are bit high, As they provide quantity the rate should be lower. Otherwise delicious!!!

This place has an amazing ambience, good filling food and a huge variety to choose from. Lovely presentations. We ordered "Dimaag ka Dahi"(basically dahi kebab) and "The great garlic bread" for starters. The kebab was amazing, perfect crunch and filling. The garlic bread could've been a bit more cheesy. For the main course, we ordered "Tandoori tray" in which there are assorted kebabs and dal makhani with four types of breads. This was one of the best items. Each and every kebab was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Dal had a lovely texture. Loved it! We also ordered "Pizza ala Vodka". I personally did not like it as there was no vodka present and it didn't taste good either. For desserts we ordered "The Molten Choco Lava Cake" and "Paan Pannacota". The lava cake was mesmerizing...the best one I had till date. Presentation- on point, taste- on point. It was just perfect. I was quite dissapointed with Paan pannacota as there were bits of supari which made the whole dessert bitter. What's the point of having a dessert if it's not sweet! Overall the experience was good.

Today i went to this place to celebrate my friend's birthday.. it was a good place..we ordered dahi k kebab, tandoori tray, mezza mazze..which were awsome but pizza and pasta were not that great..this place is good for indian food but not for continental dishes..
As per the mocktails..kokum cooler and mohito was great.. don't order peanut butter chocolate shake and chocolate martini..
i just want to add one more information that they dont allowed us to cut or eat the jar cake instead of a birthday cake which i made for my friend's birthday..atleast they should allow as it was my friend's birthday..it was really disappointing for us..even we requested them to atleast allow us the bithday girl to eat one spoon of the jar cake..but they were very rude to this..

Staff/service - very good. Staff suggestions are very much reliable.

Ambience - it's soothing, cute and innovative, but would like to mention one inconvenience regarding sitting in few sections the dinning table parallel to the chairs which was little disturbing for me.
Food - Well, it is the best part. Have been to this place 4-5 times (having so many new options to explore in Kolkata this is the place where I certainly don't mind repeating) and everything tastes amazing with nice presentation and affordable prices.
Even your Rakhi special patter was superb.
Hoping to Hogg in soon.

Surprisingly it turns out to be a marvellous place for Indian be it starters or Kaali daal. The dahi kababs are finger licking.
Nice ambience and good service with amazing presentation and taste overall.
Do try the Indian 
Variety of food is very good 
I like all the items till date I have called for 
Just the non Indian portions are smaller compared to other places but sufficient to relish our food

Very bad experience.. they r understaffed. I had to keep calling the waiters for atleast 10 times to take the order, or to give plates/water/tissues etc. it was quite annoying. The portions are too small and its quite over priced. Definitely not value for the money spent. Taste is quite decent.. not delicious but not too bad either. Only good thing abt the place is the ambience and the presentation. Definitely not in my ‚Äúto-go‚Äù list from now on..!!

So this was my very first visit to cafe 4/1. We just stopped by to have a quick bite whilst shopping and ordered a couple of desserts which was just amazing and beyond words. The brownie was soft and authentic. Cheesecake was mouth-melting. Both the desserts were satisfying with reasonable price. 
Coming to the interior; their sitting arrangements and decoration is nothing unique but holds individuality. 
Folks this is a must try place at least once!!

Was in the vicinity and chanced upon this place. For starters I LOVE the interiors. Such a cute spacious place! It has small plants all around it.

We reached at lunch time and skipped starters as we were starving! We ordered a Tandoori Tray, Made in China and Green Apple Mojito. 

The presentation was on point! The kebabs were soft and tasted perfect. Dal makhni was probably the best I have tasted. Breads accompanying were crisp and perfect to go with it. There were two dips perfectly complementing the kebabs.

Again the presentation was to the point. Noodles, fried rice, munchurian, kimchi salad and baby corn...Everything tasted perfect! The best part was probably the small desert along with it served in a shot glass filled half with dark chocolate!

With food we ordered some green apple mojitos that came in mason jars filled with ice, lemon and lots of mint leaves. Extremely refreshing!

Have nothing to complain about... Pricing is also fine! Definitely will go back soon!

After a disappointing visit to The Fan's Club(due to too loud music),we, group of 5 friends, decided to visit this place having heard a lot about it.
On entering this place, we were quite impressed by it's decor and ambience.Classy,beautiful and bright, it had outdoor seating too.Due to the humidity, we decided to sit inside.Simple yet appealing decor, it's a really soothing & nice place to just relax with pals & family friends over a nice cup of tea/coffee & some decent food.The waiters were courteous and well-mannered.
On coming to the food, we ordered -

1)The Real Burger King - Presented really well, accompanied by potato wedges & lettuce salad,the taste was pretty good. A bit different than the normal burger taste, it was a delightful treat. (4.5/5)

2)Nothing but Nachos - Now the presentation of this dish was pleasantly attractive, but then that was it.The taste was nothing like nachos, it was more like the "nimki" we have with our evening tea.The salsa and mayo spread were also tasteless along with the highly unlikeable yellow-coloured dip.It was really a spoiler, though upon telling them,they told us that these were their own-made nachos & not the normal crispier ones... and thankfully did not charge us for it. (0.5/5)

3)Assam Tea - Was refreshing and good.Nice presentation as well,with separately provided milk. (4/5)

4)British Breakfast Tea - Tasted pretty similar to the Assam tea but waa definitely good. (4/5)

Overall,a decent experience.The place is beautifully designed, with splendid ambience. But yes, it's a tad bit expensive and definitely NACHOS NEED IMPROVEMENT !! As a vegetarian cafe, it's worth a visit.

So basically i was so excited to visit this place because of their menu. oh god! It was hilariousüòÖ Please Do visit their menu  :) so on a rainy day  me and my bestfriend went there. The ambience was good and most attractive part was they decorated that place using recycled items. So for starter we ordered dimag ka dahi which was basically a dahi kebab with some mint sauce.I don't know how they made this but trust me it was delicious. Then on the main course we ordered kaboom sizzler . It was ok .liked the roasted sweet potatoes . And we ordered  paan panacotta from their dessert menu. I think it was a cream cheese with paan flavour. I liked it. So overall being a non vegetarian  I liked that place and their veg menu. :)

Its one LIVELY CAFE. 

Ambiance - Cafe 4/1 gives you that HAPPY kinda feeling once you enter. A BRIGHT SMILEY on the stairs AND YELLOW WALLS that will surely bring a smile. The cafe is somewhere between rustic and way-too-cute ambiance.  I loved the way they covered a wall with small plates/saucers. Anyways.. I can go on describing each and everything. So I better stop here and leave the rest for you guys to explore. FULL POINTS for their ambiance. 

Food - Now coming to this, me and my friend went for a quick breakfast sort of thing.(didnt have much time to go through the menu) So we ended up ordering there famous THE GREAT GARLIC BREAD which was OK, Nothing extraordinary.  BUT there drinks - WOW. LIKE. SERIOUSLY. WOW.

We ordered TANGY MANGO - the drink is so refreshing and WORTH TRYING. I couldn't keep it down. And also tried CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER SHAKE - which was again very classy. And then for dessert we ended up trying BAKED CHEESE BERRY GLOBE - It was a pretty looking dessert but we were disappointed.. didnt like the taste..  

Overall it was a very nice experience. 

Staffs - Friendly. 

IN LOVE WITH THE DECOR and TANGY MANGO ;)

We were in the mood for something sweet when we stopped by this cafe. Located right next to CCD, on Camac Street, one can expect to take a quick look of this place from outside and be rest assured that the experience would definitely be a lovely one. The interior is spacious and the wall decor is filled up with small plants, providing a cozy environment to dine in. We simply went with desserts and order a Chocolate Lava Cake, Choc-a-Bloc Volcano and a Baked Cheeseberry Globe. They were enough to keep us stuffed for a while, really sweet and worth every penny. The service here is quick and the staff is polite too, adding to the overall experience. 
Will try again sometimes to try appetizers and the main courses. Looking forward to it.

It's simply a vegitarian's paradise! You should definitely try their shakes. Their garlic bread is just out of this world; once you've had garlic bread in 4/1 you'll never want to have it from anywhere else. Vodka pizza is a highlight! The ambience is beautiful and their service is incredible :) The only downside is their music - we were there for a whole hour and the single soundtrack that played was Desire.

Update (25 Dec. 2017) - After today's meal, we've decided not to visit 4/1 again. It used to be a cool place for my family to visit but today's visit changed it. The food was before par. Took too much time to process the food and the service was not up to the mark. I believe they just couldn't handle the Christmas surge but if you open your restaurant on Christmas evening, you need to be prepared. The Dahi kebab (dimag ka Dahi) had no taste (it used to be our favorite dish here). When we told the server it doesn't even have salt, he just nodded and went away. This was after we were told our original Dahi kebab had been spoiled and was being prepared again (we had to wait a lot of time). The restaurant was too noisy and we had the unfortunate luck of sitting next to a large group. That aside, the service was really bad. We had to call them twice before the waiter would show up.
We had went there after hearing that the menu had been updated. The newly added Indian food was just OK. Not great.
Overall, this was our last visit to Cafe 4/1. I don't think we are ever going to visit it again after this experience.

Original review (4.5)

One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food and service is awesome coupled with the great environment.

Location - located in camac street near pantaloons, it's situated in one of the best localities in Kolkata. (4/5 for the closeness to the garbage dump)

Ambience - 5/5


Food - The food quality is fantastic and the presentation is great as well. Just the fact that there is not much variety in the menu makes a negative point. 4.5/5

Service - the staff is really great and good at suggesting great options. Food is served quick and you don't have to call twice for the same thing. (5/5)

Overall it's a great place with decent price and good food and service. Recommended for families and friends when going together!

Undoubtedly the food was Gud, ambience was nice but if the service is not upto the mark I believe its not worth going..The garlic bread was awesome, pasta was okish, tandori tray good, apple mojito nice  and other items also eatable but according to me the service was below average.
I went there with my friends nd to say the least we had to change out seatings thrice to adjust with the cafes requirements that too with a clause that we would change again if a big group of people arrive..My evening was spoiled by their behavior so I suggest a skip.

A good place in a perfect area.Food was quite good but when i came there,i've been expecting much better.Quantity was satisfactory as for a group of 5-6 peoples.Heard alot from friends and family members but it wasn't that good and could be more better.No complains for staffs but food quality can be better than now.

This is a pretty little place in Camac street that serves only vegetarian food. The food  at cafe 4/1 is presented very well. I ordered nothing but nachos which tasted well, chocolate peanut butter shake, coffee toffee martini which was your average shake with peanut butter /cold coffee respectively. I also ordered red melange and the made in China thali. Red melange was very good and the flavours just stood out. The Thali was also good, nothing too great however. The bill came to INR 1488 after all this. The ambience is top notch and vegetarians should definitely visit!

It's a nice little cafe on the first floor tucked away in a corner of Camac Street. It's CCD's neighbour and not very hard to find. It's semi-renivated indoor-terrace-garden-cafe with quirky chairs and serviettes with moral-boosting messages. The presentation of menu card was nice (and same as is the trend in most bars and cafes nowadays). Out of the variety of veg dishes we tried Cheeuz Me and Great Garlic bread. The former was commendable. The variety of green tea was also good. We tried two of them and it was wonderful. A sip of the tea, took me to some foggy hill station with a nice morning chill. Overall great place and good value for üí∞.

UPDATES FROM SECOND VISIT

*Mix Sauce Pasta - AMAZING! (5/5)

*Dahi Kabab - Tasted very yummy! A bit sweet though! (4/5)

*Litchi Mojito - Usual! (3.5/5)

*Green Apple Mojito - A little different than what you usually get! (3.5/5)

*Spaghetti Pasta tossed in Olive Oil - Well prepared, you need to develop your taste for it though! (4/5)

INITIAL REVIEW

Well Boys and Girls.. Here I come back with another review..

To be precise, this place is small and an only veg place.¬†

Coming towards the food, here's my inputs.

Food:

The Great Garlic Bread (4/5) - Served in a unique straight standing fashion. This is something which I saw for the first time in a restaurant. Tastes great as well just like it's name!

Tandoori Tray (4/5) - Served with two different types of paneer tikka (since we did not take mushrooms), dahi kabab, tandoori aloo and awesome daal makhaani with 4 types of breads. ¬†This is surely worth your money.

Made in China (4/5) - A full on chinese thali with Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Fried Rice, Noodles, Manchurian and Kimchi Salad. Along with a chocolate roll ofcourse in the centre. Absolute yum in taste!

Drinks:

Coffee Toffee Martini (3/5) - Tasted good initially but was bitter in the later part. Has a tinge of coffee and toffee in it. But the presentation on this drink is surely worth ordering!

Tangy Mango (4.5/5) - This is certainly for Hajmola Toffee lovers. Feels like we are drinking hajmola toffee (red one). Probably the best drink which we ordered!

Green Apple Mojito (3.5/5) - Just one word for it, Average! Nothing beyond expectations.

That's my take on food. Coming towards ambience, a bit more management is to be improved. Waiters were not really great when it came to explaining the food. The outdoor area was not operational which was certainly a ¬†disappointment for us.

Pocket Pinch : All the above in (1x) quantity costed us Rs.1890.
¬†
Overall, a nice place with good food.

Glorious place! Great food! We ate our hearts out.¬†

Vodka pasta - interesting, subtle, satisfying
Thai thali - more than competent with a couple of interesting elements. Great green curry.¬†
Chueeze me - cheesy and hence, cannot be bad. Slightly chewy though.¬†
Pesto khandvi - ingenious concept, smashing execution
Italian cream soda - the one thing not to my liking

How they were plating up these dishes in such less time, I do not know. But there were no cut corners I could see. So great job there too.¬†

PS: The yellow and white decor is such a cutesy, unique touch.

Decor/Ambiance: The decor is lovely and it's a great place to hangout with friends. My only complaints are the seats available for table of 2 are a bit cramped up. The music is average. Since I was waiting alone for a long time, I decided to read a book but the lights are not too bright for reading. They have a lot of books on a shelf but they need to improve on the lighting if they want to encourage more people to read over there.

Servers/Service: Average.¬†

Food/drinks: Haven't tried out any of the food items yet. I ordered cold coffee. It was refreshing but a bit overpriced. This was a regular cold coffee but I have had amazing cold coffee WITH ice-cream at a lesser price in a similar (if not better) kind of place.

Overall view: I might go there again if I am in that particular area but it's not on my "must-visit again" list.

Caught up with friends over evening snacks at cafe 4/1. Loved the ambience and look of the cafe. They have ample seating space with an outdoor section as well. Also, this is vegetarian cafe.
We ordered pesto khandvi, mushroom packed and Thai thali as starters, all of which tasted delicious. For drinks, we got a chocolate peanut butter shake (wasn't overly sweet, which I liked), chatka Mary which was quite chatpata and a cappuccino. Dessert comprised of chocolate lava cake (gooey deliciousness) and baked cheeseberry globe which was ok. The presentation was Instagram worthy.
The bill was for 2000rs for four people which is quite reasonable and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. A great place for catching up with friends over delicious food and drinks. Waiting to visit the cafe again and trying more of their yummy dishes.

This was my second visit to this place with my friends. I will keep coming back to this place for it's rustic ambience alone which is perfect for 'adda'. Other than that, the food tastes awesome. We had ordered the garlic bread which is absolutely yummy, except for the fact that it is slightly overpriced I have nothing to complain. We also ordered a lasagne and a margarita pizza. Both were incredibly tasty. The pizza had a thin crust and enough cheese to satisfy a cheese lover like me. It was perfect. Coming to the lasagne, this was the second time we ordered lasagne because this is another dish I crave and it tastes so delicious that I forget all those beef,lamb,chicken lasagnas for a while. This time the staff somehow misunderstood our order and served us a platter which really looked great but we did not have it and I have no idea what it's called. We'll make sure we try that on our next visit.

We went to this one afternoon while on a shopping spree in the nearby bk market and emami market. 1stly i very much loved the decor. it's a very neat and tidy place with interesting seating and more interesting lighting.. the space is quite big compared to the number of tables it has.. so it'll give you the spacious feel. Coming to the food, it's a vegetarian restaurant bt it surprised me an ardent non-veg. We had ordered a mushroom packed for the starters. Then we had pizza.. bt i forgot the name. Point is the food is very good and tasty. And we loved it. It was quite easy on the pocket too.

Located at the heart of Camac street, this restaurant is hard to spot at first. The only identification being a large board with a simple 4/1. But after you enter, you will be amazed how spacious it is. The seating arrangements with a mix of both high chairs and couches are great if you are planning for a hangout with friends.

Pros -
i. A unique cottage-ish ambience, very comfortable for your senses.
ii. Friendly Staff.
iii. Good selection of shakes and other beverages.

Cons -
We didn't order any food, just a couple of shakes, so couldn't see any downside to this place.

Overall -
Will definitely be visiting here again to try the food, cuz the ambience was too mellow and calm. 

Edit - 
After another visit, I am giving 0.5 more to my review. Undoubtedly cafe 4/1 is the best location to hangout with friends in Camac st area. It is peaceful and quiet, plus the pizza has been awesome.

Cafe 4/1 is an amazing garden cafe and eatery. You will not just love the ambience but also the food. Yes it is a vegetarian place but me being a full on non vegeterian really loved this place. They have a private seating as well for parties. We ordered for a mushroom starter, pizza and the chocolate volcano. The food was really worth the money. Must visit peeps.

A lot of people tend to avoid this cafe because it's vegetarian. But, trust me if you will, they have dishes that'll blow your non-veg tastebuds, honestly. As I must comment on the interior, allow me to tell you what a great place it is, with all that greenery and rustic interiors. Love at first sight. I will recommend their CHEESECAKE (must have) and I also tried their MEZZE PLATTER, which was filling and delicious. They give you seeds as a keepsake. Love.

4/1 cafe at Camac street was recomended for lunch . A veg place it is larger than i expected with outdoor place for parties . The menu has a variety and we landed up with Dimsums and Thai Thali . The dimsums were large and soft . The filling was abundunt . What was surprising was the filling was more like a sabzi with indian spices . So donot expect the regular dimsum .They were large and eight . Good to share, same filling so do to be decieved by colur .

The thai platter is enough for one . so unless one has another starter please do not think of sharing it . However since both me and my friend are small eaters and the dimsums were heavier than normal we were glad that the platter was smallish . The spring rolls were crisp and i enjoyed it . The noodles somehow were made in Indian masalas and did not have Thai flavouring .

The thai papaya salad was very good and so was thai green curry . The coconut mousse with vanilla flavoring was also good .
The service is good and ambience is also pleasant . Pocket friendly .

One of the rare occasions when I visit a vegetarian cafe. This place is easy to spot, next to Wills Lifestyle in Camac Street. The ambiance is quite good. 

Ordered a Couch Potato and a Cinnamon tea. Tea was good. Couch potato (tandoori aloo) was great. 

Service is good. The Management just needs to pay more attention to the tables and chairs which need some maintenance work.

Located where barista lavazza existed on camac street...between tanishq showroom and rolex watch store.  The place is well done up given a woody look. 
Staff is also nice. Food is good too. Some items can be made better though. 
#Lychee Mojito- taster weird. Not good. 
#green apple mojito- tasty. Refreshing. 
#veg pizza with mushroom- thin crust and yummy. Loved it. 
#pasta in white sauce- lacked flavour. Was little bland. Could be improved. 
#coffee panna cotta- if u like pana cottas u will like it. 

Overall decent. Good for vegetarians.

The place has a very young and soothing vibe going on. The seats are cozy and comfortable. 
We had ordered a cold coffee.It was extremely refreshing and immediately calmed our senses down.
The waiter serving us was ill mannered and passing sarcastic remarks.
Even though our drink was quite good the sever's behavior spoiled our entire experience.

Located in the bustling camac street is this uber cool, refreshing, gothic cafe that will just leave you mesmerised with their palpable offerings! We had the chocolate peanut butter shake, strawberry cheesecake and the great garlic bread-an indulgence that will linger for quite sometime now! Beautiful & creative presentation is what makes them stand out amongst the new cafes sprouting in the city every now & then. Next time you are in the vicinity, do check-in!
Highly recommended üëå

Top notch ambiance, fells like in goa, a higher score for the interiors and seating, loved the bolt seating. Coming to the food, we were there after lunch hours, 3 pm to be more specific, so most of the items of their innovative menu was not available and some marked with stars were only to choose from. Their nachos was average on taste and garlic bread was below average, though very high on presentation.

Tried a unique drink 'chatka marry' it was just a guava based drink but the ice in it was flavoured which made it unique. Tried 2 pannacota there, a coffee one which was as it should be, but what stood out was pan pannacota, nowhere near to what I have tried so far, awsome flavours.
Will visit again in some time when their other kitchen is active to try their other stuffs.

This is where Barista used to be once. It is a cosy place and ideal for a lazy chat with a friend or even if you want to spend an evening by yourself. The staff is very friendly. My friend and I were in a 'mushroomy' mood so we ordered two mushroom items - mushroom packed and mushroom tikki. Mushroom packed was really yummy, but can't say the same for the Tikki. The Tikki was too soft and the taste was not that good. We also had Naan pockets which were interesting - they were almost like nachos filled with tandoori vegetables - quite tasty.

I had heard about this place a lot and finally decided to visit last Friday. The ambience of this cafe is awesome. We ordered the following :-

1. Strawberry Cheesecake Shake :- With strawberry waffers as complimentary, this cheesecake shake was absolutely tasteful and flavour was too good.

2. Kokum Cooler :- Flavour was absolutely up to mark. Very refreshing and one should definitely try this .

3. Made in China :- Chinese platter with Noodles, Fried Rice, Babycorn, Manchurian, Salad and Chocolate shoot was delicious. Quality and quantity both were up to the expectations. Two people can easily share one platter as quantity is too much.

4. Vodka Pasta - Pasta with new flavour. It  was one of the new things that I came across. Absolutely Fantastic !!

Last but not the least , our meal ended with dessert.

5. Paan Panna cotta - This is the best dessert I have came across in recent times. It's just liking icing on the cake. Meal was easily complimented with such a delicious dessert.

P.S :- Do try paan pana cotta !!!

Looking for another visit to this cafe .

4/1 Camac Street is the address. Cool and calm decor ! 
Descent staffs. But really had a great expectations. But endpoint was not at all good ! Though the presentation of the goods were good but tastebuds were not tickling at all. 
Need to improve their food quality as per my taste is concern. Price is higher than estimated. All veggies items. So management should look forward to serve quality tasty food. The classic retro style ambience is good. Somehow they should come up with more emphasis on the food taste.

Then coffee toffee martini .. this was amazing served in a glass with a chocolate being attached with a clip..
Gandaraj mojito.. whivh was v soothing and good in quantity 
And there was one mithai type dessert .. having 4 small shot glass.. with Bengali sweet served lil hot.. it was good!

I visited this cafe for desserts after a lunch at a non-veg place. The interior is simple and maintains a cafe ambiance. The place was crowded and there was hustle-bustle going on. The service was slow and the waiters are not prompt. Maybe they need more people to manage the crowd.¬†
We ordered the following stuffs-
Chocolate peanut butter shake- the presentation was awesome. Served in a tall glass, there was a small pouch attached to it which was loaded with pea-nuts. It tasted pretty good. But this is a very heavy kind of drink and you may not prefer it if you are planning to have a hearty meal soon after.
Nespresso- This is the expresso named with an extra N. It was served in a big beer mug and it tastes just like coffee.
Chocolate Lava Cake- This is a gooey chocolate cake served in a cup with vanilla icecream with is served in a separate chocolate-cup. The presentation is pretty innovative and it tastes good too.

All over it was a nice experience.

Above the rolex showroom on camac street, Cafe 4/1 truly is all about what its tagline speaks of "exotic food and great plating". The decor is well thought of giving a completely fresh look and feel right from the moment you take the first steps to climb up to the cafe.
The food is plated brilliantly and tastes lip smacking. I had ordered garlic bread, mix sauce pasta and Chatka Mary (as suggested by the waiter). The drink blew my mind away with the concept and so did the garlic bread. 
Overall it was a very delightful experience and given an opportunity I would surely pay another visit to this place.

Nice Ambience.. Good Service.. Reasonably priced and to top it all.. Amazing food. Remember visiting this place some time back. What stands out is the food presentation. They have their own unique ways when it comes to plating and serving the food. Located in the busy Camac Street very close to Pantaloons and hence easy to locate. Only catch is that it serves only pure vegetarian. Do visit if you happen to be nearby!

Honestly I was expecting a lot from this cafe but left the place in disappointment. Firstly I don't know why they charge 75 bucks for mineral water. I think they don't know about the new rule that nothing extra other than the exact price mentioned on the mineral water package is charged. So please read this report from Hindustan times. (Sale of packaged water and soft drinks above MRP (Maximum Retail Price) ‚Äî including at airports, multiplexes and hotels ‚Äî will attract stringent penal actions like fines and jail term, Consumer Affairs Minister¬†Ram Vilas Paswan¬†said on Friday.) 
I liked the ambience, staff and the food. However I felt the quantity of "maid in china" was less and could have been more spicy. Choco lava cake was also nothing extra ordinary. Tbh their food looks appealing, worth a Instagram share but does not satisfy soul. 
And I think this cafe dupe customers in name of service tax and service charges.

A "different" cafe serving vegetarian food in the business district of Kolkata is a real gem. Innovative seating arrangements with delightful decor spruces up the mood of any foodie. The idea of Board games to keep a merry gang busy is quite commendable. Tasted Green Apple mojito , roasted couch potatoes and nachos. Highly recommended.

Full marks to aesthetics-both the interiors and the presentation were on point!
We ordered an aglio olio,a Kaboom Sizzler,Mojitos and Kokum coolers,all of which were amazing!
The Sizzler was specifically a great assortment.
The Brownie with ice cream (and another dessert hose name I don't quite remember)were the perfect end to an incredible meal.
The staff was quick and helpful.
The ambience was so hip,lovely playlist!
Definitely recommend this little place!

Cafe 4/1 is a dainty cafe with quite an interesting seating arrangement....the ambience is nice and quirky. Coming to the food, we ordered a mushroom packed, tandoori tray and kokum cooler & cold coffee to go with. The food was delicious and well presented. 
The food served represents a modern take on traditional food items.
It's hard to find a decent vegetarian restaurant/cafe in Kolkata that serves food which is pleasing to the eyes as well as the taste buds.

Would luv to go again to try out other dishes.

Heard a joyous welcome chant of the young army around the place?Maybe you missed it. Don't worry, you'll be greeted again by a young sapling sitting atop your table. Cafe 4/1, a place lost in its quaint setting, grooving to peppy music, lit up in dim light, preparing your senses for a wonderful feast. You can talk to the napkins near you, they have a message(literally!) and you can hear the Chatka Mary calling out to your thirsty throat. And how can you miss the whispers of the tiny mousse shot, luring you to have a bite! You can definitely not resist your hands gravitating towards The Real Burger King and all the stuff spread across your Made in China platter. Your tongue is in for a spicy treat with the Thai Local presented in an unconventional way. The pesto pasta might disappoint but the fine Lasagne will make up for it.
This was my experience woven into a poetry of sorts. Loved the ambience and the food. The cost for 2 mentioned seems pretty appropriate.

The food and teas were good. But the service was very bad. Almost like they didn't want to serve anybody and were very happy relaxing. The place was completely empty but didn't let us sit on any of the tables we wanted. First some table was reserved for their MD. For God's sake, shouldn't the owner know to put his customers first. No wonder the staff is so pathetic. Even the other tables they didn't want to let use, even though there was no one else the entire time we were there. Very weird. They might as well change their attitude if they want to survive.

This place is my Forever Favourite Place.
This place will never fail to satisfy your taste. Interior is styled like English  Cafes. 
However it has very slow service when crowded. I had to wait for more than 45mins for my Pizza which almost kills the mood to eat. Otherwise the waiters are really Generous and Calm!
My all time favourite food here is: Strawberry Cheese Shake(must must try), Veg Lasagne, Nachos.
It has a mixed crowd of families as well friends. 

Highly recommended place! 
However *Rating 5* is not given because of really slow service, when crowded.

Probably the last from my circle to get here. Obviously had expectations on the interior. Surprisingly It did catch my eyes. Frugal and eye catching. The Green Concept did bring a smile to my face.
¬†¬†
Food Ordered:
1 Vodka Pasta - As per the menu i expected to it to be a bit spicy . Although the taste was good but the spice expectation didn't catch up.
1 Lasagne- Again another serving that tasted good but the quantity leaves you disappointed.
1 Hot chocolate and green Apple Mojito: these are our usual drink orders unless we wanna try something new so if it's good we know it and it was good.

Service:
Quick, cordial and good.

Recommendation: Ofcourse yes

Next Visit: Very soon.

This is a gem of a place and great for vegetarians. The decor is fantastic. It's an ideal place to hang out with friends over great food. Ambience is superb and the staff is very cordial. My absolute favourite is their MI:3 Pizza. Do opt for that if you love mushrooms. Very unique way of presenting their food, especially the garlic bread which delivers both in taste and presentation. Also tried their nachos, they were good but I've had better. But the chocolate peanut butter shake was absolute heaven! Loved it.

Will absolutely visit again. :)

Now this place is good news for vegetarians like us, infact very good news. We have visited this place like 4 times now so that itself says something. I really like how the cafe has been done - very earthy yet contemporary. Just that some of the seats are not very comfortable. The menu is quite balanced to suit all ages and taste buds. Now coming to food, i like most of the stuff here. We have tried most of the items on the menu in our many visits here and almost all are quite good. Some of the presentations are also nice. I think the pizza can be slightly better though. Overall, you can expect us many more times. Cheers :)

Cafe 4/1 is the kind of place Calcutta has been needing since a long time, the decor is up to mark to similar restaurants in other cities and so is the food. 

We tried a variety of dishes here such as the cheesy nachos, the peanut butter chocolate shake and the basmati pesto. All were spot on in taste as well as presentation. Great work by the team.

Only downside for me was that it's a pure veg restaurant and doesn't serve alcohol, in my opinion that would have been a great add but at the end of the day, that decision lies with the owner.

Do follow us on Instagram for more photos and reviews of restaurants. (The name is same on Instagram)

Heard a lot about this place so ordered two Indian Thali. Would say that the food taste was mediocre with only Dal Makhani being descent. Other main course dishes like Paneer and Mix Veg were very spicy. Breads were not up to the mark. Quantity in one thali was good enough for one person but quality and taste were lacking. Given the price of thali that is charged it ought to be far better than what it is. Will not recommend and will restrict the place to coffee at best.

The place has done Justice with the interiors. Nothing out of the block but a small and cosy place. Had a family dinner but the service and food were all well presented and served. The Dhai ke kabab was off simply delicious. Their were other dishes too but nothing beat this one. The drinks menu bought the child in me. Had chocolate bubble gum shake. Beautiful presented and equally great in test. I loved the place. 
The Chinese thali as it was called was the only a bad choice of the night. Need to make better choices and the restaurant needs to make it taste better. 

Did not get my hands on many dishes so would be visiting soon to tear the menu apart.

It took me almost 8 months to finally be able to visit this place and I totally loved it!! Warm and particularly bright entrance with impressive interiors lead you into the fun set-up that is this place. I ordered the garlic bread, the mezze platter, wantons, pasta and pizza off the fanciful menu, all of which both looked and tasted uniquely good. The drinks were refreshing as well. An add on was the quick service and the friendliness displayed by the staff. With the possibility of covered outdoor seating, it's a fairly big arrangement where one can enjoy with friends and family. Oh and they also have a variety of board games and books to help one spend more time inside! A cool choice for a lazy afternoon/evening, definitely worth a visit!!

Not every vegetarian restro in this city manages to give the non vegetarian joints a hard competition. But the scenario is pretty different in case of this eccentric cafe with its Whimsical menu and calming decor. The menu is a extensive one with stellar vegetarian dishes jotted one by one. The food tastes as good as the names Sound.
Do try their shakes, I had the best cheesecake shake in a very long time, with all the right elements in right proportions.
If you ask for recommendations I would definitely name the vodka pasta and The Mocambo Cous Cous hua which a soya and couscous burger having enough potential to give a meat burger a rum for its Money.
Highly recommended !

Food is well presented , especially love the tandoori platter.Better dal makhni than even jai hind.Probably the best dal in town,no jokes.I used to mind the Vegetarian only fare but have become used to their delicious food now.The chatka mary and pineapple -ginger banana concoction is also something i order every time i am there and they have consistently delivered the same quality and portion.

This is not a one off place,they are consistent in their food and drinks ,so hats off to them for that.

What an amazing dinner we had today. This Cafe that is on Camac street is wonderful in terms of ambience and food. The place is wonderfully decorated with plants and books. Their tables have quirky designs like chess board and bar stools which immediately catch your eye. They also have an outdoor section through its not open air. 

  Two of us ordered 4 dishes to eat. 
1. Started with Thai local. - which was simply delicious. The peanut sauce was yum. We asked for extra sauce and they gave it as well. 
2. The Real Burger - this was quite sad and frankly I could have done without it. 
3. Mi 3 pizza - the star of our night. The pizza with 3 types of mushrooms goat cheese feta cheese and pesto was the highlight of our meal. Yum yum yum. 
4. Choco lava cake - trust me if you are here this is a dish you MUST end your meal with. It melts in your mouth. It's sweet and perfect for chocolate lovers like me, comes with ice cream. Simply indulging. 

Pocket pinch - 1300 including taxes which is quite affordable. Staff was courteous. Good and prompt service. Good experience. Would definitely recommend this lovely cafe to people. 

I would like to mention the tissue papers that caught my eye. Each paper with a printed line which would motivate you. Kudos to the management for doing such a great job with the d√©cor.

Still the same. No improvement at all. Poor & discourteous staff.very ordinary & over priced menu .

Went to this cosy place Friday evening , had heard a lot about this cafe.  I was surprised  to read in menu about veg thali in between continental and Italian  dishes.  Myself an ardent fan of indian food could not resist to order. Staff was courteous  enough to bring that after some time till i finished my soup. presentation of thali was awesome and it consisted a dal makhani,  mix veg,  panner sabji.  four small breads nan,  roti, kulcha and paratha . Jeera rice was not upto the mark and tastewise very dull.  All other were very aromatic and tasty.  Would visit second time for lunch . One thing was not acceptable they charged for one pcs of extra papad please take note of that.

Initial idea was to visit a carnival, which being really boring decided to go to a caf√© and instantly this caf√© came to mind. With lot's of hope we left for this caf√©.
It totally surprised me. The entrance was really cute with a big smiley on the stairs. The caf√© was beautifully decorated with plants and had a rustic feel to it. Coming to the food, it was impressing because usually either the caf√© is good looking or the food is tasty, but here I got both the elements. The price was pocket friendly and totally worth visiting it again and again.

Visited this cafe with my friend. Nice place with good ambience ..... The food was good... We ordered a chinese thali, green apple mojito, veg clear soup with dumplings, great garlic bread and cold coffee... Their presentation was very good.... Food was tasty.... But the best part was when the bill came, there was a small glass bottle with sunflower seeds and a message " lets grow together ".... This we could take home.... This truly was a cute gesture and kudos to them for coming up with this.... Thank you Cafe 4/1 for this and all the best to you guys... Hope to visit you soon....!!!

The d√©cor and ambience is good. The staff is friendly and the service was quick too. The food lives up to the expectations but the presentation was outstanding. Never seen such innovative stuff. The antique lamps add to the old world champ.To add to that u have a view of Camac Street below.One point of improvement could be the menu. I think the menu could be more attractive and self explanatory. Overall a nice experience. Thank you.

This is one happening place. Love the food and the ambience here. Even though finding a seat is always difficult. 

I loved the wanton soup here. It's so light and refreshing. With a clear base and steamed wantons . 

The drinks are the best part. The lemon and mint iced tea is a show stealer. The drink is so fresh and natural. It's after ages have I had such an amazing cooler. 

The other drink was cold coffee. It was light, refreshing and totally coffeelicious. 

The vodka pasta was fabulous. The pungency of the tomato sauce, offset with the depth and dryness of vodka was decadent. 

The Indian tandoori platter was a but disappointing. The paneer was tough. The roti a bit too chewy. But day was the creamiest vest and the dahi kebab decadent. Melts in mouth. 

It was a great great meal.

we visited this cafe on a Saturday evening and the place was almost fully occupied by guests of all age group. there were teenagers, families and 60's couple. the decor has been kept simple. no fancy wall decals or flooring.. i assume the owner ¬†wanted the food to speak and not the place. and so it was. this is a vegetarian joint and we ordered couch potatoes as starter, oven baked pizza and lasagna as main course. what caught our attention was the uniqueness of presentation of starter. imagine potatoes sitting upright and arriving on a couch. it was indeed. the taste too was as good as the presentation. so was with lasagna and pizza. just amongst the best available in kolkata. ¬†staffs were courteous and service quick efficient. what more does a diner want? ¬†the ubiquitous tissue papers had few one liners printed on it too. i will definitely suggest this place to those who want to eat quality food in a nice comfy atmosphere within a reasonable price. cost for 2 would be around 1100.

Location-Camac street,opposite raymond showroom.

This place has been bookmarked by us since we came to know about it and today finally we got a chance to visit this place.Its a pure vegetarian cafe designed in an european style which is mainly known for its platting and exotic food.

Service-The service at this place is not upto mark.They were quite slow at serving the dishes and were not properly trained with the dishes.

Ambiance-The ambiance is the only reason for a visit to this place.This place is very calm and soothing and had great interiors with a light music been played in the background all the time.

Food-The food at this place is good but has a huge scope of improvement in taste section.Undoubtedly the platting is excellent but improvement in taste is need of the hour.we had-

1-The Great garlic bread
2:Nothing but nachos
3:OTT sizzler
4:Paan panacotta

Among them the dessert "Paan pannacota" is a must try.

Service-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Food-3.5/5

You can give a visit to this place for trying their mouth-watering dessert and to have a feel of their excellent ambiance.üòÅüòÅ

This place is a must visit for all vegetarian. Very cool decor , funky seats and courteous staffs. Coming to food , a friend suggested chatak mary for drinks , something liked stuffed potatoes ( don't know the name) for starters, oh my pizza for mains and coffee panacotta for dessert. Chatak mary is brilliant,  a must try item. Pizza was nice , fresh and oven baked and dessert is also very tasty. Will visit again to fall in love with chatak mary again :)

Worthless place. Decor is the only thing one can call 'nice' but the food is quite pathetic and exorbitantly priced, compared to it's quality. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Shake had a painfully low amount of chocolate. The Mushroom Cheese Sandwich was dry and ordinary. Service was satisfactory, though water is not provided.

This cafe brings western food culture to the city of Kolkata(finally). By western food culture I mean the eccentric ambiance that you can find in hipster restaurants all across U.S.A, and the printed out menus to go along with the look, but most importantly the courage to experiment with the presentation and the flavor of the food that is made. Cafe 4/1 is seemingly always full for a good reason - it separates itself from all the typical food outlets in Kolkata with their same boring menus. The restaurant serves food that is not only delicious but also different. It serves a diverse range of food whilst adding its own distinct touch - apparent from the various platters it serves. The cafe does have its shortcomings like the lack of a good dessert menu, but I think those shortcomings can be overlooked in consideration of the fact that this cafe is definitely one of the most unique establishments in Kolkata.

Visited this place on a weekday for lunch after reading the reviews on zomato, however the overall experience was not very good for my sister and me. Do not intend to visit this place again. 

Food was ok and the service was unsatisfactory. 

We had ordered the below items and nothing tasted amazingly well. 

Drinks:

Virgin Mohito ‚Äì OK and Kokum Cooler ‚Äì Good (for people who like the tangy taste)

Food:

Feta Khao Beta ‚Äì Very ok types (the drizzle and less portion of feta cheese made the dish very sweet)

Arabiata Brain Freeze ‚Äì Ok 

Typically Lasagne ‚Äì Good (according to the waiter we had ordered this dish but actually we hadn‚Äôt. the waiter dint agree that we had not ordered this item and not getting much into the argument we took the dish.However, this seemed very unprofessional to us)

The ambience and interior decor was awesome. Nice place to sit chill and have good food. For the starters we ordered cheeuze me, the great garlic bread and swag mera desi. Presentation was resplendent. Cheeuze me was a stand out. The cheese they used inside the stuffing was very good went in a single gulp didnt stick. The other two were average. The great garlic bread not that good. For main course we ordered Kaboom Sizzler, Classic Napoletana, Pizza Ala Vodka and Typically Lasagne. Sizzler was delicious with good sides and 2 types of sauces. The Napoletana Pizza was much better than the Pizza Ala Vodka. The latter was recommended by their crew but it turned out to be not that good. Lasagne was average. For desert we ordered The Pan Panacotta. Man that was some great desert. With every spoon you feel like having Creamy pan. Some were good some were bad. You can go over here but choose your dishes wisely otherwise you may end up having a bad experience.

I loved the ambience of this place! That itself would take me back. As soon as you enter the stairway passage, it sets a smile on your face, clearly (see the pictures for more). The whole vintage vibe with the wooden decor and wrought iron furniture, good music too, will definitely take you to a happy place.
I had heard a lot about this cafe from friends and fellow reviewers about their innovative names and presentation of dishes. They are, certainly, innovative; but it all comes down to the taste. We had ordered a strawberry cheesecake shake, a kiwi smoothie and pestogasm penne pasta. The kiwi smoothie came first, served in a copperish cup, appealing to the eyes. It tasted good but was a little too sweet. Next, the strawberry cheesecake shake was served in a milk bottle along with two wafers tied to the neck. At first, I was in a predicament whether or not I'm supposed to eat that, I ate it anyway. The shake tasted good though I didn't understand if there was any cheesecake in it. Lastly, arrived the pestogasm penne pasta which was okay but I had expected more out of it. It wasn't among the best I've had, I found it a little dry. 
All in all, the place is worth visiting for their ambience and innovative ideas with food. My only concern, though, why no non-veg?

Wanted to try the food at 4/1 ever since it got opened. Heard good stuff about this place, and I can easily see why. The ambience is top notch. The food is just delicious, and overall a great place.
I had tried the OTT sizzler, cheese spinach starter, and green apple drink. And I must say, I have to recommend them all. 
The only issue is that the service is a bit slow, and the staff can get a little non attentive at times. Also the price is a bit on the higher side. The above mentioned dishes cost like 425/head for 2 people, but the portions served were in good quantity. This place is best to be visited in a larger group.

Visited this place with quite a lot of expectations. The food was okay, nothing to relish or drool over.

Here is breakdown:

Jomato: 
it was ok. Could not taste the tabasco. Jasmine infusion was given without instruction on how long to dip, so ended up with very little / no flavour. It could have been served hotter.

Mushroom Madneds:
The best of the soups we tried. 

4/1 Wanton delight:
A very bland broth and totally tasteless. I added a lot of salt and pepper to get a decent taste to finish what i ordered.

Nachos:
It was nice. 

Cheeuze Me:
Not good. The taste was below average.

Thai local:
The peanut sause with lemon grass flavour was very nice.

Classic nepolitana:
Pizza was nice and tasty. The best dish had at this place.

Overall i was wanting for more.
At 10:15 they said last order where as it mentions that they close at 11. Even at 10:25 when we wanted to order a desert after finishing the pizza, they refused. I believe they should mention the closing time earlier. It left a bitter taste.

I had a horrible experience with this place.I walked in after work,with a male friend.we were tired and wanted to sit and relax on the couch/sofa.the guys at the cafe asked us to take the chairs stating that "we do not allow couples to sit on the sofa". It was not just disappointing, but disrespectful and pissing off at the same time. We tried asking the guys once more if we could sit n relax on d sofa and when they turned our request down very rudely,we left.
I would like to tell the management that they need to train their staff and their policy as well. Two friends or colleagues can definitely visit and after a hard day's work if they request to be seated on the couch instead of the chairs,I don't see a problem.your presupposing attitude and conventional outlook makes me rate the place as 0.

One of worst cafe in terms of hospitality. We went on sunday evening to cafe 4/1. The manager Mr.Ashok Poddar was very confused and rude. He had no clue about whom to give the table and he twice asked us to leave the table. Even though my wife was pregnant he asked her to stand, even though he could see her condition. This is very pathetic behavior ever experienced. We left without having anything and to add to the mess the valet got my car damaged with the pillar while parking. The photo is uploaded for reference. Friends never ever visit cafe 4/1 totally unprofessional and worst in case of hospitality.

We chanced upon this quaint place (ambiance addressed) during a recent visit to Kolkata. To begin with, we were quite unsure of what to order. So we started off with sweet lime to buy ourselves some time. We were longing to have some rice and curry (macher jhol actually). As it turned out, this place was vegetarian and to much disappointment had a lone Indian meal in the menu.

But wait. The story has just begun.

The meal which consisted of 2 curries, dal makhani (the best I have ever had), some rice and chapatis, papad and phirni was so delectable that it made us pronounce in all glory that Indian cuisine is unrivaled globally. Oh yea, it not only satiated our taste buds but also tickled our emotions.

Only downside is variety in the menu and absence of meat.

It was a weekday evening with lots of traffic and torrential rain. Adding to my woes, my cab driver didn‚Äôt know the route, especially the one-ways routes. Well a 30minute drive took me around 1:15minutes, during which I lost my way and more than once enter wrong one-ways, had to walk with an umbrella in my hand in the heavy traffic and torrential rain, fell down in a puddle ‚Äì hurt my knee and broke my umbrella and finally reach the venue 30minutes late. I was plain angry, hassled and dejected when I entered the place.

Place wise it is nice,decor is good,but very much over priced.
 Can you imagine drinking a glass of horlicks may worth rupees 115+ vat!! Atleast I can't. Yeah you can say that the place talks. Actually that is the case.
Firstly as soon as we came into they said some starred menus are only available, this was height! We came at around 6pm, a peak time for a cafe and we are gerting cropped menus to choose from. Anyway.... You can get a far better cafe foodwise, decorwise and service wise at south calcutta,like the chaiwala, crossroad cafe etc. And meatlovers never ever come here.
We had had cold coffee and chocolate lava cake,both were acceptable,but we had to order those because there were bothing else to choose from thr cropped menu list.

Probably the best Western vegetarian restaurant you'll get in this part of the city. 
So we had ordered Lasagna and a Pizza with custom toppings. Very well prepared, both were. The lasagna was soft and crispy in the right places, and the pizza, although thinly crusted, was properly filled with toppings and cheese. 
Overall, quite a good experience. Not really value for money, which kinda is a negative factor, but otherwise, if you've suffered a brain accident and are in the mood for some veg, this is the place to be.

Good dining experience.  Pizzas were nyc . Jomato soup was good... nacho needs more dressing n dips . Tandoori platter rissoto n pastas were good as well. Keep it up bhavika. Best thing was they gifting plant seeds to pot plants.

LOCATION:

On Camac Street above the Exclusive Lines Showroom. Its the same location which was originally occupied by the Barista Cafe there.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Its a well done up cafe serving only vegetarian food. Its fairly well done up and has both outdoor and indoor seating Like the erstwhile Barista Cafe. The outside portion I imagine would be very popular during winters.

Interiors are decent with some good rustic elements like the flooring or the woodwork next to the large window at the far end. I liked the quirky couches with "4/1" imprinted upon them. I also like the colored chairs. They reminded me of The Social Cafe in Delhi.

WINE & DINE:

We called for Cheese Garlic Bread, Mushroom Tikki's and Mezze Platter along with cold coffee and beverages.

The Cheese Garlic Bread was a disaster. It was dry, unseasoned and honestly distasteful. They had used cheese only on top of the bread and had overcooked it which resulted in a dry cheese and not the gooey goodness that you expect. It did not have the garlic punch and instead had caramelized onions which gave a sweet after taste which I did not enjoy. For most bites, I was just biting into plain toasted buttered bread rather than a good and well prepared cheese garlic bread.

The Mushroom Tikkis were average. They had a filling inside which was tasty but then completely diluted the flavor of the mushroom itself. It resulted in a long search inside your mouth for that familiar wholesome flavor of mushrooms which never came. It was served with a mint and coriander dip which was decent.

The Mezze Platter was once again not up to the mark. It had Lavash strips which were just about the only good thing about the platter. The Falafels were quite bad. Small pita pockets with a small falafel inside and some lettuce. The platter consisted of couscous which was tasteless and in dire need of salt, hummus which was average, muhamrah which was ok and tzatziki dip which was bad. The curd used to make the dip had gone sour which made it inedible.

The Cold coffee with ice cream, well was cold coffee and ice cream. My friend had a mojito which he found to be decent.

WHAT I DID'NT LIKE:

Honestly, I do not normally score places this low because I feel new and stand alone eateries should be encouraged. However, my low rating is based on two major things which they got completely wrong -- food and service. I have already commented on the food but now comes the service. During the one hour I was there with my wife and friends, there was not one occasion where the stewards came by themselves and asked us what we wanted. It was lifting your hand and asking for one to come everytime you wanted something so much so that I could not manage another copy of the menu card until I had to request the table beside me to pass me theirs once they were done. It was quite evident that my friends wife was pregnant and the air conditioner next to us was not working. We requested that we be shifted to another table once it was available but the reply we got was that we would have to wait outside for 10 mins and would be given a table once available. I personally felt that the stewards lacked humility which is a complete no no in my books.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Food and Service.

VERDICT:

Honestly a poor experience. While I would not want to dissuade anyone from trying stand alone well done up cafes in the city, this one has a sign saying "AT YOUR OWN RISK".

I had heard a lot about this place and hence walked in expecting great taste.  Location - 5/5 although they have not bothered to trace their place correctly in Google place.  This cafe is bang on main road of Camac street.  Decor -  seems confusing.  Service -  was bad.  Delay in taking order and then staff was busy chatting instead of focusing on customers. All of the above could have been ignored if food tasted great.  Food -  tasted from average to bad.  We ordered a pesto based pizza which was bland to say the least.  Barley burger too was bland and was saved only by the cheese.  Pineapple ginger smoothie was good thought but flavors were not balanced.  Get beer was over powering.  So overall,  I felt very very disappointed with the place.

Food quality is good, but price comparison is very bad, just a pasta and a lemonade costs 900bucks? Oh please, I would prefer better place then this cafe...

Deliciously Chic is the phrase which describes the place well.¬†

The moment you enter the place you get a very rustic and vintage vibe. The interiors are very raw and nicely done. The menu looks very interesting and names of the dishes brings out your creativity as well.

we had ordered the following:

Kokum Cooler- Highly recommended
Coffee Toffee Martini- Recommended
Cappuccino- Average
Tofu Riot- Very soft and tender. The taste was very balanced and the sauce had seeped the tofu very well. Strongly recommended.
4/1 Wanton delight- The soup was very nice. The taste very subtle yet delectable.
Chocolate lava cake- This item was nothing short of ecstatic.¬†

Over all the food was great and the ambiance was upcycled chic.

Vegetarian place. Had cold coffee and garlic bread. Food was delicious. Service was nice and full marks to the ambience and presentation of the food. The place is going to be a success. Personally i would prefer if it served non veg food as well. But it is a great place to spend quality time with friends/better halves. :)

Very interesting cafe . Nice decor and good place to chill . But don't except much for food . Bad service . Very late . We ordered coffee toffee martini and green apple mojita . They took an hour almost to serve . Then the served wrong order . We ordered green apple mojito
 they served us gandoraj something . They changed it when we told them. They took the glass . And served us green apple but it still had gondoraj lemon floating and the taste of it . Quite evident that they just didn't replace it . Coffee martini was nothing but cold coffee with chocolate syrup .  No sign of toffee . The martini effect was only the glass.The waiters were just not interested  . The decor is the only plus . They need to be little professional

Today I visited the place for the first time with my daughter for lunch.The place looked a bit crowded when we reached there around 2 pm in the afternoon,tbh I felt happy to see so many people,because more people means the joint must be super popular.But soon I was disappointed when I took the first sip of my Italian Icecream Soda which looked oh-so-yummy from outside,I found the taste very average and it was too sweet.We took a starter,Thai Local,which is basically veggie spring rolls dipped in peanut sauce,the presentation was the best part as being served in tea glasses,it was nice and crunchy though lacked flavour. Next I ordered a Thai Thali consisting of Green Thai Vegetable Curry,steamed rice,pad Thai noodles,papaya salad and a coconut desert,yeah I decided to go for a Thai food ride expecting some real spicy food but instead was dissatisfied with the majority of dishes on the platter to be too sweet for Thai food.I am not sure if I would like to go back üòî Decor is cool but not comfy enough. @cafe 4/1

Vegetarians are gonna live this pretty place. Very creatively decorated. A lot of new mocktails with twists. Strawberry margarita, coffee toffee Martini for eg. One thing I hated, was the using of kidney beans in pizzas. However it is a vegetarian place, still they are not looking for kidney beams IN a pizza, trust me. Eco friendly ambience, outdoor and indoor seating available. One time visit , okay?

So I went here today with a lot of expectations. I ordered the chocolate peanut butter milkshake. I really liked the way it was presented , with a few peanuts in a rolled up newspaper depicting the common street food found here are e streets. My friend ordered a gem bubble gum milkshake and got a side too which had wafers. Another friend ordered the lime 235 which was not very good and ice tea. For the food we ordered heir garlic bread whose presentation was lovely. It stood on a skewer with a beautiful garnishing of spring onions , bell peppers and cheese. The bread was soft too. We ordered the napoletean pizza and it was okay. I found the crust to be too thin and the cheese less in quantity. We also ordered a pesto pasta which was really creamy so I really liked it. There was the distinct taste of pine nuts which you get in a pesto based dish. We even had this dish called swag Mera desi which was little cups of deep fried flour and pindi chana masala as the filling. That was what I found to be the best. In desserts we had the paan panna cotta which was okay and the molten chocolate lava cake which was served in a cup alongwith a chocolate tart in which was served the ice cream. The molten cake was very Rich and creamy. It's a good place. But I think it's a bit over priced. Ambience is very pretty and staff is friendly.

Delightful interiors, and gratifying food. Two theories that aptly describe Cafe 4/1, a lunch or dinner spent with friends here will be as entertaining as YOU make it, and the rest will literally be taken care of by the food. 
My friends and I tried out the Garlic Bread, Mr Alfredo(white sauce pasta), Kaboom(sizzler) and a couple of other items that I've forgotten the names of. 
All in all, a great experience.

"It is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view"
- George Eliot

And so far a foodie's mind is concerned, it needs to be open so as to explore and experience the varying taste across the world. And exactly the same kind of a mind is essential if you are a core non vegetarian person and reviewing a cafe like "Cafe 4/1".

Being an area surrounded by the hustles and bustles of traffic and crowd, Camac Street area of Kolkata houses this cafe which happens to be an abode of peace and charm, the moment you step inside. The interior decor resembles the quintessential ambience of a European countryside cafe, with peaceful yet charming vibes.
The service persons are courteous and prompt in their duty, but a smiling face can make it even better(just an honest suggestion).
Presentation is something that this place deserves a standing ovation for. Just mind blowing. Really appreciate the good sense of aesthetics.
Coming to food, the dishes are genuinely delicious, and even if you are a core non vegetarian, you will discover a complete new dimension to the concept of food this vegetarian place is gifting to the city of joy.
"Chatka Mary", "Kokum cooler", "Pizza Ala vodka", "Bong Bong", "Thai local" and "Paan Pannacota" are the 'must have' items if you visit this place. Specially, Paan Pannacota is a showstopper any day, and is sure to melt your heart, and make your taste buds dance in Rhythm Divine!!!
Scopes of improvement are there for items- Jomato, Mushroom Madness, Avocado Land, 4/1 AIB Roast salad, and jasmine tea. And 'alur dom' in 'Bong Bong' will reach an extra mile if it is prepared with a bit more jhaal(chilly taste).
Rest of the items are fine.
The management, is awesome and takes ultimate care so as to ascertain every guest returns back with a smiling face.
And overall, this place happens to be a very good vegan joint to have a sumptuous lunch/ dinner.
Thanks to Miss Bhavika, to come up with this concept. Wish her all the success for future.
Thanks a lot to

A beautiful place. Very tastefully decorated. A modern european look with mixed furnitures along with the 90's hippy cafe influences. One of the few vegetarian joints which has not let me down in my three recent visits. I tried a few things. i strongly recommend the Chatka Mary- arguably one of the best non alcoholic beverages in town. Let me not describe. The dahi kebabs are the best I've had till date. Most certainly their coffee pannacotta is to die for. I will keep coming back.

Worse place to go dine out or get food parcelled they don't have most of the items on the menu available for packaging and when i requested if they could charge me extra to add on mushrooms the waiter was like you can't because they're already made ! CanM't get a mezze platter parcelled ? Are you seriously kidding me ?? Theere are far better options to go dine out or get food delivered will make sure none of my family or friends ever come back !! Will take it on me to personally make sure this place loses a shit ton of business because they honestly don't deserve to be in business ! I'm a hospitalty graduate  and the first thing i learnt - the customer is always right ! Neways good luck for your future endeavours coz its not gonna last long anyways ! Really horrific treatment of customers !

I had been here with my friends lately. It's located right beside the newly opened Kalyan Jewellers. The quality of food is no doubt amazing. We had ordered Nothing but Nachos, which was nice. Pizza Napoletana & Arabiata Brain Freeze were our next orders. They were very  tempting and delicious. In the end we had Gandharaj and Basil Mojito. 
Pros - 1) It has used throwaway materials to decorate the cafe which attracts the eye. 
2) The big smile on the stairs is a place for a must-take selfie.
Cons - 1) Few seats were very uncomfortable.
2) There are not much choices in the menu to come back again.

Visited this place on my birthday with my friends...this place is over hyped according to me.. we had pizza, pasta, shakes which were just good.. it had an option of Indian thali in its menu..we ordered that and this was something which I liked.. it had 2-3 sabzi and kaali daal with roti, rice and desserts.. a must try for everyone who is looking forward to have Indian food.. the place offers a good ambience.. place is pocket friendly..and service is also good.. they just need to improve on the quality of the food.

I just got to hear a lot about this place and i read some reviews which seemed to be pretty good so i decided to go out to this place with my friends. Having eaten the white sauce pasta, oh my pizza, sizzler, garlic bread, bbq board and mojito's etc, i must say that this place did not keep up to my expectations. Garlic bread was not nice , you could better at any other cheap place. Pasta and pizza were satisfactory. Bbq board was third class! Sizzler was just ok. Only the litchi mojito was nice. Overall is is a new and overrated place and i believe that it can become better. Ambience is nice and the staff is also quite understanding. Come here if you have no other places left to visit!

Great ambience- funky decor and cleverly designed fun menu. I have been to cafe 4/1 for lunch a couple of times and had a great experience always. The food is extremely nice- the aib roast salad, the pesto rice and the sandwiches are great.¬†

Only issue is that they dont take reservations so having a pre planned event can be difficult.

I haven't yet visited this place, but, got to know from a close associate of mine that they invite Zomato users for a complimentary meal in exchange of reviews. I didn't like this idea.
The area and decorum is cool enough and hence you can pay a visit. The price are on a higher scale.

Before I continue I wanna ask few questions:
#Are you a die hard non veg foodie?
#Are you someone who thinks nothing can be better than Non veg food?
#Do you think no veg dishes can compete against your Chicken Biryani and Mutton Kassa?

If all of your above answers are "Yes", then you are just the type of person I used to be few days back before visiting this place.

If you think Veg Food cant give that excitement, you are wrong
If you think veg food is not as good as non veg, you should definitely visit this place to check your statement.

Cafe 4/1 is one such place you would love to go even if your are a die-hard non vegetarian. This place serves you some extraordinary dishes which will bring you back to this place over and over again.

LOCATION:
This place can be easily found in Camac Street. This hidden gem is just between the showrooms of Tanishq and Rolex. It is the place where there used to be Barista once upon a time.

AMBIENCE
The decor is absolutely brilliant and unique. The wooden tables, the chairs, the lights, the walls everything compliments each other to make the place beautiful. They have two sections and both are equally good. I loved the different lamp shades they have used in each places. The elements used in the showcases increased the overall beauty. The place is comfortable and a perfect place to enjoy your food.

HOSPITALITY & SERVICE
I was fortunate enough to get an invitation from this place and it was a great experience. Everything was inch perfect. Be it the food, the service or the hospitality.
Ms. Bhavika is an young entrepreneur. She is humble and a great person to talk with. She really gave a warm hospitality.
Mr. Abhishek Panja along with his team did an exceptional job in preparing some excellent dishes which will be always there in my memories.

This new cafe stands where the Barista Creme once did on Camac Street. The decor is lovely with quirky lights, seating and knick knacks spread around. The erstwhile open air portion is now glass enclosed and looks like a great place to relax in on a cool or rainy day.
Coming to the food, we had the Garlic Bread, Dimsum Trilogy and Pasta in Vodka sauce. The presentation of all three was excellent. The pasta was delicious while the other two dishes were adequate. I also had a Gandharaj n basil mojito which was very refreshing.

Here by the invitation of Shahbaaz Zaman. It was an food audit organised by Cafe owner with the help of Karishma Sharma. This Pure Vegetarian Cafe Situated near Camac Street Pantaloons besides Tanishq Showroom. This Cafe was Designed Superbly. It has two sections both were for dine in separated by a single door. When you entering into the Cafe it feels like it was a small cafe but actually from inside it was quite huge. One Section which was Inside the Cafe has a Hardcore look. Each table has it's different looks. Some has wooden chair, some has steal and some has comfortable sofa sitting. each table has it's different lighting. perfect dine in place for youngsters. Other section has almost the same looks. only one side of its wall covered by saucers which gives a rich look and other side was covered by a big glass for giving you the outer look. well decorated and beautifully designed cafe which was always crowded with foodies.
                                                                ...

Was invited for a foodie invite , decor is good as well as the ambience , the so called owner who was chatting with us Miss Bhavika lacked communication skills and wasn't warm and hospitable at all.

So we were bombarded with the following items:

# DRINKS

A. Mango and Strawberry - It tasted ordinary to be honest , presented well.

B. Jasmine Blossom - There was no sign of jasmine fragrance in it , after a couple of sips I couldn't have it anymore.

C. Lavender Dream - Hated it , waste of energy to just take a sip.

D. Chatka Mary - It was moderately good , but the drink almost choked me.

E. Kokum Cooler - Way too spicy.

F. Gems Bubble Gum Shake - Satisfactory .

G. Chocolate Peanut Butter Shake - It was delicious , tasted superb loved every bit of it.

# SOUPS

A. Jomato - Disgusting and ruined my appetite almost.

B. Avacado Land - This drink is a stuff of nightmares , horribly horrible to say the least.

C. Mushroom Madness - After a few sips , I passed it to my fellow foodie mates.

D. 4/1 Wanton Delight - After taking a sip , I went straight to the toilet.

# GHAAS - PHOOS

A. 4/1 AIB Roast Salad - Disappointment big time , was not good at all.

B. Beet It - Below Average , another item which can spoil your appetite.

# STARTERS 

A. Great Garlic Bread - It was sublime , made well indeed.

B. Tofu Riot - Another item which I really disliked.

C. Thai Local - Horror dish , avoid it at all costs.

# SIZZLER

A. Pouty Poblano - Sizzlers is something which i really like but this one served here was not good .

I missed on the other items as I had to pick up my mom from her work place.

Overall a below average experience.
I wish the management well.

I had read a lot of reviews about this place and had wanted to visit this place. Very near my office. Situated in the prime area of camac street,this is in between the new Kalyan Jewellers in one side and the Rolex showroom on the other.
This place housed the Barista previously.
A foodie meet was organized here and I am thankful I was invited. Most of us were hard core non vegetarians with few vegetarians accompanying us so you get the drift..
On climbing the stairs one might feel it is a small cafe but you will be surprised. Huge sprawling area with comfy seats all around. Their is a door separating another seating area as well which has a huge wall completely covered with saucers covering them. A big glass wall covering the sides give it a very modern look.
Brightly lit with a lot of different plants placed strategically to enhance the look of the cafe. The lights on top had different types of whisks as its covering. Very innovative. All the tables have their own set of napkins with quirky messages on them.
A huge menu had been decided but as usual thanks to my Father I couldn't taste all of them.
Let me state this before hand that their plating and serving the food is done in a mind blowing way. Kudos to the chef and the owner to have spent so much time on it.
The results reflect brilliantly as a house full of people were there on a Friday evening without the cafe serving any liquor. So it gives a clear indication that they are serving good food and that is what is giving them a full house.
Starting with the mocktails. A gems bubble gum shake and a chocolate peanut butter shake arrived on our table. Served in the classic American milk bottle. Topped with whipped cream. They tasted exactly like the name of the drink. Filled with yumminess. Then came the chatka Mary. A glass has this round ice ball which is made of strawberry crush and kokum juice. The glass looks brilliant with the pink ball in it. The drink is poured on top of it and the mixed taste is amazing. The drink is made of guava juice , Tabasco sauce chat masala and black peppercorns. Yum. It can give a good competition to any of the cocktails.the cold coffee was drizzled with chocolate sauce. It was a bit watery in my opinion.
Lastly there was the kokum cooler. Made with lemon and kokum syrup it is the perfect drink to beat the heat. They have a variety of tea as well for the tea lovers. We tried 3 of them. The first was mango and strawberry tea topped with honey. It gave a faint strawberry smell and looked really well. Loved how they use transparent cups to serve the tea. Followed by lavender tea and Jasmine tea. The Jasmine tea takes you to Mainland China's Jasmine tea. Perfect blend of tea with the right amount of smell and not over powering.
Along with the mocktails we had 3 starters. All 3 of them were plated and served beautifully.
First came the Thai local. It was a spring roll filled with carrots cabbage bamboo shoot and served with a peanut sauce. I had 2 of them. :-)
Then the tofu riot. And it was a wonderful riot inside my mouth. Crispy and Soft pan-fried tofu with onions and capsicum and a good chili sauce. Spicy and brilliant.
The last one was great garlic bread. Served in a big skewer the mozzarella cheese oozes out from the bread and the colourful peppers on it give a very nice look.
Soups were served after this.
First one is rightly named Jomato as it is a fusion of tomato and jasmine. It is accompanied with bread sticks and butter on the side.The second was the wanton soup. Veg wanton balls in a clear veg soup. The third one was a cold avocado soup. It was a very bitter tasting soup. The menu needs to write that in their menu so that people know what they are ordering. It has bitter gourd juice, cucumber and avocado mixed together. One spoon and we were done. Thank god the mushroom madness arrived right on time. It is a mix of button mushroom,porichini and shitake. The wild flavour gives the soup a distinct taste and it has a toasted garlic bread on top of it.

2 types of salad were served on big Mason jars and side sauce on the side. The first was aptly named beet it. Rocket, lettuce, thin slices of beet with orange slices in a mustard dressing and topped with feta cheese. The feta was a bit salty for my taste.
The AIB roast salad had this weird ghee smell and taste to it and was a complete let down.

The mains came after this and yes I tasted few of them as well.
Two sizzlers were served. One was the pouty poblano and the other being cottage cheese. Both the sizzlers have everything same difference being one has a grilled cottage cheese and the other a stuffed jalapeno with soya chunks. It has a mustard cheese sauce on top of it. Served with grilled onions and vegetables on the side with big chunky French fries,herbed rice and a bread piece.
A vegetable burger came with fries on the side. The patty was a mixed veg patty with coleslaw,slice of tomato and onions inside.

They have variety of thalis and I tasted the bong bong one. As the name suggests it was a Bengali thali which had 4 Luchis, begun bhaja,aludum,chholar dal,pulao,papad and mishti doi. The Luchis were a bit oily but the chholar dal along with it was delicious. Not made in the traditional Bengali way but it went really well with the luchi. The aludum was cooked in a tomato gravy and although the pulao didn't have the sweet taste to it but it went well with the aludom. The last main I tried was the MI:3 pizza. 3 types of mushroom cooked with pesto onions thyme and goat cheese. This was a rich pizza and I loved it.

Lastly thanks to shahbaaz I could have one of the desserts and I chose the best one. The paan pannacotta.
Served on a betel leave and topped with gulkand this beauty should be ordered by everyone. Hats off to the chef to come up with such an innovative dessert.
I will be dropping by soon to fulfil my sweet tooth cravings.
All the best to the management and team and wish them a houseful everyday.

Located on Camac Street, beside the Tanishq showroom. It‚Äôs a small spot, so do keep your eyes open or else you might miss it.
The interiors are have a rugged feel adding to the quaintness of the place. The furniture and lighting has been aesthetically set up to compliment the entire arrangement. Almost each table has its own antiquated design lamps. Caf√© 4/1 also has a balcony section for a more continental impression.

Their entire menu has a quirky element, both in terms of names and dishes. Not to forget the wide range of components.
--**--¬† Starting off with the drinks. Each of them had a separate flavour unlike those provided in other cafes having similar taste all around.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Gems Bubble Gum Shake : True to its name, it does give out the gems and bubble gum flavour which was a pleasant surprise. The density of the shake was maintained pretty well.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Chocolate Peanut Butter Shake : For all peanut butter lovers, this will be a great treat as it just spills out its core ingredient perfectly. Again distinct flavour of peanut butter was up to the mark.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Kokum Cooler : Kokum, also known as the ‚ÄòKool King‚Äô of fruits in India, yields a dark red colour juice which is really sugary. Controlling the saccharine taste of this juice is a challenge, which was taken up pretty well by the bar man.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Chatka Mary : Nice combination of guava juice and salt and red chilli powder along with a hint of lime juice.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Cold Coffee : It was well prepared and did not have excessive sugar.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Mango & Strawberry Tea is a delicious blend of mango and strawberry flavours combined to obtain a red succulent drink with a syrupy after taste. Adding honey only made it better.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Lavender Dream Tea received a much lesser liking as I am not much of tea lover. It‚Äôs a merger of green tea and lemongrass. The aroma however was mesmerising. 

--**--¬† There were also couple of soups.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Jomato : It‚Äôs the traditional tomato soup with the twist of jasmine flavour. As the jasmine flavour is externally added, it tends to be overpowered by the tomato.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†4/1 Wanton Delight : It is a Chinese broth containing saut√©ed vegetables. This was the best of the lot as it had authentic flavour.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Mushroom Madness : This could have been better, but the mushroom overwhelmed all other elements in the soup.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Avocado Land : This is a cold soup and major health friendly item. It has been concentrated for diabetic patients as it contains no sugar. For others, I would suggest you to avoid it as it might not favour your taste buds.

--**--¬† Further we had some salads aka. Ghaas Phoos.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Beet It has roasted beetroot as its core along with orange with orange & brandy dressing. Despite rich elements, it failed to impress.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†4/1 AIB Roast Salad was the pick of the two. Way greater elements such as Asparagus, Baby Corn, Olives, Artichoke and further more.

--**--¬† For the starters we had‚Ä¶
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†The Great Garlic Bread : Present in a unique fashion, it looked amazingly pleasant. However I felt the bread was a bit raw. Other than that everything was fine.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Tofu Riot : The best tofu I have had in a long time. Seamlessly coated with chilli sauce, the taste was just pitch perfect.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Thai Local : Another amazing prep on the menu. Superb carrot, cabbage and bamboo shoot rolls served dipped in nutty peanut sauce.

--**--¬† Moving on to the main courses.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬† Bong Bong : This was the typical Bengali thali, which included aloo dum, misti doi, chana dal, begun bhaja, curated to perfection. I especially liked the Chana Dal.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Risotto Your Majesty : The use Arborio rice makes it more chewy and creamy. Chunks of mushroom buttons melt in your mouth indicating the preciseness of cooking.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†MI 3 : This is a fully loaded mushroom pizza topped with 3 kinds of variety, poricini, shitake and button mushrooms. In addition there is pesto, onion and goat cheese. The thin crust base was just remarkable.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Pizza Ala Vodka : Tomato, white sauce, mozzarella, jalapeno and pineapples are used as toppings in this amazingly scrumptious pizza. Vodka is the stand out element of the dish as you can literally feel it in every juicy bite.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Vodka Pasta : The classic penne pasta with tomato cream sauce and added vodka. Yet again the classic taste is accompanied by the vodka twist making it a commendable prep.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†The Real Burger King : The burger was nothing out of the box. Just the standard style American burger with hash brown and other regular veggies.

--**--¬† Finally after a long list of entrees, it was desserts time. And they didn‚Äôt fail to impress.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Paan Panacotta : All of us much familiar with the Panacotta and Paan being consumed separately. Well Caf√© 4/1 has combined the two greats to form an incomparable singular dessert. The panacotta has the filling of betel nuts and supari. The presentation is unique and perfect.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Mango Kulfi : It‚Äôs not just a mango flavoured kulfi. These are real mango slices with mango kulfi at the centre. Aptly suitable for the summers.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Chocolate Lava Cake : The famous lava cake was as good as any other dessert served to us. Fluidity of the molten chocolate was nicely managed keeping the dough intact.

The caf√© is a new kid on the block being just 7 months since its inception. The head chef, Abhishek Panja, has done a fantastic job curating the menu and including in dishes from around the world with faultless taste. The service was unflustered. I feel the staff needs to be completely aware of the menu and provide description to the guests wherever necessary.
Not to forget my friends, with whom the evening was well spent, adding memories to moments.

My first visit to this place was a dull affair. Had gone for a cup of coffee, the place was buzzing with activity and we could not keep our eyes of the food and mock-tails others around us had ordered. 

So finally we planned a dinner there and boy it was worth the wait. There presentation is different and eye catching. Your eyes are satiated before your taste buds get a chance. We tried the thai local (springroll) which was served in a glass with a sauce. We had some spinach wantons which were nice. But what blew our minds was "swag mera desi", pindi chana in a tart (tart tasted like puchka) with abundance of heat, tanginess and ofcourse SWAG. 

We tried the indian thali and it was more than enough for 2 ppl. Panner, mix veg, daal makhani, pulao , 4 rotis , onions, phirni and papad. The penne vodka was again perfect. We thought we went overboard with the pizza but we would have missed something had we not had the pizza. Hand rolled thin crust which was literally melting in our mouth, a perfect marinara sauce and some lovely toppings. 
We pushed our self to the limit by ordering a choco lava cake. Once again we were bowled over by the presentation first and then the taste.
Apart from the food and presentation, the service deserves a special mention. All of the servers were pleasant and served with a smile. My 1.5 year old son was running around the entire floor but he was greeted with nothing but smiles, laughter, handshakes and high fives. The manager mr ashok pradhan also deserves a special mention. 
Our bill came with a small bottle containing sunflower seeds. The interiors and decors too are credit worthy. In summary its a casual chic place which you should visit with an empty stomach.

I am deducting a .5 because i felt they use MSG for the wanton dish. But otherwise the evening was perfect.

A refreshing cafe in town.. Nicely done place. Ambience is very nice.  Had ordered swag mera desi which was good and Thai local which was yummy, also liked the way it was served. They did not have the coffee which I wanted so opted for cappuccino which was alright. Service was a bit too slow. But will surely head back again to try more things.

What i ordered:

‚Ä¢ Gondhoraj and Basil Mojito - It was good. It could've been better as the basil flavour could have been enhanced in the drink. Nevertheless, one can still try this one as it is good enough. :) ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Vodka Pasta - It is mix sauce pasta with a little vodka touch to it. Tasted great. Must try for all who visits this place. I liked the presentation as well. ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Paan Pannacotta - It was ultimate. It was pannacotta with a paan twist. Tasted great and is highly recommended. Excellent presentation. #musttry #lipsmacking #drooling ¬†‚úå‚úå

Pros:

‚Ä¢ Good Ambiance.

‚Ä¢ Courteous Staffs.¬†

I have visited the place twice, but table was not available,  and they are very rude also, I have gone twice before as a walk in customer. 

both the times there was a waiting for more than an hour as it was a Sunday.  last Sunday they said to call and book a table before hand only , and have a booking for a table.

today when I called up again around evening time, they said you have to come and wait, table booking is not possible.

I don't understand, that is the place so good, so special, that they will behave in this manner, and do we really have to wait for more than an hour to get a table.

Placed at the heart of the city this lil cafe is a must visit ! The interiors has its own charm ! I had tried a Chinese platter which had from noodles to rice to a salad a starter and a side dish ... Phew it is actually filling . Good enough for two people to eat. To service well they were on their feet always when we called for them and even asked whether we would want anything else . Moving on to taste it was yum ! Pricing - ummm it is jus a bit pinching ! Overall this place is great to be whether you come alone or with a bunch of buddies ...

The food is okay, but the service is slack. The portions are tiny and quite overpriced. We had kokum cooler, packed mushrooms and spaghetti olio. The kokum juice was refreshing.
I went there for a vegetarian experience, but I think till date the new and funky restaurant all-veg restaurant at Park Street will be my favourite. At least the portions are worth for the money there. You know which one I'm talking about. ;)

Located at one of the most prime location of kolkata,Just above the Rolex showroom.. Cafe 4/1 isn't hard to locate at camac street .
Though I am not that of a vegetarian follower and even where there's no hukkah I generally don't consider that caf√©s much ( at least non veg or hukkah should be their to grab my attention ).
It took me lot of reviews reading before hitting this place.

While entering through the staircase i was quite amazed with the greenery stacked up used by tea boxs .Once entered the cafe felt like a tiny green house,the decor was brilliantly done.So well planned and seems like so environmental friendly. The plants hanging pots on the ceiling and the white undone walls were actually impressive.

Coming to the orders - As I already said that I'm not a vegan fan..so I opted for their mocktails only,so couldn't be able to comment about the food -
1.GANDHARAJ BASIL MOJITO 2.CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER SHAKE.
Both of the drinks tasted amazing and recommended.
And the presentation of the food is something very unique and should be appreciated.
On a the scale of budget it's bit on a higher side as compared to other cafes but it's worth spending for.

Surely Cafe 4/1 is a unique cafe concept and have potential to stand straight in the competition market. But I really hope they'll come up something with non veg options and shishas over there.

The ambience is nice and so is the food. But the place isn't pocket friendly. There is a dish called vodka ala pizza, it is must a try. In beverages, we had ordered for kokum cola..it was okayish. Very limited flavours they have. Service is a little slow. But for girls, the place is very photogenic ;)

Well its just located on the opposite foot of pantaloons camac street.. Above the rolex showroom. The decor is very refreshing. A cafe withiut hookah in kolkata is WELCOME. The drinks are all mocktails so have fun in a sober way..
Coming to the ambience..very lively which I have mentioned in my review too.

Food
Mushroom soup. Presentation was good but soup not that great really.. So mushroom lovers u may be disappointed.
Tandoori platter- well it's basically an indian thali has 4diff indian breads , very tasty.and smooth kaali dal, 1pc each of stuffed mushroom kabab, stuffed aloo, tandoori paneer etc. Green chutney was good. However the red one was a little stale. 
Its a sumptuous platter,

Very easy om the pocket. Enjoy. Great ambience.

The whole rating is purely based on the ambience and decor. It's probably the best in the area for chilling with your friends and enjoying the evenings. But food was very average. The menu had nothing new. The same old pastas and pizzas and garlic breads. There is so much to explore in veg food apart from the conventional food items. The taste was also nothing great. If only they had put efforts in designing the menu as they did for the interiors and decor. Overall it was not a bad experience

This place is extremely beautiful and is aesthetically very pleasing. But, the whole rating is for the decor. We ordered strawberry cheesecake milkshake (it being apparently their signature shake or whatever) but it tasted just terrible!! And it wasn't even cheap. Like it was around 200. We were going to order the choco lava but this disappointed us hugely and hence we asked for the bill and left. This place apparently has good food but I haven't tried them, maybe I'll visit again.

I was quite enthralled with all the greenery and stacked up used tea leaf boxes while going up the staircase to the cafe. Once inside, the decor appeared to be no less appealing from tiny potted plants on the shelves and walls to the quirky ceiling. The seating arrangement despite being very functional and environment friendly was very tasteful. The tea box seats made quite an impression on me. 

The staff were polite and attended to us immediately despite the cafe being almost fully occupied. The food however, took too long to arrive on our table and so did the bill for that matter. We went for the Mushroom Packed, Great Garlic Bread, a peppermint tea and chamomile tea.

I did not find the mushrooms to be that great and the portion was rather small. The garlic bread on the contrary was not only huge but delicious. It was fresh and soft and the garlic wasn't at all overpowering. I loved the presentation of the garlic bread. It was served perpendicularly, which was a first for me. Both the teas were refreshing and rejuvenating. We thought the prices were a little on the higher side. 

Overall it wasn't such a bad experience, the only cons being the slow service and high-ish prices.

Called at around 7.15 pm to ask if there was space for 10 people. They refused to take reservation but assured us that we will get a table if we come after 8.15 pm
We reached accordingly, forget about giving preference, the manager was not even interested in talking to us despite his claim on the phone an hour ago. Sadly, whole family's maiden visit to the place was not at all welcoming.

This was my first visit, when i stepped in the restaurant it appeared quiet promising, but then it was not at all promising.
Decor was innovative and nice atleast far better than the food; i mentioned food so i should also mention food menu which was filled with name bt there is a surprise one don't get to have what ever they want from the list cz half of them are unavailable. That is all i have to say.

Replacing the erstwhile barista creme on camac street, cafe 4/1 serves lovely food but lacks the comfort of a cafe for me.

The place has been totally redone and decor is a bit overdone in my opinion. The seats seemed uncomfortable to me which matters for a cafe. Staff are warm and guide you well through the menu.

There are a lot of options to choose from the menu. I had heard very positive things about the food here and my experience matched that. Tried the nimbu paani that was well made, spaghetti alio olio which tasted great and a tandoori platter. The platter was superb with lovely kebabs especially dahi and stuffed aloo. Kali dal tasted nice and had a nice flavour alongside great variety of rotis.

Overall a lovely place to dine at very decent prices but for a cafe, seating space disappoints.

3 stars to 4/1. Garlic bread's presentation had the oomph factor. But taste was normal. The guava drink was to die for. Chatpata and tongue twisting. It was a delight to sip it everytime. Nachos were good, served with cheese sauce, salsa and Greek curd ( maybe cream cheese) was hard to differentiate. The three came to us at around 750 bucks so definitely pricey but worth the food. Service was pathetic. Waiters were laughing all around, many food items were unavailable. After asking thrice we got our water served. Had to wait for 10 mins to get oregano and Chilli flakes for garlic bread. Food service was slow. Hence they need to buck up on the service part as its the main organ in this industry!

Cheers!!

Another vegan spot and its sans hookah smoke, basically doesn't let you suffocate as you indulge in your choice of delicacies. Personal preference is the Tandoori Platter. Kudos to Team 4/1 ! :)

I was longing to go to this place for quite some time. So i finally I go there with two of my friends...the ambience was alluring. The outside open area seemed better for a winter evening and the indoor area was just right for the kolkata summers. Music is decent too. The staff were specially welcoming with a friendly warm smile. Coming to the food and beverage section... We ordered a plate of couch potato, an ice tea, a green apple mojito and a cold coffee(my weakness). The ice tea and the mojito were quite different from any of the ice teas and green apple mojito I've had in a good way. (not kidding).Coming to the coffee that I ordered for myself ..firstly it came in a Vikings glass that made me feel I am being treated specially. Then the first sip..... Wait... Its too amazing to talk untill the last drop of the first sip reaches to your stomach to make u realise that the decision of ordering a classic cold coffee rather than going for a fancy named drink was perfect. It was one of the best  classic cold coffees I've had in a decade. The dish called couch potato was literally served with the stuffed potatoes placed on a wooden couch which looked quite cool and tasted good too. I walked out with a smile and a plan to come back as soon I get time from work. 
P. S. The bill came along with a bottle of sunflower seeds for their customers to take home.(you know,global warming and GO eco friendly n all...), But That gesture was worth appreciating.

A wonderful place to visit. Nice interiors and setting and ambiance. I ordered gandharaja & basil mojito and a tandoori platter. 
Mojito was wonderfully blended and had a wonderful lasting taste. 
Tandoori platter was just superb. Never had such a beautiful dahi kabab. The entire platter was very well settled and had a wonderful taste.

Ambience was lively. We ordered chatka mary and green apple majhito, tandoory tray, nachos, and lasagne
Both mocktails were good in taste and presentation
Tandoori tray and nachos were good
Regarding lasagne taste was ok and portion was too small..
Overall a very good tym out with family at cafe 4/1.. 2nd tym visit is must for other items to taste.. Value for money

Revisited on 30th sep with my 10 family members to celebrate my nephews birthday.. and found food quality as same..in other words super quality..enjoyed a lot

We were 3 adults and a baby

Visited this place and were really amazed by the overall satisfaction this restaurant provides to its guests.

The menu is elaborate and Classy

We ordered dimsums, sandwiches , rolls and risotto in food and some cold smoothies in beverages.

Apart from the roll, everything was very tasty and well presented.

The presentation of food is classy and taste is amazing

Risotto was exceptional.
Dimsums were good . but portion size can be increased to 8 pieces.
Sandwich was filling
Roll wasnt upto the mark.

I was recommended the roll by the server but it tasted and smelled stale as if it had been prepared and kept in buffer.

Beverages were upto the mark

Quality 4/5 ( I cut one for the roll )
Service 4.5/5
Cleanliness 5/5
Hospitality 5/5

Overall 4.5/5

We were given a sponge smiley ball for the baby, which was a great hospitality gesture of welcoming the guests.
We really appreciate the gesture and look forward to visit it again

The main difference was this outlet provided us some seeds of sunflower with the bill with a message ' let's grow together '

This step by the restaurant team is really amazing and concerned towards the society .
They showed that they are actively participating in their corporate social responsibility towards the earth..

Appreciated

Located near the shopping destination of kolkata, this cafe is s pure bliss for the shoppers, veggie lovers and people looking for deceny food at eec ny prices. By far, this is only place which is generous with feta cheese in the salad. It was undoubtedly one of the best salads I ever had. The seasoning was perfect and so was the crunchiness. The pizza was not the best but definitely good. The other dishes were well presented too. It's got a really cool and buzzing environment and when i say buzzing, I definitely don't  mean noisy. To sum it up, it's a must go and salads shouldn't be missed. Can't wait to visit again.

Went to this place on my birthday eve ..loved the food - ordered a variety of starters like nachos, Thai roll, dimsums, a chana starter called swag mera desi (cannot forget this name) and mezze platter. They were all good. The sauces and dips served with each starter was also tasty. The main course dishes - two types of pizzas and pastas that we ordered were also well made. The drinks were good too. For the price everything was absolutely worth it. Would just want them to improve on the cleanliness of the place. Apart from that everything from service to food and drinks were awesome! Keep doing the good job! Hope to hangout here more often.

On hearing great reviews I visited this place for a quick lunch. And it was nothing but sheer dissappointment. 
We took our seats as guided and we're asked to change our seats to accommodate a bigger group, this is unacceptable when you are eating.
Called for a kiwi smoothie... The quantity was very sad.
A pesto sauce spaghetti... Oily and bland...   
We did not want to take the risk of trying more stuff.
 I quiet like the ambience though, very well done.

I have been to this place twice. First visit was a bit disappointing. Didn't like the cheeuse me aloos . It was a bit bland.The second time we visited, we ordered the hanging garlic bread which was okay, nothing special. Then we ordered the Vodka pasta which was delicious. We also ordered the mushroom packed which was nice and the mayo dip which came along with it was fab. The Made in China platter was quite average. Didn't like its darsan. The platter lacked zing. I had ordered the Coffee Toffee martini which was fab and came along with a cute emoji dark chocolate. The peanut butter shake was also nice. The Chocolate Lava Cake was just mouth watering and delicious. The hot gooey chocolate lava cake served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a chocolate base was the highlight of the evening. Special mention to their presentation. They really do serve beauty on a plate! Their service was a bit lacking. Though the waiters were polite but they were really confused with the orders. We had to remind them about the garlic bread thrice and also about our dessert.
Overall it's a good place to chill with your family and friends.

It was a lazy sunday morning when I decided to pay this little one a visit.The ambience is done absolutely brilliantly.It s like it would transport you to a goan beach where u will sit back and relax with a novel in your hand or consider yourself in holland with wood and cheese all around you.Coming to the food-The chocolate peanut butter shake was done beautifully.Its their signature milkshake and I am sure it wont let u down.Coming to the sizzler paolo pablano:its a mexican sizzler.portion is sufficient for one person.veggies were nice and juicy,herb rice was seasoned to perfection though i thought the sauce should have been more exciting and given in a bit more amount. This place has got a tea bar,which again is absolutely brilliant..i would recommend this place to everybody whether alone or with friends..Just loved it.

Though i am not much a fan of vegetarian food , still intended to pay a visit here atleast once and the experience was pretty satisfying. The interiors are done brilliantly ( quite similar to the bikers cafe set up) , the stewards were very efficient , food presentation deserves applause and our orders met upto our expectations.

We had MUSHROOM SOUP by two , MUSHROOM PACKED ( fried mushroom and cheese balls) and GREAT GARLIC BREAD ( sliced bun of garlic bread topped with cheese , a bit overrated) . For desserts, i wanted cheesecake but the steward suggested to try out the holi special PAAN PANACOTTA and that was just it should have been!

Lastly we adored the concept of presenting the bill with a small potted basil plant along with container of sunflower seeds for the guests with the labelling "lets grow together".

The negetive mark goes for the person behind the billing desk , who stopped me from clicking an unoccupied section of the cafe without hamperinig anyones privacy ( the 10th pic attached here, for obvious reasons of uploading in zomato) ; saying one cannot take pictures here except selfies. Sir, do mention that in written and hang up boards reading 'photography is prohibited' instead of humiliating reviewers.

From a very long time we buddies had decided to visit this place but couldn't make time for it. So today on Holi with a festive mood we hopped over this place. From outside itself this cafe looks super cute. The staircase has a smiley painted over it which makes it even cuter. When I entered this place I was amazed to see the simplicity. The way they have put up the interiors, totally environment friendly but yet super amazing. The ambience is great so are the staffs. The staffs are gentle and understanding which makes this place even more amazing. Well to start with food :
‚Ä¢ Crispy Cheesy Nachos - Supper Yummy. The nachos were topped with melted cheese, sour cream, salsa sauce and some beans. It was absolutely delicious.
‚Ä¢ Blueberry and Lime Smoothie - Amazing! It had the perfect flavors in it and was refreshing as well.
‚Ä¢ Orange Kiwi mango Smoothie - This was much on a healthier side. It tasted good as well. It had a flavor of yogurt in it and a rejuvenating smell.
‚Ä¢ Chocolate Lava Cake - Well this was just amazing. Toothsome !! The plating was great, it had a choco lava cake in a mug and Vanilla ice cream along with it in a chocolate cup. This whole thing was just delicious.

The plating of the food is really amazing at this place. So is the service, quite fast. It's a perfect place for some healthy vegan eating. Along with the Cheque they give you some seeds of sunflower so that we can plant them anywhere near our house. This cafe is really doing a great work along with serving such amazing food they are even supporting tree plantation for a greener Kolkata. A must visit!! This place tops my chart for one of the best cafes I have been to. üòÑ

I have been here many times but this time could be my last visit.
Staff wasn't flexible enough to remove mushrooms from platter 
I had requested for a small slice of any dessert  as it was my friends birthday but they blatantly refused saying we don't do desserts. If out of courtesy and as a goodwill you can't offer on request the I am ready to even pay for the slice but only if you could be polite and decent enough 

Please know how to welcome and look after your customers. I have come to this place 100s of times. This wasn't my first visit but definitely my last.

I rarely go to a pure veg restaurant! But I'm so impressed with this hidden gem that I will here often! 

The interiors of this place are classic high roof, coloured glass, lamp shades made out of mason jars! 

The menu is crisp and clear, and I can't choose what I could say was my favourite! 

I tried the toffee coffee martini ( yes there is no alcohol served here) the drink was rich in coffee and the presentation was bang on pic attached. For starters I had a Thai swist on spring roll which was served in cutting glass with peanut sauce , innovative i must say. Also tried the packed mushrooms, though my request was to eat a dish which was on the spicer side but I was informed it wasn't available, so settled for the packed mushrooms ( if u aren't calorie counting then order) as this dish is mushrooms stuffed with cheese and then fried but tastes decent. 

There Indian thali could be the highlight for the night , it's enough for two to share it comes with a assortment of Indian breads like Malabar paratha, masala kulcha, tandoori tori, forgetting the last one. 1 portion each of dal makhani, Kadhai paneer and mixed veg . The thali also has a bowl of rice papad onions and a portion of phirni! Thali is. MUST TRY! 

Despite the restaurant being packed the service was spotless , well trained staff and prompt service . 

And the have a fabulous initiative where along with the bill they gave a small jar with sunflower seeds and asked to grow! Such a wow factor.

Somehow, I am not totally surprised looking at the number of cafes that have sprung up in the city. Each novel in its own ways, trying to serve up the perfect innovation on a platter. Well Cafe 4/1, is probably very near to the epicentre of that perception map. Their edgy and crisp interiors and a well rounded menu is sure to lift the moods up.
For a very quick lunch we ordered the Vodka Pasta (quite unusually named) and their big burger. I keep saying this time and again that burgers and not for vegetarians, the lesser mortals ( unsurprisingly I am one too) but theirs was one of the better ones I have had, served with salad and potato wedges you could make a solid meal out of it. The pasta on the other hand was very flavorful but just a tad under cooked ( I may be overtly critical here). But great ambiance and food at borderline expensive prices.

This place was in my hit list for long time ,at last had a chance to visit here thaugh it's very near to my office which is jus 10 steps away. First I would like to tell about the ambience specially the entrance which would welcome you with a big smiley on it...and the black and yellow colour makes it real unique. The ambience inside is real catchy as it is decorated with plants and saplings all over. First we orders Thai local..It was served in a very interesting way in small tea glasses with the crate to carry them. Then we ordered# typically lasagne and #vodka pasta. I must say both are perfect in taste . Totally veg pasta and lasagne won't let u down. And here comes the best part that is the #peanut butter shake and #kitkat shake .They are served with peanuts tied aside the bottle. And the kitkat shake was also different .A must visit for quality timepass

My experience with this cafe was very disappointing. As there is two part in this cafe and I went during the World Cup match, I requested them to give me table near the projector. As the place was empty and there was no table reserved. First they denied me because they had to switch on the ac of that place and told me that place was received. Till I had my dinner I saw no one on that table.
The manager of that place is was also very rude and the staff was also very uncooperative.
The food quantity is below average but the food is average. I guess there are better cafe that this as this is slightly over priced and the service is also not that great so I would suggest you to go to some other place.

Sad food, lac luster, nothing about this place was good, it's apparently recently opened & might shut soon. No one was there in this cafe besides for me & my friend. We initially ordered a creppe, which we were told wasnt there, we asked for a lasagne, that wasn't available either, I ordered a panini sandwich & my friend a av bhaji,¬† and a regular tea along w that. Apart from the fact that the food was absolutely horrible, the entire bill of just these three items worked out to almost 800 rupees with tax. The white bread was stale and hard, the bhaji along with the pav was bland. This is literally the worst place one can imagine in the city. Service was super slow.

Went there with friends with lots and lots of expectations as it looked so very cozy and beautiful from the outside the other day while passing by Camac st. and it didn't disappoint at all! The ambiance was charming and the attendants were well behaved. The menu card looked interesting as well with cheesy names. 
The only tad bit disappointment about the cafe was that it was vegetarian and we being hard core non-veg lovers were a bit apprehensive about trying. But it turned our minds around with the quality of food, taste and the presentation! Glad we stayed back and ordered! I specially got excited about the drinks served in the mason jars. The decor was minimalistic but classy and interesting. A bit overpriced but suitable as per the location. Good for a relaxed hangout with friends, with good VEGETARIAN  food and soft drinks.

Cafe 4/1 replaced the old Barista on cammac street. After hearing good reviews about the food and the presentation we decided to visit this place on a Tuesday for dinner and the place was decently crowded. 

Moving on the food the menus looked very interesting and the names of the dishes were quite interesting. We ordered for the mushroom soup, nachos, vodka pasta, tandoori platter, strawberry milk shake and the chocolate lava cake. All of it was very good. The kali dal in the tandoori platter was amazing and we order an extra portion to take away after. Presentation of the dishes are very quirky and modern. 

Service was prompt and the ambience was new and young and smart. Very different from the usual kolkata setup. 

Over all I would defiantly go back as the sizzler on the other table looked really inviting and I also would like to have the pizza on my next visit. So would visit again. :)

Update : was planning  to host a lunch for 14 ppl tomorrow  and went to the outlet to book and talk of the menu. Mind you it was empty.  Was told that reservation  was not possible  and will not be given the confirmation.  And they said they don't operate the outside section unless there are crowds .  On asking for the manager,  he came out and said the same thing.  Guess we will look for other locations in the city.  A little coordination or some options to be given would have helped.  No issues changing my rating  from 5 to 2,... Cheers... 


The other day I was starving and in search of a vegetarian outlet to have a meal around camac street. I have been hearing some really good things about this outlet. The only deterrent was that I'm a hard core non-vegetarian. Well I set foot in it and decided to order an AIB Roast Salad. We also ordered a Tandoori Tray, my friend got a gems and bubblegum shake and I took a nimbu pani.

The salad came in a jar, and the roast dressing in a Muffin cup. I fell in love with the smokiness of the dressing. The salad was crunchy and delicious.

The Tandoori Tray had many components, the mushroom galaoti was my favorite, I also loved the dahi ke kebabs, the daal was velvety and nice, and the breads , all four, were light and delicious. The paneer and the stuffed aloo were nice too.

My friend loved the shake and my nimbu pani was decent.

The service staff was very energetic and we'll behaved. Food delivery was quick and the place is decently priced, all this for 1083 after tax Is lovely.

Coming to the ambiance, I love the use of old articles on the decor, it has a very desaturated old world charm, the right balance modern and vintage. Kudos to the interior designer!

Overall a stunning place, I'm coming again soon for sure!,
Cheers

Had heard about the Caf√© from my wife who had visited with her cousins. Went there a couple of days back. The interiors were quite impressive. The Staff was very attentive and foremost did not have to wait for a place. The place was quite full. Like the way the Menu was presented and the names of the dishes was also very thoughtfully chosen. The presentation of the food was super creative and amazing. Like the concept of Thali, though we did not order. The menu was nicely balanced so you can try out different items on multiple visits.

We ordered

1.	Hello Aloos

2.	The Great Garlic Bread. (Thoughtful way of Serving)

3.	Risotto your Majesty

4.	Spaghetti Aglio E Olio

5.	Chocolate Lava Cake

6.	Fresh Lime was very refreshing with the use of Gandhraj

7.	Margarita Strawberry Slush was devine

The overall experience was great. I would say a SUNDAY AFTERNOON WELL SPENT

Will try the Breakfast next time.

Till then ‚Ä¶ BON APPETITE ‚Ä¶.

Very well located. Amazing interiors. Special mention to the " :) staircase ".
Something really different from what you get in Kolkata. A breath of fresh air, the place!
Very cordial staff. Warm in their welcome.
Super creative name of dishes in the menu. Super creative use of Tissue Paper.

I ordered a Tandoori Tray and a ChocoLavaCake. 
The Tandoori Tray was umm..Delicious would be an understatement. Dal is a special mention. It was something more than tasty!
What classy presentation of the food!
A must try. Sufficient for 2 people.
Then we ordered a Choco Lava Cake. They gave ice cream along with it that added to the effectiveness of the dessert.
Well served in a big cup like utensil. Ice cream in a chocolate tray.
It was foodgasmic!

The overall experience was heavenly! Bliss, so to say!

Will recommend this place to everyone and will visit it again very soon!‚ò∫Ô∏è

While the look and feel of the place is great, service was a disappointment second time in a row. Weekend crowds seems completely unmanageable by the cafe team. You are kept waiting for really long for things like water and also bill at the end. The waiters serve you wrong dishes. To add to the misery, food too was pretty average yesterday which is otherwise nice.

Food is good. I have visited this place twice. The tandoori platter was good. Specially the dahi ke kebab and dal makhni. Pizza is also good. The minus point is the seating. The chairs and sofas are not so comfortable. Strawberry cheesecake shake is a must try in mocktails

My frnd & myself visited the place today aftrnoon for a catch up and good lunch. The place is nicely converted from the earlier barista. Food was nice and service was also good. However, parking arrangement of the cafe sucks. We had parked our car below and the security was clueless of the placing of car. Our Honda city was scratched by some other car while it was passing by. There was no vigilance from the security to ensure the car safety. Also at the end when asked as to how our car got scratched, the security dint even own up the mistake and denied to see the same.

Camac st is a place whr parking is very important parameter to run a cafe successfully. Hope you empower and train and allot competent people as security personnel to ensure customer satisfaction and car safety.

I went there on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with family. The place was packed. Still we managed to get a table. We ordered a pizza napoletana, nachos, a Greek salad, bubblegum shake. The pizza was a crispy thin crust one and it was full of toppings and absolutely delicious. Cheese nachos were amazing for starters. Greek salad was different and tasty but a healthy option. Bubblegum shake sounded tempting but in the end it was full of froth and was okay.

Well heard a lot about this place and finally I got the chance to visit it.
Easily located, not at all hard to find. Ambience is great and good sitting space also. Positive.
Firstly ordered green tea (tulsi mint), it was amazing one. One of a kind. Then I ordered make your sandwich and it amazed me, just wow. Then ordered all Greek salad, and it was amazing. It's a good cafe for all the health freaks out there, you can stay healthy also and have a great time also. I strongly recommend visit this place.

Being a foodie we loved the place for its wonderful dishes, great taste and presentation. There's not a single dish that you can not go gaga about.
For food lovers you need to try this place. On the aspect of serving we didn't appreciate the cold gestures. We were at a time when there were 4 tables occupied including us on one table. But there was no one to take orders for a long time. Inattentive. No water served to our table which is basics but customers after us were served water.

Loved the decor, but was wee let down by the food. We ordered the chocolate peanut butter shake, that was good. Then a plate of nachos, which was okay. And after, vodka pasta. This was disappointing. Vodka taste was too overwhelming. We told them, they served us another plate, which had a better taste. Was expecting a lot more actually from this place. üòï

Nice place to hangout with friends. Vide variety of Tea, snacks, etc. It's one of those places that cast a spell on you, right in the first visit. At a time, when so many coffee and tea cafes are mushrooming throughout the country, it becomes really difficult to stand out. 4/1, however manages to do it effortlessly, the interiors and the ambience are superb, and it was totally worth it, I will give 5/5 ratings

Very interesting concept. First look at the menu and I was like how have I not been here for so long. The appeal of the place is very contemporary and says "you can check in anytime  you want but you can never leave". As of the food I would reserve my comments until I try everything on the menu over time. This place is open all day and that's the good part

On the face of it, this place talks to you a lot.

1. Tandoor platter - outstanding; best in class helpings; small but sufficient for two if you want a light Indian meal. 
2. Mojito : they call it ganddhari I think, out of the world. Freshens up.
3. Ratings dropped to 3 as Thai Thali turned out to be ridiculously pathetic. Tasted this in my second visit here. Highly disappointing. 

I am being compelled to think otherwise now.

Nice Ambiance and huge sitting area.. .. Another luvly place to hang out....
Food was really delicious and specially its a pure veg place so we Vegetarians enjoyed more....
They have lots of options in starters and we tried few and all were tasty and the presentation and serving style was a bit unique as seen in the attached pics..
Pizza was crispy,thin and cheesy and even in dessert hot chocolate lava cake was yum...
But after all the good notes there cums the most worst part of it... Staff members who looked decent but there approach was really bad.. I was with my guests and there were many empty tables and nowhere it was mentioned about any reservation as it was Saturday so i decided to sit at a table but i was told not to sit as we were only 4 and the table capacity was of 6.. But jst b4 dat there was a group of 4 lft from the very same table... And was also told ki even if i sit there if they have any large group visits then I have to get up.. What nonsense..?? I do had few words with the staff and as was with my guests so have to sit there for dinner else would have left immediately... This is the way to treat the customers that you might have to get up in the mid way of taking dinner.......
I will be waiting for the managements rply on this...

The service was good with commendable presentation of the dishes. Interiors are very green and trust me it will not make someone feel like stepping into just a cafe.. Its something more than that. One will not miss the tables, lights, little book shelf, the french window with small plants and the subtle floor. A must visit for anyone seeking a quiet little rendezvous for the tummy.. üòä

Had ordered, Roasted Vegetables in Panini, Corn & Bean Salad, Lava Cake & Cappuccino.
The Sandwich felt a dry as no butter was used for grilling but the vegetables tasted nice, the potato wedges served with it was quite good, crispy & soft inside. Corn & Bean Salad was very refreshing & loved the way they presented it in a mason jar. Lava cake was nice & gooey, served in a mug (made it easier to clean up the gooey chocolate) along with a scoop of icecream in a chocolate cup. It hit the right spot Bang On.
Only negative the Cappuccino. They serve Nespresso but served me a decaf instead offering me a choice. Left without my caffeine rush leaving the coffee untouched.
Overall a nice place but remember to ask them to let you choose the Nespresso capsule. Will go back.

When my friend suggested this place I was a bit sceptical as most of you guys know that place has changed several eating joints. But I was quite excited as soon as I entered the place. The decor is simple and yet refreshing. I really liked those steel round foldable chairs attached to the table. The presentation of food is just 5 stars. Must try jomato soup, garlic bread, and ceaser salad.

Evening at this place was an unforgettable, not to be missed. I would start with the interior of this place, which was just amazing and soft music along with vintage look makes this place a perfect one. Now talking about the food, we started with the 'Thai local' which was delicious and presentable too. Next we had 'Hello aloos' (small baby potato with herbed cheese) and also the Classic Napoletana, which was perfectly thin crust. I would love to visit this place again and again.

Located in the Camac Street Area, this place is a box of surprises! A nice ambiance exuding a lot of warmth.
There is a subtle music which might get suppressed in the humdrum of the noises around.
Had been here for the second time & the service was decent enough although there is room for improvement!
The Gems Bubblegum Shake was a stellar. It had the right blend of flavours & appropriate consistency :)
The Hello Aloos could have been a better which had a really flat taste, try it with some sauces which might enhance the flavour.
Coming to the desserts if you are looking for a creamy, gooey and intense chocolate treat that will make you warm and fuzzy all over, then a MUST try - extremely decadent¬†Chocolate Lava cake¬†that boast of the richness of dark chocolate!

After checking out the menu on Zomato, I was a wee bit apprehensive of going to Cafe 4/1, as this place is an absolute delight for tea lovers.¬†

What would a hard-core coffee person like me order in a place that has allotted 4 pages of their menu for various concoctions of tea and barely two inches of space for my beloved beverage! (Yes. I can be quite dramatic. :P)¬†

Nevertheless, I brushed my concerns aside and went for a quick bite with a friend.
And boy oh boy, I was blown away - by the quirky decor, superb ambiance and the Nespresso Mocha which was BEYOND AMAZING! :D

Yes guys, they have just one item for coffee in their menu and it's SOO PERFECT, that one whiff will take you to heaven. #qualityoverquantityalways¬†

I also recommend the MI 3 pizza - excellent thin crust with an overload of mushroom and cheese. Duh, whom am I kidding! You can never have enough mushroom and cheese right! ;)

My friend had 2 cups of Blue Peak Green Tea, so I guess it must have been good.¬†

Overall, Cafe 4/1 is a fabulous wonderful place.¬†
The two reasons I didn't give a 5 star are - the slow service and the servers who need more training on being courteous and polite.¬†

Long story short - this place is a MUST VISIT. :D

Me and my friends love to go to new places, and we came across this place..took us some time to figure out the exact location because of the small place. But I would give 3.5/5 to this place for food as it was good. Ambiance was the best and waiters were also friendly and helpful. Warm and peaceful. Loved the cute sunflower seeds I got in the end. It's really a good place to hang out with your friends. Would surely love to visit again.

Lets start with the interiors. They are absolutely adorable with the whole "keep smiling" theme that they've adopted. The names they have chosen for their food are quite creative I must say. The food itself though is kinda okay, more on the bad side. Their Vodka Pasta is kind of the only dish I liked. So that's why the poor rating. But I think this place could do a good job in the long run and is fine for a try ;) And they also have really good quotes written on the napkins( see the picture) which I liked.

We visited this place without any plans after rigorous shopping stint and was pleasantly surprised with the food and ambiance.

Food: We ordered a Cappuccino, Vodka Pasta, Nothing but nachos and a Madagascar for dessert. The food felt very carefully cooked without excess oil, a win for the health conscious foodies :P. Taste was not at all compromised and the dishes were well garnished and creatively presented.

Service: Service was moderately swift and friendly. Its a long place so calling some one to take your order felt little difficult. But we got friendly response which was a plus point.

Ambiance: They have a good lighting scheme and place will give you a warm cozy feeling.¬†

Verdict: I will recommended this for foodies who like exploring different types of cafes. This is a nice play to break the habit of going to the same old coffee joint in town over and over again.

My initial plan for Friday night was to visit this place, which I had come across in an article. But my friends were in a mood to have Indian, rather than continental, especially Italian. So we headed out to someplace else. After facing multiple rejections, I convinced them to come over to this place and boy, they were not disappointed. Very slick concept with respect to the decor and amenities. We go the window seat which overlooked the busy road from the 1st floor. They also had a open air seating space in a big balcony/courtyard. We became aware of it later while we were leaving.¬†

With regards to the service, they were prompt, courteous and always coming up with suggestions. The menu was not vast but it had all the ingredients for a good and the portions were large and filling. The presentation of the food was great and none matched each other. It shows the effort that they had put in planning out each meal. Especially their variety with regards to tea goes on and on. Though a dampener for non-vegetarians, they only serve vegetarian foods.¬†

For meal, we had ordered the following:
1. Mexican Muse
2. Pasta Ala Vodka
3. Chocolate Lava Cake
4. Ice Cream Fruit Bath
5. Mushroom Packed
6. Hello Aloos
7. Nothing but Nachos
8. Kiwi Smoothie
9. Tangy Mango (Disaster-Avoid it)
10. Typically Lasagne
11. Naan Pockets
12. Made in China
13. Bhaji Pav
14. Wrap & Roll
15. The Real Burger King ( Copyrights, eh?)
16. Chai Tea

Yeah, I know that's a lot. But we were 8 people and our exams had got over that day itself, so can help. Bottom line: Nobody had much to complain about and enjoyed their meal to the fullest.¬†

The concept is quite unique for Kolkata, their very own HKV-ian restaurant. Good place to hang out on a weekend. Do visit!

Read some good reviews about this place and wanted to try it out immediately! 
It's pretty easy to locate, a few blocks away from the junction of camac street and theatre road , the best thing about this place is obviously their staff,quite friendly and courteous.
It's a purely vegetarian restaurant and the menu sounds innovative. I ordered for a chatka Mary  which tasted like guava drink with some spices, it was quite refreshing. The much talked about "The great garlic bread" was eye appealing for sure and the Mushroom Packed were crispy & flavourful. The Nutella candy pizza was a huge let down, tasted like bread and sugar, the pizza base was dry and the dish seemed like it was prepared by a kid for a school project. 
The decor is fun, I did request them that I would like to sit in their outside area, they said they have less staff and hence that section is closed but after a few minutes a group of four went and sat outside, which I found a bit weird. Staff is quite earnest in their approach, but seems a little lost. But I will surely be back again if ever I am in the mood for something purely veg and quirky.

I was here for a friend's birthday treat on a weekday in the afternoon and still found this place full.The outdoor seating was not available so we asked for seating near the window place as we were 7/8 in no.but they assured us they'll shift us to that table when it gets empty after sometime,which they did not do later on and made another group sit there instead.This unprofessional behaviour was really disappointing on part of the management.
The ambience was not as per the expectations from a restaurant /cafe in such a prime location.The place was too noisy with the chatting of the customers.
Location:prime location and easily locatable.
Coming to the food,we had ordered: Nothing but nachos,cheeuze me,aglio olio spaghetti,lasagne,peanut butter chocolate shake and bubblegum candy milkshake,veg lasagne,pesto khandvi,coffee toffee martini.
Except the bubble gum candy milk shake(which was quite innovative but I personally did not like dat bubble gum taste) and cheeuze me(the filling was very less and thus its proper taste didn't come out) I loved all of the food ordered.presentation was good and food tasted awesome.I missed out having its choco lava cake( which I heard is equally tasty),so I am keen on visiting the cafe soon.
Service was slow that needs improvement though the staff was courteous.

We ordered nepoletana pizza which was good. The best thing about the pizza was the thin crust. Chocolava cake was heavenly. The staffs were very polite. I liked the place.

Located on a busy street, the place is easy to get to. The place looks nice with unique lighting and decor, books and board games for people who want to spend some time here. Really liked the different types of seating and the recycled materials used throughout the caf√© add to the charm of the place. The dishes on the menu are interestingly named. Clearly, a lot of thought has gone into it. Presentation was pretty interesting too. We ordered for mushroom risotto, vegetable burger and a couple of drinks, the preparations tasted nice and fresh. Service was much better this time.

I went on a Friday at around 9. But even during that peak hour, the staff was pretty adjusting in arranging a table for us as per our liking. The ambience is quirky, lively and light. We ordered their mezze mezza platter. The sauces that came along with the pita bread were just yum. We licked the dip container clean (off the spoon). Their tandoori platter is one thing you should definitely order. The dal makhani is something you should order this dish for. It is one of the best dal makhani you will have. The food presentation style will leave you amazed and well fed. Among others the next exciting thing you will find is the decor - plotted plants in coke and pepsi cans and books and games. Sigh!

A perfect place combined with beautiful music and exquisite decor.¬†
The place also features delish and well-seasoned food but as my experience says it will be ideal for a company of 3 or 4. The orders were
The Great Garlic Bread - Appealing presentation with decent cheese cover, 6 pieces in quantity.
Mushroom Packed - Crunchy cover unfolds the juicy and freshly prepared mushroom inside with cheesy dip, 6 pieces in quantity.
Chatka Mary - Spicy "chatka" taste with a refreshing feel during those hot summers, perfect for 2.

Price also being decent,¬†
So I would recommend this place for a perfect evening hangout. Although there was an open air arrangement but was not available on our first visit. So if possible I would like to try that on my second visit.

Spending a beautiful day with a friend after a very long time and bonding over the food , is undoubtedly the best thing happened at Cafe 4/1. A pure vegetarian restaurant, this place is gradually catching the attention of people.
We got a bit confused while spotting the exact location. We called up but no one responded. However finally we found it beside tanishq showroom.
The ambience of the place is very much innovative like the food they serve. The seating arrangements were so different and unique.
After hitting the place the very first thing we ordered was nimbu pani to quench our thirst. Then after going through the menu card we zeroed in to Thai local. The way they served the rolls in chai glasses was quite splendid. Loved this item very much. We also tried their dimsum trilogy, which was okay, hello aloos was beautifully presented though the taste was not that much appealing. Mushroom tikki was nice. But like Thai local another delicacy that made a lasting impression was baked cheesecake. It was really yummy.
The service was nice and fast. The staffs were courteous and helpful. Nice place to visit.

Cafe 4/1 is a  vegetarian delight. It has a very pretty ambience. A flight of stairs will lead u to a very beautiful place. The Menu is very well thought. The names given to dishes are very unique and well thought. The food certainly met my expectations.Hot Choco lava cake was the best I ever had.

Decor is amazing.
Food is ultra amazing.
Do try the gems and gum shake.. Their trademark Garlic bread and the chocolate lava cake!

Wonderful experience at cafe 4/1. I was waiting to go since quite some time. The names of the dishes are very innovative and the ambience is veru unique (check out the wall made of saucers)! The service was cordial and lets come to the best part - the food! I had the OTT sizzler, the made in china platter and the pasta and the food was very fresh and the taste delicious. A great start for Kolkata in exciting food joints! (y)

Stopped by for a quick coffee at this conveniently located cafe on the Camac St and ended up having a fun time!

It's huge for a 'cafe' with two seating areas - one on a first floor rooftop. The interiors are beautiful with a contrasting yellow and grey theme. Coffee was like any other good cafe, a little expensive though. Food options were interestingly named and presented and tasted delicious as well. The Caesar Salad named Et Tu Brute, Sahu ke kebab, the twisted mocktail of Chatka Mary were among the food that we tried and were really impressed. 

A must visit.

This cafe has a beautiful ambience! The indoor seating arrangement is aesthetically perfect. However , the disappointing part is food. My friend and I ordered pasta and pizza, the most basic dishes to order. Pasta was good enough, if not excellent but pizza initially was a big disappointment. It lacked the essential flavours found in a pizza. We were compelled to order a replacement. The replacement was much better. The waiting time was too long, considering how the restaurant wasn't facing any rush hour at all. It almost tested our patience . Also, there was another group complaining about the different dishes served to them.The conclusion is that it's a place with a charismatic ambience but you can't pay just for the ambience. It must be supplemented by better food in terms of flavour.

This caf√© has been newly opened and is located at Camac Street. Fancy interiors with very chirpy ambience. They have two sections and both of them r well decorated with funky chairs n groceries.. Waiters r attentive and service is really good.
Loads of items on menu which u can order. Varieties of salads soups starters .
I tried Pestogasm which is actually fettuccine or pasta ribbons made in pesto sauce and it was totally lip smacking. V well prepared. Plating was even v impressive and neatly done.
Next I tried was Baked Cheesecake which was again a hit.
All in all, a v good experience and I'm looking forward to visit again to try other dishes out there.

Horrible is the word to describe this place. This was our third visit after two fairly good experiences. The third experience was anything but good. Firstly, we had ordered tomato soup, which came with insect floating on it. Then we ordered pizza with just three toppings of onions, bell peppers and black olives. They also added broccoli which we protested since we had not ordered and requested them to change it. What was the most shocking was that the steward there told us to remove the same and consume it. That was the ultimate nail in the coffin.

I went to this place with few of my friends as a treat. We sat in the air conditioned place inside, it had an english kind of an ambience but again it was cool. We ordered the bubble gum drink, omg that was the only thing i dint like there. We ordered nachos, pizza, pasta and springroll. The nachos were really tasty and the pizza too. The pasta we ordered was a bit hard maybe because it was wheat pasta, but the pesto sauce was yum. The presentation of the spring roll was just amazing, they served in little coloured tea glasses. For the dessert we ordered chocolate lava cake, it looked 'aww', it looke sooo pretty and the taste was even better. I would love to cisit the place again.

This place is located just at Camac Street and Shakespeare Sarani crossing. Very nice ambience, they have a open seating also which is really nice.
Coming to the food. For starters we ordered Thai Local and Mushroom Paked. Both of the starters were really very good. Very well prepared and nice way of presenting also.
For main course we ordered Kaboom which is a sizzler and the Indian thali.
I should say the cottage cheese in the sizzler was extremely tasty and the Indian thali was amazing. I would say you guys should increase your Indian menu as well.
One suggestion the staff though very courteous, they need to be better trained. Like the table where we were seated was to small and ever after insisting on a larger table we weren't given a better table.
Overall very good place, this is a student favorite. Though a little expensive.

Funky interiors, good food and good presntation. 
What else does one need in a restaurant? :)
Went here last night, and thoroughly enjoyed. 
Great start with swag mera desi and some thai starter which came with one of the most amazing lemongrass flavoured chilli sauce I've tasted. Followed that with Naan Pockets (Indian take on pita Pockets), Lasagna and the Burger, all of which tasted how I expected them to, with a twist. 
Finished up my meal with a lava mug cake, which I found was yummy, though a tab bit too sweet. 
Also tried the Mushroom soup, which was average, and the Many Tangy which was super chatpata!

Cool cafe to hang out.. This has become a genre where presentation of food matters the most.. So full marks for this.. Not just the presentation but taste is also good enough.. But momos need more innovation in matter of taste.. You can hang around n give a different ambience to your elders group too , who are veg specific..

Absolutely an average place, but since its a newly opened joint, everyone seems to be rushing to this place.
The staff is not at all courteous, I was asked to shift to another table since it was 2 of us, but the very next moment the same table which we were asked to leave was occupied by 2 people, whereas we were told that we can't have it as its a table of 4. Not a very good impression to put within the 5 minutes of entering the caf√©, especially when more than half the caf√© was empty.

The portions of food served is indirectly proportional to the price paid for it. The names are although very catchy , but once it arrives on the table, you realise that it was just a way to get you lured into ordering the regular stuff with not so regular names. 

Over all, it was not a very good experience, but the doorman/guard was very polite and courteous, probably the only welcoming factor about this caf√©.

Not going to recommend this place to any.

This place gets a 9/10 for the ambience and decor. Visited the cafe this afternoon to meet an old friend. As soon as the food came, our topic of discussion shifted from old college gossips to the super amazing taste of the dishes we ordered. 

As starters we chose "Cheeuze me". They are sort of wantons, with spinach and cheese filings. The filing was delicious, though the coating was a bit oily. Basically, it could have been better.
Next in main course, we opted for "Typically Lasagne" and "Spaghetti Aglio E Olio", both a 10/10. The quantities were just perfect had we skipped the starter. 

Overall, a nice experience, and not that expensive either. 350 bucks per head, and you are offered really delicious food.

This is small cafe located near pantaloons camac street.... The ambience is mind blowing a very new concept... it has potted plants inside as decorative and on the tables too.... We ordered Dimsum trilogy, Arabiata Brain Freeze and Chocolate lava cake... the dimsum too nearly 15 mins to serve.. they notified us during the order that it might be late... their serving style was different and impressive but the dimsum they served was way more toward momo dumplings.... the taste was very good of all the three types that were served the filling was same in each type (different fillings were expected and would have given a variety other than just the covering)..... next coming to the Arabiata Brain Freeze which is a penne pasta cooked in tomato basil sauce, i am satisfied with the taste of the pasta very good flavours well cooked but the bread served was not upto mark... that's because a crispy garlic bread is generally served with pasta that tastes way better... now the chocolate lava cake, its the best of all the others i had, they served a scoop of vanilla ice-cream in a chocolate bowl with the chocolate lave cake... their combination of the cold vanilla ice-cream with the molten hot chocolava was way too good.. one should definitely go and try it.... now the staffs they are very friendly and well mannered only thing they need is a little more training... please do provide them with that so that the cafe rocks.... ¬†highly recommemded.... :)

Walked into this beautiful place today. Good to the soul this place is. Everywhere you look, it will make you smile. Talking about the food, I love their menu. It has something for everyone. The food is great and I would especially recommend their strawberry cheesecake shake and coffee toffee martini. Their Pesto gravy is very nicely flavoured too. 
What they can improve on is the attentiveness of their staff members. It was a task to call them to the table and order food. Other than that, kudos to this place.

Located in camac St opp Raymond's showroom. Does not quite live up to hype associated with it. The ambiance and the feel of the cafe is amazing though. Ordered for a "nothing but nachos". I must say that the liquid cheese poured over the nachos was certainly the most different and the best I've had so far. The nachos were pretty good too.
The next was a grilled cottage cheese dish named " BBQ board" which failed to impress me. The mashed potatoes served alongside was great, the slices of paneer were done quite perfectly, however the sauce poured over the paneer slices was horrible, overly sweet, and no trace of balance in the flavors there. The next on our order was a kaboom  sizzler which again was a disappointment. The only saving grace of the dish was the fact they served that liquid cheese with the vegetable patties. Our bill for these three dishes was INR 938. 
Quite impressed with the atmosphere inside the place(previously a barista outlet), but for the prices they charge, the quality needs improvement.
There are two things I want to mention
1. The portion size is very small for all the dishes.
2. The service is a tad bit slow.

This place got me drooling over it from the very first sight of it. Located a few steps away from Pantaloons, Camac Street, 4/1, is one of THE best cafes around. The name is intriguing in itself, and so is the tranquillity of this place amidst the hustle and bustle of the city around it. A newly opened Cafe with a fresh theme was a delight to the eye. This place is one of its kind. Very warm and welcoming, decorated with potted plants all around. Even the walls! The place gives you the feel to spread greenery which I think is great. Also, lights inside jars! :D I have never come across this sort of lighting at any restaurant in Kolkata. Full points for creativity! Talking about creativity, I think I need to make a mention of a few of the very unique items I came across in the menu :
Under the section 'ghaas phoos' - Et tu Brute (striking), AIB roast salad (offensive? I think not), Feta khao Beta (BEST xD). Other interesting items include Swag mera desi (lolwut), love at first slice (I don't mind falling), Pestogasm (Hell yes!), the nation wants to know (in for some surprise?) and Nutella candy pizza (you mean heaven?). However, since my college declared a surprise holiday, we didn't have plans to visit this place today. In other words, we were kinda broke and so we decided to go for the Arabiata Brain Freeze - red sauce (‚Çπ250) and the original Mr. Alfredo - white sauce (‚Çπ250). The staff was courteous but the waiter did look a little nervous and in the need for some more training. I guess that's acceptable for a start up. The pastas arrived after a brief period of wait (15 minutes maybe?) and I could say by the look of it that I was in for some scrumptious food today! And I wasn't mistaken. Absolutely dainty. I fell in love with the very first spoon of it. :') Considering the otherwise bland, undercooked, half-hearted pasta with no flavor whatsoever, served in most of the over-hyped restaurants I've been to, this was something that touched my heart! Overwhelming. I couldn't detect a fault in it. (the white sauce pasta). The red sauce was sheer brilliance as well. I'm personally not very fond of the red sauce but this one made me fall for it all over again! I mean, I've had restaurants boiling penne and serving it with tomato ketchup and labelling it as a red sauce pasta! What even... Anyhow, faith in pasta restored. :D The bill was given with a tiny pot of sapling beside it. (They really want you to plant one!) The cafe is fairly spacious and they also provide outdoor seating which looks like the prefect chill spot. Also, the music they play totally adds to the overall charm of the place and everything is in perfect sync the moment you enter 4/1. I would totally come here for dates and future hangouts! Will be adding more to the review upon the next visit. Thank you, 4/1, you made my day. :) 
A happy foodie.

Talking about the food first. We were regretting ordering Cheeuze me. I didn't expect it to be so bad. Plus they served it with tomato ketchup and not any dip as they've mentioned in the menu. Mezze Mazze was still better but not very yummy either. The Great Garlic Bread could have been more cheesy, we get better garlic bread at other places in the city. Chocolate Peanut butter shake tasted really good but we were expecting it to be chilled,it wasn't. Out of everything we ordered The Ice Cream fruit bath was the only thing we were satisfied with. Noise of the mixer grinder creates a chaos, otherwise the ambience is fine.

A fresh new cafe in the busiest of streets. Lovely decor and seating arrangement would catch your eyes s you step it. Talking about the food, we tried cheeuze me, pasta vodka and pizza al vodka. In beverages we had gems shake, strawberry margarita slush and strawberry cheesecake shake. All were great. The service was a bit slow but the food surely lived up to my expectation. The sunflower seeds they offered to plant, was a nice gesture.

The caf√© has replaced Barista Cr√®me in Camac Street. A long flight of stairs leads to the caf√©.

The caf√© was half full on a weekday evening.  

The tea Menu wasn‚Äôt served with the regular menu and I had to specially ask for it. (- ¬Ω)

We wanted to move to a bigger table since our table was shaky and the area was too noisy. The waiter wasn‚Äôt allowing us to sit at one even when there were plenty of bigger tables available for big group. (- ¬Ω) We finally did convince him and sat at the bigger and comfortable table.

I order a cappuccino that wasn‚Äôt great looking but tasted okay. It was something that could be stirred up at home. I was hoping for a better presented and flavoursome cuppa. (- ¬Ω)

The saviour was the amazing PESTOGASM. The server agreed to serve us the dish with some veggies.   It was a rich Pesto sauce with loads of vegetables.  Highly recommended.

The service was good with numerous servers to look after the crowd.

The bill doesn‚Äôt pinch the pocket. Along with the bill, we were presented a small bottle with Sunflower seeds. The planet could always do with more trees. I surely planted mine. Waiting to see if it actually grows.

Hoping to make more visits and try out more dishes.
______________________________________________________________

This is my second visit to Caf√© 4/1. It was on a weekday for dinner and the restaurant was busy.¬†

I would not call this place just a caf√©. It has enough variety to suit different vegetarian palates and offer a complete meal, start to end. 

The servers were helpful while taking orders but the service could be a tad bit more efficient with replacing cutlery and plates without being asked and also picking up soiled plates. 

We were a big group and ordered many dishes so I‚Äôll divide them into categories (Wow, Okay, Bah).

WOW ‚Äì¬†

‚Ä¢	Dimsum Trilogy

‚Ä¢	Pestogasm

‚Ä¢	Chocolate Leva Cake

OKAY ‚Äì¬†

‚Ä¢	4/1 Wanton Delight ‚Äì I loved the generous servings of Wanton and veggies but I found the soup salty.
‚Ä¢	Baked Cheese Cake ‚Äì Have eaten better

‚Ä¢	Dahi Kekab ‚Äì Loved the hot cruncy covering with cool Dahi inside. Only flaw was that the Dahi was sweet, would have preferred it on the spicier side
‚Ä¢	Strawberry Cheese Cake Shake  - Nice

‚Ä¢	The Real Burger King ‚Äì was too full to analyse the flavours. Wedges and salad served along. No salt and pepper in Wedges. No ketchup served.

‚Ä¢	Feta Khao Beta ‚Äì Too much Balsamic Vinegar

BAH ‚Äì¬†

‚Ä¢	Jomato ‚Äì too sweet

‚Ä¢	Classic Napoletana ‚Äì crispy ends but pizza is too soggy

‚Ä¢	Coffee Panacotta ‚Äì couldn‚Äôt taste much of coffee 

‚Ä¢	Mushroom Tikki ‚Äì It tasted like any other veg tikki. Wasted a mushroom option by ordering this.

‚Ä¢	Nothing but Nachos ‚Äì horrible! The nachos itself was horrible!

The bill came to 500 per person-included taxes, not included service charge. 

PS - It is heart wrenching to be paying almost 22% taxes every time we eat out.  ‚òπ I would rather donate food worth that money to the poor!

Ambience, as the given highlight, is the USP.
The staff needs to be a lil more trained as they aren't aware of whats there on the menu and whats available in the kitchen. Good seating arrangement, and a fancy presentation is thumbs up.
A liitle on the expensive side but worth a try for its food and ambience :)

There was a lot of buzz about this place so went there for lunch with friends. It's located on Camaac street near Theatre road xing. The ambience inside is good...the decor is quirky with a very rustic appeal. They also have a lot of potted plants all around in racks....which gives a soothing effect.But that is jarred by the very noisy mixie near the sitting area. It shatters the calmness of the place and spoils the pleasant dining experience. The management needs to look into this problem. The food by and large was very good. Their way of serving was new and interesting....adding to the appeal. We ordered the wanton soup which was excellent....fresh,crunchy veggies with wantons in the broth. Next item we had was Cheeuse me...a fried spinach starter served with a dip. Liked it a lot. Also had Greek salad....which had fresh crisp crunchy leaves ...nice. Then the tandoori platter with a assortment of tikkas and kebabs (paneer, mushroom&potatoes)and mini breads with black dal....was too good. The hero of the day was the strawberry cheesecake shake..yum.... served in an old-fashioned milk bottle wth a string tied around holding wafer biscuits.But a major drawback of this place is the service...which is not up to the mark. We had to ask repeatedly for water as well as glasses. A good place to chill with friends but service needs to buck up.

This one of the best cafe in kolkata. I have been here twice last month. Though it is newly opened cafe so some people might find difficulty in locating it. But this place is highly recommended to all tea lovers. Along with wide range of green tea 4/1 also offers some lip licking heavenly snacks. My most favorite is Thai Local. I also tried sandwiches, garlic bread but Thai Local and Cheese cake stands out. I tried Monkey Chief in beverages and find it quite satisfying with all ¬†balanced content of flavor and goodness of green tea. Besides, this is the best place to have a decent chat with some close friends due its beautiful ambiance and peaceful surrounding.... :):D

Lovely food and great ambience..Surely one of the places which intrigue you with their presentation of food..

The service is also very fast but a lot of time waiters are not around so probably they are little low on staff who are managing the show.. this is a major inconvenience when you are looking to find them around..

The food presentation and interesting and different menu makes you order more variety of food, however the portion sizes are extremely small and need to be worked on..

Special mention for the Dal Makhani as it was comparable to one of the best in town. We ordered quite a lot of food and almost everything was exceptionally good except for few things like the strawberry shake and the thai local.¬†

Surely worth visiting again and again.

Full points for ambience, full points for presentation and quality of food and the variety!!! D ducting .5 for service. Staff can be more courteous and i didnt like the fact that i had to ask for the menu as i was left unattended for a while. But great food and a lovely place with a fresh take on presentation. Will visit again!

Location : 

Its in Camac Street just beside the Shop Exclusive Lines. This place used to have Barista Earlier. It's near theatre road & Camac street crossing. It's on the first floor and divided into two sections. Parking is not an issue as they have their own parking as well as you can park opposite the restaurant on the main road also. 

Ambience : 

This place is big enough and moving space is there so not too much chaos. It's divided into two sections one is inside and one is outside. Both sections are centrally Air conditioned. Outside section has a live kitchen also. Hygiene is maintained as the place is neat and clean. Interiors are very average and has a Cafe sort of look. Targeted for youngsters but all age group people can go and enjoy.  Music was loud in outer section. So if you want to chit chat volume is loud a bit. But you can request to them to lower down the volume. 

Food :

The most important this is a pure veg restaurant. So for vegetarian food lovers this is a nice place to hang out. They have a good variety of food options one can order. We ordered for many dishes mainly Italian. Fettuccine Pasta, pesto basmati rice, pizza, garlic bread was very good. Presentation is very nice and in a unique way. Chef is really doing a good job and tastes are perfect. 

Overall the food was great and I really enjoyed going out there and will go again to try another items. 

Service : 

Service was good and fast. Waiters and serving boys are very helpful. That's great. 


Price : 

Prices are not very high and they have kept it competitive compared to other restaurant like this. It won't hurt you much. Taxes are same as applicable. 

Overall a very nice place to hangout with family and friends. Will surely recommend this place to others.

I would most definitely bow down to the designer of this cafe and the man who made it happen , it bangs the target for it's ambience and funkiness , you have actually very less to complain about the place, interior , design wise , ambience I would rate an eight out of ten , then the main part comes is the food , the starter course is different and quirky , mixtures and textures get you really interested in it , had the mezze mazza , which is different and for a change nice , almost like a fusion , order the it's all Greek salad , which is horrible , garlic bread was substandard and finally moved on to the main course , we had vodka pasta with had a little bitter taste of the vodka used in it and then finally pizza ala vodka which was an okay , because it was too oily and the preparation was not that good , but hey atleast better than raj Spanish cafe . This place would do wonders if it starts serving  alcohol and maybe non-veg food . A good place to go with a lot of friends and just chill and enjoy

First visit , quite impressed as a tea and coffee lover

Feel the efforts which have gone into making this place

One of the best interiors amongst the cafes in town, love the feel

Have some crazy big selection of tea and coffee , although you might have to ask for the tea menu which is separate and they don't always offer themselves

Service can surely be faster

Star points : have board games and books 
Usp: they give you seeds with your bill to take away

Super cute concept

Cafe 4/1 is very conspicuous because of the bright lights and big boards on 2-3 places in the exterior.On the inside it has very contemporary stripped down interiors.I loved the warm look of this place.Also,it has book shelves attached to the walls near the tables,giving it a very homely feel as well.
I had ordered the Lemon Bulberry,Lasagne , Nothing but Nachos and the 4/1 Wanton delight.
Well the bulberry was a drink to avoid.There was a sour aftertaste and I did not like it at all.

The Lasagne was delicious.The food dishes are served in a black pan type of vessel.The lasagne was in a red white mix sauce and was plated well.

The Nachos was impressive ! There was a generous amount of baked cheese on top of the nachos and the salsa on it was fresh and had the right amount of tang.

The wanton soup was a broth with vegetables and wantons.It is recommended for those who like less spicy and basic soups.Though it wasn't for my palate as I like intense flavours.

The staff is very courteous and service is good.
And the thing which makes me rave about this place again and again is that - they give you sunflower seeds to plant, (complimentary) provided with the bill.It is a very smart marketing ploy too apart from the environment factor.

This place is strongly recommended in the 'newly opened' category,mainly owing to its homely feel and quality of food.

Situated in Camac street, this place is a great relief from all the hassle. With a very urban decor, cafe 4/1 gives a sense of peace as soon as you enter. We started our meal with the chatka Mary, a spicy yet different drink. The presentation is what kept me intrigued. The tray of naan's and paneer tikka is my favourite. This tray is a must try for whoever visits the place. Not one dish in the tray is not worth trying, especially the mushrooms. The garlic bread is another of my favourites from this place. Since I am not an avid fan of peanuts I didn't like the peanut butter shake. But the strawberry cheesecake shake is also a worthy drink for all strawberry lovers.

Cafe 4/1 , a really nice place with a different concept. Finally a nice cafe in Kolkata without hookah and just for food. That too with amazing food. This place is very easy to locate. The tandoori tray was indeed amazing and even the 'The Great Garlic Bread'. And not at all overpriced. 
All in all a nice place. Must visit :D

The place is located at camac street. Near the theatre road and camac street crossing. Adjacent to the huge Tanishq jewellery store. Opposite Raymond's shop.

The decor of the cafe is very modern and very different from the usual. Focused more on greenery. The cafe is very spacious and spaced out seatings.
Though the seats are a bit uncomfortable.

Cutlery, straw and tissues are kept on the table itself in a wooden stand. I really liked this as it is annoying to call the serving boy for cutlery and tissues all the time.

The food was amazing. We had ordered for a tandoori platter which had 3 pieces of different cottage cheese tikkas. 2 pieces of stuffed mushroom tikka. 2 varieties of potatos. 2 varieties of kebabs. 2 types of dips/chutneys. Laccha onion and lemon slice. It also had 4 small breads and a full portion of kali dal. Trust me it was one of the best platters i have ever had. It actually had both starters and main course.

We also ordered for the great Garlic bread. I really liked the presentation of the garlic bread. Although it could have been more cheesy as i could taste simple raw bread at times. It should have been more garlicky and cheesy.

We had also ordered for a nimbu pani which can be ordered with a base of your choice : soda/water and a choice of your garnishing : sweet/salty/both.

The staff was courteous and the service was prompt. I asked the staff about the speciality dishes of the cafe and the suggestions given by him were nice.

The portions per dish are apt for 2 people and a bit less for 3.

Although Chinese and Thai were not available.

All in all it was a great experience.

Pocket pinch : ‚Çπ700 (all inclusive) for the 3 things we had ordered. (They do not levy service charge)

The pinch can go up to ‚Çπ1000 for two.

The main course is simply amazing and that makes this place a must go to place for every foodie but the deserts are a disappointment. I had the special pizza and the penne Arrabiata and both these dishes were simple mouth watering. Moving onto the deserts, had heard a lot about the  Nutella pizza but it was a very big let down.

This place has opened just a few months back and within this short period of time this place has made its mark in the list to compete for being one of the best Cafes of Kolkata. This place serves delicious pure veg food. The place is located just beside the famous Rolex watch Showroom of Camac Street near the Camac Street-Shakespeare Sarani Crossing. The cafe is located in the 1st floor. The cafe is spacious and has provisions for both indoor and outdoor seating. We tried the indoor seating. The ambience is too good. The lights are hanging from the ceilings. The chairs , tables and sofas are all customised. The burger was great. The waiters are very friendly yet professional. You will find ample of great indoor board games here. This is a great place to hangout with your best mates. Definitely you can spend some great time here with persons you love.

I visited the place with 5 other friends, all of us ordered 1 drink each. Drinks were average at best but the service was extremely bad and borderline shameful. Details below.
Lemon Ice Tea : Not that great, could have been passed off for lemon flavoured cold water.
Tangy Mango Cooler : Average. 
Jasmine Tea : Okay. Not much wrong you can do with Jasmine Tea anyway considering it's hot water and a tea bag.
Strawberry Ice Tea : Average.
Gems Bubble Gum Shake : Quite good, the only¬† positive to come out. Cool presentation in an old fashioned milk bottle and tasted nice.
(Last, but not the least) Banana, Ginger & Pineapple Smoothie : No idea how it tasted as my friend refused to because of 2 reasons. A> It came 20 minutes after the other drinks, i.e. when the rest of us were done. B> It was NOT A SMOOTHIE. It looked like someone had mixed some juices and served 100-150ml of a drink in a chai cup (pic attached). It was ridiculous. The whole thing could have been finished in 2 gulps. It was apparently one of their signature drinks. We sent it back, despite requests from the manager who came to talk to us after the waiters seemed nervous.

Service : Horrendous. We had to ask 3 times for water. The first time, only one of us was given a glass and the rest of us ignored. The second time, the waiter set 5 more glasses on the table and disappeared. After 5 minutes we had to ask a third time for the actual water. 
The smoothie fiasco added to the overall bad experience and we noticed a distinct lack of interest in the service staff who we had to call 4-5 times to attend us. 

Never coming back to this place again, actively warning friends and family not to come here also.

To start with, I found this place quite alluring‚Äì in the sense it has a very retro-chic ambience, very calm and chilled out sort. The place is pretty huge and the interiors are double thumbs up, for me. Especially loved the industrial tables and adjoined seatings‚Äì interesting to say the least.

Coming to the food, yes the menu I feel is limited but perhaps they owe it to the fact that that they are a new place on the block, and hopefully will add up in future. 
So ended up ordering three things- garlic bread, stuffed mushrooms and nachos. All of which were good, but nothing great that would draw me back. Though the presentation was pretty nice, specially the way they served the garlic bread. Also had ordered lemon iced tea which was a delight for sure, quite different yet nice. 
About the hospitality, the staff wasn't so readily available, also when they came woth our orders, they just kept it on one side of the table n left without acknowledging us‚Äì that felt quite preposterous given the niceties of the place. Also would recommend upping the quantity of the food served. 
 One place, i see myself going again, but only for the ambience, and maybe for the food. Cheers!

The lychee flowering tea is a must try. I think it's the first place in Kolkata where they serve blossoming tea - where the flower blossoms before your eyes in the drink. It was exciting to watch the flower blossom live! The smell was awesome, so was the taste. The desert fruit blood bath was as interesting as the name. We also ordered¬†a kaboom sizzler, another good pick. Filling and yummy. overall, plan to visit the place again and again. congratulations to the team :)

The first thing that strikes you as soon as u look up from footpath of the camac street is the open glass cafe! As one enters through the stairs the amazing graphics and creative designs catches the eye. The interiors of the cafe is very exposed , raw and yet has a sense of coziness to it. Greenery around with redesigned tables and the innovative seating arrangements with hatches and screws and a lot of big glass windows for the natural light to sweep in ! The typical cemented floor of traditional houses white painted walls with pots and paintbrushes hanging. The place is surely gonna make you feel very unique. 
The next best and most important part of this place is the food and the presentation. The menu catches the eye with innovative names of each dishes like cheeuse me etc.... The food itself makes you want for more because of the beautiful presentation. It actually increases the appetite! The hospitality is also good . We tried out the tomato soup with jasmine which was so pure and original. The chocolate peanut butter shake is also very tasty with a beautiful presentation of peanuts beside the shakes attached with a jute string! The espresso coffee with its layers is also very pleasing. Also tried the mojito which was refreshing with green apples. The pizza could be customised as per your requirements. Loved the thin crust pizzas and the size is also quite standard. Then we tried the dish called cheeuse me which is a spinach and cheese filling pockets and then fried served with tomato sauce dip. This thing tasted just amazing. I have never tried anything like this before. 
I am going to keep visiting this place and try out all the items in the menu. The place is a superhit. Best for hanging out with friends and chilling or getting your girlfriends and sitting and chatting with them. It can also be a romantic place with the outdoor seating on a winter day .... Just a perfect place opposite to the shopping malls of camac street !

I decided to try this new place after seeing that it was trending on Zomato within few days of its opening. It is easy to locate. They have two sections, one A.C. and the other Non/A.C. Plain white walls with colourful plant pots hanging on them. A variety of ceiling lamps. The interiors are well thought after with big windows that lets sufficient amount of natural light to come in. Their menu has a lot of variety and unique dishes. From Indian savouries, Italian delicacies to healthy ghaas phoos. The staff is cordial and the service quite good. Everything we ordered was well prepared and presented. We ordered:
1. Chocolate Peanut Butter Shake
2. Nespresso 
3. Jomato Soup - Tomato soup with jasmine infusion
4. Green Apple Mojito
5. Pizza Nepolitana
6. Cheeuze Me - Cheese and spinach fritters which were my FAVOURITE.

Though I have been coming back during the last year, yesterday was there again and was again proved that this place is too good, be it food or be it service! 
Tried new stuff and the Chatka Mary and the Dahi Kebab deserve special mention!! Ultra yummy!! Service was impeccable and had a great time as ever.


Rustic charm! Loved the decor... The wagon tables, the case settees, the wires and tubes, the lamps with designed filaments.. All wood & iron..
Feast for the eyes.! The menu, the names of the eats & drinks which serve as clues to the fusion flavours.. And the food itself - presented in rustic & charming.. 
I guess the food they served can only be defined as gastronomical delights.. Each dish or drink has its unique flavour.. Special mentions : the Thai rolls served in cutting chai glasses, the desi kabuli chana tarts, the espresso marshmallow martini.. 
To die for !! The Nutella candy pizza! Nutella lovers will fall in love with the way it looks as well as tastes.. It's every kid's dream come true & for some adults too I'm sure!! Only wish there was more Nutella on the base.. They were skimpy with the Nutella.
Overall a great experience and I'm definitely going back for more!

It is located just above exclusive lines showroom. Firstly they had barista here. Went there on my birthday treat. Mainly the rating is for there presentation to give the food. Ambience is homely. Staffs were friendly and cordial. Parking is available. It is a pure vegetarian outlet, love that. Many of the items in the menu they didn't had it. Now let's start the food journey. We had ordered several items, garlic bread, mix sauce pasta, roll wrap, mezze mazze, cheese spinach( looked like a spinach samosa), gandhoraj Mojito, Italian ice cream soda, green apple Mojito, and finally in dessert chocolate lava cake, don't remember of  it's name n all. But all items were amazing. 
Highly recommended

It's seldom that a food joint fascinates me enough to write a review. I use zomato mostly to look for places. Hardly motivated to write reviews. But this place is different. Although this is done by someone known to me, i was skeptical, so, took a friend along to be unbiased and get a feedback. And trust me, it is worth all the appreciation. As soon as you enter the cafe, the interiors mesmerize you. Warm , inspiring and very soothing. Had gone with a kolkatan- European friend and his first comment was - "this place is quite 'berlinesque'!! Since when did Kolkata start having such refined taste." You find cafes with such a feel in Europe. He seemed impressed. We started with a mushroom soup which came in a large wooden bowl with a bread...it tasted as delicious as it looked. The portion was quite a lot for a soup and so I felt full already. My friend ordered the wanton soup which he enjoyed too. The menu was really creatively done and I was tempted order few things by the sheer name... 'Original Mr Alfredo' , hello aloos' and 'pestogasm'! Amusing! The names and the presentation made us feel hungrier, fortunately the taste matched up too. The good quality of food was quite evident. After a round of fun games ( the combination of fine dining experience with games is bang on!) , we ordered Thai local.... And this one was truly the best. Served in cutting chani glasses, it has the right balance of spices and flavours.
It is worth mentioning that the place does not serve hookah.. What a welcome break from the cluttered and polluted hazy air of most cafes that we are used to. It truly felt fresh and clean. We didn't think we will end up spending so much time there, with stomachs too full for a desert, so we decided to finish it with a gems bubblegum shake. Creamy, heavy and yummy!
The entire ambience is so inviting, ... This place is truly worth your time and money. :) Feel proud that I know the owner. Congratulations :)

All non vegetarian foodies when you tease vegetarian foodies then we can't speak much but we can show way to cafe alike Cafe 4/1 ;) where you will get plenty of veg food option well presented and tasty also. Cafe 4/1 is the same place where there was Barista creme Lavazza was used to be there in camac street.    When you enter Cafe 4/1 you will love that the place has its own unique decor, furniture, lighting and above all it has a warmness which would attract people to spend hours even if you are alone. Well what to say about food I just loved each and everything which came to my table, Thai local must try for spring roll fans, when thai local comes to your table i am sure 1st you will love to click a pic of it as you will love the way it is served, Swag mera deshi  must try for all pindi chaana lovers, even you are not found of pindi chaana also then also you should try because I am sure after having it you will start loving pindi channa, Nachos were decent nothing so great. On drinks kokum cooler was good nice chatapata tangy taste which is quite refreshing, green apple mojito, (they have different flavoured mojito was not able to try all) strawberry cheese cake shake must try for all strawberry shake lovers. Must try Tandoori tray, but mind it only two people can enjoy it well as they serve everything on this tray one piece whether it's starter or whether it's breads. If you love sizzler then must go for Sizzler OTT. Overall food is tasty, serving style is unique and staffs are helpful to suggest and serve you the best. Finally the city of joy is really become joyful to all food lovers with this cafe like cafe 4/1 coming up and serving. Keep it up.

Visited cafe 4/1 on 22/10/2015 with high expectations after listening so much from my friends. Since I found the menu very tempting, I wanted to try as much items I could. So went there in 7 nos. and ordered around 17 items there.
As you enter the cafe, you will love the decor and seating arrangements. There is uniqueness in it. But I dnt liked the chair, though unique but were not comfortable. Staffs were well trained and helpful. The time taken to serve the order after ordering was good. But there USP is the vast choice in the menu with some items which will not find in any other restaurant/cafe and there uniqueness in presenting it.
Coming to food/drink items..
Mushroom madness.. Divine soup for mushroom lovers.. Just loved it..
Great garlic bread.. Full marks for presentation.. Tastewise very good.. Must try..
Thai local.. It was more like a spring roll served with a dip in glass.. It was good..
Cheeuze Me.. It was Average.. 
Swag mera desi.. Very good taste.. It's an item of pindi chana.. It was different.. Pindi chana lovers must try..
Mushroom tikki.. It was good.. As the mushrooms are finely chopped u will not feel that u are having a mushroom..
Feta khao beta.. It is melon served with feta cheese.. It was different and very tasty..
Love at first slice.. Mushroom with little veggies in pesto sauce topped with goat cheese on freshly made thin crust pizza bread.. It was very good.. 
OTT (sizzler).. Soya burger steak, tossed veggies, wedges, herbed rice & jalape√±o cheese sauce.. Dnt liked it at all.. Miss a gravy item with herbed rice..
Typically lasagne.. Average.. Not recommended..
Tandoori tray.. It's ideal for 1 person.. 3 types of paneer starter.. Mushroom tikka.. Mushroom packed.. Hello aloos.. 4 types of bread.. Kali dal.. Two types of dip.. Perfect platter to try different tandoori items.. Highly recommended..
Expresso Marshmallow Martini.. Dnt liked it at all..
Bullberry and kokum cooler.. Liked it.. Very refreshing..
Strawberry cheese cake shake & mojito (gandharaj).. Very average..
Chatka marry.. Very differently presented.. But dnt liked it as was very spicy..
Overall our experience was very good.. A big thump up for the varieties and newness in the menu.. Awesome presentation.. Few food items need improvement tastewise.. Mocktails were average tastewise..

Its an amazing place. Great ambience! We ordered a pesto and a margherita pizza which was amazing :) Then comes the garlic bread which again was good. We also ordered a drink 'chatka mary' which stole the show. Everyone enjoyed the drink. I found the staff very rude and unhelpful. This disappointed me a lot.

 The Thai Appetiser is great and so is the Falafal. The Red Melange rice based dish was really nice and so was the Cranberry mocktail!!

Absolutely loved this place. Extremely cool decor and this place has a great vibe. Ordered hello Aloos for starters and it was really good. For main course, ordered a kaboom (sizzler).it came with 2 really yummy dips. One was a mayo dip and the other one was cherry tomatoes in olive oil. Dessert was a bit disappointing. Ordered a Madagascar. It was too creamy and lacked taste. The place was bustling with people and the service was a tad bit slow. But overall a great place. I was really fascinated by the way the presented the garlic bread which the table next to ours. Would definitely visit again and try it.

I happned to visit this newly opened cafe last week. It's an amazing joint with nice ambience.
The garlic bread was my personal favourite. Much try. Nothing but nachos was very appealing.
The strawberry cheesecake shake looked different but was average in taste.
Pizzas and pastas were good too.
Dish called hello aloos was a complete disaster.
The choices for desserts are not many. Never the less, the chocolate lava cake was delicious and the highlight of the evening.

Cafe 4/1 camac street is located in the heart of the city- camac street area. This cafe truly changes everything in terms of food, ambience and service! Trust me this change is good. Calcutta hasn't seen anything like this place.
On entering you are bound to be left speechless with every corner of the cafe catching your fancy!
Where do I begin? From the smart seating to the interesting motifs, the interesting cycle stool installation!
The food here is a mish mash of everything nice- Italian,Thai, Mexican, american and let me mention that the menu is so interesting! Fun names that make dishes sound so interesting!
In my two visits I have ordered for the following:
Cheeuze me- spinach cheese triangles. # Verdict: Hit
Hello Aloos- fried potato tartlets with olive oil and lettuce side.# Verdict: Superhit
Typically lasagne- Authentic and very Italian home staple served fresh and piping hot #Verdict: Hit
Pesto pasta - fresh basil pesto ( homemade) tossed in penne served with love #Verdict: Super hit
Kaboom sizzler: A cottage cheese steak served on a platter # Verdict: Hit
Gems and bubblegum shake- I'm not saying anything. Please try it !! #Verdict: super hit
Peanut butter and chocolate shake- Very American very comforting #Verdict: super hit

I should not miss pointing out that the food presentation is unreal, innovation is an understatement

The service is really fast and I find the place to be very welcoming.

I am truly mesmerized by this cafe's tasteful interiors, great cooking and presentation and not to forget the warm, fuzzy feeling it gives you when you are here.

Going back again and again

Final Verdict: Highly recommended! I assure you, you will not be disappointed :)

Great going guys!

Cozy cafe with amazing interiors ! You can easily compare it with SOCIAL.Decor looks fab with swanky seats,plants on every table n walls.

Menu is all veg! I wish there was more variety in mains.Starter n mains was yummy n presentation wise it was spot on ! Dessert I thought (thandai panacotta) was too dense n sweet(can be avoided ) 

Ambience : 5/5(amazing)
Food : 4/5 ( dessert was a bit let down )
Service :4/5 ( courteous staff n decent service.although servers were not well versed with the menu ,new place m sure it will improve with time )

Overall a nice experience .4/1 can be one of the best cafe in town ! 

Must try :Thai local

Well kolkata's F&B industry is having a really good run over the last two years with so many new places coming up every other week. Some have been decent, while maximum of the lot have not been able to make their mark.

But this place is undoubtedly one of the best among the new ones opened in town.

EACH and EVERY dish in the menu is beyond anything I could say for it.
Their menu is absolutely different from the general stuff we find these days.
The place is done up beautifully, spacious, bright, chic. Not at all a pocket pincher.

Totally in love with this new joint.
Full Marks to the CHEF

Kudos to the minds behind 4/1.

Keep up the GREAT work.

Cafe 4/1 is located opposite the Raymond Showroom in Camac Street above the Exclusive Lines store. I went when it was about to open officially and only a few people knew about it. I came to know about it from a close relative, who knows the owner personally.
The decor is very nice and rustic with dim lights and quirky furniture. It reminded me of Social Offline in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. I quite liked it. Warm and inviting!
Coming to the food, I liked almost everything I ordered. Especially the Thai Thali, Pouty Poblano, Nothing but Nachos and Baked Cheesecake.
The service was quick and the presentation was great.
Pocket Pinch : 1000 for two.

Located at the junction of camac street and theatre road, Cafe 4/1 has a great locational advantage of being situated in the heart of the city. 
From the outside, the cafe, with the 4/1 logo ( yellow )¬† printed all over its white walls, gives it a pretty cool look. 
The staircase leading to the cafe has a huge smiley and is very inviting and refreshing. 
As you enter, you feel as though you're in an eatery in an English village. 
The furniture used along with the dim yellow lights gives a very rustic feel to the cafe .Overall, it's a very welcoming atmosphere.
The staff gave us the menu, which was rather innovative however it also was complicated to an extent. With some assistance from the staff, we placed our order. 
Coming to the food, 4/1 boasts of great presentation and unique food, giving a break to most cafes and eateries in the city. 
We were first served our drinks and soup and they're one of the best shakes I've had !
The gems bubblegum shake deserves a special mention and is a must try and is sure to be a hit amongst kids and even youngsters who've got a sweet tooth. 
My mother tried their wanton soup and she said it was very refreshing and light and at the same time, like most other light soups, didn't taste flat. She seemed really impressed ! 

Amongst the appetisers what really impressed us is the "Thai local". If you're fond of spicy food and you wanna see some good innovative presentation, then you should definitely go for it. 
The main course we'd ordered had a portion of pasta, a pizza as well as a sizzler. 
The pizza and pasta were really good however the OTT sizzler was exceptionally good ! 
It tasted amazing and for once I didn't miss non veg in my platter, and that really is something ! 
Even though we were pretty full, we were suggested to try out their deserts. 
We went for a portion of baked cheesecake and chocolate lava cake and both were delicious and marked an end to a great meal. The baked cheesecake is a must ! 

From the very entrance to the presentation and taste of food, to the ambiance,visiting 4/1 has been a delight as they've maintained innovation and uniqueness to a great extent. 

I've already suggested the newly opened eatery to many. So if you're the kind of person who would want to try out a place where things are innovative and unique, 4/1 is a must !

This place was on my list for a very long time. The first thing you notice when you enter this cafe is the homely and unique interiors. Simply loved the rustic look. They have an outdoor seating as well. Talking about the food we ordered. The two shakes we called for : espresso marshmallow martini and gems bubble gum shake were superb. So refreshing and different in taste. Frankly I did not like the food much. The nachos were disgusting with a taste and smell of msutard oil in it. The kaboom sizzler was not great too. The pizza was extremely sweet. The only dish which was different and tasty was the garlic bread. This cafe could be a hit only if they work upon the food quality and taste

Saw this place on Camac Street and decided to give it a try, knowing nothing about what was in store inside. To my surprise I was NOT disappointed at all! Such a pleasure to have eaten here and had such a good time with the board games and also the unique decor. The ambience was really good and the creative utensils that they used also kept me hooked to the place. 
Coming to the food, it is a pure veg place with a lot to offer. Also, a no-hookah caf√© was a pleasant surprise! We ordered Mushroom Packed,which was a fried starter. Along with it was, Wanton Soup, Nachos and Hello Potato. I liked everything except the Mushroom as I don't prefer fried Mushroom. Next, we had Kaboom Sizzler which was good as well but it had very little quantity of rice and veggies. The Vegetable Pizza that we ordered could have been made crispier. Then we had Grilled Vegetable Rissoto which was really well made. 
All in all, the Sunday afternoon was very well spent!

Indians are known to find fault with everything and we are a hard to please bunch....thanks for nothing communalism :P Unfortunately, 4/1 is impossible to critique, it is that good. The attention to detail and the thought behind the simple yet appealing design catches you off guard.¬†
The minimal and sparse space is warm and cozy. The retrofitted interiors reminded me of converted warehouses in the meat packing district in New York.The staff are nice to a fault and the energy inside is very welcoming and I must ask the owner for his playlist.¬†
The open to the sky area is still under construction and even there, 4/1 has managed to make use of basic everyday items and turning them into bespoke interior design. Loved the Mondrian inspired chest of draws and the exposed neon cables holding the bulbs, and before I forget, the wall full of available-at-new-market saucers.¬†
Before I jump into reviewing its amazing food, 4/1 deserves another round of applause for adding a patch of greenery to every available nook and cranny. The tiny green garden outside the windows with paint cans as planters is absolute genius. The distressed leather seats complete with studs is another winner. Another 10 points for a milkmaid can planter for indoor plants and the potato sack sofa covers.
I can go on and on about the design but I wont bore you. I'd gone with a friend and we ordered for a Basil Mojito ( love mason jars), cappuccino, Pizza a la vodka,and a baked cheesecake. As easy as Mojito is to make , most restaurants screw it up. Not 4/1. It was simply divine. The pizza was the perfect balance of ingredients with no flavour overpowering the other. Im no fan of pineapple on pizza, but I loved it. The infusion of rose in the cheesecake was another pleasant surprise and I wont rest easy unless I've tried each and every dish on their menu. The tea menu is pretty extensive too and I'll ask some tea drinking friends to review it for me, and then update this review accordingly.¬†
The cheque came in this tray with a tiny plant, some candy and a vial of sunflower seeds which read:"lets grow together". I don't think Ive ever fallen for something so senselessly and I cant wait to go back to 4/1.

Just a stone's throw from my house, this cafe is situated at the place which was earlier housed by Barrista Lavazza at Camac Street.

Though I wasn't amused by the name. "4/1" is the address of the place n probably the management wanted to make this place a landmark by the name itself.

The interiors are really well done. As u climb up the stairs, you'll notice a smiley printed on it if u look vertically. The cafe tries to give a very rustic-street-garage type look and it is successful in doing so. They have different types of chairs and tables. Some tables have wheels underneath them, some tables have chair attached where u need to pull out the seat. They also provide u with a small vase on each table with fresh flowers in it. Good idea to bring freshness inside a cafe.

On the table were some tissues which had "tictactoe" printed on it, so you could pass the time with the age old game. They also have an outdoor seating which is still under construction. I had a look at the outdoor and it was looking beautiful. The walls were being thatched with beautiful saucers.

Coming to business : Food...
Not really happy with the food. I had ordered a Wanton Soup. It was served in a nice wooden bowl. The flavours and taste was nice. And it was quite light. Occupied only a tiny part of my stomach.

I also ordered a Kaboom Sizzler.
The Sizzler looked appealing but wasn't great in taste. It came with Cottage Cheese, Grilled Veggies, Potato Wedges, Rice, n Onions. The Cottage Cheese was yummmmmm. Other than that everything else was ordinary. The cabbage leaves which formed the base were soaked in oil and it tasted bad. I'm not gonna order this Sizzler again. It was kinda OK.

The music played in the background was very nice n soothing. It was Instrumental and it brought peace to the mind. Also the utensils were quite abstract. The wooden bowls, the black plates n other items were very unusual but nice. This is that kind of place where you could come by yourself n rejuvenate your mind and stomach.

The bill was brought to the table along with a small bottle which contained flower seeds. Nice Gesture.

In all,
For the interiors - 5/5
For the food - 3/5.

Visited the newly opened place in lunch hours... 
The place has been reworked as a new place which was earlier known as Barista in Camac Street...

Location: It's very easily located on the main road in Camac Street next door to CCD....

Ambience: The place is nicely made with wooden furniture n its like a old garage kind of rough look given with games, books and other activities side up to occupy someone more in the cafe..

Food: ordered a Nespresso and Mogambo Couscous Hua..
Nespresso is a Hot coffee which is only option in their menu... U have with either with milk or pure black coffee... It was nice n strong as per my taste...  The second food items was a barley burger üçî with soya tikki and couscous...

Burger was healthy n it was served with salad and potato wedges instead of fries we get usually.. The burger was tasty n it has good portion of salad n tikki was less oily...

The place is being promoted as Tea and Healthy Food üòã cafe which will be more of liking for health conscious people...

Two things didn't like: One- they have Thali in their menu which is strange to assume from a cafe.. Second: Only one option of coffee...

Service: Newly opened place so the staff will be with flow with the menu.. Service is 15-20 mins and they serve with polite and smiling face..

The owner visited the table and asked for feedback regards to the overall place... 

Do visit the place once.. Their outer seating arrangement is under way and its a pure veg cafe...
