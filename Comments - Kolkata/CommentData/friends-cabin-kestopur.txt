Well not everything in this place can be tried that's for sure but yup some items are eatable. Biriyani is a specifoc Item which is No-No in here if you don't want to forget the taste of biriyani. Roti and egg items are a bit better and in the field of chicken this shop failed miserably.
Happy Reading FOLKS.

Well visit only if no other option left. But trust me however the taste is and no matter  how long is the waiting time it's gonna bite on your purse. It's a below average "Bhater Hotel" with not so average pricing when compared to quality or quantity. Very cozy and I really doubt about the cleanliness here. One thing that's good a TV is there for you.

Keep aside all multicrusine, EXECUTIVE class restuarant . It is a place one can visit while you are down at Shyam bazar. Food quality, pretty average. Price average. Ambience just forget it. Can try. No specific  dine in menu to suggest but try out which ever things you prefer frm the menu. ( Not yet visited after the renovation) . Seems good. WIP
