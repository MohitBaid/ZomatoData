It's good...
It's tasty, yet needs a little more proper servicing and the price is a bit high...
Liked the kebabs and cutlet though the choices are limited...

I quite like their fried chicken wings. But this week for a change I tried Shawarma roll (@Rs 40) and I must say that it was a disappointment. try their kebabs and wings and nothing else.

Arambagh is an old name in the business. Their kebabs are very famous! My favourite is their Chicken Reshmi Kebab which has the perfect "reshmi masala" taste to it. 5 pcs of kebab priced at Rs. 100. The chicken is always fresh and great to taste. all in all, a good food outlet!

Not a nice experience.
The shawarma was not that good. 
You have to work hard to really compete other good restaurants in Kolkata.
Thank you :)

This small outlet of Arambagh's chicken has many things to offer..This was near to my previous coaching centre and I used to come here for snacks and even for lunch. Good food and reasonable price with occasional exiting offers are their speciality.

As I am very fond of chicken this place was in my bookmark list since a long time. Visited another outlets before and had good experience. I loved their chicken wingsüçó 2pcs costing 40‚Çπ and also chicken fried wingsüçó 2pcs costing 50‚Çπ. Chicken reshmi kebab and tikia kebab both are very good. Chicken cutlet is also yummy. This place is quite easy on pocket. So if you are a chicken lover this place is right for you to have some delicious chicken snacks without getting a hole into your pocket.

Arambagh's Chicken outlets offer various type of fries, roasted chicken , chicken wings, tikka kabbab, Reshmi kabbab. Very rich and good in taste ! Today only I had Jaan from this outlet. One promotional offer going on in kabab. Buy 2 Get 1. KABBAB per plate cost is only RS. 100. So ultimately you can enjoy 3 plates of fresh yummy KABBAB only in 200 Rupees.

Arambagh chicken outlets offer you different varieties of fries and roasted chicken. Kebabs, sandwiches, spring rolls, cutlets etc. All of them are really yummy. The most important part is they are really cheap. You get one plate of kebab at 90 Rs only.

Though the closest outlet near my house would be the one near Tridhara Sammilani, I've visited this particular outlet quite a many times (courtesy - shopping at lake mall)

This is cute little place mostly known by me for buying chicken nuggets, sausages, salamis and French fries. 
Little did I expect that the fried stuff on display would be so good. 

I've tried out their steamed chicken momo quite a few times now. It has 5 medium sized momos with ample chicken stuffing. Good enough for the price we are paying - 45 bucks. 
Last month I wanted to try something else and ended up with the Chicken shawarma roll. It was nothing but plain rooti stuffed with chicken. Okay, the chicken preparation tasted really good. I guess it was priced at 55 bucks. 

Overall a good place if you wanna stop by for some quick bites. Easy on the pocket and we all know that Arambagh doesn't compromise on the quality front. A good deal indeed!

My father picked up some reshmi kabab and some BBQ chicken wing (with skin) from this outlet a few days back. Firstly the food was well packed. The taste was fresh and delicious. Most importantly the prices were very cheap. The quality was great. The reshmi kabab had 6 big pieces of kabab. The BBQ chicken wing had one mid sized wing, it was yummilicious.

When you feel tired and are looking for some quick snacks, this is the place to visit... Nothing extraordinary in taste or quality but fulfilling in taste... Ordered kima ball, chicken cutlet and chicken kabiraji... Kima ball was the worst of all... It was more of masala rather than kima... Disappointed... Next was chicken cutlet... It was ok... You can feel the chicken pieces along with the spices while eating... Kabiraji was a dampener again... It was nothing like the famous kabirajis available elsewhere..

Overall it's OK... If you don't find a place to eat, go to this place...

First things first; there are Arambagh Chicken outlets at near Netaji Bhavan metro station (Bhawanipore) and one at Howrah Station. Why aren't those registered in Zomato??

I have ate at all their four counters and the Bhawanipore counter is the best of the lot! 3.5 stars to it!!

As for this one; two okay-ish experience and two terrible ones!!

The chicken wings and the reshmi kabas were good!! The tikka kabab was moderate in taste.

As for my last experience.. (after that I swore never to waste my money on this outlet ever). Ordered Chicken burgers. We had ordered two. Unfortunately we took them home. Else we could have complained then and there! (which we did the next day but the staff wasn't too keen on hearing it)
The burger buns were ATLEAST a week stale. The smell was pathetic. And the chicken patty was worse. It looked stale. It smelt stale. It tasted stale.

We just took one bite each . And after a few hours; our stomachs got badly upset.

Bad bad bad!!

Would have given it the lowest rating; had the reshmi kababs not been good!!

I have to admit this place is cheap.¬†
Chicken Shawarma priced at 35 INR had sufficient chicken filling inside. I didn't like the overall taste though. Maybe because it was too dry. Chicken Wings are good. A welcome change from regular Mio Amore/ Kathleen shop.

This is not a place to sit and eat , it is basically a part of arambagh grocery store where you get fast food , you buy and take the food home, microwave it and finally relish it !! 
Today i was passing through this place and suddenly wanted to have chicken wings and i went there and parcelled one tandoori chicken, two fried chicken wings and two wing strips for me and my sister . Chicken are tasty and healthy and safe here. You get fresh raw chicken too. I like to have the shawarma wrap next time.

Kebabs are good and succulent. Please DO NOT try the Chicken samosas. Horribly tasteless and extremely salty. Ordered one at New town Shapoorji outlet. Doesn't do any justice to the steep price of INR15. Barring this, decent variety.

Arambagh's Chicken has been in business for more than a decade now and has become a familiar name to every household. When it comes to quality and fresh chicken and other poultry products it is the name "Arambagh's Chicken" comes to our mind. 
They have embarked a long journey- started with a moderate sized poultry farm in arambagh and has now turned into a multimillion dollar company with dozens of convenience stores all over Kolkata.
This joint of arambagh's chicken is a newly opened outlet, located just opposite "charuchandra college". Though one of the smallest outlet of arambagh I have seen till date but they offer a decent variety comprising of both raw chicken as well as various ready to eat chicken dishes ranging from- CHICKEN TANDOORI, TIKKA KABAK, RESHMI KABAB, TENGRI KABAB, CHICKEN SANDWICH, CHICKEN CUTLET, CHICKEN KABIRAJI CUTLET, WING STRIPS, KATI KABAB, MEXICAN WRAP, CHICKEN SAMOSA WHOLE CHICKEN ROAST/TANDOORI, FRIED CHICKEN WINGS, FRIED CHICKEN BREAST etc;. Being a lover of arambagh's products and thanks to its easily accessible location I visit this outlet regularly and have tried almost every items. The staff managing this outlet is very courteous and answers to all the queries with utmost dedication. Till date all the items I have tasted from this joint were fresh(thanks to the enormous amount of foothfall it receives) and of course succumbing.
Nowadays "Arambagh's Chicken" are offering lucrative Buy 1 Get 1 promotional offer on their range of ready to eat kababs and all on alternative weekends; which kind of came as a blessing to the lover of chicken...

Arambagh's Chicken-the tune of 'Arambager taja, murgir moja' still plays on my mind whenever I go to their outlets.
Location- Behind Lake Mall and on the opposite side of Charuchandra College.
This outlet was a discovery of my girl. I decided to visit one day as I was very hungry after a long tiring day at tutions.... Ambience is okayish. This is a very small store, the store is clean and well managed. They sell both raw meats as well as processed foods. Now coming to the food part, they have got a wide array of foods. I love their chicken wing strips. They are soft and juicy. Yummmyy!!! Their kati kebab is good but personally I think that it is a bit dry. Their quarter chicken tandoori is awesome. I love it. The meat is tender, soft, and juicy. It can satiate someone's hunger big time. They also sell cold drinks. All in all,a nice outlet. I will surely visit this place again and again.
