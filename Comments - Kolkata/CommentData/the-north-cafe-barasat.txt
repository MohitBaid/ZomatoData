I went there several times as it's so close to my place. One day they saved me horrible soup. It smelled so bad neither me nor my friend could drink even a spoon of it. Today they served me a burger with a rotten lettuce inside it. If you are going for only friend or grilled chicken then it's fine I won't recommend ordering anything else. Then the chef started arguing with me that the lettuce is fine and I don't know about food

An average experience overall, very helpful staff, cards are accepted. Sitting area is big, but somehow i felt it dimly lit or the wall color's had an adverse effect on the overall lighting. Located in the road adjacent to hdfc bank in chowmatha madhyamgam. Had grilled chiken and nuggets. Grilled chicken was ok, ofcourse nothing to boast about, there were no grill marks, just burnt roast patch. Nuggets were ok too. I don't think they make their in-house nuggets. The quality of chicken needs to be improved. But it's sort of fine for the pricing. More and more of this local fast food, fried chicken n snacks outlets are opening across the city and they are in the same league, try something new. .also as another person pointed out, don't use broaster chicken name because any foodbud would understand the chicken is not broasted chicken. Broasted chicken is cooking chicken using pressure fryer.

Best place in Madhyamgram to hangout with friends and family.The quality of snacks and food can give the top cafes a run for money.The price is also reasonable .The dish named chicken wings is a must buy. I personally liked the combo chicken meals rather than the hakka chicken noodles.
