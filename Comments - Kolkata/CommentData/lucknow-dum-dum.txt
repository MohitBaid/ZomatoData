Another Biryani joint on dumdum road. got a parcel for my wife few days back, one mutton biryani with egg cost 110 rupees. this joint mostly runs on takeaway as no proper seating arrangement is available. The quality of the rice and mutton was nice but the quantity I believe not enough for a big foodie person.

Being a small shop on Dum Dum road, it's a pretty average restaurant. I have tried out their biriyani and there is nothing noteworthy to mention about it. Good thing Is the quantity. You can try them out if you are looking for average food at a low price.

It is located near private road. The food used to be good at one point of time ,but now it's just okay given the price. The chaap is below average . Try it only if you have nothing else left.

Lucknow is the regular eating joint over here thronged by almost all class of people. When they had opened they used to serve okay biryani given the price , but things have turned a little bad as they have started getting competition from different biryani shops springing all around them. The chaap i had was full of used oil and charmogoz as it gave me a very bad burp. Don't order unless you have no other choice.

Had their mutton biryani and chicken chaap as was feeling too lazy to cook two days back. The biryani was stale as smell was coming from the food. Most possibly the meat had gone bad making the rice smell . Secondly the chicken chap was not at all good in taste and was full of oil and charmogoj. Not worth the money at all.

A roadside Roti, Tarka, Bhat, Dal & Sabji shop that has started to sell Biriyani just to add little more variety to their customers. The restaurant is totally on open road, so the Biriyani & Chaap faces all the dust & pollution of Dum Dum Road. Better not to expect hygienic, healthy foods from here. The restaurant have no decoration, neither it is maintained, It smells fishy & you will definitely not love to sit on the dusty benches over there to have your meal. Better to parcel the food & take away. Coming to the food, Although the Biriyani & all the dishes are pretty less expensive, still the quality is not up to the mark even to justify that price. They provide Biriyani with boiled egg & boiled potato & it looks very spicy & oily. Although the rice of the Biriyani tastes good but the chicken or mutton inside it is the worst part. Chicken or mutton of the biriyani is very hard & totally tasteless. As because of poor sales of the restaurant they can even pile yesterdays chicken or mutton with the biriyani. The same thing applies to their Chicken or Mutton Chaaps too.
Conclusion : If you are very hungry & you don't have any options left, then go ahead with their Egg Alu Biriyani that will be the best value for meal. But never try their Chicken or Mutton dishes.

On DumDum road again just after Private Road, this place serves one of the worst Biryani's and other dishes are not that good either. With zero decor and roadside pollutants, this place is not safe health wise as well. Their kitchen and the back side are just...ummmm..don't know. Only good thing? Serves you fast but then again cold stuff at times.

Please don't come. Ever.
