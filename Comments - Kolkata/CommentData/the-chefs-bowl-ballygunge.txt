When it comes to eating at the food court of a mall, people are always a little scared. The food is never up to the mark, event at the best malls. However, the case is not the same when it comes to Quest Mall. I have always thought that its food court is better than its counterparts at other malls in Kolkata. And now with The Chef's Bowl, this thought of mine has been reestablished.
This counter has a whole new approach to serving food. Their concept involved a whole meal in a bowl. It's quite different from the way we usually dine - a plateful of breads or rice with several katoris of sides. Instead, this is much like how the Japanese dine, with a complete, wholesome meal in a single bowl. You get to pick your own combination of carbs, sides, salads, pickles, etc. You can pick from their suggested combos, or try your own.
It's not just the concept that's impressive, but the food, too. I love their Garlic Rice Bowl with Mutton with brown onion, the Red Glow Bowl with Peppery Prawn, the Quinoa Bowl with Harissa Grilled Chicken, and the Asian Bowl with Chilli  Chicken, with the quinoa and the Asian bowls being my favourites.I also loved the veg bowl of dosa waffle, in which Waffles are served in place of dosa with sambhar, coconut chutney, etc, and you event get the option to turn it non-veg! 
They also have amazing options for appetisers and dessert, as well as beverages.
What's incredible is that it's a filling bowl of complete meal. I don't think an average eater can finish the bowl. And starting at just Rs. 240, it's really worth the price, in terms of quality and quantity.
To sum it up, I suggest you give The Chef's Bowl  chance. You won't be complaining about mall food anymore, I think.

The new addition to Quest mall food court is the chef's bowl. It is situated where Au bon pain used to be. We are not used to having rice bowls in kolkata because Thaalis sell here more. The chefs bowl introduced quite an amazing concept of make your own bowl where one has the choice of selecting desired option for grains. carbs, proteins, salads and pickles. Tending to both the Vegetarian and non vegetarian crowd they also offer healthy options for the health conscious folks. Quinoa instead of rice can be easily availed as the grain. The proteins contain options of paneer, mutton,chicken and prawns. The salad and pickles come is various options. Besides bowl they also have good starters and desserts along with great soda mocktails.

The 1st stop of the food court of quest..that catches your vision with the colorful bowls.. staffs are pretty good and fast!! ordered the garlic rice bowl with an add on of harissa chicken.It took less than a minute to get the food after the billing.
Now the bowl had salads which tasted amazing,sour cream and nachos which was perfect,the spiced and fried potatoes that was good too,the garlic rice which was a bit disappointing as it lacked the garlic flavor.now the harrisa chkn served on the bowl were 3huge chunks with sauced up in something green which was pretty decent to taste but lacked tenderness.
Pocket pinch 336(inclusive of all)
PS.its super filling and a single bowl goes pretty good for more than one person

This new joint is great and i visited it recently for lunch. It was crowded. But what indulgent choices to choose from. Feast for the senses. 
I had a garlic rice bowl with mutton with brown onions and it was amazing. The mutton with brown onions reminded me of the mutton roganjosh from Kashmir and was so succulent. The starter i chise was lemongrass chicken on sugarcane stick. It was juicy and the sugarcane stick gave an aming sweetness to the spicy chicken which was very delicately flavoured with lemongrass.
For dessert i had a gulab jamun cheesecake! It was so yummy that i just gobbled it up so that i dont hv to share it with anyone. Hence forgot to click pics as i was buzy stuffing myself with the GJ cheesecake.

Matter of concern of this new restaurant is of service and behaviour of thier staff which is matter of concern visited today evening 21:40 hrs ordered for food was overcharged on reading the bill when informed the person in billing counter he tried to ignore the issue and made me stand for 10 minutes and then returned me the excess charged amount but my ordeal does not end here when I went to collect the food I was made to wait for 15 mins and when I protested I was given something different than what I had ordered when I informed that Mr Raj Majhi the staff misbehaved with me threatened me with unacceptable language and told me to take back my money and leave the place he threatened me with dire consequences further on to my retaliation and protest and when security staff of mall arrived then he changed his stance and delivered me the food. Sir to my surprise there was no manager to take my complain one guy called sumanta who was in bill counter claimed to be the manager . Please train your staff to behave with customer properly as your staff behaviour had spoiled my visit to mall and restaurant with family and experience was very bad . Hope you people will take nessecary actions .

Oh my god! The ordering process is pretty indulging and pleasant. You get to choose whatever you want. Ive been there only twice as its opened recently but the food was amazing! I absolutely loved it. We ordered the Asian bowl with chilli chicken as the protein and an appetiser of bloodymary chicken. Both were amazing! Loved every bit, but one downside is that they microwaved the appetiser which made the chicken a little dry. Thats it. Cheers :D
