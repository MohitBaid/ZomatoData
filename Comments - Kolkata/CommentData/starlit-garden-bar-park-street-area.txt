Pathetic service and very rude behaviour.

The food we ordered were not served and whatever was served was something else.

I will not recommend this place to anyone..!!!

They certainly deserve a zero rating. 

I went to this pathetic place yesterday with a couple of friends. The staffs misbehaved with us.  At first place,  they served us wrong dish.  When asked to change the dish, they cancelled the order and completely disagreed to change the dish.  They said "Ab Khana nai milega" and it was only 9.45 pm. Hence,  we had to go to some other place to complete our dinner.

I wanted to give it 0.0 rating.

The service and behavior of staff and waiters was pathetic. They serve wrong food most of the time and don't care to change the items as well.

Because of such behavior, we don't see people coming here.

Very bad experience I would say...!!!

judging by the quality and the price together this place is quite sorted when it comes to the food and the draught beer they serve at the reasonable rate.. ............... going to visit again as I can get the large quantity of food which I generally need with the liquor I generally consume...

It was happy surprise for me. My office being at park street, I have been to various resto-bars around the area. But never spotted this place. Its situated jst beside Mouline Rouge, a tiny entrance, no name boards nothing. Small but fairly decorated place. We had Whisky, Chicken Tikka and Mutton Kosha dry. I learnt that its a part of Mouline Rouge itself and their kichen is same but with lower prices. Both Chicken Tikka n Mutton Kasha Dry were excellent. Specially the mutton was superb, soft boneless pieces. The best thing is that its so cheap compared to others in Park Street. The menu is short, very selected items are available. Will surely visit again.

Ambience:3/5
Service:3.5/5
Quantity:4/5
Quality:4.5/5
Value For Money:5/5

Overall:4/5

PS. Its an only for men place.

Good serving and prices are minimal.  You should have a round to this bar. But they need to upgrade their stock. No brezzer were presrnt when we have asked them

This is one of the lesser expensive and lesser known bars in the area. Well, understandably I felt. The food is okay and nothing much to talk about. Service is quick, staff is well behaved. The dry chilli chicken however was pathetic. Didnt feel like eating much after it. For my take, its a place where you can hang out if all other bars in Park Street are packed. Seriously nothing notable worth mentioning.

The fish kebab and the chilly chicken are worth the money one pays for and one's taste. I have had the fish kebabs once and now the chilly chicken. Both r good and plateful.  The staff r helpful and suggests what's the best.

walking down from trinca down till ra kidwai crossing one comes across an arraay  of pubs. we thought of meeting here which we thought that we had tried but memory could not support this thought. its a good post office sit out. 
there is a reddish tinge across the bar / more because of the looming red lights over the table.food is just right and goes well with the teacher s that one takes.
the best part  is when the bill comes - you feel there is no better VFM than this.
