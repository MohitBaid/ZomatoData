VR1 is turning out to be a new hotspot for young people like us as the new owners of the cafe are taking it to a whole new level.
The ambience, the decor, the comfort seating arrangements and the friendly behavior of the staff and the owners takes this cafe to a whole new level in terms of hospitality.
They have a collection of more than 40 hookah flavours and trust me their hookah is way better than what is being currently served in most of the shisha cafes in Kolkata.
The new food menu is vast, ranging from continental and italian to even chinese, giving a lot of options to choose from. Now coming to the food, starting from the taste to the presentation everything is 5/5. It's really a great treat for your taste buds and the best part, it's pocket-friendly.
This cafe serves so much under a decent price tag compared to all the other cafes in Kolkata.
This cafe is also good for throwing a private party or a birthday party as they have all the necessary requirements to fullfill your specific demands.
People who haven't tried this cafe must go and try it now. Trust me you will discover the undiscovered.

A cafe near JD park metro VR1 or We Are One is immensely popular among the young crowd owing to it’s Uber cool ambiance, wide variety of food and most importantly flavored Sisha. The ambiance complete with giant screens, comfy sitting arrangement and classy music makes it all the more amazing for a hangout with friends.As if all of this is yet not satisfactory to provide an impetus to check this place out the pricing is pretty decent. The cafe serves mostly Mexican, Chinese, Italian and  Continental dishes. Team Panchphoron was invited over to taste the items in their menu and here’s what we tried-

This place is somewhat good. It is a hookah parlour basically, but they also serve starters, mocktails and milkshakes. There have a good collection of music. I really liked the ambience and decor. But, the place is a bit suffocating because of the smoke of hookah.

Coming to the food part -
We ordered - crispy chilli baby corn and chocolate chrunchy milkshake. It was more or less good. Not so happening. They need to work more for their preparations.

The staffs were very polite and friendly. The cafe is pocket friendly, so one can give it a try.

Ambiance was nice and cozy, dim light set the mood, had cozy bed type sofas to relax on and mainly most of them visited it to grab hookah and alcohol and apart from that they preapre good dishes though it take time to manage and serve the crowd on occasional days, had chicken hakka chowmin its totally different from others I had it, cheese garlic toast, lamb hariyali, red Bull and coke. They take great care to all who visit the place.

All of us love to hang around with our friends. And this Christmas time it adds a bit more fun to hang around. This time Winter has arrived to the city a little late. Anyways, that couldn’t stop my foodie mind from tasting food. One evening me along with my fellow foodie mates of team Panch Phoron went to VR1. This place is near to Hazra Crossing.

Shisha lovers add one more option to your list as this place's popularity is growing like wildfire. The reason is first shisha but worth mentioning are the food they serve and the staff's courteous behaviour.
Live sports screening with liit music are perfect to set the ambience, and it can't go wrong if you have good options of food  to be served.
Team panchphoron went to try their signature dishes alongside shisha which were,
•Crispy Babycorn
•Soya Honey Chicken
•Mix Sauce Spaghetti
•Fried rice
•Grilled Chicken with Paprika sauce
•Double Shades Mocktail
•Paan Mojito
The spaghetti & the grilled chicken are worth trying. The shisha was also prepared rightly which set up the mood for the groove. Prices are set keeping in mind the youth crowd. A must go for those who loves to party, visiting in a group is advisable in order to enjoy more.
P.S.: Non smokers or people having problem with smokes might find it a lil claustrophobic.

VR1 or We are One is a Hookah Cafe near to Hazra Crossing, opposite to Paramount Nursing home.
It is a happening place for the young crowd. The friendly ambience, catchy graffiti, cool music & comfortable seating will make you feel like a perfect adda zone. They had a very big screen TV for screening live matches.

I had a chance to try their most popular dishes like:

Mocktails
1. Paan Mojito
2. Double Shades

Starters
1. Crispy Veg
2. Soya Honey Chicken
3. Chicken Satay Sticks (great in taste)

Main course:
1. Mixed sauce spaghetti
2. Grilled chicken with paprika sauce
3. Fried Rice

Hookah:
1. Paanch Paan (one of the smoothest hookah)
2. Orange Rajni
3. Elaichi Mint

I felt that place is too smoky, they need to arrange proper ventilation. Some non-smoker also can come to the place to enjoy with friends.

We dropped in with a few friends just to have a Hookah and relax a little . As soon as we entered this lounge on the first floor we were a bit skeptical of going in . The whole place was engulfed in hookah smoke and seemed like there's no ventilation at all . But we decided to hang around for an hour . 
We ordered a couple of sheesha , a Brain Freezer and a Paan Rasna . Both of them were strictly average . We opted for some food . The crispy Babycorn was good . Next we had the veg club Sandwich which was filling . But my favourite was the Jalapeño cheese balls . Cheesy and had the perfect dip to go with . 

Service is a bit slow , they need to work on it to make sure customers don't get irritated . 

Food : 4/5 
Ambience : 2/5 
Hookah : 3/5 
Service :3/5

Poor service... Have been here 4 times. 3 out of those 4 times they got my hookah order wrong.. couldn't provide me glass with ice. No chilled hookah pipe..! Had to wait a lot to give or complain about any order .. no proper ventilation .. room is full of smoke ... Today I ordered for white sauce paste came after 20 mins to sell me off Mexican rice. So when we said no had to wait 20 more mins

May be this is the first time I'm reviewing some restraunt with 5 stars...and there are reasons
First things first..
1.Awesome ambience
2. Staff behaviour super friendly
3. Pocket pinch is very low
Ok...so here I went about 2 days before with two of my friends in the afternoon in the mood of some Hookah and good food. 

Location : this place is at 5 minutes walking distance from Jatin das park metro,very easy to locate.

Decor and ambience: this is quite a small place with few seating arrangements at the 1st floor. There are some comfortable enough sofas with so many cushions and also a bed like seating arrangement. They always play loud music and a dizzy light spread all over...kinda night club like feel. One can easily seat comfortably for as long as they want to and people can even lie. There's a tv where always live sports screening is happening... overall liked a lot.
 
Food and Hookah : we ordered brainfrizzer mint flavour that was kind a good choice and had one time charcoal exchange that was good enough fir 3 of us. The coal exchange costs 29 rupees.
We ordered a Chef's special nonveg pizza and one plate chicken cheese fries...both were amazing in taste.
The 🍕 pizza crust was a bit crispy..loaded with toppings and layers of cheese...far better than leading brands like Domino's.
The cheese chicken fries were heavenly good... perfectly fried and went good with the cheese dip.For all of these the pocket pinch was 800 rupees.

Now, something that was very impressive was their staff behaviour...they behave like you go there everyday and they know you well... sitting back here for 2-3 hours enjoying some Hookah over a hangout with friends will be perfect,kinda feels like family.
I'd love to visit here again and again

"VR1" a descent and affordable hookah parlour.
Let's talk about the ambience first -
       A  average ambience with overall nice seat arrangement...though the music played was much loud.......
Not only hookah u can also have beer if u want...that is available in can only....and it cost around 160/-...and the price of hookah was 299/-(excluding GST)...and during this durga puja festive they increased the price of hookah for 470/- and the can comes for around 250/-...

I don't want to comment on their food because we haven't tasted that.....the waiters were cordial and helpful.....
If u are in hazra area and craving for hookah then u can have a visit to this place....
At last from my personal view i would rather say there are many more hookah parlours in the city which have better ambience than this....

This is one of my most favorite cafe's. Everything here may be ordinary, but when you connect with so many others, the time spent here becomes so cherishable it becomes extraordinary. VR1 gives me immense happiness when I am alone or with a group of pals. The things that I love about this place is its staff, the superb service and food. Ever since I have been there, I feel like visiting this place again, it is pocket pinchy too. Keep spreading the aroma of love.

*The best thing about this restaurant is its lazy and cozy environment. Though small, it will capture your attention. 

*Two things I didn't liked : I was sitting under the a.c and water was dropping. The music is also loud.

*Service is good : The staff is friendly. They listen to you.They even clicked picture of my group.

*Food is average : I ordered Four cheese pizza, Chicken chamula and hukka and they were not bad. 

*Budget friendly : I bought three items (including tax) in Rs.750

Although a relatively small cafe/hookah bar, the ambience is quite clean. I have been to the place a number of times with my friends as well as for sports screenings. Of all the items that I've had, crispy chilly babycorn was one which stood out. The pieces were soft and tender and the spice was up to the mark. Since the place is a little cramped and not many people can fit together at once, you need to adjust. Overall, I'd a say a fairly decent place to hang out with friends and it's pocket friendly as well.

Been here for two match screenings . The place is nice to hang up with friends but a bit small for screenings , the food is good especially the chicken noodles and the grilled chicken sandwich . People can also try the Kit Kat shake !!The place is dark and the interiors are cool and the atmosphere was good and plays loud music too . 
The most attractive thing about this place are the neon blue lights .
It's good to hang out here with friends but never with family or alone .

We could try sone common dishes only. Once again, it's a cool place to hangout with friends but never try alone or with family. ;)

Went here for the Chelsea Utd screening. Must say the atmosphere during the match was just amazing.
Art work on the wall will take you back to the 90s.
Stayed back post screening for dinner.

Quality of the food was good. Had veg panfried noodles, wouldve loved it the gravy was a wee bit more spicy and less gelatinous. Friends had chicken pasta and chilli garlic chicken noodle. Both were good. Portion size was VERY good. 

Smooth hukkah, prompt coal change. 
All for a bill that is a treat to the eyes.

I have been on a search for the perfect hookah lounge for YEARS I'm telling you YEARS and I finally found it at this establishment. 
Friendliest and most grateful staffs I have ever spoken to, great team-style service, and amazing atmosphere. 
We waited for about 15 min for a table but the staffs was consistently letting us know and keeping us updated on the wait "thank you so much for waiting, we appreciate your patience, another 5 minutes". I love that! That's all I need to placate me while I wait to get inside, more than, actually.
Once inside, we never really had to wait for anything, there were multiple servers checking up on us and everything came out in a timely manner, and everyone was so nice! Not at all the superficial service I was expecting from a hookah lounge, as I usually get horrible service at every other one I've been to. 
The hookah was amazing, great smoke and it came out faster than I've ever had at a hookah lounge before. 
The thene was perfect both inside and out. The patio was warm and cozy, while inside had great mood lighting and a little bit more intimate. The music was bumping, (much louder inside than outside), the atmosphere was electric yet comfortable. I have nothing but positive things to say about this establishment.

This is a very nice place to hangout with friends and smoke some good hookah. The decoration is very nice and gives you a very good feeling. I liked this place very much, however we visited this place during Durga Puja and had two hookahs and they let us enjoy the hookahs for only an hour even when we asked for coal change (which has extra charged). They said that it is their policy only for Durga puja but there was a lot of empty spaces around and no one was waiting outside because of us. Anyway, so to stay half an hour more we ordered two plates of Chicken Cheese Finger but it took an hour to be prepared when there was no rush for food in the cafe. Also the food was served cold and not at all good.

Let me start with the seating arrangement..it is way too comfortable and relaxing..hookah was good..The best part-staff is real swift and you can ask them to play songs of your choice.The only regret is we had to choose from very selected menu of drinks and food as it was durga puja and kitchen was customized to manage the crowd. We look forward to trying out different dishes once we are back at this palce. Overall a pretty, happy.

P.S -The wall decor is really really quirky and offers amazing background to your pictures

The food is actually tasty. We ordered Chicken Chamula, Chicken Hakka noodles and oreo shake. Chicken Chamula is highly recommended.
Price is moderate.
The music is too loud.

I visited this restaurant today by chance. It has a lovely uber decor. Great place to hang out with your friends. Be cautious, this place is a hookah bar and not for people who do not like the smell of it. (But then, who doesn't love the smell of hookah). Not having much time nor money, my friend and I ordered just plate of Chese Wai Wai. It tasted good, which made me make a metal note to come to this place again. Once again the place is uber cool to hangout especially during footable fever.

This place is situated bang opposite to the Paramount Nursing Home in Hazra and is a new addition to the list of Hookah bars we have in town. I visited the place as a guest when VR1 hosted a Manchester derby Premiership screening two weeks back and looked more like a stadium than a hookah joint for a couple of hours. It's perfect for a weekend hangout and football fanatics are bound to love this place.

What I ate mostly comprised of starters since there was barely any time or space to explore their menu, precisely Crispy Babycorn and Dry Chilli Chicken, both of which tasted good. Hookah was neat and the Litchi and Peach fizz were well prepared.  
Hoping to hit the place as a casual visitor to explore more of the menu soon.

The place not at all difficult to locate.First look at the place gives it a feeling of a typical cafe cum hookah parlour with dark lighting,wall paintings. The music playing is mostly EDM type music with very limited choices.The place is actually small,slight cramped up.seatings are comfy.Service is good and pricing is very much affordable. But a turn off was the time taken to arrive with food.expected shorter wait time. We ordered mozzarella cheese fingers,Thai ginger chicken,chicken fingers,pesto sauce pasta,four cheese pizza,virgin mojito,blue lagoon,masala coke,fresh lime soda,doodh cola and Pan flavoured hookah..all tasted good except the pizza..It was a turn off.. All over an average experience

Great place to be with a group of friends! One of our office parties was held here yesterday. We had booked the entire place and stayed past 10 pm. Good food, great music and a very well maintained customer service. The boys took good care of the entire group of 20 or more till 11pm. The place is clean and spacious enough to shake your feet. Though a core hokaah parlour, there has been no compromise with the food and drinks. Seating area is fine, as you get to stretch your legs and may be lie down and enjoy the ambience. Even though not a hokaah parlour fan, I did have a great time and look forward to visit soon.
P.S. Location is very convenient, walking distance from Hazra mor.

Location : From Hazra more, enter the road which takes you towards Lansdowne, after a few minutes you'll meter Paramount Hospital. This café is bang opposite to the hospital.

This is kind of a flat turned into a cafe. The garage and the walls are all quirkily painted and stuff written on them. Climb the stairs and you'll find yourself inside the cafe. 

The place is a bit shady, however the sitting arrangements are quite comfy and relaxing. 

We ordered :

Chicken chamula : 6 pieces of chicken along with a chutney was served. This kebab was good.

Double cheese pizza : The pizza was absolutely disgusting. The smell was crappy, base of the pizza was like biscuit and it had no flavour. Bad quality of cheese used.

Chicken gravy noodles : Absolutely bland and hardly had chicken pieces in if. The gravy was super gelatinous as you can see in the pictures. No flavour whatsoever.

Mixed sauce pasta: I liked the pasta. Surprisingly, the cheese used in here was good.

A glass of coke.

Hookah was nice and smooth and coal change was very cheap was well.

Service was very good and the staff is very courteous!

They charge just 5.7% service tax and pocket pinch is on the lower side!

One of the main thing that attracted me is the ambiance. I loved the design of the walls as well. But , sorry to say , the collection of songs was not that much good. Let's come to the cuisine part , the quality of the food was too good.we took kiwi mocktail, strawberry shake, ginger chicken and white sauce pasta. Each and every dish was mouthwatering and I had a wonderful eve over there.I would like to visit over again.

VR1 is an "up-to-the-minute" latest additions to the trendiest Hookah parlours in town with the ingenuity of Music café which is another new vogue of Kolkata!
Placed along the Hazra road opposite to Paramount Clinic this cafe can house around twenty people arbitrarily, with the quirkiest theme around and with those droopy uptown blue lights, the place has an exhilarating ambience of it's own. That large giant flat screen will surely struck eyes with the lead pops flashing in there.
Known for it's intriguing urban street wall art in the mezzanine floor, this section draws much attention of customers, PS: we clicked quite a number of pictures in there!
Coming to food:
We went for :
• Chicken Chamula : This one was a tasty dry chill chicken type preparation although with a different thin batter coating. Major recommendations in this one.
• Red sauce chicken pasta : this one tasted a lil weird with excessive chilli flakes, and spices in it, thus Indian flavour overpowered over the Italian dish.
• Dudh Cola : Hands down, what a perfect combination of milk n cola as well as tasting superb.
• Cola Float : Enough froth for a single glass, happy to order this one.
.

Waiters are prompt and amicable, service is fast. They leave no page unturned to make you feel hospitable.
Be it ambience or decor or food or service, this place scores a consistent rise in every aspect. Surely coming back to this den for more.
.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 👑

Went there for a screening on behalf of Arsenal Bengal Club..Descent ambiance and beautifully decorated walls...Music was pumping...It was crowdy that day cuz it was a joint screening going on over there...Anyways good place to hangout with ur mates..Had Crispy chilly babycorn with some drinks and i felt it was delicious ... Space is on the smaller side..Good for a changeover...Hookah and large screening are an added advantage..Overall good experience !!

A cozy place located on hazra road. The ambience is good with all those neon sticker trying to funk it up. 
The theme takes you back to you school with all those stickers indicating the Golden high school period of your life. 
The hookah at this place is decent and the food is too!
We ordered a chicken satay and it was cooked well with right amount of flavours there! 
All in all it was a nice experience!

Teenagehood revisited. Those neon wall stickers, blue lights, catchy music and comfy sitting arrangements make this place nothing short of a party hub.The inclusion of neon in the walls breaks the monotonousness found in any other cafe of the like genre. Coming to the food now
Its worth every penny that you pay.
Among the big bites:
The chicken burger was an absolute treat for my taste buds, served with a side of crunchy French fries.
The pizza had a thin crust and had a perfect blend of flavors.
I would want to recommend a drink "Dudh cola" which is a blend of milk and Cola. # caution # only try this if you don't mind opening up to new flavors.
A big thumbs up, if you ask me.
Definitely the place that youngsters would want to be at.

No matter how much we grow up, behind every suited booted person, there is a child residing within which often peeps in the mind and take us back to those nostalgic childhood fun and memoirs, which is a very prized possession that we keep in store.
But giving a shape to that concept is something really worth appreciating and genuinely a task that needs talent.

So far I remember a quote from one of the professors from UWSB, Mrs. Mahua Dutta that "The Best Talents Are Always Found At The Back Benches Of Any Class", with reference to that context the charming young gentleman Mr.

Lively and well decorated. The graffiti on the walls are catchy. Definitely a work of the "back bench minds".
The ambience is perfect for a hookah parlour with the right lighting and music to add to the mood.
The food and mocktails are amazing. The baby corn and the blue lagoon are worth trying.
It is a perfect combination of food, hookah and ambience. Definitely a must visit.
