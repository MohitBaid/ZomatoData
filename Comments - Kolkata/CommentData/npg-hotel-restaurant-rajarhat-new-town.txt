This particular restaurant is situated within 200 meters from my home. I haven't visited the place yet but ordered online a few times. North Indian Dishes are really nice . Once I have ordered biriyani from NPG Hotel & Restaurant and trust me that was the worst biriyani I have ever tasted in my life so far... They should change their cook or remove biriyani from their menu.

This place is located 2minutes walk from Chinar Park crossing.
We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Boti Chicken, Raita & Soft Drinks. They served the foods quite fast. Biriyani smelt good but wasn't hot. The chicken pieces in the biriyani were small and full of bones, chickens in the boti chicken weren't fresh. Serving staffs didn't show any professional mannerism and refused to change our cutleries when we requested them to as those were on the table before we entered.

Ambience: No music, moderate light decoration, two TVs were playing old Bollywood movies.

Biriyani- 3.5/5
Moti Chicken- 2.7/5
Raita- 3.5/5

This place is nearby from Chinarpark Crossing.
It is located at 1st floor. The Decoration was good but the ambience was not like that. Place is neat and clean.
We ordered via little in Biriyani, Chicken Kassa and Raita in reasonable price. The taste of quality of Chicken Biriyani was average but quantity was good.
Chicken kosha : taste was good but the two pieces were very small. The raita was good.
So overall, food menu is almost similar to other restaurants and does not have any special taste.
Staff gave food in proper time and also friendly behaviour. But I think they are not quite professional staffs. The service facility definitely needs more improvement.
But the good thing is parking available.

The hospitality and service is very good for the restaurant , but the quality of the food is poor compared to the high rates ! Had ordered a mutton biriyani, which turned out to be undercooked and poor in quality ! Hopefully the quality of the food improves! The staff do an excellent job at serving the guests but the chefs don't match it up ! Disappointed !

Having spent sometime in Delhi, I generally don't like the North Indian food, served in Kolkata, however I would still have it as it is one of the 2 most widely available cuisines. Having said that, you do find yourself in Chinar Park area, your bet will be Arsalan or Aminia. NPG is below par and certainly do not justify the price.

High rates and less quantity with low quality comes with slow maintenance and worst delivery. Ordered twice and they are late always. Most of the times food is not prepared well. Worst experience.

This place looks very good both inside and outside. Stuff members are also polite and well behaved. But there is nothing much to say about the food! Ordered chicken sweet corn soup, chicken hot & sour soup, chicken hariyali kebab, chicken achari kebab, rice, tandoori roti, chicken butter masala and murgh makhani. But nothing was special about the food! It was just OK! We can't even distinguish the taste of two chicken dishes much!

This restaurant is located in between Chinar park and haldirams crossing and will exactly fall on your left as you will see a huge building with silver look and glass fascade decor from outside absolute impressive and an eye catcher .So as it manages to look very elegant i decided to check on what it is like to have a meal here, and headed searching for the gate as i was in a confusion where the entrance was as i saw the security on my left and on my right too but luckily one of them welcomed me and i just rushed in and i was informed as i entered that this restaurant is for room accomadation also so a proper stay place this was , as they have a restaurant on the first floor for in house guests as well as open to all .
                                                                ...

The restaurant is upto the mark. 
The price of the food is a bit costly. 
But the service facility definitely needs some improvement. The ambience is cool, rather perfect with low lighting and all. But above all the main parameter is food and its really good. So you can visit this place without second thoughts. Thank you.

Located close to my home, I found  their Rolls were very good, be it Chicken/Mutton/Egg etc!In fact I always tell them to make it as per my liking, telling them the kind I like! Considering the quality, the price of Rolls is very modest!
Happen to frequently carry the rolls home!
Must try!

I went to this restaurant on valentines day and it was my first time to taste something new. People there welcomed us heartily and suggested to try the buffet menu available for that night. The manager suggested to wait for 15 min for the buffet. We agreed and time went on. We had to wait for nearly 45 minutes to get food on our plates. 
Staffs there were helpful and hearty but lack professionalism. Nothing went on time. 
In the buffet menu there were few dishes available. The real surprise was there when I produced my credit card to pay the bill. Such a big restaurant -at least the decoration and construction gives that idea-  does not have any card payment facility. We had to go out to nearest ATM to withdraw cash. They should have informed their customers about this in some way. When we left the place, we saw a notice on the main door stating "Credit card not accepted". It was not there at the time we entered the restaurant. They could have displayed the paper well before they did. 
So overall, food menu is almost similar to other restaurants and does not have any special taste to test your buds. Place is neat and clean. Workers are friendly but lack professionalism.
