This continental snack parlour beside the south city college in golpark is quite a stunner. They have a range of delicious dishes at an affordable price. From the good old Fish N Chips to the crusted lime infused chicken to the Grilled fish. Every item stands out. I had the Mozzarella Stuffed Chicken, the Crusted Like Infused Chicken and the Grilled Fish this time. The 6 medium pieces of nuggets that came in the crusted lime infused chicken is the absolute winner here with it's delicate taste. The soft and succulent grilled fish (2large pieces) takes the second place and last but not the least is the Mozzarella Stuffed Chicken with a thick piece of chicken fillet stuffed with cheese and coated with breadcrumbs. All this came at a price of 591INR!

Wow. This is a hidden gem. Discovered by my sister. We ordered in. Tried the Fried Fish in mustard sauce. Four big pieces of fish which was sumptuous, it was accompanied by french fries and kasundi mustard sauce. A complete meal for two. Pocket friendly, excellent delivery system. Looking forward to order more. Recommended!! üòÅ

Being a one stop solution to sudden hunger pangs and cravings, amidst the din and bustle of citylife...
Quick service kiosks are perhaps one of the most happening buzzword,  eventually making its way so as to cater to the need of the patrons looking for some quick bite on the go, or to pack some to have on good!

And one such name, doing the perfect justice to the gastronomic calisthenics of 'city of joy' with  'London' style delicacies is surely something one should'nt miss a chance to give a go...üòÉ

Yes, "Appetiso" is the name we are talking about!!

Amidst the delectable offerings they have in their menu.... the must try ones include 'Fried Fish in Mustard Sauce', 'Chicken Finger with Tartare Sauce', 'Crusted Chicken(Lime infused) with Honey Mustard Sauce' while the showstopper of the list turns out to be the "GOOD OLE' FISH N CHIPS WITH TARTARE SAUCE" and "STUFFED CHICKEN MOZARELLA"!! üòÉüòÉ

The 'Golpark' outlet being the one with major footfalls, they have another branch at 'Kasba' as well, @ '74 Rajdanga, near Triborno Bus Stop'

Sounds Yummy??!! üòÉ

Walk in and grab your bite at 'Appetiso' to pamper your tastebuds üòÉ

Happy Eating! üòä

It's still pretty difficult to find places where you'd get authentic English dishes. Appetisto is a brand new outlet at Golpark who serve authentic English snacks with the tag " a taste from London ". 
Located right in the lane beside Nonni, it's a cute little food joint with a QSR concept, seating not available but provide stools if required. With good hygiene and courteous staff appetisto is essentially my choice for English taste. 
Trying their food, must tries are: 
Their signature dish good ole' fish n chips. As the name suggests, it's basa fish fries in English dressing and served with hot chips, they serve you with a lemon so as to use it according to your requirement.and not to forget there's this lovely tartare dip! 

Crumb fried chicken with lemon infused is my favorite! With chicken breasts deep fried in panco breadcrumbs and the hit of lemon is deciduously refreshing. The dip is cheesy and tastes pretty good with the chicken and there's chips too. Icing on the cake. Yay! 

Cottage cheese fingers are a must for vegetarians, I'm sure non vegetarians would love it too! Fresh cottage cheese and herbs friend with golden brown crust and served hot with crisp potato wedges. 

And there's something to make us Bengali happy! Mustard fish fry with KASHUNDI or Mustard dip. Bhetki fish is a delicacy in Bengali cuisine and is famous for used as fillets in fish fry, chilly fish and all. The fry had a touch of bengal and a reunion of London and Bengal. Served with crisp potato wedges, it'd lift your tastebuds and mood for sure. 

Try them all! 


Cheers to team Appetisto! 

Thanks,
Pocket Full Of Flavours.

So after hearing a lot about this place I finally decided to try it out. I was both impressed and disappointed. 
Firstly , I tried the fish and chips and my oh my they were amazing. The fish was tender and the coating was absolutely delicious. It was served with a lemon wedge and fries tossed in red chilli flakes. The tartare sauce served with it as sour and creamy. 
I also ordered the crusted chicken. While the crust was good , as it had lemongrass and cornflakes in it , the chicken was super chewy and just impossible to eat. I also noted the coating and realised that it had been BURNT. I don‚Äôt know what restaurant even has the audacity to serve burnt food to their customers , shows very little about their customer service. This was the disappointing factor. I was served burnt food. 
The only reason I‚Äôve rated this place a 3 is for their packaging and the fish and chips. Really upset with their crusted chicken. It could have been a good dish , owing to the little bit of the good , unburnt taste I got from it , but as a whole , it had to be wasted because it was inedible. I hope the management looks into the matter.

This newly opened quick service restaurant, currently at Golpark and Rajdanga, promises to deliver authentic London-style Fish and chips at pocket friendly pricing. Though not elaborate, their menu also has some delicious chicken and fish options to choose from.

I had been to their Golpark outlet (take the lane by Noni jewellery) recently. The Fish and chips deserves a special mention for not only the right balance of flakiness, succulence and crispiness but also for the actual quantity of fish that was there. Amongst the other items in the menu the crusted chicken and the grilled fish are a must try.

So the next time you are craving for some wholesome munchies for those evening hunger pangs go visit Appetiso.

Located in the same lane as South City College, Appetiso is a great place for people who love to bite into Fish snacks. Their Fish and Chips are crunchy outside, and beautifully soft inside. The fish fries with kasundi also satisfied this Bengali soul. As for the lemon butter fish, the accompanying sauce could have been better. Their packaging is decent too, and I will be going back here for my fill of snacks on the go, soon!

It is a food brand owned by Food Xpress, Kolkata and has their takeaway counters in Golpark,Rajdanga and HORECO Sector.Fish and Chips is an all time favourite and Appetiso indeed makes one of the best fish n chips that i have tried.With the nip in the air already a good fish n chips would be your best companion.Appetiso provides take away or home delivery through popular food delivery platform.Other than Fish N Chips they also have some great chicken dishes.The Lemon Butter fish is also a must try.Appetiso is definitely the place to get your fish n chips on the go or to even host your bunch of friends at home with good drinks and the great quality Fish N Chips,London Style.

Appetiso is a new takeaway restaurant in Kolkata which has an interesting menu that reminds me of London. It has the good ol Fish n Chips and a whole variety of dishes that you would not ordinarily be able to order in at home.
I ordered Fried Fish with Mustard Sauce , Stuffed Chicken Mozzarella and Mushroom Bomb from the Kasba outlet. This was an online order. The delivery was prompt and all items were hot.
All dishes tasted wonderful and it was great value for money. The portions are large, accompanied by potato wedges and the sauce of your choice.
The packaging was interesting and esoteric.
I would highly recommend Appetiso as an option, for not just dinner, but also as starters and appetizers for a party. The finger food would most likely be popular among children too....
My only recommendation would be to, maybe, add some soft drinks to the menu.

Being a fish N chips and beer girl, I decided its time that I try this new joint. I have been getting some really good reviews of this place.I had ordered Fish and chips, Crusted chicken and Fish finger.The fish and chips were a bit too salty but the rest of them were delicious.Also, the price is a tad bit too much for my taste.If they want to charge 235 (excluding the tax) for 3pcs of Fish and chips they better make their food worth it.
Dissatisfied.

Fish and chips is the most popular food of London and is now available at Kolkata, thanks to Appetiso! Just back from London, I do relate the similarity in taste and quality. I tried four items from the menu, which included Veg Cutlets, Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce, Lemon infused chicken and the Fish‚Äôn Chips. The veg cutlets were crisp and fresh, with perfectly spiced cottage cheese. The grilled fish tasted good along with the mashed potato, but a little bit more focus on the presentation would be good. The lemon infused chicken was crunchy along with a mustard dip, it was quite filling and I would recommend it. Lastly the main attraction was the Fish‚Äôn Chips, tasted delicious, it was served with tarter dip, lime and was accompanied by potato wedges. A must have and would highly recommend it.

Experience the taste of London in Kolkata, at Golpark. Snugly situated beside Chandas Khaukswey, this was is a new addition. No seating arrangements given its a QSR, however, on a crowded they do arrange for temporary stools and table!

Crisp compact meenu, so complications. Everything is available. The not so fish lovers can dig into the chicken bit and vice versa.

We tried their lemon infused chicken - nice crunches, bite sized portions with a mustard dip. They don't just promise the lime bit, it is actually present!

Fish n Chips - You MUST, must, must try this. Their signature dish - served with a tartar dip and potato wedges. They use Basa, hence the fish. when you tear apart is pristine white, not rubbery but yumm!

¬†Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter sauce - I'll be honest, have tasted better! The fish is grilled and served separately while the sauce is served in a smaller container. The sauce is a little runny, hence, instead of pouring it, you kinda dip into the sauce and gobble your fish.

Veg Cutlets - Crisp fried cottage cheese fingers. Sparely spiced, good taste. Perfect for snacking.

All of this was accompanied with some chilled water! :)

NOTE - This review is based off an invitation that I had got from the management.

I was invited by FIPR for a bloggers meet to this little kiosk at Golpark. Just take the lane next Nnoni Jewellers (near mouchak sweets) and it would be on your left hand side. Don't go by the looks of it, this place has potential. Appetiso specialises in London style street food and is probably the first of its kind in the city. We were served the following :

Good Ol' Fish & Chips - Nice and crispy. Loved the tartare sauce.

Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce - Really nice and soft. Loved the texture. Definitely ordering again, although the butter sauce was really watery.

By far my favourite, the Crusted Chicken (Lime infused) was nice and crunchy. They were coated with cornflakes and the texture was to die for. The best seller in my opinion.

Cottage cheese fingers with potato wedges were also really good. Only wish they had a few beverages to slush down these munchies!

PS : They were really kind enough to give us a takeaway of Fried Fish with mustard sauce which was really good too.

Thank you so much team Appetiso and FIPR.

The Fish loving "Bhodrolok" has always looked at "Basa" as the unloved step child of the Fish Family.. to this I would say... give "appetiso" a try. This new takeway outlet that has opened in Gol Park in Kolkata (right next to Chanda's Khaukswey) has a very interesting repertoire of flavours. For non Fish eaters.. there are some really nice Chicken options.. a few Vegetarian dishes are available too.. My Son and I tried their Good Ole' Fish n Chips, Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce and the Roasted Chicken Drumsticks. My Son, who normally doesn't relish Fish, polished off the entire portion of Fish n Chips.. Grilled Fish comes with a separate container of Lemon Butter Sauce.. pour as much as you like on the Fish.. I really liked it. and The Roasted Chicken was crisp and flavoured well.
