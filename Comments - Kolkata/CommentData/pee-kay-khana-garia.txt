Been here a couple of times as it is about 200 meters from my house. Food isn't that good. Okayish to be honest. 5 mins walk from this restaurant and you reach Shahid Khudiram Metro Station. Food of a far superior quality can be found there. During my last visit to Peekay, I ordered a Chicken roll and a plate of chicken chopsuey. The chicken in the roll was hard and the chopsuey was served cold. So I suppose you can make out my impression from this review.

The food here is awesome and the quality is very nice and hygienic. Even the price is much lower comparable to the taste of the items. Truly satisfying. People should definitely visit again and again.
