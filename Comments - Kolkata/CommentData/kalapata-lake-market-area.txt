Amazing food. Eechor chingri, chitol muitha were heavenly. The thali was very well assembled and tasty. The experience was really great! A must have for Bengali food lovers!

It's just like any other small joint to have local Bengali home made dishes,  don't expect anything special.  We ordered chicken and bhetki Thali,  chicken was cold but it was soft and okay type,  didn't like the bhetki preparation since it was much sweeter,  the mixed veg with macher matha was nice, even daal...good thing is rice and veg dishes are unlimited...can checkout in case no better option

This is a small but cozy air-conditioned joint on a bye-lane opposite to the Lake Mall. We ordered for plain rice, mixed daal, aloo bhaja and chicken curry. Taste was quite good. Very homely. Price too is very reasonable. Will go back there to try their other items.

They have a new outlet near Southern Avenue and I have been to both. Being a Ilish lover, I loved the Ilish here and it was cooked perfectly! The service is fast and good. There is good flavour in all the items including the veggies like Alu Posto, Chingri Potol.

Been to this place for the first time as I wanted for some bengali cuisine on this festivity time!
Ordered for Basanti pulao and Mutton kasha! 
Basanti pulao was good. Sweet a bit on the taste and the rice could have been a bit more boiled is what I found. 
Mutton kasha was good. Mutton was soft and well cooked! 
Service was good .
But at that point of time I only found one of them don't know why.
Food was hot . And yes reasonable rate!

Heard a lot about this place, finally got a chance to visit this bengali cuisine restaurant. We visited their new outlet which is a 5 mins walking distance from the original one. Coming to the food, as we were four, we ordered 2 basanti pulao, 1 plate mutton kasa, 1 plate extra rice and 1 mutton meal. Quality and quantity both were great. Especially the mutton kasa was delicious. Pocket pinch was 810, very much pocket friendly for four people. Going to visit again for sure.

This place is located just opposite to Lake Mall . This is nothing like a bengali cuisine restaurant sounds like . The ambience may not attract you , but honestly this place is not gonna hurt your comfort zone if you are not a pseudo Aristrocrate . This is actually a better version of piece hotel . The serve you in steel plates but the food they serve undoubtedly beats many big names and the variety of fishes and cuisines they serve . This is better resort for a summer lunch coz here you get homely version of cuisines tastier . Very very pocket friendly . I wish the worked on their decor a lil .
