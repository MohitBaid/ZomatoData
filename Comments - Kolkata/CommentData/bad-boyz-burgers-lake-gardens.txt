A new addition to the ever increasing stack of burger joints in and around South Kolkata. The staff is helpful and open to reviews; had a long chat with the owner who was extremely courteous as well. The decor is simple and soothing to the eye, and augurs well with the overall theme of the joint. The burgers are extremely well made, and do not burn a hole in the pocket. Their Peri Peri Chicken Burger is a treat for the tastebuds. Overall, a pretty decent place to hang out with friends and family and have a good time!

This new baby is a good place to visit for ardent burger lovers.Having a comparatively smaller menu card and taking a bit too long to serve food are the negatives if one wants to really point out the flipsides but otherwise the decor is lovely,staff is polite and pocket friendly price makes it a more viable option to students as well.Tried the chedder cheese chicken burger xl size ( xxl size available for big-eaters) wd add-on egg n the bun was soft,burger was juicy and tasted good.French fries are served alongwith mayo n ketchup together with the burger which was good in quality n quantity bit sadly not at all crispy.Also I was surprised to see they are serving latte for 40 rupess but on ordering i found it was just normal coffee but i dont complain considering it tasted really good n price was on the cheaper side.Italian cheese stuffed chicken meatballs where tasty,the dip that came along was palatable.The fish and chips was overpriced,bleak in taste,not crunchy,totally tasteless,soft french fries,waste of money.Do not order this.Lamb burgers are their speciality and will definitely go back again to try it.Ordered their chocolate pastry for dessert but it was unavailable so it would be better if they increase their stock.Overall nice experience and worth a visit
