Sucking the marrow out of the nali haar at this Chitpur restaurant in Napoleoner Chithi, Feluda discovered that the biryani at Royal Indian Hotel acts like a ‚Äúbrain tonic‚Äù.¬†

Royal Indian Hotel will strike you as just another ordinary eatery dishing out Mughlai food but just climb up the narrow, steep staircase to the first floor, order their Royal Mutton Biriyani and you won't regret finding your way to this congested part of Kolkata and sharing an ordinary ambience with all kinds of people around you. 

We ordered : 

‚Ä¢ Chicken Tikka kabab: It was not up to the mark. The chicken was a lot fibrous. 

‚Ä¢ Royal Mutton Biriyani: This was best among all. Soft melting mutton with meat balls within the flavoured rice. 

‚Ä¢ Royal Chicken Biriyani: Chicken was soft, and the biriyani as usual was at par. 

‚Ä¢ Nargisi kofta: Idk what's so special about it and people drooling over it. 

‚Ä¢ Chicken Tikka Butter Masala: This was pretty ordinary. 

So, 
Food: 3.5/5
Ambience: 3.5/5
Cleanliness: 3/5
Service: 3.5/5
Value for money: 4/5

Royal is a legendary restaurant satisfying the mughlai food craving of Calcuttans for ages now. Situated near Nakhoda Mosque, this outlet is always crowded. They have both AC and Non AC seating arrangements. This restaurant is mainly famous for Mutton Chap which is just delicious according to me. The biryani which they serve is so light yet tasty,may not be as good as Arsalan or Shiraz but it has got it's own flavours. I also had Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Rumalj Roti here- the Chicken Tikka Butter Masala lacked butter but was spicy and I loved it. Price is reasonable and service is quick.

The first place which came to everyone's mind when there was no Arsalans and Aminias. This is the place famous fir the Mutton Chaap and Mutton Biryani. It is the most popular place in the North. üòç

Royal = Amazing Biriyani. The Mutton was falling off the bones and the kebabs were melting in the mouth. This comparatively newer outlet near Barabazar is no less in terms of authentic Royal quality and taste.
P.S. No aloo in the Biriyani though.

Excellent quality of foods, very delicious. Good service. The following items are must try here:

1. Mutton Biryani, which comes with one piece of mutton and one piece of meatball.

2. Chicken Chap, which comes with an iconic gravy that is available only here.

3. Mutton Seekh Kebab, which comes with two almost 10 inch long mutton kebab.

4. Firni, for dessert.

Went there on a Winter afternoon with friends. Located in at a very odd place, this legendary restaurant serves great Mughlai food and is known especially for their Biriyani. The ground floor has the main Kitchen and the 1st floor of the restaurant is divided into parts, one part air conditioned and the other portion non air conditioned  with the prices varying accordingly. We went to the air conditioned half and the ambiance was pretty simple. Nothing too fancy. We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Tandoori Butter masala and Rumali Roti. The Biriyani was very light and simple but had no potatoes or eggs in it. And the chicken butter masala was very yummy with the chicken being really tender juicy. Overall we had a nice experience.

5 stars for the food, but i will deduct 2 stars for the terrible service. Anyway, i went here for the first time in 26 years and i was really impressed with the food. The biryani was the authentic biryani, without the Kolkata specific alu. However, the mutton seekh kebab and keema are amazing. Also, the place is very cheap!! :-D
Oh yes, and the firni is amazing!!

It is very easy to locate this joint. It is said to be one of the oldest gems of biriyani in kolkata.. the ambiance of the restaurant was like typical muslim gharana type, apt for a famous Biriyani joint. 

Ordered tangri kebab and biriyani. Tangri kebab was in one word awesome.. It just melts in ur mouth. Amazing.  But the Biriyani that is the crown jewel of the place disappointed us a lot. Its very dry, in fact its too dry.. taste is pretty pale.  Im a Biriyani fan but this really disappointed me big time.  But at the same time kebab won my heart.  
Last but not the least price is pretty darn cheap.. will fill nothing if you split equally among friends.. ;)

Bit of advice.  Let your friend take the Biriyani first u order something else, taste it first order if u like.. ;)

Cannot be a better made any place else. 
Been visiting this place for 17-18 years now and the place hardly disappoints. 
Nice for family dines. 

Other dishes I'd suggest : 
Mutton rezala & rumali roti 
Mutton pasinda & rumali roti/ butter naan
Tandoori chicken

Royal, at its Royal best. The outlet opposite of Nakhoda masjid, is a pure gem. The kebabs are yummy and really soft. Biriyani, probably has a bit more of oil, but its never a healthy biriyani anywhere anyway. Mutton liver curry was good too, and the firni they serve, is amazing. Service is prompt, and servers give valuable suggestions.

Went there after the Pujas. It is famous for its biriyani and chicken chap. So we opted for those . Quite to my disappointment neither was good. The quantity of the Biriyani was so less. They do not put potato in their biriyani which according to me, is a crime! The chicken chap was also very oily and it's not at all worth the money. I couldn't understand what's the hype is all about. Maybe it's good in some past years, but I would say this place is not even worth a try.

One of my favourite Biriyani place in the town. Just love their light, aromatic & less spicy yet flavourful biriyani. Took their Mutton Biriyani along with a plate of mutton kosha & a reshmi kebab. All the dishes were extremely tasty & the portion of the biriyani was adequate. Kebab was really soft & succulent. There were two big pieces of mutton along with some delish gravy which goes really well with biriyani. Overall it was really a nice experience.

The space is also smaller than it‚Äôs newer outlet. The food is beyond words as everything they serve is sumptuous ! The Shahi Tukda was a bit on the sweeter side but when did a little sugar hurt anyone ! Enjoy !

I was craving for Royal Mutton Biriyani past few years but couldn't make it...  A year back I some how managed to take a parcel of Mutton Chap and Sahi Tukra.. But unfortunately I didn't like it as the Mutton was under cooked, Desert was good...
 On 15 th Dec 2017 after an hour struggle for car parking, I finally managed to enter the Restaurent and ordered-
1. Mutton Biriyani (4.5/ 5)- Excellent taste , with soft medium pc of mutton .... A small meat balls in it which was not there in my plate.. But when I asked for it the staff was kind enough to bring me one meatball...  
2. Chicken Chap (5/5) - Chicken chap was also nice anf different from other places.. It looked spicy but tasted light and grains in the gravy adds extra taste in ur mouth.... 
3. Firni (4/5) - Light sweetness, Nice but should have added some dryfruits for garnish....
A plate of salad was served with it..
But taste changes as the food becomes cold ,ghee in it becomes sticky so u should finish ur food fast after its served ....

No other place did stand a chance and still now it has its place marked. Still one of the best biriyani hub to visit. Times have changed but their biriyani still has its wonderful aroma to catch someone off guard. Best I had , one of the best I'm having and one of the best I'll have

For an official purpose of librarians' review meeting at youth centre, the organisers had sponsored this brand of biryani. As I'm a member of it i was there and had a chance to have RIH's biryani, for the first time.  Have ticked off many biryani places before, though I skipped this place. Now it has been bookmarked for sudden biryani hunger üòÇ. Organisers had sponsored mutton biryani as it's an all time favourite. The rice was enough and as usual I couldn't eat them all. One piece big sized potato and Mutton is served with it. But yes I found this a bit oily, yet delicious üòã. Wish to taste their side dishes or more delicacies some other day.

Royal Indian Hotel is truly a nice destination for all kind of food lovers. The place maintained its authentic test throughout years. The speciality of this place is its Mutton Chap and Biryani. Though we had ordered some different items, i.e. Chicken Tikka Kabab, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala with Butter Nun. Foods were to good as expected. But the friendly behaviour of table stuff make experience much delightful.

My childhood restaurant experience started with the biryani & champ from here. Crossing the restaurant is always a delight and the smell just pulls me inside. However the experience has changed from my childhood to now. The quality is degrading day by day along with the quantity. It's a noatalgia for me to eat there. Whatever may happen it still has a special place in my üíì heart. Couple of days ago I went with my mom's and dad casually, was disappointed with the biryani, although the mutton champ seemed to hold us back enough. I believe that they should improve on the biriyani since competitors are there. Rest it's a heritage.

Hands down! One of the best biryani in town! Though Calcutta lovers might start off on a wrong note because Royal Indian Hotel doesn‚Äôt serve a potato in their biryani, but true biryani lovers aren‚Äôt actually disappointed but they regard it as one of the best and most authentic biryani in Calcutta.

The biryani is sumptuous and I personally love the Mutton Biryani with ‚Äúkeema koftas‚Äù added to them, I usually pair it up with a chicken side dish which this time was Chicken Curry. The chicken curry comes with a light gravy and a half potato and goes along really well with the biryani!

I was already stuffed, but there‚Äôs always room for dessert and thus the Shahi Tukra.

A refreshing Sunday means, a plan for have some aromatic age old Mughal Delicacies. Oh yes, you guys are always predict it correctly... Biriyani !!!

Since my childhood, l heard a lot about ‚Äú‡¶∞‡ßü‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∞‡¶ø‡ßü‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßÄ ‡¶Ü‡¶∞ ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶™‚Äù from my ancestors. Now time to try it. 

Heard rumours, that the new restaurant of Royal, recently open to the customer at Park Circus, is not at per with their age old quality, like the old outlet at Barabazar. It is almost opposite of Nakhoda Mosque at Ezra street (Rabindra Sarani).

Don‚Äôt expect a valet parking under the hotel. On Sunday you can park your vehicle infront of Royal (2 max), if you are lucky (it is first come first serve basis), because you will find most of the shops closed at Barabazar. I am not so lucky, so my driver parked my car at a distance.

You have to climb a tough narrow staircase to reach the actual restaurant. For the aged people like my parents will find it really tough. After finish climbing you will find non-ac restaurant at your left and ac restaurant at your right. We had choose ac one, because right is always right ;)

The seating zone is not spacious. We had occupied a six seater table, since it was the only option to us, though we were only three.

We found senior attendees wearing grey safari, who are responsible for taking orders. We ordered three plates of Biriyani, Murg Malai Kebab (as starter), Mutton Pasinda Kebab, Mutton Chanp and Sahi Tukra (as desert).

1. Murg Malai Kebab: Oh, it‚Äôs heavenly. Please do try it. Anyone familiar with Arsalan‚Äôs special cheese reshmi kebab can guess it. But it is not so cheesy and not unhealthy as well. If you want to taste real Malai Kebab, here you go. My rating 4.8 out of 5.

2. Mutton Biriyani: Really maintained their dignity. Quality was awesome, I will say, it is in top 2 on my list of Biriyani Houses I had already tried. Quantity too enough for a normal person like me. People with higher appetite will find it bit less and lower (like my mom) find it much more. Of course there you will not find the humble Bengali potato and glossy egg. It‚Äôs the dignity which they are still trying to maintain and a Biriyani enthusiasts like me, will always respect this. My rating is 4.6 out of 5.

3. Mutton Pasinda Kebab: Really awesome, please don‚Äôt forget to try it once. I can swear, you will fall in love with it. Shredded mutton kebab, you will find it look similar with mutton chnap, but can easily distinguish by its boneless feature and different colour. My rating is 4.8 out of 5.

4. Mutton Chnap: I will say, the only restaurant in Kolkata who is still maintained the quality of actual chnap. My rating is 4.5 out of 5.

5. Sahi Tukra: Also a must try item. You will never regret if you try it. The best ever Sahi Tukra I ever tried in my life. My rating is 4.8 out of 5.

After completing my Biriyani survey, I will revisit some of the Biriyani houses. Royal should be one among them for the entire life, till it maintains its quality.

One of the famous & legendary mughlai restaurants of Kolkata , Royal Indian Hotel , has been serving the foodies for a long time . Situated on Rabindra Sarani near Nakhoda Mosque this place is renowned for their delicacies throughout the country . The locality is very congested & parking is an issue in the narrow roads . The restaurant has remained the same since I first visited here more than 30 years ago as a little boy clutching my parents fingers . The beautiful smell of mughlai cuisines will greet you as you approach the place . The ground floor is mainly the takeaway section though some seating arrangements are there . If you are visiting with your family then the first floor family section is a better option . Though it lacks the glitz of today's modern restaurants but the place is reminiscent of the old days when Kolkata used to be Calcutta & separate family cabins with Purdah add to the nostalgic feeling . The staffs are well conversant with the foods on offer & will explain to you in detail about the preparation of the dishes . Coming to the food today we had the following :
Chicken Tikka Kabab : We ordered Chicken Tikka Kabab as a starter & it was mouthwatering . A plate contains 7 pieces of Kababs with associated salads , a perfect dish to begin our journey .
Mutton Biryani Special : A visit to Royal is never complete without their Biryani . We chose the Special one as it contains two pieces of mutton . The Royal Biryani is devoid of potato & egg & follow the traditional Lucknowi style . The quantity is sufficient while no words can describe the splendid nature of quality of the Biryani . The aromatic rice combined with the perfectly cooked mutton is a sheer delight .
Mutton Chap : Another famous dish of Royal . The small mutton pieces are great in taste & its a sheer pleasure to close the eyes & savour the taste . The gravy is truly mesmerizing when taken with a roti .
Mutton Tikia : Hardly ever had a better Tikia anywhere else . The minced mutton with adequate & right quantity of spices was another high point .
Rumali Roti : The perfect companion for Chap & Tikia . The roti was light & fresh , the grain used is of high quality .
Firni : The great dessert after a royal mughlai meal . Firni in an earthen pot completed our meal for today.
Royal Indian Hotel was truly royal when I visited here with my parents , still is royal when I am visiting with my wife & will no doubt remain as royal as ever when we will take our son with us in near future .
Highly recommended .

The food quality is average, but quantity is compromised here. Biriyani doesn't contain Aalu or egg. Meat pieces are not satisfactory. Staffs are courteous though. Prices are revised. Photos in Zomato are old prices.

I have always wanted to write about the Royal Indian Hotel, which introduced the dish which would later transcend the boundaries of age, race, caste and religion to become the most popular delicacy of Kolkata - biriyani. Ahmed Hussain, was a migrant wrestler from Lucknow with a passion for cooking. His ancestors were chefs in the royal kitchens of Awadh, and it is said that their secret biryani recipe was handed down the generations in Hussain's family. He rented a small space in Chitpur from Raja Rajendra Mullick of the Marble Palace, Kolkata and opened up the Royal Indian Hotel in 1905. Today, over 110 years later, the original branch of this restaurant still stands at the same place in Chitpur.

The place caters to a range of customers, with two non-AC halls (one on the ground floor, and the other on the first floor) and a slightly more expensive AC hall on the first floor.

The menu is short and crisp - you know exactly what you want to order, anyway! Let me talk about a few of my favourties:

1. Royal Mutton Biriyani: Starting off with the obvious, Royal serves my favourite biriyani in Kolkata (with the possible exception of the Saffron at Park Hotel, but then, I can't afford Saffron every week). The biriyani is light, and less spicy than your average Kolkata biriyani, and less fragrant. The reason is these guys do not use cinnamon. Cardamom, clove and saffron are used to give the biriyani its subtle flavour. However, due to the less aromatic spices, the wholesome and tantalizing aroma of the basmati rice is well-preserved and pervades your surroundings when the plate of biriyani is put in front of you. Contrary to the Kolkata tradition, there is no potato in the biriyani. This makes sense, since the potato was supposedly an innovation of the chefs of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah during his exile years in Calcutta, since the Nawab's household could not afford enough pieces of meat at that time (it was basically a cost-cutting innovation). The mutton is cooked just right for the meat being tender enough, while preserving the original juiciness and flavours of the meat. The rice is light and fluffy, and not too greasy (unlike standard biriyani). The taste is more subtle than your regular biriyani, and in general, and the taste gently spreads over your taste buds rather than assaulting them.

2. Chicken Tangri Kabab: The drumstick-only cousin of the popular tandoori chicken, the kababs are always well-grilled. The pieces are just very slightly chewy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The pieces are well marinated, and you can taste the tandoori spices well into the core. There is no sweet cream or malai added (like they do in kalmi kabab in some restaurants), so the kabab remains tangy and spicy.

3. Chicken Curry: I prefer this gravy item to go along with my biriyani instead of the more popular Mutton Chaap of Royal. The gravy is exceptionally light for an Indian curry, seasoned with minimal spices. The oil content is also comparitively much lower. The comparitive subtlety of the gravy actually makes the taste of the chicken more pronounced. The chicken piece is tender and juicy, with the original meat flavours well-preserved. They also serve a large piece of potato in the curry, which, for me, compensates for the absence of the potato in the biriyani.

4. Shahi Tukda: Not being a fan of the phirni, I love this piece of ghee fried bread covered in rich sweet kheer (condensed milk), flavoured with saffron and garnished with chopped almonds. Available on only a few of days of the week at Royal, this rich dessert is the perfect way to end your biriyani meal.

Not at all a Royal Experience..My roomie went there for lunch, so I asked him to bring Mutton Biryani and mutton keema as I heard a lot about Royal's Biryani. But really had a disappointing experience. Price is too high for such quality. Not to be recommended..

Nothing short of 5.0 for Mutton Chap! Royal is one of those vintage resources in Kolkata who have remained consistent with their quality. If you are visiting this place then Biryani and Mutton Chap is a must.

Horrible Experience!!üò£üò£
just imagine u r eating ur food and suddenly realise 4cats r eating raw chicken under your table and sometimes jumping over ur chair!! Is it a legendary restaurant or a roadside rice hotel?? when i told the staffs about it, they said "nothing will happen,u can sit and finish ur food, they will not bite"... what the hell!! i am also an animallover but this is purely unhygienic.. and staffs were so annoying.. continuously asking how was the food taste, atleast 20times..atleast give some personal time to the customers.
lets come to the food part.. we had ordered Mutton pasinda kabab-rumali roti and Chicken biriyani.
1) only good thing in the lot was pasinda kabab.. it was mouth watering.
2) i hv heard about royal chicken biriyani so many times, i was very excited.. but trust me it was like roadside biriyani.. nothing spcl.. even can't imagine biriyani without potato.
i will never ever visit this place in my entire life.wasted my moneyüôèüôè

An awesome joint for any food lover who don't think about calories. Planned to have lunch with some friend and sweetie, and it worked so well. Feeling of nostalgia after sitting in the cabin is obvious for anyone. Started with Chicken tikka kebab which really enhances your appetite. And the Royal Biriyani continues to be the best one as it was. Also ordered Mutton Pasinda and Chicken Bharta along with Butter Nan and Roomalis. All of those are delicious and rich in taste. And the sweetest thing was the Sahi Tukda which satisfied the taste bud completely. A must visit for everyone.

Since I was coming across rumors from people around me that , their quality and quantity has degraded and all . But believe me it's just heaven for Briyani lovers like me . Their might have been some difference in their taste compared ta as it was years back but I must say they really do not compromise with their quality , quantity and service... I went to dis place after almost 5-6 years but still the taste of their Briyani nd that mutton chanp just taken me back to those old days . It's was a bliss . Still now they don't use aloo in their Briyani ( which we offen get everywhere now a days as a signature of kolkata style Briyani ) and this is what I love the most. Those same old staffs r still there serving us with all their experience... I won't love to visit this place soon again in near future...

Royal should be "Royal" in each and every way, but it didn't seem so!

First of all, those who are "Alu" lovers in a Biriyani platter, you should not visit this place. The only place in Kolkata where one will not get a piece of Alu with Biriyani.

The best thing about this place, is that it will give you a gloomy ambiance and a feel about the old dining style of Kolkata, with the shaggy yellow lights glowing and waiters shouting from one end to other to convey an order.¬†
The staff is quite courteous and always ready for assistance whenever required.¬†
The ground floor has a huge hall adjacent to the kitchen, where the seating capacity is almost about 100 and is quite spacious. The top floor has a capacity of more than 100 seating & AC along with it.

Items Ordered:¬†
Main Course: 2 Plate Royal Mutton Biriyani¬†
Desert: 2 Plate Firni
Cost: Rs.505 (Including GST)

The bill comes only with the price that is printed in the menu card.

The quantity is very less as compared to the amount they are charging for per plate. And more over the history of Royal always says that it serves one of the best & lip smacking Biriyani in town, but somehow I didn't feel enough charm in their taste.

The place is best for one time dining.
Cost for two: Rs.500 approx (Including GST)

If they increase the quantity of the platters (*specially the Biriyani) and re-generate the the long legacy which they used to have in their taste, the hotel will truly be "The Royal"!

We tried royal Chicken biryani,chiken chap amd rumali roti.
The food was served "cold".
They charge extra for AC hall.
Biryani tasted like pulao and lacked on its own taste.
Chicken chap was too oily and quantity was much less for its price.

This place has become kind of a heritage of Kolkata, its supreme range of Mughlai Dishes are really one of a kind in this foodie city. I think every single person who lives in this city & thinks him/herself as a foodie definitely has visited this place atleast a couple of times; so there is absolutely nothing new to say about this place that hasnt been already told.

It is my most horrible experience of having biriyani.
I havnt ever ate such a bad quality biriyani in my whole life.
The rate of foods r very high in comparison to its quality.
Chicken chap was tooooo horrible .
Evn biriyani is without potato.
We cnt imagine biriyani without potato .
Mutton in the biriyani was too small.
Overall it was a disastrous experience nd i will never visit it again nd advice everyone to avoid it .
Just waste of money.

Want to eat the tastiest biryani in Kolkata.. look no further than this place.

What I like the most are as following:
1 - No aaloo
2 - Fair amount of quantity for 1
3 - Same old and authentic taste

What else... Well, one can opt for following too:
Rumali Roti, Mutton Keema, mutton chap, mutton pasinda, motton seekh kebab, mutton rezala and firni as a desert.

Royal Indian Hotel is one of the pioneer of Biryani in Kolkata. 
Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh came to the Kolkata suburb of Metiaburj in 1856 after defeated by British. But he did not forget bringing his personal Chef with him as he was very particular about his food. Form the Rasoi of Nawab Kolkata Biryani started its journey. The Baburchi used to add potatoes and eggs along with meat in Biryani which was served to the working class people under Nawab. But the Nawab always had the authentic Awadhi Biryani which had cooked only with Gosth or meat. Royal Indian Hotel is one who maintain this Nawabi Biryani style.
Let's come to the food.

1.Mutton Biryani: The name doesn't need more descriptions. Royal serves authentic Biryani. It consists a good quantity of flavored rice and a soft piece of mutton. Taste.... Please come and try.
 
Note: they don't add ALU or Egg in Biryani

2. Chaap (Chicken and Mutton): If you asked any one where to go for chaap ...only one answer you will get...Royal. Meat cooked in ghee keep you licking your plates.

3. Sheek kebab: Good size of kebab served with green chutney.

Service: For Biryani you don't have to wait.For Kebab, it depends. Overall service is good.

Food: 4.3/5
Service: 4/5
Ambience: 3.8/5 

N:B: For good ambience I  prefer its new Park Street brunch opposite Quest Mall

I visited Royal more than five times and wanna visit again for the Chaap.

Only take the price which is printed in the menu card .  We have tried tandoori chicken , roomali rooti , mutton biryani and chicken tikka butter masala . All of them were very good in taste though this restaurant is famous for their biriyani . The don't give potato and egg along with biriyani . Also biriyani was not very oily and amount is good enough for 1 person . Chicken tikka butter masala was very oily but really good in taste .

Its just a waste of time to reviewing such a legendary outlet bt still i am in Zomato n i hv to do it.
Starting wid the Nargisi Kofta its a master piece of Royal n one must try it.

We orderd (sukha gila) mutton biriyani n it ws spicy as it ws gila.. n we hd the best biriyani in the town.

We had mutton chanp ( though I love Aminia‚Äôs chicken champ more) but its better than Areslan n Shiraz.

Partha was excellent ,soft n aroma of ghee was just perfect for us.
 
And we ended up wid their iconic sweet dish the Sahi Tukra which made us feel like a king aftr having it n we ended up our  Royal India Hotel journey which costed rs.1850 for four ppl.

I heard about this place from my friend. This place is near from Md.Ali park. So after pandal hoping yesterday hungry and exhausted us went to this place.. We didn't need to wait for table. First if you are looking for a fancy place this is not your place.. The locality is too much crowded so as the resturant.. We odered chicken biriyani and royal special chicken chaap. They served us within 10 mins that was the surprising part.. Coming to the food the biriyani is little lesser quantity than other places. But it was light and well cooked and the chicken piece was big enough.. Now coming to the chaap.. This made me speechless. The chaap is well cooked not only that you can feel the taste in your mouth.. The curry taste delicious.. I can give 5 only for the chap and yes ofcourse the piece was big enough.. For a foodie it's a must visit place...
P.s You have to tip the waiter if you want to give another shot...

This place needs no formal introduction. A heritage hotel located at one of the most crowded places in the city. Famous for muhhlai dishes this restaurant still follows the age old recipe of making mughlai dishes. Their biriyani is low on the spice quotient yet very delicious. The ambience is quite decent. The prices of the food item easily fits in the budget. The hospitality of the staff is very good. Their food especially biriyani and chaanp are mood lifter for every people. The kebabs are also good . The desert sanction especially their firni is second to none. So Royal Indian Hotel in Burrabazar can be given a chance to shower their love on you through food.
Photos coming soon.

Tried their chicken biryani and mutton chap. They still follow their age old recipe of making the biryani and don't use any essence. The chicken biryani was very delicate and low on the spice quotient yet very delicious. It tasted more like a lucknowi pulao with very delicate and mellow flavours. The main flavours of their biryani comes from elaichi, clove and kesar. The mutton chap was tasty and it goes best with rumali or tandoori roti. I feel the portions were a bit on the lower side. Overall a decent experience.

Perfect genuine authentic awadhi biryani- that's what Royal is all about. No artificial smell, no artificial colour- that's the hallmark of awadhi biryani & that's what differentiates it from calcutta style biryani.. You can get the mild & sweet aroma that is of pure saffron & basmati. the rice have a very mild yellow colour that comes from saffron only. The piece of mutton is perfectly tender. And along with that adequate amount of ghee/dalda & very little amount of spices- Royal has indeed maintained the genuinity of awadhi biryani through out these years. People expecting to have calcutta style biryani might feel a little disappointed here because there is no big piece of potato or egg that can be found & hence the quantity might seem a little less. But for me it was adequate. They have both ac & non ac segment. Though you might have to wait a little as most of the times it is crowded & the ambience seems mediocre. But as a biryani lover i can say that it is worth everything & must visit place.

We ordered two mutton Biriyani and one mutton chap.. Taste was quite good when the food was hot.. But the Biriyani became dry after sometime.. The mutton chap was really taste good..quantity was decent and. Quite reasonable too..be prepared to give tips...in the non ac section they take payment via card... But on the ground floor they only take cash.. However,  it was overall a good experience..

Rude, uncultured & unwelcoming cook sits outside cooking "chaanp"... behaves like he's a direct descendant from the Royal Kitchen of Mughal era... Ask any question & he could even bite you for your ignorance while blood-boiling statements are a bonus for you!!
When I went in, it was filled with stinky & sweating vest-worn guys packing biryani & shouting among themselves & sometimes even on customers! Although there were almost 10 staff around but none paid any heed to what I was asking for even after several attempts!

I had gone to this place for the "first time" in life after hearing a lot since childhood & seeing this kind of ridiculous & unprofessional behaviour, didn't even feel to fight & try their food at all! Came back & I am never going to visit here.

It can't get simpler than this. Go to Royal. No need for any menu card or second thoughts. Simply ask for the Biriyani and Chaanp. Obviously mutton!! (What else?? Chicken is ONLY for Kabab, right? For anything else it should be Mutton or Lamb or Beef. Well, in very few cases you may consider pork also. but that's another discussion altogether) Yes!! That's it. 

Now just wait and watch till they bring you that magical plate covered with yellowish rice with aroma vaporizing out of it. A small plate full of small small pieces of Chaanp will accompany it and you can easily feel the coriander plus ginger cooked in ghee smell has already taken you under its spell.

Savor them slowly. Relish the moment with each morsel. Everything in the world can wait. Royal offers little spicy Biriyani, mostly flavored with black pepper, nothing you can't handle. This makes the taste class apart from the regular average bi-color Biriyani you'll get every corner and some so called big names. Oh and don't insult Biriyani expecting egg and/or that dreaded hand grenade size potato. Who eats that potato now a days I wonder!

Only Aliah can come closer in comparison to Royal. It will be a tough competition.

If you are extra hungry, and in the mood for appetizer, you may go for Sugandhi Kabab. but trust me, they are not that good.

If you want to try something new, Pasinda kabab is your best bet. Its again a mutton preparation, similar to Chaanp, but little sour in taste and sometimes I really have hard time to decide between Pasinda Kabab and Chaanp. Chaanp gets the benefit of doubt most of the time :)

For dessert, Firni can be an option. Shahi Tukra is great too, but bit sweeter for my taste. But I hardly ever order them. Biriyani and Chaanp is good enough for me most of the times. I eat less but it has to be the best ;)

Went here yesterday to try out their biryani.. had previously heard a lot about that.. well they don't prepare a traditional Bengali biryani.. I missed the aloo and egg badly.. otherwise it was pretty delicious, chicken was well cooked but I found it a bit dry.. the rice had a certain flavour and I liked it very much.. we also had Nargisi Kofta... it was bloody delicious.. but this outlet doesn't have an air conditioned dining area.. so if you are planning to go there after a heavy shopping in barabazar it'll be a bit uncomfortable up there in this heat.. otherwise rest is all great..

This is one of the best places in the city for having Mughalai dishes and their Mutton Biriyani and Mutton chaap surpasses any other restaurant's and I would like to add that I have travelled a whole lot and tasted many mughalai foods all over the country and  in my opinion I doubt if any other places in the country serves such tasty delicacies in the mentioned field, the name truly defines it all #Royal which the food indeed is. ‚ù§üëå

Visited the place after many years but previously there was no Zomato so couldnt put a review. 
Ordered: Rumali roti, royal mutton chap,  green salad. 
Rumali roti: Was soft and good and of good regular size. 
Mutton chap: It costed me 195 (ac) and the amount was NOT adequate for that price. More or less as one can fit in a tea saucer (plate). But the taste was good,  quite good.
Salad: It was called green salad and was priced at rs 30 with only three little pieces of cucumber and few cut pieces of Green chilies,  two cut pieces of carrot (slices i mean) and tomato (2 slices). The salad was horrible and stale. 
Pros:
1) Good and cordial service 4/5
2) Taste of food (which was ordered by me) was good 4/5
Cons
1) Bad quantity with respect to the price 2.5/5
2) Quality of some stuff not nice 2/5

It is located in Burrabazar and is very famous for its Biryani. Biryani was good,mildly scented, there is no potato,no egg and the quantity seemed ok. Taste is good. People should definitely try Shahi Tukra beacuse of its taste ,though it is available only Wednesday,Friday and sunday.

Yesterday I had visited here for the 1st time. We ordered mutton seekh kebab. It was so salty that we were unable to eat it,even with lemon juice, it was still salty. We told that to the waiter,but he did not respond to us, just ignored us. After that we ordered royal mutton biryani & royal mutton chap. The taste of biryani is good, but the mutton piece was very disappointing. In simple words, we were very disappointed.

Royal Indian Hotel is very famous for its biryani and many people had  recommended it to me over the past few months,so last afternoon I visited the place with a friend of mine.Located in the heart of Barabazzar it isn't hard to find and you can ask anybody on the streets and they would guide you to the place.As we reached the place on the ground floor we saw a huge rush people were seated,dishes such as chicken chaap and biryani were being served from the utensils in front of our eyes like most biryani outlets,we decided to get seated upstairs in the air conditioned area and that was also full so we had to wait for five minutes to get a seat.Once we were seated we decided not to delay and ordered the mutton biryani as the chicken was not available,along with that we opted for rumali rotis and chicken curry.The food was served within 10 minutes,the curry and rumali roti were nothing extraordinary,just regular taste but the biryani was impressive really light and not too spiced up with a good aroma and a nice sized piece of soft mutton. 
P.S. The service was quick and the staff were courteous.

It is located in bara bazar. Ambience is not so good n is a crowded place. For AC room u have to wait. It's only for briyani n north Indian food. Mostly people have briyani. We have ordered chicken briyani n chicken curry. 
In chicken briyani, they don't give aalo n egg, only rice n 1 piece chicken. We can't imagine a briyani without aalo, which was disappointing.
In chicken curry also, only one piece chicken for  ‚Çπ120. Also the staffs are starring at us. 
Moreover, after the lunch we are looking for cab. The place was so crowded, no cab accepted to come and we have to cancel 5 cabs both Ola n Uber. Then we have to take bus after waiting around 1 hour, which was very pathetic n  harrassing.

If you are at Borobajar and really hungry, then there is only one address to go to - Royal Indian Hotel. It is very near to Nakhoda Masjid and is not difficult to find. This place is simply legendary and you might even hear your grand parents talk about "Royal" with a special mention about their "Chaap". I had the good fortune to visit this place today and hell yeah, I was satisfied. They have an air-conditioned seating area upstairs which is preferable if you are with your family. The menu is short. We decided on mutton biriyani, chicken chaap, tandoori roti, roomali roti, salad and firni. Firstly, biriyani was excellent, just the way I like it, mildly scented with a succulent piece of mutton. On the down side, there is no potato (for some it could be a deal-breaker), no egg and the quantity seemed quite less when compared with other biriyani joints. But taste wise it is great. The chaap is very nice too. I was a little disappointed with the firni. It tasted ordinary. But overall it was a hearty meal at Rs 520 for 2 people. If I do visit that area again i will surely visit Royal again, to try their mutton korma.

Located in the visinity of Barabazar... Close to Zakaria Street... This was the aftr quite some tym dt I went wit my family fr a lunch.. Nd dt to after shopping nd soaking in the rain... The place is an absolute gem in terms of food... Jst a small let down was the service staff... We had to go from one side to other to find a suitable table as we were 6 ppl... They could nt giv us a table of 6 even when there were many empty.... So nw coming to the food... I hd never seen my dad njoyin Biriyani lik this before... We ordered Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Keema, Chicken Bharta, Paneer Butter Masala nd Tandoori Roti... Taste it everytin was gem..... Nd i must quote this dt in a city lik Kolkata were the concept of Biriyani without Aloo (Potato) is nt eligible, this place does nt serve aloo (Potato) with their Biriyani nd still rocks.... I would hv given a 5 out of 5 in the review if nt fr the let down in service.. Bt otherwise 1 of the must visit restaurants in Kolkata. Awsome Biriyani nd Mutton Keema.. Will b back fr sure...

Royal Indian Hotel heard a lot about it from my mum.During that time in the 90s  this was probabaly the best place in Kolkata for mughlai dishes.As I went there truly found it in that way as I was being told.Starting with the food  I didn't go for the starters  directly jumped on to the main course as I am big big big fan of biriyani.This biriyani which I tasted was totally different from rest of the restaurants.Within itself it has an amazing taste.The rice  as well as the mutton  was amazingly prepared.Mutton chaap was also brilliant small cubic peices deeply fried brings the mughlai touch.Laccha paratha and firni were superb.Lastly only one issue they really need to take care is the quantity of food which is very disappointing.This place needs to be visited again and again whenever one wants the real taste of biriyani only they must keep in mind the quanity of food.

Hav been to dis place quite a few times. Their biriyani is devoid of any aloo but dey make it up with the topping of koftas(meat balls). It was on my first visit to this restaurant, that they messed up as they had run out of the meatballs. But otherwise the biriyani is an absolute bliss and the ingredients used in it are genuine. They supposedly dont use any artificial colourants, but carrot extracts to colour their rice. The serving of meat was generous and tender. Overall Royal can be certified as one of the best biriyani joints in Kolkata.
Coming to their mutton chaap; tastewise i dont remember if i had tasted a better chaap else where but ingredientwise it was 25 pc meat and 25 pc bone , 25 pc animal fat floating in 25 pc dalda with the right spices added to it and cooked to perfection. So i guess u got wat i mean. Tasty: yes
@Value 4 money: not at all
(Can make u really sick if u dnt leave behind da dalda)
The firni is a delight to have though, perfect consistency nd taste; no complains against it!
Staff is amateur, they have little children filling up ur glasses and cleaning the table(thats supposed to be illegal ). There are senior staffs as well, they might not be highly groomed but are polite and so is their manager. On our second visit we wer done with our meals and about to leave but it was raining heavily outside. Even though the restaurant was jampacked the manager offered us to sit at our table till it stopped raining and this was an unforgettable gesture.
The washroom is equipped,clean,hygenic and has a air of mughal splendour in its decor.
One thing one needs to be careful about is that they serve you the salad without asking your permission; we thought it was complimentary and took 2 slices of cucumber from it on our first visit and they charged us for the whole salad! So anyone who dont need a salad just ask for it to be removed from your table before you start with your meal.

As far as Biriyani is concerned, this place is worthy of consideration. I visited this place during Ramzan month as this is close to Zakaria street where Ramzan fair is quite popular , this place was perfect to have dinner. We had Mutton Biriyani, Tandoori roti , Mutton Pasinda Kabab, and Mutton Qeema. Food was good as expected, mutton pasinda kabab was the best and highly recommended.
one thing , i did not like here, in this place particularly, because ¬†there was a cat , it was roaming quite freely where we were having dinner. I did not like the experience.Otherwise, stuffs are quite helpful and this place will not burn a hole in your pocket much.

Royal Indian Hotel, Barabazar is a very old and famous place for having Biriyani and other north Indian dishes. Last time, visited this place with friends in a rainy evening. As soon we got our seats, we ordered

‚óè Mutton Biriyani: The quantity of a plate of Biriyani is lesser than that of other restaurants. But it was OK for me. It had very soothing flavour to it, the mutton was very tender. They serve no egg (good for me) and no potato (good for some & bad for some) in Biriyani. All in all, I was satisfied with it. 3.8/5

‚óè Mutton Chaap: 3.7/5

‚óè Mutton Keema: 3.5/5

‚óè Butter Naan: 3.5

Food was good. They are famous for mutton biriyani and mutton chaap and they didn't disappointed me!

Our meal for 3 people was of around 800 Rupees.

We sat on the ground floor. Ambience wasn't as bad as I expected!

Service was okay. Staffs were helpful.

overall a good experience.

One of the oldest & legendary place to dine in. We ordered chicken tikka kebab,Rumali roti ,mutton chap, salad, followed by mutton biriyani and another plate of mutton chap each. Their signature dish of mutton chap is cooked in royal style thus justifying the name. Mutton chap alone elevates its rating to 4 stars otherwise which could have been 3 stars out of 5. Other dishes even the mutton biriyani ordered was nothing extraordinary. Service was prompt.

This restaurant is a mood lifter for me and my dad . I won't be able to recall how many times I have been here but the count will surely exceed 20. 

Apart from the location and ambience , there is absolutely nothing one can complain about . The interiors are a bit shabby so some won't like it .  

But what matters the most is the food . There is not a single item that I haven't tasted here . Be it the huge chunks of chicken in the creamy Chicken Bharta or the spicy Mutton Kassa . This place is known for its legendary biryani - one of the best you would find in Kolkata . The chicken chaap here is so delicious that you have to order it twice at least. And what can I say about the Firni here , no comparisons üòç. 

Must try dishes : 

Chicken Chaap 
Mutton Biryani 
Chicken Bharta 
Tandoori Chicken 
Mutton Kalia 
Firni .. 


Must visit for those who are crazy for Mughlai food.

This is the probably the oldest mughlai/awadhi restaurant in Kolkata, but it's location being a constraint for me, had never visited till 8th July 2017. So, after our quick snack attack at golbari in the evening we reached this place at 8 clock.
It is located right in vicinity of the nakhoda masjid. The nearest metro station is mg road. Finding parking beside it will be a wee bit difficult.
We reached this place and saw a huge line of people at the takeaway. The aroma emanating from their kitchen was nothing less than a poetry!
We hopped up the stairs quickly to get ourselves seated in the AC portion of the restaurant and placed our order in no time. The restaurant is nothing much to look at; Comfortable sofas with normal decor, perfect for heavy dining.
Anyhow, my friends and I, especially was famished. So we ordered a plate of chicken tikka kebab and bada kebab as starters and I settled for a plate of its legendary special mutton biryani for mains with the legendary chicken chap as side. Don't expect a fast n proper service,these people are slow.
The kebabs were served just off the tandoor. Soft , succulent, smoking hot and spicy pieces of chicken tikka kebab was just the perfect start I needed. It was followed by the bada kebab,almost same in flavour, just bigger pieces with bones.
Next was the time for their allegedly legendary pi√®ce de r√©sistances.
I always have this extra love for the awadhi variation of biryani , always so flavour full, not overwhelming and yet subtle in the use of the spices, making it outstanding in the biryani category. So I had high hopes from them.
However,my hopes were shattered in no time!!

1st the biryani even though looked stunning didn't smell stunning at all. 2nd of all it was dry, anyone knows a perfect awadhi biryani can't be dry at all, it should have a perfect coating of ghee/dalda. 3rdly the pieces of mutton albeit big and soft wasn't juicy, they were devoid of any moisture content in them. 4th, being an ardent lover of biryani that I am, I need the quantity right, yet their quantity was considerably less. It fell short on many points, however there wasn't any infernal alu/potato in the biryani that was a saving grace. The rice quality was fine too. But the biryani wasn't even near to my expectations, rather I shall rank it in the near top of my worst tasted biryanis ever!
The chicken chap, was also not my liking; again a heavy dry gravy with lots of oil and a dry thin piece of chicken leg!
Anyhow, with all my expectations dashed, we left the place with heavy heart.

PS it cost 800 for 2 ppl.

The Mutton chnap.. A friend of mine is die hard fan of this item. He pushed me to go there and I went few days before Eid. The halim was pretty good but I did not find any speciality about the Mutton chnap. The biriyani was not so good and blunt in taste ( Don't knoe how people compare Arsalan with this). Tandoori rotis were okay. The ambiance is not so good as it is an old restaurant. I am not fully pleased.

This one is the shining jewel of North Kolkata. In the midst of always busy Bara bazaar area, no one can miss this place. Just a 5-8 minute walk from Mahatma Gandhi metro station, a person can easily reach their. About the food, it stands it's reputation of being the oldest awadi biriyani restaurant of Kolkata. The biriyani engages in a aromatic battle as soon as you put it in your mouth. The mutton keema served is quite oily but taste is just lip smacking and it goes well with tandoori roti/ rumali roti. The chicken kadai served did have it's own unique taste in a good way. And as we know, a good biriyani story should always end with a firni as a icing but it wasn't able to leave it's mark. As a whole, a place that you really need to visit with your friends/family. BTW, it's light on pocket.

My friend is an absolute fan of Royal's biriyani and on his constant persistence we decided to order from the same on a rainy afternoon. We ordered via Swiggy from the bara bazar outlet. 
We had ordered mutton biriyani, butter naan, mutton kasha and mutton chap. Sadly they had run out of shahi tukda. 
The mutton biriyani was fragrant and not dry. It did not have any potato (my heart broke a little) but instead had meatballs. The meatballs were richly flavoured and soft. The mutton chap is just the right accompaniment with the rice. It had subtle but amazing flavours and taste. The fat of the dish is what makes it taste even better. The meat was tender and juicy. The naans were how a good naan should be, fibrous yet soft. The mutton kasha was spicy and went very well with the naans. 


Complete bliss!

I had soo much expectations from this place,  but after visiting it I was completely disappointed.  Finding this restaurant isn't hard as it is located near Chitpur MG Road crossing.  As soon as we reached near the entrance of the restaurant I sensed a very nice aroma of their chanp and my expectations were getting high from this place. We got upstairs in the AC sections and the ambience was just average. The staffs were courteous but the service was below average. It took the waiter around 10mins to clean up the table so that we could take our seats.  After being seated we ordered Mutton Biryani and Chicken Kadhai.

The Biryani completely disappointed me.  The roadside fast food centers sell better Biryani than this. 
Chicken Kadhai is their recommended dish but trust me I will never recommend it.  It was just tasteless with full of oil. Maybe salt and spices were a bit less.
 
We had earlier thought of ordering Shahi Tukra for the dessert.  But after such disappointment after having the Biryani and chicken we dropped our plan of having sahi tukra.  üò¢

My friend is an absolute fan of Royal's biriyani and on his constant persistence we decided to order from the same on a rainy afternoon. We ordered via Swiggy from the bara bazar outlet. 
We had ordered mutton biriyani, butter naan, mutton kasha and mutton chap. Sadly they had run out of shahi tukda. 
The mutton biriyani was fragrant and not dry. It did not have any potato (my heart broke a little) but instead had meatballs. The meatballs were richly flavoured and soft. The mutton chap is just the right accompaniment with the rice. It had subtle but amazing flavours and taste. The fat of the dish is what makes it taste even better. The meat was tender and juicy. The naans were how a good naan should be, fibrous yet soft. The mutton kasha was spicy and went very well with the naans. 


Complete bliss!

I had soo much expectations from this place,  but after visiting it I was completely disappointed.  Finding this restaurant isn't hard as it is located near Chitpur MG Road crossing.  As soon as we reached near the entrance of the restaurant I sensed a very nice aroma of their chanp and my expectations were getting high from this place. We got upstairs in the AC sections and the ambience was just average. The staffs were courteous but the service was below average. It took the waiter around 10mins to clean up the table so that we could take our seats.  After being seated we ordered Mutton Biryani and Chicken Kadhai.

The Biryani completely disappointed me.  The roadside fast food centers sell better Biryani than this. 
Chicken Kadhai is their recommended dish but trust me I will never recommend it.  It was just tasteless with full of oil. Maybe salt and spices were a bit less.
 
We had earlier thought of ordering Shahi Tukra for the dessert.  But after such disappointment after having the Biryani and chicken we dropped our plan of having sahi tukra.  üò¢

Simply one of the best Briyani is served here in the entire Kolkata, along with that Mutton Chap and in gravy items Chicken Butter Masala is a much try dish along with Butter Naan. Food is very very tasty and I would recommend everyone in Kolkata to atleast go there once and after that I m sure they will have the same response. Again one of the best Briyani is served here in the entire city Kolkata.

Do not misjudge the atmosphere and order a biriani. U will only remember it for its authentic mutton chaanp,rooti and shaahi tukra(available on alternate days) along with a picturesque view of nakhoda mosque,old kolkata streets and rumbling of trams.. Excellent quality in affordable price.

One of the oldest and renowned restaurant for mughlai cuisine in Kolkata. 
But now a days it is been exaggerated than what actually it is. 
Food is good here but not outstanding. 
Biriyani is good tasty but they don't put aloo in it which makes it unlike Kolkata Biriyani.
Quantity is also less and overpriced.

Last Saturday was my first visit to this restaurant.. but I ate their Biryani and chap many years ago at someone's house.. then the biryani was soooo good in taste.. but now I felt like the biryani is little dry in texture but the chicken in it is very soft juicy and tender but the piece is very small so that I ordered one more piece of chicken which costs rs. 100/- and then I got a leg piece.. that day we stuck in traffic very badly.. it takes a long time to reach this place because of traffic.. we reached at 5pm and first ordered Haleem, rumali roti and salad .. haleem was sooo good and the roti was also good.. then we ordered two plates of chicken biryani one cold drink and one extra piece of chicken.. bill comes with in 700/- there was no tax which is very good..üòÄ next time I want to try their Mutton chap and Shahi tukra..

It is one of the oldest mughal restaurants. Mainly Mughal and North Indian foods are available here. They may take a little longer to serve but will never let you down with the taste. Whenever we head there we generally try kebabs, mutton biriyani, chicken chap and firni.
You should try their Biriyanis and Kebabs and Chicken Chap.
Biriyanis are full of flavours and the kebabs are soft and juicy.

This place oozes nostalgia with the very fragrance of the biriyani that it serves.My dad used to bring home packetful of biriyani which we used to happily gorge on.The slight spiciness of the biriyani sets it apart from the likes of Shiraz or Arsalan which I love.Also the mutton chanp is to die for.

If you are looking for a great Biriyani place then royal should be your stop !! The Biriyani is really good and the hint of kalimirch just pumps up the taste. Also their mutton chap and rumali roti is another heavenly combination. Must try !!

It was difficult for me to find the place for lunch, as there are a very few places to eat out, in this area. Full chaotic place outside the restaurant, and even the latter was full!
Said to be one of the oldest in the city, it serves the best Chicken Chaap, we ordered and it did make justice after the place-hunting! 
Even the biryani is said to be much better than Arsalan!
We ordered as Reshmi Kebab as starters and Tandoori naan for main dish. 
Just one word : SPLENDID!

At the very beginning I should clear that I have tried only biriyani and halim from royal that too take away only. Actualky I was planning to visit it for quute sometime now. Finally visited the place during month of ramzan. Trien mutton biriyani and mutton halim. Biriyani was dry, very light. The wow factor was missing. Same was the case for halim. Not the best one. Mutton piece in halim seems too large. I had tasted better halim than this. It may be due to the crowd during ramzan tgat quality get detoriated. So will visit again for sure.

Went there for to experience their famed mutton chaanp and wasnt quite blown over... the chaanp was small in quantity and oily. Had roomali rotis with the chaanp as suggested by the waiters, and it was tuned out to be not so good.... tiny pieces of mutton bones frequented in each morsel of the roomali roti.... Overall verdict, the place can be given a miss....

Went here today around 6:45pm with my parents but had to wait about fifteen minutes since, during Ramzan, seated admission is allowed after 7:00pm.
Had mutton biryani, mutton pasinda kebaband mutton chaap.
The biryani was not upto the mark. It tasted good but was on the drier side. The mutton in it was not of good quality and was hard to chew and swallow.
The mutyon pasinda kebab was absolutely heavenly and probably one of the best mutton dishes I've ever had.
The mutton chaap actually proves why it's Royal's signature dish. The way the chaap is cooked here can nowhere be found. It's simply pure bliss.

There are many biriyani dens in the town & no doubt Royal Indian Hotel ranks among the best.But during Ramzaan this place is a must visit to savour the heavenly haleem.Nargisi Kofta is another wow dish they offer.Apart from takeaway counter they have AC & Non-AC sections but found the AC section was closed.That made the experience a bit bumpy but the food took care of all shortcomings.

As a biriyani lover, one day I entered at this legendary place..Nothing has to say about the decor.It was okayish.Let's come to the Food
Firstly we ordered Rumali Rooti and Keema Curry..Keema Curry was too oily yet it tasted nice and I must say the thin layered Roomali Roti was the best accompaniment with it.
Next, we ordered most promising dish of this place, Mutton Biriyani.Just one word I have to say "WOW".Mutton piece has melted in mouth.Quantity wise it was less in a plate, Thatswhy I deducted 0.5 on review.

We choose Shahi Tukda as dessert and it's also tasted good but the dessert rates are on the higher side.
The waiters were helpful also , service was quick.
Almost it was a nice Experience

Went here for a Biryani lunch but was disappointed nonetheless. The hype surrounding this place is not justified. While the old times ambience is still there, the place was too crowded and the Biryani was just decent at the most. Tried the "Phirni" and "Keema" which fared better than the famous Biryani itself.

This place is hidden away in the streets of Bata Bazaar. Much like its fierce competitors, it is known for its outstanding non-vegetarian Mughlai fare, presented with quintessentially Kolkata tastes. Must-try items are: mutton biryani, mutton chaap,  mutton kebab, chicken reshmi butter masala, and their fabulous phirni. Trust me, you will not be disappointed!

Have been to this place a number of times for post exam celebration, birthday treats, etc.. since it is quite near to my college.. They have an AC as well a non AC section & I have no idea why do they keep the AC section closed even at times of peak noon hours.
Coming to food, it is famous for its Biriyani which indeed is totally yum.
However, like most bengalis, Biriyani for me is incomplete without the aloo & egg which is a BIG disappointment!
Nevertheless, this is a legendary outlet & definitely worth a visit!!

I've been eating here since I was 5. Now I'm 22. Sunday, Wednesday and Friday is Pasinda Day, Thursday is Chicken Bharta, Tuesday you can go for Mutton Handi and Mutton Chaap is amazing on any given day. Authentic awadhi salli(gravy) and cooked to perfection. Quantity maybe a little less compared to other places but the "Zaika" is worth it. DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR. Ideally, Uber and then end the lunch with Kesaria Firni or Shahi Tukra on selected days. The staff is revered for their "tehezeeb". They'll refer to you as 'Aap' no matter what your age and background.

Royal, Shiraz & Aminia were the three major Mughlai eatieries in Kolkata before the likes of Arsalans & Oudhs pop up. Still many prefers the differently cooked biryanis of royal, situated in Chitpur Road. You must make a try if u have not till now at least to get connected to the legacy of Kolkata food.

Heard about this place from my father and finally gave it a try on the day of rabindra jayanti. Went there with my friend and ordered mutton biryani. It wasn't as good as I expected. They don't serve alu in biryani which is very disappointing. Moreover the rice and the mutton was undercooked. Ambience was nothing special. Couldn't afford more than 2 for this place.

Pretty bad staff behavior, average food, overhyped.....that's almost everything that I have got to say about this restaurant. 
I love kolkata, and I'm always excited about its history and glory. And the royal indian hotel is a part of it. So, an overexcited me enters the restaurant, takes some time to decide what to order, staffs kept on pushing me for ordering quickly, I ordered mutton biriyani and chicken chaap, tasted okish. Nothing to brag about according to me. 
This is only my opinion, zomato is full of people praising this restaurant.....so I hope I'm wrong.

I don't think this place needs a review, must visit for biriyani lovers as they serve the authentic biriyani you might find our favourite alu missing but the taste and the melting meat will surely make it up. Their special mutton chap is a must as its unique slow cooked flavour is unbelievably mind blowing and will take you to Mughal times. 
You might not like the ambiance or the service as much but their food is not doubt up to the notch maintaining their level from the old days

I am so happy to have been introduced to this restaurant in Bara Bazar. I had Byriani, Chicken Bharta , Green Vegetables(Salad), Rumali Roti and last but not the least, Royal Special Mutton Chaap. Royal special Mutton Chaap was too delicious and properly served. The whole preparation of Mutton Chaap was damn unique. The area where Royal is located, a bit congested though, but the ambiance of Royal was sober and staffs were friendly. One advice for the novices is, in summer try to avoid the non-AC food Zone of Royal.

In main course, rumali roti and chaap is a great combination. Mutton keema is a try for all. Biriyani has its charm, nice taste but there is no aloo as it's lucknowi biriyani. At the end, firni is a good one to complement the meal üòäüòä

It may have a legacy and reputation for its chaap and biryani , but I was seriously disappointed with the taste and service offered at Royal Indian Hotel. We were catered to almost after 20 minutes upon entering the restaurant...The chaap that we ordered only had fat and masala ,barely any meat . The only saving grace was the Biryani. I am afraid they need to rework upon their magic to continue holding the good name built over the years

Went there only once and made a very bad decision of sitting on the non-ac section that is on the ground floor. The food ordered were Chicken Malai kebab,  Chicken Tikka Masala and Rumali Roti. 
I had first visited the park circus outlet and their I had liked the malai kebab very much so here also thought of placing the order. I wasn't disappointed. It was equally taste with 6 large flavoursome pieces of chicken. 
Coming to the tikka masala, it was also very tasty as quite spicy.  Anyone who doesn't like very spicy should opt for the reshmi butter masala instead of this. The rotis were like any other rumali roti. 
The ambience of the ground floor was a big let down.  The space was cramped and it is so crowded that one has to share their table with some strangers.  So basically zero privacy. 
I haven't visited the ac section yet so can't comment on that but yeah come to this place for their food but do choose the dining floor that is the upper floor for enjoying a delicious meal.

At barabazar, chitpur crossing, asked anyone about this restaurant you will get your direction.

I visited so many times, actually from that moment when Zomato didn't come also. So, I can't tell anyone that after how many times I willing to write this review.

The place is kind of Heritage of Kolkata, it is one of the oldest restaurant in the town. Basically it is famous for its Biryani, mutton chap, mutton rezala, chap & all that Mughal dishes. I tasted all the dishes it can provide (not in 1day visit).

Basically I think that the quantity of the Biryani is not adequate at all after paying the price. Because in Kolkata it's competitors are like #arsalan #aminia are providing a bit more to satisfy your hunger in a single plate. Kolkata is a hot place, they are maintaining there Heritage look it's coll but sometimes‚Äã they are not offered also the AC cabin where reasons are like technical fault or lack of service boys. This only decrease my count of presence in that restaurant.

Royal's biryani beats Arsalan's, anyday. Period. Quantity is lesser, though. Just the perfect amount. The Menu has been updated and the price has been hiked just a bit. Rice and meat was cooked perfectly. The tandoori chicken was tasty and the pieces were huge. The Chicken Chaap was alright, but the gravy is unbelievably tasty and goes very well with the biryani. Service is fast and they always serve fresh food. Definitely recommended if you're bored with Arsalan.

Visited this place last week on Saturday while I was returning home from a long trip. Whilst Howrah greeted me with its scorching heat and dust, it took us around 10 minutes to reach this place. Finding this place wasn't a hassle.
Upon entering, it felt a little old place that retained a certain regal charm to itself. We were crazily hungry and before we could even wash our hands, we hurriedly ordered the food. 2 plates of mutton biryani with mutton rezala.
We were served our food within 5 minutes. I guess the humble waiter fathomed our state. And we continued hogging on...
Biryani: the rice was beautifully cooked, and best part was that, it felt extremely light on the stomach. To us, it was very non-oily, aka healthy. The meat was very tender, soft and it had a delicious aroma that lingered to the mutton fibres. I, however, felt that the meat might have been a little undercooked because it was dark red in colour. Initially, that did freak me out though. 
Mutton Rezala: cannot complain about the meat (or its colour here!). It was perfect. The food was simply regal.

Even when we really done, we couldn't miss ordering two plates of firni. It's been 4 days and I still am not over it!

Have grown up having food here every weekend almost .... I adore the incredible taste of the unique mutton chap üòçüòçüòç that's my love , if I call so ... But ... After a period of 3 weeks again had food from royal last Friday, their mutton chap n chicken biryani .. but it came to a surprise to me, dat the authenticity of the food lost somewhere ...!!!! 
The taste of the biryani was not at all the same ... N even the rice I guess was not of the good quality. As the rice of the biryani is long n the biryani colour too was different ... The chap was good but the taste was not upto their standards. 
P.s : Royal is my ultimate favourite muglai restaurant but I hope they look into n alwaz maintain their quality of food üòçüòçüòç

It's a great place to go to with friends or family if you have a monetary crunch. Food is reasonable and extremely tasty. What's best is they serve in huge quantities and their service is extremely prompt as the restaurant is always busy. Coming to the food, we had :

Chicken biriyani - Good propertions with again good pieces of chicken. The rice was flavourful and tasty. I give it a 5/5
Mutton biryani - It was as good as the chicken biryani and was served with good big pieces of mutton. I also give it a 5/5.
Mutton chaap- It's one of their signature dishes and for good reason. Made in a rich gravy , shredded pieces of mutton , it's a very tasty dish and a must try at Royal. I give it a 3.5/5
Chicken bharta- Another one of its signature dishes. A methi based gravy made of shredded pieces of chicken. Extremely tasty. I give it a 4/5.

Overall experience was very good and I frequently visit this place.

My first independent visit to Royal was in 1995. My father was a Royal fan. He was a great Mughlai- food connoisseur. Ilearned from him and exploring Mughlai food joints regularly in Kolkata and outside. I never found mutton chaap as good as they prepare. My goodness! I can't stop even after having 2, 3 plates with few couples of rumali rotis. Even I love royal's biryani very much. As much as the beef biryani of Aafreen of metiaburz. Royal's biriyani is sophisticated and subtle. Its very simple with a piece of mutton and a plate of almost white rice. Marvellous. The service in the ac floor is far better than earlier. Price is becoming higher though. It will be injustice if I don't mention the awesome halim they make at the time of ramzan. Lot more to say but not more today. 4 for food only. Rest is for improved service.

1. Staffs didnt pay any heed to the orders.
2. Biryani was served cold
3. Rumali rotis were reheated in ovens and served to us...made sound like chips
4. Mutton chaap(their speciality) was served cold.
5. Spoons were wiped in curtains before been given to us...
6. Nobody is present there to pay any heed to our complains
I had a better review about the hotel before this incident but i totally disagree with it now

Item: 3 mutton biriyani, 2 chicken chap, 1 mutton chap, 1 salad, 2 firni, 1 shahi tukra.
Price: 1200+ 
Description: Went there for lunch with friends. They do have separate ac and non ac area. We went for the non ac one. Now coming to the food; biriyani was cooked in Lucknow style and contained biriyani rice and 1 big piece of mutton. But the biriyani was a bit oily. Liked the chicken and mutton chap. Firni was very mild and was not that sweet in taste. But I did like the shahi tukra; it's taste was really good..

A must try..puro awadhi taste.. biriyani also with out aloo.
Mutton Pasinda and chap both are rich in spice and taste mind boggling..

Total bill amount is around 1000 (no tax required)

You can try get family cabin for privacy.. staffs are very helpful and follow the brief orders.

Located in the busy Nakhoda Mosque area of Chitpur, Royal Indian Hotel is one of the ooldest biryani joints in town. IT serves Awadhi biryani instead of the more ubiquitous Kolkata biryani which means that it has no potato or egg. Being an ardent lover of the potato in a biryani, this had been a point of slight concern for me. Nevertheless, I visited it for lunch with a few friends. The decor is modest and exudes an old-world charm.

We ordered what a first-timer ought to order here : ¬†the mutton biryani , the mutton chaap and the chicken chaap. All the food reached the table within 5 minutes of ordering which is a huge plus. The biryani has to be one of the best I've had in Kolkata. A perfectly balanced subtle ¬†flavour which does not overpower the palate, I most certainly did not miss the potato in the dish. While the mutton chaap was strictly okay, the chicken chaap had an amazing flavour. They use dalda in their cooking which makes the fats harden up pretty quickly, but it is unlikely your food would last that long, it is that good.

In addition to great, quick service, the value for money here is excellent too. Quite different from the more ubiquitous biryani chains all over Kolkata, Royal still firmly hold its ground in the biryani domain and, I hope, will continue to do so for many more years to come.

Was here a few days back and it was as good as I hoped it would be. One of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata, Royal doesn't need an introduction from me. 
In this visit, we ordered tandoori rotis, mutton queema, kadai chicken, Royal mutton chanp and Royal mutton biryani. I would not go into dish by dish details as all of the above items have left me wanting more. I loved all the items. The ambiance was good, and price was standard. So all in all it was a great experience.

This iconic place certainly needs no introduction! ROYAL is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata, started its operations much before the likes of Shiraz, Arsalan, Aminia etc. Had bookmarked this place few months back and siezed the opportunity to drop by while visiting the Bara Bazaar area for some work.

It's bang opposite the Nakhoda mosque, so an easy to locate place. Once we reached there, took a long flight of stairs to the first floor seating area which is air-conditioned. There are also old fashioned non-ac cabins. So people can choose as per their convenience. The food was served within five minutes of placing the order and we dug inüò∏

‚èπRumali Roti - It was how it should it, soft an paper thin.

‚èπMUTTON CHAP - Royal being known for its chap, we decided to go for it. The boneless mutton pieces were succulent, moderately spiced and not too greasy. It's actually difficult to make out where the gravy ends and the meat starts, such is the smoothness. I didn't quite realize at first, but a few seconds into the chap I had already downed two glasses of water, my poor little taste buds were literally onüî•üî•

‚èπCHICKEN BIRYANI - Was compelled to order the Biriyani to get some relief from the mutton chap and I relished every bit. The Biriyani rice here is little more yellow colored, was cooked to perfection, with right amount of spices and mildly aromatic. The huge chunk of the chicken piece was tender and well seasoned. The rice came without the chunk of 'Aloo', (a MUST in Biryanis here in Kolkata) which was a blessing because I always tend to exclude it while ordering. Just a small glitch, the rice didn't seem to be of superior quality as it was missing that extra long fine texture. So, certainly not the best Biriyani I have had.

‚èπFIRNI - It had a creamy texture with mild sweetness. Thus added a nice finishing to our meal!

The food I would say is not exceptional but reasonably priced. Would like to visit this place again to try out other side dishes and of course for it's irresistible Biriyani!! üòªüòª

Royal Indian Hotel in Bura Bazar is one of the finest place in this area. Very popular for their Biryani. I went here recently and tried their Mutton Biryani which is much talked about. The Biryani was damn good. Price seemed bit high Rs.180 but quality was fine. We also had Mutton keema and Roti both were really goo

Royal Indian Hotel is one of the place to dine in at Bara Bazar area. The restaurant is close to the crossing of Zakaria Street and Rabindra Sarani. Spreaded over two floor Royal Indian Hotel is much know for their Biryani.
I visited here for lunch. Wanted to order Mutton Razella but unfortunately it wasn't available. Then we ordered Mutton Keema and Chicken Liver. Mutton Keema was excellent, Chicken Liver average. We had Rumali Roti with it.
Coming to the best part of this place. Mutton Biryani ! Yes they are known to make best Biryani. A plate of Mutton Biryani cost Rs.180, quality was superior. Mutton piece was lage enough. But somewhere I felt that the quality is bit less and also felt that Biryani is bit highly priced.
Service was good enough.

Don't think it is old and shabby. It's not the posh looking restaurant either, but it's air conditioned now (though you can choose to sit in the non ac portion. It doesn't add the luxury tax there). The food is absolutely delicious, and unique from all other restaurants. I will strongly recommend what it is most popular for -

A cult name as far as Biriyani of Kolkata is conferences. It's Mutton chap is also considered as World Famous. But seriously speaking over the last few years it has deteriorated as far as the taste of biriyani is concerned. But still it's better than many other who are famous for Biriyani. The mutton was tender and soft. Only missing this was the Calcutta Aloo which is actually the uniqueness of Kolkata Biriyani.

The place offers best biryani and mutton pasinda it is one of the oldest restraunt and offers very good food. The only drawback of this place is lack of renovation and bad quality service. The biryani here is very different from other places there is no egg or potato in it but it is delicious.

Situated Just opposite Iconic Nakhoda Masjid on Rabindra Sarani Royal Indian Hotel may be best Restuarent which serve authentic awadhi food in Kolkata since last 111 years.
Even Masterchef Padamshri Imtiaz Qureshi,the God of Awadhi Dumpukht cooking is a fan of Royals Biriyani and chap...

If you really wanna have a taste of lakhnow then  no other restuarent in Kolkata can amaze your taste buds  like Royal can.

I just look for opportunity to visit this place... 
As the Parkstreet was buzzing with crowds on 25th 2016 we planned for Royal..

We ordered mutton Biriyani ,Mutton Pasinda Kabab, Mutton Chap, Salad.

Royals Biriyani doesn't have any ALU and egg unlike every  Calcutta Biriyani, Rice is perfectly  flavoured, fluffy,silky in texture, mildly spiced and have a complete diff taste which will presently amaze you.

Mutton Chap is in small pieces, taste awesome,marinated mutton cooked in ghree in a patila (shallow Cooper pan).

but the Star of the Show is Mutton pasinda kabab( available only on Wednesday,Friday,Sunday)
Boneless pasinda cut of mutton cooked with exotic spices and sandal powder in ghee. Taste heavenly with Romali roti.

Dish which are Recomended 
1.Mutton Pasinda Kabab
2. Mutton Biriyani
3.Mutton Chap
4. Nargisi Kofta
5. Shahi Tukra.

Being a food lover, i always wanted to visit the place which introduced chicken chap to this city. After visiting i have mixed feelings about the Royal Indian Hotel. This is a legendary place serving more than 100 years.

Decor was traditional kolkatan mughlai resturant style, which is good in its own way. 

Now about the food, we ordered reshmi kabab, nargisi kofta, mutton biriany, chicken chap, butter naan. Naan was soft and tasted good. Chicken chap was beautiful, juicy and delicious. Nargisi kofta was also good. The kabab was also very good. I loved the spicyness in the food.  Now about the biriany......it was also goos, but not the best in the city. 

In conclusion i would say if you are a food lover like me, and you love kabab and chap as much as i do, you should visit this place.

The best Chaap and biryani in kolkata,
Easily better than Nizam .While Arsalan lovers might argue, but for me its one of the best.

I had chaap(mutton) and Rumali roti which were the star of the show and then the biryani(mutton). I never had a biryani which had such tender meat.In dessert the firni is  good but if you are having desserts then I would highly recommend the shahi tukra, it is just amazing and it's only available on Thursdays I believe  I'm not sure but do check it up and try it out .

For authentic Mughlai Biriyani, this is a one stop for sure. I heard about it a lot, it‚Äôs one of the oldest places in Kolkata which serves mouthwatering mughlai food. The overall interior is very much simple as they only focus on their food. We ordered Chicken Reshmi Malai Kebab as starters and then Mutton Biriyani , Chicken Chaap, Nargisi Kofta for the main course. The kebab was amazingly prepared laced with the right blend of spices. For a spice lover like me, the biriyani was a great combination of perfectly cooked meat in rice that was neither too oily nor too heavy. Next up was the Nargisi Kofta which was oval in shape, made with mutton keema having an egg in the middle. The beauty of it was mutton part which was very soft and spicy. The slightest smell will make your mouth water. Well this place is very famous for its Chicken Chaap and undoubtedly it won our heart too. Just prepared with the perfect amount of spices and the Chicken Chaap was very tender made this dish special for me. Lastly, after having such a scrumptious meal Firni & Shahi Tukda will take you to a different level altogether.

Thank you for the wonderful Biryani. We loved it!

A legendary restaurant. They have been serving Biriyani since eternity and the quality is really "royal". They have not incorporated a single new dish to their menu in the last decade,and they probably never will.But each and every dish made out there in the kitchen is a gem. The Qeema is delicious,so is the Chaap.
Their special dishes -Nargisi Kofta ,Bharta and Rogan Josh are not daily items and you need multiple visits to try out all of them,but it is definitely worth it.
The Biriyani is sinful.It is perfectly cooked,moderately spiced and the mutton pieces are succulent .It keeps you craving for more.
The side dishes are oily and spicy to the core ,but that is exactly why you want to go there,isn't it?¬†

Recommendations- Mutton Biriyani,Chicken Chaap,Mutton Qeema

On 1st Jan'17 I was having Lunch at Royal India Hotel Pvt Ltd (Kolkata) and the bill furnished by them was Rs.377.

As soon as I took out my credit card to pay the bill; they added Rs.25 extra to the bill for credit card payment and charged me Rs.402 tough the previous bill price already included 14.5% VAT as stated in their bill.

A very old food joint in Kolkata, Royal is best known for, biryani ,mutton chap, mutton pasinda kebab (This one is my favourite) and shahi tukra . In biryani you wont get "Alu" which is specialty of Kolkata biryani. The chap is not the usual type its dry and spicy. Mutton pasinda kebab is minced mutton with spicy gravy, its boneless and a must try in Royal. This place has a special aroma which will attract you to dig in if you passing by near of it. Its not a good idea to dine in as the ambiance is poor and service equally is not that good. Take-away is the best option.

A legendary name in the arena of mughlai cuisine. Neither did it disappoint us but neither swept us off our feet. The ambience was on the better side. The service was rather good. Now coming to the food, the quantity & quality both are average. Had ordered- Chicken Biriyani, with Kadhai Chicken, some Roomali Rotis and to end with Firni.
The biriyani was hot and the spices were light. The rice used was of really premium quality (and that is certainly in comparison to others in the market). The chicken was soft and seasoned. No potato or egg is involved as they present it in authentic Lucknow style (i guess). I liked it but my friend felt it was rather bland. So taste will definitely vary with people. But that was made up by the rather spicy kadhai chicken. Nothing special again but Well cooked and enjoyable. Roomali rotis, well nothing to write about them, they were brought in as fillers because the quantity of biriyani was just not plenty for Gluttony Hungry MEN. The firni was good and creamy and light. Maybe the firni was the best, and gave the "nothing so special" show a sweet ending.
Despite being good it comes down to average because the name it boasts gradually wanes when we actually go in, and "others" in the market have meanwhile taken up the top spots. If not for repeats ek visit to banta hi hai :)

Have heard a lot about this place, may some decades back it was the best of its time.
My recent visit to the hotel was not very appealing as much hyped it is. You have to climb some steep stairs to get to the dining hall and the A/c restaurant.
The briyani we ordered lacked spices and didn't have the famous Kolkata style aloo in it. So being to many other cities and having tasted many biriyani I couldn't actually say if it was the Kolkata style, awadh style or moradabadi or hyderbadi style. The tandoori roti was soft n nice, the Chicken Butter masala was bit on the sweeter side. Overall the quantity is sufficient for one person or may be 1adult and 1child.
Ambience is just average, nothing much to say as there is nothing. 
Service is quick but more often you have to scan for the waiters for few min.

The place is not too difficult to find but really far from my place! But I was promised better biriyani than arsalan! I mean who dare challenge their biriyani. 
But it's time I switch my side from Arsalan to Royal because the biriyani to the Mutton Chap, everything was just too good to mention. The Mutton Chap was really spicy but it's worth it. Loved it!!!!
I don't usually eat firni but this time I used my fingers to eat whatever left in the firni katora.
*Huge fan*

The name itself describes the heritage of this wonderful place. Royal indian hotel truly delivers everything a true biriyani lover prefers to have i.e. good food, efficient service & ofcourse the old charm of north kolkata.

This place is located on rabindra sarani near nakhoda masjid(10mins walk from mg road crossing). The place has huge sitting arrangements ranging from ground floor to 1st floor with both a.c & non a.c rooms.

We got ourselves the following items:-

1. Chicken malai kebab - Juicy soft malai kebabs served with onions & pudina chutney. The dish had 7pcs. This was just heavenly to gorge upon. The charring didn't overpower the taste & the coating of malai gave a soft spongy bite to it. Recommended

2. Chicken tikka kebab - Again a classic kebab dish for those who love their kebabs spicy. This also had 7pcs & was served with onions and pudina chutney. The kebabs were delicate & the marination of kebab masala was spot on.

3. Rumali roti

4. Chicken biriyani - The biriyani was really the highlight of the meal. Can still imagine the taste & aroma of the rice. The biriyani was extemely light on taste & quantity was just right for a single person. The chicken piece was very tender. They don't serve potato which might not be loved by a person but seriously it could be ignore since the biriyani itself would mesmerise you.

5. Mutton biriyani - Same as chicken biriyani.

6. Chicken bharta - A speciality of this place which was well worth the hype. Very creamy & it would just tantalise your taste buds. Shreds of chicken was served with half boiled egg over a thick creamy coriander based gravy. Loved it spoonful of it. Recommended

7. Royal mutton chap - Very different & unique chap of mutton. Here they serve a bit dry shredded version of mutton chap. The taste just won me over. The mutton was properly cooked & the chap masala was just awesome. Recommended

8. Firni - Classic cold finisher which most of us cherish after a hearty mughlai meal. The firni wasn't too sweet nor too bland which was perfect. It was smooth & properly set.

9. Shahi tukda - To sum this up i would have to say "Simply the best". A hot dessert which i'm sure most of you have had it before but trust me this one takes away the cake. The taste was simply divine & we preferred this over the firni. We even ended up taking another 2 plates of it.

After the long list of items, we were overwhelmed with the quality of food. They charged vat & service tax(since we were seated in the a.c room; not sure about non-a.c rooms). The service stood out for me. The food came in quickly & the attendants were very attentive. The place is also pocket friendly since all the items cost about 2200 INR. They also accept card payments. So all in all please be sure to visit this place to have some royal mughlai experience!!

Wow, so it‚Äôs already the last day of 2016. Happy New Year in advance to you guys. Okay so let‚Äôs not waste any more time. Let‚Äôs start with the restaurant. I was going to the restaurant from Girish Park Metro side. The road which Google Maps suggested me to the Royal Indian Hotel was muddy, and I didn‚Äôt have the courage to go ahead on that path. So I would advise you to take the way from Central Avenue along the tram line. That is the main road and that it‚Äôs safe as well.

Yes today I finally went to this Kolkata's one favorite biriyani stop. But very frankly, I was not so impressed. I found the food quality & taste very average. Mutton biriyani was light & tasty, but the special "aloo" was missing in the biriyani. The firni was just..nothing worth. They served the chicken chaap cold, we had to ask them to reheat again. The ambience price & everything else was okay. I really expected a lot about this famous place, but heart broken.

This place holds a very special place in my heart. The blend and essence of biriyani is on other level. Very popular among locals. Biriyani is a singnature food of this place and mutton chaap. I can't really tell about the other items. This place is also pocket friendly. Whenever I am arround that place for some work its a must visit for me.

Royalty is not only in it's name but also in its cuisines and ambience. Devided in two parts one in ground floor which was non ac and other was in first floor fully air conditioner and designed and decorated with royalty. Famous for it's biryani but being a vegetarian can't try this so we have their paneer butter masala with rumali roti which was tastes really delicious. In last we tried their firni which was heavenly.

This place always had a niche over other Biryani serving restaurants for me until the last and probably my final visit there. The biryani in the my post looked as endearing as it could but once I dug in, the rice was sloppy and the moist chicken had dripped enough oil into the rice. Hoping to get an explanation I reached out to a staff who outright refused to even listen what the issue was! After a heated argument, he drew the conclusion that I should have mentioned that I want the upper dry portion of the biryani.. That took me by a shock! Who does that.. He stormed out with my plate of biryani and what he brought back was another side dish with two spoon full of plain white rice! One experience that left me angry, disgusted and disappointed.....

Gist : Biriyani bit over hyped but still good, chicken chap is great and outstanding, hence recommended.

I visited this place on 05.11.16 around 11.00AM for takeaway order. Bit hard to locate as road was crowded. Decor or ambience is not worth mentioning. Seating place is big. Staffs are well behaved. Ordered Mutton Biriyani & Chicken Chap. They packed it within 10 minutes though the place were slightly crowded. After reaching home found out packing was good. Biriyani was good but not outstanding or maybe the reason was I ate after 30 minutes of packing the same. But at the same time chicken chap was heavenly. With every bite of chicken & every sip of gravy , butter was tasted. Revisit required to taste other delicacies.

How do you review a legend? You just succumb to its delights.... The amazing biryani... Ofcourse mutton.. the mutton was of brilliant quality and falling off the bones! The only complaint I always have with them is the lack of aloo!!! The mutton chaanp and roolamli roti is legendary and ofcourse that was on the menu too!!! Only thing we didnt have was the rezala! Let us save it for thr next visit!!! Royal will forever remain my favourite... Pocket pinch very reasonable... But I am sure most of you know that already!!!

An age old place in Kolkata that serves biriyani. Located at rabindra sarani, this is a place with heritage, a hundred and ten year old restaurant. 
I visited this place with my family and was fascinated to find the cabin system still in practice. 
We ordered chicken reshmi kebab and it was the best kebab I've had had till date. The kebabs were absolutely tender and perfectly spiced. 
We also had mutton boti kebab which was a bit tough. The royal special mutton biriyani was undoubtedly amazing. Also, the slow cooked, tender mutton chhanp requires special mention. Overall it was a nice experience, but service could have been better.

If you are fond of moglai dishes specially biriyani and mutton chapp you have to come to Kolkata and Have it in Royal Indian hotel Near Nakhuda Masjid Kolkata. I used to travelled a lot and I am foody. I have tasted biriyani in hydrabad and Lucknow, but nothing like Royal Indian hotel, Kolkata. The taste and quality they are maintaining since near about 100 years. specially those who have tried their Mutton Biriyani and Mutton chap they are coming back again and again for the heavenly taste and the superb quality. The behavior of the staffs are also excellent. The price is also within the limit of a middle calss people. So If u are a biriyani lover pls vist Kolkata and have it in Royal. I am assuring you that will be your life time experience for sure.

Highly overhyped hotel. I am working in Bangalore where I have tried various biryanis. I can say this biryani is okish but for a 200 bucks biryani you get single medium piece of chicken which is not at all good. Hotel is too pricey even if you pricey biryani with single piece should not be given. Same is the case with chicken curry its single piece ans some gravey. We also tried mutton keema which was in taste and quantity was ok for 2. Won't recommend wasting money on this.

Had been on the wishlist for quite sometime. Finally went to their Burrabazar outlet. There are separate AC and non-AC seating areas. Food tasted great, and the service was quite quite fast. Some of the junior staff can be quite unprofessional though. Overall, a good experience.  With

Revised Review after last experience.

Location Description: What to say about this place. Just like its name "Royal".

I am a die hard fan of Biriyani served here. just too wow.... Always crowded with people with serving is non stop. 

Ambience and Staff: its has 2 sitting arrangements non a.c downstairs and Non A.c &  A/c upstairs for family.Waiters are quick to take your order and placing it to your to your table quickly.

Food: Had the Tandoori chicken, which was burnt a little and taste wise it was ok. Biryani was pathetic, served cold and when asked why the server misbehaved. The quality of the food have fallen dramatically.

QNQ & Prices: Quality and quantity of this resto has been good always but now this place runs only on the name brand . Prices are pocket friendly.

Conclusion: Biriyani lovers should have a try here. The  service has just diasppointed me. The server was rude and unprofessional.

Was Recommended from my side to have a lunch or dinner before but not now anymore

Located between Burrabazar Chitpur Crossing & Nakhoda mashjid. Both AC & Non AC dining spaces are there. Some staffs are professional and some are not. Coming to the foods, the heritage Biriyani of Royal, the taste has been deteriorated. Most of the special side dishes contain excessive oil floating. Kababs and Firni are good enough.

Indian heritage. Kolkata biriyani heritage.
The old feeling of old kolkata and the smell of ghee is just pure bliss. But I would like to mention the mutton chaap, paratha and saahi tukra. Too good , bit rich and oily though.

This place serves their signature dish the mutton chanp. The biriyani they serve is a bit different from typical Kolkata biriyani but yes it's very tasty. Sometimes all u need is a plate of mutton biriyani,a plate of mutton chanp and few rumali rotis from Royal to rejuvenate urself.

Visited this place after reading good reviews on Zomato. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed.
Coming to the food, we ordered chicken tandoor, chicken and mutton biriyani, chicken chaap and mutton pasinda kebab, firni, shahi tukra. 

Chicken Tandoor : Dissapointed big time, neither it was tender nor it tasted good.
Biriyani : Attention Alu lovers, no Alu in biriyani. But, biriyani was something to remember for long time. It was great. Mutton and chicken pieces were tender and well cooked. 
Chicken Chaap : If, anything that goes with their biriyani, its their chaap. Must try. 
Mutton Pasinda Kebab: It was the special item of the day. Tempted by the reference from zomato, we ordered one, and we were not disappointed. 
Firni and Shahi Tukra : Firni was normal, but Shahi Tukra was heavenly. 

The ambience was good and staffs were friendly. 

Finally, the overall experience was good,@ but I was shocked to experience such level of chicken tandoor with a 4.1 zomato rating.

Quality if biryani is good but no aloo in Kolkata biryani üòë the champ was not actually champ but small pieces of bone and seemed more of botti item kind of and tasted bitter due to probably star anise or burnt onion usage.Staff is good but too much focussed on customers may be to grab the tips, can't expect an elderly staff and doesnot seem right for a waiter to come and shift your roti with hands from one plate to other.

A friend and I were headed to Ezra street to buy lights for an apartment renovation, and realized that the original Aminia had closed (coinciding with the opening of their Salt Lake branch). Since we were already in a biryani frame of mind by then, we walked down the street to Royal, which I haven't visited in several years.¬†Good biryani, but not better than India Restaurant down by the docks. The romali roti is excellent. But the rezala is a hidden gem; truly one of (if not the) best I've had. It actually displaces the chicken chaap as the best gateway drug for that biryani; it's that good. Excellent service, very attentive waiter, and both of us almost fell asleep before working through two biryanis, a chaap, that insane rezala, and a few romali rotis. They do a special mutton tikka chaap some days; I should head back and give that a shot. This place is a must-do if you're in the area, though it's a bit of a trip to get there if you're not, even if you already live on the north side of town.

After being listening to all the positive reviews about this place since ages, finally visited Royal last year. Located near Nakhoda Mazjid, this place is a very old outlet having 2 floors for seating arrangement. The interior and ambience is way too simple, nothing to do with any kind of decoir. But the food makes up for everything else!! The biryani over here is toooo good, one of the bests in town. I have been here only once and have tried their Chicken Biryani and Chicken Chaanp. The latter is no less as well.... the gravy tasted like Mutton Tikiya to me.... extremely tasty!!! Quality of food is indeed remarkable!

' Ultimately totally deliciously madly in love with this place ' should be the tag line to go ..It's been an absolute favourite since childhood the aroma of the biryani is so breathtaking that even if I am standing in a distance from this place I can smell the food of the place ... though in this outlet of the restaurant there are three dinning spaces one is near the billing for the take away others are both in the first floor were one section is AC and the other one is a Non-AC . 
If you want the comfortable space then go in for the AC section . The food is just awesome may it be the tandoori chicken  or the firni(dessert) or the biryani without the potato (that's the specialty)‚ù§Ô∏è.If you are still among those people who haven't tried it yet then please go you people will love it ... in north the outlet is in Barabazar and in the south it's near quest mall ... go go and just go you have to try it .

1. Roti were too big to finish, I recommend 2 and a half for 1 person.
2. Mutton keema if ordered 2 is enough for 3 (atleast I felt).
3. Salad was good.

Located in barabazar this place is since 1905 .. when i entered the ambience was really good .. we had our seats in a cabin with 7 members.. we first ordered the biryani and the mutton chap both the items were out of the mark.. but specially to mention about the the chap which is worldclass the biryani was to light ..
Afterwards we ordered firni and sahi tukra .. the firni was good .. but the sahi tukra forced us to have one more which we packed and bought home...
Altogether an awesome day awesome food.. tummy full ..thank you royals for making our day...

Located opposite to Burra Masjid, Zakaria Street on Rabindra Sarani this is another one of my local restaurant. The awesome biriyani and other mughlai dishes are the showstopper for the local foodies. Each grain of rice in the biriyani are standalone taste bombs. The chaap, chicken bharta, tikka butter masala and the kebabs are my absolute favorite. But I have one of their delicacies on my wishlist - "The nargisi kofta". Will visit soon to fulfill the wish of my stomach.

Dropped in here to conclude our Ramadan walk. Surprisingly the AC Section was kind of vacant. Ordered for Mutton Biryani, Mutton Chaap, Shahi Tukda and Cold Drinks. The rice grains in the Biryani was fresh and soft, but the Mutton portion was disappointing. With no aloo, the semi-spicy Chaap came in as savior. Perfect juicy dicing of Mutton combined with the flavorful Biryani rice. It was pure bliss. The Shahi Tukda was exceptional, with us ordering it 3-4 times. The service was prompt.

This is one of the most famous mughlai restuarants in kolkata. Situated in burra bazar, near MG rd Metro station. The specialty is their chap (mutton or Chicken) which is heaven for meat lovers . Chap goes really well with both roti or biriyani. Biriyani is their other specialty and is slightly different from other famous restaurants of kolkata. They dont give potatoes in biriyani, though is delicious and mutton will melt in your mouth. 

This 100+ years food outlet is not for ambience. This is all about great food.

All that glitters is not Gold!! How appropriate is that line for the 'Royal Indian Restaurant'.
My family was waiting for some lipsmacking biriyani and chaanp for the 15th Aug dinner... I went there to bring back the food parcels, the long queue outside only added to the much known hype about this historical outlet. But soon after, we were cursing the food.. Easily Shiraz or Alibaba or Arsalan could beat this taste. The mutton biriyani was hot and spicy, yet lacked the distinct flavour of Biriyani we are accustomed to, in Kolkata. They do not include the potato either. Aminia's chicken chaanp is far better to taste than Royal's. The pieces were small, the gravy was sticky and had the dominating flavour of Bengal gram flour (sattu/chatu). 
To sum up, this was the first and the last time that I tried something from the great Royal Indian Restaurant!

One of the most famous mughlai eateries of a city that takes its Biryani very seriously. Located near Nakhoda masjid (closest metro station : MG Road) you can spot the restaurant very easily. The seating arrangement is upstairs, so u have to take the stairs that, from down there, looks to be going straight to heaven. There is both AC and non AC seating arrangements, normally you will get a seat but you might have a queue on the festival days and main holidays. Once inside you soak in all the different aromas, decide the menu and place the order. Pat comes the delivery, this place has one of the quickest delivery times that I have seen. The food is superb, be it the Biryani or the sides. My recommendation here would be the Mutton chap, cut into small portions (almost looks like shredded) and yes it tastes fantastic, also there is no problem of division and all the bickering about the wrong portions of the meat. In the Biryani, you can go for either Mutton or chicken, but personally I would prefer the Mutton and yes the meat portion that comes with the Biryani is a huge one. Only thing though, they have done away with the Kolkata special Alu. The Mutton rezala here is also a thing of beauty and a must try. Today they were in the mood of distributing free Coke bottles for every plate of Biryani, which was a lovely gesture and u soo need the fizz after such a meal.
One thing that I mind here is the quantity of Biryani per plate, most often I have to order 2 for myself and even my parents today had 1.5 plate each. So yeah that apart everything about this place is very good.
Would love coming back here, time and again.

Yeah well! The Biriyani. A dissapointment would be an understatement for an establishment of this stature. I mean it features in the legendary boards!! The mutton biriyani felt like biriyani flavoured rice and a piece of hastily prepared mutton. The mutton chaap was indeed special and savoury but apart from that was an utter dissapointment. May be if the expectation wouldn't have been big, the food could be called tasty.

Dropped down to feed my tired and hungry soul today. Royal is known for their famous biryani and they live up to the name and don't abuse the brand and trust of the consumer. 
They are giving a free 200ml coke with every order of biryani and it just couldn't get better.
Had mutton biryani and mutton chaanp. 
The biryani was perfect. There is no other word to describe it. The mutton piece was soft and succulent and the best part was that it was not stuck in between the mouth after having it. 
The mutton chaanp tasted well but the pieces were disappointing. Mostly bones with very little meat on them.
My 4 is solely on the biryani! :-)
Had packed a chicken biryani for my sister as well.

Went to this oldest biriyani place in Kolkata..biriyani was good ...meat was perfect but I was so surprised when I found out that they do not serve potato with biriyani...alu is an essential part of Kolkata's biriyani....according to them....its their tradition...they never serve potato...!! Mutton chaap tastes really great but quantity really sucks !

This restaurant is located at a very busy location of Bara Bazar. It is one of the most famous and popular restaurants in Kolkata.
The restaurant has seating area available on the 1st floor having both ac and non ac room. They don't charge any extra tax. Only take 2 rupees estra on each dishes. 
This time we had mutton biriyani form them. The servicing was very prompt and nice. 
Now coming to the details of the biriyani. It was certainly very flavourful and tasty having nice quality of rice. But the amount they served was very less. Hence it may not even satisfy the hunger of one person. Moreover they didn't even provide a potato with the biriyani. The mutton piece it had was quite big in size. Moreover it was completely boneless. This is the best thing about the biriyani. Although the biriyani was very dry to my liking. 
But the best thing about them is whenever you order a biriyani from them they will treat you with a free 200ml Coca-Cola. 

Overall a good experience here. Love to visit here again...

I used to visit this place from the time when I was little child,with my father obviously the ambience nd decor is not that goooood but the reason why every one visit this place is because of the mughal dishes that they make......there is some kind of magic really one can find inner peace by munching there food,and I am no different!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We ordered CHICKEN BIRIYANI,MUTTON BIRIYANI,& TANDOORI CHICKEN the tandoori was just mouth watering a splendid mix of all the Masalas and spices that any must have,lastly the chln/mutton biriyani wat to say abt them it was tooooo good in one word it touched my heart,I feel like they r the kings of making BIRIYANI no other place can be compared with them.......but one thing thing is that they had reduced the quantity of biriyani which is bad news for biriyani lovers other than that a must visit place for biriyani lovers!!!!!!!!!!!

One of the oldest among others...Royal Indian Hotel is a name that defines Kolkata's heritage in Mughlai dishes...
Situated in Bara Bazar near Nakhoda Masjid, in one of the busiest lanes in the city...
Famous for their Chanps and Biryani which is served without an Aloo...
In recent times they have opened an AC Section upstairs.Still they have the cabin system upstairs which is a non ac section...
I personally love their Mutton Chaanp and Rotis and Biryani which is bit differently cooked than other joints in town...
Old charm and better to visit on a Sunday to avoid rush...

Found it to be the most overrated restaurant. Heard a lot about it's Biryani. Had ordered 3 mutton Biryanis and all had the worst pieces of mutton in it. On complaining to the waiter, instead of admitting his fault he started giving lame excuses that its the different pieces of Mutton(Khujiya, batti etc...) Being a Non Veg lover I know how Red meat tastes so there wasn't any need of making excuses.. Would advise to go for the small restaurant near by to taste the flavor of Kolkata Biryani.. Have given 1 star just for the complementary COKE that was served with Biryani.

A brush of Old Delhi in Kolkata

So, visited this place a day before Eid-ul Fitr. Situated in one of the many serpentine bylanes of Bara Bazaar, the place crowded because of the festivities. As has been said repeatedly by fellow connoisseurs, the place is known for its old world charm and aura. We ordered the Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Mutton Qorma and the good old Chicken Tikka Masala.¬†
Being a Delhiite, I have frequented to Matia Mahal and the tastebuds brought those memories back. All the dishes were good, the Reshmi Kebab was superb. Don't expect gourmet stuff and high grade hospitality. Simple Mughlai food served with utmost authenticity is why this place works.¬†
For Kolkatans, move over Arsalan. This place has equally good food at more competitive prices.

Ambience: 3.5/5

It tops my list of the best places in town to have biriyani!! Every time my tongue tastes the first bit of it,it kind of gets addictive..yes,its that great!! The mutton is perfectly cooked and are quite large as well..the other dish that blows my mind away and will probably overdo the taste of biriyani as well is mutton chaanb.. it's heavenly!! U can never ever get over the ecstatic taste of it!! And guess what,it is too too light on your pockets!! What more can 1 ask for!..:)

This place as the name suggests, offers you a variety of Mughlai cuisine along with yummy Biriyani! The place is situated very close to the junction of MG Road and Rabindra Sarani. Its very conjested and hence parking is a big issue out here. So the best option is hire an OLA or UBER to this place. The ambience is good in the AC restaurant. There is also a non AC section which offers the same sort of service and delicacies. We orderd Mutton Biriyani along with the famous chicken chaap. The food was really yummy and was superb in taste. There is no other biriyani which can match this taste. Cold Drinks are complimentary with Biriyani, so its an added advantage. in desserts, do not miss the shaahi tukra which is also a signature dish available here. All in all a superb experience and ya very much recommendable.

If it is biriyani in Kolkata then it has to be one and only Royal's biriyani. I have visited this place quite a few times and just love their biriyani. Mutton biriyani has been my favorite. Best part is that there is no potato in the biriyani. It is extremely well cooked and the flavor is just awesome. Few might find it bit spicy compared to the other biriyanis. Apart from the biriyani I have tried the Nargisi Kofta which I found to be average. Ambiance is very simple but neat and clean. They might consider adding space to the AC zone.

Your quest for biryani comes to an end with this more than a century old legendary restaurant, located near Chitpur joint (near M.G. road).

It‚Äôs yet another hidden gem in Kolkata which has become synonymous to quality and legendary muglai cuisine. They serve one of the finest Lucknawi biryani in Kolkata. Though it is located in a very congested area in Kolkata but the food here will make you forget everything.

About the restaurant:
It‚Äôs a two-storied restaurant with different levels. The ground floor is basically for the economy class where you will get the real feel of the place. However, the one at the first floor is little expensive having both AC and non-AC section.

A piece of history:
The owner of this place is said to have descended from the rakhabdars of Nawab Wazid Ali shah. There were basically two types of cooks in nawabs kitchen-Rakhabdar and Khansama. Rakhabdars used to cook only for the Nawab and his family members while Khansama used to cook for everybody.

You will not find any potato or egg in the biryani at Royal since the usage of potato and egg was a sin for Rakhabdars to be used in biryani while it was used by the Khansama‚Äôs to feed others. The tradition is still continued at Royal even today.

Royal‚Äôs signature dishes- ‚ÄúMutton Biryani and chaap‚Äù:
Now talking about the food, I started with their Mutton biryani and mutton chaap as suggested by a friend of mine. The biryani was mild and fragrant and the mutton pieces were so tender that it really melted in the mouth. The best part of the biryani was that it was made from long grained rice and non-greasy which is a problem at other restaurants. The mutton chaap was also very amazing and it tasted nice with the rumali roti. Now I can say that this place serves one of the finest biryanis in Kolkata. The best time to come here is around 12:30-1 pm, when the biryani is freshly made.

I would not recommend to take the parcel since the dishes prepared at this restaurant is made from dalda and it would solidify if not consumed hot.

Heavenly dessert- ‚ÄúShahitukda‚Äù:
Coming to Royal is incomplete without having its signature dessert- ‚ÄúShahi Tukda‚Äù. It‚Äôs a fat, thick slice of bread soaked in rabri and topped with dry fruits. Let me tell that this is one of the finest dessert I have ever tasted and it is one of my personal favourite.

Bottomline:
Frankly speaking I got a mixed review about this restaurant but coming here and trying the dishes changed my mind. Biryani and mutton dishes were better than most restaurants in Kolkata but the Shahi Tukda was somewhat heavenly and it‚Äôs a must try dish in Kolkata. I would love to visit this place again especially for the shahi tukda.

The restaurant is situated in one of the most crowded area in the city. When you park your vehicle in front of the hotel, the lovely smell of Mutton Chap/Chicken chap will definitely tempt you :p
Jokes apart. We heard a lot about the authentic biriyani and chap items of Royal. Ordered Mutton biriyani, Mutton chap and Firni. Mutton chap is a must try. You are definitely going to miss the aloo in the biriyani but mutton was tender and the biriyani was tasty. Looking for a 2nd visit üëç

Walking through the narrow crowded lanes of barabazar I was sceptical as to how the restaurant would turn out to be... After entering it I was assured that this is not the right place to be.. However we sat down to order biryani,butter nun, mutton handi and chicken reshmi butter
 masala... The place gave me enough scope to question about the hygiene.. But once we were served.. I forgot everything... Evrybit of the journey.. From central metro.. Was worth it... Chicken Reshmi butter masala was beyond comparison.. I don't remember having anything like this b4.. In mutton hand I,mutton was very soft n well cooked... The firni in the end was mind blowing.. I would say its the best Firni I ever had... The food really won my heart,as I was feeling pretty down initially about the ambience and hygiene of the place.. I would suggest to visit the place.. Initially you may feel like me..Bt once you begin eating you will feel like coming here again.. Just like me..

Been there only yesterday. the siting arrangement is spead across 2 floors with both a/c and non a/c. We were expecting to have haleem but unfortunately it got over by the time we reached. The staff mentioned the haleem generally gets over by 6pm !! The interiors are pretty normal with courteous staff.We had ordered rumali roti with mutton rezala. Though I wont say that the rezala was great it was good, esp the mutton which was so soft and tender. We also tried the mutton biriyani. Now this biriyani is very different from what you get at Aminia or Arsalan. Yes there is no potato¬†and egg !! Taste wise it was good indeed with the mutton being very soft and tender unlike other joint. We rounded it up with firni which was ok. Considering the taste and ambience I found it marginally overpriced ...Overall its good I would say not great ..

This is one of the oldest biriyani shops in kolkata and man, is it royal! 
Their biriyani is undoubtedly the best I've had..but fair warning, it comes without the aloo. The mutton/chicken pieces are soft and well cooked!
Their speciality is the chicken chaap, the curry of which is basically like chicken tikia..it's unique and amazing! 
Their mutton rezala tastes delicious and is best paired with their rumali rotis. 
The mutton that they serve is extremely soft and tasty and non-fibrous..which is rare to find in most places.
The location is a prominent one but getting a car parking space on weekdays is almost impossible.
If you're a biriyani connoisseur, visiting this place is a must.

Review is based on the food quality.
Heard of it soo much bt nvr hd a chance to go nd dine dre until today.
Heard soo much about their special chaap nd biryani so much that I ordered both of it only.
Mutton Biryani nd Mutton chaap..
The quality I would say is really good, brilliant to be precise..
Though the mutton chap hd way too much bones..
Biryani was fantastic..

The ambience of the place sucks.. nd the staff behavior was als not very good.
Would have been good it it had AC.

That's all folks, until next time:)

I came to zakaria street to taste the Ramadan special delicacies from this area.After dropping for jalebis at liyaqat sweets and exploring the beauty of architecture at nakhoda masjid,atfirst we came to aminia outlet opposite to the mlsqu.They said haleem is only available for parcel but not for dining in until 6pm.Me and my friend was too tired and hungry from walking so we opted for an air-conditioned place for the lunch.We came at Royal Indian Hotel.We sat at the air-conditioned area and shared our table with 2 other people.Ambience was nothing special but I still rated them so high just on the basis of amazing food I tasted and the warmth of hospitality here.It's worth it.

We started with the legendary mutton biriyani here.I never thought being a hard-core bangali from kolkata I'll fall head over heels in love with this biriyani.The rice was beautifully flavoured with spices and small meat ballls replacing the aloo.And the mutton boti was so tender..just melting in mouth.
Taste wise this is the best biriyani I've tasted..It was so rich in flavour yet light to eat.I still love aloo in biriyani..but royal left me confused now where should I opt for biriyani when I'm in park circus.(they opened new outlet in that area).200ml coke is given complimentary with biriyani.This was really helpful throughout the heavy meal we had.

Then we ordered the ramadan special mutton haleem with rumali roti.We also ordered half tandoori chicken alongside.

Tandoori chicken pieces were really big but still were smoked perfectly all along not overcharred or underdone anywhere.It had a tantalising aroma and spicy taste..went very well with the green chutney on side.

About the course of haleem and rumali roti..This was the first time I tried haleem.The masala and lemon was given separately.Our server suggested us to add the masala according to our taste and the squeeze the lemon juice.My first experience with haleem was wasn't disappointing at all.The pulses were ground finely to give it a smooth consistency.The flavour was creamy,rich but not too spicy.The bowl of haleem had a very homely comforting touch to it. Here also the mutton pieces were very soft.Soft rumali rotis were perfect accompaniment to it..although I love it so much I digged into the bowl with a spoon and had a lot of it on its own only. :P

Even though we were quite full we didn't miss out the dessert by any chance since it was Friday and we were lucky that their special shahi tukda was available.It was quite big in portion.And about the taste..every bite was like a piece of heaven! It had such a lovely aroma of kesar and ghee..topped with lots of chopped almonds.It had such a beautiful flavour that can't be described in words.One of the best dessert I've ever tasted..It left me drooling for eternity.

Service was very fast..we are thankful that we didn't have to wait much with hungry stomach.Our server was a warm and nice man who listened to all our particular requirements patiently and fulfilled them promptly with a smiling face.It's difficult for me to go to this outlet but surely I'll pay visits to the park circus one many times in future to devour on biriyani,shahi tukda and many more mughlai dishes.

But trust me when I say this , with the first spoonful you will forget your surroundings!! A must, must try place for all biryani lovers and non-lovers too :P

My father feels always nostalgic whenever he talks about this restro as he has lots of college day's memories with this place. Went with my father yesterday and what he exactly said after sitting in the chair is like "as roja is going on, we are able to get an empty table, otherwise it's next to impossible to get it without waiting in queue, and I'm used to wait at the queue from downstairs during my college days.

Coming to the food, we ordered mutton biriyani and mutton curry, salad, rumali roti and firni. Nothing to say about the biriyani as everyone knows that Royal is actually "ROYAL" for it. Mutton curry was very tasty and muttons were soft and juicy, melted in mouth. I'll specially mention about firni, it was jafrani firni, I've tried firni in many authentic restro, but here it was simply out of the world.

Staffs were very polite. Highly recommend.

I tried only their Biryani which was excellent in taste. I must say that it is one of the best Biryani in Kolkata. I tried both Royal Chicken And Royal Mutton Biryani. They served both the Biryani without Potato which was a little uncomfortable for me. But after tasting it, it was really amazing. Potato is not required as it was excellent in taste. The quantity was also good. Chicken and Mutton pieces were soft and perfectly cooked.
One of the Best place in Kolkata to Have Biryani.
Highly recommended to all Biryani lovers.

This is a legendary place as far as Mughlai cuisine is concerned. It's located on a congested one way road, but is absolutely worth travelling for and the trouble.¬† The ground floor dining room is simple non ac, but they do have two dining rooms in the first floor. Unfortunately the better and the AC one remains open only for lunch and dinner. I sincerely hope one day they will decide to keep it open all day. 

Service here is no nonsense and fast. Though they are famous for the biryani and chanp, they make awesome kebabs too. So next time you are there, don't miss ordering a chicken reshmi. Biryani here is served without the potato. It is lighter and very flavourful. Pair it with a plate of mutton chanp (no chicken chanp please. If it is chanp, it has to be mutton). Divine combo. Add the oil of the chanp to the biryani and savour what is truly a royal experience. 

Most of the times I stick to the biryani and chanp here, so have not tried their other dishes much. But tried their Nargisi Kofta once and it was just OK.

For dessert you must, must try their Shahi Tukra. It is undoubtedly the best available in Kolkata. Served in a box with almond flakes and silver varak, it a rich, melt in your mouth experience, which you must never miss when here.

There are few cons too for which I could not give this place the 4.5 I wanted to. Firstly the AC dining room not kept open throughout the day, which I mentioned earlier. If your restaurant is open, it is silly to keep a portion closed. 
Secondly, the quantity of Biryani and its price are moving in opposite directions. What they serve now is hugely overpriced.

In all it is still a great place and the biryani, chanp and shahi tukra will make sure you leave the place happily.

If you are in search for really good Lucknowi biryani in Kolkata, there are plenty of places. But if you are looking for the best one, ¬†you should be at RIH. The biryani has its own authentic flavor. The meat(chicken or mutton) in the biryani is so well cooked that you will remember its taste forever. The tangdi kabab is also fabulous. Although you might find Firni better in some other restaurant. Ambience is very simple. But the food will make you forget everything for sure.

Royal Indian Hotel has its own royalty when it comes in terms of Biryanis. One of the famous Biryani restaurants, has its own class. Situated in Bara Bazar area this place is always packed house. You have to wait a bit to get an entry in the peak hours.
The staffs here are very busy and hardly have any time to be friendly. It takes a bit more time to get your food than other restaurants and that can be expected when you see the crowd.
The quality of food has always been up to the mark and no complains about it.
There are two sitting arrangements. The A.C and the Non A.C. so you can choose as per your wish.
It has been quite a few times I have visited this place and I have never disliked any item.
These are the items you can try out for sure:
#Chicken/Mutton Biryani: This will be heaven for Biryani lovers. Its just too good. Its better to eat than to read more.
#Chicken Chap: Another dish which they make exceptionally well. A definite try out.
#Mutton Kassa: I found their mutton kassa one of the best. 
#Firni: I am a huge fan of firni and I always go around to try firni everywhere. This place makes quality firni. The quantity can be increased though.

Last Words:
Well, nothing much to say. Biryani Lovers just buckle up your belt and run to this place. You have already missed a great place if you haven't yet went to this place.

4/5 for Royal Indian Hotel

Note: My previous review got deleted due to any technical issue so its a repost...

Date of Visit : 08/02/2016....¬†

¬†The Place : Its like a Pearl in the ocean. A very well known and one of the oldest food place in city. Its in Chitpur road on the tramline way, very easy to find and visible from Mg road. The only thing that comes in mind is Biriyani when we hear about this place, they cook one of the best Biriyani in city with less oil and superb in taste. I observed so many things when I visited this place yesterday, its a famous outlet so the crowd is always there, they have both A/c and Non A/c sections. The better part is they also have single rooms for dining for the family and groups. The staff is efficient and quickly stick to your table for order as soon as you sit. Ambience is nice and clean, very well maintained and  service is quick....¬†

¬†The Food : I ordered the most tasty dishes as per me on my visit. Those are 1. Mutton Chaap & Rumali Roti & ¬†2.Chicken Biriyani .. ¬†

1. Mutton Chaap : The first thing that comes to mind when giving order this place is their speciality "Mutton Chaap". The mutton is shredded with mouth watering smell and excellent in taste. I ordered Mutton chaap and Rumali roti initially with salad. As I said the Mutton Chaap is their speciality so they give prime focus on it to give their best taste. Rumali roti was good in size and very soft. the combination of Mutton chaap and Rumali roti just made my day..
My Rating : 4/5

2.Chicken Biriyani: Then I ordered the famous Royal Biriyani (I choosed Chicken Biriyani). The first spoon entered in my mouth and I was in seventh heaven, what a masterpiece. Less oil, nice to smell, chicken piece was also soft and very well cooked, it got separated into two halves as I rolled my fingers on it. If you are a true biriyani lover then this is a must visit place for you... My Rating : 4/5

¬†Overall Experience:  I really found myself satisfied when I stepped out of the place. My stomach was full and my mind was relaxed with pure satisfaction and value for money. I recommend to visit this place once if you are in Burrabazar area.

This is a total nostalgia for me. I have been having Royal's chicken/mutton chap and biriyani from chilhood. This place is not that fancy but the food will not disappoint you. The old cabin system still exists and will give you an old Calcutta feeling. The roomali roti, mutton tikiya and firni are a must try as well. The barabazar road is very busy. So would suggest you guys to travel by public vehicle to reach this place.

A decent place that serves a sinful amount of taste, be it the Biryanis or the Mutton Chaanp coupled with Rumali Rotis.
Mutton Keema was bad and disappointing. Ambience is okay. Service a little slow comparing to the other places like Arsalan, Zeeshan, etc.
I highly recommend their Mutton Chaanp to anyone that loves food. It a taste worth everything it takes to reach this place. üòú 
Firni was delicious. Do give it a shot.

Through the extremely congested streets of North Calcutta, we found our way to the Royal Indian Hotel Pvt. Ltd. This is one of the oldest eateries in the city, and has developed somewhat of a legacy over the years. While waiting for our food, we found a cat sleeping peacefully under the table, but that never caused a problem. The Mutton Biriyani had a divine smell, and a large piece of meat, no potato or boiled egg. Tasted great too. The Chicken Chaanp, loaded with ghee, was possibly the best I've ever had, but is not for those with the fear of indigestion. Paneer Tikka, four pieces with some grilled bell peppers and a green chuntey was good. Ended it all with a Firni. Place is always crowded, and we can see why. Very good food.

The 3 of us visited this legendary restaurant last week. Established in the early 1900s, Royal has been on every foodie's to-visit list, owing to its sheer heritage, food standards and nostalgia associated. 

Location: Bidhan Sarani, a little ahead of the famed Nakhoda Masjid of Chitpore. We had taken an Uber which dropped us right in front of the restaurant. Take a metro/taxi if you would.
Ambience: No nonsense fuss free eatery with options of AC/non AC hall. We chose the AC and nimbly slipped into the lavishly (tackily for some, I daresay) decorated AC section on a sweltering Thur afternoon at 3 pm. It was crowded to the tee, and luckily we found the last and only unoccupied table upon arrival.

Food: We ordered 2 Mutton Biryani, 1 rumali roti, 1 paneer butter masala, 1 mutton liver curry, 1 mutton handi, 2 phirnis and soft drink. The mutton handi was a Thur special and had 2 large pieces, soft and succulent, though the gravy wasn't exceptional: it was a run off the mill north Indian gravy and scored a 3/5. The rumali roti was soft and fresh, the paneer was decent tasting but what surprised me was the paneer quality: soft and moist 8 huge pieces of  paneer dipped in an golden brown butter masala gravy. The dish deserved a 3.5/5 for the sheer quality and portion of paneer. The mutton liver curry was amazing, dark brown in  color, with 5-6 diced pieces of the meat liver. The clear winner however for us was the Mutton Biryani which deserves nothing less than a 4/5. Being quintessential Bangalis, we get touchy about the 'aloo' in the Biryani and wouldn't have it any other way- what's a Biryani without the much beloved melt in the mouth aloo in it, adding to the moistness and aroma of the rice?! But the Biryani at  Royal proved us wrong and how. It didn't have aloo alright,  but what it did have was a fresh, light (meaning not the sickeningly heavy dalda infused taste) fleeting aroma to it, which seemed amazing to even look at, not just taste! Other Kolkata places offering Biryani serve undoubtedly delicious fare, but are set back by the heaviness of the dish, where you cannot move an inch after the meal and feel uneasy for hours after. The most stunning part about Royal's Biryani was that right after the meal, we walked more than 3 kms to reach Jorasanko but not for a second did we feel stuffy, unwell or uneasy: magical indeed! Not only have they maintained their food standards but have also kept the fare authentic to the tee, for a good Biryani (the ones you get served at friends' places on Eid) will give you no heartburns, no acidity, only sheer joy!

Pocket Pinch: We paid only 1400 INR (for 3 people) for all the unbelievable portions of food we ravaged! 
Going back again, when next in town!

Location:Get down @Chitpur Bus stop & walk towards Nakhoda Masjid.2mins walk from the main road.
Food:I think in this age of zomato & all, this is one place which surely doesn't bother about these factors.It's a heritage restaurant & is solely famous for the delicious mughlai dishes offered by them since ages. As usual it was a packed up Saturday afternoon there when 2 of us reached to taste the mutton chaap.
We ordered royal spl mutton chaap, mutton qorma, rumali rotis & firni.
I don't need to describe the chaap. This is one kind which you won't get anywhere in kolkata. Here chaap isn't all about a single mutton piece & some gravy. Rather the meat is pounded & bones & meat are Separated. As a result you eventually end up eating small succulent pieces of mutton & the bones are also almost edible :D
Qorma was also tasty & not at all spicey.Rotis are big so be careful when ordering & firni was good.
Overall a good experience & would love to visit again if not this one but the south kolkata branch of theirs.
I can't offer full marks because they need to upgrade the decor & the ambience quite a bit & also some staffs need to learn manners.

Very pleasant place to visit. I took a biriyani, mutton chaap and nargis kofta. Friends,nargis kofta, I don't like that would be for your health, as its the gravy of oil, well but the kofta was good,it surprised me. Next the mutton chaap was fabulous, yes they are great, also the biriyani has thoda haatke style. It will confuse you to judge that with arslan's biriyani.

Yes, I will visit there again, as I am not fully satisfied having only one biriyani,I need to taste all type of royals biriyani,not once but,again and again. One thing that I forgot to mention, the staff behaviours to their customer is very polite.

My suggestion to royal is that, don't make dishes look awful with floating oils

Love this place for food... ambience is not that good.
As my taste buds are strong admirer of mutton,i order mutton dishes whenever i visit this place.
Mutton biriyani,Royal mutton chap is a very common combo here... but Royal mutton pasinda kebab... uffffff !!! That was toooooo good.... Yum yum.... 
For me "Happiness is Biriyani" ......and if it's Royal... Then i'll neva gonna say no...

Known as one of the best biryani joints in kolkata the restaurant did not serve good biryani in my recent visit to the restaurant.
The biryani and chap was flat but its kebab dishes (which I did order) i.e, Chicken reshmi kebab and chicken tikka kebab were delicious.The firni too was flat.
The ambiance of the place is a good one.
The place is really a good place and I do have good dining experiences in the past especially of its biryani but recently the restaurant is not keeping upto the expectations.
Hope to experience a good experience in future.

Royal the name says it all ! been there with my mom who is very choosy about biryani. Being ardent mutton lovers we ordered Mutton seekh kabab,biryani and chaap. The kababs were succukent and melted in the mouth and was strikingly spiced which had a fine balance .We also later ordered roomali roti for the kebabs.

The biryani here is quite different from the other joints and once you have it , it will make a permanent place¬† in your heart. The chaap here has several small pieces of mutton instead of one.

Though we were already full tried their shahi tukra as we had heard a lot about it,and the taste still lingers......

Quantity is not sufficient to be shared by two since they serve awesome food and no one would want to share their plates.

The restaurant serves one of the most delightful biriyani in Kolkata. They are also famous for chicken chaap. The biriyani doesn't come with customary egg and potato, as is common with Kolkata's biriyani....but the quality is fabulous....there's an A/C section on the first floor too.

Nothing to say much about this place. All foodies already know the location,what to order, what not to miss (mutton chap). Boti kebab, malai kebab were damn delicious. The biriyani comes without our beloved potato, but the taste won't ever let your mood down. And don't forget to try firni. Biriyani aur chap ke baad ek firni toh banta hein.

Well, I heard it's one of the most old and reputed hotels in Kolkata and it's been a while. 
So decided to give it a try, located in Bow Bazar, Google Maps helped us find this place located quite inside the area.

We ordered Mutton Chap, Tandoori Roti, Chicken Reshmi Malai Kebab and Mutton Quorma. They were served quite fast if not very considering the amount of people inside. 

The food was good. The quorma, kebab and roti, the roti was really soft. However, the chap was disappointing. It's known for the dish but we found it to be very disappointing. 

It's a 3 for me but the extra 0.5 because of the ambience and service provided. 

Worth a try for people who love North Indian. Good, for a one time eat for sure.

Won't be commenting about the decor and ambiance but certainly an old charm of kolkata with a mouth watering food in a reasonable price.
One must visit this outlet for the love for the biriyanis.

If you crave for biryani along with chap this is the perfect place to visit . After Arsalan and Aminia this the 3rd best place serving biryani in Kolkata. A must recommended place .

A very old and legendary restaurant located very near to my college. I mainly prefer to have their mutton chap.. Which is absolutely brilliant. It goes well with paratha or tandoori roti. Their biryani is also very good but they don't give potato in it. Their mutton rezala is also quite good. The service is satisfactory and if you are looking fr a proper ambience then sit in their AC section(upstairs).

Intro: office colleagues brought takeaway - what I heard from them is the place was bustling with people to have food !

Food - Chicken & Mutton Biriyani

Chicken Biriyani - Very tasty , the aroma just proved that spices were mixed to perfection. The chicken is really very soft and juicy -the softness  by far the best I have ever had  .
Just that I found a bit of more oil than expected 4/5

Mutton Biriyani - Just superb , that s the feedback of colleagues who had it , and oil was very less as expected from Royal 4/5

Overall - Superb Biriyani - Just for the tad extra oil in chicken rating 4 /5else 4.5/5

I went here with my group of friends on our last outing before graduation.. We had friends from different states who wanted to try the best Biriyani and Royal didn't disappoint us! The mutton in Biriyani was juicy a succulent, it melted in the mouth.. The rice was fine and smelt amazing.. It takes a lot of effort to find sahi tukda and when I did at royal that completed my meal.. We bengalis feel Biriyani is incomplete without "aloo" , boss you need to taste Biriyani here without that!

Then visit Royal. This is one of the oldest mughlai restaurant and it's located at very popular chitpur joint.
Now coming to food
We took biriyani and this was awesome.
Then we took rumali ruti and nargis kofta
We have visited today because of nargis kofta but trust me Now I love this joint because of biriyani and sahi tudka
For desert we took firni and sahi tudkra.
Sahi tudkra is heavenly beautiful
Please do visit

The biriyani was awful and the taste was horrible but fortunately the chicken piece was nice.
Chicken qalia was ok types.¬†

Since my childhood royal is my favourite restaurant...I am a hardcore biriyani lover rather mughlai cuisine lover so for me royal is the best place.I come here in every 2 to 3 months.I remember in my childhood i used to come here with my parents and specially on my birthday having biriyani here was my best birthday gift.
I had tried all most every dishes here but my favourites are mutton chaap,mutton biriyani,chicken reshmi kebab,chicken tandoori & mutton pasinda.
Nowdays their are lots of biiyani restaurants became very popular specially arsalan and aminia but i can challenge they also cannot serve this type of biriyani and chaap.The aroma of royal biriyani and taste is just heavenly and the chaap is also tastes sooo delicious..it always fullfil my taste buds.
At the end of my review i would say if you are a true biriyani lover then pls visit here once..

Another tick off from my long wishlist.

As the name suggests, this is one of the most famous and oldest heritage eateries of Kolkata. The place is absolutely chaotic and it is always a challenge reaching there. You can get off in front of Mohd Ali park and then take the lane on the opposite side and then take a right from the Masjid.

Their seating zone is divided into three areas. One which is downstairs is absolutely not recommended as it always remains crowded and busy for the takeaway counter. Upstairs they have two. One is Non AC and it has that old Kolkata feel with the vintage decor and the cabins not prevalent now a days. The other zone on the right is AC. This zone is very simple in terms of decor. A standard room with tables and couches. The seating though is comfortable.

Now coming to their food, the place is well known for their Chaap. The Mutton Chaap we ordered was very tasty but let me add a lot of hidden gems in the city serve equally impressive chaap and hence i wont say it was something extraordinary. The Biriyani though was the star of the night. Starting from the quality of rice to the tenderness of the meat inside to the authentic dum preparation, i thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Let me add the biriyani was not at all oily which is to be appreciated. We also ordered for a portion of Nihari Kofta. This item was a revelation. The curry was simply mindblowing but mind the amount of oil which dominated the dish. The Mutton coating was made to perfection and the blending of Mutton keema and the boiled egg inside was soothing to my tastebuds.

Overall this place is highly recommended for every mughlai food fanatic in the city. A MUST TRY!!!

Situated at MG Road and Rabindra sarani crossing..
It has both non ac and ac section..
Went there once for a lunch..
This restaurant has it's own charm.. Different cabins are decorated differently though in an old fashion and that is their speciality..
Service was very good..
We ordered Butter nun, Mutton chap and Mutton biriyani.. Nun was sooo soft.. Mutton chap was tasty but contained bones.. Mutton biriyani is different here.. it's from Lakhnw gharana.. M from those foodies who love potato specially in biriyani but Royal's biriyani donot contain potato..BUT still it didn't make me feel bad as it tastes damn good.. I vl suggest biriyani lovers to take time n must visit this place..
Price is reasonable..
I vl definately visit this place again n again..
For me food is first priority n decoration n other things come later.. so I vl like to give it 4.5

25 years ago I started eating and loving non veg food especially biryani cos of this ROYAL place. Located in the crowded chitpur area...but it's a place known to all. A narrow flight of stair takes one to second floor which has a family restaurant kind of sitting. Mutton biryani and their famous mutton chaap is just out of the world. This place is a must visit not for ambience but for quality of food and service and if your taste buds have fascination for biryani. The rice grains look n and taste different than the famous arsalan biryanis but it has its own aroma n flavour. Staff is very friendly n good. Firni is also yummy. A true lover of food must visit this ROYAL place.

Royal Indian Hotel was on our wishlist for a few months. We wanted to visit them because of their famous biryani.
So we went to their ac section and it was a nicely decorated place. We had to wait for just few minutes to got seated. It felt a bit awkward to stand there right in front of the other customers, as there was no other space to wait for.
According to our plan, we ordered mutton biryani and mutton chap. Biryani was less spicy and mutton pieces were soft and delicate. Certainly their Biryani is not the best in the town. It is good, but not best.
Had been disappointed with their chaap as I heard a lot about that item. Nothing special was their.
We find it a bit overpriced too, judging from their ambience and quantity.

Read the reviews on zomato and tried out this famous restaurant in Bara Bajar, Kolkata. Located opposite to the Nakhoda Masjid, there is not too much to speak about the ambience here. We ordered chicken biryanis, mutton chaap, and firni. The biryani tastes good but not extraordinary as we had expected. Also, the prices have increased. Would request zomato to update the price list in the menu.But, disappointed with the quantity served. The service was quick. Overall, 3.5/5.

Situated at MG Road and Rabindra sarani crossing..
It has both non ac and ac section..
Went there once for a lunch..
This restaurant has it's own charm.. Different cabins are decorated differently though in an old fashion and that is their speciality..
Service was very good..
We ordered Butter nun, Mutton chap and Mutton biriyani.. Nun was sooo soft.. Mutton chap was tasty but contained bones.. Mutton biriyani is different here.. it's from Lakhnw gharana.. M from those foodies who love potato specially in biriyani but Royal's biriyani donot contain potato..BUT still it didn't make me feel bad as it tastes damn good.. I vl suggest biriyani lovers to take time n must visit this place..
Price is reasonable..
I vl definately visit this place again n again..
For me food is first priority n decoration n other things come later.. so I vl like to give it 4.5

25 years ago I started eating and loving non veg food especially biryani cos of this ROYAL place. Located in the crowded chitpur area...but it's a place known to all. A narrow flight of stair takes one to second floor which has a family restaurant kind of sitting. Mutton biryani and their famous mutton chaap is just out of the world. This place is a must visit not for ambience but for quality of food and service and if your taste buds have fascination for biryani. The rice grains look n and taste different than the famous arsalan biryanis but it has its own aroma n flavour. Staff is very friendly n good. Firni is also yummy. A true lover of food must visit this ROYAL place.

Royal Indian Hotel was on our wishlist for a few months. We wanted to visit them because of their famous biryani.
So we went to their ac section and it was a nicely decorated place. We had to wait for just few minutes to got seated. It felt a bit awkward to stand there right in front of the other customers, as there was no other space to wait for.
According to our plan, we ordered mutton biryani and mutton chap. Biryani was less spicy and mutton pieces were soft and delicate. Certainly their Biryani is not the best in the town. It is good, but not best.
Had been disappointed with their chaap as I heard a lot about that item. Nothing special was their.
We find it a bit overpriced too, judging from their ambience and quantity.

Read the reviews on zomato and tried out this famous restaurant in Bara Bajar, Kolkata. Located opposite to the Nakhoda Masjid, there is not too much to speak about the ambience here. We ordered chicken biryanis, mutton chaap, and firni. The biryani tastes good but not extraordinary as we had expected. Also, the prices have increased. Would request zomato to update the price list in the menu.But, disappointed with the quantity served. The service was quick. Overall, 3.5/5.

Though my m√©nage loved the food here, I was not that much impressed. I had chicken biryani which tasted good but nothing extraordinary. The roomali rotis were smaller compared to other places. I simply disliked their chicken chaanp which tasted slightly sweeter but the mutton chaanp was comparatively much much better as stated by my brother. 
When in barabazar and within the vicinity of this restaurant , one can give this place a shot for the biryani.

There is really nothing new to tell tale about place and the food they serve. Many find this place a true royal one especially in its 'chaanp', but my first ever visit was not grand at all. I don't know how great the 'chaanp' of this place was .. but at present it is definately not THE BEST in town. I mean its definately good but not that great. It really made me feel sorry as a foodie. You may feel the place a bit pricy keeping in mind the ambience and of course the quantity they serve. You have limited options in the menu .. which is on one hand a good as well as negative feature. You will also find quite a few dishes that are served on selective days of the week. VERDICT: worth a visit as it has been popular.. but do not expect too much as I did. P.S: you may try their firni .. i can guess it will please you.

One of the muglai restaurant or shall i say the best of them all. My all time favourite are their mutton chaap and mutton biryani. They don't serve aloo with their biryani, god knows why. Mutton pasinda are for those who like boneless mutton and lesser spicy. Their rezala is also a must try. Overall highly recommended to all the foodies.

I found this place through zomato when I searched for a good place with biryani... Easy to locate on mg road, this place was somewhat crowded when we went there... We ordered for mutton biryani and mutton chaap... Mutton biryani was good if not the best I have had... It was different since it was less spicy but more on flavors... Mutton chaap was OK... It was a bit salty for my liking... I still don't understand y no raita is served in many places at Kolkata... 

Service is very fast and staff are friendly...Overall a good experience...

Royal is the ultimate name for luchnow biriyani in Kolkata. Altoght I was totally frauatated by the time I reach there ( roads are very congested), the total hard work was absolutely worth it when I finally got to taste the biriyani.

If you are habituated with typical low spice high aroma Kolkata Biriyani ( Arsalan Speciality ), then the first spoon of biriyani will give you a SHOCK. But don't worry it will turn out to be good ( Not for the faint hearted). This is because unlike Kolkata biriyani, this is rich is spice & flavours. Mutton peices are soft. The rice also consist small meat balls along with big Mutton peices. 

Along with biriyani, we ordered Chicken & Mutton Chaap. Chicken Chaap was good ( Arsalan do it much better ), but mutton chaap was outstanding. Spicy, flavourfull. I was in tears literally.

We finished with Firni, which was great again. 

Stuffs were very senior guys, working there since long time. They treated us well.   

Finalky I would say, the best things in the World are for the bravehearts. Go enjoy a Royal Treat.

I have travelled across the length and breadth of our wonderful country, sampled the layered Biryani at the Nizam, enjoyed the Lucknowi variant in Delhi and Lucknow but nothing comes close to the aroma and taste of the Kolkata Biryani

Royal Hotel belongs to the league of the Biryani legends, one of the jewels in the crown of Kolkata's Mughal cuisine landscape. On a warm afternoon I found myself in the crowded streets of Bara Bazar; braving my way through the hush hush I proceeded to a meal at Royal Hotel

I started off with the Royal Mutton Chaap accompanied with Roomali Roti, the Chaap was delectable sparsely hosting a few pieces of bones which actually enhanced the taste; the gravy was dark, thick and spiced beautifully

This was followed by a portion of Chicken Chaap which was amazing as well. The Roomali Roti fell a bit short of expectations and was slightly dry

I then asked for a portion of Chicken Reshmi Kabab which had a moist buttery texture and melted in my mouth instantly. The phirni was good but slightly thicker than usual 

The service was extremely cordial and it would be wrong for me to not mention Mr Ishrafil who made the experience extremely memorable 

Overall I am impressed as to how some of the restaurants in Kolkata are still maintaining the ethnic flavours which used to draw in crowd a few decades ago; the quality is retained and few dishes have even attained perfection

Cheers!

Royal is famous for its Mutton Chanp and it will remain so for ages to come!
Been there recently, after some thirty odd years and found that this tiny place on the oldest road of Calcutta has changed a lot, thankfully for the better! Service at Royal was pathetic. They had this 'couldn't care less' attitude of Indian Airlines in the 80s, which could be translated as, since we didn't go to you, but you have come to us, do have the patience to wait for your turn. That was, find yourself a place to seat and wait till one of our waiters decides to pay attention to you. In a changed time, with three air conditioned dining halls on the first floor, the waiters are attentive now and well behaved! :)
The food hasn't changed though. It's as good as ever. Ordered Mutton Chanp and Rumali roti. It was a trip down the memory lane. The Firni also remains very different from other places, very distinct. A meal at Royal is never complete without a Firni. :)
You may ask, why a 4.5 rating then! Well, with food, you always have the scope to do better!

Perhaps one of the best best biriyani in the town and that too an authentic one. They are one of the oldest north Indian restaurant in this city. The biriyani is tasty and they do not give and potatoes in the biriyani as the mughal royal did not added potatoes to the biriyani. The ambience of the restaurant is really great and the service which they provide is super fast. The mutton in the biriyani is soo smooth that it will melt in your mouth, even the people who do not likes mutton will love it. They also make one of best chaps in this town. The price is average and it a great place for food lovers and for having great lunch and beautiful dinner...

Heard a lot about this place. Actually Royal is not only a restaurant but also depicts our cultural heritage. I went there with my girlfriend on the auspicious day of Saraswati Puja on 13th February around 2 p.m. There are two floors in Royal, first floor is Non-AC and second floor is AC. There was huge rush in the ground floor during office hours. We preferred first floor. We ordered Rumali Roti, Mutton Chap, Mutton Pasinda, Mutton Biriyani and Firni. So now the rating part:
Rumali Roti: soft but not that hot. 3/5
Mutton Chap: One of d famous dish of Royal. Enjoyed it, not very oily. 4/5
Mutton Pasinda: It is a special dish of Royal. Available twice a week, Wednesday & Friday. Most of the people spoke highly about this item but I didn't like it that much. 2.5/5
Mutton Biriyani: Here comes the most talked about item. Quantity is sufficient for one person. No potatoes. Felt the beautiful aroma. Taste was near to the standard set by Arsalan, Park Circus. 4/5
Firni: Firni was OK type, nothing special. 3/5

Situated in the suburbs of barabazr area in Kolkata,Chitpur. The restaurant z one of the heritage hotel Kolkata has. The food available here is just uncomparable with any restaurant. The menu z restricted to dishes as they especialize in the best dishes. Chicken biryani, tandoori chicken,etc.. They have bestest quality with the lipsmacking taste. There z both with AC hotel n non AC for serving food. They also have veg item with only 2 dish in their menu 1.paneer tikka (dry) 2.paneer butter masala. Else they have all the section for different types of rotis. All in all "Royal z royal"..!!

This is legend with no frills. The only biryani I would die for. No other place in kolkata makes awadhi biryani to this perfection. Once I noticed a clove in my spoon of biryani just before putting it in my mouth, but I couldn't find it with my tongue, the clove was melted in my mouth. Never found such well cooked biryani elsewhere.

Very messy road leads to this mughlai vintage eatery.
Their biryani without potato can match the fine quality of any other good biryani joint.
Their forte is their side dishes.
To experience the excellent use of spices and taste the juicy pieces of chicken you have to climb those extra 'stairs'!

We went to Royal as part o trying to relive the great traditions of Kolkata eateries. Of course to get to Royal at Chitpur (the original one) you need to brave the traffic, congestions and the whole environment!! Once we got there we went up to the first floor and took a traditional "family room" ( this happens only in Kolkata).¬†

Our objective was the chaanp and the biryani. Service was amazingly fast. ¬†the Chaanp was as is was expected to be quite rich in spices and rather heavy on oil and masala. ¬†I thought the dish once a favourite has lost some of its charm in the modern food scene. But what has not lost any charm and never will ¬†is the mutton biryani. It was oustanding and flavorful ¬†and one of the best w ehave had. We ¬†kept ¬†asking for more

Though this place is renowned for its various 'chaaps' I went for Biryani and Reshmi Kabab. What I actually got was small meat balls and below standard Biryani. Never dreamt of such poor condition of this royalty. Compared to Rezala was good and looking healthy but the latter's was horrible.

Pretty average experience. Yes I agree that the chicken chaap was sinfully delicious, still, the quantity is a big turn off. Biriyani was light, without the potato as usual. But then again, the quantity is way too less than it used to be. The AC section has comfortable seating and simplistic decor. 

Nothing to go crazy over, but might go back to try their unique style of Biriyani again.

Am I the only one who thinks that its quality has degraded??? Went there yesterday with my group of friends. Ordered Biriyani and mutton chaanp. The quantity is toooo less for biriyani (plus I love my biriyani with the potato). And the mutton chaanp had less mutton and more chopped bones! I went there for its heritage and wanted to recall the good old childhood days but was disappointed!

What is most important in this place is that it has maintained the quality with the changing times. When you are at Royal, it means you are here for some serious high-quality food. The service is quick. You can try anything from the menu and you would have a nostalgic feeling. Please ensure you end your biryani/chaap with the world famous Firni, the best I have ever had.

As per the reviews I expected so much but totally got disappointed. Firstly, the area of location is so congested & dingy. The ambience & staff were nothing great. Coming to the food, they were pathetic barring the biryani. Chicken Tandoori was bad, Roomali Rotis were worse, Mutton Chanp was worst (was filled with mutton fats in both the plates we ordered & so it tasted yuck), Firni was tasty. But but but....the Biryanis were truly heavenly. The rice was so fine, meat was so tender...it just melted in the mouth. So whatever points I'm giving is just bcz of the mouthwatering biryani. So I would prefer ordering only Biryani (that too for a takeaway) if I come here next time.
P.S. Their Biryanis do not contain any 'aloo'...!!!

Another place I've been to many,many times yet somehow I've never written about. Situated in Rabindra Sarani,this place has 2 sections...a lower non-ac one and an air conditioned section upstairs ( with better service and of course,higher prices ).
Coming to the food...well their biryani is quite different (no potato) and somehow failed to impress me. What makes me go back their are their curries....especially the mutton tikia, and the chaap.Their chaap is arguably one of the best one I've had. 
They also have special dishes as per the day of the week,however those run out pretty fast. I had a nargisi kofta once and I loved it.
Simply put,it is another of those old world eateries where the food makes you go back again and again.

Went to barra bazar area today, and being a biriyani lover, went to Royal Indian Hotel (one of Kolkata's oldest biriyani makers) to have biriyani and chicken chaanp but after seeing the ambience, thought of not having it in the restaurant so I parcelled my food, mutton biriyani (they said its their hotel's speciality) and chicken chaanp and after having it I must say this is the second worst biriyani I have had after manti's biriyani(tollygunge). The biriyani had absolutely no taste. The biriyani had no potato too.
The chaanp was full of dalda and was not tasty at all.
This my warning to all biriyani lovers if you love biriyani then don't go and have biriyani from this restaurant. 
Very very disappointed. .üòê

Well, starting up with a confession! This is my first-time visit to this legendary/heritage mughlai restaurant of my city...and yes, it is quite shameful being a die-hard foodie! Have had the chance to eat its biryani a couple of times which my dad brought back home... anyway, Better Late than Never!!!
Location : bit tough to locate it on your own if you aren't a north-calcuttan or aren't well aware of the area (i could have never find it out if i didn't have my friend along..i'm a hardcore south-calcuttan, u see!) Anyway, just ask anyone in and around Chitpur and u'll be sorted!
Decor: the restaurant has three sections; a ground floor seating(non AC), a first floor seating(NON AC) and an Air-conditioned section with modern decor which is clearly a new extension of the heritage structure.. i always prefer to sit in the non AC as i'm not fond of one and i think the food tends to get cold faster under air-conditioner.. (see, how big a foodie i am! :D)
Menu: the menu is not so vast that a poor hungry soul would get lost in it. It's quite compact and clealy specifies the restaurant's specialities which i found out to be of great help for the first-timers like me.
Coming down to our orders which included a chicken biryani, a chicken chap, a mutton chap, a couple of rumali rotis (it was lunch time and they didn't have tandoori rotis which really bothered me coz i don't really like rumali roti much. Minus 0.5) and a Shahi tukda.
Food:
* the chicken biryani tasted fine till the point it was warm which is a couple of minutes after they were served and soon after that it showed its colour, i mean, texture. The soft aromatic rice of the biryani turned harder as it was cooked in dalda/ vanaspati which feels so terrible on the tongue. And we seriously felt the quantity was less too compared to other well-known biryani joints in the city. Minus 0.5!
* the chicken chap tasted good, nothing like any of the chicken chaps i have had before at other places. It wasn't swimming in a bowl full of oil and well, wasn't bland either. The chicken was like melting-into-the-mouth soft, but again cooked in dalda/vanaspati! Minus 0.5!
* Mutton chap: I just tasted a tiny bit of the mutton chap and didn't have the entire portion. my friend had it and he quite liked it.. and he said that it's the best of Royal one can get! this was too cooked in vanaspati though..
* Shahi Tukda: wasn't really thinking of having a dessert but it was our waiter who recommended this one and i thank him dearly for doing so as i might be coming back for this one. It tasted divine on the taste-bud, even though it too was prepared using dalda/vanaspati.. (i hope u guys have already understood my hatred for vanaspati..please get rid of it! It's so harmful!)
Overall impression : according to what i have grown up hearing that this is a heritage mughlai restaurant of calcutta that all true blue foodie calcuttans have heard of/eaten at. But is it really so? I mean by the current food quality, i have real and serious doubt! Or if it's really true then it sure has lost its charm and standard.
*** Some serious piece of advice to the management : please for heaven sake stop using dalda / vanaspati in the preparations.. it doesn't taste good as soon as the food loses its warmth. One can clearly see the solidified white layer of vanaspati over the food and can taste it even better which i swear tastes aweful on the tongue. Taste it yourself guys! And do i have to remind you about the ill health effects of it; the clogged arteries of the heart with fattening layers of cholesterol causing out of vanaspati?!
I surely don't want one for myself ! -_-
Am i coming here again? I have doubts. Maybe yes, for that lip smacking shahi tukda!

Well, starting up with a confession! This is my first-time visit to this legendary/heritage mughlai restaurant of my city...and yes, it is quite shameful being a die-hard foodie! Have had the chance to eat its biryani a couple of times which my dad brought back home... anyway, Better Late than Never!!!
Location : bit tough to locate it on your own if you aren't a north-calcuttan or aren't well aware of the area (i could have never find it out if i didn't have my friend along..i'm a hardcore south-calcuttan, u see!) Anyway, just ask anyone in and around Chitpur and u'll be sorted!
Decor: the restaurant has three sections; a ground floor seating(non AC), a first floor seating(NON AC) and an Air-conditioned section with modern decor which is clearly a new extension of the heritage structure.. i always prefer to sit in the non AC as i'm not fond of one and i think the food tends to get cold faster under air-conditioner.. (see, how big a foodie i am! :D)
Menu: the menu is not so vast that a poor hungry soul would get lost in it. It's quite compact and clealy specifies the restaurant's specialities which i found out to be of great help for the first-timers like me.
Coming down to our orders which included a chicken biryani, a chicken chap, a mutton chap, a couple of rumali rotis (it was lunch time and they didn't have tandoori rotis which really bothered me coz i don't really like rumali roti much. Minus 0.5) and a Shahi tukda.
Food:
* the chicken biryani tasted fine till the point it was warm which is a couple of minutes after they were served and soon after that it showed its colour, i mean, texture. The soft aromatic rice of the biryani turned harder as it was cooked in dalda/ vanaspati which feels so terrible on the tongue. And we seriously felt the quantity was less too compared to other well-known biryani joints in the city. Minus 0.5!
* the chicken chap tasted good, nothing like any of the chicken chaps i have had before at other places. It wasn't swimming in a bowl full of oil and well, wasn't bland either. The chicken was like melting-into-the-mouth soft, but again cooked in dalda/vanaspati! Minus 0.5!
* Mutton chap: I just tasted a tiny bit of the mutton chap and didn't have the entire portion. my friend had it and he quite liked it.. and he said that it's the best of Royal one can get! this was too cooked in vanaspati though..
* Shahi Tukda: wasn't really thinking of having a dessert but it was our waiter who recommended this one and i thank him dearly for doing so as i might be coming back for this one. It tasted divine on the taste-bud, even though it too was prepared using dalda/vanaspati.. (i hope u guys have already understood my hatred for vanaspati..please get rid of it! It's so harmful!)
Overall impression : according to what i have grown up hearing that this is a heritage mughlai restaurant of calcutta that all true blue foodie calcuttans have heard of/eaten at. But is it really so? I mean by the current food quality, i have real and serious doubt! Or if it's really true then it sure has lost its charm and standard.
*** Some serious piece of advice to the management : please for heaven sake stop using dalda / vanaspati in the preparations.. it doesn't taste good as soon as the food loses its warmth. One can clearly see the solidified white layer of vanaspati over the food and can taste it even better which i swear tastes aweful on the tongue. Taste it yourself guys! And do i have to remind you about the ill health effects of it; the clogged arteries of the heart with fattening layers of cholesterol causing out of vanaspati?!
I surely don't want one for myself ! -_-
Am i coming here again? I have doubts. Maybe yes, for that lip smacking shahi tukda!

The absolutely finest biriyani of Kolkata.period.
This biriyani is like old bengali films of tarun majumdar. Simplicity and elegance at its highest order!
For me..the greatest couples in the world are as follows:
#3 kajol + srk
#2 old monk + coke
#1 Royal's biriyani + mutton chaap

The hotel is at bara bazar, had a reputation for its Biriyani and chap, had a taste of its Biriyani which was awesome... Best part was that every pieces of meat was cooked perfectly, and had the right taste. The chap really had its elegance its quite different from the regular that you find. But, its taste awesome. The sahi tukra was one of a kind sweet, with the taste of pure ghee. The interiors and the staff was okay.

Came to this place after a long time and nothing has changed. For this restaurant time seems to just stand still. Neither the ambience nor the quality of food has changed much. Ambience has stayed as rustic as ever.....food is as delectable as ever. The Biryani is different to that served at other places in that they do not have potatoes in them. The taste of Biryani....simply delicious and they also provide a healthy piece of meat in it. The Mutton Chaap is beyond words....incomparably delicious. We ordered Firni, which was equally tasty. Service is pretty quick....our order was taken and the food arrived at our tables in a jiffy. Plan to make my visits more frequent in order to try out few of the other items that I have earmarked. Food is the priority and that's what you get best here.

One of my most favourite Biryani restaurant in the city. Super delicious biryani they serve but the only thing missing in their biryani is the aloo (potato). 
The Mutton Tikka Kabab is also delicious and goes well with their paratha or rumali roti. Another trademark dish here that I love is the Mutton Pasinda Kabab, a little spicy, but what's good food without a little spice in it.
Many have recommended their Shahi Tukra & Firni, would have to try them once soon. 
The little rustic restaurant which isn't too pleasing on the eye will surely leave you mesmerised with it's food. This one's a must try.

I went their with my uncle for pre puja shopping. Though I heard about it a lot but went for first time. Convenient location. Simple decoration. Waiters r also well behaved. Had their chicken biryani, chicken bharta n firni. All dishes taste good but it could better in quantity in biriyani as it is competitive market. Price are reasonably good.

Sublime is the word to describe their biriyani! The place boasts of an old-Kolkata feel, which coupled with the perfectly spiced succulent mutton biriyani, makes for the perfect afternoon gateway. The shahi-tukda also deserves special mention. Service is extremely efficient. It's a sin to compare eateries, but Royal is the only competition for our beloved Arsalan.

My first visit to this place was some 16 years back. I would be some 10 year old kid then. One of my uncle living in Kolkata that time brought my whole family to this place. That was the first time i might have had Biryani. I still remember the divine feeling i had after having the chicken biryani here. Since then i might have had biryani from almost every famous place in india. Having lived in Hyderabad for 3 years i can definitely claim that. But the biryani here is very uniquely awesome. Unlike other places, biryani here is not spicy at all but still it is mouth watering delicious. It happens so that my family individually happens to visit Kolkata around twice every year. We all make sure we do not give it a miss. Every time i come to this place i still have that divine feeling i had the first time. P. S: It is a very casual place with no ambience at all and it's management too old to an extent that they don't accept cards till now. ;)

Sub standard biriyani. Full of oil and average taste. Firstly we ordered chicken biriyani and were given mutton biriyani. On telling the waiter, he argued with us that we had ordered mutton only. On pleading with him. He agreed to bring the chicken one. I understand this place is popular among a lot of ppl. But my experience was very bad

Biriyani - excellent for those who like lite biriyanis and who cant devour a sumptuous amount.  they dont hv a potato or an egg in it. Way less aromatic than the other biriyani giants. The oil content is however less, but so is the overall quantity. The biriyani might hv been a legend in the past, but it certainly won't impress a regular modern day biriyanist. The quality and quantity both hv ample room to improve.

Mutton champ -  tastes a bit different than the others. Very rich and heavy. But thats it.
With bones in it, a blant taste and a truck load of fat oozing out of it,it is definitely not a heavenly experience. Especially if you are having it during summer months.

PS-  cash only. No cards

This rustic old restaurant have a different charm. How much I love this place. People of Kolkata love Biryanis and are crazy about the potato in them. But here the Biryani is different with a classic awadhi taste. It is just sinful. The best Biryani of Kolkata? To be honest yes, but personally nothing beats a plate full of Kolkata style Biryani with a aloo and meat in it. However the Biryani here won my heart. The aroma, the taste. Everything is superb. The small meat balls in it adds more perfection to the taste. A delight for hardcore gastronomers.
‚Ä¢
If you come here you better not miss the signature Mutton Chaap they offer. The best Mutton Chaap i've had ever. Although it may keep away calorie conscious people being a bit oily, I love the way it looks and most importantly, how delicious it is. Spicy and hot, it goes perfectly with rotis. Somehow I felt their firni is not as rich in taste as what Aminia or Arsalan offers and felt a bit bland. But put aside the everything else, the Biryani and the Chaap will surely tickle your taste buds.  
‚Ä¢
Royal Indian Hotel is simply a delight for foodies with its sinful Biryanis and chaaps on offer. I also assure you this place wont put a hole in your pocket.

The place is located on the lane that goes left from the Bata store , a seven  minute walk away from MG road crossing . The restaurant is also close to Nakhoda Masjid , and the name is prominently visible. The seating on the first floor is preferred , though there are seats on the ground floor as well . The first floor has both A.C. and non- A.C. segments . The air conditioned part if nicely lit , the interiors have warm hues and there are tiny chandeliers hanging on top of the tables . The service is quick , though the staff may be a tad difficult to spot . The royal  mutton  Biryani needs no introduction ! It is one of the best and popular  Biryanis in Kolkata  and deservingly so ! The rice is slightly oily but not excessively , and the spices are well blended into the rice  , giving it a  unique flavour that makes it so special and an absolute must try ! The chicken chaanp however , was served cold , and had a single leg piece of chicken , and the gravy seemed frozen after a while !! Lastly , the Firni here is one of the best I've ever tasted , and comes in the signature tiny earthen bowls , and tastes absolutely heavenly ! If you're a Biryani lover , you can't afford to miss this place !

Royal Indian Hotel located right on busy Chitpur road or rabindra sarani has been serving people of kolkata for ages. The wonderful aroma that fills the area where this hotel is located (from the mutton chaap handi that is cooked almost outside the hotel shielded by glass) - would make you hungry even if you are not. This is one of the joints in Kolkata who prepare Biryani without aloo (pure Lucknowi style) and also the rice is spicy compared to others. Their mutton chaap is the best in the city - hands down. The chaap along with freshly made roomali roti is a pure bliss to the tastebud. The chaap is spicy, oil and full of taste - simply superb. Their gravy items or kebabs are nothing special and are almost similar to other mughlaai joints in the city. The kesar firni is awesome and a must try. Overall - hugely recommended.

One of my default haunts for biryani. Whenever I am in the bara bazaar area, it is one of the places I definitely visit. They have two sections. A/C and non AC. The air-conditioned section has more taxes and hence higher prices. The food in both the sections is impeccable though. Love the biryani and chap. One plate of the biryani is enough to make your tummy happy and sated. Coming to desserts, the phirni is a must. I repeat. Do not skip it, even if you are full. Also, if you are visiting on Monday. Wednesday and Friday, be sure to order the shahi tukra. That is truly royal! Happy eating.

I visited this place on Maha Dashami this year with my elder brother. After being in a queue for about 15 minutes, we got the chance to go up into the eatery. We ordered two mutton biryanis, two chicken chaps, one green salad and cold drinks. Frankly speaking I was very disappointed with the biryani. You can't compare it with the biryani of Arsalan. It was dry and had one medium sized mutton piece with no potato or egg. And the mutton piece was very boney. I could hardly get any meat out of eat and had to consume the biriyani with the help of the the chap's curry as we were extremely hungry. The chaps were disappointments too. The curry was black in colour and were very salty and the chicken pieces were boney. It was the same experience for both of us. So, we ordered a chicken kasha in the middle of our dinner and consumed the rest of the biryani with its help. The chicken kasha was delicious. I don't know whether we had to have this experience for the puja rush! May be the chefs' were too tired of continuous work throughout the day. The stuffs were very polite and friendly. Thanks for serving us.

Its situated in a very difficult area. We came here in a Wednesday afternoon as some signature dishes are available in Wednesday. We ordered Mutton Biryani,Chicken Chap,Mutton Pasinda kebab and Shahi tukra. Mutton Biryani was good enough a bit spicy but good. Chicken Chap was also extremely delicious.Mutton pasinda kebab was shredded and it has a buttery ghee flavour which was completely new to me . Lastly Shahi tukra was also very good...a must try. In short a good experience.

Located in bara bazar and it's literally a battle to reach this place.. But its every bit worth the penny coz dis place serves the best authentic mughlai biryani and chaap.. People literally stand in the queue for an hour or so in the take away counter to get the food. Definetely the number one mughlai restaurant in calcutta.
It doesn't serve potato in its biryani and the gravy of the chaap is literally finger licking good. I just hope and wish they start home delivery..

My experience here was below average the last time I was here, the biryani was not even a shade of its previous glory and the Mutton Chap was very bony and super super oily. We had also ordered a Nargisi Kofta and the keema covering was dry and almost tasteless. This place surely needs to look after their quality.

My outing at the Royal Indian Hotel can be described as a tad above average. Frankly i had a hell lot of expectations coming to this place with its usual awe and grandeur but it didnot turn out to be that way . Located in the heart of Rabindra sarani this is the grand old mughlai destination of central kolkata. I went inside with my father at 3 pm in the afternoon so i would not say that to be the peak hour but who cares it is always crowded in the eatery . We ordered : - 

1. The Royal Indian Mutton Biryani ( 3.5/5 )
2. The Royal Indian Mutton Chaap ( 3/5¬† )
3.¬† Rumali Roti ( 2.5/5)
4. Firni (3/5)

My biggest disappointment was that they could not provide tandoori roti which was like a catastrophe. I mean its acceptable that its 3 pm in the afternoon and it is really late but you are the Royal . The rumali roti was cold and hence the poor rating. The mutton chaap is good but really really bony and certainly not the best of the city. The mutton biryani on the other hand is something worth mentioning.Please keep in mind there are no alu's here . Strictly no , so the portion was rice was very encouraging and the piece of mutton was delightful. I would really suggest to go for the Biryani . Would come back again for the other dishes. hope i would have a much grander experience.

Food packed for home so the review would be concerning the food only. But my my... What food! I don't recall the last time I had such tasty biryani. We just couldn't have enough even after finishing three plates! The Mutton Chap and Mutton Boti Kebab too were extra special. I don't mind saying that I became a fan of Royal Indian that day! And I wish to continue being a fan... If only I was in Kolkata to regularly please my taste buds with their ambrosia... Sigh!

Yes, it's famous, people swear by it's Biriyani and Mutton Chanp BUT after visiting the place over 20 times, I can unbiasedly declare that the reliability of the food has degraded drastically. The waiters aren't courteous at all and the food is not hygienic.

True legend. Iconic food. Trust me there is fast food and then there is Royal Indian Hotel's "IN A JIFFY" food. It will put fast food chains to shame. I m not a big biryani fan , so gave it a skip. I went for the mainstay Mutton Chaamp and the equally delicuous Pasinda. Food was delivered within 60 seconds flat and boy these both were scrumptious. Very tasty, very flavorful and served hot. Then could not resist and tried both the shahi tukda and firni...the perfect end to a happy happy meal. The old world crowded shared tables eating adds to the experience. Will visit again to explore the menu more. Must visit when in Kolkata.

One of the most renowned joint of the area. Had mutton biriyani, mutton chap and rumali roti. The taste of the biriyani was out of the world. Though it does not have the traditional potato and egg with it but no complaints as the taste was just awesome. The mutton chap was also delicious. The service was also good.got the food served in less than 10mins.So it is a.must visit if u want  to have mughlai dishes.

Simply stellar Awadhi biryani, and the mutton chaap! It cometh as rain on a parched desert day. Gloriously succulent, sumptuously savory, perfectly spices to accompany the fragrant aromatic rice of the biryani, so delicately scented with cardamom and saffron. The chicken chaap is good, but the mutton chaap is a work of art, poetry in motion towards my mouth. 

The owner is awesome, too. We met and talked Brooklyn and Biryani. It was a long awaited pilgrimage to come to royal, but we'll worth the trip. If you are looking for ambiance, look elsewhere. It's clean, neat, with flowers on the tables, but nothing fancy, just excellent biryani, chaap, and some thumbs up if you want it. A Kolkata must.

This place is located inside a dingy and busy road, quite typical for barabazar. However the food compensates for the effort to search for it if you are visiting it for the first time. Though their biryani omits the traditional Bengali style ALU in it, still give it a try cz it tastes great. Along with it the mutton handi would b a good company, though it tastes better with tandoori roti. In a nutshell a decent place to visit.

Royal is known for its awadhi-calcuttan biryani. The biryani has the influence of both Calcutta and lucknow. Being that said, now the food .
The biryani is just as delicious as it could be as well as the mutton pasinda kebab. Though the reshmi kebab could have been better. Overall I would say one of the top biryani restaurant in Kolkata .
Bon appetit !!

The only name that comes to mind when I think of Biryani. The amazing taste makes up for the lack of a potato. The chaap is to die for. What taste. Totally different from what the rest serves. Only thing that makes me unhappy is the long queue and the parcel packaging.

We were there at Ezra Street for Diwali light purchase and were dying of hunger. Suddenly remembered that Royal is nearby and immediately agreed to go. Came here after almost 13 year but It's the same old world feeling. The decor is sober and takes one to the yesteryears. Coming to food we ordered biriyani, chaap and reshmi masala. The biriyani is still the same and mind you that they don't give potato or egg with it. Slightly greasy, it is faithful to the original line of the dish. Nothing for the chaap as it is what Royal is known for. The reshmi kebab was fantastic. Perfectly cooked and well-balanced taste. However the biryani quantity has gone down. Priced at 170/165, the biryanis are on the higher side and they also charge vat and other taxes. The only point deducted because they still don't accept cards. So pack in extra cash. The menu Isa straight one. Will be there again very soon.

Had heard a lot about this place from my friends... Visited this place during the pujas... Had ordered biriyani while my friends had ordered rumali roti... The biriyani was lite... Ok good... But tasted like simple boiled rice on steroids :! The chicken piece was well just a piece... Blatantly dull and had nothing but bones... The roti as said by friends were... Well... Leathery :3 The ambience was good but the waiters were so ill mannered that we could not even give our orders properly... Am I going back there? Of course NOT!

This place had been in my wishlist for a long time as I had heard many Calcuttan friends rave about it. So, when I visited Kolkata after quite some time, I did not miss the opportunity to try out the food here.

We ordered Mutton Biryani, Mutton and Chicken Chap, Roti and Mutton Kaliya. The Mutton Biryani was top notch with good and fragrant basmati rice and exceedingly soft mutton pieces. It had a bit extra ghee in it, but given the taste, that might be excused. However, almost all other items were below expectations. The Mutton Chap was below average and unnecessarily greasy, the Kaliya had very little meat and too much oil , the Roti was not served hot, the Chicken Chap was just OK but nothing outstanding. Overall, except the tasty biryani, i found the food a big let-down. I was left wondering how a well acclaimed Mughlai restaurant can live with such ordinary side dishes.

Of course, there is nothing special about the ambience, and none was expected. The service is fast, but not very helpful. When we asked for hot Roti, the waiters did not care to mention that Tandoor Roti is available and gave us cold Roomali Roti-s. The prices are OK, and it came to Rs 1400 for 5 people.

Overall here are my ratings regarding the restaurant :
Ambience - 2.5/5
Food - 3/5¬†
Service - 3/5
VFM - 3.5/5
Overall - 3/5

One can go to the restaurant for trying it out, but I would recommend only the Biryani.

Well this is in my Top3 for 'Best Biriyani in Kolkata' along with Aminia and Aahar.
Located in the busy and crowded area of Barabazar  in KOLKATA, ROYAL seduces its customers by radiating the delicious irresistible aroma of their biriyanis and chaap. For the newbies, I must warn you the decor and ambience isn't that great. It's very simple. Infact to a certain extent rustic and banal. But the food more than makes up for it! Their biriyanis are an all time favorite among Kolkattans (Trivia: ROYAL even featured in one of the comics of the famous bengali fictional character Feluda.) 
The chicken chaap is another speciality that complements the biriyani/rumali roti impeccably.(Royal makes very good soft Rumali Rotis)
If you're a true biriyani lover like me I would highly recommend you to try ROYAL if you haven't already. I have been going to ROYAL for the last 10years and I still am not tired of it.
Keep up the good job guys!!

Today me and my cousin went to Royal Indians. Personally I waited for a long to taste Royal's Biriyani. The area is too much congested. Ambiance is not that good. There was a huge line for AC room. And you can't pay by card unless you have your food at AC room. There might be some tax issues as the food at non-AC room is tax free like Arsalan.¬†We ordered mutton pasinda kabab and rumali roti 1st as the pasinda kabab was friday special. The rumali roti was a huge one and the kabab was good. The taste was a little different but amount was too less. Then we ordered mutton biriyani and mutton chap , the dishes Royal is famous for. Biriyani was truly good.It reminded me the old Arsalan biriyani though mutton size is bit smaller. But the mutton chap disappointed me. ¬† The taste was not that good. At dessert ¬† we had SHAHI TUKRA which was the best of all the foods we consumed . The taste different and it has some layers . The mid portion was little softer and mouth watering. If you want to go to Royal , I will recommend you to make it on Wed/Fri/Sun as the shahi tukra is only available on those days.

One of my favourite Mughlai special place. Located at Burrabazar, chitpur crossing. This place has two portion, one at the ground floor and another at the first floor. There used to be another AC room in first floor but I found that closed for more than six months.
Place is very simple, almost no decoration. Only a tiny flower on each table. It has 3/4 Family Room or cabin at no extra cost. But dont like in cabin unless outside area is full. 
My all time fav is mutton chap. Its heavenly. Spicy, soft small pieces of mutton full with favour of every ingredients, cooked to perfection. Biriyani in this place is not that spicy, a bit on the dry side. But the taste and spice change time to time, may be on chef's mood. But i like it with chaap. Rumali roti also goes well with chapp....or may be nothing else, you can enjoy the chaap alone :). I have tried many of their starter and all are good. Me n my gf's favourite is reshmi kabab. Its lovely, sofy jouicy chicken with minimum spice. 
One must be here at least once for the sake of CHAAP.

It is located in a very congested place just opposite to Nakhoda Masjid in Burrabazar. The restaurant doesn't have any branches. So it's a bit difficult for everyone to go. However, if you are a true foodie and a biryani lover, believe me you won't be disappointed. I have mostly taken parcels to my place. The ambience and the atmosphere pf the restaurant is not that great. But the Royal Special Biryani is just beyond brilliant. It is a bit different from the traditional Kolkata biryani. The biryani doesn't contain the "Aloo" and the egg and it is a bit spicy. The Chicken Chap is also nice. According to me, this is best biryani I ever had!

It is our yearly ritual to have the awesome biryani with my dad every year during durga puja. Its a lovely place with courteous waiters serving with smiley face however tired they may be. Food is awesome. Biryani rice just melt in mouth texture and tender mutton, tasty but surprisingly less spicy. The rezala is creamy and light. The location is also very good. If anyone is in the mood for shopping spree, after eating here you can go out and binge-shop. To you, team Chitpur er Royal, long live!!

I would rate this place 10 out of 5, if I could. This place is heaven. This place is bliss. This place is divine. Firstly, the roomaly rooty and chaanp, mutton, of course. Their signature dish. The name's enough. Tender meat. Delicacy, this. Secondly, the biryani, beats Nizam's, Arsalan, any day. This is the best place to have biryani. The rice and meat, tender, warm. And the aroma. It is intoxicating. I've. Been there about five times and ordered both every time. This is the place to be at, folks.

Also, they have a dessert called "shahi tukda". They cook that about three days a week, days specific. That is orgasmic stuff. It makes you prone to obesity, diabetes and heart diseases. But it is definitely worth it.


P.S. The place is so good, even their soft drinks tastes better. Just kidding.

Royal Mutton Biriyani along with Chicken Chaap is like sex in the mouth :p
For the starters section, Reshmi Malai Kabab is excellent, and one should also try the Shahi Tukra, its a dessert which you will get only on weekends. People who have a sweet tooth will love it.
Altogether Royal is the shizz :D

I personally feel that Royal has become somewhat less worth visiting. Their legendary Biryani and Chaap has taken a turn, and not one for the better. 

Critics and Foodies will tell you that Royal is worth going to because of their food -- and that their poor ambience balances their superb Mughlai. I used to have a similar opinion of the place until recently. Their Biryani now has a little too much Garam Masala and they've started to serve less Chaap than they used to. Honestly, reducing portions of fan favourites is criminal in my book. Their service is as fast as ever though, Biryani arrives at your table a few seconds after you've placed your order.

I'm not saying that Royal isn't good anymore -- it's just that there are better Biryani eaters available now. Unless Nostalgia is your weakness, try out some lesser known joints.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

I have been to this place twice and every time I go , I make myself guilt free state considering the amount of calories that is going to be taken in. One word that can be used to tag this place is " brilliant".
The biriyanis , kababs and the koftas are any day to die for.
The long rice of biriyani dipped in butter are one of the finest ones that my tongue has ever tasted. It will melt in your mouth leaving a heavenly taste behind. The do not serve with a potato or an egg unlike other biriyani joints. But the mutton/ chicken is so soft that even a spoon can dig out the mutton in pieces. The quantity is absolutely for one person and for those who have a problem with gastritis, please do not worry since you will not experience a single burp and the entire course will be digested.
I also tasted their haleem, mutton chap, mutton rezala and chicken hundi.
Each and every item is worth trying. Haleem is found only in the month of ramadan and one plate is sufficient for 2 people.The dal and the meat is blended into perfection.
The mutton rezala is a master piece , although served one piece per plate. Do give it a try. The rezala contained enough of butter, cocomut milk and a piece of mutton which will melt in your mouth instantly.
Mutton chap is basically shredded mutton cooked in a peppery way.
Coming to the dessert, both shahi tukra and the firni scores 10/10. I don't know how do they really make it . Shahi tukra is a bread with malai over it cooked into perfection.
The only disadvantage is the timing , it gets closed at 4 pm and starts again from 7 pm.
I would recommend this place anyday, anywhere, anytime without a second thought.

The best Kolkata biyani... oops I mean the best biryani in the whole world! (Kolkata biryani is the one and only biryani I believe because biryani without aloo is certainly not a biryani. Period.) and their chaap! yummiest!! heardd about their murg musallam a lot butt yet to taste it.

My friend from dhandbad really wanted to visit this place, as he has heard so much about it.
We went there at lunch time. Upstairs it was almost empty. We order mutton biryani which was not at all hot, we knew there will be no potato. Still the biryani is nothing to boast of. Very ordinary. Lots of biryani center in park circus n Ripon street which are in bylanes serves better biryani than this. Disgusting to say the least. Chicken chaanp hardly had chicken in it, no taste at all. Tried ordering paratha but when ask whether we will get fresh ones, answer was it was made at 10:30 in the morning. Very limited menu. Just running on name. What a shame.

Its an honour to review THIS place.
Anybody who loves mughlai in Kolkata & never visited you is a rare combo.
Since childhood we are a fan of royal's chic chaap n mutton rezala.
In my last visit 3 months back I could not get any of the two so I had to go for bharta n tikka :(
Neither did I get halim during ramadan this time so I was a little sad but nevertheless you are one big reason for shoppers at Satya Narayan park AC Market & other places of burra bazaar I think (at least its the same with us)
So keep making us happy & keep cooking such amazing food.
Though many might not like the ambience but for me after you have made the ac section it has become all the more good & as long as you serve us such yumm food am fine with it. :D

Not just this place is close to where I stay, but also really very close to my heart. I've been coming to this restaurant from my childhood. And the best part of this restaurant is that they have maintained the same taste. Nothing has changes over here in decades. I just love everything they serve. Specially the BIRYANI.

Would give a rating of 4 out of 5 because of a reason..... Though I am a crazy Mughal Food Fanatic and I have tasted several Mughal Dishes in Famous Restaurants but I am certainly upset that Boiled Potato or Aloo is not given in their Biryani which I hv tried out.. For a Biryani Lover.. That Boiled Potato is the Main Item of Interest and when that is missing its of no use..... On the other hand..... My most of the rating goes for their side dishes like Nargisi Kofta and Chicken Chaap which is Brilliant found only in here..... Overall a mixed experience in this Restaurant.....!!!!!

This is old school stuff. Let me give an advice first. If you haven't been there ,go ..simply go today. There is just an old school charm about this place..the hustle bustle of bara bazar ,the nakhoda masjid in the backdrop which you can see if you peer from the balcony or the non ac room upstairs. This is one of the few places which still has cabins.
 take a date on your risk cause you won't be talking much given how great the food is. One downside is though if there are couples in the cabin they keep on rustling the drapes covering the entry of the cabin. So not much privacy. So maybe not the usual ambience of a pricey restaurant but it has its charm.
Now the food- i will sum it up in one sentence . A friend suffering from liver problem had said "Royal is worth risking your liver for". Its that good..The biriyani is a thorough lucknowi style. And the mutton is the most tender i have had. Savour the smell..its simply delicious..and most of all you won't mind working after having this biriyani..its so light on your stomach..the other biriyanis you have  ,you feel like its a total workout . The mutton chaap is the original reason for it being so famous..and chaap rogan is just mind blowing..they use such a myriad of spices that this is one thing you can't just miss.have the chaaps rogan with the biriyani..its  a great combination.  But the mutton are mashed up into small pieces and the bone to mutton ratio is very high.The tandoor items are great.really tender and succulent..highly recommend the reshmi malai kabab,tandoori and mutton boti kabab..and if you are there on wed,fri,sunday do try the shahi tukra..its a sweet dish high on sugar, but a delight.
P.s - if you come here and have a great meal tip the waiter a tad bit more..and then hold on to him for ever ..he will source you the best food from the kitchen. As i said ,old school stuff.

First floor right hand cabin is so nice...the old royal charm is present....ambience good,decor minimal but appropriate for this kind of old royal restaurant..the waiters were very generous..... We ordered mutton chanp ,butter nun ,rumali roti,green salad and mutton biriyani.....the nun was awsm ,rumali ruti normal type,salad is OK but chap did not satisfy our taste bud ...but the butter nun covers the all..butter nun is a must have item here...and its also tax free...now conning to biriyali.. It is devoid of potato....ha ha...but I can surely say it was one of the best biriyani I have ever eaten.....the service was good no delay.... Royal is royal...thanks....

This place has been on my list for a while now. Certainly worth every second of bad traffic that you go through to reach here.

The Biryani while spicy and brilliant doesn't have one key element. Potato. Although you miss that, the flavours keep you in.

The chaap is beautiful and precise. Goes brilliantly with their signature parathas that are so soft you can tear them with two fingers.

Service is also pretty good. Old Calcutta charm flows through the waiters.

A must visit for every Mughlai food lover.

Went to Royal on a Saturday afternoon (for the first time) to taste the legendary Chaap.
Three of us ordered three plates of the Mutton Chaap. Had it with rumali roti. Then moved to Mutton Biryani. As we know, there was no Aloo in the Biryani, which we liked actually. We reached the state of eternal ecstasy after having a spoon of Chaap with its fat & spices and some aromatic rice from the Biryani. The heavenly taste of the Chaap made us so astonished that we ordered the fourth dish of Chaap as dessert!
Then we requested the waiter to introduce us to the Chef. He introduced us to Biryani Chef Mr. Gulam Nabi, a very humble person. We thanked him for his splendid work and he was really happy to hear that from the guests.
The Legend Still Lives!

Have been going here for a long time but recently had a sad experience. Around Ramzan 5 of us went for dinner around 9, All biriyanis were finished so we had tandoori roti and chaap and me a dal tarka and off course phirni. The phirni was best in the whole dinner. The chaap was oily and not so good as it used to be, Overall average. Want to get back that old taste.

From Sabir's it took almost 20 min walking to reached ‚ÄòRoyal Indian Hotel‚Äô at Bara Bazar near Nakhoda Masjid, this place doesn't need my recommendation, what with its history, and enthusiastic word of mouth doing it for them. There's no better place to head down in your shorts and slippers with a few good friends and have Kebabs and Special Mutton Biryani. Sometimes nothing beats tradition.

Today they served us their Special Mutton Biryani, Special Mutton Haleem, Tandoori roti and Sahi Tukra. After an average start, this experience was pretty interesting. Ambiance was again typical muglai restaurants style.

If you like well-spiced and extremely generous portions of rice and meat, then Royal Indian Hotel will hit the spot with its heady masala. They cook their chicken and mutton briyanis traditionally in a dum style, which flavours the rice immensely.

The mutton haleem at Royal Indian Hotel was something so unique you may never have tasted anything like it. Well worth the hunt for this place, Royal Indian Hotel prides themselves on serving haleem that not only tastes good, but is good for your health too. You must save space for a slice of their moist Sahi Tukra.

Their dessert Ramadan special Sahi Tukra was marvellous. Truly a royal dessert, as its name suggests, Shahi Tukra is a rich bread pudding with dry fruits, flavoured with cardamom. It‚Äôs stuffed with saffron flavoured condensed milk and a royal treat to taste buds at anytime.

Its old. Its legendary. And its still the best available. Most may argue in favour of Arsalan or some other vendor but none can match Royal. The rice is thin and well cooked. Arsalan's rice is shorter and thicker. There is just the right amount of oil/ghee. It does not drip!! The only shop in Kolkata who use milk (yes, original biriyani recipes do ask for a little milk), special wood for their ovens and choicest meat. Its a full bodied biriyani which is light and very enjoyable. The biriyani has a lovely aroma whilst other biriyanis are forced to smell. If teamed with the greasy chicken chaap or less greasy tandoor (as per one's choice), its still a winning combo. Agreed that the location is less attractive but again I am game for food. And yes, its best to take away your biriyani and enjoy it at home in your comfy pyjamas.

This place is at its best in terms of biryani, champ is good to but tandoori roti was not available, roomali was more like a towel than a. Romaal in thickness, bara kabab was nothing great. Price and quality is great, finally this restaurant if needs to be located in google, shows a wrong address so better beware, i had to roam around in circles reaching here.

So far so bad! And u sit and order!! And here comes the magic!! The taste,ahh those heavenly flavours dancing on your taste-buds!
Here to mention they serves biriyani without potato, not a signature-Bengal Biriyani. They does nt let us experiment with many options rather show us the way,much like Steve-Jobes-way!! Chicken tikka butter masala,chicken and mutton chap (if u r frm old school) are sexy. Dont forget to order the firni at the end.
Long live the Royal experience!

This legendary restaurant in the busy streets of Central Kolkata, is an absolute delight for Biriyani lovers. This place has 3 sections- Cabin, Non AC and AC and one can trade-off between comfort and no taxes (the AC one charges extra tax for same food). If you want to try some traditional Indian dishes, add this place in ur wishlist asap. One must try Mutton Pasinda Kebab, Chicken Chap and Royal Mutton Biriyani here in this restaurant. Only one slight disappointment about this royal place is their quantity, otherwise I would've rated it a 4.5.

It is not shiny, something gorgeous. Royal Indian Hotel is a place for food, and not just any food, it serves the best Biryani in town. The pure bliss that you will feel after having it is definitely incomparable. It's heavenly.
The Royal Indian Hotel is not a super luxurious food corner nor is it located in some posh region. But it is a place on the hitlist of all the foodies in this city. I will definitely recommend Royal's Chicken/Mutton chap, the biryani is a must, Chicken Reshmi Malai Kebab and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala.
If you are a foodie or a Biryani Lover, this is your place.

In Kolkata there are a lot of places that serve Mughlai cuisine. However, this is undoubtedly the best you can get. It's been here, well for a very long time. They have a choice of ambience with sections divided into ac, non ac and delivery. I'm not sure if there is a difference in pricing. The service is laid back which I don't mind because the food is brilliant and they give you an opportunity to lick your fingers ;).

There is a small thing to keep in mind, the only vegetarian thing they have in the menu are breads! So avoid if you're a vegetarian or not having non Vegetarian on that particular day.

A small tip, do not drive to the place your self as parking can be a very big challenge. There are a lot of other public modes of transportation that can be used.

The restaurant is situated in the heart of barrabazar area. So, you have to walk through very congested and traffic strucked roads to reach here. And if you are in search of parking place, simply forget it. This restaurant is at 1st floor of the building. It has elaborated A.C. and Non A.C. sections. But you may have to wait a little to get a sit as the A.C. section is always full. Once you manage to get a sit, the staff will promptly serve whatever you order from their menu.

We ordered Chicken reshmi malai kebab, Royal special Chicken biriyani, Royal special Mutton biriyani, hicken chaap, mutton chaap, Green Salad and sahi tukra. And i have no doubt to tell that it is one of the few restaurants in kolkata, which will pamper your test buds to such extent that you forget everything else. Biriyani was very mild spiced contains a large piece of chicken in chicken biriyani and three - four medium to small pieces of meat in mutton biriyani, but it does not contain any potato or egg. Chicken chaap was the best among i yet experienced. Mutton chaap was also very good, but there was too much bones in it. Chicken reshmi malai kebab was the best kebab that i ever had till date. Soft, buttery, juicy, delicious. As they does not serve raita, we had to order green salad, but this salad contains 90% onion. Their saahi tukra was full of ghee, and not creamy in texture and does not contain any gravy. You can find Shredded almonds sprinkled all over this delicious desert.

Now what are you waiting for? Go, and satisfy your taste buds.

I have been to this place quite a few times.
Here are the main points :
1) It is one of the best place to have a plate of biryani. The taste and authenticity of the served food is great. Try the chaap and biryani.
2) Do not expect extremely sophisticated catering service. The service is average and sometimes below average for posh people.
3) When you go to a place like Royal, you go for the food. The ambience is ordinary. The have air-conditioned rooms and private coops. They also have a common hall which is rather dirty and chaotic.
4) The hygienic standards of the place is rather poor including the kichen.
5) The price is average, not cheap nor costly.

The oldest Biriyani in town serving the most authentic Lucknow style biriyani and the mutton chaanp is to die for. It is slightly peppery but better than most if not all places. 
The biriyani does not have the usual peice of potato that you come to expect from a kolkata biriyani but tastes just awesome.

It absolutely near to the Nakhoda Masjid. We ordered their mutton biriyani, nargis kofta & haleem. The biriyani was okayish, not that much awe strucking. Being a Kolkatan, I was disappointed as it did not have a potato. Moreover the quantity was too less for the price. The nargis kofta was not that good. It had too much of oil floating over it. The gravy was saltless & it tasted awful. As I have heard from many that they serve the best halim, I was eagerly waiting to taste it but too my utter disgust I could not have it. I exactly tried to figure out what it was. It was more of a patient's food. The behaviour of the waiters were ¬†too bad. In all, I take an oath of never ever visiting this restaurant again.

Very Highly Recommended for Absolutely the Best Chicken Chap in Kolkata - TheFlavours here are more peppery & so different to the other Mughlai Restsurants & All the food is cleaner & less Oily somehow... Great Mutton Chap & Pasinda as well ... Awesome Chicken Barra Kababs, The Mutton Nihari they serve through Winter is just "Wow" ... Their Biryanis are very Good but the Kolkata Biryani Lovers may miss the Potato which these Guys do not put in their Biryanis ...

I've been eating from this joint since 30 years!! Undoubtedly it is kolkatas best biryani and chaap. Many people would argue that it's not coz they don't serve an egg or potato in the biryani.. But u have to taste it to believe it.. Not oily.. Not heavy and best quality of rice!

Heard of this one as one of the best biryani-maker in Kolkata, with some other renowned dishes like Nargis Kofta etc., but it was a disappointing visit. Not up to the mark at all. We had ordered Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Haleem (Ramzan special, won't get throughout the year). Though Kebab was Okay-ish, Haleem was not among the bests. For main course, we had Mutton Biryani and Nargis Kofta, both of them couldn't satisfy our test-buds.We wanted to order Pasinda Kebab, but it was not available on Saturday.¬†

Service was good and waiters were really cordial. Ambiance was good, 3.5/5.

I went to this place after finding this place listed as the best biriyani house in zomato in kolkata.

I went to this place with a lot of expectations.

The place is not difficult to find being located just opposite nakhota masjid.

I had expected this place to be shabby but I was quite impressed with the interiors.

Now coming to the food.The quantity wasnt a lot.The rice was nicely flavored .The mutton piece was decent but it wasnt as tender as dada boudi biriyani,and also not as big.

We also ordered a plate of mutton keema,which was good not wow.

Overall,The place is decent but I would still rate dada boudi biriyani higher.

If you haven't tried the famous Mutton Chap of Royal, then you have missed an experience of a lifetime. No other restaurants in the "WORLD"can beat Royal, when the concern comes to Mutton Chap. Mutton Biryani is also very much tasty. But the quantity is very less comparing to the price.¬†Another thing, they do not give any potatoes in the biryanis which is kind of uncommon for Kolkata style biryanis. And that's why they are different. If you don't like their food, then it's time for you to see a doctor, maybe your tastebuds aren't functioning normally........ :P
This is the legendary ROYAL cuisine...

This place is legendary for its Mutton and Chicken Chaaps. I visited this place only twice and both the times it impressed me beyond expectations with its quality food and homely ambiance. The waiters are well behaved and have good communication skills, but the order takes a lot of time to arrive. The Mutton Biriyani tastes divine just like its Chicken Chaap. My personal order suggestion would be Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Butter Naan and Chicken chaap. For desserts many would say the Firni....but i would always suggest Shahi Tukra. This dessert will take you out of this world.¬†

The only cons is that, the restaurant is not easy to find out. So just get down at MG Road Metro Station and ask for Royal Indian Hotel, anybody will direct you. Its just a 8 - 10 mins walk from the MG Road Metro. Also do ask the metro police to direct you towards Burrabuzar so that you can come out through the correct Metro GATE..

ENJOY!! ...... :)

The first restaurant in Kolkata to serve Biriyani and undoubtedly, one of the best biriyanis in the city.
That perfect taste, that perfect aroma and flavour and the perfect rice which melts in the mouth. Literally! 

I like the kebabs served there. The chicken pieces are soft and perfect in taste. 

During rush hours, you might have to share the table with other visitors. The service could have been a bit faster.

Will surely go back.

Royal is located in one of the strenuous stretches of kolkata. D√©cor- simple and effortless. That can be overlooked, for once you enter, your heart will be filled with the aroma of true-blue "mughlaai" biryani! Enough to give you foodgasm. Well, nobody can beat Royal when it comes to Biryani and mutton chanp. If you can get hold of their Mutton Tikya, consider yourself to be lucky. It vanishes as soon as it appears! And their pasinda kebab is to die for. End your dining experience with phirni- again unbeatable.

The environment is not excellent but ok types. And the desert Sahi tukra,OMG! It was just brilliant. You should order sahi tukra if you visit this place but Only 3days of the week it is available. For food out of 5 you have to give 4.5.....

Food- Awwwwsome 
Location- Central Kolkata 
Ambience- old school
Service- old waiters üòú 

R u a mutton fan? Crave for some authentic mughlai? Want to have a taste of the REAL biryani? Then this is the place to be.
The location ambience and service though not great speaks a lot of the heritage of this place. It actually goes well in giving you a feel of the old days since it has opened its gates for us Calcuttans ages back.
Talking about the food, well its not much to talk but shut your mouth and enjoy the taste. The aroma of biryani catches you as soon as you step in. Mutton lovers do try the Royal Spcl. Mutton Chaap and the Mutton Biryani. No expansive menu, just a few modest dishes, most of which are great. Firni will satisfy your sweet tooth well enough.

Different from all the top notch mughlai restaurants in the city the food here defines quality and authenticity.

When you go shopping to Burra Bazar and is a fan of Mughlai Dishes, it is a must visit.
The Biriyani served here can compete and win with the best Biriyani outlets in the whole country. You will also love the Chicken Curry with lachha paratha here. My mouth starts watering once I think of these dishes. It is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. Extremely moderate costly place. A highly recommended place to visit for all. I personally love the Biriyani served here.

Well if you are visiting Kolkata and don't go to Royal on Rabindra Sarani you are doing a great sin. And a big disservice to the city that exults on its unique food!  

The simmering sumptuous sensational chaap is something to die for...nay, to live for! The rich ghee laden gravy with uber soft melt in your mouth mutton pieces tantalise your taste buds in a way that any language is so incapable of describing. 

Their biryani is another culinary delight, just the right amount spices and taste. 

And if you still have space in your tummy,top it off with that larger than life shahi tukda, which lives up to its eponymous name - rich and royal. 

Oh, one thing I noticed about Kolkata food, and holds true for Royal too,  these guys are not stingy in their portion sizes!!!!

Legendary...Awesome...Magnificent... Spectacular are the words which fall short of defining the quality of food this place has offered for over a century. Chaap, Biriyani, Tikka are the most favourite and demanded dishes here ever. Seating style might not suit everybody but the yummy quotient it has to offer will help you overlook all the other flaws which I think actually are minuscule. And one thing I have personally felt is that even after having enough quantity of food here...you wont feel uneasy...it somehow doesn't bother your stomach which is remarkable in tandoori items. This is the place you should definitely go to for Biriyani and chaap. This place sure stands true to its name...Royal!

This one definitely comes under the 'Legends' category if you go by time, but somehow the taste doesn't seems to be as good as it used to be. Being near my dad's office I've always had the opportunity to indulge in their mutton chaanp and rumali roti, sometimes biryani too(which is wothout aloo). And i have always loved their food until my last visit which was a bad experience- rude waiters and bad service. Food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either how I remembered it to be. Buckle up folks.

Eating at The Royal Indian hotel has more to do with my feelings rather than the food. Here's presenting a review which is bound to be biased because this is where my non-vegetarian eating habit was born. 
Situated in a bustling street, the location is the unalluring part of the experience. The hotel has three types of seating areas available. One on the ground floor (near the main kitchen) and two on the second floor (Non-AC and AC). The ambience is extremely basic and can often be termed unsophisticated. But The Royal Indian Hotel and alikes are maestros known for tickling your tastebuds with their food! 
Chicken Biryani, Mutton Biryani, Chicken Curry, Chicken Chaap, Chicken Liver, Mutton Keema, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Tikka Kebab, Roomali Roti and Shahi Tukda are the ones that I have developed a taste for in all these years of my visit. 
The biryani has an evident savour which every Royal loyalist relishes. This is one of the few places in Kolkata that does not serve potato in their biryani, and I presume that is another attribute that adds to the distinct taste. The Chicken Chaap has a thick texture with deep flavour of blended spices. The soupy Chicken Curry is a personal favourite as a combo with the biryani. One might complain about the extra fat in the gravies but that can be skimmed easily. Shahi Tukda has been my very recent discovery here, needless to say that it kept my tastebuds happy. 
The parcel facility draws a lengthy queue on most days. The packaging is simple and I have personally not come across any serious wastage due to leaks. Not the healthiest option for good food yet one that I can in no way shun. A perfect tasty meal for the cheat day of a Royalist! (term courtesy Ms.

Situated very near to the Nakhoda Masjid, the Royal India Hotel is legendary for its Mughlai dishes and I decided to give it a try. I went on a Saturday evening, so missed both the famed Mutton Pasinda and Nargeesi Kofta. Had to settle for Chicken Biriyani and Mutton Chaap. I had a spoon of the Mutton chaap and wham! It was so delicious. Biriyani was also good. Staff behaviour was reasonable though the ambience could have been better. Would be visiting again for their speciality dishes.

For biriyani lovers please dont miss this place. The only con is the bad and crowded location of barabazar

Royal in name, Royal in taste! This is a legendary biryani place, known by the foodies of the city of joy for a very long time. Every one knows it, every one respects it. But when you will hear of royal, you will hear not only the biriyani, but the mutton chap along with it. Perhaps the chap has a little more fame. It's in Chitpur road, which was once the busiest road in Kolkata. We have ordered Royal mutton biryani, royal mutton chap and mutton nargisi cofta. The biryani, unlike other, was low on ghee and a little bit high in spices. The mutton in biryani was soft and tasty. The chap was nicely cooked and was spicy. It was well paired with the biryani. The nargisi cofta is available only in Wednesday and Saturday. Fortunately we went on Saturday. The cofta has core of egg, surrounded by tasty mutton keema. The gravy was sufficient for two people. Lastly, the ambience in the ac hall is upto the mark.

Though this place has lost its old charm amidst the advents on new players like Arsalan,this will always remain my favourite Biriyani joint in kolkata alongside Sheeraz..they says class is permanent and form is temporary,aptly so in the case of Royal..the most tasteful,delicious and authentic biriyani is probably served here..Even in this age they dare to keep any useless frills like Potato or Egg away from their Biriyani..Priced economically this place is ideal for a wholesome and fulfilling mughlai dining experience..Even when we used to be small..the Mutton Chaap of Royal was considered as one of the most delectable and sought after Dishes in Kolkata..though the quantity of the chaap has reduced over time..they have managed to keep the flavours intact..Also loved their Chicken Reshmi Kebab,Mutton Boti Kebab and their Mutton Pasinda..They have a separate section for family where stags are not allowed..Though you may find the servers a bit rude..but that is acceptable for the sure joy of your taste buds..

The specialty is that this biriyani had no egg or potato which though endearing to a few is never the real deal. It has an exquisite aroma and is very light. One must have the mutton chanp and mutton pasinda. Along with that have the mutton shami kebab.... Unlike in other places this is made purely out of beaten meat and no pulses etc.
I just love this place..

If you have not have had the biriyani and mutton/chicken chap of this place, then you have not properly pampered your taste buds and your lust for mughlai food is still unfinished and unclenched. The biriyani is one of the best in the town and I have had been utterly surprised to have found that the taste has not changed in the last 12 years I have found myself eating biriyani and chap from there. The quantity surely is not at all a lot and one can easily finish two plates if once can eat moderately. There are two types of seating arrangements on the second floor. One is the cabins with curtains, giving privacy(not too much to get intimate, so be careful of it), and one is outside the cabins, in open space tables and chairs. The seating arrangement is not sophisticated, you will definitely an old Calcutta feel in and around the place. There is an exquisite view of the famous Nakhoda Masjid from the front windows. 

The service is quiet fast and the prices reasonable enough. I would highly urge people to try the biriyani from this place at least once.

I used to be a big fan of this restaurant but i was really disappointed when I was there the last time. The biryani lacked the yesteryear taste and the quantity is drastically reduced.
Chicken chap was the worst I have had in years. The gravy simply solidified just 10 mins after serving. This indicates the worst quality of the materials used.
This was the restaurant that I used to visit since I was a child. But now I will avoid it.

My personal favourite. Before Arsalan came,our biriyani cravings were satisfied by Royal. The authentic mutton chaap is absolutely mouth watering. The biriyani,we get here,though without an 'aaloo' has got a taste to die for.

If u are a Biriyani lover and havnt tried Biriyani at the Royal Indian Hotel in Barabazar then its a serious crime to commit..!!...They make Biriyani the way it sud be...light yet with the perfect blends of the ryt spices....this is heaven for all those Biriyani-lovers out there...The side dishes is one thing they can still improve on bt wen u r served with such wonderful biriyani and so soft succulent kababs, little flaws in side dishes can well be overlooked...So next tym u go to college street make sure Paramount is not the only place u visit..after all Royal is just a few steps away..

My home is quite far from Royal. But still I went there with a lot of expectations. We ordered for Mutton Biriyani, Mutton Chap and Firni. Biriyani was very very ordinary.
 The quality of the rice was below standard. The mutton chap was under cooked and inedible. Firni wasn't also anything special. Feeling very bad :(. A big warning to all.

One of the oldest and best Awadhi food joint at the heart of old Burrabazar.The royal special chap with boti kebabs and mutton biryani is awesomely amazing.Service is homely but ambiance is not the pique.Firni at the end is served cold has a creamy palate at the end,the perfect sorbet.Mussalam,Kadhai chicken and Roganjosh can be tried as well.

Nobody can beat the Biryani of royal India hotel..the place is difficult to reach Cz of the congested commercial area but then once u reach the place u r in for a real treat. Royals Biryani is nothing compared to the contemporary Biryani places, it's exceptional as they do not serve aloo like the other places n if ur ordering mutton biryani n if it's really ur day then u may find the lil kofta balls amidst the rice, the biryani has the real awadhi taste. To go along with the biryani is the mutton chaap.. It's finger licking.. It's got the fiery hotness of pepper which u can either have with roomali roti or js with ur biryani.. The mutton boti kabab is delightful. Another of their speciality is the nargisi kofta which is available on selected days of the week..don't forget to try the mutton pasinda, it sells out real quick. It's a version of the chaap js with a lil variation n no bones..

Its a paradise for the biryani lovers. The Pasinda kebab and Nargisi Kofta are just something more than awesome. Sahi tukra in dessert is a must.
Rated 4 out of 5 just because the ambience and service has plenty of room for development. Though a place like Royal Indian Hotel is worth visiting just for the food only, not the ambience, but forget about the ground floor section or the non ac section, even in the ac section they don't have tables with 2-3 seating. Its irritating if a group of  2-3 people has to share the table with others, and its very common phenomenon there.
However, despite of this, the food is worth visits there.

Located in a pretty crowded area,Royal is probably the most popular Calcutta style Biryani place, Parking in the area is impossible so either get a cab and get dropped off or park a distance away and walk there. Still better and the preferred choice of Calcuttans is to order a couple of handis of biryani and accompaniaments andtake them home for a biryani party or just a relaxed meal at home !! For Biryani aficianados the Royal biryani is relatively simple in style and quite different from the Awadhi and Dum Pukht styles,and closer to the Hyderabadi server at Paradise or the Kerala style. It does not have the sophisticated richness of the Awadhi or the deicacy of the Dum Pukht.....nonetheless it makes for a great meal especially if you order a roganjosh with it. Certainly worth a go if you like Biryanis .The restaurant is not fancy but very simple and sparcely decored while furniture is very basic. Service is quick but dont expect 5 star attention,clenliness and ambience.

Are you a foodie?  Can you appreciate the true essence of biriyani ? Kolkata biriyani has been developed from Lucknow-e ghana... so to go back to ancestral root of biriyani and take your taste buds to a tour of heaven... you must visit Royal.
Also as a dessert most of us order Firni... in Royal one should order Shahi Tukra... it is just outstanding.

Royal is the oldest biriyani restaurant in Kolkata I guess and also it is the most gossip place.
It is located near barabazaar 
Well !! It is the very late review when I was in 12 me and my family visited there for tastes their brilliant biriyani. But the biriyani was so average in taste. Chicken varta was great. Ambiance is OK. 
Not that much great experience.. Sorry!!

Previously, I‚Äôve posted something about the generic biryani scenario in Kolkata. And out of them, very few joints have proved to be synonymous with quality and legendary food. And even fewer have been able to come up to such a level that stories are written on it and research has been conducted on them. Royal Indian Hotel in chitpur is one such place. 

How to go and when to go:

If you‚Äôre travelling via M G Road, go towards howrah station and get down at the nakhoda masjid stoppage. Turn towards nakhoda masjid and follow the tram line. Opposite to the mosque, there lies The Royal Indian Hotel. Those, who‚Äôre coming from Lalbazar/ Poddar court, an even interesting ride awaits them. Get on any tram towards chitpur and relax. It‚Äôll drop you bang in front of royal. Ask him to wake you up at Nakhoda. This place is open on all days 11 AM ‚Äì 1030 PM. But, better go early.

Entrance and ambience:

In this place, its a 2-storied restaurant, 1st floor being little expensive. even first floor is having one AC and non-AC section. I personally prefer always the AC family section on the right side. The staircase is pretty steep and tough for any person with knee problem. No lift.

Food:¬†

For food, I should not reinstate that its purely mughlai cuisine here. The owner of this place is said to have descended from the rakhabdars of Nawab Wazid Ali shah. Hence, all the items will have a subtle difference in taste from most other run-of-the-mill joints in Kolkata. For example, Biryani here dows not contain the mandatory Aloo and Egg. Do not get surprised or do not even fall off from the chair. Its true. The Biryani is having little history tucked in it. 

They say when Nawab Wazid Ali Shah came to Kolkata, he was allotted a yearly stipend of INR 12L PA by the british government, which was quite a hefty sum that time. But nawab being nawab, he used to have a huge team of assistants with him and lots of other people to take care of on a daily basis. And that sum was not really that huge as compared to the number. Now, In nawab‚Äôs kitchen, there were 2 types of cooks- Khansama and Rakhabdar. Khansama used to cook for everybody and Rakhabdar used to take care of only the Nawab and his immediate family members. Now as it was getting difficult for the khansama to feed everybody a good amount of meat with the biryani, he introduced the use of aloo/ potato and boiled egg to increase the quantity but it was a sin for the Rakhabdars. And as time went by, Khansamas spread thoughout Kolkata and Kolkata Biryani was introduced, which won hearts of millions. Rakhabdars still stuck to their root and potato/ egg was never ever used in Biryani. Hence, be prepared to have Biryani here without them. 

But, to make up to the loss of that, Royal Biryani is THE best in Kolkata if one is looking for subtleness in it. Its mild and fragrant and meat pieces are so tender so that they just melt in the mouth. The rice is long-grained and non-greasy yet having that aroma. Now, I can‚Äôt describe it. Just one suggestion. Do yourself a favor and have it‚Ä¶..¬†

Along with the Biryani, we had Chicken Rahmi Tikka, Fish Tikka Kabab and Mutton Burra Kabab. Chicken Rashmi Tikka was good, nothing extra-ordinary. Good, succulent pieces, lightly spiced- my son loved them. Fish Tikka was brilliant. It was spicy yet not fiery. They use Fresh water Vetki and portion size is quite good. 

But Mutton Burra Kabab (above) was brilliant. Boneless Mutton Chunks were soft yet chewy and that gave them their identity. Spread a little dhania chutney and heaven is yours. Too bad they do not serve wine here‚Ä¶.. (I knew that, didn‚Äôt I ? )¬†

Next we ordered some Roomali roti and along with, came the famous Mutton Champ and Mutton Pasinda Kabab. We‚Äôll start with the champ. Mutton champ is what Royal is mainly famous for (really ??? ) and its good. But, lots of bone pieces come is a dish and every one a while I needed to sort it out- which I didn‚Äôt like. On the good part, it was not extremely oily and its difficult to figure out where the gravy finishes and the meat starts or is it the other way round ? 

The Mutton Pasinda Kabab (above) was, on the other hand, was a revealation. It was boneless mutton chunks in a thick brown gravy. Quite hot, yet enjoyable. We just loved it. One suggestion for both the dishes, once you‚Äôre through, wipe the bottom of the plate clean with your roomali roti and a heavenly smile will come to you‚Ä¶ Amen. ¬†

Well, so, we were mostly done yet the waiter didn‚Äôt allow us to leave unless we have a slice of their ishpecial Shahi Tukra. and boy, was he right‚Ä¶..

A fat, thick piece of sliced bread soaked in rabri and sprinkled with dry fruits- somebody has to be really really insane to ignore that. Neither did we. Statutory warning. Order this dish before you start your meal because this thing tends to get over extremely fast and you‚Äôll be the one to lose out. ¬†

We could hardly move and probably needed a help to get out from the table. All the items were extremely moderately priced, then again when could money buy happiness ? 

Do yourself a favor and before you even start discussing the Biryani scene in Kolkata, visit this place. In all probability, opinions will change.

Don't know what to write about this place except its negative points..it is quite a famous and old restaurant in Kolkata and well known for biriyani,but some where they are  unable to hold their tradition in that manner.Visited it at sunday,especially for that "MUTTON PASINDA KAWAB" but alas!!!!its only available in evening not DAY TIME..okay!then we orderd chicken reshmi kawab,biriyani,rotis,mutton roganjosh,salads and prepare for have some firni as dessert. They serve it very fast because it was previous made and ready to serve....now the main thing is the biriyani was less in quantity,and its taste was so so nothing like as the previous reviews..dn that mutton dish was ummmm..what to say I don't knw,I don't like it at alllll..dn the saladas :()..it was so unfresh.And I don't dare to eat it..the kawab was also very disappointed and and and we orderd a cold drinks,and it was passed its manufacturing date..So with this wonderful experience we reject our thought of having firni..thats all..but i believe for extremely pressure of order or may be some other reasons some where the restaurant like ds are losting their own level..may be they will come up and give us some really good foods in future..hope for the best,and ROYAL i'll definitely visit u again to keep my believe..thank u..:)

The phrase appearances can be deceptive goes well with this place. From the outside the place looks shabby, the interiors are nothing great but the food is delightful. I have been going to this place for ages now. Whenever I am in the city I don't give the biryani from royal a miss.
They serve amazing chicken and mutton biryani but the one dish which stands out is the chicken chap. The chap comes in an amazing ghee laden thick gravy which makes it so special. I have had chicken chap from a lot of other places but nothing tastes as good as the one from royal.The various kebabs available are worth trying too.
Overal it's an awesome place for non vegetarian lovers. A must try !!!

I really don't understand why this place is so hyped. This is the most overrated place maybe. It doesn't deserve a 4 star AT ALL.¬†
We have been planning to visit this place for a while now, having heard of its great biriyani and chaap. Once we were there, our friend very wisely suggested that we don't order for biriyani as the quality has been going down. Well, we ordered a plate of biriyani (just to try), Nargisi Kofta, Chicken chaap, reshmi kabab and rotis. The kofta was the only good dish that we had that day.. The chicken chaap was a little too rich than it should have been. But the biriyani was totally Inedible. It was dry, hard, the oil stuck to the tongue, and was served cold. My friend couldn't eat it.¬†
The price isn't too high here, but then you also don't get your money's worth.¬†
The service is just normal. The food didn't take long to be served. The decor is pretty usual. Nothing about this place is out of the ordinary.
Because of the legendary status, maybe this place was worth a visit. But only this one time. Needless to say, I wouldnt recommend this place.

I came here with my office collegues.i have to say the location of this place was a little hard to find..
we were literally dying with hunger so we straight away odered mutton chap and rumali roti for starter and chicken biriyani for the main course. For dessert i wanted to try the firni. The mutton chap was superbbb..in most of restaurants like aminia,arsalan,etc we get a large piece of mutton cooked with spices. In bengali what we call "kosha mangso", but here thats not the story. It was more like mutton keema curry.but i have to say after tasting this i swear i wont be able to try chaps in any other places.it just stuck to my mouth. Coming to the biriyani it was also pretty good. Quantity was sufficient to calm a hungry soul. Firni was normal. Nothing extraordinary compared to other places.
Oh yes i had a coca cola as well.. But i guess wont have to review about that :P

Ambiance is noting great. Located at Rabindra sarani, 7 minutes walking distance from M.G.Road crossing. We had Royal Chicken Biriyani and Nargisi Kofta. The biriyani was good but was highly disappointed with the kofta. It is not as good as being stated. :( waiters are well behaved. There are family cabins, if you want to dine in privately.

If you are nonvegetarian living in Kolkata, you must have atleast heard of Royal's Mutton Chap. I understand that the Chitpur area is not for everyone, but once atleast in your life, you must have mutton chap from this place. The perfect balance of meat and bone is how I like to describe the chap here. The rumali roti is made of atta instead of maida and it tastes heavenly with the chap. And yes whenever I go even near to this place I never miss an opportunity to indulge. I also like the mutton biryani and the pasinda kebab but mutton chap is the best in kolkata. 

P.S: The famous actor Uttam Kumar loved the mutton chap from this place.

I live in South Kolkata Took the Metro to MG Road and walked my way through the busy streets of bara bazaar to get to Royal Indian Hotel.¬†I was excited and my excitement doubled when I smelt the intoxicating aroma of Biryani in 147, Rabindra Sarani, Bara Bazar, Kolkata.¬†I ordered their 2 specialty items :R. Mutton Biryani and R. Mutton Chaap
The service was awesome (4.5/5)
Cost (3/5)

Ambience (3/5)
Now, food: ¬†;_;Disappointing Biryani had no potato(Thought i was prepared enough, yet I missed having it :'-(  ) and its replacement - the kofta - only one!! Seriously, if you go to Aminia for their special awadhi biryani you get a potato as well as koftas !! 

The biryani felt like a plate of awesome ghee bhat!! Not the usual biryani-y taste you get at Arsalan or Shiraz. The only pro was that piece of Muttton that was really soft and melted in your mouth but that did not¬†rescue that plate of totally non-spicy (kinda bland) biryani

The Chaap however was really good!! Yet, you can get the same feel at Shiraz so nothing extraordinary.

My savior of the day would be the firni I ordered while leaving which was the best I've had..
So Food (OVR of 3.5/5) : biryani 1.5/5 chap 4/5 firni 5/5.

Hospitality (1/5) the waiter saw my bottle of thumsup and threatened me that if i drink from it they'll accuse me of drinking alcohol (WTF) and Normally at arsalan or zeeshan they politely tell me not to have outside food or beverages but they were so rude. and another guy came forward and shook my bottle saying "Nahin! Nahin! Allow nahin" I mean come don't destroy the fizz!!!

So In the end it was so not worth it.

My final viewpoint would be-

Arsalan > Aminia > Shiraz > Zeeshan ~ Rahmania~Nizam's > Amber > Oudh 1590 (Raan Biryani ^_^)   > India Rest. > Biryani Company > Alishaan Biryani House ('tis really cheap since it is roadside dhaba types) > Royal India Hotel (Yes the biryani was that disgusting)

only go for chaap and roti/naan if its near your house :-)

Royals non veg is without any doubt the best in Calcutta. With recipes passing on from generations, they have perfected the art of cooking biryanis. Go for food and food only. The pocket pinch is also fairly nominal.

Oh my God how did I miss writing a review for Royal. This place is a legend when it comes to Biryani and Chaap. Our father used to take us to Royal every time we went to Barabazar area during childhood. My brother and I would crave for the awesome Mutton biryani and mutton chaap sold here. The mutton chaap is still the best available in the city according to me. The small pieces of mutton mixed with the thuck spicy gravy just lingers on... The biryani is not very spicy and is prepared in pure ghee till date which is why they have still maintained the flavour and taste over the years. A must visit place for all food lovers who gorge on Kolkata style biryani and chaap. The ambience is average but the service is super fast and if you are regular you will find the same faces serving you over the decades. The aroma spreads over the entire area so you might not need the help of Google maps once you are in the vicinity of Royal... the aroma will attract you like a magnet and you will find yourself enjoying a sumptuous meal here.

We planned to have the nargisi kofta available only twice a week.so we ordered that....well the dish was no doubt their speciality!!!because the coating of the minced meat on the boiled egg was just so maddeningly yummm!!!the gravy was simply out of the world!!!perfectly paired with the rumali roti.
Next we ordered the mutton chap.another special dish on their menu.again this was lip smacking!!! The meat so tender!!!juicy and perfectly seasoned!!awesomely paired with more romali roti.:)
The food did impress us.so did the ambience.highly recommended.:)

For years I've heard, 'Royal-er biriyani khash ni, tahole r ki kheli'... So finally came my chance to taste the big daddy of Calcutta biriyani...

We had Reshmi Malai Kebab, Royal Mutton Biriyani, Royal Mutton Chaap and Firni...

Decor - The AC dining hall upstairs was quite shabby with unclean tables, wobbly chairs etc. But then, I didnt expect anything more.

Service - Serving time is impressive.
The kebabs came pretty fast inspite of a nearly full house.

Now to the Food -

Reshmi Malai Kebab - Okay. Nothing special.

Royal Mutton Biriyani - Surprisingly nothing special. Just like the biriyani of Arsalan minus the Aloo, which is an absolute negative point to me. & I always knew potato is the trademark of an authentic Calcutta biriyani.

Royal Mutton Chaap - It had the perfect blend of spices but nothing special.

Firni - Well I wont say its the best firni I ever had, but its wayyyyyy better than the ones served at Zeeshan/Arsalan/Shiraz.

Value for Money - Inexpensive.

Probably all the exaggerations about Royal got my expectations soaring, that the food here couldn't match. Overall the food is okay. But if you live in south calcutta like me, you dont have to travel this far. The restaurants at Park Circus could jolly well satisfy your biriyani craving.

So Atlast after hearing so much about ds place I finally ate here...wel let me say it almost lived up2 its hype..so here is da review-
1.location- they really need 2 do smethin about da location f da place cz its actually placed in a veryy crowded place n sometimes da crowed can b anoyin
2.ambience-i would give dem a 0/5 on this..but yeah it s not dose kind f places whr 'infrastructure' s a business policy. Bt I feel Wat dey can do atleast is dat get air conditioned , cz its a really crowded restraunt n dat adds 2 da discomfort.
3. Food- we ordered chicken royal biriyani and royal chicken chap...I shud admit both were up2 da mark...the biriyani had a nice little spice 2 it which adds 2 da taste..n da positive point was dat it dint have much f oil..it was li8 bt yet did not compromise on taste...da chicken pieces were well cooked n da whole dish had an authentic biriyani smell...next comes da chicken chap,the gravy of ds dish was really mouth watering,there s nice favour of da spices n goes wel wd da biriyani cz as da biriyani s a bit spicy n ds 1 has a smoked chicken taste...overall on da quality f food I gve ds place a 4/5 .
4.customer service- I must say service has many areas 2 improve on...cz dere is a lack f coordination between da da workers...n a bit f negligence when da crowed increases..overall sustomer services is a 2.7/5...
Price- price is reasonable n affordable bt availability of sme dishes only on certain days plays a spoil sport..price wil get a 3.5/5
Overview- this place is meant 4 normal day dine out...great tasty food bt have 2 compromise wd ambience n ease of eating etc...u won't get a whole table 2 urself unless u have enuf pple...1,2 or may b 3 pple wil have 2 share tables...still I wud say its doin gud wd its quality of food bt yes if it does improve on da location n ambience, services etc it wud get ahead in leaps n bounds..

Had read a lot about the food here and being a biriyani lover went there ASAP.
Let me say this , the place looks like the perfect biriyani place with the most amazing aroma of the food ¬†and the kebabs hanging , the crowded streets outside and a filled restaurant inside.
We went straight to the second floor since the ground floor was fully occupied. I have no complains against the prices and the peope serving were very attentive.
We ordered a half tandoori chicken , chicken biriyani , kadhai chicken and firni.
The tandoori chicken was good but nothing special.
The biriyani was an absolute disappointment . It was not expected but it wasnt good at all. The kadhai chicken was a "mughalized" version but tasted good enough.
The firni was the star of the day. Its the best I have tasted yet , perfect texture , perfect sweetness, nice colour.
Another thing which I didn't like was whatever I wanted to order was not available. Everything is ¬†available on thursdays or fridays or saturdays.
But still not losing hope on this one and wanna go and try out their famous Nargisi kofta and Shahi tukra and see if the bad biriyani was just a one day case.
So . .till we meet again.

By far the best Biryani and mutton chaap in calcutta. The chicken just melts in your mouth and the chaap is a foodies delight! Always order unless you're Ok with the ambience to eat in. Staff is snooty, tipping them 10 bucks may help you beat the long queue!

A vintage restaurant featured in the 'legendary' category of zomato, you can understand why wouldn't I give a long introduction to it. It's been an important pillar of the famous biriyani culture of Kolkata with their trademark 'no potato biriyani ' and not to mention they make one of the better chicken / mutton chaps in the city. After having the biriyani umpteen number of times finally my review goes.
Ambiance - it shouts the smell of old Kolkata. The lost system of cabin dining, the classic red uniforms, the same old Muslim waiters who had mastered the art of it over ages, it may not be the plush chic restro, but if you like old school you will like it.
2. Food - afterall that's why everyone comes here. We ordered 
1. Mutton Biriyani / Chicken Biriyani - That beautiful blend of saffron and white rice, beautifully cooked soft succulent pieces of meat, and that subtle aroma which I so miss in Ncr biriyanis. Eat it..you won't regret.
2. Mutton Chap - Because they are the best. Period. Not to spicy, not very mild, you won't find a better thing to polish away your biriyani plate.
3. Tandoor Roti - Soft fluffy rotis, this thing remains same pan India almost. 
4. Firni - Mughlai khana deserves a mughlai dessert. Firni, the moghul's fine inclusion in Indian kitchen by using ground rice flour and milk to make this thick flavourful bowl of wonder is another must have dessert in Royal.
Service - Fast, smooth order taking, absolutely hasslefree.
Price - very much fairly priced.
Overall, a place to visit definitely simply for their biriyani and chap.

Royal is one of the oldest biryani restaurant in kolkata.I've visited there many times.It is located at Rabindra Sarani near M.G.Road & Rabindra Sarani Crossing.They have many seating arrangements,one portion is fully air conditioned & other portion is non ac.Their biriyani is delicious.They don't give potato in their biriyani.I've tasted here chicken reshmi kebab,chicken chap with tandoori rooti & roomali rooti.Their chicken chap is also tasty.Service is quick.price is also reasonable.

And I always thought that this is the best place to have biryani and mughlai dishes in Kolkata , but after experiencing the much hyped Hyderabadi biryani i have no doubt that not only Kolkata it is may be the best place in entire India to have a mutton biryani and mutton chanp..

It's USP is its biryani , I had ordered for mutton biryani,chicken biryani and another   of their famous dessert "firni" ,it was mildly flavored milk product with saffron , good but not as per expectation. Talking about their biryani, fabulous! Its on a must have list of this place. Mughlai food lovers should at least give this place a visit. Ambience was good as well , they have separated dine in areas. Air-conditioned area was better than any other area. Staff was polite and fast. Service was very quick I got my order the very next minute I placed it. Recommended for food lovers! Give it a visit!

Ok so let me start by saying that this is my all time favourite restaurant so the review will be a bit biased. If you are a die hard Awadhi and Mughlai cuisine lover, you have to eat here before you die. One of many of family run restaurants where the premium dishes are made by hidden recipes. Order Mutton Chaap with Rumali roti, no problems just dig into it. The Chaap has so many flavours that with every bite your taste buds feel alive, the food gods have especially made this dish for experiencing culinary extravaganza. Coming to the biryani, the only Biryani you will ever taste where the rice beans have flavour in itself. The extracted juice of all the flavours infused into the biryani makes it the best one I have ever tasted. The ambience is the only problem but who cares when you are eating something that you will remember for a lifetime. I will end this long review just by pronouncing a maxim, if there is a dish that I can eat everyday till I die, it'll be the Mutton Chaap.

This was the first & worst experience, definitely the last experience as I am never going to visit this restaurant again. They claim their speciality is Biriyani & Chaap, But none of these were upto the expectation quality wise & the quantity was like they are giving us "Prassad" in a temple. On the top of that we ordered for chicken biriyani & they served the bill of mutton biriyani. Thank god we took a notice of this, normally which people won't do while spending quality time with family & friends & this restaurant wants to cash on this opportunity. After all this bad service when we refuse to give tips the waiter said " Baaksish nahi diya or chala aya hero ban ban ke ". So folks decide by yourself whether you want to give them an opportunity to ruin your happy time or not.

Dont go for ambience one again here ..... If u are Mughlai worshipper ..... Just go for it .... All kinds of mughlsi dishes availsble here .... I doubt they leave any body parts of that lil goat unattended there ! From brain chops to liver curry ... U can get everything ...

But they say they hav speciality in chaap ... But the chaap is generally full of grunfed bones .... So I do avoid it ...

Bit other dishes especially biriyani .... Tikia are really good...

Been here for dinner tonight again i.e. 23/04/3017.
No complaint about food quality (chicken biriyani, tandoori roti, rumsli roti, mutton rogan josh, sahi tukra, phirni) ; but a BIG NEGATIVE experience about their hospitality...
The waiter simply asked other customers to share table with us... Without at all asking for our opinion.
And we we opposed that we had to face ill-behaviour & tempered tone from the waiter !!!!
Never expect such behaviour from one of the heritage restaurants of Kolkata !

Its a nostalgia to have a dine at Royal always for any Biryani lovers....Place is much crowded always .. Its near by Md Ali park ,5-7 mins walking distance ..I have been there on last friday @ 10:30 pm... The takeover line was haveing approx 50 peoples ,,,we got our tables after waiting for 5-10minutes....
We ordered, Chinken biryani,mutton chap,tandoori chiken & m.pasanda.....
Needless to say the biryani & mutton chap was just waoooooooooooo... U will not find any better taste than this in & around kolkata,being a foodie & covered about alomst all the biryani resto in kolkata i can promice that... The tandoori ¬†& m.pasanda was also 22 delicious...
One can opt for sit on the 1st floor if they want to go with the family or closed ones..the ground floor was crowded always ... Its the most orthodox style of biryani that u can find over there...

Awesome mutton chaap. Just had this with naan rotis. Each naan was very large in size. Was lucky to visit it on a Wednesday so got the chance to taste the shahi tukra which was rich and delicious and took me to a different world. 
Tasted their mutton nihari kofta (Wed special). It was great. The minced mutton coating around a boiled egg has a pepper flavour and a mix of many spices.
The mutton pasinda seekh kebabs (Wed special) were once again something which I tasted here first. There are shredded mutton pieces which has the smokey aroma of kebabs and they are served in a gravy.

Another great destination for Biryani lovers. Some say they serve the best biryani in town. Went there on a Thursday night and boy there was a crowd ! The restro has an AC section on the 1st floor and non AC on the ground floor. We ordered CHICKEN TANDOORI for starters , which I found quite juicy . Then we ordered the CHICKEN BIRYANI , MUTTON BIRYANI , CHICKEN CHAP and CHICKEN REZALA . The biryani's were amazing and added a place in my heart. The chap though was a disappointment for it felt half cooked. The rezala had a thin gravy. Would certainly visit again to try their NARGIS KOFTA .

One think you should keep in mind before visiting them that they don't accept card....so have cash in your pocket & enjoy the spicy biriyani & chaap....

Kolkata Kalling!!!

A trip to Kolkata is not a trip till you visit the Royal Indian Hotel in Rabindra Sarani! Located on the Chitpur Crossing, this restaurant does not need any introduction to the average Bengali! Get into a taxi from any part of Kolkata and all you need to say is 'Royal Hotel' and that's it!

Traffic is an issue in the area and also being the tramway, expect delays to reach the restaurant. Don't be disappointed with the queues outside the place since it's just the parcel queue. 

The biryanis available here are a hit across this part of India and believe it or not but does not contain potatoes, a staple feed everywhere and other vegetables. It's just the rice and the meat depending on the Biryani you order. The rice is a consistent one inch or longer Basmati Rice with the right amount of spices. If you are the health conscious type, let me add, there is hardly any amount of oil and is just smooth!

Also do remember to ask for the daily special and try it with the piping hot Roomali Roti. I tried the Mutton Pasanda along with the Roomalis and would give a 5 star ranking for the same. Also they do have a family room upstairs but expect delays in getting a table. They also have an AC section but again the waiting time. With the whiff of the Biryani in the air, it would be difficult to control your hunger. Jump into the first available seat and relish your meal. 

A must visit each time and every time!

A word of advice, tip the server before placing order trust me you will not be disappointed.

Went there with a large group of friends during the puja of 2012. Had to wait for a long time before we could finally enter.
We had ordered a large variety of items starting from the signature biriyanis to the different kebabs n naans. I especially liked the chicken reshmi kebab. They serve huge quantities of food. Value for money is great. It cost us around 700 for 6 of us. Incredible!!!! As for the ambiance n service they are nothing worthy of mention. This is a typical north Kolkata restro unlike the posh n well maintained ones of the south. But overall a nice place for having quality food at reasonable price.

I had a plate of Mutton Biryani with Green Salad......
Biryani....I just loved it to heavy with oil or dalda....really light and oil does not stick to your hands after you wash it.... The smell was gr8 and it was not like that which will divulge you from having biryanis....

Hoping to go again to try some other dishes....

I had visited this in October to taste the Biryani.  The biryaani was good but too much ghee was there and I ordered for chicken bharta in which I found a lott of oil in it. I would suggest them to reduce the oil and ghee in there preparation otherwise the food taste was good sna quantity was nice according to price.  But in the same price I would suggest you to visit shiraz.

Royal....
As the name suggests, actually serves Biryani for the royale. Mutton Biryani, Mutton Champ combination is just awesome. I had Chicken Biryani n Chicken Champ aswell, but nothing matched the Mutton combination. The reataurant is right on Rabindra Sarani- a few steps from Chitpur Xing. Reaching the restaurant is very tough- absolutely No Parking zone. Loved the Biryani- Unlike Kolkata Biryanis, this one doesnt have potato or egg. The restaurant serves relatively lesser amount of rice and smaller piece of meat. But taste is awesome. Loved every bite of the rice and also the Champ.
Looking eagerly for a second visit.

Food- 5/5
Value for money- 3/5
Ambience- N/A. Takeaway recommended.

It is highly recommended.

The Best combination you can have is Mutton chap with Rumali roti and Biryani. 
Tandoori Chicken , Mutton pasinda Kabab are great too.

Just a lil info- When the Pakistan cricket team used to visit here they ordered food from Royal. It's no secret that their Mughal food is one of the best non veg you can have in Kolkata!

I am in love with this place..since my childhood royal has always been my favorite in terms biryani..i never got an opportunity to thank "royal" for serving the most tempting and the BEST biryani Kolkata's any other restaurant could even think for..
Its for sure that in a month we bring its parcels at our place..and it was just yesterday that i simply followed the word 'dig in' after seeing the parcel at my place.. mutton chaap is also the best among all..my entire family is big fan of royal and I hope this restaurant keep serving food they have been serving till date..a biggg thumbs up..cheers..:) :) :)

The only eatery to which I can afford to give a 5 point votes.Their biriyani is the most heavenly biriyani I've ever tasted.I came here first as a child with my dad.Then it became m one stop place for biriyani whenever I;m in burrabazar for any big or small purpose.For me,it makes the best biriyani in whole Kolkata.Loveeee youuuu..

Biryani is great. Its light nd filling. But comes without potato nd egg.  But one wont get all d items every item in side dish like pasinda nd nargis kofta. They all have designated days.

Being a hardcore non-vegetarian, I love the food of this place..

We ordered a take away comprising chicken chap, chicken curry, chicken biryani, chicken reshmi kabab and roomali roti..everything was very tasty..chicken reshmi kabab was ok..chap was good though it had lack of spicies..

Overall the food is good..I am not very sure about the ambience as we usually take away food from here..

Whooo !! Royal Indian Hotel is an old Restaurant in Calcutta situated at Rabindra Sarani just near (MG ROAD) crossing & Nakhoda Mosque.The ambiance is okay at the upper side. You will find too much rush at the ground floor. Take away is present at there. So that is also the main reason. They are taking reasonable price

So come to the food ..
The Royal shows their royalty in Chaap & Biryani . I bet u had not like tat .
The speciality of biryani is that they dont serve Aloo & the Taste is just awesome 4.5/5 
Both Mutton/Chicken chaap is the best part of Royal. Taste it only with ROOMALI rotis . 
U can try Mutton Pasinda boti/barra kabab
Chicken tikka butter masala is too good/ Tandoori is only good .

If u r experiencing first time or not Please dont try Chicken liver/keema/rezala .

Their mutton is so delectably cooked .. It's really really inexpensive.. The chap, the kebabs and of course the mutton biriyani, though a little oily is simply top drawer.. The location makes it a slight disadvantage as car parking in the area is a real nightmare.. All in all, a fabulous place to dine!  :)

Being a single non-veg nd Mughalai, outlet in Bara Bazar area , people of the area hav no option's, the signature chicken chap,  nd mutton keema were so so,  not to that mark as hyped, The Biryani is in very less quantity with very small piece of chicken nd without potato,  u have to take a side dish apart from Biryani. . ......"Naam bade Darshan chote"........you hardly get parking over there,  it is in most crowded area of Bara Bazar. ......suggested only if you are in Bara Bazar area otherwise go for other options

I have heard so much about this restaurant from my friends. So this Independence day I along with 3 of my friends went to Royal for a lunch here.. We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Chap and Mutton Pasinda Kabab.. The biriyani was really good though still not the best I had.. Mutton Chap was excellent.. But the best one was the Mutton Pasinda Kabab.. It was brilliant, the boneless mutton was a treat to have.. In the end we ordered Firni Which was also quite good. I would recommend you to try the Mutton Pasinda Kabab if you ever visit this restaurant.

Good food always topples over the ambience of the restaurant.  This restro proves the above statement.  If u go to royal its sheer good food that you will appreciate. Nonetheless the mutton biryani n chicken chaap r the age old possession of this restro.  The biryani cooked to finesse.  Even the one who hates biryani ( me me n me) is bound to fall in love. On wednesdays n saturdays. Try the nargisi kofta. I think dis tasty  kofta u ll never get anywhere in let alone kolkata..but also india. A must try.

One of the oldest restaurant serving biryani in Kolkata. Without any doubt serves the best biryani in Kolkata. Lot of people don't know about this restaurant. But trust me if you are looking for best biryani then you have to visit this place. Service and ambience again not good. But that makes up for the best biryani served here. I am having their biryani since my childhood. Though their quality has dropped a bit but still good enough to rule the rest. Must have for biryani lovers, highly recommended.

On one of our 'Rediscover The City' days two of my friends and I came to the restaurant we have heard so much about but never had a chance to visit. If you are a stranger to the streets of North Calcutta then it will take you quite some time to locate this place. Luckily, we took a tram and it dropped us right in front of it. We were immediately let down by the look of the restaurant. We took a table in the AC dining room as the non-ac one was not appropriate for three girls.
Now coming to food, we had high hopes as recently one of our equally food-loving friends had tasted the biriyani from here and said it was heavenly. And boy, was he right! When I put the first spoon of mutton biriyani in my mouth it seemed like I have died and come to some kind of biriyani heaven. It is arguably the best one can find in Kolkata. Not too oily, not too spicy, it had the right amount of scent. And the mutton was so soft! We also ordered a side of Chicken Chaap which was equally yum. Of course, these were not enough for gluttons like us. A full Chicken Tandoori was then asked to bring. The huge pieces of chicken that we got for such a nominal price was unbelievable! Lastly, I had to have phirni, which was good.

Want to taste Mutton chaps and other Muglai fare , Royal is the place. The place is crowded and bit shabby. However there is a place to sit up stirs. 



Mutton Chaps are goats ribs or pieces of meat cooked in spices. This dish with significant Mughal influenced has developed as something Bengal can claim its own.The smell is simply beaconing.

This is very old restaurant. The biryani is awesome. I think better than the Arsalan's. Everything is adequate, the spice, the scent, oil, the soft piece of meat...... But the quantity is very very less. The keema is good. But I have a real objection about the firni. The service is super quick. The location is in a very busy place(not their fault).

Aaaah Royal, my lovely Royal. Without any doubt in my mind, this place serves the best Biryani in Kolkata.
The rice is so tasty and the cook on the chicken/mutton is perfect. A tip for the chicken eaters. Always go for the "seena boti" rather than the leg piece.
Their chicken chap is brilliant, which is cooked in a charcoal fire, adding a lovely smoky flavor.
I always order the tandoori chicken and it is soft and succulent.
And the sweet ending. Their Firni is simply brilliant. Sweet taste and great texture.
Best Biryani place in Kolkata for me.

No,its not a very hep or sophisticated place to dine in, it doesn't have a fancy environment or a posh ambience . It is located in one of the busiest and noisiest streets of Kolkata ¬†. The A.C dining hall on the first floor is clean but has nothing extravagent about it. That is, the impression until the plates of food arrive in front of you. And then its pure bliss in the form of a light aromatic Biriyani which is so tasty that you can actually eat it without any sides. It has a hint of pepper which will last on your palate for quite some time. The mutton in the biriyani is soft and tender, as well cooked as possible. We incidentally took side plates, Mutton Chap which was good but nothing striking about it, and Mutton Pasinda, which was probably the highlight of the evening. It is a boneless mutton preperation, mildly spicy with a very authentic Mughlai taste, not as greasy as the Chap and sings beautifully well with the light Biriyani. It makes your day.We wanted Shahi Tukra for desert but beacuse it was not available we had to satisfy ourselves with a Firni, which was once again good but nothing outstanding.We visited the place during Ramzan , and the entire area was bubbling with life and people. It definitely is a place to be if one seeks for authentic Mughlai flavours and the old world charm of this city.

Royal serves probably one of the best biryani and chaaps in town. Its one of those places where you would prefer traveling an extra mile for biryani. Its not heavy for the wallet but at the same time they will serve you the best biryani and chaap. The ambiance in not that good, Its probably the only weak zone for the restaurant. But if ambiance is not your matter of concern den its just perfect. Its a biryani lovers dream.

Royal Indian Hotel serves the Heritage Lucknawi style Biryani and the best Awadhi cuisines in Kolkata. Got reference from a close friend of mine and read so much about the hotel was determined to explore and this Wednesday was a day when I could visit the hotel .A rain soaked afternoon with running water at Chitpur lane I could manage to get a seat in the hotel . Being an avid lover of awadhi cuisine I could notice the hotel had packed seats and a long queue waiting for their turn for the takeaway (Lunch possibly)
BIryani cooked in small vessels emptying every 15 minutes with the moving orders of the hungry customers and the takeaways .I noticed most of the people were ordering Royal Biryani(Mutton/Chicken),Roti with Chicken/Mutton Chap.

What we ordered :
The Royal Chicken Biryani : Melting Chicken with finest basmati cooked to its perfection in charcoal fire
Chicken Qalia/Masala : Succulent chicken in yellow indian gravy
Chicken Malai Kebab : Creamy tender chicken kebab with cream

I must say this was a treat to have the Royal Indian Hotel cuisines and I was truly delighted with the mesmerizing flavor. Not for ambiance but for the food grade they maintain a must for the foodies and Awadhi lovers.Also should take cash as they don't accept card and they don't charge service tax.

Hats off to the Royal Indian Hotel :)

Liked the Mutton Biryani too but they never offer a special with 2 pieces and my luck with mutton pieces were never acceptable. Hope can swap the pieces with Arsalan's..
Best part is park the car at no parking in front and make the security happy when you leave... Helps when you visit with family.

This had been one of the most yummiest destinations of mine to satisfy my taste buds but today was a whole shocking scenario.An uncivilized customer creeps into and walks pass by me where I was having my stuff and he with his wet hands spread all the shit over my food.This was so pathetic.The waiter asked me to sit so that he could repeat the order.I chose to walk off by making the payment because of unworthy managers who kept on chatting & din't respond to my complaint.This is even amazing coz it took place upstairs where I believed I could be sharing seats with sophisticated people around.

Royal Indian Hotel :No problem in finding where it is as the delightful smells that drift to your nose themselves give you the direction.This place is the only place that has lived up to  what it was in the olden days.It has it's own originality-No potatoes in Biriyani.A blow it may seem to some who are reading my review but to be truthful the place still gets hundreds visitors a day and towards the night, at around 8 pm it's biriyani is almost sold out.Ambiance does not matter here as we all know.We  had ordered Reshmi kebabs,Mutton biriyani,Mutton Chaap and Butter Naan.The reshmi kebab was really good and soft.Biriyani was the one of the best I have ever had and I suddenly knew after one gulp why this playce has a "royal" in front of it's name.The butter Naan was equally soft but the chaap was a bit dry and disappointing all you have heard about it.This place is also quite cheap and according to me- Hungry? Not much in the pocket? Near Bara Bazar? Go for Royal..

I think i visited this place when i was like may be 8 or 9 years old . I simply love biryani and this place will always be on top of my list . Its located near barabazar or zakria street i guess n its a busy street and congested too . 
Its more than 15 years and i can say that nothing has changed about it . The taste the aroma the flavour of that biryani its all same . Plus there firni is my favourite . 
I have also tried mutton chapp which is really spicy if u are not a spicy food lover then please do not try it . 

There is nothing called as ambience in royal but the biryani can't be compared to any other thing . After all its not ambience u gonna eat its the food . :)

Not everything needs good ambiance and classy waiters.  This is a place you go to when you wanna hog on Mutton Chaap (pasanda). Biriyani was good too, but not even close to Arsalan's. Also, the quantity of the biriyani was not good. The mutton chaap on the other hand was sumptuous and finger licking good (not to confuse with any food chain's tagline). Mughlai food lovers should give this a try.

The mutton biriyani and chicken chaap is best combination to have over here. taste is really good and recommendable.  biriyani is not so rich and less oily, does not consist egg or potato.
The cons are its location and crowd control. The biriyani quantity is very less. Also they don't have too many options, but i should say they are maintaining the legacy...

Let put it in this way... Don't go there. 

It was probably once famous for it's biriyani and chaap. But those are bygone days.

Biriyani lacks pretty much everything. Plain, bland. Not at all tasty or mouth-watering. Quality of rice is significantly poor. Aroma distinct to an authentic biriyani is so faint, that it can be mistaken for pulao or fried rice. Amount is less for the price paid. Both the potato piece and egg is missing.

Chaap.....well, you have to be told what it is to understand.

Opt for dada-boudi biriyani, dhakai biriyani, arsalaan for much more authentic & tastier version.   

If possible i would have given no stars....

when i went to Royal for the first time, i was in my late tweens. it struck a chord and it remained so over the years. while there have been many eateries offering u mughlai/north Indian cuisine, Royal has remained a vintage.
my rating of 4.0 is purely and solely on food. unsuitably located at a stone's throw from Nakhoda masjid, this eatery has an old world charm that defines Calcutta. the mutton chaap is different from other eateries in the spices. the price is quite cheap. and the food is just awesome. don't leave without having their Biriyani.

To start with,i am very nostalgic about this place.Since childhood i heard stories from my father that the name that comes after the word biryani was ROYAL..This is one of the most popular biryani joints in kolkata.
Situated at one of the most busiest place in Kolkata i.e Burrabazar, the best way to get to this restaurant is to get down at M.G.Road crossing and take the route towards howrah,stop at the Chitpur and Harrison road crossing and take a left and walk for around 2mins u will find the name of ROYAL on ur right hand side.
The first thing u would notice at the entrance of Royal is a man cooking chanp and mutton tikia the aroma of which will surely drive u crazy.
It has a ground floor section and also a first floor section.the first floor section has an AC and a non AC section..the ground floor is generally conjested so it is suggested to take the first floor if u r going with your family..
Now coming to the main thing i.e the food,the biryani that is served here is not the usual ones we have i.e it will not have a potato or an egg.the biryani served here is spicy and is different.
The dishes that we ordered were:-
1.Chicken Biryani
2.Chicken Chanp
3.Mutton Tikia
4.Rumali Roti 
5.Salad
6.Shahi Tukda
I wanted to take pictures of food that we ordered it was in my mind.But as the foods were served i forgot everything and pounced on it..
What i felt that the rice was a bit overcooked but the taste was really good.it was spicy awadhi style biryani that is served here and not at all dry.the chanp as we all know is the speciality of ROYAL so its the best here no doubt about it.the tikia is also good atleast i like Royal's tikia the most as it is soft and cooked to perfection.And since it was a sunday so i ordered Shahi Tukda.Shahi tukda is available only on wed,fri and Sunday..it was beautifully garnished and tasted good....Our total bill was Rs.383..Overall it was a very good experience at royal..the waiter was also very attentive..But what may concern many people is the ambience.So if u r not concerned about the ambience you should surely visit this place.
No doubt that the food really comes from heaven.This is a place everyone should visit.And i am eagerly waiting for my next visit to this place.

=====================================================================================================
Reviewed on 6th August 2015:

Well in my last review i did not post any picture..So after a lot of frequent visits since my last review i am here to mention some other items i had..
1. To start with..Its The RAMZAM SPECIAL HALEEM which is avaiable only during ramzan month and to my opinion its the best haleem i had in the city..A proper mixture of spices and dal and the mutton pieces are tender and soft enough to melt in your mouth..
2.¬†Mutton Keema is another item i had which is a worth mention..The taste is awesome..Its rich and spicy enough and have it with roomali roti to get its actual taste..The mutton keema has a huge demand hence it wont be available in the evening..
3.The Nargisi Kofta..Its basically boiled Egg surrounded with keema and fried then dipped in the gravy..Available only on Wednesday and Saturday..Not veryyyy tasty or anything special..But yes it is beautifully made and gravy is very light but on the oily side..
4.The Mutton Chaap..Needless to say as its the speciality of ROYAL..

Have been to this restaurant since my schooldays! Always found out their service and food quality to be good. One should specially try out Murgh Musallam, which has to be booked in advance. Biryani is equally popular here.

This  was quite a different experience, I am going to be brutally honest about it no matter what..

The first set of expectations I had was skyhigh and after hearing so much about it, visited the place with my team and boss. It was quite the usual and ambience is not the criteria here.. I hoped the walk was worth it. We ordered Mutton Biryani, Mutton Chap and butter naan and salad. 
The first set of biryani that came in had broken rice and was not palatable, so my boss who is a huge foodie looked at it and decided to send it back. The waiter came, argued and was extremely rude and told us that it could not be changed, so we got up to leave.
Then an elderly waiter came and enquired about the problem and told us he would get everything replaced. We were a bit miffed but decided to sit down and wait. The biryani was changed and I tucked in..It was ok but nothing out of the world and honestly a lot more hype than anything else. I have tasted biryani all over the world in different places and it is a taste that I know from childhood, anything falling short is disappointing to say the least. The chap was ok and tasted good with the butter naan.
There is a lot of euphoria about this place, but if you ask me to go again I would think thrice!!!

This place evokes nostalgia. The 1st ever biriyani I ever tasted was from this place, even though I never visited there as a child (my father got parcels and we had it in home).  Since my teenage days I have visited this place on numerous occasions and the last one being 6 months back. So its quite apt to write my 1st review in Zomato for this place. 
Their quality has deteriorated I must admit, but the essence of their signature dishes remains the same. The 2 most popular and my personal favorites are mutton biriyani and mutton chaap. 
The biriyani they prepare is a 100% Awadhi biriyani without the quintessential potato and the egg which one finds in the Calcutta biriyani.  Legend has it that the founder of ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù was the actual khansama of the ousted nawab of awadh, ‚ÄúWajid Ali Shah‚Äù. Now Calcutta biriyani is an offshoot of the Awadhi biriyani, the added ingredients being potato and egg. The aroma and flavours of the biriyani is so enriching that it totally compensates for the potato and egg. It is unique and quite stunning.
The 2nd Signature dish of ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù is their mutton chaap, which is dry and peppery and goes best with the rumali rotis. Again this is unique because it does not have gravy unlike other restaurants.

The other dishes are also quite good especially the keema and pasinda. 

Overall this place is a must visit for any true blue calcuttan if one is not too fussy about ambience.

I was on my way to a meeting,  and then it happened I poked out the cab's window and there it was Royal it read in big attention grabbing letters. Though my destination was somewhere else but I got down in front of Royal. As you stand in front of the restaurant you cannot help but notice the awesome chaaps melting away and the aroma waking up the foodie among us. So climbed the not so wide stairs in a matter of seconds and thank god it was not packed. Secured a table and suddenly realised that there was someone else with me. When I looked behind I saw her standing and man she was pissed. The only question shebhad was how can you forget someone because of food. Well I didn't respond but ordered two mutton biryanis and a keema along with a chicken chaap. The order was fulfilled swiftly and as you all know sometimes the quantity of the biryani leaves you wanting more so I ordered a third one too. If you overlook the amount of oil in the dishes served then they are just blissful. Don't forget to grab a bite here you won't regret.

Now i join my new Office which is just near Burrabazar. The food is splendid in this area and for price which compared to the taste and quantity is nothing. But then a month passes and i am bored of all the Veg Food i am indulging myself into. No offense but i have needs for some flesh. Here i am looking at almost no options for non veg as far as my work area is concerned and like an angel from an unsung gospel my colleague takes me to a place just behind my office... The ROYAL INDIA Hotel. It was a Friday i remember and we had to wait a good 20 minutes...not because the tables where all taken but because the afternoon kalma was in progress and it was a divine site to adhere to. We enter this huge hall where simple table and chairs are put up, and we are welcomed with the divine smell of biriyani which entices my taste buds. We order for a mutton biriyani, mutton chaap and Bara Kebab. I look for some raita but i see they are not in the menu. The food arrives in 5 minutes max piping hot. The biriyani rice is like the long luscious finger of very beautiful woman , mutton melted in the mouth and the spices where as if engineered to act as an aphrodisiac, but for food ;)  The kebab was succulent juicy and the mutton chap was just perfect to the T. With all the Arsalaning off lately...this was a pleasant and divine surprise cooped up in the a midst the busiest part of Kolkata. I quite frequented the joint henceforth. Warning: If you are looking for posh interiors and and luxurious ambiance Royal is not the place for You. But if you are in for good food and i mean Mouth watering, Muscle clenching good food then Royal Is the place to be.
Must Haves:
1. Mutton or Chicken Biriyani(They are without Potato, but who cares)
2. Mutton Chaap
3. Tandoori Rotis
4. Burra Kebabs
5. Chicken Reshmi or Tikka Butter Masala.
6.Firni.

This restaurant is 150 years old & part of heritage of Kolkata.If you are going from Shyambazar, you can reach via Central avenue,Mahajati Sadan Metro stop,then turn right & reach Mechua(famous fruit market). On the left side there is a road with lots of lorries and vans standing. Don't be misled, it is actually a road!! Take the road by  turning left. Then via a U turn towards right you  reach Rabindra Sarani . As you go towards the  Mosque(further right) you find the Royal on your left.Quality of rice is excellant & well cooked though  the Mutton Biriyani which we tasted was bit spicy especially for children.Overall a delicious fare !!

Alright my friend Poorna who has enough knowledge about Kolkata's restaurants to write a book on it had introduced me to this place and I openly am admitting my love for her for doing so. It was on a hot day that she took em there after a catastrophic disaster with the navigation. Yes, my friends she knows the places but to get there I suggest you trust yourself and people around :P Well quite frankly the area calls for girls to dress a bit conservatively. I mean I am not sexists but am a huge believer of dressing appropriately for a location and believe me when I say I ask you to dress in Indian attires with old fashioned dupattas for a reason .

The place is of course not fancy but the food will take you straight to heaven. Their biriyani has become my favourite one in town and I blame Poorna because after having the biriyani there I cannot eat biriyani from any other joint in Calcutta. What you get here is quite different from the usual Kolkatan biriyani because for starters it does not have potatoes and the spice content is much less than what a usual Calcuttan biriyani calls for and these two are the very reasons why I love it but then to each his own. What I also did like was that there wasn't any powerful flavour of kewra water or rose water.   While Poorna has openly stated that she does not feel  the chanp of this eatery is the best in town yet says that  it good enough, one bite and I realize , that  for me it is the best in town again. and why? Thick gravy stuck tot he chicken , no oil , soft meat flavours which cannot be expressed in words. I do not need further explanation. 

Too bad the place is a bit off the route for me but if I am having biriyani from now on there can only be one place I am heading to. 

When I told my father I had visited Royal he felt nostalgic but I got my share of scolding for going to that area but then again I told him I had a catwoman with me . So boys and girls ladies and gentleman do try and go in a group even if you want to pick up a few items . That is my advice , whether you take it or not is up to you.

Perhaps the only Biryani joint I knew as a child though the taste didn't changed a bit since two decades ( for better ). The most light flavoured and soft textured biryani u can ever have in Kolkata, though u alwayz miss the Aloo in ur biryani but its better for a change. No one can make chicken chap and mutton keema like Royal which is always tough to avoid. The only negative is they don't take any Credit / Debit cards and the worst part is they are so Proud about it.

Royal is located somewhere near barrabazar area in the main road and has been some of the famous food joints from my grand fathers time. Few months back, as many guests had arrived in my home we had ordered from here. The food which we had ordered was:-

1) Mutton Chaap - Which was on my recommendation of my father and my grand father. They said its the best out here in royal which even i tried and it was very tender and melting. I would like to recommend all my foodie friends to try it for sure. 
2) Chicken and mutton biriyani- The biriyani was okay. However, i have had tasted better biriyani before. 
3) Mutton Keema- It was superb and outstanding. 

However all the dishes had a lot of oil content in it. Those who want to have healthy food its a big no no for them. However, taste wise its pretty moderate. 

I would like all my foodie friends to make a takeaway from here because i did not like the ambience much though.

Price wise it was moderately okay. 

However, the quality has degraded over the period of time.

My first visit to Royal was when I was in school; I remember that we took a tram from Howrah Stn to Chitpur. And, I distinctly remember the dishes we ordered- Mutton Chanp, Rumali Roti and Mutton Biriyani. The biggest tribute I can give to that place and its dishes is that I still go there to have the Mutton Chanp, Biriyani and Firnyi- it simply brings back the memory of my very first visit there. The Mutton Chaanp is simply a work of art here; the mutton is more shredded than in lump pieces and is pretty dark and menacing in its looks but the taste is awesome and delicious. If one is not concentrating on eating it with the complete attention it deserves (which is basically impossible!!) then the chaanp tends to get a tad dry at the end of the 2 nd roti but nevertheless, the plates are all generally spotlessly clean without a trace of oil or anything else at the end of the meal. I guess that is enough testimony. The biriyani does not have alu/potato which is different from the general Biriyani that is served elsewhere in the city. But, the mutton is simply superbly spiced and perfectly cooked for the right softness yet the fibrous nature of the meat remains.  I also enjoy the Mutton Tikiya and the Mutton Korma there; both of which are perfect renditions of the mutton in the best of taste and panache. It is best to go during lunch time which extends up to late afternoon of 3-4 pm. The ground floor is pretty crowded and not really conducive for a group or a family; it is better to go to the First Floor in that case but be a little careful with the steep steps. One of the best ways to see and feel Kolkata is to have a walk through the lanes by the Nakhoda Masjid and look at the Chikan fares on the streets or my personal preference, take a tram..... unforgettable.

FOOD: The biryani in this place is actually yummmyy! The flavor of the rice is stronger than the usual biriyani. The only sad part it doesn't have the succulent aloo we all (at least in Calcutta love).

LOCATION :  It in a very busy street , not some place you would like roaming around . If you're around the proximity , then do drop in!

GOOD : Food is yummy. You have an AC section. The toilets are surprisingly clean.

BAD : Waiter's are not that warm. I 'didn't even get my chance back, he just presumed it was his tip !

There are two class of people, 
1) who are insane about Royal biryani
2) who don't at all like the biryani here
Biryani here is totally different from what you will get in other kolkata restaurants. This restaurant is one of a kind and is one of the oldest, not only in Kolkata but in India. The still make biryani in small utensils rather than the big ones chosen by other restaurants. Royal continues to sell Lucknow style food to the best. Biryani here is unlike all kolkata restaurant is without potato. Biryani is very light and well blend with spices so as  to just make you eat more and feel good. Mutton chaanp in Royal is  very famous(though I personally prefer chicken). The masala served with chaanp is one of a kind and tastes awesome with Royal's rumali roti, rumali roti here is made with atta+maida to make it more healthy. Traditional tandoori chicken served here, which are less fried and more roasted. One should try Mutton Pasinda served here which is served only on Wednesday, Sunday. It is totally awesome. 
Do not miss a chance to go to Royal if you are in the city and if you turn out to be the 1st class of people then you'll soon start getting cravings for Royal India food.. :)

For me,their biryani and mutton chanp is simply the BEST in Kolkata. Period. The hotel has zero ambience, arrogant staff, situated on chitpur road (rabindra sarani), which is the heart of burrabazar, ensuring that parking is almost impossible.Yet, this place manages to drag us from our place in south kolkata to it quite regularly just for these two items.and apparently it is the case for many many other calcuttans, as it is evident from the looong queue on the ground floor for its takeaway.
Now the food.
The biryani is much spicier than the rest of the well known joints like arsalan, and no potatoes. It is of a shade deeper yellow than normal Kolkata biryani.but once you taste it, simply heaven. I heard that the pakistani cricketers whenever they are on a visit to kolkata order biryanis from Royal, as they feel this is the closest cousin of Lahori biryani they can get in Kolkata.Paired with Chanp, or even on its own with raita, it is DELICIOUS.
Another star is the mutton Chanp.It has got several small pieces of mutton(with bones) in a dark coloured spicy oily gravy.The sight is not too pretty, with no efforts on presentation, but the aroma, and ultimately the taste can blow you away.Paired with onion rings and mint chutney and thin roomali roti,this is pure bliss.
11/10 :)

In a nutshell:

Legendary in the 1950s & 60s, this eatery impressed YUMMRAJ with quite a few dishes. 

Short Description ‚Äì in case u r in a hurry:

I have of course heard the name of Royal many times but never had really taken the trouble to go there due to the mixed reviews I used to get. People wud say that ‚Äòit used to b good but not that good now. Arsalan is better‚Äô etc. So when my friend & connoisseur of Mughal food recommended me to go here, I decided to take the plunge.

Well, for us, to have good food no amount of challenge is a challenge. We chose a weekday (assuming it wud be relatively less crowded) & drove to chitpur. Trying to park the car there can b a nightmare. So it is prudent to take public transport / go in a car with a driver.

The restaurant is in different levels. It has a large signage outside & is difficult to miss. Even if u miss it, everyone there knows about Royal. So to find the place is not a big deal I must say. 

The Ground floor is (my version) Economy Class. It has fans to cool the diners, has tables & chairs in a congested way & is full of activity all day long. This is infact where u get the real; feel of the place. A part of the Kitchen is also visible from here. 

A narrow flight of stairs takes one up to level 2 which is a bit more ‚Äòfamily restaurant‚Äô kind. This one is non airconditioned. When I say narrow I mean only one person can go in one direction. The rest wait at the other end of the staircase. I guess there r close to 30 steps in the staircase & that makes for a good little workout before u delve into buckets of greasy food.

A level above is the airconditioned section which is more of a regular A/C restaurant feel. Waiters here r more seasoned & are pretty trained to deal with people who r paying more for the same food that is available in all three levels.
The menu card was short & crisp ‚Äì 2 pages & focused. It just listed the iems. No description, no pictures of dishes. 
There was an interesting writeup on the back of the menu card.

I loved the taste of the food in general. Liked some curries more than the fabled Biryani. The dish & all others at this restaurant was made with ‚Äòdalda‚Äô - they tasted good but wud solidify if not eaten hot. Surely not the best thing for health but who cares about all that while being nice to the tastebuds. I usually look forward to opportunities in the next few days to workout extra & burn the extra fat.

Detailed Description ‚Äì In case u have the Time to NJOY reading:

We started our lunch with Mutton champ & roti. This is a signature dish of royal. It had numerous small pieces of mutton some boneless & some with rib bones. It had a peppery, grainy, minimalistic gravy that was dark brown in color. The taste was very spicy, robust & very rustic. Super loved it & rate it 4.75/5

Post that we moved to Mutton tikia. These were large tikias, the size of burger patty. These were made the traditional way ‚Äì Not machine minced but hand minced. That was evident from the taste & texture of the meat. Thus the patty was very juicy inside & had robust taste & flavors. I rate it 4.5/5

Mutton handi was a mutton gravy dish & was just outstanding. There was makhana & full red chillies visible in the gravy. Rest of the masalas had been well cooked & none retained their original look. The presence of a lot of onion juice had ensured that the gravy had a mild natural sweetness. The balance of the dish was super awesome ‚Äì salt, sweet & hotness. It being one of the best dishes I had this Pujo I rate it very high at 4.9/5.

Mutton biryani was different from the version that Shiraz & Arsalan have. The long grains of aromatic rice were soft but not melt in the mouth. The biryani was greasier & spicier than the one at Shiraz. The spice mix was a tad different & there was a ‚Äòhot‚Äô aftertaste. There was no aloo or boiled egg in the Biryani. One plate Biryani had only 1 piece of mutton. Arsalan has an option of ‚ÄòSpecial Biryani‚Äô that has 2 pieces in 1 plate. No such option was available at Royal. I rate the rice of the Biryani 4/5
The lone mutton piece in the Biryani was quite big though. It was just outstanding. It was super soft,melt in the mouth & totally non-fibrous. It had an intense taste to it. I rate the mutton in the Biryani 4.8/5

Overall the flavors of the meats, spices & rice intermingled well & we were happy with our Biryani. I rate this 4.4/5

For desserts we tried Phirni. This was thick, subtle in flavors & unidirectionally sweet ‚Äì Not too sweet. The extent of cashew & milk was less as compared to the best I have had. I rate it 3/5

We also tried Shahi tukra for dessert. It was sweet but had a nice hint of salt in it. The base was of course bread & atop was a 1.5mm thick layer of inhouse made milk cream. The shahi tukra was garnished with super super thin slices of almonds that started looking like kesar from a distance. Liked it quite a bit & rate it 4/5

Overall the rating of food at Royal averages out to 4.25/5. I am super keen to get back there to try the other dishes. Till then alvida‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

For people who are not familiar with Royal, let me warn you, we as children would be going to barabazaar to pick dad up from his office. and we would park near royal. I come from vegetarian family, and to be very precise, this is the reason why i am a non vegetarian. 

In those days you could smell royal's biriyani from far. people who have been there will know how polluted the place is  and what kind of traffic is outside royal. In that traffic if a restaurant food can be smelt from at least 200 m, believe me its one hell of a biryani. i like thier reshmi kebabs and other tandori items here. 

Just a suggestion , don't eat veg stuff here... at least the Paneer tikka is very below average 

Over the years the quality has come down. But cant blame them for it . 

the chaap is to die for and the biriyani is still very good. Well it used be a favorite for my grand father, my father ate his first chicken reshmi kebaba here, and i ate my first biryani here. 

the ambiance is nothing great, but when u go to a place like Royal, you don't go for the ambiance, its the food, which has quite a fan following. After all Royal is one of the oldest biriyani palces in kolkata and to survive a charade of restaurants is quit a task. 

Salute !

heard about the place from almost each and everyone, had an urge to go since a year but couldn't make time. atlast went there last Saturday for lunch, the area is too much congested, we went for the a.c. hall, the place is good. the a.c. portion do not have much tables, thankfully we got a table without any waiting. we had heard that the biryani they serve in a plate is a bit less compared to that served in other renowned restaurants. we ordered for a plate of Royal mutton biryani, Royal chicken biryani and a Royal chicken chap, a firni and a salad. they serve the lucknow biryani, i.e. without any piece of potatao or egg unlike the ones we are habituated to get in kolkata biryani. we didn't have to wait for the food to come. I personaly did not like the biryani, nor the taste of it. the rice seemed over-cooked to me, there were lumps too, the quantity was also less as we had heard earlier (the price though is almost the same as compared to other well-known biryani restuarnts of the city). the royal chiken chap tasted completely gross, the chicken was just a tiny bit, even smaller than the chicken served in the chicken biryani (both the dishes cost almost the same though  :D  ) and smelled of absolute dalda. yew!! i felt even the small shops and cabins in our neighbourhood serve better biryani than this royal one. will never go back there. the firni tasted very good, they served good quantity of mixed green salad in a low price. our total bill was Rs. 482 including vat and service tax. I didn't like their food at all. why would anyone go there at such congested locality if they can find a much better place serving much much better food in the same price or less?
but I must say the staffs there are very very loyal.

Royal India Hotel‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶located in the ever-busy Rabindra Sarani area of  Burrabazar ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..was a name synonymous with the Biryani loving people of Kolkata  for decades together!
The connect between Royal & Biryani was quite like this......‚ÄúWhen you think of Biryani‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it must be Royal!‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..something like the Jenson & Nicholson ad‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.".When you think of color think of us"! . People would in fact queue up to carry Biryani for their  family way back from office, during week-ends in particular! 
Although more famous & popular with the Kolkatan‚Äôs  for  its Mutton  Biryani & Chicken Chaap ,  I somehow  liked  the Mutton Rezala  more than their  Biryani  and always preferred  to have it  with karak  tandoori roti ! I still feel that the Rezala prepared here  is unmatched ,with only Sabir coming next to it, even though their monopoly for Biryani has taken a hit with Arsalan around.
Royal still  does have its appeal  with a large section of the people of Kolkata who are its dedicated customers for ages and  value what they get  for their money ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.a real  Royal Indian treat !

My Summer training days were great because of one reason "Royal Indian Hotel". Located in the heart of Bara Bazar, it has variety of items that makes your day. Mutton/Chicken Chap ,  Punjabi Mutton Tikka Masala, Mutton Pasinda kabab are the one to look out for. Naans and tandoori roti are also great. 
And you can always have Firhni as dessert afterwards as the food is spicy sometimes.

Service: 3.5/5

Their chap is in hall of fame, but, honestly, I like their roti and biryani too. Chap is very different than similar other places, but definitely very tasty (and VERY spicy too). your food adventure for moglai food (awadhi style) is not over until you come here and taste their chap. Very crammed a place because always full.

This is one of those places where a staircase goes up straight from the crowded hawker, parking infested pavement of a busy north kolkata road. It is for brave hearts to take a leap of faith and go up the dark, dingy and dangerous looking stairs in search of an old restaurant which city foodies have long considered a class above the rest in mughlai cuisine. I've lived my entire life in the Southern fringes of the city and this was sort of a new experience for me.
The upstairs is different to say the least. The decor is nice and bright if not too specialised. There's a family feel to the place, a testimony to the large family sitting just beside us. The number of seats are slightly lesser than what a restaurant of this fame should have. So, there may be a bit of waiting. But the servers are courteous and service is quick. Be sure to order any of the strains of Biryani as these guys are the connoisseurs of it. Our Chicken Biryani was perfect. The Chicken Bharta was also nice and spicy. It being a Punjabi dish obviously made its cooking style and therefore taste different. But Royal brought a Mughlai twist to it. 

Chakraborty Tip : The only thing not good with the experience is the cacophany of Burrabazaar just as you hit the streets after a meal :( But anyways, go there. Take it from a guy who lives in South Kolkata and put up through a lot to reach the damn place.  :)

If Arsalan is the Akbar of Biryanis, royal can be regarded as the Babur, one of the forerunners in this area in Kolkata. Located in Bara Bazaar, the setting of the restaurant is a scene out of old-world Calcutta - Calcutta, mind you, not Kolkata. That makes all the difference in my opinion.

I don't know if the practice is still alive, but one of the tales you'd hear about this place is the way the cooks would cook their tikias. The cooks would release the meat into huge 'kadhais' of hot oil, and then...wait for it...turn them with their bare hands to cook them overall, an ability born from years of cooking in the kitchen. I just wish I had the means to verify this urban legend.

Expect to be surprised by the Biryani in this place - solely because of the lack of the potato in it. However, if you think that this means a reciprocal increase in quantity, you'll be mistaken. Portions are not grand, but the taste of the Biryani more than makes up for it. The Biryani is spiced, offering a new dimension to the genre of Kolkata Biryani that is so famous among the citizens of the City of Joy. 

And to go with it - The Royal Chaanp. And I'm not even sure if that's the actual name or an adjective (which it definitely deserves). Best Chaanp I've ever eaten, period. Even Arsalan cannot compare. The Pasinda is very tasty as well, but the chaanp is what leaves me with fond memories. The Nargisi Kofta is another recommendation - oh, and their Rotis (both Tandoori and Roomali) are quite decent.

I'm not going to comment on the rest of the food simply because I haven't tried much else and the above is what makes Royal famous anyway. I'm going to finish with the Firni, which is awesome and just the right consistency and taste. 

Go to Royal for the Biryani and Chaanp and a slice of Calcutta. Just be sure not to gorge on too much food - one thing I remember courtesy of my childhood visits is that the stairs in that place are killer. Beware, because Humayun probably took a tumble down one of those kinds of stairs and kicked the bucket after a good meal and a lazy read at the library. Don't go the same way!

Well, royal used to be a much liked joint for me during my college days..known for its pocket freindly rotis kababs and mutton curries and biryanis.
Sad to state that quality has gone down steeply during past couple of years.Had visited the lower section of this place on 4/7/2013 after 5 long years witha freind and gave an assorted order from the menu.
The biryani has more turmeric than saffron and it's your luck if you get a good piece of meat!
The roomali rotis served were cold and despite repeated requests a got a lukewarm roti finally.The tikia was ordinary,and the mutton keema seemed like a two big teaspoons of meat placed in a plate of oil.The chicken liver was rubbery and was bland.
The only saving grace was excellent reshmi kababs and the mutton seek kababs
and as per my freinds account the chicken tandoori was ok.
Service was prompt and the ambience was in sync with the bustling bara bazar.But there were  big cats straying down your feet while i was eating which was not a good expereince at all.Overall a  relatively cheap place to have kabas and tandoori and not to try anything else.

p.s- Padma cabin at amherst street offers better biryani at much lower costs and even zeeshan at college street(besides putiram) serves better food in close by areas.

Sorry royal, you are not the same place which i knew couple of years back.!

It's one of the bustling old restaurants, with high ceilings, in Kolkata that have retained 'family rooms' and the belief that oil makes food tastier. The latter reflects strongly in the biryani where quantity of rice and quality of meat I felt are compromised upon. However, on take away, the biryani was noticeably better. The last meal I had from here was with my family and it consisted of: Chicken Tikka Masala and Tandoori Roti. And it was completely brilliant. The chicken was soft and evenly cooked while the gravy was rich in Tikka flavour. My family had Chicken Chap, Mutton Chap and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala with Tandoori Roti and everybody licked their fingers off, clearly without complains. 

Parking can be a nuisance depending on the time of the day (rush hour or not) and it may take a while for the waiters to take note of new customers. 

Bottomline: Though not entirely, Royal does preserve some of its former glory.

Another of Kolkata's historic eat-out places, this restaurant literally takes you to the old-world Calcutta. Trams, chaotic bazaars, crowded pavements, and this two-storied restaurant survives in midst of all that! It serves one of the best biryani available in the city - although, the quality has degraded over the years. Interestingly, the biryani served here is not the Kolkata style you would have expected, and rather prepares the traditional Lucknow style biryani without Kolkata's favorite "aalo". Definitely recommended for at least one visit out there.

Ok let me begin by saying that the biggest problem is finding the place itself...
Located in the Barabazar area rather on the Chitpur road on Rabindra Sarani a place famous cause it is a locality with the Nau Khuda Masjid, Union Chapel and a Mandir of a Rajasthani Goddess (I am sorry I forgot the name)..However it is closes to the Nau Khuda Masjid...
How to reach there (my preferred way since the other times have been through lanes and bylanes to reach the place half of which I cannot recognize anymore) is by getting down at M.G Road metro station and asking anybody how to reach either Nau khuda Masjid or Royal....Chances are they will know both the places and you will reach easiest...
Now the menu is small but there are some things that you must try. 
The ones from Mutton that you must try are:
1)Nargisi Kofta
2)Mutton Pasinda kabab
Both of the above are available on specific days so select the one available on that very day
Also give the Mutton Stew a try am not betting on it to be your favourite but chances are you will like it.
There might be something wrong with the menu given in the Zomato site because it shows a higher rate for the non A.C one than the A.C one am not so sure about that.
Now the specialities...
The reason you must go to Royal for are the Royal Biryani, The Royal Chap and the Firni.
Let me attack them one by one...
The biryani is AWE-FREAKING-SOME not that I have not had better but definitely goes down into the top few in Kolkata...The thing which goes wrong in this...The Biryani aaloo is missing...Yes I agree you will not get aloo outside Kolkata in Biryani but then this is Kolkata Biryani and must have aloo...Absolutely must...  Also the quantity is a bit on the lesser side compared to the few top names and you will want to have more but once you have it and order another you tend to feel even a Rumali Roti is too big to be handled...Thus maybe a little marginally more rice was expected. However they add some spices which makes it a bit different and I am not sure about this but a friend of mine whose family has been a regular since ages and who have this as their special hotspot tend to say that they are so regular that all waiters know her father and uncle an despite uncle having asked them they had not divulged the spices...They had supposedly said to uncle that it is something their wives make at home and something they will never share with the world.. Now that Hyderabadi Biryani has gone for a copyright maybe they can try it too if the story stands true since then it would show a strange sense of loyalty, expertise and commitment.
The Royal Mutton chap is awesome and sticks to its name and fame of being the best...Though Arsalan comes very close but I would still prefer Royal's. However it is very bony and the fact that Arsalan waiters care to check for giving fewer bones is the thing I feel is the reason Royal gives Arsalan a choice to even come close...Otherwise this would have been the best without a doubt and I still feel maybe they are that good.
The Firni here is the best Firni in town and it is a bit yellowish in colour and soft and tender and makes you want more and more....Give it a try....
Trying it Amitabh Bacchan style when he promotes Gujrat
Ekbaar toh khao Royal mein
However, since Ta'am came into the whole consideration (the restaurant beside Priya) stuff have changed and they have stiff competition since I believe now the Mutton Irani chaap at Ta'am is better than that at Royal and the Firni is equally good if not better. The only reason you can choose Royal over Ta'am is the lesser price otherwise everything else is so much better and the Biryani is also good...
I know of late I have been comparing most Mughlai restaurants to Ta'am but they really deserve it. I wish the owner(s) of Ta'am had given me some extra discount considering I am a student and such a huge fan plus promoter of their Restaurant.
Thus if I have given Ta'am a 4.5 it should be around the 4 mark on ratings but still give Royal a try....I am sure you will not be disappointed by Royal and though you may not feel Royal but you will definitely feel great

This is the place that is most heard about from my dad as well my uncles because back then there was no shiraz or arsalan. So, i decided to find out whether the place still holds that kind of reputation or not.
After having mutton biriyani, chaap and kababs...i was really disappointed because their reputation was really overrated. The food was definitely not upto the mark if you try to compare it with the leading biriyani baron in the city and price also seemed on the higher side according to the quantity as well as quantity.
So my advice is to you can give it a try.

Many places in Calcutta are said to serve good biriyani, but I prefer Royal primarily on account of the quality of the food and the slight differences from the other Mughlai restaurants of the city.

Royal is difficult to get to unless one is familiar with the one-way system on Rabindra Sarani (Lower Chitpur Road). The best way to get there is to come down Mahatma Gandhi Road, get off transport at the M. G. Road - Rabindra Sarani crossing and walk the two minutes it takes to reach the place. The upper floor is kept for casual diners - the ground floor serves daily customers, and sometimes it is nicer to sit downstairs in order to soak in a different kind of ambience.

The two items that are standard orders here are the biriyani and the chaap. The Chicken Chaap is actually preferable to the mutton version.  However, the cut of meat that lands on your plate is dependent on luck; sometimes, you get more bone, sometimes, more meat.

The biriyani, however, is very well made. It is best eaten in winter, when the quality of the meat is best. Royal is also unique in that it is one of the few restaurants that do not put potatoes in their biriyani. Most biriyani-eaters do not know that potatoes are not an integral part of biriyani - in fact, potatoes were added in order to save costs in the household of the exiled Nawab of Oudh, whose court pretty much introduced biriyani to Calcutta. There are other items that are also very good. The Nargisi Kofta is only sold on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but it is worth it - essentially, a Mughlai version of a Scotch Egg.

The service is quick, but the waiters could do with a little less brusqueness. The quality of the food is what draws me to this place, and I would like to go back again.

A Royal Disappointment !

LOCATION : Horrible to say the least. With no parking space in sight or any space whatsoever ! 

Used to come here when i was a teenager , But now the place seems to have undergone a sea change in the wrong direction !.Sat in those Curtained Booths Their Biriyani was as iconic as Ganguly , But those smells are now a distant memory. It was all there yet something was missing ! The quantity has suffered the most.Their Chicken Rezala was also lacking the ROYAL taste.The nan was upto the mark but can't help but notice that prices have increased significantly ! You can no longer call this place cheap. Surprisingly enough I enjoyed their Tanjoori chicken kebab the most !! 

AMBIANCE : Old world charm. Nostalgic to say the least ! Provided you are not a cleanliness freak , you won't mind too much. Service was prompt except for the kebab.

CONCLUSION : It's been there for ages but don't know if it will survive another generation! 
Not a bad experience but not a pleasant one either ! Doesn't leave a long lasting impression.

Had Royal's famous " Chap " and found it a bit overrated. 
The mutton is tender but there are a few rough edges in the cooking which is the last thing you expect from a restaurant that has built a reputation over many years. 
Olden day foodies frequent this place.
You should try the " Chap " only.

Royal is a class apart! Of all the reputed Calcutta restaurants, only Royal's biryani is without the customary potato. It's far spicier, more peppery than any of its counterparts. Earlier, of course, the mutton biryani also had miniscule keeema golis. Sadly, that is now a thing of the past.

The Mutton Chop (Chaanp) is again a totally different ball game from the tame ones Calcutta eateries serve up. Fiery, peppery and a whole lot spicier, it marks out the men from the boys!

There was a time when Royal was the durbar where all the biryani lovers of Calcutta would congregate to quench their biryani cravings sadly like many of the older places this one has lost its lusture ! The biryani and mutton chap of Royal was legend ! We craved it and would be eveready to sample it .... sadly the last two visits that I made out of nostalgia left me utterly dissapointed. The quantity and quality have both taken a dive as has the taste .... plus parking is simply not available. I actually decided to go in a taxi and do a takeaway when I last went but I felt the taste was not worth the effort and have not gone back since.

The Biryani is just not upto the mark. I would term it as just average. Recently I had gone there as I came to know of it through a newspaper. When we went there, the Mutton Chaanp was over by that time. So, we ordered Chicken Chaanp and it was also not worth it. The Service is good though.
PS: Do not order the Mutton Liver Curry.

Royal is immortalised in many of Satyajit Ray's works as one of the yesteryear's most loved places. However now they are only cashing in on their old glory.

The biriyani that was loved by many has been replaced by a dish that is too spicy and too greasy. The meat is also not quite satisfying. The helpings are dwindling day by day.

But if you still are hungry and are walking past this outlet, it's acceptable if you step in and order a naan with chaanp or biriyani. The air-conditioned section has a better ambience, although it still is nothing great. But what really disappoints is the fact that in spite of an upward price curve, the service and food are going down continuously without showing any hope of redemption.

Verdict: If you want to relive your old days, fine, have a go. But strictly for old times' sake.. For the price you're paying here, you deserve much better service and food.

I chose to have a late lunch at Royal on a day i decided to have an affair with an older Kolkata....after a languid stroll through park street cemetery and then through larger part of the Dalhousie area took a tram to Burrabazar in search of the renowned biriyani and chanp!!! the tramride itself felt like going back in time...winding through crowded street and fighting for every turn it has to take, it took me to my destination. Went to the upstairs restaurant and sat at one of those isolated cabin for "Family". without so much as a glance at the menu i ordered my fare. And it arrived.
A lot is being said about the drop in quality and rise in price. but on that day nothing could have made me feel quite as nostalgic as that plate of biriyani and chanp!! true the quantity was small, biriyani on the bland side (Considering the same at Arsalan), the meat portion abysmal. but the taste i felt have remained grossly the same. the moment i tasted it it transported me back to my college days, friends shouting and fighting for the last rice grain and shred of meat!!!
I know this is not a place fit for my nostalgic babble, but my point is, sometimes a place like this, degrading, decaying perhaps, with not a zilch of an ambiance, is a true reminder of what good food is all about. Good memories.

I don't understand as to what is wrong with these restaurants that once used to serve lip smacking biriyani has now degraded their quantity to a highly non appreciable level
royal used to be my favourite place for having biriyani not only because they served delicious biriyani and chap but also because it was cheaper than others!
the second last time when i visited this place i noticed that they had decreased the quantity and increased their prices, but after tasting that delicious biriyani i chose to forget about that little complaint
however the last time when i visited royal  a few days back i was more than disappointed.
they have increased the prices again,reduced the quantity highly and even quality wise it was a huge disappointment. i did'nt feel like i was having biriyani.. it was'nt as aromatic as it used to be previously. 
so i take all my words back from my previous review as royal is no more that place as it used to be.



----- 05 Jul, 2012 -----

all the biriyani lovers of the city this is the place you all should visit!! they serve biriyani which is not at all oily.. its moderately light and it tastes scrumptious!! try the mutton biriyani with chicken chap and you will have to come back again!

there has been nice memories wid royal in terms of fud...and i used to consider this restaurant as the best for biriyani and chaaps...bt few days bck one of my frnd has visited this place and told me that they hav detoriated their fud..so this diwali i along wid my frends visied this place jst to taste their biriyani and i must say it was really very dissapointing ..the quality hav detoriated by a big margin... the only positive point is the mutton of the biriyani which was well cooked bt in chickn biriyani there was only a leg piece wid minimum amt of meat... overall i was vry dissapointed.

After hearing so much about this place for the last ten years or so I must say that it was a huge let-down to me.
There is almost nothing good & everything bad about the place.Starting with the location..it is tucked away in an obscure alley in Central Kolkata and is pretty hard to find.Then to go to the air-conditioned restaurant, you have to climb a steep flight of stairs which can be very cumbersome for the elderly or ladies.
The ambiance is anything but good with the restaurant being able to accommodate only a few and the seating arrangement modest at best.
I now come to the food because if that was good then I could have neglected the other problems I mentioned, but good Lord! I have eaten biriyani in most of the places in Kolkata but this one was really bad. It is not at all tasty..no spice..no oil..no nothing for that matter!..Its totally bland and if you are above 60 years old and have a digestion problem then only can you like this! The Royal Chaap was another thing I was looking forward to & all I got was a Boney piece served with Dalda!..& the salt added was way too much too..The Rumali Rotis were cold and as with everything associated with the place..not upto the mark..
The service is okay though they messed up things & gave me Chicken Biriyani instead of Mutton which again i got to notice much later thanks to the miniscule piece i had got!..
& finally the price..For all this crappy food I had to fork out 250+!..Goes without saying that its overpriced..considering how bad it is!..
To all my fellow foodies..stick to Shiraz and Arsalan guys..they are way way better!..

It's been quite sometime I have been to this restaurant. But the memories still linger in my mind of the wonderful it served. The Mutton and chicken chaps were just heavenly. The Biriyani was also very good (though not as good a Arsalan). The ambiance is definitely a minus for this place.. Definitely not a place for fine dining experience...but good food - no second thoughts on that. Service is fair. The restaurant is not very costly. Must try for all at least for the Chap.

THE ROYAL....the name itself brings the taste of royalty in your food..........Though this hotel was considered for serving the best biryani in the past years, the quality has degraded. But you must try out Roomalli roti and chap to retain your taste....

Personally, this is not a visit in my list of must have biriyanis in the city. But, what the reason I end up having the Biriyani is because of their chaanp. The muttoh chaanp, as once descirbed by my dad, is 'no better that anyone else' in the city. The statement is quite true.

The place might be located in a not so good area - in terms of traffic movement and et all. However, the food transgresses all those factors. Go today! Have the mutton chaanp. Forget the world. Bliss.

The place where it is situated and the ambience in the non A.C. one is a bit down market.They have A.c. room also for family that is ok. But who cares. According to me they have the best Chicken/Mutton Biriyani in the city. Its the only place i know which doesnt give boiled potato with the biriyani. And also the best chicken/mutton chaap. mutton tikia, motton pasinda,tandoori chicken, kebabs. If you are a food lover and not so calorie consious and of course a nonvegitarian then this place is heaven

once a very good place for biriyani and chanp is now in utter decay. the stuffs are not trained at all. and they seem to behave rather rudely. not a place for any fancy dining. though their biriyani was ok but their special chanp was rather horrible. the kebabs were not also very good. the location too is very nasty for a good restaurant. overall not a must visit place anymore.

If some one is willing to take on the hustle and bustle of Chitpur, and the scarecity of parking space, this place is the most authentic place to have awadhi cuisine. Unlike Kolkata style biryani, ROYAL biryani does not have the Potato. It is extremly light in spices, but having all the aroma's of the Biryani. The Chicken tikka kabab in particular is a delight to mouth. It really melts in the mouth. The Mutton chap is exquisitely marinated and so soft that at times it falls off the bone. All the dishes are very very resonably priced. However the biryani quantities are a little lesser by 30%as served by other hotels.

Best biriyani in Kolkata, no doubt...those who are fond of Arsalan, my advice to them to go to this place at least once... and I think they will change their mind... you can see every single piece of rice are free from others, not mixed... taste is delicious... though the location is quite odd to take family and girlfriend...as there is no place for parking...and very chaotic area... but if decision is taken to take Mughlai food you must go there in spite of everything... all foods are good and a plate of Firni is must after Biriyani.

The best Biriyani restaurant in Kolkata. Biriyani made in pure ghee. The location of the restaurant is very  bad..  Food quality and food service both are good. Ambiance in not good... You must try here Chicken Chap, Keema Curry are also delicious.

The roads leading to Royal will leave you disgruntled,and the ambience of the place will only further your disappointment but once you dig into the kebabs, chaps and the biriyanis,you will feel only pure bliss.It is not for the calorie conscious who shriek at the sight of oil in plate,but its yumm!The chap is a must try(the mutton more so than the chicken) ,followed by the biriyani.

mutton chaap and tandoori chicken are to die for.... biriyani tastes good too and tastes completely different unlike those served in normal mughlai restaurants..  location is good but no car parking space.. better to take parcel back home rather than sitting and eating cos of parking problems ..

Ambience is very bad in this restaurant but food is very good, biriyani made of pure ghee, not refined oil is wonderful though its not for calorie conscious people, mutton pieces in biriyani are really big and succulent,champs are good, keema curry is also very good, service is quick also..
