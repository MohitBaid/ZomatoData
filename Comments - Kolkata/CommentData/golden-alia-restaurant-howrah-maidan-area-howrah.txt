I just didn't like any thing here. Hated the ambience. The place looks so clumsy. Food is bad. It's just not up to the mark. Plus the food is not good compared to the price. You don't get most items in the menu even if you ask for it. They just have one menu for everyone. no one just seems to care. What a waste.
