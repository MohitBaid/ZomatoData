Ordered late at night for the first time from this joint . I ordered for paneer tikka meal.
Taste -2/5
Quantity - 1/5
Let's start with the taste. The paneer Tikka was improperly marinated and grilled and lacked flavour . Although the dal makhni was fine , it lacked salt and was no where close to the claim of best dal makhni by the restaurant . 
The quantity was a horror . We order food at night to fill ourselves. I was served rice and dal in a small container(250ml size ) . It isn't sufficient for one person . It's like half a meal . When you are charging 250 for something , kindly make sure you provide adequate quantity . Although your concept of satisfaction of midnight food craving is good , it doesn't go hand in hand with the food quality and quantity .
