Ordered in via Swiggy. Had steamed chicken momos. Size was small and there were 5 pieces in a plate.Taste was good but even though i specified not to put chillies they had put chillies in the momo.Hope they look into this in the future.

I'd say it's more of a take away corner than a proper dine in restaurant. The sitting arrangement is quite small else the food is good. Quality quantity and price are reasonable. One can find it hard to locate due to the location of this place.

This is a small eatery near Babu Bagan and has been around for quite some time now. They mainly serve the Bengali version of Chinese food and they do an okay job with it. Do not have great expectations while ordering food. It is popular amongst the locals mainly as a delivery joint. Prices are reasonable.

Not at all satisfied with the food. All the items were not up to the mark. After going through some of the reviews of some fellow foodies, decided to order but was left disappointed. Ordered Egg Chicken Fried Rice, Egg Chicken Rice Noodles & Chilli Garlic Bhetki. Both the rice and the Meifoon were overly done and it didn't tasted that good. Though it was full of egg and chicken. But the fish was the worst of the lot. It was hard and not fresh at all. The worst fish item i tasted till now.

I am totally frustrated with all items delivered from this resturant. On a special occasion I have ordered all the foods worth Rs 3002 and all the items were so spicy that every member of my family suffered to take & the total party messed up. All food items were spicy & tasteless. So I suggest all who want to order from this resturant think twice & definitely contact resturant prior to delivery.

I have ordered many times from this restaurant. The quantity of food is good. The non-veg combo of fried rice and chilli chicken is enough for a single person. I love their chilli chicken. It's so light, yet so tasty!

I went to the restaurant once. You may have a hard time finding the restaurant. Since the google map info was not right when I had visited. Not many come here to eat, most of the people call for home delivery. But it won't be a bad experience if you give a visit. Since the place is a bit away from the main road, the roads are very calm and peaceful.

As I have ordered many times from here, the owner knows me very well. At 31st December they were very busy and closed online orders. I called him and told the situation. After that he came to deliver the food himself!

Located at Maharaja Tagore Road of Dhakuria the joint is bit cramped up and located at the mezzanine floor of a house.  Food is just not that good. The momo did not appear to be fresh. No momo dip was given. Soup was also tasteless. Complained to the patrons about the dismal food quality however they had not any suitable reply. Really felt upset with the experience out there.

Located in the by lanes of dhakuria, this small place serves great food. I had ordered via swiggy. I ordered the chicken yakitori japanese kebab and chicken korean Hakka noodles. Both of these dishes are quite different from our conventional chinese delicacies. The yakitori kebabs served in small tooth picks with bell peppers are quite innovative. In terms of taste they are delicious with a tinge of lingering smokey feeling. Quantity is more than enough. The japanese kebab comes with 10 pieces. Noodles is enough for 2. Overall excellent place. Recommended for people.

Hungry Hunter has been my go to, or rather call up place for some quality chinese food when I'm to lethargic to go out or cook myself. I've ordered from this quaint little restaurant in Dhakuria on numerous occasions. I particularly prefer their egg chicken friend, bbq chicken for starters (which is quite spicy), and chilli chicken, the quantity of which is quite impressive. These are basically the items i order every time. I also ordered Dry chilli paneer as a starter once, with the same fried rice and garlic bhetki and honey chicken as main course. Will have to try other things on their menu as well. Looking forward to some more quality home delivery.

Hungry hunter is a good place for cheap Chinese food. We've ordered from this place plenty of times. Typical "Bengali Chinese" joint that serves almost all combinations and all popular types of Chinese dishes. If you live near Dhakuria and are looking for a cheap and quick home delivery for a sudden Chinese craving, then hungry hunter can be one of the good options, but definitely not the only one.

2. The poor boy was shattered by the time he came after roaming around South Point School when I had clearly stated that the house was near St Lawrence School AND that was also mentioned in the delivery slip!
3. There was no change with the much harassed small delivery boy...

#Location: A small eatery near babu bagan pujo, at dhakuria

To satiate a dry chili chicken craving i picked up Zomato online ordering app and ordered from this place one late evening. Below are the highlights of my experience.
#Food cane before the expected time - This almost never happens.
#Delivery person arrived at my location without a billion calls and losing the way and showing annoyance- This also almost never happens.
#Delivery person was smiling - This also almost never happens.
#Food was still warm - i was truly happy.

As soon as the food(dry chili chicken) arrived I dug in. The chicken were juicy, the pieces were big, and the number of pieces were sufficient. The dish was slightly oily but tasted delicious. The flavours of the sauces and the chilies infused to give a prefect taste.

Warning: expect anglo chinese taste, not oriental.

However, in the recent ¬†times the food quality has deteriorated to a great extent that i only order from this place as a last resort.¬†The taste is below average and so is the size of the portions.

Konjee crispy chicken - a little too spicy too my liking, should be less salty
Dry chilly pork - good but would want bacon in it
Pan fried bhetki - it was nice
Chicken Pan fried momo - overall okay

The quality has deteriorated so drastically that we dont think about ordering from this place even if we've run out of all other options. 

The food is tasteless and while taking orders over the phone, the attendant doesn't even know what he's talking about. We've been misled on a couple of occasions as to the texture and taste of a particular dish and since then, have stopped ordering.

Verdict: Avoid strictly.

Omg! What a dreadful experience it was. I know I am wasting my time writing a review for a substandard and awful eatery. But my sole purpose is to prevent you from wasting your precious money in such a horrible restaurant. We ordered a bowl of a prawn sweet corn soup. The prawns had expired a long long way back (!) and so they were stinking a lot.  You have to be a Holmes to find any corn present in the soup. Even the froth  is poorer than any street joint. We had American Chopsuey along with a Pork and Lamb preparation. This is the worst Chopsuey I ever had at any place in the country. Both the Chicken and Prawn were rotten and of cheap quality. And the gravy was so tasteful that even a foodie like me could only have it only 4 spoons!!:( Both the pork and lamb were so tremendously undercooked that it would take a real test for your teeth.

If you love Chinese and wish to carry on, please Stay Away From This!!

1) I went at 1 pm and found the tables not properly arranged, not clean, even though it was supposed to be open for customers from 11 am.

2) When I asked for drinking water I was told that only mineral water is available and its chargeable.

3) I ordered a veg chilly garlic fried rice and chilly garlic pork. The fried rice was not at all tasty only the pork saved the day.

another new one spotted on zomato.. being pork-lovers, we had to rush for the pork. 
The physical existence -¬† you need to have patience to spot it and keep your hopes high once you do - the place is tiny, in a dead-end lane, but the taste makes up for everything. We ordered Katikora pork and a noodles, Korean most probably.
Amount of protein was less, but bang-on flavours, kudos to the guy who cooked. Beats any high-end restaurant anytime.
Following this amazing experience about a month ago, we visited again only to be disappointed with unavailability of pork :(
So, bottomline - if you have the will to persue for pork and the heart to bear the pain to find the place, and still not disappointed by the not-so-fancy setting and also the chance of unavailability, you will be tasting amazing dishes at very reasonable prices.

I was a bit reluctant on ordering from this joint as the price and location did not attract me. But let me tell you, when I tasted the food it was an awesome experience. The Red Pepper Chicken was amazing so was the Ginger Chicken. I found the food pretty good considering the price. Though I didn't try the pork but would like to try it once. Good job!

Probably one of the worst and overpriced food I've had in a while. Firstly, very inefficient and slow home delivery. And the food was unimpressive. Forget that, I might even say that it was not edible. The pork was only fat, almost no meat. The fried rice was a little undercooked. I could even overlook this. What is worst about the place is that they refuse to calculate the bill on phone and when the food arrives, it is much more expensive than the updated menu prices.

I ordered Pan Fried Chilli Bhetki Dry, Kati Kora Mixed Hakka Noodles, Egg Pork Hakka Noodles, Shredded Ginger Lamb and Chicken Lollipop for home delivery. After 45 minutes around ¬†9.30 pm. they informed me that they would not be able to deliver it to my place and asked me to pick it; they said that the food would be ready by 10.00 p.m, I had to wait 45 minutes more at their place and finally got the food. Had I known before their pathetic home delivery, I would have opted for other restaurants. Now, coming to food - the bhetki fish in Pan Fried Bhetki Dry was not so fresh and thus not so tasty; the shrimps in Kati Kora Mixed Hakka Noodles were next to rotten; the shredded Lambs were undone in Shredded Ginger Lame, ¬†Egg Pork Hakka Noodles was ok and the chicken lollipop was awesome, on the contrary.

U found this place through zomato only. I was amazed to see a combination of "air condition available" and such cheap food. 
It took us us some time to search the place and when finally we found the place i had an instinct that the quality of food will be great.
They have a sitting arrangement in the sort of mezzanine floor cause the ground floor is the kitchen. The behaviour of the staff was good and the food as expected was completely value for money. The quantity that they serve is huge, like one dish is good enough  for two and half people. The momos there is a speciality. 
The second time i went there i suddenly came across sizzlers which i missed the last time when i came here. I asked them do you actually serve sizzlers, the answer was " han dada oi sizzlers banai to amra"(yes sir we do serve sizzlers). But by the time the sizzlers are brought to the mezzanine floor the sizzle will go away..
Overall..its a nice place to order from when you have an army of friends to treat given the quantity and quality of food.

You will keep on hunting for this store once you have the dishes from here.
You wanna have Thai, Singaporean, Japanese dishes?? That too at a minimal price, I doubt if there are any other options better than this. And considering the fact of their mesmerizing quality and service, which is kinda heart of any restaurant, Hungry hunters is definitely one of the most underrated restaurants in Kolkata.

Food is good. I took a home delivery from Food Panda, which was free of charge and also they offered Two Soups free. Quality according to the cost is just perfect. Considering the low cost, don't misjudge the taste. It tastes really good. But ofcourse you can't compare it with big players out there as the cost is also too low according to them. We took, 2 plates of Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice and 1 Schezwan Chicken Noodles along with BBQ Fish, Schezwan Chicken and Devils Chicken and the total cost was around 600/- with the discounts plus two free Chicken Lemon Garlic Soup.

My Husband introduced me to this place. Its very near to our home, so we order in whenever we can. I seriously love their Thai dishes. Their Thai rice and Prawn-in-green-curry are absolutely yummylicious. Each dish has its own distinct taste. Their prices are affordable. The quantity of the dishes are also quite satisfactory. In short, after a long time, we found a perfect place where the food is worth every penny.

This has to be the ideal place if you are looking for excellent quality food in reasonable price. I know this place for more than 5 years now and I can guarantee that the kind of food Hungry Hunter provides will draw you again and again to this place. If you are in and around Dhakuria then they deliver food at your doorstep in no time and then you can indulge in one of the lip smacking Chinese food. The highlight is the price and the quality.

Quality & Quantity Food at much reasonable rates. One should try Pan Fried Momos they are jus awsum that i can bet i cannot find anywhere in Delhi. Have tried Salt n Pepper Chicken, Bar-be-que Chicken., Mixed Fried Rice an Garlic Chicken and they are just upto the taste.. I think the kitchen space should get covered properly just to give a better look to your guests from outside and Ambience of the restuarant needs to be improvised. We Delhians would definitely look forward to have such few joints or branches in Delhi. Pretty reasonable for delivering quality and tasty food. Keep improvising and happy selling & serving.

This is a highly underrated eatery. No idea why people have given such unimpressive reviews. But this is one of the shops I am living on, literally buying food more than 4-5 times a month. 

Service: Very sincere, courteous and honest service provided. You will always be greeted with a smile, be it on the phone or in person. Even if Gandhi Colony branch is closed and even if it is raining, my food got prepared and delivered from the Dhakuria branch because I said it was urgent. This is their dedication. Only sometimes bulk order takes a lot of time to get delivered. I rate it 4.5/5.

Food Quality and Quantity: You have over 300 items to choose from and all are available always, be it chicken, prawn, lamb, fish, mushroom or babycorn. Chinese is very well prepared but Thai is what I love the most from this shop. My favorites are Kati Kora Rice and Exotic Veg in Green Curry. Crispy Chilly Mushroom and Konjee Crispi Chicken are Chinese favorites. The overall food quality is very good. Quantity is standard. 2 plate rice and 2 side dishes are generally good for 3 people. I rate it 4/5.

Price: Standard. Worth it.

Ambience: It is mainly meant for Home Delivery or Take Away, so ambience is irrelevant.

Areas of Improvement:

1. There should be a little more chicken in the Chicken in Green/Red/Yellow Curry dishes.
2. There should be broccoli instead of cauliflower in Exotic Veg dishes.
3. If remains open for longer time at night, it will be more helpful for us.

Please Note: My review is for the Gandhi Colony branch.

It is the best place in our locality to get good quality food at a very reasonable price. I have tried many items from them since 2011 and liked almost all. And another thing I feel requires a mention is the friendly behaviour of its owner, which adds to the taste...

Well if your operating from a place called gandhi colony and its adjacent at a minimum price range of Rs 80( Momos on offer though) your catering to an area which still loves thrives and has every right to do so-The INDIAN style noodles with lots of soybean sauce at an affordable price range of 30 to 50 INR (Even i crave for them many a times)..but on the positive its close to like selling shoes where few people wear shoes...So the USP from my point of view should be flexibility because at some point of the day someone can even order a lamb dish when most will ask for an egg roll in your Chinese joint.....so far so good food quality has not been exceptional and don't worry even some so called 3 star Authentic Chinese restaurants on one of the happening place in Kolkata serves crap for a hefty price..Important thing is consistency and the small joint in Gandhi colony has been consistent....The best part is i can customize my preferences (spicy sometimes/Non spicy the other time).....But please ensure all your gravy items don't give the same taste again & again.....and please i expect Momo Availability at least all the time from a Chinese joint...

sudden craving for momos made us (my boyfriend and I) select this joint as he claimed that it is near his house, and sadly my favourite Thai Chi restaurant has closed down maybe. 
We decided to take away pan fried chicken momos and Crispy dry chilli chicken.
So these are the points that I have come across.

1. the momos were good enough to cool down my phagomania. They were crispy and had lots of chicken filling inside.
2. I didn't really find the dry chilli chicken decent enough to serve my guests. It is good enough to eat on your own. 
3. The joint is at such a place that you need a magnifying glass to find it. lol. or google maps.
4. a cramped place with the kitchen downstairs and a couple of seats upstairs for the seating area. nothing that will catch your attention.
5. packing is very bad and messy.

But I suggest that you give it a try for their fried and pan fried momos. They are good at them. :)

The worst dry chilli chicken and chilly pork I ever had ! Had to throw the food off ! On making a call back..they responded by saying dry chilli chicken come with a little gravy !!!!!! Also... the guy is rude and impolite. "We send our food to golpark also" seems to be there  regular response to prove there benchmark ! Thank you Hungry Hunter for ruining my evening dinner !! God..I am so irritated !!

HUNGRY HUNTER (Ranikuti, NSC Bose Road, Near Gandhi Colony School) - 

First things first, I must say that I'm more or less impressed with this new take-away, and I recommend it to all my foodie friends staying nearby. People go hunt this place out, it's worth it ! Do try the PAN FRIEND MOMO, which i clearly believe is their  specialty. The Konjee Crispy Chicken is also worth a shot. But I should also point out that, if the quality of the food is their strength, then the quantity is certainly not.
Hungry Hunter caresses your tongue, without caring much about your stomach. I hope they do something about it . 

All in all, It's great :)  
  
P.S - While studying branding, I chanced upon a phrase called 'brand promise', which basically is the statement that a brand makes to customers that identifies what they should expect from all interactions with the Brand. 
HUNGRY HUNTER, which has a rather meaningful and insightful tagline for a take-away, reading "Park Streeter swad, Panihatir damey" (Park Street's taste at Panihati's price) sticks to their brand promise to the tee, and delivers every time.

I have taken food from here in many occassions ..... There restraunt service is very bad... only because they just dont make any prepearational foods... So it takes more time to make the food ready to be served.... But there catering service is realy good.... This the best thai food we can offer to our 25-30 guests at moderate prices.... There quality was never in doubt. So if are going to this place make a prior notification to them so they can prepare for that..... and eberything else is realy good here......

basically a rubbish place with piss poor ambience and the price is toooooo high keeping in mind the :
1) ambience
2) Quality of food
3) quantity of food.

their tagline is  " parkstreet's food at Panihati's price"... Well... basically it should be the opposite.. " Panihati's food at Parkstreet's price"

They didnt even serve water !!!

A very Average experience !!

PRO's :

Very Cheap
Food quality at most average
Good enough for street food and take outs only.

CON's :

Ambience laughable !!
A portion of the ground floor is the restaurant hence a very cramped space.
Basically 2-3 dishes taste the same LOL !

FINAL VERDICT :

If you are looking for a classy place with some classy top notch food then this definitely isn't the place for you . I only recommend it to people who are from that locality and too lazy to go anywhere else. Safe bet are the Chili Garlic Noodles and the Mixed Fried Rice . Chicken preparations taste more or less the same !!. Kinda like the roll centers in dharamtala !

Kind of nice place for take away and home delivery...A huge array of menu compared to such small shops..Although many of the dishes taste the same... Crispy chicken,BBQ chicken,Noodles,garlic chicken are worth trying...although the chicken pieces arent succulent...wouldnt recommend pork & lamb over here...Overall for a takeaway its a good place and very cheap also...

Its a ok place for take-outs if you are in the locality.The place is not recommended for trying pork.The other dishes are not bad-you can try the bar-b-q chicken,crispy chicken,chili garlic noodles,crispy chicken,cantonese chicken.It is very Indo-chinese,the food is not ove-the-top delicious but tasty enough.pricing wise its pretty cheap.
