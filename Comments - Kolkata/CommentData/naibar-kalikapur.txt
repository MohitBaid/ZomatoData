The menu indeed looks really common, but the taste was surprisingly good. For starters, we had Lat Mei Kai. It has a crispy thin coating, but nice in taste. Since it's a new venture, we gave the benefit of doubt and asked them what would be their recommended sides with chicken fried rice. We settled for 1 sliced chicken with devil's sauce, and 1 sliced fish with schezwan sauce. The devil sauce was whitish (which was a bit against expectation), but the fish was great, both in quality and quantity.

The place is hardly 100 mts from my place, so I have my reasons to bet big on Naibar. There are not many good outlets in this region. Hoping the quality and quantity would be same when more people starts to frequent.

Food - 4/5 

Cost - 4/5

Service - 3/5 (cordial, but they need to know which dish is what more)
Location - 3/5 (maybe out-of-way for most people, but neither is it in a crowded place)

Bonus: prices in menu is what you pay (inclusive of tax)

P.S. - We were starving, so there's no pic of the dishes' quantity when they were served. Only halfway through did we remember to click a couple for Zomato.

The new baby in the block...it's your typical family cozy restaurant...though the bar is not yet open...it is strategically place in a seperate floor to keep the family crowd seperate...food is decent...however the menu has nothing you haven't..heard...or tasted before... But the food tastes exceptionally good...you will expect the same taste...but you will be delightful my suprised looking forward to the bar starting soon ...and hoping for a price friendly joint...
