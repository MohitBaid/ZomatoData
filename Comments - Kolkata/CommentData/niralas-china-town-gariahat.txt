‘Chinese food’ have in ‘China Town’ of Gariahat, Kolkata. When I am in KOLKATA and want to eat Chinese food, I headed towards ‘Nirala’s China Town’. When I am not in Kolkata, and want to eat Chinese food that time I really misses it.

‘Nirala’s China Town’ is in the heart of the beautiful city KOLKATA. Close to the market and mall, importantly close to many of the public places. This restaurant don’t have any other outlet in KOLKATA.

In this restaurant we find various ’Chinese, Thai and Tibetan’ cuisines. Here we can find multiple non-veg food items and few veg food items, all under one roof. ‘China Town’ delivers many flavors in the form of various cuisines of ’China, Thailand and Tibet’.

According to the name this restaurant ‘China Town’ gives Chinese feeling to its guest. 

Around 4 days ago I visited this place to have dinner with 4 other family members, we all are of same age group. We all ordered multiple starters, dishes and beverages. I can say that it was overall a good and nice experience. 

Their service was not bad, I mean it was good and fast (quick).

Staff of ‘China Town’ is very honest, friendly, courteous and energetic as well as care full.

I have to admit that each and every food item in starter as well as in main course was properly cooked and their quantity was good as well as sufficient. All of them are tasty and smells very nice. Also each and every beverage item was fresh and tasty. The texture and presentation of every food item including beverages are simply superb. I love their every food item, it’s too good

People, 

Ambience was good upto a certain extent. ‘Nirala’s China Town’ tries to give china feeling to its guest and they succeeded upto an extent, they have to do a lot of homework.

'Cost of Food' is not high at all.

Long list of various cuisines in its menu, makes it difficult to decide (because here every dish is yummy and tasty).

Go here only for good ‘Chinese food’, ‘great portions’ and ‘low price’. Don’t expect any new thing apart from that you will get disappointed.

I recommend this place to every person of KOLKATA to visit and have food here.

QUALITY OF FOOD: 3.5/5

HYGIENE: 4/5

SERVICE: 4/5

Just a horrible place.... Increased their price by 50rs per item post GST reduction to 5%. These people should be ashamed of themselves to do such things. They lost one of their oldest customers.... Such dirty scammers.

Been there several times .
Location : Just walk towards Basanti Devi college from Gariahat more , or walk few steps from gariahat Khadims . You will be able to locate this tiny yet popular place . 
Ambience and food : This is a good little place for having pocket friendly and good quality food. You can't see this place empty ever , as it's prime location and obviously they definitely make good food . 
If you want to eat healthy you can try their gravy noodles

The food was great in this restaurant...i used to come with my parents for the last 20 years but for the past 1 year its quality have really gone down and staff politeness has also decreased. For ex. I went there with my wife on panchami for lunch ..ordered fried rice with other items....the rice came uncooked .....upon telling them they didnot even care..went there again this week thought that the last experience was due to puja pressure. Told the staff that tge food last time was not good ...upon telling them they looked at me like " i dont care " face the food also was not good this time. Onions were old had a pungent smell...prawn too had a old smell .
I am not going to avail there service anymore

Momos were big and looked unappealing. 
Heaps and heaps of onions. It was more of the onion momo than chicken. But that wasnt the worst part. The worst part was that i was right. The momo was raw and dough-y. It was as unappealing as it looked. One of the sauces were stale.
 Sent the dish back. They gave uncooked raw momos again. So i basically paid 300 for 8pcs of dough-y onion momos

I have been here two times. This place is really pocket friendly and provides good quantity. We had tried crispy chilli babycorb, mixed fried rice, mixed chowmin (Hakka), Manchurian chicken, chilli garlic pork and Manchurian pork. 1 plate of chicken had 12 pieces which was very reasonable. Taste of the food was average, they can work better on that.

I have not visited this restaurant, so am not in a position to comment on its decor or ambience. My sister had once brought home a parcel of egg chowmein; it was deplorable in quality. It had a strange yellowish hue, and there was absolutely no taste whatsoever; even some of the roadside snack-bars rustle up tastier chowmein. The noodle used was of the thicker variety, which made it even more difficult for us to chew the bland stuff.

Located approximately 200m from Gariahat more, the restaurant has a sign board outside. In close proximity is the legendary hatari. Coming to the ambience, it's shabby, dark, sitting is not at its best. There was a special food menu for puja. We ordered crispy chicken for starters, chicken fried rice and sanghai chicken. Crispy chicken strips were quite long garnished with carrot julien, the carrots uswd were not upto the mark the crispy chicken was ok. I've tasted better. The fried rice wasgood though, portions were large. Sauces provided were soya sauce, vinegar, vinegar had almost finished, chili and tomato sauces. There were a lot of chicken chunks of good size. However, garnishing with spring onion was done on one bowl of rice. The sanghai chicken had 10 pieces, which is same for all other chicken side dish and also price is same for other items on the menu of chicken side. It had a certain smell which i didn't like, somewaht a bamboo shoot smell. Pieces were good though. However, for the price of chicken dishes, ₹330, it can be better and also presentation needs to be improved. Our total was ₹1368. The price to quality can be improved. Overall a bit above average experience.

Old restaurant at gariahut... To find this place is a bit difficult... A small entrance  allowed you to enter the restaurant at the first floor... Medium kind of ambience full of people coming for marketing... Red based theme... Waiters are well behaved... 

     We ordered crispy chilli garlic baby corn, chilli fish,mixed fried rice and sweet fresh lime soda... 
  Fresh lime soda was avg, crispy chilli garlic baby corn was tasty and was huge in amount can easily serve three persons.... Chilli fish containing 10  large vetki fish pieces which were very tasty -these can be served to 3 Peoples. Mix fried rice is also huge in amount can be served to three people's.... 

It was a nice experience  all the whole

Went to Gariahat for last minute shopping as I have completed it earlier just to avoid the crowd everywhere. It's a difficult task to find out this restaurant in pre puja crowd.  The best way to find this place is to ask shopkeepers.  They will point out whether you should go right or left coz if you don't know each and every place (like me) in that area, it's gonna be tough to find it out in crowd.
We found a board named 'Nirala's China Town'  hanging among shopping staffs of roadside shops and following it went to first floor. 
Ordered crispy baby corn,mixed fried rice, chilli fish, lime soda. Service was good and prompt. Crispy baby corn were different in taste but good. Fried rice and chilli fish tasted very average. I found nothing special. But the quantity was huge.  It was not at all for 2. We had to pack the rest because the items we couldn't finish were huge in quantity.  Price is really cheap taking quantity into consideration. But as I have already said that taste was dull.

At the time of placing order we specifically told them to give non spicy pakaros for 3 yrs kid. But I think they r not familiar with the word non spicy. Pakora was so spicy nt full of chilli's. Them the egg prawn gravy chow. Gravy chow was full of soya sauce nt chilli sauce. Fried rice ....they Served salted fried rice . Fish Manchurian was pathetic. I called them asked is it fish Manchurian or macher jhol? Many times I went before Bt today will be the last time I will never try this food chain.

Nirala's china town is an old place which is a favourite amongst the shoppers of gariahat. Having going by the reviews of zomato regarding their bulky quantity of food, my friends & I decided to visit this place for a sunday lunch. This is situated near bangabashi college opposite of gariahat auto stand. The restaurant is at 1st floor which is fully air conditioned. The sitting space is good in number which can accommodate greater amount of crowd during rush hours.

The ambience is like of typical tangra chinese restaurants with dimly lit lights having big comfortable sofas to relax yourself. The smell of the chinese food just flows from the kitchen which would salivate you more. Soon after given the menu,we ordered the following:-

1. Crispy chilli garlic chicken - Strips of crispy chicken marinated in biscuit crumbs and garlic paste shallow fried in chillies. The quantity was indeed good which were shared by 4 people with 1 dish. The cooking of the dish was spot on. The taste of garlic just mesmerised our tastebuds. The kick of chillies gave the perfect balance of flavours in the dish. Recommended!!

2. Chicken friedrice - Normal chicken friedrice served in a huge bowl. The quantity was stupendous and could easily be shared by 2 heavy eaters. The taste was average and was lukewarm when it was served which kind of ruined the experience.

3. Singapore mixed chowmein - Again a huge bowlful of singaporean noodles were served exlcuding pork. The taste was good with generous amounts of non veg bits. However the prawns had no taste whatsoever.

4. Garlic chicken - We took half plate of it which had 10pcs. The chicken pieces were big & had pure chunks of chicken unlike other places. The gravy was so-so and was too thick maybe due to excessive cornflour. The hint of garlic was also scarce.

5. Chilli pork dry - This was a major disappointment in our main course. The dish had generous amounts of pork meat minus the fat. The dish was literally cold & had an odd smell in every bite. Also the pork could have been more crisper to our liking. A big let down in terms of taste.

6. Lime water
7. Cold drinks

The place is fairly priced in terms of the quantity provided but they should also improve on their food quality. The total bill came to around Rs 1500 for 4 people,they charge GST of 18% with no extra service charge. The service was also a let down as well. Nirala is a typical place where shoppers wanting to have food out of tiredness from shopping. There are better options available in the same area with better quality of food.

Located close to Gariahat junction,this place boasts of exquisite chinese and thai dishes..The place is a bit difficult to locate and also not very much noticeable amidst the hustle bustle of the hawkers..
Visited here with a group of friends during the pujas and had to wait for sometime before we could get our seats..
The interiors are dimly lit and resemble a Chinese atmosphere with colourful pictures of dragons hugging the walls and lamps placed on each table..
Coming to the food,this restaurant serves one of the best Chinese dishes in this locality i bet,at a fairly decent price.
One point to mention:people please do not order a plate of any dish for a single person..the quantity they serve is huge:we ordered 3 plates of mixed fried rice and some pork and chicken items I remember for 7 people..yes 7 people..Food quality is quite upto the mark and so is the variety of items..Their waiters need to be a bit faster, otherwise they are courteous enough to serve you as oer your needs.
On the whole,it is a must try for Chinese lovers.

This is an authentic Chinese restaurant which is located in Gariahat road. A very reasonable place for the youth. The place is a little shady and doesn't have enough space but the food is very famous for its huge quantity.
They serve 30 pieces of chili chicken in one plate which is a record in itself. 8 of us went for dinner. We ordered chicken fried rice and the quantity they serve is so huge that one can be shared by 3-4 people. So we ordered 3 plates of fried rice and one full plate of chili chicken and munchurian chicken. We had a total of 60 pieces of chicken which we shared among 8 people. I have never been to any restaurant which serves this much quantity of food. I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place and try their food. The food tastes good, the quantity and quality are its main attraction. The price is very reasonable. I would like to visit this restaurant soon. Highly recommended.

This place is no miser when it comes to quantity of food. One portion of mains and sides is enough for two hardcore eaters. The taste although could be improved upon, is good enough for the price.

The food is amazing ... The quality and quantity of food is greater comparing to the worth of 💰 money we are giving for it...The quantity is so much for  a ₹ 200 to ₹250 range of plate that two people can't finish the plate , which I thing is very mention worthy in this city where cost of everything is so inflating . The decor is mediocre and decent . But people can't enjoy a good sitting arrangement of they go with a big crowd , as more than 6 people cannot fit in a single table and there are no scoop to join the tables and enjoy a huge gathering.

I visited this restaurant last year,most probably during Durga Puja. It was a bad experience guys...I don't know about others....but I was so disappointed. I went in with my mom & we had an intension of dining out there. Ambience was like,as if I was sitting in a theatre..I mean it was so dark in there,that I was having problems in checking out the menu card properly. Now the food- Chicken Pan Fried momo was our 1st order and the last one too😏. Believe me, apart from the size of the momos, nothing was ok. I like "mirchi",but after tasting their momo sauce that day,I was literally crying😭.It was damn hot n spicy. The soup looked like dirty sea water and I guess they 4got to put salt in it. Now comes the price, I had 2 pay Rs220 for 6pcs of momos....I mean,I could have had a full plate of any non-veg main dish at other restaurants by paying less than that. We paid the bill and straight away walked out of the restaurant because seriously,this had made me loose my appetite. Price they charge,is not at all reasonable if the quality of food is such. Won't visit again....Sorry

Its entrance is small and often can be overlooked due to the crowd in that area but they serve really a very good quality food in reasonable prices.
The food tasted yum and the quantity of Meifoon was of more than 2 persons. Loved it.

Located just a few steps ahead of Basonti Devi College towards Gariahat,on the first floor this restraunt seems to be stuck in a time zone.
The menu has a wide variety of meat , crustaceans, pork and fish in it with available option for Half and Full portion.Half portion is good enough for two with full portion being sufficient enough for three.
Mixed Singapore rice and chicken with vegetables were my choiced selection. Mixed Singapore rice had eggs, chicken, prawn and pork.The order taker did inform before hand that the fried rice would have pork in it, and also about the main course dish which tasted of chicken veloutay with baby corn, button mush rooms, carrot cauliflower and onion.Over all food tasted just good and portion size was very good.
They charge only VAT on and above the menu rates.
Over all a decent experience.

Pocket Friendly comparing the quantity.
A perso with good appetite should surely try.
Service is friendly and attentive.

Earlier when i went there a year ago, i was really surprised by the quantity of food served, but after a recent visit, they have increased the priced and reduced the quantity. But nevertheless, the quality hasn't changed. So totally worth the price.

i would would recomend to only those people who are shopping in gariahat market and then you just want to fill your empty stomach and relax somewhere but budget is low.
what to do- order china town special rice or any rice or noodles
what not to do- dont even try to order any curry or side dishes
pros-1) nice ambience is nice
2)well behaved and sober staff
3)can extend the small tables if there are larger no. of  people in a group .
cons- 1)food is not fresh specially chiken ,lamb or fish are kept for months and then it is made. 
    now you decide wether to go or not or what to order...

Tucked on the busy streets of Gariahat, it is slightly difficult to notice this little piece of Chinese heaven! A flight of stairs opens up into dimly lit dining area which resembles more or less an old fashioned restaurant. Their food, my friend, is mind bogglingly nice! I hadn't heard of this place but it came up on my "Zomato nearby places" so I thought of giving it a shot. If it's spicy Chinese food you're craving for, this little den is your best friend. Do try their chilli baby corn and dry chilli chicken!!!

Located at gariahat crossing is the hidden gem of a restaurant. The ambience is amazing and red. The service was ok.
Now for the food.
We tried almost everything.
Sea food rice: a must try dish at this place. Rice with prawns and other fish and chicken. Quantity was enough to fill 3 persons
American chopsuey: Not the best chopsuey I have tasted. Also the amount was lot less than expected. Overall it was ok
Sigapore meifon (mixed):this was probably the star of the show.This dish was freaking awesum. It was loaded with chicken and prawn. All the flavors were amzingly balanced. The amount was sufficient for 2 people
Red chili chicken: It was more like sweet and sour chicken. 20 pieces of chunky boneless chicken. It is more than enough for 4 people.
Szewuan lamb:My god, this was the best lamb I tasted till date. The lamb was soft and succulent and perfectly cooked. All other places where I had tasted lamb it was overcooked and tough. But here the lamb just blew me away
Drums of heaven:  8 pieces of chicken cooked with honey and sesame seeds. Nice starter
Hot garlic pork: well cooked and good to eat.

This is one of those restaurants for me where I've been a number of times but never really got around to review it. As they say, better late than never. This is a very comfortable restaurant so to speak. Dim lights, curious staff, good food that offer quite variety- it's all there. When you talk about quantity of food served, this place is one of the best. That is why this place is so famous with school students. Food quality is also very good. I'm a bit disappointed as they removed the desert section from their menu . Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce was something that I enjoyed. If you have not been here you should change that fast. You will like it.

Yesterday, I and some of my friends were stuck in traffic near triangular park for sometime and so we decided to walk on foot to a ballygunge and hitch a ride home. But after a tiresome day and being stuck in traffic for hours we were hungry, and after a quick search through Zomato, we found this restaurant.

To our surprise it was empty and we made our selves comfortable.

The decor looked dated with bench type sofas and tables, and an old, probably broken, television hanging in the wall.

The waiter's were very friendly and helpful. We decided to have -

Thai noodles

Chilly garlic noodles

Red Chilly Chicken

The Thai and Chilly garlic noodles looked and tasted the same except the Thai had triple amount of chilly than the Chilly garlic noodles.

The Red Chilly Chicken was nothing but a red thick paste of cornflour with chicken.

PROS

The portions are huge. A single full main or side dish is good enough for 2 adults and a child.

CONS

Don't expect anything taste wise, if tell them to make anything spicy they will add a bunch of chillies to it and serve it. The chicken ball's in the Red Chilly Chicken were very hard, dry and bland.

This is one of those restaurants which I passed by almost everyday but never really cared to enter. However, we were exceptionally hungry and tired this one evening and this was the one closest to our location. 
We were definitely skeptical about this place as we entered.
The ambience was pretty. Dimly lit with the hanging Chinese lanterns. There was no music playing, which was a relief as I am not a big fan of the idea. The place has nice comfortable couches, which I really liked. The menu seemed to be comparatively expensive. We ordered for a plate of plain meifoon, and half a plate of chicken with button mushrooms and baby corn.
On arrival of the dishes, the quantity definitely surprised us. A plate of meifoon was more than enough for two hungry individuals and half a plate of chicken seemed to take forever to finish.
Coming to the quality and taste. It was definitely a delight! The meifoon was light and non-greasy. The chicken tasted delicious. No unnecessary spices or sauce. Just the way I like it.
The total expense was something around Rs. 580
The staff were friendly and even came all the way downstairs to return the hairpin that I carelessly left on the table.
Overall, a good experience.
Would recommend this place to friends.

Ambiance is dimly lit and relaxing. Though on main road the roads are so crowded that this place may get unnoticed. There service was good and complete value of money. Portions are so big that two of us shared half the plate of side dish .

This is one of those restaurants where you enter without high expectations but leave being delighted with the food. I chanced upon this Chinese restaurant years ago and I must say it serves delicious food. I have tried quite a few items from the menu here. I have never complained about any dish here. The food is served in heaps of quantities and is great for sharing. I like the dimly lit atmosphere and the sofas. The price has risen considerably in the past few years. Earlier you could have had a full meal within 500rs from here. To sum it up,must visit place for Chinese food lovers.

I have been to this place a couple of times. Never noticed its called niralas china town. While writing reviews for zomato , found this out . During my last visit I have always enjoyed their food. So whenever went for footpath shopping shopping at gariahat. ,always dropped into this place. But this time my experience here is not good. I went there with my mom. I ordered quarter portion of chicken mushroom soup n veg gravy noodles. I mentioned the waiter not to add msg ie. Ajinomoto. Waiter said ok. Soup was good but salt was less. We like it. Then gravy noodles was served. It was absolutely without salt. I told the waiter about it. He gave a salt bottle. We keep on adding more n more salt but didn't get that taste.
They should be more careful while cooking. Common no msg doesn't mean no salt .

Such decent food, in such quantities and in such price range. I got amazed by these three attributes, the quarter soup they offer is way too much for even two people. And their crispy chilli garlic pork is a must try. A decent restaurant in a busy area like gariahat should have been busier. However one should visit this place just to try out. :)

I visited this place on a friend's recommendation. Honestly, I didn't know about the place and was a bit skeptical initially. But I am pleased to say that I am more than satisfied. Let's break down the rating-

1. Ambiance- It feels like one has walked into an old Bruce Lee movie with the red walls and staircases, red paper lanterns, dragon wallpapers. The place is comfortable and spacious. There is a good smell of Chinese food inside the place. It is clean as well

2. Food- The main talking point. I loved the Meifoon, the texture was perfect. The Thai chicken was better than what I have tasted in most places. Sufficient serving for two people in one plate. And yes, do try the dry chilli chicken

3. Price- It is fairly priced considering the quantity and quality of food. It costs around 500 for two people

4. Service- Service is quick. The staff are well behaved

This is the place where one should go to have his fill of good Chinese food without burning a hole in the pocket. The quantity is ample. A single plate of noodles cannot be finished by one person, no matter how big his apetite is. We took the Chilli Garlic noodles and the Veg Gravy noodles. The former was too spicy but both tasted really good. The ambience is alright too.

Portions are like huuuuuge. I guess there is no other restaurant in Kolkata that serves this kind of portion. My sister and I were unable to complete a full plate of rice coupled with a pork side. We had to eventually pack. I have visited this place, quite a few times. Staffs are quite well mannered. Some dishes, need a rejuvenation, for sure. For instance, today I ordered, schezwan pork. The taste was pretty bland. It was more of a tomatoey affair and it was not at all hot(chilli) and it was swimming in a deep pool of gravy.

They set temperature the best way possible. 
Talking about the food, I ordered crispy chicken, crispy chilli garlic chicken and chicken mushroom soup for starters. The soup was divine. Crispy chilli garlic chicken is better than crispy chicken. For main course ordered mixed fried rice and chilli fish. Mixed fried rice was fine. But chilli fish was a bit smelly. Seems d fish was not marinated properly.
Once I ordered fried chicken momo N it's heavenly.they serve momo along with soup.
I recommend this to my friends

This used to be a very popular Chinese Restaurant during our childhood, mainly during Puja Shoppings in Gariahaat area.

This review of mine is based out of Take Away order.

They have maintained their USP of more quantity but it seems quality has deteriorated over the years but again given its rate I still believe its moneys worth

Chilli Fish (Dry) - Dry pieces of fish and tastes good.
Boneless Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken - Small pieces of chicken and this is also dry.
Chicken Steamed Chilli Garlic Noodles - Bit too oily and ok types.
Chicken Sanghai Fried Rice - This is ok and better than the noodles.
Chicken Korian Fried Rice - Served with omlette on top of the rice.
Szechwan Prawns - Nice prawn preparation.
Thai Hot Garlic Prawns - This is also a good prawn preparation.
Chicken with Veg - Very light preparation of Chicken

If you are a couple planning to come here and eat, and u are not a big time foodie, or even u are never ever order China Town Special Fried Rice. The amount is huge! Not just the Rice amount of Chicken, Egg, Prawns, Pork(If u r eating) in equal quantity with rice. Any ways this is a small 30-35 seater Restaurant near basanti Devi College at Gariahaat. located On the first floor after a small ground floor door hidden among many hawkers sitting nearby. Dim lights, Chinese Decor, Tables with Sofas on both side. They have an extra room for festive seasons to accommodate more people. Food quality not very good but not bad either. A half plate of any food from here is like more than full plate from others. Try Fried Rice, Crispy Chicken, Drums of Heaven, Green Chilli Chicken, Thai Chicken. All are equally good. When there is budget constraint and U have many to feed for treat or other reason just close ur eyes and choose this place. U will come out smiling and if lucky (High Chance) then with a box of left overs packed. :)

Most of the time I visited here have tried their Mixed gravy chowmein special. The quantity is huge. We generally share it among four. Taste wise also good. 

If you want a budget place to fill your tummy in Gariahat area, try this.

A really good place to give treats to friends when you have budget constraints XD 
To be honest, 1 dish of main course is probably gonna be sufficient for 4 adults with average appetite. Soups could be easily had as 1/8 if taken as started. Half a plate of any side dish will a full plate of any dish will take 5-6 adults to complete! That's just too much food :P
The ample amount of food, good quality, and all for such reasonable prices makes this place a must try for all Chinese fanatics. But try to order dry side dishes. The gravy ones have overdose of cornflour in them ( a hope you people look into that ).

This was a place i often visited when i was a child. When we were unable to go to tangra we opted for this resto. Last day went their with my friends. I had the least idea that the resto degraded so badly. The staffs were neither gentle nor customer friendly. Very little or no change in the decoration- a quite darky room indeed. Nevertheless we placed our orders- chicken lolipop/drumsticks,chicken pakoda,chicken chowmeim,chicken fried rice,chili fish,chili chicken and schezwan chicken and two more dishes whose name i cant recall.

Chicken drumstick/lolipop- it was just okhay. Nothing extraodrinary. The chicken was overcooked. The quauntity was less too.

Chicken pakoda- the size of the pakodas are big. Here also the chicken was not soft it was rather stiff. To my surprise i found the quantity of the coating more then the size of the chicken. 

Chicken chowmein- it was better than the starters. There were bits of chicken. Taste was nice. It was going well with schezwan chicken.

Chicken fried rice- this was one item i indulged with a greater amount. It was good. The quantity and quality was good.

Chili chicken- nothing much to say about. It was nice

Schezwan chicken- they did it well. It should have been a bit more spicy. 

The resto is okhay. It amazed me becoz i had great dishes here but last days was not up to the mark. I hope it restores its previous quality.

I noticed the place long time ago and also heard about it from my relatives... I checked in for lunch and ordered Shanghai hakka noodles and chili paneer. The food was good and the quantity's enough for two people. The inteior decor is simple... a crampy narrow staircase leads to the restaurant.

I've learnt it from my aunt that it one of the oldest restaurants in Gariahat. After a shopping session near Gariahat, thought of giving this place a try.
We had ordered Chicken Gravy Chowmein. They served it within 20 minutes and one bowl was enough for two people. However, we found the food to be a bit oily. Talking bout the place, I dint like it either. And found the prices to be a bit high compared to the food they serve.

Ordered Singapore style fried rice and schezuan chicken...the quantities served were huge... More than enough for two people.. Half portion of chicken dish comprised of 10 pieces of chicken.. Ambience was also good.. Calm and peaceful..  So if you want to enjoy good Chinese in a calm ambience admist the busy gariahat market, you must visit this place...

Didn't know soup can be so tasty and momos can be so big that one won't be able to finish in one bite. First,we had prawn ball soup...it was very good in taste and quarter bowl of soup was enough for both of us. Tried meifoon with sweet and sour garlic chicken. Again they were good. Thinking of vising this place but only problem is one cannot come all alone to enjoy the food as they serve food in really large portions.

This review was overdue as I have visited this place multiple times and never even cared about the food prices as it tasted yummy. That was 2012...but this is 2016 and today is Probably the last time I will even think of visiting this place. The only caution I will give you dear users is that it has now become an overpriced date hole for school and college kids with ridiculously bad food.... If you crave food and not playing with your significant other 's fingers in the dim lights then this is Probably not the place for you

I was tempted to try out the food here on my Kolkata visit as its so near my home and I keep passing them everyday. You can miss this place easily as the entrance is located on the busy pavements of Gariahat road. Once you locate it, the restaurant is on the first floor. 
It was Thursday evening and it was not crowded. A mix of family and couples were there; enjoying their food. We sat down and was promptly offered the menu card by a helpful attender. They have sufficient items listed and we went for Sweet corn chicken soup (qtr.) for my son. Thinking that quarter would be small enough for him, but waiter suggested to split by two. Which was a good suggestion as 'qrt.' here = normal helping in most places. Wondering what a 'full' quantity would be! Same with the Chicken fried rice we ordered. One helping (which comes in a deep bowl) is sufficient for two with normal appetite. Also true with the Garlic paneer we ordered. 
Food was tasty, price was reasonable, service was prompt and courteous. All in all a good decision to dine at this place. Will recommend to folks searching for Chinese food in Gariahat area.

Firstly the ambience is nice. Location is great. 

Now to food we ordered soup,veg fried rice, schezuan chicken. The soup was really good the fried rice was good too but too oily i know resturant food is oily but it was way too much. The quantity was enough for three adults and the chicken was too sweet as that type is supposed to be spicey though we ordered medium. There was enough chicken and enjoyed the food too much. No ice cream was serve that was a dissapointment 😖 but i wanna go back there again for sure to try out the lamb and the pork.

This restaurant sits ensconced fronting the Gariahat branch of the Standard Chartered Bank. It could be a Herculean task to zoom it out amidst a forest of shops!
The restaurant is located on the first floor. The inside is no oil painting. It's has been organized and decorated quite clinically with large sofas placed opposing each other with large tables in between. With regards to the impression of this place or rather it's decor, I should say there is a predominance of redness and cosiness.
This place serves chiefly Chinese dishes. So you are welcome to expect all the fundamentals aside from there own twists in certain items. You can have Rices, Noodles, Momos, Chicken, Soups and the general Ice-creams. I haven't placed all the names, as it cannot be pulled off practicably.
My personal favourite, if that's helps or shepherds you anyhow or just simply gives you a reason for your visit there, is the Pan-Fried Momos. I adore them. They make it so tastily and it's so spicy. It comes with a bowl of Thai Clear Soup. Now I have to admit I am not really a big fan of soups, but yes I like theirs. Do try this dish once. Even if you don't wound up liking it as much, you may as well, not really mind the expenditure the ordering caused.
Next important thing that I must not miss from mentioning is the fact that the quantity of each plate is huge. These Momos that I just mentioned are such large bodied ones. So if you are ravenous, you will have a hell of a quantity for yourself. One dish will suffice two stomachs!
Overall it can be said that the cooking is good, the ambience is decent and the bill is sound. And yes, toilet, although too small, is averagely clean. The service is good, accommodating and expeditious.
The biggest problem with this restaurant like certain others at Gariahat, is that it has no lift. This decidedly makes it overwhelmingly a challenge, for the old members of the society to climb up. Also does perhaps the same to parents carrying toddlers or little ones.
Although the place can house quite a lot of customers, yet you have to be prepared to be asked to wait especially during peak hours of the day and more so during the festivities.
I like this place and have been here couple of times. It is really a good one for families to visit and will also be merciful towards your entire budget.

Out on a shopping spree and you are looking for good Chinese, Thai or Tibetan food, this restaurant will invite you peeping through the hustle and bustle of Gariahat. Climbing a few stairs when you enter, Chinese lanterns will welcome you. Dimly lit interiors, cordial staff, wide array of delicacies will come hand in hand with a little late delivery of food. Be it quantity or quality, you wouldn't get a chance to complain.
Come in with family or friends, this restaurant won't pinch your pocket.
Chinese Fish Fry. Drums of Heaven. Satay Chicken. Seafood Rice. Thai Hot Garlic Crab ... are simply irresistible!!

In the middle of Gariahat road among the shops, this place comes with a gastronomic relief. The grandeur of the place comes from the ambiance. I tried the chopsuey. The quality and quantity of food is good. Filling. 'Drums of Heaven' is so yummy- finger-licking good. As for the price it is very much affordable, even for students. Overall, its a must try out place.

Felt like eating Chinese in lunch around 2:30 PM today. Suddenly came across this not so impressive entrance of this joint. Interiors are mediocre. But service is prompt. Served chilled water with in 30 sec & Captain took orders within 2 min of my entrance. I ordered Mixed Noodles ALL IN & Thai Schezwan Pork. It took them 10 min to get the food on my table. But that's when my jaw cracked open. OMG! You got to take a look at the portion they serve. Noodles & Pork portions could feed 3 hungry pretty easily. Obviously, I couldn't finish either. The leftovers were packed & lying in front of me now! Taste was very good specially the pork was of good lineage. Recommendation: YES

Nirala's China Town is somewhere I have grown. Ever since six years of age when dance class was the major agenda and eating out was a desire , niralas was the only possibility that my mom could ever think of. Here I have learnt to eat Chinese, learnt to love chinese. It is an amazing affair. The dimly lit joint on the first floor , the amazing staff and the chinese with a slight touch of bengali is the essence of china town.
Well I have tried everything in the menu.
But my major favourites have to be the superb mixed gravy chowmein. It is stuffed with chicken , prawn and the gravy is rich giving Cantonese noodles a different level.
Here is the first time I had tasted crispy babycorn, and ever since then, my favourite starter at this place would definitely be crispy fried babycorn. 
Somehow I do not prefer the rice here as I feel its not much cooked. 
As for chicken dishes are concerned.  Garlic Chicken , dry chilli chicken and dragon chicken should not be missed.
The chilli fish dry is just heavenly. 
The restro charges decently, though I believe there has been an excess hike in price recently.
However this place will be visited due to sheer nostalgia.

Only thing that they need to concentrate upon is the consistency in taste. 

Nirala's is perfect for a quick chinese lunch or dinner with great varieties to choose from.
Just mind on ordering as the quantity served is huge and two people ordering one main course and a side dish can end up with a bit still left on plate.

Nirala's Chinatown has been an ever-present restaurant in the heart of gariahat since my mom's college days.. So we decided to try out this place, avail their home delivery service and experience the taste which she once had in the late 80s..
We ordered chicken hakka noodles, pork hakka noodles, Crispy golden Button mushroom, chilli garlic chicken gravy, and crispy lamb..
The home delivery was prompt and fast, the packing was also done nicely.
Now, coming to the food..
The mushrooms were good, mind it, only the mushrooms, and not the fry.. the fry was bad, the batter pathetic. We could have made a better batter at home ourselves. It was moderately tasty, but unhealthy..
The noodles were below average, the quality was equivalent to that of a roadside joint. Did not like it.. The pork noodles was better, mainly beacuse of the pork pieces..
The chilly lamb once again was pathetic.. Same as the mushrooms, but this time, the lamb was also poor.. The chilly garlic chicken was again average, a very flat gravy, and the chicken, by the smell, was stale..
It was an extremely disappointing dinner for us, and we vowed never to go back again..

This is a place that a foodie and a chinese food lover can never miss. A restaurant which is chota packet bada dhamaka, this is small in size but big in taste. Really good and tasty Chinese food. I just lover their interior also especially the lamp shades. Visit this place and have Drums of Heaven and with every bite you will pamper your taste buds more and feel more heavenly. China Town Special Noodles (both Hakka and Gravy) and Szechuan and Hong Kong Chicken are just awesome and are my personal favorites. Apart from this I would also recommend you to try Chicken Sweet and sour Soup and Steamed momos. More than sufficient quality with pocket friendly prices. But the cost of all these mouth watery cuisines is your patience, you have to stand in queue before u enter the China Town, and I believe all foodies can pay this cost to get the real taste of China.  :)

Read the reviews here... but i must admit... didnt quite fathom what everyone was saying as "huge quantity"... 

...ordered for a home delivery- A full chicken sweet corn soup, mixed spl noodles, chow chow rice, half garlic chicken, chicken momos.

First things first... the quantity WASN'T huge. IT WAS MASSSSSIVEEEE. At first we thought maybe he was handing over someone elses package. We realised that we had ordered extra... n had to carry ovee the dinner for the next lunch as well. I would rate it 10/5.

Soup was nice. Noodles, Rice n Garlic Chicken were awesome. Simply awesome. The momos wer large too and tasted nice. Food taste rating 5/5.

Delivery time... took them abt 50 mins. No complains. 4/5.

Packaging... Needs a bit of improvement. 4/5.

Cost... Total bill 1300. But considering that we had two full meals out of the portion... it was damn cheap. 4.5/5.

Value for money... 5/5. Without doubts.

Keep it up guys. Kudos.

Located right on the heart of Rash Behari Avenue, had heard a lot about this vintage restaurant and hence we decided to try this one out on Valentines Day but at the end of the day i was left disappointed. The interiors of the main eating hall were nicely decorated but since it was full we were asked to sit in a small interior room which was in a shabby state with some broken tables and chairs, damp walls and with the most unimpressive facade. Its basically for those who come for take home orders to sit and drink water till the parcel is ready but surely not worth a place for spending your valentine evening with your partner over a Chinese ala carta Have no complaints about the food--typically chinese and  rates were okay, but please ensure to wait if the main restaurant is full and do not go and sit in that small room inside on the insistence of the staff who will do so for their sale as the atmopshere in that small room would spoil your evening and dampen your spirit

For first two days, we got to eat a very decent quantity and quality of food whatever we ordered. Gravy egg garlic noodles were fine, but there were too many vegies. Dry chilly fish was quite large in quantity for two people. Next day we ordered green prawn and it was a disaster. Prawns were undercooked, very small in size and got melted and mixed up in gravy. It cost about ₹. 360 and three of us could eat only the prawn heads and thick green 'chutney' gravy. We took 3 platters but ended up paying ₹ 2000 (approx.) because of price hike in puja season. I'm visiting that place again if and only if they minimizes the cost.

Totally disappointed!
First of all you have to order minimum Rs. 800 to have a home delivery, whether you stay next door or in the neighbourhood. The guy who took order over phone politely told me that you must order one more dish as the total is coming to Rs 750.
As for the food, the special fried rice (Rs 270) is totally dry which is strewn with small pieces of very hard pork meat. The drums of heaven is sweet and sour but generously coloured with artificial red and that gives a cheap look. Strangely the cook gave a white bland taste to the 'chilly garlic pork' which should have been really spicy.
Nothing to say just that I made a wrong choice!

Have been to this restaurant for quite a few times. Have visited this last week. Am in love with the ambience of the place. Needless to say, China Town provides with a huge quantity of food. A single plate can amply satisfy 3 hungry souls. The waiters are courteous enough. And lastly coming to the quality of food. Food tastes awesome and highly satisfying. Price is quite reasonable as far as the quantity is concerned. Would love to visit it again soon.

I went there on last Sunday along with my friends after reading zomato review's. It is true that we provide huge quantity. However, I have a complain :( .We ordered crispy chilly chicken dry, nirala's China town special mixed friend rice, hong Kong chicken and chilly chicken gravy. Everything was okay but the prawn on the mixed fried rice was terrible. Apart from that it is a pocket friendly restaurant you can give a try.

"Massive Quantity" is what you will conclude after reading most reviews of this restaurant here. Nirala's Chinatown has got it's formula correct i.e- tasty food, more quantity, better service, less price equals happy customers.

The food is really good and they really know how to make Chinese cuisine. Noodles and Fried Rice were very good and they seemed of high quality right after smelling them. Pepper Chicken had great colour and taste. Crispy Golden Baby Corn was a bit less crispy but nice overall. Chilli Chicken was really very good and it seems that Nirala's do not believe in adding too much gravy but more chicken instead.

Quantity as said was massive, one plate or box of Hakka Noodles and Fried Rice is enough for four persons and the starters are also in very good quantity. Gravy items have 10 pieces in half and 20 pieces in full plate.

Can't call it a very budget friendly restaurant, but when it comes to price vs quantity, quantity really wins by good margin.

Service is quite good, our food is usually delivered within 1hr (distance of up to 4km). Packing could be better as it appears that packing is done in real hurry and sometimes boxes are smashed. However the best thing is that delivery time is very good, they call you several times if they are unable to understand your address.

So, overall a very good restaurant if you have a big and joint family or if you have guests at your home and you want to spend less, then this place is just perfect for you.

UPDATE: Recently went to the place. Ambiance is really disappointing, it's pitch dark inside. Seating is mainly on the first floor but it's not a great place for fine dine with family and friends, casual dining is okay though. Quantity served is still massive so no problems there.

Good Chinese food, huge quantity, pocket friendly bill! This is a must visit if you have to give treat to a huge group of friends :). We have visited there during the Puja, so there was a 45 minutes waiting, but it was worth the time and money. The decor is simple and cozy, the stuff was friendly. We have ordered mixed rice noodles, chicken fried rice, green chilli lamb and shanghai chicken. The lamb was nicely cooked and tasty. Rice noodles and chicken was also upto the mark. What amazed me was the quantity of main course and side dishes. The noodles and rice was sufficient for at least four , the side dishes had ten pieces. We were very hungry after a day of pandal hopping, so it served us good. Finally the bill made us so satisfied, we are planning to visit here as soon as possible.

My first visit was here during the Pujas for a lunch. So it was quite crowded. But we didnt have to wait much as we knew the management people. Though it was the pujas all the items came within 5-10 mins. Service was extremely fast. The ambiance was good. They mainly use sofas for their sitting. The food quality was very good.  The price was also very low compared to the quality of the food. Would love to go there soon. Must Visit,

It's a small eatery tucked away on the congested streets of Gariahat. Food here is absolutely awesome and value for money. The crispy chilli garlic chicken is awesome. Mixed chilli garlic noodles in gravy is to die for. The china town special rice and noodles are very good. The place has very simple and basic decor though, but to be fair, what it lacks in ambience, it totally makes up for it in terms of the food.

Well this is what we call 'true value for money'. I visited this restaurant on last sunday with a friend and we were too hungry. It was about 1500 hrs and all shops were almost closed, we were dying with hunger and suddenly we found this. Man ! we were confused where to enter ?.... they have written 'no entry' on one door and 'no smoking' on other two doors. well it would leave any first timer perplexed. after a while we ordered chow chow rice, egg fried, cost 180. well I must say the amount was good enough for two people and equally tasty. Good value for money as we liked both taste and quantity.

Was getting late for a world cup match and had to pick up food on the way. My friend who was with me recommended this place since we were near Gariahat.  I had no clue that such a delightful joint existed among the hustle and bustle of hawkers in Gariahat. The entrance is tough to spot, it's near to the Standard Chartered Bank and the Khadim's showroom on Rash Behari Avenue. 

We were literally in a hurry and rushed up to the first floor. The place was pretty dim with Chinese lanterns hung from the ceiling and other Chinese decorations. We called a waiter and asked him to deliver 2 (full) plates of chili chicken dry, a plate of chicken gravy noodles and half a plate of manchurian chicken. Requested the waiter to pack us the food as early as possible and he understood our concern thankfully with a broad smile on his place!

While waiting for the food I noticed that food served here is similar to most restaurants in china town. The menu has everything in either half  or full plate which is quite common there. The soups are served in a large bowl and you need to help yourself, again very common to some eateries in China Town. The quantity of food I noticed was quite huge. Our parcel arrived in fifteen minutes, we cleared the bill and were away! The bill came to 1280 inclusive of tax and container charges. The staff i thought were extremely nice. 

The chili chicken dry was top class - very authentic indeed. The chicken pieces were cut to perfection and there were no bones or fat or skins in the chicken. It tasted the way it should be two large plates comprised about 40 pieces of chicken! The noodles was good, nice large pieces of chicken cooked in soya sauce with generous pieces of mushroom capsicum made it extremely tasty. The manchurian was okay but nothing to complain really. 

The pricing I thought is very reasonable and what impressed me is that this is one of the few restaurants in South Calcutta where you could opt for half or full plate depending on the number of heads. I am looking forward to relaxed meal on my next visit as I was here for all of 15 minutes!

Location: Next to Khadims, a minute away from Gariahat Crossing.

This small little eatery is one of those hidden gems which serves good food at reasonable prices.
Visited it a couple of weeks back...
... The ambience is quite simple here, is a dimly lit place with a seating arrangements for around twenty-five heads. The Chinese lanterns were beautiful.

Coming straight to the food, had ordered a portion of Chilli Garlic Noodles & Chilli Paneer.
The Chilli Garlic Noodles was delicious with the perfect amount of spices.
The Paneer tasted good and wasn't chewy at all. Happy.
-Portions are quite generous.

The service was brisk and prices are quite reasonable.

Overall a good experience.
-Home delivery facilities available. Yet to give it a try.

My partner took me to this place couple of week's back. I was totally unaware though i am a regular Gariahat pedestrian ( more of a shopper). The place is typical Chinese theme with red paper lanterns and all. We visited on a weekday evening and it was quite empty when we settled down. Our order was Szechuan Meinfoon and Shanghai Pork. The quantity is good enough to feel three persons.Noodle was good. Spicy. Pork was under-cooked, so didn't enjoy it as much as we wanted.
Overall, nice experience.

Located in Rash Behari Avenue, near Gariahat Market.. Its a small food joint.. a taste gem hidden in chaotic shops of Gariahat Market.. Look out for the shop - Khadim's.. Its just beside it. Parking is no problem as you can park anywhere in the adjacent lane, or on main road if its sunday.

Don't let the Ambience disappoint you.. Its a simple decor with dim lights glooming from chinese lanterns, a bit cramped up.. 6 seater tables laid though-out the restaurant. The staff is friendly as well.

I have been here many times.. so have almost tried all the vegetarian snacks and main course dishes.. The taste is always the same.. irrespective of the times you visit it.. The portions of everything is very good.. rather Large.. be it soups, starters, main course veggies or the staple food - noodles or rice. Don't order too much at once.. or you will surely end up getting the leftovers packed like me.. ;)

Anything you order, consider it your customized order and own chef preparing it for you.. Just let them know - How would you like it.. dry, gravy, semi-gravy, medium or avg spicy, tangy, sweet and sour. It will the just be the way as you exactly want it to be.

Pocket Pinch - Rs. 250 to 300 per person.

Suggestion to the restaurant - 1. I will be glad if you also have a Bar in your restaurant. 
2. Consider a change in Interiors.. and play some Tibetan or Chinese music so that it enhances the over-all ambience.

Went Last Saturday evening with my spouse. As per recommendation in Zomato users ordered Prawn Foo Yang, Sanghai Mixed Fried Rice and Szechuan Fish. Now step by step review:

Location: It is perfect for Gariahat peoples, but a bit difficult to others. A small opening among the huge shops and pavement hawkers. You have to really find it. (Just opposite Stan chat bank, beside Khadim's)

Entrance: It's a bit shabby and quite. My wife has been taken a while to enter.

Ambiance:  Quite good. Dim lighting, simple decor, Chinese lanterns. Perfect for dining but space is less. 6 seaters all along.

Food:   Prawn Foo Yang is nothing but a simple omelet with little bit of prawn, sprinkle of tomatoes, here and there coriander leaves, nothing exceptional in taste. Price for this dish is on the higher side according to me.

Mixed fried rice tastes great as well as the fish preparations. Fish although a bit stiff according to preparation. But tastes good with the rice. Pisces are quite good with 10 large chunks. But as suggested by others not the extra-ordinary amounts that two can't finish off  

Staff: Well behaved and ok.

Price: It is on the higher side according to me. But not over-priced.

Overall it is a nice place nothing extra-ordinary. You can go and have a bite too !!!

During my college days, hanging out with friends was a daily affair. We were always on the lookout for suitable hang out joints and Nirala’s China Town was one of them. Located on Rash Behari Avenue, Kolkata, Nirala’s China Town is one place where you can get mouthwatering Chinese and Thai food at very reasonable prices.  The restaurant is clean and people love to enjoy their steaming hot food in its cosy ambience.  Though not many, but a number of diners can comfortably sit and enjoy their food here.

Whenever we headed to Nirala’s China Town, it was to taste the lipsmacking green chilli chicken preparation, which is served in generous quantity, good enough for ten hungry college students. Some egg fried rice always accompanied green chilli chicken and the two teamed up well.  Apart from green chilli chicken, you’ll also love their Thai hot garlic chicken, red chilli chicken and Szechuan chicken preparation. Fish lovers would love to try some manchurian prawn, red chilli prawn and shaghai prawn prepared tenderly with rare spices at Nirala's China Town. 

A wholesome three course meal can comprise of some chicken prawn Fuyong or chilli garlic baby corn as starters and appetizing chicken asparagus soup. Next you may try some steamed garlic noodles; Szechuan fried rice and green/red chilli chicken or any other preparation like lemon chicken or Thai hot garlic chicken.  Nirala’s China town is one of those budget restaurants that offer a whole lot of chicken and prawn preparations at reasonable prices. So, next time try eating out here.

Nirala's China Town is one of those smaller places that serve pretty good food. I have always done takeaways from here never sat and dined in so will not be in a position to comment on the service. Their spring rolls are nice and you can order them not just in the chicken option but in a pork , prawn or crab-meat options which make for a nice change.  Among the Soups Chicken Talu Mein or Chicken Hot & Sour are both nice. The Chicken Fuyong is also pretty nice and goes well with the Fried Rice which is what I usually like to have it with. The Mixed Meifoon is also good. Order either the Chilly Garlic Prawn or Chicken and it makes for a good meal. Costs are reasonable and helpings are good.

This is the 3rd time I'm visiting this restaurant, and I can assure food wise its a hidden gem. If you are going for shopping to Gariahat, you can surely visit this place, which is just few minutes walk. They serve Thai and Chinese. The preparation is delicious, special mention to Schezwan Fish. The rice items are also good. The quantity served is quite huge. For two, one each main dish and side dish is more than enough.
They can definitely improve on the decor and the surroundings.

It is at the prime location of Gariahat and if you want to have some really good Chinese then go for this one.
Ambiance was decent, they served well. Interior were cozy but spacious. The quantity was sufficient for 1 and a half persons per plate. Drums of heaven were disappointing as they were just chicken lollipops.

This China Town though not in China Town serves Chinese Thai fare which is at par with restaurants in China Town. Amazing Chinese starters,awesome pork chow,really cost effective owing to their huge portion sizes. The best thing though is their location. you can just hop in for a meal after an entire days shopping in gariahat. It's highly recommended for foodies who are shopaholics and throng about in that area :)

I visited the place after two years and the first thing that I noticed is it's ambiance which changed quiet a lot. The place used to be much more lighted but now its pretty dark. I did not find the ambiance great. Since we were only two people we did not order many items. We had Szechuan Veg Fried Rice and Prawn Chilli (Gravy). I could not help but notice that there has been a hike in their rates as compared to the menu rates I saw here (that's why I have reported about it to Zomato for update). I had gone there to have crab but it was not available so I ordered prawns. However I had crab the last time when I had visited the place and I had found it amazing. Coming back to what I ate today. Szechuan Rice was pretty decent and the amount served was too much for two of us to finish. I thoroughly enjoyed the Prawn Chilli. I would definitely recommend this to my friends. The serving was quick and the food was fresh and piping hot. Looking forward to my next visit.

I have been there just once, that too years ago; but the thing that I distinctly remember is the generous quantity of food served by them. It is impossible for one person, and even two people with normal appetite to finish off what they serve for just one plate. A bit difficult to locate in the crowded Gariahat area, and the decor is old-worldly, but the quality of the food is as good as the quantity! Definitely recommended for Chinese food lovers!

Good food served in extremely voluminous quantity. It is advisable to visit this restaurant with a group of three or more people. The reason why I am saying so is because food is served in voluminous quantity and may be too much for two persons to consume. 

I would like to make a special mention about the soup/s that are served here. They are just awesome. I would suggest that you have a taste of the soup should you happen to visit this restaurant.

Nirala's is a tiny joint tucked away near Gariahat crossing, towards the Rashbehari side. First-timers might have a bit of difficulty locating this place. I suggest looking for Khadim's in Gariahat and checking that side till you come to the joint.

Recently Nirala has raised prices quite a bit. When I was packing away some food, I realized that my previously never going over 400 bill was well over 500. I generally order the pork fried rice, half plate chicken with button mushrooms and egg fuyong/spicy spring chicken/chilli pork. They also make a great crispy chilli garlic pork as well which comes in huge quantities... and a pork with vegetables that is served with a bowl of steamed rice. 

However, the quantities are still the same, which makes Nirala's quite good as a place from where you take home food. When it comes to a dine-in, the service is brisk, if a little rude, but I don't mind that because the food is served fresh and piping hot. I love their mei foon too, and sometimes order it when I am in the mood.

GOOD, GENEROUS FOOD AT NIRALA'S!

In the Gariahat area, Nirala's China Town is considered to be one of the oldest Chinese food joints. Though it suffers from a space crunch, it does offer comfortable sitting arrangements. Furthermore, dim lighting adds to the old world charm of the restaurant.

 All the items mentioned in the menu card are available. The food service is quick and efficient. Fresh and hot food is served within ten to fifteen minutes. The food quantity of each plate is of generous amounts. One plate of any rice or noodle dish can satisfy two to three people. No matter how many times you dine there the food standard is pretty much the same. Though all the dishes are well prepared and scrumptious, each section has some food items that are more popular than the others. Among the varied soups on offer it is aromatic and flavorful Thai soup and Chicken Hot and Sour soup, which are crowd favorites. For the main course, both their fried rice and noodles (Hakka or gravy) were well cooked. You can have them made in the varied cooking styles that they specialize in. Among the chicken items we ordered their Hong Kong chicken, Chicken Drumsticks, Green Chilli Chicken and Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce - the crowd pullers. From their seafood section, I would prefer their prawn dishes than their fish ones. Some popular prawn dishes are Thai Hot Garlic Prawn, Chilli Garlic Prawn and Red Chilli Prawn and go well with all kinds of fried rice. They also serve several lamb, crab and pork dishes though we did not try any. They do churn out several mean pork dishes like Crispy Chilli Garlic Pork and Thai Hot Garlic Pork. 

This is a great place for good quality and generous quantity food at reasonable prices. So whenever you go shopping in the Gariahat area and are looking for a wholesome meal experience head straight to Nirala's.

Not that much good the charge is very high according to the food...at the same price we can get great food in res- like Tung fong,Beijing china town, if the price was bit low i could have rate it 4 but they are charging very high you can compare it ..

This is one of the best chinese restaurant in the city, little difficult to locate if one is not accustomed with gariahat area.. This joint is very old but retained the old charm. its not a spaceous restaurant but still not cramped ,dimly lit, so ambience is romantic. all the items written in menu card are available and service is very quick, they serve fresh hot food within 10-15 mins..The quality is very good and quantity is huge.. one plate of fried rice or noodles will be enough for 3 people and chicken ,prawn,fish dishes also served in huge proportions enough for 2-3 people..thus it becomes very cost effective and they dont take VAT also..

I have been to this place several times, their standard of food served remains consistent. The ambiance is nothing great, however the lighting adds  a chinese mood to this place. Nice seats and comfortable ones. Now coming to the food. They serve really nice food here. To start with i really like their Thai soup. A bowl full of flavour and yum. Then for the main course you can go for the fried rice or noodles, both are good. If you like pork order mixed rice/noodles. Their Hong kong chicken is good. Crispy chilli garlic pork is really nice. And you can choose almost anything from the menu and they will be up to the mark. However do keep in mind that their quantity of each plate is extraordinarily good. So dont end up ordering more than you can handle. One plate of noodle/rice is sufficient for three normal eaters, two heavy eaters. Plus the service is fairly quick! It is near gariahat crossing. Do drop in sometime :) Enjoy!

the ambiance is very chinese. the taste is good especially the chicken drumstick and chicken in hot garlic sauce. the one striking thing is the quantity that they serve. it's huge. 2 plate fried rice is enough for a family with two children. the price is also moderate. try their soup. the only problem is parking since its very near to gariahat more and thus finding a place to park your car is hard

nice ambience
satisfying quantity
nice quality! although i tried only few of their dishes among which the schezwan fish was not "schezwan" and it was kind of somewhat smelly and bitter! otherwise everything tasted pretty nice! the green chicken- well at first its look made me unsure about its taste! however it ws pretty good!
pretty reasonable when compared to the quantity
service- quick and erroneous!
ordered for mixed rice and they served us egg rice!
to top it off they made a bill in which they added two more extra dishes which was never ordered!
apart from these food was quite satisfying!

Many people will scorn at me if i say that that the food of this restaurant is better that the chinese food which we get in Tangra!
But it is. Its a secret hideout kinda place very cozy, fast service, huge quantities and budget pricing!I highly recommend the Chef Spcls and Drums of Heaven, its truly celestial!
the sitting is very comfortable and a welcome respite after a whole day shopping in the Gariahat area!

this  place is  worth a try  , i personally  reccomend their  GREEN CHILLI CHICKEN  , hot & sour soup  ,  thai  hot  garlic  prawn  , chili garlic prawn  &  red  chilli prawn  to be had with prawn  fried  rice ...ambience  is  cozy  &  the QUANTITY  is good........ a little pricey  considering  the locality  but that is pardonable  if  you   go in a group  .  one  let down for  me  is  the toilet which is not upto  the mark  ( gent's  toilet ) i donno  about the  ladies'  toilet so cannot comment .  & oh  yes  the  dessert  was  a let down  for me ,  but apart from these two flaws ,  this place is  NOT BAD  for people  in  gariahat locality  .  Worth 1  visit

A very nice and cozy ambiance topped with the wonderful behaviour of the waiters, this restaurant is worth a try. Giving you the feel of tangra, this eatery is quite nice when you are looking for a nice and warm evening with your loved one. The food they serve is really heart-warming, especially the pork items. I would suggest to definitely go for the Chef's special items. The price is just too much for the Gariahat locality and could have been a bit on the lower side, but the professional demeanor staffs beats it.
