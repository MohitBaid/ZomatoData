I wonder how I have missed reviewing this place for so long! So many childhood memories associated with this particular place! Ganguram and its amazing varieties of sweets has been an integral part of my life, just like every quintessential Bengali ! Also, try their mishti doi.

Ganguram and Bancharam are legendary sweet shops of Golpark which are there before we are born. They are like Manchester United and Chelsea of Bengali Misthi premiere League and Mouchak is like Arsenal lolzz. Anyways this review is on behalf of my loving grandfather and late grandmother, who used to visit the shop often after picking us up from school. Their Misthis have been a part of parcel of our lives, which has been served to almost all the relatives visiting our Golpark house and an integral element of the lakshmi pujas we organize ever year. Now most of you reading this know better than me when it comes to selecting your favorite sweets and savouries, I usually go for their traditional samosas, lobongo latika, bonde and rabris. These are the heritage shops of South Kolkata and they always get their due respect from every citizens of Calcutta.

Ganguram and Sons is a pure vegetarian eatery and is one of the oldest sweet shops in Kolkata.They have outlets at various places in Kolkata.The ambience and decor is average. We ordered the combo of Radhaballabhi and aloo dum. It was cooked with apt oil and perfect mix of spices which gave it a delicious taste. We also took lassi. Lassi prepared is very refreshing. 
Other items available like Dahi vada, Samsosa, Raj Kachor. A great eatery and a must try for people dwelling nearby.

I have tasted their sweet umpteenth number of times . Although I mostly do my sweet meat shopping from another popular sweet shop this place still holds the charm of old Kolkata. Sweets are still available at very reasonable pricing. Quality is excellent. To name a few indrani is very famous here. The milk crown another fantastic sweet . The savouries are very good too. When I crave for malai chamcham , indrani , milk crown Ganguram is The Place.

The multitude of options they have for sweets is breath-taking, for a  sweet lover someone like me. I find happiness having their sweet dishes. The price is also not sky high, compared to the other sweet shops of its genre and the quality they maintain is absolutely acceptable.

An age old Bong favorite at Gariahat. The years have taken the shine off the building the hoarding the interiors but this place still does best now what it has been doing since ages - and that is make good old Bengali mishti. The USP was Powodi - a sweet Bengali doi - which has now been rechristened to just that - Mishti Doi (head office has confirmed its still the same recipe!). Not a place for your first date - but a must to bring your wife and kids to!

Gangurams has been an old name in sweet lovers book. They have come up with a lot of outlets in the city all around.

##Location:
This outlet is quite an old one located at the Golpark crossing just beside the Kathleen.

##Experience:
I have always been in love with their Misti doi specially. Also you can go for the vintage sonpapdi as well along with the Kaju Barfi. Various kind of sweets available in their offerings and quite well made in terms of quality as well.

The sonpapdi from this place are my sister's favourite, so there's always a box of it at my place. But I am not too fond d of sonpapdis so don't gobble them up with much zest. However I love their doi and their lassi too. Te golpark outlet has a chaat counter where the chutneys are great and the ingredients are fresh, so the resultant chaats are pretty good too.

A childhood favourite for Lassi, this place still serves the same good quality, rich lassi out to of a matka. I have lost track of how many times maa and I have visited this place to quench our thirst with the lassi,  after a shopping spree at Gariahat. 

Over years, on the way back from the lake in the morning after a swim or jog, I have tried their breakfast fare - the radhaballavis, kachoris and samosas have been all pretty decent.

One of my most favourite places to drop by for mishit hogging, when in and around Gol Park. While the Kheer Kodom is to die for, there is seldom a chance that I let go of any opportunity that allows me to settle for a beautiful earthen plate full of creamy, frozen barfi, topped with faluda and rose syrup or for that matter, the malai topped lassi. My favourite take away is the dahi vara. You have to taste their meetha chatni, to believe how delicious it can be. 
They also cater to a large breakfast hungry Calcutta crowd in the mornings with their massive radha ballavis and kachoris. They are super filling and super tempting. If you have missed out on visiting this outlet before, put it up on your list, now.

I am rating this place only for the kulfi. I have never tasted any of their sweets. The kulfi is awesome. I simply love it.
Earlier they used to charge 35/- for a kulfi but now they have increased it to 45/-
They serve it in an earthen bowl. 

If you happen to be somwhere near Gariahat or Golpark, do give it a try. I am pretty sure that it wont disappoint you.

One of the top contenders for being the Queen of all the sweet outlets in Golpark locality besides Banchharam and Mouchak. But trust me, Mouchak doesn't come close to Ganguram in the taste department. It is a very busy outlet and apart from the sweets, there's option for trying Dahi papdi, Raj kochuri and other chats, shingara (samosa). Radhaballavi, aloor dum and dhoklas are also equally tempting. You may find the Radhaballavis to be medium sized but the taste will stay with you for sometime. Though, these items are the main attraction for me rather than the sweets, you won't be able to resist yourself from the sweet department also. Coz there are plenty of options to choose from. 

Undoubtedly, my favourite sweet shop of this locality and it lived up to its reputation for years till I was in the city and it deserves a 4 out of 5 for that.

We have been a regular customer of Golpark Ganguram shop for past three decades. This could be the oldest sweet shop on Gariahat Road.
Their Radhaballabhis, Samosas, Raj Kachori, Dahi Vada, Chaat items are as well known as their Sandeshes and Syrupy items such as Rashogolla Kesar Bhog Rashmalai Chum Chum.
Lassi is great - only there is this  doubt on quality of water used.
Our favorites from Ganguram are Gurh Sandesh Mango Sandesh Shar Bhaja Malai Chum Chum Kesar Bhog Rabri and Rashmalai.
Samosas and Radhaballabhis are regular take aways for breakfast/ tea for us.
For functions when one needs large quantities this is an ideal place to order Sweet Curd and appropriate sweets for the occasion. Quality of sweet curd is as good as "Mithai" on Amir Ali Avenue.
For all items their quality is consistently good and any day better and more reasonably priced than either "Bancharam" or "Mithai"!

The shop here is older than me. So I guess I have been sampling their delicacies forever. The sweets are delectable, the savouries flavoursome.

Try their sweet lassi sometime. Its cold and refreshing with a dollop of fresh malai and a splash of rose water to finish the frothy curd drink. Their chaats are pretty decent as are their hot Radha Ballavis.

Sweets-wise there is a huge plethora to choose from and my favourites during summer are Mango Dahi, Mango Indrani, Hot Gulab Jamuns. The chocolate sweets are pretty delicious too.

So make a visit, if you haven't already and start gorging!

Undoubtedly one of the best sweet shops in town, Ganguram and it's milk cake is pretty famous in Kolkata. Located in Golpark opposite to another all time favourite sweet shop Mouchak, Ganguram specialises not only in authentic Bengali sweets like malai cham cham but also their milk cake and other ghee laden sweets like laddos and gulab jamuns are mouth watering. 
The other items like khasta Kachori, radhaballavi are a must try when here. They also have a separate kulfi and fresh fruit juices section. This place more or less remains crowded because of its location and obviously because of their  amazing range of sweets and snacks. Their Amriti, Pera and MIHI DANA are three of my personal all time favourites also the chanar pulao is a must try for people with sweet tooth. Their dhokla is one the best in town, served with a lip smacking chutney and topped with shredded coconut I love them! 
A very soul satisfying shop if you love sweets! Service is fast and unlike other places you don't have to face rude staffs! When in Kolkata this place is a must try for sure.

This is the mother of the Jadavpur Ganguram. Hence the variety of sweets is much better. I mostly like the Mihidana, Chanar Pulao, Rasogolla and the Shonkhyo Sandesh shaped like a conch. The quality of the cottage cheese they use is quite superior to other and the craftsman ship can be noticed when you bite into a piece of Sandesh. The dimensions of the granules of cheese in the Sandesh gives you an idea of how well the cheese has been kneaded. However, once I had bought Rasogolla from this place and did not taste that much fresh. I know this because the previous week my mom had brought Rasogolla from this place and it was one of the best Rasogolla I have had in my life.

At first,we took 3 lassis & the guy over d counter made it in no time. The lassis were served in bhars(clayey pots used by mithai walas). The taste was superb & we were completely mesmerised by it. Then we took 1 bowl of kulfi faluda,it was splendid as well. The total cost of all came up to around 110-120 approx if i remember correctly

A very good experience overall & the lassi,kulfi faluda are a must if you visit here. Cheers!!

Located in golpark nearby "Mouchak", this joint of "Ganguram &Sons" are one of the busiest outlets in town. They serve a wide variety of their evergreen offerings both sweets and snacks. The most cherished sweets of ganguram like- toast, indrani, gulabjamun, dilkhush, sweet curd, barfi etc; are sold like hot cakes in this outlet within minutes. Other savories like samosa, raj kachoris, lassi, kulfi etc are also served. This outlet stays cluttered most of the time and specially their "Raj kachori" are mouth watering and has got huge demand over here. One of the best popular outlets of ganguram selling quality products with conviction.

Their Raj Kachori Chaat is awesome! So is the hot gulab jamun that is piping hot and made with desi ghee. The sharbhaja chomchom was innovative and good. The shop is conveniently located and is a reliable option always.

From my childhood we have been feasting on Ganguram's doi. In fact if you say Mishti Doi, one of the words which come to your mind is Ganguram.Â 

However, my favorite in this famous sweet shop is not any sweet - it is the Radhaballavi which makes its appearance around 9:30 every morning. Currently priced at Rs 12 each the aroma from the radhaballavis start hitting you as they are being laid out. The niramish (without onion) alur tarkari served with it is an absolute treat - the dilute curry tastes divine when the radhaballavi in it

I used to like their singaras too - however last time I had it I thought it had less moshla (Bengali spices) giving it a potato dominated bland taste.

This renowned old confectionery, located right at the junction of Golpark, is a place where sweet lovers frequently would like to visit. Though the space inside the shop seems to have been compromised a little but there is no compromise with quality.

I have visited this place several times and every time I must say that they do make quality products. From among the range of sweets this place offer my favorites include a never ending list. Keshariya Malai Chamcham,  Kalakand, Kheer kadam, Rosogolla, Milk Crown, Rabri, Pera, and so on........

I also love the dhokla and the chaats from this place. Its a must visit place.

Location----->> Located in Golpark more just opposite to the flower stores and Mouchak!

Been There------>>  Actually never counted , a regular in this outlet.

Attraction------->> The goodwill and the store size with awesome street food and Sweets . A absolute love <3

Things tried -------->> Almost all of their Street Foods and Sweets which are available, but the ones which deserves a special                                                            mention are-- â€¢ Misti Doi â€¢ Rosdogolla â€¢ Kaju Barfi( the best of the lot) â€¢ Amriti â€¢Motichur laddu â€¢Pera
And among the Street foods every item is worth mentioning â€¢ Dhakai Chat â€¢ Dahi Bara â€¢ Papri Chat but the best of all time is â€¢Raj Kachuri Chat ( no one can beat this special item ( Bliss!!)

Quality----> The sweets are made with love and that's  the  reason they taste so wonderful! Again the Raj Kachuri they made             is just perfect, no one can beat the taste of it, even you are not a sweet lover this particular item will make you come everytime!
      
Price---->> Prices were high and it is still high but then this is the average price of all the well known sweet shops in this area                                    
                    80-90 Rs will full your tummy (if you want to make a quick evening snack from here)             

My recommendations---->> â€¢ Raj Kauchri Chat â€¢ Amriti â€¢Rosogolla

Bottom Line---------->> It will always give you a tough choice to choose among the sweet shops in this area but do give it a try 
                                         It will never disappoint you! Trust me!

Have  tried  their  sweets  several  times...  And  also  the  snacks ... The  Radhaballavi   and  thew chats  were  really  great...I  can't  forget  their   Kashmiri  alur  dom  accompanied  with  radhaballavis... The  mouth  watering   taste   is  quite  unique... have    been  there  many  times  and   would  follow  suit  again  and  again!! :) The  sweets   of  Ganguram  are  well  known  all  over  Kolkata  and  they   are  still  catering  to  near  perfection! Way  to  go  Ganguram! :)

We have been frequenting this outlet since we were children for lassi and radhaballavi . Well there is no point for guessing what does in a  good lassi .... It is good curd and the curd here is always so fresh . 

I always say ganguram can do magic with milk . Be it the curds or the chamcham or the very humble kacha gollaa the stuff here is always fresh . I have also eaten my first lavanga latika right here. They place is packed during holidays and festivals and when u see a sweet shop in a buzz , one can vouch for the quality . 

Off late i sampled some of their fare at The Nolen Gur festival and they displayed some a their fare there... 

we ordered a Gur Kolaveri... a medley of almond flakes and gur sandesh and it was simply delicious 
The Gur Abar Khabo was next and thta too was mind numbing but what left us totally speechless was the Gur Kulfi ... There are very few times that i go quiet while eating dessert and the kulfi hit the right notes. 

Kudos to years of brilliance !

Most Bengalis would be familiar with Ganguram as it happens to be favorite activity of a Bengali to buy sweets. Ganguram is a long-established sweet shop that has its own goodwill in Kolkata. Ganguram has good connectivity in the city with the help of 10 shops in different areas. This particular shop is located in Golpark Junction.

The collection of sweets is just mouthwatering. They have all sorts of bengali sweets like rasgulla, shank sandesh, jal bhora taalshaas, langcha, barfi, langcha and many more to name. The shank sandesh and jal bhora taalshaas are not those small ones available in other sweet shops but are really good in size. A recent innovation named Chocolate Sandesh which has flooded sweet shops of Kolkata is also available here. Ganguram's version of Chocolate Sandesh is good to have. Also to mention, Mishti Doi and Rabdi are available here. The shop also serves standard snacks like samosa, vegetable chop, radhaballavi, khasta kachori etc.

The prices are descent and standard to all sweet shops. Fast service can be expected if there is less rush however you will not have to wait for a long time even on days of rush. Aesthetically the shop looks very ill decorated and no renovations have been made over years. You cannot expect the same decor as Balaram Mullick or Bancharam for Ganguram.

Ganguram could be counted amongst one of those places in Kolkata where blindfolded you can take your non-Bong friend to introduce him/her to the famed sweetmeats of Bengal. Ganguram is located near one of the shopping hotspots of the city i.e. Gariahat and is always dotted with multiple customers thronging to the glass showcases with all the mithais inside. I had mishti doi, cadbury sandesh and roshogolla the last time I visited with yet another non-Bong friend just before leaving for Howrah station. She packed in Lobongo Lotikas for home and I was kinda disappointed to find that they weren't selling their famous Dhakai Chaat and Kulfi Malai that day . They are surely amongst the MUST haves for anyone visiting Ganguram.
