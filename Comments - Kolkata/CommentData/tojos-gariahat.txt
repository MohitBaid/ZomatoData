Woaah!! Now wht do i say abt the service??..
U knw here if peoole say gve me tandoori the frst thing they say is sir north indian*ekhano hoyni*..
Nw tell me? Aftr walking fr 15 mins frm ballygunge phadi arriving at the location for having lunch one hears that no indian dish is prepared and only a handful of starters and chinese are ready to be served at ur disposal how will tht feel??..
Cmmon! The service is horrible to say very politely. A hotel famous for its dishes cannot prepare any indian food at around 3 o clock? When its the peak hour??.. im sure u people need to close it down..
A person as favourable and loyal to this restaurant who practically takes opportunities to hang out here is writing this down which certainly means there is an inherent fault and u people need to look into it quite quickly to stop ur customers(we were grp of 10) to go back emptystomach only to be bogged down by finding no other restaurant nearby.!

Hopefully this reveiw hlp people in deciding to atlst chose other restaurants over this one!.

Thnku nd have a foodilicious day!
Tata

Pls, pls, pls do NOT go to this place!! Today I went there with a friend. ordered Fried rice and chilly chicken, the fried rice was soo ordinary and of poor quality, the chilly chicken was even worse with the smell of raw soya sauce coming from it! Then in order to atleast finish the rice somehow we had to order chicken butter masala! it was a huge mistake to do so because their butter masala was more horrible in taste! I literally felt like puking!! Can't believe such crap cost the two of us Rs 750!!!

Horrifying experience.

We were served stale, smelling biriyani. Smelly chicken.
Also, they make you sit with other people in the same table, doesn't listen even if you request to arrange otherwise.
 
Rather rude treatment as a whole, wouldn't even lower the volume of the TV that blares some annoying tv soap. 

Greasy, unclean space. 

I'm not going back. 
Terrible experience. Specifically, the biriyani that literally smelled like on the verge of spoiled. And they charge 200/- for that (what a joke). It's unbelievable that any restaurant would have to serve stale food during the rush days of Pujas. Very disappointing.

Today on the day of Maha sasthi (Durga Puja) we have decided to hop around Gariahat region in morning. From Zomato we have found out about this restaurant and decided to give it a try for lunch. Located beside Basanti Debi College. This restaurant have both open air and AC accommodation available. 
The place was crowded for the occasion of Puja. We have ordered one mutton biriyani and one chicken biriyani. Quantity and Quality wise the foods are ok. Staffs were responsive as well. Only thing that bothered me is the mutton, which was just as like rubber. 
Apart from this little incident everything is well. Pocket friendly, low cost restaurant. I would recommend it for some quick bite. They also have take away service.
I am adding the pictures of that horrible mutton chunk.

Tojos is located at Gariahat just beside the basanti Devi college and can be seen in between the busiest hawker shops. I have been here quite a few times while shopping in this area for quick bites. Recently tried their fish finger as part of quick bite which was okiash. They are one of the oldest for quick snacks in this area and kind of an average place.

During my pujo shopping I dropped into Tojo's as because of my incessant hunger pangs. 
I walked in with great hopes but their food and staff were not near to my hopes! 
We ordered a plate of American chopsuey,it came late with a remarkable less quantity. 
The noodles were fried and nearly burnt. The sauce was too very sweet. It was not near to the quality of various other dine ins. 
I'll not really recommend trying the chopsuey.

The food there is really cheap and delicious and it may not look so impressive but dont judge this place by its appearance and the lollipops were standout

Located very near to the Aircel store in Gariahat. This was the first place where i tasted American Chopsuey.. recently dined here and ordered some chicken side dish which was cooked to perfection but somehow i found the quality of the noodles going down the mark. 
Coming to the ambiance, nothing special but the uncle who took the order was helpful and kind which adds up to the goodwill of the restaurant.
