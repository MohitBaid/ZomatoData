You know what? this place doesn't have a baking oven...they prepare foods on order....and make it heavenly delicious. Hidden in a regular Saltlake street, this place performs the Chinese culinary art so good..you will definitely want to go back.

LOCATION: Hidden from most people living in Saltlake; it is situated near downtown mall in a quiet lane with very few passers by.
AMBIENCE: Though there is not much of an ambience; it is a refreshing change from the everyday restaurants. There is not much of an seating arrangement with few chairs & tables strayed here & there on a roadwalk.
SERVICE: The service is very ordinary but it's one of fastest as I have seen so far.
MENU: The menu is quite short but focuses on serving authentic Chinese at dirt cheap prices. Mainly chicken & prawn are the specialities here.
FOOD: The chicken Cantonese noodles were great to taste but it could have used a little more spice to suit the average Indian palate. The garlic chicken was one of the tastiest Chinese dishes I have had in my life. It was very different from the regular Chinese fare available. The chicken was melt in the mouth & the sweetness of the honey in the gravy perfectly complimented the noodles. All of this was gulped down with a bottle of good ol' 7up.

Well to begin with, i decided to visit this place after one of my friends recommended me for this. Celebrations is situated in saltlake sector 3, (dont know the exact location thoughüòú) the place gives a nice, homely feeling.. with their outward setting of tables and chairs, this place is wonderful. The taste of food however can be improved. Nonetheless i believe this place deserves some support. Its a complete hideout fir those who dont want too much congestion. The prices are affordable and reasonably within ones budget. I would suggest a mandatory visit to this place. Enjoy the breezy evenings with ur friends or partner accompanied by some hot and tasty dumplings.

This little eatery is located in the lane beside Bijan Bhavan, near Salt Lake Big Bazar. The Chinese food here is extremely popular , for dine in as well as takeaway. The restaurant has a few outdoor seats that overlook the road . The service is quick, as fast as fast food can be. The mixed gravy chowmein is good enough for two , if you aren't super hungry . The sweet and sour dry chicken is okay , and it has 8 pieces of chicken , that aren't too difficult to digest. The momos here are also pretty popular. Overall , a nice place for Chinese is you're not looking for gourmet food , but pocket friendly food that makes you happy!

I'm one word---horrendous!!!
I have been a regular customer for quite a long time. Since I reside at a place very near this outlet, I appreciate the food quality provided here. 
Sadly today I placed an order for home delivery(as usual) and the person on the other side of phone totally disregarded my urgency and vaguely took the order. Even had the audacity to disconnect the call when I tried to make him understand that I need the delivery asap. I ringed back again and asked him to make it fast as I have guests waiting at my house. 
I waited for 1.15 mins. Still no delivery. Is this not intentional??? Called celebrations land phone thrice. And the order was of 3 plates of mono only. And the distance between this place and my house is less than a kilometer. 

Am totally disgusted the way they are stating to treat regular customers. 
Refrain from order here for home delivery. 

This is probably the last time I order here. Thanks.  May the owner takes a note of this seriously.

Been having food from this place since childhood,mostly as takeaway and once or twice with outdoor seating..if I had been asked to review this place 10-12 years back,i would have given it a 4.5,considering the awesome momos and other Chinese items they used to serve...but over the years,both their service and their quality has gone down the drain...now,they mess up with the orders on home delivery,sometimes deliver it late,sometimes don't deliver at all and don't bother informing,and when informed about these shortcomings,the owner seems indifferent and apathetic...the taste and quality has also come down,with the momos being the only items which can still be called decent,s served together with soup..it seems they don't want to remain in business for much longer,coz if they do, they definitely have to buck up with regards to the quality and service...the outdoor seating is so so,and nothing much to say about the ambience..

A pocket friendly road side Chinese restaurant. A place where you'll find the typical authentic Chinese flavour in all their dishes. 
We ordered :
‚Ä¢ chicken sweet corn soup - very tasty and full of solid chicken chunks. I give it 3/5
‚Ä¢ mixed fried rice - again packed with flavour and chunks of chicken and prawn. Served in large quantities. I give it 3/5
‚Ä¢ garlic chicken - big chunks of chicken served in sweet tangy garlic gravy. Their quantity is so large that it's difficult for only two people to finish . I give it 3.5/5

A road side foodjoint. One row of sitting. Moderate rate. Spicy food. Used to be crowded. Now looks less queue of people waiting. Mostly home delivery and parcel. Probably due to lack of space and no AC and open on the streets. Tuesday closed. Needs quite a bit of improvement. However well behaved professional staff and good in quantity. But unimpressive kitchen. Can be tried once if not already.

The chicken pan fried momos were awesome in taste. Chilli prawn was good. Chilli chicken dry was not that good. But the shcezwan chicken was too good.. But you have to tell them to make it medium spicy as they make it too hot. Overall u can order food from here. U wont regret.

Where to begin with this utter pile of garbage that this place has become over the year. When i was a kid, i regularly had food from this joint, then if we wanted a quick Chinese take away this was the place to be. Now though, this place has an extraordinary talent of being consistently bad. Food is just horrible, too much sauce, too much salt, over fried to the point the chicken takes like crisps. And then comes the smack on your face the price, are they serious?
Just avoid this place like a plague.

The restaurant has been open for over 15 years... Its the go to place for anyone looking to score some chinese food at a reasonable price... The restaurant itself isn't very impressive looking... Its no more than an upgraded roadside stall... Its got an open air seating arrangement... Its not the ideal place for large groups...
However the food is as good as it gets in that price range... Getting food with better quality or greater quantity for the price they charge is an impractical thought...

I hardly go there to eat as I'm not a fan of their seating arrangement... However I've had countless takeaways & home deliveries from them & I've hardly been disappointed...

If you're looking for some decent chinese food of reasonable quality & quantity at a cheap reasonable price then this is the place for you...

This is a great Chinese takeaway joint as well as restaurant situated on sidewalk with seating area arranged adjacent to the road. Right from their wantons to crispy ginger chickens to fried chilli chickens, traditional momos, chopsueys, noodles, soup and fried rice, they deliver fantastic Chinese food to your doorstep, one of the reasons I'm a regualr customer and resort to Celebration for a quick Chinese getaway whether to serve guests or family.

Ambience: Probably the only criteria where they have the potential to score major brownie points. They have open seating outside, its a pretty place that they got running. They also did not say a thing when I brought my dog and parked her at my table. But I can't say for sure if it's officially allowed, or if they are pet friendly.

Cleanliness: They don't do so good on this part. The glasses they serve water in, generally had oil stains on them, both times I've been there. The lids on the pots of sauces kept on the table also have a layer of dust, probably because of being right next to traffic.

Food: Again, probably a 2 on the scale of 5. Too much oil, or layer of corn flour on anything chicken, or pork, and them dipped in gravy. I did like the one time I asked them to make chilly chicken without that starchy layer. I do like their chowmein though, especially the rice and chowmein combo they got going.

Its been in Saltlake sector 3 area for a close 10 to 12 years and probably the only restaurant of that time and also till now with a authentic feel of outdoor street style seating which is something unique in Saltlake area .
I have personally been here several times as well as done uncountable home deliveries  right from its existence so I am a clear cut expert in their food judgement for sure so to be honest this restaurant really did some real magic in the food scene of salt lake when it was in full swing right from the quality of food to the great service of the staff and the owner too it was a very positive place to eat but lately in my recent couple of visits in the year 2015 I have found a sudden drop in quality and quantity of the food that i usually have eaten over here ,which is certainly not a good thing to see as a well flourished restaurant sink down so bad with its preparations that once used to compete with other neighboring food places possibly because the kitchen is handled by new people I suppose or whatever  it is it isn't doing good for the restaurant as the name it had earned was very recognised in terms of fine foods and service so the management should see to this as soon as possible if they are really wanting to welcome customers and are wanting them to leave with a smile on their face after feasting their
preparations.

Now talking about what I have tried out here  not judging from earlier times when I visited but the recent one I'll list out what i usually ordered from here and to start I have tried mostly all the chicken dishes from chilli chicken to garlic chicken and Manchurian too which doesn't seem to impress as it used from before however eatable but not enjoyable.
Moving on to rice I have had mixed rice , fried rice , steam rice and yes their rice is still the same so no problem their however quantity has reduced from before , then coming to noodles I have tried the chicken Hakka chow and chicken gravy chow which is really a turn off as being tasteless ,dry and not at all appealing  from the plate , so simply a bad experience there and after all this finally I would say I am looking forward To visit this place again only if they bring in some changes and not dissapoint the folks who were once a food fanatic of this lovely place .

Used to be a really good Chinese Delivery joint about 8-10 years back. I have some really good memories of this place. Recently i tried their Hakka noodles. It was terrible. Tasteless , bland. Owing to my nostalgia about this place, I tried to give it a second chance, even after people warning me otherwise. This time I ordered Crispy Chicken, which used to be one of their specialities. This time I what I got was some absurdly sweet tasting chicken in sort of a soggy gravy. They forgot the part where it was supposed to be crispy and a dry starter. Terrible experience. Never again. No idea how a place can go so downhill.

Highly disappointed. Tasteless food. I found the owner eating biriyani in his Chinese food joint. Brand loyalty at its worst,  or he knows the nightmarish experience of the food he offers.  The sechuan noodles was very dry,  to the extent that we were unable to finish it. The gravy chowmein had that odd smell of white flour.

This place started way back in the early 2000's and if I am not mistaken before 2005 itself. I have been going there ever since it opened its shutters and it rarely disappointed me. I am not comparing to any other place but with the kind of food Celebrations serves, it has a special place in the hearts of Saltlake residents.
The waiters are extremely friendly. It has provisions for open air seating only so the ambiance is okay, nothing commendable.¬†
The noodles,chicken steamed momo,french mushroom chicken veg,chilly potato, veg fried wonton and crispy veg are among its specialties.

Most disastrous Chinese food center in Salt Lake, very low quantity. Quality is also very bad. Ordered mixed chowmin and sweet and sour veg. Vegetables are not properly boiled and the most important there is no taste in the food. Completely worthless. Better go to Ranjan's restaurant or blue poppy near gorkha bhawan for excellent Chinese food.

The delivery was also very prompt. So in Saltlake if you guys want to eat affordable Chinese food then go ahead and order from this place..

This petite little place is located right behind Bijan Bhawan is salt lake and thus is often missed. This place has been around for a long time serving authentic  chinese cuisine in the locality. Earlier it could have been called the best place to find Chinese but due to the economic boom that Salt Lake has experienced in the 21st century, it has fallen behind.
        It is still a cheap place for takeaways and the chinese is still good although not great. Have the fried chicken momos and the dry chilli chicken. They are still mouth watering delicacies. Don't go for the rice noodles - preferably have the noodles or rice. The American chopsuey they pffer is also pretty good.

Visited this place with Aniket cause he said grew up having Chinese from here. It was around 4 in the afternoon. The place was empty. Really liked the Chinese decorations. Ordered 1 chicken clear soup and 1plate crispy fried chicken. Food was served after 10mins. Had the soup first and it wasn't bad. Next was the chicken. They overcooked it. Some pieces were really hard to eat. I found it a bit too sweet. Quantity was good enough for 2 people. Fankly speaking the place is overpriced. You get food at the same price in a.c restaurants.

In a mood for Chinese which is light on your pocket? This food joint is the right destination! This place doesn't have great visibility as it's tucked in from the main road, but it is definitely worth trying. I would recommend the Schezwan Noodles and Chilli Chicken! Good quantity and great taste! Quick home delivery, so if you have a sudden craving for Chinese, hit this joint!

Visited this place with Aniket cause he said grew up having Chinese from here. It was around 4 in the afternoon. The place was empty. Really liked the Chinese decorations. Ordered 1 chicken clear soup and 1plate crispy fried chicken. Food was served after 10mins. Had the soup first and it wasn't bad. Next was the chicken. They overcooked it. Some pieces were really hard to eat. I found it a bit too sweet. Quantity was good enough for 2 people. Fankly speaking the place is overpriced. You get food at the same price in a.c restaurants.

A small joint with 3-4 tables open seating,  its more of a take away joint managed by a Chinese family. Light on pocket and serves decent food. Home delivery takes a little more time than expected.

In a mood for Chinese which is light on your pocket? This food joint is the right destination! This place doesn't have great visibility as it's tucked in from the main road, but it is definitely worth trying. I would recommend the Schezwan Noodles and Chilli Chicken! Good quantity and great taste! Quick home delivery, so if you have a sudden craving for Chinese, hit this joint!

This week, I am rating my favorite 'Para' Chinese joints in Salt Lake City.
I will first rank them per my choice, assuming that all of these joints serve very cheap, palatable 'desi' 'bangali-cized' chinese cuisine, ranging from 'just-about-OK to 'ooh-so-good', and then list the factors that helped me do the ranking.
However all of them will get straight 3.5s so that I don't look biased ;)
So here it is:
1. Variety / Taste - 4/5 - and yes the lemon chicken is very different from the chilly chicken
2. Quality - 4/5 - good quality ingredients used
3. Grease Factor - 4/5 - not too greasy - easy to digest, guilt-free junk...
4. Portion Size - 4/5 - each plate serves 2 mid-sized hogs comfortably...
5. Accessibility / Availability - 4/5 - easy to locate, but closes down early...
6. Service / Delivery - 4/5 - friendly staff, good packaging, ok seating

And (drumroll)...the verdict is Rank#2 !

This is a very pocket friendly chinese place. The rice and chowmein are very rich in flavour. I particularly love the gravy chow. The chicken preparations are almost the same. But they give 10 pieces for a very less price. So that suits me. For a quick nigh in with the family, I quite prefer this place.

Against this review I had a pathetic experience yesterday and forced to re-write my review and edit it. This place has no value for customer's time. I ordered st 8.30 for chilli chicken and mixed meifoon, they said it would be delivered in half an hour, so I waited. At 9.45 I got a couple of calls from an unknown number, picked up the phone and a man asked me for my address. ¬†I gave it patiently for the 2nd time. ¬†The man on the line was rude and uncivil and called me back to explain he was waiting for the past 5 minutes on the ground floor. I looked all around and realised there was no one and by then I also realised he was lying and definitely at the wrong address.¬†

5 minutes later another call confirmed that he was indeed at the wrong address, cf-32 which was the wrong block, this was despite me giving them the address twice and explaining the landmarks. I was unwell and in no mood to fight or loose my cool but when the food that should have arrived at 9 arrived at 11 pm my mom definitely did not feel pleased. By then I had already eaten , it was not that there was no food at home, being a foodie I just craved for Chinese and was unwell to make it by myself.

The delivery man was reeking of alcohol and smelling from a distance. We immediately told him that we had already finished dinner and to take the parcel back.He just informed us that he was given him the wrong address and walked away without an apology. A horrible Sunday night experience and this is definitely on my go to places any more. I would not recommend it for those of you who order in from home cause they clearly ¬†do not respect the customer's time.

A small chinese joint located in one of the confusing lanes of salt lake! Difficult to locate.... I hate their konjee crispy chicken! Their garlic chicken ... Chicken Manchurian.... Gravy noodles is yum! Service is quick... The place is done up very differently and is surely a good usage of area available to them! :)

The chop-suey was horrible. The shrimps were stale and UNDERCOOKED ! The chicken bits were also stale and tasteless.
I couldn't eat more than two spoons, felt like I needed to vomit.
I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.
Since it was delivered to me at home, I couldn't complain to the restaurant owners.
Hope they serve better food in future.

A cute chinese restaurant which is also managed by chinese people. Decent food, seating is on the roadside pavement which gives you a different experience.

Very economic. Food taste is average. Do not order Chop-suey, its really very bad. I have tried other preparation and they are good.  A couple can enjoy a good food within 400-500. The only disadvantage is sitting arrangements, its in road under a roof, sometimes you will find cockroaches moving on table. The Vinegar and ketchup containers are old :(

This place is like our second home.. At least thrice a week food from the kitchen of Celebration ought to be on the dinner table.. Since the past decade they are serving good quality food and maintaining their standards all the way long.. It is also known for the quantity of food they serve which can bring smile to the big foodies like me.. From hanging out with friends to special occasions Celebration has always been a part.. Mei foon is my fav followed by the chopsuey and garlic chicken, really its Chopstick licking good..

I have been to this place sometimes, since it is near to my workplace. And I have to say, this place, though it looks small, is actually good enough for a leisurely meal .In fact, being a bit away from the crowds and nestled in a quiet residential neighbourhood has its own advantages. Moreover, it is easily accessible, being exactly midway between Bijon Bhawan and GD Island in Salt Lake Sector III. 
 Coming to the food now. Though I have had quite a few items here, the things that I have enjoyed more are the Mixed Fried Rice and Chili Chicken Gravy. This combination suits me well and the quantity is decent. Enough for a fill. And for snacks, you may try the  Fried Momo as well. And also the American Chopsuey. The important thing is that a meal here will not burn a hole in your pocket s the prices are quite reasonable. But again, on the downside, if it‚Äôs a hot day and you want to cool off, this may not be the best option since the sitting arrangements are outside. Yes there are shades on top, but not good enough for a typical humid summer day. But, on the whole, I would wind up saying that I do like this place quite a bit for the occasional bite.

Well I have seen this place as it is for the last 14 - 15 years and there hasn't much that's changed ever since... Going by the kolkata food scenario that is a huge compliment . This is a small take away and delivery joint right behind bijon bhawan in salt lake . Small little place has the huge granite name plate with its name written n metal ... Red lantern hanging, its very hard to miss. 

Coming to the food, it is by far the only place is salt lake that knows how to make a decent american chopsuey. The dry chili chicken and the lemon chicken have nice as is the chicken pakora ( chuckles ! i too have a very desi side ). The Schezwan fried rice and Cantonese noodles are nice too. 

Once upon a time that's all we had and it was bluddy darn good ... the quality has come down tad bit but also that our taste buds have evolved 10 fold. Not much to say but the food has always been consistent and the pocket pinch for two ppl is approx 500 and the quantities are nice.

I used to love this place and keep ordering from here until golden city opened in salt lake. I would not say that the food is extremely good but it is alright, especially the dry chilli chicken. The noodles are alright, albeit a little rubbery. Moreover, the sitting arrangements are outside and I would not advise you to go in case you want a sophisticated ambiance. I say order from here in case you are in salt lake and the other preferred shops are closed.

This place is cheap. And you get really good bang for your buck. You cannot possibly keep comparing it to a place which charges you a good bit more for the quality, and that is where people are making mistakes when they talk about the place. True, earlier it was way better, but it is still pretty decent and would be a great choice for an inexpensive meal, delivered to you at home.

Best Chinese takeout in Salt Lake. My favourite is the American Chopsuey with Crispy Chicken, never disappoints. Although 10years ago their quality was at par with the best on Park Street. Their green chilli sauce is one of a kind.

Used to serve the best fried rice and spring roll (dragon roll to be more specific) in Salt lake area, although they have deteriorated a lot with time, but not all on a sudden like Momo hut. Main cources were also okay, so do the noodles and meifoon. Oh yes, they also do serve homemade chilli garlic sauce (very tasty and irresistable). Very good home delivery system indeed and also few seating arrangements on pavement.

When you want to have Calcutta style Chinese at the comfort of your home without spending much, this is your to-go place. They also deliver nearby, else you have to take away. Stick to the basic menu like noodles, and chilli chicken and stuff like that and you shall have a nice meal.

Celebrations is a decent Chinese takeaway joint and you can even sit on the road outside and eat. Its nothing fancy but i usually like it quite some much. Their meifoon or rice noodles is pretty neat as is their dragon rolls-which is chicken,with prawn fillings. My special favourite is their momo which used to be the best in salt lake till Blue Poppy arrived and garlic prawn. The quality of their prawn is way better than the one's served at Blue Poppy. Their seating arrangement is open air, on the foothpath and can seat 16 people. At times the service is slow but that is because of the huge amount if orders they get. But the reason you go back there is because you get an amzing amount if food. Their 2 portions suffices for 5 people. And you go back for another thing- good old Kolkata Chinese. They have a parlour next door- a small Chinese parlour, the kind that was in fashion decades ago before the fancy ones came up. You get served food there while,sitting down for pedicures.

I tasted their chili chicken and it was hell of an experience.
It was equally bad eating mixed fried rice and garlic chicken that I ordered for a quick dinner.
The 'wontons' served are usually over fried and stiff.
They take a lot of time to serve even when there are very few customers waiting.
The sitting area is on the footpath, no options for private dining.

The place is a good Chinese joint. The last time I went here, I ordered the mixed chow mien, chicken manchurian and pepper fish. The food was quite good, served piping hot, and the quantities were quite enough for two people. The ambiance is however nothing to write home about... however, I found sitting outside and eating in full public view not to my liking. Otherwise, its decent enough for a takeaway.

These people have a parlor just beside their restaurant. I was unfortunate enough to once go to that parlor. When they sent me to an upstairs low ceiling room to change, I saw the vegetables to be used for cooking at the restaurant just lying on the floor with all dirty parlor stuff.

I never went back to that parlor, neither did I ever order any food from the restaurant again. AVOID.

This place is pretty famous as a chinese take away in saltlake..but compared to its rising prices,the food isnt really that good.A few traditional items are good,but many items could be vastly improved.The prices keep shooting up on a regular basis.Its primarily a take away,although outdoor seating can accomodate perhaps three groups at a time.This place is famous among residents of saltlake only because it started out at a time when competition was scarce.Food here nowadays is pretty much average.And thats a cause for concern for any restaurant id say.So unless this place can offer something better,today's competition would definately eat into it's clientele.

every thing tastes absolutely bad and cheap!
be it its starters or main course.. i felt pukish after having food from celebration!
its not even food .. it feels like they are trying to dispose off all their stored oil by serving it with every dish! yes u get free oil(tonnes of them) with every dishes!
