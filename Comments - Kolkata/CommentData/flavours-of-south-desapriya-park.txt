This is basically a small shop that has been divided and one part converted to a kitchen with stoves and other paraphernalia to serve South Indian food items like idli, vada, dosa and filter coffee. I had the idli, the size was good, the chutney was a bit on the sweeter side and I thought ground more finely than it should have been, the coconut chutney should be slightly grainy.The filter coffee was ok, served in the traditional style of steel glass and bowl. But what I didn't like was the attitude of the two people running the shop,one lady and one man, their behaviour was off putting, bordering on the verge of rudeness. They weren't actually rude but their attitude was  like couldn't be bothered, couldn't care less.... Customers should be treated better....in a more friendly and positive manner.
There is no seating, one can sit on the few stools arranged on the pavement or eat standing or best just takeaway.
