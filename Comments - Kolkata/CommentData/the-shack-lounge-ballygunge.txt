Visited this outlet on the 31st of December with 4 of my friends for afternoon snacks and Shisha. The service was terrible.. Totally out of expectations.

‚Ä¢ Located right behind the Bata in Ballygunge only a few metres away from the Quest Mall.
‚Ä¢ Ambience: On the 31st evening they had a Birthday decoration on with some red and white balloons, I didn‚Äôt like it. It has a sort of a Shisha Bar and a Rooftop Lounge with thatched roof, which breaks the monotony of the place.

‚Ä¢ Service: We ordered for a Hookah and Cold Drink almost immediately as we entered, after half an hour when we asked about that, they said that they didn‚Äôt understand that we have actually ordered. This is just silly, I believe. How can you entertain someone in your cafe when they haven‚Äôt ordered for something for the past 30 mins.

At the end also before I finished eating the server started clearing my plate and I had  to stop him.

‚Ä¢ I was not happy and ordered for only two plates of Crispy Chilly BabyCorn and it was good.

‚Ä¢ Moreover, this place is dirty, the menu cards are dirty as well as the chairs and cushions. 

Sorry I didn‚Äôt like it.üôÅ

I visited the shack yesterday with my friends for the Newyears Eve as I heard a lot about this place, we visited in the daylight so the ambiance was a bit different from the night. 
It is located opposite to quest mall, beside the lane of very famous sahil building where we go straight from the parking area and take an elevator which leads us to this rooftop lounge.
The place is very beautiful with open air area and the roof being covered with hay,wood. The seating arrangement is quite exquisite but not at all maintained, cushions , seats were all covered with dirt and very worn out. When we entered at around 2pm, the place was still being set, but we managed to grab a place for 5 of us and had ordered for:
Premium sheesha- Paradise (as suggested)
Soft drinks
2portions of crispy baby corn
We were planning to have dessert too as we were coming after lunch, but changed our mind because of the kind of service they provided. We ordered the hookah first, even after 30 mins of waiting when it did not reach our table we asked another person about it and he said that our order wasn't placed also our server was not actually a server , he was not supposed to take orders. So a table at this place in early hours goes unattended for 30 mins, that's the impression we get! Lot of our time got wasted in this confusion and we couldn't really sit at that place for long.
But on the bright side the babycorn came really prompt to our table after we ordered thankfully, the taste was very nice, a combination of sweet and spicy, we loved it. The hookah was average though being called a premium one it did not have any such feature except from the fact that it was smooth and didn't choke. 
Service post to that miscommunication was better, while leaving one of the team members had the Courtsey to wish us a happy new year which is a great gesture.
A tip: please keep your restaurant/lounge open, only if you are ready.

They do have Mediterranean food and waffles üòç ; started off as a nice place, it is turning out to be just another shady spot for underage hookah lovers!

Its an amazing place with beautiful ambience. Well lit rooftop cafe. I orderd alfredo, grilled quasadilla, popeyes pick, virgin mojito, a chocolate waffle(cant remember the name) . All were delicious except grilled quasadilla and waffle. The waffle was hard like a stone we couldnt even break it with the fork provided inspite of so many attempts and atlast we had to forgo it about the quasadilla the experience was terrible too the stuffing tasted like it had been kept for few days it tasted that bad. But the crepe,"popeyes pick" was heavenly, it was mouth watering have never got such a wonderful crepe to taste before! Overall it was a good experience except for fooding its good and also its quite cheap. Perfect for a date night!!

Visited this place on the occasion of a friend's birthday. 
They have an open area and seating arrangements in a room as well. 
The staff are courteous, though a little unprofessional and clumsy. Service was quick, keeping in mind the amount of food that was ordered. 
We had veg noodles, margarita pizza, french fries, coke, and a blueberry hookah. 
The hookah was smooth. 
Food was really good, especially the noodles. 
Will definitely visit again and try their other items.

This rooftop lounge offers a great view and has a good ambience but the food quality and service is not up to the mark. 

The waiters are not really interested in taking orders and ensuring that the customers have no problems, rather they are busy sitting and taking hookah themselves! 

We wanted to try Lebanese but since nothing was available we ordered Chilli Paneer and Burnt Garlic Rice. It wasn't that good in taste ad expected. 

The hookah and Strawberry Shake was good. 

There is still a lot of room for improvement in all aspects over here. @

I went for a friend's birthday lunch. We had a decent experience here. Ordered Nachos, Pizza Exotica, Mixed Sauce Pasta, Popeye's pick, Blueberry shake, Blue Lagoon, Litchi o kiwi drink and Chocodynamite Waffle. Food was really good. 
They suggested Popeye's pick when asked their best in savory. It's a crepe made of spinach and corn topped with Cheese sauce. I totally loved it. 
I loved the Chocodynamite Waffle as well. It's a crispy waffle crafted with Chocolate sauce and Choco chips and tastes heavenly. 
Mixed Sauce pasta was equally good. 
Ambience: could have been better. 
Service: not that prompt. 
Pocket pinch: We were 5 people and bill was around Rs. 2000.

Had the worst experience one can have in a lounge. So the opening time for the shack lounge is 11:30 AM. And we reached there after 12, but were said that the cafe is still opening and it will take them some time to serve us. We were however okay with it, and thought about seating. About 5 of us sat in the rooftop area, and half of our group was about to reach. After they reached approximately after 15 minutes of us seating there they inform us that they won't be able to serve us hookah, and that they only serve hookah after 2 PM, because some school nearby had a problem with it. Because we had gone on a Sunday, we reasoned by saying that the school is closed today so it definitely won't be a problem. But then they said that the guy who makes hookah has not arrived yet. We were soo disappointed we had to leave after waiting for half an hour. We had to take cabs to reach the lounge and to go somewhere else after that. Literally money wasted. Had no food, so don't have any clue about it, but the service definitely a turn off.

Quantity itna kum ke hairaan rah gaye.
Roadside stalls ka half plate order denge toh usme bhi yahan se zyada quantity rahega !
Aur upar se uska daam rupees 200.
Daam itna aur quantity Maggi barabar.
Boht hi zyada dukh hua . Aur aage himmat hi na hua ke aur order kare !!

Worst experience ever...

I never rate any restaurants this badly.

Firstly lemme tell you about my experience ...

Me and my friend went there for some casual time and to relax...though the welcoming was good, but there were no waiters coming to take the orders at all, we sat for around half hour and were very hungry. After few moments, the waiters went vanished.

The situation was like this...we were hungry, waiting for more than half hours now and no waiters. 

I cant review about the food at all...cause after like waiting for 45 mins we had to get up and head for exit. Even then also the waiters were busy among themselves.

Oh!! I forgot to mention....they were busy serving one large group only. We and 4 other people had to leave because of the poor service.


I wish our next visit here, would be a bit better.

I seriously cant recommend this place to anyone for its horrible service.

The only 1.5 rating is received, is due to its ambience. Which is good.

REALLY DISAPPOINTED...!! 

I'm really sorry shack lounge.

We went to this place on a Saturday evening and on the contrary it was pretty empty. I think it was a signal to us that we should move out of the place immediately coz very few joints have seats available on such a peak time.

However, we sat down and decided to order grilled quesadilla, Mexican wrap and kiwi mohito. It was a hot summer evening and the waiter was kind enough to bring the cooler just beside us making it comfortable.

After a long wait, we got the grilled quesadilla. By the look of it we knew that it won't be like the usual ones that we eat in Taco Bell or Chillis. The crust was as hard as a biscuit and the filling was like that of roadside veg roll fillers.

Then came the mexican wrap which was an Indian roti filled with hard black beans ( they didnt even boil it properly ) and the same filler as the quesadilla .

We hoped at least the drink will save our evening. The kiwi mohito had too much of Mint leaves making the flavor too strong. There was no taste of Kiwi and we even found lemon seeds in our mouth while drinking.

We decided to have dinner elsewhere as the food was to bad. We couldn't eat most of what was served to us.

I would not recommend this place to anyone. I just wasted my money and time going here.

The place is located near quest mall, easy to find.. The ambience is quite good as they provide outdoor seating.. i liked it very much.. though you cant seat their in summer..
Talking about service, the service is a bit slow, but the waiters are good in behaviour..
The most important thing-food, i ordered pizza exotica which was average in taste (not bad).. Quesadilla (tortilla) was not at all good, it was very salty so we had to replace it..
Not much choice for mocktails but we tried kiwi blast which was very sweet and was seriously not good in taste.. so overall, the food was really not good..
I dont think that I will recommend the place to anyone..
The rating is 2.5 only because of the ambience and location..

This place has a great view! Night time or day time, you'll absolutely love the view. It has both open seating as well as a room one. I'd suggest if you want to sit inside then you reserve your seats since its not big enough to accommodate many. Coming to the food, it is not cheap, but the quality and quantity is good. The taste is good as well. The hookah is smooth and you'll like it. The mocktails were good and loved the refreshing feel of it. 
However, the service is a little slow, should've been more prompt but the staff is super friendly.
Also, they have really good board games which you can play to your heart's content. Definitely recommend it!

Just left from The Shack Lounge. Disappointed and angry. Bad service, Bad food. Reason given that they were low on staff. Really?! The ones who were there were least bothered. After waiting for menu for 20 mins, had to get up and ask for one. They served italian salad with no pasta and only veggies with sour taste. When complained, no one bothered to change it. At least they had the courtesy to not add it to my bill and apologize for the bad service.
Off my list 4ever!!

This place is well situated right in the opposite lane of Quest Mall. It is easy to locate. It is on the top floor of the building and has an open air as well as closed seating arrangements.

This place serves Hookah. However, the day we visited (14/01/2017) there was some government prohibitions due to which they were not serving Hookah.

This place has a nicely decorated open air setup with projector and music. The staff is cordial and friendly. Firstly, we did not like the Red Sauce Pasta as it was not spicy. Then after complaining the staff replaced it and then it was well prepared and tasted good as well.

We also order Mezze Platter which was good but the quantity of Olives in rice was just too much. Falafel and Pita Bread tasted well.

The service speed of the cafe is damn slow and they really need to work on it.

The "Ala Al Orlando" Pizza was well prepared and tasted good too.

I visited this outlet once previously too. Say around 3 months back, we then tried Hakka Noodles which tasted heavenly (a must have). Crispy Chilli Baby Corn was the usual and the mocktails were decent.

To rate segment wise,
Food - 3.5/5
Decor - 4/5¬†
Service Speed - 2/5
Staff - 3.5/5
Location - 4.5/5
Cost - 3.5/5

Nice Sufi music with good ambience is appreciated with good mocktails but it would be have been a perfect mood setting ambience if my taste buds would have bee  satisfied... needs to improve a lot on the food quality as the food served was cold and it didn't even taste good it was okayish...

Obviously this restaurant appears in the 'Order food' section of my Zomato app. Tonight, after ordering and paying through net-banking, they also confirmed my order. Suddenly, after half an hour later of ordering the food, someone from Zomato rang me up and informed that the restaurant can not deliver to my address as now it seems that the distance is too much.

Most astonishingly a few minutes after the call, the app is showing that the food has been delivered.

I am a regular customer of Zomato and certainly did not expect such UNPROFESSIONAL behaviour from the restaurant and from Zomato to say the least.

Being a total foodie ,I keep hunting for new places.Had no idea abt this place til someone suggested me. How could I not knw abt it.?? It's a cool happening den. Located close to the quest mall abv Gupta brothers . Really liked the ambience with feet tapping music .The weather played an imp role in making the whole atmosphere super. FOOD were delicious and staff prompt. U would mostly find ppl with hookah .I am sure very few come with the intension to have a wholesome meal cos they don't give u a main course plate. Nice place would love revisiting.

Located above gupta brothers outlet if ballygunge, no hoarding of the lounge anywhere. Difficult to find. Ambience was soothing. Rooftop is good in winter season. Went on dinner there with group of friends. Food was delicious. We had ordered nachos, garlic bread, exotica pizza, popeye pick, rosti, chilli Mojito, chocolate shake. It was yummy. Only one negative point, they didnt properly gave service. The owner was very kind, helped us. Thank you a lot. 
Only service need to improve.

Location: in ballygunge, near to quest mall. It goes inside a lane beside bata shoes showroom. It is situated on the top most part of the building.

Design and other information: when you reach the destination and go up the stairs, there is this huge signage with a, what i would either presume is a bar or a DJ place. Anyways. It has two rooms. One for outside and one for inside. The inside got A.C and since winter is coming, we opted for outside. The climate was the best for this kind of situation. Some chairs are bench and some are chairs.

Food: unfortunately, we did not order any food as we were full. So we ordered for only teen pan hookah. It did not choke. It was fairly good.

Ratings: i would give 3.5/5.0. Hoping to come back here again soon.

Great ambience. Although music was not played outside during afternoon time and there was no board game available. 
Order-
Reading the hype about Viva Italian sandwich, decided to go for it but unfortunately it was below average. Too dry and not that cheesy.
Alfredo pasta- It tasted good and was quite filling. Made up for the bad sandwich which we could not finish. 
Food quality should be improved.

This cafe is aptly named as it is actually built like a shack. It is divided into two sections. The indoor section is quite small, air conditioned and has a playstation 4 for people to play games there. The outdoor section is amazing. They have board games like Jenga, etc etc. It is a purely vegetarian cafe which is situated on the 3rd floor of the building. This cafe is very well decorated and with wooden chairs and tables.I personally love to visit this cafe during late afternoon or evening.

I entered this place with the only motive of learning to play PS4, but ended up falling in love with it.
Being a rooftop lounge makes it special in it's own way. The ambience brings you to a complete different place from the world. The dim lights and the music keeps you glued.
The staff is very helpful, warm and welcoming. The food is yumm and fresh. This place is not much expensive. It can be a prefect spot for fun- loving people as it they provide with board games, live screening and hookah.
Shack lounge creates a comfort zone for you. I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent there.

After a long wait, I finally visited the shack lounge few days back. Let me start from the ambience, which is a bit okay than their food. I am pretty disappointed with their service. Now talking about their food, we ordered pizza, pasta & quesadillas which was tasteless. I guess they need improvement in both the areas. There's something that doesn't work about this place. I had an horrible experience on my friend's birthday. Music system over their doesn't work. Do yourself a favour and avoid this unwelcoming place with horrid food.

If you're looking for a nice place to go out alone for a coffee, or hang out casually with friends or just a group of girls/ladies or a family outing, Shack's the place to go! It's a totally safe, a fun place with music, AC lounge, outdoor rooftop complete with big screen and lovely food. The mocktails served here are nice, even the ordinary vanilla milkshake is prepared perfectly! They also serve hookah in multiple flavours and arrange live band of music on special occasions. 
Watching matches on the big screen is more fun here than anywhere else! They won't let your kids get bored what with play station and board games. 
The friendly staff provide service with smiles on their faces. You will never be turned away no matter how full it gets here! They make place for you every time you visit! Even the management ensures the customer goes back smiling. I've gone back again and again for the food and good service. Truly a fun place for people of all ages.

Visited this place quite a few days ago and expected it to be wondrous but wasn't that good. The place is hot and humid due to the covers overhead. Not enough coolers to suffice everybody. We got one but it was taken away by other guests which was strange. The atmosphere got so suffocating that we just ordered the nachos and Alfredo pasta and got over with it quickly. Pasta was really bland. The ambience is beautiful but has not been managed well. Heat is a big spoil.

I recently went to this place and it was a good experience.food was nice and hookah was awesome.one thing I would say to bring into the attention of the authorities that they should add some more items to the menu which is more filling like Mexican rice wid curry nd more which will draw more attention as I went nd found items not so much heavier as a meal.

I visited this place recently on the day of the Ind v Aus WT20 match. 
It is located at ballygunge on the third floor of the building with gupta brothers restaurant on the ground floor. 

The place was jam packed by the time the match got started and still they managed to fit in a few seats to accommodate us too. The same practice was seen later on also with groups joining in. 
This itself gave a positive feel regarding the place. Normal places would've just rejected the ppl coming in citing that it is jam packed.

When I heard about the place first, I was a bit skeptical. A sports cafe which doesn't have booze and is also veg?? I wasn't too excited to try it out. But I came over on my friend's assurance that the place is good. And yes, it was. The ambience, decor, behaviour of the staff, the crowd present, the food quality and the hookah- these together present a very ideal combo for viewing a match. 
We ordered a tomato cheese n corn pizza , French fries, cold coffee along with different hookahs all throughout the match. All the items were equally good, with the star of the lot being the cold coffee.
We were totally impressed by the friendliness of the management - they do give out complimentary beverages and most importantly, they cut a cake to celebrate India's win and shared it with all the ppl present there. That was a very happy moment for all.
We were so impressed that we booked a table for the semis match too!
Pros:
1. Awesome crowd
2. One of the best management/staff i habe seen in Kolkata
3. Great hookah n food
4. Nice ambience

Cons:
1. Sitting space is limited. Maybe since I went on a match day, the crowds were high
2. Parking is an issue. The entire locality roads got jammed up that day.

Not very popular, the place!
I found it on Zomato and was very eager to go to this place. 
I went in the evening, and the place was very well lit up. The interior was amazing. The staff was really cordial, one of them was known, so I did not face any problem. A must visit for a roof top outing and for a place that gives you the "Goa feel"!
We ordered Hukah  (Vanilla Rasna) and it was okay. It wasn't too good but neither bad. The ambience seemed to be covering all flaws.
We ordered for a Viva Italian, which was  well made. And we enjoyed eating it. 
The place has Wifi. 
The best according to me was the idea of having a Hand Sanitizer on each table for the customer. That was something unique and a core competency, according to me.
This place would go a long way.
A must visit!

Ambiance- Very good... I specially recommend ppl to go there in the eve.. Lighting is amazing, music is not too loud which is again a positive point since u dun need to shout while having a conversation ;)

Food- Quality is really really amazing... Had margheritta pizza and chocolate shake.. Tastes yummy... The chocolate shake ova here is a must have for all the chocolate lovers out dere... 

Hookah- Very well made... Smoke has a good density unlike few other hookah bars were they keep on giving excuses for lesser smoke density, lasts very very long...

Staff-me and my frnd stayed dere for over 2hours and v actually had the freedom to talk and stay for as long as we wanted to lol.. Most amazingly many of the staff ppl actually asked whether we enjoyed the food and had any complaints or not.. It is good to see wen employees or staffs try to give 100% for their customers and doesnt fail to pamper them... 

Price-a bit high... But for this kinda ambiance, and food you wont mind paying this much....

Will iI again come or not- Hell yeah!!! I am coming if possible every day :)
 
Giving a 4 to this place since i wan them to continue being so good as they r now... 
A huge thumbs up to this place and all of their staff members, they r really really appreciable...

Was invited for tasting here! Greeted very nicely we were accompanied to our seats by Mr nikhil who took utmost care of us! He suggested us virgins mojito and a kiwi mocktail. The mojito was just lemon  water topped with mint leaves, the kiwi drink was nice :) they served us a mushroom crepe which was not well made, tasted very average! Then came the viva Italian sandwich which was the beat out of the lot, I would recommend this to anyone visiting this place! We ended our meal with waffles, which was a little soggy but tasted decent. This place has to work on the food, the hookah was nice as usual! Service was perfect :)

The Shack Lounge - A really great rooftop cafe to chill over some hookah, food or beverages.
=====
Intro + Location: I had been to the Shack lounge twice. It is open air and it has indoor seating arrangement also. It can accommodate large amount of people. The wooden tables, the arrangements, the projector etc etc. is applauding.

I was really mesmerised with their ambiance and they have playstation and board games too. It is more like a chic cafe made by keeping into consideration all kinds of people including friend's and family. They also have one of my favorite board games jenga which i really enjoyed playing here.¬†

Both during the day and night, this cafe is enjoyable.¬†
=====
What we ordered:

‚Ä¢ Brain Freezer Sheesha - It was really good. No problem at all. Smoky and lasted long.¬†
‚Ä¢ Teen Pan Sheesha - Same with this sheesha as well. I personally like teen paan a lot and its my old favorite. ‚úå
‚Ä¢ Veg Mozzarella Cheese Pizza - It was a thin crust pizza and was served smoky hot. It tasted really good and is a must try here. ‚úå

¬†=====
Meal for two: 350-780 max
=====
Pros:¬†

‚Ä¢ Excellent Ambiance
‚Ä¢ Chic Cafe
‚Ä¢ A cafe required in City of Joy
‚Ä¢ Good hospitality
‚Ä¢ Good Food

Expert Suggestions:
‚Ä¢ The staffs are a bit new and they sometimes don't come despite calling for few times. Nevertheless, i hope this will be improved with time.¬†
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 3.7/5
Food Presentation 3.7/5
Food Quantity 3.7/5
Value for money 3.5/5
Hospitality 3.7/5
Ambiance 3.9/5
=====
Conclusion:

I would love to revisit it again. I really had a great experience here. Taking from the a la carte to the ambiance to the food, everything is near to perfection.¬†

This new hot shot shisha lounge is located just few blocks from Quest Mall, on the rooftop of Gupta Brothers. An impeccable addition to the rare breed of rooftop lounges in this city.
Went there yesterday with my friends. We reached there in the afternoon and it seemed like any other ordinary caf√©. But just wait for the evening to set in. The floor lights and the beautiful lighten engravings on the bar cabinet excellently compliment the ambience in the evening and if there is a cool breeze wafting‚Ä¶bliss magnified. Apart from the outdoor area, there is also an adjacent private room for those wanting to avoid the sun ( with really comfy sofas :-P )

Not only the atmosphere, the food they provide is furthermore enticing.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Alfredo Pasta : It was exceptional. Probably the best item on their menu. The exact amount of spices and veggies paired with penne and smooth creamy sauce made the dish loveable.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Pizza Exotica : Not as exotic as expected. Loaded with vegetables though‚Ä¶ all kinds of. It was considerably pleasant but the variety of veggies which is its strong point is also a bit of a setback.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Mexican Wrap : Again, the delicacy was enjoyable. Nothing amusing to the taste buds, yet nice.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Chilly Mojito : This was suggested by the server. It is definitely a unique version of mojito but tends to hit you in the throat. I didn‚Äôt like it after few sips and had it returned. But it‚Äôs worth a try if you love an extra spice in your drink.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Virgin Mojito : It was nicely prepared. Not as good as some signature places but still was passable.
We also had Hot Chocolate, a Red Bull and Blueberry Shake.

‚òÖ Shisha : We had Citrus Blast. That is rasna, lemon and mint in ice base. Another amazing hookah with vibrant flavours and dense smoke. The density was even lasting.

The servers are pleasant. The floor manager is on his toes looking out for the needs of his customers. The service tends to be a little slow on weekends. They even have a number of board games available for you. And the best part, the prices go real easy on your pocket. Definitely one of the newest and finest cafes in town with a unique ambience.

Shack is located just in the lane beside the Bata showroom opposite Quest Mall. It is the rooftop cafe of the Gupta Brothers property which has "Shudh" too. One just should not go by the name that since Gupta Brothers is managing it so it would be not so good place. A quiet place to have hookah with few board games and marwari styled italian cuisine.. yes!! It does taste like that. However, the fact that the hookah is good (purely depends on what you order) is a big plus point. The food isn't bad but still they could have done a lot to it. A no-go for food lovers but a must-go-on for people who need to have hookah and a good conversation (since most other places won't give you that much needed peace to talk)..!

As there was no seesha place at Quest much gratitude to Zomato we were able to find out about this awesome place. Just at a distance of 4 minutes from Quest its placed at a great location . Kinda rooftop small shack kinda feeling. As it was so sunny outside we chose to sit in AC. We asked the waiter to make a strong seesha and two drinks were ordered 1. Orange cola float and 2. Chilli mojitto.
As the seesha came it was one of the best seeshas i had so far. So strong, balaced flavours and just amazing. Orange cola float was great to taste with a floating scoop of icecream. It tasted like it had curd inside but no amazing balance of flavours. And the topper becomes the chilli mojitto. I really don't understand the how to explain the flavour. It was generally kind of a sweet lime soda filled with green chillies. It gave a tang as well as a zing cause of those chillies. I would've given it a perfect five but their AC wasn't working properly and yhe room was becoming stuffed. However ambience was good loud music huge play station comfortable couches what more can you ask for... and the most important part it was pocket friendly. Anytime I'm going for seesha this place always would be on top.

This place is on the rooftop of Gupta Brothers outlet.  The ambience is nice and comfortable with both open air and closed sections and a balcony for smoking. The sitting outdoor is wooden chairs and tables and a cabana set-up with a huge projector display write up front and if that was not all a jacuzzi addition where you can sit, relax & chill. The closed section also features a PS4 with games likes 'fifa' and 'last of us' up for grabs. So a complete package of entertainment with delicious food and drinks to go with their perfect blend of smoky shishas.

Edit: - (The roof top open air lounge is a nice hookah place and enjoy an evening with friends. Visited during an Ipl match with a large screen set up in the roof top Cafe. Try the White Sauce ageo olio pasta, the Shack Lounge special pizza, Hot Chocolate, Frappe and Mexican Platter which they have on the food of the day. Another plus point is their speed service. Having a separate mocktail counter speeds up the service. I would like to point that the menu should involve a lot more variety of dishes. Overall the place is nicely structured and combines a Rajasthani dining and North Indian cuisine in the below levels of the dining building.) Another average cafe/lounge.
Plus point is the roof top seating arrangement.
The Xbox available is a nice addon. Food is good ( try the Indian cuisine in the ground floor ). Try the masala sweet corn. Good service is another plus point of this place.

Wow ambience!!!
Outdoor seating jus gains extra points.
Food is good .we ordered Pasta, mezze plater, garlic bread......etc all taste very good.
But, sad was the mojito. It tasted as a normal lime cordial. Inspite of returning twice it was the same. But along with it we ordered shakes which were good.

Hopeless place ... guess the expert reviews are paid . The coffee is useless. We were 6 of us and left the cold coffee as well as cappuccino as it was undrinkable. The falafel was served in their own style which was disappointing with only 2 dips. Pizzas were edible. Will not come again or recommend this place. Avoid it. Just got the bill where they charged for the ice cream in cold coffee separately. Not to forget 10% service charge !!!

Rooftop and hookah are your forever perfect combination. Getting it right however is a tricky affair and The Shack Lounge bears no exception to this rule.

Located opposite the hustle bustle of Quest Mall (Lane opposite Khosla Electronics facing the Bata showroom), the ambience is guaranteed to make you fall in love. Perfect use of blue and white lights beneath the tables, cane and wooden furniture, mini fountains in the background, soothing music- all reeks perfection. I guess the cold weather works as a catalyst here to enjoy this place and I only wonder how they'd manage during those hot, sweaty summer months.

Coming to their food and hookah. A vegetarians delight like most hookah joints in the city so these guys played it safe as well. From pastas, pizzas, salads, Waffles, pancakes, Thai, Lebanese- they have it all.

We tried the Mushroom and Cheese sandwich and Garlic Bread. The sandwich was very well grilled and still retained the softness of the bread and the flavours of mushrooms and Cheese intact. The Garlic bread doesn't disappoint you in taste either. However serving the same with falafel dips in small portion size devoid of presentation was disappointing and is something these guys need to work on.

The beverages were spot on especially the hot chocolate. Mild sweetness with punch of cocoa is the perfect anecdote for a cold winter evening. The lemon ice tea was a bit of a surprise there having a hint of white salt as an after taste.

The hookah menu spoils you thoroughly. I choose the "As You Like It" option and conjured up the combinations but you could try anything from their vast selection be it blueberry or cigar. The mixing is smooth and devoid of any choking.

The service was par excellence and the manager ensuring every table generates verbal feedback.

All in all, my affair with this place has only started.

The Sheesha served here is above par.
Pizza tastes quite well.
But starters served are very low in quantity. They should work on it to improve.

Location - This lounge is located to the opposite lane of Quest Mall, at the third floor of the Gupta brothers building. The ambiance is absolutely stunning and worth complimenting. Though we have visited during the day time the entire set up looked clean and tidy. The music was sober too.

Staff Management - Servers were courteous and well behaved.¬†

Food - We ordered their sheesha of gum flavored, margheritta pizza and alfredo pasta. The pizza had thin crust base and tasted good. The pasta was quite a lot in amount and was standard. Sheesha was good too.

Pocket-pinch - Reasonable.
