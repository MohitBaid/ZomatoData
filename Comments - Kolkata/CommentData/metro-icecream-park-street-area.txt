Cheap and edible ice cream on Park street. Variety of flavours to choose from. Cones and cups both available at the shop. Being on such a posh area, these guys serve ice cream at the cheapest possible rates.

It is a small outlet that serves ice cream at pocket friendly prices. Location is quite perfect to grab your attention. It offers variety of ice cream. I personally like the mango flavour.

I really like Metro's ice creams much better than kwality walls. 
At this stall they have a nolen gur flavoured ice cream which tastes really good and it's inexpensive too. 
This place is nothing fancy so please dont expect to be overwhelmed by it. Its a simple ice cream stall.

Overall a good experience here. Had a chocolate ice cream, and another two in one ice cream. Wasn't disappointed with the quality, but the staff was unprofessional. Need improvements in the staff, that's the reason the rating goes down.

This ice cream parlour is located at Park Street which serves icecream at lesser price.
Quality is fine but there are far better options in Kolkata.
Went there with a friend but found many flavours were not available .
Like their kesar pista, yum aam icecream.
Service is quick.

Visited here yesterday to have ice cream with my few friends. We asked for the flavors of our likings but was surprised that most of them were missing. Well we then asked from among the one they had. We took 4 ice creams. At that point the person in the store said he wouldn't give us single scoop, we have to take double scoop if we need ice cream. Beside that, the person also behaved unprofessionally in rude manner. He said me 'i can give only double scoop, if you want to take then take or leave'.
I guess for a store to be set up at Park Street type area the staff must be trained to behave well before allowing him to seat in the store. Totally disappointing to get such behavior.

Metro is my most favourite brand of ice cream . We were having a long food walk type of thing in park street yesterday and visited this small kiosk for the first time. Service was good. We had vanilla and butterscotch scoops. They tasted yummy as usual. No other brand can beat the taste of metro ice creams. They are the best :'-)

Had a tooth extraction in the morning so under doctor's advice, walked down to have a ice cream lunch !!!

Taste & price were OKAY!!! Many flavours were not available - even the most common of all - 'Vanilla' got over by 1:00 pm!!!

'Mango' scoop tasted somewhat bitter at times - don't know why!!!

'Butter Scotch' was Ok.

This shop is located at Park Street and sells ice cream.
I like the cone m that basically is a cornetto. It costs ‚Çπ20 which is a bargain.
But the downside is that there are no new flavours available here. The ones that you get here are also available everywhere else. Addition of different sundaes and ice cream shakes would be good.

A decent place for economical icecream. I absolutely love their new renovated look. Metro ice cream has been in the city's ice cream picture ever since Tulikas and has created a good name.
Their items are good and seem fresh always.
Absolutely love their staple chocolate, their M bar, and yum aam. They used to have this flavour which was rum based and I used to love that as well.
The sundaes here are basic with sauces and ice cream scoops.
Though I wish they change their cones to the tastier waffle ones with sprinkles ( at present it is only the orange cone and basic waffle)

Good place to grab a cone and hop along in the busy streets of Park Street!

Pocket friendly destination for ice cream lovers. Located on the streets of Park street this shop offers Metro ice cream in their menu. Cheap and best in that price. I always liked their Vanilla and butterscotch ice cream specially and the products are very standard and tasty as well. Recommended if you are not in a mood for facy desserts or do not want to spend much.

A cheap and popular option to satisfy your desert cravings, Metro Ice Cream is mostly known for using a better quality milk in their preparations. A small kiosk with absolutely no sitting options, you can get scoops at economical prices without having to spend 150-200 bucks at an expensive restaurant. My most liked flavor for Metro Ice Cream is Kesar Pista. Silky, smooth and creamy, it simply melts in your mouth! Do look out for this place if you want to have some icecream. :-)

After Kwality Walls and Baskin Robbins this dessert kiosk of Metro Dairy ice cream is probably my most visited place. Right from bars to party packs to scoops in cones and cups, I've tasted almost all their available flavours like choco chips, strawberry, vanilla, butterscotch, black currant, two-in-one and Yum Aam. Milky, sweet and creamy to taste, these dairy-fresh ice creams fulfill the needs of a resident of a metro city who is in love with ice creams during summer.

My friend urged me to have a scoop or two at this place while we were strolling at Park Street, watching Christmas celebrations. A small ice cream outlet selling Metro scoops at reasonable prices. No seating arrangements are available considering the place is small - which is ok. Variety and availability of ice creams is ok.¬†
Thereafter, we were lost in the huge sea of customer simply fighting to get their scoops - which is quite understandable as it's the festive season. After a waiting of 12-14 minutes, finally, someone decided to hear what we wanted. We went for chocolate ice cream in cone - very reasonable priced @ Rs. 20 each considering this place is based in the heart of ¬†Park Street.
What turned off our moods was the owner (an aged person) insisted that we pay change although we could clearly see the cashier simply counting away loads of change. At one point, we simple decided to walk away, but after continued and repeated requests by my friend, they finally agreed. Ice cream was too tasty and the cone crunchy and that's the main reason, I am not rating this place low!

It really hurts me to have ice-creams in all those posh restaurants. it costs 100-250rs for a scoop or two. So whenever i crave for ice-cream after a meal or anytime during the day i just stop by this shop n have whatever pleases me. I love Metro ice-cream more than anything. To me quality wise, they r the best in town. And very affordable. My regular is mango with black current. The man at the counter is very co-operative!
