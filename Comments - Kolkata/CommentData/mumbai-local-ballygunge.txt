It was my first visit here today..when I entered the place.. it gaves me the real local vibes.. the place is really good...easy to locate.. it's near ministry of external affairs.. I must say Sanjay and rajib .. they gives us really good service.. they help us to decide our menu according to our moods.. I definitely want to recommend this place to all the food lovers.. their foods are really yum.. guys do visit this place once.. trust me this one is a sure shot visit place... What I like the most is their welcome dessert ... If any of you loves kitty party.. then you can also go with your group they really do well for this too.. in the pics the dessert name is haila and drink is queens necklace punch.  Which is basically made of watermelon.. and third one is welcome dessert.. which was complementary.. they didn't charged for thisüòÇüòÇ

The experience at Mumbai Global was truly amazing. Hailing from Mumbai, it was nostalgic to have "Mumbaiyya" food in Kolkata. Abinash was super courteous and welcoming. His pleasant and welcoming personality was a cheery on the cake. Knowing I was from Mumbai, he was kidnapped enough to offer me a welcome pastry.

The ambience with "Tapori Mumbai" language on the walls and local train feel is great. I would recommend to anyone who's longing for an authentic Mumbai food.

My recommendation: Pav Bhaji, Misal Pao (only if you like in Mumbai), and Pani Puri.

Been to this place recently after going through the reviews and Zomato rating. Really disappointed with the food quality and I fail to understand how people have given these kind of reviews. Decor is ordinary & food quality is horrible. Either their food quality was never good or it has deteriorated drastically.

I visited Mumbai Local during the Durga Puja festival week after reading some really positive reviews on Zomaot and its close proximity to my place. It was supposedly a celebratory dinner for my Aunt's birthday but it got spoiled with the experience we had there. We had to sit for more than 2 hours to get our food and drinks. It was not just us, we could hear a sense of disappointment¬†and unrest from other tables as well. Also, it would have made sense if the place was filled with people and that is why there was some difficulty managing lots of orders, but the tables were barely occupied. We had to repeatedly ask the staff to bring us our food, and every time they failed to honor their promises.¬† On top of that, we DID NOT GET OUR BILL! They blamed it on a system error and promised to send it via email but it never arrived. Although one should never pay without getting a bill, it was my goodwill that I trusted your management's word but again, they failed to honor what they were expected to deliver.¬†

Coming to the food, everything was just okay. Maybe because of the time we had to wait between ordering and eating all the excitement and hunger bubbled out of our systems and the food did not taste as it was supposed to be. It became so irritating that, there was one moment that we thought of leaving without having our food. The menu looked interesting on paper but on taste, it was as normal as other restaurants. One thing I liked about Mumbai Local was the provision for having food prepared in Jain style. This is a good option for many people who keep fasts during Navratra etc.

I do not know if such an experience reoccurs with other people or not but this is what I went through on my only visit there. I would encourage the management to please take this feedback seriously and work towards making the experience at Mumbai Local better :)

Amazing presentation of food. Ambience is Mumbai based with lots of quotes and Mumbai local train. The only problem I had with the place was the slow service.. it took the stewards 10 mins to give the bill. It's a bit on the expensive side as it's a casual dining restaurant. 
Had vada paw, paw bhaji , hakka noodles with a couple of drinks.. there is no compromise on Food and if you are a foodie, this is a place to visit..

This place got a quirky decor. Vibrant colors and funny quotes go well with the theme of this restaurant. Hospitality is also good, so are the food, though the prices are on the higher side. We ordered for "bhaji pav mastani" and "dhobi ghat chana batora". Both were served in an innovative way, which is definitely a big plus. Both tasted well, too. For dessert, we ordered "mudh island"; this too came with a lovely plating. This is basically a crumbled brownie with vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce, mixed together by the server in front of the diners and nice in taste. So, together it was a nice experience and I would love to give a rating of four. However, initially we asked for an item named "khari pe mushroom bhaari", but the server informed us the item to be an average one. Next we asked for a mocktail "wolf of dalal street", for which the server explained the same. Upon insisting to get the drink, the server finally revealed the fact "the unavailability of the item". We quite understood the situation; however, we would prefer the honesty at the first go. On the other way, is not it really awkward for a restaurant to keep a few items on the menu card which are described to diners as so-so/average?

Nice place to hang out for food lovers with a twist. Also amazing assortment of vegetarian variety is being offered. Starters are well innovative presented and North Indian and Chinese cuisine is available too. Quantity of the veg in North Indian is also good. Taste of each item is authentic and served hot. The platter in starters is also tasty and has good variety. The only this missing i found was mouth freshener was not provided or even available when requested. The staff was prompt and courteous. It has upstairs seating as well and parking too is available.

The drinks are served with the an extravagance presentation.  Overall it's a culinary treat and this place Will treat your taste buds exactly the way,  they should be treated with.  Bill was around 2200 for 5 adults.  Portions are good.  Just one suggestion,  please introduce some more desserts in your menu so that you guys can claim yo host a Culinary Extravaganza!

The food presentation was startling and it tasted really good. Very few restaurants in Kolkata have such amazing food presentation. For the dessert we had ordered Mudh Island and it was fabulous (a must try). 
We were entertained by Abinash and Sanjay and they were courteous. We also got a complementary dessert and ice lollies (which reminded me of my childhood).
Overall it was a great experience and I would highly recommend this place!!

Amazing food. Excellent service. Great ambience. That's the synopsis of my experience at Mumbai Local. The taste of mumbai street foods well balanced to not make it too spicy presented in very uniquely thought ways gives the food here their personality. Had panipuri, papad platter with dips, missal rasa pao, madh island for dessert, kala khatta gola, queen's necklace punch, cutting iced tea and lights camera action for drinks. All of these were excellent in taste and quantity. To top it all Mr. Abinash who was serving us surprised us with a very tasty chocolate cake, and strawberry golas. Thanks a lot to Mr. Abinash for the excellent service and the great conversation.

Food- Top notch. We ordered Chotte Miya's Paneer Tikka and Dhobi Ghaat Chana Bhatura in the starters. The Paneer was very well cooked and the green chutney with it tasted really good. The presentation of Chana Bhatura was amazing. The Chanas were very tasty. In the main course, we ordered Dal Makhani and Malai Kofta. They were delicious. Even, the Garlic Naan and Tandoori Roti were fresh and nice. The drinks are good too. The quantity of food is okay. We couldn't eat the desserts as we were already full, but the staff still offered us complimentary popsicles, and who says no to popsicles, that too free!! The kala khatta flavor was amazing. Must try.

Service- Best service I have ever experienced. The staffs are very courteous and cooperative. They are literally there on their toes to serve you. I am not exaggerating. They are very polite and they listen to your instructions very keenly. Even, the security guard is very helpful and polite. He helped us in finding our car. Very sweet guy.

A BIG Thumbs Up to Mumbai Local for their delicious food and amazing service.

Ambiance- Talking about ambiance, it is good but it is a small place. They have two floors, the upper one is half the size of the lower one. The lower one is approximately the size of an ideal room or slightly bigger. The paintings are good and photogenic. The ambiance overall is good.¬†

I seriously recommend each and every person to visit this place. It will not disappoint you in terms of food and service. For some people, the size of the place may not be satisfying, but once you start eating your food, who cares about the size of the place?? It's definitely worth giving it a try.

P.S. Although, I did not order the Vada Pao, but I have heard that it is really good. You can try that too.

Looking forward to a beautiful Lunch or Dinner?
Mumbai Local is your destination.
Things to look forward to:
‚Ä¢ Food is pleasing to eyes and Palate both.
‚Ä¢ Lively Ambience.
‚Ä¢ Friendly Service.

Things I tried:

‚Ä¢ Kebab Platter - Quantity in Comparison to other Restaurants is relatively less in my opinion although you won't have to compromise in taste. It's delicious!
‚Ä¢ Dhobi Ghaat Chole Bhature- The way it is presented you won't stop staring! Right amount of spices make it a must try for taste buds. (Picture attached along!)
‚Ä¢ American Chopsuey- The only dish we tried that was a bit disappointing.
‚Ä¢ Madh Island- Delicious way to end your lunch/dinner in the beautifully lit up restaurant.

A thumbs up for this one, worth the money they charge!

I am writing this review while waiting for a glass of water I asked for around 15 minutes ago. That should tell you all you need to know about the service at this restaurant.

Never before has a three course meal taken 2 hours, from 9:20 to right now, at 11:40.

Now don't get me wrong- the food is excellent, the d√©cor fascinating and the presentation is at a level of creativity that exceeds all expectations.

The problem lies in the lack of manpower. A couple of poor waiters seem to have been left in charge of the bustling restaurant - a bad idea, as evidenced by the 20 or so minutes that we waited for iced tea (it came in a cute kettle and all but still. No iced tea should ever take that long.)

Even when the food did come, it was simply plonked on the table for the customer to serve themselves. And all this would have been fine on other day had the room (and our temperaments) not been as hot as it was. Despite the restaurant being at full capacity, they had deemed it fit to switch on no more than half the ACs in the restaurant. It was only after my mother commented that we ought to pay the non-AC GST that the management chose to rescue us from our sweltering state of misery.

Although the restaurant has an interesting menu (including one featuring food sans onion and garlic), there was nothing so special as to warrant a second visit.

My water is now at my table. And it is with relief that I take take a gulp of the cold elixir and end this review.

Goodbye Mumbai Local, I doubt we'll meet again.

Food: 4/5

Ambience: 4/5

Service: 1/5

The staff was polite,good and very helpful.  I went to Mumbai Local with my family and 2 children who are of 7 months so seeing two small kids they made special arrangement so that we didn't have any problem. They helped us in whatever way they could.  
The service was great and they had speedy service. 
The food was Yum! 
The environment ,decor and ambience was too good. 
We went for dinner to Mumbai Local, being my birthday a staff overheard it while serving food when one of my family member wished me. As we went their on my birthday the staffs of Mumbai Local also tried to celebrate and be a part of my special day so they brought in a cake for me. 
We have visited many restaurants till date but I have never seen such support from staffs of other restaurants.  I thank them. 
The prices are also affordable. 
 My experience was Excellent.  And I really wish to keep on visiting Mumbai Local.

Went there on a rainy day for their madh island, though I don't review food or restaurants but Avinash made it an experience that made it worth raving about. 

The ambience takes on the nostalgia of the 60s and 70s Mumbai.
 
The food : I ordered the madh island their picture pretty dessert and it was really consistent with the images showcased here ( which is how I choose my food). Avinash helped me mix it in a ratio that tasted among the likes of the best of brownies and ice cream I have had( I have had a lot).
After I finished devouring my island, they even gave me a couple complimentary popsicles which thankfully they did or I would've missed a really delicious and nostalgic thing. (Remember the red street Pepsi sold in plastic tubes).
Thank you for that, I will definitely visit them again along with friends or family.

And finally as it is an important criteria for many of us while choosing a place to eat. The food here is definitely insta worthy üòâüòâ.
üéâHere's to hoping you have a good time here as much as I did.
Bon appetit

Mumbai Local boasts one of the most unique decors among all restaurants in Kolkata, with its all encompassing skylight and color palate separating it from the pack. The walls have quirky Bollywood graffiti, the seats are spaced out and the lighting is warm. A rather beautiful place to have a quick bite, this.¬†

Unfortunately my somewhat mediocre rating stems from the fact that half of their items were not available on our day of visit. We had gone at around 3 in the evening only to be informed that none of the tandoor dishes nor the dosas could be served. Pretty disappointed by this, we settled for just a couple of drinks and a bhaji pav.¬†

The presentation of the 'bhaji pav mastaani' is delightful. The symmetrically cut buttered loaf, bhaji in a jar and the rest of the condiments set in a wooden tray is sure to evoke at the very least a squeal of happiness from all but the most pragmatic of their patrons. The smoky bhaji made for a great pairing with the richly buttered bread load.¬†

The two drinks : 'Raspberry rapchik' (a mostly ordinary raspberry flavored soda based beverage) and the 'Chowpatty gola' are a study is diversity. I will most definitely recommend the later, a very refreshing take on the traditional 'gola' (a lump of crushed ice, if you will) topped with litchi and kaffir lime flavor.

It's been quite a long time since I have rated a restaurant 5/5. There's a reason for that. Mumbai local, a tiny food joint with casual bar scene nestled among the posh Ballygunge apartments. The main reason, I decided to travel 12 kms to a restaurant was its whacky, one of a kind menu.
The simple twists on the Mumbai classics, elevating these items to a level of sophistication was brilliant. Must tries include a nice smack in your face Sharabi Pani puri with a generous amount of vodka, the classic vada pav served with a tangy tamarind chutney, a fresh and vibrant pudina chutney and the tentalizing podi (for the novice south Indian :https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idli_podi)
For the main course do try the Parsi Dhansak. For the alcohol- redbull enthusiasts there is a deadly concoction called AATA MHAJI SATAKLI.
All in all the place does remind you of the vibrancy and deliciousness of the Mumbai street food with a decor to match the food.
ADD THIS TO YOUR BUCKET LIST TODAY!

The ambiance and the interior is very much created to give a feel of Mumbai and highlighted Bollywood. You will find all age group coming here to gather with the lovely songs playing behind . The food presentation is creative and innovative . The service is on mark . Henceforth, In short if you wana enjoy a nice crispy evening or night over some cocktails or mock tails and some nice veggie snack or course ,it's a must visit .

3.the ambience was pretty nice
4.food was served quickly
5.The desserts were pretty amazing
Some improvements can be made like they should increase the food quantity and make this place a bit more pocket-friendly.
If you love Maggi then you should surely come here and have the Maggi dosa.

The ambience is very good and is good for an elegant dining experience. The best thing apart the meal is its presentation..! Food is just wow to the taste...have no words to express..! The Only Con which I can make out is the billing system. Post GST implementation, No Service Tax/Charge is leviable, hence you can deny ! 
Apart from that, i would wish to visit more often !

We ordered RAAPCHIK RAASBERRY -and as the name suggest *RAAPCHIK* it was.. served in a cute lil banta bottle.. then another drink called LIGHTS CAMERA ACTION - Its nothing but masala cola served in a mug that looks like a camera lens.. and then comes the specialty DHOBHI GHAAT CHANNA BHATURA -It Tasted as good as their AMAZING presentation.*Only Complain* - We ordered *Bawaji Ka Thullu* - Popsicles that we used to have in our school days. The waiter suggested us not to order saying * Ma'am its a complimentary thing.. You will get it anyways*.. But sadly enough we just got nothing except the bill :P But then its okay.. we will definitely go and try it next time :)Service - Super Friendly Staff.. Full points :) ¬†
Do try this MAST place ;)

Just returned from d lovely xperience of lunching at mumbai local...nestled in amongst d bungalows and highrises of d posh ballygunge park road this quaint little eatery is definitely worth a visit..the decor is a replica of a compartmnt of a mumbai local without its bustling passengers...d food is vegetarian but each item is presented in a special way...d waiters are xtremely polite and swift...(we were served by Abinash ...a rather sweet boy with a smile that never fades...he made us feel so important)and u wind up by being served d flavoured ice tubes that take u back to ur childhood...do make it a point to visit Mumbai local...

- Staff was polite and ever smiling
- Presentation was adequate

Food:
1 Dahi kebab and alu starter lived up to expectations. Curd accompaniment was thick and tasty
2 Litchi gola was tasty
3 Dhobhi Ghat Chole Bhature was good, but not as shown in the actual picture. The bhature should not touch the grass and the chole should be in a bucket for it to live up to its name. But nevertheless it tasted alright.
4 Pani Puri was tangy¬† and a must try, The flavors were niche.
5 DIY papad was a novel concept. 
6 Vegetable Jhalfezei and Alu Do pyaza did taste nice
7 Yellow Dal was thick and non spicy
8 Black Dal was creamy
9 Mango drink was thick and flavorful
10 A drink called Ganga Jamuna is worth a try

What we missed 
1 Mumbai sandwich - was unavailable
2 Onion Rings (the photograph makes it look like a tree with branches) - unavailable
3 Dosa - unavailable

However the staff was very polite and asked us if we would like some pasta etc since the items above were unavailable. As a goodwill gesture for making up for the unavailability of the sandwich for the kids the staff offered them a pastry each which brought back smiles on their faces.

Some restaurants just serve food. Others make sure that you are pampered with their hospitality. Mumbai local is the latter kind. 

It is a must try for lovers of vegetarian food. Keep up the good work.

The one drawback is that i was given to understand that the bread is sourced from Gabbar which is a non vegetarian restaurant. Why? And more than half the items on the menu are not available. For example Dabeli, because the bread was apparently on the way from Gabbar. Also please convert your ragda dish to a DIY, the peas mash and the cutlet together are visually unappealing to the palette.

Will keep it short and sweet. This place is quirky and a delight to visit. Presentation of food is on point. Really nice selection of food items. The steamed mushroom momos were delish. Drinks were nice and unique. The star was the dessert...We ordered madh island. Served in a plate that looked like the bark of a tree....Ice cream mixed with brownies and chocolate. What more does one want....Amazing amazing deseert. 
Ended the meal with complimentary pan flavoured cotton candies.

service is very good, but some of the items like papad and panipuri are very costly compared to the dish but one must say that they are presented very well, like chola bhatura seems small portion of small puris instead of thick and oily bhatura which is the original dish, but they score highly on the nice presentation

A very bright place, so its better you go for lunch to enjoy the accurate representation of the life of a Mumbaikar as well as the quirky slangs used by one.Coming to the food, we weren't offered the Nava menu, so couldn't feast on their new delicacies, However, we had ordered Malai Kofta, Jhaalfarezi, Malabari Parantha and Masala kulcha and everything turned out so good, except the Malabari parantha, had better expectations from it.¬†But then again, the place is absolutely wow for family luncheon with very polite staff and not to forget, the value for money they provide.

Bhaji pao mastani which had given brush to butter the bread.

This was my second visit to the place along with my foodie friends and I knew what to expect. I love their food. Rustam favourite dhansak
, Berry na pulao, Breach candy awesome okras and Madh island
 have been some of my favorite dishes. But the Kebab Platter 
blew me away on this visit! One of the best dahi kebabs I have had so far accompanied with some amazing broccoli and paneer kebabs.

Their presentation is really cute with the bhaturas hung out to dry over a grassy platform, the rake and shovel they give with the madh island and the newly launched Mango Bath
.¬†

It was great to see some of my hardcore non-veg friends enjoying a lovely veg meal without it being all about the ghas-phoos. It is a great place to hang out with family and friends with some quirky decor.

I had come here for my anniversary dinner. We had a table with flower decor booked through Outbox.

On arrival we were greeted with a warm smile by the manager and taken to the 1st floor where we noticed that the entire 1st floor had specially been kept free for us. Also, the decorations on the table done by Outbox was outstanding. 

We had ordered a dhai kabab and chole bature for starters which was good to look as much as it was to eat. Along with which we had ordered a lomg island ice tea also. For the main course we had ordered a black dal, alu do pyaza, garlic naan and a tandoori roti, all of which were delicious. 

A special note to Sanjay who was waiting on us that evening. He was one of the most courteous waiter every seen by me. He even served us a complementary cake on a tray which was decorated with chocolate sauce replicating a mehendi design which was awesome.

This proved to be one of the most memoriable dinmer experiences I had.

Thank You Mumbai Local and Outbox

Hello Mumbai üòÄ the name itself potrays a vivid picture of the restaurant so no intro is needed.the restaurant is based on street food of Mumbai like  pav bhaji fuchka etc.though there is not much speciality with their items but the main attraction lies on their idea of serving them in diff ways which is quite innovative.it's a theme based restaurant the wall s seem to be like we are in mumbai's local train.staffs are friendly.in dessert we had mud island which is nothing but a brownie served in a diff way.

Today I decided to treat my friend, Subhendu Roy, at this newly opened place called Mumbai Local. The location of the restaurant is quite easy to find. We loved the decor and the polite and friendly staff who ensured that we have a rewarding experience. The food was a revelation, especially to a hardcore non vegetarian like me. We ordered the@ most recommended dishes because I didn't want to experiment much. 
Dhobi Ghat- traditional chana bhatura with a twist. Highly recommended because the chana was cooked to perfection. 
Kebab platter - if you think that veg kebabs are no good surely give this one a try, your perception will definitely change. 
Berry nu pulao & Breach candy awesome okras- Pulao with dried berries and crispy okra in onion curry, excellent combination. Give it a try. 
Hai la! - keeping this one a surprise. Chocolate lovers will swear by it. 
We were served by Mr. Prashanta who was very courteous. Overall the experience was wonderful. Would love to return. 
P. S. Do ask for Bawaji ka thullu

Situated on a quaint Ballygunge Park Road Mumbai Local takes you to Mumbai and what a journey it is ! Went in on a Thursday and it was full by 0830PM. Would recommend you to make your booking in advance to avoid wait times .
Coming to the food , we had Mojito and Dahi Seekh Kebabs as starters . The Kebabs were succulent and Mayo Dip was flavoursome. Mint used for Mojito was not fresh but the drink was Okay none the less. 
For main course we had Dhobi Ghaat ke Chane Bhature and Paav Bhaji.  The presentation of Chane Bhature would surely elicit a chuckle out of you and the tables nearby and flavor would bring out a satisfied sigh.  Bhaaji was tangy , fresh and a hint of Garlic would surely remind you of authentic Mumbaiya Tang.  The dessert Menu is minimalistic in-line with the theme of the restaurant , few great dishes instead of the regular 20 page Menus with half of them unavailable and devoid of flavour . Had the Mudh@ Island which is Brownie with Hot Chocolate and Ice Cream . See it to be wowed by the presentation again.  
Definitely recommend .
P.S : Staff serves you with a smile and is very helpful .

This was our first visit and the place lived up to it's name. If you want to try something different do come here, and as a vegan it was a plus point that it's a vegetarian restaurant. We tried the dahi sheek kebab which was different and delicious. The next was misal masala which was really good considering that the gravy was made of sprouts.
The experience was good and the staff were really polite specially Mr. Avinash. A must try!

I have been hearing a lot about this place from friends and also saw a good rating on Zomato so decided to check it out.
 I must mention at the outset that place will create a big hole in your pocket since the rates are wayyy too high for the type of dishes. A plate of Dabeli, costing 10/- a piece on Mumbai road side if crosses Rs.300/-, it makes Dabeli a part of Luxury Dine In ;p

Location and Parking:

______________

It
s in the heart of the city, located in Ballygunj. Google map will easily direct you there but they do have not have parking facility and you are not authorized to park anywhere in the lane too.

Ambiance and decorations:

_____________________________

Very Chic, creative and surely give you a feel of Mumbai. Seating is less but since we went late hours, we got a seat. 

Now coming to food:

They have a limited range of menu, but taste of some dishes is very good. The presentation is very unique and very creative. We tried their Mumbaiya items only.

‚úì Chole Bhature: Winning dish from the order. Presentation as well as the taste wise. Being a North Indian I have always craved for good chole in Kolkat
a and this dish did total justice to the taste.
‚úì Dabeli : The dabeli missed the original flavor of this Maharastrian road side taste. Could not find any peanuts which is the main ingredient of Dabeli masala.

‚úì Missal Pav : This was a complete disaster. No where near what missal tastes like. It was not made with authentic matki used in Missal. Plus misal is served with farsan, onions and lemon. All missing from the dish.¬†
‚úì Pav Bhaji : This was decently good. Nothing special but nothing bad.¬†

Dessert:

_____________

Madh Island - Delicious and all Chocolate lovers will love this.

So as I said earlier, its a good place if you like Mumbaiya food but also have a lot of money in your pocket to spend. To sum it up in one line - Its eating Street Food in Fine Dine in rates!!

After racking our brains for a good 15 minutes,we headed towards Mumbai Local for a Friday dinner. From the moment you stand in front of the entrance, you can feel Mumbai. Prominent places of Bombay are mentioned on the entrance wall. We reached around 9.15PM and got our seats immediately. 

The ambience complimented the name entierely. Local train with people trying to stuff in, famous dialogues like Hawa Aane de, Katt le and the like. My favourite line was "Darr ke aage jeet hai, Dadar ke aage seat hai". This line instantly cracked me up. Local train grab handles were attached to the ceiling. 

We tried:
1. Queen's Necklace - This was a refreshing chilled mocktail with watermelon and basil

2. Sharaabi Pani Puri - Two cute bottles with the tag "Thirst Aid"  was given along with the masala filled puris. One had mint vodka mix pani and the other tamarind vodka pani. This was average. 

3. Dhobhi Ghaat Chana Bhatura - 4 Puris attached to the rope with the help of cloth pegs did make it look like Dhobi Ghaat. The chole and bhature tasted fine. 

4. Misal Pav - Generally the chiwda is topped on the misal. But here, it was all mixed together making it to soggy. Did not like the taste of it as well. 

5. Mamaji's Grill Sandwis - Loaded with veggies (potato, tomato and onion), cheese and coriander chutney, making it one of our favourite from the night. 

6. Chotte Miya's Paneer Tikka - Listed as a jhakaas item on their menu, and it sure was. It was hot, spicy, marinated with pickle masala. One of the best paneer tikkas I've tasted in a long time. 

7. Multi Grain Khichdi - I know Khichdi sounds boring but this was good. It was served along with carrot and radish salad, papad, jaggery, ghee, pickle and crispy fried guar ki phalli (cluster beans).

8. Madh Island - By default we had to order this as there was no other dessert available. It was crumbled brownie served with thick chocolate sauce and vanilla icecream. 

The major disappointment was there was nothing available from the Khao Gali Dosa and also we wanted to try other dessert but only Madh Island was available. 

The bill came up to Rs. 4500 for 6 people. 

 Oh and by the way we got free beers!! Also, we got a chance to reminisce our good old days as they gave Bawaji ka Thulli (Chuski) as complimentary. Chuski was given in two flavours - Mango and Kala Khatta.

The presentation of every dish is class apart and this is Mumbai Local's USP. If you love beautiful presentation on your plate, do try this place.

I have been hearing a lot about this place from friends and also saw a good rating on Zomato so decided to check it out.
 I must mention at the outset that place will create a big hole in your pocket since the rates are wayyy too high for the type of dishes. A plate of Dabeli, costing 10/- a piece on Mumbai road side if crosses Rs.300/-, it makes Dabeli a part of Luxury Dine In ;p

Location and Parking:

______________

It
s in the heart of the city, located in Ballygunj. Google map will easily direct you there but they do have not have parking facility and you are not authorized to park anywhere in the lane too.

Ambiance and decorations:

_____________________________

Very Chic, creative and surely give you a feel of Mumbai. Seating is less but since we went late hours, we got a seat.

The theme of this restaurant is what was intriguing and so were the interiors, so after looking it up on Zomato we came to 'Mumbai Local'. It's located in Ballygunge Park road near Ice Skating Rink. The interiors, especially the lightings give a rustic look to it which I loved. Me and my friends ordered
1. Chowpatty panipuri
2. Dhobi ghaat chana bhatura
3. Mumbai Shikanjavi
4. Chowpatty gola
5. Dabeli (A gujju dish)
6. Hai la!
The presentation of all these dishes were spot on and so was the taste. The quantity was adequate and it sufficed the three of us. The menu is a little overpriced which I guess is justified. The most appealing of all was 'Hai la!', a new addition to their menu. It's a chocolate sphere filled with chocolate mousse with a side of hot chocolate to pour over and melt the sphere. It tasted as good as we thought it would. A lip smacking dessert to end our day with.
Being a vegetarian restaurant it offers you a good deal which you'll love even if you're a non-vegetarian.

Thought of some Street Food, end up with this Fab restraunt situated in mid of societies. Looked nice from outside and inside was also themed with mumbai's local train on wall & other fine devoratives.

Manager or owner and the staff Sanjeev was very nice, cooperative and were continuously asking for any faults in food which will be hardky seen in any restaurant except the big ones.

In food, starters like Baby Corn, Chilli Potato, Misal pao were the best and awesome. In Indian Foods, Chese Onion kulcha were tasteless, tandoori and roti were as usual. Rest Veggies were also fine including Dal Makhani.

At last we were given Complimentary dessert for reviewing restaurant.

I am one of those people, who is not really fond of veg food. And also I feel that most restaurants who do quirky plating , forget the ethos of good flavor. But this place proved me wrong. Absolutely stunned by the lovely food. The service, and the warmth of the staff was top notch.

The taste of the Chhole is excellent. Presented of a green turf with the bhatoora on clothes pegs, it is fun to watch.

And the kebab platter is a must try. The paneer tikka is delicious, the broccoli is cooked to perfection and the dahi kebab is lovely too. Best paw bhaji I've had in a long time, even the smell can make your mouth water. And the truffle dosa is brilliant!

Do keep up the good work. The details kept in mind with the decor are absolutely stunning!

Kudos!

Aamchi Mumbai chi Mumbai Local in Kolkata! Mumbai Local brings the entire Mumbaiya feel out here in Kolkata. Being a Mumbaikar myself for the last 4 years, I can very well understand the feeling of being at Mumbai Local. The decor, the ambience, the lighting everything makes you feel as if you are travelling in a local train in Mumbai through the city lines, the Marine Drive, the Bandra-Worli Sea Link and each and every Mumbai speciality. 

I was invited here for a food tasting session and it went good enough counting on the large number of dishes that were served. They serve only Vegetarian food, however, a non-veg person wouldnot miss the non veg food much owing to the variety and quality of the food items served. Every item has been named accordingly and all of them taste good enough. 

I would suggest Mumbai Local is a place to try for. And, if you love Mumbai, you must be here. I am going back to this place whenever I miss Mumbai and the Mumbai-touch to the food dishes!!

The d√©cor is what pulls your attention first. Food quality is upto the mark , if not exceptional. The staff members were a little overtly polite and that got a little irksome. But there's no harm in giving it a try.

Mumbai local..the restaurant everyone one should go to. you enter the restaurant and are enthralled by the ambience..the marine drive,the local train and  Mumbai's  special quotes!! The presentation of the drinks and  the food is worth admiring..the food was delicious and specially the desserts üòç!!
One of the most important part of a restaurant is its service and like the other things, it was excellent. We had a guy named sanjay who made our experience in this restaurant a memorable one. With a smiling face and full of joy, sanjay made us feel comfortable..we will definitely revisit this restaurant!!

Very nice place. I took my mother to Mumbai Local for Mother's Day lunch. Prior to our visit I have requested the restaurant manager to prepare a small eggless cake. I wanted to surprise my mother. Though they didn't have eggless cake on the menu they prepared a delicious eggless cake and it was on the house as well. This was a brilliant gesture. Now coming to the food. I loved their Mumbaicha vada pao. It was really finger licking good. Dahi seekh kebab has a room for improvement though. The mushroom tikka was simply mind blowing. We were already full eating those starters. So we ordered Chilli cheese onion kulcha and malai kofta. Both were tasty. Generally I am not a big fan of vegetarian food. But this place made me fall in love with vegetarian food.

It was a cool night... As the rain washed the city for a temporary relief from the scotching heat and the sky was still lightning... We were in a hurry to catch the Mumbai Local... When we reached there it was totally packed... And we fall in doute about getting our seats inside since we don't had any reservations... In the mean time Shaizad came and greeted us with a simle and assured us a seat after a 15min wait... It became difficult for us to wait as the weather is not good and the waiting area was so hot as there were two large outdoor units of AC blowing all it anger on us... But very soon Shaizad came and asked us to get inside and wait and in no time he arranged a great comfortable seat for us... He is doing a wonderful job undoubtedly...  

Now coming to the food... We ordered some of their drinks n signature dishes in a row... And as the foods‚Äã n drinks are coming back to back... We get thrilled...  It was a visual treat I must say... And the natural lighting show from their transparent celling was an added beauty to our dinner... Lovely time...

‚òÖ Queen's Necklace~ It was mainly a modified version of watermelon mojito... And it was so so refreshing... #recommend...

For all this we need to thank Royd our server who guided us well n given good suggestions‚Äã regarding the selection of the food...

I'm very happy with the‚Äã service... It was top notch...

If you've never been on the Mumbai Local, here's your chance! ;) Located in the posh Ballygunge Park Road, this themed restaurant with Graffiti on the walls and old Bombay nostalgia offers Mumbai street food with quirky names. We tried the Mumbaicha Vada Pao and Bhaji Pao Mastani. The Mumbaicha Vada Pao is served on a slab and has charcoal coloured vada paos. It tasted chikna! The Bhaji Pao is a Do-It-Yourself take on Pao Bhaji. They give you the bread, the butter and the brush with the masala in a jar and you're supposed to plate up for yourself. A bit on the expensive side understandably given the location but do try it out if you are visiting Quest Mall and suddenly feel the urge to taste a slice of Mumbai.

Our destination was somewhere but we were destined for MUMBAI LOCAL...
And surprisingly our experience proved immensely successful... We ended up having a sumptuous family dinner. The restaurant is located in a small lane at ballygunge, the Google map gives incorrect location though.. Apart from that minute negative point, this is an excellent cosy place for a family dinner for all the vegetarians out there. Even my strictly non-veg brother could be impressed by their wonderful dishes. We started with tandoori mushroom and chhote mian pan accompanied by rapchik raspberry and lights camera action(a must try for all, an amazing refreshing drink). Followed by malai kofta, jhalfrezy, paneer tikka masala and masala khulcha.. The paneer was delicious but the mushroom was too tender and juicy wrapped in a tasty grave and ofcourse don't miss out on the green chutney along with it. However I couldn't resist myself from trying out truffle cheese dhosa and I was absolutely mesmerised but the amazing texture of the dhosa and the truffle filling.. This is a highly recommended dish.. And last but not the least the show stopper was the complimentary chocolate cake... An absolute yum.. Please everyone, do not hold yourself back from trying out this place.. Great service and amazing art of presentation which is truely delightful..

Went last weekend for dinner. Though the place is not too big the theme is different and ambiance good. Coming to the food we tried the Raspberry drink which tasted really good. The starters crispy chili baby corn was nice. We tried the Truffle Dosa and Chana Bhatura which were amazing. The Chana Bhatura was served quite uniquely. For main course be had Dal Makhani, Paneer Lababdar, Lasooni Palak all of which were well prepared. Breads were good too especially Tandoori Roti. Roasted papad was bit semi roasted in between otherwise well prepared dishes. Finally, the dessert hai-la was palatable and was again served uniquely. Overall a very pleasant experience. Staff were courteous and service quick. The person in-charge there, Mr. Anup was very receptive and courteous. A must visit again place !

Went there on the basis of review on zomato.... The staff and the manager were courteous... The decor was nicely done with the glass ceiling n the local train interior.
We ordered a Maggie dosa- which was 2 crisp dosa and a small packet of cooked Maggi. The portion was not decent for a price of 230+ taxes

Crispy chilly babycorn ; noodles n munchurian were  good n the portion was decent this time..

I got a call up from the manager who took feedbacks of the visit.. I informed him about the issue n he told that he would look into it and get back to me about the same but haven't heard back from him yet.

The 2 rating is just for the decor n the staff.
Note- people go to a restaurant for the food nd the value for money but u just can't b fooling people on the basis of stupid innovation.

Although this is a vegetarian outlet it manages to pull huge crowds reminding us that vegetarian foods have never lost their glory and can equally compete with non vegetarian ones.
Look and feel: I guess the ambience is far more attractive during the day because of the transparent roof. I had gone there for dinner and I found the seating arrangement a bit odd and lights could have been dimmer to give more of that restro feel.
Food: Dhobi ghaat chana batura is obviously one of their specialities. The presentation is simply mindblowing and very innovative. Apart from that it tastes heavenly. So thumbs up fot this.

Truffle cheese dosa is served with cheese spread and garlic and mushrooms with cheese. This too is a unique dish and I personally loved it's subtle flavours.

Raapchik raspberry is a drink having the bursting flavours of raspberry. This is a very refreshing drink to go with your food.

Berry nu pulao for main course is definitely must try dish consisting of nuts, dried berries and veggies.

Paneer tikka masala is too spicy. I could not eat it much because of the extremely high spice level. Even the sweet pulao couldnot balance its spice level.

Strawberry bathtub: Now with this the quote "All that glitters is not gold" goes just well. The presentation is outstanding but the dessert is just some ice cream spread on a cake base with some fresh strawberries and tutti fruti. It is so sweet that after having two to three spoons you won't be able to take it any more and I haven't had such a horrible cake in long time. So definitely I would suggest my fellow foodies to avoid this completely.

All in all. This is a really good place to try some new dishes and you won't be disappointed.

Value for money: the price is a bit on the higher side. All of this had cost us approximately 2300 bucks.

Had gone to Mumbai local on a weekday for dinner. To my surprise it was full with families. Though they now have to change their decor. The staff was friendly and we got a complimentary dessert too. Ordered paneer tikka masala which was not that amazing. I liked their dal makhani and cheese onion kulcha. The star of the dinner was the strawberry bath which was a strawberry Monte Carlo. Though the cake in it was pretty dry and they improvised it too much. One time visit is necessary. 

I didn't feel Mumbai on a plate. üò¢

I visited this place today at lunch. As heard menu was full of variety. We opted for its famous Dhobhi  Ghat batura and the presentation was very impressive as all the baturas were hung like clothes. Then we ordered frankies and they were resl treat to eat. We also ordered Maggi Dosa but it was nothing special rather the management should rework on this item. Then we ordered Hakka noudles and Fried Rice and both were upto mark. Overall food quality was very good but the best part was the presentation and the warmth of the service. They have a smiling face and were very very polite and cooperative in their behaviour. We recommend others to visit this pkace. Since we were first timers they served us a complimentry cake for us which was a very nice gesture and worth a mention here. @

When it comes to food... And when it comes to pure vegetarian food... You must visit Mumbai local. From outside of the restaurant you will feel the vibe of being in Mumbai. When you enter the restaurant.. it's an awesome ambiance which is very beautiful. 
In the mocktails..  must go for Light, Camera,Action or Queen Necklace Punch. Then further you must try Chef's special Dhobhi Ghat Chole Bhature. Mamaji's cheese grilled sandwich is very nice.
Main course... Dal makhani is delicious and goes well with Malabari Paratha. Berry nu pulao is also a must try. In desserts go for Mudh Island.
Overall food is awesome and delicious. Price is a bit more than average. Service is wonderful. I would like to thank Mr. Sanjay for his hospitality and gesture.
I'm planning soon to visit again for some South Indian cuisine and Chinese cuisine. Pani Puri is also pending for next visit...

In aww with all the 'Faadu Items'. 
Tried almost all of them. And each one tastes very good. Loved the presentation. My Favorites : Dhobhi Ghat Chana Bhatura, Chowpatty Panipuri and Litchi Popsicle. 
The quantity is sufficient for 4 people if you want to try other items and not fill your stomach with a few. The staff service is superb. Sanjay was the one assisting us. 
It is worth the try. If you love street this is the place for you.

Visited Mumbai Local for a luncheon with friends. It is located on Ballygunge Park Road, a few stoppages from Quest Mall.
The place has a transparent-shed roof and remains well lit, during both day and evening. The artistic props and graffiti all around the outlet exudes a nostalgic charm of the cultures of both Kolkata and Mumbai. Now let‚Äôs talk about the food here.

We tried quite a number of dishes and I was surprised to find each one of them to be quite spectacular.
Queen‚Äôs Necklace was a refreshingly cool mocktail made on a base of watermelon juice and basil. Had a quirky presentation. Dhobi Ghat Chana Bhatura are one of the signature dishes here. Again well-presented and tasted great. Truffle Cheese Dosa is something to die for. Could resist from having more and more of it. One thing I noticed about all the items we were served, was their presentation. These guys deserve full points for that. I mean with presentation like this, your hunger is half satisfied just by looking at the dish.
Well, moving on, next up was Mamaji‚Äôs Grilled Sandwis. Cheese and coriander chutney sandwiches served in Mumbai style, were too good to miss out on. One Two Ka Four Platter is a four-kebab platter consisting of vegetables kebabs, grilled paneer, mushroom kebabs and grilled potatoes. Don‚Äôt forget to have these with the coriander chutney and spicy chickpea dip.
Berry Nu Pulao has aromatic pulao combined with sweet caramelised onions and dried berries and I must admit, it‚Äôs something one should definitely try. I mean the berry element just gives a whole new angle to the dish.
Last but not the least, Strawberry Bathtub, an incredible dessert. When it arrived, we were completely blown away by the presentation itself. Strawberry gelatin served in a fishbowl with oozing dry ice. Alongside was vanilla ice cream with strawberry gel, cookie crumbs, nougat to complete the set.

Lastly they served us some complimentary popsicles of varying flavours, which even though complimentary, were quite flavourful. Loved the Mojito flavour.
Service was top notch, no complaints there. Prices are a bit high, but the food more than makes up for it. Would definitely recommend visiting this place.

Visited Mumbai Local couple of days back. Wondering what it is? It's one of the most interesting eateries I have been to in a while. Fashioned after the lively city of Mumbai, which incidentally happens to be a city I am in awe of; the food is what typical Mumbaikar food stands for and the decor is an effort to give you the feel to. Walls depicting the famed Mumbai local trains, the SeaLink road, the Arabian Sea, the Filmi heroes, yesteryear's newspapers and posters and numerous other knickknacks; this place is sure to keep you riveted from the first to the last.
The Food is a visual delight here. The presentation to the perfection.
Amongst numerous mouthwatering delicacies, I loved the Lights, Camera,Action drink with the drink being presented in a camera lens and the cool yet tangy taste of ginger ale,lime with a minty taste being a soother.
Another fantastic drink which caught my fancy was the Rapchik Raspberry. The Thick Raspberry was actually felt.
The onion rings, crispy and tasty came in the form of a tree with a tangy chutney in the side.
The Mumbai Vada Pav is a quintessential Vada Pav, but with a twist in the charcoal integrated Pavs with a lasooni chutney. it is an interesting sight.
Another visual delight which also tasted sumptuous was the Parsi dish called Berry Nu Pulao and Rustom's Dhansaak. The slightly sweet Berry Nu Pulao topped with fried onions and dried berries is a complete winner.
The Dhobi Ghat Chana Bhatura is a stunning piece of art, with the puffed up Bhaturas hanging from a clothes lines with clothes pegs.
The yesteryear's pepsi cola tube comes alive with the Babaji Ka Thullu. Presented in a wooden cart, the flavours are fantastic. My personal favourite was the Litchi flavoured one.
The yesteryear's pepsi cola tube comes alive with the Babaji Ka Thullu. 
Mumbai Local serves some pretty spectacular desserts also,served with panache. The Madh Island is one such. Though it has nothing to do with the island, yet the crushed brownies and nuts served inside a tree trunk along with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce does make it a visual delight.
Another amazing looking desserts was the Birdbath!
The vegetarian gem of a restaurant is nestled in Ballygunge Park  and is rated 4.2 in Zomato.
Thanks First Idea PR Company for the invite.

Been Here with my foodie friends on 1st of April on lunch time to try some of their Raapchik dishes.

It was located in 19 Ballygunge park road in between Quest mall and Birla Mandir easily findable in Maps.

A happy place with quirky elements and interesting accessories adorning the d√©cor. The ground level has alfresco style dining but with a transparent shed and air-conditioning. There are paintings of people boarding a local train on one side and ¬†posters of popular Bollywood characters on the other. The old style lanterns and train grab bars are hard to miss. On level one, there is seating for 30 plus diners with leather sofas, wooden tables and chairs.There‚Äôs a huge mural of Mumbai city on one wall. Framed print adsfrom the 70s and 80s adorn another wall evoking a sense of nostaligiaon.. All in all, the ambience manages to pull off the theme very well, bringing out the charm of the city of dreams, with simplicity. Full Marks to the presentation it was tremendously fantastic. Service and hospitality was very appreciable and heart touching.

So now let's see what we tried that day starting with the mocktail we had from the Nava Menu - 

* Queens Necklace - Very delicious and very refreshing mocktail made with watermelon and basil. a perfect summer cooler for this summer. Tastes delicious and served beautifully.

In snacks we tried something's delicious and something's innovative reviewed below - 

* Dhobi Ghaat Chana Bhatura - Beautifully presented mini bhatura's hanging with clips in plastic grass base served with dry masala Chana which tastes traditionally delicious and with spicy chickpea curry. Loved the taste and loved the presentation. Highly recommended.

* Mamaji's Grilled Sandwis - Straight from the street of Mumbai, Sandwich of vegetables, cheese and coriander chatni Grilled till crisp tastes truly desi and very delicious served with street style potato chips and tomato ketchup.

* Truffle Cheese - Here comes the shows topper dish. South Indian Dosa with amazingly delicious fusion touch. Dosa smeared with truffle oil, cheese and button mushrooms tastes heavenly. Served with a mushroom truffle cheesy sauce. Heavenly tasted Dosa a personal favorite highly recommended.

* Rustam's Favorite Dhansak - From the house of Mumbai Dabbawala's this Rustam's Favorite Dhansak made with vegetables and lentils in thick gravy form cooked with generous pinch of parsi masala tastes delicious and comes the very tasty fried okras and caramelized onions fried rice in a dabba. Tasty meal loved it.

* One Two Ka Four Platter - Kababs platter in which we get vegetables Kababs, paneer Kababs, mushrooms Kababs, Grilled potatoes and some Grilled veggies. Extremely flavorful with great essence and taste. Veggies kabab was perfectly made mild and delicious, Grilled potatoes were crispy and smoky, mushrooms were juicy, creamy and delicious, paneer has smoky feel and they tastes delicious. Served with coriander chatni and spicy chickpea.

* Berry Nu Pulao - Semi Sweet caramelized onions fried rice topper with dried berries tastes amazingly delicious. A must try dish. Just a suggestion to management to serve something like curd etc with it so it's more easy to have. But it still tastes truly delicious.

* Strawberry Bathtub - The most ravishingly presented and heavenly tasted dessert I've ever had. Ice cream served in Bathtub with strawberry gel in tubes in nitrogen gas filled fishbowl. Deliciously tasted dessert made with vanilla ice cream covered on strawberries, strawberry gel and some nuts with a base of butter cookies crumbs. Highly recommended recommended.

At last they serve us complimentary popsicles in thella gadi toy which were full of flavor and they tastes amazingly delicious. Loved them comes in Mojito, lychi, mango and strawberry etc flavors.

That's all with my experience. Before rapt up like to thank management and staff specially Md. Iqbal for this wonderful experience. A must try place. Personal favorite highly recommended to all.

A place where the presentation of the food, especially appetizers will make you satisfied and leave a craving for more. Can be visited with both, friends and family. Pindi chana is a dish definitely worth trying.
However, the service was very very slow. Be ready to expect a growling stomach by the time your food arrives! Moreover, the menu could have been a bit more diverse. For visitors who don't want to eat North Indian food, the only option is Chinese.

On the occassion of a small get together, we decided to give this place a shot.
I, personally, found the decor to be really good. Divided into two sections, the area on the 1st floor had good sitting arrangements which could accomodate big groups on cozy sofas. It gave the view of a garden area which was quite comforting to the eyes and the mind.
After chit chatting, we decided to order the very famous Dhobi Ghaat Chole Bhature which indeed was served in a delightful manner - the hanging bhaturas. Also, the chole had a quite distinguished taste.
To go with that we ordered paneer tikka which was quite huge as compared to the tikkas that are served in other restaurants. Served with chutneys, these tikkas were lip smacking üòã which I could not resist.
The entire meal was quite fulfilling.
To give ourselves some sweet treat, we ordered chocolate mousse - served in a chocolate ball which was melted using hot chocolate. The dessert was quite chocolatey and made us immensely happy.
To sum it up, the decor, the food and the staff made us quite happy and satisfied. Indeed it is worth a second visit.

If I love any other city after my own, it has to be Mumbai. So when I was invited to the ‚ÄòMumbai themed‚Äô restaurant in Ballygunge, I was pretty excited to check it out. The place, with its fantastic wall murals will surely transport one to the City of Dreams in an instant. I loved their menu, and couldn‚Äôt stop flipping through it, for a good fifteen minutes.

The food here is a slice of the Street Food scene of Mumbai, tweaked here and there, and made fancier. The food here is presented beautifully and has rather interesting names. Be it the gola, or the cotton candy and vada pav, all find a place in the menu. I specially liked their Chowpatty Gola in Litchi Kaffir Lime flavour, with its subtle yet clear lime flavours working magic with the sweetness of litchi. The Dhobi Ghat Chana Batura is a visual delight, with the baturas hanging in a clothes line, held secure with wooden pegs, on a grassy tray.

The Parsi dishes on their menu were a standout too. The Berry Nu Polao and Rustom‚Äôs dhansak, in rustic tiffin carriers, were polished off in a jiffy by me. The Rapchik Raspberry drink was the perfect accompaniment to them. The polao and dhansak was my absolute favourite part of the rather long meal, followed closely by the Truffle Cheese Dosa.
                                          ...

This was in my wishlist since it opened. Yesterday I visited this newly opened joint in Ballygunje with my friends , to start with the interior decor is very unique.It gives a feeling of traveling in a Local train and the sitting arrangements were made accordingly so that u feel that essence.
The staffs are very friendly and prompt in responding,this restaurant serves only vegetarian food but it worth going to this restaurant even if somebody don't like vegetarian food that much.They serve good vegetarian food and it's totally value for money.
We tried Chowpathy Panipuri,Chottemiya Paneer Tikka in starters and Madh Island in dessert, the presentation of the food most importantly the dessert is just awesome.I must mention about Sanjay(restaurant staff) he was just awesome with his service,he also served Babaji ka thullu as complimentary which reminded of our childhood days..
To some this up it's a good place and one should must visit this place.

Today I visited Mumbai locals after getting a big queue at Nawwarah. 
I was waited by Md. Iqbal.
I have to say- the staff is very prompt and courteous.
There is service at one call.
The food quality and taste is good. The taste of items like- Chana Bhatura and Mumbaicha bada paw is good.
North Indian is good.
Presentation is excellent.
The presentation gets full marks.
The crispy chilli baby corn is the only thing that is average.
The place is a little overpriced. Like an extra paw was priced 125. 
The place is recommended to all.
Is good for youngsters as well as there oldies.

Must not visit place..........
If you dare to go, be prepared to be called by a telecaller Prashar (He claims he don't have a full name) from 98307-16182 and being spoken with very harshly. He will be extremely rude and insulting if you request him not to call for reviews. He will argue with you badly. If you say you won't visit again, he will say please don't.
If you call the restaurant to inform this, they will not let you speak to the owner Mr. Harsh Sultania, perhaps.
God bless!!!

Great experience here at Mumbai local today. Mushroom pepper salt is a must have. Overall presentation of food and service is excellent. Md. Iqbal needs a special mention here, a very pleasing guy who really pampered my little one with their yummy popsicles. A great time we had here.

This has opened up instead of Villa 19.
Finally off my list. 
It's as good as I have heard it to be. Ambience is nice. 
Service is really nice (Arif), they are ready to hear you out. 
Order mixed platter, loved everything in it kebabs mushrooms paneer and aloo. 
Dhobi ghat chana kulcha. Has new way of serving, quite an idea. 
Schezwan dosa, pleasure to your tastebuds. 
Rustoms dhanshak, something they need to work on. Needs more flavour of onion garlic and rice should caramelised in onion and not like biryani. I know every    Chef has own way of making it but maybe should try this way. 
Finally the dessert. Hi-la was certainly rapchik mal. Mousse inside a chocolate ball, ball breaks when the warm chocolate sauce is poured. Perfectly yum. Mousse being perfectly sweetened not excess. 
Good food and service. Would like to visit again for other things on menu, like Maggi dosa. Vada Pav. Hoping it to be equally good.also, would like to get popsicles on the house again.

MD. IQBAL was fantastic. Words are not enough to explain how much he cared for us. It was a mind blowing experience. Apart from being tall, dark and handsome he went to extreme lengths to care for the slightest of our needs.

Food was great. We ordered a lot of items and each and every items was tasty. They gave us complimentary popstickles at the end. Too good. Would definitely visit again.

This restaurant is refreshing break from the stereotypical vegetarian joints!! 
It's a game changer in the chain of vegetarian restaurants! 

This place has the perfect Mumbai wali feeling, the decor of a Mumbai local train, and the way they present their food is what is the most important attraction they have to offer! 

Drinks- We ordered for the Lights Camera Action, which is a perfect drink to beat the heat and Bawaji ka Thullu which are old school popsicle and they take you back in time, available in orange , kiwi, mint and lime flavours, it definitely just lightened our moods up! 

Food- To begin with we ordered for the Chowpatty Pani Puri and the way it was presented already made the food delicious.  As they say- Half the taste lies in the way the food is presented and for me it just did that. The pani and the puri both were super! 

Next we ordered for the Dhobi Ghaat Chana Bhatura and it was served to us on a tray which had The texture of a green lawn and the Bhaturas were hanging by a clip giving it the perfect Dhobi Ghaat look along with chole, which were made on pindi chana style and we're extremely delicious! The flavours just exploded in your mouth. 
Followed by that we ordered for the Achari paneer tikka, the reason why I loved it was because the paneer pieces were soft on the inside and perfectly tandoori on the outside emitting a certain tandoori flavour which made it all the more delicious. ‚ù§ Yummy points on that!!! 

For main course we ordered Dal Makhani which was creamy and again had the perfect tandoori flavour. 
Also the Pindi chana and Kadhai paneer were upto the mark. 

For breads we ordered the Masala kulcha, Garlic Naan, pudina paratha, And tandoori roti and all of the breads were perfectly cooked! 

After eating all of this there wasn't any space left for dessert but I have heard that there Hai-La is very delicious!! It's a chocolate sphere filled with mousee and when hot chocolate is poured over it the sphere dissolves and unleashes the yummy chocolate dessert! Next time that what I m trying!! 

I would specially mention the staff here, which are very courteous, and so well behaved, all the food was served hot and on time and the staff were always at their feet and catered to every need of yours! 
I would again specifically mention the staff named PRASHANTA who was the main person to look at our table and he was very sweet and served us very nicely! He even made our Bawaji ka Thullu complimentary! 

I had a great experience here and I m coming for some Mumbai time soon!!! ‚ù§

Planned for a dinner on our way back from a movie. Had noticed this place couple of days back. Surprisingly this was a train themed restaurant with excellent veg food and moderate assortment of drinks. Appetizers were presented very well and had authentic Mumbai flavors. We ordered phuchka and Sahi sheekh kebab along with a rapchik raspberry drink. This rendered an excellent start to a main course where malabar paratha and paneer tikka masala stole the show. Kulcha was decent but have had better kulcha before. Portions were nice. Bill included a 5% service charge which I felt was fair. 
Service was excellent. If you are not averse to veg food , it's a must visit.

Mumbai Local was one place were we eagerly wanted to go. The presentation of the food was outstanding. Innumerable people asked me about the restaurant after I'd uploaded pictures on my SnapChat. 
The feel of the restaurant is very nice, and overall the ambience is great! 
The food was good. We ordered the Dhobi Ghat (Chhole Bhature), Lights Camera Action(a mocktail), Chawpatty Pani Puri. However, the portion was too small. The bhaturas were fist-sized and the pani puri was very little. So, keeping the serving size in mind, i found the place pricey. 
Also, the bill was accompanied with paan flavoured cotton candy. Yay!

It was a Saturday and my friend took me to this pure vegetarian restaurant. We went there for lunch. 
The ambience is one of those casual meet ups. The roof is glass covered and the walls have interesting wallpapers of Bollywood characters, beach and quotes to have the essence of Mumbai. The restaurant is based on bringing 'amchi' Mumbai to Kolkata by serving their street food and other local dishes. 
It was our first time so we preferred making our choices safely. We ordered Mumbaicha Vada Pao, daal makhani and garlic nun. 
The Vada Pao was fair to my taste but I loved the daal makhani. The quantity of daal makhani was good and the garlic nun had huge pieces as well. 
I know my comments might not be fair as I am a big time meat lover but I feel vegetarians will find this place delightful.

Mumbai has always been known for its spicy grub. Now,even Calcuttans can enjoy typical Mumbai food here. It's a Mumbai themed restra with bright interiors and with caricatures to make it attractive. 
There are loads of options for starters. 
We tried Mushroom Dosai which was served with a cheese sauce and the combination was really well thought. Paw bhaji was spicy to the core. What differentiated it from other restras is its presentation. They have their unique style of presenting food platter which makes the food more tempting.
Would definitely like to drop in again to try more dishes.

A few weeks back I got an invitation from Mumbai Local, the vegetarian food joint located at Ballygunge for food tasting along with fellow bloggers and food enthusiasts and well the dilemma started as I knew the options are going to be Veg! It is not that I don‚Äôt like vegetarian food, in fact, irrespective being a hardcore non-vegetarian I enjoy my portion of vegetarian food as well. To be very frank I enjoy visiting the restaurants that serve only vegetarian food once in a while to just to change the palate.¬†It was a nice evening and my first visit to Mumbai Local though I have visited another Restaurant by the same owner, Gabber‚Äôs Bar and Kitchen.¬† I was not expecting anything more than Gabber‚Äôs as I checked the menu before visiting and in fact, I was a bit skeptical about the entire concept as Gabber‚Äôs is actually one of my favorites from the typical genre it belongs and naturally, the expectation was at least something on par with that.
                                                                ...

Located in Ballygunge, Mumbai Local has a very interesting take on not only how the name of food items can be written on the menu but also how it can be presented to you on the table. Very good place for lunch and the price is nominal for the food they provide. Specially the Rasooli paalak was spectacular. One the kind themes and a place where you won't feel you are in Kolkata.

Was served by Ikbal who went out of his way to make us feel comfortable

Food was good - obviously very uniquely served with props for good effect. Good place for food-selfie-lovers. ;)

We tried pav bhaji, vada pav, sharaabi panipuri, dhobi ghaat chana bhatura, shikanji, gola-ball-dessert! All were extremely nice, though we were too full to finish the last couple of dishes. Popsicles along with the bill was an added treat!

Only complaints (which are not really complaints but observations):
1. The service was a little too personalized. We were asked too many times if everything was alright. I guess a little more space/privacy would be nice
2. The place was empty at 8:15PM on Friday night which was a little unsettling when we arrived

They've finally got it right with their 2nd makeover. From The Tasting Room to Villa 19 to now Mumbai Local. 
The decor is quite in line with their entire mumbai local theme and so is their menu. The food is presented well, served on time and tastes good too. I've tried their Charcoal Bun Vada Pav, Dahi Kebab, Mumbaiya Shikanji and few dishes from their North Indian Main Course. 

The unavoidable negatives for me were: 
1. Their Menu cards are extremely dirty, stained and sticky. You've got to wash your hands after you're done placing the order. Hands feel sticky and stink as well. Over time the menu cards will have stains but the stickiness can definitely be taken care of. 

2. The staff needs adequate training. They are all courteous in terms of behaviour. But the way they serve, put down the cutlery or the serving plates with a bang is not something people want to experience. 

3. The staff needs to know when and how to clear plates when the customer is done eating. If 2 out of 3 people are done eating doesn't mean you go ahead and clear the 3rd person's plate as well. Definitely not when that person has food on his plate, is still chewing food and their wrist is rested on the plate.

Located in Ballygunge, Mumbai Local has a very interesting take on not only how the name of food items can be written on the menu but also how it can be presented to you on the table. But sadly, this is where Mumbai Local's charm ceases to exist. 

The food is average at best, both in taste and quantity (except Madh Island which is a sinful delight). The interiors have been designed to resemble, well, a Mumbai local train which is quite eye catching and guarantees a remark from every visitor. (The wallpapers are quite eye-catching).

I ordered the MumBaicha Vada Pao, Dhobhi Ghat Chana Bhatura, Sharabi Panipuri, Raapchik Raasberry, Lights Camera Action and Madh Pie. With each serving I was amazed by the creative presentation of each item but it was Madh Island which was an absolute stand out. The beverages were quite good too. 

The itmes are quite pricy and the quantity of the food doesn't justify it either. The bill is give in a container with "‡§µ‡§æ‡§ü ‡§≤‡§ó ‡§ó‡§Ø‡•Ä" written on it which is quite ironical. 

Even though after taking into consideration its short comings, Mumbai Local can be considered visiting because of its "well-adhered-to" theme, creative food presentation and not to forget, it's a pure veg restaurant which is a rare breed in Kolkata.

Very nice place. Wonderful ambience. The host Md.  Iqbal is just too good.  His suggestions worked well.  We had tandoori mashroom,  rustoms favourite rice with parsi masala, chilli cheese kulcha,  superb madh island. A must visit place.  Mr.  Rajib Bera also was very helpful. Thank you mumbai local for such service.  I hope you keep it the same always.

Located in Ballygunge, Mumbai Local has a very interesting take on not only how the name of food items can be written on the menu but also how it can be presented to you on the table. But sadly, this is where Mumbai Local's charm ceases to exist. 

The food is average at best, both in taste and quantity (except Madh Island which is a sinful delight). The interiors have been designed to resemble, well, a Mumbai local train which is quite eye catching and guarantees a remark from every visitor. (The wallpapers are quite eye-catching).

I ordered the MumBaicha Vada Pao, Dhobhi Ghat Chana Bhatura, Sharabi Panipuri, Raapchik Raasberry, Lights Camera Action and Madh Pie. With each serving I was amazed by the creative presentation of each item but it was Madh Island which was an absolute stand out. The beverages were quite good too. 

The itmes are quite pricy and the quantity of the food doesn't justify it either. The bill is give in a container with "‡§µ‡§æ‡§ü ‡§≤‡§ó ‡§ó‡§Ø‡•Ä" written on it which is quite ironical. 

Even though after taking into consideration its short comings, Mumbai Local can be considered visiting because of its "well-adhered-to" theme, creative food presentation and not to forget, it's a pure veg restaurant which is a rare breed in Kolkata.

When I visited this place I had no idea that this place was under the same management as Gabbar !
I liked the quirky interiors and the feel of a Mumbai local train .
As far as the food is concerned I had ordered just two dishes since there were just two of us .
Mongolian Rice were yummy and nicely presented . The portion size was decent .
Didn't quite like the puchka dish though.
All in all I liked the place and would make a visit soon.

Quite a fancy place in terms of the decor and the presentation of the food! Some items are really good while others just look better than they taste. Overall was quite satisfied with the meal until the staff there tried to pull a trick by asking us to replace a torn ‚Çπ2000 note which we hadn't given! The moment I refused to accept it, he in a second agreed to just accept it. Wonder if they'd try to fool us in more ways. A healthy experience spoilt because of over smart staff!

The worst restaurant I have been to in the last 3 months for sure. The taste of the food is very volatile, in which some dishes are excellent and some are not worth putting in the mouth. Presentation might intrigue you at first, but when you plate the food, it's quite disgusting. The Pav Bhaji and Chole Bhatura are a small example. The food is much more then just these 2. So if you happen to go there ... I suggest you see the decoration on the other tables and order Ur food as per wish ...

Vegetarian food joints are on the rise in Kolkata- and that too good one. I found Mumbai Local to be one of them. Frankly, I was invited there for the food tasting by the management. Frankly, what I found, the presentation of the food items was mind boggling, simply freaky. The parsi dishes, including the Soya Dhansak and Berry Pulao were great, but the best dish that we could found out was the burger combo. I looked as well as tasted great also. Baturas, hung from the cord were pleasure to look at, but probably got cold a little sooner than expected and the chana, according to my palate, was a bit dry. Waffles made with uttapam batter was great and there were some pretty neat cocktails. Overall, definitely recommended.

For such a high priced resturant it surely lacks in all major departments. I was really disappointed :(

Wow. It was a weeday night and the place was packed. However i didn't get why. We sat in the dining area for afamily dinner. Mumbai local puts up a good show but cannot deliver on taste and serving. Much like Gabbar's at Ho Chi Minh Sarani, its good for an outing with friends and an experience. But the biggest disappointmentcame with the maggi dosa. The concept was unclear to us, as the maggi didn't go with the dosa and tge dose was burnt. Definitely one of the worst fooding experiences in Kolkata.

The presentation of food was excellent but I feel the quality as in taste wise was compromised upon.. More emphasis was laid on the presentation that the taste..I ordered for the famous Maggi Dosa of Mumbai, which was no where near the taste of the actual Maggi dosa of Mumbai.. The kulcha were also not hot ,maybe they were served hung, so they got cold in the process of good presentation.. Overall I will not say I had a bad exp as some of the stuffs were good too.. But after struggling for its booking over the weekend,  I expected a better experience..

My first time visiting Mumbai Local after being renovated and changed! A totally new menu.
The food- probably one the few good places in kolkata to have good Indian food. The way they serve their dishes is also innovative, for example the chola bhatura. The food is really good, top notch. 
The service- very good service
Interior and ambience- both are amazing, the background music is good, full Bollywood, the interior is awesome, it reminds of you the 70s and 80s etc. It gives you the full mumbai feeling. 
Love the place, wouldn't mind eating at mumbai local again!

We visited this place a couple of months back after hearing a lot about it. The place had created a buzz since its launch for its innovative presentations and it does live upto that expectation. But the food can definitely improve especially indian section. And one thing that was very unethical is that they use egg in one of the desserts but nowhere in the menu is it mentioned. On visiting the washroom, my friend saw eggs in the kitchen and later on, we asked one of the waiters there and he said it is used it one of the desserts. For a 'pure vegetarian' place to be doing that is very unethical. Atleast disclose it in the menu. Some people dine here purely because it says 100% vegetarian. I hope they correct this else i am not visiting atleast.

Cash-less Dinner. 

After a shocking move by Mr. Modi, we decided to go cashless this dinner. The food here is great and the place was empty (Blame the money) We ordered a few starters but the food wasn't as good as the presentation. Indian main course was also not extraordinary. Good place to visit and chill. Would not recommend spending your valuable 100 rupee notes here.

I quite liked the place right from the graffitis on the walls and decor being inspired by Mumbai to the the plating of the food. 
The mushrooms, Channa batura and paw bhaji was finger licking good. Mysore masala Dhosa was average. What I loved was that the manager took the feedback quite sportingly and asked me if he could get me something better instead. The staff is polite and well informed. 

Totally loved it.

A day after Diwali, my sister and me decided to go for lunch with nani and mom. We had a nice, sumptuous lunch and were about to leave when we decided to click a few pictures with my 1.5 year old niece. Next to the entrance while posing for pictures, my niece got restless, lost balance and fell on the floor from my arms. It was an accident which unfortunately we couldn't avoid. She had bruised her cheek and it was swollen. It was the worst moment and the worst way to end an otherwise good eating-out experience. We somehow tried to console our baby and left the restaurant so that others wouldn't be disturbed. In a minute or so a staff from the restaurant came out and told us to come in and apply ice on the bruise. They were visibly upset just like us and offered to help. We went in and applied ice wrapped in napkins provided by them. I mentioned that we'd rather stay away from the main area as other visitors might get disturbed to which one of them replied 'Koi disturb nai hoga' Their only concern just like ours was to help heal our baby. The ice did help to reduce the swelling. I don't know your names but would like to thank you'll for reminding us about ice at that time and for helping us. Really appreciate the kind gesture.

P.S. My niece is fine, we had visited the doctor later on and he assured us that there is nothing to worry about. üòä

Yesterday was my second visit with family and I'm sure it won't be the last visit..every item which we ordered was perfect!
Lights camera action - nice mocktail nd equally nice presentation 
4 starters (paav bhaaji, vada paav, baby corn and masala papad) all of them were very nice!
Dhansak which we had ordered had a unique flavour little on the sweeter side but it was how a Parsi dish is supposed to be
Icing on the cake was mud cake which one has to control oneself in having more
Amazing food, good ambience and very courteous staff (Mr. Prasanta)..

A must  visit place for everyone in kolkata,  very close to my home in ballygunge. The food was very very good. We had ordered pav bhaji,  chana bhatura they were outstanding.  The pani puri was average only presentation was good,  then we had tandoori alu and dahi kabab they were wonderful, even the Mongolian rice and noodles was good and the show stopper was their madh island dessert ,  awesome plating and taste,  over all very nice and pleasant experience and this review would not be complete without mentioning about Mr Prasanta, he was helpful,  courteous and even gave us free Popsicles and pan candy floss overall very good.
Accepts cash and cards, it is advised to make the reservation  because they are usually full.

Mumbai local is located in Ballygunge at the location of villa 19. The place is primarily an Indian restaurant with flavours primarily inspired from Mumbai local food. The interiors are also decorated with graffitis and pictures from Mumbai. They have a huge seating area with couple of halls divided into two floors. We went there on a weekday and got seated immediately on the 2nd floor. We went there after having some food already at another place so we decided to order vada pav, pav bhaji, Maggi dosa for kids, tandoori aloo and chole bhature. Everything was so terrific. Probably the best vada pav and pav bhaji in town exactly resembling the Mumbai flavour. Bhaji had the perfect blend of spice and tanginess. Presentation of chole bhature was amazing. Tandoori aloo was so perfectly cooked that it just melted in the mouth. Best part was the dessert for which we ordered a new dish in their menu called Golmaal. It was a chocolate sphere with chocolate mousse filled inside it and with hot melted chocolate poured over it. Service was quick after initial wait of 15 mins. Little over priced for the size of portions they serve. Must visit if you want to try some great Mumbai flavours in town.

Great ambience. The food serving concepts was unique like the pani puri and chola batura. But please learn from others mistakes and don't order American chopsuey. It was pathetic. Felt like some vegetables were boiled in a liquid and served. Although the manager replaced the chopsuey but it was better than before and still pathetic. üòüüòü

Location: Just cross the Birla Temple while Heading Towards Quest Mall, opposite side there goes a lane and it is located a few meters inside the Lane. Restaurant is opposite the Kensington Manor. GPS Location is absolutely correct, so follow the GPS signs.

Ambiance: I am bowled over the Interiors. It‚Äôs a sister Concern of ‚ÄúGabbar‚Äù, but it surpasses ‚ÄúGabbar‚Äù miles, in terms of Interior Designing. The Front has a Huge Black Board with Names of Mostly Mumbai Land Marks Mentioned and this itself is inviting enough. The Door opens to a Lane, full of Natural Light (The Roof is Transparent). There are some Table Chairs arrangement in one side, in pattern of A Platform. The walls are Painted with Bollywood/Native Mumbai Characters or Maumbaiya Lingos, with Pastel shades, which keeps the Environment more Lively. The Roof is Decorated with HandHolders, which creates a more Detailed Image of a Local Mumbai Train. They also have Sitting Arrangements inside the Building, but since I haven‚Äôt been inside, wont be able to describe.

Rating: 5/5

Drinks: We had 4 Cocktails, A Normal Cosmopolitan, 2 Golas (Strawberry and Kalakhatta) and ‚ÄúMumbai Matinee". Now to the Presentation: The Cosmopolitan was served in a Cocktail Glass, with some Garnishing. Simple but Lovable. The Golas came inside a medium length Wide Open Jar. Now to the Best Presentation: ‚ÄúMumbai Matinee‚Äù. It came inside a Camera Lens. And that‚Äôs where we call Innovation. In terms of Taste I had The Kalakhatta Gola. As long as you are having the Kalakhatta Juice with the ‚ÄúGola‚Äù it‚Äôs good, but the syrup itself is too sweet, so I had to leave that. Others completed their Drinks so I do think they were Fine.

Rating: 4.5/5 (1 deducted for the Extra Sweet Kalakhatta Juice, but .5 added for the Presentation)

Food: Brilliant in Terms of Presentation. We had 2 Dosas (2 mintute and a Truffle Cheese), Dhobi Really Big Ghat Chana Batura, Sharrabi Paani Puri. I am not going to disclose each of their Presentation Here. You yourself need to Check them out. Just a Hint for future Visitors ‚ÄúTake the Names of Food Seriously!!‚ÄùIt‚Äôs Veg Restaurant, but loved each of their Food. Taste wise also. The Phuchkas had filling with Sprouts, so Not Sure How, we Calcatians are going to Love it (Honestly I believe, no one makes Better Phucckas anywhere, except from Kolkata Roadsides, specially near Vivekananda Park) So our expectations around Phucckas are High, but these Phucchas Didn‚Äôt Tasted very bad. As Mains we had Malabar Paratha and Paneer Butter masala. The quantity were really Good and one side was enough for 4 of us. As Desert we had the Most Talked up ‚ÄúMadh Island‚Äù which is more than enough for 4. It also serves Chinese.

Rating 5/5

Service: It‚Äôs not 5 star Hotel Courtesy, we expect when we visit Independent Restaurants. But we expect a Personal Touch, The Warmth of Invitation and Mumbai Local Nails it. Simple Gestures like analyzing our Food Styles and suggesting the quantity (Not trying to impose more quantity, but to suggest in a More Friendly Manner), makes our Table Attendant, more near to us. MD Iqbal , you are Really Appreciated. Just would love to mention. One of our Friend doesnot love Chocolate, so offering a Vanilla Scoop to Him adds the Personal touch Magic. Keep it Up.

Rating 5/5

Suggestions: 1) Just Keep up the Good Work and only in sake of suggestion, would appreciate a less sugared Kala Khatta Syrup.

Food/Drinks Suggested: 1) I love Chees, so absolutely loved the ‚ÄúTruffle Cheese Dosa‚Äù

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 2) The Paneer Butter Masala was very Tasty

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 3) The ‚ÄúDhobi Ghaat Chana Barura‚Äù is the Best in terms of Presentation.

Overall Rating: 4.5/5

First of all would like to start with the d√©cor. Awesome d√©cor and refreshing. Then as we sat, we got an awesome service yesterday being one if those festive days. The team was very courteous and warm. The best part is that they were honest and suggested what we could like instead of items we were ordering and their suggestions turned out to be far better than our judgements. Then coming to food, the quantity is what I would like to begin with. If u order to 4-5 starters in 4 people, u are more or less sorted. Now finally coming to food, it was awesome n amazing. Great taste, presentation and if I don't mention service again, it would be unjust. We just casualty mentioned that the puchka was a tad non crispy. Despite we eating the whole thing, they brought a complimentary one. U guys rock and keep it this way only. No need to change but difficult to keep this standard and just maintain the same. All the best and great job...

I visited this place today and found this place to be a hidden treasure. The ambience first of all is wonderfully themed. But as it comes to food, I have to admit its one of the best, not only for the taste but also for the unique presentation. We ordered Shanghai chow chow dosa, sharaabi paani puri and dhobi ghat chhole bature with lights camera action for drink n golmaal for deserts. And have to admit the food lifted our spirits really high with their tastes n looks. Finally, the service is really good here. We were greeted n served very warmly n always with a smile by Md. Ahmed (I guess I got his name correctly). 
We tried only snacks today n sure to come back for Indian n Chinese soon :)

In a nutshell - Tasting Room -> Villa 19 -> Mumbai Local... this place has undergone numerous changes but the food quality has remained wonderful as before. I visited Mumbai Local last saturday with my family. In its latest avatar the place has expanded its air-conditioned area and also created a menu with youngster appealing names.

We ordered a number of items and enjoyed it all. They even prepared a number of dishes without Onion/Garlic for my mom which was a major plus.¬†

From their Faadu Items we ordered the Dhobi Ghat Chana Bhatura which was not only innovative in the presentation but also perfectly cooked. Plenty of Chana that we could have had another bhatura. Three out of four of the Khao Galli Dosa's (Truffle cheese was not called) were ordered each after trying the previous and all were awesome provided you were willing to experiment. Giving the extra sauce separately from a Maggi preparation was a touch of genius as it kept the dosa nice and crisp but gave the maggi its flavour.

The chote miya ¬†Paneer Tika and Dedh futiya aloo were also cooked perfectly with just the right amount of spiciness and zing. We ended up calling for a repeat order of both. The kids called for american chopsuey which was also well prepared. Only complaint would be that the noodles were too little in quantity.

From their special mains we tried the Rustoms favourite dhansak which came last but created a splash. The fried okra, onions with the dhansak and the onion pulao was fantastic. not too spicy, rich but not from oil and crunchy. If we had this earlier we'd have called for more of this than other items.

Finally the Madh Island dessert was great. I only wish there was a little more ice cream in it.

Overall the presentation of items is different and the combinations may be a little funky. But then that is what street food is. Mumbai Local has jazzed it up and made it restaurant worthy.

In main course we tried Mongolian which was first served half cooked but later replaced and made Perfect. Will come again

Settling for a late lunch with family, we decided to come here (precisely to tick off the wishlist).
The place as the name suggests is designed beautifully to depict the typical Mumbaikar life in a local - 5/5 to the ambiance. (Lil too noisy though)
The names on the menu to the presentation of the ordered food deserves nothing less than praises.
However, there are some dishes which might not justify the prices tagged.
Overall, worth the visit. Cheers management! 

P.S. Do sit in the open area.

The place was empty, people greeted us with smiles and asked us about our seating choices. We decided to sit upstairs. The place scores high on the decor of the place. The place epitomizes Mumbai in every way possible. The train, the locales, the posters, the wall arts, the menu - excellent!
We settled for a plate of vada pao, dhobi ghat chole bhature, and tandoori mushroom. Babaji ka thullu was served complimentary, giving rise to old school memories, where we would fight over choosing the pepsi flavors!! This one brought a smile to my face.
The food was excellent, no complaints at all. The tandoori mushroom was good, it was almost like eating chicken :D
In addition to this, they had an offer going on, as a result of which Madh Island was served complimentary! our happiness knew no bounds, an excellent presentation of mud in the form of chocolate brownie, ice cream, crumbs and chocolate sauce.¬†
A good experience! My brother was quite happy with his choice...good going team ML!

This food spot is situated in ballygunge where villa 19 was previously located. The staff is very welcoming good management. Saurav, one of the staff, was taking care of our order. I was here with my family and friends, had a good time ordering food with nice variety of food with good humorous menu set up and very nice food presentations. I personally loved chole bhatura and paneer tikka the most. And in drinks I loved "lights camera action".

After hearing alot about the place, i have to say it lives up to the hype. The place thrives on consumer satisfaction. Mr Iqbal is quite professional at everything. Alot of places have opened up like this but what makes this place better is the people who are ready to serve you with the highest priority. Would definitely come back for some light camera action.

I've had a very terrible experience with the place. Visited it twice and the guy at the reception was downright rude. They kept us waiting and paid no heed to what we had to say.  While we didn't come with a prior reservation, but you would expect a better response. I hope the restaurant does something to better the way they deal with guests, I am not visiting it anytime shortly.

I went to Mumbai Local on Dashami, the service was okay. The ambience is nice....full aamchi mumbai...giving full justice to the name. I started with the famous dhobhi ghat chana bhatura which was presented quite well, but lacked flavours. I also tried the vada pav, which had nothing special, one gets the same taste at goli vada pao at a much lower price. The ganga jamuna drink was good, made with fresh lime juice but it was not served chilled. The best item for me was the Mudh Island dessert which was presented beautifully and the taste was amazing. The refreshment provided was quite unique paan flavoured candy floss. Overall experience was not that good as I had much higher expectations and the food didn't taste that well.

Mumbai Local has been on my wishlist ever since it opened and I finally ticked it off this Saturday. Surprisingly we got a table there as soon as we reached even though it was saptami. The place has quirky and colourful interiors. For starters we ordered the kebab platter which was decent enough. Then we ordered the chow chow dosa and truffle cheese dosa. Both were really innovative and good and are a must try. Then we ordered American Choupsuey which was also nice. What I didn't like was the chola bhatura. It was pretty average ,nonetheless they should get full points for the presentation. The daal makhani was also nice. For dessert we had the Madh Island which was just fantastic. We ended the meal with the paan flavoured candy floss which served as a mouth freshener and was very innovative. Overall even though the food is not that great but the ambience, presentation and service all make this place worth a visit.

In the  Main course red daal is amazing the aloo dum is good and there are some new kinds of parathas. In dessert the chocolate pot is amazing. It is really great at the end the even give candy floss which is paan flavoured a really good and an amazing twist. Overall a good experience.

Aamchi mumbai..!! Concept of the restaurant is pretty different and a nice thought put to it but the service couldn't match up the theme, the service was disappointing. Food is good its not so great but yes the presentation of the food is impressive but it is said food can only be tasty if the presentation makes it perfect and the service of course but here the taste and the service was missing. I had ordered for sharabi pani puri, firstly the manager denied saying that its not available but the other waiter got it for us which was annoying but because the place was crowded so we did not bother so much and then we found a fly inside our drink so we got very upset. @My personal experience with this place was very disappointing but the food and the theme of the restaurant is pretty good though its a small place but the set up is nice. Its a one time visit place and would recommend the same.

The only thing good is the presentation of serving the food, but well it doesn't count when you've already had such a bad experience.

I went to this place with a lot of expectations, having spent a lot of time in Bombay, I thought I'd finally get a taste of that city here in Calcutta. And boy I was wrong! This place does no justice to the name or the concept. The food is far from authentic Bombay's taste.
Where do I begin? We ordered Paneer Tikka upon recommendation and I've had better paneer at Bombay Shiv Sagar. The paneer was chewy, rubbery and tasted funny. The only thing good about that dish was the picked onion served along with it. Next were the much hyped Khao Galli Dosas - HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. We ordered the Truffle Cheese and Chow Chow Dosa. Right from the presentation to the taste, everything was below average. Then we moved on to Vada Pao, if you guys are claiming that it's true blue Mumbaichi Vada Pao then you should know better than to serve it with sweet pao. It was just about edible, it won't take you back to Bombay. Lastly, the dessert - Madh Island. The dish promised a lot of potential but was just about average, the serve simply left the dish on our table and expected us to know exactly how to go about all the fancy equipment that came along with it. Very very average. In terms of food the only good thing was the flavored cotton candy you receive with the cheque. 


As far as the service is concerned, a big THUMBS DOWN. We were seated by ourselves for 10 mins before anyone attended to us, we weren't even offered the menu or water. Through out our time there the service was underwhelming. We didn't get any dishes or cutlery, don't know how they expected us to eat. When the food arrived they just kept it there and walked away, not offering any plates or helping us serve. 

The decor and the serveware are the only two good things about this place. Everything else was a let down. The wall next to our table was laced with spots of mucus. The AC was dripping water. The furniture wasn't comfortable. In a nutshell, I wouldn't recommend this joint to anyone who's looking to get a little bit of Bombay in Calcutta.

Service: 1/5
Food: 1/5
Decor: 3/5
Presentation: 3/5
Cleanliness: 2/5

Mumbai local or Villa 19. Bringing Mumbai to Kolkata. At the heart of the city lays one fine restaurant with great food. The interiors and walls are swept with Mumbaiya language and sights of Mumbai. Very courteous and excited staff. Good presentation skills.

Now coming to the food. We ordered crispy chilly baby corn, dedh futiya tandoori aloo, paneer, fried wontons and schezwan chow chow dosa for the starters. They were all absolutely tasty.

For the main course, malai kofta, dal makhani, veg jhalfrezi with breads in Indian menu and burnt garlic fried rice with veg coins in manchurian for the Chinese ones. The fried rice was delicious and Manchurian was a bit salty but tasty. Veg jhalfrezi wasn't that good. Rest of the items were fantastic. 
Dessert was up and it was Madh Island. The presentation was the best and you'd to literally dig into the stuff to beat others on the table to taste the beauty. 

Good.place to hangout with friends and families. Cheers!!

I usually do not opt to this platform for giving reviews about restaurants but since the circumstance experienced by me was unacceptable and  has to be taken up to the management. 

The incident took place on Thursday, 29th September 2016 at around 10'o'Clock. We had no reservations for the table but the response from the person at the gate, Mr. S.Biswas was really insulting and objectionable. He straightaway refused for the table stating its full and upon being asked how long will it take he said its not possible and kitchen will close at 10.30 PM.
I told him Zomato says 11.45 Pm to which he changed his words and said last ordering time is 10.45 PM.

During this conversation between the both of us another family of four members came and went inside. He did not even watched them going inside and so asking about reservation for table does not come into question. This particular thing agitated me and I questioned him for this to which he replied that " the security guard has checked it". How on Earth he could say that when the register was in front of us and the security guard just opened the door. After this particular incident Mr. Biswas went inside. Then again when he came outside, one of my family member asked him for the way to the washroom to which he replied and to my surprise that you've to go through the kitchen. Why would one go to the washroom through the kitchen and secondly i don't feel that it is the same for the customers inside. Since by that time i got furious and wanted to talk to the manager for Mr. Biswas's unacceptable behaviour  to which he said that he is not there in the restaurant today. 

Being such a trending restaurant in Kolkata i feel that the incident was intolerable and I would request the management to give an explanation for the same.

Prices of fine dining but food and ambience both make you believe you are actually eating out on the streets. Quantity per plate is very little. Food taste is equally low quality. You just pay the huge prices for the presentation. You don't get quality or quantity. Regretting spending money at this place.

We reached almost closing time around 3.15...yet they warmly entertained us. The place uplifts your mood as soon as you enter this " totally Aamchi mumbai themed restaurant" with colorful walls painted with bollywood stars and slogans. Full marks for the presentation of the food. We ordered Sharaabi paani puri, Maggi Dosa, Vada pav, Kali dal, Panir butter masala, Koftas, Naan, etc. The main course was better than the street food. We loved the desserts i.e the mudh island and the caramel custard. Drinks were good especially the Rasberry one and lights camera Action. The place becomes little noisy when full. Enjoyed the ambience and Selfie zones but found the menu little Limited in its variety and Overpriced. Would reccomend more varietyüëç.Staff was were  courteous  and helpful. The mouthfreshner Candytree with the bill was a hit with the kidsüëç

The reason for this rating started with the reservation experience. The person on the fone sounded disinterested (and sort of rude) when i asked him to reserve a table for 7 of us for 8pm. He refused outright.. and said the reservation would either be available at 7.30pm or at 9.15pm. Having no option.. I booked a table for 9pm. Thraftr I had to call him back within 15 mins to request to increase the reservation for a table of 11. His first and immediate response was again..."Not possible". Even though I understand his limitations... but thr is a certain way to put the point across. Not withstanding, when I reached the resturant at 9pm.. they accomodated all 11 of us. My rating.. 3.5/5üòë

We were accomodated on the first floor portion... the ambience was nothing to rave about. Though the old adverts and campa cola, gold spot, thrill bottles got the conversation going! The place (guests) was a tad bit too loud... n too brightly lit. My rating... 3.5/5üòë

We ordered a host of appetizers... sandwhich, paneer tikka, dahi kababs and vodka/normal pani puri. Other than just some fancy names.. none of the dishes were beyond normal. And despite requesting the server that all our food items needed to be non/less spicy... even the adults could not relish the overtly spicy kebabs and tikka... what to talk of kids. My rating... 3/5.üëé

The drinks that we ordered... fruit infused beer, raspberry something and beer pint... were just about OK. Lime kaafir cocktail was awesome! üëçThe downside was the "Babaji ka thullu"... which was nothing but six popsicles. üëéNow why would someone list popsicles under the Mocktails in the menu is beyond me!! It should have been a dessert... cos quite frankly... did they expect one of us to be sucking on a popsicle while others enjoyed their drinks in glasses/bottles!!üòë Super disappointed! My rating.. 3/5.üëé

N then came the wait! Ordered for the main course at around 10pm. The choice was very very very restricted.. with NO other option for dry/semi dry veggies other than veg jhalfarezi! With no food in sight till 10.30pm.. the server walked upto me and asked me if i wanted to order for anything more in the main course (no not snacks/drinks) cos the kitchen would be closing soon.üò£ I asked him to kindly serve what I had ordered for first before I could decide if I would require anything "more"! Haa haaa... that was indeed stupid! üòÇüëéüëéüëéüëé

Anyways... food was finally served at around 10.45pm... with rotis being the first item on the table! üò£üëé We had ordered for kaali-peeli dal (good), paneer butter masala (average), kadhai paneer (average), veg jhalfarezi (average), palak something (average). Again...despite requesting... the food was spicy. None of the 6 adults really enjoyed the meal. My rating.. 3.5/5üòê

The overall rating... based on all above and the final value for money... 3/5.üòê

I may not consider this place again. üòê

Regards

Mumbai local..  Is a pure veg restaurant located near ice skating ring.  The place is nice and cosy and gives a feel of mumbai environment,  the food is presented in a very awesome way and is appreciated by everyone.  The food tastes good and staff are also cooperative.

I had an outstanding time and a completely different aura right from the time I stepped in the restaurant...the ambience and the food was soo amazing that it not only touched my heart but also left me with an eagerness to visit again...
Food was well presented and excellent to have...every food had its own style of presentation....very innovative and creative...we ordered a variety of food the menu was well elaborated with both funky and cool names....
Although I loved the food but madh island (dessert) was my favorite....
A must visit...

Frankly the place is not even worth a rating. The style is which the food is presented is nice but is tasteless. They do not have a team ready to service. They take a hell lot of time even to give u a piece of lemon or an empty glass. If u ever plan to visit pls dont. Its a waste of not just money but ur time which u want to be spending in a jolly mood. Ur smile will disappear in the end as u will be repenting ur visit.

Mid week hunger pangs strike us again and we came across Mumbai Local while browsing for a destination which can satisfy our sweet tooth. I must say this place exceeded our expectations be it food quality, presentation or the warm service we experienced here.. our Server Mannu knows his job quite well and is quite equipped with what it takes to bring a customer back to his place.. 
The cherry on the cake was the dessert " MudIsland" we had.. It pleased our taste buds like anything... must recommended from my side.. do try it once..

The first thing that catches your attention is the entrance wall, very cool and quirky. The interiors are well done. The walls depict daily scenes from Mumbai local trains. It is very easy to locate.
The presentation and taste of the food was amazing. I tasted following:
Virgin Mojito: It was very good, it was nice to see that the glass was not half filled with ice.
Rapchik Raspberry: It was okayish.
Ganga Jamuna: It was very yummy.üëå
Bachelor's Mango Shake: It was delicious.
Vegetable Clear Soup: The soup satisfied my taste buds, it had a tinge of ginger.
Kebab Platter: Dahi Kebab was the best!
Dal Makhani: It was very good.
Stuffed Kulcha: It was very well stuffed and taste was good as well.
Palak Mazedar: It was delectable.
Mudh Island: It was the best undoubtedly.üíØüëè
The service was nice and staff was courteous. The white cotton candy, they give at the end; was very refreshing. Reasonably priced.

Went to this place for lunch. The feel of the place is very nice. The ambience that they have tried to create makes u feel little Mumbaiyaa. We ordered for Chhola bhatura - it was very well presented. The taste was also very good. We also ordered for a a Schezwan dosa and Paneer tikka. We loved the paneer tikka but the dosa was just average. The bachelor's mango shake that we ordered complemented the food very well. For desserts, we had Mudh Island which was extremely satisfying.

Nothing that great about mumbai locals.. villa 19 was much better off.. we had ordered for dahi seekh kabab, which was average. Seemed to be very very dry to me..! 
Main course we ordered for a mangolian rice and an american chopsuey. Mangolian rice was ok ok, i did not like it much. American chopsuey was below average. The noodles had a stale smell of oil, and gravy had peas which was tasting pathetic. Who puts peas in the gravy? I have never had peas in the gravy ever..!
Drinks were okay, nothing worth mentioning.
Went in with high expectations and cAme out with a bad experience.
Would not recommend mumbai locals to my friends. 
The place is extra noisy, only thing appealing is the decor and presentation.

I ordered Chote Miyaan Paneer Tikka, Mongolian Rice in food and LIIT, Lights-Camera-Action, and Rashberry Mocktail in drinks. The food was prepared according to our instructions and timely served. The LIIT was strong and well-made. Coming to the Raspberry drink, it was refreshing as they used natural-fruit instead of any syrup or fruit-crush. One impressive point- Extremely courteous staff and very keen in their service! Happy to visit this place ! :)

A much overhyped restaurant because of its extraordinary Mumbai style of presenting dishes. 
The restaurant opens at 7:30pm. We reached at 8pm and the tables were already exhausted. The manager gave us hope that we will find a table within maximum 1 hour, but we finally entered the restaurant at 9:30pm (there is no waiting area, so we had wait outside on the footpath for so long). The ambience of the place was simple with paintings of Mumbai shore, tiffins (dabbas) kept on shelves, etc. The place has 2 floors - ground & first. We got a table on first floor. The ground floor had proper dining tables while on first floor was cafe tables which have a height equivalent to the couch. We were 6 of us. The width of the table was so enormous that it was difficult to talk across the table. 

Food: The food was exorbitantly overpriced. Just because of its extraordinarily presentation of dishes, general food items also cost multiple times higher. 
We ordered 
Paneer Tikka Masala: tasty, recommended üëçüèº
Dahi Seekh Kebab: Dislike üëéüèº
Dal Makhani: okayish, nothing great
Kadhai Paneer: not enjoyed (though highly recommended by the waiter)
Lights Camera Action: innovative name, tasted good üëçüèº, served in a camera lens üé•

Everytime we ordered something, the waiter courteously requested us for extra time of around 15-20 minutes since we were ordering tandoor dishes. His politeness forced us to accept the delay though it had already crossed 10pm before our starters was served. 

After dinner, we were served a complimentary beverage called Bawaji Ka Thulu. It was delicious. We enjoyed this more than the food as it was fresh and refreshing. 

The Bill: As per the latest amendment under Indian Taxation System, service tax is levied on 40% of the bill amount, but this restaurant charges on the entire bill amount (100%). Additionally, they have also levied a service charge of 5% which means they have already collected the tip as a part of the bill. 

Another innovation for refreshments was serving candy floss, where the candy floss balls were hung on a tree. It was quite beautiful and delicious as well. The candy floss was paan flavoured with mint content, which also worked as a substitute for actual paan after dinner. 

Overall, I am impressed by their courteous staff and dish presentation but not happy with the waiting arrangement, food taste & billing system.

Went for dinner with a friend. The place was almost full with mostly families and kids. The place got extremely noisy by the end of our dinner which made is skip desserts. We had ordered mushroom tikka was was good and chola bhatura which was very average. The decor is quirky. But that's is all. Worth one visit but nothing beyond that.

If you are looking for an exciting vegetarian culinary experience this is the place you should visit. The first thing to notice is the interiors of the place. Total Aamchi Mumbai. Then ... The food. I do not like vegetarian food but this place has changed my take on vegetarian food and for good. The name of each dish is so Mumbai that it's enough to tickle ur taste buds and then the delicious food... The masala coke named Light Camera Action is served in a hollow canon lense... The presentation itself is so appetizing. I have travelled to many places in India , tried many places but this places actually takes you on a culinary journey.

Seems to be the latest rage. Found it highly over priced. Food was alright. Very oily and nothing great. Couldn't see the point of "light camera action" when one has to screw off the camera cap and drink masala thumsup with a straw. Just fancy names for serving dome dishes. Have eaten better Indian and street food. Extremely noisy. Not worth a repeat visit.

Just like everyone's been saying, the presentation is so good! However, it's definitely pricey and there's a high chance your tummy is still not filled! Would I recommend this place? Definitely once. Some dishes look like they're straight out of the Masterchef Australia kitchen!
We ordered:
Lights Camera Action- a simple mocktail presented in a camera lens glass. Tasted ok.
Raspberry mocktail- I don't recall the exact name on the menu, but it was their signature mocktail and it was really really good.
Sharaabi pani puri- five pieces of puchka sitting on a bed of smoke (dry ice cubes in water) accompanied with tamarind water and a dash of vodka. It looks awesome and tastes good.
Kebab platter- now this was disappointing even though it tastes good. No matter what the presentation, I'm not happy paying 550 bucks for 4*2 pieces of Kebab.
Schezwan Dosa- again, okayish. Nothing great about the plating up also.
Mudh Island- now this was something really really good. Looked Absolutely stunning on the plate and tasted even better!
Complimentary mini cotton candy balls with mint and saunf flavour.
Service was quick, nice family crowd and good music! Warrants a visit once.

To begin with, the mumbai local is the central nervous system of the state of maharashtra , iconic in it's very stature and unfazed by anything, to come up with a restaurant of its namesake is quite interesting.

The joint is pure veg which might be a bummer, the decor on the walls of bollywood films which were reminiscent of the "BOMBAY" swag are pretty catchy, from vaastav to shootout at wadala they have paid homage to them all. The old style lanterns and a huge mural of mumbai city add to the ambience.

I ordered the chowpatty panipuri which was served on dry ice with mint and tamarind water, it was a nice twist on a classic. All in all it was a nice and quirky experience.

Went here last Saturday with my entire family. Specifically went here to see what the hype is all about and also because my family is vegetarian so it made sense to try out a veg only spot. The food was good no doubt what good is food when you have to wait too long to get it. 
The service was below average and definitely didn't live up to the hype. Had to remind the staff a minimum of 2 times for a bunch of things. For example one time I asked for crushed ice and it took them approx 15 minutes to just get that for me that too after reminding them two times for the same. They took forever to get a raspberry soda. Food was arriving but the soda was coming post that 
I doubt I'll visit this place again despite the food being good.

If you feel you have not been insulted enough for the day, please do make sure you visit this "cockroach" infested food joint. (you read it right).
The service was pathetic, if they promote self service, it would be better, do not know why they charge a "service charge".
A mock tail ordered by us had a cockroach in it & "sorry" was the only word that the manager could say.
The waiter's response was " sorry, overlooked it, let me take it out". (You read it right)
Forget the hype around it, you feel degraded for the money that you are paying & feeling insulted.
AVOID, THERE ARE OTHER PLACES OR EVEN STAY HUNGRY BUT AVOID.

Any Mumbaikar will love this Mumbai themed restaurant. This restaurant doesn't look much from the outside but once you get inside, you get blown by the decor that the management had done to this place. Everything makes you feel that you are in Mumbai from the decor to the menu. The presentation of the dishes are best and the food is delicious too, portion size is a bit less. The servers are helpful and I liked the cotton candy that they gave instead of mouth freshers in the end. Also they give you the bill in the basket that says 'Waat laage gayi'  which was epic!

Madh Island is a must if you visit here. It's just so damn amazing. Total paisa wasool üòâ

 We were served by Ali Das and he turned out to be amazing. Very kind and jolly, and listens to you with full patience.

2) Decor is good
3) Desert is really nice
4) Service is good

Cons:
1) Taste is very bland
2) According to the prices the portions are very less
3) The staff(SUDIP AND MUSSADEK) ¬†asks you to review and give them 5 stars on Zomato and they treat you with free desserts. NEED I SAY MORE.

Everything about this place is just splendid .. 
Starters are a winner ! We ordered pani puri and 2 minutes dosa ( which had Maggi ) and both were fantastic .. Main course was also great ..
The icing on the cake was the dessert ( Madh Island ) .. It was just so oddly satisfying !! 
Five stars for their hospitality and prompt service .. Courtesy to the guy who served me .. Special mention to Manu !! Thank you for everything .. Looking forward to even better times !!

Well another kid in the block with molecular and fusion food.  I must say it was impressive and the over experience was good.  Starting with the ambience it was decent and neat.  The graffitis on the wall went well with the name Mumbai local . Coming to food , a usp for me was that it was all veg menu.  The dhobighat chole bhature , dhansag and panki are must try . The drinks were average not bad but not great either. We had madh island for desert and it was worth it .  The presentation and serving concepts were great.  Given all the facts and the trends I fail to understand why do they create unwanted hype . When we called them for reservation they said tables are not free and on reaching the place they accommodated us. Either you don't take reservations at all or you say that we have tables for walk in customers , why to give yourself unnecessary air. This was same experience with gabbars apparently brother of Mumbai local. As a food lover i would like to visit again and try out other dishes but as a customer I expect them to be kind enough to provide a table and not just act pricy.

Location-Ballygunge park road,few miles ahead of quest mall.


This place is located where villa 19 use to be.From the entrance and till the end the theme is kept entact.Along with the theme,the food is also served in a very decorative way.


SERVICE-The staff at this place is very friendly and themselves suggest their best according to one's starvation.The service is also fast reliable.

AMBIANCE-The ambiance at this place is relaxing and soothing.The interiors are typiaclly mumbaiya style.

FOOD-The food styling at this restaurant is at peak.Their representation will make you more hungry.Though they are overpriced in their "street food" section but other dishes are moderately priced.We had

1:Dhobi ghat chola bhatura
2:Madh island
3:Sharabi panipuri

Among them their dessert "madh island" is a must try while other 2 are overpriced like Rs 295+taxes each for "Dhobi ghat chola bhatura" and "Madh island".

Food-4/5
Service-4.5/5
Ambiance-4/5

This place is a must visit for having a look at thier food styling and interiors.üòâüòâ

I had walked into Mumbai Local on a humid Sunday afternoon hoping to experience the hype that has been going around regarding this place on Zomato. But the recurring thought after the meal has been of disappointment.

The entire business model of this place focuses on capturing the audience with a visual appeal (which to it's credit, it successfully does) which is unique and quirky with a desi touch. Walking in, it looks nice. It feels nice & that is a wonderful start. Unfortunately, for this experience to be wholesome, the food also needed to be of the same strata. Instead, what we got was mediocre, under seasoned & underwhelming considering how pretty it looked.

We had ordered a Sharabi Pani Puri and a Chole Bature. Phenomenally presented, but lacking heart. And when you take in how expensive these dishes are, the value for money for the entire place goes down. Shelling out close to 300INR for 10 pieces of Vodka infused Pani Puri does not make me happy, when I know for a fact that I will get tastier Phuchka on a street cart.

Service was prompt and courteous. But service was also inexperienced and desiring better training.

Also it is about time you guys put up the menu up here in Zomato so that the patrons can actually gauge whats to come.

Here's to hoping that Mumbai Local improves where it counts i.e the food, so that we can experience what this place promises to present.

One of the most over hyped restaurant in Kolkata at the moment. Super difficult to get reswrbations; however it's not worth going through so much trouble. The food is average and some dishes are bland. The only dish we liked was the vada pav. The desserts were too sweet. Apart from the food, the ambience is nice and the staff is courtese. I would not like to travel in this local again.

The first thing that one notices about Mumbai Local is the yellow and black graffiti outside with all Mumbai references. It's pretty cool. The walls inside remind of the city as well with pop references like 'Darr ke aage jeet hai, Dadar ke aage seat hai'.

Was amazed to see how popular this veg-only place has already become. The crowd, though, ranges from drinking and doting couples to big Maru family groups with kids running around.

Tried the super strong LIIT called Chhota Chetan. Three of them with a couple of beer pints and I was sorted for the night. Pretty strong for an almost family-dinner-place.

The food, though, is amazingly ordinary. From appetizers like masala papad, stuffed mushrooms to main course. The presentation is definitely impressive.

The staff is very, very polite, going an extra mile for the patrons' comfort and convenience.

There's no smoking room but it's not really needed as Mumbai Local opens right on an empty road in a residential neighborhood with decent parking space.

Music is typical Bollywood ranging from contemporary popular fare to retro.

All in all, an above average place that warrants a visit or two. Not anymore, though.

Schezwan dosa is a must try, chola Bhatura was good with excellent style of plate-ing , very creative. The Pav Bhajji however was a big big disappointment the bread was so hard and stale to even bite into. Drinks were good too. The dishes were served quite creatively.

What hospitality üëèüëèüëè could clearly see that there was waiting but where on earth a manager says "it's not possible" even if ur willing to wait just to try a new food joint. I mean who says that ? Could have given an estimated time 1hrs -2hrs waiting who says not possible at 9pm in the evening? Pathetic response ur management should take this seriously!

Location: If you're coming from Gariahat side, Just cross Haldiram Food city , cross the orad and enter the lane on your right hand side. This is located exactly where Villa 19 used to be.

Mumbai local is an all-veg restaurant and is the second venture of the owners of Gabbar's bar and kitchen. Like Gabbar's, ¬†presentation of the dishes is an USP of this place!

Ambience & Decor : The area is spacious and is a breather with White as the predominant colour. The walls are painted with daily scenes from ¬†Mumbai local trains! The transparent ceiling and Big windows add to the freshness of this place!

We went there on Rakhi and We also got a free dessert because one of my friends posted a review. Cheers to that!

Food ordered :¬†

Bhaji pav mastani - One of the most popular street foods has to be pav bhaji. The bhaji was served in a glass jar ¬†with slices of well toasted pav ¬†served along with huge knob of butter and onion salad. The taste was absolutely bang on and felt like we were eating from a local vendor, just better quality wise!

One two ka four platter : Different types of veg kebab was served with green chutney and pickled spiced onions. Loved it!

Madh island : This dessert was amazing! presentation-wise, a treat for the eyes. Was served in a tree bark like vessel along with miniature axes and stuff like that. This was basically a deconstructed brownie. Loved it!

Added bonus was the free dessert which was 'aam mile fule' .

Aam mile fule : mille-feuille is a French pastry technique which literally means a thousand folds! This is Mumbai local's take on the classic mille-feuille with a filling of mango inside. This was such a nice and refreshing dessert. Loved it!

Special mention : Mr Sudip, who served us, was very polite and courteous.

There is a thin line between "over-priced" and "expensive" . Mumbai local falls under the "expensive" category . It definitely impressed a hard-core Non-veg foodie like me. Cheers!

First things first.....been hearing a lot about mumbai local....seeing great reviews about it. This new joint has been getting all the attention in kolkata. After a horrific experience @gabbar's and this joint coming from them i was a little sceptical  about trying it. But to my surprise the team @mumbai local had a few tricks up their sleeves. From the chola bhaturas to the vada pav's & pav bhajji every dish was superbly prepared & presented.  1 thing i would recommend to avoid would be the paani puri's. Being a kolkattan by heart i really can't find anything better than the local phuchkas. The reason why i can't give mumbai local a complete 5 is due to their housekeeping. The dinner napkins were stained & also they need to be a little more classy with their cutlery. When the food & presentation is so classy why can't you have the same with napkins & dinner cutlery. Nonetheless 10/10 for food. Keep up the gud food !!! Keep making us happy ....üòÄüòÄüòÄ

This restaurant has replaced villa 19. It's located in the lane opposite Ice Skating Rink.
A different conceptual place which is based on the local food of Mumbai ( it's obvious by the name). The decor is creative, colourful and bright, designed to give you the Mumbai feel. We sat in the upstairs section.
Coming to the food, we asked the servers for suggestions, and ordered, the phuckas or rather the Pani puris, which came with two different 'paani'. Then there was a rice crepe wrapped in banana leaves and the bhel puri. All these starters were good. For drinks, I had a 'lights, camera, action' which was like a masala soda but absolutely tasty and refreshing. Then for the main course we had a Parsi rice dish which was served in a dabba, Kali dal, paneer tikka masala and jhal farezi. We had them with butter naan, garlic naan, and malabari parathas. The main course was well prepared, the paneer dish being a tad bit spicy. The rotis were soft and hot. My only point of complain that there was a delay in serving the main course after the starters.
We ended the meal with Madh pie, which again was delicious. We were served complimentary Popsicles which made many in our group take a memory trip to their childhood.
Overall, a nice experience.

Having heard a lot about this place, I finally decided to visit Mumbai Local on a Sunday evening. A nice place with lively ambience, it offers a good palette of Mumbai food. We ordered so many appetizers that we couldn't reach the main course page! Although the place gets very noisy and it's difficult to hear your own voice, the service is quite prompt and the food presentation quirky!

Concept wise this place does a good job of brining the feel of Mumbai to the city. Mumbai like Calcutta has been an important part of India's food story with flavors that are tangy, spicy and interesting to the palette. 
I went in pretty late in the afternoon and tried out their puchka, bhel puri, vada pav and raspberry drink. Frankly speaking through the puchka looked appealing because of all the smoke and the presentation but, it failed to beat the local puchkas of Calcutta by miles. The bhel puri too was pretty average in taste but, these guys serve it frozen which is one positive point about the dish. The heroes of the day were the raspberry drink and the vada pav. The vada pav with it's black bun, green chutni and red power managed to stand up to the expectations and same goes for the raspberry drink which was fresh, fizzy and pulpy. 
I think I need one more visit to this place for the main course and let's hope the experience with food is as good as the ambience and the service..

Villa 19 got replaced!! With Mumbai Local !! And what a welcome change it is! The ambience is nice..you feel you are outside without feeling the heat of the Kolkata weather. Simple dishes served so well most of the time you are gawking at other peoples table hoping you have not missed what others are ordering. Drinks are decent.But food aces both is presentation and taste. Arif and Manu our servers helped us make good choices. Paani puri was okay. The fillig could have been so better. The liquids too. Theatre cannot be the only reason for the price one pays. Paw bhaji was yumm.Dhobhi ghat chola bhatura tasted as good as it looked.truffle dosa is cheesilicios yummy.A must try. The kebab platter was good, which tells you how good the place is as kebab can be easily dry,mushrooms sad.but every piece on that platter deserved its place in our mouth.  The vada pav was excellent. Not spicy like those of Mumbai ! but a must must eat here! Virgin mojito was standard. 
The best part is they have so many freebies the popsicles ,the cotton candy at the end.leaves you happy.
Presentation 4.5
Taste 4
Ambience 3.5 we did make a lot of noise but so were others. You will like this place more when it is empty.
You gotta eat here!!

I have heard a lot about this restaurant so dropped in on a Saturday. I got a pleasant welcome by the service personnel who guided me to the first floor where I got surprised by the decor it was so cool. The waiter bhabesh helped us  choosing the menu and we ordered crispy baby corn, chola bhatura, lights camera action and a desert. Each and every item we ordered was served in an unique way and trust me guys you would be amazed with the way the dishes are served. Thumbs up to this newly opened restaurant and guys do visit this place.

Sad to see that you claim to be full when you don't have any guests seated inside. Just because your two seater tables are 2 in number it doesn't mean you should disallow other couples to come in or only have them wait till the existing two seaters free.

Ambience is good, plating and presentation is also good. What they lack is the taste of the food , we ordered molecular bhel there was no element of molecule (which would make it crispy) to it rather it was less crispy then the roadside bhel @ mumbai , the panki was ok , the cheese onion dosa was a lil extra well done which made it chewy .
The mamajis sandwich was good and also the madh island dessert was good .
The waiter kept on insisting to write a review on zomato then and there while we were still eating so that he can give us a complimentary dessert which was no way possible for us to do .
on the whole the experience was not so good as expected i find Gabbar a bettet choice .
Forgot to mention the mumbai speciality kala khatta gola which we had ordered it was no way near to the one we eat in mumbai . Second visit is doubtful or might take the kids for the madh island dessert.

This place is very colourfully decorated and the environment is very youthful. . Coming to food .. we ordered chawpatty wali pani puri which was really yum and the presentation was bang on, then we ordered beer sangria which was loaded with pears and was refreshing. We also ordered mongolian noodles , burnt garlic fried rice and hunan vegetables which were lip smacking. One thing that dissapointed me was the chhole bhature which was not hot and I feel the quantity was less. . Then the babaji ka thullu which is the ice popsicles took me back to my childhood days.. Overall my experience was good!

There have been restaurants with a better profile, and a more star appeal, who have opened, and gone kaput in a span of 2 years. The arrogance of the biggies went flat, this is a just a small restaurant with a cover of around 80 odd. 

The first thing that strikes you is the rudeness and cuteness of the manager!!! My initial reservation was for Wednesday, they called 15 mins before the reservation time to ask me to delay my appointment. I changed it to Sunday dinner. I received 8 calls from Saturday to confirm my reservation. 

We ordered food all at once because we saw the orders being late for others table. The wait was HORRIBLE. An hour for all the order to be processed. There was no one to inform you, and we had a four year old with us, who cried with hunger. The staff disinterested and not bothered. Only Arif was one who cared. 

The quantities of the food is so less, be prepared to face the foreign culture of one dish for an individual. 

The food was good. Nothing exceptional nothing bad. Nothing really spectacular. The only thing that stood out was the chilli onion kulcha . 

We also had ordered the dhobi ghats Chola bhatura. Which was okayish . 

All in all the experience was nothing great to have spent a good amount on.

Villa 19 is now Mumbai Local. The table space is and sitting arrangements are the same. Big issue is you have to wait an hour or more to get a table. Their is no proper waiting area. The wait was worth it once the food was bought. 
A very different type of food plating. Amazing display of food that motivates you till you cannot eat more. The problem is the food menu options. Over All for me good to visit once and try them. Second time has to be really motivating.

After reading the review in T2, went there with family to enjoy the flavours of Amchi Mumbai , but was caught on the wrong foot. Pathetic noisy environment , food not at all up to the mark and to add to the flavour , worst manager I have ever encountered . Not being able to bear the noise, had to get up in the middle of dinner and leave the place . 
Would have given minus review if given an option .There was a tag line written on the bill holder " VAAT LAGLI" and believe me they really meant it .

Came to this place the second time, first went back without ordering as the place was to noisy and Got a terrible headache within a few minutes  second time today as was invited by friends for a get together, did not want to be rude so came, it was as noisy today as well, I guess the place is done in full glass and the noise echoes and food was just average but the thing which bothered more was the doubt in the hygiene, the chola bhautura as try call "dhobi ghat Chana Bhaturs" is served tied on a string with and on artificial grass, which I can bet was totally unhygienic, as regular cleaning would not be possible the ambience is bad and if you guys carry saridon or don't mind the truly station ambience than you could try.

Went there today at 7:30 PM for the FIRST time with my family. The restaurant was almost VACANT. We were STOPPED by the Security right on the road asking to wait for a restaurant personnel. That someone, who came, seemed more busy with his cellphone than attending guests STANDING ON ROAD. ¬†He asked whether we had a prior reservation. When we refused, he said that we will have to WAIT for sometime although the restaurant was ALMOST FULLY VACANT. He then immediately again went busy with his cellphone literally IGNORING us. I wondered seeing this behaviour whether we are eating for free in this restaurant. We then immediately left the place heading somewhere else. Never faced such a COMPLACENT and ARROGANT attitude from any restaurant in Kolkata till date. Even a ROADSIDE FOOD VENDOR TREATS HIS CUSTOMERS BETTER even though he must have far more people visiting him than this restaurant. ¬†After all EATING OUT is NOT JUST ABOUT FOOD. I HAVE NO DOUBTS THAT I WILL NEVER VISIT THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.

We were 9 of us and had made prior booking for 9.45.
On arrival there was no one at the gate and we went inside the eating area.after waiting for 15 minutes we were given a table where only 6 of us could have sat.on asking the manager we were told that they are arranging but even after waiting for another 10 minutes nothing was done and we walked out
For me first experience is the last experience and I would DEFINETLY urge my friends to give a second thought before going to this place
To the management I would request that by merely opening a joint is not sufficient.your things should be in order
The rating starts from 1 so I have to give 1 as the rating whereas given me a choice I would give negative marking

Went to the place on a week day. Good ambience but the prices are really over the sky considering the portions which they serve. The restaurant should contemplate increasing the portions of the serving. Calcutta diners are very price conscious & I m sure if the restaurant doesn't do something over its pricing, I m afraid it will have the same fate which The Tasting Room & Villa 19 suffered at the very same address...üòä

The local train ambience and the quirky decor tries to mimic the mumbai local. But the food, which is a blend of both local & parsi cuisine doesn't really wow the taste buds. The vada pav & madh island dessert is worth trying. Service is prompt and price is reasonable.

HOORRIBLE SEVRICE !! JUST HORRIBLE. The food was decent but the service was so bad that this restaurant deserves a 0/5 not even 1. So we ordered a cholla bhatura, paneer tikka, dhansak, and happy birthday in dessert. Paneer tikka was good, rest all was decent. Now towards the end of the meal we asked for the bill, he didn't get it, we asked again no bill again. Like this we asked for the bill 6-7 times and finally got it after 45 minutes. We were so late that without checking we paid but then we realized that they had added bhel puri which we had not eaten. We told the waiter about this issue and the guy asks 'Should I bring the bhel puri now ?' Seriously how can he even think of that after we are full, have eaten dessert and it's past 3 o' clock !!! I ask 'Why can't you adjust it or something and pay back the bhel ka money' the guy is like 'bahut adjustment lagega , time bhi thoda lagega aap bhel ya kuch order kar lijiye na' . Hearing this answer we got so pissed that we got up and left, and also left behind the change (Rs. 90) and also told him to keep that bhel ka money (about Rs. 230 + taxes) .

The much hyped mumbai local, owned by the team gabbar's . Frankly the mumbai items like vada pav(contains lots of black food colour, give it a miss ), pav bhaji and bhel are not that great or even close to the stuff you get in mumbai streets. Also the puchka were ok.

The presentation was nice, the plating was good.¬†
The Indian food ordered were much better than the mumbai items. The black dal was good, tandoori mushrooms were good.¬†
Even the chow chow dosa was nice.

The drinks were served in different kind of glasses. It felt like ¬†I was sitting in a cheap rip off of the" Soda bottle opener wala "

The desserts were good the madh Island was good and the lagan nu custard was good too.

The service was good, waiter were helpful.
Per head it will cost you around Rs. 1200.

The name in itself has an emotional connection, having started my professional life in Mumbai!! The Mumbai Local is a lifeline that connects people and it's hard to miss if you have stayed in that city. It's about the buzz, colour and the entire activity around it.
That's the same essence you experience the moment you enter Mumbai Local on Ballygunge Park Road. The peppy, vibrant feel is a contrast to the esrtwhile sophisticated and chic look of Villa 19. Bole toh ekdum rapchik look it is now!
Coming to the food, I have always believed the hospitality industry and moved beyond just serving good, tasty food. It's about the entire package these days. And this is where Mumbai Local fetches full marks without a doubt. The presentation and the thought that's gone behind it is worth the appreciation it's already receiving from foodies in Calcutta. I tried the phuchka, bhelpuri, vada pao and my-oh-my you can't ask for more. Kudos to the team.
PS: I prefer staying away from vegetarian food if given a choice, yet you can't stay away from Mumbai Local. Must visit place!

The charcoal grilled vada pavs are amazing when u put the condiments and fried green chillies in the already garnished dish. The chola bhatura was yummy and oh so cutely presented. The murals on the wall as take you back to the feel on Bombay right here in Kolkata!! Quick service was an add on.

Mumbai Local has a very quirky but interesting menu, with dishes like Chow Chow Dosa, which was really a treat! Drinks and beverages were excellent, but was a bit disappointed with the main course quantity. The place itself gives you the feel of a bus terminal, which to me was a very fresh and unique. In terms of the quality, it was amazing and yum. Great place to visit!

The place is done up really well, the interiors are really amazing you get the Bombay feel here. The presentation is very unique and drinks are excellent I would have given this place a four star but I didn't like the food that much, will be visiting this outlet again to try other dishes.

At our office we have this pact of trying out a new eating joint every month. So today we thought of trying out a new place that's just two days old and actually quite near to office called Mumbai Local. As soon as we left the office, it started drizzling and soon it turned to heavy rain. But ek baar jo humne commitment kar di toh hum baarish ki bhi nahi sunte. The weather seemed to be influenced by the name of the place,¬† reminded me of the crazy Mumbai rains. All three of us wanted to try out this place because of its name, as we kind of love the Maximum City.

We were greeted by the manager and few smiling attendants. Smiling staff is half the battle won - not always but we appreciate their effort to make us feel comfortable. What caught our attention was the really thought after interiors. Har khopche mein Bombay se judi kuch baat hai. The whole place is quite interestingly done up. The walls have tried to capture the essence of Bombay with Marine Drive to Bollywood everything illustrated on its walls. Their hanging fire hydrant lights gives it an interesting look and feel.

When you talk of Mumbai, how can you stay away from Bollywood. You have all your favourite Bhais sitting on¬† tetrapod shaped rocks. There is Amitabh Bachchan from Sarkar, Sanjay Dutt from Vaastav, Ajay Devgn from Once Upon A Time and Salman Khan, the eternal bhai.

We couldn't even sing Imtihaan ho gyi intezaar ki while were waiting for the food as soon we were served Kala Khatta, Strawberry and Mint popsicles. We simply loved it!!

While browsing through the menu we wanted to stick to the appetizers...no wait they were the Faadu items, as the main course did not sound too interesting with Naan and Dal Makhani on board. So we got ourselves Taka-Tak Aloo, which was yumm and as the name suggests taka-tak spicy.
Main toh raste se jaa raha tha...main toh bhelpuri khaa raha tha. 
You'll miss a major part of Mumbai if you don't have Bhel at Chowpatty, so how could we. So we got Molecular Bhel that had chilled Bhel served with Molecular Mint Chutney. Next we girls went deewani over Bhaaji Pao Mastaani. Interesting, isn't it.
Mamaji's Grill and Pizza in Tardeo one of the must haves for the food lovers. And that's what made us order the double layered Mumbaiya special Mamaji's Grill Sandwich, which was topped with dry sev and served with potato wafers. Quite a mouthful I must say. But the list doesn't end here. Next up was Mushroom fried with salt and pepper...nom nom.
There's something for everyone here. How can the dosa lovers forget the dosas opposite MithiBai college. Their Khao Galli Dosas had a variety that included Mysore Masala Dosa and Schezwan Chow Chow. But the Maggi and the dosa lovers inside us got tempted and could not resist ourselves from ordering the 2-minute Dosa. Maggi Love Zindabad!! But the Maggi Dosa was a bit of disappointment as I thought a lot could have been done with it to make it more appetizing and interesting. But I think they wanted to stick to the authentic taste of Maggi. After having so much of food, we had no place to try out the dessert but then what came as a surprise was Cotton Candy in Paan flavour and the kid in us was oh! so happy!!
A Raapchik place to visit and must try out their Faadu items.

Mumbai for me was all about holidays especially in the summer break as I had family there. It‚Äôs a city I have visited all my life and food was always the highlight of all my visits. When I heard that there is a new restaurant in town and it‚Äôs called Mumbai Local I was quite intrigued. This delightful venture has been bought to us by the team behind Gabbar‚Äôs, so expect all the little Molecular Quirks and Fantastic beverages that have now become synonymous with dining at Gabbar‚Äôs . 

I had the privilege of being invited to Mumbai Local by the Management for a preview and set off a couple of evenings back quite excited. The interiors are wonderful ‚Ä¶. the murals on the walls make it an all-out Selfie Zone and the attention to detail really stands out. All the iconic images we associate with Mumbai are beautifully depicted. This place also has a semi-alfresco feel as it has part of the roof made with transparent glass so you have the best of both worlds‚Ä¶ air-conditioned comfort but under the skies. Even the Menu is worth a second glance, I loved the Mumbai themed drawings and all the quirky names the dishes have been given.

As a food enthusiast it‚Äôs always the food that is the highlight for me and I confess I had kept my opinion on this in reserve because Mumbai Local serves Vegetarian fare only. As the evening unfolded I loved my meal so much that even a hardcore non-vegetarian like me did not feel I was missing out. I was too busy stuffing myself with all the yummy food being served.

The presentation and taste of the beverages were excellent. We tasted a whole lot of them, the opening act called Bawaji ka Thullu was served up in a miniature hand cart and reminded me of the ‚ÄúIcy Pepsi‚Äù(not the bottled soft drink) ‚Ä¶. It delighted me to the core and took me right back to my childhood when this was such a forbidden pleasure. Rapchik Raspberry their tribute to Mumbai Parsi‚Äôs and Ganga Jamuna both of which were served up in quaint old fashioned ‚Äúbanta bottles‚Äù had a citrus touch. Chowpatty Gola , Lights ,Camera , Action and Bachelor‚Äôs Milkshake followed and they were great to taste. The photography buff in me loved that ‚ÄúLights,Camera,Action‚Äù was served in a glass shaped like a camera lens. 

The food followed shortly thereafter and our first focus was the Mumbai Specials referred to as ‚ÄúFaadu Items‚Äù in their Menu. We began with everyone‚Äôs favorite Chowpatty Pani Puri which also has the option of Sharaabi Pani Puri which was Vodka infused, next came the MumBaicha Vada Pav again with a twist the Pav was a charcoal flavor looked striking and tasted great ‚Ä¶. Loved them both. The Pav Bhaji Mastani which comes in a ‚ÄúDIY Style‚Äù was yummy and fun to assemble and eat. Mamaji‚Äôs Grill Sandwis ( it has been intentionally spelt that way in their Menu) took me right back to Aamchi Mumbai ‚Ä¶. and I already want more of it. But the show stealer for me was the Dhobi Ghat Channa Bhatura ‚Ä¶. fantastic plating and great taste I am  going to order this one again on future visits. 

We were also served from their Dosa Section that they called Khao Galli Dosas ‚Ä¶ the Mysore Masala was lovely and the Schezwan Chow Chow with a filling of Spicy Noodles and Veggies packed a punch. The chutneys that accompanied the dosas were well prepared.

By now as you can imagine I was stuffed but we still had a few things coming our way. The special mains have some unusual and delicious dishes and as full as I was the Parsi in me was excited at the thought of Rustom‚Äôs Favorite Dhansak and Berry nu Pulao. The berry pulao had lovely fragrant rice with a hint of sweetness from the berries. The Dhansak totally got the Bawa in me into overdrive ‚Ä¶ really good Dhansak perhaps one of the nicest I have had in Kolkata served up in a cute tiffin dabba with lovely Caramelized Rice and absolutely delicious Crispy Okra. For all my friends who keep asking me where they can get good Dhansak in Kolkata I finally have an answer ‚Ä¶ at Mumbai Local! We also tasted a Multi Grain Khichdi (in case you‚Äôre looking for a healthy option), now I am not a Khichdi fan but I really enjoyed it more so because I loved the box of Condiments that came with it which helped bring out many different flavors from the Khichdi , great for a rainy day.

Finally just when I was about to go into food coma the desserts came out and there went my resolve to eat nothing more. First came the beautiful, elegant Aam Mille Fuile which was delicate and delicious. This was followed up by Happy Birthday ‚Ä¶. totally lives up to its name and believe me even if it‚Äôs not your birthday you will feel like it is when you get your hands on this one. I will just add that it has cake and chocolate but I am not going to give away the twist behind this one ‚Ä¶ please go and order it and let yourself be surprised. Lastly came the beautiful and stunning Madh Island ‚Ä¶. Chocolate lovers be warned this one will thrill you ‚Ä¶ such a pretty dessert and delicious, the perfect way to end dinner. But wait there was one more lovely little surprise ‚Ä¶. Pan flavored Candy Floss which was really nice and was presented to our table on a little tree that you can pluck it from and pop into your mouth.

The rest of the menu has all the usual Indian and Chinese options so no one is left wanting. An ideal place to visit with family and friends for lunch or dinner. If it‚Äôs the perfect balance of fun dining on fine food that you‚Äôre looking for then this place deserves a visit. 

Mumbai Local has reached its destination. Go and board it so your Gastronomic Journey can begin!

The food and ambience totally lived up to its expectations. The vada paw, chola Bhatura and paw bhaaji deserves special mention.. It was lip smacking!! By far the best in the city. After Gabbars I was expecting out of the box presentations... And needless to say I was not disappointed at all. The dhobi ke ghaat chole bhature totally blew me off! The camera went click click! Stuffed myself with all the awesome food. Need to go back and try so many other things which I couldn't today. Happy weekend dinner! üòä

I couldn't think of giving this restaurant a proper rating...coz cldnt decide whether one needs to review the food or the presentation. I mean extra brownie points for the presentation, hands down. But aren't you suppose to serve food also....after all u re charging us for that!
Ok, may be I am exaggerating a bit,but one can't deny that the quantity is quite less. However taste is good and presentation - awesome. Firstly they serve you with Pepsi colas in long plastic pouches, like the ones which we used to eat in school days, they call it babaji ka thullu. It's quite delicious and refreshing. For food, they have a choice between Mumbai street food, we found those quite exorbitantly priced, (comeon- who pays 225/- for a plate of puchkas?) so we decided against it. They serve chinese and North Indian too, which we chose to order. The food was good, but the portions too lil. For desserts the manager suggested us to have madh island, which was simply yum! They give crumpled choc brownie along with icecream in a branch kind of a thing. Choc sauce is separate which they mix on the table with kinda gardening tools which they use for serving. Again extra points for serving in a specially different way. Lastly the bill comes in a " waat lag gayi" container ( trulyüòú) with complimentary Cotton candies, and the way they present it too u, actually makes u feel happy!
All in all a nice experience but they need to increase their serving size if they want repeat customers.
