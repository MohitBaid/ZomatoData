Located beside inox in the forum mall, this place serves a range of delicious platters. From Chinese to Indian cuisine platters you will find it all here. We tried the lucknowi platter comprising of murgh Tikka kebab, fish butter masala, peas polao and Kali dal. All of them where delicious but the fish butter masala was the cleaner winner. The platter is enough for 1 person. The fish tandoori was the hero of the day. This tender succulent spicy kebab teases your plate. Good place for a moderately high priced meal

The ambience and interior are good.
The manager was a very nice person and the food was really tasty.
Now coming to the staff, they were not professional.
We were provided with our food but they never gave a spoon or fork to serve the food.
Keeping it aside we had a nice time.

Only one word for this place - gutter.
Worst experience ever. I was out with family having some vegetarian members too. Not only they messed with the veg and non-veg dishes servings to each one of us but they also started lying to cover up the blunders. The chicken was served saying its aalu and vice-versa. Upon seeing their kitchen, i got the shock of my life that at a place of such repute the staff cleaned the floor with a broom and used the same broom to wash the wok (picture was attached for proof but it seem that the restaurant management is taking good care of zomato's management, so they are removing it and have blocked reposting, despite the fact that it is neither offensive nor illegal). Then upon asking to re-serve the aalu dish (as it was mixed with chicken) the second had a completely different preparation desite of the same dish being re-ordered. Lastly, even the darshan with ice-cream was served in a plate instead of a bowl, making it completely difficult to eat it. (picture attached as proof).
Overall, it was a horrible experience.

This is the adjacent dining​ part of privy lounge. 
Ambience : If you like peaceful romantic environment while dinning, this not the place to be. While I like loud music and if required I can shut the outside world and have conversations with the one I am with 😋
You can hear the beats of privy music.

Food: Awesome! Starting from margaritas to started and the chocolate mousse. Everything was awesome!!!

Situated beside the Privy lounge on the 4th floor of Forum Mall, this place has got some great cuisines to serve. I went there on my birthday with my belved one and we had some veg dishes. I ordered babycorn chilly and chilly garlic noodles for staters. The babycorn was only crispy on paper and not on the plate but the noodles was good. And then we had some nirth indian which was decent. The mocktails they make are awesome which is the biggest plus point here. The ambience is cool and the staffs are friendly. I liked this place.

Located in Forum mall, jus beside privy lounge. Tried their chicken drumstick which was good but could have been better. The mutton biriyani was really good, very tasty and well cooked. I did not like their grilled chicken steak so they changed it immediately and gave me a grilled bhetki with lemon butter sauce which was pretty good. Decor is nice, ambience is good. Staffs are very well behaved.

Had been to this place for lunch. This place remains mostly vacant after other restaurant have opened up here. We opted for ala carte chinese cuisene. I found the price to be little high and taste was nice but expected more from the price you pay. Though I loved their dining experience, it was more of a fine dining thing. We have better option at the mall so, you can skip these

When you enter starstuck there is a grand feeling about it. The interior is beautifully decorated (special mention - the chairs). First we ordered a large tequila as suggested by the staff at our table.  There was a 1+1 offer going on it.. Then we had mushroom jack chicken. And it was a splendid dish.. In the main course we ordered chicken stroganoff and pork chops. Chicken stroganoff is a dish containing shredded chicken blended with molten cheese and they serve it with rice. It was an absolute delight.. ( But may I suggest at the same time that it is not a dish for spicy food lovers). With pork chops on the other hand you'll feel a guilty pleasure as you gulp down chunks of pork fat.. 
Overall Starstruck really struck us with a grand gastronomical experience..  The only negative thing about this place is the price which is quite steep. The taxes really hurt especially during such ongoing financial crunch. Our total bill came out to be 2368 for 2..
But still I'm going to recommend this place to foodies on zomato as a sincere well wisher.

" ,.. well dats sounds sarcastic ,.. the interior decoration and ambience was superb but number of customers present there were so few , better not mention anything about that , may be because of the high price , people are reluctant to feed themselves here !! Service was good .Sauradip Nag

Rented this place and threw a party for friends family for my mom and dad's 25th anniversary. Amazing just amazing!Danced in the pub to great music enjoyed the ambiance and decoration. But out shadowing each of every aspect of their's was their culinary skills.Starting from the starters, reshmi kebab, chilli babycorn, paneer butter masala, chilli fish - amazing taste though chilli babycorn stood out amongst its counterparts. the paneer was so tender that once of my friends compared it to Rajasthan's freshly made paneer.main course:-
pea rice, assorted bread, mix veg, dal makhani, chicken lababdar and mutton kosha.
The mutton was so so tender and tasty the taste still resides on the tip of my tongue. chicken lababdar was just fab. mixed veg was not bad and dal makhani was Ok-ish as well.
Really nice cooking and great friendly staff helped me manage the whole event smoothly.
this place now holds a very dear place in my heart.

We wanted to go for "oh calcutta" but the misleading banner lead us to here the "STARSTRUCK".

This movie themed fine dining restaurant has nice ambiance but the place was too small.

Staff there gave us buffet and A La Carte menus we went for A La Carte.

We took two Breezers (30% off due to Happy Hours),

From their smacking starter we tried Fried Fish in Basil sauce. Taste was good but portion size need an improvement.

Hence we had no knowledge of their food before entering so we wanted to keep it simple so ordered "Mixed Burnt Coriander Fried Rice" with "Sapo Chicken".

The rice was mild taste and quantity was good. Like the flavour a lot.

Sapo chicken is basically shredded chicken tossed in brown and red sauce of their own. Taste was fine.

All of those cost us 1651 including a bottle of Kinley which cost 100 INR (that was too high like 5 times of the MRP).

Our server was attentive and his behaviour was good.

The place is nice in terms of the whole setup including the resto part and the pub part. But however the service is nothing very impressive. With a mediocre hospitality and high rates doesn't make you very loyal customer . Besides the pub is really small we were a group of 7 to 8 ppl and we had to really squeeze and some how manage on a small table due to lack of space . The private lounge room is available on booking only which we didn't know and that too it allows only one group at a time. The floor is just about for 6 ppl to dance at a time. Dj is average too. This place has potential but it needs to be better managed. It's ok for a private party for a small group. 
Offers on beer towers and hookah are a few attractions. It's a good place for youngsters learning to be a part of pub culture !

The place was empty. Staff was standing so close we could feel their breath. Wouldn't leave us alone, constantly interrupted our conversation. Gave me the smallest fresh lime soda I've ever seen. And it was diluted with tap water! Food was OK. When we didn't give tip as it is already included in the bill, the staff gave me back the bill and pointed at it. After that he would help us at all. He did not say goodbye or thank you nor did he hold up the door. No more Starstruck for us. We are taking our mony somewhere they are professional.

A very nyc and peppy interior with classy chairs and tables, a bit dark but that just adds to the glamour of the place

The menu includes continental and Indian and we tried Indian

The breads were exquisite, aoft, fine textured and grt taste

The curries were good too and the main courses did a gud job as well

Not very expensive as well

A marvellous one.
Situated on the 4th floor of Forum mall right next to the ticket counter of Inox, so not at all hard to find.
It has got everything from well decorated hookah bar to a restaurant with nice decor and ambiance. The hookah bar is all separate so no problem if you are visiting with your family. The hookah bar has got a nice charm to it and so does the restaurant. 
All my friends were non smokers so we opted for the restaurant.
The seats were real comfy but the corner round sofa beats every other seat in the room.It was just wow.
The service person were real good, and the foods were just awesome. From drinks to food everything was just deliciously cool.

Ice tower from cocktail is a appreciable drink..
In the starter crispy konjie lamb the shredded lamb pieces are over fried and not tender at all...
The dahi ke kabab dish was just not good in taste..
apart from that we have tried tandoori non veg platter, cantonese fried rice, murg makhani delhiwali (mouth watering dish) and sapo chicken which are really tasty and good items.. 
if you are with a gang then this place is good for hang out.. 
Behaviour of the staffs is good...

A marvellous one.
Situated on the 4th floor of Forum mall right next to the ticket counter of Inox, so not at all hard to find.
It has got everything from well decorated hookah bar to a restaurant with nice decor and ambiance. The hookah bar is all separate so no problem if you are visiting with your family. The hookah bar has got a nice charm to it and so does the restaurant. 
All my friends were non smokers so we opted for the restaurant.
The seats were real comfy but the corner round sofa beats every other seat in the room.It was just wow.
The service person were real good, and the foods were just awesome. From drinks to food everything was just deliciously cool.

Starstruck ,
For me i think its good for family dining.
I personally didn't find it romantic anyway.

The ambience is quite glittery.
Golden velvety sofas with glittering fabric and stones all over makes it look pretty and definitely goes with the lights and walls.

It was my birthday and i chose this place to celebrate.

They charged 200 bucks extra to cut the cake. Which I feel was weird because cafe mezzuna does it for free.

So anyway coming to the food,

I ordered -

• shredded chicken in red wine sauce which was spicy and tasty . A must try .
• Cantonese fried rice which had chicken and veggies  mixed along with  steamed rice . It was good as well.
• Chicken stroganoff. It is my forever favourite dish. Butter rice served with cheesy mushroom, chicken and veggies.
•  Con-pollo risotto -Corn-fed Chicken cooked with arborio rice and white wine which I feel was extra cheesy and not really nice.
• Murgh tikka kebab which was marinated with fine herbs , yogurt and spices . It was amazing and a must try.

• Chocolate brownie with nuts and ice-cream for desserts which was just amazing af.

• Caramel pudding with ice-cream.

• Hard drinks are mandatory on birthdays so haha !

Overall, food here is good.

Well..we went there on a thursday afternoon and the only reason for going there was that "oh calcutta" was too crowded. We were two and had non veg buffet. There were not much non veg there in the buffet. I liked only chicken in chilli sauce . Fish was okay. They don't even had non veg starters. The ambience was good.  The best part was the private lounge called " walk of fame". The price were not that high but I don't know why they charge an extra service charge, that too a lot.

I tried crispy chilli babycorn, murg tandoori and chicken strongandoff. Its was a finger licking experience. All were superb. Price is not too high. Its a great romantic place.

I personally feel this place should not be categorized under romantic section of zomato.
The decor is very retro bright a plush ambiance but the place of the restaurant makes it a normal restaurant not a romantic one.N moreova it is attached to the the side door of Privy lounge,so wheneva it opens you get to hear that loud music out of nowhere.

Coming to food was average not upto the mark,i went here on a date so the plush ambiance was the only thing that made us spend some time here,otherwise it had been a total turn off

I would like to visit this place again but not on a date fr sure :D *_*

This is my second visit to this restaurant for lunch :) Special mention about the decor, ambience and behavior of the people there.It was two of my friends' bday celebration and we took a b'day cake wih us in order to surprise them.Going in to the restaurant we handed over the cake to them asking them to arrange and serve when we ask to do so..They gave a candle along with the cake and a knife nicely arranged at the beginning..and after we have had our food they served the cake to all of us individually with equal pieces...for all these they charged Rs.100 that was to be given in cash while paying the bill.Newaz we have had unlimited photo sessions :P and the people there were nice and friendly enough to accept it and click some when requested :P :D 
Newaz coming to the food, at first we ordered Chilli Pepper Chicken and Pan fried Chilli Fish...Both were quite good n tasty..especially the Pan fried Chilli Fish..so we ordered for one more plate :) :) Next we shifted to main course where you will find a wide range of options..We were 6 in number and each of us chose different types of food according to taste..We ordered 1 grilled prawn , 1 Fish Monte Carlo, 1 Carbonara and 3 Chicken Stroganoff...I tasted all of these..except Carbonara..the prawns and monte carlo was heavenly...Stronganoff was just as perfect as one could expect :) :) .We didnt go for desserts since the b'day cake was awaiting us :) :) Allover it was very satisfying here :)

Located at the 4th floor beside the Inox booking counter, Starstruck used to be one of my favorite destinations whenever I was in the area. The new décor is decent enough but to me, it falls a mile behind what it used to earlier. The food is decent and so is the service but to me, the place has lost its charm and I didn't enjoy my last visit as much as I did earlier.

Still, a decent place to grab meals with any kind of company. Their rates are reasonable considering the prime location it is at and one can expect an expense of around 1200-1500 max for two.

In Forum mall, supposedly a romantic hangout. Well, good enough to live upto that tag.

Interiors are really blingy, nice seating. We went on a Tuesday afternoon so cannot comment on the footfall. But this place really has some good stuff to offer at prices considerable. 

Drinks- everything except draught beer. Same problem in many places of Kolkata. They outrightly refuse to have draught. Nevertheless, pints and bottles of beer are there and as I mentioned, at good rates. Martini Rosso was good. Every other drink was available.

The only thing I ordered there was pork chops, as I am a big fan of that dish. And Starstruck amazingly, delivers exactly what you expect. The  portion was more than just decent as two of us shared one. Cooked in the best way possible with the glaze of sauce, and not-at-all tough meat. Served with mashed potatoes, exactly the way it was meant to be. It's one of the better pork chops I have had till date.

Ambience wise, really exotic. As i said there was a certain bling inside. It was peaceful and romantic, really.

Service excellent. Polite and welcoming waiters. I would definitely hit this place again with my friend.

Very sad ambience, mostly golden all around making it feel very bulky and heavy, the upholstery is so velvet types and gaudy. 

Ok now to food, it very average and not that would call you back. The reason why you can come here is to get food if all better places are full and table is difficult to find without a long wait.. 

Not a place to be if you are a foody.. Thumbs down!!!

The first thing that draws your attention on entering the restaurant on the 4th floor of Forum Mall is the ostentatious decor and ambience. The place is themed upon old hollywood with pictures of marilyn monroe, elvis presley, charlie chaplin on the walls, plush seats and there's also a lounge adjacent to the restaurant. We wanted to order the mushroon jack chicken but unfortunately, the waiter told us that mushrooms were not available at the time.So, we settled for texas fries( french fries smothered with chilli chicken and cheese topped with jalapenos and pepper) which tasted tangy and delicious. For main course, we had carbonara and grilled chicken steak. The carbonara,i.e, pasta cooked in white sauce and egg yolk with bacon strips was deliciously creamy and on top of that, the heavenly taste of bacon blended perfectly with it. The grilled chicken steak with mashed potatoes was another gastronomic delight with the chicken,tender and marinated just right. After the sumptuous meal, we treated ourselves to chocolate brownie and nutty caramel custard, both of which were delectable. The place is a bit on the pricey side..a meal for three cost us around 1598 rupees but it's not a bother to pay more if the food turns out to be so good! A next visit isn't far away. :)

Awesome! Be it the ambience, the food, the decor. Everything gets a thumbs up, except the price, which is a bit on the higher side, but you can ignore that, as you get what you pay for. Low lighting, plush seats and match screening on a huge screen. Be it a romantic date or a friendly lunch, this place fits in for every occasion.

I had visited with a friend. We ordered two rounds of Blender's Pride 60ml for us along with sprite, and the food order included chilly chicken fried rice and hunan chicken, and I can tell you, they were awesome. Chicken was boneless, very soft, yet juicy. 

Our total bill was around 1800 bucks which was totally worth it considering the overall experience.

This place is a must visit if you are carrying a bit of extra cash and if you want to pamper yourself and your partner, or  your friends :)

Zomato categorized Starstruck "romantic" and I have to say thatvot amply fits the bill. Be it the location, the low lighting or the plush chairs; this would be a place for a date or a family dinner out.
The menu is highly diverse varying from North Indian to Chinese to Italian and Continental. We had ordered chicken stroganoff and lamb chops, both of which were well cooked. The lamb chops were meaty and tender. If you've not tried out chicken stroganoff and love th combination of chicken n cheese, you can definitely try it out here.
The staff are courteous and it's a relief that the waiters don't breathe down your back.

Well visited the place on a saturday eve. Much to my surprise the restro was totally empty.Then later I ralized that there was a private party going on in the Privy ultra lounge adjacent to Starstruck.So the place is divided into two parts.One is the lounge and restro on the other.

I ordered one 60 BP.
One starter(forgot the name)- based on chicken
sweet lime soda for my friend.
Chicken manchow soup-in the later part of the supper.
One Budweiser

Now coming to the Cons:-
The food is horrible.Overpriced.
420 bucks for a large BP. in Kolkata ???? U must be kidding me.
The soup was like dat kind of soup which is served in hospitals and places like that.No sign of chicken anywere.
The loud noise cuming out of the lounge will screw ur mind and u wont be able to neider eat nor talk to ur friends who are sitting near by.
The service offered was also not upto the mark.The waiters were busy chatting with themselves.Few of them busy with the private party.They dint even bother to ask as what we want and what we want to order.
I have to get up again and again just to give the order.
And last but not the least,their Card Swipe Machine doesnt work properly. I had to go all the way downstairs just to take out cash and pay to them.

One of the most horrible experience.
Never visit there... One suggestion to my followers cum friends......

Visited this place after a really long time... The dining area has changed and has become smaller than what it used to be.... Ambiance is decent, a big screen is a plus for sports lovers... Food was amazing.... Chicken Stroganoff is a must try....The quality of food served was just outstanding.... Privy, the lounge is separated by just a door...so everytime the door opens loud music rushes thru... Some people might not like this...bt for me, it was an add-on. Would recommend this place to one and all, and shall visit again for sure......

Star struck which is indeed quite a romantic one due to their sitting arrangement which is done pretty well. I visited with my boyfriend and ordered Kashmiri platter which included yellow/black dal, papad, chicken reshmi kababs and a dish of mutton along with butter naan, salad and pudina chutney.. I must say that all the items were very tasty.. Dal was tasty, kababs were tempting, very soft and yummy, mutton was very well cooked of which the gravy was mouth watering..the butter naan was soft too.we had hot and spicy chicken garlic noodles too which was average in taste. The waiters were well behaved and service was swift. The restaurant is not so spacious and ambience is average except for the seats or chairs which were embedded with stones look attractive. All over had a good experience.. You may try it out since food is no doubt tasty!

Went here once, and i have to say, i was AWESTRUCK! The decor is very pleasant and a suitable little nook for all the lovebirds in town who want to pamper their taste buds and significant other. We had ordered the lat mei kai and it's the best I've had in this town!  I just wish they would increase the portions of their mains a bit for the amount they are charging. Couldn't order any dessert the previous time, but looking forward to go back and try their sweets selection. One of my new favs. Kudos to the team!

Elvis presley, Like Taylor, John Wayne stare down at you as you get ready to pounce on the food that arrives at your table via the Elvis Presley Blvrd!  
The theme of the decor inside starstruck is essentially Hollywood. So we find pics of Hollywood film personalities adorning the walls and the kitchen entrance named after Elvis Presley. Such is the penchant of the interior designer to replicate Hollywood that one even finds two statuettes of Oscars awards resting on brackets attached to the wall! 
The main dining space of the restaurant is quite compact with maximum covers arranged in small space; the emphasis of the restaurant on the lounge bar adjacent to the restaurant being made quite clear. Having said that, I did not however feel cramped when I visited the space. 
The food is pleasantly good, so succulent were the mutton seekhs and fish time that it's kebab platter is worth recommending to others. I even liked the paneer makai methi though the Chicken jhalfrezi was a bit too gravy and sour for my liking. 
The restaurant, despite its preference to Hollywood serves all sorts of food from the eastern frontiers of Asia and so Calcuttans would definitely feel at home in this place. 
Quite an enjoyable place if one visits Forum mall and  wishes to have North Indian food in the confines of a quiet personal space.

The food at this place is really very good.  We mainly had starters from all the sections of the menu.  The vegetarian starters were really nice and very different from the standard fare available elsewhere. The cheese garlic toast was really nice.  The chicken that was ordered was (I am told) standard.

The main disadvantage of this place is the noise from the lounge / disco  next door.  Also the way to the washrooms is through the disco which is very dark and dimly lit.

The food was served quickly. However, the staff is not proactive about informing customers about the 1 : 1 offer on drinks etc. We ourselves ordered Smirnoff while there was an offer on Absolut that we would have taken,  if it had been pointed out. On the other hand , we were misled by a poster which we thought was  for 1 : 1 on draught beer but turned out to be not applicable. This is where the waiters can and should  really help and this is what distinguishes a good place from a great place. Starstruck needs to improve on this front.

Over enthusiastic staff.

The restaurant is super pretty! The lighting is just right for a date night.
The seats are cushiony and comfortable.
The food however is just plain mild although is flavored well.
I'm not aware of why I required too much salt(maybe it's just me)
The waiters were way too pushy for the order and just kept pestering in the middle of the meal which was annoying as hell.
Also it's a bit too overpriced.
Their dahi was without salt and was all dry and we actually had to pour some mineral water to loosen it up.
However they somehow are overly thankful if you leave a tip.
I'm just super surprised as to why the staff was so weird. Else - overall a nice place to visit with friends.

I used to love Starstruck but my recent experience was bit of a let down, mainly due to an average ambiance.

Located in forum mall, Starstruck is a pretty old restaurant and has been known for its good food. The restaurant used to be bigger when it opened but has been sized down couple of years back. Yet it could accommodate a good number. The decor is pretty nice and warm with comfortable seats. The main problem is conversations from kitchen could be heard loud and clear in the restaurant. On the other hand, the loud music from Privy makes inroad when the gote to lounge opens. The staff service is however good and prompt.

Coming to food, the servings are good with decent prices. I have only tried the chinese fare here and a few kebabs, all of which are pretty good. Love their chilli pepper paneer or green chilly babycorn. I tried the dimsum recently and it was pretty bad. The main course is lovely since ingredients are fresh and of great quality with great sauces mainly mild garlic, pepper sauce. The desserts are decent with brownie being one of my favorite.

Overall the restaurant is good but what lacks is that perfect ambiance !!

I went to the 'Starstruck' restaurant recently for dinner. It was a Friday night and the loud music from the 'Privy' lounge on the adjoining side of the restaurant was a real downer. A customer pays premium price for the ambience but that was totally lacking due to the frequent spikes in the music volume whenever the door of the restaurant would open. People visiting the lounge and the restaurant go in through the same entrance; customers for the restaurant then take the right door  while people going to the lounge take the left door after entering. However, the frequent opening and closing of the doors leads to constant changes in music volume and makes it very hard to adjust.

The food and service were good but we just wanted to finish our meal and leave soon due to the extremely loud music. The management should think of having two completely separate entrances for the 'lounge' and the 'restaurant' or simply remove one of the two areas. There is no point going to a restaurant where one cannot talk due to the loud music. I would definitely avoid this restaurant in the future as there are many better alternatives out there.

Very posh and classy place. Excellent service double thumbs up but the food needs improvement specially when the customers are paying a lot so a more better taste sensation is expected. Ambience is perfect to be with someone special.

Posh and Regal that is what describes starstruck in short in terms of their decor. It is a good place for a date but the food is nothing so extraordinary given its price is steep too however not more than its just opposite counterpart i.e. Mezzuna.
 We ordered for the shredded chicken in devil sauce with burned garlic fried rice and pork chops . The food really didn't come to my liking as because the vegetables along with the pork chops didn't have enough seasoning and rather tasted weird but pork chops were tasty..
The rice and chicken were good too.

Starstruck@forum was an average experience for me..however,I had great expectations from this place..it is located just beside the box office..
The ambience was pretty good..i must say some unique pictures are up on the walls..
For the starters we had ordered jumbo fried crispy prawns and Kolkata fish n chips..these both items were a total let down..perhaps I must say the main course was much better in comparison to the starters..for the main course we had murgh jhalfrezi with breads,chilli garlic manchurian and Thai noodles..
Howevr,I hope to visit it again for my satisfaction..

Simply admire the ambiance of this place. Its just perfect for a romantic date. For its breath taking decor I rate it very highly. You get to sit on that cozy couch with cushions on it. The combination of colors and lights will make you crazy. Food doesn't really matter if a place looks this good. You might be ready to pay for the get up. Ok now coming to food i would recommend their chiken reshmi butter masala with butter naan. I was bit too taken away by the look of the place, reason why couldn't focus on food much. That is quite unlike me since I am a big foodie. Well yes this place really got me!

This place I have been waiting to visit. Since I saw the pics and let me reassure you the ambience of the place is more charming than it looks in the pictures. Yes , I loved the ambience very classy, rich and well decorated . loved the chairs. Very comfortable. So u know u don't have to reach for the couch first.;)
As I entered the place I knew this is gonna be good. It has renovated since I last came in here and it looks very pretty. The chandeliers are well matched . overall u ll love looking around though its not that big a place yet good enough to notice the details. 
Greeted with a wonderful smile at the reception after a hilarious movie we went for lunch. The table was well laid not too overdone. And we were offered the menu instantaneous. There are various cuisines offered so u can let have ur mood swings. :) ( which I have often)
So we went for a garlic bread- it was one of the nicest, just crisp not overdone with lots of cheese.just simple.loved it. 
Then we went for con funghi risotto- its a  mushroom based one. Well that was well nailed too. So great.they also served a handful of extra mushrooms on top , well sauté.
Pan fried noodles- a must try. If u r a regular Chinese lover. Do go with this for a change. And add extra chillies vinegar on the top. It will give an exotic flavor.
Cosmopolitan- drink was nice . but I preferred a better presentation with that. Didn't like the glass .
Well the primary was the food which was delicious a perfect lunch. It actually was very filling. Tasty Italian.
The staff is courteous. Not too much trained as the place looks too sophisticated. Yet friendly enough so doesn't matter. 
Loved it would definitely go again. And would recommend a must go:)
Pocket pinch of 500 per head.

Very sad experience!
1. The service is damn slow. Even serving aerated drinks takes hell of tym. You basically loose the charm of having food. Audacity is with such poor service, they charge u a service charges ( yes, charges as well as taxes) of 10% !!!!
2. The entrance door to its lounge is from within the resto itself. Becomes so noisy that u can't even have proper conversation with others. I found this really really irritating..
3. I ordered for mushroom risotto with a price tag of rs. 350. The portion was small. Plus, who garnishes amul cheddar cheese on top of risotto? Very disappointing!

Would not visit it next tym even thou its location is so feasible.

Four of us friends decided to dine out and ended up being starstruck-ed. The ambiance was nice, except for the loud music that was coming from the Privy lounge, absolutely next to it. The decorum was extremely nice as they want to make you feel starstruck. We were made comfortable and took our time to order. The staff was very cordial and received us with a smile. We decided on Chicken Stroganoff, Spaghetti with minced chicken, Chicken Steak with mushroom sauce and Fish Monte Carlo. 

All the food took right time to be served absolutely hot on the table. The Chicken Stroganoff tasted extremely nice and cheesy, so did the Fish Monte Carlo, the fish was soft and melted in your mouth. The Chicken steak was very tasty as well, except for the fact after sometime you grow out of the overpowering rosemary put in the sauce. Mushroom sauce had ample amount of mushroom. I don't know whether the the overpower of rosemary was a mistake in my case. The Spaghetti tasted very nice as well.

The crockery in which the Spaghetti was served was very fascinating. 

All in all a nice experience. Would like to try the Indian and the Chinese once too!

I had taken a bunch of friends for my birthday treat to this place, through a groupon deal. We had taken an Indian unlimited meal and a Chinese unlimited meal. The food quality was decent with some items and not up to the mark in others. For example, the paneer used in Schezwan paneer was rotten. The menu said vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce and what was provided was chocolate syrup.

The biggest concern in this restaurant was the waiters who were not at all well behaved. They were continously  eyeing our table and moving to and fro around our table not giving privacy at all. The serving time for various dishes/ water was very slow as well.

The experience as a host of a party was very abd for me and I would not recommend this place for their unlimited deals.

High expectations. Low delivery. The only feature of appeal in this restaurant is the food. It tries to create an ambience reminiscent of the yesteryears of English cinema and music, but fails to do so. The adjoining discotheque with loud music (char bottle vodka) and shouts of excited revellers doesn't help. The contradicting settings cancel each other out. Coming to the food. For soup, we ordered manchow soup, which was fairly well, though one might find similiar soups elsewhere in the city. For starters, we ordered crispy chilli babycorn and Thai spring rolls, which were good. For main course, we ordered chilli garlic noodles, and chilli paneer, and I must say that I will go back for the noodles, though the paneer was cold and bland, nothing special. What I really liked the most is the darsan with ice-cream, which was there for dessert, and would recommend everyone visiting to try it. The service was sloppy, and not even close to expectations. Overall, not a very good place, especially considering other options one has, which offer a better experience.

I am seriously disheartened by the way the Customers are treated. There was some error in the bill and the weirdest part was the manner the situation was handled. My first line to them was do they have a camera. They asked me why. I then explained that there has been an error in the bill. I was replied that the person on the counter will not lie. I said that it means that I am lying. And they insisted and insisted that their person cannot lie which kept on implying that the Customer is lying. The best part was that though the amount in question was insignificant for me and for them as well, but still it got evident that they don't trust the Customers. Even if the manager Mr. S Dutta would have just said that he will investigate and shall revert, that itself would have been comforting for a Customer. The best part was that I have been a regular customer since last 3 to 4 years and stay just opposite the place but even then he kept on insisting that their person cannot lie which means that the Customer is lying which was extremely extremely disheartening. I doubt if I will revisit Star Struck again. Very bad and disheartening experience.

Well, my experience to Starstruck located in the glamorous Forum Mall has always been great. Service is fast ans waitors are helpful, well equipped and they know their job well. During the heavy rush hours also, they never make any person be unattended or wait for a long time. Food is very delicious be it, Indian or Chinese. I enjoy having pan fried noodles there with Sapo chicken n in Indian I like to have the platters, esp Kashmiri Platter. In the Platter, they give sufficient amount of food. Ambience of the restaurants deserve compliment. And yes, it is pocket friendly. But table reservation is always recommended esp when you plan to dine on a fine weekend. Except that they have narrowed their restaurant but you must visit this place, it gives you altogether a nice experience. :)

Tried Fish n Chips, Grilled Prawns and Chicken Stroganoff. While Grilled Prawns and Chicken Stroganoff tasted great, the fish n chips was bit of a letdown. Cozy ambiance, moderate service, price is a bit on the higher side. Most importantly this is the only decent restaurant in Forum mall which remains open for lunch even after 3pm. So if you are out late after watching a movie, go for it.

One of the few places in kolkata which I feel is worth the price they charge.
I have been to this place couple of times and the experience has been thoroughly satisfying.Not only is their quality of food top notch but also service very nice and prompt.The food is served in huge portions which is rare to see.
I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.
A suggestion to the management teams please do something about the music which comes from your adjacent hookah bar.At times it becomes quite a pain.

I was literally star struck with the exteriors of this particular restaurant while waiting in line for movie tickets. What had caught my attention further was the availability of lunch buffet at an extremely low price of 400 rupees. This was quite a while back, and I am not sure about the buffet availability currently. The buffet served a mix of Indian and Chinese with an option of a brewed drink or fresh lime soda. While two of my friends chose the later, the rest of us settled for a carlsberg pint. 

All set and gorging on starters, something extremely funny happened which etched this lunch in my memories. I was a few sips of beer down and suddenly saw and felt the glasses, plates and tables shaking hard. When I laughed at my insanity, my friends complied and said it was not a result of the beer and that even they could feel it. After a good whole minute of being awe'struck', we came to know there was an earthquake. -_-  

Keeping apart the hilarity of this particular lunch, the food from the starters to the maincourse were pretty good. Not unbelievably awesome but good enough. For the price we were paying, we thought it was a well laid out buffet with four starters and maincourse, respectively. The desserts were extremely disappointing though. There were two to three desserts, all bordering on below average quality. 

After venturing at Starstruck, the starry, striking aspect of it died. All in all, it is a simple, decent restaurant in the otherwise flamboyant Forum mall.

Starstruck @ Forum Mall serves a good variety of food and I enjoy dining their when I go to catch a movie as its on the same floor as the box office. Personally I prefer the Chinese and Continental food but the Indian is pretty decent too. The owner Bunty Sethi has been a part of the food scene for many years and has backed a number of restaurants and nightclubs in the city. The ambiance of this place is decent but was much better in its earlier avatar but the food is pretty good. In the Chinese section the Chilly Prawn Singapore Style , Santung Prawn , Chilly Pepper Chicken,  Lat Me Kai and Crispy Chilly Potato or Baby Corn are all very good so you can take your pick. For the mains I love the Pan Fried Noodles but all the Rice and Noodle dishes are good. From the Continental Section try the Cheese Balls or the Cheesy Garlic Mushrooms both of which are nice to munch on. Go on do order the Carbonara or Chicken Steak with Pepper Sauce. Since its a sister concern of Privy they have a decent bartender so you can go ahead and enjoy a cocktail or two if your so inclined.

Starstruck is a good multi-cuisine option at Forum Elgin Road .... though they have cut back on the size of the restaurant to open a lounge bar Privy a few years back .... they have thankfully not cut back on the menu . They serve fairly good Chinese, Indian and Continental Food. In Chinese try the Santung Prawns and Crispy Chiken in Honey Sauce along with the Pan Fried Noodles. In Indian I enjoy the Non - Veg Tandoori Platter.  As far as continental food goes their Cheese Garlic Mushrooms, Con Pollo Risotto and Grilled Prawn Alfredo are very good.

Had a quiet and lovely lunch at the place yesterday.Due to time-shortage,couldn't order more than a Chicken Cantonese Noodles and Prawn in Chilly Oyster Sauce both of which were well-known cooked, especially we loved the prawn. The prices  a bit on the higher side compared to the quantity of served,and the only minus point. The best thing about the place is the warmth and cordial reception of the staff. Wish to visit the place in future.

Starstruck has been a favourite haunt of mine ever since it opened it's doors. The place is 'different' not only because of it's decor but also because of the quality of food and beverages it serves. You can tell it spares no expense to bring it's customers the best. The same goes for the Privy Ultra Lounge which it has opened a year or so ago. Another attribute which sets it apart is periodically it re-invents it's decor and menu. I believe that is a very laudable attribute in a restaurant.

On our recent trip we ordered the Santung Prawns, Chicken Lat Me Kai, Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Paneer Tikka for starters and Chicken Steak in pepper sauce and Mixed Kebab Platter for the main course. The food did not disappoint! The starters were extra-ordinary - especially the Santung Prawns. However, the Chicken Steak wasn't upto the mark as far as preparation of the chicken itself was concerned...it hadn't been tenderised enough. I also missed the wonderful Pizzas they used to have, on the Menu. I would also advise them to expand their continental menu.

I would go back to this restaurant again and again and would definitely recommend it to my readers.

It was quite by chance that we happened to be there for a movie at the Forum when my eyes struck upon this small but cosy restaurant called the Starstruck.It is sort of adjacent to Oh Calcutta,  on the 4th floor of this building.The walls of the restaurant had  been adored with portraits/photographs & posters of cine /rock stars & the idols of the present day youngsters!Since we had some time at hand I asked my wife & son if they wanted to have a quick bite & upon their nod we stepped inside.I asked the steward what he had to suggest in the Chinese section  for a quick meal. Well as as suggested we tried the Lemon Coriander Soup with chicken and was really impressed with it.It was followed by Crispy Fried Chicken with honey  in a tangy sauce( real yummy stuff!) and for the main course we had Pan Fried Chilli Fish with Mixed Cantonese Chowmein !
I was really impressed with their food as well as the service which was quick enough (actually I had informed the waiter regarding the movie tickets which was already booked & we could afford around 45 minutes & it was a precondition! )
The price was a little on the higher side but nevertheless the quality of food made up the pocket-pinch feel factor!Well  when you are spending a good 900 bucks on a movie then 1500/- is fine for a good  meal!

Well this place failed to impress me. This one is located inside 'Forum' mall Elgin road. The location is great but the place a real turn off. To start with prices are very high and the taste definitely not worth it. The 'Continental' is quite bland and  'Mughlai' do not even think of trying. Though the longe there is quite nice and you can have  a chilled out time there but the restaurant very disappointing. The quantity is also nothing much. 
After having disappointing meal when the bill comes you feel like slapping yourself for going so wrong. Their rice noodles even sucks, what a shame. 
anyway if you are too curious you can try out the place. Only the ambience of the place is well done and deserves appreciation.

Starstuck in Forum serves Indian,Chinese and Continental.Though i never tried their continental dishes but i had the other two on my visits over the years !! Lets talk about their Indian dishes first..I found their kaali daal to be really sumptuous and authentic.The naans or rotis to accompany it are good enough. The hara tawa kebab and reshmi are made to perfection.On chinese front,the soups are delicious.One can try out their basil soup or the coriander one.Its healthy and is truly a gastronomic delight.Crispy chicken in sauce of your choice among starters is a nice option.Chinese main course dishes are equally well-made.They also offer different platters to choose from-lucknowi ,hyderabadi and all.The place is well decked up and is perfect for a soothing lunch or dinner.I would give it a 4...!!

Good place with good food. I prefer their Indian over Chinese. The portions are generous too.A bit over-priced, bit I guess that's 'coz the owners must be paying a pretty handsome rent to the Mall owners.

All in all... good value for money.

Absolutely smashing ambience with mouthwatering food but unreasonable prices. Service is courteous and quantity is fine. The most i like is the north indian cuisine here. Whenever i go there i go to timbaktoo before having lunch or dinner. Whenever i go there i always have to keep on waiting for 5 minutes cause of seats remain full but from outer windows it looks like it is empty. Its a nice place for visiting once in 2 months with filled pockets. Gonna rate it 5 stars just for the mesmerizing  ambience.

Excellent food, great decor. Tables are well laid out and I like the seating arrangements. It is definitely a cool place to hang out or if you need to impress someone. What I love the most aside from the decor and ambience is the fact that right next door there is a lounge bar you can go for a drink or two after dinner.

One flaw this place has is the price tag. I find that the food quality falls short of the price. Therefore, logic derived that one is really paying for the ambience. However, I believe that for ANY restaurant the food should come first. With a bit more effort on the right area, this place can be a 5 star.

Have visited the place twice and did come out wid a smile. I went back only cos of its ambiance. Love the seating arrangement,very well maintained. Its one of those places whr you can sit n chill anytime. Yes prices are high but such places dont come for cheap. The only thg i disliked was the food which were overpriced in terms of quantity n quality.

Other than that totally worth it.

1. Very expensive 5 star prices - not sure if this is a five star restaurant. A quality restaurant though.
2. A multi cuisine menu for the experimental. Some good dishes are here. A small mix of indian is thrown into the non-indian dishes.
