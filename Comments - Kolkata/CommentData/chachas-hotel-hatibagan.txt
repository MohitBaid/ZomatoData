I have a question. Since zomato shows here the restaurant opens at 12noon, so in that case my query is from when I'm going to get the Chinese preparation of chili chicken n friedrice available at the counter? I need the time. It's urgent. Please someone help me out. Thank you.

Well this is probably among the oldest established eateries in North Calcutta...folks who hv their grandparents previously resided in the North might hear about the fame and popularity that was once Chacha proud of.well nowadays this eatery is a place serving chinese and indian delicacies but this place thrives on their mughlai and fry food items which are still favourites among mainly middle aged and elderly age groups.If you happen to visit this place i would definitely suggest the ever mouthwatering Chicken mughlai to gorge on...

An age old restaurant that has been standing tall since decades and generations. I had literally grown up seeing this restaurant flourish, excel and ultimately fall in its set standards of quality. Every single occasion in our house would be celebrated with food from Chacha. Previously it was on the other foot where the Vivekananda house is now located. During the construction of the Vivekananda property, the restaurant shifted to the opposite side of the road, became bigger in terms of number of floors and air conditioned interiors. Unfortunately the quality and taste took a major downfall after the renovation. Fowl cutlet, mutton sheek kebabs, chinese preparations were too good in the earlier days. Now its just another below average restaurants which you may wanna give a miss, given newer and better options at hatibagan area. Service is also slow and the staff are  not too friendly. Its sad to see a renowned restaurant go downhill over the years.

Heritage married Modern Era. Yes it's indeed. A.C. Restaurant with the View of Bidhan Sarani. Taste still takes one to the bygone era of Old Kolkata. One will get the smell of coarsely grind black pepper in the fowl cutlet. Price even in today it's really low. No Taxes, only one need to what is mentioned in the menu card. Very swift service. I must say it's a must visit place.

A Visit in Durga Puja 10smi..This awful place is Located at Vivekananda Road, just opposite to Vivekananda house.
Talk about a worst experience in a restaurant so you dont need to go anywhere than this place.
I can understand that in puja the food quality and service has a set back but when you are served cold hence stale food at your table then definitely you have all sort of right to get angry. And i was served with the above said Biryani.
Now talk about the service. When guys from slum area runs a restro then what more you can expect from them. When i asked them to correct the AC temperature which was 28 degree the in charge person ignored me and ran away. When i asked the waiter for onion or onion salad he said "Onion nahi hoga". I mean what the hell, why are you running this place????
Asked for water so many times and they are so ignorant to see that. When asked for a quarter plate the guy was so lazy to provide it. I asked him whats wrong and his reply was even pathetic than he was " i am doing the same thing for the ¬†past 6 puja days". Lol i mean you go and sleep at your home, stop working.

I recommend this place should shut down before they get some kicking...

Chacha's hotel has been aged and turned into grandfather's hotel in 2k17. After such a long years of deliberate service to the people of North Kolkata this hotel is now a strict no no for the foodies. The quality of the food has dropped drastically since my childhood and the service is super slow. I wish I could write a better review on Chacha's hotel because it's much linked to my childhood memories at my school-para!

I am sorry that I can't give more than that(1.5*).
The list of cons-
1. They don't have sufficient menu card. You have to wait for your turn to have a look at the menu card.
2. In sufficient members. They don't know when to clean the table, when to serve the water.
3. The service persons even don't know about the quantity of the dishes they are taking orders.
4. The quality of food is very bad.
I am really sorry that I haven't find any pros about the place.

LOCATION: It is situated right in the heart of North Kolkata just bang opposite swami Vivekananda's house in Shimla road.
AMBIENCE: For a restaurant as old as this the ambience is ho hum. But there is room for lots of improvement. The excessive low lighting should be changed. Also the hygiene can be improved. But the bay windows provide a nice touch to the decor.
SERVICE: It nothing to write home about but there is scope for improvement. Also they served the main course before the entre.
MENU: It offers multi cuisine food at dirt cheap prices but the main focus is on mughlai food.
FOOD: The fowl cutlet was good with just a dash of pepper in it providing a nice after taste. But it was a little too dry for me. The chicken biriyani was good with the rice , potato & egg cooked perfectly. The chicken piece was huge but again was a tad too dry.

One of the old restaurant in Kolkata servicing since 1895. It's a heritage of Kolkata. Once it was a renowned restaurant for Chinese food. Since 3 generation we are going to taste the delicious food. Last time we visited near about before 6 years.
Recently a get together arranged and we decided to have Chinese in our dinner. To have delicious Chinese in medium budget I suggested one and only chacha as per my previous experience.
But I have totally disappointed when I visited there around 9. No starters are available unless cutlets. So We have taken fowl and kabiraji. Kabiraji is average and fowl is no no. Now for main course. I have surprised when I came to know chowmin is unavailable. Mixed fried rice is unavailable. Only chicken fried rice available. And there is rare to find chicken. At last we completed our main course with chicken rice and chilli chicken. We are not dare to go towards deserts.
A worse servicing I faced there. Only 1 person servicing 7 tables. He tried to serve us best but alas.
It is not a good experience for us to have dinner there after 6 years. I felt like heaven and hell.
I expect they overcome there fault and/or reach to heaven soon.

We ordered mixed Hakka noodles, mixed fried rice and hot garlic fish. It was good to see that they have really kept up the tradition of serving generous quantity of food. The noodles tasted good but it could have been better, the rice was tasty as well as the fish. I was satisfied by the food.

W¬†hen you are with your school buddies and blessed with plenty of time, you ought to try nuisances which become fond memories. One those sudden outings, we were spending time around Bidhan Sarani having no fixed plans in time. By the time of lunch, we were around Ramkrishna Mission Institute possibly trying to enquire about foreign language courses. Coming out of it, we realised that we were hungry and thus jumped at nearest possible location.

Chacha's Hotel is an old eatery generally has a positive name around the area. Though being old, it had successfully renovated itself to be at par with the time. It is located on Maniktala Crossing and has an attractive red board with white LED lights inscribed along its name. Hoping to have fun, we entered the upper floor dining area.

Upon entering the room, we felt an awkward ambiance soon realising that the AC isn't on. I request then to switch it on and they nodded signalling in positive and seemed to search for the remote. We made ourselves seated for 5 minutes waiting for the menu or glass of water to arrive. But, there were no sign of people and even the sole guy who were attending us went into hiding, possibly in search for a new AC! However, after fifteen minutes of turmoil, a guy arrived with a menu and as we jumped into picking our item, he interrupted us. Bluntly standing, he informed that that few items won't be available today. We nodded at his figure of speech and gave an order. He informed that all the items we mentioned aren't available. Startled, we asked them to pinpoint the items available and he pointed at two or three items. Not quite liking the items which they made available, we decided to leave.

The most intriguing point was that, the people didn't switch on the AC, nor provided us with glass of water, neither asked us to try any item out of those citing that it will be cherishing. It was almost as if they didn't want customer and hence I am greatly disappointed.

A visit is never to be experimented with!

My first experience with Bengali food in one of the classic age old restaurant. And I would say it was not so good but not too bad either. 

The place might look too old and a bit low on cleanliness. Which you might have to bear. And the service time was also too long, given we were the only people in the restaurant. 

We had all standard Bengali special. Fish Cutlet, Mutton Cutlet. Mutton Biriyani. Cutlets were good in comparison to several other restaurants I tried. The Biriyani was very different for me as I am from South and the style of cooking is new to me. It was very dry but I enjoyed. I had another dish( forgot name) where the fish fry was covered with egg omelet and it was good too. 

Overall, I would say a nice place to try nominally priced dishes..

They have expanded the place quite well. Done in shades of red, the name is vivid from afar. Tried their famous fowl cutlet and fish fry. Was not disappointed. Prices are reasonable. The size is good and the meat nicely done with the stuffing. Parking is a problem, try and visit a little late in the evening!

Visited this restaurant for the first time last evening. Spread over three floors this restaurant is one hundred and forty five years old. We were asked to go to the second floor and we ordered for the speciality dish Fowl cutlet. It was a chicken cutlet which had an unusual shape and taste. The flavour of garam masala gave a different taste to an otherwise clich√©d dish. The kasundi and salad provided along enhanced the experience of eating the dish even better. I got a fish fry packed for my mother and the best part was it didn't turn soggy. Very  good variety of bhetki fish has been used to make the fry and it was delicious. I Regretted not getting few more fries. The ambiance and service is average. They also have a wide variety of Chinese menu along with tandoor. We also got room Ali roti for dinner and it was nice and didn't get soggy. The price is reasonable and can be visited once in a while.

This restaurant is situated right opposite to Swami Vivekananda's house and is easy to locate if you are in the area. It's a very old and famous restaurant. Had gone here for lunch once quite some time ago. There is no ambience to speak of,just a few tables and chairs with very gloomy lighting. We had garlic naan and Chicken reshmi butter masala. The food was so good that we were licking our fingers by the time we were done with it. The white gravy of the chicken was given in enough quantity and we didn't waste one bit of it. The naan was soft and garlicky enough. It went well with the reshmi butter masala. it's very far from my place but I would love to visit it again to taste their famous Fowl cutlet.

Situated just opposite vivekannds house it's a very old restaurant......it's has a roll joint just beneath and and 1st floor for dining.
I have had their chicken roll and egg roll more than once.

It's tastes gud but once the paratha wasn't crispy rather on the soggy side.
One day we went for lunch and ordered indian.
We had ordered garlic naan and chicken reshmi butter masala..... Food was daam tasty. The naan did have the garlic flavour which is mostly not perfect most of the time. And the reshmi butter masala was too gud. I don't remember the serving bowl having even a wee bit of gravy Left in it.
 Coming to the ambiance it's towards the gloomy side .....had meare lights and what it had was blue......
Serving time was long. 
Stuff was polite .

Went here in a group of 7 on sasthi afternoon. They didn't have any Chinese option. Hence we ordered chicken biryani and chicken reshmi butter masala. Firstly the biryani was served almost cold n extremely oily. Side dish was served 15mins after later biryani was given. It was yellowish like a dal n tasted extremely bad. Even they gave only 3pcs chicken where as menu read 6pcs. We had to return the dish. Overall a bad experience. Try n avoid the place.

Over 100 years of old resturant doesn't even have the courtesy to give food in time or to provide a feedback of apology.. Rather they are so stubborn that they will argue with you.

Things happening once can be accpted.. bt things happening over and over agin cannot be taken into consideration.

I ordered for a chicken roll outsde counter and what i got in return was jus the paratha & not d chicken inside it.
When i enquired they provided me with a feedback sayin due to puja season they are shortage of chicken.!!!

They left us unattended for a disturbing amount of time and I had to literally seek one of them out just so I could get a glass of water to drink. Nothing fancy about the restaurant except for the waiters who hide when you need them, could be their way of making you feel at home playing 'hide and seek'.

I along with a friend ordered Chicken kasa and tandoori roti in the beginning. They messed up the order. With just two tables to serve, it takes a real genius to mess up an order serving us with mutton instead of the chicken.Next we got ourselves our old Chicken kasa and butter tandoori which tasted just fine, analogous to the mutton.

The manager seemed to be a good man as he apologised for the trouble and gave a fair warning to the waiter. I dropped the matter realizing it to be an honest mistake on the part of the waiter.

FOOD IS JUST FINE NOTHING SPECIAL

SERVICE IS POOR

One of the oldest chinese restaurants in kolkata, the Chacha's Hotel came into existence well before independence, along with the other similar one, Chung Wah. Some of the greatest writers and novelists of bengali literature has given this restaurant a place in their writings, and my personal childhood memories (some 10-12 years back) associated with this place are also good ones. Good quality foods used to be offered in massive quantity here. Alas, gone are the golden days. It's below average now, specially in terms of quality. Visit this place only for nostalgia, not for great food.

Chacha's Hotel is a very old restaurant in that area. I heard about it from my friends. The Chinese as well as North Indian dishes are good here. Price and quantity wise it's good but there is room for improvement in quality. But I loved the starters very much. Worthy of a pocket friendly visit.

Located near Vivekananda road, this restaurant is one of the oldest of Calcutta, famous for their biryani. But these days it is heard that the biryani has lost its quality. So i never tried it. However their chicken roll is nice and quite filling. Also the chicken kabab I took home from here last week, was quite good for the price charged.

A very old restaurant and a favourite to many localites. The place has amazing mutton seekh kebabs. It will just melt in your mouth as you bite into it. The meat is soft juicy and tender, having a hit of pepper to enhance the taste. The blend of spices used just makes it super tasty.
The chicken cutlet is also quite good and is a good option for snacks.
The chinese food is also good and quantity is pretty good according to the price charged.
Chicken fried rice has a good taste and has quite a lot of chicken in it. The manchurian chicken has 8 pieces and has a nice taste with a bit of indian touch to it.

Legendary Chacha's hotel was situated on the opposite footpath were the house of Swami Vivekanda is built. Have visited this place probably hundreds of times with my mother and grandfather. The fishfry, chop,, fowl cutlet, kabiraji are like heaven. If you are in Calcutta and want to try authentic bengali snacks do try this out.

It is a heritage restaurant located opposite to Swami Vivekananda's Ancestral House. I have been to this place several times since childhood. But of lately their quality has degraded a lot.¬†
Their speciality still holds for Fowl cutlet and Mutton sheek kabab.

Chacha's Hotel is one of the most oldest restaurant of Vivekananda Road. Its located just opposite to Vivekananda's House. They renovated everything few years ago. Now the restaurant is divided into floors & there's ample amount of space for sittings. The ambience is quite simple but good. Service is okey.

Tried their Green Peas Pulao & Chicken Kasa. Pulao wasn't very spicy & oily but it tasted like steamed rice only. The quantity wasn't very satisfying too. On the other hand Chicken Kasa was spicy & well cooked but same here it doesn't tasted good. Both the dishes were absolutely disappointed. Pricing may seem on the lower side but compared to their food quality it doesn't satisfy foodies mind.

Once their food quality used to be very famous but now days with time they have constantly degraded their food quality to a worst level. Visiting Chacha's Hotel nowdays isn't worth it beside its name only.

Nearly a 100 years old eatery. I have heard about it from my father and have been seeing it grow and change since many years. Though mainly popular for chinese, they preety good variety of north indian dishes. Chinese starters are praiseworthy. But their staffs and servicing skills are a bit below the standard. These needs to be improved a lot. Quality wise its mediocre. Lots of room for improvement.

Heritage restaurant. It is located opposite to Vivekananda house. I heard a lot about this place from my parents. Visited with my office colleagues. This restaurant is famous for their special fowl cutlet which was quite heavy. So instead of trying Chinese or Mughlai dishes I would like to suggest one can try their signature dishes like fowl cutlet, egg devil or fish finger. The ambiance was average but it was okay for me. Overall experience was okay :)

Here comes the review of Chacha's Hotel. One of the oldest continuously running restaurants in Kolkata at Vivekananda road crossing. Known for its Chinese, North Indian, Mughlai delicacies for a long time. Ambience is upto scratch. Air conditioned. Food quality and quantity both are more than satisfactory. However, the sweetness of the chicken sweet corn soup was not barred to the sweet corn, but could be felt in the entire soup (little annoying). The hot garlic fish is really palatable. Fishes were soft and flavoured, melts in your mouth. Rice quantity is ample, according to the price and can fill the appetite for two. So, thumbs up. The negative facts- long wait to get your food, hence slow service. They fail to deliver some of the food items present in the menu card-thumbs down. They charge extra for the container for the take away, henceforth another Thumbs down.

Review for Chacha's Hotel should include that the waiting staff don't wait on you properly. Service was slow. Food was good. Both Chinese style egg fried rice and hot garlic fish were tasty and filling for two people. The Chicken Sweet Corn Soup was a bit too sweet. But their Chicken fried rice and chilli chicken were also awesome.

One of the oldest restaurants of this region. Had been visiting this place since childhood. But nowadays it fails to pull crowds like they used to, a decade ago (probably due to the increasing no of eateries in the surroundings & also due to the detoriation of their food quality).
PROS:
‚óÜ Spacious.
‚óÜ Newly renovated & Well decorated.
‚óÜ Quite pocket friendly (given, the portion they provide).
CONS:
‚óÜ Average food (they seriously need to look into it).
‚óÜ Horrible service.
‚óÜ Pathetic staff.
I ordered for a mixed fried rice at the takeaway counter, they accepted the order, took the money, drew me the bill & asked me to wait for a few mins. But at the time of handing over the parcel to me they said, "Sir, prawn khatam ho gya hai...isliye mixed nhi milega...egg chicken fried rice de diya...15 rupay wapas milega aapko". I was so pissed of with this...I mean wtf yaar...they should have told me this before drawing the bill, I wouldn't have given the order then. The management seriously needs to look into these things otherwise they'll keep losing loyal customers üòè.

The review is on the basis of my father's opinion as he has been visiting this place for a long long time. According to him their special fowl cutlet used to be a lot better earlier but over time it has lost that oomph. Although I personally really liked the fowl cutlet & the fish finger I had. Pretty decent if you think of the price I feel.

"Chacha's Hotel" is one such food joint in Kolkata which is not only an old heritage bearing place of the city, but also used to serve the stalwarts of yesteryears.
So with great expectations I had given it a try.
But to my disappointment, this place has lost its fame by compromising with the taste and quality of food, and service as well.
Well, with course of time everything needs makeover to meet market demands. So inclusion of Chinese cuisines, and other fast foods like Burger, pasta etc in the menu was not a very surprising one for me. But one cannot afford to lose its heritage and fame by compromising with the taste and quality of food!! But this place did it!! The service is also poor, and hardly I was able to find in menu card, the heritage dishes of earlier times(like egg devil, mutton singara, prawn cutlet, fish diamond fry, etc.) only except the foul cutlet and very few others.
Everything needs to get updated with time, but that does not mean one should forget the roots from which it has achieved its fame!!
And lastly, I'm not at all satisfied with the taste and quality of food they served, and the service was poor.
Very disappointing experience.

Chacha's Hotel has been around for nearly a century and the saddest part for me was that I heard about the place and visited it only quite recently.
Now 1st off, the decorations of the restaurant are nothing fancy and there's a mark of old age on the chairs and tables found over here. It's located right on the road so it's not exempted from the commotion of city life even.
Coming to the food, I'd have to say that the food is just above average. The Mughlai dishes, particularly the Biriyani and the Kebabs are not at all impressive. However, I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's bad. Compared to the Mughlai dishes, the Chinese dishes, namely the Hakka Noodles and the Schezwan Fried Rice still are something of a revelation.
The service was more or less fine, but doesn't stick out from your average restaurant experience. The price, however, is quite reasonable.
All in all, Chacha's Hotel, almost being a heritage to the city, failed to impress me. No wonder I hadn't heard of it before!!

If you are at Chacha's then you should absolutely try the Rolls. Other dishes are also very tasty.A recently renovated ground floor lets you sit and have snacks. For full meals, you can sit upstairs, in the AC.
Prices not too heavy on your pocket helps you to focus more on the food.

We were regulars here when we were kids. Came here today with our cousins after a long time. We ordered chicken biriyani, mutton kasa, butter naan, tandoori roti, chicken kadhai. The biriyani was good. The chicken was done well and it was soft. We sat outside so we didn't have to pay any tax and vat. 
The butter naan had no butter but it was soft but the tandoori roti was like papad. both the mutton kasa and the chicken kadhai pieces were not soft. A bit rubbery. They should clean the restaurant floors as well. Really dirty.

Went there on panchami for dinner since every Hatibagan eatery was overcrowded. It's situated just opposite swami Vivekananda's ancestral home. Considered a legendary restaurant for its long tradition with Bengali culture and known for its fowl cutlet we were disappointed that during the pujas they were not serving the usual items.
However we ordered plates of kebab, mutton kosha,chicken kadhai & butter naan.
Kebabs were so so, rather a bit cold.
The naan was a bit too sweet.
But what surprised me was the really tasty chicken kadhai.
And that mutton kosha! Seriously it has that homely taste to it.
The last disappointment came when the waiter informed us they don't serve cold drink or soda!
Overall experience okayish.

This place serves average quality food at reasonable prices. I have tried the Chinese variety and it is typically Indian Chinese. Also, the seating arrangements are more akin to that of cafes than of restaurants.

About the food, the Hot and Sour Chicken Soup tasted similar to the market available Knorr Soup, being a disappointment. The Mixed Chicken Noodles and Mixed Manchurian Fried Rice did not have beaten eggs in it and upon inquiring we were notified that it doesn't come even with extra price. These preparations had an awful oily smell associated, probably due to the same utensil being used for other dishes as well, leading towards a degrading experience. The Szechuan Chicken was much better prepared though the meat could have more tender.

The service was a tad on the slower side, but the warm waiters and cozy ambience will keep your spirits high.

After a long day of walking around north Calcutta, we chanced upon this place, located just opposite Vivekananda's ancestral home, at a venue that cannot be missed. The restaurant was empty, however, and the staff jumped onto an opportunity to serve us patrons. We had heard about the place, but didn't expect this. The food we ordered (rumali roti and chicken bharta) was rather tasty, but just as we were pondering why there was seldom a customer about, we discovered  a hair in the roti. To make matters worse, a group of patrons arrived but left, having not found anything they wanted to have available at that hour(peak lunch time). These were probably some of the reasons why the restaurant is no longer the same as before. The staff and service were pleasant enough, but air conditioning was dubious!  All in all, I hope the place pulls up their socks soon. It has the makings of a great joint.

We ordered a mixed hakka noodles and sweet and sour chicken. The noodle was pretty nondescript, other than the fact I never had whole dried red chillies in my noodles before! The sweet and sour chicken had pineapple (not that uncommon though) and cucumber for some reason.

The place is famous and I think it is as good as I thought it to be...... Tried their Fish Kobiraji, Biryani etc. Food was really nice......

Important update 
Yesterday I revisited the place for Mughlai food. It was 4-30 in the afternoon and I ordered Biriyani and Chicken Jalfrezi. The waiter promptly replied that Jalfrezi is not available. Ok, so instead I told him to bring Tikka-mashala. He told me it is unavailable too. Then I asked him what is available and his reply was, Biryani and Chicken curry as the chef 'chuttime hay' and everything will be available in the evening. Great, then what's the use of that decorated menu card, I didn't understand. I left the place immediately.

a classic case of once upon a time era of greatness now faded upon being just an ordinary eatery house.

this place was a legend way back in 70"s. i have heard so many stories about the place from my uncles and older relatives who were college students then and swear by it's superb cutlets.

the fabled full moon cutlet has shrinked(a lot),is oily,has more bread crumbs than fish and is just ok. in the words of an old veteran comparing the cutlet of 2015 era with the cutlet of 1960-70 era is like comparing honey singh with hemant kumar.!!!

the chicken pakoras were tiny and tasted like chicken flavored nuggets.

the only saving grace were the tandoori items,which were decent enough.

may be the other mughlai items are good,but after a disappointing start,i was not adventurous enough ti venture further.

one can visit the place for nostalgia or ¬†as one time visit.

p.s-- there are no decent full range restaurants around this area.

Last Sunday it was lately decided by my family that we would get our parcel of food home from some place nearby. Chacha's was the nearest option, plus it has a local reputation. Moreover, it provides¬† you with a varied platter option. Hence the take away facility was approached.
Food was mediocre¬† and I did not find it to match its reputation. We had ordered for Tawa Fried Lachha Paratha, Chicken Lazeezi Handi and Mutton Keema Masala. the parathas were really oily and that made them quite heavy. The chicken preparation was much spicy and hot(peppered) than normal. However, the mutton curry was finely made. Price is moderate and service is quick.

I chanced upon it while driving past it. Read so much about its full moon shaped fowl cutlet that I decided to give it a try. Seeing that parking is difficult, I decided upon takeaway. I had entered with the premonition that the stock of fowl cutlets would be exhausted. To my surprise, the manager said it would be ready within the next ten minutes. I carried the food, and soon drove away from the area to a secluded place. 
Fowl cutlets are no more the legendary full moon shaped. It is much smaller and were soaked in oil. The taste is ordinary, nothing new.

Looking at the crowd and the good menu spread, we thought of giving this joint a try. However, they don't have any parking area nearby and the road in front is a strict no-parking zone on both the sides. As such, we had to depend on the takeaway facility. We just picked up a portion of Chicken pakora, which consisted of 8 pieces but the sizes were quite small. Taste wise it was okay. However it took them around half an hour to prepare. Pricing is¬†very cheap.

Chacha is just opposite of vivekanand museum in bidhan sarani, near vivekanand road and bidhan sarani crossing. I say its an average restaurant. I find food satisfactory nothing special. But i love its Butter Nan and Chiken Reshmi Butter Masala. It can be tried once.

Chachas Hotel is one of the most iconic and probably the oldest running restaurant in north kolkata..Dates back to 19th century it is originally located in the premises of Swami Vivekananda's House..However off late the quality of food have deteriorated horribly although the rates have gone up steeply..they even serve stale food the last time we visited this place..
The flavours and quantity of the dishes have gone south..
Still some of the highlists of the menu includes:
Fowl Cutlet: One of the reminiscent of north kolkata's cafe food..a round chicken cutlet is a must try dish..
Mutton sheekh kebab: Unlike other places there sheekh kebab is quite different with boneless chunks of mutton..the smokiness adds to the flavour..
Mixed gravy noodles: Simply because of the quantity and portions of protein in the plate..
Apart from these their chinese side dishes are tasty and wholesome and provide options for the diner..while the indian dishes are indifferent..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Ambience: 2.5/5

Since childhood we bring back food from this place place but never sat and had as the ambience wouldn't be good for family get together. Now that the place is renovated it's perfect for family gatherings.¬†

It is situated close to Swami Vivekananda's house. I usually have cutlets or chinese cuisine from this place and it is worth drooling for. I'm somewhat addicted to it's food. I am a consistent and besotted chacha lover.

Do drop in!

Once-upon-a-time-one-of-the-best restaurants in Kolkata lost all its charms nowadays. Quality of food has dropped drastically. We ordered Chicken Biryani and Reshmi Butter Masala, and both of them were equally horrible in taste. Chicken was very much under-cooked and reshmi masala was sweet as hell! Service was also not good. We had to wait for 20 mins for main dish to arrive at our table after we had finished our starter. Not recommended at all.

This restaurant has a history behind it for being one of the most oldest eat-outs in North Kolkata.¬† Apart from that, the food quality has actually deteriorated from how it was 3-4 years back. Quantity still remains the same though and it's quiet good. One full plate of Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken will be good enough for two average eaters.
Rolls are very huge here and tasty as well.
Prices are OK for an average restaurant like this, but still it could be a bit cheaper. Service is good.

Chacha's hotel dates back to almost a century. The hotel is located right beside Swami Vivekananda's house and some of the locals claim that Swamiji used to frequent here and relish their fowl cutlet. Now, I can't vouch for that but what I can vouch for is their Chicken Tandoori. One of the bests in town undoubtedly. 

Chacha's was very famous for its iconic item - the fowl cutlet. You hardly have that nowadays and even if you do, it's basically your good old chicken cutlet and is nothing to drool for. Very ordinary. You need to ask an octogenarian to understand the difference between the Fowl Cutlet of the 1920/30s and the Chicken Cutlet of 2015. 

Do visit this one for the chicken tandooris.

when I went to see the Swami Vivekananda's house at Simla then I went there.Chacha is the famous for their popular 'Fowl Cutlet'.At first they sold only cutlet,kabiraji etc.but now they sells many items.Taste have been changed.Fowl cutlet is average tasty.price is little high than the quality.

Good small cozy place. Well behaved friendly staff. Although food takes a long time to come. Food is good. Had their special FOWL cutlet.. nothing special. Loaded with bread crumbs.
Fish kabiraji was good
Chicken kabiraji was ok. You wont get any chicken pieces. Seemed a big cutlet filled with breadcrumbs and a small amount of minced chicken.
Mutton seekh kebab was not good. First of all it was not a kebab. It was mutton mince on a seekh with a very sticky not completely cooked cornflour batter coating.. no smoky flavour of a kebab. Bland in taste. And all this mess for 100 bucks!!!
Gosht nalli rogan josh was ok ok. Mutton was cooked nicely but the gravy was not as of rogan josh. It was a simple tomato gravy actually quiet bland in taste.
Chicken tikka masala was excellent.
Tawa paratha or lachcha paratha was good. Thick soft from inside crisp from outside.
Overall nice place, per plate food is enough for 2. Reasonable pricing.
Should try once. @

Again this is a old tattered joint which now has had a facelift, color up and ACs. Food thankfully hasn't changed much. Their cutlets and fish fries are legendary , and they still present it proudly, which holds up to the reputation.
Their flagship is fowl cutlet, but the Fish Kabiraji is also a must try here.

Other main courses however are nothing out of the way. And the quality really doesn't keep up with the price, which is on a steady rise.

As a child it was my¬†favorite¬†place. Used to find excuses to visit.

Recently I got a chance to visit here once again. But to my utter disappointment I have found that everything has changed so quickly. The servicing is the poorest thing I must say. There is no coordination among staffs.¬†
During Durga Puja they have reduced their menu and kept only a few items of their choice. You can not order the Special Fowl Cutlet, you can only take away. We ordered rashmi kabab which was not great but tender n juicy.¬†

In spite being my childhood fab, I would try to avoid visiting there in future.

This restaurant can only be described with just one word and i.e. "was". Yes it was a good place to eat. Me and a few friends of mine dropped after an evening of tiring pandal hopping. My friends ordered biryani and me and a friend of mine decided to have mixed chowmein and chicken manchurian. Visually the biryani looked boring and was totally dry and the chicken was bland. The prawns in the chowmein was bland and no eggs and rarely found chicken. The manchurian was just okay. Unless you're really very hungry, don't bother to drop by.

The reason I'm pissed off at this place is the next to zero hospitality of the staff. They take down the menu slowly. Confuse bills. Are restless. I still don't know how they were stupid enough to make combined billings for a group of 14. And the worst part is, THEY DID NOT HAVE THE COURTESY TO APOLOGIZE. INSTEAD THEY MADE US FEEL AS IF WE WERE IN POLICE CUSTODY. THEY OVERCHARGED FROM ONE OF OUR TABLES. They even tried to make it look as if it was our fault.
We were an all-girls group and they behaved very rudely with us. VERY.
The entire billing episode took more than 20 minutes to be sorted out and the staff was not at all helpful, let alone apologetic. 
As for the food, the quantity was good and they had none of their  Special Fowl Cutlet, even though it was lunchtime during Durga Puja. 
The Garlic Fish and Garlic Chicken had the same gravy, though the pieces were tender and succulent.
They had a  "Durga Puja Special" menu card with Egg Fried Rice costing 150 bucks plus taxes. A bill for 4 consisting of 1 Egg Fried Rice, 2 Chicken Fried Rice and 1 each of Garlic Chicken and Fish came to 900.

It was some 2 or 3 o' clock at noon, and we were hungry as hell !!
Suddenly we came across this long-heard and much appraised food place at the entrance of College Street and however, without giving a second thought as our hunger was penetrating our intestines into pieces, we entered.
Needless to say the place has a typical North-Kolkata'an' ambience, which is cherish-able. 
We ordered a Mutton Biryani and a Fowl Cutlet.
The Biryani had an amazing flavor of onion, which tasted a bit unconventional but at the same time tasty.
I tried a Fowl Cutlet. I should not say much about it as to be very honest that was my time to try that Fowl-thing.
It might be very stupid saying- but the Fowl-Cutlet tasted a bit bitter, fresh though.
The most soothing part of the restaurant is- its price chart !!!
Being hungry and coming back without having a hole in our pocket, isn't that quite a co-incidence ??¬†

If you are a heritage building hunter driving down one of the busiest roads of Calcutta,you'll find this restaurant located in Vivekananda's Road Crossing.
Chacha's Hotel was earlier located right next to Swami Vivekananda's ancestral house.Only a few years back,they have situated to this new corner.
For this 150 year old restaurant the food says it all.In fact I have been here around 5-6 times and I must appreciate the food these people serve.Delicious,sumptuous and healthy.
If you are a non vegetarian you are at the right place with an array of food items at your disposal.
A Sunday evening will be the ideal time to be here with your friends/family so that you may get engrossed with the buzz of this place,but try avoiding this place during festival time.The serpentine queues outside this restaurant will drive you mad,and you may land up with nothing to fulfill your empty stomach.
Coming to the starters the foul cutlet and egg devil are the specialities of this restaurant.You may opt for the Mutton Cutlet instead of the egg devil if you are a red meat lover.
After having these two dishes,if you have enough space go for the Tandoori Roti and Mutton Rezala/the mutton Biryani with Raita.
The tandoor section of this restaurant is very fascinating and very versatile.
If you are a Chinese lover opt for the Chicken Hakka Chowmein and Prawn Manchurian.But I swear you still won't be able to finish it.The Chilli Chicken gravy is also a good option for chicken lovers.
Desserts section-well there is hardly any in this restaurant.For a change have a few cold drinks to gulp everything down.
Overall good ambience,good food and a heritage eat out like this in Calcutta will surely leave a mark in your memory.

We went there twice.. Had their butter naan ( best naan i've ever had ), garlic chicken , manchurian chicken ( both were good) n mixed fried rice ( very good in taste but quantity was less than moderate ).

Service was not so good not so bad.But what bothered us that people were standing near us even after serving....!

Price was reasonable..

Try once..atleast for their butter naan.. :P

recently went there and we ordered for fish fry,chicken cutlet,chicken reshmi kebab and irani kebab..the only eatble ones were fish fry and reshmi kebab..rest i dont know what they made after 30 minutes of waiting..cutlet was so deep fried it was unable to tear apart..and irani kebab had a different yuckky smell...and it was hard..fish fry was lil better and their reshmi kebab was good..i dont know what has happened to their quality..we ordered after this a plate of chicken noodles..it was very less quantity which was not even enough for one person...and price is hiked i dont know for what reason ..

greatly disappointed..as it has a lot of traditional feel..and it bears heritage of north kolkata..it should try to improve asap..as it serves variety of dishes people go with high expectation...i hope next time my next time visit would not disappoint me..!

I had my tuition over here so went to visit my sir after a long time. My dad had praised this joint a lot so decided to pack away stuffs from here. Firstly when it comes to the ambiance it is nothing extraordinary.  I ordered

Fish Tikka Masala : 4 pieces of fish which were well cooked and tender
Murgh Reshmi kebab: another well prepared dish

My only concern was looking at the ambiance and the price , the quantity does not justify both the factors. They should look into the quantity. Even the dish took around 20-25 mins to prepare which is was a lot of time. Other than that the taste is fine and an average place to visit.

old chacha's has come up with all new look but the quality has gone down. yet the fowl cutlet is what it stands apart for & so we friends gathered after college in this nearby eating-joint mainly for that thing. we had to wait cause we were supposed to get the fowl cutlet after 4pm. but it was not untill 5 p.m that we got ours. but the delay was worth it as the fowl cutlet was awesome, served hot with mustard sauce, the entire taste is somewhat sharp and tangy. we also had plateful of fries and crispy chicken. the other day when we went to Chacha's we ordered for biriyani of both Oudhy & Hyderabady preparations with north indian side dishes. the oudhy biriyani was a regular one and the side dishes was duly delicious but the Hyderabady biriyani was a little pungent - sweet in taste though with ample cherries and sprinkled chopped onions deeply fried. i did not enjoy this dish. however, we tried Chinese later some other day & gravy chow along with other items were more or less okay. yet despite some flaws, i would prefer the Mughlai dishes to Chinese in case of Chacha's.

A pretty old and renowned place and i stopped by to have a roll here recently but was extremely disappointed. Located opposite the Swami Vivekanada museum near hedua park, the place has a convenient location. The staff service is pretty slack. The prices are a bit higher than the competition nearby and the food worse. The place did not seem to uphold that good levels of hygiene and preparation seemed far too oily.

Old chacha's is always close to my heart. My mom and I used to go there in my childhood. The reshmi kabab the soft naans all occupy a delicious corner in my memory. 
But after almost a decade when I went there yesterday - I was very dissapointed. The fowl cutlet hardly had a quality chicken fillet - the biriyani was so out of taste - full of kewra smell but didnt get that biriyani rice taste - and the chicken in the biriyani was also tasteless. Only thing that was OK - Was mutton roganjosh and butter naan. Well may be it is not the old Chacha's with small place to sit - but definitely this chacha's need to improve the quality of food.

Good point for this restaurant is - it is located in a place whic is easily locatedable.

Had the Chicken Fowl Cutlet, Mutton Chop and Mutton Cutlet all the three items were quite good. The rate is a little higher than the nearby (College Street Crossing) Dilkhusha Cabin but still very affordable around Rs60 -Rs 70. Though it has a restaurant with air-condition I never had time on hand to sit down and eat the food over there instead both the times that I had visited the place I have taken a parcel. The Staff is also very helpful and courteous and you can engage them into telling you the story of the place.

I am born and brought up in North Kolkata and I've been to almost all of the popular eateries. Chacha's Hotel is hyped by the media and the nostalgic Bengalis. The food quality is just average, but the prices are at par with any good fine dining outlet. So it's a lose-lose situation there. 
My wife and I visited the eatery last week on a weekday. There is a continuous smell of spices from the kitchen, making you cough and sneeze throughout the dinner. One elderly gentleman started to cough, and wouldn't stop for the whole evening. Even 4 split ACs were not sufficient to ventilate the room. At last they had to open a window to let the fresh air pass. 
Then it comes to the food. we ordered the famous fowl cutlet and some Chinese items. The fowl cutlet tasted hard and sour and we were wondering if the food is stale or not. Thankfully none of us became ill. As for the Chinese items I don't know if it's their forte or not.. but the taste of Hong Kong chicken and chilly chicken were the same. At last we asked for desserts. This was the funniest part. They brought 2 Kwality Walls icecreams from a shop outside and served it on a plate garnishing it with nuts, chocolate sauce. And charged 160 bucks for the whole thing! What's more, they did it all in front of our eyes on another vacant table. 
The whole experience was very irritating. To top it all, they didn't accept cards. So I  had to go all the way to the ATM and take out cash.
I will just add one final nail on their service... we asked for tomato sauce. They brought it in a small bowl, with a recycled Metro Dairy green icecream spoon, and one solitary black hair!
My verdict: Take out the '1875' tag from Chacha's and it's worse than a roadside joint. Will go back once more though to taste the Mughlai dishes and then give the final verdict!

If you are anyone who knows Kolkata's old favorites in food, then Chacha's hotel is one of the stars which has been overhyped and they have never really maintained their standards. Chacha's hotel was famous for the Fowl Cutlet, Kabiraji and Mutton Chop. However, I was quite shocked to see that they have added Chinese and Indian food there. However, I was not there for those things, and on my last visit, ordered the Fowl Cutlet, which was quite expensive a cutlet compared to the prices at nearby places, including Dilkhusha Cabin. The meat was tasteless, the crust too thick and the cutlet had a weird smell. Sorry to say this but it failed in all the tests I was putting it through. I actually stopped eating because I could not taste anything but crumbs.

This is again a cocktail review by collecting the memory drops since 2006.
This place was mentioned for first time by my dad who was a north Kolkatan by heart and soul. I first entered in Chacha during my 1st yr of MSc. It was not in this format, a small restro, just opposite to its present location beside Swamiji's home was the famous Chacha restaurant. The tase of mutton biriyani  at my first day visit I can still cheris in memory. Just wow. I became its fan. Within one yr it shifted to opposite side of the road became bigger and expanded. It used to open 5.30 in evening which we college friends used to wait for. It was almost a routine for us to enter in Chacha atleast twice in a week. sometimes the number even were higher. 

This is not the place for some luxurious dine rather a luxurious comfort for your taste buds. A number of dishes are listed in menu and I tasted almost all of them.  I feel this place is special for typical mughlai dishes.  I had and have many loving dishes like Chacha's special mutton biriyani, chicken biriyani,  Nargishi kima mutton, gost nalli rogan jush, handi gosht, fish afgani, mutton kabiraji and many more. Being a big fan of byriyani I became regular visitor of this place. It was a authentic place for tasting typical rich mughlai biriyanis of almost all type. I miss those days.

The price and charges for different dishes supplied were reasonable and amounts were also good.   A full plate of byriyani in 150 Rs is probably possible only in kolkata. In addition you can enjoy a beautiful authentic taste. 

Chacha is the crown of Vivekananda road for food loving bongs.

Miss you

Chacha's has been a very renowned place for eating out in the northern part of the city over a long period of time. But nowadays, it is better to have your food parcelled than to dine-in here; ambience & service were never the outstanding features of this place & things have gotten worse. Their reputation has always been about the quality of the food served, which still is decent enough; especially the indian dishes. The chinese items are avoidable. As with several restaurants all over the city there is a serious issue here with the deveining of shrimps, most are not cleaned properly.

Devoid of glamour and glitter, this small place is one of note among north Calcuttans. Coming from the same area myself, I have been here quite a number of times ever since I was small. The ambience doesn't have much to offer but it ain't that bad a place too. The menu has a lot of variety and you can expect all the stuff that you expect to find at a decent place. One item of real note I had years back was the Thai Prawns, but I wouldn't know if they still serve it now. The prices are very good and it isn't at all expensive.

This place carries a lot of heritage with it, and that's all that is left about it! Right beside the historic house of Swami Vivekananda, this restaurant was once famous for its fish fingers and cutlets. I was lucky enough to have them at a time it was still considered good. It is recommended to get food stuff packed rather than eating inside, as the ambiance does not have much to offer!

If you are anyone who knows Kolkata's old favorites in food, then Chacha's hotel is one of the stars which has been overhyped and they have never really maintained their standards. Chacha's hotel was famous for the Fowl Cutlet, Kabiraji and Mutton Chop. However, I was quite shocked to see that they have added Chinese and Indian food there. However, I was not there for those things, and on my last visit, ordered the Fowl Cutlet, which was quite expensive a cutlet compared to the prices at nearby places, including Dilkhusha Cabin. The meat was tasteless, the crust too thick and the cutlet had a weird smell. Sorry to say this but it failed in all the tests I was putting it through. I actually stopped eating because I could not taste anything but crumbs.

I went yesterday to Chacha's. The service was horrible. I ordered Murg Biriyani with chicken kasha. I had to wait for 15 minutes before someone came and took my orders. They another 30 minutes before the food was served. The kasha was so so, not the one you get any other good restaurants like Zeshan and Nizam's. But the Biriyani was horrible. The rice was half cooked and   the chicken was smelly. Please consider food lovers before going in there. This isn't anymore our old Chacha's. The price is decent though.

Chacha is common name for north calcuttans. But to keep up the name chacha isnt doing much. Recently they have increased the price of their food items but the quality hasnt increased much.
You can pay a visit but opt for a parcel because i dont like the ambience aa well as the service at all.
Now coming to food try Fish Fingers, muton seekh kabab, chicken bharta n moti naan. They have chinese cuisine as well but its nothing special to mention.

It was a Sunday and I was out very hungry in North Kolkata with my family. This place at Vivekananda Road Crossing was our saviour. Though it is in a strictly no parking zone, I somehow managed because of it being a Sunday. The place was nearly empty. We ordered a Mutton Biriyani, some rotis, a chicken kassa and a pulao and fish butter masala and green salad. The mutton biriyani wasnt good at all, even the mutton pieces had not been cleaned properly. the fish butter did not arrive - what came was a chicken butter masala. It was a embarassment for me as that dish was for my MIL who does not eat chicken.  By some magic, the dish was changed and within 5 mins the fish preparation was delivered. the roti required some strength in tearing which I do have thanks to the regular healthy food I have at home. the kasaa and the salad was fine in all respect. 
go in only if you are very hungry.
one really good feature was that they dont water down their hand soap which is the very first step of hygienic eating.

girishpark...simla palli....jorasako.... all these places in north kolkata holds a significant glory in the history. Bearing a legacy of over 135 years this restaurent has managed to serve people some of the delicious mughlai cuisine. It is told that swami vivekananda used to have his "adda" in the "chachas" (just opposite to his house) when it was a mere tea stall. talking about the food, i am a huge fan of the kababs and tanduris what this restaurent serves. the prices are more or less reasonable for a college goer even. So, anyone wants to enjoy the oldy flavour of kolkata (as with the surroundings) this place is a MUST visit.:-)

the hotel is more than 100 year's old & i had a meal on their hotel when it was situated on the old location. Now a days, their quality of good is very low. Not getting the better food which i had 2-3 years ago. Though the price is based on market price. ambiance is also not so much good & the hotel is also not neat & clean. So, think twice before visiting!!!!!

went there with a friend while returning from college, its 2 years back. Nowadays the place has been renovated. Looks good. The food was good, worth the price. The price is very much moderate...chaep. There is a variety in their menu. The taste of the food and the quantity served was worth the price. This place is known for its rich heritage.

The good old Calcutta is a treasure trove of wonders. And this old restaurant of over a century and a half years old. It stands vehemently strong. It attracts people from all over Calcutta. It still has the vestiges of its past pride... Chacha's hotel was the epitome of immaculate culinary since the times of my Grandfather's. The rolls were mouthwatering (they still are!), the mutton kebabs were moist , juicy and irrevocably melt in the mouth (they still do!). What's a downer here for the sake of honesty is that, the fowl cutlet doesnt keep up to the expectations anymore. It is famed for these very things, and what surprises me the most is that, people hang out at Chacha's to gorge on Chinese! That's a strict no-no from and ardent foodie, who chooses her food right and fine. Go to Chacha's for the delectable Indian stuffs (rolls, kebabs and cutlets). Normal Indian fare is above-average. Prices would definitely suit your specifications well. Yet, the ambiance may just fail to tick you that much. Just make a trip to this oldie-goldie, in the name of good, savoury food.

I have been to chahcha for around 15 years , bust the new managment has changed a lot. Last time i visited a week ago . I was denied extra gravy in mutton kausa , chicken clear soup has been removed from the menu . rates are higher than any other restaurateur of this standard. 

It felt like home all these years , but not now .

Bearing a legacy of over 135 years this restaurant has brought home pretty new changes to cope up with the increasing competition among the other restaurants nearby. Prices have been hiked up followed by a change in the ambiance inside. You follow a flight of stairs to reach the newly renovated air conditioned eating place, which formerly was a place of hangout in the golden days of my ancestors. One has to be sure of his knowledge of food before he orders as because the waiters here are friendly though, they do not know more than half of what they have on offer. The starter items have been reformed into modern Chinese delicacies but for the old scholar you can still find the fowl and mutton cutlets, kabirajis, etc. Don't expect the food to be near authentic, if done so you are to be utterly disappointed. A minus point of this restaurant is the lack of proper ventilation system from the kitchen. People including us were severely coughing because of the smoke and smell of indian high voltage tarka. Overall a moderately showcased eatery poised on its 136 years old glory, not a foodie's paradise.

value for money.... with good taste.....the mutton chop and the fowl cutlet is quite good..the kasha mutton is decent...the best part is that things are extremely cheap. nothing much to say about a restaurant which is over 125 years old...i have heard that swami vivekananda also used to frequently visit this place.
