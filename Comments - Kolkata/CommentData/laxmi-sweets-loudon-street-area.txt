Located at th park street mallick bazar crossing, this small sweet shop has really good kachoris. More than its sweets, it's namkeens are better. Kachori and it's mirchi ki chatni is really good.

I use to work very near to this very place. Atleast this was the place where in the afternoon i use to get hot singharas. Located just near to mullick bazar crossing at the park street way. Tried their Dhokla and singhara along with the sweet red chutney. Liked both of them. They also have a branch at the Elliot road near Ghalib Bar.

Located close to Mullickbazar, on Elliot Road, "Laxmi sweets" is an old establishment, popular for its sweets and snacks. Specially their hing kachouri is worth giving a try. And as the name suggests, they have a good variety of sweets to offer, which are nice in quality and descent in taste.

Located near Park Street - Mullick Bazar Crossing, this is a gem of a place. One of the few places which can simply kill you with their Hing Kachori. Absolutely fresh with almost no traces of oil, this one is a must try.

End your meal with some sumptuous gulab jamuns. A perfect place to have casual snacks. :-)

Surprised to see such few reviews. I love the Hing Kachoris , Samosas , Gulab Jamuns of this joint. The food items are reasonably priced and good in quality. Service is prompt and the staff are friendly too.

The only place where you can get Puri Bhaaji at a comparatively reasonable rate and something that you can easily munch on, provided that you aren't put off with a bit of extra oil in your kachoris. Gulab Jamun and the rest are average in terms of taste. The only reason I frequent this place is due to its proximity to where I am anchored at.
