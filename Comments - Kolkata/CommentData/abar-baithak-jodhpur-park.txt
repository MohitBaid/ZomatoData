This place is perfect for an adda session with friends. I ordered one cafe frappe which was chilled and had a slushy consistency. Another thing we ordered was fish fingers and a mocktail. The quantity served by them is enough.

Recently Jodhpur Park is coming up with a lot of great cafes. And Abar Baithak is one of them. Though it’s a very old brand and I was here before it was renovated like this, but heard a lot of  great reviews. 
Really a great decor. Various types of tea everyone can try out. 

1. Earl Grey Tea
2. Kashmiri Khwa
3. Cappuccino 
4. Chicken Platter
5. Pizza 

A great place to spend your evening over a cup of coffee/tea.

This is a small cafe tucked in the lanes of Jodhpur Park. The beauty of this cafe lies in its ambience. It is surely a treat for all those Feluda lovers. Though the food and the music may not sync with the kind of decor they display. Coming to the quality and quantity of food, I would say I am not really happy with the amount of food they provide compared to the prices. The quality is however very good. The star dish here is of course the English breakfast platter. We ordered the ~All Meat Platter~ which had cheese toasts, sausages, ham, salami, bacon and a poached egg served with mayonnaise. The other dishes that we had were ~Tortilla Chicken Wrap~ and ~Hot Chocolate~. Both of them were satisfying enough to savour your taste buds. However, the most disappointing part of this cafe is their service. First of all it does not open at 9 am. We had to wait for more than half an hour. And when we finally got to have a seat inside, they were still cleaning the floor. Also you will not be provided with a simple glass of water and tissue napkins unless you ask for one. Lastly, I would like to note is that they have raised all the prices in the menu so it will not match with the one provided in Zomato. 

So, if you are looking for some small cozy place for your evening addas or solitary mornings, along with some mouth watering food, this cafe should be on your list. It is worth visiting once. :)

I just love this place situated in jodhpur Park,  approx 2 min walk from South city mall.  It's ambiance was always be one of my favorite because of feluda my childhood super hero.  There is a separate smoking zone  for smokers.  It was little bit clumsy because they have too many tables here.  Food was average.  Chicken platter is a good option for breakfast. But their service was too slow...  U will have to remember them about your orders.

When it comes to the different cafés in kolkata, you must have some idea and visualize about that place from internet. I was really excited to visit Abar Baithak once, because of Feluda! I heard about the décor and friendly environment of this café. So I went with one of my friends last year and gave ourselves a small treat. We ordered chicken sandwich and brownie with icecream. 
1. First of all about the décor. It was attractive to some point but I felt boring. There was nothing about Feluda except the menu card (which has a cover of one of the Feluda books). 
2. Menu has some good variety of foods. I chose safe side by ordering familiar foods. Both of them were simple and ordinary. Nothing was special in terms of plating or tasting. 
May be my expectation killed my interest for this café. But I hope someday I'll visit again with my friends. 
PS. Sorry for the poor picture quality. I just took screenshot of them from my instagram as I forgot to write this review.

If you are book lover this is the kind of place you may like. Nice ambiance, nicely decorated, full of posters of detective series. The menu card was also a Feluda themed one with stories all over it. 

We ordered Chicken Wrap, Oreo Shake, Chocolate Maharaj, Chicken Open Sandwich, Olive Stuffed Chicken and Brownie with Hot Chocolate.  Price is reasonable, food is quite good and service is also good. 
P.S. - Must try one for the book lovers :)

Location - Location inside Jodhpur Park,you need to walk 5mins from the main road to reach this place

Ambiance- This is a two storied restaurant ,also there is a separate smoking zone for smokers where enjoy your smoke, food and lots of adda.There are arrangement for playing Carom. This is well furnished but a bit clumsy as there are too many tables are fitted in here.

Food Ordered- Cold coffee, Fish and chips, Ommlate 
Food Quantity-  Food quanity is average
Food quality- Food quality is good and standard ,however I found the fish n chips overpriced according to the taste
Service-Extremely slow

Point worth considering- This place is overcrowded with mostly college goers ,so there will be queues , take you time and visit this place
You need to call the attendants 10times to take your order otherwise you will just be seated in an empty stomach

If you are a Pheluda fan, the first floor would be the place where you should visit the first floor and look around. The genre of food seemed a bit off since i was expecting the cuisine to reflect a bit more of the Bengali snacks, though the Italian ones are not at all disappointing.

It would be great if the options are increased, the waiting time is looked upon and the waiters to be a bit more insightful.

One of my favorite places to hangout. I've been here with my two absolutely amazing gang of friends and we have had the moments of our lives. The place firstly has a beautiful ambience and anybody who's a Feluda fan would fall in love with the decors inside. The Feluda themed cafe is a bang on Adda place and so coming to the food they serve it's finger licking good. From the sandwiches to the amazing milkshakes and pizza and meat platter. Everything is so very good and they taste even better with an amazing gang of friends accompanying you right there.  A must go if you enjoy the Baithaki Adda over a cup of coffee or tea or any appetizing food there.

Ordered meat platter which was cold and all tasted almost same. Tea gave me the feel that I am drinking a cup of warm water. I don't know whether I will visit this place again or not but If I do hopefully experience will be better for me.

Mocktails I loved.. coffee was costly but exceptionally good..Walnut brownie with vanilla icecream &hot chocolate sauce has always been my favourite dessert..and here too..they did  not dissapoint..the day I went their fryer wasn't working so we couldn't hve fish&chips and some other dishes we wanted to try but certainly would visit this place again..its a place where u hve a long adda with friends too admiring every Bengali's favourite detective Feluda's work while having a typical English food..This unique combo makes it out of my favourite cafe..very much recommended..but yeah pocket pinch was close to 1k..for all we had..

Whenever in Kolkata, have been passing this cafe many times, only to see overcrowding. So this time, decided to be early on a weekday for a breakfast 
Sojourn.

Indeed, when I landed there with my mom, almost the first guest, realized the reason for the general crowding of the place. Themed on the famed creation of Ray - Feluda, the aura of the place is unique. the cushions, the menu, the memoribilia, the wall decor, everything captured Feluda's various trysts with adventure.

For breakfast, i ordered the All Meal platter. The fan, the bacon, the sausages were all nicely done, with the garlic dip to go with. Mom ordered a chicken sandwich. The portion was nice. However was pretty average in taste, expected little more niche, like adding English mustard.

The cappuccino was pretty regular, so was the Lebu cha, or lemon tea.

What was disappointing were the caramel custard. The caramelization was less, and the sweetness was too mild for the custard.

Kudos to the thoughtfully done ambience.

Nice place to enjoy a cup of coffee or tea. Nice decor. But I probably was expecting a bit more from the service and the quality of food. With the increasing no. of cafés coming up every other day, staying ahead can only be ensured by tremendously good service and equally brilliant food. Both of which were lacking. My friend and I went for a chat and we ordered ginger honey tea, chicken ham sandwich and cold coffee. The tea was fantastic and can easily be their USP. The cold coffee was too sweet. Did not enjoy it after a few sips. The sandwich was okay. My friend who took the tea wanted a some hot water so that she can use the tea leaves and the residual honey. We did pay for the tea leaves, and the entire cup. And I wonder what a quarter cup of hot water costs, that the staff hurried to take away the cup/ tea leaves and told us they are not supposed to provide hot water. That really baffled us. Disappointing really. With all the decor and popularity..All is lost because of silly staff behaviour. They need to be trained properly I guess.

A well deserving place of geting 4.5 rating and every dish and decor prove that clearly.Each and every bite of the dishes gives you utmost satisfaction. :D .
Proud Bengalis as well as Feluda addicted foodies will definitely fall in love with this place. But I must say Feluda theme music or any sort of Rabindra sangeet would be much better than those western songs.
 Ignoring this last point, this is a place of worth visiting.

Food: unbelievably good. I don't have anything else to say.. The dishes were too toooo good(finger licking literally!!😂😂) Try the chicken platter, honey ginger tea,they were just mouth watering and how can I miss that delicious brownie with ice cream 😍😍
One thing I really wanna suggest is, if they starts playing feluda theme songs it will add some more punch to this beautiful place!

Heard a lot about this place, and finally got the time to visit this. This had a CCD vibe (minus their overpriced food) and one can spend long time over here, which we did. :D
The staffs are very well natured, and my only complaint would be not being able to get a seat at their upper level. The atmosphere was very good. Now coming to the food we ordered the following

Chicken Platter - Delicious!! Everything was delicious. The sausages, the ham, everything was tasty. A very simple, yet awesome dish.

Tinkori Babur Hot Chocolate - A picture says, a thousand words. Please see the pic, you will understand. And, it was equally tasty. It pained me a lot to consume it, due to the beauty of it. I will definitely order this again.
Chocolate Meghraj (Milkshake) - Another heavenly treat!! A delight in both fronts, visual as well as in taste.
Definitely give this place a visit!!!

Awesome bengali themed decor is the USP of this cafe. Has an outdoor seating area where smoking is allowed. Coming to the food, we ordered a Barbeque chicken pizza. It came after quite some time. I felt it was less spicy as the only topping was chicken & onion. The cheese was adequate on the thin crust. The cafe was not filled to capacity when we were there but still we were "hinted" to leave as we were asked for the bill & then asked whether we will order more food. I was engaged in a conversation with my friend but had to leave. Anyways, apart from that the decor & food was upto the mark.

Went there with two of my friends last week! we had ordered a cappuccino, the tiramisu coffee, a mochaccino, the meat platter and grilled chicken! I loved the mochaccino and cappuccino but the tiramisu coffee, not that much, it was quite bitter to my taste! The mashed potatoes below the grilled chicken took away the taste, so disliked it as well! the bread, in both the dishes, smelt and tasted weird! The taste of the ham slices weren't that good either! Liked the sausages and salamis, though. The ambience is nice with a unique "Feluda" themed menu card and decor!

Over hyped, though the ambience is a perfect adda zone. Pocket pinch isn't much of an issue though.
We ordered, Irish coffee- 3.5/5, Chicken omlet-3/5,
Chicken wrap-4.5/5 ( it was a piece of heaven in mouth though). Caramel castard-3/5 and an average chocolate pastry-3/5. This place is good for a budget coffee date. 
Coming back?
Mm.. never.

Well let me make this very clear at the outset that this is very very personal... the behaviour of the staff is completely unacceptable ... 
I and my group were regulars at the cafe and we were always asked to accommodate guests when there were not enough tables available.. the service and service standards are below par .. to get the menu card on the table table takes more than 10 mins even when the cafe is not full.. staff take their own sweet time to take the orders and service the ordered items takes an eternity to arrive .. tables are usually dirty with common plastic bottles provided for drinking water ... 
the food quality and quantity are not balanced with the price... 
It’s a difficult task to find the walnut in the walnut brownies... probably inspiring us to be felu-da in the felu-da themed cafe.. 
Last but not the least , there is always a polite way of handling guests even when you cannot assist them with what they want ... but the staff is far from being polite and blatantly rude .. being an x-regular visitor I feel that if I had visited another place my presence would have been more valued... it was not the food or the ambience that attracted me but my friends... start valuing people or else people will not value you...

This place is located at Jodhpur Park and is one such cafe which stands out in my view. This place is doing justice to its  name and maintaining the stature of it with utmost zeal. The moment you enter you will get that vibe of cinematic aura. The place is well decorated with books not only of Feluda but of different genres and writers. Not only books, it has carrom boards, the best part is that they sell a lot of things like lamps, post cards, bags and lots more. The cushions are well customized with Feluda and other characters at the backdrop. Food is quite good and is cheaper than other cafes.


The menu card us also so unique where you can find the details of naming it "Abar Baithak".

Tiramisu coffee is something which is trending so I had cold tiramisu coffee. They can give you hot tiramisu as well if you want.The normal Cappuccino is also great. The polo sauna is mainly 5pieces of chicken serves with hot garlic red chilli sauce. 

It is great place to have conversation over cover and light snacks. They have quite a lot of variety like platters, grilled fish in their food items so explore it and eat what you want to. 

Happy eating.

Had one friends get together here on choturthi afternoon. The place is well decorated but the time we entered it was crowded and the staffs were not attentive at all. We asked for caramel Cappuccinos and French fries to accompany with. They told us French fries won't be available but we saw other customers were being served. We settled for fish fingers instead. Coffee was very good but the fish was not fresh at all. Some what dry instead. I planned to have some platter afterwards but discouraged I was, changed the plan. Price wise also not so pocket friendly.

Visited this place almost 6 months ago with a friend. There are two sections of the café. We sat in the AC section. Ambience is very nice. There is a carrom board, a bookshelf, an aquarium. The interior is very decorated. There are seating arrangements upstairs as well. 

We ordered a cold coffee with chocolate sauce and virgin mojito. The cold coffee was served in a big glass. The quantity was huge. Taste was quite nice too compared to it's price, though I didn't find chocolate sauce in it for which I was charged extra. I was almost full after having it. The Virgin Mojito was a bit sour. I didn't like it much. 

Service is on the slower side. Prices are moderate. Would visit this place again hopefully. The only thing for which they are lagging behind a few other cafés is because their menu doesn't have much variety. One doesn't get to choose. There aren't many options for sandwiches or shakes,etc.

Bullshit place .. dirty tables .. staff does not care .. food is sub standard.. I walked in and found out that I have to buy a coupon if I sit outside in the open area.. roadside dogs keep walking in and no one is bothered .. dirty loo.. staff tends to shut lights once its time not bothered if there is food on the customers plate... u will not find the rule of buying a coupon for sitting outside printed anywhere .. I went to have coffee but way I was treated was completely unacceptable ... I’ll post the pics of the dog entering shortly ..

The breakfast was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We tried the All Meat Platter, Baked omlet, tiramisu coffee and caramel coffee. Everything was picture perfect except for probably the baked omlet which could have been better.
But the ambience is what made it stand apart. It is pleasant, soothing and definitely a paradise for people liking old school things.

This place doesn't need any intro..All I can say a feluda themed cafe filled with nostalgia!! Take my first step in this cafe n my heart's say I'll surely love this place! From the decoration,the carrom board, Maganlal Meghraj table, feluda library to the warm staff everything was just "picture perfect" we had the chance to see a band was performing,lucky enough to take a part of this. Coming to the food we had chicken kebabs sandwich,grilled chicken & of course brownie with hot chocolate ice cream made our day. Kudos to the owner n the thought maker. To all the feluda fans just go n grab your seat!!

This place has a very bengali feel to it. Feluda themed decor certainly has an immense appeal. And then coupled with good music and a very soothing ambience makes a perfect place for friendly hangouts. The snacks served is very fresh  and refreshing. We tried the cappucinno, sheekh kabab chicken sandwich and fish fingers. All were sumptuous. The servers and the service is also very friendly.Will try the other delicacies and will be back for more.

Well I had Abar Baithok in  my priority list for quit a long time,so this weekend I finally went for it.The restaurant rather the cafe is in Jodhpur park,approx 2min walk from South city mall.
The interior will u give a very warm feeling,walls,glass all have tales of famous Feluda and Bomkesh Bakshi (which are also my favourite novels😇).The decor has very warm tone colors into it.Even the menu card have Feluda stories into it.,which kind of gave me a very nostalgic feeling.

Coming to the food,I ordered:
1.Chicken Sekh Kebab Sandwich - Very tasty,have great flavours. 8/10
2.Chicken Barbeque Sausage and Onion Pizza- It was very avg for me,you can totally skip it.5/10
3.Ice cream, brownie and hot chocolate sauce- This is a must try from a of you.The brownie is crunchy, fluffy which is not so common for a nirmal brownie and the sweetness is atit extract level.10/10
4.Lassi- Simple,home made type, bathing fancy .6/10
5.Fresh Lime Soda- The lime was very salty,I clearly didn't like.2/10
Pich in pocket :
Well ,as for me it is definitely does burn hole into ur pocket ,it is decently prices.
Overall I liked the cafe and will surely visit again

Date: 28/10/2017
Time: 19.00 hrs

Intro: On this particular lazy Saturday evening, the missus picked this place for our evening chaa and taa affair.
This, abar baithak is the reincarnated version of the previously know baithak located in the bylanes of southern avenue, home of the revered Feluda. Only this time, to get away from the evil plans of maganlal meghraj they shifted their base to the bylanes of Jodhpur park!! 

Location: Coming from Anwar Shah one has to take the lane adjacent to EDF hospital ground, go straight till the end of the road, then turn left and go a bit further and there it is , voila!!

Ambience: This place exudes the authentic bangali cafe culture. It, welcomed us with its lazy yellow lights, perfectly creating ambience for adda ; a carom board on the outside open space with people playing a round or two, usual wooden chair n table for seating. Abar baithak's ambience is epitome of the word chill , in Bengali, lyadh! They also have a wooden mezzanine floor for seating.

Service: In this area, however, they weren't even one bit slacking. The place is usually a weekend favourite adda place among many, so it's usually cramped n crowded. But , they quickly arranged a table for us. Also upon ordering food, they were exceptionally fast in service.

Food: coming to the main part; we ordered an all meat platter as our 'taa' with two cups of ushno uttarakhand chaa.
The meat platter came in no time. It's a loaded meat platter: with two pieces of grilled chicken sausage, 3_4 pieces of sauted chicken salami, couple of strips of fried bacon, another couple of pieces of fried ham, an egg poach , with two pieces of cheese wrapped toast and a generous amount of mayonnaise dip.
The meats were cooked or grilled to perfection and the bacon was juicy , the way I like it.
The chaa on the other hand was aromatic & strong.
After finishing this round of taa, I was still left hungry and ordered a tortilla chicken wrap. 
Again, it was served in no time. A Tortilla bread grilled and filled with loads of chicken chunks, usual veggies , covered in generous amount of mayo n cheese was absolutely a stunner. It was both lipsmacking delicious and filling.

Cost: it costed us approx 600 bux.

Overall: it's a lovely place, pretty cheap and decent for group adda , with attendants being prompt and courteous and perfect weekend lyadh ambience!

Visited the shop with two friends from work. First thing that catches the eye is the casual and laidback ambience which makes it feel the right place for that adda over a steaming cup of tea or coffee ( or even cold coffee and milkshakes). What I liked best was the carrom board outside and the shelf full of books on the ground floor from where you can actually pick and read. The café's interiors are based on a setting from the Feluda novel, "Joy Baba Felunath" (Maganlal Meghraj's 'Baithakkhana', to be specific, for those in the know). Even the menu has excerpts from Feluda novels, which is a nice touch.  
Coming to the food, quality and quantity is at par with other leading cafés. In fact it's cheaper if compared especially to CCD and Barista. We had Chicken Salami sandwiches, cold coffee and a choco cigar tea. All items were good (I would personally make special mention of the tea, though reason might be that while I have had sandwiches and cold coffee elsewhere, the tea was a novelty to me).The only reason I did not give it a full 5 on 5 is because I think the staff could be a bit more proactive. 
All in all its a nice cosy place which I would visit again especially for the ambience and decor.

I had heard good reviews about this place from many of my friends and decided to pay a visit on the day before yesterday for a bit of dessert escapade. We had ordered Brownie with Hot Chocolate and Ice Cream, Strawberry Milkshake and Affogato. The Brownie was nice, though lacking the visual pleasure that it highly commands. The brownie was also cut unevenly making the ice cream topple to the sides of the dish. All in all, a messy affair. The Affogato (pic attached) was a sight to behold!! Alas, it managed to titillate our taste buds in the worst ways imaginable. For a lack of better words, it was more like an ice cream soup with crunchy Nescafe sprinkled in between. The Strawberry Milkshake somehow managed to be the unlikely saving grace.
As far as the ambiance goes, it fails to score big. We also had the (dis)pleasure of experiencing star tantrums first hand when we saw a certain singer(who will not be named) shouting excessively at the waiters. All in all, we experienced a less than mediocre ambiance with mediocre food quality. I hope to visit again sometime in the future with the expectation of a better experience.

This place is less like restaurant, more like a place for adda with sumptuous food arrangement. There is a separate sitting arrangement for " buddhir goray dhoa", carom board, a board with gist of all feluda story in chronological order and much more with bong retro essence. We had oolang tea,kashmiri khawa tea and uttarakhand tea, french fries, Quattro fourmaggio, french kiss and grilled chicken with vegetables and smashed potatoes. Fourmaggio(cheese crust pizza) was excellent. And the rest of the food was also good. 
Visit this place with friends, cousin and have fun!

The food and Beverages here are awesomely prepared and served with elegant beauty of plating style. 

A must weekend visit for long unforgettable addas.

Visited this place on a Monday afternoon. Very close to EDF Hospital in Jodhpur Park. Nice little cafe. The decor is interesting. Lots of books all around.

But the Staff, Service and food are average. We were given a menu card, which did not have half of the menu (as it was torn). Then we were given a full menu. Lot of staff at the counter but hardly any guest focus.

I ordered 2 Cappuccino and a Chicken Sandwich. Both were just Ok. Nothing great.

If you ignore the staff and not so fussy about food, the place is a quiet and peaceful cafe.

Ambience : Peppy and innovative
Food/ Drink : Water melon flavored iced tea , first flush and second flush teas , americano, hazelnut coffee, lassi, fish finger and a mushroom dish - all very nice and well done
Service : Pathetic. Even when the tables were empty the servers were hurrying for more orders or the bill payment - so much so that we had to call the manager and complain. This part was really irritating and probably stop me from visiting the place again. 

The overall rating is notched down due to the service.

very disappointed with the place. Went there as it had very good reviews and is very close to my place. Below are the reasons of my disappointment
1) We went for a saturday brunch and most items in the already small menu was not available.
2) staff were talking loudly among themselves.
3) Juices are not fresh
4) i bought some natural skin products from them which were on 10 % discount. They forgot to apply the discount after coming back i notices they had not applied the discount i called them and they agreed they will pass on the discount through paytym. Am yet to get the discount even after 7 hours.

An over hyped place with not very courteous staffs. The Food wasn't even worth the price. We wasted an afternoon visiting Abar Baithak! 
Have been to many restaurants and Cafés where they allow people to celebrate birthdays, they don't even give you that freedom. 
Never visiting again, for sure.

Atlast I was there to soak in the essence of Feluda and Mr. Ray. Took my first step in this cafe and I knew I will love it. The iconic green ambassador, the carrom board, Feluda library and the warm staff, everything was perfect. We got the chance to seat in the Maganlal Meghraj chamber which made me excited like a little girl. Coming to the food, cappuchino was a must, and along with it we ordered sheekh kebab sandwich, chicken platter, grilled chicken and a chicken tortilla wrap. Food was good, even though we would have been happier if the coffee arrived a bit hotter and the grilled chicken was a bit let down. But the ambiance, decor and the feel was amazing. Kudos to the thought and thanks for opening a cafe which was a tribute to Feluda and opens its door to all the Feluda maniac like myself.

Well this place doesn't need any introduction as it is already very famous.

The aura of this place is what draws many young people here.Such a great vibe this place has. It's lively, vibrant, and chilled out.

I did not feel the food was worth the Price. The food was decent not that amazing and definitely did not feel worth it. The only thing that I really liked was the decor. 

Value for money- I felt some items were a bit overpriced as compared to the taste and quantity.
But overall it's a very nice place to be with friends and enjoy your morning time.

Overall I had a good experience here except for the minor hiccups in some food items. The pricing is not extremely affordable but not very heavy on the pocket either somewhere in between.  The quality and quantity was just okay. The service is fast paced, it takes about 7-10 minutes for each item to be prepared. The servers are friendly.

Overall i liked the place and it or the other branches deserve a second try.

Parking is available. 18 percent gst charged separately. Outdoor sitting available for future cancer patients i.e for smokers and definitely for non smokers too :p And carrom game is available too.

Abar asbo at Abar Baithak..... A beautiful cafe just around the Jodhpur park packed with good munches and books. 

After a talk with the waiter he got me an Irish Coffee, Chicken platter and Club Sandwich. The club sandwicnh I had is not there in the menu as on my request they had prepared my sandwich with scrambled eggs instead of pork.

The Irish Coffee was a bit different that those I had earlier, actually the ones I had earlier were Indian Irish Coffee(normal milk coffee with a whiskey smell) and the one at Abar Baithak was just the one I wanted. the cream on the top was perfect. 

The chicken platter was okay, I felt it lagged a bit seasoning.

The Club Sandwich needed a bit extra grill but flavour wise it was well done. 

Was looking forward to some old bengali classics on the speakers but sadly didn't get to hear any.

The people serving there are extremely courteous and are always wearing a smile.

Coming to food, the All Meat Platter is a must try. Coffe tastes good, nothing special. 
Always crowded, this place located in Jodhpur park, is really affordable for college students.

Was hoping to give a visit to this place from a long time and finally got the opportunity to! Located at Jodhpur Park, this place has a cosy ambiance with both indoor and outdoor seating. The carrom, dart and ludo playing arrangements are appreciable as well. On my first visit I chose Virgin Mojito and All Meat Platter. The all meat platter would definetly cater to your tounge's meaty savour while the mojito giving it a refreshing touch.
Perfect for an evening date or a group meet up with old friends!

I ordered one Chicken Platter, one Cappucchino and one Mochaccino. The Platter tastes okay but i totally loved the Coffee. The cafe is perfect for a low budget date or meet up with your friends.

Good place to hangout. Great decoration with some lovely stuff like books and etc. They have some uncommon items in their menu. Quality of food is ok. Nice atmos but they should work on their stuff service and music to make it better. Lastly according to me if you want a pocket friendly evening, you must visit it.

This place is just love. I find this place absolutely fit for friends. Quite economical. Foods taste good. My favourite being hazelnut coffee. U can sit and share your hearts out for few hours. Perfectly decorated. Provision for indoor games is again another plus point. A must-Visit place in your list.

Lovely place...calcuttan vibes. Feluda based theme. Nice dector. Well decorated with artifacts from feluda stories. It's a very cool cafe to hangout with friends to gossip over a cup of coffee or sandwich. You can ever play carrom or dart or spend time by looking into the books. Yummy food menu and pudding in desert. I moreover love the platter and pizzas. I will suggest platter , which is so much yummy with 5 diff food items . The tea is also good. If u are a tea lover u can try tea. There are varieties of tea preparations.
In short a must visit place for feluda fans.

Wanted to give 0 stars but unfortunately zomato lacks that feature. Advice to management (which is not there at all) if you want to have returning customers make a list to write the names of customer in queue. Local people are coming in and calling your staff with names suffixed by "Da" and getting a place to sit whereas other not so local people are waiting outside for 40 mins. When you ask you are told they were there from before but for the last 40 mins you have not seen them around. Staff lacks attitude and if you stick a 50 rupee note in their hands you will be assured a place to sit probably. The is a Mug which is blue in color nearby and that will be a much better place to be.

I am yet to get over the awesomeness of this place.This place has been on my bucket list for a very long time now and I am glad to have had it ticked off my list finally.From the outside this cafe would not look very spacious to you but just wait till you get inside.It will be one beautiful and amazing experience I assure you.The interiors are done up excellently with plushy and comfy armchairs and little glass tables.The place has a smoking zone too and also has board games for the interested.Additionally,there is an upper storey to this cafe,which is a major plus as far as seating is concerned.There are bookshelves galore and books on sale too.You might just want to pick one up while sipping on your tea or coffee.Coming to the food,we had ordered a Quattro Formaggio(Four Cheeze Pizza) and it was DELIGHTFUL.The quality of the Cheeze was the best i have ever had honestly.We also tried one of their many varieties of tea and that came out quite good too.The staff behaviour was okay.Altogether a very pleasant experience.Hope to return here soon.

Was there yesterday .
#Food quality to Cost ratio is great.
#Ambience is top rated,
#The Place is filled with Books, You can read them or can buy them too.
#It is Felu da themed, as a bengali I like it very much.

BUT

#Crew are not quite trained , They are friendly and polite but not good with their response.
you need to shout just to order something or to ask for the bill.
#The Menu they provide is in really bad shape. we had to assemble it just to check out the list.
#Items they provide is limited.

Overall,  it is good place, Sorry great place to hangout with friends and family. Will visit again soon.

I loved every bit of this place.The place is full of emotion. The set-up of this cafe is just "wow". And yes if you are a Feluda fan then you are just going to love it more as the theme of the place is related to Feluda. The Wooden staircase is a charm.The place is stuffed with some good books.The seating arrangements of this place is also well decorated. (Both inside and outside). The area inside is air conditioned with two floors.You can get the feel of Paash Balish too. The place is perfect for adda with your friends.Coming to food,we ordered:1)Chicken Platter that consist of Chicken sausage, Chicken salami, Chicken Ham, Egg Poach and Cheese Toast2)Ice Cream Sandwich3)Plain Lassi4)Chicken Sandwich5)Chicken Salami SandwichFood was tasty. Pricing was decent as well.

An amazing place this is a cafe that looks like as if it has come out of a typical story book. Not only because of being a Feluda fan but also the way the entire cafe has been setup is simple marvellous.The sitting arrangements are brilliant as well which makes it a perfect place for hanging out with friends and having little chitchat. The waiters are courteous plus the food as well as beverages served are good. Every corner of this cafe reminds me a page out of Satyajit Ray’s classic creation and gives a feeling of nostalgia of the childhood days when without finishing reading feluda we would not go to sleep. The books kept over the shelf also adds to the charm of the environment of this cafe. The prices are quite reasonable. Overall a great place and a must visit for people from every age group especially for the ones who want to spend some good old times with their old friends.:D

Located at Jodhpur park. It is one of the most visited cafe in south Kolkata. Seemed a perfect place to have a decent breakfast. Lot of options to choose from. Of them the all meat platter seemed the best. The quantity is sufficient for one and rate is reasonable too.  Nice place for hanging out with friends as one can get variety of games. The service is a bit disappointing. But if you can ignore the service part and want have some quality time with your friends with some delicious platter, then this is a must visit.

Cute little cafe, tastefully decorated.
We had two coffees, a side of fish fingers and a blueberry muffin.
Coffee was 👌🏼, fish fingers were ok, muffin was a tad bit too sweet for my liking. Overall a nice place to chill and hangout, or catch up on some reading. Wish the smell of smoke wouldn’t be strong at the entrance, even if it’s other customers smoking - why should I be subjected to passive smoking and it’s healthy benefits 🤷🏻‍♀️

One little feedback would be to tidy the toilet. It’s a sore thumb in an otherwise perfectly decorated cafe. Recommend!

This places charges GST on each dish and also on the total, which is really not acceptable as it is really not worth the hype.
Located in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park, this little quaint serves okayish food. Lovely decor. Sitting arrangement is there both inside as well as outside (preferably for smokers). Service was okayish. French fries were nice and Chicken Mini burgers were good but quantity wise they were toooo mini a burger as it ends on one bite only. Never try the Iced Tea Earl(something like this) as it was really not worth it or rather it was tasteless. Hot chocolate (non-spicy) mexican style was good. All over experience was not upto the mark. Would not like to visit again unless anybody invites me.. Lolzz!!

In recent times, Jodhpur Park  have been getting gifted with lots of quaint and unusally good Cafes and this is one of those hidden gems. A chilled out decor some, some amazing food and exceptionally good food with great value for money. This is a place that will cater to both classes as well as masses.
I really liked the meat platter simply because of its variety and the price.
I also tried a variation of chicken piccata/croquette which was amazing too.
Only one suggestion that i would like to give is the option for dips with these starters was not decadent.
Apart from this everything is pretty awesome if you are looking to just hang and have something to munch.

This is definitely one of the most popular cafe in the Jodhpur park area. It is located in a calm area away from the hassle of the busy roads of Dhakuria. The ambience is quite nice, there are a lot of games that you can opt for when you are in a big group. The cafe is also nice for spending some alone time studying story books or doing other stuff. The food is quite delicious. The All Meat Platter is fantastic. The quantity is adequate and the rate is reasonable as well. I would definitely like to recommend it if someone visits this cafe. The sandwiches were good as well but comparatively they were a bit expensive. You should never order the crab meat sandwich. It's awful. There is nothing much mention worthy in the cappuccino though. But the service is a bit turn off, the staffs were inefficient when the crowd was big. Now if you don't care about the service part and want to have a carefree adda with some magnificent platter then this is the place for you.

Abar Baithak is a quaint little cafe tucked away in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park that didn't happen to me until last Sunday. This place has certainly hit the sweet spot of Bengali emotions with that neatly done Feluda theme! Every Ray fan has to come here, and if they by chance drop in (like me), they are sure to fall in love with this place and its nitty gritty! The place has ample seating arrangements spread out in two levels, we climbed up the classy wooden stairs to take the iconic Maganlal's signature seat flanked by that 'pash balish'. We were more than happy after getting that special nook in the otherwise buzzing and jam packed adda zone!! 

Coming to the food, we ordered for All meat platter having chicken sausage and salami, pork ham bacon, cheese toasts and poached egg. This was pretty good to taste and quite a nice option for early evening meal or maybe for breakfast. Apart from this we tried the fish fingers and French fries as well. Also I liked the Caramel cold coffee which I am surely gonna order next time. The strawberry tornado shake didn't have that punch in it and I didn't like it. The peanut butter/banana/honey/caramel shake was also good and each flavour was distinct which was pretty amazing! Overall the food and beverages were good, but nothing out of the world. 

The prices are reasonable and servers are prompt but they aren't warm. On a busy day they will come to you and ask you indirectly to vacate the table, like they did with us! Minus 0.5 for that. Next time I will visit when there'll be some live performances, hope that'll give me a better experience. Overall, a nice adda zone for Feluda fans with Bangaliana oozing from every nook and corner of this establishment.

Cheers!

More than anything it scores with it's ambience. Though located a little inside from the main road it can be easily found. In fact the quaint location is a big advantage for self-driven cars because you can park it anywhere and everywhere in and around the cafe.

It's more suited for group meets, irrespective of age, rather than a cosy romantic date. Luckily I was there for a reunion with friends and so the ambience suited me perfectly. The upper deck is a fab place to chit-chat. 

They have enough food options for a cafe as well, specially on the tea segment. Loved their fries, fish and chips and the variants of teas. They also have a lovely souvenir corner as well. The service guys are very decent and there with a smile. Service is pretty prompt too.

Only one suggestion... get yourself a bigger place. It gets a little crampy when full.

Lassi was awesome and quality of platters was   good enough for your spends

I am writing this after my second visit to the cafe, on the day of Ashtami. It is located in a quite locale in Jodhpur Park and it is very easy to find. Go straight and left from EEDF Taratala, and that's it.

The ambience is one of the best features of the place, and the interior is Feluda themed and very "bookwormy" (no, that's not a word).

The staff isn't overly friendly but not arrogant either... they are always ready to assist (though they didn't remember an item we had ordered).

We ordered a Chicken Ham Sandwich, Fish a late Munieree, Passion Fruit Mojito and two Brownies. They charged way too much for a topping of fresh cream on the brownies though. But apart from That, the food was delicious and the menu was varied.

The place is great for some late afternoon adds with friends (carton boards, vintage typewriters, harmonium and lots and lots of books to keep company). I'm definitely coming back here and trying out the other Continental dishes. They sound amazing!

Located at Jodhpur park,this place has a beautiful homely interior with an outside smoking+seating area.

Food- the food here is good, especially the all meat platter which is favourite among all.
Value for money.
I have also tried their all meat wrap nd chicken wrap,which tastes delicious.
Bread on mushroom sauce is good too, but i felt it was a bit bland.
Drinks: drinks are definitely value of money.Their fresh lime soda is what i prefer the most.

Overall a very good place to chill

Located near Jodhpar Park, this is an excellent place to catch up with your friends, and spend some quality time with your loved ones. The cafe is themed upon the love of bengali people for Adda over a cup of tea.
They serve quality food at a reasonable rate. On our first visit to this place, we ordered chicken platter, chocolate meghraaj and lime soda. Food was great, drinks were excellent. A food menu filled with nostalgia of bengali literature is surely an added bonus.

Over rated like hell !   The crunchy tira misu is sweet and there is no crunch.  They just don't know what Grilled chicken is .. the quantity will fill up a 2 year old only.   One piece. That too with cheese on top and potato below .  No pepper sauce in spite of specifically asking about it while ordering. God knows what's so great about this place.  Just the brownie was nice.  Even the caramel custard was so so.  Earlier - u had to walk down to the counter to order and pay - thank god not anymore.  But if they give such grilled chicken for ₹250 plus GST - I would rather go to blue mug or wise owl or even bikers cafe.

The chicken wrap is just excellent, peanutbutter oreo chocolate shake is beyond imagination. I have been visiting abar baithak quite a number of time now! And i definately love the quantity
 .. quatinty and quality is what matters and thanks for not compromising on that. 
The window on the table no. 21 is really dirty outside was suggest to put curtains or even images on vinyl and cover the window so that sunlight can still come in but the spider nest and all cant be seen.

The ambience and the food .. too gooooood. Not always that i like adda but on the days i like to do i land up here. The chicken wrap is just excellent, peanutbutter oreo chocolate shake is beyond imagination. I have been visiting abar baithak quite a number of time now! And i definately love the quantity
 .. quatinty and quality is what matters and thanks for not compromising on that. 
The window on the table no. 21 is really dirty outside was suggest to put curtains or even images on vinyl and cover the window so that sunlight can still come in but the spider nest and all cant be seen. 
Cheers to good foooood staff and ambiance.

Abar Baithak -
Loved this Feluda themed cafe at Jodhpur Park, Kolkata. Fantastic decor and ambiance. Always kind of crowded with customers of all ages. Nice place for typical bengali adda with new-age cafe experience.
We ordered for following.Foods are yummy and price is affordable.
1. All Meat Platter (Chicken Sausages, Chicken Salami, Pork Ham, Bacon​, Egg poach, Cheese Toast)
2.Kashmiri Khawa Tea and Lemongrass Marigold Tea
3. Peanut Butter, Banana, Honey and Caramel Milkshake
4.Peanut Butter, Chocolate and Oreo Milkshake
5.Crunchy Tiramishu Milkshake.

Been there before and after they shifted it. Honestly, the ambience hasn't changed much.
The decor has improved vastly.
I live their theme - Feluda. One of my all time favourite characters.

Apart from the food and tea, don't forget to try their French Kiss.
To sum it up, Quirky decor - witty waiters - nice ambience - good food is what Abar Baithak is.

This place is located near to jodhpur park a bit interior to jodhpur park but its easy to locate 😊😊
This place has a beautiful decor which is based on the theme of FELUDA..... Its totally a unique one 👌👌
A cozy and comfortable seating arrangement where people can eat sit chat enjoy ❤❤
Coming to the food we ordered:- Chicken platter, Meat platter,Coldcoffee,Iced mocha,Barbeque chicken sausages and onion pizza,olive chicken stuffed,brownie with hot chocolate and icecream
Coming to the quality:- Both the platter simply tasted perfect 👌👌, cold coffee was fine though i loved the iced mocha more, but the pizza was pathetic the cheese they placed was not at all hot and when they double baked it, the pizza simply tasted like burned out chappatis😑😑,the continental dish was yummm😍😍and brownie with hot chocolate and icecream was totally love❤❤
Overall a nice experience ✌✌ recommended😊😊

Way too overpriced. Ambiance is the only thing that would draw a person here. The "baithakkhana" upstairs is quite comfortable, and filled with Feluda memorabilia. Board games are plentiful, and Abar Baithak is a good place for a "Baithak."

We ordered iced teas, and given that they were made using readymade iced tea sachets and a lot of sugar, paying in three digits for it was quite unsatisfactory.
The sandwiches were okay-ish. Nothing too fancy.

Plan on visiting only if it's the first week of the month.

A feel good cafe that allows you to relax and enjoy a good adda session over good food and beverages. The menu is loosely based on Keventer's Darjeeling ,although it has a few original dishes too. The amazingly wide options of  tea ,coffee and other beverages are another feather to the cap. The gaming area ,though a bit small, is cosy enough. P. S  - Feluda lovers are going to have a good time,given the theme of the restaurant. :)

Not worth the hype. 
Pro: strawberry tornado was the best I have had in life. Fish and chips with dip. Spot on. Ambiance and services. Impressive. 
Con : meat platter = super over hyped. 
Mushroom with bread = balnd. 
You can visit for a friendly get together and enjoy the homely ambience and have a great time but for foodies it's just average.

One of the best cafes in Kolkata! A real gem located in Jodhpur park. The theme of this cafe is based on Felluda. The ambience is so nice. A perfect place for Bengali addas. The food is awesome. We ordered tinkori babur hot chocolate, ushno Uttarakhand, chicken platter, vanilla milkshake,affogato with chocolate sauce. The staffs are very polite. There is a small bookshelf where the books are for sale. All I can say is this place is beyond perfection.

Located in a quiet neighborhood of South Kolkata, this place is a must visit for people looking for a place to spend some quiet, quality time, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Abar Baithak celebrates Satyajit Ray and every corner of this café reminds you of Ray's works. From the walls, to the cushions, the menu book, or even the window panes, everything is a recreation of some of Ray's unforgettable fictional characters. You get to choose from a variety of beverages and finger foods. We ordered Chicken sandwiches, Iced Mocha and Colf Coffee. Everything was delicious and wonderfully presented. Once you've been to this place, you feel like coming back again and again.
P. S, During the daytime, the first floor is naturally lit with just the right amount of sunlight pouring in through the painted glass windows!

Want to relish adda sessions in a Bengali way? Visit Abar Baithak Café. You are bound to be engulfed in the nostalgia of Feluda. From decor to menu Feluda dominates. The place has a good collection of books. They even have a collection of CD's and hand painted coffee mugs and tea cups.@  Personally I have visited the place twice, once alone and the other time with my friend.I have tried chicken platter, all meat platter , fish fingers,green apple mojito, cold coffee & tortilla wrap. The food compliments the place further, it's simply delicious & at affordable rate.An excellent place to hangout & read on.

Went for a late evening coffee!! Its situated inside a peaceful locality of jodhpur park.

Ambiance: Its 2 storeyed building with a heritage kind of feeling. Wooden staircase with old bengali cultural paintings and posters. Its a great place writers and musicians to come up with something new as the place inspires you to come up with something with a vibe it creates with its biance. They have different kind of seating arrangements too...outside for smoking and inside with seating arrangement on a bed too..

Food: We ordered toast with white mushrrom sauce which was heavenly I must say @120 only. Also, we ordered cold coffee and darjelling tea. I must say Cold coffee was the authentic cold coffee we had because most of the places gives cold coffee where coffee flavour lacks but here you get that rich flavour of coffee.

Service: It was fast and the staffs were too good. 

I would highly recommend this place to visit. It is one of the best pocket friendly cafe in Kolkata. The price is so cheap and quality you get is excellent.

Food and adda are the two sides of the same coin for a Bengali staying in Calcutta. This has been brought to life by many such new establishments around the city and one of them is Abar Baithak.

This simple yet so well decorated place has it's own kind of ambiance and neither the service nor the food disappoints. The price at this place is not very cheap but its reasonable taking into consideration the quality of the food.

Food and Beverages:

Dishes ranging from simple french fries to pizzas, wraps and desserts are available along with few varieties of mocktails to quench your thirst.
Service and Speciality:
The service provided the staffs at this place makes you feel at home and it does not matter if you have food in front of you or not they will never be in a hurry to get rid of you. They will welcome you and you can spend time for as long as you want. 
The speciality of this place is that from the moment you enter this place through the outdoor sitting area where also you will find a carrom board for your enjoyment , you will feel like you are walking through the nostalgia filled lanes of Calcutta decorated with works of Satyajit Ray and you will not miss out on Tin Tin either. The place solemnly provides a tribute to Feluda and the Bengali culture which is rich and has been alive for more than a hundred years.

If u want to sit somewhere alone and yet not get bored this will be the place. The place is stuffed with some good books which you can flip through while having any of their dishes. 
Coming to food I just tried their wrap which I found quite filling and tasty as well. A nice cosy place to visit again.

This cafeteria is a pretty popular one amongst all the others spread nearby. Decided to treat one close friend here on a Tuesday evening. It  has an outdoor dining area with carom board. The area inside is air conditioned with two floors. We made our way to the floor above. There's a separate room kinda place too suitable for small gatherings with friends and family. We placed an order for a four cheese pizza, a cold coffee and a brownie with ice cream. The cold coffee and brownie were impeccably delicious. The brownie garnished with walnuts and vanilla ice cream was indeed the best. The pizza however was pretty bland. Looked great but lacked in taste. The ambiance is young and trendy. The service is little slow. We had to wait for our pizza for almost 45 minutes while we finished our cold coffee and brownie ( which was supposed to be our dessert).

The theme of this café is enough to pull people like me who are nostalgic with their childhood fantasies.. Yes this café tucked inside the alleys of Jodhpur Park is themed on Feluda.. A place where the entire food menu is conceptualized based on the immortal writings of Satyajit Ray.. The décor is relaxing and in line with the theme- suitable for Bengali’s evergreen Baithaki Adda.. The upper floor is of particular interest for me where you can seat with your legs wrapped around.. They have an outdoor seating as well, few games like carom are also present.. They also have an in-house store where you can buy designer coffee mugs, tees, posters, etc.. Coming to service, you need to place the orders in the counters and the server will deliver the food to your table.. Service time was less and good thing is no one will push you through your meal.. You can relax and enjoy for long hours.. We tasted:
3 Mango Milk Shakes: Heavenly refreshing.. They used fresh mango which makes this a drool worthy experience..
Chocolate Float: Good one too.. Chocolate milk shake with a scoop of ice cream.. Who cares about calories and dieting when you have such purest form of pleasure to entice you..
Watermelon Fizz: Ideal summer drink.. Refreshing, sweet and chilled to perfection..
Virgin Mojito: Slightly more sweet to our likings.. Not recommended..
French Fries: A bit soggy, lacks consistency.. Also a bit bland, could have used a bit more salt or masala..
Mixed Meat Platter: Chicken Sausage, Chicken Salami, Pork Ham Bacon, Egg Poach, Cheese Toast, all served in one humongous plate.. each of the item was cooked with utmost care and tasted delicious, should be tried once..
2 Fish Finger: Fresh, generous in size and not over-fried.. Served with a kick-ass mustard sauce..
Affogato: The name may not be familiar to foodies in Kolkata as such.. Basically affogato means a coffee based desert where ice cream is topped with hot espresso.. Based on my experience, must say this is not at all an authentic affogato.. No trace of coffee whatsoever, instead they used loads of chocolate sauce..
Overall, Abar Baithak is a go to place for genY, college students, young professionals.. A place which is more of a comfort zone where you can visit again and again without burning big hole in your purse.. Our total cheque was Rs. 1650/- (all incl.) for all these food and bevarages consumed by 5 people..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 4/5

Ambiance: 4/5

Abar Baithak is a laid back coffee shop located in the heart of Jodhpur Park and is extremely popular among the residents of the area. The Calcutta themed quirky cafe is buzzing with regular patrons on any given evening, especially on weekends. 

I visited the place on a Saturday evening for a quick catch up with my school friends. The selection of beverages were quite impressive ranging from the basic Lebu Cha (Lemon tea) to the fancy Tiramisu coffee. 

Our order included an Irish coffee, Caramel coffee, cafe latte, cafe frappe and a Tiramisu coffee. For particular coffees they have both hot and cold variants which is plus. The Irish coffee was exactly like the way it should taste. I tasted the Tiramisu coffee for the first time I absolutely loved it. The cafe frappe and Caramel coffee were also good to taste. The latte tasted decent. 

Along with the drinks we ordered Fish and Chips and assorted chicken tit bits comprising of chicken balls and chicken nuggets. The fish and chips consisted of 2 pc bengali styled fish fry accompanied by french fries and tartar sauce. The fish and chips was good to taste however the assorted chicken item tasted very average. 

We were seated outside in the smoking area. Ambiance is fine and seating is comfortable. We did not face an issue with the service as we allowed a lot of time in between orders. The waiters are polite in general. 

Over all a good place to hang out in the Jodhpur Park area. Pricing is decent as well. Bill was around Rs 1500 for all the items ordered

A place where we can walk and talk and eat through the mind of Satyajit Ray! The best decor.
But cafe should work on it's menu.
It should include some more options like absolute VEG rather than having a VEG OMLETE. 
Staff's are friendly.
Price is also moderate.
Overall a good place to hangout and reminiscence your Bangaliana with cup of Tinkori Babur Hot Chocolate. :)

1st of all the staffs should be trained a proper lesson on hospitality ethics... trust me guys your outlet is no favour to us that your staff behaves so rude..sorry for my harsh review but we are annoyed with the behaviour... we were at this cafe around 10:15 pm probably their close down time, when we asked them about the closing time they said whenever their work would get over they would close.. further to that in between our tea they just started switching off the lights with out informing us.  You are not the only cafe in Kolkata but having said that your cafe and its ambiance can be one of the most preferred... plz plz plz take a training session on hospitality for your service staffs...

Been to this place twice. First time, to try this place part of a habit to explore new places. Second time, on insistence of a friend. Both times the experience has been super bad. Very limited menu with pricing on a higher side, plus the staff is incorrigible, uncooperative. Anything that you ask from the menu, is unavailable. Not worth visiting unless you want to experience the service first hand.

Very poor service.. Staffs are least interested in attending customers, no variations in coffee.. everything tastes almost same.. (berrycino being the worst), if you know your food right you would think twice before visiting this place,salads is just a bowl of meat & lettuce with few olives, no cherry tomatoes, bell pepper or even proper seasoning. Mushroom on toast is a platter full of goey mayonnaise mixed with liquid mushroom & two toast on that.. When enquired they forcibly insisted on eating that mentioning that all restuarent doesn't serve same dish but i guess if i ask for biryani and get fried rice, it isn't the same, although i would have meat, rice and veggies in both. Its good as cheap adda place with mindless food. Not for a food lover like me.

The cafe has a unique charm attached with it. Be it the food, beverage or the cozy cushion or the carrom board, the place has everything to offer. Good food along with informal ambience, one should drop in over here at the fastest.. and, who doesn't like Feluda? The maverick in the theme...awesome.

To all the feluda lovers it's a must visit place... Abar baithak is a theme based cafe situated behind EEDF...A cozy place to hang out with friends... We had chicken platter,open sandwich,french fries and chocolate browny ice cream... The food is good and they serve it ASAP... And the best part of this place is it's pocket friendly...

This place had been on my bucket for quite sometime. It has created a lot of buzz as of late and yes, I believe it deserves it. The place has a brilliant decor and bears the theme of Feluda and it truly sets up the perfect mood to sit with friends and have a conversation over some delicious food.
                  We tried out Cold Chocolate milk shake, Corn Sandwich and French fries. The food did not fail to meet our expectations and kept us wanting for more.

FINAL VERDICT- All in all I would say this is a perfect place to hangout with friends while enjoying quality food. Definitely recommended!

Unique ambiance..very well mannered staffs..and good foods too.
We had one Chicken platter..Chicken barbeque sausage pizza and Fish n chips.
Chicken platter was good..the pizza was okayish with less cheese than what a pizza lover would usually expect. Fish n chips was good too.
More than the food, overall its a pretty good place to hangout and have a great time with your loved ones.

Jodhpur Park seems to be a place coming up with popular cafes.. and one more name to the list would be Abar Baithak. The place is comfortable, the decor is nothing fancy but has a minimalistic charm. Talk of the food, I especially liked the tiramisu cold coffee and the chicken tortilla wrap. However, it was said to be mushroom ON a toast, but looked like the toast came on a bed of mushroom made in a highly creamy sauce, rather too creamy than needed. Even though the food was really good, the service here is abysmal. You wait for the menu and water and plates for what seems like eternity. However, the food doesn't take time to come even though they appear in wrong order. I'm being generous with the rating but sincerely the service should improve.

There are some places which are so close to your heart and you can connect with them on a different spiritual level.The same thing happened when I first visited Abar Baithak.I felt like I have known this place for years and the place is so close to me.I went there on a date with my partner and we are in so much love with that place that it has become our favourite date spot😂❤️
The place gives you all the artistic feel and it's actually based on my favourite detective character Feluda who was also my first childhood crush.The cold coffee is so so so beautiful that it feels like how can a simple recipe be blended into something so magical❤️ The cold coffee and pepperoni and meat ball pizza is our personal favourite from Abar Baithak.Their seating arrangement is so cute and beautiful like you can sit upstairs in cute little chairs beside a beautifully done wall art.Tables are even placed outside for people who would like to smoke and they also have a carrom table just making it the perfect hangout spot for friends.Bengalis are known to live for adda and Abar Baithak perfectly portrays it :D Tbh I hate too much people so Abar Baithak is that perfect place to just binge on pizza and a good mug of cold coffee and snuggle with that favourite Satyajit Ray book❤️😌 Every time I forget to click pictures because I am so much in awe of this place :3❤️❤️
Do visit this cafe,it is sure going to win your heart the way it won mine :)

Bangaliana reloaded at Abar Baithak
A place to hang out with amidst ambience that is steeped into bangaliana...well the food is not limited to Bengali though.
The two-storey cafe is quite spacious ( I personally liked the upstairs)....sitting arrangement is also available outside the building
The variety of food is quite impressive as compared to other cafes
Good food and that too in good portions without a pinch in the pocket.
                    
I loved the way they served the tea

The taste of food is very good.. we tried cappucchino, virgin mojito, chicken sandwich and brownie with hot chocolate and ice cream... I really liked virgin mojitao and chicken sandwich. There are many books, which you can buy from this cafe..Booklovers must visit to this place... And this place is also very pocket friendly... It won't burn your pocket.. ☺😋

Don't know what the hype is all about,  had to wait for a table if four, and in the end the food was a total letdown as well as the coffee served.. Any day the beverages served at Ccd are better.. Bad service,  the waiters have attitude issues maybe because  they are always full.. A no no for me

Loved this place. Went with friends , there were six of us. And two of us including me got to seat in the godi by the side of Maganlal Meghraz , but that is not the only reason for the rating. The food , the shakes , was great , we ordered open sandwiches , fish fingers and fish Fry's , and cold coffee. It was so delicious. everything was so homely that we felt that we are at our regular adda zone. Will visit this place again and again. Loved it like anything.

This was the place which I was intending to visit since ages when I finally got a chance to visit here last few days ago. Situated just few metres away from the Jodhpur Park Main Durga Puja Area, This Cafe looks interesting even from outside thought a bit crowded externally due to the smoking area and pool play table being situated outside. There is also a sitting area outside the main premises for the non airconditioned area where you can have your prefered food in the premises of the cafe. The weather was humid and hence I decided to go inside. The soothing chilled and quite spacious cafe made me comfortable with a perfect ambience and light background music playing in the cafe. The staffs initially are quite reluctant but alright. The book shelf all around were full of interesting collection of books which caught my attention. Self service is the rule and I went over the counter and ordered their famous Meat Platter, French Fries and Ushno Uttarakhand Tea. Coming back to the table while the food was preparing, I took a book and started to read without knowing that it was only for sale. The shelfs had the category mentioned in it but nowhere was " Only for Sale " and I did not know. One of their oversmart staff known as Mr. Shivam whose initial impression was Extremely Rude and Unproffessional just popped in out of nowhere as if he was coming to hit me and overthrew his verbal language in such a way that I was taken aback. He just came in and said to me in a such a rude voice as if the books are getting damaged. I was extremely irritated and disgusted as my mood went off due to his hooliganism as my friend calmed me down. The food came in after a turmoil of verbal word fights. Firstly I was served with French Fries, then the Meat Platter and lastly the Tea. The French Fries were quite better than normal because they were crisp and garnished with chat masala which added more flavour to it. I sippped over their Tea which was too hot but flavoured nicely with an unique way of tea bag dipping into the warm water. After finishing this Tea and Fry Duos, I moved to their signature attraction i.e. The Meat Platter..!! Sprinkled with Pepper, The Platter Contained Chicken Sausages, Pork and Ham Salamis, Chicken Salamis, Egg Omllette and Cheese Toast purely filling up the tummy worth money..!! The overall experience after completing the platter was outstanding as the sausages were extremely fresh and tasty and the pork was fantastic. The cheese toast was a lip smacker amongst the meat and a perfect combo with a puffed up omllette. For the food experience, I could have given them 5 out 5 but because of their stupid and illetrate staff which ruined my entire mood delibarately, I will bring down the rating. Had he appologized to me, I would have rethink to upbring the rating but he was constantly arrogant and denied that he did not anything. Other staffs on behalf of him appologized to me and hence I calmed. Else would have slapped him infront of everyone. Anyway, a mixed experience though the food was outstanding overall. They should change these illetrate people who ruins the entire mood of customers or food reviewers who visit their outlet with sheer excitement especially when it is your first time. Do Try Out This Age Old Cafeteria once and Make Sure You Stay Alert Always because of such notorious shits..!!

As far as I am concerned, the award for most unusually themed, and interestingly done up Cafe in Kolkata, goes to... "ABAR BAITHAK". Situated in Jodhpur Park, this place is a Tribute to the most famous Bengali Detective.. "Feluda". The feeling one gets while spending time in this quaint Cafe, can only be experienced, and not written about. I tried the All Meat Platter for Breakfast.. I would have preferred the poached egg to be a bit runny, but, I guess I should have requested the server to make it that way. As far as the meats are concerned, the Ham and Bacon were Pork, but the Salami and Sausage were Chicken. Considering they do have an all Chicken Platter, I would have loved it if the All Meat Platter was really an All Pork Platter.. But, on the whole, super experience and definitely going back to try the other dishes on the Menu... and most definitely going back for the ambience !!!! NOTE : I have never been to a food outlet and taken so many pictures of the place, and so few pictures of the food... #justsaying

A fun place. We met on the top floor which is supposed to be Maganlal Meghraj's bojra and indeed the wooden top floor vibrates if anyone climbs the stairs or moves around the tiny room. We ordered some fancy drinks, hot and cold, coffee with tiramisu flavor, caramel and first flush Darjeeling tea and with it a platter of meat and egg which was pretty filling. Over adda and alochona, we savoured the nourishment and passed a pleasant afternoon with the rain pouring outside. Very pleasant concept indeed. The ambiance is good, the waiters courteous, and the food value for money. I shall highly recommend the place if you are looking to meet your friends or business associates over a cuppa and some filling bites.

Service is good and the ambience will make you feel comfortable right on the go. You can play carom, darts, board games at will. 
Enjoy the milshakes, sandwich and its brownies...

Abar boithok!

What do you expect in Friendship day if not meeting with your pals? It's the tradition you must follow to keep your beats alive in your life. Therefore, that same thing occurred today in my life. And believe me, it takes your soul to heaven when your prolonged desire got fulfilled. Met everyone TOGETHER after so long. Nirvana!

And this reverent rendezvous took place in Abar Boithok. With all chums around, we decreed for Rohini from Second flush 2016: a wonderful preparation of Darjeeling tea; cold coffee; cafe frappe: it looks alike cold coffee however, a bit sweeter than the latter one; and all meat platter which encompasses chicken sausage, chicken salami, pork ham bacon, egg poach and cheese toast. And at the top of delicacies, a kiss was required so rescripted for a French kiss.

Gathering was successful. Happy friendship day candidly replevined its colour.

Ambience is good but too overcrowded. To be honest it is much overhyped and overrated. Food is okayish. Nothing extraordinary! Quantity is too less compared to price. Service is not up to the mark. Pocket pinch is a bit high. Overall my visit to Abar Baithak was just satisfactory, not too likeable!

Went with my friends and was shocked to see the bill for the food and beverages we ordered.... It was exorbitantly high because not only did they charged 18% GST on individual food items but also did charged 18% GST on the sub total amount... Was heavily disappointed by seeing this... There are far better cafés with much better ambience than this.. No point in visiting this awful cafe where the rates are exorbitantly high...

Abat Baithak -- A long pending place on my list and finally got it checked yesterday. Situated at Jodhpur Park, Kolkata.

The staff is very courteous and friendly. This small cafe I'm pretty much sure you'll fall in love with the decors. They also have outdoor and indoor seating option and this place brings back lot of childhood memories. But their foods isn't that good.
                    I ordered a Mango Juice and Lime Mojito, Coffee, Chicken Sandwiches and Non-Veg Platter.

The food came quite on time.
                    

Mango Juice was tasted awesome. 
But Lime Mojito was not that good. 

Coffee looks good. It was good.

I was sort of disappointed with chicken Sandwiches. It was quite salty and despite instructions that I want little or no Vegetables, it was full of Vegetables.

Non-Veg Platter was not that good. Tasted like I wouldn't want to eat it ever again.

I wanted to try a dessert but the food had spoil my mood enough. 

This place is seriously not for a tasteful foodie like me.

I'm never visiting again.

Its been ages guys! Hell yeah and its feels so good to be writing again.. The city of joy calls me to relish the amazing delicacies of the cities and this time its all about a Baithak. 

Abar Baithak is one of the places which was on my bucket list for long and today I finally tick marked it. Yayy! 

Located at Jodhpur Park, Kolkata, this small and cozy coffee house is all about fun, friends and adda.. What else can a Bengali ask for? 

With super amazing and friendly staff members at your service, you are bound to like this place. The ambiance makes me remind of Feluda and I am all game for it. 

This is one of the few places that has an amazing amalgamation of courtesy, delicious dishes and lovely ambience.. 

We had a number of dishes (bhukkad) and I liked each one of them. 

Coffee and chicken platter together makes it for everyone and we were biting each piece with such please. Pricing is really decent (won't say cheap or affordable) but you get what you pay for. 

Please excuse my bad photography skills :D

'Abar Baithak' is a cafe just behind the EEDF hospital that tickles the nostalgic feeling that the great Ray used to once induce at the teen age. The cushions, the menu card, the wallpaper you can find Satyajit everywhere.

The cafe has a really nice crowd. By the time I went there the mezzanine was the only place to offer us a seat. The cafe has arrangements of a few indoor games, a wide variety of books to spend time if you want to spend some alone time.

The order was simple, 2 cups of cappuccino and a serving of Stir Fried Chicken and Veggies. Being a coffee lover, I noticed what we were served with was more of a Cafe Latte than the cappuccino. It was, however, enjoyable. The stir fried veggies were overcooked. Exotic veggies, like bell paper and zucchini, lose most of their texture when cooked more than perfection. This also lacked seasoning and flavour. NOT recommended.

The cafe is worth the second visit, for the coffee it serves at a comparatively lower price than any other cafe in the vicinity.

A very engaging setup, great ambience! It is a small cafe behind EEDF hospital in Jodhpur Park. It used to be on Rajani Sen street but have relocated here around last December. The name has changed from Baithak to Abar Baithak Cafe. It is themed on Satyajit Ray's famous character 'Feluda', apparent from their menu chart. It has a small bengali bookstore on the first floor, originally started by WH Smith bookstores in Europe. It has a small library of books which you can read, some indoor board games, even a carrom board. We loved the novel seating arrangement on the second floor where there is a high up platform with side pillows, typical of a bengali household for relaxed seating and chatting with food, making it a favorite for youngsters, although we found people of all ages visiting it. The furniture and deco are both charming. We would give it a 4 rating for the deco and ambience, even though a little cramped.

I have been there regularly at a point of time. It is a nice place, but can become really crowded and noisy. Although it is fine for me (us).

Americano, Darjeeling and Assam teas were the kind of drinks we went for. In the food section, the Chicken and Chicken Salami Sandwich, Tortilla Wraps and the Chicken Salad were very nice. I found the Chicken wrap a bit soggy, but I would still recommend it, as I found it to be tasty.

There are different board games, including carrom which one can play if they wish to.

I enjoy a visit to this place in a relatively quite time, maybe at noon. Although a visit with friends at busy times are also enjoyable.

Bottom Line: Recommended visit.

Note: Based on experience from establishment to 2016 (before they moved).

The place is one of its kind and it captures the bengali idea of adda culture in a very aesthetic way. Also its themed on the golden period of Bengali literary culture.You can read or buy books form there and play games including carrom.Do try out the chicken platter.

If you're planning to hang out with your buddies.. or need a place to spend some lazy time with your pals.. with the toppings of a pure bong ambience.. then this is the perfect place.. We went in the afternoon which is not at all an ideal time visit a cafe.. but once we went in we felt like we got the perfect place for an absolute adda.. ground floor was well decorated by the upper floor attracted us more.. there's place to accommodate yourselves at the balcony as well.. the best attraction is the bed with pillows provided where u can get up n engross yourselves to a homely gossip..
The only flaws I can state are the place is a bit small.. you may not get a place if u visit at a time of high demand.. n the food menu can be extended to other varieties of delicacies.. n one more thing we had to call the waiter for a number of times to take the order..
Never miss to order for the mixed meat platter which is the best of the lot.. it's not something u will remember for lifetime sort of food.. but foodies will love it.. it contained chicken sausages.. chicken salamis.. ham strips..poached egg n toasted bread..
all in all..the place completes your idle evening.. this place, your buddies n a handful of time.. nothing else is needed to make some memories..

It's a good place to hangout with a group of friends...it has indoor games and lots of books to read. I didn't find any book of my choice though..The ambience is fine as a cafe..
I found the food less in quantity and a bit overpriced..But the taste of what we ordered(Olive Stuffed Chicken) was really nice...I'd suggest if the quantity can be a little increased it'll be better...
We ordered Passionfruit Mojito and Cucumber Fizz..I liked neither of them.. The tastes of the drinks we're so flat that I couldn't enjoy them...Overall I'd like to say it's a good place for snacking...Could be far better though..

A couple of visits to this Feluda themed place, and I decided to review it now. The ambience is pretty much perfect for an evening of Bengali cha er adda with friends. So while you can sit outside in the smoking area, you can also play a game Carrom inside. There are books and magazines to read if you wanna go solo, or sit upstairs with your date. It is a little loud for reading though since the place is almost full during the evenings even on a weeknight. 

Coming to the food. We had Darjeeling tea, Lemongrass marigold tea and a mocaccino during our visits. The beverages taste perfectly fine. 
We did have fish fingers and a dish of Fish & chips. And I felt that the fish on both occasions were kept frozen for too long or since it really didn't taste too well. 
The sandwich was tasty though. So 3.5 /5 for the food. 
Another meeting at abar baithak is definitely due.

Yesterday evening had some pizza & coffee at Abar Baithak, Jodhpur Park with a friend. We went and sat inside & had

Bbq Chicken Sausage & Onion Pizza: It was drizzling outside, so we had pizza inside! Don't know whether it's the weather or the pizza, (I think both) it tasted heavenly. The crust was thin & crispy. I would like to have the pizza many more times. 5/5

Expresso: 3.7/5

Spicy Mexican Hot Chocolate: 3.7/5

I loved the ambience very much. There are good books for sell on the wall. Some were playing carrom at the other corner. There is a spot for reading books. Cushions in the seats had pictures of Feluda trio, loved them. So, It is a great place for spending some time with friends.

A cafe with the touch of classic bengali adda, where you can enjoy your cup with Feluda, Lal Mohan babu or can play carrom, Scrabble with your gang. Good food, perfect ambience for adda, but the service is slow and the waiters are impatient sometimes. A great place for a group of old buddies.

Nothing is as addictive as a Bengali adda. Honestly speaking we Bengalis need no particular joint to host an Adda but a fushion of cafe and bangaliyana sounds cool enough.
This have been hyped for quite a while and that just  added to my curiosity so I decided to drop by not for the Adda but for the food.
I tried a couple of sandwhiches which were okayish and cold coffee which was pretty great.
The affogato though a blend of ice cream, chocolate sauce and coffe was my favorite.
The ice cream sandwich was a total let down.
It literally had ice cream sandwiched inside grilled bread.

The Chicken platter and brownie is a must have.

Its probably one of the finest coffee shop that i have been to with a perfect setting.The decor & ambience is totally fantabulous and it's worth visiting..The shop has been conceptualised and themed on Satyajit Roys masterpieces..
So if u r a Feluda fan its a must visit for u..

Now coming to the food..we took Darjeeling Tea- Rohini variant and my friend took the Ginger honey tea..Both of them tasted just superb...we also took a chicken platter which was gud but nothing extraordinary..we ended the evening with a chocolate milkshake which also tasted pretty nice

Overall a great place to visit with ur gf or even with your group of friends or family for an evening hangout also by being within a cheap budget...

P.S -  There is a carrom board which u must give a try..to relive ur college memories back

The place is very small. Again we have a outdoor seating for people with smoking habit. we had to seat outdoor as it was full house.
Ambience was good and the crowd was good. Service was fine. As it was full house order took abit longer. Nice place to hangout with friends for coffee or tea. 
As we came from another cafe we only ordered
◎ Chicken platter

It was cooked well and tasty. I would love to visit again soon. Overall good place and good food.

They were nothing over the top stuff.. i have had better.. a must visit for any intellectual non foodie though..

So after looking at the long waiting time at The Blue Mug, we decided to come here and spend a quality time. Initially, I was adamant by looking the place from outside since it lacks attraction. But, once I went inside my mind turned. I was amazed by the Bong decor of the place that too in a modern style. Usually, I don't prefer coming to such places. But this was different. The place gives a positive vibe. It's a great place for an adda or a coffee date. However, ordering here is a bit different. You need to walk to the Handler and give your order and take the table No. Service here is a bit downside and we had to wait quite a long time for our orders to come. 

There is not much to order, so people mostly come here for snacks and drinks. We ordered Hot Chocolate & Watermelon Fizz. Hot Chocolate was great but had a bit of Cinnamon in it (which I completely hate) but otherwise it was tempting. Watermelon Fizz had a good taste and was refreshing. 

Another downside I had to face was the annoying crowd and their shouting voices. It is not a peaceful place to be. It is a place where everyone keeps talking and you are forced to listen to the chaotic sounds. 
Overall is a one time visit and must try place for a new experience.

This is the worst cafe I have ever been to. Staff is rude and non-courteous and the food never arrived. We visited this evening with a kid. There was no one to attend to us and we had to look for our own table. The menu and decor appeared interesting and when we asked someone to take our order, we were very rudely asked, "What do you want?" followed by "You have to come up here and order." I have never seen any restaurant/cafe doing this. Everyone has a minimum sense of courtesy but not Abar Baithak.
Even then we proceeded to order, and were kept waiting. The excuse for the delay was that the concerned person did not have a pen! 
When he finally got hold of one, we were told that Pizza would be served late. It seemed like they were too reluctant to serve. So, we left without having anything. I am, of course, never going back and would heavily report this incident in social media.

Food - N/A, coz it never arrived.
Staff - Zero star, they don't deserve to be employed.
Decor and Menu - Interesting

I would suggest you to avoid this place.

This has to be my favorite cafe in Jodhpur Park so far. It's the ideal place for an 'adda' because of its very Bengali ambience with their traditional choice of books and music. It also has an indoor games corner and lovely handicrafts such as cups and lanterns up for sale.

The service is rather slow, and it's usually crowded so it's common that you'll end up sharing tables. But it's not much of a problem.

Coming to the food, I love the desserts. My favorite is their orange peel chocolate cake. The brownie with hot chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream was yum too. I didn't like their espresso much, but they have a rather nice range of tea choices on the menu. My friend had ordered chicken sausages wrapped in tortillas, and it was yum.

I'm definitely going back for more!

This one is one of the best cafes in Kolkata undoubtedly. They have a separate smoking zone,which is almost always full and you might have to wait a little should you choose to have a fag. The interiors are a visual treat for all feluda fans.

Ok so directly coming to the food i ordered a chicken wrap,fish fry, "meat platter " & a "non veg" bowl. The chicken wrap was good, the meat platter 😅had sausages and salamis and 1 egg it was so weird.and the "non veg "bowl had chicken nuggets and French fries. It was so absurd, i didn't understand why a non veg bowl is basically chicken nuggets. The service is bad although one waiter was very well helpful. We entered and the table was extremely dirty and any decent place would first clean the table but here we had to call them ourselves twice just to clean the table and one persons attitude was all "you just came in, decide what you wanna eat and we'll clean the table in sometime " , who does that. Anyway,😅the fish fry and turkey sandwich was tasty but overall i didnt like it very much

The name itself intrigues any bengali to check this place out. Reviving the old concept of adda and baithak and merging it with a restaurant is a lovely contemporary idea. The set up is unique, they have worked on their decor to suit the name. Beautiful glass windows to detailed themed menu cards will give you an essence of the bygone Bengali traditions and culture. The food menu on the other hand compliments and contrasts all of this. You can munch on salads, sandwiches and even english breakfast. We need more of such assimilations in Kolkata. However the food didnt impress me as much as the decor. The English breakfast was okay, the bacon was a little raw. I would suggest everyone to pay a visit here once.

This place is tucked just behind the EEDF Hospital in Jadavpur. As it was my first visit, the eye catcher was
"Bangaliyana" in their decoration. As their ground floor was full, we decided to take seats on the 1st floor. The place was full of stories and illustrations of 'Felu Mittir' mostly. A cozy place to bring back a lazy afternoon of Bangalis.
As we ordered A 'Cafe Mocha', 'Iced Lemon Tea', 'Ginger Honey Tea' and an 'Americano', stuffs were pretty good. Though they took much time to serve the 'Iced Lemon Tea'. Price was really affordable and quantity of food was as fine as it should be.
With the charm of adda, it would always be a place to enjoy your friends' times.

Visited this cafe twice. Once in February with a group of friends and second time on Poila Baisakh with one of my friend.

This cafe is tucked behind the lanes of EEDF hospital..On my first visit, we had to wait for around half an hour since it was a sunday evening and we were around 6 people so had to wait for our turn.. We took the stairs and managed ourselves on the couch on the first foor where it was extremely uneasy to sit as one needs to fold their legs while sitting...Finally when a group beside left, we took their place and made ourselves comfortable at the spacious dining table.

 We had ordered Raspberry Iced Tea, Expresso coffees, one Thin crust Barbequed chicken sausages and onion pizza and two plates of fish fingers. The coffee didnt taste good although the iced tea I loved. The pizza was not upto the standard at all, we regretted ordering it. Fish fingers were edible. Service was extraordinarily poor as the cafe was twith customers whereas attendants were hardly two...Kindly recruit more people. Heights was when later getting home I casually checked the bill and found they had charged us for 5 Cappucinos and not 5 Expressos so straightaway an addition of 15*5=75 bucks more to the bill..Yes it was our fault we should have checked then and there rather than getting busy in dutching the total amount among 6 of us friends...but yes Highly Unprofessional Service I must say...

Did not wish to visit second time at all, but it was Poila Baisakh and we could not manage a seat at The Blue Mug Cafe thus half-heartedly paid a visit here...a table for two was thankfully awaiting us..I had Boston Iced Tea and a Chocolate Egg since it was Easter around and thus they made one...Both tasted fine..Enjoyed..My friend had Lemon Iced Tea which as per lacked lemon essence...She also had a Mango Mousse which she savoured to the core..Happy that my second visit did not go that wrong..

Overall spacious cafe with two floors with indoor games at the entrance..good number of books stacked at the rack.. food and service can be better..

The food is simple yet delicious. Every shake on the menu is worth their prices. Chicken platter is a must try. Great place for evening chitchats, a game of carom or date with Satyajit Ray and his novels. If a true bong at heart then this place needs a definite visit.

This cafe has the most comfortable and beautiful ambience. And their food is nice as well. Their all meat tortilla, chicken platter and mojitos are pretty good. They have a new menu which is more of a meal than just light food, so that is a plus. And they have a nice bunch of different kinds of desserts. 

Apart from the food, the atmosphere they have developed is really nice. Its great for hanging out and having a good conversation. They have a good collection of books which are on sale, along with some knick knacks such as funky mugs and purses. For display they have some really cool film posters and paintings and the best part is their maganlal meghraj room. Plus they have a melochord which is put on display and that is a musical instrument which is not made any more. 

So overall the cafe is worth a visit, definitely.

The decor and the theme is extremely good. Any bengali who has read Feluda should visit this place and those who haven't should also visit this place. The way every bit of this cafe is related to Feluda makes you love this place even more. The food is good. The service is good. Would surely visit this place again whenever possible.

I visited the place with my friends and there are few places where you can actually sit for an 'adda'. We ordered wild mushroom and barbeque chicken pizzas. The pizzas are thin crust unlike the big pizza joints. Next we ordered veg bowls. To end it off, we had Opera cake and brownie with hot chocolate sauce and ice-cream. The food is good and service is great.The place lives up to its name. Good work!

This is a lovely place to try out. The ambiance and the decorations of this place gives a good feel. Coming to the food, firstly they provide a very good menu, all the dishes on the menu are lip smacking. Today we(me n my best friend) tried meat platter, fish n chips, sparkling espresso, passion fruit. They served the dishes pretty quick and the food was delicious. A wonderful experience we had.

Just one word to describe this place ..." Bangaliyana"!!!

This place brings back a lot of childhood memories with the ambiance that it has created... A world of 90's addas with stories illustrations and imitations of storybook characters and tales splattered all over their inventory. The interior decor will take you back to a time, when lazy afternoons were spent listening to tales from grandparents.
The food however is a completely different story bringing in a fusion of continental and indian with just the right kind of bengali twist to it.

The salad could use a bit more dressing, while the processed meat could do with a little less oil. But apart from seasoning the guys at abar baithak are hitting all the right notes.

A Nice cafe to visit with friends or loved ones offering various kind of drinks (tea,coffee,mocktails) and some lip smacking foods. Ambiance will definitely win your heart if you are Bong By nature. The Cafe is Themed entirely on Feluda. Also offering full shelves of books for time pass if you visit alone. Location is the lane beside Leather Land opposite to south city. Then take the third right lane and walk about 5 minutes. Sandwiches and Meat Platters are highly recommended. Pizza crust is bit hard though. Coffee and Mocktails are nothing extra ordinary. Brownie is a good choice for dessert.

I have been one of the oldest customers of Abar Baithak.
And by old, I mean I stepped into this little cafe on the third day of its birth.
It was a beautiful cafe then, a perfect nook for me to read and write to my heart's content.
The staff was amiable, the owners an utter darling, I remember the numerous books I had devoured there with the company of their delicious masala tea.

However, as time has its way with all, it changed Abar Baithak too.
After their location was changed, the place changed as well. The crowds altered, so did the ambiance.

But the most surprisingly painful thing to witness was the change of behaviour of the staff. Initially friendly, it turned into a mocking fest from the older staff and later into plain rude from a couple of the newer ones.

Even if there was hardly any change of menu or food quality, the prices soared and even when you wished to pay for it, the place didn't feel like the cafe you knew and loved.

Abar Baithak will always be dear to heart. I would always love to visit the beautiful cafe again and again. But if the hospitality doesn't change for the better, it would be a sad thing to witness indeed.

Here's to wishing them the very best.

We've been quite complaining about how cafés and lounges have replaced the conventional places where the bongs previously used to gather for the so called "Adda". :'P
Well,I must say this is the perfect place with such nostalgic ambience which you might have been missing for all these years.
The books,the intricate portrayal of the room and props as shown in a famous Bengali detective movie are praiseworthy.
The chicken platter and the chicken wrap are what I'd like to say " a must-have" if you ever come to this place.
The desserts are pretty well too.
In a nutshell,Abar Baithak is a must-visit for all the bongs out there. The service and conduct of the persons there are also extremely good which adds to the soothing ambience of this place.

Located in amonst the greens of Jodhpur park a small cafe for a little tea time gossip inside a garage kind of thing , is this lovely cafe . The ambience and the decor takes me place to the time when my grand parents went out for any kind of adda with their group . I went with my school friends as I wanted to visit this oen for a long time however it did npt appeal so much to me . The food was just average with nothing special to offer , ordered 2 all meat platter and a chicken salad which was tossed and garnished terribly . However it appealed in some other ways like the intricate details that bring much zamindari feel to the cafe , like cigarette box ash trays , a half car seat which was too cute and the way menu cards were kept . Though in future would look forward to have some dishes based in bengal as the cafe has got Feluda in its central theme maybe like the famous pakoras or the various kinds of chop that come in the Bengal domain .

The place remains mostly crowded so I would advise that if you go there please do not loose your patience or carry your earphones with a "waiting to get a place" soundtrack. The various tea which they serve is what I found to be one of the nicest attractions in this place. You can go for the chicken sandwich as well if you are not a vegan. Worth a visit if going in a group.

The name Abar Baithak speaks somewhat itself, isn't it? People who are fascinated by Feluda, would definitely like to visit such place when comes in knowledge that there's a cafe themed up in Feluda. So did we. 🙌

The moment we walked in, we found, a tiny cram-full place which was decorated by wooden tables and chairs, but in such way where one can easily eavesdrop your conversations even if they don't like, they can improve on this by making the seating arrangements spacious and relaxing if they want, beside this, bookshelf containing many books, maximum for selling and few are for reading while sipping on coffee, a carom at one side which is good reason to hangout and spend time with friends, the counter where one needs to walk in, order and pay, be it water for thirsty throats or foods, an extended part as smoking zone and it has one more floor (First-floor) which is the best part of the cafe and has been decorated beautifully, there's the sitting poster of Maganlal Meghraj and so is the seating arrangements styled beside by wooden chairs-tables, overall pleasing interior with least exterior where nostalgia unfolds itself 🤓📚
We had opt here to munch on something in the evening, so we availed,
o Chicken platter : which includes two pieces of chicken sausages, chicken ham, chicken salami, poached egg and two pieces of cheese toast. Many items come in one platter, doesn't it sound good? Everything tested good except chicken hams, sadly I didn't like it.
o Chicken salami sandwiches : Tested average! It was served with potato chips and a sauce sachet.
o Cappuccino was average. 
No food presentation was made In any of the above listed foods! It was very minimal serving way. Where nostalgia plays in and around, we can expect more, something elegant, something good at least.

Now coming to service,
It was huge disappointment sadly. Couple of minutes have had been spent with nothing, no one came to offer their menu or a glass of water, a staff though was having a lazy walk in back and forth, he brought us the menu on asking. He served us two of the course meals and forgot to bring the coffee. I had to walk in to the counter and ask for the coffee and the annoying part was, we had to knock them not once instead couple of times. The way the steward had served the foods on the table was way more of putting them down in rush as if he was getting late to catch a train, couldn't found beautiful manner either way, quite unheeding. No one even bothered checking on us if the foods were okay, if we liked the service. However, apart of this, before we made our orders, we asked if we can sit upstairs, on that we were told that upstairs was filled, so we had no other alternative than agree! But after couple of minutes while having our foods we saw many people going upstairs, couples, groups and what could one feel by that moment? Why the staff lied to us? Why on earth didn't he led us go upstairs? Overall which makes the visit unhappy, unpleasant and decided not to visit again, this wasn't one or two things but so many things went wrong and made the experience a worse visit. Where hospitality is the business how could one be so neglect on providing good service, attentiveness, checking.

NOTE * : Service Tax and VATS are applicable here.

Overall satisfaction,
Foods 3.5/5
Ambience : 3.5/5
Service : 1.5/5
No recommendation, no further visit!

The ambience of this place can only be appreciated by us Bangalis, and for us, it is a ticket to memories and nostalgia. The name itself - Abar 'Baithak' - evokes images of dhuti punjabi clad men, sitting on carpets and sipping on first class Darjeeling Tea, and discussing the Bolshevik Revolution or Neo Nazi Filmmaking.

The place is done in the same style, with walls printed with Satyajit Ray drawings, cane couches and low tables, shelves full of Shirshendu and Sunil and Sanjib, menu card inspired by the Feluda series (with small excerpts from Feluda books) et al.

I tried the Coffee Yoghurt - more like Coffee Lassi -and let's take a moment to appreciate how unique and excellent it was! Simple genius - such an easy combination, and yet I have never thought about it. Husband tried the Thai Iced Tea - strong, milky, sweet and loaded with spices, but excellent nonetheless!

The Fish in Chilli Orange Sauce was another unique item - served with bread rolls and sauteed vegetables. Fish was fresh and fried just right, and the sauce was really different, for lack of a better adjective. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was ordinary, but no denying the quality of the food.

The only complaint I have about this place - and this could be because we went pretty early - is that the place was smelling a bit, there were a couple of flies and in general it looked a bit disorganized, like they were open but not completely ready for customers so early. However, that did not reduce the quality of our culinary experience much, and this will remain a recommended place.

Special mention: The Melochord used in the movie Double Feluda by Sandip Ray is in display here. And all Ray fans would know what an unusual musical instrument it is, so this should be an added attraction. ;)

I have probably been to Abar Baithak over 60 times. The first time, on a rainy evening, I was curious. My friend stays nearby, and I must have passed that place hundreds of times, but I never knew that it was so very popular, especially among the youth.

There were two Abar Baithaks. Or three. I never visited the first, wherever it was, somewhere off Mudiali (?). But apparently, they were a little over-ambitious there, learnt their lessons, and moved to this quiet lane in Jodhpur Park. This second easy-going baithakkhana decor-ed Abar Baithak made its name, becoming hugely popular. A little prompting by Tollywood semi-celebrities also did no harm. And now they've moved to a little more convenient location in Jodhpur Park, where parking is a little more available.

Enter Jodhpur Park taking the minibus-stand road (the first left after the Jadavpur Thana, not the post-office road), and go straight west (keeping left at the Y-triangle opposite the JP pujo park). It is on that road itself, on the right, a couple of buildings before where the road turns right at the end.

This latest Abar Baithak (location: 9/10) is a glitzy avatar of Topshe (of Feluda) fame, with a Maganlal Mezzanine also thrown in. A lot of money (and thought) has gone in. A little more glitzy and glam than what Ray perceived, perhaps. But since the crowd is semi-celebrities and the nouveau-riche youth, possibly they like it. Though spacious, it emanates a cramped feeling. The stairs to the mezzanine and the "dress circle" are a little daunting for the unwary, and it's good that Abar Baithak does not have a licence to sell liquor, yet. The warm openness of their previous baithakkhana is definitely missing, even though most of the elements are there, like the ubiquitous open carrom-board. I will conservatively rate the current decor and ambiance a 4/10, down from the 7/10 of their earlier avatar.

A word about the "games" provided. It would real good fun for a boisterous group to come here and play ludo or carrom or scrabble between the bites. Or two serious but quiet shatranj ke khiladi. on a lazy rainy Saturday afternoon. But if you have come alone or in a small group for a bite, a quiet conversation, or a few laughs, it could be very disconcerting to have a group of boisterous youngsters playing carrom a handshake away from you, every evening you come, or nearly every time you come. And surprisingly, even though there was an outdoor smoking area, the carrom board has been kept inside the airconditioned zone. Great for the players, not so great for all diners.

The menu looks eclectic (the menu pictures here are for AB #2, not AB #3, their latest). The teas are very very good (9-10/10); try the ginger honey. So are a couple of the coffees (9-10/10), and the chocolates (10/10). The shakes and mocktails are innovative (7/10). The desserts taste homemade (6/10), because they mostly are. The sandwiches and the fries are ordinary (5/10). The "baked" omelettes, unless you are fully into insipid fad-full fat-free health foods, are a waste of good ingredients (3/10). The platters are quite good (8/10) and will leave you wanting more. Avoid the pizzas and the wraps to places more specialized in these categories (2/10). Overall, I would rate the eclectic selection a 7.5/10 considering the prices too.

Now, the service (7/10). Be prepared for somewhat long waits, as this place is always quite crowded. However, Shanti-da here makes up much for it (10/10) with his smile, service, and his very ready suggestions and wit.

If you are alone, you can browse the interestingly re-designed menu, the books and the knickknackery on offer, or play a game of Solitaire or Monopoly. For a first-time (or even a fifth-time) visit, you will be impressed with Abar Baithak. More than that, the ennui of finding nothing new to sample may hit you, as it has me. I have been there only once in the last 9 months; and I can't honestly say I'm missing it (thanks, in part, to the sprouting of similar baithankkhanas (read, cafés) elsewhere.

But do visit it once, even if to disagree with my assessment, or upgrade me in case they have re-blossomed.

Pics are: All Meat Platter; ginger-honey tea; a glimpse of the updated menu (removed); a view of the current incarnation (Abar Baithak #3) (removed)

It's a cafe with a theme and that too of one of my favorite Bengali personality,Mr Satyajit Ray's.The Ray's  movie memorabilia distributed all around makes a nostalgic feeling.There is an upstair arrangement as well as outdoor arrangement.The staff behavior attitude is friendly and quite satisfactory.I totally loved the cold coffee Affogato and the chocolate muffin is so soft it melts in your mouth.The pricing is also at par.Above all a satisfactory evening spent there and a nice Adda joint to be recommended to friends and family.

Located in Jodhpur park.. a place for bangali adda as described is apt.. as after entering we found people giving adda and having some bites... Concept inside the cafe is to be praised starting from the way your table gets numbered and placing your orders.. loved the concept.. but i felt the area in the upstairs had a bit less space.. Had ordered an all meat platter and Bruschetta gambaretti.. a unique dish of its own kind.. it has prawns in it the staff claimed it to be good and new one in their menus.. loved it.. all meat platter was good with variety of flesh made in a beautiful way in it... Loved both of them.. along with it ordered chocolate float and tiramisu cold coffee.. both were lovely to hv and quenched our thirst.. i hope so it plans to expand itself and make various outlets.. as many don't get a chance to visit it.. well surely visit it again

Very good ambience. Food quality also very good. The concept of having chess/ludo/carrom available for visitors makes the place ideal for a visit with friends.

However, they did mix up my chicken pizza for a pork pizza which was a let down.

This was my second visit to the cafe (first time after renovation) and the best part, on both occasion, has been the ambience. The decor (the Satyajit Roy theme), the carrom board, and the books will definitely provide you with a different experience when compared to other 'adda' spots in Kolkata. It's certainly one of the better places to hang out with your friends.  But then, the quality of the food was not up to the mark. We ordered Chicken Salami Sandwich, Chicken Tortilla Wrap, and Barbequed Chicken & Sausages Pizza. The pizza was pretty disappointing and it had a weird smell, while the other two were rather okay. Hence, Abar Baithak, I feel, is all about ambience. Yet, next time I would expect better quality food.

This cafe was in my list for a long time. Finally last Saturday I made it there and yes I'm impressed by its decor.
As a বাঙালি I'm very happy to see a Bengali themed cafe which so well decorated and well maintained. 
I grew up reading Satayajit Ray. There's a touch of Manik da in every​thing from menu card to cushions.
There's a carrom board also and lots of books. 

Ordered chicken salami sandwich which was nice.
Service would have been a little more prompt.

Themed cafe, having feluda touch in the decoration, located near Jodhpur park.. Abar baithak the name signifies the that this place is very near to any Bengal's heart as bengalis are so called "Adda Priyo". We visited the place at 9 a.m sharp. Very calm and soothing ambience.. one middle aged woman reading books while having her tea. I am a book warm, i was soooo happy to see the book self and felt amazed after seeing their collection on books. You can  read books even you can also buy books from there. We ordered french kiss, garlic honey tea, french fries, garlic bread and chicken cheese omlet.. staffs are good and friendly. Quality wise good, but some food are over priced... Otherwise good experience I had..

Visited this place few days back with a friend of mine. Despite of many empty tables, the manager/ waiter was confused where to let us sit ! ( It was really annoying) Nonetheless, we settled on the upper portion of the restaurant. We ordered for mushroom and corn sandwiches and 2 coffees. The sandwich was good. A good ambience & beautiful decor adores the place though the location is not very strategic. A pleasant experience overall.

but this time was a different story altogether... i went there with my friends yesterday.. excellent ambience and food..we ordered 4 cold coffees, 1 iced tea, 2 plates of chicken tortilla wraps, 1 chicken salad, 1 chicken platter... the total cost was around rs 1400 ( we dint check the bill, i think there was some problem with this, mgt committee - if you are reading this kindly revert back) 
would visit again! <3

A Café which runs on Feluda nostalgia, it is a better themed eat out than Tolly tales. With little accessories and decor adding up to the charm of this Café, it isn't very far from South city mall. The lane opposite the mall (Leder Land lane) should be able to take you to this Café. It might be hot outside but this place doesn't let you feel that heat. Interesting and quirky decor is not it's only USP. The food served here is finger licking good. The Oreo cookies are amazing and so is Grilled chicken and for vegetarians - sauted vegetables. I had the red velvet cake yesterday and that was equally amazing. Carrom boards, car seat chairs, old telephones, don't miss this place

Very nostalgic cafeteria which brings back to your mind all your childhood FELUDA scenes and stories. The ambience is absolutely fantastic with the 'maganlal's gaddi' and all the feluda graphitis... One of the best places where a friend's gathering or any get-togethers can be done over a cup of coffee or even lassi and sandwiches or non-veg platter... Prices are quite affordable... and the food tastes absolutely amazing... spclly the kebab sandwiches and the brownies with ice cream tastes heavenly A must try for everyone😍😍

Very bad service ufortunately ruined the entire dining experience for us. Though food was good, the behaviour of the cafe manager was pathetic, and we chose to leave after being made to feel so unwelcome here. Would not go back here probably.

Please understand that hospitality is also part of the package, and only concentrating on "theme" without having well behaved and polite staff will not win hearts among customers.

Abar baithak is located in one of the bylanes of Jodhpur Park. I used to go there quite frequently before Blue Mug opened. ;)
The cafe is nothing extraordinary. Food is very basic..nothing great. Staffs are cordial though. Ambience is good. Zomato mentions that the price for two people is around 550. However, it's not so. It will cost you atleast 700 for two people if you want to have a full meal.

Worst place to visit. The gesture and the behaviour was pathetic. We entered into the cafe and was looking here and there for a seat but the waiter who was at the counter they even bothered to ask us if they can managed for a seat. Even we asked them thrice if there is any seat available for two persons.After waited inside the cafe for more than half n hour no one asked us or welcomed us.Then we found that the waiter in the cafe was providing a seat for two to other customers who are the permanent customers of that cafe.

Went to this place yesterday, had a mixed feeling about this place.. heard so much good about it that I wanted it to be better than what I experienced.. this can be coz of too much crowd, when we went there, it was too crowded. It was sort of congested, we couldn't sit comfortably, it was hard to talk amongst us.. the service was slow, may be for the crowd,still the food & drinks were pretty good .. I so wanted to give them more rating, but I guess I have to revisit for that.. For now - Not Happy

Abar baithak is synonymous to 'Adda zone'. The target visitors are primarily the youths. Situated at a posh area in South Kolkata, Abar Baithak would be a mouth watering place for ones who want a cool hangout with friends.

The place has a very cool ambience. Once you step in you will find a carrom board. Not that you won't find these boards in any other places, but surely you will miss the atmosphere you have here around the board. This is surely one of the USPs of Abar Baithak.

Another observable thing once you are within the place are the theme of the walls. The painted walls add value to the place. You have an extra option to read books from the shelves. 

Now coming to the most important point, the food. I would not give a huge recommendation for the dishes. We ordered a non veg bowl and fish finger. Food is okay, but not extraordinary.

Staffs are descent. The place is generally filled with Adda lovers, so if you want a table, make sure to reach early during the evening before the sun sets.

I would easily give a three star rating genuinely but would like to add another half for the cool relaxing attitude of the place.

A quaint little cafe with a twist of "Bangalir Adda" feel. The antique decors, the beautiful chandelier, outdoor seating arrangement and the dominant theme of one of my favourite detectives in Bengali literature Feluda. There is a wide range of options in indoor games, carrom, Ludo, scrabble etc. You can spend hours with your friends over a cup of coffee...
With a charm of jamidari house it doesn't fail to revive the charm of old Bengal. Even the menu card was made on the theme of Feluda
We ordered the chicken platter, caramel coffee and cappuccino...
The chicken platter was nice only complaint was the quantity could have been more.
The caramel coffee was really nice with a subtle valour if caramel throughout and the cappuccino was creamy. This place is a must visit for anyone who loves Feluda, Chaa, coffee and Adda.

Located near edf (nursing home). It's very well decorated with a homely atmosphere..; the main attraction of the place is similarities with the Feluda series. All the interior decoration along with the menu card are done based on Feluda series. 
One of the best cafe in town. We ordered chicken platter which was full of chicken sausage with cheese,salami,egg poch,mayonnaise..it was yummy. Then we ordered chicken salami sandwich and one cold chocolate.
All of them were superb in taste. 
Cost is reasonable. Liked it totally.

This amazing themed cafe with a Bengali feel is tucked in a bylane of jodhpur park , walking straight through the lane beside edf , you can easily locate it ! The ambience is perfect to take you down the memory lane spending your days idolising feluda ! Done right with the decor , this cafe offers you a variety of entertainment activities ranging from different Board games or you can you also enjoy a nice alone time indulging yourself in their collection of story books. Now coming to the food , we ordered one watermelon iced tea , one cold coffee and one chicken salami sandwich. The watermelon iced tea was very refreshing , cold coffee was perfectly done , but the chicken salami sandwich could have been better. The service is a bit slow though and it's always full , so make sure you have ample time before deciding to go there . Overall a nice experience. :)

Feluda themed star cafe located in the jodhpur park bylanes. Divided into sections and euphemism associated with the great sleuth , we sat in what was the notorious mahanlal s chamber intact with the knife throwers target. The ground floor has books and games strewn. The menu is very akin to a cafe with light bites and beverages. Ordered the all meat platter, a grilled chicken, prawn ajlio, green apple mojito and chocolate meghraj. All were standard and great eats. The meat platter was exciting and the grilled chicken came on a bed of mashed potatoes with veggies. The light slaw salad with vinagrette with the prawns were an explosion on the taste buds and the mojito really refreshing.
The feluda storied cushions are great, the only negative yes, too many taxes adding to ur bill. Tequila filled chocolates also filled my bag at the payment desk which also has all baked and chocolate items stacked. There is also an open smoking area. A great concept. Kudos.

An awesome Feluda themed cafe with lip smacking food in Jodhpur Park.

FOOD:  The food offered here is mouth watering. Ordered an all meat platter,  grilled chickenall, gussi di ajilo and a chocolate meghraj n green apple mojito. The meat platter consisted of sausage, bacon, ham, salami, poached egg and tasted heavenly. The grilled chicken with mashed potato was also finger licking good. The gussi di ajilo was prawn covered in garlic and was a bit spicy but served well to excite the palate. The green apple mojito was refreshing while the chocolate meghraj was loaded with chocolate and was a glass of pure sin. But the taste and variety of the food left us wanting for more. The quantity could have been a little more though.

AMBIANCE: The ambiance is simply awesome. The cafe has both inside and outside seating arrangements. The inside is double decked. The place is filled with Satyajit Ray's books and other bengali books. The cushions are named with each of Feluda's adventures. Even the menu is like a Feluda book with actual titbit facts about Feluda. The walls r decorated with characters from Feluda series. The upper part has a secluded portion which looks exactly like the room of infamous Maganlal Meghraj. Scores 12 out of 10 in ambiance.

SERVICE: The staffs are polite and cooperative. Once the order is placed, it does not take much time to serve. Both cash and card are accepted. Tax is applicable over the price, hence the pocket pinch is pretty big. 

OVERALL: A must visit for couples. One can read poems to their better half while smacking their lips to the drinks on offer.  And even a gang of friends would enjoy the ambiance. If one has ever heard the name of Feluda, this cafe is the place one should definitely visit once at least. The awesome food is just added benefit. 

P.S: Before leaving, we bought a couple of Tequila Chocolates to eat on the way. They were awesome as well!! ;)

Apart from the khus sarbat and chicken platter we enjoyed the fresh brew of tea. Even ended up reading poems to each other.

P. S:It opens around 11am,so reach there before 4pm to scurry the queue blues. With

Abar Baithak as the name suggests is a nice place to hang out with friends. The decor, the ambience and the strategically placed Feluda themed items are bound to garner attention of anyone who have grown up reading and admiring this sleuth residing at 21Rajani Sen Road. It was more of nostalgia and indulging in the Feluda experience. All the mocktails were absolutely worth the money. This cafe a new addition to the Kolkata culinary tradition will surely go a long way with its own brand value. There is something feel good factor about this cafe that will prompt me to visit it once more.

Bengal's favourite sleuth and Satyajit Ray's immortal creation 'Feluda' now has a place dedicated to him. Once you step inside, you will lured with visual opulence, nicely crafted with aesthetic taste and passion for art. 
I would like to call this place a cozy adda zone with the seating arrangement reflecting the casual boithak of bengalis. 
We had this unique 'Choco Cigar Tea' . The taste is too good. The chicken seek kebab sandwich was yummy and tummy filling too. 
The restaurant will also woo the 'reader' in you with handpicked books arranged in the shelves.

Situated at Jodhpur park, 7mins walking from main road. It is a very beautiful restaurant with great ambiance. Service is good. They have separate smoking area, carom, books and pretty decorated seating accomodation. We tried grilled fish in lemon butter sauce. Two pieces of grilled bhetki with veggies were served. Taste is light and delicious.
Then we had hot chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. It was very yummy. A little costly but great cafe.

"Abar Baithak", Jodhpur Park is the second outlet after "Baithak" which was located near the fictional address of Feluda, that is 21B rajani sen road. As suggested by its name, it is the perfect place for hanging out with friends. The best part of this cafe is the culmination of the age old concept of adda and the modern concept of hanging out with friends. The ambience is unique with carrom and other board games to while away your time. The interior is beautifully decorated with scenes and excerpts from the very nostalgic stories of the iconic Bengali detective Feluda by Satyajit Ray. From the very villanous Maganlal Meghraj to the Nepal Curio shop in Joto Kando Kathmandute, get transported yet again to the world of Feluda by just walking into this cafe The sitting arrangements are good with an outside area separated for smoking, and a two floored air conditioned space with an excellent chandelier in the ceiling. We sat inside in a room with the door plate stating the name of Maganlal Meghraj in the first floor. Just as in the books where Maganlal Meghraj was portrayed to be sitting like a businessman with a desk and cushions: we were offered a similar sitting arrangement. 
The menu card also deserves a mention where we see feluda with his two assistants, Topse and Lal Mohan babu. We were also given a square wooden chunck with 27 written on it, which was our table number. 
Now, coming to the food, we had ordered Black Currant Fizz and Crunchy Tiramisu. The latter lived upto its expectations while the former was okay. 
We also ordered Chicken platter( chicken sausages, chicken salami, poached eggs and cheese toast), Chicken open sandwich, Chicken Tortilla wraps, Bruschetta Gambrietta and Barbequed chicken sausages and onion pizza. All of the items tastes good but the quantity is a bit less for certain dishes. Overall if you want to spent a nice evening, this place welcomes you with books, literature, games and good food. Also if you are a fan of Feluda, then this feluda themed cafe is bound to win your heart.

Had been to the café for breakfast. Loved the whole ambience and decoration of the place. The menu was really creatively designed and so was the whole place filled with all of the bangaliana to mention. The watermelon ice tea and the lemon ice tea were a real refreshment during summer. And the chicken platter and chicken open sandwich was finger licking good. An awesome café to hangout with your friends to munch on some real tasty food without​ having a hole in your pocket.

I ordered a pork pepperoni and meatballs pizza and all meat platter which consisted of sausages, egg, chilli cheese toast, pork ham, chicken salami, and bacon.

The pizza's mozzarella cheese was so tasty and you would bite a long strip will come out. The main thing about the pizza is the mozzarella.
The all meat platters chicken sausages I think had mayo inside but whatever it is you will reach heaven in no time. It is so 😋 tasty, I loved it.
The ham and bacon was also nice but I have this ham somewhere else as well but it was nice.

Will definitely visit this place again.

This coffee shop is a gem of a place for Feluda and Satyajit Ray fans . Located in one of the lanes of Jodhpur park Abar Baithak is a great place for adda with friends . Ambience is great gives the typical bengali feeling with wooden stairs and floors. Food is pretty amazing . We orderd 
1- Lemon Ice Tea (very refreshing)
2 - Watermelon Ice Tea (  a bit sweet but a perfect summer drink )
3 -  Chicken platter ( chicken ham , bacon , sausage , egg poach and 2 cheese toast which was quite fulfilling for one person ) 
4 - Chicken open sandwich (  this was actually garlic toast stuffed with chicken veggie salad and this was the best ) .  
 Quite affordable and really nice place to hangout . Would definitely recommend . The menu card of this place was really innovative and eye catching .

I made a call and order my favourite chicken platters. Main thing is that they served me in a plate. But then i asked them to give it in a parcel box. I am overwhelmed. Great service. Great food. Great taste. Thank you guys. Thank You so much.

The desserts were yumm! The all meat platter was also great. The ambience was good and the place was too beautiful ( especially for a typical Bengali ) Just that, the thin crust pizza was not very satisfying.

Abar baithak as the name suggests is the perfect place for addas and daily hangout sessions. The nostalgic bong interiors and convenient location makes the place more attractive. The food is delicious mainly the Meat platter. The service was good as well.

Overhyped 🙄 

Well well ... One of the most overhyped and overpriced coffee shops.. Ordered a pastry which tasted exactly like my toothpaste 🙈. Meat platter was one of the worst i have tasted. Though the owners are very courteous that doesn't compensate the food they serve.

Food -👍🏻
Service- 👍🏻👍🏻
Price - 👍🏻

Will i visit again? No..

A coffee shop that rides on Calcutta's love for Feluda, the iconic detective created by Satyajit Ray. The menu, the food and the ambience is replete with photos and references from the books.
The food is standard coffee shop fare made competently but the experience is a killer!

(The name is Abar Baithak - Baithak Again - because they moved here from an earlier location which was near the fictional address of Feluda.)

C'mon! Everyone is entitled to a bad day. A day when nothing goes right and try as you might,    everything seems to be like it had just come under the impact of a tornado. Saturday probably was one such day for Abar Baithak and that was the day we decided to pay a visit to this place. 
Ever seen a marriage hall reserved for the bridegroom's kins to stay? The bridegroom's party is always larger than estimated, making any place reserved by the bride's parents look cramped. Abar Baithak looked, to us, just like such a place. 
There were people outside the house, young ones mainly, as if they had gathered outside for a smoke, away from the prying eyes of elders  ensconced inside the house. At an arm's length away from the band of these youngsters and sitting on chairs lining the walkway, were a few people, just like the workmen of decorators or lighting contractor who happen to sit down for an unscheduled break from decoration work, their feet stretched out and bodies in 270 degree formation. 
Inside the house, the scene was even more like the bridegroom party's shelter, with chairs arranged at almost all nooks and corners and along passageway with people sitting in them and chattering away to glory. In the midst of all this din, an elderly gentleman and a not so young lady sat, hunched over a game of chess, their lips silent but hands doing all the movement and expressing their intents. 
A flight of steps lead up to the mezzanine floor where there are chairs and more chairs and a dastarkhwan style seating at the far end of the room, just below a wall to wall painting of the famous villain of Bengali cinema, Maganlal meghraj. Abar Baithak is not about peaceful dining, certainly not about whispered conversations in muted lights. It is bright, it is crowded with chairs, it is about uninhibited conversations without a care for whether someone in the next seat can hear all the conversation.  
After having taken your seat and chosen your pick from the menu, you have to go up to the server corner to log in your order and come back to the table to begin your wait! If you happen to reach before 8 pm, you have additional choice of continental food. Post 8 pm, the place simply serves finger food and coffee/tea. 
As for rating the food at Abar Baithak, I would only like to sum it up by saying that other than the good old Darjeeling, it's not worth the wait! The  salami ham sandwich that we ordered was anorexic and too tangy for my taste. We nearly fell asleep waiting for the baked omlette to come and when it did come, it tasted flat devoid as it was of salt. We asked the server for some salt and pepper to spice up the omlette but to our misfortune, were offered empty salt - pepper shaker. 
While at Abar Baithak, it helps to always keep an eye on your ordered food and drinks 
because there is a possibility of same being taken away by the server the moment your attention wavers. It happened to us at Abar Baithak. And when we asked the server as to why he had removed our half empty glass of lime juice, he offered neither an explanation nor any remorse but simply went away, only to return a little later with another glass of lime juice! His expression, as he put the juice down was-" here's your drink. Have it and don't make any further fuss! " We followed his unstated advice and quickly gobbled our food, went down to the counter to pay our bill and left. 
Footnote-They do not serve water on the table and have done away with the concept of drinking from the glass. If you are thirsty, you need to get up, pick your bottle from the servers corner and drink straight from the bottle!

Been there on the first day of Bengali new year. An awesome place to hangout with your buddies, the theme of the cafe is very happening. The platter that we ordered was exceptionally good, all well cooked and stuff. The drinks are quite upto the mark and the best thing about the cafe is that the people working there have a great sense of hospitality. Been treated really well by the people their, loved the cafe. Some really good vibes can be felt. I would definitely recommend someone to go to this place if he wants to see some good Bengali culture over a cup of coffee.

Had visited the place several times before renovation. But now this surely deserves a review! Feluda themed decor is just outstanding and will surely give you nostalgia. The ambience is perfect for a proper adda. Let's come to the food. We had ordered one chicken platter, one chicken tortilla wrap and one black currant fizz. Platter is more than sufficient for one person I guess. We're filling so full! 😛😛
Definitely I'll visit again. ❤️

A great place for adda and hangout, Abar Baithak - The Coffee Shop is gem of a place for Feluda fans and lovers of Bengali books/literature.
Ambiance is pretty nice, with shelves stacked with books, Feluda art on balcony and cushions, arrangement of indoor game etc.
We ordered the lassi, tiramisu cold coffee, cappuccino, fish fingers, and chicken salami sandwich.
The sandwiches were extremely tasty;  fish fingers were made with fresh fish. Coffee was flavoursome but with a strong bitter taste.
Quality and taste of food are no doubt beyond average, and available at pocket friendly prices.
Definitely worth a visit!

 Coming to the food, we had ordered cold coffee with ice cream and chicken platter. 4 out of 5 in food. Presentation can improve though. Overall it's a good hangout place with a reasonable value for money. Will visit again!

The pristinely convenient location, lovely Satyajit Ray-esque interiors and the lovely staff behavior with  reasonably priced dishes are a huge turn on!

Suppose you're meeting your school buddies after 13 long years and all you are looking for is a comfortable cafe to accommodate the group of 11 people and let you all do the pagalpanti...then this place is your pick! We were a bit lost in Jodhpur Park to find out this cafe, but then spotted it. And it offered the best we could think of at that moment - a plush sitting area with cushions and bolsters!! We girls were so happy to see the arrangements, we loved the place at once! They let us chat on top of our voices (we were afraid someone would scold us), make live videos and just allowed us to have fun! We ordered cold coffee, mojito and flavored iced tea and fish fingers. All of them tasted fresh and nice. I personally liked the fish fingers with mustard dip...so bong!! The prices were reasonable..didn't burn a hole in our pockets. Overall very good experience! If you're looking for a comfortable place to spend good time with your gang in south Kolkata, this is your go-to place! Loved the ambience, loved the sitting arrangements and loved their hospitality!

Abar Baithak is like my 2nd home. When I feel happy, I go there. When I feel low, I go there. In summers, the cold chocolate takes care of me. In the winter, the spicy hot chocolate is my bff! Honestly, I've worked my way through the entire menu by now! And I can vouch for the following: The ham sandwich (honestly, how can a sandwich be THIS good?), the mixed platter (obviously), the chicken salad. I am not a tea person, but the mint tea there is to die for! Honestly, this is not a cafe for me anymore. This is the place where I, the proud Bangali, can sit for hours and contemplate life decisions!

It was one of my friends earnest request that I should visit this place. It is a small little place situated in Jodhpur Park, however when I went inside I was amazed. The decor was nicely done. There were books and also it was based on the Feluda theme and I being an avid fan was more than happy seeing that. I liked the sofa and the "baithak" feel that was given to the upstairs room. We wanted a snack and that is why we ordered for a Cappuccino and Affogato and the brownie with hot chocolate and ice cream. All of the desserts were nicely made and were given on time. I loved the homely feel that the place provided. We chatted there for hours and so it is an excellent place for just a hangout. The waiters were very courteous and the prices were affordable. Would really recommend it to all college going folks and also for reunions.

The green apple mojito is also very refreshing.  The pork pizza is great here.  For meat lovers one nust try out the all meat platter.  Its very fulfilling and yum. 
Great place for some friends adda and hang out.

A paradise for bengali 'addabaaz'!
We reached the place after 9pm and wondered if we would get all the menu options. Fortunately, the ground floor was bustling with mainly college goers and young crowd. One of guests informed us that the staff remains available till 11. Happily, we ordered a chicken platter, a thin crust chicken barbecue pizza, and coffee.
The food is nice and the ambience is nicer.
Will definitely recommend this 'bong' hangout place to all.

This used to be a very small cafe near jodhpur park with sharlock theme. And to be honest this was in wish list from 2 years. But till i manage my time to go there, they opened their cafe in a new palace with lot more space and this time Abar Baithak is with our own feluda.

Location:
_______________
it's near jodhpur park. Trust your Google map, you will be spot on.

Decoration:
________________

Ok the thing is we went there on Sunday Evening, so it was a bit crowded. But one this is for sure- from their decoration to menu card it's simply superb. On small ground floor- outside they have the smoke zone, they u just enter you will find a collection of books like a micro library - book lovers will surely going to love this one. Wait wait now what about like us who doesn't get attracted to books? Hold on- on the other hand you will have a carrom board to play.
Now you will go upstairs- on entering the small upper floor the arrangement of sitting on bed with pasbalish like mohonlal that just blow my mind. You have the table chair sitting arrangement also.
As i mentioned- the crowd this cafe pulls, you will find the place a bit congested though.

Now coming to the main segment: Food
_________________________________________

© All meat platter - this was just superb. Contains with garlic bread, sausage, ham, egg. We took it two plates.
© Chicken baked omlet: mind blowing. Till date the best baked omlet i have ever had.
© Hamand Bacon Baked omlet: pork omlet. Nice one. Not that superb like other one. But nice.

Bevarage
_____________
© Watermelon Fizz - okay one. I wish it could have been more chilled.
© Cucumber Fizz - nice one. Only problem i had it was not that chilled i expected.
© Tiramisu cappachino : this was very very nice. We took it twice.
© Ginger honey tea: mind blowing. The taste was just refreshing. Took it twice.

Dessert:
____________
© Brownie with hot chocolate and ice cream : common one. But owssum.

Now to conclude: it was a very nice experience indeed. Their food taste superb , only i found their cold beverages need some improvement.

The service was very nice considering the great rush they had at that time.

Last but not the least: they theme of the restaurant, the menu card is just cherry on the cake

All that cost: 1639 INR. For 4 people.

To management:
____________________
You guys are just excellent. But just try to upgrade your cold beverages section. Particularly in this summer. :)

To all:
_________
Yes- give it a try. We will surely to visit it again. Till then happy fooding :)

I just returned from Abar Baithak and I feel so happy and giddy inside. This place is full of sophistication and erudition. It manages to display a dose of traditional Bangaliana while managing to stay appealing and relevant to the modern generation. 
Ordered Thin Crust Chicken Pizza ,Chicken Meat platter, Fresh Lime Soda, Cucumber Fizz and Khush Lassi. 
Recommend the Cucumber Fizz. Absolutely wonderful. Meat platter is obviously one of their most popular offerings.
Loved this place.

This place is very close to my heart because of two reasons. 
1. This cafe pays a tribute to Satyajit Ray's Feluda . If you love him ( I am sure you do ) , this cafe is a must visit. You would see doodles of him along with minute ingredients from various stories of Feluda. 

2. Perfect balance of taste in their food items. 
This cafe maintains a perfect taste in every food item. My personal favorite would be Chicken Seekh Kebab Sandwich along with Chicken Platter. 

P.s - The whole team working behind this cafe deserves a loud cheer. :)

I have been in Abar Baithak so many times that I don't even remember. Recently I have been shifting bases very frequently so was not so regular but as soon as I came back in Kolkata for a summer visit I headed here twice within 2 weeks despite all the works to be done within this short span. Once with my best friend (who is also a regular) and my fiancee (who is from north Kolkata and not familiar with the place). I am in love with this place, with the food, the ambience and the customer service. They remember familiar faces and behave so much friendly with them. My fiancee

A nice cozy place with an interesting decor. It's located in one of my Favourite areas of the city and certainly a great place to hang out with buddies or family. We ordered the chicken pizza which was pretty decent according to the price, French fries which I felt was quite Low in quantity and lastly the chocolate brownie with ice cream as dessert which was the best of the three. I will certainly recommend to visit the place for a nice chilled out adda specially to the core bengalis(like me) out there.

Coming to the food,we ordered the famous chicken platter which was simply amazing. We ordered chicken wraps which was finger licking.  Then for dessert we ordered chocolate meghraj which was simply amazing and my favourite was affrogato ( vanilla ice cream served with coffee and chocolate chips) . Its yummy....! Then I took a chocolate muffin which was freshly baked and melted in mouth. Definitely visiting again. Oh...and the price is pretty reasonable.

What do you do when your friend from out of town comes to her hometown and does not want to leave her own neighbourhood while planning a coffee date? You look for a cosy place to share all that girly talk, of course! And this place seemed to answer all that we were looking for! We have been hearing of this place for quite some time from friends who frequent cafes. Also, for Satyajit Ray and more specifically Feluda fans, this is a place to relive nostalgia -- since the decor is themed that way. Also this is one place where one can while time with friends with a handful of games options, or even alone due to a rack full of books to browse or read. Coming to food, it is satisfactory with limited options.

Was here couple of days back. The ambiance was great, the set up great. We ordered for a wrap, a sandwich and cold coffee. The food was great, however, the cold coffee was a big let down. It was total cream which had to be let alone till the coffee settled and by that time lost its cool. Moreover, I was pressurized by the staff to drink it in that situation. It ended as a pretty uncomfortable situation.
Hope to be here again to try.

Visited this place on a weekday afternoon - and it's was pretty full. 

Followed zomato for directions and reached there easily. Though need to walk a bit if you are using public transport. 

On entering you are greeted with a nice couple of seats outside, for smokers. 
One you enter there are two floors. 
Books and curios line the wall and there is a pay counter. You need to place your order in the counter and also pay at counter but after you finish eating. 
There are is a big seating area upstairs as Well, which has a couple of couches.
The ambience is more for nice place to sit and chill with your friends on a hot summer day. 

Service and servers were both good and friendly. 

We had ordered a cold coffee, a watermelon ice tea and fish fingers and the barbeque chicken onion pizza. 

Let's get to the good stuff, water melon ice tea was absolutely delicious. Fresh and full of flavour. What an refreshing drink.  The fish fingers was 6 in number, very adequately seasoned and a crispy thin coating and served with kasundi. Was finger licking good. 
The pizza was very average, faar too much onions and too little chicken. 
But the disappointment was the cold coffee. Tasted more like milk than coffee. They tag themselves as "coffee shop" so why not make good coffee? 

Price alright when compared to the ambience and quality of food. 
I'm an coffee addict and it didn't steal my heart so I am not going back again. 

But, it is good place to spend an evening.

Visited this relocated outlet of Abar Baithak last month. This new Feluda themed decor and menu card will definitely make any Bangali happy. However when se visited most items were unavailable. We ordered chicken tortilla wraps, a fresh lime soda and one watermelon mojito. The wrap was fantastic. Very filling and delicious. However they forgot our drinks, and provided them almost at the end after repeatedly reminding them. The lime soda was perfect, the watermelon mojito disappointing. Pocket pinch is very reasonable. Definitely worth giving another shot
P.S. if you have been to the old outlet of Abar Baithak, you will definitely miss the bean bags.

Pros:
1. Friendly ambience - From the staff to the people around are very amicable. It is a modern incarnation of the Coffee House, where you get to see a lot of bright youthful people from nearby colleges and schools, who are open to discussing anything from Politics, to films, to art. 

2. The ensemble menu at low costs - This place serves it all. From Flury's style meat platters to Fritata and quiche. The prices are low enough to yield you a hearty meal below INR 500.

3. Good location - The place is located at the lane opposite to Tandoor Park at Jodhpur Park and very close to Jodhpur Park post office.  

4. The Feluda inspired decor - Bengalis have a strong love-hate relationship with Ray's work, which is the theme of this restaurant. The place reeks of Feluda everywhere from cushions to the walls. 

5. You can be yourself - Unlike regular restaurants, you can wear whatever you want to here, speak as loudly as you want, work on your lappy and do wherever you want to, without being judged.  

6. Cash,  cards accepted (a few peeps I knew, who are the veterans of this restaurant have even dined on credit!)

7. No one will ever push you out even if you have been sitting for hours

8. Board games 

9. Books to read

10. Outside seating arrangement 

Cons:
1. No Smoking Room- 'Bong' antels or the budding intelligentsia (as they love to be looked upon) believe the more they smoke, the more well read they appear.  I have been trying to figure out their logic in thinking so, for years now, anyway since they are the core patrons of Abar Baithak and thus unlike civilized restaurants, here people smoke openly. Requesting them to find a room, will yield you unpleasant experiences. 

2. The place is very noisy (has no music to drown the 'adda' of the emerging buddhijibis) 

3. No alcohol/hookah (but enough tobacco smell for passive smoking, though!)

4. Single occupancy loo

5. Not a family / dating place (unless you want to yell your date and never see him/her again) 

What should you order? 

Everything here tastes beyond delicious at nominal prices and is served esthetically and (I believe) prepared in a hygienic way! 

But these dishes stand out:

1. All meat platter (Chicken platter, if you don't want pork) 
2. Pork pepperoni and meat ball pizza (all their pizzas are thin crust) 
3. Roobies Tiramisu flavored tea/Sudhui chocolate hot chocolate 
4. Club/Chicken Seekh kabab sandwich
5. Baked ham and pork omelette/ Salad
4. Chocolate/Ice cream Sandwich 
6. Peanut butter and Oreo shake 


P. S: The waiters are so courteous, that they do not even mind customizing your orders on request.

Overall verdict - Nice hangout for young large groups.  Not suitable for families, couples, middle aged groups. No full course meals available, but if you are not a typical Bhaat seeking Bengali, you shouldn't complain.  Avoid if you have bronchitis, asthma or other breathing issues. This place will either get you addicted to itself (very likely if you are a college goer or a young professional aged 17-25) or annoy you enough to never visit again (if you are not a fan of Classic Bengali antlamo 😂, happen to be a non-residential Bengali/Non-Bengali, with limited knowledge of Feluda, are not a fan of informal/casual dining) nothing in between!

Went to this place today with my friends. It was over crowded. We had to wait like 20 mins to get a seat. Good ambience. Ordered irish coffee ( was served with cream on top, was good ), trimasu coffee( tasted like normal cold coffee), french fries ( my all time favourite, but quantity was very less ), chicken salami sandwich ( was the best dish we ordered, taste was yummy ). A little disappointed with the fact that we were unable to order the chicken platter dish because some of the ingredients was not available according to them. I'd like to visit this place again.

This is one of the coolest adda joints of Kolkata now-a-days. Though located in one of the most happening and crowded locality with lots of competition around, they have proved that they are here for a long run.

When you enter this place, the first thing you'll notice is the bloody amazing ambience. Cherry on top if you are a Feluda fanatic. First thing to notice is the iconic green ambassador of Lalmohan babu placed as a sofa in smoking zone. Enter the main area, there's sitting arrangements with pillows having sketches from different Feluda novels. It's a mad place for bibliophiles since they have a huge collection of books to read and to buy as well. Head to the 1st floor and there is some cool caricatures covering the wall with couple sitting arrangements. Then enters the area of the badass Maganlal Meghraj. There is his iconic gaddi with wooden desk with guns pointing towards you from "ghulghulis". **Horendous byapar**

Next comes the food and beverages offered. They have an insane amount of hot and cold beverages available. Tea, coffee, milkshakes, mojitos - whatever tried till now, was value for money. Their barbeque chicken pizza is one of the best ones ever tasted. The same goes for those baked omlettes and chicken platter. For dessert, you gotta try brownie with ice cream. The staff are very friendly and helpful and very good photographers :P

Then comes the addabaji. It has indoor games available like monopoly, scrabbles and carrom. There are drawing book and color pencils so that you can doodle some if you want. And there are some awesome handcrafts that you can buy, especially those mugs with Kolkata Caricatures.

My only suggestion for Abaar Boithak would be to go crazy over the food menu and add some more options. Otherwise regularites will soon have nothing new to taste.

This place is a hybrid of an expensive cafe and "parar addazone". The food is real good in here and the ambience is as sweet as their sizzling brownie. There is a carrom board for a friendly doubles match, a chess board to work your brain while enjoying the coffee and different magazines to enhance you knowledge. 
We ordered a chicken salad and a chicken sandwich with coffee and a virgin mojito. And for dessert, the sizzling brownie. Ah! Those were exquisite.
And also this is a must visit if you are a Feluda fan.

A small but beautiful cafe situated at the quaint Jodhpur Park area that is celebrating the iconic Bengali sleuth Feluda created by none other than Satyajit Ray.They have some interesting photo-frames & paraphernalia on Feluda there.The ambiance is quite cozy & informal with lots of books,a carrom board,smoking area,even a space for live performances.We chanced upon a jig by the Bengali band Ujaan on our visit on last Sunday.Now the main part,the food.The Mixed meat platter is a must try.It tasted as good as that of the famous restaurant of Park Street in a price less than the half of there's.We also tried Kahwa tea & Choco cigar tea and liked them thoroughly.Overall a lovely experience altogether.

Lovely place to spent a fun filled evening. Bengaliana is the word that will come to your mind when you first see the decor. An apt cafe for people of all ages. You can come here and have a lovely evening over ludo/scrabble and a beautiful cup of coffee. I visited this place on a weekday at around 8.30 pm and we literally couldn't find a place to sit for the first 15 mins. It was crowded and you could Sense it that people around you were having a quality time. This is a place which you can frequently visit for ADDA. Will surely come back . The baked omelette and the caramel pudding is just WOW.

Hoped into this lovely place one Sunday evening with a friend. One could hear the buzzling sound of the cafe from a distance. There were localites seated and standing outside the cafe, quite comfortably. Upon stepping in, you can almost find yourself getting absorbed with the kind of energy that place has. A tiny non AC area for the loud Adda that we Bengalis pride ourselves in, the light and heavy smokers who can also fancy themselves over a game on medium sized carrom. Now this isn't all.
We went upstairs from all the jostling below. My friend and I found a cosy corner to get a full view of the cafe. The decor could amply be described as lively with a large urban chandelier that centred itself on the ceiling.
My friend and I both ordered ourselves​ couple of Darjeeling teas with fried Fish fingers and French fries. What particularly impressed me was that this cafe strictly adheres to classic modern cafe food and beverage items, at the same time not very stereotypical with the varieties it has to offer under each category. Very impressive!
I would love to try out the other darjeeling teas and the savouries!!!

They are brilliant. 
My friend invited me there and I found that cafeteria of my dream 😊.
Being a felu da fan from childhood it was like reinvent  your own self after a long work. 

I love there that coffee.. I can't remember the name properly but definitely it was lovely. Well that coffee starts with T and cost 120 rs. As a coffee lover I'm really truthful here. 

But I do suggest, test coffee before adding any extra sweet.  Well it was perfect for me without extra sugar.

For the first time I feel the sprit of kolkata.  I think this should be must visit place if you are near jadavpur.  

Love you people you are awsooommmeeee and inspiring.

Located in the middle of Jodhpur Park , Abar Baithak never ceases to amaze me. I had gone there a couple of months earlier and it was a lazy Bengaliyana adda style cafe. 
A few days ago when I returned I was frankly surprised seeing everything had changed. The cafe was a feluda cafe , air conditioned and had a distinctive panache about it. The peanut butter shake is pretty nice. As is the spicy Mexican chocolate.

Abar Baithak is quite an enigmatic place located behind EEDF. The best way to reach the place is to take the lane beside leather land opposite to South city. The first right and walk along the winding lane. You will see the place right in front of you.

The first glance at this cafe and I was thoroughly impressed. Being a Bengali, a Feluda themed cafe would no doubt be an attention seeker. The place celebrates 50 years of Feluda and ardent fans of the satyajit ray creation would obviously love this place.

It has a seating area outside and two floors inside. The decor is quite amazing. As already mentioned the theme is Feluda. So the walls, the cushions , the seating arrangements and the food menu has a nostalgic touch of different names of the Feluda adventure stories. The most unique thing about this place is that there is a large book rack which has lots of books. You can sit at one of the tables, take a sip from the Assam tea and read a brain storming story of Feluda or any other character. There are many books apart from the Feluda series.

Lots of games to keep yourself and your group engaged while taking bites from the food served. There is a carrom board, chess board and Scrabble. I am sure there would be other games too but these few caught my eye.

Now coming to the main thing - Food. The prices are not very high. Decent enough to visit frequently. We had chicken tortilla wraps, a platter of ham and chicken etc , normal coffee and cold coffee. All the preparations were good.
The most amazing thing about this place is that amidst of all the hustle and bustle of city life where everything is running out of time, here no one bothers to look at the clock.

And hence the crowd pulling character attributed to this place. :) Pretty nice, pretty niche kind. Oishwaria Mukherjee Sohini Biswas

Abar Baithak has become the new social hub of south Kolkata. I visited it for the second time last week and found that they have changed the entire setup and location a bit as well. It is now a two-floored cafe with the same kind of setup but differently decorated. The board games and the book shelves remain the same, so as the sitting area outside. 
The menu card has undergone a few changes with new inclusions and improvisations. I had coffee and Chicken Tortilla Wraps. Coffee being the stimulant and means of spending your free time with friends and loved ones, the wraps were good and has good portions of chicken filled with mayo and cheese. 
It has self order system and the service is good but they require a few more staff to look after all the customers from time to time. The food is tasty and prices are reasonable. 
Abar Baithak is a nice place to drop in with your friends for an evening snack.

I had heard a lot about the place, and decided to drop in here with my girlfriend one fine evening. The decor is absolutely amazing, with a touch of the quintessential bengali household - the books,carrom board, an old grandfather clock and the favourite Bengali sleuth- Feluda! The menu is designed to celebrate his 50 years and even though they mostly have beverages to offer, the place is nice for a good chat session. We ordered A Bubblegum Berry, a Tortilla Chicken Wrap and a Crabmeat Sandwich. All three turned out good. On a previous visit last year however, I was a little disappointed with the food. In spite of that, the place deserves to be praised just for it's ambiance and decoration. Definitely hoping to go back there.

Let me clarify beforehand. 
People who will go searching after this cafe, and yes, you will have to search quite a bit depending on your knowledge of the area, will not do so because of the quality of food they serve. No sir, it's the theme, which will resonate with every self respecting Bengali who have grown up devouring feluda.
Kolkata has  finally provided us with a restaurant which has not only aced the theme but also serves pretty decent food at quite affordable rates. Every inch of the restaurant exudes love the owner has for our favourite detective and you just one to sit there and bask in all your childhood memories.
Oh and we ordered a pizza and a french kiss and orange mojito and they were quite good. But to be frank we were too busy clicking away on our cameras to even care what we ate. 
We finished off with an affogato which was really delicious ( and probably a week of exercise down the drain).

If you are a bong and if your childhood was about trying to be Feluda,then this is the place for you. Very well organised and greatly implemented the whole Feluda theme. What I really liked was the minute details they have added in the decor. Food is great nothing to complain of. You will love the menu and how the menu looks.. yes at first I thought the menu was a book of Feluda, later told by my friend that this is a menu.

This place has been relocated two months back. And i love both. The current one is undoubtledly better than the previous outlet. It's more spacious and is beautifully decorated. I haven't had the chance of visiting this place many times. Everytime i craved for some evening coffee i'd always drop by. The staff is friendly and so are the owners.

Haven't tried any of the food items yet. Spent the summers having the classic cold coffee and cafe frappe. Also the chocolate meghraj is pretty yummy. Had the spicy mexican hot chocolate the last time which did not quite suit my taste. You also get some absolutely crunchy and delicious but rather small sized cookies.

All in all it's a nice café with reasonable rates.

A little hard to locate if you're going for the first time. The ambience is nice and varied, if that makes sense. There's an outdoor area, a few tables indoors and also a different jamming section on the first floor. The food is quite decent. Here's what we ordered-

-Non veg platter- Can't really judge a place on the basis of how well they cook mostly ready-made frozen meat pieces. It tastes good if you're like hungry and just want a lot of meat with some cheese toast but they need to up their meat variety with more kitchen cooked stuff and less store bought stuff. 

-Raspberry iced tea- I like my beverage really cold with very less sweet so this was perfect, no complaints.

-Cafe frappe- Good enough.

-Barbeque chicken pizza- Nice thin crust with a nice thick layer of mozarella so if you're one of those kiddish people who likes stringy pizza cheese, you'll love it. So yeah I loved it :P Ample toppings and definitely the highlight of the day.
 
- Brownie with icecream- a little less generous in quantity. But the brownie was crunchy on the outside with a lot of nuts stuffed so full marks for that. They can make it a little warmer though, specially when we're sitting in the AC. 

A nice place to sit and chat with your friends with a colorful, welcoming decor. The service is mostly self-done, but even then they could be a little more receptive to your needs which they weren't. Also moderate on the pocket, not too cheap. But still I would like to visit it again for a nice cup of tea and a good conversation.

Hats off for the brilliant idea of bringing back charm of having an adda while lazing comfortably on a takht posh reminding that famous scene where maganlal meghraj would invite jatayu to play part in the dangerous knife throwing game. Surrounded with a wonderful collection of Bengali books one can find a Cozy corner to enjoy a good read while sipping fine brews and nibbling on tasty sides. The addition of the carrom board completes the Bangali evening adda scene quite perfectly.
Though we were for a very short time and had only cappuccino it would be unjust to judge the food and service. Wish to check out the menu here sooner
Only regret would have been not being able to try hands at the carrom board. For the odd 30 mins we were there it seemed to manage the attraction quite well. Wish they had another board!

Diverting from the usual positive reviews about this place, I found nothing fantastic here. The theme may be attractive but it's not what people go there for. 

Hence coming to food, value for money is negligible. It's not there. It will, however, serve well people who want to upload a photo on Facebook. I just had an espresso and it tasted like the last time I puked. (Years ago, and it still made my memory fresh) 

Not to generalise, but this place caters to the pseudo intellectuals who love to pretend their আড্ডা is the consensus of humanity. 

Better for groups. Couples who wanna talk instead of fidget with their phones will be bored.

Visited this place on a monday evening. To be honest i am mesmerized by the place. They have such a nice vibe to the place that you feel like sitting there for hours.
We had ordered for:
Caramel cappuccino: creamy,frothy and very heavy. This almost fills you up.
Green apple mojito: it was served in a big mug. A bit sweeter for my liking. But was refreshing. Liked it.
All meat platter: loved loved loved it!! Enough said!
Easy on the pocket. Lovely staffs.
A big thumbs up! 👍👍

Located quite close to EEDF in Jodhpur Park. Honestly this place is quite over hyped. You definitely can spend good hours with your friends but incase you wish to opt this place to have a good meal, it's definitely not where you should be..
The ambience is very friendly. Decent crowd, mainly the youngsters. The menu was short and very less options which disappointed me. 
The food we had was also okayish.
Virgin Mojito tasted more like Fresh lime. Raspberry Iced Tea was good. 
We took the Non Veg platter and sandwiches.
The best thing I liked was brownie with ice cream. 

The prices are moderate. Our bill was about 760 bucks. Worth a try if you are visiting with friends for spending long hours.

A perfect place for pure bangali adda.. Went there with my friend Srinanda Chakraborty and loved the ambience at first glance. A feluda themed café; the little details like Maganlal Meghraj er baithak khana, banabihari's caution on the door, the books, old telephone and the menu card caught my attention. Beautiful interior decoration. Cozy homely atmosphere, we spent a good time. We ordered platters and mocktails, delicious! Amazing experience! Will definitely go again.

This place is too good. A wonderful ambience that gives you the feelings of being in the 'baithak khana' of Maganlal. Some of the must tries are crab meat sandwich, plain lassi and brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate. I've visited here twice and absolutely love this place. You can spend time with your partner's or visit with a gang.

Being to this place named "Abar Baithak" feels like the west meets the east .... Wow .. the charm of old school adda meets the modern world of classic ... 💓 Totally gives a mental satisfaction ..... 😇 
From the food quality to presentation to the service the people provided n mainly the ambience, just caught my heart . If one visits this place, then a piece of story they can create by just observing the pple, the lights n everything ... 😍 
So, coming to food ....  I ordered 2 things  ... The chicken platter which was a filling one  n damn tastyyyy .... N ... The last thing ... Spicy Mexican hot chocolate , something that was new to me n was like a blessing to my sour throat ... 😋 Amazing .... 😍😍😍 
Lastly, wanna say ... Abar Baithak team@ did a wonderful job, will surely revisit to enjoy the warmth n comfort .. 😇

What a wonderful endeavor to capture the old Bangali tradition of cha coffee and adda in the modern day Uber chic cafe culture! Abar Baithak gives you the 'Rok er Adda' vibes in every nook and corner of its space. Starting from the Feluda theme to the moderately ranged menu to the regulars jabbering and hustling over the carrom board, this cafe spells ' Bangaliana' in this cosmopolitan metro city. I love the Chicken platter which fills my stomach and soul at a neat RS 165 and the refreshing ginger honey tea. Prices are competitive. 

P.S Watch out for the Maganlal Meghraj er ghor on the first floor from where u can see revolvers pointed at you from the gulguli! How cute <3

Really don't know how to start my review for this place. Awesome, wonderful, mind blowing, fantastically fabulous!!! It's a hidden gem in the middle of Jodhpur Park. A small lil café which will instantly transport you to the era of Feluda. Beautifully d done decor. The maker has put in his/her heart and soul in it and that's quite evident. Absolutely cost-effective and provides full value for money. A loud shout to the friendly staff. Thank you so much for providing us such an amazing place to chill. Kudos to the entire team!!!

The perfect place for that traditional Bengali adda. A paradise for book lovers and the decor is a plus for the Feluda fans like myself. Ambiance is homely and you get a touch of nostalgia from it. The staff and the owners are very courteous and friendly. Coming to the food, we tried the thin crust pizza and the chicken omelette which were absolutely delicious. But my favourite was the peanut butter oreo milkshake which is by far the best milkshake i have ever tasted. Visit the place if you want to have a good time with your friends, and obviously enjoy great food. Thank you.

Bringing back the feel of baithak, abar!

Comfy bean bags, books on the shelf, many games and the big carrom board
The interior makes it  most apt place for you to sit and chill with your friends, over coffee or tea. 
And, it is indeed great for good coffee, specially cold coffee.If you are in mood of mocktails, i highly recommend the kokum one, it was so good that i couldn't click a picture.  
Apart from tha, have tried the chicken salad which has fresh veggies and lettuce with tiny bits of chicken, not enough though. 
The platter is the most filling and delicious to have, having a perfect sunny side up, salami, chicken hams, and toasted bread with cheese. Though i would havr preferred had  the cheese been goeey. The sausage perfectly made. So, a good dish! 

Great food and value for money.

Been there last year on the eve of Saqi's performance and to tell the truth, the place is superb right from the onset. The food was good too but the antique assembly of home decor and books make you drool over coffee. The owners are very warm and they are happy to see you everytime you do get there.
A great place to be in if you are nearby South City!

Oh! The decorations!
A book lovers paradise! And a trigger for Feluda fans!
The first thing that hit me when I entered was the smell of books. Shelves full of books beside the seating area, from which you can take and read if you want. Or you are in a deep discussion about one of them, and having a confusion, just take it from the shelf and flip to the page. Books covering all the eminent Bengali authors, Tintin comics― a real treat for the eyes and the mind.
And the Feluda connection! From the menu card "Celebrating 50 years of Feluda" to the cushions each depicting a Feluda story, to the wall art and the graphic pictures and the panel's. And the Feluda props― Anubis, Feluda's paper knife, Lamohanbabu's jap jantra, Sidhujyatha's transistor and many more. Only one thing I would like to point out― I'm pretty sure that the Colt .38 is a revolver, not a semi automatic.

The place is very aptly named 'Abar Baithak'.
About the "Baithak" part― an awesome place for adda. You can take a cup of coffee and sit for as long as you like and indulge in a conversation. And the coffee is good (had nothing except a coffee, so can't comment about the food). And so is the service. There is also a carrom board so you can strike up a storm if you want to. Or if you wish to be alone and read up a book or do some work on you computer, you can do that too, soothing in the ambience with a cup of coffee.
The "Abar" in the name, I think, refers to the fact that once you go, you'll want to return again. I, for one, surely will.

🐾Tucked in the lanes beside EEDF pharmacy, this place was bookmarked for a quiet long time.It was one of our friends birthday that we happend to visit this place for a '' long Adda session". The Zomato review of this place DIDN'T disappoint us at all. The decor deserves 4.5/5,loved the way they worked hard on their sitting arrangement with an open area for "some really great Adda over a cup of coffee and a cigarette" .The interior had a carrom board and some good books to drool over !! :') We ordered for -
• English breakfast
• affagato
• cappuccino
•french kiss
• chicken salami
The all meat English breakfast is highly recommended!!! The sausages being very soft and tasty. The cappuccino too wasn't disappointing :)
Next time you want to have some good gossips,lots of talks amidst good food then This place is worth a visit!!! I personally prefer this place to be visited if one happens to come to Kolkata,you would definitely get a warm ''bengali feeling''
#Abar baithak as the name says " come sit again " I would love to have some more visits to this lovely place

This is my favorite cafe in Kolkata. And now when they have upgraded with the feluda theme they have taken it a notch higher. This place defines in it way the eternal bengai love for "Adda". The top floor hosts another cozy place with a beautiful seating arrangement. A must visit for people who like to sit for hours and sip over cha and coffee. They have also upgraded their menu with both savory and sweet dishes and also added more options in their beverage range. While their do try their Crabmeat Sandwich and Blueberry Cheesecake.

Abar Baithak is equivalent to Nostalgia and childhood memories to me. Every alcove of this place depicted the tit bits that I grew up with - Feluda (the unparalleled creation of Satyajit Ray), Tintin, Asterix......the list is indeed long. The interior will give goosebumps to everyone. Describing it will be difficult. Abar Baithak is full of artefacts and antiques which are truly amazing. They also have a carrom board 😊 I had a Chicken Breakfast platter - it had two sausages, one poached egg, chicken ham, chicken salami and a cheese toast. Everything was perfect on this platter, however the egg was poached to a soft boil state, the yolk was not runny as it should be. Also I got a second flush Darjeeling Tea, great concoction. The staffs were extremely helpful and amicable. Even, the ashtrays are unique - it resembled cigarette pack. Good Job Abar Baithak. Abar dakha hobe (will meet you soon). Highly recommended!!

Ahhh....a hint of nostalgia... The great works of Satyajit Ray all around...wooden furnitures...a retro ambience reflecting a hint of the older days which were devoid of smart phones and electronic bricks. The place captures a true essence of 'Baithak' a word which seems to have outlived its years with 'carrom boards' not being a darling of the current generation (yes the place has one ). The food is not half bad either...I liked the chicken platter.. Rather we liked the chicken platter...and also the ham and salami sandwich....all together, I would urge everyone to give this cozy place a shot.....

The irony is I have updated all these with the help of an electronic brick myself....

Very good location, almost on the main road. But just away from it, so parking isn't an issue. Found the inside decor to be nicely thought of, reminiscing of Feluda and other quintessential Bengali characters. The décor is perfect to sit and chat away with a little snack and drinks. Personally liked the carrom board which they've added on one side of the ground floor, so that customers go and play when they get bored. Would suggest this place if you're not up for anything heavy and want to leisure your time away.

Good place to have a "Baithak" and some "Adda". There are many such adda joints coming up in Kolkata and each is unique in its own way. This place has its USP too.....the eternal Feluda. Ambience is lively, service is good. Food I think is a bit overpriced compared to the quantity and quality, but I guess the prices are as result of the entire package. Good to be here with friends for a coffee chat.

A 4 star rating for a place where I have never tasted any food seems unfair, but the feel good factor that I get every time I am at Baithak is next to a few. The ambience , the service is impeccable. Their new spicy Mexican hot chocolate is a very different take on hot chocolate and definitely worth trying.   It's a very happy place to be :)

Visited here after the reopening. Situated walking distance from jodhpur park. Best adda place to hangout with buddies. It has a outdoor sitting. Group sitting arrangement inside. Separate couples sitting arrangement upstairs. Book shelf's, carom board, old car designed seat, classy café looks, bengal themed walls this was the perfect example of how bengal cafés looks. Ambience was really good and hospitality and amazing. Decent staffs and service in reasonable time. Presentation was superb. Price was pocket friendly. I tried mochiato sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espressocoffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" or "spotted" so the literal translation of caffee macchiatois "stained coffee", or coffee with a spot of milk. Coffee lover gonna loved it. Must try place. Recommended to all.

Well,  this place is one of the highly rated café in South Kolkata as it is very evident from the reviews written by people who visited this place. I myself thought the same until yesterday. I would like to share a incident that happened yesterday on 06th Jan,  when my one my friend went to meet her close friend for small chat, they ordered 2 cups of hot chocolate and some other finger food. I assume they sat for around 2 hours in the cafe and left the cafe by 7.pm. So these girls went ahead and paid the bills,  and parted ways to their homes. Now one of these girls receive a call at 12.30am,  and this lady who called started accusing the girl that they have lifted a phone from their cash counter,  as shown by their cctv footage. And this lady went on saying that they need to come to cafe next day at 10am and see the footage,  and this matter would be taken to the police.  Now these two girls,  were petrified and didn't understand how to react to this situation. The girl happened to record to phone conversation,  and after hearing the way this lady talked,  I myself was shocked that why would someone call at such odd hours and accuse someone. So the next day these girls informed their parents about this very phone call,  and the parents along with their daughters decided to visit the cafe and talk to the owners. Before they left for the cafe,  the lady happened to call again and this time,  she crossed the limits by saying to her that her career is at risk,  as the police of India are cruel to criminals,  well Madam who are you decide whether these girls are criminals and deserve to be handed over the police? So after the girls reached the cafe along with their parents,  they asked the customers seated on the 2nd level to move to the 1st level,  so that silently they can solve this issue,  and their name doesn't get spoilt,  as they have accused these girls of thee crime they didn't commit. So they now accept that the phone was later found at the café,  as they kept it in some safe place where they didn't find,  they cover up by saying that in the footage by the 1st camera the phone is present on the table,  and next footage the phone is missing,  and one of the girls had lifted it and placed it in the bag.  But how could they say accuse that the girls had taken it?  In today's time everyone has a portable mobile device along with them,  the girl then was placing her own phone inside the bag. Now,  after all this drama,  they accepted the fact that they made a mistake,  and in return they offered them a cup of coffee and pudding,  is that the compensation for the all allegations,  humiliation, and stress these girls faced?  Just because you have an upper hand,  doesn't mean that you can blame anyone,  at least have the courtesy to speak to your customers,  those girls paid for the services you provided them, try to be polite to your customers. Hence,  I wouldn't recommend this cafe,  no doubt the food and ambience is amazing.  But the behavior of the staff is awful.

I loved this place on my very first visit. The interiors and the menu are celebrating 50 years of Feluda on screens. Even their upstairs seating arrangements is named as Maganlal Meghraj. As a bengali, these names are enough to send a thrill down your spine.
It's a place where you can relax back with a novel or your close group discussing anything under the sky.
Coming to food, it's quite reasonably priced. They had  a good variety of tea and coffee options. In snacks, the menu is short but suffiecient.

This is an amazing, amazing, amazing place. Always in my priority list whenever I am around. The staffs know me quite well actually. 😁
I love the interior, I love the Food, I love the ambience, I love the friendly nature of them. This place is more like home. 
The Platters are must try according to me. And Chocolate sandwich too.
Wait !! Even the wraps too !!!

Forget about the must tries. Please order anything from the menu, n I know you won't be disappointed.

Abar baithak is located in a small lane in jodhpur park. Its kind of tucked in the bylanes of the area. I had gone there with my friends. It is a perfect hangout with lots of indoor games and the food is quite good. We took a meat platter sandwich etc. I particularly liked their cold coffee. This place is perfect for college goers and young at heart who would like to catch up with old friends admist lovely food.

Abar Baithak is located in Jodhpur Park.It is a pleasant place to hang out.I have tried their Cappucino ,it's yummy and wonderful.Baked Omlette Is delicious and divine.They used to serve decent foods in pocket friendly range.The best part of them I liked is their Ambience,you will actually feel good to hang out and sit there for hours.

Located in the lanes of Jodhpur Cafe, this cafe is less on decor but quite spaced out. They have a carrom board placed in the corner and have bean bag/chair seating arrangements. They also have outdoor seating arrangements which allows smoking. The menu is small and crisp but the options are nice. We tried there peanut butter and chocolate milkshake, first flush tea, cappuccino and the chicken platter.
The prices are reasonable. They have jam sessions in the evening. It lives up to it's name of a "Baithak" filled with fun, adda, and music.

To start of with, while penning down a few words about one of the most happening buzzword of the town, the first thing that needs to be rectified is the tagline/caption, "Abar Baithak" is carrying along with its name!! Yes, it is incomplete to stamp a place as 'the coffee shop", where they are equally efficient in serving brilliant teas as well!!

In fact this place happens to be a confluence of intellect, culture, ideas, and aesthetics that meets each other over some tea or coffee, along with some accompaniments to munch on, and off course with some pure adda(chats/gossips)!!

The decor is kept completely casual which is perhaps the biggest USP of this place, being successfully able to provide the perfect adda charm. The shelves stacked with books ranging from various taste & preference can easily be claimed to be a perfect cozy corner for bookworms...

If you judge the place completely on the basis of food, you may find it a bit overpriced, but on the contrary, if you consider it to be a package where food and intellectual minds concoct each other, surely it can be a sheer delight for you anyday

Abar Baithak is more the place of Adda then a restaurant. Visited here last night. Full of crowd. A Carrom Board is set up where you can go and play.
It has two parts, one outside and one inside, demarcated by a glass wall.
A shelf full of books one side containing all the new collections from Bengali and English Literature. And it gave the place a look of library.
Coming to the food, it didn't impress me. Very average and over priced food.
Took the Choco Cigar Tea - Average in taste.
With it we took the Choco Muffin and Brownie with ice cream. Both average in taste and much over priced.

A visit to Abar Baithak was long due. Went there on a Tuesday night and was surprised to see the full house status on a weekday. There are 2 sections and we chose to sit in the inner section, comfortably on the bean bags.
Decor is typical cafe type. Also, the place was extremely chaotic. A group was happily enjoying a carrom board play session while another group was merrily singing Rabindrasangeet. I quite liked the positive energy all around.
Coming to the food, it was a disappointment. Although we liked the Choco cigar tea, the muffin was totally average and the Brownie with ice cream was below average. 
Overpriced considering the quality of food.

Went here today for an unplanned evening date. We ordered a corn and mushroom sandwich, a chicken platter (consisting of chicken sausages, chicken ham, chicken salami, a perfectly poached egg, cheese toast, a bit of mayo) and chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce, topped with chocolate chips.
The portions were quite good, and I was quite full even though I shared it with my partner. The sandwich was bursting with fresh flavours, the platter won us over with its simplicity and the dessert was just sinfully rich. The ambience was quite laid-back and the array of books and other knick-knacks for sale were really interesting too. What caught my partner's attention though were the sketches on the wall, particularly one which was a map of Holmes' Baker Street Address.
The unemployed student in me is unhappy only with the amount of additional tax that was to be paid, but the foodie in me is well-satiated. I  recommend it to everyone :)

Visited this place for evening coffee with friends. Had heard so much about it. The first impression was of those olden day clubs...little dusty, old furniture, carrom board, books..a very warm place to enter.

We ordered cold coffees and a slice of red velvet cake. Honestly it was terrible. All three coffees were extremely sugary sweet and watery. The red velvet cake tasted quite average. The staff however was friendly and helpful. But nothing could salvage the bad coffee.

So it's a decent place to visit..maybe the food is good (i cannot judge that). But a good experience.

Had heard a lot about this place. Went to check it out. First of all I would say that this more of a modernized version of coffee house. Real chilled out place. The total ambience....the "bangalir adda" feel will impress you surely. The layout of the cafe is cool enough with an outside as well as inside area. The carrom board in the corner, the comfy bean bags, the books on shelves really give you a laid out feeling. The staff is very courteous as well. Coming to the menu...they offer quite a variety. Loved the chicken platter and the coffees and the tea. Would surely visit more.

Use ur google map to find this place.! (Land mark:- opposite lane of Allahabad bank) Abar baithak is a bengali word which means "congregate again" for the purpose of  gossip, fun and carrom to play. A quiet place to hangout with  friends, provided with a hell lot of books.
This cafeteria serves perfect first class darjeeling tea. :) 
We had brownie with hot chocolate and ice-cream (a must try) , baked chicken omlet and chicken platter which consists of cheese toast, chicken sausage, chicken salami, chicken ham and egg poach.

Visited this cozy café on one sunday evening located in the interior of Jodhpur Park, with one of my close school friend, who stays in the same neighborhood. I just felt like a homely ambience - walls stacked with books, musical corner, vinyl wall papers, specially the game corner at the entrance of the café - its a mixed feeling like a home and 'parar club' what we call crowded with young as well as seniors hangout point. Coming to food I had cold coffee which tasted good and my friend had first flush - her all time favourites. We also had the home made caramel pudding which tasted very yummy... Rates are reasonable and the staffs are very friendly.

The arrangement of the cafe is really nice. My sister-in-law had her art exhibition here, which is an amazing concept of having art exhibitions inside a cafe. But the food is not really nice and the ambiance is also not very well organised. Seemed a little over-hyped to me. But altogether a place you can go if you want to sit for long to catch up with a friend.

If you have been looking for a place where you could hang out by yourself, without feeling bored or awkward, this is definitely the one. And believe me, I visit a LOT by myself. The collection of books and free Wi-Fi is enough to make me sit on the beanbags for hours on end.

The ambience is quite relaxed and welcoming. You would love checking out the pictures hanging from the walls or the knickknacks on sale.

I would recommend the Pepperoni and Meat Ball Pizza, Chicken Sandwich, Ginger and Honey Tea and the Orange Mojito. Most importantly, they make a different confectionary item every day (Red Velvet Cheesecake, Chocolate Pastries etc.) and would keep you guessing every time you go back. Trust me, you would want to come back to this place!

Been here twice. This place is located just opposite Jodhpur park. A great place for hanging out with your squad. You get a lot of variety on the beverage part...like a lot! The cappuchino and cold coffee and iced tea all are good . The food is decent at the price listed. The meat platter was mostly good but the bacon wasn't! The affocado needed to be sweeter!! This place has an amazing ambience...the decor was pretty nice. There are also books and board games for passing time which is quite cool. Definitely going there again and and again!

Inspite of hearing rave reviews and it being very close to my college, I had never had the chance to visit. So, recently, I made it a point to stop by. It is near the Allahabad Bank at Jodhpur Park. The cafe has two sections. One smoking zone out side with a few tables and a spacious cafe inside. There are board games and a shelf lined with books that you could buy. People come here and sit for hours over a coffee while working on their laptops. Reminds me of the American cafes we see in the movies all the time. We ordered a pizza on the waiters recommendation and a cafe frappe and a Boston Ice tea The drinks were good enough. The pizza however was below average. We tried the Affogato too. It was a scoop of vanilla icecream dipped in cold black coffee in a bowl . It was okay. I have heard much about their chicken platter. Must try that someday.

Hits and misses with this one. I love the idea of Abar baithak and the relaxed cozy atmosphere. It's one of those homely cafes which had famous patrons and became an overnight sensation. Now coming to the food , almost everything on the menu comes from the frozen food section in the mall. So not the most innovative. Loved the crab meat sandwich and the non veg platter. But chicken ham yewwww! Seriously! Cha coffee pretty much tastes the same everywhere so no point in singing praises for that.

Good place, if you just want to sit down and not eat or drink too much. Had too much to eat, and wanted to sit down for a bit. Unfortunately we were in the southern part of the city, so coffee house was pretty far away. So decided to crash here. The place is nice, although the crowd here is a bit 'wannabe' types. But the life of this place seems to be "Shanti da", the quintessential Kolkata-r Bangali bhalo lok, who is more than happy to help you out. The service is personal and with a smile. That's the ISP of the place, not the the fancy decor or something else.

This is one of those good 'ol cafes that we are so familiar with. A quaint place, almost perfect for an afternoon or evening hangout with friends. Indoor gaming like carrom and chess are available. The place has quite a few bookshelves containing books for sale, books for a casual read, CDs. The place has a very simple yet elegant theme and I loved it. I saw a good many number of people sitting there all by themselves and working on their laptops, reminiscent of that bangalir coffee shop er Adda.

Food was standard mostly. The coffee is nice, and the mocktails are pretty decent. Sandwiches I'd have to try all to give a proper opinion. Cakes are also served . Tax is a bit too much I think. Lesser tax, a bit elevation in the standard of food will fetch this place much higher rating. For now 3/5 is all I'll give. Until my visit again. :)  Cheers

I was waiting to visit this place after reading zomato reviews for so long. Finally made it on a sunday morning in august for breakfast. As we entered we saw a band performing old hindi numbers inside...the inside sitting was full. So we had to sit outside...it was quite hot. 
Ordered for Kashmiri kawa tea, Orange pekoe tea, 1 cappuccino, another Special tea(forgot the name) on the server's suggestion. I tried Kashmiri kawa for the very 1st time...the amount of tea leaves for each cup was too small...I only got the taste of cardamom,ginger in boiling water. Totally disappointed with the flavour (I have no idea what it's supposed to taste like though).
The special tea recommended again tasted the same...the tea leaves used were of poor quality. No flavour whatsoever. People who generally don't have good quality Darjeeling tea can find these teas exotic but to me it's not.
Now coming to the food....Ordered Turkey sandwich (for my brother), Chicken grilled sandwich and Barbeque chicken pizza (they have introduced handmade pizzas recently)
The chicken sandwich was well-prepared and came with Lays chips. The Turkey sandwich was made with  frozen turkey salami which according to my brother was rubbery. The sandwich had red onion slices with mayo in the filling and nothing else.
Then came the pizza....it was a disaster...the chicken pieces were rock hard...the sauce was tasteless. I didn't find the handmade pizza to be anything near good.
The bill amount was 1000 something which didn't justify the quality of food or the ambience.
Personally I won't be visiting again or recommending this place which is so over-hyped in this locality !

This cafe located on a quiet lane in Jodhpur Park has that 'bangali'r adda' vibe right from the time you step in. There is an outdoor seating of around 16-20 people. A carrom board is placed in the indoors and the walls are done beautifully. The bookshelf and home decorative items are neatly placed on the left. There are comfy chairs, couches, bean bags etc but what stands out is the 'beter mora' which totally stands out. As for the food, we ordered Chicken Tortilla Wrap, Cheese and Corn Sandwich, Cold Coffee, Rock n Roll Cappuccino, Chicken Baked Omelette and French Fries. I simply loved their Tortilla Wrap and will surely go back to try the other varieties. It is highly recommended.

Have such a lovely collection of books. LIBRARY is most scary place in my life but this library I want to visit here again and love to visit. They also have bin bags which is needed for today's generation for so call "LYADH KHETE LAGAR JONNOH". Luckly i have got that. 
Now come to the foods,mocktails,shakes and all those stuffs. Today's menu was - KOKUM SORBET, FRENCH KISS, TURKEY SANDWICH, BARBEQUED CHICKEN WITH SAUSAGES, BLUEBERRY TORNADO AND CRUNCHY TIRAMISU. Quantity is enough and trust me shakes are made like you are in heaven. Ultimate relaxation in this place.

In a quiet evening after the pujos, we landed at this place quite impulsively. A quaint place brimming with life is how I would describe it.

The entry is impressive with the bistro kinda atmo.
The inside has a homely feel what with its different kinds of arrangement - regular seating as well as bean bags. The walls are replete with literary references and abstract art. On the opposite walls are lined up bookshelves, cds of upcoming bengali rock bands. Then there are also things to buy such as lamps, bags and other such paraphernalia.

The food:
We went for chicken seekh kebab sandwhich which was juicy and extremely tasty. A tad tastier was the grilled fish sandwich made out of bassa. The pizza is thin crust with dollops of cheese.
I had gone in a for an americano coffee. The hazelnut coffee was really tempting. My mum had gone for the Darjeeling muscatel tea which is a kinda of black tea, the aroma wafted through my nostrils seductively.

This is the place to be when you simply want to be chilled out for hours without a care in the world.

A good place to have a nice time with friends. Very comfortable seating arrangement and pleasant decor which instantly lifts your mood. Once you step in, you will be welcomed with a carrom board, books, bean bags and loads of people ;) It is very difficult to find a place during weekends and especially evening. Food is not that great, average quality and moderately priced. But do try their Red Velvet Cheese cake, they make it quite well. Staff is cordial and service is good. However, do visit this place, you wont be disappointed :)

I went on Saptami (8/10/16) and although I found a table to sit at, I feel the seating arrangements can be improved. Maybe remove a couple of 4-seater tables and put in 2-seater tables instead. The space management can be better, in other words. 
The attitude of the staff should improve too. Firstly, no one seems to notice new customers (and it's not as if the area was bustling with people and activity). Secondly, we were handed the wrong orders twice, and from the attitude of the servers it seemed as if they couldn't care less. 
We had ordered cold coffee, iced mocha and café frappe, a baked chicken omelette, and caramel pudding. The dishes was fine, and the caramel pudding was an absolute hit. :)

The squasy bean bag seated table being our favourite. Coming to the food well lets i didnot much like it. The price is quite decent but the dishes didnot quite appeal to my taste buds. The cafe is quite spacious and there are chances u might bump into tollywood celebrities sipping coffee next to you. I would suggest them to expand their menu and make the dishes a little less blunt. Will be soon uploading the pics of the foods i had.

Abar baithak, as the name suggets is an adda khana in its true sense.  One does not have to have hushed conversations because the ambiance is very playful. Located at jodhpur park, this cafe is the perfect place to hangout with friends. They have a indoor and outdoor seating arrangement. The bean bags are a real attraction and super comfortable. They have a carom board as well. 
Coming to talk about the food, they have a decent menu. I had ordered cold coffee and jasmine tea. They do not give free refills or complimentary cookies like other cafes do. This is one thing which was not very satisfactory.  I've also had the meat platter which was good. It had bacon , sausages , salami and a sunny side up.  Overall, it is a decent place.

Absolute favorite cafe of mine in entire Calcutta . I remember last year in monsoon , I've visited this cafe for the  first time, From that moment this place is special for Me. For work meeting , spending me time or birthday celebration this place witnessed it all. Shanti da is my favourite person from this place , Such a humble person I've ever came across ! Its like a second home for me ! 
Thank You Abar Baithak Team :)

Long Live 'Abar Baithak'

Love love love this place! It's perfect for a hangout with friends. Abar Baithak is located in a bylane in Jodhpur Park and quite easy to locate. The ambience is great and the staff is really friendly. Coming to the food, love their chicken wrap and bacon wrapped capsicum.

Loved it for the quirky cafe feel. Good food. Incredible array of coffee, shakes and tea. A bookworms coffee paradise. No rush. No wait. No lines (at least not yet).

Offers WiFi for your work and adda at the same time. And a genuinely courteous, friendly staff

I was here few minutes ago and had an average experience. I have heard a lot about this place the interior of this place with book shelves and stuff were amazing. The decor of the place was average. But was comfortable. I ordered Ham Sandwich and Raspberry Iced Tea. 
Ham Sandwich was tasty but tge Raspberry Iced Tea was nightmarish. I'd love to go back to this place once again. Need to taste the other dishes from the menu.

One of the best place around jodhpur Park for chilling out... The food quality is incredibly good.  Specially they are always open for experimenting with new food. Coffee and other drinks were okay..  Nothing special..  A bit overpriced maybe..  But try this place for having some quality time and mouth watering food. .

ambiance is very nice.. ideal for hanging out with your buddies, especially college reunions... you can take a seat in the part of the restaurant outside the air-conditioned bit if you're a smoker and want to save yourself from the trouble of getting up and going outside if you suddenly fancy a drag during your long "adda".  the choice of music played here is also commendable. food's pretty great as well.. the guy at the counter suggested the thin crust pizza.. i was a bit skeptical about that at first... but, boy am i glad that i had actually ordered that.. we took the grilled chicken and sauteed onion pizza.. and it was an absolute DELIGHT. its a reasonably priced place, especially for students on a limited budget. You'll be having a great time with your buddies here, but without burning a hole in your pocket. cheers guys... keep up the good work...!!!

so we discovered this tiny little place suddenly while roaming around the corners of jodhpur park. one true place for the nerds and book lovers. very much homely decor. couches are really comfortable for a long friendly get together. we took chicken platter. food was really good. but the quantity was really disappointing compared to price.same goes for the beverages..floor was full of dust that made us shift our place from the couch to the chairs. will expect more food items next time when i visit there along with cleanliness.

If you're looking for a  loads of adda  this is the best place for you. It feels very homely with very comfortable seating and affordable prices. You can play cards or scrabble or even carrom. The chicken platter has become a favourite of mine(who doesn't love meat for breakfast?).  I'm definitely gonna visit again.

An exact and apt place for a Bengali adda with not so over-rated chai-coffee like CCD & Barista. My favourite dish was chicken platter. It's a very good place to hang out. If you have ₹100-200 that'll be enough for a person. The Owners are very friendly and many times I see a lot many Tollywood artist shows up. Overall a good place.

We were on our way to Tolly  for our adda when we decided to have a change of plan and looked for something more nearer..Google map under it's restaurant nearby showed this name..as usual it guided us to reach the place..The result after an hour or so was "rich' in nature....nice setup...nice music...nice ambience.. But something different in experience.. Reminded one of the " boithokkhana" ..relaxed mood....books and music providing the "difference".... It can borrow the old Tata steel tagline and rephrase it " we serve food also"...but what we tested (green tea and baked chicken omelet) was tasty in its own right...Good experience.. Recommend a visit...

After seeing many rave reviews about this place on zomato, I decided to pay a visit. Located in one of the lanes of Jodhpur Park, its basically the ground floor of a house converted into a cafe. The ambience is nothing special. There are shelves with games and books, that you can read or buy.
Coming to the food, we tried the Boston Iced Tea- which is basically a cranberry flavoured Iced Tea. My friend tried the Cafe Frappe and said it was okay, nothing great. We tried the Barbeque chicken pizza which isn't on the printed menu yet, but was written on a white board. I quite liked the pizza. We ended the meal with a dessert called Affogato. Wikipedia describes it as a coffee-based dessert. It usually takes the form of a scoop of vanilla gelato or ice cream topped with a shot of hot espresso. What we got was a bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream over a really tiny piece of cake and what tasted like cold nescafe and chocolate sauce poured on top. It wasn't very nice but since it was ice cream and chocolate sauce, we managed to have it. All in all, it was a very average experience and I don't think I'll be visiting anytime soon.

Nice ambience and tasteful decor. Almost every item on the menu very reasonably priced. And their Irish coffee is a must try - it's one of the best I've had across cafes, yet. Friendly staff and the informal atmosphere makes it a nice place to hang out with friends. Just one thing - why the cheap plastic water bottles? I would've given this place five stars if it weren't for that. It sort of makes it look shoddy. Otherwise good place to go to, overall.

This is an extremely over hyped cafe as there is nothing in it really that suits it's 3.9 rating.. As an unbiased person with two visits to this place I dnt think it should get anything above two with its extremely average food and beverages. The platters are the only thing worth eating and maybe a bite of the crab meat sandwich but that's it

Dissapointed. I was expecting much more.
Today i tried chicken platter, chicken omlette, chicken tikka kabab sandwich.
Chicken omlette was not good. It was not upto the expectations.
Sandwich was ok type.
Chicken platter was good but not that awesome.
Interior can be improved.
Music should be played.
Staffs were welcoming and well behaved.
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.
Outdoor seating available.
Enough spacious and crowded.

Like everything has a first time, this is my first rating an outlet so low. N I am disappointed. Rave reviews on zomato, good feedback from friends, great passion about the marketing of the café made me walk in to this extremely packed up place on a Saturday evening with my friend only to be utterly ridiculed and walk away. The outlet looks like a handicraft fair on a maidan market, full of dust on the table and the floors; to some extent maybe the concept was to match upto the great level of our very old Coffee House of college street - so thats pardoned from my end. Because I am a foodie who gets attracted only to two things- FOOD & SERVICE. None of the tables were empty as we walked in but the server was courteous enough to arrange one and drop us the menu. N that, was it. We waited for someone to take the order (that time we weren't aware of their token system, so apologies) & to clean the table & some water . We called three of the servers couple of time only to be shown a palm (as one was calling out some token number) - indication to wait. We did for another 5 minutes n walked away. N none, mark my words, None were interested to check why did a guest (as we call in the hospitality world-me still being one) walk away without placing any order. 
That was my experience which unfortunately did not end up with that. Due to some unfortunate incidents which happened to land us back in the same place after 2 hours ( undoubtedly that was our fault n I owe up to it - n abar baithak management was quite helpful, so one positive thing amidst all negative) , I decided to give my feedback about my experience to the owners, who definitely patiently gave us an ear ; but at the same time, I was explained that how this happened for the first time . And how the day being a weekend, the place was jam packed n that's why we couldn't be attended. See guys, I still work in a hospitality chain, so I do understand the rush of a weekend. A guest when lands up on a Saturday, is aware of the fact that he/she might have to wait! So it's quite simple . N we were ready to wait. All we wanted was someone to come and talk to us, rather than showing us a palm. We just wanted to communicate that kindly clean up the able and replace the empty water bottle lying on the table for those 15 minutes. N when a guest is irate, please take it as a feedback, you need to let the person speak out her mind so that you can explain your points, thereafter. Rather than showing a poster with only one gesture of your hands that reads like you have to place your order at the billing counter. Seated a lil faraway from there, I don't have hawk eyes which will help me to get used to the way your café runs. So someone needs to tell me that. And please do not interrupt a guest by saying that I am repeating myself too many times even after you saying sorry. Anyway thanks for listening to us to some extent n I am sure you will have a little more extended training module for your staff about how to attend a first time visitor. Cz we could make the difference in your treatment with your regular customers and us. Although I will never come back here, but I sincerely hope none of your valued visitors are treated this way. Ever. Because, your food may surpass down gradually from great to good, but an extremely good service & behavior will keep the place going. All the best.

This place has pretty cosy interiors. Over time I have tried their chicken ham sandwich, chicken platter, non veg bowl fresh lime soda and orange mojito. Their drinks are great and the price is affordable. However, the quality of the food is not that good. The chicken platter mainly consists of frozen food that may be made at home. Hence, it seems to me a waste of money while eating out. The non veg bowl comprises of chicken nuggets of the sort that you can fry at home, along with French fries and tomato and chilli sauce, which was again a disappointment. The sandwiches are poorly stuffed and it feels like one is eating bread and lettuce when one bites in to the chicken ham sandwich. Overall, would recommend this place for hanging out and for the drinks but not for the food.

Abar Baithak have become quiet a popular food joint in South Calcutta among the student population. It has everything to become one...the space...the ambience... affordable food... variety of drinks... And the lovely collection of books and music. I visited this place a number of times and the only disappointment I used to have was - it was always packed with customers and apart from certain time slots it was really difficult to get a table for yourself. Patience is the only solution in this respect.
But in my last visit after a year, I found things have changed. This change includes the food quality even. I ordered the Chicken Platter and a Fresh Lime Soda along with some other things. The sausages lack the moisture that was a real turn off it was a bit dry, besides the egg poach they served was not properly cooked. My friend ordered a lassi and found a hair in it. But they refused to refund and not even brought a replacement. It is disappointing.

Located near Jodhpur Park post office.Coming from Dhakuria flyover take the right side lane beside sugar & spice,opposite to 'Tandoor Park' and then go straight and then take the lane opposite to Reliance fresh then take the first right turn and you will find your destination.
They have variety of seats including garden chairs and bean bags.They also have outdoor seating arrangements.This place has a Carrom board for time pass.Overall this is a proper 'Adda' place for friends over a cup of tea,coffee and snacks.

We Ordered :French Fries,Chicken Ham Sandwich,Cold Coffee and Chicken Platter.

The food quality was pretty nice.Food items were quite overpriced though.
The person serving us was really very polite and nice.
My overall experience was pleasant........

On one fine day my besti and i decided to have brownies from here. From college we visited that place. Its a bit difficult to locate that place. Map is needed to find it. As we entered we both felt that its more than a cafe;its like a home. Very well decorated. Both loved the ambience. We ordered chicken sandwich and brownie with chocolate sauce and ice cream.  The chicken sandwich was good. It was tasty. But mainly went for brownies. The brownies were awesome. The chocolate sauce with ice cream and chocochips made it so delicious. I will definately have this brownie whenever i come to this place. Will definately visit to try their platter and beverages.

This place has a really nice crowd. There are books you can read, crockeries, lanterns, etc. that you can buy, there is a carrom board too! Coming to the food : They serve thin crust pizzas. Not a fan of thin crust, so mixed reactions. Also not a great fan of sandwiches, though they serve good ones. What I am a fan of, is their desserts. They have cheesecakes, puddings, brownies which are absolutely delicious! I just wish they added some savoury snacks like chicken wings.

It was a Sat morning around 11 when we two decided to hop in for breakfast.This was our 2nd visit here.This place is more famous for its' ambience than for its' food.Once you enter into the place you get the exact look n' feel of the typical roadside Bong adda (thek in Bengali) or college canteen milieu.We two were their second customer. Carrom board is available for a full time pass and most importantly no rush at all.The menu is not much interesting with the usual sandwiches. We went for a baked chicken omelette, sheekh kebab sandwich and masala chai.
Baked Chicken Omelette: A little soggy,should have been a bit more baked,no complaints about the quantity of diced chicken added inside the omelette.
Sheekh Kebab Sandwich: Very tasty.Kebab was abundant.Enjoyed the sandwich most.
Masala Chai: Nice color n' flavour,exactly the one you need to get that morning kick.But not a slightest tinge of any masala flavour could be traced.
Overall experience: Look n' feel of the place will grow you nostalgic.Make the most of the ambience.Don't bet on their food,all the dishes might turn out awesome only if you are lucky!

This is the second time I went to this cafe. The first time I went for a Sunday morning gig, which turned out to be fantastic. This time I went with a group of friends for a heavy evening snack. We were a group of eleven people and the place already was pretty much packed up. Still the waiters managed to make arrangements for us, arranging tables, pulling chairs and bean bags, which was a sure shot plus point.

The decor is simple yet beautiful. A very cozy atmosphere created with low rise tables, chairs, stools and bean bags. On one side there is a book shelf with a lovely collection of books to be read or bought. There are a wide range of handicrafts for sale, starting from the hand printed outfits to the lamp shades and posters. All these items complete the decor of the place which is very tricky and smart.

The service was nice. The waiters had a very homely way to attend the guests; they are very jovial and smiling. The service however was quite slow. I might have given a consideration due to the holiday crowd, however I don't think it could ever take more than thirty minutes to grill some sausages and ham.

The food was lovely. We had ordered chicken cubes and sausage pizza from the Independence Day special menu. Apart from that we had ordered mixed chicken platter, mixed meat platter and coffee frappe from the regular menu.

The pizza was delicious. Crunchy thin crust with generous amount of meat and cheese, and the onions were perfectly caramelised. Both the meat platter and the chicken platter were heavenly and that too at such a low price. There were distinct difference in taste and texture between the chicken ham or sausage with that of the pork. The quantity was abundant and the taste was beyond words. The frappe too was great.

I would have given a 5, however a little deduction for the very high wait time

The sandwiches were absolutely yummy.
The french fries were nice. 😊👌
Just one little thing The taxes bring down the experience.
We had to pay almost ₹100 worth o taxes which is not very good for college students like us. :(

Abar Baithak is a cafe located slightly in the interior part of Jodhpur park and it used to be a regular hangout location for me. The food is mostly ordinary, you can cook them by yourself. However, their mocktails are really good, or at least those that I tried. I am a fan of their orange mojito. If you are feeling like having a drink, you should visit this place during any lazy afternoon. But I would not go with a hungry stomach in this cafe.

I have been following this place on Facebook before coming back to India because my pals were visiting regularly.
Abar Baithak is place to chill, great neighborhood, great coffee, tea, delicious fresh food and awesome people running this place. This is a regular hangout for me and my mobile office. The different attraction at this place is something to look for. Different sitting arrangements, library, play area, et all.
Something to notice at this place would be their ever smiling faces. Very attentive people at the workforce and very quick delivery.
Two of my friends @Swaralipi and @Shoumo running this awesome place for last few years and I wish them nothing but the best.

The cafè is much like a modern day baithak khana, as it appears from its name. A good place to hang out with your friends or carry out any important discussion.. it also comes with books to buy or for reading.. the good thing about this cafè  is it's environment.. its very homely and nicely decorated.. but the food is i think what it needs to be improved. Not all the items are bad. We have ordered for 2nd flush tea and orange pekoe.. unfortunately  both tasted the same. However the pudding and lassi was good. My suggestion  would b that visit the place if you are more concern to just hang out. But if you want good food i dont think it is the best choice to make.

Another trendy coffee shop in Jodhpur park. The cafe has a homey feeling with caram boards,bean bags,bookshelves full of poetry and other books ,wall art -a really cool place to hang. But the main problem is limited sitting inside,although there are seats outside.We went around 5.30ish n it was packed. The food seemed okay to me,not that good. We ordered the all meat chicken wrap and chicken platter. The quantity seemed less for the price. And we kinda had a feeling of having frozen chicken sausage n salami, being microwaved and served.

One fine rainy afternoon, I and my friend took darjeeling 2nd flush tea and a chicken platter and trust me guys it was amazing. A chicken platter in that price was unbeatable. Abar baithak is a perfect joint for bengali adda over a cup of darjeeling tea and carrom board with awesome collection of books and music CD'S. Their team's hospitality were unparallel and you will feel like home that's what is their USB .
A clear shot 4.5 star to this place...a must visit.

Went there this afternoon with friends, and I must say that the reviews I read beforehand were at least slightly misleading. Food is okay, although we didn't order many things at once. The bowl of non-veg fries were okay, though to be honest they were just fried up chicken nuggets and such, so not much credit can be given. French fries that came with it were not good. Iced tea was okay as well. We got a creme caramel of sorts which had honey over the top and tasted quite nice. We had planned to order more things as we were to stay for a long time, but we ended up leaving early. The reason would be the ambience. I simply do not get the idea of putting beanbags on a floor that doesn't even look clean. The carrom players nearly always kept bumping into my head. The place is overcrowded and stifling. Maybe they were going for quaint, but quite missed the charm that needs to be there. It just looked shabby and cluttered, waiters were kind of weird, Sherlock Holmes flex printouts are totally out of place, even the items on sale are dusty and the only reason I give any points is the food was not very bad. If I wanted to eat in such a place I would have raided my fridge and headed to the garage.

Well what not to like about this place..there is this warm and friendly ambience. Very welcoming. With books stacked up behind you on the shelf, the carrom board, the cushions, the paintings on the wall THE most perfect place for a Bengali confab. Honestly the place feels more like your living room than a restaurant...My happy place :)

Located inside jodhpur park the place is quiet spacious and very popular around the area. The decor is nice. On the one side they have displays of different books that you can buy and various art objects like vases. The food is good. Among the variety of tea they serve i like the earlgrey and moroccan mint. If you are a chocolate freak try out the cold chocolate. Among the sandwiches i prefer the chicken ham. If you want to spend time this is a very good place to hit. Cheers.

Been there twice and I'm loving this place. 
Best for an evening adda with your buddies or a random carrom match. This place impressed me. The food quality is also pretty nice. If you are scratching your head and trying to find a new place, well visit Abar Baithak. From the name to the decoration and to the food, really good. Must try : Chicken platter, My personal favourite there. 
Eat and be merry.
Cheers!

I like the ambience of the place. The Bengali books for sale on the racks, collection of CDs, little lamps for display, show pieces, Sherlock Holmes themed wall paintings , sofa and bean bags for sitting altogether made the place nice and cosy. There is a carom board and also outside sitting area.
Service is friendly though little slow. Most of the times the place remains packed with customers.
Sandwiches were nice. Baked chicken omelette was delicious. Teas and coffees with varieties of flavours were available. My choice was apple and hibiscus iced tea, it was flavoursome and very refreshing.
Will visit it with friends.

This place is extremely beautiful. You don't need to have posh decor and overtly big interiors to make cool cafe, you can keep it simple with great food. 
This place is little shabby,little ugly which is subtle and that gives a good dimension to the ambience. 
I've tasted their Chicken tortilla wrap which is the best wrap I've ever had in Kolkata. Price is pocket friends!
Highly recommended:)

Always been fond of such interiors and this place was in my wishlist since the very beginning. So today I dropped in there with a friend. We ordered the famous meat platter, tortilla chicken wrap, coffee and tea. The platter was okay but the potion I feel was not worth the price. The wrap was tasty. The staffs were friendly. My overall experience was pleasant. 
Next time I would definitely taste the freshly baked choco chip muffin. :D

Location:  Jodhpur park. Get down at the Lane just next to Jodhpur Park Petrol pump, you will find a Sugar and spice store. Now, enter that lane, take the first left, then take the first right and head straight, you'll be walking along the lake, keep walking straight until you find this cafe to your right.

I've been eyeing this place for a long time and reading such rave reviews, I decided to give it a try. I decided to visit this cafe on a Sunday evening . We had to wait for more than half and hour with several others outside the cafe for a seat.

Then finally we were allowed to enter and the first impression I had of the cafe is "chaotic". So so over crowded and rowdy. There is a carom board at one corner over occupied, people playing Uno, cheering loudly, shouting, laughing . A raucous party was going on it seemed.

The cafe has book shelves stuffed with books, but how can someone read a book and be at peace with oneself in such n environment? As i was starting to loathe the ambience , I hoped the food will save the day. It did not. 
You have to walk up to the counter,get the menu card yourself, Decide on the order and walk up to the counter again to place the order.Food ordered:
- 2 cappuccinos
- 1 iced peach tea
- 1 all meat platter
- 1 crab meat sandwich- 1 Affogato

the cappuccinos ca,e with sachets of brown and regular sugar and tasted nice.The iced peach tea sucked, Didn't like the taste at all (100 bucks down the drain)
The all meat platter:
cheese toast, chicken sausage, chicken salami, pork ham, pork bacon and a poached egg.

out of all these, the chicken sausage tasted the best. I am a huge pork lover and the condition of pork on this platter grossed me out, The bacon looked and tasted of bad quality. It was a disgrace to the family of bacon. Really disappointed.

The crab sandwich came in slices of 2 with a side of Lay's American flavour potato chips(the amount of 10 bucks pack) and a sachet of ketchup. The only positive about the sandwich was that the bread was grilled correctly. The crab meat stinks, definitely not fresh and I reckon they use frozen crab meat for the sandwich. Tasted muddy, not at all good.

Affogato- This one I liked. People who love dark unsweetened coffee will love this dessert. They served 3 small scoops of vanilla ice cream Drowned in generous amount of bitter espresso, topped with chocolate sauce, choco chips and wafers. I liked it. That's about it. People with sweet tooth might not like it.I also gave their red velvet cake a try. good but overpriced.

Verdict- Certainly not going back again. I have been to better cafes and tasted way better food and enjoyed way way better and quaint ambiences.

Nice and cosy.. Ideally to hang out with friends in a group but I found a cosy corner with my bestie in tow. Regarding the food.. Sumptuous and healthy..we ordered the chicken platter and cappuccino and both were really good. I would definitely look forward for many such evenings here at Abaar Baithak.

Last Sunday spent a lovely morning at the café due to a friend of my wife's who had a performance at the café. He is a part of the band Gangchil. 

Location: In Jodhpur Park Kolkata, near Jodhpur Park post office.Coming from Dhakuria flyover take the right from Jodhpur Park post office crossing and then go straight and then take the second left, then take immediate right you will find your destination. You can use Google maps also.

Décor: The ground floor of the house converted to a beautiful café joint. The front area is non air conditioned for smokers. Inside area is air conditioned. About total of 35 to 40 seater café. Beautiful wall painted with Sherlock Holmes' story graphics. Old comfortable sofas, mixed with bamboo stools, bean bags etc. One side full of books and music CDs you can buy. Very bright and colourful interior.

Food: Lovely different types of Darjeeling tea a must have. We ordered Orange Peco tea, cappuccino and 2nd flush. Had a non veg fry bowel it was nice. It had chicken nuggets, chicken pop corn, cheese nuggets and French fries. Food is good. They are known for their sandwiches and caramel custard.

Service: Is average can be improved .

Pocket pinch: With just some tea and snacks about 350+ for two persons. For proper breakfast about 600+ for two persons. A little bit on the high side.

Unique concept: Every Sunday they arrange for a cultural programme from 12 noon to 1 pm.  This really is a amazing concept. I really enjoyed my Sunday morning. Will definitely be back soon. Keep up the good work.

Abar Baithak... The name itself telling you that it's a place for regular "Addas"... So if I just go with the motto of the name, it does justice to that. Though I am not a regular customer of this cafe, still I visited the place quiet often.
Now the ambience is good, I don't know why people not liking it, but its good enough. Second of all, except the "sandwiches"  price rates others are quiet affordable. 
But people who are the regular customer of the place or so called OVERHYPED the place, they don't come here to have a full course meal, they come here to gossip alot, play some carom, read some book, and do some meetings with some snacks and coffees. So for that reason this is a place to visit for sure... And if you still feel it's overhyped, then....

Set amid the peaceful surroundings of Jodhpur Park, Abar Baithak is a lovely cafe to hang out with friends or by yourself. It's quite spacious, with both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. What makes the cafe as comfortable and warm as the drawing room in your house is the informal, casual ambience, complete with bean bags, carrom boards, tupperware bottles of water on the tables, book shelves, etc. The crowd is intellectual and creative here. You'll see college goers, film makers, actors, etc. hanging out here as though it were their home. The place has a charm of its own, but there's one aspect which makes an Abar Baithak experience more special - Shanti Da. This man is one of the servers, and is the go-to person for everyone. From taking group photographs to arranging chairs, from asking if the food is alright, to holding the door open, this man does it with a smile. Abar Baithak would probably be a great place even without him, but he adds that extra touch of warmth, and makes people feel welcome. 
Coming to the food and drinks here, it's definitely pocket friendly, and is a far better option than the big brands of cafeteria. Food quality and quantity are quite good, too. The only thing is that four experiments later, I feel that it's best to avoid unknown names here. I speak from my experiences with yogurt coffee which was quite horrible, Thai iced tea, for which I have no words, and lemon iced tea, which left a medicinal aftertaste in the mouth. Trying tried and tested recipes like frappe is a safer bet. I tried the mixed meat platter, which was simple, delicious and filling, though a piece or two more of bread would make@ it better. Sandwiches are good, too. You can also buy books and decorative items here. A homely hangout, pocket-friendly food and drinks, and a smiling face - what more do you need?

The hype pulled me there with my friends. Located in a posh lane of jodhpur park, this place is really cozy to have a nice adda. The decor and the ambience is pleasant. We tried the chicken platter, chicken salami sandwich, cold coffee, virgin mojito and cappuccino. The food was tasty except for the "Dobos Torte" which was explained as mango cheesecake but later on we discovered it was just a mango flavored mousse which wasn't worth the price. Otherwise cool place to hangout.

The place is cosy although I did not really find any 'bangaliyana' ambience in there. The all meat platter is still edible but the ham and pork baked omlette was a total waste of money. Although the beverages are quite nice. The books only look gorgeous and come with a tag of 'only for sale'. -_-
I loved the brownie with hot chocolate and ice-cream. That was really appreciatable. The place is just not worth the hype.

The books are only decorated to give the look of “bengalee addakhana”. Foods are overpriced. It is no doubt a favourite place for the people belonging to the pseudo-intellectual society of Kolkata. ‘Bangaliyana’ is not inherited to them, rather a sophistication in their imitative non-bengali culture.

This is such an overhyped place and I was genuinely disappointed.
It's clumsy and just lacks the peacefulness that a café ought to have.Their name has baithak in it but this is not where I want to give adda in.The food is fine. I didn't even feel keen on clicking pictures.
But I should really talk about the ambience.
They literally make separate customers sit jn the same table if they run out of space.
They don't have the basic decency before asking the people who are seated there if they are ok with it.
And the waiters will just push you to finish your meal fast and leave so that the waiting customers can sit.
OVERHYPED PLACE.

The ambience? Wonderful. 
The food? Okay. 
This cafe has the feel of a typical bengali house with a HUUUUGE book shelf, a carrom board and lots of space to give adda in!
There's a separate smoking area where the carrom board is present and the inner area is air - conditioned.
The bean bags are extremely comfy and you could just sit there all day if you like( I actually don't think they'd mind that!). The ambience is very casual and easy - going and you can give adda,work on your laptop or simply sit there reading a book for as long as you like. They have both bean bags and proper chairs for sitting. 
The food variety is limited with a few sandwiches,tortillas,salads,fries and platters. However, they do have an assortment of drinks,including mocktails, tea and coffee.

We tried their cold coffee, ice tea, virgin mohito, French kiss and the standard chicken platter. The food was decent but the usp of this place remains it's ambience!
They also have handmade chocolates..one of which caught my attention because-- a) it was made of white chocolate
B) it was in the shape of Taj Mahal! 
But who'd have the heart to break a taj mahal made of white chocolate! I know I didnt! :p

I had heard a lot about this place but it did not quite live up to my expectations. I had a chocolate sandwich and a chicken platter, none of which were above average. The cold coffee was quite nice though. 
I don't know why the books they had were meant for sale only. I would love a cafe which would allow me to pick up and read stuff instead. 
In my opinion, this place, especially its ambience is better suited for college goers and the youth in their early to mid-twenties in general. The energy and vibe is such that it would attract college kids, not thirty somethings like me :)

The bean bags and the carrom board makes the place even more interesting. For smoking there's outdoor seating too. We ordered Chicken tortilla wrap, virgin mojito and caramel custard. The tortilla wrap was pretty nicely made. Virgin mojito was amazing and so was the Caramel custard though they shouldn't give honey on top of it instead of caramel sauce. The staffs were really nice and polite and the service was good too. Overall nice experience. :)

This cafe draws it's ambience from traditional bengali themes and baul music in the background. Their all star breakfast platter left me full and satisfied, and the plate licked clean. Extra points go to the amazing peanut butter banana money shake with a topping of brittle for being refreshing as well as unusual. A very pleasant surprise!

Great expectations !!!! But it took 5 mins to burst the balloon 😡 as we entered the ac zone a waiter suggested a table which was yet to be cleaned. There were 4 flies over the  plate with leftover food and torn tomato sauce sachet . The floor was filled with dirt and total chaos reigned inside with loud f.m. playing and sounds of carrom all around . The kind waiter never returned back and we also never sat on the "ento" table . You need a serene atmosphere to relish 2nd flush 1st tip as the menu suggests. Thoroughly disgusted. One is for the petrol that we spent in finding out the joint.

Cafeterias carved out of an.old house is always a welcome idea especially if it has a bookshop and has indoor games like carrom and.chess. well, this eatery in.jodhpur park,kolkata has all of that . I went there on a sultry,cloudy evening last week with a v.young colleague who suggested me this place. We sat comfortably and placed an order after a consultation with the beautiful owner swaralipi who was an actress in bengali serials and was part of reality shows. She suggested us the cold chocolate with ham and bacon omelettes and chocolate brownies... we also had sandwiches ... a special mention for the omelette as I have never had such a soft, tender ham and bacon omelette before,the shake was excellent and the sandwiches were good too... the brownies were sweet without being overtly so... missed to buy a few books which I would on my.next visit... a must go to place..:-)

But was very much disappointed at the first experience. The food stinks. They give u cold coffee and charge rs 80. Even coffee from the stalls of jodhpur park taste much better than that. Also, the behaviour of the staffs is way too bad. It's like, they are disinterested in their customers. Will recommend frndz never to visit this place.

I have been hearing about his place for quite sometime, I have noticed the hype of this place recently. One day I was just happening to pass by this place when we decided to drop by.as we entered , we were really excited to try the food. this place was well decorated, had board games and also had books for sale. Paradise for people like me!But now comes the plot twist, THE TERRIBLY OVERPRICED BAD FOOD!we were hungry since we skipped breakfast , we ordered a chicken platter and all meat platter. Firstly, why would I want to eat frozen sausages and salamis at a cafe? I expected fresh food. I have been having frozen food at home since years and Ive never had them just out of the fridge. Not even thawed properly , forget about them being slightly fried or grilled. I had to suffer food poisoning. thank you!secondly, they provide with a meager amount of tartar sauce and then they charge 30 rupees for a refill. I have never been to place managed by such money hungry people. thirdly , they serve you "pati kasundi" in the name of mustard sauce. when you are an opening a cafe, a little knowledge about what you serve is needed.Hope you start serving fresh food and dont fool people.
Happy eating ! :)

Here actually people visit to just spend leisure time with adda. They take a cup of coffee and stay for hours. That is why to run the business 'abar baithak' has kept the prices prity high considering the food and all so that if anyone stays for long after having only a cup of coffee, that will not hurt. It's a place for the so called intellectuals. 

Chicken platter costs more than 160. It offers nothing. At max one should pay half the price.

One thing 'abar baithak' can do is take some entry fee and let people have adda, and reduce the costs of food largely. It's a park, not a restaurant. Why in zomato?

Has chairs, sofas, and bean bag seating.. board games are available too..if you want you can avail outdoor seating as well. My all time favourite is the green apple mojito, and all meat tortilla wrap. Nevertheless Mexican hot chocolate, all meat platter, watermelon ice tea, mushroom and corn sandwich are splendid. You can never go here and not alhave a great time. P.s. the caramel custard here is awesome. 😍

All my friends had visited this place and I was the only one who had not. I was almost scared if society would accept me if I did not visit soon. Everyone who heard I have not been here yet, had an astoundingly shocked expression "Akhono Jashniii?" Well I made the visit finally. 

Dropped in with a couple of friends. To be honest, the food is good but is nothing that deserves being hyped. The ambiance on the other hand is a total different story. This is a place you come with your friends, gather around the carom board with, or settle upon the cozy bean bags and submerge yourself in an undying session of adda. The interiors are minimal, yet speak so much of the Bengali culture. The books, the show pieces, the little lamps on display, everything contribute in making the ambiance so much more casual and welcoming. It almost feels like, you have dropped by a friend's place.

Coming to the food-

We ordered watermelon iced tea, cold coffee, and fresh lime soda. All the beverages were thoroughly enjoyed. I especially loooooved the watermelon iced tea. We moved forward and ordered the Grilled Fish Sandwich (listed under Baithak's Special Sandwish), one chicken platter, one all meat platter, a chicken tortilla wrap and finally brownie with hot chocolate and ice cream.

The platters were absolutely brilliant, I especially loved the chicken sausages, they are stuffed with a fine line of cheese and is absolutely delectable. I could visit this place just for the Chicken Platter alone. While the tortilla chicken wrap was average the Grilled fish sandwich was a total disappointment. I hardly found any flavor in it, and definitely did not find anything special about it either. 

The desert did not help in anyway to lift our spirits that were brought down by the grilled fish sandwich. The brownie was sadly hard and crumbly, I had to stab it twice to get it on the spoon. Very disappointed with the desert. 

All the praises from the people around me, lead me to believe that I might have dropped in on a wrong day. But, If I visit again, it will be solely for the chicken platter and the iced teas. They are super delicious.

Situated in a very residential area of Jodhpur Park , this garage turned-cafe is an ultimate Bengali aantel sampraday adda khana. Though the bean bags didnt look comfortable enough, they had chairs aswell. Went there with my regular hangout buddies tonight. It's has a wide collection of Bengali literature books n decor items which are only for sale. In foods they have a vivid variety of sandwiches, cocktails,tea n other drinks. We ordered both the meat n chicken platter along with a grilled fish sandwich, fish fingers n some drinks. All the food items n drinks were delicious except for the cold coffee. It was 80% froth and totally tasteless.nevertheless the Morocan mint tea was really nice n refreshing. The service was a bit slow but the perfect ambience for after-office-adda makes up for it. Might visit it again if I am in the locality.

The first of its kind in Kolkata . This cafe has a cozy homely feel to it . This place was perfect for us as we met for a college group reunion after 2years . 
The owner was pretty friendly . The long apur sangsar portrait is a lovely thing to hang on the wall. 
The food was very tasty. Their tea variety and taste is pretty good . I just loved the pudding . It had a homemade feel to it .

Abar Baithak is our second home. I don't know where to start. The mocktails are very refreshing. Everyone should try their innovative sandwiches. To satisfy your tummy you must have the mixed meat platter. And of course the mouthwatering deserts. The innovative cakes. I don't know where to stop. It is the coolest cafe in South Kolkata.

ABAR  BAITHAK – A perfect place to have Baithak. A great place to hang out with friends. 

Location
`````````````````
It is located in the by lane crossing the jodhpur park lake road.  A short walking distance from Raja Subodh Mallick Road. It is a residential area  and hence the place is quiet and calm 

Ambience
````````````````````
As written by other reviewers, It is an old house of which the ground floor is turned into a coffee shop. The interiors are decorated with book shelves having a pretty good collection of books .This place also has sofa and bean bags to add to your comfort. It offers both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Outdoor seating arrangement is for those who want to smoke along with some food. But we preferred the indoor one ,thanks to hot summer season. 

Staff and Service
```````````````````````````````````
Well, the concept here is like most other cafes in the city that you need to order your food at the counter and they will provide you a nicely cut wooden square box bearing the table number and the food will come to your table once its ready. I found the staffs polite and courteous .They even help you choose your food and drink. Service was also prompt. 

Food
``````````
We ordered the following : 
(i)   Orange Mojito
(ii)  All Meat Platter 
(iii) Chicken Salad
(iv) Chicken Ham Sandwich
(v)  Chicken tortilla Wrap

The first one to be served was the orange mojito in big beer glasses. Its a very refreshing drink taking out all the tiredness of the day. It consists of mint leaves and orange peel that brings out a truly tasty and fresh drink to add to your palate. Next to come was the All meat platter. It had Cheese toast, Chicken Sausage ,Chicken Salami, Pork Ham, Pork Bacon and Egg Poach served with the tasty Mayonnaise Sauce. All the items were perfectly cooked and tasted excellent. Chicken Salad comprised tender pieces of chicken in cabbage leaves with black olives dressed faultlessly with mayonnaise sauce , capsicum pieces and honey. A perfect continental salad in short. :) Chicken Ham Sandwich also tasted great with pieces of chicken in almost every bite. So is the tortilla wrap. The bread used for the tortilla wrap was soft and tender .Chicken slices were juicy and succulent and teamed impeccably with the wrap.    

Overall a great experience. Would like to visit again . 

Ambience 4.5/5
Staff-4/5
Service-4/5
Food-4.5/5
Value for money - 4/5
Must try – Meat Platter if you love Continental foods and Orange Mojito . 

Recommended for all adda lovers .As they say "fusion of a modern cafe with a bengali adda" .  :)

Pocket Pinch : Rs 700 for two ..

A perfect place to hangout and chitchat on a windy evening.. firstly the ambience is class apart. The cute bean bags ,the books ,the people everything is just too classy and too comfortable. Now the food.. the chicken platter is filling and yummy. Comes with sausages and salamis.. well cooked and fantastic to taste. The chocolate cigar tea is my one of the favourites. Its a special mention along with the chocolate sandwitch and the chicken salami sandwithch. I love this place mostly for its ambience though.

It has been quite a while that I've visited this place and I found it very cozy and comfy place. My main attractions here are their ham and bacon Omlet and that Carrom Board!! It's a great place to catch up with old friends over a cup of darjeeling tea and a bowl of fries. Or else you could just chill on a bean bag, enjoying a novel from their library while sipping mochaccino. Moreover it has such a homely feel that will make visit again.

The sitting area also grt having bean bags and all. well coming to the food, ordered a chicken platter, didn't like it much, a raw smell was coming from the sausages. Couldn't try something else, as I was in a little hurry. Will hangout another day and try something new. Thumbs up.

Abar Baithak is a Interior deco wise average cafe, but ambiance is excellent. It's like a college common room with attached canteen n library. There displayed all type of  "DOKRA" Ornament. Both outdoor n indoor seating arrangement are available. We enjoyed our AADAA for long time .The Staffs are well mannered. The croom board is special attraction in this cafe. It's a pocket friendly restaurant....

Went there recently with friends, and found it quite near to my place. The outside was non-ac but there was ac inside. Beautiful ambience and nicely decorated place it is. We ordered virgin mojitos,cold coffee,french fries and a veg bowl. I somehow felt that the mojito was better than the coffee. They also had a carrom board so we played. Price were ok, but the taxes doesn't male it that pocket friendly. Anyways, i liked the place.

Located in Jodhpur Park this place doesn't have the fresh new look. The charm is in their simplicity. It has a look of someone's living room that has seen better days. Since the AC was not working we had to do with a pedestal fan. The food here is good but a little pricey. Liked the desserts better.  
Found their idea of lining the wall with book shelves quite innovative. One can also buy books & CDs here.

We had ordered All meat platter, chicken omelette, cold chocolate, affogato and brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. My favourite dish was the affogato.

We came here for an evening session of adda and some tea. Located in Jodhpur Park, this place isn't tough to find, contrary to what most people would think. Just take the first right after crossing Dakshinapan (if you're coming from Gariahat) and once you enter Jodhpur Park Jeep going straight up to  Bablu Sweets, a famous confectionary. From there turn left and then take the left right after that (you'll cross Malati Sweets just before reaching Abar Baithak). It's really easy, much easier than it sounds. 
The two of us ended up ordering 1 honey lemon tea, 1 cold coffee, 1 veg and 1 chicken salad. The tea was above average, the coffee was excellent. The chicken salad was good too, however the veg salad lacked punch. It had lettuce, corn, onion, capsicum, olive and mayonnaise, but wasn't innovative at all. It was the most basic salad ever. I expected a place like this to push boundaries further in terms of experimentation with food nutrients and ingredients! Overall, we paid 400 INR for 2 people and left decently satisfied. The ambience is very Bong (it's a good thing in this case) with people just plinking themselves on cushions, playing carrom, reading books, watching TV or smoking away their worries. It's just like what an average Bong living room would be, with books strewn around. There are books, bags, household knicn-knacks and even clothes on sale. This place makes for a great adda venue on weekday evenings .

Very good place for student hangout. You can play a lot of games like chess, carrom, Rubik's cube before your order arrives. Now as far as the cuisine is concerned I would like to recommend to order chicken or meat platter, sandwiches along with any beverage. This is also a very good place for book lover. You can read story books while having foods.

Abar Baithak is in my wishlist from last 2-3 months so I finally decided to go there today. 

*Location*
Location wise it is in the by lane of small lake near jodhpur park. 5 mins walking distance from Jodhpur park girls high school.

*Deco,Ambiance and Seating*
Its an old house's ground floor Hall decorated with book shelf and painting, seating arrangements was divided between outside and inside. There was sofa, chairs and also bean bags. Place was crowded with teeagers and college goers.

*Food & Services*
If you familiar with ccd then this outlet can provide that kind of treatment. After ordering they will give you table no like ccd and you have to pay the whole amount at the last nefore leaving. 

Tax will charged extra near 20.5%

We ordered chicken platter, all meat platter, mango cheesecake, peach iced tea, spicy mexican hot chocolate.

They first served the chicken platter which contained one poached egg, 2pc chicken sausage, 4 pcs chicken salami, 1pc cheese toast and 2 pcs of chicken ham.

Taste were good, I liked the sausage specially. 

I completed the chicken platter and waited for 15 mins and came to know that they forgot to take our all meat platter order.. I wasso disappointed hearing that. 

So I  waited another 12 mins foe All meat platter and finally they gave us. Difference between all meat platter and chicken platter are all meat platter contains bacon, pork ham instead of chicken ham. Rest all same.. 

Again I went 3 times for enquiring my two drinks and cake.. service was just pathetic even though staff were funny and friendly. 

Peached iced tea was average but I liked the spicy hot chocolate. 

Mango cheesecake was just fabulous. I liked that so much.. For that cake and hot chocolate and pricing I'm considering it 4/5 otherwise It was given 3.5 by me.

Been to a lot of café's in Kolkata but this place continues to be my favourite. Not only the menu is refreshingly unique but also the varieties of tea and coffee taste like bits of joy. It is a perfect place to hang out with friends with a comfy and homely ambiance,bean bags, carom board, scrabble, great range of books, you have it all. Had my all time favourite berrychino while my friend had the honey ginger tea. The all meat platter here is a must try!

Looks like The Indian Coffee House doesn't have a monopoly anymore for providing a place for having coffee, smoking and the ADDA. It's the usp of bangalis. This is a coffee shop at jodhpur park and I feel it has got every right to be proud of itself. The decor is beautiful and it will make you feel nostalgic. You have small tables, bean bags, carrom boards and music playing away. There are shelves stacked with books (only for sale, though) and you can quietly snuggle to a corner with a steaming cup of coffee and a book in hand. Then the food. I have to say I was quite surprised when I found out that the food was pretty cheap and tasty as well. You try anything on their menu and you just can't be disappointed. Already visited this place twice and will be visiting it again and again! :)

Located in the lanes of jodhpur park is this lively cafe.... an amazing place to hang out with friends for that perfect adda... nothing much to say about this energetic cafe... the decor is decent and eye catching with a variety of books inside the cafe.... there are also some amazing paintings at the side in a wall...
Now coming to the food.... really pocket friendly and the best part about this cafe is they always serve freshly prepared foods..
I tasted their sandwiches and lately i tasted their chicken salad.. well, it was just amazing... the quantity was very nice.. and the fresh and juicy chicken just made it awesome...
Apart from that we ordered their rock and roll cappuccino which was quite interesting... the zesty lemon on the coffee made it so innovative yet tasty...
We also ordered their brownie with ice cream.. which was also yum. Really impressed with this cafe for its amazing food quality and service.... surely visiting this cafe again .. :)

Finally I have found the perfect hangout place I was looking for. The cafe is tucked in a small corner in in Jodhpur Park area. Very homely and laid back ambiance. I particularly like the high ceiling structure. There is a huge book shelf with variety of books which at first I thought were for reading. But later found written 'for sale only'. I wish it was for reading. There are lots of artifacts displayed which you can purchase. A carom board at the corner adds to the mood. They have both indoor and a small outdoor seating arrangement. 

Food - We had ordered Chicken sausage platter consisting of chicken sausages, salami, ham, cheese bread and poached egg. I really like the food as it was very less oily and light, just the way I had wanted it to be. The cold coffee served in beer mug was rich and strong in flavour. We ended with their Saturday special Red velvet cheese cake which was heavenly and is a must try. 

Service- Very prompt and polite. The person serving was very well behaved and talked to us about their food and activities

Pocket Pinch - Quite reasonable. 

They arrange for various cultural activities every Sunday. One can inform them ahead in case one wants to perform there. Will surely visit there frequently now.

It's been quite sometime that I bookmarked this place but unfortunately took too long to land up. While going we took the way that's bang opposite to south city mall. The lane beside leather world to be precise. But while returning we took the other way which is via Selimpur and that's easier I ll suggest.

I liked the lighting, sitting arrangements, drinks and ambience out here. By the name of the place one can figure out it's Bengali features. We opted for cold coffee, lemon ice tea, lassi and two other drinks. I tasted all of them and all were good. None of the drinks costed more than 100/-. 

The cafe is full of people so finding a table vacant might be difficult. The place has both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. The AC doesn't work well in  the indoors. Finding a cafe in residential area isn't all that easy.

Visit at your own risk!😂

Food ordered:

2) Cafe Frappe
3) Grilled Chicken Ham Sandwich
4) Chicken Tortilla Wrap
5) Afoggato
The food was extremely average. The decoration is very normal. But the way it is lit up is nice. The iced mocha was really nice but it wasn't cold. The frappe was just okay. The tortilla wrap wasn't good at all. It had Chinese flavoured chicken.   The only thing which I loved the most was the desert: Afoggato. It was lovely. A must try for all. This is their speciality. 
Pocket pinch: ₹722/- (with taxes)

Abar Baithak - Abar Boshbo na. 
=====
Intro + Location: I had been to Abar Baithak yesterday with couple of my friend's to try their coffee house. It is like an old house converted into a coffee shop. They have got a carrom board, quite a few books to sell and other selling items. The height of the place is really good and it offers both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Outdoor seating arrangement is for those who want to smoke and enjoy some leisure time. Nevertheless, when i entered inside, it was quite hot as their A.C. was not working properly. The walls of the room had cracks showing that not much of care is taken with respect to repairs. Almost all age groups of people come here to chill. That's what i observed when i went here to chill for the first time. 

About the location, it is inside residential area of jodhpur park. We were group of three walking here so can't describe the exact location of this place. 
=====
What we ordered:-

• 3 Cold Coffee's - The coffee was good on quantity and nice and strong. Liked it.  ✌  ✌ 

• Non Veg Bowl - Non veg bowl had comprised of French Fries, Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Popcorn and Cheese Balls. All of them seemed McCain products to me. I had specifically asked the guy in the counter whether it's McCain or not. But, he  said it's prepared in Abar Baithak. They had sprinkled some salt on it which was really not required. They tasted the usual McCain products. I really appreciate on creativity and it was more like serve ready to eat packet. Disappointed. 
=====
Meal for two: 400-700 max
=====
Pros:

• Concept altogether is good.
• Offers both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement.
• Has carrom to play or books to read to spend time. 
• It feels like home. It really does.

Cons:

• I was not at all impressed with the food offered. McCain products even i can fry at home. 
• The walls are bit broken. Efforts should be there to fix it. 
• The person at the counter should help us with the dishes to order and not act so reluctant. 
=====
Summary: 

Food Quality 3.2/5
Food Quantity 3.2/5
Food Presentation 2.8/5
Hospitality 3.2/5
Ambiance 3.3/5 (it's like home converted into coffee shop)
Value for money 3/5 
=====
Conclusion:

It's a good place for people who want to sit here for long hours and chat. It's a calm place altogether. However, my reason of not coming back shall be solely because of the food. I might not visit this place again.
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

An informal cafe in true blue Bong style-carromboard, books n mags for reading, good Bengali books for sale, bean bags n sofas to lounge, smoking n nonsmoking zones-what more do u want?The coffee options r variable, highly recommended is the yummy rock n roll hot coffee. The quality of tea is good n we enjoyed the chilled earl tea. For food, I would suggest the healthy tortilla wraps. Both the chicken n veg options r sumptuous. The yummy baked omelette is a meal in itself; don't order any other dish with it. For dessert, order affogato, but share it, it's too much for one person! It combines cofee, icecream n brownies. There r paintings, artifacts n handloom weaves for sale too. I bought a wonderful notebook set with Bengali seasonal pics n calendar. Moreover, this is a good place to work, with its free Wi-Fi n points to plug in ur laptop. We actually worked on an academic paper here! Noone will ask u to hurry up or leave. Visit it during afternoon as the indoor a.c. zone gets crowded in the evening. Would visit it again. I would recommend some roadsigns guiding one from jodhpur park bustop as it is difficult to find the cafe.

Located at Jodhpur Park, this is a tiny cafe made out of garage under a residential house. It is pretty uniquely decorated and has tons of board games. From the name one can figure out this has a very BENGALI backdrop. It's like a place where you can go with your friends and chill with a cup of tea or so. All that is on point. However the food needs serious attention. The staff is extremely well mannered and serves with a smile on their face, so that's a bonus. The one thing thing that stood out in the menu is the all day breakfast. It was easy on the pocket, filling and tasty. :)

It's right next to the Jodhpur park boys' school.
At the first glance I fell in love with the cafe...they have outdoor seating arrangements.
But as we hopped inside..the place was so good...a complete Bengali baithak ambience making the name perfectly apt for the place :)
They have a collection of great books.
I tried their fresh lime soda, chicken ham sandwich, chicken platter, choco brownie.
Portions were good!
I loved their chicken platter ( included two sausages, pork ham, chicken ham, poached egg)
Which I loved most is their drinks!
They serve every drinks in big beer glasses and they are cheap!
Pocket pinch is on the lesser side.
So; GOOD BOOKS, GOOD AMBIENCE, GOOD FOOD!
What else do you want?
Sure I'm coming back to this den!
Highly recommended :)

Coffee shops are growing in each and every corner and every outlet has to offer something new and unique to survive. This one sure does.
Heard a lot about this place and finally was able to visit it recently.
It's difficult to locate as it's situated a bit far frm Jodhpur park. The interiors are well done, long range of books to offer (only for buying), beverages are also good which comes in beer glasses, unique tokens for orders, food also good, bean bag chairs for long adda sessions, everything.
What comes straight in mind that Abar Baithak is a hangout place with loud choruses, noisy carrom sounds people needs to talk loudly just to reach to their friends. We also have college canteens for that. It is not a coffee shop where you can go deep in talking and reading without any noisy disturbance.  Adda zone is okay, the non-ac section serves that part. But, inside it's too loud. I liked the former one. That was a quite a nice coffee shop. Overall experience, good but not awsome.

Nice comfy place to just sit back and relax with friends... The place is always pretty much filled up... And on weekends just sitting back & relaxing isn't possible over here.. As soon as you're done with your order you need to leave your place to make room for the next bunch of people waiting outside :/ nevertheless a nice concept, nice food, ambience... Feel-good place :)

If you need lyadh, adda, chaos over playing carrom, 'heartbreaks' from receiving the +4 wild card from your friend while playing uno AND good food then, this is the place. :D
After hearing a lot about Abar Baithak, finally I was successful in taking my lyadh loving group to this coffee shop. We found it a bit difficult to locate it though. I was more than happy to see the wide range of collection of books they have for sale. They have quirky paintings on display for sale too. We were 5 people. We settled on the cozy chairs and started playing uno. Later on we moved on to the bean bags and were parked there for a good 4 hours. :P
Now, the food. We had :
1.Cold coffee : served in beer glasses. Tasty.
2. French Kiss : not a fan of mocktails, but this one was nice.
3. Ice mocha : The best cooler I have ever had.
4. The special chicken platter : The sausages were way too tasty.
5. Ham and Bacon Salad : Could have been better.
6. Ham and Bacon Baked Omlette: Filled with ham and bacon. It definitely did justice to the 150 bucks which I had to pay for it.
7.  Brownie with ice cream.
The best thing about Abar Baithak would be the ambiance they give us to have a 'baithak'. The good food is just an add on. ;)

Had heard a lot about this joint, and finally got the chance to tick it off my checklist. One mentionable feature is its college-canteen-ambience- with books to read and a number of handy games, this is truly a new Coffee House for the the youth. There is a also separate non-AC place outside for smoking. But the AC could have been stronger, given the heat wave going on in the city. Also, you have to go to the counter yourself to place the order or pay the bill, which is a bit tiresome.
Now coming to the food, we ordered the chicken platter, a fresh lime soda and a cappuccino. The platter was good- the chicken sausages being the best I've had in a while. Though the ham and poached egg were quite bland. The lime soda was kinda okayish, nothing too great. And the coffee was pretty nice. The bill was around 350, so quite economical for college goers. This place is a must try for the students.

Coffee House was of the past. New cafes are popping up in Kolkata at almost every corner, trying to align themselves with the changing tastes of Bengalis. But what most of them lack is the traditional Bangaliana in the attempt to modernise. Abar Baithak is a refreshing change from those typical cafes.

It's located in one of the by-planes of Jodhpur Park, a little away from the Jodhpur Park Boys' School. And it's surprising how the relatively empty lane leads to a place hustling and bustling with people of all ages, though mostly youngsters, either stirring their coffee or having a smoke outside. Oh, and wait. What you fail to notice from outside is a part of a Bengali house with people trying to pocket the red carrom 'guti', and shelves full of old classics, and modern day writers, ranging from Sunil Gangopadhyay to Agatha Christie. The only sad part is, they are up only for sale! And not to forget the paintings on the walls and the bean bags that make you feel at home. It's a small place, and mostly overcrowded with people (It was full even around 4.30 in the afternoon), so getting privacy is difficult, although you're bound to have a gala time if you're visiting with friends.

Coming to the food, they do not have much to offer, except beverages, sandwiches, fries and wraps. I went for 
1. A Raspberry Iced Tea, and 
2. Tortila Wraps with All Meat. 

The former was quite rejuvenating, given the outside temperature in Kolkata in summer. The latter was indeed a delight for meat-lovers with Hams, Bacons and Chicken deliciously mixing with each other. Some more varieties could help, though, and the price could have a little lower (Prices are exclusive of taxes.)

Overall, if you're looking for a place to hangout and have a nice adda over coffee, this place is for you!

This cafe is located just 5 minutes from my place. Have been to there so many times. The place is very well maintained. It has a small library, a carrom board and so many cartoon pictures in the wall related Bengali tradition. In this cafe you can seat inside in ac zone and you can also seat outside if you want to smoke. Whenever I goes there I play carrom as it is one of my favourite games. The service is not that quick but the staffs are well behaved. I've tried most of their items and beverages. Few of my favourites are grilled fish sandwich, chicken ham sandwich, chicken platter and watermelon iced tea.

The cafe's value proposition of enabling its customers to have a good time with friends and family over a cup of coffee or mocktail or sandwiches is largely met given the welcoming ambience. The cafe has the traditional Bengali look and the layout gives the impression of a nice adda place with the bean bags, carrom boards, books for sale as well as for reading, etc. Visited the place yesterday and felt that the food is quite good and quite filling but the cold coffee was a  disappointment.

Abar Baithak is this one little place at Jodhpur Park. It's a small, busy and almost congested Bengali café. The food here is simple and average. Nothing fancy. The wall decor however is pretty nice. Food here is VERY CHEAP. A good ol' place to hang out with your friends if you're wanting to catch up your daily adda.

Though I've only been there once, it was a pleasant experience overall. The ambience is nice and allows a group of friends to simply hang out and enjoy. The games add to the fun quotient too as do the shelves of books which one can purchase for a nominal amount if desired. The food and drinks are good as well as pocket-friendly. The service is decent. It is definitely one place that's worth a second visit and more!

If you are looking for a place to sit and have adda over a cup of coffee or tea, this is one appropriate place to go. Located in the bylanes of jodhpur park, this place is situated in a calm locality. They have both inside and outside sitting arrangements. And you can even have a carrom match or just sita nd talk. Now coming to the food, we ordered caffe frappe, chicken platter and chicken sandwhich. Cafe frappe was very good. But the food was below average. It can be a lot better.

This cafe is tucked in a small corner of jodhpur park. But once you reach this place you will see that it's bustling with people of all ages. We had cold coffee, lemon iced tea, french fries, chicken sandwich. Well the cold coffee and iced tea were amazing, they served them in big beer glasses. The french fries n sandwich were good, but not great. This place is reasonable and mainly a hub for college goers.

What links Washington, Kolkata and Mexico City? In all modesty, me – in Abar Baithak. I was in Kolkata unusually long, three weeks, because I was recuperating from horrific car accident just days earlier in Washington, where I live. Living in Jodhpur Park, I stepped out to explore the area and stepped into Baithak. I loved the coffee and I loved the ambience. So I visited again, asked for coffee and lingered. I am glad I did, for in came my friends from Mexico City, Saurav and Ishita, who had been my hosts in Mexico a few months back and were now visiting Kolkata. Baithak had done it: given me good coffee, stable wi-fi, congenial company and even unexpected overseas friends. What more could I ask?    Manish Nandy nandy.org

People say, Kolkata is a city with a soul, a city where people love to laze about, with tea, and ponder over ideas, or have a stormful session of adda on sports, politics, and anything. And this cafe Abar Baithak beautifully lives up to Kolkata's image as a city of culture. As you walk inside this cafe you'll see the quintessential characteristics of a Bengali house: bookshelves filled with books, handicrafts, artworks, paintings, and a carrom board! You not only get chairs, but bean bags as well to make it feel like a real baithakkhnana, albeit a very modern one. Outside of the main area, there's a smoking zone with a couple of tables. The idea of this cafe is overwhelming.

The menu is neat, with a wide number of items at affordable prices. We had Virgin Mojito, Rock & Roll Cappuccino, Chicken Seekh Kebab Sandwich, Fish Fingers, Chicken Tortilla Wraps, and Chicken Platter. Apart from the regular menu, they also have lots of sweet delicacies like chocolates, cakes, pastries. 

The foods ranged from decent to wonderful. I loved the small chocolate ball, and their Rock & Roll Cappuccino, with a thick layer of cream on top. The Virgin Mojito was a bit bland, and the Chicken Platter was okay. The Chicken Tortilla Wraps and the Seekh Kebab Sandwich were quite good though. The staffs are helpful, and get a little confused when the crowd increases. Serving time is a bit high. Prices are inclusive of taxes.

Overall this is a wonderful cafe, a perfect place to visit with your friends, have foods, laze, and create great memories. Kudos to the owners for the nice concept.

I am on an eternal search for cafes . .just a place to sit,chat,relax . .have good food.
This was my new found place,quite near to college but really a long way off from the main road.
The place seems quite popular,it was so filled with people. We could not even find place inside to sit and had to wait a while.
What surprised me was that the place was almost equally filled with college goers and gangs of friends in their 60s.
The place has only waiter and the service was horrible. We had to call for a table twice and an extra chair thrice.  .after which we had to get up ourselves. Its a self service place and you need to order at the counter.
The counter cabinets are filled with cakes and pastries that at least look gorgeous.
The place is filled with books that you can buy and paintings too.
Its has both chairs and tired looking dusty beanbags.
We ordered cold coffees and fish finger and French fries and all were OK. .nothing great.
Would not recommend the place

Baithak, the concept of an open adda, so integral to Bengali life, is attempted to be brought back, with the laid back ambience, wickerwork chairs and shelves stacked with books...the essential ingredients of a Bengali 'Baithak-khana'. Firstly, kudos to Abar Baithak to attempt to bring back the feel of a lazy adda, sans the suffocating smoke of cigarettes that pervades the interiors of Coffee House, the 'Mecca' of adda in the Bengali consciousness. I loved the vibrant ambience, after I settled down to the sounds and conversation all around. Abar Baithak is not the place for a quiet (or even a romantic) evening, it is where you can sit down with your coffee and let the conversation flow. We ordered the Crab Meat Sandwich, which was different, the minced crab makes its presence felt even through the overload of vegetables! The Fish Fingers, which I believe is essential to nearly every adda worth its while (like Fish fry!) were also bang on in terms of taste and flavour, however, I felt that for Rs 150, five pieces to a plate, and the medium size..was slightly overpriced. What won the deal for me though, was the Cold Coffee, served in a large beer mug. Creamy, frothy, and just the right amount of cold. I could go back to Abar Baithak for its ambience, and its delicious cold coffee! :)

I L.O.V.E.D this place! Large bookcases,all tightly stacked up with books along the walls,beautiful paintings and cartoons,the exotic glass lamps on sale,gives this place a very eclectic yet homey look.A great place to hang out at and give adda.
As for the drink, I loved my Green Apple Mojito.It was fresh,tangily sweet and refreshing.The Virgin Mojito was good to but I would go for the Green Apple Mojito anytime.
Now the food.The Ham and Bacon salad was beautiful.The dish was put together in such a way that all the veggies,olives etc perfectly complimented the Ham and Bacon.And the mayo! Yum! It just made it more heavenly. Now coming up to the All Meat Platter,its a good choice if you are a meat fanatic and haven't had a good meal all day long.It fills you up and in a good way.
Finaly coming up to the slice of triple chocolate cheese cake.It had a hint of cocoa and the white chocolate thing on the top perfectly complimented the taste of your dark chocolate in your mouth.
P.S- The waiters here are realy nice and helpful.
P.P.S- Free wifi.

A hip cafe located in a calm bylane of Jodhpur Park. My friend and I had tried out tea and the brownie and they weren't bad. The ambience is perfect for someone looking for a place to just catch up with his/her friends or even for spending time just with oneself. I love the look of the bookshelves and board games, but haven't tried them out yet. And they have some cool events on most Sundays I guess, so that's a bonus! All in all, a cafe I'd like to back come to from time to time.

Growing among the youngsters of Kolkata, this place offers you good coffee, bean bag, and books. What else do you need in life? And if your guy is not just into books too much, there's a carrom board just at the corner. The chicken platter and the desserts tastes heavenly. The ambience is beautiful with coffee aroma all around the place. The husband-wife duo who owns the cafe stays just above and serves customers when its too jammed. How cool is that?

Considered as the 'modern form of Indian Coffee House', this place trickles you to the nostalgia galore. The ambience is just perfect with very interesting pictures hanging on the wall and books lined up on the shelf, fine lights (for sale) and yes! bean bags to laze around. Food is quite good. Nice cappuccino, mohitto, chicken platter and brownies. Behavior of every staff in particular is very friendly. A total fun adda place. You can even smoke here. 

Come for the perfect blend of coffee and conversation.

This is a little nook, tucked away into a by-lane of Jodhpur park. Amazing hangout for friends, with wide comfortable seats, quiet interiors, and wall shelves full of books for buying as well a small collection for reading. 

Simple fare, probably targeted at the student crowd. I love their Chicken platter, which has a really well-poached egg, and gives two long sausages, grilled, some chicken ham, chicken salami, and cheese toasts. I love the robust tasting sausages. I just wish they would increase the size of the toasts, to make it a really filling meal! 
Their baked omelettes are also great, especially the veg one paired with the meat from the platter. 
The club sandwich and chicken ham sandwich are big, and juicy. 
Good coffee, with pretty foam artwork. 
However their cold shakes are only mildly cold, which is a bit of a bother when you are expecting a chilled drink. 

The prices are on the lower side, and it's pretty good value for money. Go there for some quiet reading with a giant drink, some live performances occasionally, and return full without a pull on the pocket.

This is like the Cafe next door. Whenever it's hard to find a place to sit and pass some time, this is exactly where I go. They've got nice bean bags around low tables and a very reasonable menu. Order some light snacks, a drink- hot or cold and enjoy your time. For workaholics and others who want to use the Internet, they've got a free WiFi. 

Food is reasonably good compared to many other places of this range. Do give it a try.

Walk past the jodhpur park post office, take the second left and then turn right and arrive at the baithakkhana for another baithak. Once inside, you will thank the proprietors for not setting up yet another 'cafe' with couches in pop colours or 'funny' quotes on the wall. This one has books and art works on the shelves, some for sale, some not. You can sit on the sophy sofas or bean bags ( I had a hard time getting up though!) and also play some carrom or browse the bookshelf. Nice comfort food on the menu. Chicken platter was tasty and filling. Sandwiches and shakes, nice. Good they had Ginger honey tea on the menu, helped my sore throat. Overall, enjoyable.

Aah! What a lovely Valentine evening spent, and at what a lovely place! 
Oh yes! When I had been searching for the place over, I was like "OMG its so inside, God knows how will the place be?" And, after I entered the cafe, I am like "Wow! Fortunately I chose this cafe for my evening." Seriously saying, I just loved every bit of the place. No complaints at all! I would have given it a 5 point rating, the subtraction of 0.5 and making it 4.5, is just because the food came little late. Sorry for it! However, now let me get into the details of the place and how much I enjoyed being here.
Me and my cousin sister had planned to meet up this Valentines' evening, as we both were singles and were getting bored at home! Haha! We met each other at South City as I had to shop for a perfume. However, we wrapped up the south city part within 10-15 minutes and since I had already decided to visit Abar Baithak after a thorough search about it on Zomato itself, I told my sister about the plan. Since she stays in Jadavpur, I was expecting her to know Jodhpur Park which was the cafe's location. However, she didnt know and I called up the cafe at the number available at the Zomato site. The spokesperson guided us very well about the directions to the cafe from South City and just after a 8-10 minutes walk, we were at Abar Baithak. Just as we entered we saw four tables at four corners, all filled with people. That was the tables that were placed outside, that is the non-AC section or I would rather say the open section of the cafe. However, on finding the outside tables full and wondering to ourselves whether we could even manage a place for ourselves, we opened the door which had "PUSH" written on it, and went inside. The gate separating the outside and inside of the cafe was beautifully decorated with strings of  tiny lights and red hearts painted on the glass panes. We went inside, and found each and every table occupied. And we were on the waiting list. The tables and chairs were symmetrically arranged, clean place. However, we didnt get bored while waiting as because there was a live song and music performance going on, all romantic songs sung by a group of five people, accompanied with beautiful music being played by them through their guitar strings, tabla skins, drums and strings. All romantic songs - Hindi, English, Bengali were being sung, to celebrate the aura of love everywhere, to celebrat the Valentines! Soon we approached the waiter, and asked to let us know as soon as a table for two is empty. He nodded his head, soon after sometime, he offered us two stools to sit on a table which we had to share with other two people. I hesitated, as I believed everybody would like to have a separate table of their own. Since the place was heavily crowded today, the female owner of the place also offered us seats but in the same way. However, we denied and politely requested them to get us a separate table. And we got so in may be a couple of minutes more. We seated ourselves comfortably. I looked around the entire cafe with beeming excited eyes. Wonderful ambience, beautiful decor, yellow and red lights, several paintings on one of the walls, numerous books on the two huge book shelves, which strictly read "BOOKS FOR SALE ONLY, NOT FOR READING". In between the two book shelves, there were numerous jewellery items, necklaces, earrings, show pieces, lamps, home decor items were being sold. The chairs were very comfortable and the table had a beautiful red candle lit. It was a lovely atmosphere. Soon, we got to see the owners of the cafe, and myself being into acting, could easily make out that the owners were pretty known faces from the Bengali Television industry. The cafe had few more known faces from the Bengali television and film industry. The entire decor, the aura, the lights, the books, the furniture, everything complemented the name of the cafe and added the special Bengali touch. As it is a cafe and they dont claim to be restaurant, I dont have complains to the limited dishes available in their menu. For a cafe, it has the perfect and wide range of options to choose from, starting from hot teas, coffee, cappuccino, iced teas, milk shakes, cold coffees, and mocktails. The food section had sandwiches, rolls and wraps, and platters. After a good look-through of the menu, we ordered CHICKEN PLATTER, PEACH ICED TEA and CAFE FRAPPE for us. I even loved the way the waiter took the order and also his attitude. He was so warm in taking the orders, and also while making a conversation with us. He gave us a strip note paper for us to write down the name, number and order out there. We did so. It took a little long for the order to arrive. However it was no pain at all, since becuase we were completely busy enjoying the lovely music, looking around at so many happy people and smiling faces, lovely couples, talking to each other and ofcourse clicking lots of pictures. Soon the chicken platter arrived, it had chcicken sausages, chicken ham, chicken strips, bread crumbs with egg omlettes on them, with mayonnaise served to be used as a dip, and a sunny side up egg omlette. The platter looked lovely, and tasted yummy as well. I felt it was a very healthy food item to have. Loved it! Next came up the Cafe Frappe, which we shared. It tasted quite okay, with the typical cold coffee taste. It was good overall. The Peach Iced Tea came little later, and me being fond of iced teas, green teas and flavoured teas, I loved every sip of the peach-flavored iced tea, I could actually smell the peach aroma which added to the taste of the iced tea. Although we asked for the bill, and even we did pay it off, We were not at all in the mood to sign out off the cafe so soon as we were completely enjoying what was going on in there, and so ordered for another COLD CHOCOLATE, which came after a good 10-minutes. All the drinks were served in beer mugs, and I loved it. We sipped on the cold chocolaty yummy drink while enjoying the ambience and the songs to the fullest. As it was getting late for both of us, we had to get off soon, although we didnt want to get out. We paid the extra bucks for the Cold Chocolate and made an exit, with hearts of coming back again and again with friends and family to this lovely place.
Also to mention, the food value is excellent. The dishes and teas and coffees are very decently priced and the bill that came up is tax-free, which makes it pocket-friendly enough for everyone. 
To sum up, I would say the ambience first of all, the decor, the quality of food, the behaviour of the staff, the value for money - all these makes this place a multiple-times-visit worthy, for sure.
I will soon be back to this lovely place very soon. 
Kudos to the entire Management Team of Abar Baithak. 😊✌🏻️

Abar Baithak reveals the perfect combination of the bengali culture and it's youth. Paintings, books and a carrom board give the place a very homely feeling. We had ordered CHICKEN TORTILLA WRAPS, BLUEBERRY TORNADO, CHICKEN PLATTER, CHICKEN SALAD,  BROWNIE AND FRENCH FRIES and all that costed only around Rs 800. Perfect for meetings, addas as well as dates. <3

The coolest hangout place in Calcutta! This one is located inside Jodhpur Park (the post office lane). From the outside it might look like your regular cafes. However, inside the vibe is as chilled out as it gets. They have small sofas, chairs and bean bags thrown around and you can sit as you are comfortable. There are books (most of them for purchase though) and even a carrom board! This is really what we call a 'thek' in bengali. Managers are very friendly. We ordered a moroccan mint tea, first fusion tea and a chicken sandwich. The tea was freshly brewed. The sandwich was crisp, filling and not overloaded with mayo like in most places. This is a place where you can spend hours without getting bored, a perfect place for all addas. Now fingers crossed for finding a place during Pujo ;-)

Well, I've been to many cafés but this one stands out. This place somehow makes you fall in love with it. Been here many many times. I've recommended this place to most of my friends and all of them lived it. The staff is really good and friendly, especially "Shanti da". Food is great along with most of the drinks. Ambience is awsome and comfortable. Arguably the cosiest place I've been to. Oh and their is also a carrom board!. Highly recommended.

This place is an exact replica of my college common room :D Although it lacks a tt board, the carrom board serves the purpose! Casual environment, bean bags, coffee, great sandwiches, cakes, English breakfast... that's Abar Baithak for you. Sit here for five hours and they wouldn't mind. Everything on the menu tastes great and costs very less, thus its a students' fave.

There was a food joint close to my University. That was a hangout spot for us. But then they decided to up the prices by 150%. I was on the lookout for a new hangout spot with hangout food at hangout prices. And I think my search ends here.
It's 2 minutes' walk from my place, it has a carrom board, it's spacious, the owners believe in a personal approach, the ambience is great. What else do you need. Also, the teas here are pretty awesome. I NEVER drink tea. I made an exception, and I wasn't disappointed. Visit ASAP.

The new location is even better. It's just a couple of minutes' walk from the last location and is bigger.

Full marks to the place.. No doubt about it. Initially I was a bit fudgy regarding the place but my reluctance simply got booed down as the place holds perfect ambience to chat with your partner or friends over a cup of coffee or tee.. The cafe frappe is worth trying. It's a hell lot better than CCD or Barista.

Perfect place for hanging out with friends for chit-chats over a cup of coffee.
The place itself will give you an essence of having "Bengali Adda" with your close buddies after a hectic day.
Well I went there with one of my friend and tasted chicken sandwich and cafe frappe.
The frappe was served in bear mug and it is really huge in amount.
The sandwich also tastes good.
And yes there was a carrom board also which anyone can play.

I have been in this fusion cafe twice and i intend to go back again and again just because of one thing..the chilled out ambiance that i found in no other cafes in kolkata. I sometimes feel people actually go there for an adda session and then food takes the backseat. A carrom board, handicrafts, book shelves..even the waiters can join you for a round of carrom such is the ambiance in here. I have liked their meat platter very much as well as the chicken and cheese sandwich.. very filling and tasty. However tried their mushroom and corn sandwich once and it was rather dry. Dont think veg is really their thing. Coffees are good, far descent than the overpriced crap u get in a CCD.

Just returned after a school friends meet at Abar baithak, a typical south calcuttan cafeteria with pretty decent cafe menu, simple decor consisting various seating arrangemnets like couches, chairs, bean bags, an outside smoking area (plus .5 for that) all bright yellow lit, book racks and shelves on one side, a carrom board and some paintings on the other wall, slightly enlarged version of the wise owl. The man in charge 'Shanti da' is very very friendly and helpful. We ordered a round of tea for us, GINGER HONEY TEA, MILK TEA, KASHMIRI KAHWA one each as in the order we liked.
the CHICKEN SANDWICH was pretty a dry one, a lil dose of cheese or mayo would have made it tastier. CHICKEN PLATTER with cheese toast, egg poach, chicken sausages, salami and ham was a great deal. Its very filling and absolute value for money. Liked the BAKED HAM AND BACON OMLETTE as well. The dessert STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE was okay, could be improved a lot. 
The second visit impressed us with TIRAMISU CAPPUCINO ( recommended) though the chicken omlette was a downer.

Visited this place a couple of days back with a friend.. Loved the joint really cool place to hang out with ur pals, have a chat and maybe even play some carom. The environment is really significant to a place like Kolkata where, lots of book lovers and cultural enthusiasts might be looking for a place to chill out. That being said.. The food was not upto the mark at all... After hearing about their much mentioned Spicy Mexican Hot Chocolate..I was really excited abt trying it out.. But much to my dismay the drink was inedible.. It was sooo sweet and thick as if they forgot the key ingredient "milk"! The spice was really in your face really hit u in the throat , also got the baked omelet with chicken. The chicken smelled very old and the texture was hard as rocks as if it had been frozen in the refrigerator for a while, produce was definitely not fresh. Also no condiments on the table!  Another down point was that the books were not for reading!! I was really looking forward to picking up and book and reading while I enjoyed my drink but they were only for sale. I really think they should rethink this aspect of the restaurant and have some books for reading as well. All in all a good place to hang out with your friends but don't come here on an empty stomach looking for a book to read..

The rating is solely for the ambiance!
The only thing that appealed to me, I loved the shallow tables, cosy bean bags , the warm decor!
Service is okish!
Now, for food it has a long way to go! The food is not worth the price, coffee was okish, we had tried nonveg chicken platter, it had two bread toasts with cheese and chilli flakes, two sausages, not properly seared, two hams and two salami ... Tasted okish only! Presentation is typically British breakfast style with a poached egg. But mayo was very less and they charge for extra! They don't have salt and pepper on the table!!
Well I know I complain alot!
Still I can go there for the sheer love for adda again!

I really liked the adda ambience, the coffee shop is not like those regular ones. It has a homely atmosphere which attracted me a lot, I liked the bookshelves the most and food was also nice. Would definitely visit again and again.

Sausage n ham are just packaged food nothing else....in seekh kebabs sandwitch there is no chicken seekh kabab. Only that is small pieces of chicken ham...I can say it a good place to hangout but food is not worthy to try

Like the name suggests, Abar Baithak is the place for Adda lovers. With a carrom board right inside the café, it gives you a feel of an old college common room where you can sink your teeth in warm goodies and while your time away; playing or just enjoying a tete-a-tete over a steaming cup of Darjeeling tea or cappuccino. The environment is really informal with bean bags arranged around small tea tables. The place is always buzzing with young and old people. The food is quite affordable and scrumptious.

I went in with my mother and her friend for a pretty late coffee, at around 9 p.m. and ordered 2 Cappuccino and an Americano alongside one Chicken platter. Their behavior is outstandingly awesome! They seem only too happy to have you there which creates such a good mood automatically, something very essential in a café. The coffee was great, you're given both brown n cane sugar packets to sweeten the coffee according to your taste. Extra points for the beautiful designed cream on top! The chicken platter was a winner! From the salami and sausages to the pizza sandwich, the different tastes blend in so beautifully together. As for the ambience, the place is pretty large with comfortable club chairs and bean bags (!!!), unlike usual cramped up cafés and has both indoors and outdoors seating arrangements. The café doubles up as a shop and there are lots of books, CDs, gorgeous lights, bags, jackets and decorative put up for sale- an absolute consumerist joy! What's more, they have free Wifi..!! This so is my favourite café now!

Though the place has quite a fan following, but for me the appearance was a bit shabby and overdone. Sometimes i wasn't sure whether i was sitting in a coffee shop, a college common room, a bookshop or a gift shop. The saviour was though the food. Ordered coffee n chicken platter and i was not disappointed. In fact i would love to visit again just coz of the sausages. They were really good, but couldn't find them as a separate dish on the menu card. All in all a place where college goers might love to drop by, but might not be a perfect place for executive professionals.

There was a lack of a proper cafe at Dhakuria for a very  long time. But with Abar Baithak reopening at Jodhpur Park gave an immense relief to those bored by having to visit the same  bad old ones already present. The new place is nice, spacious and the decor is quite cool. Baithak's food has always been very good. The portions in accordance with their prices are quite fair. Their meat platter and shakes are worth the money.

I have been there 3 times till now and have been fascinated each time with an urge to revisit. This is a place where anyone of any age can visit and be happy in their own way. Hours fly. The ambiance is a wonderful concoction of a small local club and that of a cafe.
There is a huge variety of tea and coffee. Some special flavors of tea are specially fascinating like the Choco Cigar or the Kashmiri Kahwa. There is a good amount of tasty food available, including Sandwiches, Tortilla wraps, Salads, Platters etc. which can be a perfect company for your tea/coffee.
Whether you go there alone, with your girlfriend, with a lot of friends or with parents ... this place is bound to leave a happy smile when you leave.
And YES ! The Carrom board is a true USP (at least for me) for this cafe !

One of best hangout place in south Calcutta. The ambience is very good and homely but sometime you may have to wait for 10-15mins for a table. Staffs and service of the place is excellent. I have tried their chicken platter, caffe latte, chicken sandwich, cold coffee with icecream. Chicken platter and chicken sandwich were good. The portions of the beverages were very good. From the price point of view you'll love this place. Taxes are included and even the add-ons are very pocket friendly. For eg. Cold coffee is just 80 and you can add a scoop of icecream in Rs.30. Only thing is that I have tried their other wraps and sandwiches too and flavours of the chicken is kind of repetitive. But I will definitely recommend this cafe.

The ambience is undoubtedly ideal for enjoying that cup of coffee over adda with your favourite people. The idea of putting a variety of products like local handicrafts,paintings,books and gift items on display is also laudable,although the stuff are a tad overpriced. However, the food there could honestly do with a little more taste :D

This place is perfect for hangout with friends. Ambience is very nice. It has homelike environment which is perfect for relaxing adda... Lovely decor..extra touch with sofa, bean bag, a wall full of books, paintings and enough time to spend... Food is also good.. We ordered cappuccino, cafe frappe, and non-veg bowl... Overall i spend a wonderful evening there and it was a great experience. I can easily say dat it is one of best cafes in Kolkata.

Though the location is inconvenient , situated at a 10 mins walking distance from south city mall and in the middle of pretty confusing roads the ambience of this place is perfect for adda. I tried plain.cold.coffee - good in taste but not awsome or anything, cafe frappe, french fry and chicken sheekh kabab sandwich - tastes good as compared to price of 130. The best thing about this place is its homely feel and creative drawings around ots wall. Also there is a carrom board for those who loves to play. Also this cartoon paintings are for sell along with books and few inhouse products as well. The entire place is decorated with bean bags. Overall i had a very good experience. Very good adda zone. Would definitely visit again.
Overall rating: 4/5

I had no idea of this wonderful place until a couple of my classmates took me over. The location is a bit inconvenient, but the food and ambience more than makes up for it. It is the perfect place for ADDA with friends.

I had chicken salami sandwich, which was great. No complaints about it at all. They take 20-25 minutes to serve you.

We hung around for almost two hours chatting and enjoying. The only reason this place didn't get 5/5 is because they played really loud music which wasn't turned down even when we requested them to.

            Update (Day 2): Tried out some more food at this place. Had the cold coffee, the french fries and the pudding. The cold coffee was good, but a bit too sweet for my taste. A lot of cafes give you sugar sachets instead of adding a lot of sugar. Sugar consumption varies from customer to customer. They should start doing this.

The French fries were okay. Nothing great about them. They could do far better. The pudding is terribly overpriced and tastes bland.

Day 3: They have shifted to a different location. Their interior has been redone with a new Feluda theme. It's two floors now. The Cappuccino wasn't up to the mark. I expected much better. The Spicy Mexican Hot Chocolate (a friend ordered it) was really good. I'll order this for myself the next time. The Cafe Frappe was too sweet. The Chicken sandwich was pretty dry.

The staff is really courteous and polite. The loud music problem, however, still persists. Taking away another star.

Personally, I didn't like the food here. The milk tea tasted like hot water. The chicken salad was more of a cabbage salad. Yes, it is a nice place to go and hangout but the food isn't worth it.

Ahhhhaa..one of my favourite adda joints. A typical bengali adda spot redefined. nice decor, good books, quirky stuffs all over and obviously good food..I have been there innumerable times but finally writing a review so late.
Chicken platter, all meat platter, grilled fish sandwich, chicken seekh kebab sandwich, soda lime and the deserts especially cakes are things to look for as you hit this joint.

Lovely hot chocolate on a mellow Sunday evening. They tend to make you share tables if they have too many people walking in, which I guess, it does often. There's a carom board and an outside smoking area and bookshelves full of books to browse and to buy. Their sandwiches were decent and tea quite ok. Had a nice time watching the husband play carom with strangers. I don't mind playing boardgames with strangers. But sharing tables is a bit much.

Very good place for having an "ADDA" with friends... its like a common room with attached canteen and library... deco was nothing gr8 but still charming... different types of seating arrangements for different types of people... also have indoor and outdoor  comfortable seating available... the carrom board is one of the major attraction here... now coming to the food I had there 1.Ginger honey tea.... Excellent, 2. Crab meat sandwich... good, 3. Red velvet cheese cake... very good.... service was prompt.... staffs are very friendly and well mannered.... pocket pinch was friendly too... will give a visit again...

Good place to chill with friends. Ambience is very nice and so are the behavior and service of the staff. Grilled Fish Sandwitch, Kashmiri Quawah and Fresh Lime Soda were what I ordered yesterday evening on Diwali when i visited the place with my friends. The sandwitch had a thick fillet of grilled fish and tasted great. Kashmiri Quwah was vry refreshing. Diwali evening was indeed well-spent. Perfect place to chill with friends for hours.

"Fusion of a modern cafe with a Bengali Adda", this might be the best one liner that can actually describe this place. I have taken a lot of time before finally sitting down to write a review on it. 

Located in one of the most busy localities in South Kolkata, locality being Jodhpur Park. With Gariahat being a 10 minute drive away, Jadavpur University a 5 minute drive and South City being a 5 minute walk from this place, this adda zone is nestled among the busy places in this part of the city. 

This "modern cafe" is by far one of the best places according to any layman and not only the cafe connoisseurs, residing in this city. The place where Abar Baithak has taken the extra step to stand out of the majority cafes in this city is the presence of an in-house bookshelf from where people can buy and read the books of their choice while enjoying their favourite drink or munching over the snacks offered by them. There is an additional section where people can enjoy reading a book or a magazine without buying it.

For the ones who aren't bibliophiles, they can enjoy their adda or play carrom or any other board games which are offered by Abar Baithak. This shows that they have not only targetted the working people but also the students and family.

Services, this is one more place where they score a home run! Hospitality is the main aim that this industry has to offer and Abar Baithak continuously strive to make it better than the past second while upholding the industry's perceived offering. Even though the official nature is self-service, the people in here try to go beyond that and try to offer table service, thus walking the extra mile to create a homely environment for their patrons.

Food, this place doesn't serve the food that we are normally used to in Indian cafes. With the advent of globalisation, that has spead like wild fire and still continues to do so, they have brought the cuisines around the world under their roof. They offer Fish Fingers, tortilla wraps, various flavours of tea, coffee, sandwiches, assorted fried chicken, french fries, sausages, cupcakes, brownies, cakes. They even make cheese cakes and red velvet cakes which have made this generation crazy about them. 

Entertainment, this is again a place where they hit another home run! Every Sunday there is some sort of a cultural program wherein different artists come over to stage their performance, growing bands/ theater groups perform to mak their presence felt in an audience where in there are major names in the film industry. Thus, the perfect place for the people to network. There is some sort of music always playing on the sound dock.

Ambience, it is just what one needs to relax. From warm lighting to the cool air-conditioned room for the non smokers. While the smokers can have fun and enjoy their adda or read something or just do their job while relaxing while having a smoke and muchies or coffee. 

From being located in a very convenient location for shoppers, movie goers, students and office goers, this place has much to offer than what is there I could type down in this review. However, it is managed by humans who are bound to make mistakes, but we should over look the little flaws and enjoy the place which welcomes you with a smile, serves you with a smile and bids you farewell with a smile that longs your return. Nothing is perfect in this world and it is human psychology to take undue advantage of the same, however we must respect the unsaid, yet obvious rules of this place to help them serve us better.

Please do visit this place not only because it is awesome but it doesn't pinch your pocket too hard for the time you spend there. Have fun! 
Hope to see you there and casually chat up, enjoying a mug of Cafe Frappee! :)

Visited this cafe to spend some evening leisure time. The place is nice. Food is nice. They got a whole array of books piled up for both reading and buying. They got something interesting which i had never before enjoyed in other cafe, indoor games. I played a round of carrom. There are chess and word puzzle too. As for food, the chicken platter was tasty. And the brownie with chocolate and ice cream was fabulous. But the cold coffee prep could have been so much better, i dint like it much, Ambience is also good. I really liked the posters on the wall. But the ac was in very low power. Really cudnt feel the temp diff outside and inside.

Went there a couple of days back with some friends. The ambiance is perfect for an adda that's y I gave it 2.5 but the service is awful and the quality of food and drinks even more so. One should go there just for adda with drinks and eateries from outside which u can eat "under" the table.

Been there in August, despite of the directions mentioned in some of the reviews, had to figure out our way (you'll be able to figure it yourself, the security guards of the apartments around are of no help).
So, the ambience is great, you'll love it. We ordered affogato, cold coffee and chicken salad. Other than the chicken salad we loved the cold coffee and the affogato (the chicken salad wasn't that disappointing though). Looking forward to visit Abar Baithak soon. :)

The best thing I like about this cafe, is it's ambiance & the bean bags are my definite favourite 😝😝. A great place to sit, relax,hang out with friends & even to study from their quite good collections of books which are also available for sale. They even organise small live performances on weekends. It also has indoor game lyk carrom. Now coming to food. I am a regular visitor there & hence tried a lot number of items on their menu. Examples are chicken salad, brownie with ice cream, affogato, different shakes & juices, fries, lassi etc. Chicken salad & lassi were not as expected but other foodstuffs were yumm. The price is excluding the tax & thus price of some eats are lil much more in my opinion. This place worth a visit.

On entry its not that bad it is just a hi-fi adda zone which will and obviously attracts a class of people for me who likes quiet time and lone Tim it I not the place..... The carrom board on entry is not good plus it is very loud and the drinks I took, in simple words I have had better, and a small note to the owner is paper cups are biodegradable but normal cups u don't need to degrade stop using them..... Give us proper cups...... Not satisfied

I am rating this a 5 because honestly I don't have any complaints. It's a joint situated in a remote place in jodhpur park few minutes away from South City mall. It's a cafe with a very welcoming vibe to the senses at least for me, it's like a home not too professional and the crowd usually is not your average rackety teenagers it's much more mature and quite. The best feature was the food and beverages because I have been in CCD which is a money pit whereas I believe abar baithak offers the same range of food and it prices them a lot more sensibly. I mean I want go to a cafe for some mild snacks or refreshments but I don't want to end up spending as if I've been to a restaurant.  Overall it was a great experience and I can easily say with experience that it is one of the best cafes in Kolkata.

The let down is pretty average drinks at least the price doesn't. However I don't know for snacks. But still it will be ur place if u stay or ur someone stays near. I visited it first this pujo.

Such a lovrly place.  We went there on ashtami eve. It was so bangali bangali my bon remarked how "aantel marka" the place was in a good way. We felt so out of place being the only people in jeans everyone else was wearing traditional outfits. We ordered the spicy mexican hot chocolate which was good and the all meat platter was awesome and reasonably priced. The setting was so laid back. Would love to go there again. :)

Amazing experience.. Went there this Astami.. Lovely typically Bangaliyana antlamo.. This really reminds us of that 'purono diner baithak khana ghor'. Just five steps from my house, and I could not be any happier. The food was good, nothing amazing.. Although a little overpriced in place with the quantity served. We ordered the non veg bowl, which was nothing much but fried chicken nuggets and French fries which disappointed me quite a bit. I also ordered the crab meat sandwich, which was a filler and amazing in taste. We also ordered a Chocolate Megraj and chocoberry cooler. In the end I searched for the cheesecake, sadly tht was not on the menu.. But when I went up to the nice lady in the counter and asked for it, I was served a generous helping of Red Velvet Cheesecake which me being a sucker for cheesecakes, I loved. The decor also has comfy bean bags for 'lyadh khawa' chatting, a carrom board for games and books and tinklets and coffee mugs for sale as well as for reading.

I visited their previous outlet once which made me simply fall in love with this cosy,comfortable cafe. And as soon they opened the new outlet it became a must-go place for me for any hangout. The sumptous and finger licking tit-bits, carrom board, books, a great host SHANTI DA, 2 proud owners Soumya and Swaraleepi and loads of adda is all what you are going to get when u visit this place. The place was open 24*7 for the last 3days in this Durga puja and I couldn't help but spend the leisure time over here for these 3days. I strongly recommend all to visit at least once.

The moment I stepped in,"Shit!! It has a carrom board". This place is mentionable for its' decor. They provide sofa,bean bag, a wall full of books and enough time to spend. One could get a cup of moccachino and spend hour with books and that carrom. Bengali intellect culture and adda are the things one can get here other than their foods. Foods are quite like cafes,not that mentionable. But yes,they provide a large varieties of coffee and cakes( not pastries).

The decor of the place is OK. There are still better places to go. We ordered for tea, cappuccino, veg and chicken omelette. Tea was served cold had to notify them to heat it up again. Omelettes were a dissapointment. Hardly any taste of the egg. Too much milk used while beating the egg probably which spoiled the overall taste. However if you wish to hangout with friends and just have tea, kill some time for a while, play carrom or something its OK to come here. If you're here for the food I'm sure there are way better places.

Located in the by lanes of Jodhpur park, this is quite a nice place to chill.. It is a 2 min walk from my home, and though it has been here for quite some time now, it was only a couple of days back that i visited the place.
Abar Baithak, as cool as the name, has a unique ambience, with a new age look, yet filled with the great yester year aura.
We went there for chitchat, and had watermelon fizz, fresh lime soda, cappuccino, and the crab meat sandwhich, which were all pretty good.
More than the food, its the ambience that will enthrall you.. You can go with a friend and relieve old memories, or just keep a nice quite afternoon to yourself, this place won't dissapoint you. The prices are quite cheap too.
Be there, it's unique...!!

I was introduced to this cafe by my friend. Love for coffee and a coffee shop has been haunting me when I shifted back to Calcutta. I was skeptical at first but everything changed when I walked into this cozy coffee shop. Books, scrabble, carom table, meat platter, good coffee, watermelon fizz and all the other mojitos, the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the Caramel pudding!
Now Abar Baithak has become my everyday place and it doesn't pinch your pocket much.

P.S. Try out the Caramel Pudding! It's the best pudding :)

Just too good - be it ambience, be it its food quality or be it its staff and owner's behaviour. Though I understand its more of casual "adda" / "baithak", but a suggestion to start prior appointment particularly in peak hours.
Also, another suggestion to enlist in Trip advisor, so that more and more people not only in Kolkata, but people across West Bengal, rest of India and even rest of the world will come to know of such a meeting place.

A small gem of a coffee house in one of the bylanes of Jodhpur Park. The moment you get in you sort of like the place. No chic decor. Rather homely atmosphere, one wall filled with books and trinkets to be sold. Old world chairs and bean bags strewn on the ground, music in the background... The food is quite cheap.. But mind you no compromise in quality or quantity. We had cold cofee and chicken tortilla wraps. Both quite good. Looking forward to more visits to this place.

The ambience is perfectly moduled for a coffee shop. Books, coffee, friends, music... It's the mixture of all of these. 
We had red Velvet cheese cake, crab meat sandwich, fish finger and coffee-tea etc.
The cheese cake was not very good. As per my idea it was not fresh. Fish finger's outer quote was thik. Crab meat sandwich was good and testy. And tea-coffee was as usual.

A very good place to give adda with your friends. Food quality is good, of all the dishes I tried, CHICKEN PLATTER is a must try dish. Staffs are also very friendly. The owners are always there in case you need suggestion for food & yes, they will help you with the best options. Last but not the least, the best thing about this cafe is they have carrom board & you can play along while sipping a cup of tea or coffee.

How a cafe or a restaurant would tempt you like no other depends, I believe, more on its decor and hospitality than any menu. Abar Baithak is a place I heard about from a couple of good friends who like to go lunching to new places. Taking a glance at the menu anyone would realize that it is not a place to have full course meals, but then an All Meat Platter involving sausages, bacon, toasts, salami and an egg poach, a Baked Chicken Omelette cooked to melted perfection with cheese, and a plate of crisp yellow French Fries would be enough for three ladies who swear by food (and are completely ignorant of weight-watching tactics!). As sugar-lovers, we concluded the meal with muffins that were freshly baked and do not feature on the menu but are available at the counter. 
Why I started this review reflecting on the decor is because, upon entering the cafe your eyes will most certainly fall on the long line of book shelves that offer you books you can leaf through while sipping your Espresso. There are books you can buy also, but then the pop-lit culture that we belong to might make you ask, 'Why would I buy Ashapurna Debi Kishor Somogro from a cafe where I might find the same copy at 25% discount outside?' But you may find something interesting and rare from the reading section that talks about art and history provocatively. I have already begun to admire the owners' taste in reading and food preferences!
 While toying with the Gamchha Print Skirts, Scarves and Sling Bags that were also on the display for sale, we sampled the Green Apple Mojito, Orange Mojito and Watermelon Fizz that were a little too heavy on the sweet side. We paid something around 700/- for all the things we ordered. That was a score winner! We found out that actors and writers also come to hang out with coffees or buy puddings from the counter while catching up with old familiar faces! This is the best thing about this place. Abar Baithak takes you back to the age of romanticism but at the same time do not scream 'intellectual' just for the sake of it! The foam filled bean bags let you relax and live, like you would at home. Minus pretension! 
Just go there. Take a breather. Play a little carom as they have very thoughtfully placed a board inside. Make friends with the owners if they are around. Take photographs and the staffs would oblige you by taking yours. Eat and smoke, if that's absolutely necessary, as was the case with us three! Overall, if you want a two-three hours satisfying escape from the inorganic life the city offers, don't go home, go to Abar Baithak! It's a great idea!

Imagine a cafe with one entire wall lined with bookshelves for you to pick and browse from, which serves up a rather interesting array of nom-noms and at times transforms itself into the venue for a live jam session! I'd never have discovered this gem in the heart of Jodhpur park but for my friend, and we found it was a pleasant place to head for adda sessions. There are games as well, and the carrom table is always occupied. The collection of books were a surprising mixed bag, and the food was good. The star was the Affogato, my first, and I was won over by it.

Food-wise though it could do better, I think Abar Baithak lives up to its name and is the best possible nostalgic adda-spot-cum-meeting place one could dream up. Want to spend hours talking books, films and politics while sipping that coffee? This is your place.

Heard a lot about this cafe from friends of mine who are frequent visitors so finally decided to visit this place on a sunday evening along with 3 friends. Located inside the residential area of jodhpur park the place is quite n calm. Decor of the restraunt is fantastic. Its an old house turned into a cafe . There is a decent collection of books which you can read and buy too. Sitting is comfy with good arrangement of tables and chairs and couches. There are few board games like carrom, etc which one can play with buddies. The staff is hospitable. Now coming to the food its similar to the other cafes like ccd n all but the prices are much cheaper and it will not burn a hole in pocket :) since it was sunday it was really crowded. From my side this cafe is great to hangout with friends and will be my frequent hookup place.

This place has become my second home ... be it a hectic working day or a lazy weekend I always end up here ... Once you enter you'll get a feel that this is the best place you can be to chill out or just shove off your work pressure.... They have chair tables..bean bags..sofas all around..even separated smoking zone and a comfortable inside seating arrangement... People from 8 to 80 can feel free to visit this place..they have got books .. carrom..chess...and lots of indoor games to play and sip your coffee...My personal favourite is Ginger Honey tea...tortilla wrap.. a full meat platter...French fries.. and sandwiches .... I tried their iced tea once but didn't like it much..but that is no reason to stop visiting that place..they have beautiful tracks playing all the time...the staff is very friendly specially Shanti da..no matter what I do he always helps me out... and Soumya da and Saralipi di are also very friendly...you ask them any thing they are ready with an answer... I go there an jump around and it feels like I am in my own place and that's the beauty of "Abar baithak" .. you need some peace .... visit this place you'll find some.... :)

As lovely and cosy as the previous one, this new one with Feluda Theme is awesome. Gone are those lazing around in bean bag days as they have shifted to just the next lane and have redecorated with a narrow couple space upstairs and a bigger area for groups having the nameplate of 'Maganlal Meghraj' . The outdoor sitting area has been expanded as well. The cute corner with the carrom board stays. :) 
The food is great. The mocktails the sandwiches and the coffees are delicious. The meat platters and the desserts  are too good . The staff is friendly and nice. This place holds a special place in my heart. Highly recommended.

Abar Baithak is surely one of the perfect place for a baithak or adda or simple heartfelt conversations.
Bengali version of CCD.
Good and friendly ambience, decorated so nicely which gives a feel to get another cup of coffee or stay there a bit longer.
Thumbs up for this concept.

Abar Baithak is located close to Jodhpur Park Boys school. Its a place to be for adda addicts! The decor and ambience has an informal and casually relaxing feel. Waiters are friendly but clumsy 😉...food is good and reasonable but service is slow...the sitting arrangements would remind you of your collage canteen...am sure to visit often, may be not for food or beverages but for the charm the place has in it, a old world relaxed Bong Adda house! Cheers! 😊

This place is perfect for that late afternoon or lazy evening hangouts. I often frequent this place as it is easy on my wallet and compliments my food palette.
The Chicken Platter is something to really look forward to, also the desserts like Affogato are really tempting at the given price.
The decor is classy and the visitors are greeted to a hoard of books and other collector items. Service is fast.
The one bad thing about this place being lack of entertainment factors.

It has everything i love- Bookshelves to browse and buy, board games and carrom, beanbags, pretty pretty lifestyle products&music CDs to shop and great music playing..the aroma of the fresh food and books is amazing..Everything we ordered was consistently perfect..we had the All meat platter, the Crab meat sandwich, grilled fish sandwich, All meat tortilla, iced tea, milkshake, pudding and chocolates.I would particularly recommend the grilled fish sandwich, all meat platter and crabmeat sandwich. The menu is reasonably priced and there are events held on Sunday afternoons..plays and musical soirees etc for which I absolutely have to revisit.. worth every minute of my time and every rupee spent.Am definitely going there again :)

A quaint place situated in the many bylanes of Jodhpur Park. The ambience is awesome - you have bean bags, regular chairs and also comfy sofas. There's an AC section and also a non-AC one. We ordered the Green apple mojito and the French Kiss mojito. I liked the Green apple one better. We then ordered the Chicken Platter for lunch. I wanted to try the meat one, but my friend had some reservations about pork, so I decided against. At 165 rupees, its moderately priced, and quite filling. It had eggs, salamis, sausages, garlic bread with a pinch of mayonnaise. 
Overall, a good place to take someone out to a date or to catch up with old friends and acquaintances. Hoping to visit again by the end of the week.

A taste of Caventers in the city, away from the mountains is truly a welcome gift for any Kolkatan. The couple who runs this joint is adorable n the staff will treat you in a way thal'll make you feel special. Their platter is made of exquisite meat servings n reminded me of a b'fast at Darj. All their items on menu are extremely reasonably priced, rather on the lower range so its always easy pn the pocket. Most loved factor about this joint is their literary ambience n great eye for quality. Any art enthusiast is sure to fall in love with this place n revisit time n again. Ofcouse i did  :)

Since the bengali nature is all about adda abar baithak is just the place for bangali, bongs, antel , intellectuals , petuk and the foodies. The ambience is homely I love to go and just sit there with friends , family or even alone. And being a book cafe its just cherry on top of everything .. you can buy books, read books , arts objects and also home decors of certain stuffs. The food is simply stylish .. i love the coffee and the fish finger brings water even in the mouth of vegetarians ..

Superb ambience to hang out or chill out with friends at the end of the day, and, there is an added bonus if you are a bookaholic. A book shop to add to a cafe is a new concept in Kolkata, and a hit one, especially when the books range from Asterix and Tintin to great adventure stories like that of Hemendrakumar Roy.
I feel  5stars is not enough,especially when they have a top class food quality and service, added with an amazing ambient experience.

The ambiance is beautiful with good music, beautiful pictures hanging on the wall. Beautiful book shelf and a carom board .. also charging points are available so we can plug our phone or laptop and enjoy the entertainment over it.. the shop is divided into 2 section one is ac and another is non ac mainly for the purpose of smoking..  the methods of cooking is made visible to the customer so that they know how they are cooking the food .. I love the designs they make over coffee. . A great place in town best for hangout with buddies

Had been yearning for a nice cafe around here for a long time and finally one came up which is worth the praise. 
Situated in the comfy lanes of jodhpur park, providing a large space for lazing about, staying as long as you want in bean bags, outdoor seats,  sofas; just take ur pick!
Also there's a carrom board which is bound to keep you entertained ☺

The food here is good and reasonably priced.
We few ppl have made this place our regular haunt. Iced mochas and Iced frappe are some really good drinks. But I would suggest not to have the coffee yoghurt. It tastes just weird. 
The chocolate cake they make is sinful. It's a must try! 
I would recommend adding some more food variety, some wonderful desserts.  That would really give this place a boost!

Coffee is good and the cookies as well. We ordered Seekh kebab Sandwich which was delicious. The only problem is with the quantity of the breakfast platter. If they increase it a bit. They are good to go. Youngsters like us should definitely not miss this place. I love it. :)

Take anybody or nobody with you, eat anything or just order a cappuccino and read books (they have got loads of them). It's really a cool place to hang out with your friends or just to be there alone and enjoy yourself. No one is going to bother you or ask you 'dada r kichhu neben?' And the best part is they have this huge carom board and you'll definitely get some partners. 

They also have a different place to seat for people who smoke. Usually I go with my girlfriend. She takes a lemon ice tea and I go for an americano.
 
I like this place and I recommend it and try the chicken salad. It good.

The books display, small decorative lanterns are attractive and one will be ending up buying one or more of those... There are many more decorative items available to buy and gift. You can just have a home like feeling watching tv and having a "chit-chat" with your dear ones with some beverages or may be coffee or ice tea anything you want.... They have a huge variety menu offerings.... I liked the place very much... Hope reading this review you will also go there... So now you must go and spend a really quality time with your near or dear ones....

We had ordered a non veg bowl, caramel coffee, grilled chicken tortilla/wrap and chicken platter. Last but not the least, I had my very first red velvet cake here, and it was amazing. A must try for all cake lovers. Service is also decent.  Overall, a good place to visit.

The direction is simple, you take the first right after dhakuria bridge then second left and finally first right. The footfall in this place is so high that sometimes you have to share table with another couple(if it's a four seater).
The interiors are simple and nice and they do sale few other stuffs like books, photo frames etc.
Now coming to the food, we ordered a cappuccino, a cafe frappe , French fries and a red velvet and cheese cake. While all the items were ordinarily good, I must mention that I have had red velvet cake and cheese cake separately and never the fusion of the two. And it works quite well. Kudos to whoever thought to combine the best of these two dishes.

The place is conveniently located and is a seven minute walk away from jodhpur park bus stop. The interiors of the place are immensely interesting ,as they have an in-house bookstore and sell accessories and clothes as well ! The place looks vibrant with paintings on the wall and the knick knacks they sell. The food is a nice mix of usual cafe fare , such as coffee, hot chocolate, and milkshakes, wraps and chicken and meat platters. The chicken platter was filling and good , and the Mexican spicy hot chocolate, though a little hot to taste, because of the cinnamon they put in it, wasn't bad overall. The staff and ambience of this place are amazing , and you can have all the Adda you want without being told to tone down your voice or laughter ! If you're meeting up with friends after decades , consider this as your one stop choice for that special never ending Adda with a nice mix of food and beverages thrown in . Oh, also they don't charge you taxes !

The name speaks for the ambiance.. As the name suggests, the place provides all the right things to go for a 'baithak' with your friends and or that special someone ;).
Comfortable chairs, bean bags, smoking zone, carrom board, books to read, live cricket match on TV... everything adds up to the mood for a perfect adda.
Coming to the food, the menu doesn't have a lot to offer, primarily because this is a cafe, but whatever you get is of good taste and quality... We had ordered for Green tea, cold coffee and chicken salad... All were pretty decent.. They also serve good combo platters..

Over all a great place to spent long hours doing nothing but pure 'adda'...

Additionally, if this wasn't enough for you, they sell books and craft items.. :)

Had been there a few weeks ago. It's a great cafe with really cool seating arrangements to hang out with friends and peers and have a nice chatting session. They have arrangements for outside where people who smoke can prefer sitting. I couldn't take any pictures because I didn't have my phone then. The food was good. We had ordered an All Meat Platter, Ham and Bacon Omlette, Affocado and an Americano. Everything was nice but it took a long time to be served because people generally do not eat out anything over there. Generally they spend hours over a cup of coffee. So they were not equipped to handle the orders. Hence, took time. The staffs were casual chatting among themselves except one aged man who explained everything very clearly. So the experience was okay. But brownie points should be awarded for the ambience, decor and for setting up such a cool place to hang out with friends and foes.

As a food joint, this is the best I could give or even one can say I have been a little generous in giving 3.5. The food is ok type. But the upsides of the place is that it is open till pretty late and you can play carrom or chess while having your drinks or food. If I go there again, food won't be the factor that would be driving me in.

Thats wat we can say about this place.. We went their after having a stressful day to have a cup of coffee.. Location was bit tricky but Google baba is always there to help..!! So we entered on a busy Sunday evening..! Both indoor and outdoor (for smokers) facilities are available.. The place is beautifully decorated.. The ambiance is very cheerful and a pinch of Bangaliana is added to it.. 

We ordered, Lemon and Peach Cold tea along with Irish Coffee ( which was really good) , French fry , Chicken Tortilla Wraps ( delicious) and Chocolate Sandwich ( innovative but too sweet) .. wanted to try the cheese cake but our badluck it was sold out already .. Overall we were much satisfied after having our adda and food.. We were totally refreshed..!! :)

This place has an overwhelming aura of a typical bengali adda scenario, with a carrom board on one end and wooden chairs along with a wall lined with various novels and Board games on-the-go. The men who run the establishment are very courteous and always have a smile on their faces. The food isn't the main focus of this place as the things on offer are mainly finger foods. "Adda" is the shizz here. Perfect for a lazy weekend outing with a couple of friends... Drooling over a non veg platter of Nuggets , French Fries & Fish fries. Also accompanying these were salami, sausages and an omlette. Order a cuppa' and to the soft melodies of yore connect with your friends.

"Adda" is the shizz here. Perfect for a lazy weekend outing with a couple of friends... Drooling over a non veg platter of Nuggets , French Fries & Fish fries. Also accompanying these were salami, sausages and an omlette. Order a cuppa' and to the soft melodies of yore connect with your friends.

One of the best cafes in kolkata at present...totally breaks the monotony..it has the bengali flavour of "adda" ambience... a true bong cafe.
Even though there ambience is the ups...the food served here is worth a mention...they welcome you with a friendly smile..
Overall great experience, highly recommended

Abar baithak breaks the monotony of the conventional cafes in Kolkata. It's spacious and food that's served is good....in fact better than many other cafes out there, both in respect of quality and quantity.

We had Cold chocolate, all meat platter, chicken platter, chicken tortilla wrap and Affogato. Since apart from Affogato all the others are self explanatory I'll only explain what amazing thing this Affogato is. Three scoops of vanilla ice cream with some coffee poured over it topped with choco chips and wafers.........sounds quite simple but it's delicious!!! A must try for everyone with a sweet tooth.

Another thing that I absolutely love about this cafe is the name- ABAR BAITHAK. It has this certain Bangaliana to it which is sure to appeal to Bengalis (and you know the appeal is quite strong when you find your parar-dadu-der-gang discussing politics over a cup of espresso and tortilla, seated right next to your table. I mean,let's be real, the Dadu gangs prefer parar cha er dokan any day over cafes and r least likely to be found in a cafe unless the cafe does have something special about it). I think including certain classic Bengali snacks to the menu would be appreciated by all.
Abar Baithak has all the potential of becoming what The Coffee House is today for us Bengalis. Probably, some 30-40 years down the line when we grow older we'll have loads of memories woven around this Baithak-khana. :D

Indeed an awesome place. There's open seating area for smokers and another a.c section for non-smokers. The place is beautifully decorated with book stacks ( where books are both for sale as well as for reading), and several other pretty stuffs for home decoration as well for use. There's a carrom board placed right at the entrance and one can spend hours playing. For seating they provide you with chairs as well as bean bags ^_^ It  is a place mainly for "adda" and trust me specially at afternoons you can spend 3 to 4hours  there at a stretch with no one asking you to get up and leave!! Coming to the food, I must say, it's extremely healthy. They are particularly very careful about putting less salt and sugar in the items that you get there. Staff are very amiable and cordial and doesn't mind if requested to click 20 pictures at once :P would love to have  group "boithok" again at Abar Boithok. :D

Located near jodhpur Lake.. This Cafe has just about the right atmosphere for a cafe.. Quite a spacious place with both indoor and outdoor sitting setup.. The interiors are simple yet eye catchy.

The food here is quite decent and fresh.. The service is bit on the slower side though but understandable considering the rush at peak hours... The prices are quite cheap and affordable considering the prices of other known cafes across the town.. If you are with your gang this place is just about appropriate for you

This is the second time i visited this place within a month only because i liked it the very first time. The cafe is  spacious with comfortable sitting arrangements. The stack of books on one side is another thing that really attracted me. Then there are board games on which you can indulge yourself till your food arrives. Most importantly the food is good too. If you are a fan of sausages and salamis you can definitely order the chicken/meat platters. I also enjoyed having Tortilla Wraps, chicken sandwich. and coffee.. Good food, proper ambiance and reasonable prices. Overall it s  a nice place to hang out with friends. Hope to visit anytime soon!!!

Dropped by this neighborhood cafe 2weeks back on a Sunday evening...located in one of the bylanes of jodhpur park...

Seating here is a major issue as this place is always crowded.After waiting for a while me n my friend grabbed a seat...ordered for the choco chip muffin,blueberry muffin and hot cafe mocha as we weren't hungry.

The the muffins were freshly baked...had the right amount of sweetness and the coffee tasted good too...packed a few muffins for home too...

The place is ideal for adda,there are various artifacts n books for sale as well...perfect place for people of all ages to hang out.But I will b back to taste their savouries.

Ended up there with friends on a Sunday evening and with mum on another! In the first evening accommodation was a big issue, while the other day we walked right in.  To begin with, I was fascinated with the bookstore-reading room-coffee shop ambiance . For those interested, there's a selection of board-games! The sitting arrangement is haphazard with an assortment of Chairs, bean bags and sofas which gives the in-house feeling!  

Coming to the food,  the Spicy Mexican Hot Chocolate was a must try courtesy Zomato! It is for serious chocolate lovers like me. Now the twist is the spice, it awakens your taste buds and it responds with more attention to the chocolate. Full Marks. The Cafe Frappe was delicious. Now, the Chocolate Sandwich was a suggestion of the sweetheart owner and it tasted like heaven. I like the fact that they never compromise on the chocolate chips! :P I had the Ham and Bacon Baked Omelette, light fluffy and filled with ham, it is gorgeous! The Pudding with honey was good too! The Brownie with Chocolate and Ice-Cream was crumbly, dry and bland. Disappointment and so was the cold coffee. 

The place is good, I've already visited a couple of times, and definitely #WillVisitAgain #ThumpsUp! #Foodie

One of the very few places in the city which has the intention of keeping up with the fading away concept of "bangali adda" along with the hint of English breakfast. And bang on, they achieve in showcasing that yes both the extremes go well hand in hand. The ambience is really nice. And the food even better.

Well I came across this cafe in zomato. At last i visited this place when my friend insisted me that I should visit this place... Abar baithak is well decorated with with bookshelves, decorating stuffs, bean bags and table chairs. You can come here and relax and have adda with your buds.. Their food is also very good... We had fish finger which was very soft and tasted good, french fries, lemon tea, cucumber freezy, corn and cheese sandwich and chicken seekh kabab sandwich... The sandwiches tasted good with a good amount of cheese and stuff... The staffs are very cordial... I'm definitely coming back to this place...

The cafe is well decorated with bookshelf's and paintings and bean bags. The ambiance is a bit confusing because the look they wanted to get and the music they play in background is different. Need to get better music according to the theme. Service was slow and disappointing. The only good thing was the food. Reasonable and tasty. Now a days you dont get a cappachino in 60 bucks so that a good thing here. Needs a lot of improvement.

One of the most talked cafes in the recent times. Yes, it was through facebook that we got to know about this place. Being a lover of cafes, we set out to find this place. This place is located very close to Jodhpur park Boys School. A totally different ambiance they offer. With lots of books, carrom boards they are having a more to offer than the food. Seats are also of various kinds from those normal chairs to sofas to those bean bags. A variety of board games they offer. Menu is somewhat correctly prices. We tried out the chicken seekh kebab sandwich, capuccino and lassi. Won't say that the food taste is too sumptuous but still overall satisfied.

Known this place and people for more than 2 years now, ever since it was only "Baithak". And if only...they have grown better. Food is reasonably priced and filling. Ambience is friendly. homely so as to say. Cakes are the thing of experimentation. And turning out great. Mainly the chocolate ones. Try it for a great adda session..a relaxing time..good food..and great pics!!

A great find by my aunt who usually hangs out here with her friends...She insisted we visit one day and she took my parents there for lunch on 30th July...they obviously loved it, but forgot to take the pics, etc... So I urged to be taken this time around and that's what we did last Saturday. Reached around 3.30 for a late lunch and ordered the Chicken Platter for my Parents, All Meat Platter for myself,a Non veg bowl which is just some Chicken nuggets, corn-cheese nuggets, fries, etc...For dessert we had the Brownie with ice cream and hot chocolate and Affogato.. The food is good, prices good too.. Love the ambiance, the book shelves and knick-knacks. Interiors are warm and cosy and a great place to hangout... Hope to visit again soon!

Okay this place is super awesome... i had bookmarked it in zomato anek din aage... it was a sudden outing with one of my friends. And we both loved the place... ekhane prochur boi... which are not for reading and onky for sale... this was the part that we hated... except that its just like a bangali baithak khana where people give adda over some food. Talking about the food... the quantity is awesome... prices are cheap... we ordered a cold chocolate... brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce which tasted like heaven... and an all chicken platter... all of which accounted only upto rs 415. I couldnot believe myself. People working here are very polite as well giving us the homely ambience. This cafe is a good place to hang out. And last but not the least, they have really good taste in that back ground music thinģ.

After reading many a good review of this place I finally went there yesterday with a friend. I love hot chocolate and ordered the spicy mexican hot chocolate. The decoration on the cup was very pretty. But the first sip wasn't a jaw dropping one. It was made with milk and all my hopes of having thick chocolate was vanished. The cinnamon pieces weren't powered very well and they were getting stuck in between my teeth after every sip. They should make a proper powder of it. But when the last part started to come I was very happy. Below was the thick gooey chocolate I was looking for. Oh boy it was good. Then we had ordered a virjin mojitto. It was a very weird mojitto. Every time I have had one it contained basil leaves. But this one contained something which looked likee kalonji but once in our mouth it had a very sticky outer covering to it. The ambience is very nice. They have a huge book collection which one can buy and the plus point is that they have a very big open area with fans chairs tables so that one can sit outside and enjoy the place with a fag in hand.

Changing my review since the place has changed a lot since the last time I visited. Food is still the same. However, the pizza is not worth a try. The barbecued chicken pizza is an absolute waste. They have changed the decor a bit, the bean bags and relaxed ambience is no longer present. There's no books which one can casually pick up and go through a bit. The service is okay, except that they blamed us for their faulty card swiping machine initially.

Zomato helped me find this place. Was out with a few friends and this place popped in my head, and so we visited.

It was easy to locate. It had an extension outside, like a balcony, for those who'd like to be seated in fresh air. We chose to walk inside. The interior was amazing. They had a carrom board set up which customers can play on. They also had books and some other goodies on sale. It had a feel of a cool canteen/cafe. We were seated on beanbags.

We ordered cold coffee, iced tea, lassi, French fries and a chicken platter. The food was fairly good. Everything tasted well. And the ambiance was well suited for casual hangouts and catching up.

Would visit again sometime. Thumbs up from my side.

Its an awesome place to hang out and chill out with ur friends. Very reasonable  and very classic place. Try chicken salads, they make that very fresh.  I love coffee over there,they make it very nice and strong. Outer sitting zone very clam and nice.They has good book collection but unfortunately only for sale , u can't read over there. Try mango lassi , perfect blend of flavour and sweet. its looks like an old school vintage cafe.   They should repair their A.C. The walls of the room had cracks showing that not much of care is taken with respect to repairs . Although its,
Worth to visit,  try it once. 👍

Pros:: Nice hangout zone. Open seating for smokers. Nice interiors. Great display of books. Feel good place. Reasonable and tax free food.
Cons:: Location is a little complicated. Food options are not interesting. Portion is not that filling (based on a pudding and chicken platter). A bit too noisy for having peaceful talks.
Much much improvement needed overall. But definitely a commendable start up. Way to go! Worth a visit.

Directions - Straight ahead the sugar and spice lane followed by a left turn and then the first right and straight ahead. :) 

The food was amazing. Ordered chicken tortilla wraps which was one of the best wraps ever, not too cheesy.  Also Lemon iced tea and lassi. Everything was amazing but the best of the lot was the Affogato. 💟
Best dish - Affogato

From one Baithak to another, Abar Baithak is a nice coffee joint with some good food. The flavour of their coffee is good, though the frappé could have been thicker. The caramel coffee is just perfect and their ham sandwiches have just enough meat to be a good bite. Their tortillas are meaty and taste good but could use some veggies in them and  would sit better with some fresh salsa rather than ketchup. Also if you happen to sit at the table near the door be prepared to be bumped by people that come and go. I loved the fact that people of all ages come in and enjoy the place. The book shop, posters and handicrafts give it a unique feel. As a non-smoker I appreciate that there is a separate place for those who do. The staff are great and the owners too are friendly.

This place is located on the road of jodhpur park post office. After getting the directions by calling them , I visited this place with my wife on a drenched rainy afternoon. This place has a good outdoor seating but I preferred the indoor part. The inside is spacious with big sofa type chairs and bean bags. There is a carrom board on one side and lots of books on the wall racks (books are for sale). In a nutshell, a cozy and chilled out atmosphere that makes you come again with friends. We ordered for a full meat platter and baked chicken omlette. The service person was all smiles and helpful. The full meat platter was tasty, the omlette was tasty too but may be a little salt and spice would have made it perfect. All customers here were in no hurry and hence is a great place to sit, have food and chat. Definitely worth revisiting.

Frankly speaking the whole cafe seemed like one big happy family and it was really nice.

Kolkata based Gen Y is well known for their habit of Adda. We are experts when it comes to Adda. But with the super-development of real estates, a space crunch is taking place reducing places meant for Adda like tea shacks or roll-momo-cutlet shacks.
But Abar Baithak is at rescue. Much like our own living room or study, this place is absolutely marvelous. The collection of books is remarkable, most of them are in Bengali. (Books are sold too) And then there comes the burst of aroma from coffee beans and the heart yearning Wraps.
I met a friend there after a long time. We mainly had a cappuccino and a green apple mojito. I look forward to visit this "baithak-khana" pretty soon. Cause not only I love food, I love books too.
P.S if you are in the locality and have no idea what do next, visit this place just to sit back on a bean bag and sip Irish Coffee while reading some Bengali fiction.

The best thing about this cafe is the ambiance.It is very homely yet sophisticated.

Books,magazines, Carom, chess, music, television and bean bags make it exact place for hangouts..

The food was tasty yet not overpriced.The hospitality was really appreciable.
Heard that the cafe arranges for some entertainment programs on Sundays..

people who loves the idea of homely hangouts in a well organized place must visit it..

This comfortable cafe cum hangout place has created quite a buzz in South Kolkata. With lot of expectations, I went to this place along with my foodie friends this week. Though it's quite cheap, but food quality wasn't that good compare to other finger food joints in South Kolkata. But a 3.5/5 for their wonderful decor and arrangement of an 'addazone' with bookshelfs, carrom board and the bean bags. Visit this place for a long 'adda' with ur friends.

Located in the by-lanes of Jodhpur Park, Abar Boithak is a coffee cum adda place cropped up in South Kolkata attracting a lot of people. There are two sections here, one air conditioned non smoking section and another smoking section. There is also a carrom board, in case you are interested to play. The first time I went there was a sunday evening few weeks back and it was super crowded, so did not hang around much. Today a monday evening is comparison was much peaceful and tried an array of finger food there. I have had the Cold Coffee before and it was decent enough. Tried the chicken salad today which I liked personally. The chicken sandwiches are filling as well and come with chips. The fish fingers were a bit disappointing for me though. For drinks, had the Watermelon Fizz which was refreshing as well. But it was the ambience, with the beanbags and the adda that was nice. Prices are not that high and plays good music as well. Overall I give it 3.5/5

This has become like the new weekend haunt for me and my friends. The sandwiches are really good, specially the crab meat one. The tortilla wraps are pretty good too. But what I love about this place is that they make beautiful teas and desserts. The ginger honey tea is my favourite, and the chocolate cigar tea comes a close second. Their caramel pudding was basically homestyle caramel custard and their cheesecake is actually a red velvet with cream cheese frosting. And both of them take me to food heaven. With a carrom board, chess boards and adda-inducing bean bags strewn around, this place surely impressed me.

This is a place where you can hanging out with friends as long as you can. It has both inside air conditioning room for non smokers and a outside sitting for smokers. The place is a heaven for book lovers, there is a huge collection of book which you can read and if you want, you can buy it as well. There is a free WiFi connection over there. Including all this things the cost of food is very cheap they don't charge tax also. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. Now came to food we ordered Raspberry iced tea, cold coffee, baked chicken omelette, chicken platter and french fries. The iced tea and coffee was  average but there quantity is huge. Baked chicken omelette and chicken platter was amazing. Everyone should try there Chicken platter. And the Fry's was good but not that much.

The cafe is situated in a lane where car could be parked comfortably.
When we entered it, it felt like entering a college canteen. All the youngsters were there, and by their body language, it is evident that they come here often.
The sitting arrangement is comfortable. I wanted to try the bean bags but I knew my mother wouldn't be comfortable in it, so chose normal chairs.
I loved the collection of books. There is a huge variety of books which could be purchased. There are a few knick knacks too, but I did not find them interesting.
Now about the staff. They are nice and smiling but have a certain amount of informality about them which sometimes become too intimidating. Like I saw a staff trying acrobatic skill by jumping down a loft. Well, it disturbed me, but other people seemed to be oblivious of it. Maybe generation gap is showing its fangs.
About the food. Mom wanted a nice hot tea. I had suggested Darjeeling tea, but the maitre de table strongly suggested ginger honey tea saying that it was the best. I don't drink tea, so I won't be able to give first hand experience. But Mom did not like it. Actually being a regular tea drinker, she would have preferred black tea. This tea was weak and honey sweet and so did not meet her liking. I think Darjeeling tea would have been better.
Anyway, I chose for myself coffee yoghurt drink. It came in a large beer mug, and I loved every sip of it. It was simple but refreshing. The taste was of coffee together with the salty taste of yoghurt was a wonderful experience.
Now for food. We take veg food on Saturdays, so naturally we had to choose veg food here. This narrowed down the option to sandwich and tortilla wraps. I chose vegetable wraps. It came some 20 minutes later. But it was worth waiting. It was delicious. Nicely grilled, with sweet corns and mushrooms and cheese. Just the right amount of crunch and the taste was heavenly.
All said and done, I shall now state a few loopholes.Wraps should not be accompanied with fork and knives. You cannot eat a roll with a fork. This mistake several other cafes make, not only this one. There is no spoon accompanying it, so that the filling of the roll could have been scooped up and eaten. Another point. While serving food, they should have given us tissues which we had to request for. Why this happens with many other cafes I fail to understand. Do they buy very limited quantity of tissues or there is a permanent shortage of tissues?
Another important point. This is regarding washroom. It was clean, but, horror of horrors, the bolt was broken. Being an unisex washroom, it was a dangerous situation. It appeared from the regular comers that it had been in this state for sometime. I hope they repair it immediately.
Otherwise I liked the atmosphere and the food.

Amm..this is a hard one..coz they charge you 150 bucks for two pieces of bread and a bit of ice cream..on the other hand they let u hangout for hours!btw the best deal is the chicken platter..hands down(if you are looking for something filling)!has a very basic menu..maybe coz this is relatively new..

This is a cool place to hang out with your friends. This place is located near Allahabad Bank, Jodhpur Park. I got intrigued to visit this place after reading the review from Zomato. This place is so good and surely a better option for adda, for family get together, friends this place is just perfect. They have got a Carrom there where you can enjoy a board with your friends. Food items are well-tasty. Must try the Chicken Platter. The ambiance is simple and minimal, with tables, chairs and bean bags, as well as lots of books for sale. Overall  a perfect place for a hangout. Looking forward to more often visits.

Abar Baithak has got a homely feel to it which I absolutely love.
The carrom,bin bags and the tempting library of books(yes it's just a book-shelf) : all these make the place perfect for those hearty conversations with your best friend on a rainy afternoon in the warmth of your bedroom.
Just with good food for company.
There's outdoor seating arrangement too,if you want to have your coffee as you enjoy the rains.

Cold chocolate and french fries for munching over adda.
There's the meat platter if you are hungry.Please do not try the chicken salad.
And there's the affogato(brownie in ice-cream and coffee) if you want to go for dessert.The cakes,I haven't tried yet.

All-in-all the quality is good,if not great.It's been a few months.Hope to see more items on the menu.

We ordered :

~ veg tortilla wrap - crispy n good to eat with same stuffing of sweet corn, capsicum, mushroom n onions.. 
~ Cheese n corn sandwich - tasted amazing.. dish which was good compared to other two dishes ordered.. served with lays America flavour chips.. 
~ French fries - tasty n crispy served with chaat masala over it n tomato ketchup. .
~ cold coffee with ice cream - it was not upto the mark as was expected.. could have been more better. 
~ chocolate megrit with ice cream - it was jst ok.. not that great. . 
~ milk tea - it was superb.. strong tea as required

Its a good place to hangout with your friends , order tea ,coffe with pastries .. The ambiance is like a mixed feeling , one side of the room is decorated with books and items , the other side the walls are cracked and looks awful , the kitchen is visible which is kind of a downer , so mixed feelings about the the ambiance , but there is a carrom table so its a must visit for bengalis , the meat platter dish is a waste of money , the quantity is bad but the taste of it is standard , so order coffe have gala time with your friends one would like it , plus no tax .

Okay..so this was in my list for long and I finally visited this place a few days back. It is located right in the lane opposite to Jodhpur Park. It was raining and I was near Jadavpur when I suddenly decided to try out this joint. A whole bunch of young crowds is what I thought would mostly be occupying this place. But I was proven wrong as soon as I entered. 
It is extremely spacious with seating arrangement outside too for people who would want to enjoy a smoke with their evening tea or coffee with the lip-smacking finger food that they offer here. Nicely done interiors. It gives a feel of a modern day coffee house in Calcutta. 
And all you bookworms can also purchase books from here as they have a wide range of books on offer. Now coming to the food and coffee and more.. well I really enjoyed the coffee. I had first ordered for an espresso which they serve in shot glasses(interesting) then again not for the ones who do not like strong coffee. Then I had ordered two Cappuccinos and a Chicken Platter. The Chicken Platter was worth it! 
All in all a nice joint for people in south Calcutta if they are looking for a pocket friendly place and want to avoid the regular CCDs and Baristas.
Pocket Pinch: 350 for two! (Then again depends on what you order. Can be less or more than the quoted price because I quoted it as per my order)

Last evening was the first time I went to Abar Baithak and I was really impressed. It is a perfect place to relax with friends and family on lazy days. The food is good and prices are reasonable. One can also play board games like scarbble, ludo and carrom which is the icing on the cake....and they also have books,DVDs and paintings put up for sale. I would say there is a certain 'bangaliana' about the place. I have been to the place just once and I have no complains till now. :)

I am not a big fan of Coffee. My favorite is Darjeeling Tea 1st flush... with a bowl of assorted fries..

The taste of tea and food, Good music, and lovely ambiance is what one can get only and only in Abar Baithak.....   :) :)

I visited this cafe today amidst a lot of anticipation. Though it was a little difficult to spot due to some misguiding, it easily turned out to be one of the most beautiful evenings I spent in the recent times. I was a little surprised to see the hosts,as both were small screen stars quite a familiar face on bengali television. The beautiful ambience and decor just built up the ante. The food was top quality and the coffee was to die for! The staff were really hospitable, though the service was a little late. But with the kind of stuff one can do at that place with a carrom board and a wall stuffed with books, one can't complain much.Just wish they kept some books for reading as well, and just not for sale. A very spacious place with room for both a laid back bean bag style seating to a more sophisticated chair and table kind, it has a touch of variety. It's a "baithak" in the truest sense! My search for that perfect nook met with a beautiful destination today.Thank God for opening at such a location..South Kolkata was famished for a decent cafe! Great place, great job!

I went to the new outlet of Abar Baithak for the first time. The outlet is located in the second lane and away from the main road It was Saturday evening.. Almost all seats were full. The ambiance is handcrafted with different kinds of photographs, decorative items and books.. You can even buy the book or framed photographs and the decorative stuff. Seating is perfect. Air conditioning is also adequate. The young owners are personally present and work with the staff and have friendly chat with the customers when ever they get the opportunity.
We ordered for one first flush tea, one second flush tea and one coffee. The tea good and when they say first or second flush, they mean it. Coffee was good and piping hot? I have often found CCD and Barista coffee served without properly heating it. I had earlier tried their platter and can still recall the superb experience.They are priced slightly below CCD or barista. They definitely score head and shoulders above them in terms of overall experience. Once you try this place, you would want to come again and again.

Situated near Jodhpur Park, this gem of a place is one of the best places to laze around with some pretty good food and lots to 'adda'.

★ LOCATION : Along the lane beside Sugarr n Spice, take the second left turn (lane opposite Reliance Fresh) followed by the first right turn.

★ AMBIANCE : The ambiance is simple and mnimal, with tables, chairs and bean bags, as well as lots of books (for sale) and a carrom board for some fun time. You have two tables outside as well. Music plays most of the time. A soothing atmosphere.

★ FOOD & SERVICE : Food here is really good. The Chicken Platter consisting of Chicken Sausages, Chicken Salami, Chicken Ham, an Egg Poach (looked different) and Garlic Bread Toast was decent. However it was barely enough to satisfy one (I was REALLY hungry then).
The French Kiss and fresh lime soda, especially the latter, in their huge mugs are all-time favorites. The overall pricing is absolutely reasonable.
The serving time is edged on the higher side, but as mentioned previously, you are most welcome to sit, laze and chat for the entire afternoon and evening. :)

Cost for two : 250 - 400.
I'd definitely recommend it. :)

First things first fish fingers were finger licking gud.
Cake was awesome but bit too costly for a slice.
sandwich was cold and chicken filling was not fresh ass well as the veggies inside it.
Crowd and ambiance is very nice.I will definitely suggest my friends to go here.
Spl playing ludo or scrabble with friends brought back old memories.

A nice cosy place in the middle of residential area in Jodhpur Park.However it may be really difficult for you to find out the restaurant.

Ambience- Nice laid back atmosphere with bean bags and books around.This is the place where quintessential Bengali comes for their everyday dose of "addas".

Service- I really can't comment on their service for we went for breakfast and the owner of the Cafè was busy in cooking and serving.We didn't find any staff back then.

Food-The Irish Coffee was nice if not the best.The coffee was better than that of regular CCD fare.The Frittata was delicious but was extremely spicy.It was not an authentic Spanish Frittata however it was not bad either!Overall our experience was quite good.
If you are in real need of some good 'adda' over a cup of coffee and some finger food,you can definitely come here.
The place is extremely peaceful and decent considering the locality(Jodhpur Park).Give CCD a miss and come here once.You won't be disappointed.

If you want to relax over a cup of coffee or a chilled glass of mocktail and have a good adda session with your friends, this is the place for you. Bean bags, couches and chairs with round tables, you have 3 types of sitting arrangement. They have racks full of books which are displayed for sell.

The mocktails come in long fat beer mugs and are very refreshing. Apart from them I just had the c chicken platter. But the latter was an utter disappointment. Cold sausages, chicken hams and chicken salamis with 2 pieces of cheese toast is not something you'll love to have. 

Hopefully the other dishes will be better. Will try them with time :)

Now this one's a hidden treasure (kind of).
If you are a resident of Jodhpurpark, no other place can be better for a hangout with your friends and family.
The place is spacious, varied and there's a feel good factor about it. And you can always try your hands on the carrom board.
The only thing is that the cold coffees weren't cold enough, and the hot ones weren't hot enough.

Huge disappointment. Only good thing about it is the bookshop but I didn't like it that all the books were only for sale and not for reading. The atmosphere is very pseudo-intellectual and not fun at all. It is rather grim. The staff was friendly but in spite of asking for 5 rupees change (which we would have given if asked), they directly gave us a pack of Orbit because they did not have change. I did not like this. We had ordered one chicken platter.  The portions were very little. The poached egg was not poached at all. It really had a boiled egg yolk inside the egg white, just like a normal boiled egg. The sausages were horrible and  my friend actually refused to eat them after one bite. My other friend and I had to eat her portion and then we did not dare order anything else. The menu prices are tax-inclusive. We did not feel well after coming out of the place because of the food quality. We are still sick.

Need a place to just sit and play a game of chess? Or scrabble? Or read by yourself? Or work on your laptop? Along with amazingly light food and tempting desserts? Abar Baithak is the place for you, mate.

DO NOT miss out on their meat platters. Light, healthy and beautiful. Try their desserts. I went back thrice in two days for their coffee chocolate cake and probably was the one to finish almost half of the full cake. And their dessert portion sizes are huge, mind you. No regrets. I plan to try out their pudding next, because custards are the bane of my existence in terms of how they tempt me.

Brilliant place. Friendly staff. The owners are humble and often end up cooking or taking orders, and are really sweet. If you belong to the entertainment industry in any way, you might end up meeting half your work buddies here though. :) But. No complaints. Can't wait to go back. :)

Update 26/05/2015: Their pudding is brilliant. I swear I want more. So bad.

Always wanted to visit the initial rendition of 'Baithak' at Mudiali, and was immensely upset when I got to know that I was too late. So you can imagine how ecstatic I must have felt when 'Abar Baithak' (and how fitting the name is!) reopened at just a 10-minute walking distance from my home!

Sunday night around 8.15 was the time chosen to gobble things up! The decor is cozy and kept at its bare minimum... and I like things when they're not too posh. Gives a laid-back homely feeling... good job done there! And I love to see books all around me.... keeps me at peace. Tried a little carrom... and spotted a Ludo board! Is there Chess? If no, it must be included. In all, loved the ambiance! As for the food, me and my friend wanted a filling meal and went for:

1. Irish Coffee and Ginger Honey Tea
2. Chicken Platter
3. Chicken Salad
4. Chicken Ham Sandwich

The items were good and tasty for sure...! If I have to pick my favorite... I'll surely go with the Irish Coffee. But you might be wondering why something as filling as the Chicken Platter is on the 2nd spot on the list and the sandwich came in last. This is because that's the way it was served.

The owners need to make sure that the staff members are well versed with basic restaurant rules. When the menu is so extensive, it's natural for customers to expect food in the ascending order (I mean, the lightest one first and the heaviest one last). Moreover, for a Sunday night, the attendance was quite moderate! I had to tell the staff to clean our table three times and still it went unheard. The Irish Coffee was served on a dirty table! It was finally cleaned when I had to be a little rude (I highly detest doing it) and refused to accept anymore items on the table.

For Swaralipi & Shoumo: If I'm not wrong, 'Baithak' had some fancy and innovative Bengali names given to most of the dishes. Why don't you guys reintroduce it? And the location is perfect this time! You guys are going to get a great footfall undoubtedly!
On a serious note, however, what retains a business is the amount of returning customers. The buzz will bring in people... but they'll just come for a one-time visit if they stumble upon something unpleasant. 'Abar Baithak' has started off on a high note... please do not let the reputation fall!

One word for this joint is WOW. One of my friends was back to city after one year and we wanted to hang out. I found this joint on zomato itself. It is located near jodhpurpark lake, close to allahabad bank. It has both outdoor and indoor seating facilities. A carrom board is placed at the entrance in indoor section. Several bean bags, comfortable couch, sofas and chairs are there. I loved the décor. Being a book lover, i was pretty impressed with the collection which was displayed at book shelf covering an entire wall. Very spacious and well light interior. We ordered water melon fizz, green apple mojito, chicken and ham sandwich and ham and bacon baked omelette. I just loved both the drinks. Both were refreshing and tasted awesome. Sandwich was served with chips and tomato ketchup. It was fresh,grilled and good in taste. But what i loves the most is the omelette. It was so soft, ham was well cooked and it was oil free and so tasty. Service was good and price was reasonable. As the name goes "abar baithak" , I'm going to visit again.

Cosy ,casual, comfortable … that a synoptic overview of this café in jodhpur park area (near reliance fresh and Allahabad bank) . I have been to this place quite a number of times and I just cannot get enough of the buzz of camaraderie that fills this place . Food particularly their meat/chicken platter lemonade and cucumber cooler are my favourites .  Prices are easy on your pocket and you end up having yet another book/carom/ludo /food /friend filled session .

Tucked in a quiet corner of Jodhpur Park, Abar Baithak is a lovely little cafe with no frills but yet manages to stay with you long after you've stepped out of the whitewashed room! There's an extremely casual vibe to this place which makes it perfect for the young and the free (and the often-broke). Bean bags strewn around, a carrom and ludo boards add to the homely yet appealing look of the place! The bookshelf is well stocked and the souvenirs are lovely! Now coming to the food, we ordered:
1. 3 fresh lime sodas.
2. 1 chicken tortilla wrap.
3. 1 veg tortilla wrap.
4. 1. Ham and bacon frittata.
5. Brownie with vanilla ice cream and  chocolate sauce.
Right from the start, our sodas thoroughly impressed us, followed by the wraps(the chicken wrap was loaded with chicken and sausage and it was delicious!) and the frittata, which was absolutely sumptuous! We finished our meal with a brownie, whose texture was a bit tough but delicious nevertheless! The icing on the cake is the fact that it is reasonably priced and the quantity is good enough for 1 person.
A late night text saying "abar abar Baithak jete hobe! Oshadharon!" is proof to the fact that its here to stay! :)

To be succinct, I am in love with this place. Hopelessly. It's been three weeks or so, since I was recommended the place by my sister and I've already checked in 9 times. That says it all, doesn't it? 

Located on the spacious ground floor of the owner's home, one can spend hours here and never be bored. From books that can read and bought, board games and carrom to simple, great café food. 
Though they are updating their present menu, their Chicken Platter, Cold Chocolate and Lemonade stands out. 

The drinks come in huge tumblers and very refreshing. Since most of the food available here are finger food and one can linger here for hours, it is the perfect place to come and relax with your friends. :)

Four of us went to this place to spend a lazy rainy Sunday. This place gave me a homely vibe with all those books bean bags etc. The staffs are very friendly. We ordered chocolate float which was yummy, cold coffee which was good, chicken frittata which was very tasty, a black forest cake which was average and a muffin which was not at all good( -.5 for the muffin ). Overall I felt they serve good food and beverages but they need to improve the muffins and cakes.
I will visit this place but for food only. Price is reasonable but I felt bad when I paid Rs90 for that muffin.

This cosy outlet, tucked between the many lanes of Jodhpur Park, might be slightly challenging to locate. But once you reach there, you'll not regret. This cafe surely lives up to it's name. It does remind you of a boithok-khana, lined with bookshelves, and decorated with photographs. Sitting arrangements vary from comfortable sofas, to formal tables to soft bean bags. The whole place has a laid back atmosphere, just like the city of Kolkata!

Food here is decent, it neither blows off your mind, nor disappoints you. It leaves you content. We had ordered a chicken n ham salad, the meat platter, an ice tea and a fresh lime soda. Salad was fresh, tasty and generously loaded with meat. The meat platter was just fine, nothing great.

All in all, it's a place to chill with friends on a lazy summer evening, or grab a cup of coffee over a good book. I bet you will enjoy.

One fine February evening, when we were itching for our caffeine fix, Abar Baithak (which is situated quite close to our usual meeting point) came to our rescue. A bit hard to locate at first, this place oozes coziness from every nook and corner: with plush sofas, plump bean bags, huge cushioned cane chairs along with a really pleasant outdoor seating arrangement; its charm would sweep anyone off their feet. Hit numbers from MJ and Guns n Roses playing in the backdrop completed the ambience of the place. We hit a pair of bean bags as soon as we got in, and after having placed our (pre-paid) orders for an Irish coffee and Berrycino started browsing through the enormous bookshelf that they've kept stacked with paperbacks from a variety of genres. They keep a nice stock of board games as well and quite interestingly have used a water drum to make a make-shift stand for a carom table.

Coming to our orders, the Irish coffee was made exquisitely and was served unstirred and untouched. We could easily distinguish between the three layers in the glass: hot dark coffee, clear caramel of the liqueur and a swirl of thick white whipped cream. The flavours were spot on. The berryccino was eccentric on its own right: thick, frothy, milky, tangy and filled with bits of berries, tasting precisely how it should.

Incidentally, we participated in a Valentine’s Day special contest that they were hosting, and were lucky enough to win! A huge dark-chocolate and coffee cake waited for us on our second visit, courtesy of the nice owners, and I have to honestly say it was one of the best cakes that we’ve ever had. The sponge cake was soft, moist and the delicious layers of coffee and dark chocolate cream left us scooping out the minutest of dregs from the bottom of the container.

On our most recent visit, we tried out their chicken platter with a mochaccino and a café au lait. While the mochaccino was strong and laced with chocolate syrup on top, the café au lait (coffee with hot milk) was less pronounced but was quite nice. The chicken platter is a very simple dish composed of portions of sausages, salami, poached egg and cheese with bread; just right to fill up a hungry tummy. While the meat portions were perfectly made, we felt that they could’ve improvised on the dip and the cheese on toast.

The servers were extremely friendly and courteous on all our visits, and the prices were also fairly balanced keeping in mind the quality and quantity of food. This place stands out further because they keep on hosting interesting events every Sunday morning, be it jam sessions or poetry readings, magic performances (which we attended) and even talk shows. A superb spot to while away a lazy afternoon over coffee and books, you’ll be sure to re-visit this place again to once more have that guaranteed jomjomat baithak.

Visited this place twice after it got renovated last year. The Tiramisu Coffee (both hot and cold) is a timeless favourite & a must try for all. I was quite happy to see more food items on their menu. Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce and Garlic Prawns were 2 dishes that wooed M heart.

A new place in Jodhpur Park, this is one of cafes which aims to become synonymous with "Adda" and to become a hangout zone for most of the student crowd from Jadavpur. 

I went there today with a couple of friends and seated ourselves in the comfy bean bags that they have set up. These bags are great for sitting down but damn hard to get up from esp after one of their filling milkshakes! We ordered the Blueberry Tornado, Iced Tea, Kiwi Milkshake and Chicken n Ham Sandwich.. The drinks minus the Iced Tea were decent, they give it in large mugs, quite justifying the price point at which they are offered.
The sandwich was loaded with chicken n ham and very tasty. Altogether, this place was a good discovery.

There are rows of books lining the place, however they are mostly for sale. There is also Bengali music playing all the time and shows like Didi No. 1 are shown on the TV.

There is also a smoking area outside the cafe so this place caters to both the crowds.

What can I say, I loved the place. On lazy Sunday afternoon, after a party night, went over to this cafe sorta outlet in the area with a few friends. There were a lotta people inside the premises which made us a little apprehensive. However, the friendly waiter ushered us in. And I instantly fell in love with the place. So used to the cold clamour of the CCDs and Batista's, this was a mild surprise. It is a great joint that dreams Bengali adda on lazy summer afternoons or chilled out evenings. There is bangaliana written all over. And don't be mistaken by the decor, the easy casual ambience into thinking that the fares on the menu won't meet your expectation. The food is amazing. We ordered the Moroccan Mint tea, cold coffee and a Chicken platter. And loved it all. The bonus, it is pocket friendly too. On the flip side, we were able to catch a cultural event taking place there. Thanks to Abar Baithak, got to enjoy Rabindrasangeet, cold coffee-moroccan tea, cheese- sausages and the famous bangali adda all at one go. So much for fusion, hah! 
My rating. Loved it. Definitely going back again. Hopefully. Sometime when some other cultural event is going on.

I dropped in hre with a friend about two days back. Locating it wasn't tough to start with.Here's what I had to say about this place.
Ambience: probably the best thing about this place : Both indoor and outdoor seats,the carrom board and Decked up board games,and a huge collection of books on the shelves - starting from chetan bhagat and probably nt even ending at Rays. :) The settings won me over.
Food : average. TheChicken platter was bland , enough to give us a disappointing start. The Orange mojito, and an amazing red velvet cheesecake were the ones that saved the Name.
Service : courteous ,friendly and informative. The owner was a pretty sweet lady too :)
Pocket pinch : not worth the quality of food here. A bit of dissatisfaction here.
Visit again? : maybe.
In a jig, the place is a fresh hub in the south of the city to sit and do the daily dose of evening adda. A good place for college goers for a one time visit or two. :)

Located in the heart of Jodhpur Park, close to the Jodhpur Lake, Abar Baithak promise you a great ambience, super coffee, exquisite choice of tea and of course a wide array of deli, savouries and 'little eats'. The ambience is a little different from the other 'retail' coffee shops... The mini book store offers a great selection of books too... Spend a lazy evening here and you will exactly know why I reiterate the warmth and friendliness of this coffee shop. The avid tea lover would love this place. Choose from first or second flush darjeeling tea or the wide range of tea this place has to offer, order the brownie of your choice and simply take time to let yourself soak into the ambience. A small art gallery is also there . Moreover there is an open smoking area too...

Abar Baithak is twice the space and four times the fun because they have a carrom board and we played a couple of rounds in it in between our food. My cup of cappuccino was strong and flavorful and the chicken sandwich was filling, tasty and juicy, topped with potato chips. My friend loved the black coffee here.

So I've been to Abar Baithak a couple of times now-and it seems to be just the cosy,pocket friendly hang-out zone that South Calcutta was so lacking in. The ambience is nice and warm,especially with the carrom board up front and the board games available. The abundance of books on shelves with bean bags around are always a perfect match with the smell of coffee,and I'd give Baithak a perfect score for their ambience and set up.
Coming to food, they have a limited menu, but the pros to that is that it doesn't confuse you much. I've had the chicken salad and the meat platter on the few occasions I've been there,and they seem quite reasonable for their portions. The drinks are served generously as well, and their mocha is quite amazing. The fresh lime soda however, has been a personal favourite to beat the heat.
Service is a little slow,but Baithak is one place I love going back to for their chilled out yet warm atmosphere. Thumbs up for these guys! :)

Changing my review because of their disgusting high handed behaviour. They won't let you sit upstairs even if the downstairs seating is full. On top of that they behave so badly. I live next door and went here on a Sunday morning for a coffee, left with only a bitter taste in my mouth thanks to their attitude . I will never go again.

It needs a good sweep on its floor and good dusting on the chairs. There is dust everywhere. Hence we found it very unhygienic. We just had tea and cookies. Please make the place hygienic. The red floor should shine to give a good feeling. Not going back as it gave my friend dust allergy.

After 4 visits to Abar Baithak, I finally managed the time to write a review for them. 
Quaint and warm are the first two things that entered my mind on my first visit here. Abar Baithak might be a little difficult to locate amidst the lanes of Jodhpur Park but once you're in, it is a delightful experience. The decor is wonderful with beautiful paintings hung on the wall. One exceptional painting of 'Apu' , Satyajit Ray's creation, is bound to attract your attention. Not only will you find board games like Chinese Checkers, chess, carom but also a huge cabinet full of books for those who need a nice read with their coffee/tea. It surely did receive one extra points for the books from me. 
Another added advantage of Abar Baithak is the space. It is delightfully spread across a vast area , so no problem if the conversation from the other table is a little loud. It also has an outdoor seating facility. 
Coming to the food, no complains with the quality or the quantity. I have tried the chicken salad, chicken platter, chicken sandwich, Irish coffee, Cold Frappe  and Cold coffee. And, I have loved them all. The service might be a tad bit slow on some days but the staff are cordial and prompt. 
So, for those who are bored of CCDs, Baristas and all other cafes, this is a cool place to check out.

This place reminds me one of the finest Farooq Shaikh movies " Listen.. Amaya". In that film, there was a cafe called " book a coffee". Yes, nice name and nice concept. For all book lovers and those who likes casual chat over a cup of coffee, that place was great.
 "Aabar Baithak" probably took that concept to the next level by putting chess board, Carrom board and some other playing stuff along with books, making it enjoyable for all kinds of people, ranging from 8 to 80. Nice, neat and simple interior with a huge snugly sitting place.
Now comes the  food. We tried both the platters. I like the sausage and cheese toast. Nice and soft with cheese filled in it. It was awesome. Irish coffee was tasted very nice so did the Moroccan mint tea.  Frittata  and chicken sandwich were delicious and good respectively. :P
Beautiful Place - Definitely worth visiting. I would say pocket friendly place. We ordered "All meat platter and chicken platter along with Irish coffee and Moroccan mint tea" for Rs 550.
Great experience, will definitely visit again. 4.5/5 for me.

It was a good decision ,the food and drinks were good and fresh with reasonable prices .It also had a selection of books you pick to read or buy, the selection isn't great but idea is good . Another neat feature is that they have a carom board and two ludo boards in case you wanted to play. A nice touche .

Was looking for a coffee shop near Jodhpur park when I came across this. The moment I entered the place, there was a smell of damp. It seemed that the place was  shut for ages. So I preferred sitting outside. Since I was new to this place, I really did not want to experiment . So I ordered for  a Kokum Sharbat (juice) and my friend

A very cozy place tucked away in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park.
Perfect place to hangout with your friends as they provide indoor games too.
The place is spacious enough and there is outdoor seating also,watch out for the special Chicken fritata.
Nice Darjeeling tea as well,its a kind of place which is very rare in Kokata.
A place sticking to the old warm charm as well as providing you cleaner interiors and very tasty food.

One of my favorite places in the city. It's an amazing cafe to hang out! Be it on a date, a tete-a-tete with my friends or mom, or a casual hangout, I'd always prefer baithak!  The food is amazing and the recipes are all by the cafe owner, Shoumo. The cafe is a culmination of his and his wife, Swaralipi's efforts!!!
The coffee is amazing! A healthy exception from all the mainstream places in the city! The hot chocolate is a must try as well as the cookies! 
The sandwiches are amazing and so are the tortilla wraps! The fish sandwich deserves a special mention! I've never had something like that before!! Not only is the menu great for a light eat but it's amazing for a scrumptious feast also!
Recommended: fish sandwich. Coffee. Kokum sharbat. Tortilla wraps. Hot chocolate. Pudding. Brownie. The chocolate cookie.
There is also a carom board and other games for guests to play!
The staff is friendly and chances are that after 2 or 3 visits they'd remember you.
With a huge space and a simple decor plus a homely ambience, Abar baithak is all you ever need as the perfect cafe for all purposes!!
The current Usp right now is that every Sunday they organise a live performance of some sort. Be it a recitation or a singing one, that sure draws crowds! 
A must visit for all.... Enjoy!! :)
