I frequently order grilled cheese and vegetable sandwich, burger and wraps. They are but budget-friendly and when you are enjoying your visit in the supermarket, you can grab a bite to fill your stomach.

Vegetarian outlet near carnival cinema.
Small eatery with no seating arrangement located right on the side of Broadway mall serving pasta, pizza, burger, wraps and other snacks. Being a veg outlet, the choices are limited. However, the price is cheaper as compared to other similar outlets nearby. Serving time is a bit high. And quality is okay. Only cash is accepted. Card not accepted.

The only dish i liked was veg cheese hawaiian burger and veg grill mexican sandwich with extra cheese. Their cheese burst pizza was not bad either. But the rest arent that impressive as is the hype around it. The paneer that they use is put into the sandwich/burger as it is. Would have been better if they were properly grilled/roasted/sauted. Its modelled as a street food corner so one cant complain for the lack of seats to sit and eat. Pricing is really good for those which I liked. One suggestion, try to keep another option of offering white breads in sandwiches along with brown breads. Some people have their own set of preferences and will appreaciate your efforts of pleasuring them even further!! :)
Overall, its alright to visit this stall once in a while!

The burgers here are amazing. I visited this place once and ordered the veg cheese Hawaiian burger. I was a bit reluctant as I don't like veg burgers much but this one surprised me. One of the great veg joints and pocket friendly.

Lovely outlet.. it's just a small stall like thing, but offering amazing food and shakes for such a small space.. you have food on go, wraps, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, shakes, smoothies. Whatever we had all was amazing, and they serve everything with a portion of fries. Pizza sandwich was cool, with pizza base in place of bread.. hawain Burger with a slice of pineapple inside a burger.. its a nice joint for quick grab of fast food.

Located jus outside big bazar/carnival cinemas. Infront of ccd.Was very hungry after a movie and as things are exorbitantly charged inside the theatre, opted to eat here. A corn grilled sandwhich, a veg cheese burger and a mango shake. The sandwhich came with chips and ketchup, same for burger. The sandwhich was 4 in number,two big breads cut into 4,burger was standard. Shake was not so good.
No seating available, you have to stand and eat.

It's located near big bazaar, sector 3. Basically,it's only for snacks, u can also have breakfast. What they have, they are perfect in it. Although they should increase items in babycorn. They only have chilly babycorn. Two things that I don't like is that there is no seating available and they only have vegetarian food items. They should innovate more items in veg as well as they should introduce non veg food items.

Saw good reviews for this place hence me and my friend went to this small shop after movie.
We ordered 2 veg cheese grilled sandwich, cold coffee and mango shake.
The sandwich was cut into 4 pieces and had mayo and not cheese firstly. I did not like the sandwich at all still I had 2 as I was hungry and asked them to pack the other 2. There was this tall guy in the shop he told hum pack nahi karenge aapko box dedenge aap karlo..I heard this kind of stuffs for the first time from a person when asked to pack so I had no option but silently take the box and pack it for myself coz I hate wasting food.
Mango shake literally had sugar crystals in it and was too sweet where as cold coffee had no sweet in it so again negative points for both the drinks.
I found nothing to visit this place again.
Not at all recommended !!

Snax Point is really a great place for snacks. The sandwiches and burgers have the right balance of sauce and veggies. The food is quite cheap and is recommended for quick bites. The potato fries served along with sandwiches is great. I have tried Blackcurrant Shake which was good too.
Approximate cost for 2 -Rs 150/-

This small eatery selling vegetarian snacks is located right next to the big bazar CCD outlet , beside Chaurasia Chaat ! The place is easily spotted, and it's bound to be your favourite spot once you realize that they make amazing grilled sandwiches at pocket friendly prices !! The veg cheese sandwich here is served with chips and regular tomato sauce , and the four pieces of bread cut into four sandwiches are sure to make your  tummy happy on one of those super hungry evenings. The paneer tikka sandwich too is good , with a similar dose of chips and sauce. They don't have a seating area , but you can use the stools places outside the shop to sit and eat. They can also pack your favourite sandwich if you wish to carry one of these darlings home. The service is quick and the kitchen is open , so you can watch good food being made right in front of you. Do hop in if you wish to green , with happiness of course !

Located outside Broadway Mall, a place frequented commonly by young people for snacks and the like, as the name Snax Point suggests.
Ordered their Veg Cheese Burger and Paneer Tikka Grilled Sandwich via Zomato, when a sudden food craving hit me hard one evening.
The burger was a wholesome big item, enough to replete one's stomach owing to the thick-sized sesame buns. It was stuffed with vegetable fillings and a generous portion of soft cheese.
The set of four sandwiches were made of fresh paneer, and had that tangy tikki flavour and feel to them.
The two food items were accompanied with two small packets of potato crisps, two satches of tomato ketchup and paper napkins.
Overall not a bad choice to grab a quick bite or for  some snacky meal.

Nobody for sure should say it is cheap but some may say it is reasonable and some may say it to be on higher side. For me except for a few things the price was reasonable.

Can't deny that Snax Point is one of those pocket friendly places. Located outside Broadway Mall, Sector 3 is this small place on the side of a road. Although the prices are reasonable, neither hygiene nor quality is maintained. I ordered their Butterscotch Milkshake. Again, a very reasonably priced item however the shake was way too sweet for my taste. It was almost as if they accidentally poured half a cup of sugar. An ideal place for people running low on money or are looking for a quick bite; not the best place to look for tasty food.

Located at the ground floor of Carnival Cinemas besides Big Bazaar in Salt Lake. This is a pure vegetarian food joint serving great sandwiches, pizzas & burgers. Their chocolate brownie is a must try. Staff's is very diligent & often helps you to choose items from their huge menu card.

The prices are nominal & pocket friendly.

Would highly recommend this place!

It is a small outlet located at the ground floor of the building of Big Bazar and Carnival Cinemas in Salt Lake Sector 3. Basically it is a give-away outlet, with no seating arrangements of their own. They just have stools to sit outside in the footpath.
Day before yesterday, I was there at the Carnivals for a late night film, and being late (as usual) for the film, I skipped dinner. Seeing this outlet there, I thought of quickly munching something because I was in no mood for the popcorn, nachos and cola at the theatres. 
I went through their menu, which was quite elaborate. They basically serve shakes, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, etc. I ordered a combo of a Veg. Sandwich and a Shake alongwith. 
The Sandwich was served hot, with tomato ketchup and mustard sauce. Also, potato chips were served along with it. The sandwich was a grilled one, with adequate amount of veggies, corn, mayonnaise/cheese in it. It was divided in four pieces and served. It tasted good. And as it was grilled and made of brown bread, it adds up to the healthiness too. I was satisfied with it.
The shake, however, was disappointing. I had chosen a Choco Nutty Shake. But the shake which was served did not have any bits and traces of any kind of nuts. Moreover, it tasted very pale, with a very meagre taste of chocolate. It was very thin and watery. Only the chocolate sauce that was added helped me to sip it few times. (Thank God that the chocolate sauce was there!)
The dishes were priced at quite affordable rates. A cheap joint. The service was fast, and the concerned people were good in conduct and cooperative.

This is a small all VEG food joint located in front of Saltlake Bigbazar. I have tried out their club as well as grilled sandwiches and shakes. Their quality and quantity of sandwiches are really good. They are really very well stuffed with vegetables,sauces etc. They serve them with potato chips which makes the sandwiches even more attractive.
I found their shakes to be average.

BUT I would have been more happy if they would have served NON VEG sandwiches/burgers as well.

I swear by the veg corn sandwiches. The sandwich is grilled and loaded with mayo, corn, chopped onion & capsicum. The sandwich comes with a handful of potato chips and a dip of tomato and mustard sauce. The taste is simply awesome! Their shakes are also decent.

A great place to grab a quick bite if you feel hungry in the area.¬†

i m a "almost" regular customer of this joint ... & I found this place on a click right away ven 1 goes to watch a muvi @ kulraj (now CARNIVAL CINEMAS). this small joint is located just near to tht. v did not try several items at the begining time...but then v ordered veg cheese burger & paneer sandwich.... & i must say - since den i am in love wd thr burgers. ppl m8 find it weird...bt the veg cheese burger dey serve here...is just so heavenly & fab in taste...tht I personally forgot mc-donalds ! d patty inside the burger ws crisp n hot with fresh veggies... a melted cheese slice in between - & lots of mayo @ just 60/- !!! now thts a pocket frndly yumm deal ! & not forgetting the paneer sandwich - it ws well prepared ... with good amount of soft paneer pieces inside with correct amount of cheese and herbs.. ! 
kudos to this place :) a must visit for evry1 if u r in tht area :)

Small kiosk with good vegetarian food.Sandwiches are nice,so are the pizzas.The cost is somewhat high compared to the portion size.The club sandwiched are a must try.

A small place of box of food which serves variety of food like burgers, pizzas sandwiches and they are pocket friendly too. There preparations are really good. A good place to have veg snax while hanging out.

Location: Outside Downtown Mall (adjacent lane); Beside CCD.

The much heard of kiosk, Snax Point was finally visited on April 28, 2015 after a movie at Carnival Cinemas (Downtown Mall). It isn't anything more than a takeaway counter with a just a couple of seats and a non-descript d√©cor.

They have a widespread fare which includes burgers, sandwiches, pasta, pizza and shakes: The following was ordered from their range of sandwiches and burgers:

- Veg. Cheese Burger
The burger had a flavorful aloo patty sandwiched along with slices of tomatoes, onion and cheese.
Tasted good. Was served along with local wafers, ketchup and mustard sauce on the side.
Recommended.

- Paneer Tikka Grill Sandwich
The Sandwich was a complete disappointment.
The succulent paneer cubes were bland (the 'tikka' flavor was nowhere to be found), the veggies (tomato, onion, capsicum) mixed with mayo had overpowering flavors and the sandwich was over-grilled (nearing the burnt variant!).
The sandwich has a huge scope of improvement.
Served along with local wafers, ketchup and mustard sauce on the side.

The polite and well-informed staff did serve at a brisk speed.
Prices were found to be reasonably set.

Overall a decent experience.
- Yet to try the remaining fare, comments due.

Nice sandwiches with generous amount of cheese and mayo. Good on pocket, not very expensive. Service is pretty fast. All in all very nice place to have a change of taste.

Amazing burgers and sandwiches! Though the milkshakes are not that great, the veg cheese Burger and cheese garlic bread are very very tasty! The availability of non veg burgers and sandwiches would make this joint irresistible!

If you are at Broadway (now Carnival Cinemas), then you should definitely try out the Veg Cheese Burger from Snax Point! It's just super awesome! Cheese Garlic Bread is also worth mentioning . But the Burger is the real deal people!! Enjoy!

I used to laugh at the idea of a vegetarian burger until I tasted the cheese burger here. Came back for seconds. And thirds. Other snacks are good too, but not the shakes.

I found this small place few weeks back and since then I have visited them twice. This humble snacks joint has so many things to offer and you surely can't have them all in just one visit. I had tried their Black Current Shake and some aloo tikki last time. The Shake was nice with crushed ice and subtle taste, though I would have loved a tad stronger flavour maybe with bit more syrup and essence in it, also topping it with some dry fruits would have been great! But anyway I loved what I had, also it was too easy on the pocket. Next I would love to come back and try their burgers and sandwiches and I'm sure I'll love them.

Cheers!

When at Carnival Cinema for a movie or just at Big Bazar for a little shopping, this is a go to place. It doesn't come off all inviting but one who dares to visit this joint, surely comes back. Right next to CCD, they serve far better sandwiches and burgers than CCD. I tried a sandwich with a really long name, something with Italian in it, and it tasted so nice. I thought they would be stingy about the mayonnaise so I asked to put extra, and oh the pleasant surprise... It was raining mayo in my mouth. Then the other day I ordered a cheese burger. Perfectly done buttery bun, nice, crisp and fresh veg patty, and the some sauce, which I think was barbeque. I thought its a little small for rs.100 but was good nonetheless. And their pizzas, if you are a mozzarella lover, you will like it, otherwise its just like a normal homemade pizza, nothing so great about it. And did I mention it's purely veg? Oh yes it is.

Fun munching snacks there.. The pizza they delivered to my plate was an amazement tasted too too good.. Price is reasonable and food quality is great.. The menu is good enough for a small food joint and serving is very speedy.. A must try for all.. No seating space then on path but worthy engaging..

Would highly recommend the veg cheese burger and choconutty shake. Looking forward to exploring other options in the menu.
