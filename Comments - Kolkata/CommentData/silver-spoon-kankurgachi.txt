I went there yesterday with friends.It is actually a very good and popular place for food for the Beleghata-Phoolbagan residents.Ambience is good. But, the place is a little short.Very good service.We ordered :Mixed Fried Rice : Very tasty (full of chicken , egg and prawns), good in quantity.Chilli Chicken : average. Actually, the bones in the chicken kinda ruined the taste.Friendly Staffs.Much pocket-friendly.

Enjoyed the food!

Little place....busy restaurant...quality of food is on the verge of declining ....
They are awesome for all kind of rolls....not a place for quality food lovers...its a place where you visit in situations like returning from tution,office,college etc and think of having a roll.

Since my aunt stays in Beliaghata, they used to order food from this place. The roll used to be very good, and so was the chinese. It was quite popular in that area around a decade back. However, the quality has deteriorated since. Recently I was passing by and was famished, so I stopped there for a roll. I saw one being packed and was appalled to see the quality and quantity, which is daylight robbery considering the price being charged. Not good!

This is a very old eating out joint in phoolbagan, which is famous for their delicious rolls. Recently I came to know about the other main course food which they have introduced, so I tried their Chinese. I took a parcel instead of dine in because the place is very small and congested. The food was average and oily. Not a very good experience.

Review: Silver Spoon

A comprehensive review of this family restaurant covering most major aspects.

Location - 4/5
Situated near Phoolbagan more, it is not easily visible from the main road, but clear direction will direct you to the right place without any hassle.

Facilities - 3/5
No dedicated parking facilities, but plenty of places to park infront & near this small food joint. The open air eating area is literally on the footpath, and very disorganized, with lack of proper lights & cleanliness will look disgusting. The dine in & takeaway facilities are there.

Ambiance - 2/5
The dine-in area is approachable via a narrow shabby staircase, leading to a room with insufficient height and average looking seating arrangements, I will advice against having a dinner in this restaurant itself, rather a takeaway is much much better of an option.

Food - 4.5/5
This little place shines in this one aspect very well. Though no drinks, not even simple mocktails are available, for mainly the non-veg items in the cheap price-range, this restaurant proves itself superior to a lot of other restaurants. Almost everything from small Roles & Kababs, to most other items of Chicken & mutton are a treat to your tongue.

Service - 2/5
Nothing to talk home about. Your food will be served without much delay, and thats it.

Overall - 3/5
Perhaps the only thing great about this restaurant is its food, and well priced items. So, it is advised to ask them to pack the food and later eat in comfort of your own home, than going into the venture of dining in this place.

Grew up eating at this restaurant. The least I can do is write a good review because they very well deserve it. From the rolls to the mughlai and their Chinese, try anything and you will want to come back again. Has a small yet cosy seating area with the best of services. And yes, it does not pinch you in the pocket too :)

This restaurant is located near phoolbagan, though its not easily traceable.
The place has a narrow entrance with the kitchen on the ground floor and seating arrangement upstairs.Its a good small eatery serving common chinese and mughlai dishes.Well,the food is not very good in terms of quality but its yummy enough to feed ur stomach and entertain ur taste buds simultaneously!! The prices are a bit on the higher side though.Most of the time the seats remain empty and the seating arrangement also provides "some" privacy to couplesðŸ˜‰.
Overall a nice place to visit.

I have been here two to three times. The place is mostly known for rolls. Tried the chicken roll...they put exactly four small pieces of chicken and they charged a lot compared to the quality and quantity. I even once went for dinner. Ordered butter naan , shahi paneer and chicken masala. The food was average. They took quite a lot of time to serve only this much food. The ambience is not at all up to the mark. The place is too congested and small. For rolls one have to sit outside on the footpath. I am not at all happy with this place.

This place is the first one in my life where I ventured for food without the presence of my parents and relatives. Biryani, chicken Bharta, Roll are the food items good to taste. the place is a dingy one and too small. The staffs are bad. The quantity can't complete the tummy of a hungry human like me. The taste is so so. The price is high compared to the quantity.this place is good for those in their teenage only.

The chicken Bharta is the one thing that often comes over to my place, and it is pretty decent. But what makes me happy about Silver Spoon is the chicken roll - which are actually pretty good. In fact, they also make a very average biryani, and so-so Chinese, but the Bharta and the roll are the two things to go for here. Portion size is decent, and the space is cramped, so takeaway is a better deal.
