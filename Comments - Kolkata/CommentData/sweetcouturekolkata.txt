I have been meaning to order for a long time but I finally got round to it for Halloween this year. I ordered the Halloween themed cookies and the trick-or-treat edible cookie house. Both were huge hits among family and friends - not only did they look incredible but they tasted fabulous as well! 
I definitely recommend ordering from here to make your festivals even more special!

It's come to a point where anything sweet in your life is inevitable.
Been eating Sweet Couture cakes, cupcakes, brownies you name it everything for years now, and there's a reason I go back.Quality usually trumps quantity but this is literally a case of eating your cake and having it too.I've been told that they always use fresh ingredients, and expensive ones too mind you- not bringing the damn roof down when you have to foot the bill.Take my word for it, I might be only in my twenties- but remember that I'm from Calcutta- we live on sweet(ness).My birthday cake was literally carved out of the Very Best of Dire Straits- nutella filling 3 pound cake.
SWEET!

I am ever impressed by the quality of Sweet Couture cakes! They keep raising the bar with every new design, I don't know how they do it!  I love the creativity and execution... It's truly brilliant.  Keep up the amazing work!!
