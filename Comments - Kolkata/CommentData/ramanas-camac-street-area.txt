A lovely South Indian Fast food joint at Camac Street, right next to Hotel Senator. The menu is extremely economical,.. dishes are realy tasty, as well as the portion size is good too.

I would have overlooked this breakfast joint had they not distributed flyers around. Because in my view, a restaurant without customers ain't good. At any rate I decided to try once. 
Small but tidy place, not many chairs to sit though. The staff was very helpful. So I ordered a paper cheese masala dosa. The taste and the quantity both of them made me a frequent customer. Till date, I have tasted their podi dosa (quite new to me ) , uttapam ...will try their panniyaparam someday.  And I loved their authentic filter "kaapi".

Early winter evening time I ordered 2 plate of masala dosa through zomato delivery app using my zomato credits point so I got it in a very cheap amount , as I'm on diet so can't eat oily food & it was nothing better than having south Indian food as a snack , packing was really nice you can see the image below the comment , coming to their food it was a authentic south Indian dosa I really liked it specially the coconut chutney it was great.

Its a type of an eating house.
Ideally located near camac street crossing.
Its south indian food is too good to taste.
Prices have been kept according to office people. Very cheap yet too good to have.

Visited this on a Thursday afternoon when I was starving in scorching heat. 

Great food
Greater taste
Surprisingly decent ambience which is affordable around Park street area.

Upma was mouthwatering although the quantity was just nominal
