One of my favourite places to visit for a quick bite. This place belongs to the bancharam franchise,and is strictly vegetarian. The best part about this place is their desserts. Birthday cakes are also available. The mihidana birthday cake which I haven't seen anywhere else is pretty unique and tastes good also. Other than this the chocolate brownie,  chocolate mousse, and other chocolate pastries are just love. They all taste good and the best part is that they are vary affordable.

This outlet or franchise is a part of Bancharam sweets.
While Bancharam is a popular sweet shop ,
CC&M comes no where near it. That day we bought these chocolate cakes which were unusually underbaked. The nonel gur custard was decent but lacked sweetness.

‘Cake, Cookies & More’ have two outlets in KOLKATA, and both of them are in their prime location.

In this shop we can find variety of vegetarian Cakes, Cookies and many more items related to bakery. Here we can find a wide range of items which are not only looks good but also tastes great. 

This cake shop which is just beside the autostand of Golpark. It is a unit of the legendary Bancharams.

No seating arrangements are available in this shop. This shop is simply take away shop.

In the evening of this Sunday I visited this place, ordered a Chocolate Cake, few Donuts and two Tarts. Their service was not bad, I mean it was good and fast (quick). When me and my family members ate them in home we find the items were fresh and tastes good. 

Except for Cake and pastries, the price range is Rs.20-30 per item.

Staff of this shop is very honest, friendly, courteous, care full and energetic.

Each and every bakery item was properly cooked and quantity & measure of cream, sugar, etc. was good. All of them are tasty and smells very nice. Also each and every item was really fresh and tasty. The texture and presentation of every item was simply superb. I love their every item, it’s too good and very much pocket friendly.

People, 

Ambience was good upto a certain extent.

Cost is not high (except for few items).

My overall experience with this shop was nice.

I recommend this place to every person of KOLKATA to visit and try there items.

** Location = Just beside the Golpark Autostand.

**Brief = Everything was nice and smooth until one of their staff asked me not to click pictures of the items kept for display citing that management had told them so. Bizzare, my review would include such behaviour and hence deducting .5 for that.

** Ambiance/Decor = A well lit place, with a wide array of items that not only looks good but also tastes great. Vegetarian only and no seating available. This is a unit of the legendary Bancharams.

** Things tried = I ordered Chocolate Donut and One Chocolate Tart. I had packed them and both the items were fresh and tasted good. 

** Purse Check = The price ranges from Rs.20-30/- per item and very much pocket friendly and tasty food items. In my view 100-150/- would be good enough.

**Overall = Great variety, nice food, but they should look into the staff management and make them aware of dealing with customers, which is the most important thing and should be number 1 at your priority list.

The most affordable place for satisfying after shopping hunger in Gariahat. Based upon my orders :
1.Chocolate donuts at Rs.20, very satisfying in this price.
2.Chocolate mousse at rs.25, tastes good.
3. Chocolate mudpie at Rs. 20 a bit dry but overall i liked it.

The food items didn't attract me because no non veg options available sadly.
Will surely go back to satisfy my sweet tooth while street shopping :D

It's is suited near golpark auto stand easily accessible 100 percent veg so its really suitable for vegetarians. coming to their food & pastries prices are really cheap. I ordered one chocolate truffle pastry it cost me rs.35 per piece, pastry was fresh and tasted good though the iceing over the pastry was just little dry but negletable. If you have not been here do come & try.

Their Smiley Cookies are scrumptious to taste, along with some other items whose names I cannot recall.

Of late, this place has become my favourite for grabbing a quick snack in between shopping in the Gariahat area. Despite being an all-veg outlet, most of their items are delicious and will hardly cost you 20-30 bucks. I have tried their Chocolate Brownie, Nut Corner Cookie, Kadhai Paneer Roll and Mushroom & Corn Pie. Among these, I would recommend the Brownie and the Mushroom & Corn pie. Service is satisfactory.

A new Eggless Bakery in town by Banchharam has lots of cakes and savoury items to offer. Their chocolate pastries and cookies are absolutely delicious and also the black forest & white forest cakes. Though the other pastries are a little too creamy. The cookies are marvelous & perfectly crisp. Haven't tried their savoury items yet though the display seems to be really impressive. Great shop to catch on for light evening snack. Along with that the pocket pinch is extremely reasonable. Though the staff seems to be a little rude. Apart from that, good bakery and can go a long way on few minute improvements.

Located at Golpark auto stand. Have been to this place twice. Tried their kadai paneer roll (₹25) and mud pie (₹20). Kadai paneer roll was fine with lots of paneer cubes inside. It's filling but not at all spicy. It will taste good with ketchup (which they don't provide) or it might seem tasteless and bland. I like the paneer roll at bachharam more. Mud pie was okay. It didn't seem fresh though. Taste was fine, would have been better if it was fresh. Brownie wasn't available when I went or would have tried that too. A major drawback is that non-veg isn't available here. Maybe I will try paneer kulcha and brownie later sometime. Prices are too low. I never found a cheaper place. Service is fine. Ambience- The ac seemed non- functional. Though they said it was on,the place was too hot.

Cakes, cookies and more is the famous Kolkata mishti shop Bancharam's venture into the world of baked goodies. I walk past this place everyday on my way to the university but today finally I tried some of their sweet treats. What i had-
Chocolate Brownie
Mango mousse
Black forest pastry.
Two things that i love about this place is that everything is so damn cheap and all their products are egg less which gives them a brownie point from my side.Now coming to how i liked the food. 
The brownie was really yum. It had a chocolaty layer on the top and the brownie was really really soft.
The mango mousse was also really nice. The mango compote on top tasted like actual mangoes and not artificial flavouring which is hard to find these days that too at such low price. The mousse had a really smooth creamy consistency which was perfect and in the bottom there were bite sized pieces of mango. Super yum!!
The black forest pastry was light as air, which i loved. The whipped topping melts in your mouth along with the chocolate shavings. The basic chocolate sponge was also really soft and light.  
So i loved all the three things that i had and I would again go back to try some more goodies out of their menu. Do visit this place.
Till then Happy Dining Peeps :)

It's only when my mother got some eggless pastries from this shop that I got to know about Banchharam's new 100% vegetarian dessert parlour. The pastries were surprisingly amazing to taste, simply loved. One con and that is they do not last long as we forgot to have one piece and later after two days we found that it had gone bad even in refregerated state.

This shop can be easily located near Garia-Golpark Auto Stand or beside banchharam (Golpark) small food joint... Their brownies are good...but not soft and bit dry so they need to work on that. Cakes are OK type.. Neither so good nor so bad... 'Cause stuff which they use for ganache should be kinda soft texture. Staffs are not professional with writing over the cake otherwise sober. Pocket friendly small outlet.

It's a creation of Bancharam. Really wide range menu with all veg items, obviously and also very reasonable
Also has a touch of misti r dokan. They serve cakes on shalpata. Which is kind a cool. The browney is really nice. And they also have their range of nolen goor in a tube paste format. Whatever it's a good place for desert.but one should only try one menu at a time. Take two u will be sorry coz it's really SWEET

Went here today for a quick bite. Though, the shop is really small and the array is purely veg the price and taste of the food more than makes up for it.
My partner and I split a veg burger and a mushroom and corn tart between us. 
The burger was HUMONGOUS and full of cheese and mayonnaise, the only drawback would be that the aloo filling of the patty tasted a tad too Indian to go with the Western flavours of the cheese and mayo. The tart was sheer beauty on a plate. Full of delectable corn and mushroom pieces, in a soft and light tart shell.
Even though we split the food we were extremely full for a long time after. Also, all this filling food cost us a meagre 45 bucks. Definitely going back for more.

Located between gariahat and golpark , i just bumped into this little corner plot while walking the footpath , a vegetarian bakery shop from bancharams offering range of savouries cookies and pastries in very reasonable pricing. I tried the MUSHROOM CORN QUICHE for Rs. 20 and MANGO SHOUFLE for rs 25 . Loved the the quiche , the shouffle was decent ,tad synthetic in terms of mango flavour but absoultely value for money. Looking forward to try more.. till then 3.5 from my side.

Small little shop which is  basically a bakery line from Banchharam's. The stock is limited but quite decent qualitatively. Tried the mango souffle and it is just YUMMMM! 😍 Tried the chocolate and mixed fruit muffins too, nothing exceptional but not bad either. Will definitely try the other stuff later. One thing is that,the shop has to come up with way more new things and improve on its stock.

The newest addition to the collection of bakeries that Golpark-Gariahat xing has to offer. Offers a limited no of items but each and every item is innovative. Tried corn puff from here. Tasted superb. The chocolate pastry again was yum. They do have some cute items for kids too like smiley cookie and others. Really pocket friendly and hygienic place. Do check this place out if have not already.

Cake Cookies & More,Golpark
Clean and variety of pastries were there. Staff well behaved suggested me to try there Brownie which was amazing full nutty & chocolaty Brownie at 20/- . 
They don't serve non veg at all. Tried their Veg Burger with a thick Patty with cucumber & tomato slices and a slice of cheese which was thumbs up. 
And white forest pastry and kesar pista pastry were good as well.. 👌
Pocket friendly outlet for college goers.. 😊

This place is a small wing of Bancharams. The place is small and there is not enough accommodation to sit and eat. However, the price of the food items are quite reasonable. This place is extremely pocket friendly. Coming to the quality of the food, I tasted their chocolate pudding and brownie. I felt that the brownie should have been a bit more soft but the taste was good nonetheless and there were dry fruits in every bite of the brownie. Coming to the pudding, the presentation of the Brownie is quite nice and it tasted good too. The only minus point is that it was too sugary. Considering the price range of the items and the quality of food, I'll definitely re-visit the place.

This is located in gariahat. The cakes and the pastries are really fresh. The quality is quite good. Definitely worth a try.  The savoury out there is delicious as well... They are always well stocked. However for certain products, they get over by evening.

Located near the dhakuria bridge it's a small sized snacks and sweet nothings joint. We friends were out for pandal hopping and then it started to pour. My eyes literally scanned the delicious looking pastries. I couldn't control and thus walked into the store. 

Orders: 1) vegetable burger 
2) veg sandwich 
3) paneer roll 
4) vegetable puff
5) mushroom pie 
6) chocolate muse 
7) coco nut corner 

Coming from the burger; I couldn't believe that they actually served such good patty and a thick slice of cheese and not to forget fresh cucumber and tomato. It was really very tasty. I loved it! 
The sandwich!! Oh god. I can't explain. It's one of the best ever tasted fresh sandwiches (vegan ones) 
The roll was pretty average. 
The puff;I didn't really taste it so I wouldn't comment. 
Then the mushroom pie, I'm a fan of mushroom but to my astonishment the pie was kinda bland in taste.. it didn't turn up to my expectations. 
The coco nut cookie was really tasty! It costs just 16₹ and it's worth the money. It has a layer of carrot and then a thick layer of nuts with the corners dipped in chocolate. 
The muse was yummy too. 
Great value for money. 
Though it's purely veg but the burgers and sandwiches are a must try! 

I'm greatly impressed with the price and their service calls for a thumbs up! 
Thank you.

Apparently a sister concern of the popular and well known sweet brand Bancharam, this particular outlet of Cake Cookies and More is located right near the Gariahat Golpark Auto Stand. One can find this on their way from Gariahat to Golpark. Clean and shining, the quality of the products here is good as well. Tried the Chocolate Truffle and was quite impressed. The pricing too seemed to be good, with the upper ceiling well within affordable range.

Cake Cookies and More is located very near to the Golpark, and I must say they are serving a fantastic quality cakes Pastries and other items at a very low price. Pastries are very tasty, good in quality and soft. Chicken items are low price too.
I tried out their Kesar Pastry and it was just brilliant at just Rs.18. My Friend took the Brownie at it was delicious too.
Total value for money. And I think there is no second store in the town serving such good Pastries and other Bakery product at such a low price.

This review comes after 7 visits to the shop in less than a month and that itself says a lot. Like everybody else mentioned, this place is super cheap and average price of every item is INR 15 and nothing exceeds 25! This is a bro-shop of Banchharam, apologies I forgot the technical term. So I'll take this opportunity to crack a joke. Banchharam is so expensive that they came up with this shop as a means of penance for torturing our pockets for generations. Umm.. moving on! The muffins, I've tried all, are rainfall-in-winter gorgeous. Especially choco chip muffins. OMG please! They are too mindbogglingly good! The blueberry muffins smell delicious and taste even better! The chocolate muffins are a tad too bitter though. You might wanna stick to the left part of the display window, cuz the right, with pastries and other non-dry savouries aren't too great, but then there's the price and they look marvellous! As for the shop, I love how clean and hygienic it looks! Overall I love this place for the favourites I've made. A bane to my diet plans!

Went to this place to give my friend a little Birthday treat... And what can be more appropriate than cakes and cakes and chunks of cakes. I was awestruck by their variety of cakes and their prices... In cake section the highest price was I guess 25, but majority of cakes and pastries were between 16 to 20. I tried Mud Pie and Chocolate Truffle Pastry. The Truffle was mouthwatering, the taste of dark chocolate was perfect 10. Brought home their Black Forest which is only 18 Rs, Vegetable Pizza and sweet little Smiley Cookie. The Pizza is really good at only 20 Rupees and looked so fresh. 
Then I found out that it is actually an initiative of Bancharam Sweets, hence you can understand why they taste so good. But it is completely vegetarian. Give it a shot.

This shop is a super pocket friendly option for those who are addicted to cakes ,cookies and more. All the foods here are 100% veg. I have tried there chocolate tart before. But today when I visited this place, they were running out of chocolate tart. You can easily guess the demand for it. So , we tried chocolate mud pie and chocolate brownies on their humble request. They assured that these were going to be really good. They didn't disappoint us. But I only wish the sweetmeats were little less sweet. We tried the mushroom corn pie later on and it was good too. Specially everything had a very justified quality and quantity at such a low price of 20 bucks each. Will visit again for there chocolate tart and this time, of course,before they run out of stock.

Very very inexpensive stop for cakes and quick bites. The chocolate cupcake was still pretty nice, the nut corner has way to improve and the mud pie was alright.

This particular food joint is beside bancharam sweets and golpark auto stand. One can locate this outlet very easily due to its vibrant yellow banner " Cakes Cookies & More ". Coming to the food it totally serves veg food and eggless bakery items which is an added advantage for the vegetarians. I took veg pizza,one chocolate truffle pastry and chocolate brownie.

Veg pizza- i liked the pizza. If i compare it with mio amore, i would surely go for veg pizza from this joint. It was yummy.

Chocolate truffle pastry & chocolate brownie- in order to have the chocolatey taste i microwaved both the items for a few seconds. It was looking delicious. The  pastry was soft and tasty. The brownie was also quite good. The nuts added a crunchy element to the brownie. 

I loved their items and would try their other items as well.

This cake shop draws attention from a distance because of its glass walls that helps one see the road outside . The shop is an extension of the renowned confectionery brand 'Banchharam' , and houses a variety of eggless cakes and pastries , and savouries too . All items in this shop are eggless , so if you're a vegetarian , fret not ! The pastries taste delicious , and are as fresh and tasty as they look. The chocolate donut here has a thick layer of chocolate on top , which makes it a tasty eat . The chocolate tart is also good . The mango souffle here tastes good too, and can give you an off season taste of everyone's favourite fruit! The sweet and sour puff however has a curious taste , with tomato chutney for  filling, which did not suit my taste buds. Overall , this pastry shop will not let you down , and has friendly and caring staff who ensure good food and quality !  A big thumbs up!

This newly opened shop near Golpark flyover is my current confectionery fascination in the city. You won't believe the oh-so-tasty cakes, soufflés, tart, pudding in such reasonable prices tasting as per as brands like Cookie jar or cakes.

I've tried quite a some of varieties,.. The best one of all was chocolate mud pie..the taste is beyond explanation, else chocolate brownie, chocolate donut, mango soufflé, strawberry mousse cake are worth tasting. 

Overall this new place will be a upcoming hotshot in town if it goes on like this. 👌

Hence, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
👍
