Super place to chill. Really love the ambience. Great place for both business gathering and leisure with friends. Special mention to the manager, Bapi! He is a real gem and takes care of all the guests with at most hospitality. Probably the best place to eat & chill in Dalhousie

The food is good and the ambience is really good. A common hangout place over here with my colleagues. The food is really good especially the crispy chilly baby corn and the chicken Tandoori. Always had a good time over dis place.

The place is very well maintained and neat and clean. The food quality was rich and the crowd was good . The Chinese and the continental food was lip smacking .There is a separate place for going with family members. There are a numerous varieties of food and the service is very good. I would recommend viewers to visit this restaurant with their friends and family .
