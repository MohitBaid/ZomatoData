The place is near Pallishree in Baghajatin. Was introduced to this place by my colleague. The place is a small roadside counter but the food is a class apart. 
The fact looks can be deceptive holds true here. The food is awesome and they specialize in Biriyani and Chap. 

Have tried both the mutton n chicken biriyanis. The taste is delicious . Not like the regular road side Biryani. It is light , aromatic and really flavourful. The quantity is generous and the people are very happy and helpful.  

The place is a roadside counter so its only takeaway. 
Do try the place if you are in the locality and in the mood for Biryani. The price is a joke to what you get.

Street food and biriyani don't go well together...but guys let me tell you ..this is the best Street side biriyani you will have. No unwanted colours, no dalda drained fingers. Just dum ki biriyani taste. Price is something you don't need to calculate here.
Good job guys .keep it up.
