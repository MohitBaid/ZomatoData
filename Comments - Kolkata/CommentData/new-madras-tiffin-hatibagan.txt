Its a good place to eat! Hatibagan needed a South Indian Joint and here it is for you.!
A perfect cozy place to sit and eat.

Served in a steel plate was my Masala Dosa,
Crisp and really crunchy crust. The filing of aloo had less flavor of curry patta which is'nt the authentic way to prepare that. But don't worry, its a good pick considering the area in which its is situated in. I liked the White chamandhi, but not their sambhar it wasn't flavorful at all. But I cannot judge it just by one dish so, I won't comment much. I'm looking forward to try more of their dishes in future too.

A nice place to be full with a delicious variety of south indian foods. The dhosa served here is m9re than enough for one person, loved the mixed chaat also.. reasonable price, but a bit of suggestion, if the place could get any bigger then it will be easy to not stand outside in occasional times... overall one of my favourite places.

Hello!!!! 

I am reviewing after a very long time. I am at New Madras Tiffin at Hatibagan. 

So I ordered two things. Butter Masala Dosa and a filter coffee. 

Butter masala dosa was good actually better than good it was crunchy and also the masala stuffing was really good. They served it with two chutneys the regular coconut and the other one with onion garlic and tomato the red chutney. Really liked the flavour of the other chutney, Sambhar was great. 

Filter coffee was not up to mark at around 40 rupees it was not good enough..

Few things which i really didn't like was that the drinking glass was not clean enough.

We are not actually fond of vegetarian food, but we have always liked South Indian cuisine. So, during a windy evening when we were searching for a place where we can eat something which will not upset our stomachs; we decided to go to New Madras Tiffin. This place has been renovated. It is now well decorated and air conditioned. Though it's not spacious at all, but the service was pretty fast. Staffs are well behaved. We had special paper masala dosa,dahi vada and kulfi. Food quality was very nice. We really liked it. The covering of the dosa was very crispy. Most of the times, what happens, the vegetable stuffing softens the covering of the dosa and I feel like eating roti-sabji. Duh! But this time it didn't happen. The dahi vada was mouth watering. We had a nice time relishing the kulfi. So looking forward to visit this place again, whenever the 'vegetarian, stomach friendly' alarm clock will ring inside our minds! We will not snooze it anymore.

This is located just beside hatibagan arsalan. A nice south indian food joint. Neat, tidy and a very small restaurant with less seating arrangement. Overall service is good, staffs are quick. Tried paneer masala dosa and masala dosa both were delicious and crisp. Visited this place many times, the dahibadas and kulfi are also so very south indian. A neat and nice restaurant in the alley of hatibagan.

New Madras Tiffin is located below the huge Arsalan in Hatibagan, in the ground flood. The outlet isn't much big. They serve good South Indian dishes. I have tried their Cheese Masala Dhosa, very good with good amount of Cheese in between.
Next we tried the Butter Onion Utthapam this was also good in taste. Utthapam with butter on it. 
Badam Milk Shake. A glass cost Rs.100 but worth it.
Ambiance was good. Prices are fine.

Have been a fan of this place since childhood. One of the oldest south Indian joint in north Kolkata. If you can compromise with their decent seating arrangement , then it's the right place for you when u are in Hatibagan.
They provide few of the awesomest dosas in town. Even after spending a good number of years down south and trying food at the different udupi joints or 'the sagars' ,I still can say this place still holds a place if I to make a list about my favourite south Indian joints in India. My personal fav being their spcl masala dosa and kulpi. You can even try their upma or the uttapam and sip some coffee too.
The staff are courteous and are trained to attend customers in a jiffy. Easy on pockets provided the kind and quality of the food they serve.
I definitely recommend this place to who so ever is craving for south indian food in north kokata.

The taste and even the staff are the old ones.
One of the great places to try out South Indian.

The place serves varieties of dosas but don't go for the cheese ones as they serve very little cheese and doesn't make any difference in taste of the food 


avg their kulfi too.

Its hard to resist Arsalan, the beast as I prefer to call it, which attracts a lion's share of the Hati bagan crowd, sparing few people for the other eateries to share among them. Well, the astonishing part is, New Madras Tiffin, stationed just below Arsalan, has its own fan base and what captured my attention was  people waiting in queues to dine there.

I went with my mom. She is fond of South Indian foods. We ordered SPECIAL MASALA DOSA and UTTAPAM. Well the DOSA lived up to its name, the mixture of mashed potatoes and veggies made the dosa 'MASALEDAAR'. It was my first hand experience with UTTAPAM, which looked like a pancake, but tasted even better than the DOSA. The sooji was ENRICHED with the GHEE flavour and several other toppings like CASHEW NUTS, sliced TOMATOES and ONIONS.

A narrow interior but certainly not shabby, pulls more crowd than it has seats, the interior is brightly lit with clean walls and a wave like false ceiling design. The working staff is friendly and well behaved.

TOP-NOTCH SOUTH INDIAN FOOD at hatibagan.

Amidst Puja Shopping, this became the food destination of two shop-a-holics in the midst of sweaty Kolkata crowd. And no, they did not regret.
The place is cramped, though clean, with not more than 20 seats available. Though there is an AC, but it's not enough in the heat. The waiters and helpful, suggestive and prompt. And the food- delicious. We ordered two masala dosas, which tasted a-la-authentic-South-Indian. The sambhar wasn't the usual all-water-no-veggie show a d the chutneys were lip smacking. And the falooda kulfi was the cherry on the cake!
The price on the menu list is inclusive of taxes, so it's quite affordable. And it's a must try for all my sister shop-a-holics, Puja or no Puja! ;)

Quality simply can't doubt and atmosphere is little spacious but again sweet on its own. Proud to have a good south Indian junction in hatibagan area like New Madras tiffin. Though we have couple of restaurants in shyambazar also who deals on same kind of plates, but never tried personally.

This place is soul food. Maybe heritage is the word. Every north calcuttan has known Madras tiffin for years. Their dosas, dahibadas and kulfis were a favorite among the old and the new. After a few years of being shut down last year Madras tiffin came back at the same place with an entire new look. I still love their dosas and dahibadas and kulfis though you have to admit the taste differs a lot with the essence it had during my childhood or my father's days. Stopped by today for a plate of dahibadas and kulfi with my sister and realised I haven't reviewed this place yet. After all it's been there all the time.

Reasonable prices, air-conditioned, service good. The waiter there was an old employee, whom my mom knows from her college days. The Plain Dosa we ordered were tasty, as it should be Ended with some cool, yummy Kulfi. A nice place to have evening snacks after shopping at Hatibagan. A normal rating of 8 out of 10 for this food joint.

This is a very old shop in Hatibagan area serving south Indian food. Recently they have upgraded to AC. The food here is good and have variety menuwise. But the problem here is the attitude of the owner. Behaves rudely and acts as if he is doing any favour by allowing us to eat. The waiters are well behaved though. If you are around and want some south Indian food, you can visit this place, provided you do not mind a few rude gestures. If you are lucky and his mood is good, this place serves the best South Indian food in Hatibagan area. I personally don't like paying to get rude behaviors, so would avoid this place.

They served their special paneer dosa which was undoubtedly delicious, crisp and so very South Indian. My sister and I had dropped in here after getting tired from pandal hopping in the area during Durga Puja last year to grab a quick energising South Indian lunch. The masala dosa platter is also very good. Tucked away in an alley in Hatibagan, for quick South Indian grub this is a neat little eatery.

This is a very old shop in Hatibagan area serving south Indian food. Recently they have upgraded to AC. The food here is good and have variety menuwise. But the problem here is the attitude of the owner. Behaves rudely and acts as if he is doing any favour by allowing us to eat. The waiters are well behaved though. If you are around and want some south Indian food, you can visit this place, provided you do not mind a few rude gestures. If you are lucky and his mood is good, this place serves the best South Indian food in Hatibagan area. I personally don't like paying to get rude behaviors, so would avoid this place.

They served their special paneer dosa which was undoubtedly delicious, crisp and so very South Indian. My sister and I had dropped in here after getting tired from pandal hopping in the area during Durga Puja last year to grab a quick energising South Indian lunch. The masala dosa platter is also very good. Tucked away in an alley in Hatibagan, for quick South Indian grub this is a neat little eatery.

This place is like in there heart of Hatibagan. Serves good food. We ordered onion dosa and Sambhar vada. The service is too good, they don't keep you waiting. And the place actually smells South Indian.

A small south indian eatery beside arsalan, hatibagan. This place has been here for more than ten years and is still going strong. I have been here several times and have never been disappointed. 
------
Their rava dosa, cheese masala dosa and onion uttapam is just too good, and so is the sambhar.
------
The staff is really good here. Prices are a okay.    Its air-conditioned and is a great plaCe to eat if you like to have your food in the quiet. Do visit this place.

They offer very good Dosas and Idly.
Small Veg South Indian place.
Dahi Vadas are also nice.
Kulfis are good as well.

This restro is an example of " big surprises come in small packets". oh what lovely food they served in that tiny cornered restaurant just beside arsalan.
We actually tasted quite a lot of things.It started with a plate of fried idly which was crunchier outside and soft inside with three varieties of chutneys which included the sambar. Then we ordered a butter cheese onion plain dosa, a ghee onion mysore dosa and a cheese butter uttapam
You might think that it was too much of ghee n butter, but trust me not a single burp would come out.
The dosas were out of the world n so was the uttapam.
P.S. Try out the mysore ghee dosa once.
I find this as best dosa joint in town.
Just go and dig.

This is perhaps only authentic south indian food joint in entire north Kolkata. Located besides Arsalan, Hatibagan this restaurant is 40 years old pioneer south indian eatery. Got new decoration hence named New. If you want healthy light tasty foods in pocket friendly price this eatery awaits you. You wont get so many varieties of Dosa and Uttapam anywhere else in North Kolkata. Loved their Upma too. And the authentic taste of coffee. Try their Kulfi too. Also friendly behaviour of management and staffs will worm you. Only thing I didn't give 5 for its inadequate place.

Idlis are very soft n the chatnis and sambars are also yumm yumm... They serve 1 of the best papri chats and dahi vadas in Hatibagan region, kulfi is a must try. I loved the cheese masala dosa also. If you are a South_Indian food lover and you are at Hatibagan, you know where to go. üòâ

New Madras Tiffin is probably the best south Indian restro in the hatibagan area. It is located just beside arsalan and has a very tiny entrance. The place is small and congested and has a seating facility for a maximum of 15 people. 

The menu comprises mostly south Indian dishes like idli, dosas, upma and utthapam. Also a few desserts and beverages are available. Our order was idli and a ghee masala dosa.

At first came idli. Each plate consists of two fluffy idli pieces with three chutneys. One was sambar, another white coconut chutney and a yellow coconut chutney. The sambar was so good that even a south Indian food hater will fall in love with it. The white chutney was decent but the best was the yellow chutney which was spicy and tasted great. 

The dosa was awesome. The taste of ghee could be felt in every bite. The size was huge and the potato onion filling was also very tasty.    It was one of the best dosas I ever had.

The prices are nominal and the waiters are very friendly with a smile on their face. I'm coming here very soon to try their upma and uthhapams

Have been eating here since my childhood days. Used to come here with Ma and Dada after shopping or before going for a movie. Though a small place (5 four seaters and 4 two seaters) it is comfortable and clean. They now have AC too. Service is prompt and friendly. Food is quite good. Specifically I like the variety of dosa they serve. From plain to rava to dhania or mysore. The special masala dosa stuffing is great. Dahi Vada is another dish that one should try here. They make a decent kulfi too. If you want a proper seating arrangement and good South Indian food when around Shyambazar / Hatibagan / Sobhabajar, you will be satisfied with this place.

But this place has made me love dosas and vadas and i have revisited new madras tiffin quite a few times after that day.  Tha sambhar and chutneys are awesome; very healthy and light foods.  I would recommend this place to those who want to spend less and eat healthy.  Last but not the least,  you will definitely get a big smile from the restaurant staffs.

It was my craving for Rava dosa which made me search for authentic south indian restaurant near my house as I did not want to travel very far this time. My search ended in Hatibagan New Madras Tiffin. We were a bit apprehensive about the car parking but luckily managed to park our car on the main road. The newly refurbished little restaurant was a delight for us. I ordered a onion rava dosa and my husband ordered for a dhania special masala dosa. I gorged on the rava dosa... it was crispy, yummy and had the typical flavour of south indian food.  The sambhar was a bit tangy but nevertheless tasty.  The coconut chatni was good and served cold which was a relief in this heat. The tomato garlic chatni was nice but then they do not repeat it when asked for. The menu has a wide variety and I am sure to land up in this restaurant quite often henceforth to try the other items on the menu. 
The small seating area is well furnished and has air conditioning as well.  There's nothing great in the ambience but yes it would be a good respite to enter and grub some delicious food in the middle of shopping in Hatibagan area. The service was prompt and quick.  We also ordered for faluda kulfi which was also nice. We paid Rs. 250 for two dosas, 1 kulfi and a bottle of packaged water. The price is a bit high compared to the locality it is situated in but I don't mind paying at all because the quality of food was excellent and tge place was also clean and well maintained.

Ohh.. They were in the list of orders i made at this small yet cozy place. No i dint go for shopping at hatibagan but to have a stroll around this small point of food court. And what a fabulous place to sumup evening hunger with the end number of south choices. You will be a fan of vade and dosas as they are reallt yummiest under that budget price. Have your evening tastes at this place and go for dinner at arsalan. 
The place is small and barely 22 people cam sit inside. Orders are served within 1 to 10m. Portions can be shared between two depending on their capabilities. That extra . 5 is for the tastes.

Though this is a old place which has been recently renovated, this is where you would get the worst South Indian food in Kolkata. I have tried their dosas twice and it was horrible. The roadside stalls at Shyambazar nearby sell much much better south indian food or your homemade dosas can be far far better.

Masala paper dosa and papri chat are my@ favourite items. Jst beside arsalan, narrow area with 7 or 8 tables , bt very well designed. Very good non veg hangout. Nice food, and well behaved attendants.

This neat little south Indian restaurant is located exactly beside hatibagan arsalan and you are likely to miss this place if you're not looking hard enough! But the size has nothing to do with the magical world of veggie delights inside : it is a breather in a city infested with shacks selling the usual  non vegetarian chowmein and chilli chicken . The light food is definitely a much healthier option too , and is easy on the stomach. They have a wide range of dosas , uttapams and other south Indian dishes . I tried the Mysore dosa (plain) and it was really good . It came with sambar and two chutneys , the second one being the red chilli chutney that went best with the dosa. The kulpi or kulfi was brought in from a small kulfiwala stationed outside the restaurant , who apparently also appeals to the arsalan crowd. Overall the place is a much needed outlet for all the vegetarians who need a quick bite in between shopping at hatibagan .

Located just next to Hatibagan Arsalan, this is probably one of the best South Indian restaurants of North Kolkata. The place is very small, yet has a beautiful interior. It's an a.c restro serving delicious dosas and utthapams. I loved the Mysore Butter Special Masala Dosa. It's huge in size and so tasty. Aslo had Butter Special Utthapam, which is  good too. Kulfi there tastes average. Waiters are extremely well behaved and they sometimes tend to read your mind about what you are thinking of tasting. :P  Overall I loved the place and would like to visit again.

Since a long time i was looking for some good Dosas in and around North Kolkata and right here near Shyam Bazar, i found the perfect place.
The place is very small, with some benches and tables (though Air Conditioned). Couple of waiters who are extremely courteous wouldn't disappoint you in serving the perfect, yummy, crispy dosas at lightning fast speed. They have variety of dosas and the masala inside is just amazing. Price is reasonable too. The kulfi is prety good too. 
You wouldn't be disappointed if you have a evening there.
Would recommend the special masala dosa or the cheeze dosa.

Location- beside Arsalan, hatibagan
Ambience- a small and soberly decorated restaurant which is clean and hygienic. 
Food- we ordered a paper special masala dosa and a paneer masala dosa. Both were very tasty and huge in quantity. We really have to take breaths to finish them. Thought of ordering kulfi but could not as we were too full.
Service- was fast. Took 10mins to serve us. The staffs were friendly and courteous. 
Price- reasonable. Our bill came around Rs.170/-.
Overall a nice experience and definitely in my revisiting list to fulfill my cravings for South Indian food.

It is decent place to just go and eat.. Food lovers shall visit this place and have a nice fooding experience. People who want to spent time isn't suitable for this as it isn't spacious. But the main thing is the food which is more important.. A thumbs up..

Aftet it has been newly renovayrd, it has promoted itsrkf to an ac restaurant ... But ad a place it is nothing but a strip of passage!
Very crunch of space... Difficult to sit properly ....

But food quality has improved a lot .... The masala dosa contains good amount of veggies ... Buts... Cheese n other stiffs ... Msking it really good.... The dai bada is also teally good.

Been here today as well i.e. 24/09/16... had paneer onion masala dosa n badam milk shake.

Located near shyambazar, new madras tiffin offers great south indian food at prices not so in-line with its location and ambiance.

Its close to hatibagan town hall, beside sutanuti junction. The restaurant is very small, congested with some very uncomfortable seats. However air conditioning is good that compensates to some extent. The staff is polite, prompt.¬†

Coming to food, idlis and upma are pretty good. Vadas are decent. Smbhar is lovely but the coconut chutney is too diluted so i would suggest one to always order their special chutney alongside. Dosas are very well made and i loved their masala inside which was top notch. Dhania masala dosa turned out to be pretty tasty. Cold coffee is basic and tastes good.¬†

Overall one of the better south indian restaurants in this part of city in my opinion with nice preparations combined with good ingredients at bit overshot prices, yet very value for money.

Food is just ok, not great. Cost is high compared to the quality and options available in the neighbouring restaurants. Behaviour is pathetic. I visited there on last Sunday for food pick up.  Although it is written as AC Restaurant, they put their ACs off for cost saving, only fans were running in this hot summer. Upon request of a customer, one waiter put one AC on, who was then grilled by the owner - why he did so, and why he didn't say that ACs can't be made on. Since I was waiting occupying a chair on an empty table, the owner shouted to his staff, why they are not clearing parcels, who are occupying space for no reason. Listening that I came out and was waiting outside until the parcel was delivered. 
Won't visit again.

how can i forget about this place..being a hardcore non vegetarian..am a huge fan of their dosa and uthapam...its one of the best south indian joints u will find in north kolkata besides dimpi..
i am a lover of their special butter masala dosa and tomato cheese uthpam..i have loved them...their plain dosa is awesome it was not at all plain...and the uthpam was mind blowing i had such uthpam at dosa plaza...it was better than that...i am a lover of their kesaria kulfi its one of a kind...
do try this place...its ambience and staff along with servers are just too good...and i find it quite pocket friendlyy...will be trying their rava dosa next time..:)
