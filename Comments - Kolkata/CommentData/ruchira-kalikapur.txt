The review was based only on there food as because there is nothing to mention about there deco, staffs and service... a very ordinary local fast food joint... I had there chowmin, rolls, chilli chicken etc... the taste are ok... they are very inconsistent regarding the quality and professionalism... remains close unexpectedly many times... it's one of the pocket friendly options in the locality...

Not a good food outlet at all. Home delivery is often late. Poor behavior of staff. Its basically a outlet for rolls and chowmin only. For rest items, one should avoid this outlet.

If you're feeling reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeal lazy to cook after coming back home from work and you can absolutely not move a single muscle, then u can go ahead and call them up, beware though, they mess up with the order, check the bill when they come to deliver. food is EDIBLE, just a notch better than your home cooked regular meals. order only when you're low on cash but wanna order something cheap

Recently I had ordered food from this point. Almost most of the items which was in the list was not even available. So finally I had to order Chicken Butter Masala. First of all, the order came after almost 2 hours. Then we found out that the chicken pieces were all bone ones and with very little flesh. Also the gravy was too oily and was not even cooked properly. Terrible Experience! :(
