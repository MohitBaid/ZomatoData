Roadside Dhaba's like this are very popular among office goers. This is a typical road side restaurants, where foods are served at very low price and you have to have the food holding in your hand. No much seating arrangement.
But when it comes to food. They are really good in it. Had Naan and Chilli Pannner and Chana Masala and they were more then expected. Good quality food and all you need is just 40-50 bucks to pay for.
