Ordered food online. The experience was pathetic. They took 2hrs to deliver,showed thoroughly unprofessional behaviour by calling unnecessarily multiple times to get the address.

I had ordered chicken biryani, the chicken piece was rotten. The rice was cold. Overall a horrifying experience.

Being close to my satellite office, I come to this place once in a blue moon.

At the very onset, there's nothing much to talk about the ambience or seating arrangement. Just a non descriptive place in a non descriptive locality, that's all.

Probably better than eating out at the street side food stalls... 

The food is enough for survival. The service is ok...

Though the resto is very small but if you are thinking of home delivery or take a away then must visit. The food items are average but the quantity is worth mentioning and the quality is good.One must try the mixed fried rice, rest upto your's choice. The manager is enthusiastic and the service is prompt.

Quantity and quality of the foods i.e. veg fried rice, mixed noodles, Kadhai paneer, hong kong chicken are  too good to taste. But there are several scope to improve the service.

Location-:Next to RICE education Dishari (Belghoria). Easy to locate being on a good location.Ambiance-Nothing much to describe, being a small restro & ac is not under operation even  on a hot sunny afternoon in the month of April. Food:-Till date had only tried Chicken Hot & Soup soup,Chicken Fried rice, Chicken Hakka & Chilli Chicken!!!Amongst all the items I tried fried rice is good! Rest all d items are average even d chilli chicken!!! The soup tastes below average!!Only one thing is that service is quick and d quantity is good for the rice which I found worth mentioning. Hospitality:- Again nothing much to talk about/mention kind of ok. Conclusion:- Should try to improve their taste and quality & must have d provision of accepting cards!!!

This place is near the Spencer's departmental store..belghoria.. 
This place is kind of a regular restaurant from outside in.. 
BUT.. talking about itz kebabs.. n tandoori chicken.. m in mad love.. 
I would have given a greater star.. if attendants were good to us.. det seem to be highly unprofessional..
Otherwise itz a pocket friendly restaurant fr college goers ..

First of all I don't know why people have given such a poor rating to this restaurant, the food i had was really good although the place is small but the taste of all the items we had was really good.. the service was also good .. the rates are up to the mark...
Ambience could have been better ..although I have tried just a few items ,i will really try some of the others in future ..

This Newly opened restaurant near Rathtala is good for those who reside nearby.
U will get descent food in  very much reasonable price. If u somehow visit this place..u can try chicken tangri masala .
Chinese items are also good for their price.
Overall...descent place for those who reside in this area and don't want to go far away for food...
