Food that is well priced, and excellent if you plan to have an easy evening at home with friends. Ordered a spinach and mushroom quiche, chipotle chicken quesadillas and a tiramisu. They were all excellent. I was given clear instructions on how to reheat the two savoury items, and they were spot on. Nothing got soggy and our friends loved it all too. Quite a hidden treasure Brown's is!
