A roadside eatery located at Camac Street area with zero ambience and unhygienic surrounding .

Service is bit slow due to rush.

Tried Chicken Chow, which tasted nice but was oily. Price is reasonable too.

ক্যামাক স্ট্রীটের কাছে অবস্থিত , রাস্তার ওপরের দোকান , পরিবেশ অস্বাস্থ্যকর , তবে খাবার স্বাদ ভালো । কম দামে পেট ভরাতে আসা যেতেই পারে । চিকেন রোল বেশ ভালো ।

It's a streetside joint located at near Camac Street area.

Zero ambience.

Service is quick.

Their Double Egg Chicken Roll is pretty good with ample & juicy  fillings. A bit oily though.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Just a road side eatery, a regular for office goers nearby. Do not visit if you are finicky about hygiene. Other wise the food is excellent. Personal recommendations - The Mix Fried Rice and the Double egg chicken roll !

A pretty good joint for quick food. The tolls, chowmeins are really tasty. however you really can't think about hygiene here. Food is brilliant and cheap.

A quintessential street food joint...delicious rolls n pocket friendly chineese street food. ..very near to my office...its a place from where I grab a quick bite very often. ...the chicken rice/noodles apart from their rolls...does deserve a mention. .

I have at times stopped by at this little outlet almost on the pavement. They make rolls and some basic standard street-food Chinese items. The usual roadside prices apply, such as Rs 30 for a chicken roll. You can sit and eat... there are plastic chairs on the wide pavement.

Ear this shop had a different owner / workers and the food probably tasted a bit different. Have had chicken rolls a few times and they were better than street-food average. I used to find the chicken chow-mein tasty too, but I have always had a bad tummy post consumption.

Tried a chicken roll today. Expressly asked for thin parathas and they complied. The quantity of chicken was decent, but the roll was a bit too dry. Also the paratha seemed to have a mild rose essence (I could be mistaken), which really puts me off. Some sauce would have probably down the roll some good, but then again, it shouldn't be necessary.

Overall nothing really droolworthy, but worth a try if you are thereabouts and hungry.
