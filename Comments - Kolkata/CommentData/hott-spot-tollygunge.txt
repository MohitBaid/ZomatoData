Located near Ashok Nagar Market a small take away outlet with some Mind blowing dishes on board. You will found lots of student hanging there at evening. A good pocket friendly menu that make your taste buds go crazy with hot and spicy items. I tried their sezwaan rice it was wow. Their rolls are good too. If you are in a hurry with empty stomach then go and get some fast food from there.

This is a food joint adjacent to Ashok Nagar Bazar. I've had their paneer roll a lot of times. The roll seems lite and isn't that oily as compared to other fast food centres. Overall the roll tastes 9/10.
Coming to the Chinese part. I've ordered food home and have had food there as well. Being next to a vegetable market the ambience isn't good but still they've surrounded their shop with plastic chairs. Food tastes like a surprise owing to the appearance of the place. Nice, pocket friendly Chinese food. Their crispy babycorn is actually crispy unlike others and is 9/10 just like their rolls. Noodles are thick but i would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick bite or a proper Chinese meal. Go give it a try!

This street side food joint serves amazing rolls! Whether it's a veg roll or a chicken roll or a chicken tikka roll..the taste wins my vote every time. Located next to ashoknagar bazaar. Ambience and sitting arrangements shouldn't be considered at all as it's a roadside eatery ..a takeaway rather.. But other than that the food delivers . Tried some of their reasonably priced Chinese food ..they were average ..nothing extraordinary..but their rolls are to die for!!! Service is quite slow.. every time I wait for half an hour (minimum) just to get my roll !

Basically a by the road joint, this place sells crazy tasty rolls. It's affordable and pretty recommendable for evening fast food snacks. Chinese tastes amazingly good. So if you're looking forward to fill your tummy with amazing tasty food and not burn a big hole in that pocket of yours definitely try this one out. The infrastructure costs it a few points maybe, but the food makes up for it. Peace.

Good food at affordable rates, Hot Spot is perhaps the best roadside eatery in Tollygunge in terms of quality, quantity as well as value for money. The Szechwan fried rice, crispy baby corn and drums of heaven are a must try here..

A roadside eatery famed for it's rolls...the lack proper sotting arranhement is a big disadvantage but the rolls are really lipsmacking. The chinese dishes are ordinary and not remarkable. But if attacked by a sudden hunger pang this might be a saviour..

Well again hunger strikes on a bad day- The wallet pickpocketted, was nearing tollygunje. Zomato proved to be the ultimate search companion helping me search the best possible option to feed in. Hott spot is quite a renowned street food joint in south kolkata.

Location : reach mahanayak uttam kumar metro station. Cross the road and you will find the petrol pump. From their autos go towards malancha garia. Board the auto. Travel for 3 minutes and on your right hand side you are aure sure to find Hottspot.

Decor and ambience : since it is a street food kiosk, there is no much question of decor and ambience. Food is the only say. It is basically a take away joint. Seating arrangement just involve 1 table and two chairs. Found the joint quite hygienic as compared to the other street food joints . 

Staff: As the joint opens up at 3 pm and I reached at 3.30 pm. The staff was getting ready for the evening ahead. Probably, I was their first customer. They were quite well versed with what was available as they told me what was unavailable at the initial point.

Food : famous for its kathi rolls, had heard about the greatest of their kathi rolls. 

1. Chicken roll : could not resist myself from ordering chicken roll. It was served in less than two minutes. The rolls was great. The chicken pieces tasted amazing drenched in fried capsicum and onion. Although, I have had rolls at par or better than this. So I was not surprised. Although I would say ,one of the better kathi rolls if south kolkata. 

2. Chicken momo : I was quite reluctant about tasting the momos a place which served great rolls. But to my surprise I simply loved the momos. The portions were decent. Six pieces in a plate. The momos were succulent , tasty and definitely worth trying. The soup that accompanied also was great. Although the sauce, I felt was too indian. But definitely would like to recommend the momos.

Value for money : simply amazing. A saviour on the day when your wallet gets pickpocketted. The quality of food that they serve at such cheap rates are quite hard to believe.

Definitely a thumbs up to the restro from my side. Since there is a serious dearth of place to sit, I believe getting it parcelled gives a definitive solution.

There are still few local food shops in the city which can make one of the best chicken rolls and Hott Spot is surely one of them. Situated just beside Ashok Nagar Bazaar, this shop is easy to locate. Blindly go for the chicken roll. I make it sure that I have two chicken rolls back to back whenever I go this place and that too at an affordable price of 30 bucks for a chicken roll.

I have not tried other dishes from this place but this rating of 4 is just for the chicken roll.
