Thumbs Up. Ordered lunch (rice with pulses and egg curry from here) on behalf of my friend's recommendation & i am well satisfied with their quality as well as quantity of the product. Very simple and hygienic. They provide a social 'alu siddo makha' that reminded me of my mom. Its a must try food outlet at Garia! Still i expect they would provide a couple of tissue and a chutney if possible.

I took a Mutton Biriyani Handi of 20 people from that Taltala Biriyani for an occasion. It was really delicious. I hope they will maintain the quality in coming days.
