A nice hangout place. But the food here sucks. ordered a garlic bread, mojito and cold coffee.The decor is decent and the people there are courteous. But you have to work on the food sir. If you want to enjoy with friends it's a nice place. But not a foodies paradise.

Visited this kitchen cum cafe this saturday evening to try out some light snacks. Small cozy cafe with different types of seating arrangements starting from regular seaters, couch, binbags with wonderful decoration of christmas theme all around and carols as music in the background. The innovative idea behind this cafe, they have the menu displayed on the chalkboard which perfectly goes with its name. Ordered trio berry shake, pork meatballs. The trio berry shake was blended with special Christmas cake which tasted so so yummy. I would recommend the shake lovers to try out this special shake which comes during the christmas time only. The pork meatballs tasted okish. For a take away, I went for the Christmas cake which tasted so good and the chocolate with nuts and rum came as a complimentary from the staffs. Tons of thanks for the gesture. The rates are very very pocket friendly.They do have some cute mugs and jars which are sellable items.

The place is not hard to find.
Once inside, the first thing u will notice is the pretty decor and the welcoming smile of the staff.
I visited this place on 29th november but they had already decorated the inside for christmas, which is a bit too early, but the place looked so pretty with all the christmas lights and other decorative items.
The staff are friendly. 
This place even (apparently) has karaoke.
But coming to the food, it was disappointing.
Firstly the menu has changed a bit. The burger and pizza section is off the board that is the menu, where the items are written down in coloured chalk. Secondly, in comparison to the prices, the food was not filling.
We tried out the veg roll combo ( an apparent veg roll, with cold drinks ) and the kkr veg sandwich. They said the sandwich would have 'loads and loads of cheese'  and veggies, with chips. I admit this was yummy and it did have loads and loads of cheese. But the quantity not really filling. The veg roll tasted weird. It was not all that good.
But thumbs up for ambience and staff behaviour.

Would visit the place a second time if the food were not so over-priced and there were more varieties of food on the menu.

Amazing small, cosy and decorative cafe! You will feel like that you are at home! Mixed sauce pasta was up to the mark! Reasonable rates! Friendly staff.

Location: Situated close to deli cravings, chalkboard is not difficult to find given its right on A.J.C. Bose Road.
Ambiance: small yet cosy, doesn't let you feel that you are sitting right beside one of the busiest roads in Calcutta.

Food: The place has no menu to hand out. All food items and the prices are written on a board. I had ordered pasta aglio olio with chicken and an orange cooler. The pasta was not on their menu, but they were kind enough to make it for me. But what surprised me was the quantity. For 285 rupees, the quantity was extremely less. The taste was good but had a hint of indian spices. The cooler was good. 

Service and Staff: The service  was good and the staff were very polite. I really liked how they agreed to make me an off menu item without a single grudge.

Overall I would have given chalkboard a second visit if only their food items were not so overpriced.

Location: Minto park, near Deli cravings.

As I had to wait for a friend, I decided to sit down and a grab a bite at this cafe.

There are no menu cards, the menu is written on chalkboards. Looking at the available dishes and their prices, the first thing that came to my mind is that this place is desperately over priced.

Not much hungry, I ordered a veg wrap with orange juice.

The juice was basically Tropicana served in a small glass which was already half filled with ice.

The wrap was a plain roti wrapped around 'aloo subzi' and grilled. It came with ketchup and chili sauce.

The wrap was average I'd say. Nothing extra ordinary.

The ladies running this cafe is very very polite and courteous so full marks for that. 

There are board games available here and different props( hats and all) with which u can go click click.

P.S.- the place doesn't have a washroom, so if u wanna wash your hands ask for the sanitizer.
