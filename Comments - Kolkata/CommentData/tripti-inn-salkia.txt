Food quality is good. Accomodation is quite good nd i used to go there i loved the place. So many time i have tried their recipes bt i thnk kabab nd tandoor items are far better than other.

Pretty decent place for lunch or dinner. Ambience is okayish. Food is quite tasty and they serve a good quantity. Staffs are well behaved. Value for money too

It's very adjacent to my house. Once some guests arrived suddenly and we had to arrange some refreshments for them so we chose this one in hurry. But it went in vain. Worthless foods that was. They give more oil and make that very rich which is injurious to health. So I would suggest if you've no other option or have stuck in any certain conditions then go for this restrau.

1 *  for Kabab , the only good thing . Everything is worst , specially Biryani. They add too much dalda on it , u can swim their also. Other Items are also pathetic .

Going through the Uttarpara GT Road this 2 floor Tripti Inn restaurant catches the eye. Big kitchen is on the ground floor & Dining on the 1st floor. Dine is very basic & staffs are late to serve. We shatteled with Chinese here.

Chicken Chowmein : Chowmein served in a plate of very thin quality. It was full of very thin sliced vegetables. It was bit oily & highly fried. Very less chicken pieces were present. Quantity was kind of average. Taste wise it felt very bad than what I expected by seeing it. Even side dish with it didn't played well. They have a lot of chowmein options in their menu but if the plain chicken chowmein is such disappointing then I really doubt about other once.

Lemon Chicken with Honey : Lemon Chicken was served in a plate very odd way, but was garnished well with sliced lemons & herbs. Chicken pieces were big & soft but more cornflower than chicken. Gravy better to say soupy chicken tasted rediculas. Sour & sweet taste of lemon & honey didn't played well with the thick cornflower gravy that they made. Overall a very bad dish that should be avoided over here.

Probably we have gone wrong by ordering Chinese over here, because I saw every other people to have Biryani at that time. But I can't comment about their Indian dishes without trying it. Although every item was priced reasonable over here & our bill for both the items were only Rs. 245 with no added vat & service tax, still for me it goes into reject list.

The food quality is good enuf! We ordered three things, among the three two of them were very spicy. There is two restaurants of "Tripti Inn". Basically we should cal it "Tripti Inns". We ordered: 1. Chicken Tandoori Kebab - Liked it very much. The chicken was fresh enuf. 2. Shezwan Rice and Chicken - Too spicy, although the waiters warned us as we ordered sprite it with it. Omg! I won't mention what happened next.

Tripti Inn is one of the those places where I often go out for dinner... Love their Biriyani and chaanp, tandoori items too... Quality of food is pretty good... But don't try Chinese items here, ( tried once but didn't like it much) as they are much specialised in Mughlai dishes I also love their butter naan, mutton kosha! For snacking you can try their rolls it's awesome!
 Yeh! I Must mention.... price tags are not so high quite pocket friendly! 

Tips: do try their tandoori and kababs.... Quite tasty!

A budget friendly restaurant in outskirts of Kolkata. In accordance with the budget-friendly menu card, the quality of service and food drops as expected. Starter platters are good and so are the Indian dishes. But the quality of Chinese dishes is poor. Even for the suburban locality, the standard of the restaurant is not so good. So the rating will be less than 3.
