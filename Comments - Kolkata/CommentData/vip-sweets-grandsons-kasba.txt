A average pocket friendly sweet shop for the locality. Nothing grand or extraordinary about the place.  The sweets are good and service is nice as well. They have almost all kinds of sweets known to the bongs on offer. Good for people who are not willing to spend a hefty amount at other sweatshops neighboring this place. Overall a decent place.

This is a popular sweet shop in the locality. They provide a variety of sweets at reasonable price. Though they do not make great sweets, the pricing and the variety seem to be okay for daily needs. Recently, they have been experimenting with new items like the baked rasogolla and pastries. I tried the chocolate and butterscotch pastries which were okay for Rs10 each (may be offerred to sudden guests instead of sweets)

This joint is situated very near to my home... and it is one of the worst sweet store in the area... although it is very pocket friendly... but the quality is very bad... I tried some of them and decided to never try anything from here in future... deco was pretty ordinary rather nil... staffs are well mannered... service was not good...

I have been visiting this sweet shop for last 5 years being local resident and frequently see the changes of shop staff and also seen the quality going down like anything.But recently tasted aamsatta sandesh ,baked kalakand & baked mihidana and felt that an improvement has been taken place after speaking to the shop-owner who claimed to be the son-in-law original VIP sweet owner and told me that he has replaced some of his old staff to gain the repute VIP sweets has. Then I have placed recently an order of Rs.2250/- and Rs.1406/- for various sweet packets to be supplied to schools in two different occasion for a change of Balaram Mullick.Ohhhhhh......I had a horrible experience to share.Not only they compromised on the quality of sweets in this bulk order but also packaging was so poor that all boxes got crumbled.Pick up time of the order was 8 a.m in the morning and they were such an unprofessional team that could complete the packing by 8.10 a.m .They said though delivery time was 8 a.m it doesn't mean that package will be ready by 8 a.m and their staff were blaming me why I have not taken the material in the night which made me shocked .Then they started shouting and abusing and literally told with audacity that if I am comfortable with this kind of service then only they will take future orders.The person who took the order was not present and when he came later on justified his staff's behavior.

My earnest request to all residents nearby including Purba,Avisikta etc and all offices who intend to place bulk order plz be careful about their false commitment and inconsistent quality and beware of their unprofessional,rude and monopolistic attitude.

My suggestion to the owner is plz try to get involved personally for bulk orders because if you have such difficulties to execute small order just imagine what harassment your customers may face for big orderS more than 5K OR 10K and how people will get confidence for placing party orders and on brand VIP.Plz educate and train your front office staff to be candid with your customers in a competitive market.

Regards,
Ani

Once while walking from Kasba towards Acropolis Mall, stopped here seeing their beautiful Sandesh. Tasted them which tasted fine and were very fresh. Rosogolla was also very good. A small outlet but serves good sweets.

A descent sweet shop located near Narkelbagan in Kasba. The sweet shop is very old and poorly lit so it doesn't attract that many customers. It is given a tough competition by modern sweet shops such as Balaram Mullick and Banchharam nearby.

Sweets available here are Barfi, Laddu, Kheer Kadom, Talshaas, Rasogolla and other common sweets. Mishti Doi is also available here which is very nice. Talking of snacks, Samosa and Kachori are available here.

As I said earlier, the shop is in a bad shape and requires renovation in order to attract more customers as people have started to prefer Balaram Mullick and Banchharam for their variety and decor.
