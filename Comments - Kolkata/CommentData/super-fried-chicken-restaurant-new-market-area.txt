A small restaurant located just beside the bhoj company with limited number of seats.. I went there few days back for lunch with a friend.. ordered American chicken chopsuey and chicken hakka noodles.. The noodles was like okay but the chopsuey it was a blander just tomato ketchup all over and no other taste.. they doesn't know how to make it.. but the noodle was decent..

Very poor service. They don't even know whether their delivery men's are available or not to go to the desired customer's place. It's been written that home delivery is available but on calling they r telling to order a minimum amount of rs 5000 to rs 6000. Are the guy's mad? U mean who order's food of 5k to 6k? Hahaha lol. If u wanna make fun of yours then only call or go here. Otherwise don't even go to drop your shit in this place.

Substandard food, pathetically slow service with worthless service staffs having zero sense of hospitality. So don't judge the book by its cover. Better help someone poor with some money than to waste it here.

Located at sudder st beside bhoj company and super pub the joint seems to be lifeless.
The only great thing is the Fried chicken which if ordered through the pub costs Rs 150/-otherwise 135/- for two pieces.
The sitting ambience inside looks shady..so my suggestion grab a drink inside the pub and order from the restaurant as the menu is the same!!!

Located near fabulous joints like the Blue Sky Cafe and Raj Spanish Cafe, Super Fried Chicken Restaurant was always going to have a hard time pulling in customers. However, when we went in, they seemed to be doing alright.

The place is extremely small -- won't seat more than 20 people -- your average restaurant trying to make it big in the culinary industry. They offer Chinese and Indian food, but Chinese was all they had when I sat down. This was disappointing, and the fact that they took a while before they served our order didn't help their case.

The service was ordinary and their food was pretty average. The chow reminded me of the kind you'll stumble upon every now and then, and the side (Chicken Dragon) wasn't good. Their chinese does fall short of the mark, and fails to impress the plebian Kolkata culinary crowd. 

Average food. Average experience.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

The Chinese, Indian & continental food here is something which one shouldn't miss.. It's simply my favourite.. My favourite dishes are Dragon chicken, Chicken fried rice & not to miss the Chicken Burger.. The chicken burger is very delicious & filling.. Most importantly the food is very reasonable & the quality is also very good...Quality of Chicken & Fish is very good..Great food & reasonably priced..

Unprofessional behavior on the part of the staff/management and the owner prompted me to write this review. Never have I rated any food joint below 2, no matter how disappointing it may be after all, but this rating and this review is for those who think that they should receive the value for the money they spend on food , service and PROPER behavior from the staff not only because we pay our hard earned money but also expect mere courtesy.

It was 31st afternoon last year. With two of my gal pal, I was walking down the New Market lane soaking up the sun on a winter morning and engaging in happy conversation with both of them. As all of us can imagine, 31st is the day we forget about our past disasters, drink to that and promise to make better decisions and a better life. With that kind of a happy hippie mindset, we started to look for a pub. Inevitably, Fairlawn came to our mind but on the suggestion of another friend from college, we decided to give this one a try. And, it was a mistake!Upon entering, we were greeted by a staff who told us where to sit, which belonged to a shabby side of the pub. Since we desired to get our pictures clicked while enjoying ourselves, we insisted on a table on the other side of the pub. Very promptly we were denied of that particular table, which confuses me even now, as to why we cannot select where we want to sit. We were the only ones to enter at that time but as time passed, people started pouring in, then the sitting issue was not a big deal for them. Only we were denied of our choice. That was the first bad behavior on their part. 

We ordered three beers, one chicken macaroni and one spaghetti chicken. As soon as our food arrived, we noticed that our spaghetti chicken was misplaced by some other food item on the menu. We brought that to the staff's attention but much to our surprise, he blamed it on us that we might have confused it. We decided not to dabble on that and waste time as we were hungry and we would satisfy our hunger with whatever they have served us. And, the price difference of 20 bucks (the item brought to our table by mistake costed more) did not matter. But, then again, it was their second mistake. 

But the time our bill arrived, we noticed that for every item that we ordered, be it the beers or food, we were charged more, atleast 100 bucks more. We immediately called the staff and he said it was their 'special menu' for the 31st, so they revised their prices. Now, we were not informed about this revision of prices before ordering. We ordered from their previous menu card. This was totally unacceptable and unapologetic. We said we would not accept this bill and pay with the original prices. The staff went back to the owner and made us wait 20 minutes before making the necessary changes. Their third mistake. 

And, we, being three girls drinking beer unapologetically, did manage to grab eyeballs from nearby tables, so I cannot even say that their ambiance was nice, given such a thing is very hard to find in a place like Sudder street filled with people from other countries. 

That was my first and last visit here. And, I find absolutely zero reasons of going back.
