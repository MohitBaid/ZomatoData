TERRIBLE - DO not buy from here. Quality and quantity both are miserable. I would have given this a -1 STAR if that option existed.

We are visiting India/Kolkata after a long time and ordered food at home today (Swaraswati puja day) for a quite family lunch of the four of us. The Khichdi was soooo sour - I suspect it was rotten, and it was all water. My mom had to start cooking in a rush because none of what they sent was edible. 

Chutney: there was no more than one spoon full of chutney for 4 people!

Alur Dam: one alu per head.

When we called all we heard was excuse and no real repentance. This kind of quality and response is the halmark of a dishonest busness.

I will recommend NO ONE should buy from here: absolutely disappointing.
