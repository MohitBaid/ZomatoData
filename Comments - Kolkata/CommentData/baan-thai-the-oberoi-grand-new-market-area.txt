Great ambience with great food and service, the phad thai, tom kha and kai yang chicken are a must try items in the menu. Srijita the waitress of the restaurant was very hospitable and spontaneous with our requests, employees like her makes Oberoi hotel second to none in terms of hospitality.

Been to this place couple of times, but never struck to review it.

The menu is the same as it was 5-7 years ago with good options for vegetarians.

for starters we ordered Nam Prik Phao (mushroom is thai sauce) which is clearly the best mushroom starter i have ever tasted. We also ordered Som Tam, which was average. Even in kolkata there are many places which serves better Som tam.

For mains we ordered a veg Pad Thai Which was also ok. It was not Outstanding but nothing to complain about also.

Overall a good experience. 

If u need authentic this food in kolkata Clearly this is one of the best place to go.

Baan Thai is not only about the authentic Thai food; Baan Thai is about the experience. As a brand, there is nothing much to say about Baan Thai, their food tells the story for sure. In Kolkata, Baan Thai is part of The Oberoi Grand and naturally is having the aura of Grand.

There are a few items I prefer whenever I visit the place and the last time was no difference though it was an invitation from their side. For me the must-have dishes are the spicy Papaya Salad (both Som tam and som tam kong sod, the one prepared with prawn), Tom yum Soup ( I prefer the prawn version), and all the version of curries (Red, Green, and Yellow). I had the Yellow one last time with Chicken base and it was super comforting. We were served with the stir fry as well which I had for the first time there and liked a lot. When it comes to Phad Thai, they know how to please the guests with the spiciness of Thailand and last time was no exception. The comforting coconutty dessert needs a mention too.

"The Oberoi Grand Kolkata" as soon as you hear this name immediately what comes to your mind is the ambiance, the service & the quality. Right??

Baan Thai, located in The Oberoi Grand, serves excellent, expensive Thai Food. The food is delicious, well presented and the service extremely professional. The restaurant space is itself very beautiful, open completely, spacious, well lit with bright red chairs and tables well apart from each other. A perfect date. The waiters were very welcoming too.

If you know how to order in such a place, you'll get your money worth. 

For the Drinks, 
We had Calcutta Cooler and Virgin Mojito was just good but not too good I must say. Specially the Calcutta Cooler. Just taste horrible.

For the starters, 
We ordered Kai Hor Bai (Wrap Chicken). Six pieces of yummy Chicken wrapped around with some leaves. The quantity too was just right! 
and
Kluay Thod :  Easily the best dish of the day. The smokey flavor opens up and fills your senses at each bite.

For the mains, 
We chose the K K Wan Pla (Green THAI) with rice as per the waiter's recommendation. But this awful dish was not that good and even the salt was not enough. The white rice also felt slightly under-cooked. They definitely need to work on this food item.

However, the best part of the meal was definitely saved for the last!

I called for a Tub Tim Samsee, and it was delicious! It was the best samsee i have ever tried and a few things with it balance out the flavors in your mouth perfectly!
and
Coated Banana with ice cream was normally good. But Tub Tim Samsee was too great.

All in all, it was a very pleasant experience! The ambiance, the service and good food (specially starters and desserts <3 ) made for a very fulfilling lunch!

The grand is indeed grand. And as expected,  baan thai is equally awesome.  It has continued to spread the red carpet for foodies for ages and will do so for many more years.  The call of the antique furniture, the colonial outlook along with ultimate luxury is something that can't be denied.  Amazing food and drinks.  Especially the naan and kulcha - the best I ever had.

As usual an amazing place and an award winning cuisine. Beholds the old world charm. The feel is colonial bustling expensive place. Quaint music adds on to the value. Food is out of the world. Service is superbly personalised. It is an experience that will make you go there again and again. It truly is a heritage that everyone should experience at least once.

It was a celebration of a Birthday & so our destination was Baan Thai. The Oberoi Grand is our favourite place to celebrate any special occasion. The ambience the staff & most importantly the cuisine always makes you feel special. The Baan Thai restaurant serves authentic Thai food & so when the Chef came to meet & greet us, we were happy to share our thoughts.

One of the very few places that touches not just the taste buds but Heart, I still knew My father use to work at Ban Thai back in 2004 (Subhas Mitra) I came to see him, well i was astonished back then, after 13 years I went to this place to taste the food which is so famous. 
Fantastic is a small word....

From food to service everything was marvelous... 

Very polite staff.... 

Food was terrific... Well its The Oberoi Grand :)

Best Thai Cuisine - Calcutta. 😇

Baan Thai of Oberoi Grand is the best restaurant for Thai food, leave alone Kolkata may be it's one of the top three restaurants in India.

Classy and Best doesn't come cheap but it's worth the price you pay.

Thai green curry is my personal favourite 😍

A must visit if you love thai food, service is excellent and as you expect in an Oberoi f&b outlet.

Happy Eating 🤗

Went back to Baan Thai after a few years and was very disappointed by the appalling service. For a 5 star, charging premium rates, the service expectation is quite high. But this has become one of the places where you have to complain every step of the way. We went on 15th Mar for dinner. There were 5 of us and 2 were guests of the hotel itself. From the very beginning it was lousy service. The bottled water took ages to come, the wine choice (a French chiraz) was accepted by the waiter only to be told 10 minutes later that it was not available (we settled for an Australian instead). The mocktails (mango passion or punch) took another 20 minutes to come and despite telling them to serve them without ice, came ice laden. We asked for vinegar with green chillies and that took another 15 minutes to come. The waiter was clueless about the menu details. Everything was painstakingly slow. The saving grace was the food. It was delicious and had the same taste as before. The satays were beautifully done and the thai green curry was splendid. And much later, Chef Krishna came to our table and after hearing our woes, went back and cooked us the most delicious wok tossed chicken with cashews and lemongrass. 

To summarise:
Food: Excellent
Service: Appalling

One of the very few places that touches not just the taste buds but also the heart and makes a lasting impression. I was staying at Oberoi which was recommended for its heritage and hospitality and I can vouch that it has lived upto every word of it. 

The breakfast spread is something that one should definitely try. The uniqueness here is not in the mere variety but the customisation and perfection that is attached to every dish on the menu. I swear I have not had better looking/tasting omelette & poached eggs before. 

The Ala carte menu for the major meals is on a different league altogether. Would recommend the Glassy Phad Thai noodles with Asparagus and water chestnut gravy that is subtle, light and full of delicate flavours. If you thought that they only specialise in Thai, then you are mistaken - the Bengali thali is as authentic as it can get. For the desserts, the Cube is absolutely sinful and to die for. 

Chef Saurav & Rajat, a special mention to the two of them for churning out such beautiful dishes and adding a personal touch too. 

Waiting to go back, again!

One of the finest 5 star standard hotel's restaurant is baan thai so expectations were also high and they did well.

The entrance the decoration all have a mark of class.


We ordered biryani as it was 3.30 and the thai kitchen was closed and the biryani was very hood .

Taita was so nice.


Specialities 

1.  All food are served with silver spoon fork dagger 

2. Glasses are wine glasses.

3. Quality and sophistication

Ban Thai is one of the best places in the city to try authentic Thai cuisine. The name of the items on the menu are confusing but don't worry, a detailed description in English is also provided. We had ordered  Pla neueng manao, which is a dish made with bhetki fish. We had Kai Krathium prik Thai. It was a chicken dish made with garlic pepper sauce. And we had Chicken Khao Phad which is nothing but Chicken Rice Noodles. All the dishes tasted lovely. The desserts wasn't upto the mark. I had a Tub tin samsee. It was jellied water chestnut in coconut milk. Didn't like it that much. The ambiance and the courtesy of the staffs is quite nice as well.

Visited this  most renowed and best Thai restaurant in Kolkata last Saturday for lunch to treat on the occasion of brothers day after so many recommendations from my friends. We arrived almost a few mins before their Thai kitchen was closing for the day for lunch. My palette felt for the first time about the royal taste of Thai food starting from the appetizers - fish cake, chicken wrapped in banana leaf to the their main course - Prawn chicken pad thai and Tenderloin in green curry - each one stands unique in terms of its aromatic Thai flavoured with lemon grass and authentic thai spices and mind blowing taste - in one word it was just outstanding. For the sweet tooth they presented with 2 signature desserts from their bakery - cube (amazing presentation) and Devil Wich Fins (Belgium chocolate ice cream cake topped with hot cream) which was simply out of the world. Last but not the least great ambience , warm 5 star hospitality and yes of course the pocket pinch no doubt is very high - 5 star class. :-)

There was a time when food experience was the best at Baan Thai. However due to renovation at the hotel this is the only restaurant which is operational and hence probably the goof ups. The waiter took our soup and main course order and vanished. After waiting for quite a while we asked when the soup would arrive and he look baffled. He had forgotten to place the order with the kitchen for the soup. Instead of making amends immediately, he asked a silly question like "Can I offer the soup after the main course?" I was there with guests and have never had such an experience at any restaurant. There was no senior waiter available for us to complain to - only the silly waiter who kept disturbing us with his whining apologies!!

My favorite Thai restaurant in Kolkata.. coming from Oberoi, fantastic service is expected (and they deliver). The decor is nice (and Thai), seating sections carefully designed (including sit in private sections) and the food impeccable. I am a big fan of their fish preparations, as well as soups and salads. Normally only opens for dinner during weekdays, but with some restoration work in the hotel, is open for lunch these days. Wine collection is nice if you like a drink!

The Oberoi Grand of Calcutta, popularly known as the “Grand Hotel”, is a reminiscent of the city’s glorious past and its Colonial elegance. It was once billeted by the WWII soldiers and was the choice of US Marines for their Balls.
It was the Mahanavami of the Durga Puja in Calcutta and almost all restaurants in the city were busy serving their Puja special Bengali dishes. We had cravings for something different and wanted to avoid the heavily crowded joints. We did not visit Grand Hotel before. Since La Terrasse was closed for renovation, Ban Thai was the choice.

There are certain places in Kolkata, which, over a period of time, have achieved the cult status and has gained a certain follower base of their own. In fact, the follower base is such strong that, if a certain dish is presented in a new way, the management is flooded with complaints. One such place is Baan Thai in The Oberoi Grand. Recently, I was invited to taste their Indian Spirits Cocktail and Oodles Of Noodles Festival and following is my experience.

Statutory warning: The Oberoi has got a certain aura of classiness surrounding the whole property and they prefer to maintain it that way. So, if you’re looking to indulge into royal treatment and are ready to pay THE price for it, welcome, else, just enjoy the review here.

As I said, these guys understood service.So, instead of serving us the full set of cocktails and getting us drunk on a weekday afternoon, they provided us with one full cocktail for experiencing the looks and shooting and for tasting purpose, we were given shots of each. But, we were assured, if we needed, full cocktails can also be provided. The cocktails were a blend of stunning finishing (looks-wise) and some strange recipes. The taste of each of them was awesome to say the least. But among all of them, my winner was Southern Somras- which I’ll try again in near future. P.S: The cocktails are priced at 975/-+ Tax each portion

Next came the food and it was a wide spread. Frankly, this was my first visit to Baan Thai and I was mightily impressed. For me, a great restaurant consists of non only great food, but great service- and this was THE place. The prompt service, knowledge  of servers was commendable and the best part was, I could find my water tumbler full at all times (thise who follow my blog, know that I’m quite finicky about this aspect, at least in a fine dining outlet).

Now, thai food for me is something where there is a riot of flavors, yet, none overpowering others. Its basically a flow of different flavors making love with one another and becoming something else. This balance is what I find in all the Thai joints and here, the journey was seamless. We were served a full meal and following are the items.

Among all the items, my favorite was the soup firstly. The subtle flavor of the stock was out of the world. Among starters, though I am not much of a prawn lover, the deep fried prawn was out of the world and in the main course section, though a little spicy, the seafood soba noodles was brilliant. The dessert was not in the menu card, but ended the meal perfectly.

Overall the experience was brilliant. Earlier I used to think why this place was so much praised, but now I can understand. So, if you’re looking for a classy evening with Thai food, here’s the place. Portion sizes are huge and can easily be shared. Pocket pinch: for a couple should be around 5000/-.

Will I visit again ? off course yes.

Bon Apetite !!!

Comments and critics welcome.

There is luxury, and then there is heritage and history. The Oberoi Grand is a melange of all three. My first visit to Oberoi Grand's Pan Asian restaurant, Baan Thai was during their Oodles of Noodles festival (on till end of this month). The festival has a specially curated menu consisting of some of the most gastronomically delightful oriental delicacies along with interesting Indian cocktails. That day being one of my vegetarian days, I was impressed by the vegetarian choices on the menu. Among the many choices in the appetisers, I tried the Stir Fried Tofu Dumplings with Thai chilly on crispy noodles. The Noodle soup with vegetables was absolutely beautiful and delicate. Among the main course, the stir fried glass noodles won my heart. To be honest this was the first time I ever tried Glass Noodles, and I look forward to more of it. The best of the lot would be the cocktails. They had Sharabi Lassi concocted out of Bailey's Irish Cream, White rum and Lassi, The Southern Somras consisting of dark rum, apple juice, tamarind and jaggery (the clear winner). Others included the Mojito Banaraswala which was garnished with a betel leaf and actually contained gulkand, Vodka Shikanji, Herbal Way and Chaitini (vodka with chai and cream).

Thailand is possibly one of my favorite holiday destinations and one of the most important reasons is the absolutely splendid food you get there. I don’t know if it’s the warmth of the people, the delicious food or the holiday mood but I have very happy memories of all my visits there. There are very few places in Kolkata that serve up good Thai food and Ban Thai certainly tops that list in my opinion. The décor is exquisite and you feel transported to Thailand as soon as you enter. The service as with Oberoi Hotels is exemplary and the staff always go out of their way to make you feel cherished and pampered. Naturally when I was invited as one of the bloggers for their Öodles of Noodles” Festival I was rather delighted.

I have been to Baan Thai on two separate occasions. I do not particularly enjoy Thai food but, I like the fact that it is a curry driven cuisine and it's always refreshing to try curries that are not Indian. Baan Thai pleasantly surprised my palette. It made me find Thai food appetizing.

Try their Som Tam Salad, Tom Kha Soup, Chicken Panaeng Curry, Kai Krathium Prik Thai Chicken, Pad Thai noodles, jasmine bamboo rice and Kluay Thod (desert). The curry was rich yet tart with a tanginess on the side. The desert was interestingly laced with bags of flavour and not sharply sweet.

The ambience and service is far better than many other five star restaurants and hotels I have been too. If you don't like Thai food so far, Baan Thai might help you rethink that.

I stayed at the hotel on an official trip. My expectation from the restaurant was that of any other star hotels. But this one exceeded clearly and stood out from the lot. Their attention to details is incredible. Every dish that I had was so carefully and flawlessly prepared. The mulligatawny soup and princes omelette are to die for. Must visit place when in Kolkata

Last week we ate at Baan Thai for the first time. The ambiance was lovely, we walked in and were seated right away. 

Service - Our server was very well informed and could guide use to selecting an incredible dinner. 
Food - As a starter we ordered the Laab Kai - this is a chicken mince salad. It was nice but nothing spectacular. 
Next we had the Moo Yang - this was a Bbq pork with pineapple, honey and chilli, and it was delicious, tangy, crispy, sweet, spicy a perfect example of taste blending that Thai food is known for. 
Next came the prawn Phad Thai - flat noodles with tamarind and peanuts, again yummy. The balance of flavors were just right, the serving huge. 
We ended our dinner with a signature dish of the The Oberoi Grand, the baked Alaska. Not sure why is so famous. Tasted a bit like a kitchen experiment gone wrong. It was served with a lot of panache and looked beautiful but once you dug in it was an over frozen disaster. 
Will defiantly go back here for the Thai food.

This review is for an older version. When I visited for a celebration held by our school, we didn't really have Thai. Instead we had lamb, chocolate pudding, nan, an assortment of dal and different curries veg and non-veg, all were wonderful!! The lamb so soft, the ice-cream and pudding like i've never had before, so tasty, so beautiful, wonderful ambience, great staff. Worth a visit again!! Recomemded.

NOTE: This review is for La Terressa Coffee Shop and not Baan Thai actually. However, the coffee show is under renovation and we were served the coffee shop menu at the restaurant. Hence I am writing this review under Baan Thai.

LOCATION:

Situated inside the affluent Oberoi Grand hotel near New Market Kolkata. Baan Thai is the Thai restaurant and La Terressa is the coffee shop.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

The Oberoi Grand hotel is one of the best looking buildings surviving from the British Raj in India. It is truly grand to look at and the look and feel of the hotel is as close as you can get to truly being in a luxurious and royal environment in Kolkata. The lobby is beautifully maintained and every element of the hotel stays true to its old roots. Baan Thai is located on the ground floor and is not difficult to find.

The interiors are great and I liked the wood work all around. It reminded me of a place in Bangkok called "Face" which is one of the best restaurants for authentic Thai food in Bangkok.

WINE & DINE:

We ordered for the following:

Chicken Kathi Roll -- This was a decent dish. There was nothing wrong with it. But then I was not expecting the usual Kathi Roll you would get in any cafe. Chicken was in generous quantity and a side portion of french fries added to the dish.

Mezze platter -- Again a decent dish. Assortment of dips such as Hummus, Muhammara amongst others with pita, falafel and Tabouleh Salad. I like the concept of make your own falafels a lot. That was, you can make each of them taste different. 

Oberoi Kebab Platter -- Which came with Tandoori Aloo, Paneer Tikka, Tandoori Broccoli and Seekh Kebab. This was good and was served with a Mint Chutney, small portion of Dal Makhani and a Butter Naan. I liked the Paneer Tikka but found the rest of the Kebabs to be average.

Asian Noodle Bowl -- This was our best dish in the mains. The Broth was perfectly seasoned and the stir fried vegetable on top was very good. I would go back for this one !.

Service in the beginning was quite slow and bad. We requested for a bread basket and prawn crackers which took ages to come. Maybe it was because Baan Thai staff was not trained to take care of La Terressa guests. But then towards the second half of lunch after having complained about it, they stepped it up and gave us great  service including a complimentary portion of the ice cream sandwich and mangoes with ice cream. The ice cream sandwich was a show stealer. The best of the evening. 

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Service needs to be consistent throughout. Also dishes were good but then when you are at a premium coffee shop, you expect some excitement and uniqueness as well. They should be more innovative with the dishes. At present they are the usual dishes done usually well.

VERDICT:

Great colonial feel, luxurious ambience, good service and decent food Plus they do not charge luxury tax and service charge. Maybe the only 5-star restaurant in the city to follow that. Highly Recommended !!

Thai cuisine has always been my favourite... there are other less priced restaurants too but nothing beats Baan Thai. The fact that they belong to the gorgeous Oberoi brand, can be felt at every step, from decor to service to food.
Elegant... beautiful... outstanding...!!!!

A visit to this restaurant was very high on my wish list. So when I found this place listed among those which will allow diners to try out some of their signature dishes for significantly reduced prices for the Restaurant Week India, I didn't waste the opportunity. 

Upon entering this place I was highly impressed with the décor. This is one elegant dining place in one classy Hotel. Covered with wooden panels and decorated with Thai motifs, this restaurant oozes class and sophistication.

Now coming to the main part, the food. We tried out eleven different dishes in all. The starters consisted of mango and cucumber salad, Thai fish cakes and chicken wrapped in leaves. All were very good and set the right tone for our meal. For the mains, we went for the Thai red curry, stir fried lamb, the fish and fried rice and the flat noodles as staples. The one stand-out dish of the evening turned out to be the Thai red curry which came with a small portion of steamed rice. Better than anything I have tasted in Thailand or in fact anywhere. The fried rice and lamb was awesome too. But the noodles and the fish didn't quite measure up to the standards of the other dishes. In the dessert section, the wasabi with the white chocolate and the cheese cake both tasted great, but the real star was the jellied water chestnut in coconut milk. It provided a really sweet ending to a great meal.

The service was very professional but at times tad slow. I guess they were preparing items from scratch. Another point to note. The portions here are too small, so not much room for sharing. This can make it one VERY expensive place, even by five star standards. But what you will be getting in return for such high prices will also be of a very high standard. So I highly recommend this place for special occasions.

This is my first visit to a 5 star hotel's restaurant in Kolkata (have landed in kolkata just abt 15 days before). 

Price: Baan thai,  is a bit pricey ( but then being a part of oberoi group,  isnt it expected to be? ) 

Ambience -  Super Epic. 
Situated at the heart of the city, you will fall in love with its ambience. 

Food: Unlike usual 5 star restro, baan thai's served food is delicious. Standing to its name, it serves exquisite Thai food. 

A perfect place to spend an evening in the lap of luxury (considering the fact that you can afford :p)

This is an all time favourite place of mine at the heart of Kolkatta for its Majestic & history. I simply love this place for the feelings you will have once you enter the Oberio Grand. The food is really yummy. I have visited this quite a number of time & each time its a new feeling I have as if this the first time. I always feel that sitting here time flies away and very quickly the time goes.

Situated on the lobby level of the Grand Oberoi, Baan Thai specializes in food from Thailand. The cuisine is tastefully represented in the interiors which borrows heavily from classic thai design elements with dark teak wood panelling, splashes of red and orange, classy parquet flooring , oriental touches like dragons and traditional 'Kuntok' seating ( thai style low seating with a sunken area for leg space ) along with contemporary chairs and tables, beautiful candles elegantly lighting up the space all contributing to this visually stunning restaurant replicating the atmosphere and spirit of thailand . The food that we had was not only an aesthetic treat but also a culinary one , served with traditional hospitality and warmth of a Thai home as the name suggests.
Starting off the dinner with two starters , CHICKEN HORMOK , which was steamed minced chicken and kaffir lime with ginger, wrapped in banana leaf and THOD MAN PLA or thai fish cakes with long beans served with a bowl of plum sauce were individually brilliance served in our plates , and we were so enthralled to have such a delightful start!
We kept on munching on the potato crackers and kimchee salad while waiting for our mains to arrive, but the time taken was waaaaay too much(almost 40minutes or more) to give a full score to the overall experience.
However after repeated enquiries, the main courses were served , comprising a portion each of PATANI , Stir fried lamb with ginger and spring onion ; PHAD SIE EIU , wok tossed flat rice noodles with vegetables ; KHAO PHAD, Thai hot and sour fried rice with chicken and KAENG KIEW WAN , the very famous thai chicken green curry with steamed rice. The first time i tasted a green curry , so i am unable to rate or compare but loved it after having the very first spoon. Phad sie could be improved and the rice and lamb dish were nice as well , if not exquisite.
Finally it was dessert time , we got WHITE CHOCOLATE AND WASABI CREAM,DRIED BERRY MERINGUE,RED WINE SAUCE which was something confusing and we did not find that very palatable as well , but what bowled us over was the fantastic CANDIED ORANGE CHEESE CAKE WITH BERRY YOGURT SORBET , it was an instant hit !
The management and chef teams deserve acknowledgment and applause for delivering such delectable food with impeccable hospitality and assuring the dinners with an authentic Thai gourmet experience at Baan Thai.

Tried authentic thai cuisine with shrimp and fish cake as appetizers and virgin mojito which were well made. Then  tried something spicy for the main course starting with pad Thai chicken noodles accompanied with kaeng phed (red curry) prawn and plain rice which turned out to the best.

I took my mother and sister and their friends to Ban Thai.   My mother, who is 77, said that it was the best food she has eaten in her life.  I will not go so far, but I must say that the chef, Rajat Mukherjee, is supremely talented.  Let him order for you. You will not be disappointed.Prof. Utpal Bhattacharya

The ambiance was royal, and the place is aptly decorated in keeping with the grandeur of the hotel. The service was a little slow, but we didn't mind the small gap between the courses. 
The food was very good and the serving dishes were rather nice. But the best came at the end, in the form of desserts. The kaffir like crème brulé was out of the world! Undoubtedly the best crème brulé I have ever had. And also, one portion was more than enough for two people. 
Just one thing, the lighting might be too dim for some.

During our visit to Kolkata, we walked into Baan Thai for a late night drink and snack. As you would expect from the Oberoi, this Thai restaurant is tastefully done. Huge statue at the entrance, dim and pretty lighting, plush and comfortable seating, rose candle on the table, the dinner seemed like a candle light one. The waitresses were dressed in authentic Thai outfit, but waiters weren't. We were told that we were dining on a special week. 

Some crispies and Thai pickled salad was served on the table while we placed our orders of red wine and beer, fried spring roll, and some noodles. The service was prompt, the waitresses were extremely courteous and refilled the crispies before we could request for extra. Beer was served cold in a chilled glass, wine in a traditional wine glass, noodles were good enough for two, tasted quite authentic as well. We didn't try other Thai dishes here, so the review is based on the limited food experience we had here. The bill was slightly on the higher side, which is expected. We spent few hours here having a good conversation over drinks, without being disturbed. My experience here was a pleasant one.

Thai food at its best - And Baan Thai  definitely the best for Thai food in Town . 
Starters - Por Pia Thod : Spring rolls - i tried the veg ones - i felt it was nothing exceptional but what made it exception was the sweet yet a little tangy and spicy sauce . 
Kai Takrai if i am not mistaken - Diced chicken with Lemon grass , mushrooms and i guess Chestnuts and the lime leaf - kafir lime leaf gives a wonderful essence and a rich flavour to it . 
Coming to the desserts - Loved the Chocolate 
Decadent - with Raspberry compote and the coffee bean Ice-Cream 
I am definitely coming back for the love of 'Thai Food'

I think the best thai restaurant maybe in the country if not in the city. Also could be one of the oldest only thai restaurants in the city. Have been going here forever and am still loving it. The place is very consistent with high quality superb food. The papaya salad phaad thai green curry jasmine rice are regular favourites. Love some of the new menu intros as well. Even the ambience with the thai decor is very soothing along with impeccable service by staff dressed in the thai theme making the feeling of eating here even more authentic. Its a great place to have a meal with family.

The first time I ate here was 17/07/1997.It was a special day and started a love affair that continues to this day.

The first authentic thai restaurant in Kolkata was twinkle fung shway at Dover Lane,followed by Thai tonight at b.c.road,ar Han Thai at bentinck street and Baan Thai at the Grand.Two of the above have closed down but baan Thai is still going strong with little or no change in the menu or decor.

Our staples are the chicken minced salad,the squid and prawn salad,the Tom yum and the Tom kha soups,the asparagus with chestnuts,the stir fried pork,chicken red curry,the chicken massaman curry and if available the sticky rice with mango or their banana dessert.The rice comes with the curry and the chef provides a spicy chilli sauce if you love it hot,like I do.

Barring a couple of instancesI have never had the occasion to complain and while the prices are on the higher side,the taste,the aftertaste,the authentic wooden decor and smiling service makes it worthwhile.Expect to be here for a couple of decades more....

Good food and even greater service 😀😀

The service and hospitality was impeccable and purely 5 star in the true sense.

The food however was little spicy even inspite of requesting otherwise. However the flavours were bang on and the portion size was huge.

The price paid is worth the penny.

It's advisable to go for larger group if you  want to try out a variety of things as the portion sizes are big to be completed b 2 people.

The Ban Thai has been around for some ttime now and is the Numero Uno place for Thai Food in the City. Dining at the Grand is anyway a great experience and has retained its Elegant,Old World charm and atmosphere. The Ban Thai is beautifully setup,the ambience,decor,table settings , the service and most of all the menu repertoire are Classic Oberoi.On entering the place you immediately feel at ease and relaxed and all set for a gastronomic experience.They have maintained reasonable authenticity of cusine to the point that dishes such as prawns maintain a certain rawness as opposed to over cooking which Indian palates like. Rawness of seafood and meats to an extant aswell as fresh crispiness of vegetables is native to oriental cusine and the diner should be prepared for this if looking for originality. The vast but select menu has some great dishes which you will savour and remember and certainly head back to when looking for good Thai food. The seafood particularily is of an excellent standard,flavoursome and fiery at times,mild flavoured but scrumptous,the veggies are to be had crisp and not limp and soggy and this Ban Thai excells in. A dining experience for the Thai aficianados !!They have an excellent selection of wines and champaigns while the exotic cocktails are real thirst quenchers and great starters. Dont look at the price list--its the GRAND folks and not Chopsticks !! A word of advice--dont spoil the elegance by using your flash and selfies. Enjoy,savour and experience each moment and remember THE experience !!

The chain is known for its hospitality, and to residents they're exceptionally nice. On the contrary, if you're not staying you can't be too sure. I've eaten as both a resident and a guest, and the service differs. However, the food is of course, meticulously prepared. The ambience is wonderful, and service good, but the staff was not exceptionally knowledgeable about the Thai cuisine and culture as should be expected. 

Ordered Pad thai noodles, some gravy, spring rolls, tom Yum soup. The portions are huge. I have failed to finish it each time. Drinks are expensive!

The food was excellent, with the green curry easily the best in the city. The prices are definitely on the more expensive side, but all in all, worth it.

Went to baan thai with a friend last night. If i had my way i would get the manager to pay me back plus pay for a detox. GHASTLY food. We got- corn cakes-- tasty but overfried to blackness. Glassnoodle salad was swimming in sauce, which was neither thai nor indian but horribly spicy. We got it it changed and it cMe back as a dessert!! Baan thai is magical ! Red curry-- take some chicken curry, throw in thai spices and foodcoloring , lots of salt sugar and other liver killing shit, serve it to customer and charge them their monthly salary. Paad thai-- take some rice noodles, put crumbled tofu , tamarind and call it thai food. cheesecake-- freeze it, take it put of freezer, make sure its old, save10 rs by reducing cheese cake and increasing base size and Serve for 800 Rs. Call this meal gourmet and shove it down stupid brown and white peoples throats. If u wNt to donate money to oberoi grand for crap food, this is the place to go. People think kolkatans are stupid and no one knows what thai food tastes like.

We called for the steamed fish cakes which was yummy and i lobed the dip served with it! For main course we had prawn thai fried rice.... The rice was yummy but the prawn was overdone and rubbery... Along with the chicken green curry which was yummylicious! I ebjoyed every bit of the meal with good hospitality!

Have been to Baan Thai 2 times. Both the times the food has been a perfect execution of Thai cuisine, the ambience has been nothing less than regal and the hospitality has been bright example of Thai culture.

Ordered the green Thai chicken curry at the first instance, the paste and the spices were carefully blended.
On the second instance, I ordered the Tom kha gai, the barbecue pork with honey and pineapple and finally the cheese cake.
The soup was spot on, the flavours of lemon grass, coconut milk and thai ginger were distinct yet subtle. The barbecue was tender, I was served complimentary Thai rice. Dessert was the perfect contrast of a yummy cheesecake, bitter chocolate and frozen strawberry.

All in all a dinner worth remembering and a place worth revisiting. In my book one of the best speciality restaurants in Kolkata.

Horrible experience at the OBEROI GRAND KOLKATA at the BAN THAI restaurant . 
I made reservations for the family for dinner as we wanted to celebrate moms birthday in advance but as we entered the restaurant the attendant stopped me and said we could not dine as I was in slippers . 
I was really taken aback and felt offended as while making a reservation it was not brought to my notice that they have bought up this rule . I respect their policy but they should have mentioned it while making my reservation . 
How the hell would one know of this silly outrageous rule . 
Besides I was wearing my new Gucci slippers while looked far formal to all the dirty sneakers some men were wearing . I think they should redefine their meaning of formal dressing . 
However the manager was stubborn and said he would put us up at the coffee shop and serve the good there . How dare he and why should I suffer for their mistake and they should have bent their rules as it was their error. 
I walked out with a hungry 5 year old daughter and disappointed parents and wifey. Would never ever return back to done there . 
Height of unprofessionalism, arrogance and thumbs down to the hotel and the management . Very disappointed and furious .


The management called today for apologies . Offered to send me ban Thai food home too . Finally they insisted on sending a cake for moms birthday and gave their personal no. To make reservations henceforth and would take special care for us. Alls well that ends well . I must say that was very thoughtful .

When it comes to Thai food in Kolkata ... this is the Mecca ! They taught kolkata what thai food was . and i am too  small a person to be critiquing it . With the best interiors , warmest staff and very professional service Baan Thai is nothing short of perfection. 

i went to this outlet first when i was 10 years old and since then i consider this pretty much a benchmark in Thai food . 
The green curry is to die for some of the other must haves according to me are : The tom kha soup ( simply love the coconutty goodness ! 

the mee crob and the fish cakes are delicious , I love the laab kai salad , and the chicken with basil is killer . 

I have always come back very happy from here and there has never been even slight speculation that Baan Thai is simply Brilliant !

Awesome. I think if you love Thai cuisine then only option in Kolkata 
However spicy option should be more. The only thing missing is scallop and rice steamed dumplings. 
They must see scallop dish at taj. Made by Srinivasan at chinosseri

My best friend from Bangalore decided on Baan Thai after hearing it was the best place in town  for thai  and it lived up to its expectations.The restaurant is very elegant and the staff courteous as expected from a five star dining.We started with the Tom kha soup- it was a bit bland and the fresh coconut milk flavour didnt really come through.The rest of the meal however was superlative.The Satay Kai-chicken satay was succulent and the peanut dipping sauce perfect.The fish cakes were good with the plum sauce.We opted for my husband's favourite chicken red curry(Kaeng phed) and sticky rice.I felt  it was average and a bit indianised for my taste though the portions were pretty large.The best part of the dinner was the Phad thai,simply the best i have eaten so far.Definitely a wonderful place for expensive thai fine dining.

This is the best Thai restaurant in town. Period. Each and every time I go here I am blown away by the quality and the taste of the food. the service is always greats as well, it has to be since it is a restaurant in a five star hotel. The staff (personnel) keeps changing from time to time but what remains constant is the warmth and courteousness of the staff. The decor is very elaborate as well and I love the small cubicles they have where one has to sit i the floor and dine as on would in a Thai household. Since I have been to THD what I have come to learn is that the menu here comprises of some very authentic Thai preparations and some which are altered a bit to suit the Indian taste bud. But one this note I might also add that most of the dishes served here are not what Thais have on a daily basis. They have these during celebrations and festivities and parties and so on. But I am not complaining. Who wants regular day to day food on the table in a five star restaurant! First come the prawn crackers with a nice prawn-y aroma and taste with a red sauce. The Thail papaya salad is a must try, one may also try their soups. The appetizers are also awesome, must trys being the satays be it pork, chicken or prawn and the prawn rolls. The curries are awesome....all of them the red, the green, the panang, the masaman every single one of them are just fantastic. There is a huge variety of Thai grills available and I haven't had them all but the ones that I have had, I have been completely floored by. If one is a noodles person ensure that you don't miss the phad thai and the phad ki mao. They have to be ordered with one of the main course items though, unless one is really noodles-obsessed. My favourite desserts are the water chestnut jellies, the rambutan with ice cream, the palm sugar pudding and the coconut custard. Don't look at the value for money aspect but look at the value addition aspect. each and every time I dine here i go back with an experience I cherish and remember for a long time. And whenever the memories of my last meal here starts to wane I go back to Baan Thai.

I recently visited the restaurant after 10 long years during my stay at Calcutta. Baan Thai is definitely fancy and so was my dining experience, not much in terms of the food but for the ambience.
 
Ambience:
The place is great, nicely decked up. It is everything anybody expects of a 5-star. The nice crowd, the hospitable staff, the decor, all makes up for a nice dining experience.

Food:
The menu is huge and I regret sticking to the same old tried & tested dishes, would definitely try out their pork and other dishes the next time I’m there. Anyway so we started our dinner by ordering the following-
	Satay kai- which was basically chicken skewers, it was nicely cooked and the peanut sauce to go with it was delicious.
	Tom kha soup- it is a famous Thai soup. It was tasty but I found it to be a little on the bland side.
	Kaeng pa (chicken) and (veg) with steamed rice- the infamous thai red curry, it was good but nothing to die for.
	 Phad thai (chicken)- Thai flat rice noodles was sweet and sour and really tasty.

By the time we finished diner, there was no space left for deserts so we decided to skip it.

Pricing:
A 5-star after all, the restaurant is quite expensive.

Overall I had a pleasant dining experience, definitely a place for Thai lovers.

Had a very ordinary experience in Banthai. There were 5-6 people who served our table. At least three times, we had to ask the people to serve us the second helping of our food. We couldn't serve it ourselves either as they kept the food at a nearby table. 

The food was fine as it is usually at Banthai. The interiors were great too and is always a pleasure. 

You do not expect such poor service at an elite restaurant though.

fantabulous ...Thats what i have to say about BAAN THAI,  I Stayed with The Oberoi Grand in April'13 , Heard a lot about this THAI restaurant and its food from my mates. 
So decided to pay a visit as i was feeling good  that day and wanted to treat my self with class and awesome food.

Ambiance : Very Much traditionally Thai ... Staff dressed in beautiful traditional Dress.Light music playing in BG gives you a soothing feeling .

Food : I went in for Khaeng phad ( red curry veg dish) with khao Phad Rice..Firstly.. the Portions were ample for two.. the aroma of basil and richness in curry was exceptionally good... with just perfectly cooked veggies.. It just re defined my taste for Thai food, i miss that in delhi...
 
Hospitality and service : Hospitality from staff a warm welcome and quick to attend and take order, and better thing was it was easy to catch an eye even when food is ordered or on table... which does lacks in many places... quick on serving food and very nicely served by Staff.

Overall :
Ambiance : 4.5/5
Food/Taste : 5/5
Service : 4/5
Value for Money : 4/5

Yes  A must visit if you want to pamper your taste buds and treat your self with awesome food.

Being Friendship's Day - 4 of us decided to make it special by dining at Baan Thai. Of course like always it was a sudden random plan. We were quite late for the 2:45 pm last order ( didn't like the fact that a 5 star has such rules) hence we had to literally place the order over the phone to a friend who had just about made it time for the "last order". 
The food was undoubtedly one of the best Thai food that I've gotten to eat in Kolkata ! We ordered the usual - papaya salad with peanuts - phad Thai noodles - Thai red curry with jasmine rice and stir fry veggies with tofu in garlic sauce ! All the dishes were perfect! But keeping the food aside - the place was pretty dead for a 5 star standard. They really really need to redo the whole place up !  With a 30% discount coupon that we luckily had our bill came up to Rs. 4800 /- for the 4 of us ( of course this included 2 glasses of wine as well) 
All in all I would love to keep going back for the yum authentic Thai food!

When you are willing to indulge your taste buds to the best of the cuisines, pay a visit here. Having said that, I absolutely love Baan Thai for both quality and quantity, and the price is worth paying for. The green curry is top notch. Thai Green curry makes me go weak in the knees and Baan Thai ensures the perfect blend of the flavour and texture. 
If you like Thai food, visiting this place should be on your bucket list.

I've been there once to celebrate a special evening. Good variety of thai food and drinks.Thai green curry with rice is definitely recommended as it was very flavorful. We tried warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream for dessert.We were also given complementary chocolates after our dinner.
Certainly recommended to all Thai food lovers.
Life is a beautiful journey..Live it well..

Had a recent visit and was glad. This is a very nice restaurant in Oberoi Grand to have Thai food. This can be my favourite Thai food restaurant. Pricing is expensive(cause its Oberoi) but food quality is amazing.
 Hospitality is great and staffs are very attentive and amiable. I loved the Fish Green Curry and the Chicken Red curry. Ambience is simply awesome and a bar is also available...It is not at all pocket friendly.. :p .... But i would suggest you to visit there with heavy pockets..
:)
I would rate 4.0 for BAAN THAI..

I have always come away feeling I have just paid a visit to foodie heaven after eating at Baan Thai ! Their GreenThai Curry and Steamed rice take your taste buds to another level entirely .... and are a must have for me .... their Paad Thai is excellent as well .... like I said you cant go wrong here as pretty much all the food is wonderful !
