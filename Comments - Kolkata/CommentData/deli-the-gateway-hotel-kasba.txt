Had black forest cake and fresh cream pineapple cake. Both the cakes were simply awesome. Pineapple cake had minced pineapples as well and was so yummy and same goes with black forest cake. Both the cakes were so soft and creamy that we couldn't say which one is better. Very good service from the staff. Definitely going again that even soon.

I was back to city after 2 years during durga puja festival and completely unaware of this Taj group of Hotel. Ended up here Navami night after pandal hopping for puja special buffet dinner. Ambience is beautiful, classy elegent, staffs are cartetious. One bavarage alcoholic/ non alcoholic was included in 2000 rs per person buffet dinner. Well by the standard of food I will say its  over priced. May be it was puja and dinner time thats why. The food mainly focused on Bengali speciality. Mutton duck bungllow, biriyani, mocha chingri, bele machher sukto was pretty decent. Ilish was disaster. The best thing was probably the desert section, I think so far the best desert I had in any buffet place. They served wide variety from sandesh, langchya to tiramishu and all are equally delicious. So over all good experience.

Located inside Taj Gateway Hotel at Rajdanga Main Road opposite to Ruby Hospital. Went their to celebrate a close friends birthday. I guess it was Pineapple Flavoured cake with good amount of Soothing cream with Pineapple laid down between the cake. Every bite was giving a feel of eating a raw pineapple. Fresh and soft that is what you can expect here.

I seriously have no clue why the ratings are so low. I absolutely LOVE their cakes. And I have tried quite a few to be honest. All of them taste way too good considering the prices. I dont exactly remember the names. However please do check it out.

I ordered a 1 lb Black Forest cake for my wife's birthday. Mr Subrata contacted me over the phone and he noted down all the details. The cake was was ready on time (4:30 pm). It looked good and the packaging was excellent. The cake was wonderful to taste and it was neither too creamy or too dry. It was perfect. I would love back to come back here again and have some more cakes and pastries. Special thanks to Tapas and Purnima for helping me out at the time of cake delivery.

Recently been to this so called spectacular gateway hotel located in ruby and onto its cafe section with my better half..and had an unique experience..first coming to the ambience..it was quite well with its long hall like appearance with an unique charm..secondly coming to its service it was spot on and was quite good as it was expected in a 5 star hotel cafe..and mainly coming to the food part..we took a cheesecake pastry which was quite good..and a red velvet cake which was unique and good too..both were cool in terms of quantity and quality..but the harrowing experience I had when we ordered the normal cappuccinos..it was awful and didn't deserved it's so called price tag..in terms of quality which is not at all expected from a 5 star cafe like this..otherwise overall we had a good time if not great..the cafe is highly recommended if u choose the beverages carefully as the food is good there as it is expected.

Went there a couple of days ago for the delicious bengali new year brunch. They buffet was supposed to end at 3.30 and they extended it for us till 4. It was really sweet of them. The jackfruit korma on the buffet was superb. But the other dishes were delicious too. Our picks were, the fries counter, mocha,  chingri pulao and lobongilotika. The caramel custard on the buffet was quite delicious. 

The Bel panna served with the brunch was very refreshing and the service staff was very warm and accommodating. 

Kudos!

Great location. Lovely ambiance. Amazing staffs and brilliant desserts. We had ordered blueberry cheese cake, donut, red velvet cake, white forest pastry and blueberry muffin. Among all of these blueberry cheese cake was the best according to me.

Located very conveniently at Ruby More, this 4* property is quite under rated. We visited Deli, the bakery unit of the hotel. The decor was classy. It was calm and quite inside making the place perfect for having a good conversation and spending quality time with friends or family.

We ordered Earl Grey, Darjeeling tea, Choco chip muffin, Blueberry Cheese Mousse.
1st of all, they make excellent tea. Because of the chilled temperature inside, we were literally shivering and the tea came as the perfect comfort drink. Loved the aroma and taste. The quantity will serve 3 easily.

The muffin was really good too. Soft, spongy and tasted perfect.
The Blueberry Cheese Mousse was something that I had never tried before. Liked this one too.

Price is absolutely reasonable. Service could have been better.

A small bakery shop of the Gateway hotel. The food is really good. It's more like a take away, but if you wish to dine in, you can be comfortably seated in their Buzz restaurant.
The pastries are too good, and the efficiency of services and the ambience needs no mention.
Also this outlet is very reasonably  priced.

Well, for those of you who don’t know this – The Gateway Hotel, Kasba is a part of the Tata group, who also own Taj Bengal @ Alipore – although, the former lacks a similar charm! 

I visited this place along with a friend and we headed straight to this bakery – they seat their “Deli” customers inside their “Buzz” restaurant and we were comfortably seated in a nice and spacious 2-seater table. Since 2 LCD’s were placed parallel, both of us could watch TV as well as talk to each other face to face at the same time. Ambience is excellent, hygiene and cleanliness picture-perfect – as is the natural expectation from a 5-star.

Coming to food, hardly any veg savouries were available and no eggless pastries were on offer – as is the general practice in 5-star bakeries. We started off with a vegetable puff, which was medium sized with pretty mediocre stuffing as well as taste. Complimentary Cremica ketchup was served on request. We also ordered a couple of teas which were pretty decently served in a stylish silver tea-pot. Obviously, we can’t expect hand-made ginger + elaichi waali chai at a luxury dining – and those teas were prepared using milk powder. Nevertheless, tea was fine and refreshing. Lastly, we ordered their chocolate pastry – we were glad to see that sugar content was quite low and cream content pretty high. Pastry was however, tasty and presentation very nice. For takeaways, I ordered a chocolate pyramid – they call it the mountain – which was very beautifully packed. However, it lacked the softness (as well as the taste) expected out of a pyramid – a major turn off for me, although, the pastry was damn huge!

Service is very nice and staff very polite. That lady at the entrance door (don’t know her name) deserves a special mention for her courteousy. Nice to see that prices are not high – quite reasonable – considering this 5-star property.

To sum up, my expectations were definitely higher than what I received, but nevertheless, my evening was well spent!

On an eventful trip to the Passport office got us hungry! We reached at a time not for lunch nor for tid bits. Decided to have lighter snacks! Ambiance is great!

Hi foodies!

So I went to the Gateway Hotel yesterday as part of a volunteering group for the British Council. Each of us were given a packet from Deli. It reminded me of the takeaway packets they have at the Lalit Great Eastern.

It included a paneer roll, a chicken-cheese sandwich and chocolate brownie. All items were plastic wrapped and colour coded for veg or non veg. Also, each item had been assigned a time after a period of which they would spoil. I really liked this attention to detail!

Unfortunately, only the Chicken-Cheese Sandwich seemed to have been prepared in a four star hotel. The roll was cold and the paratha very hard to chew, and the brownie.. Well, I've had better!

-Bon Appétit :)

One of those late night cafes cum restaurants you can visit with your family and friends. We went late so opted for the cafe. Ordered the chocolate cake, mango cake and white forest cake. They were fresh and really really tasty.
