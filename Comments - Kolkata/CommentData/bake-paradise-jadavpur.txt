Good place to have snacks if you're in the area. Have visited this place a number of times. I love their egg patties. Pastries are decent..nothing special.

Located near 8B Bus Stand in the mio amore shop Lane itself. 1 shop ahead of mio amore. Different snack items are available. Small shop with no seating arrangements. Hardly 4-5 people can accomodate inside all togetherness. Pastries are just OK to taste. Few snack items are good to taste as well and few are just average. Nothing extra ordinary. Prompt service and sober Staffs. Economical.

Bake Club, Jadavpur, one of the options for quick bites in the locality. Tried their 'Chicken Internet' and one of the chocolate pastries.

Food was okay, but wasn't that delicious. The chicken Internet was bit dry. Pastry was good. Nothing very special, but you can try it, when you are hungry.

Buying a cake for a significant other proved to be the worst decision of my life especially on Rose Day. Imagine my embarassment when she said, "Cake ta toke geche". Yes, the cake was stale!!!!!! It was as dry as The Thar and as 'tok' as curd. Thanks Bake Paradise for not having a quality control measure and ruining my day. Dammit.

যাদবপুরের ৮বি বাস স্ট্যান্ডের এরিয়ায় অবস্থিত । সস্তায় পেট ভর্তি করে টিফিন খেতে চাইলে এখানে আসতে হয় । চিকেন স্প্রিং রোল খেয়েছিলাম । পরিবেশন দ্রুত ।

Visited this place quite a no. of times. The pastries are nothing special. Other snacks are so-so. You can get much much better in Mio Amore and it will cost maybe ₹5 extra.

Pocket Friendly.
No cold drinks available.

One of the many shops of such calibre in the region, but significantly different from others in terms of items offered. We tried the chicken kulcha, chicken dinner roll and the chicken kebab roll. Chicken dinner roll tasted very good...kind of like an Indian spicy dish. The chicken kulcha was really filling and also good. The kebab roll was also good but the chicken was too dry. Overall a decent change from the regular shops of similar kind.
