Needless to say, this place is the last vestige of good non-vegetarian food outlet in Salkia, Howrah. Hence, it is the first preference and only hope for all non-veg lovers here.

And since all the others have already spoken in length about it's strengths, I am going to indulge in it's weaknesses for once.

First, let's talk about the delivery process. After desperately searching for any non-veg place to order from (you know, those cravings that you have sometimes), I was hell bent on ordering from Sip 'N Bites, when I saw that they delivered to my location too. I quickly called their number and from the other end, a young voice replied with a disgruntled "Hello, Sip'N Bite". I then ordered the food, though the voice on the other end seemed not too pleased. After that, I waited for nearly an hour for the food to arrive, calling them five times in between. Now, I wouldn't have done so if they had clearly told me that it would take an hour at least ( they assured me a number of times that the food would be delivered in thirty minutes).

Anyways, the food : The food was good. If you compare it with any other non-veg restaurants in Howrah, it was really, really good. But I personally think that the quality could've been a lot better.

Like the Chicken Hakka Chow that we ordered , it was a bit greasy.
The Chicken Sweet And Sour was nothing like it is supposed to be. It was bland, not at all sweet (or sour) and the pieces...Oh my god the pieces! They were small, chewy and without any coating or marination ( like it usually is).
The Chilli Chicken Dry wasn't that bad but not impressive either. It was really spicy and it took me quite some time separating those big, chopped pieces of green chilli.
The Egg Chicken Fried Rice was good though. It was made with minimal oil and yet, the taste was just as you would expect Chinese style "Fried rice" to taste like. Although, the quality of rice could've been better.

A special mention should be made about the roll...yes! Chicken Roll- The King of all Rolls!
And All Hail Sip 'N Bite for mastering this "master dish" and one of my all-time favourites.
It was done to perfection. Small, succulent tandoori chicken pieces, diced capsicum and onions, with the onions having been doused in a vinegar mixture, lending to it's sweet, tangy taste all wrapped up in soft, crispy paratha. Sip 'N Bite hit it out of the ballpark with this one and ultimately won my heart (and rating) ;)

Overall, Sip 'N Bite is still my only option for non-vegetarian food in Salkia (for a pocket friendly price), but I would like it if they improved in terms of quality and staff behavior a bit (for their own benefit).

On an ending note, Sip 'N Bite is the oasis in the desert called Salkia, the Mecca of all chicken roll lovers in Howrah and the knight in shining armour for hungry carnivores like me who have cravings at the weirdest of times :p

Hope to review again soon :)

It's nothing but a small Food-joint, not a restaurant...
not a place for hanging out, only a few chairs a available..

foods are good in comparison to Roadside Food-joints.. but nothing special..

and for information I'd like to mention..Â 
they function on Token system.. that mean you need to pay first to get your items..

Its located on dobson road. Easy to locate.
Not a place for strict vegetarians, because most of what they serve is non vegetarian. However, the rolls here are pretty good. As far as hygiene is concerned, they need some serious hard work on that front, very untidy and poorly managed. Just go there for the veg variety of rolls and nothing else!

The quantity offered is good and the quality is average... We had just tasted Chicken Biryani from this place and it was good... Well, thanks to this outlet because this is probably the only outlet who sells non-vegetarian food in Dobson Road... :)
