Located in Hindustan park , Wise owl has charm of its own ,be it it's coffee or its ambience. We preferred the indoor seating area ,thanks to the cold weather outside. Ordered egg burger, chicken burger and cold coffee . the waiter was courteous enough and didn't take long to serve the food. Chicken burger was nice , served with French fries and egg burger was good too. The coffee shop has a Lovely and cozy ambience . definitely visiting this place again.

Food is good.  Nothing great,  but good. The meat lovers Club is the best in the good. 
 Ambience is perfect for a breakfast.  One negative is they take  a lot of time to get your food. For me they took around 45 minutes,  even though the place was not very crowded.  Understaffed

Went for a morning breakfast and i am sorry to say that it's a overhyped cafe in terms of quality and presentation of food ..we ordered chicken cheese omlettte, chilli cheese toast and cappacchinos and must say that it did not really tickle the taste buds ..having said that I must confess that the ambience both inside n outdoor was quite ok ..overall..it's a ok type joint but nothing extraordinary..

The Owl-istic place in town to sip over a hot chocolate or a hot coffee with french fries with a nice story book or have a chit-chat with your friends. 
Quiet a nice and pocket friendly place for a lovely date with some juicy pork tenderloin steak. 
We ordered 3 hot chocolate and a basket of French fries on our visit to this place. 
Going again to have the steaks at the rooftop for sure ! 
Much recommended. 
One should obviously taste their Hot Chocolate.

Tasty food, nice ambience and owls in myriad size and shapes summarize my experience at Wise Owl I went there last evening for coffee and steak. We ordered a cup of Darjeeling Tea, Coffee Mocha Cold, Grilled Chicken in Pepper sauce and Caramel Custard.
You will love the food, the proportions are just right and the price is reasonable. There is also breakfast menu. The ambience makes this place perfect for foodies different age brackets.
The service is good and leaves no space for complain. I am looking forward to explore the breakfast menu.

Pathetic service... they have always been slow but today's experience was the worst. We had to ask them thrice to take our order. The folks kept nodding but refused to take the order. We were about to walk out when they finally took it. It was not as if they had a full house by the way. So if one is ready to wait it out and ignore their ignorance, go ahead.

This is my favourite place for coffee. It is the perfect place to sit down, relax, may be read a book or have a really long chat with your friend. There are two sections. An indoor AC section and an outdoor section which is open air and where one can smoke.
Coming to the food, they make awesome sandwiches. The coffee, cold coffee, iced tea are equally good. The service is a little slow but I don't mind that cause I always keep a lot of time on hand when I come here.

Wise owl has been on the cafe map for a while now, so obviously it needs no introduction. 

Speaking of the food, we ordered a meat lovers burger and a spaghetti in red sauce. The chicken wasn’t the usual hard freezer stored patty, which was a great relief but an in-house preparation. When burger comes with bacon, usually its fried bacon strips. This however wasn’t the same. But nonetheless it tasted good and for that price, I’ll take it twice over. The burger comes with a side of fries that makes for a good meal in itself. 

My friend had a couple of specifications regarding her pasta and our server not only gave her good suggestions but also modified the dish to her desire. Coming to the cold coffee, this place needs to improve on something as basic as that. With nicer cafes coming up in the locality they need to work on their food presentation and taste to an extent. 

However, this oldie needs some serious improvement when it comes to their service. They have no clue which guest arrives before which and there is a complete lack of management. Also, the servers seemed less in number as compared to the crowd this place gets even on a regular weekday evening. Thereby, hampering service and making patrons anxious in the process. Overall, it’s a good place to sit and socialise with friends.

Ordered Penne Pasta which was served at around 30 minutes from the time of giving the order. The food tasted delicious. The service can be more prompt. We had to call the waiters repeatedly for everything- asking the table to be cleaned before sitting down, asking for orders to be taken, asking for the bill (had to ask twice, thought they might not have any intention of charging us after all).

Going by Zomato reviews, this was another place I chose to visit - and this time I was not disappointed (well not entirely).

I took a table for two in the open. And while I was waiting for my friend to join me, I ordered for a Jasmine Tea and Panko Chicken. The panko chicken is just like a KFC fried chicken, but boneless and comes with a decent flavored dip. The disappointment however was that t took them almost 40 mins to serve this! 

I did point this out to the attendant, in the most polite way possible, and post that, the service made a dramatically positive turn.

We followed on the order with, Grilled chicken in mushroom sauce, Meatlovers pizza and Chicken fingers wrapped in bacon.

The mushroom sauce used for grilled chicken was creamy, but a bit bland. You may ask the attendant to spice it with pepper if you prefer a more spicy sauce (I would have had I known this before). It is served with vegetables and mashed potatoes (which were a thumbs up). The portion size is moderate, so you may want to have a starter if you are on the hungrier side.

The Meatlovers pizza was a delight! Again, a small portion (4 slices) but cheesy, well baked and filled with toppings.

But it was the Chicken fingers wrapped in bacon that made our day! Really juicy, well cooked and perfectly accompanied with dip. On the flip side, the chicken fingers were again bland - but that may be because they wanted to highlight the flavors of the bacon wrap.

We also had an Americano and 2-3 other forms of tea with all of this! (Yes, we are big eaters)

Ambience: 4 on 5
Food: 4 on 5
Service: 3.5 on 5
Cost: Roughly 1400-1500 for all of this

Have visited wise owl many times, mostly for breakfast. 
Firstly for breakfast, my personal favourites are the meat lovers club and chocolate pancake. If you want to have a traditional English breakfast, I would recommend this place as well. They serve an all-day breakfast platter. Among beverages my favourite is the hot chocolate, since I prefer chocolate over coffee. The coffee of this café is also very good.
In the evening we ordered chicken tetrazzini, it was cheesy and yummy. The chicken sandwich was very bad. Chicken finger wrapped in bacon was good. For dessert we had the chocolate avalanche which lived up to its expectations.
Overall very good experience everytime. :)

The only drawback of the place is their service. My friends and I have been to this place many a times and the only complain we have is their delayed service. Like we literally have to wait for 15-20mins for a glass of water while my friend was choking.  Other than that food served is good and so it the amount charged.

Wise Owl is located opposite to Vicky Gardens at Southern Avenue. It serves an ensemble of dishes, exclusive of alcohol though. I have tried their chicken  wonderland, which is cubes of chicken cooked with noodles and Caesar Salad and also their Red Velvet Cupcake. The tastes have been mediocre. They also have an outside seating arrangement. I recommend their steakhouse section to the restaurant. Also several of their items are unavailable a lot of times.

Wise owl is a themed cafe and it has a cozy vibe. I've tried their "Mushroom Maggi" and "Smoked Ham , Bacon and Cheese Pizza" . I would literally just keep coming back for their mushroom maggi. Now both the dishes were quite tasty but I feel that the pricing is unfairly high in comparison to the quantity they serve. Any standard cafe serves a quantity which is sufficiently filling but their finger food items aren't sufficient quantity wise . Hence I'm reducing my rating by quite a bit , just because of the pricing and quantity . I haven't even tried their continental dishes  because I feel its over priced. Hoping they increase the quantity of their food items by quite a bit or slash prices to have frequent return customers. However the food they serve is of top notch quality.

A coffee shop, perfect for an evening session of adda with friends. That's when we went and found it to be quite full of mostly young folks.( But whatever age is just a number....right!!). The decor is lovely....it lives up to its name by having pics of owls and also different owl statuesall around. Service is quite laid back, they let you sit and spend time with your friends without seeming to hurry you up. The food is good. We had snacks and shakes and all were good. The corn cheese balls were fried to a golden colour and the nachos served with salsa and sour cream was also enjoyable.Price wise, too it was ok.

A good start of a day has always meant (according to me) starting it with good food. And yesterday was no exception. I was planning for quite some time to visit this well-known place for it's even better known breakfast platters. So there I was eager to experience the delicacies for myself. Going by the saying that eat in the morning like a king, my friend and I had ordered their famous breakfast platter which consists of two toasts, French fries, fried eggs and chicken sausages. We had also ordered pancakes with Maple syrup and dry fruits, brown breads, frittata with potatoes, chicken and onion and Oreo shake. The frittata was delicious. The pancakes and the shake were good but not great. The breakfast platter was what it was exactly supposed to be - filling. Well a review on wise owl is incomplete without a mention about it's decor which in one word is marvellous! I would recommend everyone to visit this place at least once to have a great start to a day!

Visited the place today morning for our Sunday breakfast. While the food, coffee and protein shake were made to our satisfaction, the service standard was disappointing. Ordered a breakfast platter and a non-veg combo when we were told muffin wasn't available in the combo today, which was fine with us. But the unavailable item should ideally be replaced by something similar because the combo price is fixed and isn't adjusted against the items not available. When I asked the person serving us whether the muffin would be replaced with something else, he said he will let me know in a moment. But neither he came back nor were the muffin got substituted by something else. The place also seemed short of staff in the morning or may be, they were just unwilling to serve the customers. We waited for more than half an hour before being served, and thereafter we have to keep calling them whenever we need anything. I guess the basic requirement in hospitality industry is to enquire if your guests need anything or any other assistance. If not, have self-service option which, I think, would be fine too. But no one would want poor/ disappointing service in the name of service. Also, when we asked for the bill, the staff "almost threw" it on our table. This isn't my first time to Wise Owl, and though I would rate 9.5 out of 10 for food and ambience, it is 1 for service. People love Wise Owl for its food and ambience, please don't spoil it with bad service. I was so disappointed that I chose not to tip this time.

Food - The food here in this coffee shop is delicious. We ordered for baked fish, lemongrass chicken and chocolate avalanche. The baked fish was too tasty nut too much cheesy. The lemongrass was perfect with it’s balance of butter and tangyness.

Ambience - Small place for about 20 people.

Extremely understaffed. There was a single member of staff manning the phone, the cash register, making coffee, serving seated customers, packing takeaway meals and coordinating with Swiggy delivery guys. Even though my food was ready when I arrived to collect it, it took an additional 15 mins for it to be packed and billed. The whole point of ordering over the phone in advance is that the food is ready to go when the customer arrives to collect it. At the very least, you should warn customers of the waiting time for takeaways when they call.

This is one of the place where you will see mostly a group of people gossiping and munching. It is truly an Adda zone type place and I really loved it. Perfect place to hangout with friends. Now the food, it's quality and taste both are nice, especially their breakfast platter is too good.

A classy cafe loacted @hindusthan park. Its name describes its interior fully.. "penchus" are all around while you sips your coffee. We have ordered grilled fish with lemon sauce nd grk salad. Both are delicious.

Okay if you’re sitting outside in winters and having an adda session. Food is quite on the okay side and they have a lot of options. However, do not expect it to be great.

Wise owl..is really one of my favourites..  they have a outdoor seating..which I feel is..pretty good and cozy..  indoor seating area is good but i think space is  little  less..so most of the time you have to wait outside before you can finally get a seat... I have tried their burgers..which are really tasty..  I love their burgers.. other than that their coffee  is good.. I have also tried their pizza..which is kind of ok... And something which you should not order is peach tea.. becausei it was damn bad....  But other than that..  the place is clean..pretty..food is good. You might like it :)

Visited this place for breakfast. It was a disappointment. The veg menu was limited. The waiters weren't taking our order and when they finally took. It took a lot of time to come. We are what we got but we had ordered for garlic bread which apparently the waiter forgot about. We waited for 30 mins and then went up to the billing counter and got our order cancelled. Then he checked his slip and casually said alright. We deserved an apology for his behaviour and how can one forget the order.

A cosy eating place located in a quiet locality. It has facility for outdoor seating as well. The interior is nice with the decor pieces related to owls. The food is enjoyable. The BBQ Chicken pizza is nice and so is the Chicken Picatta with Harissa Sauce. The Chicken Arrosto is delicious. However, the Corn Dog wasn't enjoyable...it was soggy and bland.

I have visited the place a lot in the past month and while some stuffs are really good, the service is dismal. It's like they want the customer to leave asap. I enquired if we could wait for the table but the person in question was desperate for me to leave asap. Moreover, waiting for food for almost 30 minutes is not acceptable. Dismal service.

Opposite to basanti Devi college you will find kimbadanti , walk straight leaving azad hind dhaba on the right you will find this coffee shop. The decor is soothing adding a homely touch to it. So we ordered espresso , mango shake and caramel pudding. 
ESPRESSO - The coffee was rich in taste and strong. Perfectly done. 
MANGO SHAKE - With thick creamy layer this was really tasty and refreshing. 
CARAMEL PUDDING - Overloaded with caramel syrup , this was very soft and instantly melted inside the mouth. Loved it. 

The place won't burn a huge hole in your pocket. The service is pretty laid back but that you can expect from a coffee shop.

This cafe was recommended by a friend for its good food and beyond that it is not much the decor is simple and soothing. The place is decently spacious and cozy. 
The food was ok but the service is pathetic. One must have too much time on hand to endure their service. There was also other customers complaining the same as we were waiting a good 45/50mins. Even after that they messed up our order. 
Go there with your own time and relish the food which was definitely good but on the expensive side.

Tucked in a cosy by lane in Hindustan park, this place is a gem. We had to wait for sometime to get a table, and the owner was polite enough to invite us in and sit till a table became vacant.
The interiors are simple yet beautiful,and ambience is great. We ordered Caramel Custard (tasted outta the world), iced latte,Oreo shake and Hazelnut latte. 
Definitely going back for more!

Perfect combination of ambience, good food and impressive service. Visited on panchami and thankfully didn't have to wait for more than 20 minutes.
Chicken steak in mushroom sauce was something which impressed me especially the texture of the meat. Soft and smooth it simply melts in one's mouth with the creamy mushroom sauce making it the perfect combination.
Chicken Alexander made me fall in love with it's chicken and sausage grilled in cream sauce served with bell pepper rice. The jewel of this dish was clearly the rice. With the right amount of butter and tinge of pepper it goes perfectly with the creamy chicken. Salted vegetables adds to the charm of the dish.
Will look forward to visiting this beautiful place again.

Guys coming to the food part later... but please correct your restaurant opening time... this website shows it opens at 7:30 in the morning but it doesn't... today morning only after checking the timings I went there around 8:10 a.m. only to be informed by the security that it wil start it's operations from 9:00 a.m.

As of the food part I have always been there for breakfast and the options are good. The all day breakfast platter is quite filling. Sandwich options are also aplenty. Their mushroom maggi tastes pretty yummy and so does the sausages. The service is tad slow but bearable. Ambience is good. They also have a outddor seating arrangement which is also good unless it's too humid.

Very disappointing .. I ordered two club sandwiches.. and they were so dry.. no mayonaisse.. a little cheese on the edges to give the impression that the entire layer is covered in cheese.. but on opening it up I can see an empty space in between.. cost cutting has ruined the quality of the food.. it was supposed to be a meat lovers club sandwich and just had a slice of ham.. that was it.. It was a very disappointing thing..especially when I am being charged so much.. I though sandwiches are something that an eatery cannot go wrong with .. apparently I was wrong..

Never have I ever given a negative review about any place but Wise owl has itself induced me to write a negative review about them.
LOCATION- This place is located just beside Feast Street at the Hindustan park and provides outdoors as well as indoors seating arrangement.

STAFF- Extremely ignorant. I had to wait for a maximum of half hour for the waiter to come and take my order. Extremely lousy service. I have never had such an experience.

FOOD- As we had lack of time we only ordered​ beverages. We had a Cappuccino and a Cold Coffee.
It was okayish. Nothing special and extraordinary.
Nevertheless despite of the lousy service this place ain't that much bad.

This cafe was looking so lively from outside so we went there.We sat inside as there were some group of people beside us was making too much noise.And secondly we were calling the waiter for so long but he wasn't responding. At lat when he came we ordered our food. And they took more than 30min to serve us, as we ordered a Baked fish. 
Then comes to food, the food quality wasn't at all good. It was tasteless. So we left it
The overall experience was disgusting.

I would say I am thoroughly disappointed by the service and quality which I feel has detoriated over the years. It used to be one of the most visited cafes in the city. The portions served are very less and service is poor. Waiting time to be served is longer even when the turnout is low. Expecting improvement.

We've just visited here once and we ordered a Chocolate Sundae. I am not a huge chocolate lover but it was a delightful sundae with all the crunchy nuts n fudge sauce. We also had a cold coffee with ice cream it was good.
The indoor ambience is the usual cafe type, what is really attractive is the outdoor seating they have. It must be a good experience to sit there during the evening.
The place isn't very pocket friendly though. Service is okay.

I've visited this place twice. Located on Purna Das Road, it is a small cafe with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements.
We ordered-
1.Cold Coffee
2.Hot Chocolate
Both were quite good
3. Chicken Alexander- a really delicious dish. A must have, specially for those who are cheese lovers.
4. Chicken Wonderland- Spaghetti with a spicy twist.

The service was however quite slow and not up to the mark.

All in all a nice place for hangout.

Recently went there for breakfasting. A simple cafe, nothing much interesting about the ambience.
Order- We ordered the all day breakfast platter, a chicken mayo sandwich, one cafe latte and one hot chocolate. The service was reasonably quick.
Food- the all day breakfast platter had a toasted bread piece, some pieces of chicken sausages, one poached egg, bacon (3-4 strips) , some French fries and was served with butter and ketchup. Everything in the plate looked fresh and tasted good! Nothing extraordinary but not bad either. The chicken mayo sandwich came with some potato chips and was quite filling. Cafe latte was amazing and so was the hot chocolate (a bit on the sweeter side)
Bill- around Rs 700 INR including taxes.
Overall- good place specially for breakfast as they open at 7:30 am. Recommended!

Dropped by this place on a humid, sticky  evening
so couldn't sit in the outside area, though it looks beautiful. The inside section is charmingly decorated with one entire wall devoted to the birds, after which  this cafe has been named.  After much debate, we settled on ordering spicy seafood pasta, Americano and wise owl special capuccino. The pasta was finger-lickingly good. But to me it's an unforgivable sin for any food establishment with the word 'cafe'  in it's name to trip up in the coffee department, and here  Wise Owl messed up big time. My Americano was sort of passable but the 'special' capuccino was a huge let down, consisting of 90% foam. It might have been 'special' but in no way was it capuccino. Service is a little slow.

Though service is little slow.
But the taste makes it up.
Been there numerous no of times.

They make really good coffee, tea and and shakes.
Try their sandwiches like Meat lovers club and Tuna Sandwich. It's good.
Ceaser salad is my favourite dish.
There ham and bacon is good, so is there steak.

This place lives upto the mark.

Located just opposite to Azad Hind Dhaba in Gariahat, I went there for the first time with one of my close buddy and ordered one nachos with cheesy dip and salsa as starter, chicken stroganoff and penne alfredo with chicken as main course. Needless to say the experience was quite satisfactory, even though the nachos were less crispy than I expected them to be. The chicken stroganoff was tasty and very light. And the penne alfredo was just to my satisfaction and it was well balanced. The interior is very inviting and pleasing, and so is the friendly service of the staff.
One drawback? Very limited staff. They fail to arrange for filling water in our empty glasses and we have to call them several times to fill up the glasses with water, which is quite unprofessional on their part. Overall, a very good experience. Going to drop by this place again! @abarnamukherjee

My friends and I always come down to this place to chill. It has been our favourite spot for both breakfasts and evening snacks. We simply love the breakfast menu. Lasagna and the Fish and chips are my personal favourite. The service is a bit slow here. Will keep visiting this place. :D

The actual plan was to visit the wise owl steakhouse but I somewhat reached early than my friend for our lunch plan and decided to give the cafe a visit. 
A charming and cute cafe with the walls having numerous painting of owls. Justifies the name! 
😋  
It was raining outside and the weather was perfect for a tall mug of Hot Chocolate. So without wasting any time I ordered for it without even looking at the menu card. 
The Hot Chocolate came within no time and boy it was so good! Warm, thick and chocolaty. Better than all other places I had hot chocolate from. The consistency and the taste was so perfect that I thought of ordering another mug but restrained myself from doing so for pre-planned lunch. 
I think the place is best for having long sessions of adda over a cup of tea coffee and some finger foods to. It has an amazing breakfast menu too which I am going to try out soon. It was surprisingly unplanned but pleasant visit which left me craving for more of their food and beverages. Will definitely visit again❤️

My friends and I always come down to this place during evenings and hang out. Service is a bit slow, but they don't chuck you out even if you stay there for hours. Favourite is definitely the bbq chicken wings and spicy chicken wings. Tea is served in a no-frill white cup and looks pretty artistic in pictures. This place has an old world charm to it.

Another disappointment in spite of amazing online reviews. Quantities of the starters were abysmal. Chicken panko, brushetta and lasagna tasted nice. Hot coffees were ok but the Blue Lagoon mocktails gave some of us terrible stomach issues and the strong artificial blue colour refused to leave their bodies even after 48 hours! Gross!! Hygiene is not their forte. Outdoor seating is in demand, and they generally make you wait for some time as the joint is pretty small.
DO NOT CONFUSE WITH THE WISE OWL STEAKHOUSE. THEY HAVE SEPARATE OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT - according to the staff there.

Had heard a lot about this place, twice had to wait outside in queue to get a table, since it is usually pretty crowded most of the time. But was not so impressed, expected better, given the popularity and full-house look every time i pass by Purna Das road. The coffee was most ordinary, with too much milk. Unfortunately CCD coffees taste better. We ordered sandwich and corn balls, both were so-so, nothing out of the world. Perhaps its a nice place to hangout alone or with friends. I could spot many sitting solitary and enjoying a cup of coffee while lost in their "laptop" world. The seating arrangement was also clumsy and crowded with very little floor space. The non-ac area outside is better though. But the food should have been more impressive, since I did not want to dismiss it as another coffee shop on the street. Given a choice, you should try out Mrs Magpie at Southern Avenue instead.

We had previously been to their steak house and this was our first visit to the coffee shop below.
We went on a rainy afternoon and the outdoor sitting arrangement is just perfect for enjoying the weather.
We had a pasta,chicken steak,green apple mojito and walnut date cake

•Penne Alfredo-We had added sausages to it.It is cooked in extremely tasty cheesy sauce served with garlic bread.Quantity is sufficient for two with generous amount of sausages and mushroom.Recommended

•Chicken Caciatora steak-We wanted to try some wholesome food and the steaks are just perfect.Good amount of butter rice served with sliced chicken in medium spicy red sauce is absolutely delicious.Quantity suffices two easily.

•Green apple mojito-The green apple mojito is extremely refreshing served with chopped fruit and mint leaves is recommended.

•Walnut Date Cake-Served hot,soft and fluffy,a big piece is almost 90 bucks.It tastes average.

Service is prompt.
But they have less staffs so hardly they notice the empty glasses on table and fill them with water.
We had to call them for several times before they arrived with a jug of water to fill our glasses.That was disgusting.
Otherwise,food is amazing.
There are breakfast platters and good variety of steaks.
Prices are not very reasonable but quality is worth it.
We will visit this place again. :)

This quaint,little cafe near Triangular Park had been on my wishlist for a long,long time. And,I wasn't disappointed. We tried their Barbeque Chicken wings and Sunday Chocolate crunch. The wings were really finger-licking good, and the dessert was so yummy that we were considering one more bowl of it. The seating capacity is really limited,though.

With a pleasing ambience and good service, this place is a must try for all the foodies out there. 
The wise choice are seriously wise choices here and I'd personally recommend everyone to try the Chicken Tettrazini here. It's like a fusion of molten cheese and chicken in your mouth... something which you'll experience only if you try it.

When you enter this small cafe you are sure to fall in love with the ambiance. It's looks like one of those French road side cafes. It serves starting from breakfast to all day menu and it has both open air and inside seating arrangement.
 
Location: Located in Hindustan Park purna das road it is a beautiful decorated place.  
 
Ambience: Wise Owl is a well furnished cafe. They have a decent seating capacity inside but you will feel the real fun if you seat outside. That is just awesome. And for me it is the highlight of this place. To maintain the theme and the namesake of the cafe, it is decorated with wall painting of different types of owl on one side and the collection was really good of it and random wall paintings on the other side. 

Food & service: well food was good it wasn't too good neither bad. And prices are ok too. But they should improve their service. It's a bit slow. 

Overall it's a good cafe. Will revisit surely.

This was in my wishlist for a very long time and finally i gave a visit to this place. My soul friend and i went to have breakfast.

Location: take the lane opposite to basanti devi college and walk straight till you get to see azad hind dhaba. Take the right lane and within a few secongs you will find wise owl to your left hand side.

The place is beautifully decorated and at keeping it at par with its name you will come across many pictures of owl. The place has a modernistic touch yet keeping the aura of the place like the old american times. Seperated in two sections: one with ac accomodations which will soothe you during the summers and the other non-ac outside part which will give you a visual leisure.

Now coming to the food, BLT Sandwich and blue lagoon. While the sandwich was or less good though bit on a drier side, the blue lagoon was absolutely inedible. Too much of syrup made it difficult for us to consume and the lime slices gave no relief. After 2sips, we left it.

Hope that on my next visit they will serve better.

This is a cafe located in the interiors of Hindustan Park. It's a two floored cafe cum restaurant with the cafe in the ground floor. They have seating area outside as well. The ambience is that of a typical cafe and bakery. 
The menu has a wide variety of food and beverages and shakes. I ordered Oreo and Hazzlenut shake. The Oreo shake was presented in a small glass bottle with an oreo topping. This thick shake is very milky and creamy with Oreo crunches and taste good. The Hazzlenut shake has a perfect mixture of coffee, hazzlenut and milk cream- thick and filling. 
I ordered BBQ chicken wings from the appetizers. The chicken pieces were small but the sauce was cooked perfectly. The fried chicken wings were juicy and tasty. Among the main course, I ordered Breast Chicken Steak. This includes a thick and heavy chicken breast with an egg poach and veggies and mashed potato. One can be easily shared by two. The chicken breast is soft and juicy and the saucy layer is cooked very well. 
This place is a frequently visited by renowned personalities in the industry and has retained its name. The presentation of the dishes need a little improvement. The service is good. The food and beverages taste fine. The price is reasonable. A must visit.

I got the keenest pleasure after entering this cafe. Located near Hindusthan Park, away from the hustle and bustle this place serves food of generous portions and distinct flavours. We have ordered Pesto Sphaghetti, Grilled Chicken Sandwiches and Cappucino specially the Sphaghetti which was really well cooked and was sinfully delicious. 

The serving is decent and we came out with our tummies happy. 
Will definitely come back for the rest of the menu and awesome ambience! :)

I have lost count as to how many times I have visited this place, yet it still continues to be one of my favorite cafes in the town. Let's get straight to the point, shall we? 
1) Location - in the heart of Purna Das Road, this is a gem of a niche. So convenient and accessible. 
2) FOOD- well, isn't it D main criteria for any eatery? Drinks, food and beverages 4.5/5 out in this cafe. Try out their caramel cafe and oh-so-sumptuous fish and chips- my favorite and I bet it would become yours too! 
3) Ambiance- very collective. It offers an open air seating too, which for me is the highlight. I mean, Summer breeze or let's the the smell of petrichor and a cup of coffee to enjoy the view without being hindered by windows and doors, isn't that an ideal thought? 
4) service- they could definitely work on that. The service seems to be a little slow however is very warm and courteous. 
Over all an extremely satisfying experience, every time, till date.

Wise owl is basically a small guesthouse with a coffee shop downstairs and a restaurant upstairs. The ambience is cozy and the entire place smells of freshly brewed coffee. We ordered the barbeque chicken pizza which was okay , corn dogs which were not that good , chicken arrosto and the chicken piccata in harissa sauce. The arrosto was cooked in chicken broth reduction with rosemary and had a smoky flavour. It tasted amazing. The chicken piccata was even better , served with mashed potatoes and sautéed vegetables. The chicken was tender and the sauce was creamy with the harissa dominating. There was a hint of basil in it too. The mashed potatoes were creamy and well textured. The vegetables had a smoky taste and went well with the dish. 
The prices are reasonable here and the food is surprisingly very good. The staff is cooperative.

Terrible place. They have no idea what a steak is, and they lie about what they serve. I ordered a T-bone steak, and I got two separate tasteless meat patties on either side of a single straight line large bone (could be dog for all I know). I showed them pics of what a T-bone steak is, and did not pay for the joke they served me. Avoid this place like the plague.

I don't know why I gave a 3 rating to this cafe. I went with three of my friends.
I only liked the ambience of the cafe. Apart from that the food was not as good as we expected. It took forever for the food to arrive which was making us impatient. We ordered for :
● ham sandwich which was dry.
●meatlovers sandwich which was layered with chicken, ham and egg. This was good served with chips and sauce.
●chicken sausage pizza. This was an absolute disappointment as the cheese was not tasty and it was rather overpriced . The pizza served was rather very small.
● mango milkshake which created a good impression. The consistency was thick and it was sweet.
● Barbecue chicken which was spicy and tasty.
Totally a one time visit. The bill was anywhere around 1200 rupees. Food is not inclusive of tax.

This place has been great for breakfast. I've been here on two occasions. They've never let down my taste palates. Their breakfast combos are a hefty deal for anyone.
They serve perfect English breakfast. The menu card consists everything from Sandwiches to bacons to pancakes and beverages to mocktails and smoothies.
The best part I liked about them is that they've never said any ingredient is out of stock, unlike many places often do.
The ambience is very good too. Surrounded by all different styles off artwork done on the Owls 🦉.
Regarding hygiene, I can only say it's very impressive.
But everything can't be so perfect, right?
Yes. Here comes the anti-positive point. They never serve water, unless asked. It is a reactive service for them and not a pro-active one, unlike others.
So they need to rectify this. Maybe due to understaffed conditions, I presume.
But, I would always go there to have a perfect breakfast, any day.
If you're​reading this, then please do visit and satiate your desire of a perfect healthy breakfast.

Visited this place with a couple of my best pals on a lovely Saturday afternoon. Near hindustan park, The place has got both indoor and outdoor seating available, quirky and breezy feel to it. We had their American black coffee, and a couple of their sandwiches, including Ham sandwich, Veg club sandwich and Meat lover's sandwich. They come in four pieces a plate, pretty good value for money, decent taste. The service was a little slow though compared to the crowd present.

Good place to hangout with friends. You can spend some really good time. We ordered cappuccino, cold coffee and spicy mushroom. Mushroom was very good. The price is a little bit high here. Ambience was very good.

From extremely shabby interiors to outdated and unpalatable food. This place seriously needs a renovation in terms of its food, interiors, team ergonomics. The team also takes time to register a simple order and looks very mind boggled. 
The only positive about the place is the outdoor seating area.

Dis place has been on my wishlist for quite some time locating the place isn't much of an issue now coming to the real review the Ambience is extracted I really loved the outdoor seating area and it has about 10 to 12 tables so getting a seat might be an issue now coming to the menu speaking the truth the food is great but I did expect a lot more we had meat lovers pizza and chocolate milkshake and a cold coffee with ice cream and superstars I think they should try to make the Pizzas a bit better but never the less I shall keep dropping into this lovely place whenever I am around

A quiet little cafe on Purna Das road, this one is already a favourite with the South Calcutta crowd. I'll still add my two cents here- it is worth a visit, especially if you're looking for a cozy corner to meet up with your old friends or are simply a continental lover checking out the food scene here in Kolkata. The ambience is perfect in terms of a classical cafe.

The chicken lasagna is almost my staple here. My weakness for this dish means I am always on the lookout for places serving good lasagna and this place has not disappointed me so far. I've tasted the chicken steak, served with the perfect sunny-side-up and vegetables and mashed potatoes on the side. This dish is very good as well. 
The baked fish (picture attached) deserves special mention. If you love fish and cheese, this melt-in-your mouth dish would be a good recommendation. There are a large number of items in the menu still waiting to be tried, and I'll surely be back for more.

This is really a nice place to to meet up over a cup of coffee.
I went in here today.
Service is pretty bad. 
The time between placing the order and serving is insanely large.
We ordered 
1. Chicken Sausage Pizza- Not worth the prize. I did not like it at all.
2.Ham Sandwich - It was ok but very dry.
3.Meat Lover's Club Sandwich - It was fulfilling.
4.Chicken Wings in Barbeque Sauce - It was the only item I found tasty.
5.Mango Shake - It was nice and soothing. 

Taste- 2.5/5 
Ambience - 4/5 
Service- 1.5/5 Hole made in the pocket after dineout - BIG

A beautifully illuminated cafe in the by lanes of Hindustan Park. Went during the evening hours and it was full of people. The interior is comfortable. They have open air searing arrangements too. The menu is diverse with all kinds of coffee and tea. The portions of finger food is decent. The service is lousy though. Waiters are not attentive. Improvements needed!

Cheers!

I've been to this coffee shop a number of times and let me be clear, this one has got their basics right. The AC is chilled, coffee is hot and there's a not-so-small open air area outside where smoking is allowed. Now, the problem is I've not tasted many of their items but would like to highlight a dish called Avalanche. It's basically chocolate brownie with icecream and lots of chocolate - arranged layer-wise. At 180/-, it's definitely recommended and trust me, it's truly awesome. 

Recommended.

A nice place for a long chat session with friends. It has an outdoor seating area as well as indoor seating arrangements. Coming to food , we ordered a Mango Shake and a cold coffee with ice cream. Both of them were really good in both quality and quantity. 
The staffs are very courteous. My friend accidentally spilled over her shake after finishing half of it. So they gave us another glass of shake free of cost.
Will definitely visit again to try some of their main course items.

The place is a little difficult to find at least frm the Gariahat side, the ambience is good both indoor and outdoor accommodation is there. Although I didn't enjoy the food but thn again if the choice of the food is not good you can't enjoy it. So to those willing to go choose wisely. Frm my point of view not that much pocket frndly.

Delicious early morning outings?
Here is the place. One of the few good places to enjoy breakfast with your friends/colleagues/partner.

Having two sections, one with an outdoor arrangement, and minimal yet adequate decor, this place offers everything you'd want for your first daily meal : Oats, Cornflakes, Omlette, Maggi, Pancakes, Tea, Coffee and Shakes.
P.S. Pocket friendly and worth every penny.

Must visit!

Good ambience is only what you get here and nothing else! Very bad service. Instead of cold coffe, you get water mixed with nescafe, which doesn't even taste good. And perhaps, the staff is too busy to listen to your complaints. This is the first place where I got a hot ice tea and strawberry ice cream in a cold coffee. I have to say Wise Owl has gone down way too much!

Though this wasn't my visit to this place..May be Nth one, but I have to pen it down this time.
One amazing place this one is at the heart of gariahat. But thanks to it's location, it still manages to give u a cozy warm corner to enjoy your coffee and unwhirl yourself. Cappuccino,cold coffee,iced tea, pasta Alfredo, club sandwich,chicken Tetrazzini, baked fish,french fries have been my all time favorite here. Keep up the good food.
Just one thing that adds to the minus point is the service. Considering the quality of food and place , service needs a hell lot of improvement. Professionalism is missing.Customer dealing,they don't know.Improve there.
Rest all good!!!!

I always wanted to get inside Wise owl when i studied in a school nearby. Now today i got an oppotunaty to be here. I liked the atmosphere and the place is quite good. For breakfast and snacks, its really worth it. But the problem lies in the service. The service here really suckas. We ordered chicken maggi and coffee. It took almost more than 30 minutes to prepare those which i really never expected. They sometimes forget what order they took. And even the coffee was also not good. There are so many good coffee shops in the city and it stands nowhere before them. For the environment and the interior i will give a full 4.5. But for service and food i will give it a straight 1. This is because u are paying for wat you are eating. And the quality really sucks.

Location- Located in Purna Das Road,you will find Wise owl if you take Purna Das road from Golpark and walk/drive for 300-400m. If you come from rashbehari side take a right and hop into the street of the Raymond shop ,walk or drive for 400m and you will find 66/2b.
Ambiance- Wise owl is a well furnished cafe ,decorated with bamboo chairs and tables. They have a decent seating capacity inside but you will feel the real fun if you seat outside in the smoking zone in a winter evening. That is just awesome! I have sat both inside and outside and i will prefer the smoking zone anyway unless it's too humid outside!
Food ordered- I have ordered few of their starters and look forward to try more of this place later. Crispy chicken fingers wrapped in bacon is my favorite one from Wise owl. The chicken finger was also nice which was tossed with 2kinds of sauce.
Service- Well .. I would have given a 4 out of 5 to this place if their service would be in normal pace. Their service is pretty slow and you need to ask them many a times for your food which of course i did not like.

Food: very nice and fresh. Ordered-
1. BBQ ham steak burger: juicy ham and bacon, on a bed of lettuce and cheese, with French fries. Couldn't be better. Very very tasty.
2. Chicken Caesar salad:soft chicken tomato lettuce bread crumbs and eggs. Fresh and yummy. Loved it.
3.chicken cacitora: soft chicken with Bell paper mixed rice. It's so light and smooth and fresh you'll always want it more.
4.strawberry shake: smooth and tasty, no artificial smell.
5. Blue lagoon: properly prepared. Soothing.
Food is very very Good here.
Staff: well behaving helpful staff.
Cons: little bit expensive for a café. They take 21% tax over the total bill.
Else this café is definitely a go to.

We had pancakes and one of their breakfast platters... With their special coffee. I am very particular about my coffee and very few places actually make me happy, coffee-wise... This place is not my no 1 choice for coffee... Nevertheless, the coffee was reasonably OK. Overall a good place.

Visited with a friend two weeks back. Easy to locate if one walks along Purna das road. Had ordered a cappuccino and a cold coffee, I believe nothing could be more simpler than this order but the experience was very bad as not only one, both the drinks tasted impeccably worse than the other. I am literally sad to share such a review of a such renowned city cafe.

This quaint little place has a very energetic ambience being the hotspot for much of the youth in the city. However, the food is quite mediocre especially considering the prices charged.

Located on Purna Das Road this cafe definitely attracts the attention of the people passing by. Such is the subtle decoration and the welcoming ambiance that it is always bustling with crowd from all age group. It hosts an indoor seating area well lit and decorated with paintings and an outdoor smoking zone where one can spend hours reading or indulge in regular sessions of adda while puffing on a smoke. Coming to the food and service i believe the portion sizes are pretty small compared to the price they charge. Among the various things we ordered Mac n Cheese tasted the best. The coffee was pretty average and so was the meaty burger. Service is slow but given the great ambiance and the long chitchat its hard to complaint. Prices are above average. Overall a decent place.

Visited this place many times but couldn't take any photo as we usually sit outside which is quite dark and we were so busy to do gossips, just forgot to click some pics. But this time it was afternoon and we went inside. This cafe in Purna Das Road has indoor and outdoor sitting places. One can smoke outside. Now coming to the cafe it's extremely cute, nicely decorated. One can sit for hours and I am pretty sure nobody will ask you to leave. It's not a place for those who are in hurry as their service is extremely slow. I just love their ginger honey tea, it's a perfect beverage after a long tiring day. Chicken salad, sandwich, French fry, pizza- all are quite tasty. Their quality & quantity both are good. Prices are exclusive of taxes and could be little higher on some people's pocket. But that's OK as long as people can sit for long time reading a book or chatting with friends etc.

Wise owl is like my second home. This is one of the best cafés in Kolkata for hours of adda with your friends over the perfect cup of coffee. Located on Purna Das Road its easily accessible from gariahat and golpark. The café is divided into an outdoor seating section which is perfect for beautiful mornings and lazy breezy afternoons as well as an air-conditioned indoor seating section for those who prefer it cool. 
They have a good all-day breakfast menu including a breakfast platter and delicious sandwiches and also a great collection of coffees and teas, especially the wise owl special cappuccino. Apart from that my favourites are their chicken lasagna, grilled chicken, chicken stroganoff and spaghetti bolognese. 
The waiters are warm and friendly even though the service is a bit slow. But then if adda is on your mind then I don't think time is an issue.

I have heard a lot about this place from friends for being cool French style road side cafe in the by-lanes of Hindustan Park. So went there on a Sunday morning for breakfast.

It does actually looks like one of those French Road Side Cafes which serves starting from Break fast to all day menu and has both open air and inside seating arrangement.

Just to check out the interior decor I opted to seat inside the restaurant which quite empty except for a young lady having her breakfast. The open air section was already buzzing with almost everyone choosing to seat there...

To maintain the theme and namesake of the restaurant, it is decorated with wall paintings of different types of owl on one side (collection is really good) and random wall paintings on the other. Seating arrangement is quite cool with the counter at the end of it.

I ordered All Day Breakfast Platter which consists of  2 Fried Eggs, 2 sausages (Chicken or Pork - I opted for Chicken and it was bit salty but sausages tends to get salty which can be ignored), French Fries, Bacon, 2 pcs of Toast (actually one piece of bread - the two halves they are calling two pcs of breads).

I also enquired if there are any fresh fruit juice but only watermelon was available so opted for Real Guava Juice instead.
                    

Will have to try their main course and other offerings to make a better judgement but it didn't live upto its hype for me..

Among places that lift your mood up, Wise Owl will score pretty high. Located within the lanes of Hindustan Park, it is pretty easy to find and the location on the map is correct. It is one of the happy places that you could choose for a meet up. And they serve breakfast too.

We chose to be here on a not-so-cold winter morning for breakfast. What makes this place such a happy place is the seating and the food. They have an open air section which can just lift up your mood. We chose to be here. They have a separate menu with a wide set of options from cereals, breads, sandwiches, egg preparations and many more. They even have combos which you may choose. We chose a platter of sandwich and a frittata, which is an omelette with a host of choices of toppings. The frittata was just perfect for a start to the morning. We even tried a platter of chicken sausages. 

Overall it was a wise experience and it beckons many more visits. They even have a wide menu for the all day dining. And with the ambiance that they offer, one may gang up and head to this place for a happy evening hangout.

Happy Eating!!!

A favourite cafe in town ever since they started their operations. Get everything from breakfast to dinner here. Sitting arrangements are spread out and comfortable, both inside and outside.  Items are judiciously priced. Get tea, coffee, sandwiches, baked fish, fish in white sauce, pasta, pizza, beverages and desserts. The staff is hospitable but not prompt enough. The service needs to be improved. Do not miss out the decor and those cute owls! Also check out their very own den of steak at the roof top.

Situated at Hindustan Park this is easily one of the most renowned places here.And it truly lived up to its name..food was overtly delicious and ambiance was good.Pricing was also pretty reasonable. The Chicken Wonderland ordered was the pick of the the lot and justified its name big time!!Overall a must visit place for young and old alike.

Went here for a breakfast with my close friend on her birthday. Planned a nice breakfast for her which we both enjoyed. 
The place is located on Purna Das Road. The interiors are warm and have several owl pieces and frames to justify the name. 

Food-
• Hazelnut latte was very well made and delicious.
• Mushroom on toast was lip smacking with spicy cheese sauce and sauteed mushrooms 
• Veg Italian sandwich had veggies and pesto and was served with chip. It was good, though the char on the peppers could have been better.
• Lastly, we tried their chocolate pancake which was sooo good. 

Service was decent and overall had a good time.

Have to this place a couple of times before this. It is slightly over hyped but not a bad place. Went today with an old friend to catch up over some coffee. We ordered a chicken chilli maggi, an omelette wrap, a Capuchhino and a filter coffee. The omelette wrap was tasty, the maggi wasn't anything to write home about, and the coffees were decent. Overall, a normal meal, which was unnecessarily over priced. The bill was 600 for just 4 items such seems a lot going by quality and quantity. 
You can drop by for a cup of coffee if you have a lot of time on your hands and no where else to be, but not a good choice of you want some real good food.

Heard from a friend that this place serves good continental food ; and ofcourse I had to visit it . It's more of a cafe and less of a restaurant . I opted for a continental dish . The food was decent ; but it was way overpriced for a cafe like that .  A reasonable place to hang-out with your friends and have coffee/snacks. But surely not a place to have lunch/dinner.

After a couple of visits and trial of food, definitely recommend this place for their Ham sandwich, Breakfast platter and Coffee. Both outdoor and indoor seating will please your eyes. In my visit before, tried their sandwiches, and find my love for Ham..😍
This time we went for breakfast, took vegetable sandwich, eggs with toast and coffee. It was morning time and there was no rush of customers so we got served shortly after. Eggs were perfect, toasts were crunchy..coffee was strong! Perfect start for a day for sure! Looking forward to make more visits and taste other dishes. If i rate it,

I have heard a lot about Wise Owl, so I gave them a visit for today's breakfast. The set up was too much like an European cafe, with intricate decor and an outdoor seating. 

I ordered the all day breakfast platter. It had a crispy crunchy toast, two amazing fried soft eggs, chicken sausages, two pieces of bacon and french fries. Butter and ketchup were also served. I wished the bacons were fried a little bit more and the sausages were not cut into small round pieces. I had coffee as well, it was strong and perfect.

I recommend Wise Owl for a very pocket friendly breakfast.

Well.... I have always liked their breakfast more than the flurys one.  Reasons - it has simple menu,  tasty,  cheaper than flurys,  has a smoking area and the area   is peaceful and quite. These things are imp for a breakfast with friends.  However there are cons to it aswell - service is slow,  no butter croissants 😔,  not that budget friendly..but ok ,  reasonable.

Good food. Good ambience. Service is painstakingly slow. Stopped going there because they come to take your order after 30 mins, confirm after 15 mins and serve you in another 45.

Located in fairly upmarket Hindustan park, this cafe offers breakfast, lunch and snacks mostly. Its got a cosy atmosphere with both indoor and outdoor seating. Its also mostly packed so do not find it strange if you need to wait a bit for a seat. A lot of people had recomended this place to me and will likely do the same to everyone however unfortunately the experience i had with the staff and service was very below par. Tardy service with uncleaned tables and i dont even remember how long it took for our food to be served. However I will say the food was more than just beyond reproach. It was good food. Hot, quality, wholesome food. My recomendations:

1. Chicken wonderland
2. Baked fish (basa)

Definitely a place i would recommend, just please pick up the service.

Good place for hangout. But worst place to have breakfast. We had chicken mayo sandwich and expresso. The worst of all. We all are feeling pukish afterwards. The coffee was also not up to the mark. And the worst thing of all is that it is not a cheap place. I would not recommend or encourage anyone to visit this place ever. Worst food quality. Awful.

Southern Avenue and Hindustan Park have been tendering to the needs of a foodie since eternity now, and Wise Owl is just another pleasant eatery. 
With an outdoor seating arrangement, this place will emit positive vibes as soon as you see it. 
Owl murals and showpieces are tucked away in one corner just to live up to the name of it. 
The only difference in the food section is, they provide both junk and healthy food at an affordable price. We had ordered a Grilled chicken honey mustard sandwich and a bowl of chicken cream soup. The sandwich tasted delicious and the soup was loaded with cheese (unhealthy). We concluded our time their with a jar of Hazelnut Shake and a glass of Green Apple Mojito. The Hazelnut blast was the star of the show, it smelled delicious and every sip of it was delectable. 
You might have to load up your pocket a bit if you want to hang out here.

If you are looking fjor a place to just relax come here .

A cozy place 

Always filled up with classy people the aroma is good here.

Situated on the ground floor but as the area is relatively quiet so that won't be an issue.

Surrounded by nice people and having some classy food is the main attraction here.

One thing is bit problematic 

The place on a sunday evening  is too crowded so if you want to be here try to avoid sundays..

I had visited this on a weekday evening. I was pleasantly impressed with the crowd and the ambiance of this place. Nothing exceptional but had a subtleness in the ambiance and atmosphere. Located at a prime location of Purna Das Road this place is pretty.

My friends and I we had ordered A lasagna and flavoured cappuccino. We really enjoyed both the items. The coffee was too good and the food was too tasty. 

Price is little on the higher side considering the price sensitive market as Calcutta. But definitely worth a visit.

I wish them all the best

This is a decent place to dig into some continental food. More than the food, this place is known to be a good place to hangout with friends and spend some quality times. The lesser known rooftop seating arrangement is quiet a jackpot among the mushrooming food joints which are cramped for sufficient open space. The steaks are quiet popular here which is bound to give satisfaction to any foodie. Overall,

Often it so happens that you tend to forget about your regular hangouts. Wise owl is one such joint. The french fries are great. And the quantity is good...like hell lot. The hot chocolate is a must have in these slight chilling days. The chilli cheese toast is good. It feels heavenly puffing away your cigarette and sipping in the hot chocolate. The outdoor sitting is pretty pleasant these days. Service is good. And we are going there again and again and again. Loving it.

Been there today evening for the first time. Have ordered:
1 - Wise owl cappuccino
1 - Lasagne
Cappuccino - They have added too much of sugar, which made it unbearable

Lasagne - Was really good. Loved it

I am sure I will not visit this place again for the pathetic service.

I reached there and occupied a table, waited for about 10 mins,.but no staff came to handover menu or ask for order. Just one person was staring from the counter. Post this attitude, I started for notification around if it's a "self serve" cafe. Could not find any board and finally walked to the counter.the person politely replied, please be seated we will come with menu.

Serving time for coffee was around 10 mins - which I will rate as decent

And Lasagne was around 25 mins.

I finished my food at 8.40 Pm and asked for the bill, which came at 8.50. I was handing over my credit card for payment, he told he will come back for it, and picked only the used plated and went.
There was no other staff around to whom I could ask to take the payment.

So finally it was 9.05-07 when someone heard me and came and took the payment.

I was pissed off with the pathetic service and asked whether they have any feedback form .

After 5 mins the staff came with a feedback form but without pen. I wanted my voice to reach the management, but could not afford to waste 5 more minutes for getting a pen.

Such a pathetic and unprofessional gesture was not expected from this place.

Hope management is having a look at this review

Since my time in Kolkata, I have been to this cafe at least twice a month! 

Having said so, Lets get on with the basics 

1. Food - Sandwiches and Salads are very nice and easy on the pocket. (Please note, I am comparing high end pricing here, which does not include sandwiches from "Mio Amore" or "Just Baked")

2. Sitting - Both indoor and outdoor. The outdoor space is usually filled up as smoking is allowed. (Inference - People smoke a lot). Indoor is calm and gentle with warm lights. The cupboard filled up with multiple sculptures of variation owls is astonishing)

3. Quality - Food quality is high! The salads are fresh and the chickens doesn't seem processed

4. Attitude - Friendly and affable

What I dislike about the place is the ridiculously slow service. I mean, its really slow. But again, people seem to be okay with it.

Overall, Yes a thumbs up! A must visit, a much chill out place!

Well, had been there before but for few moments or just to had a cup of coffee! Today we spent a long discussion hour in here and with a lingering memory in mind. Wise Owl felt too wise today, menu wise. We've ordered Fish n chips along with Chicken steaks served in mushroom sauce. The lightly battered chicken fillet bathed in rich, creamy sauce gave me an ultimate satiety! And of course what a neat plating. Afterwards we took Wise Owl Special Coffee, the hot sensuous aroma came later through a rich caramelized frothy layer, believe me I'm addicted to it now.

The cafè, you would like to take your friends for a great catching up session or simply sit with your laptop and finish your deadline work, while you have their amazing cappuccino. I have tried garlic bread to sandwiches,masala tea to Mojito.
The sandwich, specifically cheese one, is the perfect thing which you look for after a tiring day or a not so good day at work. Filled with gooey cheese and great crust outside.
The garlic bread on the other hand, is not so my favourite for its too garlic pungent flavour.
The beverages here is great. But, do try the masala tea over here, with the potato wedges.
You will thank me later. ;)

Café situated near hindustan park. Has outdoor sitting, rooftop dine in section and long AC cabin. Ambience was really good. Most peaceful and calm environment in any hindustan park area restaurant. Hospitality was Lower average and service was worst. They take half hour to take order after call them 4 times to take order and to serve my drink they take more 15 minutes and that's not all for giving me bill they take another half an hour even after calling them twice. finally I have to walk myself to cashier counter in my third attempt to call them to give me bill and then after waiting my another 5 minutes they gave me bill. I'm very strongly suggest to the management that please increase your staff or give them proper training. Presentation was good and price was reasonable. I tried their peach soda it was refreshing, properly made and tastes Delicious. Must visit place but only if you have lots of time to waste.

We had ordered cheese ball, spicy chicken and chef's special non veg spaghetti.. The cheese ball was hard, spaghetti was almost veg, couldn't find chicken much.. Only we liked the spicy chicken..

I can't explain in words how I love this place. The ambience, the coziness, the customers who visits this place belong to a different class. Today I came here with my friend as she gave me a treat for her birthday. We ordered Ham sandwich, Blue Lagoon and Wise Owl Special Mac and Cheese Pasta. The last one felt like heaven in a platter. The seasoning of the pasta was perfect. The sandwich was also delicious and the quantity was worth appreciating. This is best place to hang out with friends and have a tummy full of good foods.

This located in Hindustan Park. They have seating arrangements where you can sit outside the cafe which is like a porch or inside in the a.c. 

The décor is very good as if you have a fetish for owls, this is the place to be... You have pictures of owls as well as figurines... 

Coming to the food, the quality is really good though the prices are a bit hiked. But the food is definitely worth it.

The service of this place has earned itself a bad name, but consider the place gets full all the time, the waiter's can't keep up much. 

Kudos to Wise Owl....

Located in a prime location on Purna Das Road, the Wise Owl has made quite a name for itself within a short span of time. It's a small Cafe, offering both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements, to catch up with old friends over coffee and snacks. Although it offers little(or no) room for privacy, the place has a nice and subtle decoration. 

I walked in with a bunch of my old friends, primarily to catch up with them after a long time. So, we had a minimal order of Cold Coffee, Hot Chocolate, Fish and Chips, and later on, we decided to go for a Caramel Custard. However, they took quite a long time to serve. The fact that I visited during the Pujas, and the staff were few in number, although the cafe was nearly full, might have led to the delay. Coming to the food, the Hot Chocolate was pretty darn amazing, while the others were nothing special. While most of the places just serve Complan mixed with milk in the name of Hot Chocolate, this place actually stays true to the name. I felt the food is slightly overpriced, although it's difficult to find a cafe in Kolkata now having reasonable rates. 

Overall, the lack of space is a major disadvantage of this place, but you can always keep going back to try out the endless menu.

A legend in itself. Wise owl is the statement place for most Kolkata foodies. Pretty much easy to locate, near azad hind dhaba !
Outdoor and indoor seating available. Rooftop seating all the more attractive always.
No complaints against the food, the staff, ambience, courtesy, variations anything . For me it's am all-time say yes place to visit.
Caramel custard I love love loved. Silky, smooth, subtle and the sharp caramelly sauce shooting your taste buds. Yes made your mouth water! 😻
Also had ordered a shrimp pesto spaghetti. Which I almost ate up before taking a picture of. But I assure you it tastes amazing. The pesto sauce , the fresh sauteed prawns, and slithery spaghetti all put together brings a great tasty affair in your mouth!

Also the chicken alexandria , served alongside herbed rice and veggies. Creamy, cheesy sauce, baked with chunks of melting chunks of chicken. You can eat up alone, all of it..without feeling pukish because of the cheesyness. It has a controlled substance in it. Theatre doesn't overpower your taste.
Good going. cheers!

A well-known café in south Kolkata , no doubt , a cafe which is well-known . But their service , haha ! Well , it is known to us . The only drawback of this café . They take a lot of time to take your order and to place it on your table . Apart from this problem , you can call it one of the best . I had there special club sandwich and choco latte . Food is good ! You can also chill there for hours . They have a special smoking lounge, for which I'll be there again and again . Thank you for represent us such a "boithok-khana" in nowadays . 
Thank you ! :-)

For popularity wise owl management team don't bother for walk in gùest....for them only movie shots is important. At least they can keep one of their team members to inform the guest due to same reasons they won't be able to serve.

The rating for this place is this low primarily on account of a single reason - the service is pathetic. The breakfast opens at 10.30 am. But for us it got served many requests and a good two hours later around 12.30 pm. The servers brought in the water towards the end of the meal. Our orders for coffee had to be cancelled on account of a prolonged delay. And honestly I do like the ginger honey tea here but was too afraid to order it given the wait. The food - toast, eggs, bacon, sausages - was a good and simple fare. The cheese and chicken omlette was good enough, the chocolate pan cakes were not

My experiences here are rather mixed. The food has been really good at times, but a couple of visits have been really disappointing. Once I was given plain bread without filling instead of a sandwich, while another time, the blueberry muffins served were sticky and tasteless. In terms of service, the waiters don't seem well trained at all, and are sluggish. The decorations are really nice however, and the ambience is quite good.

Wise Owl is a cafe as well as a steak-house located in Southern Avenue. It is a well decorated pretty cafe. There is outdoor seating as well! The interiors are done up with paintings and pictures of cute owls! ❤ 

Coming to the food, they have a wide variety of starters, pasta,pizza,burgers, sandwitches,salads and the main course also have a number of good options! Desserts and coffee deserves special mention as well!  A impressive menu I must say!😊

We odered california sandwitch,chicken sandwitch,meat lover's sandwitch, spagetti bologonaise, garlic bread and cold coffe. 


California sandwitch has egg, chicken slices and was fresh. Meat lover's sandwitch was simply delicious! ❤ Chicken sandwitch was prepared with freshly minced chicken. Coming to the spagetti, it had the right amount of red chilli flakes and pepper, and it was served with minced chiken pieces prepared in sauce on top! Loved it too! 


Though the service was little slow. But I loved the place. Pretty place with awsome food❤

The service was really bad as my friends and I had to wait for half an hour for a glass of water. Served the main course before some starters. Good ambience though, on the roof. The steaks were okay but seemed a bit undercooked for my expectations. Overall, I've had enough of this place after my first visit here.

I recently visited this place after a long time. This place is surely well decorated with those various owls. I prefer the  indoor area as I'm a non smoker. I'd say it's more beautiful inside than outside, specially in this weather. Burgers are really something. A very few places in Kolkata make burgers of this standard. 
I must say service is very poor and slow. The staffs are cooperative sure but they lack experience and skill.

Located at Hindustan Park area, this is a cute n small cafe plus steak-house. Being well maintained and neat, this place is pleasant to the eyes. Indoor plus outdoor seating available. Wall arts and decor are pretty.
Coming to the food. Mostly what you get here is of the breakfast and snacks genre. When you visit this place, do not forget their coffee. It is highly recommended. However other items are tasty too.
It would cost around 800 for two for a sumptuous meal.
All together a good and decent place to visit.

One fine morning, me and my fiancee decided to visitthis place for breakfast. Heard a lot about this place for breakfast. This is located on purna das road near priya cinema hall. We ordered 1 “All day breakfast platter”, one plate of garlic bread, one cup of coffee, one glass of orange juice.

All day breakfast platter had 2 fried egg omlettes, 2 chicken sausages,french fries, bacon and 2pcs of toast. This was really great as a whole but cud have been better if the juice would have been included in this platter. We found the garlic bread to be equallygood as well.

Service was very slow as there was only 1 person who was taking the orders and preparing the dishes.

Overall a good place to have breakfast with an owl theme all over the walls but the service needs an improvement.

Went to wise owl finally. Long over due.
Quaint place with both outdoor and indoor seating. Music is pleasant without being overbearing (something most places get wrong).

Service is slow. Be warned. 

Menu was good and versatile. They seem to have compiled popular snack items and foods into a single menu without it appearing too mashed up. Good selection for hangout with friends or just to chill. Saw a good collection of people just sipping on coffee and chatting.

Food itself is good. Nothing 5 star but good enough to be better than average. We ordered the barbeque chicken wings - tasty but with a slightly more chinese tinge than barbeque suace tinge. Tasty nonethess.
We also ordered spicy prawn with a red bellpepper rice and a chicken steak with pepper sauce, mashed potatoes and greens. Both were decent. Comfort food - not over spiced or over creamed as is the case with many restaurants. 

All in all, i can see why people enjoy this place. Hope service improves a bit but beyond that would recommend this place for any casual treat u may want to give to anyone.

** Location = Hindustan Park.

** Brief = On a cold evening a group of friends wanted to have some coffee and enjoy a round of gossip and zomato guided us to Wise Owl.

** Ambiance = They have outside seating facilities which made us choose the outside one despite the interior being very posh and nicely decorated. The servers are slow people(no complaints at all) giving you ample opportunity to enjoy a good long gossip.

** Things tried = We tried Capuccino, Latte, Earl Grey Tea and Ginger Honey tea.
Chicken Sandwich and cheese sandwiches to enjoy our beverages.

The Capuccino was awesome and we enjoyed the rest of the beverages as well.
The chicken sandwich was too good for my liking. Ample chicken and nicely prepared.

We had a fun time with the food and the chit-chats.

** Purse Check = Rs.700-800/- would be enough for 2 people.

** Overall = A nice place to meet up with friends and for all age groups alike. Cheers :)

It looks good from outside and when you come inside, you can see owl in different styles in photo frames which is quite interesting which are on the right hand side of wall.  It's an owl themed cafe.
Outdoor seating available.

First one should talk about is the "AMBIENCE" .......Awsome Environment......One will automatically become cheerful to have a "Jomiye Adda" with your group......Foods are Just Delicious......Ordered 1 plate "Meat Lovers Sandwich" & 1 plate "Tuna Sandwich" .......The Sandwich tasted better than we expected. If you are worrying about the qty, 3 of us struggled to complete 2 plates.......Wise Owl always have a touch of "South Kolkata Posh" Environment......and always a recommended place for an evening date if your better half is comfortable with Cafe, Adda & Sandwiches. Wise Owl offers you more of an Up-City Ambience than Coziness......Overall, Wise Owl demands multiple Re-Visits........and about the hole in your pocket, common ! An Evening in this beautiful ambience with your better half or that old school group you missed a lot is worth that much hole........ 👌☕🍵🍰🌮🌯

Went on another Café hunt today, and this time, it was The Wise Owl. There are positives and negatives about this place. The positives are certainly the ambiance and the outdoor seating area. The interiors are immersive and upmarket, with lots of pictures of the hooting nightbird. 

We ordered a Wise Owl special cappuccino and a hot chocolate and a bacon cheese pizza to go with it. The  cappuccino did not have the slight bitterness to it and tasted like a creamless latte. The frothing on top of it was excellent and its taste was memorable. The hot chocolate, again, had too much sugar in it and I had to swap it with the less sugary cuppa midway through drinking it. The pizza was average at best and felt was lacking a bit of umami. The bacon was the pizza's saving grace as it imparted a nice taste to it. I was let down by its overall taste for a 6 Inch pizza that put a pocket pinch. The whole experience was just meh.

God knows why I have not reviewed Wiseowl yet... having going there ever since it opened doors five years ago... having spent many evening amidst laughter, deep conversations, or locked in someone's eyes (once upon a time).... and of course coffee and food and adda.... Wiseowl seems to be a part of my recent history. Today I went with Sayantani for a late cuppa and loads of adda and this was after quite sometime and I found wiseowl has two ney things... a wall of different pictures of owls and a new extended and expensived menu!!! We ordered something time tested ... bacon wrapped Prawn fritters and Chicken stroganoff.... and Wise owl special cappuccino for me and Hazelnut latte for Sai... but alas... the thick strips of bacon that covered the prawns earlier was not thin and emaciated. The ketchup served with it... was well what we call "chal-kumror sauce" ... cheap ketchup adulterated with gourd or some such things.... the stroganoff though very tasty was too buttery.... enough to give us a coronary attack. The wise owl special cappuccino was by far the most delicious filter coffee I had ever tasted in Calcutta... and today it was kindda bleak and lacking in flavour... the Hazelnut was gorgeous!!!
I shall return partly because it is a habit and partly because i need to try try the new exciting things like burgers on their new menu!

This cafe or coffee shop whatever you prefer to call it is nice. Being located at the heart of Hindustan Park, its not that difficult to locate. Coffee is fine. As in most cafes. The food is fine too. The waiters even though polite, can be a little careless when it comes to serving your order. Next up the ambiance. Well, as you enter the cafe, you'd be greeted with all forms of owls and owlets(pictures ofcourse) staring grimly or amusingly at you. There is a screen at the counter which is continually advertising vegetables or farm houses or something of that sort. Though the place is small, it looks cosy and quite comfortable. 
And if you are unlucky you could end up sitting next to a Tollywood star who would just be ordering coffee of some sort and spend most of the time stirring it.

Of the many places that open early in Kolkata, surely this must be one of the best ones. I have had numerous sojourns at this place - all breakfasts without exceptions. The place a laid back approach and is ideal place to while away time and gossip away like there's no tomorrow. The waiters are friendly and maintain their distance. 

The combo breakfast meals are good and filing. The stuff with mentioning is their mushrooms on toast which is not only alluring to the eye but a delight to the taste buds as well! The bacon is well cooked but stingy in size and quantity. Cafe mocha and earl grey of London are worth their prices. The stuff you should never order is their sandwiches - dry, insipid and hurting to the throat. They should take some coaching classes from the neighborly mom next door to get it right. Also avoid the strawberry shakes.

Will give a detailed feedback once I have their lunch. But definitely a must visit what with its own-theme...

Coming to their food I would give a thumbs up to their Pasta dishes, Maggi and yes their lovely Fish Fingers.  Their chicken continental dishes needs a bit of uplift when it comes to the quality of the meat. Over all a great place to hangout with friends where you can sit for hours and chat.

We ordered CHICKEN ARROSTO, CHICKEN LASAGNIA, GRILLED FISH IN LEMON BUTTER SAUCE, Guava juice and coffee. lasagna is one of my fav Italian dishes. But here it was more of red sauce , I would have preferred more white. Taste was good. Grilled fish in lemon sauce was amazing. I love mashed potatoes. chicken arrosto was also good. But one point  service is really very slow here. As we were sitting outdoors we were paid least attention. we had to call the waiter thrice for a  fork. 
Otherwise a good place for meal.

One of those restaurants in South Kolkata with a  fetching name that might lure you here.  If you are looking for a new place to hang out with buddies and eat, this is one of the nicer places you can visit. Can't say the same with respect to its service or food though, both being mediocre. Every dish we tried couldn't offer that delight to one's taste buds that lingers for awhile . Will Recommend their sandwiches, which are quite good. Nothing extraordinary, but worth a visit for the overall experience.

This place was in my wishlist since almost two years but could not make to this place since new to Kolkata  I found it a bit difficult to track . Finally today I could make to this place and I was expecting a lot from this place. Ambiance was good having different cute pics of owl and collection of owl show pieces. Moving to service was not very pleased by it . May be few staff were new because the In-charge himself was finding hard to make them work. I ordered London fog (early grey tea with hazelnut and milk that's what they said) but I found that it tasted like hazelnut in milk and no taste of earl grey. Apart from this ordered veg burger which was good but nothing out of the place

The most overrated cafe in town. Besides the decor and the ambience, everything was average. Not to mention the service which was simply horrible. We had to literally beg for everything. From menu card to a glass of water to the bill. The food was served cold as it arrived pretty late. They take 30 minutes to prepare a cold coffee. This is ridiculouss. The customers in another table was complaining too. The place immediately needs more hands to improve the service. The quality of the food needs to improve as well.

What a fabulous place for a long lazy chat with friends or for business meetings! No one will ever ask you to leave, nor will they nag you to order as soon as you take your seat. To add to that, they serve some truly mouth watering food. Their egg and cheese sandwich and the meat lovers club sandwich are really delicious and extremely filling. Their breakfast platter is also pretty good. In the main course, the baked fish, the fish florentine, the stroganoff, the grilled chicken are absolutely out of this world. To top it all, I really love the coffee they serve. I could go there just for the coffee.
Note: If you are in a hurry and looking for a quick bite, do not go to Wise Owl. Like I said, they give you loads of time to order. Unfortunately, that also means they take all the time in the world to take your order, serve it and produce the check.

The interior part is good too, just that I am more inclined towards the outer one. The sandwiches and pastas are really good, so are the coffee and the mock tails. Try out the choco avalanche and the blueberry mousse in the desserts section.

A chic café in Hindustan Park with both indoor and outdoor seating area. Just go down the lane next to the Golpark Petrol Pump. The place is always packed. 

They have a pretty decent items on the menu. I loved the fries with garlic aioli. The chicken wings are good too. Chicken steak is also delicious. 

Coming to the beverage, the coffee isn't up to the mark. I have tried a couple of times, and never liked it.  The lemon ice tea is also pathetic. However, the darjeeling tea is ok. 

One thing that this place needs to improve on is their service. So damn slow. Once we had to wait for over an hour to have chocolate avalanche. And it was so not worth the wait.

Ordered 2 shakes and one Russian salad at 7:05 pm and shakes was arrived at 7:32 pm.. Even I can make a shake within 10 mins.

Russian salad was just bunch of potatoes and peas.. also served at 7:45 pm... worst experience yesterday....

Okay, so my review might be a little diplomatic about this place. I am a huge fan of this place. I have tried their meat lover's sandwich, almost all kinds of burgers and coffee definitely. But somehow I was never satisfied with the food. What pulls me back to this place is undoubtedly the ambience.

A thoroughly disappointing affair!
The quality of food fails to justify the price by a long shot. They take your culinary knowledge for granted and then take you for a ride with their 'quarter hearted' preparation. The honey mustard chicken sandwich was almost drowning in a diluted syrupy substance which had no traces of honey or mustard. The coriander chicken soup at Rs 181  was a sheer manifestation of unparalleled  lethargy and culinary illiteracy. And their service was slower than the slowest snail. Holler, if they avoid locking eyes with you. Wise Owl should approach Guinness book of world record for delivering a plate of crappy sandwiches in approximately 1 hour. Most likely you'll end up investing more money and time, on your overall experience, than it deserves. There are far better alternatives in and around Gariahat/ Golpark. Avoid it if you seek value for money and definitely avoid it if you're a connoisseur. All in all you'll cry foul if you visit Wise Owl!

I love their burgers.Now the review, the place is cozy, it has an outside as well as inside seating, a slow music plays in the background, or used to when I was a regular, been a while.The food is different, good different.I just love their burgers, not the usual one that you get in the regular burger joint.The coffee is awesome! Avalanche is wow. Pasta is good.I have heard about their fish n chips, but didn't get a chance to have them.If in Kolkata, give this a try.

The Wise may not turn here up twice!
This little coffee shop with an European Casual Country Cafe feel, thatched roof, iron railing, tiled floors and lots of owl motifs caught my eye and became my tongue-target for my next afternoon brunch because I wondered what relevance could food have with Owl. In fact, I am still wondering after having my lunch here. But surely, I feel that birds are light & so was my lunch with less portions. Chicken Caciatora was served in disappointingly less quantity, the Chicken fillet in Chicken Picatta with Harissa Sauce was extremely chewy and fibrous. The Fish Florentine was however okay. The dessert Avalanche promised abundance of chocolate. But service is very sluggish and demanded more attention to the clients. 
My Overall Impression -
If I am wise, I will think twice before dropping here again.

It's a cool place to hangout but the coffee is pretty bad. The best food item is definitely Fish Fingers. The staff out there is pretty friendly and cordial. If you plan to sit and work there and connect your laptop...it's a very bad idea as none of the charging points work.
I personally felt the cafe to be overrated.

Where is the negative marking button ? Going into this cafe is my worst decision in my life.  My friends ordered Pork Chops. They served Pork Ribs which were full of oily fat plus medium rare. To be on a safe side I ordered Chicken Risotto. Couldn't take a single bite due to a foul smell. The Waiters were very adamant about accepting the truth. Chose not to pay.

I went there with one of my friend,, the cafe was recommended by me and I was very much disappointed with the food as well as the service.. Even we need to ask for the glass of water too as it was not served in our table.. We ordered cold coffee, wise owl special cappuccino, brownie with chocolate sauce and caramel custard.. The food is below average quality.. And once again pls improve your service.. We ordered French fries and it was served after more than half an hour when we already lost our craving for it.. Overall an awful experience we got visiting there..

A coffee shop at one corner at Hindusthan park.Both outdoor and indoor sitting available.The internal decor not that attractive but yess the chilly ambience inside will steal your heart in a hot summer afternoon as it had done the same with us ☺.A showcase having collection of Variety of Owls ,i think that is what it has gained its name from . It also has steak house on its 1st-2nd floors.
Well when coming to the contexts FOOD- yess they were absolutely worth the level.Me and my friend had orderd a cold coffee and a brownie with icecream .Well the brownie tatsed exotic. They had also given extra chocolate syrup which we also mixed with the cold coffee to enhance its taste.😊 Cold coffee which was 80 bucks was way better than many other famous coffee shops of the city.
Quite a pocket friendly place. Even inclusive all taxes the bill wont disappoint you at all.An apt place for indulging yourself in a long adda session.

I visited this place to spruce up my Monday evening with adda,over coffee and dessert.

Location:We got down at Triangular park and walked along the Purna Das road,it fell on our right.It's situated just next to Foodie by nature.

Ambience-Pretty basic yet living upto it's 'cozy café' promise.There are owl artifacts in showcases,some posters of coffee adorning the walls and the air-conditioners work wonders in keeping the place chilly.I didn't like the fact that the place was reeking of eucalyptus phenyl.I look forward to the inviting smell of coffee and caramel wafting through the air in coffee shops and I was disappointed.

Food-My friend and I ordered a cold coffee and brownie with icecream.The cold coffee was good but the brownie dessert stole my heart.It came in a deconstructed form with brownie,icecream and chocolate sauce in separate containers.The idea of assembling your own brownie dish makes you giddy,I'll vouch for that.The taste was delicious.The brownie was gooey,the icecream was standard fare and the ganache was glossy and thick without being overtly sweet.

Service-This is the weak link in their chain.We had to summon the servers for the menu,the food and the bill.Our table wasn't served water while the others were.The lackadaisical attitude of the servers was irritating.But they were well-behaved atleast.

Prices-Pocket friendly.Our check amounted to Rs.240 for one cold coffee and one brownie with icecream including taxes which was quite economical,given the quality of food.

Avoid this place if you're ravenously hungry.Best suited for laid-back,lazy addas.

This place was also visited during the RKM German classes time. A posh cafe with prices on the higher side but food is good so the money can be shelled out.
Had tried 2 mocktails, pasta in red sauce, a chicken burger with extra French fries and a chicken salad. The salad was fresh and the vinaigrette used complemented it really well. The fries were done to perfection. The burger was huge. But the party could have been a bit jucier. The pasta was on the spicy side and the seasoning was a bit less but that was easily adjusted.
Good and prompt service.

It's one of those classic places that people vouch for but recently had a bad experience here. Was there with a friend. Had order sandwiches and Cafe Mocha Cold. The order took some time. We had to change the table because of the fan's placement. They took a long time to bring the order that was prepared 15 mins back but got lost on its way I supppose. Next we order chocolate shake and mango shake as that was best we thought to beat the summer blues but I was very disappointed with the mango shake. Although it's a mango season, they prepared the shake with mango syrup which was so sweet that you hardly to gulp more than one sip. plus nobody cared to inform us that they will not be using fresh mangoes for it.

I was really disappointed after my first visit. However on visiting this beautiful café again today, my views have completely changed. The trick is, you need to order wisely at this café (hence the name :P ), or else you might end up having a huge hole in your pocket. 
We visited this place at around 4 in the afternoon and it was moderately empty, and we got a seat immediately, much to my delight! The ambience is cute and cozy and this place is a favourite hangout zone for the genY. 
Now coming to the food. We ordered :
• Chicken Poutine - this dish was delicious. The base comprised of French fries and it had a layer of shredded chicken which was baked to perfection. Man! I'm absolutely in love with this dish! 
• Chicken wings in bbq sauce - amaaaaaaazing! The quantity was great! 8 big pieces of chicken wings with the lipsmacking sauce. Yum yum yummmmmm!
• Brownie with ice-cream and chocolate sauce - I loved how they provided us with the chocolate sauce and the ice cream separately. A completely 'do it yourself' thing. The walnut brownie was soft and the hot chocolate sauce was sinful. Well, I licked the bowl empty. :P
Pocket pinch - 600. That's because we had a 15% discount coupon. But let me let you, it's worth every penny. The service is quick and staff is very courteous. The poutine was served in 10mins flat, though the wings took around 25mins, but I'm not complaining. Nonetheless I had a great time. And my pocket feels oh so good! :D
Coming back again for sure. Love!

We ordered cold coffee with icecream and barbeque glazed chicken wings! 
The plate with almost 10 pieces of wings all baked to perfectn and coated with sauce looked appetizing.. And were equally tasty as well..d cold coffe was just average.. But the place is worth a visit..! Tho a bit pricey still the food is worth it

This wasn't my 1st visit to the place as I had been here a while back when I only consumed coffee, not fair to review a restaurant only by consuming coffee! 

I choose to spend a Sunday at wise owl for breakfast! Must say the food was beyond normal expectations. We tried the ham and cheeze omelette, mushroom on toast , meat lovers club sandwich, pancakes  and cold coffee pictures are attached for reference. 

The food is good but the service is way below normal. It's not that the waiters do not know how to serve but they are short staffed. And the whole process of continuously waiting is killing the vibe. 

Also they don't have wifi , it would be great if they could add that service.

Wise Owl was my first tryst with Kolkata's famous restaurants. I went with a friend of mine and getting a place to sit was the biggest challenge.We didn't get to sit down stairs and hence were taken upstairs. The place was empty except for a few people. The service was not really great. The waiters took a long time to just provide us with a menu card, then with the food and then with the bill. The saviour was the food though. Russian salad was delicious. Still the best I have had. Chicken croquettes were good but a little bland. Steaks were very good. They were out of desserts so no luck there. There was one person who was playing some music for the restaurant. One advice: Just don't. 

Services needs to be improved. Food is good.

I wouldn't mind visiting again provided I get serviced well.

We had ordered cheese chilli toast veg Tetrazzini and double chocolate muffin. It took a little time for the order to come may be because it was packed but when it came the taste covered it all up. Cheese chilli toast was excellent we also. Got 2 Garlic breads with Tetrazzini that's was perfect too. Overall a very good n positive experience. It all costed RS.523/- which was decent engh lil noisy croud go at off hours to njy more

Meeting an old friend and what better place to meet. Prime location.
Opted for non veg breakfast combo, chicken sandwich and Wise owl special cuppacino.
Quite big a platter. Chicken sandwich tastes unique and the chips served with it just lifts it up.
Perfect ambience for a quite breakfast. 
Only let down, one waiter for all the customer doesnot really help. Should look into it

A leisure place and one of the favorite destination for hangouts in south Kolkata. You will find this place crowded on all weekends so you better be lucky enough to get a seat at this sober place. After having not a very good experience at The Wise Owl Steakhouse, we decided to come to the ground floor of the same franchise to uplift our taste buds. Unanimously we decided to go for the Caramel Custurd and the Chocolate Mousse amongst other strong and better contender of dishes. The service is a bit slow considering both of the dishes are readymade. 
Caramel custard was normal in taste, soft in texture and nice in presentation; not good enough to be recommended. The mousse also had an average taste; again nice presentation. Considering the abundant options on main course and less expensive desserts it is a place worthy enough for a second visit. Not to forget its Owl themed decor and terracotta owls of all sizes being showcased at its diner.

I came to grab a quick bite but ended up spending an hour. I have been to this place 3 years before and I have to say that the quality of food has somewhat not been the same like it was before. 
We ordered their Virgin Mojito and Green Apple Mojito which were okayish and could have been better. 
The Chicken Picatta with Harissa Sauce was also not that great as we had expected it to be. I couldn't find what was so special about The Chef's Special Fish and Chips. It was just a normal Fish and chips platter. The  Chicken Alexander was not available since it was a baked item and I couldn't understand why a baked delicacy was not available on a busy evening at 7 pm.

Wise Owl will never disappoint you nomatter at whichever time of the day you visit. However, I personally favour visiting wise owl in the morning, for a casual chat with friends (it started off because most other places are closed in the morning).

If you are smoker,  outdoor seats are also available :)
I quite like the sandwich here. My friend claimed the coffee is just as wonderful! If you want to play it safe, have any, ANY egg item here and you will never ever be disappointed. Otherwise, go on and experiment, this place is quite nice.

The service is a little slower in the morning as compared to the evenings but then, do we not visit coffee shops for long chats? :)

Unlike the steakhouse, the cafe is very popular, air-conditioned (though it has an outdoor seating arrangement), and decorated very well. The ambience is perfect for lazy hangout with friends. 

Having had a meal at the Steakhouse, we ordered a caramel custard and chocolate mousse. The caramel custard, priced at 70 bucks, was too little for quantity and tasted average. The chocolate mousse was better, but not outstanding.

But the ambience makes me want to go back and try out the other dishes.

We ordered the food to be picked up and hence cannot comment on service of staff, ambiance, location etc.
Coming to the food below are my observations:
Chicken Burger-It was soft and juicy and tasted okay.
Mac & Cheese-Both the veg & non-veg options were ordered. It was good taste-wise and so was the seasoning.
Egg & Cheese Sandwich-It was a grilled sandwich and had a good proportion of eggs and cheese.
Chicken Caesar Salad with Mayo dressing-It was light and well seasoned.
Overall, we were satisfied with the food though it didn't have a WOW factor to it.

Very bad experience with the entire hospitality , the food served was stale and when we tried returning the same the manager was hesitant in accepting the same. This place could have been better with good staff but the whole experience was bad.

Expectations were lived up to!
The ambience is just awesome. The sitting arrangement outside adds an edge obviously.
The heavenly cold coffee brought back life in me. And the chicken wings were super duper delicious!! The Chicken Steak platter simply flattered me.
I so wish I lived nearby and could visit the place every other day!
Loved it. Would suggest as a must try for everyone.

Well!! Wise Owl is a place it seems people go to chit chat and relax!! Not to eat or drink. I visited this place on Friday 4th of March..and believe me I was hungry...I ordered a pizza @ 6:50 PM which they said will deliver in 15 minutes. At 7:30 PM, I checked my order and they said it is coming in 5 mins. At 7:40 PM they said it will be served in another 5 mins. I felt that they had not even taken the order. I called the person to know what is going on. They said they are sorry and will take some more time to deliver. With no idea when they will deliver I told them to cancel the order. The staffs at Wise Owl didnot show any regret or repentance of loosing a customer. Moreover, as soon as I said they went to cancel the order. It seems like they are more eager on online food delivery business rather than restaurant business. This kind of place is actually spoiling the whole culture of food, restaurant and cafe.. Had an option I would have rated this place negative..

On each of my visits to Wise Owl, their food has been fantastic, their service contrastingly very slow and poor.
Of all their continental menu, each dish is masterfully cooked, especially the main course dishes cooked with bhekti. Their breads and pastas are wonderful too. Mocktails sound better than they are made, however.
Their indoor seating area is very constricted for space, and all sounds are amplified by the low ceiling and cramped space. They should probably consider adding more sound absorbent materials to their decor, as all that noise and bad service makes enjoying meals rather difficult.
Outdoor seating looks more comfortable, but with everybody smoking, I'm usually restricted to the indoor area.
Their pricing, all things considered, is on the higher side. That might have even been justified if the seating area had been of the standard usually expected, but the way it  is now, paying the bill is rather dispiriting.

Wise owl is a great place to catch up with friends, or go on a romantic date. It has outdoor seating, and you can smoke outside as well, especially for those who love to have a smoke with their coffee/tea.
The lasagna is extremely well made and is just cheesy and yum.
Their sandwiches are pretty good for light snacking, as well as the salads.
 Stay away from the mocktail, they aren't really that good, at least in my opinion. I'd suggest go for the coffee/ tea or their cold counterparts. 
The avalanche is heavenly is soo chocolate-ey. <3

Like the outdoor seating concept we get here, cool ambience, gentle staff, but the food isn't as good as I expected it to be. Somehow I didn't like it that much. The chicken sandwich and the egg burger I ordered was bland. Will visit it again in the future and hopefully the other dishes will help me forget this disappointment.

A place where I planned to come long back but somehow or other missed....Finally paid a visit here today.....
Wise Owl is the usual Cafe with both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangement , a very Intellectual and subtle decor with Owls being the mainstay of decorations. I prsnlly felt the interiors are look alikes of various other cafes I visited in recent times.Same interior designer I guess...!!
The staff are courteous but are very few compared to the population they have to serve and so quite obviously service is slow.They even myt tend to miss salient points like serving water but ask and thou shalt be given !!
Coming to the food,its what gives this place a whole new level.There were two of us and we had ordered Chicken Steak,Chicken Tetrazzeni(Pasta),Caramel Custard and Brownie with ice-cream. The Steak was really well done,mashed potato served artistically and veggies fresh.The Brownie with ice cream was heaven in a plate.The chocolate syrup in a bowl ads a special flvr to it.The pasta was cheesy and creamy but could have done with some more chicken.
Prices are a bit high bt  that's bcz of all the taxes..But surely a place worth visiting !!

Moreover I love the continental dishes this place serves....really tasty as well as filling.
Foodie tip: If u don't get a place here u can go inside n sneak in upstairs to the rooftop using the lift to #TheWiseOwlSteakhouse. The place is always available n u get great steaks there.

Coffee & Adda!

Wise Owl is the newest addition to the long list of coffee destination in Kolkata that double up as places of soulful discussions and addas.

The place is tastefully built and very clean. The coffee is good. They have a decent breakfast and meal menu. But since we were here for coffee, we thought chocolate mousse would cut it. The chocolate mousse was delicious. Highly recommended. 

Must visit.

Stumbled upon this cafe on way back from shopping at Gariahat. 

Food - We tried chicken chilly garlic (Maggie) noodles and Coleslaw sandwich. The best Coleslaw sandwich ever! 
Ambience - Insides is well lit, lot of owl stationary, spaced out sitting arrangement.

Overall, this place is cool to catch up with friends for a light meal or coffee.

The attendants looked disinterested we had toh knock them every know and then for our order.  The food was ok though. One can go in for the ambience feel but the place is nt welcoming for the second time. So a wise no to wise owl for a second dropping

Had heard a lot about this place, so decided to try this place. Its known for its amazing breakfasts, firstly, come to the decor, its at par with its name, owls all around :p But a supercute place! We ordered a chicken caesar salad, fish and chips and chocolate avalanche, all of them were so amazing and filling. Rates are pretty moderate, it came up to 700 something. Not that pricy, not that cheap. However its worth it, the quantity is good too, I would to go there again.

When it comes to service there performance reaches a new low since they have very few support staff !!! Thus, in short if you want to chill for hours on a lovely Sunday Wise Owl is the most apt place to be in !!!

A cozy cafe with a pretty outdoor seating on beautiful winter morning and menu card offering a good English breakfast.what else you need for good Saturday morning?
Ahhhh...Yeah I forgot u need some good service. That's where this place failed big time for me..I dont know about other days..but today on a Saturday morning what I experienced as a service is pathetic.

A single man at counter managing around 20-30 people,making each party wait for minimum 20 minutes to take the order,then the order comes 30 mins later and if this is not enough when you want to pay and leave they will take another 30-45 mins to present you the bill.

Yes this is exactly what I faced.After 40 minutes of constant nagging ,complaining and pleading rather I got the bill that too not a proper bill a manual one since they were facing some software issues.

Hell of a experience I must admit.
I don't want to talk about food its not bad ,way better than the service but my experience turned bitter.

I hope the management is listening and they will take some actions on this area.If they are serving breakfast they need to  put more people specially during the weekends.
The rating is only for the outdoor seating arrangements which is quite classy

Thanks

It was like a burst of tangy and spicy flavour in my mouth. The salty and crispy fries complimented it perfectly. The service was a bit slow though. But the wait was worth it.

Well, one of my cousins, who is a restaurant manager in a very reputed hotel, recommended this place. In fact he came along with us. We ordered tenderloin steaks and I was terribly disappointed to see the quality of meat. It was for sure was not tenderloin. The mashed potatoes were stale and tasteless. Fish and chips were equally bad. It was a horrible experience. I do not think the owner/manager was around and hence staff cut corners.

It was sticky and the flavour really did not come out till we added salt and pepper to it. Lastly we had chicken caesar salad which was okay too. The quantity was good and looking forward to more visits. Want to try their coffee.

I go here at least once a month to meet friends, of course. Think I've had breakfast, finger food, lunch, evening coffee, and dinner here, at different points in time. I love the setting - very European. It's this little piece of the laid back country side setting, right in the middle of the city. 

Now about the food. The coffee is always great and they never go wrong with that. The food however takes bit of a downturn every once in a while. But they get back again. This is one place that does a chicken Caesar salad with a vinaigrette dressing instead of a mayo and it's really light and refreshing. Try the fish preparations they serve - they're nice. Especially fish florentine and fish in lemon butter sauce.

However at times the slow service is a shame, and your food kind of gets to you cold. The last thing you want is getting to eat cold food after almost an hour's waiting. The place is crowded all the time, even on weekdays, so fill up on your ration of patience if you're planning to hang here. Over the years I have witnessed many a customer storming out because they didn't get waited upon within 10-15 minutes of their arrival. Trust me these guys are so busy all the time, a little mishap here and there is not really gonna hurt their business. 

But all in all, this is a nice place to go to and hang over a good cuppa. Try it out if you haven't already - it's worth it.

Purna das road is on it way to becoming foodies paradise. I have been hearing quite a lot about this new steak joint. Wise owl. But somehow it always skipped our wish list. Finally today evening while just out for a walk, me with one of my friend came across this eating joint. It was all packed and they were running a 20 min. Wait. So, we decided to check this place out while coming back. It was around 6.30 and when we came back luckily we got a table without any wait. It is a small food joint buzzing with activity and positive vibe. You can easily make out that this outlet is short staffed. Or may be readiness was not in place for the full house. Service was slow and after calling 2-3 times we were given the menu and water. We just decided to have sandwiches and leave. Once we placed our order, another server came asked us if we would like to order something.  We told him we already placed our order and requested him to check the status and let us know. That never happened.  Service was slow and so the kitchen.  We were served after 30 min. That too, not the one that we ordered. We decided not to complain cus we were running out of time. So we had our food and quickly left.
Overall not a good experience or may be just a bad day for them..

My friends and I visited this pretty place a few weeks ago. The rating is purely for the taste of the food we ordered. This was the second eatery we visited that day and our stomachs were kinda full. Still we decided to order one thing, and decided that thing to be Chicken Lasagna. This was the first lasagna I ever tasted and this remains the best till date. The Chicken Lasagna of Wise Owl made me fall in love with this dish head over heels! The cheesy goodness is just to die for! One single lasagna can be shared between two people, if you ask about the quantity. One dish, but that dish was more than enough. Pure bliss! :)

This was not my first visit to wise owl, which is what surprised me given how the quality has fallen. The prices now seem exorbitant given I have visited some great cafés serving excellent food at pocket friendly prices. 
We had ordered fish and chips with tartar sauce, Chicken tetrazzini pasta and Meat lovers club sandwich.

The crust of fish and chips was crunchy but was very salty that destroyed the tender taste of the fish inside. Although the sandwich is named meat lovers club and is supposed to contain chicken ham and egg with cheese, all we got was overdose of egg.
The pasta was the best of all. Nicely made with generous amount of cheese in it. Tastes really good. The ambience is cost and fit for a through chat down with friends. The iced lemon tea was really great.

Wise owl has become one of the happening hangouts of south kolkata. the ambience is undoubtedly very cosy and warm, specially the outdoor sitting and the quirky owly getup of the place brings a comfortable smile. Coming to food, they serve some awesome coffee! The cafe Mocha deserves special mention with its slightly tangy yet rich chocolate taste. I found the chicken ceaser salad good as well..just that the bread crumbs were too dry. In a way, good place to hangout but a bit expensive to be a regular adda place.

p.s. I entered the place eating a ganache pastry which i bought from soemwhere else. to avoid loosing the only available table outdoor and no question of compromising on the pastry, i took my seat with the pastry in hand. And they allowed me to have it there :) :) Good people respect good food, i liked that! ;) :P

Underwhelming is what the Wise Owl is. Granted that the Wise Owl offers good decor and acceptable service, the food doesn't really hit you as hard as I hoped it would. 

The beverages were pretty pedestrian, although there's only so much you can come to expect from coffees and shakes. Coming to the food -- the fries were alright, nothing special (improper amounts of salt and pepper). The burger was edible, you'll quite easily get better burgers in Kolkata, for cheaper I might add. Nothing on our menu stood out -- and to be fair, we didn't order anything which could have.

However, the Wise Owl does well as a joint to grab a quick bite, if you have cash to blow. I do not recommend full meals, even though I'm yet to try a full meal out here. Decent joint, but I've seen far better.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

I did visit it just after the puja for the first time. It was pretty good but quite expensive. The ambience was good and quality of food was great. My friends and I had a chicken sandwich and a cream chicken soup, both of which lacked salt and pepper to our taste but they were wholesome. Overall nice experience would like to visit again.

Over my other visits I have tried their Bacon Burger and Pastas. All the dishes are oh so yum and I was in love with the ambience. 
Loved the food thouroughly would recommend to everyone and visit again soon with

If you're around Gariahat & Hindustan Park , Wise owl is the answer. May be some coffee & sandwich, but class of dishes. Though most of the time I had to stand in the que to get a sit but I felt the wait was worth.

We went there in mid September and I've been meaning to write this since that evening.

The open air space is great with wooden furniture et al. We were so happy with the getup that we decided that if the food was as good, we'd be here regularly. Then we looked for the menu..

We ordered a gnocchi to a totally clueless and thoroughly helpless soul who was the waiter that day. Not his fault, training is the organisation's responsibility. No one asked us how we wanted the steak (I like mine medium rare)

Food was served without any cutlery AT ALL!

The mushroom gnocchi was served  smashed and in a puddle of thick white sauce. The steak was more than well done which made it totally inedible. We toyed with the boiled vegetables on the side and finally paid our bill and left. I think we filled a feedback form as well, but no one came to ask us a word of feedback. We ate silently and left very fast.

The one rating is for the seating space. Nothing else deserves to be rated.

Nuff said.

I was walking through that area on a cold afternoon and saw the sign. The name rang bell as a well known bite joint referred by number of people. I was with a hungry stomach and sometime to kill. So entered there for a quick bite and sip. 
    Minimalist decor with intimate set up was pleasing to eyes and soothing to mood. The staffs were courteous. Ordered Meat Lovers Club Sandwich and Hot Chocolate which were served in 15 minutes. The tableware was simple and clean. The food looked inviting. 
    One bite in the sandwich and my excitation deemed. What could be wrong ? Chicken, egg, ham & cheese are my favourite ingredients for sandwich. I took apart the sandwich and then realised that sandwich looked great because it consists of 3 fluffy 1 cm thick bread slices which were separated by barely visible microscopic slices of non-carbs ingredients. So I could not feel the taste of coveted Meat Lovers Club Sandwich. One sip in hot chocolate instantly transported me to childhood days when my mother would heap a spoonful of Bournvita to make me drink milk. 
    So at the end my stomach was filled with ubiquitous toasted bread and bournvita-doodh found in many tea-stalls till few years back and my mind, with a big disappointment.

I agree with mist of the comments here which says that its over hyped. Definitely a cozy set up. We went for breakfast and ordered Spanish omelette which was pretty good. However disappointment was the infamous honey mustard sandwich. The wise owl special coffee was indeed delightful. Service was a bit slow. But courteous. Might go back again to try the other popular items in the menu.

A bad evening it was..A highly over hyped place that can be given a miss..ambience was good,decorations were good,location was good,waiter quality was so so but sadly I dont eat any one of these..What I eat is the food and that was not at all good..Cream of chicken soup was bit too sweet and was served in a bowl that was chipped off at the edges,cummon u dont pay ur hard earned money for such a badly presented food and guys when u r into food business decorations and presentation of food matters as much as its taste..the caesar salad was so so without any distant trace of cheese in it (caesar had cheese in the recipe I suppose)..could have been a bit more tastier..and coming to the chicken lasagnia , it was disaster.Not going to suggest this place at all..

Located on a quiet lane off Golpark, Wise Owl has two seating options, indoor and outdoor. It is not very big, but it is definitely very cosy, providing you with the perfect atmosphere to spend a quiet afternoon with friends. A group of four, we ordered Grilled Chicken and Honey Mustard Sandwich, Ham Sandwich, Chicken Burger and Chicken in BBQ Sauce. One of the cons of this place is that it takes a long time to serve, but when the food does arrive, it's delicious. The Honey Mustard Sandwich was beautiful, you could taste the distinct sweet flavour of the honey set off by the tangy mustard. My friend loved his Ham Sandwich and the Chicken Burger came with oodles of chicken and cheese. The sandwiches were served with chips and the burger with fries. The highlight of the afternoon was the Chicken in BBQ Sauce. Soft, sweet and spicy, it was eight pieces full of beautiful flavours.
The cons of Wise Owl can be said to be the slow service and the fact that the dishes don't all arrive at the same time, so you will have to stare at your friend's face while she is eating her burger and you are waiting for your wings. Overall, a great experience. Value for money, will definitely visit again. Recommended!

Wise Owl has been one of the more hyped cafe in the region located in Purna Das Road, primarily due to its association with popular media..They have a delightful outdoor seating arrangement providing a beautiful ambience and the prefect mood for an evening snacks and a cup of coffee with your loved ones..Coming to the food they serve the usual American and European fare from Burgers and Sandwiches to Pizza and Pasta..Off late they have started a SteakHouse as well in the upper floor.. The service is quite pathetic to say the least..It was slow and lackluster and also they wont serve you water unless asked for..Quite dissappointing..Also the server himself was preparing the coffee as well as counting the Bills, adding to the poor service..Since we went in the evening, so we ordered:
Chicken Wings in Barbeque Sauce: 8 pieces of wings..It was way too crisp and over-fried basically..The wings have become sticky and hard and we had a tough time tearing those flesh out of the bones..the sauce was good,well balanced..
Chicken Arrosto: Basically two fillets of Chicken cooked in Rosemary Sauce served with Garlic Toast and Butter sauted veggies..Honestly the dish lacked innovation and flavours..the sauce lacked acidity..tasted a bit weird and the chicken fillets were also not cooked perfectly..again a bit dry..the Garlic Toasts were nice..
Overall I didn't notice any wow factor or uniqueness in the food served in the Cafe..there are tons of places serving similar recipes with much higher precision..Our total Cheque comes to Rs.640/-(incl tax) for 2..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 2/5
Ambiance: 4/5

Location:Purna Das road,opposite azad hind dhaba.

I started visiting this place with my friends from almost its inaugural time.The USP of this place to me has never been the food or the drinks but the unlimited time they offer you to hang out with your friends or closed ones.
The drinks in comparison were not costly & the food was okayish.I happened to visit this place on last sunday as well.I was greatly disappointed to see that even after the pujas they're handing out the puja spl menu which contained almost nothing.All our favourite dishes were gone except some finger foods,pasta & burgers.The drinks were also altered.The real disappointment however came when I saw that they were serving the coolers in plastic disposable glasses without bothering to garnish.Both the cola float & virgin mojito came in such glasses.Fried prawns as a side was not great either.
I don't know how long they can run this cafe if they're too contented with whatever & however they serve!

the best part is that they have an outdoor seating arrangement where you can smoke, a cherry on the cake during winters. tried out some of the drinks and ordered a plate of chicken wings and a plate of pasta in white sauce, it was  barbecued chicken wings, YUMMY! topping it up with good company  of friends and a pack of ciggerates! though being employed it still pinched my pocket as a plate of chicken wings costed around Rs.230 and a cooler around Rs.150, so yeah, best the time to visit is the day after salary gets credited. otherwise a good place to hang around when you feel like a sloth.

We went there on a festive day. The place was crowded and we waited for quite a long time. But as we entered, the ambience and the food worked the magic for us. The burgers were good & the fish fingers were surprisingly palatable. We 3 friends went there again during the 2015 durga puja. The other two loved the experience and thanked me later for recommending the place.

A very nice appropriate place for hangout place with friends. This place always buzzing with people from all kind of age groups. I came here with 2 of my friends as we were tired during our pandal hopping session and was rilli refreshed. Mostly ppl come here for chit chats over a  cup of coffee or tea. Likewise we were also not much hungry so we ordered a wise owl special coffee with 1 avalanche for 3 of us. The coffee was nice and creamy. And the avalanche was yummy as it was the combo of icecream,  brownie and wafers. Specially loved the decor as it had a huge kind of various shapes sizes and varieties of owls.Cool place for meet up,  hanging out and as they say loads of things over a  cup of coffee .

I ordered a cold coffee with ice cream, which took half an hour to come... When it finally did, it was not cold, room temperature and I had to send it back asking them to put some more ice in it...
I am still sitting here...  Waiting for the coffee... And it's been about half an hour... Never ever ever seen such shitty service...
And not to mention that the service people are incompetent and don't know how to talk well or understand orders...

Visited for the first time today. Had standard chicken burger with fries and coke. Burger was good. I felt that if you compare same with KFC, KFC scores, as it should have been chicken patty instead of chunks and size of burger should be slightly bigger as it vanishes in few bites. Loved the ambience and decor. I'll be back.

We went there while doing the Puja Shopping. The interior decor was quite cozy and reminded me of a coffee house. We both ordered the All-day breakfast platter, which came with Bacon, Sausages, Eggs, and French Fries. The bacon were quite thick and fried to perfection. So were the eggs. These were the 2 items which I liked best in the platter. The chicken sausages were also good, but not as good as the bacon. Another noteworthy thing was the price, which was reasonable enough to not be a strain in the wallet. We're quite content with our lunch, but I feel we barely have scratched the surface as far as the menu of the Wise Owl goes. I would definitely want to go there some other time.

The only thing which irritated me a bit there was the service, which was tediously slow.

Dropped in at The Wise Owl for a quick snack and was made to stand for about 30 minutes for a badly concocted Mojito, soggy French fries and Packaged Nachos. We sat outside in the patio and probably that is why it took the servers 45 minutes to prepare or food and reach our table(sarcasm intended). Not recommended at all. Do yourself a favour and and give this place a miss.

Went there for a quick snack with my mother. We ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and fish fingers. We also had an iced tea and a soft drink. What irritated me the most was when we entered we were welcomed by a strong smell of phenyl, not something I would want to smell while eating. The grilled sandwich was in need of some more filling. The fish finger was actually not too bad. Overall I wasn't too impressed.

Finally could drop at Wise Owl along with my wife on the 29th
of September 2015. Invoice number 15/1554.

Having spent over 30 years in the Hospitality Industry and returning
to Kolkata, we get very excited when a new outlet opens in the City opens, engaging
so many people, otherwise in a not so happening City in terms of Economics,
compared to other Metros.

 

Dishes ordered:

For my wife:

Grilled chicken sandwich with honey mustard dressing

Green apple soda

For me:

BLT

Cappuccino

 

Review:

My wife’s sandwich was absolutely cold. Grilled sandwich
cold? The bread was separately grilled and then some tasteless, dry, tough
chicken was put inside. Heard of grilling a sandwich this way? Ridiculous. When
complained, the waiter said that: “since we put cold things, sandwiches are
cold”. Excellent training. Rs. 200 plus taxes for that pathetic product. 

Soda was very weak.

I was very excited to have ordered BLT, which is one of my
favourite sandwiches. BLT is a toasted sandwich. But sadly what came in was a
plain cold sandwich. Under grilled bacon. Though I had requested for lean
bacon, what came was mostly fat. Tomatoes were cut not as sliced tomatoes but
as Carpaccio. Very little filling. Rs. 200 plus tax? This is cheating.. Coffee
tasted like burnt/over roasted, expired coffee. What was served in the name of
Cappuccino was actually Latte.

The restaurant clearly looked an amateur effort with
pathetic food and service. Minimum professional help would have done them good.
Small domestic bread?? Sandwich bread is minimum requirement with a choice of
bread. No cutlery on the table with food. Even the extra mustard that I
requested came without a spoon. Waiters chat amongst themselves without even
looking at the Guests. Tables and chairs require a good sprucing. No fries or slaw? Just wafers and Rs. 200 plus taxes?

Felt it was like any other Bengali enterprise, run by Ramu
and Hori of the World with no Customer connect or professional approach. Shabby
and dirty menus. It is like, “Aamra shob jani. Khabe to khao, noile bari jao.” Well,
was keen to visit the Steak House but Wise Owl, you have lost me and all my
friends and acquaintances. Sad, very sad.

At times due to non uniformity of staff uniforms..difficult to make out who is attending guests. Location is nice and ample parking space. Desserts are nice n fresh. Portion size needs to improve.

Whenever you go you will always find this place full of people of different age groups chatting over some delicious snacks.My personal favourite among the dishes are the fish and chips, salads, fish fingers etc. I always prefer the outside sitting area.The only negative aspect is that they are slow in serving our orders but that is all right when you are there to gossip with friends with a no so empty stomach ;-)

A quaint little place situated in Poornadas Road, Wise Owl is a place with various ups and downs. With a relaxed ambience and the privacy it offers on empty Friday afternoon, along with the rainy weather outside, it is a great place to catch up with a friend.

Soon after we were seated, we were approached by a man who seemed to be playing the role of cashier, host and waiter. Pausing for a moment to pity him, I proceeded to order french fries. The french fries were of an unappealing color, whatever taste it once had having disappeared during the extra time it had spent on the frying pan. Not crunchy enough to crackle, nor soggy enough to melt in ones mouth and too cold to make up for these flaws; these fried bites that usually put me in heaven were now reminiscent of a two star motel on an interstate highway.

Being a vegetarian, I was not offered much of a choice in the way of a main course, and after much pondering, I settled with an Asparagus and Spring Vegetables Risotto. After much waiting, and looking around questioningly, my food arrived. It may be helpful to note that although the risotto was well cooked and flavourful, there was only one 'spring vegetable'. The brocoli was fine but they seemed to have cheaped out on the asparagus, which is a real shame considering that this dish was really very good and had the potential to be so much better.

Along with my food, I ordered a Cold Coffee with Irish syrup. Many things can be said of this terrible concoction but for now it shall suffice to say that this 'drink' will give you a gift that keeps on giving - diabetes. The lemon ice tea I ordered afterwards was much better, although it lacked the sourness that ought to be present in a competent glass of what really is a very simple drink to make.

On the whole this café was okay for it's price but one should ensure they have no expectations of the food when visiting it.

First experience was terrible, they suggested burger for my kid which was extremely spicy. First they should know what to recommend,  not knowing  ur product  leads to bad customer service & worst customer  experience. Second time we had desserts for 800bucks . I find the place  overhyped typically some tollywood honcho enjoying a black coffee for hours. Not worth.

Quite Disappointed with their service speed. Very few staff members at your disposition. The food and the environment is not bad, But is shadowed by the slow service. Its very frustrating to wait for a long time when you are hungry. Hence I suggest they should get more staff and speed up the process!

Visited the place after close to 2 years. Found the quality of food has drastically deteriorated.  Prawn croquettes wrapped in bacon was my favourite but utterly disappointed now. Baked fish was just ok and the grilled fish just did not tickle our palate. 
In short, not to be recommended anymore...

Situated at the cheerful neighbourhood of Hindustan Park, Wise Owl, offers a great evening with a quirky ambience and great crowd. In addition to a smartly designed, well maintained and air conditioned interior, the place offers a traditional European styled open air seating arrangement mostly to delight the smokers. The restaurant is understaffed and therefore the service is slow. But it would not be a matter of concern if you intend to relax in such a great ambience along with friends. 

We ordered chicken steak with mashed potato and boneless lamb. It's not the best steak I ever had for sure. I was expecting something better as they were celebrating a steak festival the same week. The chicken seemed not fresh enough and hardened by over cooking. The pepper sauce and food decor were not able to make it up for its short comings. Interestingly there was a poach with the dish which was surely uncalled for. 

If you plan to visit, I will recommend this place more for its ambience than for its food.

I had heard quite a few people complaining about the quality of food served at the Wise Owl. So, when a friend of mine suggested we try this cafe today, I kept on urging him not to. However, in the end, since he kept insisting I finally gave the nod.

We had Virgin mojito, citrus cooler, chicken arrosto and baked fish. After a long time when our Mocktails were finally served we were quite taken aback by the similarity in appearance of both the mocktails. On closer examination we discovered that the only distinguishing factor between the two was that the Citrus cooler looked more cloudy than the mojito. As we took a sip of the mocktails we realised that we were tricked into spending 140 bucks each on a glass of Limca with just a lemon rind and a few mint leaves thrown carelessly in it (and by the way, neither the lemon nor the mint leaves were crushed into the drink. So the drink tasted no different than pure Limca).
Coming to the main course. Chicken Arrosto was okay. But the baked fish was a disaster. We were served raw fish that stank. On complaining, our baked fish was replaced by Grilled betki which though was not as bad as the previous item but wasn't good either. And yes, even this item had a faint stench. And the worst thing is that it left a horrible aftertaste.

We left the Cafe with a dissatisfied tummy, a huge burn in the pocket and an oath of never returning here ever again.

Located near cloakroom.. I always wanted to visit this place... A decent looking place nothing extra ordinary..

Today I visited this place around 4 in afternoon along with my besty.. However she dint really want to visit this place owing to some poor recent reviews about this place.. But I insisted her and visited this place.. My friend ordered a main course having chicken.. It was okayish..

To be really honest after seeing the reviews my friend showed me I decided to order two things that can never go wrong¬baked fish and Virgin mojito..

But wow they made sure that they serve me raw fish instead of baked fish.. I guess they should have this dish named raw fish in baked fish dip.. Then after complaining I was given a replacement grilled betki that was served an hour after the "so called baked fish" was taken away.. I don't know was it the aftershock of the dish they served earlier or not this grilled betki tasted equally bad and hence paid the bill without completing it.. The Virgin mohito was just a glass of sprite to be honest with some ice cubes

Service is worse than Street food stalls and you have to literally beg for water and menu card.. If you have loads of time and money to waste that's the only reason u can visit this place.. The service is so slow that u can watch one one and half hour English movie by the time they serve the food u have ordered..

Worst experience ever.. Won't visit this place even if someone else be paying for me..
Would have given zero but 1 is the least we can give on zomato

Let me just warn you all, this is not a place were you should come to have fast food. This is an ideal cafe and I am happy that it is in south kolkata. A leisure place were you can chat for long hours with food coming at their own pace. Nice decor with good service. And their avalanche made me quit exercise.

Slightly on the expensive side, this quaint little cafe steals hearts with its mouthwatering platters and quirky owl-ish decor!
Located in a quiet Hindustan Park lane, its one of the choicest places to be on an idle evening. Love the indoors, in spite of it being a little cramped and noisy. The outdoor is beautifully decorated as well!
I'm personally a big fan of their pizzas, fish and chips, sandwiches and shakes. 
Very filling, neatly served by courteous staff. However, the demerit is, the service takes quite a long time. What makes up for the delay is the young, vibrant atmosphere and the fact that the food tastes fresh.
A breakfast spread at Wise Owl would be a wise start.

A must visit for south Kolkatans, I would say. Highly recommended.

This review is based on only home delivery experience. Ordered home delivery nearby this restaurant few days back. They took the order at 6.30pm delivered at 7.30pm. The items were decided in consultation with them - Fish finger and Chicken Lasagna. There were six pieces of Fish Finger with tarter sauce and Chicken Lasagna with a slice of Bread. Fish finger was with very thin coat and done with Bhetki fish. The Lasagna was nice to taste with soft chicken chunks. Quantity wise Fish was good enough for two persons. Quantity of Lasagna was a little less than expectation. The bill came to Rs 601/-. Ok for this area though some might say it's a bit costly. On the whole a satisfying meal and recommend. Waiting to visit the place.

I had heard a lot about this place. So had high expectations. The food they served was stale. They did not even serve water. No one even bothers to bring you the menu card or take your order. After asking them repeatedly we managed to place the order. The steward suggested us to take bhetki. Finally when our grilled bhetki was served, it turned out to be totally rotten and smelly. The chicken was sour and tasteless. Overall it was a pretty bad experience. Regretted choosing this place over other newly opened restaurants in d city.

A little crowded over the weekends. Can improve on the service too. They need to bring in a bunch of friendly waiters/waitresses. 
Reasonably priced too. 
Hope they consider expanding to other parts of the cities soon.

Wise Owl is nowadays one of the most popular cafes in Hindusthan Park area. Located on Purna Das Road, following are the reasons why I find it very popular.1) Outdoor sitting arrangement - This is very popular as most of us love to smoke along with a cup of coffee. This facility scores over the very basic ambience. There is a larger indoor air-conditioned area that leads to the guest house.2) Food & Beverages - The food quality is pretty decent and the beverages are standard. The pricing is also at par other café in the area.3) Location - This is located at easy walking distance from Rashbehari Avenue (Gariahat), Golpark which has become a favourite weekend hangout place in South Calcutta. The locality is posh, quiet and tidy.This place always runs full and so the service takes a hit. The crowd is mostly decent and that sets a perfect stage for a great adda with friends. As everywhere, if a large group enjoys themselves, the ambience gets very noisy. Must visit place for those who like coffee, smoke and chicken lasagna.

A review from our jaundiced eyes is the last thing this place probably needs. A cloudy day, a light drizzle, maybe the dusk's sun peeking out to give a one last glimpse and alongside this, we have wise owl, or should I say, "The Wise Owl" The setting is a little quaintly Parisian street side cafe-ish. The food, is a welcome break. The meat lovers club sandwich is a god send. Drop in from 7:30 am - 12:00 noon and try their eggs to order and make one to your whims and fancies. It will be worth every bit, of your anticipation and also the cure of your early morning blues should in case you have one. Top it off with coffee or juice and you have the breakfast that keeps you kicking throughout the better part of the day. As an afterthought, try the pork sausages alongside that as well. Do visit the place but with time on your hands. Do not rush it up else you tend to destroy the appeal. 

P.S. I love the owl collection that they have.

This is one of the most happening restaurants in and around Southern Avenue and the footfall that they have for the whole day indirectly says a lot about the food that they serve and also of the service and the ambiance.
I have been to this place on numerous occasions and there are a number of dishes that I like. This likeness is so genuine that I would not visit any other place, but Wise Owl, if I am in the mood to have the same dishes.
I like the chicken ceaser salad that they serve. Chicken lasagnia is something to die for. God knows how the chef makes this dish with so much perfection.
Also, the chicken steak (pepper), chicken wings (BBQ), corn and cheese balls, the meat lovers club sandwich are my hot favorites. To complete a good meal, a cup of coffee is an absolute yes.

We've been to this joint twice - the first experience was not so good; the second was definitely a lot better. 

The first we were there as we were feeling like having a light dinner and ordered some sandwiches and a burger. The burger was extraordinarily spicy, the worst part being we were not informed of the same. As a result, my 8 year old could hardly have it since it was mainly for him.

The 2nd time was for a cup of coffee after dinner @ Kimli which was a lot better experience than the previous one. The coffee tasted good and the kids went for a Chocolate Mousse & a Strawberry Souffle, which, from the way they were enjoying, must've tasted good. 

So, a Happy Customer, finally.

The place was as usual packed with people but we somehow managed a seat and ordered for breakfast.

We ordered ham cheese sandwich,French fries,pork sausages,masala omlette,hot cafe mocha and hot chocolate.

The cafe mocha as usual tasted yum and the sandwich was packed with cheese.the omelette was soft and the other stuff tasted great as well.

Love this place that's why we keep coming back!!

We also tried their chicken lasagnia and tamed our taste buds wid pasta.
Grilled sandwiches come with chips!..worth to taste..
Its a bit overpriced..the service also a bit slow but since u would hav bn engrossed in some adda u cn definitely not count that out.

But quantity was not grt so we ordered one fish and chips. There were not too much crowds. But still we need to wait 55 min to get that fish and chips. In between that we have asked twicr that when we will get that but they were non responsive. Honestly this is the worst service I have received recently. I would suggest that if u wanna have steak then go to the steak factory.

The wise owl cafe is located in the quiter lanes of purna das road,just beside dell service centre.

It has both outdoor section allowing smokers, and an air conditioned inside.

Simple decor, with a glass panel ceiling lighting, simple chair tables,  big photos of coffee and coffee beans, and a pretty huge collection of various types of owls!

Food: I love my lemon iced tea most. Shakes and coffees are good.
Sandwiches come with chips.:)
French fries and other finger foods like chicken wings,pizzas are also pretty good.

Service: Unlike most cafes they take order from tables, and bills can be settled at table only, instead of going to the counter.
Service is good,often time taking though.

Prices: Reasonable

So, it was a mini school reunion & the place had to be special. We choose Wise Owl. It was my first time in there followed by N number of visits thereafter. Be it the Club sandwiches or the Pastas, or a sip of cappuccino or Cafe Latte, none will disappoint you. However i keep on suggesting all to not miss out on the Grilled Fish with Lemon Sauce and ohh definitely not the gateway to absolute Sin - Chocolate Avalanche! Yess the food is undoubtedly yum to the core but for me it is the ambiance that compels me to visit the place over and over... The inside AC arena is all well decorated, with the white walls and the effusive golden light showers welcome wishes.. The open air arena is equally appealing with the hide & seek of soft lights and dim darkness.

Went to Wise Owl a few weeks back with two of my friends. The ambience was quite pleasant and the crowd ranged between 18 to 80! We ordered the Chicken Tetrazzini, the BBQ Chicken Pizza and Chicken Arrosto. The tetrazzini was extremely good. I can say the same for the BBQ Chicken pizza as well. But i would suggest everyone to avoid ordering the Chicken Arrosto. Although the hint of rosemary in the sauce was exceptional, at a price of almost Rs.300, the dish,consisting of 4 pieces of bread and only 2 slivers of chicken, was not worth the money. The food at wise owl is good but their is no parity between the quantity of some of the dishes and the price range. Overall, it was on OK experience.

Wise Owl is extremely overpriced. 170 bucks for ham sandwiches?Seriously?I mean I would gladly pay  170 bucks if it's worth the taste or the quantity.But sadly,Wise Owl disappoints  on many such levels. No,I would not pay 170 bucks for just a slice of ham between two slices of bread. Same goes for the chicken sandwiches...bland. And don't even get me started on the chocolate avalanche. There's mousse,mousse and mousse underneath the brownies. And the quantity is really unacceptable compared to the price. Service is extremely slow.There is outdoor sitting and all.But that's it.There are places which offer way better food for way cheaper rates.

In a word - mediocre. It definitely has the location issue going on for it, and of course the whole outside seating which is also a smoking zone, but that's pretty much it. Sure you can sit there and chill with your friends for hours but that's only because the service is a tad bit slow, to say the least. And the food is pretty mediocre, given the fact that I would get a better version of most of the dishes at that price in quite a few other places. But hey, it's still a crowd puller, probably for the lack of a better option with the same set-up.

I don't know if I ordered the wrong dishes or the food isn't really that great. :3
Been there twice.
The first time was disappointing with the grilled chicken which was difficult to chew and the brownie which was crumbling down all by itself.
A very brave second visit didn't please me much as the honey mustard sandwiches were very plain and not at all worth the price.

I like the warm decor though.The outdoor seating arrangement is a plus point,so is the location.

If I ever go back,it'll be for cold coffee on a winter evening.Just that,just because of the ambience.

It is payback time for all those who had sat for hours in a cafe with only a coffee or a sandwich. Here one has to wait for hours to even get that single cup of coffee or a sandwich. The two times I visited, service was that slow.
Now over with the negative, the positive part is that, coffee and snacks are really good here. I like the complimentary cookies they serve with coffee. The pizza is also verrry tasty. On cooler days, or when one wants a smoke, the sit-out seems to be a better option than sitting inside.

I am quite in love with this place. Charming collection of owls aside, the food and ambience are a cut above many of the up-and-coming cafes scattered over south Kolkata. I absolutely adore the penne arrabiata and the veg lasagne. Sandwiches are pretty good too. But the caramel cappuchino makes the top of my list. As for the ambience, you would find a strangely mixed crowd here, from collegegoers having a smoke with friends, to lovers making sheeps' eyes over cups of coffee to old friends meeting after ages, to the lone office goer catching a bite while intent on his laptop. The only teensy downside is that the food takes a lot of time to prepare, although it is worth the wait.

I recently visited this place. This place is sort of next -gen adda stop like there was Coffee House for the last gen and when I say that I think I am giving it a lot. The variation of tea and snacks available here is totally awesome. The quality is great as well. The service is also something you won't complain about. The place also offers full course dining options as well. It has a open space outside to give a pure adda feel or one can also sit inside in the comfort of air conditioners. There's also a roof top seating space which I haven't been to but am sure it is a delightful place. A wonderful place to enjoy your time. Do visit.

A haunt so favourite that I might just sound patronising. The food is top of the line. The ambience invigorating. The staff near perfect. The cafe brims with genx  and her companions and is a perfect place for the  Bengali's timeless adda. Meat lovers sandwich, BLT sandwich are highly recommended. Their mocktales are something one should never miss. Even if just for a cup of coffee, do visit this place. Falling in love would be the only option.

One of my all time favorite places...the food, specifically the chicken steak, chicken Tetrazzini, sandwiches n the special cappuccino is just too good, very helpful staff n pretty easygoing on the pocket too!!
The ambience n interior is just amazingly cosy n comfortable...one can spend hours chatting here, watching life pass-by on the other side of the white picket fence!!! Being an avid owl lover, I simply go ga-ga over this place each n every time I visit this place.

Okkk..so here I am again doing one of my fav things...i.e. writing for the hobby which i love--->EATING!! I know..I know..its been 2 long years since I posted my last review but as the famous phrase which goes like..Better Late Than Never; I abide n I abide. So, Wise Owl - a place which stood as the 'Place of Proof' fr a gamut of memories in my life. A place serving good n pocket-friendly food (with good music and simple decor) in b/w friend's fights..sorting out differences among friend's and obviously lots of gup-shup.

Have been to this place a dozen of times and thanks to the almighty up above that the management of the cafe didn't throw us out as we use to remain as Cold as Ice!!

Loved the seating and overall atmosphere with the beautiful wall adornments and the entire owl themed decorations. The cappuccino, desserts and cakes were equally tasty. However, the pricing seemed to be slightly ott and could have been more competitive.

This afternoon a friend and I decided to go out for lunch and Wise Owl had been in the list of eateries I'd wanted to visit. Thus, we visited Wise Owl today. Located very well between triangular park and vivekananda park on Purna Das Road, Wise Owl is a neat cafe with options of indoor as well as outdoor seating. With dim lighting and a very simple decor the cafe is very inviting and has a soft touch to it.
The menu was pretty extensive and we initially wanted to go for cold coffee with ice cream and pizzas however to our amazement we we were told that both weren't available which is really sad and leaves a bad impression on the customer ( us for instance ).  Therefore dropping our first preference we decided to go for 2 chocolate shakes ( Rs 80 each ), a portion of chicken tetrazzini and a portion of fish and chips ( Rs 250 each ).
The chocolate shake, which was served within 7-8 minutes was very very chocolaty and tasted really good however i felt it was slightly sweeter than it should have been.
Then came the chicken tetrazzini. Well I've had the chicken tetrazzini at innumerable places here it was made just the way it's supposed to be, very cheesy ,creamy and super filling.
The fish and chips was good though not as good as the other food items we'd ordered. However I loved the tarter sauce served along with the fish and chips.
The pricing is good and the staff was very helpful when we had to place our order.
Overall a very good experience and hopefully would be visiting soon :)

Been there for a purely business meeting so honestly cannot speak much about the food there....only coffee it was.
What I can do most is talk about the ambience .
For a Friday evening post office hours considering people normally head towards a pub or a party for a glass or two this Lil coffee and snacking joint is doing pretty good..which got me thinking this purnadas road bistro is quite happening for the young and the old alike .
Since I had to wait for sometime I settled for a wise owl special cappacino. .. It was sweet creamy and thick enough to scoop it out with a spoon which was amusing since it gave me the feel of warm icecream the best part being it was not melting!
Coming to the profile of people visiting I found a group of young advertising professionals talking about an upcoming campaign in midst of screeching over the phone and smoking away like a chimney (they were on the open seating arrangement hence smoking allowed)
Next to me were two young entrepreneurs experiencing wise owl and christening their cafe which was to be born soon ( I over heard this was the 11 th or 12th cafe in the city they visited this week)
Then I found a lone man sitting with his black very elderly side bag vigorously scribbling something on his note pad...He looked like a 'shorkari chakure'.
All of them had one thing in common coffee..The only differentiating factor was it was either with or without milk with or without froth and with or without sugar.
The air conditioned section mostly had couples, friends, family who were there mostly to chat or catch up...With a plate of fries and the same meek cuppa!

Lets say I have not been to cafes much till I visited this place. My best friend introduced me to this place and I loved the place from the word go. 
It has a very good homely and nice ambience. The crowd is also good. I very much liked the open sitting arrangements. I totally like the ambience. 
Have been to this place a couple of times and it was good every time. Yes being such a popular cafe you will find it to be crowded sometimes in the evening. But the staffs are very helpful and cooperative unlike the nearby mrs. Magpies. 
The food here is good. We've had grilled fish, chicken wings and blue lagoon. The baked fish is awesome. Soft succulent fish dipped into creamy cheese sauce...complete yummmm!!

Food is quite delicious here, so are the drinks. The staff is also good but nowadays the only problem seems to be lack of seats. It is perpetually crowded over here. You are considered lucky if you find a seat there. While there is air conditioned indoors, I prefer the outdoors with its dim light and cozy feeling. Wish there were more seats there.

This place has become the popular hangout joint of South Calcutta. Located in one of the bylanes of Deshapriya Park, this place is not at all difficult to locate. If you are looking for a place to chill out over some coffee and nice decor around then Wise Owl is surely the place for you. It has both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements. The quality of food is above average.  However, the quantity of food is not enough compared to the prices they charge. Staffs are cordial too.

How about a cozy environment and loud sound of people and their conversations, chairs and tables and all things to give you a perfect sensational cliche of the nostalgic Coffee House from the north? Well, then its the "wisest" decision to come here for a visit. Personally, I prefer the coffee house of college street only when I visit that place, wouldn't wish to have one in South Calcutta. Keeping the price aside, the food was well served, from the aspect of time quality and taste. However, not all the items are as good as they seem while you surf through the menu card. One part I did not like about the cafe is its size, its a bit too small compared to the other cafes in the Southern Avenue area, however the overall ambience is nice if you can turn a deaf ear to the loud conversations from other tables.
In simple words, come, eat, leave. Don't laze around or wait. It wont be appealing to you or to others waiting outside for a seat. So! "no ullu(owl) banaoing" ;)

The friendly cozy neighbourhood cafe ! Wise owl has risen to be one of the best hangout spots of the city.
This is the ideal place for casual times with friends as well as over the coffee discussion with colleagues. Minute details are taken care of in their designing, like providing a power plug adjacent to more or less every table. The decor is simple yet pleasant, with an open air seating too. The recent development is the opening of the roof top steak house having a wide variety of tasty steaks! The food is tasty, if not over the top n the service is marked by an occasional delay !
Pros:
1. Located in a peaceful location, with enough parking area
2. Tasty n fresh food n bevarages
3. Ideal for business meetings as well as casual hangout
4. The steak house on the roof top is spacious, has some well prepared n tasty items on the menu.
5. Prices are moderate.
Cons :
1. Service could be a tad faster

Must try items :
1. Barbeque pork ribs (rooftop)
2. Brownie with ice cream n hot chocolate (rooftop)
3. Earl grey tea
4. There's one bacon sandwich too. Try that ;-)

I visited this place some months back and was satisfied with both the food and ambience...

7 mins walk from the Rashbehari Avenue Road, the place offers mouth watering delicacies ranging from sandwiches and burgers to Italian main course. 
I personally haven't tried anything from the breakfast menu...but heard that the non veg breakfast combo is quite good. For the health conscious guys...chicken Caesar salad is a good item to opt for. It is wholesome and fresh. We also ordered a Meat lovers  club sandwich and a chicken margaritta pizza both of which tasted good but nothing extraordinary as the filling / topping amount was not generous.

Among the finger food available, the prawn croquette wrapped in bacon should be mandatorily tried as we found it awesome. We also had chilli cheese toast and garlic bread.

If you are planning a visit here, don't miss out the chicken lasagne and chicken strogonoff these guys serve. The taste and flavour was marvellous.. same goes for chicken tetrazzini as well. The lasagne and tetrazzini comes with garlic bread while strogonoff is a rice dish.

As I have a crush for chocolates...I had an Avalanche for the dessert . This was a nice and a rich choco dessert.

The ambience of this place is cozy. You can sit inside or outside if you want to smoke. The only thing I didn't like was the serving time which was pretty much. Overall, it had always been a nice experience visiting this place and I would like to go back again soon.

I have been to the wise owl on many occasions only to be disappointed every time I go there. Recently, two friends and I went there for breakfast and were not very delighted. Firstly, the decor is average with six plan tables inside and a couple more outside as well. Barring a photo on the wall, there is no decorations in the place. We ordered a chicken and a cheese omelette with a side of toast and chocolate pancakes. For drinks, we ordered a hot chocolate, an iced café mocha, and a cappuccino. The pancakes to forever to come... We were practically done with the omelets before they came. The pancakes were too chewy and honestly difficult to swallow... The pancakes should be lighter and fluffier...less batter is required. Also the omelets were average, no better than the ones a have at home though I did like the fries and the grilled tomatoes. The cappuccino and mocha were good, but nothing exceptional. However, hot chocolate was very tasty ... Not too rich, but strong enough. 
The service was pathetic... They took forever to make the food and give the bill. All the waiters were in the back and there was no one to attend to us... We had to get up and call them to be attended too. 
The overall experience was quite poor. Except for the hot chocolate... There was not a single thing I found pleasing to drink/eat. The service MUST improve as well as the quality of the food (especially the pancakes). I hope to see them improve and grow as the restaurant has a lot of potential.

Located inside a guest house, Wise Owl is a pretty place to chill at. Though not too big It has an outdoor and indoor seating, which would be great when the weather cooperates. The place was full from the get go. The menu is pretty normal, nothing special about it. Appearance is a let down though. We ordered for a place of nachos and cola float. We were served a packet of Doritos with two types of dips. Prices are a bit on the higher side. Service is on the slower side. Good experience overall.

Nice little cafe on Purna Das Road, seems quite popular. Decor is okay types, nothing special to write about.
I'm not very happy with the service, waiters are well behaved but not attentive, they took half the order and forgot about the other half.
Fish & chips and baked fish with lemon butter sauce was good but portions are small considering the price. The citrus cooler was quite refreshing for a summer afternoon.
Overall its a good place but not value for money.

OK... I must admit that this was one place I had been wanting to try for quite sometime now and even after living really close to it I hadn't been there. Finally made the trip with a few friends for breakfast and it was heavenly!! The ambience coupled with the amazing combo breakfast is a must try! The bacon and sausages were great, as was the deceptively plain muffin (it was dark chocolate.. Not plain at all). All in all a great place for a quick breakfast get together

I simply love their decoration, right from the entrance. From outside, it looks like a small cottage and the predominant pieces of decorations are..'Owls' ofcourse. We( my bf and me) once just dropped by in the evening for a cup of coffee and some finger food to chat over. Even the thought of the Fish fingers, of this place makes my mouth all watery. They were delicious. We were not that hungry, so didnt try any other food. But the ambiance, they decoration, the fish fingers and the coffee has remained etched in my mind. Have visited just once, but I totally loved the place and also the name. I wonder,what could be the history behind the name!😊

Its ok if you go there in the evening sit down with your friends and chit chat over a coffee or sandwches. 
Main courses are a big no no.
Otherwise the service is very late dont know where were they so buzy . 
Interior work and the outdoor sitting arrangement gives it a look of the restraunts we find in abroad.

My first visit to Wise Owl,and it turned out to be a very disappointing one for me and my friends as it was my selection to take them for good food.The staff kept us waiting and there was nobody around to take our order. We ordered waldorf salad,chicken sandwich,chicken with honey mustard grilled sandwich,chicken salami sandwich, cold coffee with ice-cream,mocha cold coffee and potato wedges.Chicken & salami sandwich came together grilled yet served cold. Chicken was very dry. After 10 mins Cold coffee is served. Name says cold but served in room temperature. After calling one of the staff and asking him that we have ordered for cold coffee, he takes back the coffee comes back with same coffee but not cold. After 30 mins of waiting we were irritated about our food not being served. The server brought us food, but not what we ordered. Finally after 45 mins chicken grilled sandwich in honey mustard came grilled but served cold. Like it was grilled to perfection and was kept aside since the staff were so busy taking orders from other table and serving them. To my surprise a chicken steak to a neighbouring table was served in 5 mins of placing an order where our grilled chicken sandwich took a good 45 mins of preparation.Wise Owl should rename the dish (Cold) Grilled sandwich instead of Grilled sandwich. When we saw the waldorf salad we questioned the staff that this does not look like waldorf as they were no walnuts or fruits, they took it back only to come back and inform us that nuts are over and they could not serve waldorf. If this was the case, they should not have made us wait for 45 minutes. Last but not the least out of all this chaos still our potato wedges were awaited.When we decided to leave and pay at the counter the staff forces us to eat the wedges.Which we were sure would have been Cold as well.

A lot has been said about the place. Lets keep it crispy yet delightful. A sweet cosy peaceful and comfortable place with an equally tasty cuisine to add on. Nice place for taking out your date as well as meet some old friend and have a heartfelt gossip. I would not suggest a large crowd for a dining for the place is a bit small for that. Neverthless a spot to try out. Cheers

One of the popular cafes in southern avenue, wise owl has gained popularity through tollywood stars and T2 mostly. I went there 3 times with different groups, tried different things and hence can give a consolidated review. My pics are of the last visit.
Their burgers are really good, the cappuccino is good. They serve mash potatoes , vegetables and fries with almost everything!! Such a pro to me! The have extensive breakfast options and is a good place for breakfast. I had their scrambled eggs done to perfection.They serve cold coffee and it's variants. I prefer their irish coffee. I tried their nonveg french fries and it was just about okay. Prices are not college crowd goer friendly but can be afforded once in a while. Their outdoor seating arrangement is quite nice in winter. Their indoors are chilly and well arranged. The owl artifacts are cute and quirky.

If you have endless time to spare, then you can visit this place. It's a great place to spend a few hours. The decor is very stylish and has a very European feel to it. The ambiance of this place is great.

However, the service is extremely slow and waiting time was almost an hour. The food was also average.

So it is a decent cafe in the neighbourhood, where one can hang out with friends. But if you are hungry and looking for an eatery, I would suggest finding some other place.

This was my first time at Wise Owl and right away I really liked the ambiance and decor.
The food however, was another story. The lemon ice tea seemed like it had either soaked for too long or simply wasn't good tea. The ham streak burger had "shrunk" in size from the last time, according to my friend (it was his fourth visit). He ended up ordering a fish and chips as the burger just wasn't enough. The fish was nice but the fries were a bit too salty. The lasagne that I'd ordered came after my friend was halfway through his second order ( 45 mins). It was good, but I'm used having more than one layer of pasta in my lasagnes (personal preference).
All in all, not the worst food in the world. But would've liked it to be better considering the bill crossed Rs 1000 for two.

Perfect place for breakfast or an evening adda with friends. They have this open area, beautifully lighted and a perfect ambiance to go with friends and gossip over coffee, sandwich or the other snacks available. I always go for the mushroom maggie, chicken grilled sandwich, penne white sauce chicken pasta. Never go for burgers. They are not that great. The only issue is with their delivery service. They usually take a bit longer time to serve the orders.

The food is good, i won't say amazing though. The fish finger, pasta, fish and chips shld be specially mentioned! The breakfast menu is pretty good!
All and all this a place to be on a lazy weekend with friends.

Located in Hindustan Park almost opposite to Azad Hind Dhaba, this place is not that hard to find. 
It looks really nice and has a nice feeling to it. Both outside and inside. A good, old style cafe and well aired. Overall, a good place. 

We ordered Egg Cheese Sandwich and Cold Coffee with Ice Cream. The food is nice, they give a lot of chips along with it, so quantity wise it's good and enough for two normal people. The Sandwich could have been a bit more grilled and the ice cream in the coffee could have been a bit more, otherwise fair enough. The food is good. Would have been a 4 but. The delivery time. It takes a lot of time. Like seriously a lot of time. So 3.

If you want a nice new feeling type cafe, go for it. There's a good feel to it.

Had a lot of expectation from this place. However, my experience was a total disaster. Ambience is nice, service was quick and the pocket pinch was not worth it. Out of the foods we ordered, chicken coriander soup was too bad to taste, seafood risotto was yuck. Couldn't take it more than two spoons. Caramel custard was a grotesque. Only the crispy chicken fingers and chicken stroganoff tasted moderate along with sweet lime soda and mango shake. This place is good for hangouts and snacks but for lunch, its a big no-no :|

Well with Wise Owl, I have a very mixed reaction or rather a mixed opinion. It's a nice place for a casual hangout....a very chilled out and a relaxed atmosphere. I must admit one can take their sweet time and hangout for hours on end. The outdoor seating area is a bonus for smokers and for people who wanna watch the world by over a cuppa or a fresh lime soda. The food I must say is quite good and well made. I personally liked the grilled fish served with veggies on the side. Good quality basa fish well marinated and perfectly grilled. I also had golden fried prawns. The grilled chicken which my friend took that was also very well prepared. So the food wise things are quite good but can always be improved. But what needs to be seriously looked into is the service. It the pits. I mean I understand waiters butting in while guests are having a  conversation or standing in front of a table expecting an order without being called for. But that does not mean that no one would come at all at least for 20 mins to find out what the guests want. So one has to try his or her level best to attract attention and get hold of a waiter and place and order. The waiters aren't that well-versed with the menu or or they have problems communicating. So forget about getting good suggestions. Now once the order is placed getting the food on the table is another mammoth task. I know food takes time if it is cooked from fresh ingredients but taking 40/45 mins is just not on. 

It's really a pity that an eatery like Wise Owl with such a wonderful location and ambience and particularly, good food is in my opinion getting talked about like this only for the poor service. Its not at all difficult to train the waiters better so that we the guests can have a better experience. Its just for the service that I have given a 2.5. If that was upto the mark and the food was as good as it is now....I would have given a score of 3.5 So its time for the Wise Owl to get quite a bit WISER 😊

Been then many times for break fast or just for hangout with friends
The place is nice with very good ambience 
Seats are less so people visiting during peak hours might have to wait which can be frustrating 
Most of the time I order coffee along with club sandwiches or salad
Quality is good but dishes are very aggressively priced

Sunday morning. One rainy day. Sitting outside wise owl. Having meat lovers sandwich, sausages and filter coffee with a fag. Highly recommend atleast for breakfast. Although their main course menus are also good.

Decor: check, outdoor sitting: check, indoor sitting: check, coffee: awesome, overall: satisfactory.
If your lucky to get a seat outside, it is an awesome place for a coffee and fag with lots of intellectual thoughts brewing up in your mind. Just like the name suggests, it's a pretty cool place to hang bout with friends, or take your girlfriend/boyfriend out on a date.
The filter coffee (with separate milk) is one of favoured beverage, you can also try the wise owl special cappuccino. The cafe opens at 7.30 am and you can indulge yourself in a nice breakfast platter with pork sausages, bacon and double eggs (of your choice). For a light bite the nachos are delicious too. A real cool place to hang out.

Awesome place...
Price is a bit on the higher side but do believe me quality is like any thing and also quantity...
Like we ordered for a sandwich the price was Rs250 but quantity was enough for 2 people...
Moreover the Darjeeling tea had an awesome flavor and the cream on the Wise Owl special coffee was heavenly so as the coffee...
And about ambience it's very very good with both smoking and non smoking seats...

Pros:
1. Quaint little place at the end of a quiet street.
2. Innovative twist to the evergreen Maggi - garlic and ham.
3. Flavorful Masala Tea.

Cons:
1. Slow service - though might end up in the pro list for people looking to spend a long time.
2. Avoid filter coffee - too watery for my taste.
3. The double chocolate chip muffin was dry as a rock and burnt.
4. No bang for the buck.

WOW factor: Nope.
Will visit again: Mayhaps.

There is something really big about this small cafeteria that is located on Purna Das Road.
My first visit to this place was on a day when it rained so heavily that I was totally drenched.But it was complemented by the food I had in here and not to forget the great ambience of this place.
 
Wise Owl has a seating arrangement outdoors and indoors and is well decorated with lots of potted plants.The entrance is much like a heritage house in the posh area of Kolkata.

The coffee was simply excellent and we also loved the masala tea that was served to us.For food one can try some snacks like pasta.
Outdoors is a smoking zone.

This place is more of a sophisticated tea shop and is indeed the best place to be for hosting any discussions,gossiping with your old friends and having fun.You'll never know when time will pass by....

The first thing that is immensely attractive about this place is the decor. An open patio-esque space for the smokers and natural air aficionados, and a neatly designed air conditioned coffee lounge inside. Then you see the bright menu, stacked up with f&b choices. We weren't looking for anything heavy so ended up ordering nachos (with dips obviously) and chocolate avalanche( dessert) and yes, black coffee. 
Black coffee is a staple, no comments. Nachos, very good, especially the dips-salsa and cheese. But the winner? Chocolate avalanche! My god was it fabulous! I am not a chocolate fan myself but sort of forgot that for some good time. 
Nice place, seriously!

A more than satisfying experience, the place being very cosy and comfortable and the staff welcoming you with a smile. Perfect place for a date. The food is perfect and the prices are pocket friendly. I went to grab a quick bite after a movie so ordered nachos and a heavenly Chocolate Avalanche. God...it was mesmerizing. I was lost in that for quite a long time. It took a while to recover from all that chocolate and ice cream. A must try. :)

I've been to Wise Owl twice. First time I had cappuccino along with Chicken sandwich and on my second visit I had Fish and chips along with ham sandwich. My first experience was extremely good and that's the reason why I went back to the place second time. Fish and chips were really disappointing. Though both the pieces of fish were heavy and of good quality, it was not up to the mark. The fish had too much of oil inside and there was no good marination. It could have been prepared better. The ham sandwich that I ordered had too less of ham and cheese. It seemed a bad order though the chicken sandwich will be remembered. 

I recommend you to visit and explore the place & menu. It definitely has good dishes to offer. Keep eating!

A bit on the over rated side. This place is good for hanging out and having a cup of coffee and a few snacks. The atmosphere is pretty good and pleasing.

We had a ham sandwich but I would say, I've had better sandwiches at the same price in nearby places. The starter was known as Putino which was supposed to be a dish with fried potatoes and chicken. It was a bit high on the cost. When it came, it basically had a lot of fresh fries with a bit of Chicken in some sauce on it. The taste wasn't bad but doesn't deserve to be that costly. We had a fruit punch which was mostly nothing but simple mixed fruit juice and a lime drink which was actually amazing with mint leaves. Our main course had another "pan fried" chicken item in some sauce but the sad part is, it wasn't at all pan fried but simply cooked.

The food is good but the rates should be considered.

I have passed by this coffee shop for a number of times but never entered. This afternoon, we had planned for lunch somewhere outside and the restaurant we chose is closed on Monday and this was near by. So we just walked in. Well, the ambience, the decor everything is beautiful over here except for service. People who have plenty of time to waste by gossiping generally visit here. So if you just wanna grab something and leave, then it's a big no no. We were in a hurry and the staffs paid no attention to our repeated requests to hurry up, take the order and serve us the food. But the food was really good and so was the coffee. At first, we had ordered a plate of bacon rashers and chilli garlic maggi with ham. Both of them were really good. You can try out the new recipe of maggi at home too! It's really simple. The same recipe with added chilli flakes and ham. But it was yummy. For the main course, we took a plate of prawn paprika risotto. The bell pepper rice had a beautiful smell which I liked very much. Even the prawn gravy was spicy and just totally yum! In the dessert section, I ordered for an avalanche, which is actually enoromous in size. I think one avalanche is enough for three adults. And the americano that my friend ordered, he said that it was good although. The outdoor seating arrangement is very romantic. But on a sultry day you would prefer to sit in an air conditioned room. But on a rainy day, or in winters, that would provide a perfect coffee date to you and your partner. Everything is fine at Wise Owl except for the prompt service of their staffs. You can have a look over it once. But make sure you have enough time to spend there. Happy Dining! :)

His place epitomizes the Bengali slooow pace and general dislike of any sort of efficiency! Cute outdoor seating was a draw, but the bad service made sure it's not a place to frequent. 2 coffees ( decent) and a chili garlic ham maggi ( nice and homely) took over 45 mins to serve. You have to try very hard to catch attention of the waiters and get any sort of service. If you're looking for a place to just hangout for hours where no one will pay any attention, this is it.

in Kolkata for six months on deputation.being from a software biggie,have already made lots of friends and being a serious foodie have started visiting eateries and cafes around south kolkata where i stay.Well this cafe which i heard a lot about is a serious disappointment.first of all the ambience.the inside is nice but being summer there were very few seats available.the outer seating seemed like a breeding ground of flies and mosquitoes.on top of that the waiter could find time only after half an hour to visit our table all the while we were blasted with cigarette smoke by a gentleman.now i have no clue why a cafe should have italian menu but the lasagna and maggies all tasted stale and were cold when served.the coffee was cold and it was not cold coffee.and the waiter tried to convince us that he is right and we are wrong.eminently forgettable experience and if this is kolkatas idea of a good cafe then they should see the joints we have in mumbai and hyderabad.avoid

I visit the place almost twice a week and I can never have enough of that white picket fence , those potted plants and the infectious friendly buzz of conversations going on around . They have an impressive menu as well … I particularly like their Egg Cheese Sandwich and I recently tried their Chicken Steak which was pretty good as well . The staff are amazingly friendly and the pocket pinch is not very big either . So if you still have not had your sip of awesomeness … make sure you visit Wise owl next time around 

This picturesque little cafe in purna das road is located almost opposite to the Azad Hind Dhaba. They have arrangements for both outdoor and indoor seating and one of the best things about this place is probably their background music ( coldplay, one republic and celine dion features in their playlist! ). We were served cold coffee with cream, egg and cheese sandwiches and all day breakfast platter with bacon, fried eggs, sausages and french fries...pretty decent food and generous proportions were given. Later we helped ourselves to fried chicken with bacon wrap and chicken wonderland( chicken cubes and pork sausages) which I didn't find quite remarkable. The service was prompt even though the place was crowded when we went there in the evening. Definitely worth a second visit!

I had a nice Saturday breakfast here. It's a bustling morning place and had good vibe. I specifically liked the hazelnut cappuccino. Tried beans on toast for breakfast which was pretty average. My friend seemed to be pretty happy with his omelette. The place had only one employee, who was cooking and serving the food – this made our breakfast go extra slow and we had to restrain from ordering a dessert in order to save time. Nice place to hang out.

This place, although has grown to be very popular within a very short time, has its share of problems with respect to popularity...the management needs to notch up the service level...the waiters are very few in number, negligible compared the quantum of crowd...and thus service takes a heavy beating...and secondly, although the cafe has minimum control on public civic sense, they should politely request any customer to tone their volume of vocal cord..people who come here mostly comprises youth and its sad, that they dont care about others and shout and laugh and chat taking the cafe for granted to be their drawing room...it causes major disturbance tp the people who goes to the cafe to have a good time and not to listen to other girls' boyfriends and loud blabbering...this cafe is surely becoming a pain

I've heard so much about this place...but I was so disappointed. The food takes ages...and I mean AGES to come my golden fried prawns took half an hour to come and the pasta took another half hour. The food isn't that great either. I remember ordering a mouse which was so small it came in a shot glass...it wasn't cheap either...not much value for money. The only upside I found to this place was the outside sitting area which I found cozy, with a book and a cup of coffee...it's quite nice...but overall I would have really liked the food to have come earlier.

Had heard a lot about this place, and researched a bit on the internet before visiting it. However, I was a tad bit disappointed, the moment I saw that the decor was a bit different than what was expected (The owl motif on the outer wall has vanished). Nonetheless, cheerful (but overworked) staff, and variety on the menu was something I liked. The food seemed over-priced, and the 'grilled chicken and honey mustard sandwich' was not something extra-ordinary. Overall, a pleasant place to hang out with friends, only if you don't mind spending on over-priced coffee and savouries.

I'd be a little biased and rate this place a little higher than how I'd usually rate, and that's because they let me laze around as long as I want and do not bother me even when there are people waiting! I've only had titbits here n I particularly love the wise owl special cappuccino and the cheese maggi they make! Waiting time is a bit too much and the waiters undertrained, agreed...but again there's something about this cozy corner which makes it my no.1 place to hang out with friends! Plus, I always bump into someone I know :-)

While a popular spot, the service and food doesn't live up to the hype. On top of being understaffed, the staff is under-trained! After 20 minutes of already placing our order with one server, we are approached by a different one and are, to our horror, told that the first server never took our order down. What follows is another 30 minute wait (for 3 Cold Coffees, 1 Maggi, 1 Pasta & 1 French Fries) and then, below-average food & no French Fries!

The service is poor and the staff is so laid back that they take a hell lot of time to serve an order as simple as that of double expresso coffee shot. The ambience is good enough. Talking about the food some of them are good but are overpriced!!

Its opposite to azad hind on purna das road.
Someone suggested me it serves great maggi..however maggi was true disaster. Penne pasta were good and cold coffee was very nice. 
However, this place has major issue with its service. Its too slow. Even if you have lot of time but its annoying to keep waiting after placing the order! You are not served maggi for 30mins..(where it claims to be ready in 2mins)
We canceled our order aftr that they are serving it. Water to 10mins to be served
Service and staff needs to be worked on!

Listen 1st things 1st. If you plan to visit Wise Owl in near future for a quick bite...remember the staff does not belive in the term quick and emphasize on the word  'forever' ! So you should have enough time in your hand. Now sitting is neat.. have outdoor tables also for smokers. Food is alright, nothing special to mention. Yeah, that should all about Wise Owl.

Good location - a good place to hang out. Lazy service - either you have to plead or shout to get your order taken. A nice outside seating arrangement. But all said and done, personally I always rate a place with the majority of the points reserved for the food quality - and that's where they fail big time. Very average food and poor value for money considering the pricing. They failed in the taste of flavored tea, in the salads and grilled chicken which unfortunately turned out to be a riot of salt.
No matter how good the ambience or location is, if the food is not good, nothing is.

Nice little cafe cum food joint...cozy ambience...you could spend hours gossiping and nibbling on food in this place. Food is very good....I would specially like to mention the dish, fish in lemon butter sauce which we had ordered....it was simply lip smacking. The staff is very cordial. The only let down to this place is the service....it's very slow. Evn the simplest of dishes takes hours to serve....Apart from this,good food,good ambience etc....definitely makes it a place to visit...

Visited the establishment with fellow zoman @Petal. To describe the place "Over-hyped." Alright-ish staff behaviour. Takes too long to serve. Yes even with simple orders like a cold coffee and blue lagoon. They take way too long even after considering the settle in time. The crockery was bad maybe they made a conscious decision to keep it so but on a personal opinion if I am paying 90bucks for a cold coffee I would definelty like to get served in something other then the glass they use at indian coffee House to serve you water with. Maybe there selection of music was the only good thing.

Unique decor in spite of having a small cafe kind of set up has made the place look cosy special and classy. Food is little more than average and the inside seating area is too loud at times. This place was in my wish list for long and meeting a very good friend has made the place even more special.

Located in the innermost interior of purna Das road this small street side cafe boast of a small interior although outside sitting arrangements are there.... mainly the food is average..the sandwiches are just average stuff..and the main course is also ok..not so extraordinary...and lastly the deserts are not so good...except the same old brownies with ice cream which is available everywhere....and the most important.. foremost thing about any eateries is their service...which is not at all good..the staffs throw their attitude around everywhere..and the food is also served delayed.The ambience is also very bad as it is very loud and the general crowd is also like that...so 2 sum it up...I can suggest it only once..u give it a try..If u have the urge to believe the hype about it!!

Finally,a cafe that lives up to its name.
Nice ambience if you decide to have a seat on the outside and have a mix of the weather and the street view while you enjoy your food.
The inside is great too.
Their continental is great.
Try the Spaghetti carbonara and grilled chicken with mushroom sauce.
Also,the prawn croquette wrapped in bacon is great(though a bit salty at times).
The only downside to this beautiful cafe is that they are low on the number of waiters who tend the tables and take orders. Thus orders take a while to arrive.
Oh,and if you're a fan of owls,you will find yourself admiring their collection of owl miniatures.
Bottom line is,this is a great cafe.

The chicken chilli garlic maggie and coffee was my all time favorite. Quick and filling...when you really hungry post shopping ;)
The service and the staffs are friendly and the a separate smoking zone is there...

An ideal place for a breakfast meeting with co-workers on a holiday or general hanging out for long hours of an evening. The outdoor seating and the airconditioning inside are equally comfortable. The place opens really early. Try the different types of maggi there on a lazy Sunday morning and you're bound to go back to your night/morning canteen days back at college!

English boutique eatery ambiance with a good collection of owl miniatures. However food menu is a little more towards breakfast and evening snacks. guys, if you are looking for a four course lunch or dinner, wisely skip this one. Tried almost 6-7 items which includes cold sandwich,  beacon, breakfast platter etc. The top ranker would be: mushroom cheese bread. this one cost cheaper than the others but is a splendid one to try. service very slow (at least 20 mins of service time in an avg). Can be definitely tried again..!!

A great place to hang out with friends .I've visited this place for quite a few number of times now and is highly captivated by the Avalanche here ( a must try for all the chocoholics like me). Though the chicken burger could not serve my taste buds that much.The food is good but the service is not that great. I would like to get provided with a better service on my next visit . Overall a nice place for light eat. :)

I like this joint. Though it is small but it has a character of its own. The ambience is nothing great but is simple and has comfortable feel and allows you to have a small conversation with friends and family. 
Food taste is very nice. My personal recommendation is onion garlic Maggi , which any Maggi lover cannot miss. 
Even lasagne is nice. 
It's a good place for breakfast also as you get all English options and taste is too the perfect possible.

While roaming around in hindustan park areas suddenly we bumped into this place. This place was in my wish list for long after reading lots of positive reviews. She was happy with the ambiance. The restaurant has both indoor and out door sitting arrangement. Looked like a typical high end coffee shop. As it was quite cold that evening , we decide to seat indoor. Interior is nicely done and she liked the collection of owls. The menu offerred wide range of options. Overwhelmed by the options available , we ordered soup and some finger food instead of coffee. May be thats the mistake. It took very to have hour order served.The biggest disappointment was that the soup was served cold. When requested to re-heat it , the waiter was courteous enough to agree but again it we had to wait for almost 20 minutes. By then we were in no mood to have the soup. We canceled order and came out of the caffe without having anything. As some other reviewer mentioned before, may be this place is good if you have lots of time to kill. Overall, we liked the place but first date with Wise Owl was not memorable. But being positive mind , we would definitely like to have a second date !!

A cafe with a beautiful location. Away from the crowd, this place offers a wide range of finger food, good variety of bevarages and some quality continental food. This place is famous for its out door sitting. A well decorated cafe, with a hospitable atmosphere one can enjoy good cups of coffee. Also famous for its breakfast, Wise Owl offers quiet a spread. Deserts are a thing they started recently. Worth trying foods are mushroom on toast, chicken wings, club sandwiches, masala tea, cold coffee and the ice cream truffles, pastas and their rice dishes. The prices are a bit on the higher side, but the quality of food and ambience makes the visit worthy. A great place to hang out with friends, away from the busy streets of gariahat, this place offers quality relaxation.

Great ambiance, good food will always cheer you up. the coffees are great. Better than those served at many of the cafes existing elsewhere in the city. Although didn't get a chance to dig into a variety of stuff on the menu, plan to do so very soon indeed. the outside sitting arrangements seemed to be an added attractions where you can even smoke while sipping a cup of hot expresso. Coffees and cigarettes anyone? :P Go visit the place if you haven't yet :D

Wise Owl is here in the culinary business to stay and rise high. Went with a friend to try this place out and after trying a spoonful of the first dish we agreed that we had made the right call by opting for this eatery. Initially our order was the grilled basa fish and chicken lasagna but we chose to go with the manager's suggestion and dropped the basa and instead went for the "Today's special menu" Grilled Bhetki, chalked on the black board. The service was slow paced but the quick witted manager compensated the service with his impressive managerial skills.
No sooner did the food arrive at our table we picked our gears and digged right in. The Bhetki was smooth as silk and it melted in my mouth. It was truly a party in my mouth. Loved it to the core. On the other hand the chicken lasagna failed to compete with it's contemporary. I was hoping for a lill more sauce and a slightly richer flavor, but nevertheless the dish as a whole was good if not awesome. Generous portion was served and the presentation was delightful.
Ambience is good and if you happen to be an owl lover, this place is heaven for you. Almost everywhere u can lay your eyes on you will find an owl (artificial, thank God) staring right back at you :P
Hope to return very soon and try the other delicacies.

The quality of the food has improved aswl thus justifying the price hike.
The New Menu has variety and good options
Always loved the ambiance.

We had Fish Finger, Wise Owl special Coffee & Citrus Cooler.
Fish Finger :: they serve you 6 succulent pieces ,where the crumbs are finely fried with amble amount stuffed fish inside and the dip provide went well with the dish and the amount provided was good enough aswl.
Wise Owl Special Coffee:: A must try for all coffee lovers,easly on the palate & rich in cream is something I prefer where the beans aren't too sour.
Citrus Cooler:: The mixture of ginger ale and chopped mint does give this drink a real neat cooler in reality. Easy on the taste buds and soothing to taste.

Everyone has gone crazy about going to this place after seeing Parambrata here in Chotuskon , so had my friend and so we went here the day before christmas. The location is perfect , not on the main gariahat road and not too far from it.
Nice place to go with friends , they hve both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. 
The people serving are very polite and civil . The price of food here is just a bit too much even for the quality they serve , it will burn a whole in your pocket. We ordered a chicken tetrazzini and a chicken stroganoff . The food arrived very very late . We even heard another customer complaining about it to the manager. The food was very good and served hot . I loved the chicken tetrazzini but had to sprinkle a lot of chilli flakes on the stroganoff.
The ambience is nice and friendly .

After getting inspiration from numerous food reviews me and my 2 bffs decided to visit Wise Owl on an early winter morning for a breakfast meet up. The first impression was good since the decorations and the sitting arrangements specially the open air set up were welcoming and homely. We ordered 3 combo breakfasts. They ordered fruit juice and I went for coffee along with it. However we had to literally hunt for a waiter since probably the staff were oblivious to the fact that there might be customers sitting outside. Anyway the order was finally placed and though the delivery was quite slow, it didn't quite affect us since we had time to sit and relax. Its would be wise to bunk a wise owl visit if you are in a hurry. The food was not very much up to the mark. The milk and cornflakes was not very interesting and could easily be improvised with a little added fruit. The smoked ham was good although the quantity was not satisfactory. Same with the chicken sausages which were just 2 sticks of regular sausages sliced and fried. The scrambled eggs were tasteless and had no salt it them. The pepper container was also empty..so disappointment there too.. The final shocker came when we realised that the muffins were not fresh and had gone bitter on the sides. A food joint serving breakfast should always take care so that no food which is kept overnight is served. We had to leave the muffins uneaten. After all these fiascos a check of almost 1 grand is nothing less that crushing. I had a lot of expectations from thus place and I suppose the credit can only be given to the atmosphere of the restaurant. .Definitely not the food.. although the main course dishes need to be verified before any more comment is made.

Wise Owl is one of those joints one goes to hangout with friends. But make sure you have a LOT of time at hand as the food takes quite a bit of time to travel from the kitchen to your table.

This quaint cafe has a couple of things going for it - tucked away in a quiet corner of a well-known neighbourhood, with rather kitschy yet charming decor and having both indoor&outdoor seating arrangements, it scores high on the ambience card. The food too, thankfully, is pretty good, especially the melt-in-your-mouth baked fish and the delicious grilled chicken. Their bell pepper rice though, could be much better. The service here is an issue. Excruciatingly slow, be prepared to be met with apologetic grins for your impatient twiddling thumbs. Wise Owl is meant for whiling away time, and sometimes with food for company, that could be a welcome thing.

2. Cajun mushroom- amazing in tasre too
3. Caeser salad - i wud recommend to not to go for this one as they cudnt make it properly...neither did they use any caeser dressing. So its not good at all.
4. Fish n chips -fish is very fresh and crispy. Nice to have it.
5. Chocolate sundae - this is good too.
So as a whole I wud rate this as a nice hang out and recommend everyone to try the brunch or lunch at this joint.

As they say necessity is the mother of invention... All that was missing in south Calcutta is a place for Sunday brunch. If you are the lazy kind for whom the winter morning actually rolls into the afternoon Wise Owl is the place to be. Get up late and and as you stroll and land up at this cozy joint you still feel at home. A wide spread of Sunday brunch along with host of continental offerings along with an array of different types of MAGGI! Yes Maggi in a restaurant and it's worth it. Few items from the spread worth mentioning - Cheese and bacon omelette, grilled chicken honey and mustard sandwich , pork sausage salad (an item that I only get here and savour every bit of it) corn cheese balls. Follow this up with a coffee or an earl grey and your day starts looking brighter already. It is important to note that the cost involved is much less when compared to the breakfast/ brunch options at park street. The only thing that I feel missing is probably a few more attendants.

One of the best place to hang around with friends. But there is a problem with service. They will make you wait untill and unless you follow up with them for food. Preferable sitting outside.. food is good..

Searching for a place to have a peaceful time with your best friend or other half ? The perfect cafe indeed. One must try the white sauce pasta and meat lovers sandwich. The chicken fingers though very less in quantity are worth a try. :)
Happy eating!

The pretty lil cafe on the road, Wise Owl did not live up to my expectations.  While the decor and sitting arrangement outside is petite, the service is excruciatingly slow.   However, they do make some nice pasta in white sauce and ham sandwiches. The seafood salad is a big disappointment as the only bit of seafood it contains a very few prawns. Their beverages border on the level of being OK.  Visit the place if you have a nice book to read while snoozing in the sun or if you have a lot of work at hand.

: I'm bored. And hungry. Want a cozy place.
: Wise Owl!

Yes, that is exactly the conversation which would end my friend (s) and me in Wise Owl.
We have been to this place a lot, and never have we come out without a smile. The simple yet sophisticated interiors with pretty owls here and there, plus the quaint little seating area outside makes it a really pretty place to spend time with your friends and loved ones.
Food prices is a wee bit on the higher side, but everything out here is delicious. Yes. Of all the dishes I have tried yet, none has let me down. Especially the Chicken Wings (i chose BBQ sauce) and the pizzas.
Equally good are the shakes and mocktails available, the chocolate shake being a sinful delight followed by the Cranberry Lemonade Cooler perfect in a hot summer afternoon.

Sometimes the number of people attending to the guests are quite less, resulting in a slow service occasionally. However, they are extremely polite and courteous.

Do visit Wise Owl; you will love it. :)

I got its reference from the movie 'Chotushkone', where Parambrata was selling a brief of his fake movie script to a producer. I was really amazed to see that such cafes really exist in our city. So I visited Wise Owl with my friend Pallavi. Well it was not upto my expectations. Food was expensive, ambience was good, people were nice, lighting was perfect, and location was cool. I had chicken ceaser salad. It was not so good. But I wanna visit it again..I feel it still has more to offer.

I went with my mom and sister and sat just next to the muffin counter/their mini kitchen. We ordered coffee and muffins, coffee tasted great but came after about an hour and half of sitting and chit chatting. muffins came along. when we ordered another muffin, they got it so warm that it was unbreakable! then they told they would replace it. We were tired sitting for a muffin and even my mom desperately calling for it many times (sitting next to the counter helped) it was when I woke up and asked for check that they served muffin.  They have a really bad management skill and service ! I would only go there when I have to hangout with my boyfriend and so I can sit there for the entire day looking into his eyes :)

Went to this place a couple of months back.  Was sitting in the verandah with a friend, and it felt like the place was handled by tortoises. We had to send the security guards inside to call someone to take our orders atleast 4-5 times. Then it took another couple of minutes for the Captain to finally arrive and take our order. We had ordered a chocolate avalanche, which compensated for the ultra slow service speed. Moreover, the ambience was fairly pleasant. I am not a regular at this place, so I don't know if this is generally how long they take to come and take orders and thereafter serve food. If yes, then I'm certainly not going back to this place, even when the choco avalanche beckons me in my dreams!

Been there last weekend with a friend for a quick bite. To start with the place is nice, even though not huge but had enough space to get some privacy.

We ordered fish fingers and yummy egg burger. The service was good and the person serving us was quite efficient.
The food was just awesome. Fish fingers were filling and the burger was really tasty. The fries with the burgers added to the taste.
Only thing worrying would be the price, which can definitely go down a bit. But over and above a very nice experience. Definitely coming back soon.

Fish and chips became a stock meal among the working classes in the United Kingdom as a consequence of the rapid development of trawl fishing in the North Sea, and the development of railways which connected the ports to major industrial cities during the second half of the 19th century, which meant that fresh fish could be rapidly transported to the heavily populated areas. Deep-fried fish was first introduced into Britain during the 16th century by Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain, and is derived from pescado frito. In 1860, the first fish and chip shop was opened in London. 
Wise Owl serves nice portion of the traditional fish n chips.

Wise owl...so picturesque in the White, the little lights and the one prominent tree. One of finest decor I have seen in this city, really captures the coffee shop hue. Coffee smells all around and cold coffees are quite refreshing. Else I ordered for spicy chicken fingers and they were SPICY!! Best for conversation and you can smoke if you're sitting out. Long addas is the defining feature here. Winter is finally here!! The service is awful at peek times, and slow like crazy.

Went into this place to have coffee while walking along Purna Das Road. The cafe mocha that was served was excessively sweet, almost seemed as if it had been prepared with jaggery. On mentioning this to the cafe manager, I received an immensely arrogant reply which went something like this - "Want to have a cafe mocha and don't want it sweet? There's coffee, rich cream and chocolate syrup that goes into it and you expect it not to be sweet?" Seemed as if a crime had just been committed by questioning the sweetness of the coffee! My craving for coffee vanished instantly and I left after a few more sips of the jaggery-sweet concoction that was made to pass as coffee. I will never visit this place again and strictly recommend people to stay away as well. Maybe I will reconsider some day, in the distant future, after these guys have learned the ABC of customer service! Happy ill-treating-customers till then!

It's the warm feel of the place that takes people back to this "adda joint". Easy to locate and with space to park your car, Wise Owl isn't a bad option.
But a cafe should be and should be reviewed mainly for its food and service. And this is where they fail!
I have been here several times and therefore the review comes after several sad experiences. While some of the items from the menu, like sandwiches and pastas aren't that bad, but there are hundreds of cafes which make them way better. Stay away from the Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce. First the portion is not enough for one, and second there's hardly any lemon butter sauce. And even if you inform the staff about it, they are too complacent to take some action.
Now coming to the service, you need to plead the staff to take the order since half the time they are too lost! even if you have all the time in the world, there slow service will beat your patience.
For the price you need to pay at the Wise Owl, it's a wiser decision to visit some other cafe :)

located at purna das road, opposite to azad hind dhaba, it's fairly easy to locate. parking is available in front of the restaurant, on the main road.
they have some tables outside the main restaurant just off the pavement, which is perfect for having 'adda' with your friends over sandwiches and the main seating area is inside with more tables. take your pick :)
we went in for a sunday breakfast and straight away ordered the combo non-veg breakfast. however, that was not available. so, we ordered the à-la-carte way - grilled chicken sandwich with honey mustard, meat lovers' club sandwich, masala omelette, bacon and bread and cappuccino, cafe latte. next, the 5 poor hungry souls were kept waiting for around 30mins. anyway, sandwiches were nice, per service had 4 sandwiches with potato chips. omelette came with french fries. coffee was decent, you can add your preferable sugar (brown/regular/sugar-free) separately. bacon came with honey mustard sauce, but didn't come with the bread. the bread came when we have already completed our food, so had to cancel it. overall, food quality was decent, also was value for money considering the quantity.
service had scope for improvement. they took 10+ minutes to come and provide a menu. and 30+ minutes for serving the food. and, that too on a sunday morning when the restaurant was only half filled.
decor and interior looked cool..probably in the evening they would have better ambiance..i liked its outside seating..very convenient for a quick bite during the winters.

There are Cafe Mocha makes my heart song with bliss while the salads are something to die for.

Perhaps I'd like to start with the ambience of the place  since it pleased me more than the food. The outdoor setting is welcoming and quite affable. As far as the service- it was good, but the fact of the matter is I went for breakfast and the place was practically empty; so maybe I got everything on time. Staff were friendly. 
Coming to the food, ordered: 
> Chicken burger- which was good, juicy and had a gravy like filling of chicken as opposed to the conventional patty style burger.
> Fish n Chips- the chips tastes better than than the fish, the fish was bland- no flavour or seasoning per se. 
> lemon ice tea- was more like fanta, highly disappointed as I know very well how an iced tea ought to be; probably because I have it everyday. 
> cold coffee- was good but nothing great. 

Overall I'd say the place is nice to have a good conversation and good company, food is somewhat okayish.. But can't complain much. Cheers. ;)

Wise Owl. There is something about this place that will really please you! The food is good. Nothing extraordinary. The ambiance is what brings me to this place. Just one of those locations where you can just go, sit and spend hours over some snacks. I wouldn't say the service is extraordinary, but its okay. The service time did not please me. You do have to wait for quite some time before you get your food. Whether you sit outside or inside, there's a feel-good factor prevailing around! 

Personally I love Wise Owl and would definitely recommend it.

Wise Owl is not a wise choice to try out good food, though I happen to like the place very much. If you are hanging out with friends over light snacks and coffee then nothing comes close to this place. It takes them ages to serve your order, more delayed than the Indian Coffee House, if you have been there that is. i quite enjoyed my lunch spread of chicken stroganoff and fresh lime.

Well i have visited this coffee shop around half a dozen times for now. I won't say that it was just the sheer taste and cuisine that kept bringing me back but it was rather the convenient location which had a major impact. Wise Owl is quite a popular name around here specially in this southern part. The decor of the place is moderate. They have both interior and open air sitting arrangement. But after trying their offerings i cannot say that i am thoroughly impressed,  the hypes regarding this outlet turnes out to be quite blank. The service is pathetically slow. Though there are some of the dishes which are quite succumbing and worth mentioning such as their "bacon wrapped prawns","coleslaw sandwich" etc. But along with that few dishes like "chicken wings" with which i had quite a nasty experience(too oily and excessively and unecessarily deep fried). The beverages offered are average. Few like caramel coffee and hot chocolate were quite good. Overall i had a mixed experience in this joint.

Now, in this review you have to keep in mind that I badly had to use WiFi, and when I checked I found they provide one (as per zomato). So we went in and ordered one Tetrazzini and one Strawberry Shake and asked for the WiFi password, when I was told that it is only for the guest house. I would hereby request zomato to take down WiFi from the highlights part of this cafe as it is very much misleading!
The Strawberry Shake was average, nothing extra-ordinary and the tetrazzini was served with a garlic bread and was okay-ish. And here once again I would like to mention, I was way beyond disappointed with them not providing WiFi, and hence probably my taste buds turned numb.

A small pocket friendly hangout restaurant , it looks nice when all lit up but it could have been a little more tidy may be - i felt a little clostrophoebic inside - though they have an outdoor small section too but i guess we preferred a non- smoking zone , 
Coming to the food - it was good nothing exceptional though - we ordered for a nachos which lacked cheese and the sandwich - wish it could be a little more grilled to perfection 
Overall a nice experience but would expect better the next time :)

 They serve excellent pasta and the must tries are : Creamy Pork Sausage with Rocket Spaghetti ,Prawn Pesto Spaghetti and of course Veg Lasagnia. Location and ambiance wise the restaurant is pretty good. But I guess the objectionable part is their over priced menu. Quality wise its good but quantity wise its average and compared to the quantity the price is really too much!!

Nxt tym....we had a barbeque chicken pizza....I didn't lyk d barbeque sauce though. Then d chicken fillet wid mashed potatoes n veggies....dis was really tasty nd perfectly cooked dish.
D 3rd tym I oredered a takeaway of Chicken sandwich...I found it too bland....just chicken mince nd mayonise...not worth d price.

Wise Owl looks like a classy open air cafe from outside. The inside however has an overdose of owl figurines. I have only had the arriabata pasta, chicken lasagna and chicken tetrazzini. The pasta is okay. I've had better pastas at cheaper prices. The lasagna and tetrazzini were amazing! BUT the wait for them was eternal! The service is very very slow. We ordered for the dishes at 3pm and received them at 5!We didnt say anything because the quality was very good. But their service really needs to improve. I'd visit Wise Owl again only if someone else was treating me and I'd probably not order anything baked. Although my friends say the other dishes arent as good. Its good enough for once in a while visit, if you have a lot of time.

Fantastic location and quirky decor doesn't necessarily mean great execution. And that's where Wise Owl fails miserably. The wait times are simply not worth the average food you would find in any deli across the city and then some. Even the hot chocolate is Hershey's in a glass; sickly sweet. But it is the service that makes everything else seem brilliant by comparison and that makes up for any other complaint a customer might have. 
I had been anticipating eating breakfast there for a while and yes, as always I was greeted with long wait times despite the wee hours and just two other customers present. The omelette was the kind an inexperienced cook would make ..... slightly burnt and dripping in oil. 
I must admit though, I have been there several times simply because I lived across the road. Now that I'm further away, I'm not sure I'll take the trouble to return. 

My verdict, a 2.0 simply because of the bistro ambience; average food and below average service.

Located across the silent streets of Hindustan Park, this place will definitely invite you with its beautiful ambience , both outside and inside. They have a separate smoking area outside (so yes! you can smoke while you eat). Its not too big , a small quite place to spend a perfect evening!! 

DO try the Chicken tettrazzeni there and don't forget to add extra bacon, if you have it. Its amazing.. The combination of chicken-cheese-bacon over a plate of spaghetti simply makes it yum !! It will cost you around 250 /-.

After long contemplation and planning I and my BFF finally visited the much heard about WISE OWL on 9th october 2014. Well, frankly speaking we expected a classier place than what we found after entering . the open air decor is much more appealing than the in-house look. the waiter was courteous and well behaved. the cost of the snacks are definitely on the higher side. 

we ordered the cream of chicken soup and chicken sausage pizza. 
now, the soup was moderate in taste but there was no cream in it let me assure u. it tasted much better when sprinkled with pepper and salt. the quantity is ok for single serving.

the pizza was light, crispy and tasty but too small for sharing.

the overall experience was okayish but is the pocket pinch worth the food served??? i don't think so.

food : 3/5
decor : 2/5
ambiance : 3/5
stuff : 3/5
price : 1.5/5

Have breezed past the place quite a few times but hadn't had the opportunity till quite recently to venture into the place which looked quite stunning from outside after sundown. The overall atmosphere is not OTT & once inside you would feel it's rather ordinary. Food is good though the quantity they serve would hardly suffice a hungry person. The cream of chicken soup was not delicious but tasted much better with pepper sprinkled on it. The chicken sausage pizza was nice, light, & tasty but too small to share. There were quite a few staff members moving in & out but they took quite a bit of time to manage a simple order. You may only try the place if you have a bit of time to spare. Moreover, apart from the tea & coffee options, the price tags of the rest of the dishes are clearly on the higher side. I would recommend this place only if you have time & money to kill & of course, pleasant company.

Wise Owl. Ah, what a place!
This place had been in my wishlist for a very, very, very long time now. Finally, today, after finding out that the evening show of this film we wanted to watch was houseful, we decided to not waste the time we have at hand, and visit this place.
As none of us knew the exact location, GPS once again comes to the rescue.
We wanted one of the outside tables, but unfortunately none was available at the moment. The ambiance was really different. Not what you'd find at any other everyday coffee shop. But the food is what really bowled us over. We ordered two Fried BBQ Chicken Wings, three Chicken Burger Combo Meals (burger+french fries+ coke), and one Ham Burger Combo Meal. The BBQ Chicken Wings were definitely the best chicken wings I've tried till date.  The burgers had really fresh meat and lettuce and the cheese as just melting...! The french fries were properly seasoned and were quite tasty.
Price is a bit on the steeper side, with our bill coming to 1565. But the food is definitely worth it.

I went to Wise Owl on a very sultry Saptami afternoon, because I was hearing a buzz about this place for sometime.
It is very understandable that on festive days the service to be slow, but to forget orders? Yup that happened.
So we ordered Ham Burger Combo and a Grilled Chicken in Mushroom Sauce.
Food was fine, though nothing to write home about. Burger could have been tastier, and the chicken was bland.I did enjoy the finger chips, then again you don't splurge over 700 to eat good fries only.
The main problem was with the billing, they charged me for an extra soda which i never drank, and the staff was very inept in dealing with it. 
They created the bill again and this time too, the charged more. 
I guess I was third time lucky: as the bill finally was corrected.

So yes, I am a bit discouraged from visiting it again.

The only reason I'm giving this place a 3.0 is because of its beverage preparation. The iced tea, which is my staple drink at cafés, was a thick drink with a syrupy, over-sweet taste. Upon complaining to the staff, we were given back the same drinks, just diluted with some water. The food though, is wonderful and perfectly sized. The ambience is quite nice, and the layout seems inspired by a European aesthetic.

Wise owl is a place where you can hang out with your friends, family or beloved. Its a very lovely place to be in. This puja...on Saptami i went there. The place is awsome and located at a proper place. I ordered combo: chicken burger + french fries + coke and Tetrazzini. The food was delicious and the quality is very good. The quantity is also proper. Price is worth the food. The service is also enjoyable. I would love to be there again and again. :)

Just another place to try out for some experience. Food is just fine, no disappointment there,but what kills is the serving time. Yes they took forever to serve. After waiting for 30 mins., I thought they forgot about our order, so I went to check with the manager, at least he seemed like the one in charge, who in turn assured me that our order was on the way, which by the way turned out 20 mins since then. And there arrives the Fried Prawns & Chicken Wings. And its not the rush which caused the delay, for there wasn't any, it was just the apathetic attitude of the staff . And 15 mins later came the Chicken Stroganoff. Our request for water went unheeded even after two reminders and I only got them when I got to the counter myself. So get some entertainment along if you are looking for a visit here, coz you ll have a lot of time to kill.

I was very curious to visit this place after hearing so much from various friends who had the opportunity to visit it before me. It was evening when we reached Wise Owl and wanted to sit outside. Being a Saturday outside seating had full occupancy so we had to be satisfied by sitting inside (The AC inside made me feel luckier than the people outside, I am an optimistic person you see :p)  My husband visited the place couple of times and he wanted me to try out a lot of things in one go. I started by ordering Chilly cheese toast , a masala tea and a filter coffee. The service took a long time and hence my rating of 4 to this lovely place. The chilly cheese toast was one of the best i had in Kolkata. The cheese was wonderfully coated all over the bread slices and the addition of green chillies gave a fantastic taste and flavour to the dish. The toast is quite filling and you would crave for more is my guarantee. The masala chai was simply awesome...Pay  Rs. 40 & you get almost 2 cups of tea in such a place!!! What better deal than this!!! Later we ordered an egg burger and Chicken sandwich ( i forgot which one) and believe me both were simply delicious and so much filling. I loved the egg burger specially because of the poached egg inside with cheese inside it which just melted in my mouth. Had to pack the sandwiches as we both were full then and i got saved of cooking dinner at night ;) The whole concept of the place is very English... A typical roadside cafe with an international feel serving some tasty food and beverages. The owl cabinet inside is quite interesting &  for the first time i found owls very cute :) The pinch is the pocket is average and i recommend this place if you plan to have a lazy adda session with friends or go for a quiet date with someone special.

This one of the most recent happening cafes in Kolkata.. so popular that it is also crowded in weekdays.. I went there for breakfast and it was a amazing experience.. one can prefer to sit outside but keeping in mind the Kolkata weather sometimes it is not a good choice..Food is good .. service is fast.. Ambience is very good .. price a bit steep but never mind. Give it a try uf you r in Kolkata :)

I've been walking past this cafe so many times and we finally landed there,that too twice in 10 days!! It is a small cafe, outdoor seating too..but we prefer the indoors. Have had sandwich,hot chocolate,cold coffee and chocolate avalanche. All were good.. cold coffee lacked sweetness and avalanche was mind blowing for me.
The cafe offers decent ambiance and is managed well. I'm satisfied both the times - good food to fill up my hunger, good ambiance for a great conversation.. what more to ask from a cafe..oh..i remember what to ask for..pancakes only for breakfast.. if we could have it all day that'd be great.

Just had a very bad experience @ Wise Owl. Had ordered for a Penne pasta & a chicken pizza. The food arrived on time...but surprise followed...The Pasta had strands of Nylon in it...no cutlery was provided...no chilli flakes, oregano, Tobasco sauce was given...had to ask for each of these....also we had to request for the 2 Glasses of water.

The Garlic Breads (served with Pasta) never came...& they had no clue about the Nylon strands...

We left the joint...With unfinished food ...DISGUSTED..

I just visited once and fell in love with the food served at this place and its ambience. It is a small place with a cafe type setting. getting a table can be difficult at evening. After shopping in Gariahat we decided to try this place as we got bored of nearby azad hind dhaba, crystal chopsticks etc. We ordered for grilled fish with lemon butter sauce and vegetables and chicken caesar salad. the presentation was very good and grilled fish just melted in the mouth. Salad was very tasty but it had more lettuce than chicken/croutons. the sweet lime soda was very watery and cold coffee was just average.  They serve maggi also! The price is on a higher side and picket pinch was around 750 for us. The behavior of staffs were really good but they took lot of time to serve the food. Once we were done, they took 15 min. to present the bills to us. If they want people to clear out the tables quickly (especially when people are waiting outside, or someone is in hurry to grab a quick bite), they should be more efficient about the entire process. But food here is a clear winner.

Wise Owl...the name itself strikes curiosity in us....My friend suggested me this cafe. It's situated in Purna Das road, a little from Golpark. It's a home cafe, decorated nicely with cosy chairs and such a cute ambiance...10 on 10 for the ambiance. Simply loved it. The mocktails and Chocolate cold coffee is yummy...the food..a bit overpriced, but worth it..It's good...A perfect place for an evening chitchat with friends over mocktails and snadwiches...Must try, the grilled fish item. It's yummy. 
Service is a bit slow, but good.

When we enquired, they said it will take 5-10mins more, when we asked why have you forgot? He hesitated and said no it was burnt. We cancelled the order and left.

Not much space to scatter ur legs and laptops. Have tried the cappuccino, sodas, sandwiches and thin crust pan pizzas. Will give a thumbs up to all f them except the pizzas. Not too exorbitant. Standard prices comparable to that of ccd.

The previous week i took the opportunity to visit this joint with my friends though it was a recent visit but the experience was so unimpressive that i hardly remember anything about this joint. We ordered meat lovers sandwich, some chicken pizza( don't remember the name) and cold coffee. Let me tell you this place moves at a snail's pace. They even took so long to serve us with the cold coffee. The cold coffee was not at all good and the size of the glass was quite small. Meanwhile we kept on asking as to how long will they take to serve us the food to which they replied in 5 minute which was not a true information. The sandwich was average and the pizza was shockingly small and not even sufficient for one person( especially for foodies like me) apart from this also not at all good in taste. For these two item and 2 cold coffee the bill was around 700. My verdict is that this place is overpriced , quantity is less, quality average and one needs to have patience if one wishes to eat here. I don't think am visiting this place again apart from a situation where i am not in a hurry and my only aim is to have a good chat with my friends.

First time in wise owl and it has the most easy location ever. You just start walking straight keeping Azad Hind Dhaba to your right and there you reach Wise owl in a flick of a second. The seating arrangements and the atmosphere is very nice. There are loads of people crammed up, all gossiping to each other about tonnes of stuff, I am sure. Me and my two very good friends met up and decided to land up in Wise owl as it would be the right choice for lunch. We entered and the place didn't have a vacancy. We did stand for sometime before we got to sit and we finally sat down. There was a wing festival going on and my friend who absolutely adores wings decided to gorge on some delicious Buffalo wings. And I, who is like the biggest fan of Fish and Chips decided to sit down with a bowl of it. Another friend of mine decided on Fish fingers. The food arrived, PRETTY late. We had to actually ask the sassy serviceman about the arrival of the food. The food arrived, hot and we jumped right away into it. The fish was pretty succulent and I liked the chips too, though it was unevenly salted. Also, the tartar sauce was a tad bit heavy on the capers. The buffalo wings was tasty, they topped the wings with a dollop of butter too that surely elevated the taste. Butter elevates anything. The fish finger tasted very nice as well. The fish finger was the mini version of the fish chips. The batter of the fish and chips should have been a bit more crispy and a this was more on the soggy side. Except that, the amount of french fries given was right as well as the amount of sauce.Good chill out place, later we sat outside, for obvious reasons. I would think of visiting this place again for some desserts and would want to hang out more.

Just two steps away from my house is this LOVELY European styled cafe the outer part decorated with a lot of greenery and lamps to give a nice evening atmosphere of chatting and all.I once had breakfast here which was mushroom toasts and bacon.Simply grand it was recreating the English breakfast in some ways(although i did not order the TRADITIONAL scrambled eggs).The chocolate shakes are nice too and not very expensive either.

Its was like entering an old british house on a rainy evening. Hearing too much about this place made our expection go higher. However true to its reputation the food was delicious. We ordered bacon and leak soup which did excite our taste buds inspite of being plain and thick. Next we got baked fish which came 20 mins late but the taste can pacify your temper fast ! There was a wings festival going on from which we ordered Caribbean Jerk which definitely had a different flavour.
Overall a nice experience. The behaviour of staffs were good. Only they take too much time to serve food. Definitely worth a second visit.

For a cafe, this place is really quaint. A refreshing change from the standard coffee with a warm and friendly feel. Since we went in the heat of the afternoon I preferred to sit si side though my friend mentioned that most prefer outdoors in the evening. 
It was really crowded though it was a weekday but the staff were hospitable and allowed us to wait while a table freed up. 
We had their avalanche and just loved it. Chocolatey goodness with icecream and brownies. It was big enough for two to share (and feel quite stuffed) and was very reasonably priced as we're other things on the menu. Wikl definitely visit the next time I'm in the city.

This place has a very French Cafe-ish look to the place. The area is small but the ambience is perfect for a Cafe. Kolkata being the hub for Succulent Food, it's not that surprising. The chocolate mousse has an essence of bitter sweet Tang in it that makes it irresistibly Delicious.Cold Coffee was okay though I liked the one at the Road side cafe, Gautum's more. 
The impression is perfect.

This was in my check list from a long time before arriving in Calcutta, friends strong recommendation as well, 

Finally went there on a weekday evening, as usual it was full, after 15 minutes we got seats inside, though anyways we preffered sitting inside because of heat outside! 
It was my birthday which was coming up, my friends got a surprise which was a birthday cake, post cake cutting....

Our order was...

1: white sauce pasta with toasted bread.
2: fish finger
3: chicken sandwich
4: lemon ice tea my favourite.
5: chocolate smoothie.
7: chocolate mousse.

The bill was 788/- which was including tax ! , 
If you talk about serving time, our orders were in our table within 15 minutes, which was very surprising, you all know why am I saying this.

I clicked the owls, and clicked us as well, 

Overall, I felt a homely atmosphere with good food and the company of good people !

Opt for this place ONLY if you have abundant time in hands. Being an impatient soul myself, I have been caught freaking out at almost every other soul present there whenever I was made to wait for hours at stretch after ordering Chicken Lasagne. About time to state that this is the only item I order for in this joint. It's delectable! But certainly, not that much worth the hours of wait! The quantity won't suffice your tummy if you're a foodie and precisely an avid lover of things that are well...ummm...cheesy! And, do not try the pastries out there. You'll feel like suing the restaurant when all they serve is a sort of hard-to-chew-and-swallow cake which goes by the name of "Death by Chocolate Pastry." I suppose it should be renamed "Dearth of Chocolate Pastry" since you'll find no trace of chocolaty cream in it. Utter disappointment. I hadn't the courage to try the other pastries out as my intuition assured that I would be cursing them too as well!  Talking about the location and ambience, pretty good they are. But they could've changed the seating arrangement inside, which I hope will be thought about soon.

If you're craving for some Pasta, tetrazini and Lasagne along with some refreshing soda coolers, make yourself available at Wise Owl. Its a really nice cafe on the streets of Hindustan Park, stone throw distance from Gariahat's shopping zone. While checking out amazing dishes there, you can make yourself comfortable in the lounges outside as well as inside.

Horrible Food...Lousy Service

This establishment is testimony to the fact how average Zomato reviews can be so misleading. I really cannot fathom what the rave reviews are about. Fine! the decor and outdoor seating is decent (the reason why smokers are gaga), this place can only be recommended by couples who hang out around that area (a lover's lane of sorts owing to the picturesque lake and maidan nearby), and this is a decent place to play some footsie, (better that being rounded up by the local cops).

As far as food goes, this place is best avoided. For starters, it is extremely wannabe. We ordered a Pizza, that turned out to be soggy, with amul cheese instead of mozarella, with the added bonus of a stray strand of hair. A green apple soda, which was frankly, disgusting the with flavour being pretty much identical to any run of the mill cough syrup you can get. The grilled chicken had a terrible jus, and for the love of God, please please avoid the Bacon 'n  ham risotto. It had the texture and consistency of South Indian curd rice, and a weird flavor that possibly cannot be replicated by any bistro even if they wanted to. The service is lousy, and all orders needed to be followed up with 2 or 3 reminders before they were delivered.

I wouldn't mind these nuances if things were priced accordingly, but way that things are, that establishment is plain profiteering like pioneering war criminal.

Extremely cool chilled out place if,your out with friends and on a tight budget. I for instance went for breakfast with my mum, the breakfast isn't anything great, but for its price you really couldn't ask for more. They didn't have muffins but were prompt enough to compensate with French fries. I don't remember cereal being served at all even though it was mention. Oh and before I sign of, do not stop here if you're in a hurry, they really do take their time! Cheers

When i say Wise Owl it feels i am at my home.. Its such a comfy place to hang out with your closed ones,especially 'adda' with your friends. The ambience is soothing. You can spend hours and hours just sitting,digging into some yummy sandwiches and chips accompanied by a cup of coffee. Wise owl special cappuchino is a must try. Their ham cheese sandwich jus melts in mouth. Their version of maggie is so different. Sausages,chicken wings and many more is worth the price. Their breakfast and lunch menu is just so good that it can easily beat any other proper restaurant or even flurys. Desserts are tasty. All in all wise owl makes us more wise and more happy and gay with their quality of food.

Decent options to choose for but nothing exquisite. Poor service, slow and boring makes it very repelling. In my two visits I have been highly disappointed since I can't wait till eternity for food to come.

Yet Fritata was good but extra oily, Club sandwich is a good filling.

Garlic breads were one of the best I have ever had.

I've been wanting to go to this place for a while as i'd heard tonnes of praises for it, but it dashed all.my expectations. Nothing great about the food, all below average. The hot chocolate they served tasted like bournvita and the greek salad that they gave was extremely salty and they gave amul cheese instead of feta cheese. Majorly disappointed. The only thing I liked about this place was the ambience, the fact that they had outdoor seating and the service was quite fast too.

An excellent place to chill out, undoubtedly. A very pleasant cafe, the outdoor seating arrangement is simply great. I've been to this cafe on several occasions but one reason I keep coming back, is for their breakfast. The quantities they offer are generous, with some really good variety on the menu. The food is delicious, simple and with the right flavours. Their service is a little slow, but bearable. On weekends, a place at wiseowl requires some serious luck! Looking for good food, coffee and long hours of conversation, you know where to go! :)

Decor- fabulous.

Food- Okay

Prices- exorbitant

Facilities- Good

This is a good place if you want to quietly sit down with a cup of coffee and work on your laptop or hangout with your buddies.
And basically if you have loads of money and want to spend it.
When you are in a hurry or even hungry you are sure to get grumpy. Love the shakes here. The pastas are a must have.

Had breakfast earlier this week after reading reviews. Nice cosy place in a residential colony. It is part of a guest house. Seating arrangement outside was a welcome, though not recommended on hot and humid days. I tried their meat lovers club sandwich and cappuccino. The sandwich came highly recommended in earlier reviews. It was actually very good. The chicken, eggs, bacon etc were all in the right proportion and grilled to perfection. Quantity is good for two people I guess. Its served with potato chips. I have not tried any other dish, so cannot comment further. But with what I had, I am assuming the other stuff on the menu would be equally good. Its a good alternative to kachoris for breakfast. Price of the sandwich and coffee was approx. Rs. 300. Would recommend a visit to this place.

It's the few places where visitors can enjoy their cigarettes with the tea/coffee. 
My favorites are the meat lovers club , peach ice tea and baked fish. 
It's a bit under staffed , hope they increase the waiters.

Dropped in for a weekend adda last Sunday. The place is small and feels crowed. At times even get a tad loud for your liking. The cold soda based drinks were hopeless. Luckily the spicy chicken fingers restored some faith. Coffee was average. I personally liked the meat lovers sandwich. Deserts were a letdown. They were just sugar and food coloring. Btw, we tried the choco & mango mousse since those were only ones available. Overall, spent around 1900 bucks for 3 people and was not convinced if I would return. Final nail in the coffin was the service, hopeless... absolutely hopeless...

My first and last time at Wise Owl.

Ambiance: Quaint, just off the street with a nice open space for smokers looking for quick cup of tea (I prefer tea to coffee). The  air conditioned section has nice decor and is brightly lit. 

Things my friends and I tried (7 of us): 

Grilled Sandwich, Meatlovers Club Sandwich, Nachos, Corn Cheese Balls, Chicken Burger, Chilly Cheese Toast, Lemon Ice Tea, Cold Coffee, Hot Chocolate,Cafe Mocha, Chicken Maggi, Veg Burger

Now to the food, what not to order - pretty much everything above. 

Sandwich: Terrible bread, grilled but cold so became hard and starchy. 

Nachos: Everything on it came from a can or a packet. Nothing seemed to have been made in-house

Chicken Burger: Supposed to be in a bar-b-cue sauce. The sauce was a watery version of tomato puree which was unpalatable.  

Do not order regular water, it seemed unfiltered and had a strange taste. 

The top picks were Corn Cheese Balls, Chilly Cheese Toast, Lemon Ice since it is something we can all whip up at home. Veg burger and Maggi too.

Service: 

Extremely slow service. To give you perspective, they took approximately 2.5 hours to bring the above food. Furthermore, the Veg Burger and Maggi never even arrived - thank God!

All in all, an unpleasant experience and I am not recommending this place to anyone. Give it a shot and tell me if the above was true. My advice, skip it - the time, quality of food and price is certainly not worth it. 

I almost forgot, my friend Aditya found bugs on the chairs! He is probably going to have a sleepless night.

My Bill No.: 4195 - Towards authenticating that we really did go and collectively thought it was considerably below average.

Until Friday Wise Owl was a perfect place to hang out with friends thanks to the amazing decor and food. But the rude manager and the slow service spoils the fun ( Just two waiters serve the whole cafe- no doubt it is super slow ).  Last Friday I went there with my friends and ordered a veg lasagna with extra mushroom. You should definitely avoid this place if you are very hungry. After an hour's waiting and reminding thrice the waiter finally served the lasagna. It was disappointing to see that on asking for extra mushrooms in the dish the lasagna was served without a single piece of mushroom. When we called the manager to speak regarding the same . He rudely told us to check the menu which said lasagna was not served with mushrooms. Immediately I opened the menu and checked the ingredients details and it said "Baked pasta with assorted vegetables and mushrooms layered with white and red sauce" . When we called the manager again , he stood at the end of the cafeteria and refused to come. After 5 minutes a waiter came to pick the dish from our table without any apologizes. He took back the dish and added mushrooms to it and this took them another 25 minutes. Just to eat Lasagna we spent an hour and half waiting and they did not bother serving us water for that whole time. The food cannot compensate for the slow service and rude behavior of the staff.

I was planning to visit this place for quite a long time.. One fine cloudy morning i went there with my boyfriend to have breakfast and hang out. I loved the decor. They have both outdoor and air conditioned seating facilities. The chairs and tables are white and very cutely designed. All the walls have sketched pictures of owl hanging. The clock looked like an owl too. It has a showcase having different objects looked like owl. These things go perfectly with the name. We ordered scrambled egg, cold coffee and cappuccino. They tasted really good. Service is fast. Price reasonable.

Must visit for a relaxing date with your special one. I uploaded some photos of some of their dishes. They look very yummy. This place is mostly visited by people for spending their leisure time with their friends. Service is good the outer section gives the feel of a old tree house. Must Visit.

I prefer the food items more than the beverages of Wise Owl. Sandwiches are mouth watering. Preparation of Maggi is really innovative. But the best item is Prawn Croquette wrapped in Bacon...simply mind blowing. But they need to improve the quality of fresh lime soda which is served in a cheap quality glass.

I go here usually to sit outside over coffee and smoke. The ambience is the best thing about this place after dark. The yellow lights filtering out of lamp shades and the mural on the wall should be good enough for any evening conversation you wish to have. Good place for couples and the food is decent too though I doubt anyone goes there for it. Come if you wanna sit and chat somewhere with your loved one

Situated in the lane opposite Basanti Devi College, Wise Owl was on my wishlist for long. And finally, I got the oppurtunity to pay it a visit. So how could I not grab the oppurtunity? :D
After quite a filling lunch, I along with my brother, decided to visit Wise Owl for dessert. 
For a North Calcuttan like me, entering Wise Owl makes one feel like he's in a completely different place. Atleast thats what I felt. It has outdoor and indoor seating. The decor  is simply lovely. As they say, first impression is the last impression. And it surely did impress me.
I ordered Brownie With Ice-Cream and Chocolate Sauce and Wise Owl Special Cappucino, while my brother ordered Apple Soda and Tiramisu Mousse. The mousse wasnt available initially, but they informed it as soon as it was, and asked if we would like to change our order (as in the absence of Tiramisu Mousse, my brother had ordered Chocolate Mousse). My brother was more than happy to change the order.
Till this point, the ambience has really impressed me. And all of a sudden, there started a loud noise, maybe of the coffee machine, but it completely disrupted the ambience, and it continued for a good 10-15 minutes. That was not at all expected. I mean even CCD uses coffee machines, but I have never experienced noise as terrible as this.
Coming to the food. My brother was not pretty happy with the mousse. But I was with my coffee. It was one of the best, I have had till date. The brownie with chocolate sauce and ice-cream was simply to die for. It was a tad too sweet for me personally. But then, I am not a "sweet-a-holic". The chocolate sauce was thick unlike I expected. Overall, lovely food.
I would have given it a 4 but that sound is still ringing in my head. And we had to wait around 20-odd minutes to get our bill. So 3.5.
But I am looking forward to having a lunch there soon :)
PS: I did take a picture of the brownie, but it probably got deleted mistakenly.

Excellent location and more awesome ambiance. Perfect for a hangout with friends. Famous for it's Omelet recipes, but they serve it along with breakfast only. I really loved their Meet Lover's Club Sandwich, which is enough for 2 person. The Fish Finger is another must thing to try. It was so soft inside and crunchy looking outside will melt in your mouth. Don't forget the meyonese sauce. There is also special items for Maggie Lovers :). All of them are good.
Definitely visit again.

Our favorite place for a grub when we have time in hand. Also this has become a favorite breakfast joint -- more because it is pretty near my home. The spouse loves their maggie. As for me, I enjoy both the sandwiches and pancakes. But what tops the list is their french fries especially for the chat masala they sprinkle on top. But the service is pretty laid back. It is good when you want to hang out with friends or family. But if you are in a hurry, this may irritate you. I also like the outdoor sitting when the weather is good.

Overview- nicely located...just a bit in from the lane beside the petrol pump at golpark... subtly done...small...but nice !
Ambiance - umm...the outside seating is a favorite for the smokaholic Kolkatan...brings in a difference form the mundane,common cafe's all over...nothing much into the interiors...u may feel its a bit too small...but the food makes up for it !although i do recommend them adding a few air-coolers for the patio...and a bit  more music may b...for the ambiance... !
Food-oh..mushroom maggi it is... creamy and amazing...and the meat lovers club sandwich...yummy...eggs bacon...all in the right proportion...and the tettrazini  as well !
Service-they really need to work on this...pretty lackadaisical on this front...not really warm or interactive...grumpy at times...and...sort of slow...my friend had to wait 30 minutes for a tetrazini...while we finished rest of our food and eventually jumped on to his !!!

A classic place to chill at for all age groups. Both indoor and outdoor seating available, though it can get a bit jampacked on weekends. The population of visitors outnumbers the staff so your order might take forever. I ordered chicken wings and some lemon ice tea and it took over an hour for it to be served. Let me tell you it was worth the wait! Mushroom Maggie is a must try.

We went more out of curiosity but ended up having lunch. Since it was a week day it was relatively empty. It is an attractively done-up place if a little small. The food took its time to arrive but it was almost worth the wait. For starters we had prawn croquettes wrapped in bacon. The prawns had a kind of tempura coating and the rind of bacon used for wrapping it was a generous one. it was accompanied by the standard tomato ketchup. For the main course we had  grilled chicken breasts with mushroom sauce and a prawn pesto spaghetti. Some of the pork based items were not available. The chicken breasts were overcooked and therefore rubbery but it did have an adequate accompaniment of mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables. The prawn pesto. spaghetti was quite different in taste from the usual tomato-based gravy or the white sauce based ones but it was a welcome taste. For dessert we had chocolate mousse which surprised us with its generous serving. 

All in all, a good place only that service is slow. But good food takes time and care to prepare and you will not be disappointed when it arrives.
Oh, an added bonus is the free Wi-Fi!

Wise Owl is a lovely place to hangout and I dont mean just with friends . I have been there with my friends , my wife , my whole family and I can easily say it was liked by all . And one of the reasons most of them liked was because of the quality of food - which is pretty important factor . 
Wise Owl is a place to be for young people no doubt ... and they like to cater to their taste ,  but I have seen families ordering breakfast , lunch , evening snacks and dinner as well - which is quite a feat . 
They have a sitting arrangement in outdoors , which comes with garden chairs under an yawning but even at the same time, it is not totally on the road . And there is also an indoor arrangement with AC and TV . 
Some of my personal favourites there include the Meat Lovers Club Sandwich, Ham platter  and among deserts - The Avalanche . 

Cons : The place is almost always full , and not extremely spacious , so you may have to stand in a que , especially on weekends .

Had been longing to visit thia place since long. Finally plunged in after office with my collegues. Well , I liked the decor ans specially the vintage touch through out. It was good to start with a glass of cafe mocha but the food was quiet disappointing... Spaghetti is definitely a bad choice... May be one should ideally settle down with their sandwiches to be on the happier side.. Not sure if I would visit wise owl again for its food but to hangout and have a chat with a friend over coffee, I would not mind tht..

I will keep it short and simple:
1)A smiling and hospitable attitude goes a long way which they unfortunately lack 
2)The burgers are good but not well assembled.
3)Mocktails are good.
4)The chicken dish we had taken  was tough and my child had a tough time chewing it.
So overall ok-ok maybe we will be luckier the second time.

oh yes as soon as i had entered this place the first thing i noticed is the huge collection of owl showpieces!!!! having been away from kolkata for two years now i was unaware of this place. my friends knowing my taste brought me here guaranteeing a good experience and dis place dint disappoint me in the least.. neither too pretentious nor too roadside... this place has a class of its own. i loved the cafe mocha and the cold coffee with ice-cream. considering the weather i haven't been able to explore the menu much except for chicken wings which was quite good and loads of coffee ofcrs!!! The only disappointing aspect is the level of service. you have to wait for too long for that cuppa you ordered which is cool with me as long as m not starving!!!!

Overall its a very nice place and i keep going back here. by the way if you are a smoker u will love the outdoor seating as well!!!!!

Its really the ambience that would make this place score. Its tastefully decorated, very cosy and provides for a great hangout with friends. The food is pretty much decent nothing great but good value for money. I like their maggi, conti platters and tutty fruity icecream - homely and nice. But yes, they take a looooooong time to serve and that's a turn off. The price is reasonable.

Beautiful place, beautiful decor, lively music playing in the background. The first impression of this place is great. We'd ordered a meat lover's club sandwich, French fries, and then chocolate mousse for dessert. The sandwich and the French fries were good! But the dessert was more of a chocolate mud pie..it lacked the lightness of a mousse. And the greatest drawback of this place is the time taken for service. Waiters are very polite, but they take a lot of time to serve the order. Otherwise i loved the place!

If you want sandwiches, mushroom Maggie and peach lemon tea under the same roof, then try the Wise Owl. Tucked into the corner of the road it is easily accessible from Hindustan Park, Gariahat or Keyatala Road. I am a frequent visitor to this place and I think it fits both the pockets and the fills the epicurean me after work hours. 
Wise Owl also boasts an open area outside for enjoying the evenings though you do not get too much of the view apart from the road outside. For those quick bites I have always tried the Chicken Penne and the Garlic Breads along with the Chicken Ceaser Salad. But if you are looking for more wholesome options you can also go for the Baked Fish and the grilled Chicken with mushroom sauce. 
Once you are here you must check out the collection of a variety of auspicious and (wise) owls lined up on one side of the restaurant. The well lit lighting and the freshness of the food always adds to the charm of this place. Best time to visit Wise Owl is the early evening but chances are that you might have to wait a while for your turn at the table

Snack items taste good! Not a big space, just casual evening spot for people who want to enjoy coffee with their partners. Its a good choice for people when the weather in Kolkata is windy and rainy. Its a perfect spot to enjoy rain, sip of coffee and munch on a burger/ sandwich.

Seeing my friends giving updates in fb about ths place, I was pretty much excited to visit it once.. And yeah, I found the name super cute.. I was a bit disappointed as me and my friend had to wait for around 45mins before we could get in.. The ambience was nice.. And we laughed, clicked pics, talked as much as we wanted to.. The behaviour of the staff was great.. I was surprised to see the awesome collection of owls there.. They are super-duper cute.. We'd ordered pancake, sanwich and coffee.. They tasted good.. The prices are nt too high.. One fine morning if you dnt wana have home-made breakfast then you can surely visit ths place.. That's another good point.. In short, a cute cafe. :-)

this is the cutest little coffee shop i've seen. situated on purna das road, its quite close to the hustle and bustle of the busy gariahat, yet conveniently far. there are beautiful owl artifacts inside. their pasta is to die for. i particularly love their penne formagio chicken which is rich and creamy. the flavours are immaculate and is served with garlic bread. the lasagna is pretty good. the chocolate chip pancakes they serve is to die for!
its a cute place with a lot of breakfast options. in the evenings, this joint tends to get pretty crowded. just remember to visit this place with plenty of time on your hands as there are just 2 servers who part time as the cooks. often, you might end up waiting for over 40 mins just for a coffee.
other than its slow service, i had no reason to complain.

Fantastic place. This is one place I would have visited most amount of times. Good ambience. Great food. Only thing is that the service is a little slow. But when you are there hanging out with friends, you surely dont realise the slightly slow service.

The Maggi is great, all the varieties of Maggi. The pizza offerings and the burgers too are really good.  The one place in the Rashbehari/Gariahat area that I would recommend to everyone to go out and try.

A small coffee shop located near vivekananda park.
An amazing place to hangout with friends.
Im visit the joint very often..and they never fail to satisfy me.
The mushroom maggi is just cheesy.. Tempting and yummy.
The chicken lasagne is just perfect..
Fried prawns are big enough and tastes perfect with the tangy sauce.
And the avalanche for desserts is yummy.
Perfect for a sweet tooth craving.
But their service is very very slow.
But nonetheless, the food they serve is worth the wait.

I go there whenever I crave mushroom Maggie ! 
I love the mushroom Maggie! One of the best things on the menu .. 
The last time I was here .. I went with 3 more friends.. It had rained outside .. And the outdoor setting is beautiful with the whole street light and all .. 
Plus that wall painting is and decor just adds to this place .. 
It's a pleasant hangout place with friends 
Anyway .. So the 3 of us had order 
Mushroom Maggie 
Fish & chips 
Chicken burger 
Hot chocolate 
And blue lagoon  (can't exactly remember the name .. This is pretty long back ) 
If you are extremely hungry .. You would want to avoid this place cus this place takes waaaaay toooooo long to serve food !! That's one major drawback 
-Mushroom Maggie 
Since it's one of my favs , I am biased towards it and I go there to eat that 
-fish & chips 
The fish was very well cooked and the white sauce added a lot more taste. 
Chips was okay .. Some were over fried 
-Burger 
This was surprisingly good , I was very apprehensive to try it .. But it was good in both quality and quantity 
Now coming to the hot chocolate 
Oh well what can I say about this one .. It was plain milk and coco powder mixed .. No creme nothing .. You can totally avoid the hot chocolate 
-blue lagoon 
Even this was a bit disappointing .. Less of syrup and more of ice .. 
Over all rating 
Service - 2/5 
Food - 2.5/5 
Setting - 4/5 
Cost - 3/5 
Over all - 3/5

The first thing that your would notice after entering the cafe is the awesome collection of owls!!!! Am a regular visitor and I really like the outdoor seating arrangement. The food is really good be it chicken stroganoff or chicken sandwiches or sausages. The one thing that you really need to have is (not money as the prices are damn reasonable) but a great deal of patience. Their service is really really slow. But then who stops you from giving an Adda with a grumbling stomach!!!

Well Wise Owl totally deserves a thumbs up from me. Situated at a  very convenient location, Wise Owl is a great place to connect with friends over really good food. The first time i went there was for breakfast and their cheese and ham sandwich was sinful. Let me tell you that these people are not at all stingy with the amount of cheese they add to their sandwiches. The milk shakes are delicious and filling as well. But my vote goes to the Meat Lovers Club sandwich!! If you are not phenomenally hungry, then you may not be able to finish one by yourself. Also, their Grilled Chicken with Mushroom Sauce and Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter sauce is a must try.  The chilly garlic Maggi with chicken is also nice. And if you have a sweet tooth like mine you must try their Avalanche. The sitting area outside reminds me of the cafes in Darjeeling, quaint and pretty!

Well wise owl does not really have my favourite cuisine which is Chinese, yet it's very close to my heart because of two reasons. Firstly, the restaurant has been established by one of the seniors of my school and secondly i have been here with some of my closest friends. The chicken stroganoff is absolutely delightful and also the risotto is great. The sandwiches are dainty and about the interiors - they are very tasteful and warm. It is a very posh and elegant joint. Time spent here has to be great.

Despite being forewarned, we went to this place!! The only thing good is the seating arrangement outside and it stops at that!
We ordered for fish finger, cheese chilly toast, ham sandwich & chocolate shake. We asked them to give us the cheese chilly toast first but they served the fingers first. It was Bassa and not Bhetki and that was the first downer. The fish was too soft & on the verge of going bad. They served it with the standard tartar sauce. We asked them for some ketchup, which took 10 minutes to come after a reminder.
The cheese chilli toast was too hard and with too many green chillies, and the cheese too was tasteless.
The ham sandwich was again way too toasted with tiny ham slices and barely there dressing, it bruised the inside of our mouth.
The only decent item was the chocolate shake.
If not for the ambiance I would have given a 1 rating…
For the money paid the food was not worth at all… It may be good for people who want to simply sit around for a long awhile, I am definitely not going back!

So that is how the open café feels like. Fresh and comforting. And when they have such a varied menu to offer, one could not have wanted for more. Out with girlfriends in search for a place to hang out, Wise Owl came out as a wise choice. The ambiance is good special mention to the open area which is mostly occupied. The food is good, but the service is slow with a friendly staff, they are more than happy to help. 

We ordered Chicken lasagna and citrus cooler. The lasagne was well I might say a cheese tornado in mouth. Perfect pasta with perfect filling and cheese, makes this dish a must try. The mocktail was refreshing and fulfilling. 
Only the service is slow which can be overlooked given the company of good food and friends.

My recent experience at Wise Owl was better than the last time I went there, but still fell quite a bit short of expectations. As this place stays open till late, does not mind customers lazing around and is known for an arrangement of outdoor seating for smokers, its definitely a place which I tried to like. We ordered French fries, Cappuccino, Iced Tea (which was way too sugary for my friend's taste and she had to gulp water afterwards), non-veg club sandwich and a ham sandwich. The server took the order and we were relaxing outside, so we expected some service to happen. Unfortunately, we were kept waiting for nearly half an hour before our coffees came in, followed by the food. I have to say that the french fries were perfectly crisp and they sprinkled some spice on top which made it taste pretty good. The coffee was so-so, and the ham sandwich was actually pretty nice. But the service time really killed it for us, especially when we asked the server a couple of times about our meal.

Wise Owl is a pretty popular cafe located on Purna Das Road near the Azad Hind Dhaba. My friend had just landed in Kolkata and we decided to catch up over breakfast before I leave for office. We zeroed in on Wise Owl as we were near Golpark. 

The setting of the cafe is nice with a street side open area and an air conditioned seating inside. We decided to sit outside and chat. The waiter immediately presented us with the menu. I noticed that the prices are pretty high, in fact the sandwiches are costlier than the ones available at CCD. Since we were not too hungry we decided to go for a Chicken Sandwich and a Lemon Iced Tea. 
The ambiance is simple yet appealing with the walls covered with owl themed graffiti. The chairs are pretty comfortable to sit and relax over a lazy breakfast. We were the only people seated outside. It took a very long time to get our sandwich and Lemon Iced Tea. I could not figure out any one else at the cafe at that point in time, still it took around 20-25 minutes to serve a plate of sandwich and iced tea. After the food arrived, I noticed that the sandwiches are made up of the normal white bread that we have at home. One bite into the sandwich confirmed the same. Though it was freshly made and 1 plate  consists of 4 triangle sandwiches, the taste is not appealing at all. I would rate it very average. The sandwiches were accompanied by potato chips and few sachets of tomato sauce. 
The Lemon Iced tea on the other hand tasted pretty nice. Priced at Rs60, it is very refreshing and good to taste. Definitely recommended.
After browsing through the menu I could tell that the place is a bit overrated and pricey. As for this experience was pretty average, may be I need to check out some other dishes for which Wise Owl is famous.

Wise Owl- a small coffee shop located near Gariahat... had heard loads about it from friends... went there only to realize that they mesmerize you to an extent that you keep coming back for more. the ambiance is excellent. if you want to wile away your time reading a book or writing something ( something that i do quite often) or just sit back and relax, this is the place to be. their caramel coffee is to die for. it is by far the best one i have ever had. the meat lovers club sandwich is quite a feast. yummy and filling!!! the masala tea is not only tasty, it is served in a quantity which can easily suffice two people. the chocolate mousse is like a sin i love to indulge in every now and then. and lastly, their avalanche is to kill for... its a feast for the eyes as well as tickles your taste-buds... amazing job, guys!!! sad that i can only give u 5 stars cos if i could i would have rated u THE BEST COFFEE SHOP OF KOLKATA!!!

I've been to Wise Owl quite a few times and its one of my favorites. Though people have rightly complained about the slow service of this place, I have accepted it as a reality of the cafe. I only go there when I have lots of time and want to have a leisurely time and not when I am in a hurry to grab something and leave. In fact, the non-rushed ambience is one of the things I love about Wise Owl. Good crowd, everyone seems engrossed in conversations and very positive vibes. It is a place where people socialize on food and not just to fill their stomachs. The finger food choice tastes good. My personal favorites are the egg & cheese sandwich and cafe mocha (hot).

P.S - I feel the cost for two mentioned on zomato as Rs.900 is very much on the higher side. I think 400-500 would be a more realistic figure.

It's quite hard not to be charmed by your first sight of Wise Owl. A little white structure with an awning over the entrance and quaint chairs outside, tucked away in a quiet locality, it reminds you of something you'd expect to see in the English suburbs. The name too - Wise Owl - suggests peace and tranquility. 
The interior is even more delightful - one large room with tables set out, and glass cabinets filled with owl-themed bric-a-brac lining the walls. The view is definitely great - a quiet street, not much traffic, as opposed to the bustling main roads. However, the goods display adjoining the counter can be better maintained, as it is mostly empty with only a few trays of cakes set out.
I have visited Wise Owl three times and tried different dishes on each occasion. On my first visit I had a juice mocktail - can't recall the name - and shared a pasta and chicken risotto with my friend. The pasta was quite good, but the risotto was average in my opinion, though my companion gobbled it up. For dessert we tried the chocolate muffin - sweet, but a little hard. We didn't face any major problems with service on that occasion, as everything was served within half an hour - not too bad, considering that we were predisposed to linger and chat. 
The second occasion was at a surprise birthday party for a classmate. The service was very fast that time, probably because the food was pre-ordered. We had garlic bread, nachos, veggie pizza and veggie fusilli with white sauce (the birthday girl was a vegetarian). The garlic bread is basically toast with garlic butter, but tastes quite nice. The nachos are rather bland, as is the accompanying sauce - I would not recommend it. The pizza and pasta were delicious, especially the pasta. I could eat it all day! 
The third occasion was again with a friend, and this time we were in for a nasty shock. We ordered litchi and chocolate milkshakes, which did not make their apoearance until 40 minutes later. And that too, after repeatedly hailing the waiter. Then, of course, the food. We'd ordered a chicken fusilli and a ham and bacon risotto at the same time as the milkshakes - yet they simply refused to appear! What made it worse was that we could see diners who had arrived after us receiving their orders first! I was quite irritated that day and threatened to leave without eating anything. After much coaxing, cajoling and berating, the items finally appeared. To be honest, they were almost worth the wait - the pasta was as good as before, and the risotto was delightfully creamy and meaty and made me fall in love with it. But at what a price did it come! We spoke to the waiter, who said that they were currently understaffed and there was only him to take the orders and serve everyone. We found it quite odd that a good restaurant like this wouldn't take better care of the staffing problem. Quite naturally, we were both miffed at the delay and decided not to stay for dessert - we'd probably be stuck here for another hour if we did so! 
Wise Owl would score full marks if it weren't for the lousy service. The ambience and the food are spot on and it's really sad that they're losing out on a more faithful customer base because of staffing issues. I hope they will soon realise this and address the matter. Meanwhile, I will definitely return to Wise Owl for more of their delicious fare...after ensuring that I have sufficient time to kill that day.

This was my 4th or 5th visit to Wise Owl. Apart from the ambience i never really thought too much about the place. The service has always been very slow and food just about ok. However, yesterday was by far one of the worst experience i have ever had at any cafe/restaurant. I was appaled by the rude staff. Especially the guy taking orders(wish i had noted his name). He was literally throwing things around. Menu card, plates etc were dropped on the table with a bang. While serving we were trying to tell him something and instead of responding we were asked to take the plate from his hand in rudest manner possible. Slow and louay service anyway makes the entire experience bad. But rude behaviour just cannot be accepted. Im definetely not going back there and im sure my friends who were with me yesterday feel the same. And i would never ever reccomend this place ro anyone. If u want to feel insulted on top of getting yojr food an hour after placing the order.... do visit!!!!!!

After a long time, I stepped into Wise Owl to check on the recent menu change.
The only change that I actually saw are a few new added items and exorbitant price hike. It really hurts.
I kept flinching and checking their price because given my last experience, the prices just do not make up for the food.
You would not want to part with INR 100/- for a plate of maggi , would you?)
Well, my experience this time was slightly different. I'll tell you why. Read on :

As usual in the wee hours of 2.30pm, J and I (I must admit J has also become a foodie and eats at every place given) walked into the cafe. Outside seating was almost full and hence I chose to sit inside. (Technically, the insides are cosy, well my excuse was pretty lame that its filled because there were a few chairs empty)
Anyway, we seated ourselves and then fiddled with the menu for quite some time before we reached a conclusion.

1. Prices have been increased for a run at mill on the floss.
2. New staff (was the same last time too and is good)
3. Same cane chairs and pictures of tea, nothing new, oh and yellow warm lights)
4. Our order  : :

a. BBQ pizza
b. French fries (well I just wanted to have it, you know, just like t that)
c. Fresh orange juice
d. Double choco chip muffin

PS : We were in the mood for lunch


The juice and the french fries made their appearance first.
The juice was from Real (I could very well make out from the taste) and about the fries ? Yes, worth writing because it was not just plain soggy or plain crispy fries. They were crispy and spicy fries. Yes, spicy ones and I so loved it.

The pizza took me by surprise. This is what happens when you do not keep any expectations from a place(it had disappointed me, so I had rather not expected anything at all)
The pizza was fresh and the spice were just right. It did not give me a very commercial product like feel (something that I get from Dominos and Pizza Hut) but it was so very home made that I loved every bit of it.
One problem was that the base crust was biscuit like. Kept breaking. :|
Rest everything was fine.
The chicken, the cheese, the bbq sauce and the homely touch to it. Spot on.
Lastly. my favourite here is the double choco chip muffin. I stress on the double choco chip because it sounds so cool and yummy.
I wonder how single choco chip would have sounded. (Not a good idea, I suppose)
It was as good and warm and fresh as ever.

Satisfied.
Coming back soon.

The bill was INR 579/-

Recommendations : BBQ Pizza, Wise owl special coffee and Double choco chip muffin.

Cheers! :)



----- 18 Oct, 2013 -----

Quaint little cafe - very noisy!

The ambience has nothing great to it. Pretty average. Cane-like chairs and small tables.
The like the owl graphitti on the wall outside. Outdoor seating is advantageous for smokers. Indoors is pleasant and nice.
Nothing great yet again.

Service is slow I admit (ignorant waiters too) and thankfully I never had to face disasters here because I stick to my routine orders of : Wise Owl special cappuccino, Pasta Arabiatta (fusilli),  and Fish fingers which are pretty decent.

Given the food, prices are a bit steep, because I feel the food could have been better. But its fine, till the time they can satiate a foodie's never filling tummy.
I am generally here for a little chat with pals, thats all.

Finger food is advisable else very pocket pinching and not even worth so much!
So, if you want to spend a lazy afternoon or a beautiful evening here with the breezy winds and little pretty lights, Wise Owl is just decent enough.

Cheers ! :)

On my first visit to Wise Owl i was impressed with the savory offerings.  I still am. The Tetrazzini is nice and cheesy (my favorite),so is the lasagne, the sandwiches are well-made, the burgers are always tender and succulent. However the muffins we were served the very 1st day had burst the happy bubble. That and the super-slow, giving-snails-a-tough-competition waiters. But that does not take away from the fact that this place has become one of Kolkata's favorite cafe/ hang out zone. Much of it is due to ambiance. You can spend hours and hours over here. This place is very near my house, and ideal to catch up with friends or simply to spend a lazy noon. 

I would request the addition of one item in their menu in future : fondues ( both cheese and chocolate). Kolkata doesn't have too many restaurants/cafes offering it. And every time i come here and sit lazily i can't help craving for one. And it will go perfectly with the ambiance of Wise Owl.

#### Visited Wise Owl once more! the food has improved vastly! The Avalanche was to die for! I liked the Nachos as well! Cant say the same for service! Needs to be a lot faster, still!!

Location is off the road, either you have to Google or hear about this cafe from your friend/family.
Pros - food is awesome. The taste, the presentation is very good. Ambience is also very good. Didn't found the place crowded (may be because it was afternoon). Also free wifi is an icing on the cake. Their Italian dishes are superb.
Cons - costly, serving took some time but it was ok since if you want to gossip then that  waiting time doesn't matter much.

I just love wise owl. It's one of my favorite hang out spots. My favorite every now and then order is the spaghetti bolognaise, its so delicious that you'd want to order another one for sure. Also, the ham sandwich and coffee preparations are nice. The only problem of this place is its really hard to find seats because its usually very crowded and also they serve the food really late. Otherwise its actually a cool place to go to. :) They also have a good icecream cola drink!

This cafe has the typical ambiance that a laid back cafe should have. Also the outdoor seating arrangement during winter can be really nice. That is about it with this place. Nothing else about this place is good. Slow and laid back service is sometimes a good thing but to be very frank the staff are more laid back than the ambiance. They took way too long to serve just out drinks. The food came much....much....much later. The company was good and hence so was the conversations but to my mind conversations can be good even over coffee and bits to nibble on. Waiting for eternity can be off putting. Finally when the food did arrive to our dismay it was bad. The drinks though were not too bad. The experience definitely was bad. Thankfully Mrs. Magpie was just a block away.

I have been to Wise-Owl twice with my South Calcutta friends. It is quite alright with its smoke-free interior and its open-air smoking zone. I like the cozy atmosphere of the place and it makes me more at ease compared to the tea-party-ish look of Mrs Magpie. What I do not like here is the time between order and delivery. 

Coming to the food, I had ordered a jasmine tea and my friend had ordered a black coffee and we were both quite satisfied. Food-wise, I quite liked their chicken sandwich which my friend and I shared a plate of.

Overall, I would say you can visit this place if you want a non-CCD approach (same stuff I had recommended for Mrs. Magpie)!!!

okay again firstly and most importantly when you are going here make sure you are going only there and don't have any other later occupations because they are slower than snails!!!
however, i can guarantee that you are in for some great food and a lot of fun. the day we went to this place the entire city was flooded due to heavy rain and so we were completely drenched. i mentioned this as this further added to our experience there. ambience is great, loved the decor and the fact that they have outdoor as well as indoor seating places. The indoor seating area is more cosy though. i admit the srvice was really slow but the waiters are not dumb as a prior review mentioned. WE spent 3hrs in the cafe............the maximum time i have ever spent in any restaurant! the food is EXCELLENT!! Too good to be true. The ham steak burger's size was disappointing though, I had hoped it to be filling enough, but nevertheless the taste was excellent!!! I generally like red sauce pasta and this was the first time i had had a non veg red sauce pasta, but i was shocked that the white sauce pasta was much better in taste. ok, MUST TRY: brownie with ice cream..........ohhhhh just the thoght of it makes my mouth salivate....it is heavenly, i'm a savoury person so this brownie was exceptionally well hence my appreciation for it...........the salads are really nice and so is the shwarma roll.........
over all, I luved wise owl and will definitely go back............if you are a foodie then wise owl is a must visit!!!!

Its a wonderful place to hang around, grab a cup of coffee & sit for hours, ambiance..... one of the best in town compared to other cafes...i liked the fish paprika sauce & the fish finger there. All foodies must go there for breakfast, the garlic bread & the cheese omlette is worth it. 

The only drawback is the service, you have to keep on asking "Mera order kab ayega bhai"

Very cute place with lovely porch where you can sit and spend some me-time over a fag before you enter the sit-and-dine space. Sober lights and cool graphics on the wall promise to make your mornings or evenings definitely more interesting. To be precise, I love chilling out with my friends here and have enough reasons for it.  

Now, the next big thing is service which is downright poor over here. You have to sit like for hours before they serve you what you've ordered. And well, the waiters do not even seem interested enough for reasons not known. 

Coming to the most important part now, the food. I'll go one by one about it for your convenience.

Prawn croquettes wrapped in bacon- Juicy, batter fried prawns wrapped in smoked bacon strips. Too yummy to be true. 

Pancakes- For authentic pancakes and if you haven't had one yet, this is a cool place to start. They serve these soft, fat pancakes doused in chocolate sauce, honey or maple syrup, however it pleases your taste buds.

Meat Lovers Sandwich- Now, we're gradually entering the danger zone. There are few dishes here at this cafe that gets you addicted to this place and this sandwich is one of them. you get what I mean? 

Egg and Cheese sandwich- Baked or scrambled egg or they could even make the sunny side up for you sandwiched between fat layers of cheese and bread. Delicious I must say.

Ham Steak Burger in BBQ sauce- The danger zone list that I was talking about. This burger tops the list. Tender, succulent and spiced burger patty at its best, and you get a lot of French Fries, cheers!

The Breakfast Combo I find more feasible than going for single or separate dishes, also this is a very cool idea in a city like Calcutta where there is serious dearth of good breakfast places. Check out this place for sure, but keep pushing the waiter for a faster service.

Apart from the food and ambience what really draws me to a restaurant or a cafeteria is its décor. Wise Owl stands out in its distinctive décor with a huge Owl wall painting at the entrance. Inside you find owl artefacts in possible forms and shapes beautifully displayed in a showcase. The ambience is cozy, lackadaisical yet tasteful. The macaroni salad is heavenly, team it with a mocktail or select from the range of tea or coffee your evening snacks is complete. Do try the Floating honeymoon mocktail for its unique taste. You can either choose to sit inside or chill out your friends in the open balcony which is a smozing zone. But Wise Owl needs to work on its service speed which is at a snail pace! So if you are looking for a quick bite then drop your plans!

I like Wise Owl.

Reasonably priced (or a little on the higher side), wonderfully located, near Gariahat, yet the street is not that busy. I like the ambience, specially the porch in winter. The food is more of a comfort food. I like their soups - specially the bacon and leek soup. The tomato-basil was wonderful one day, but not so much on a second day. But when we complained they immidiately took it back and came back with a properly prepared one.

I love their sandwich and a special mention to their Maggi (it was funny to see Maggi in a menu) - the mushroom and the chicken chilli garlic is absolutely stunning. I have tried their breakfast menus too. The bacon was good, the omelette was soft and mushroom on toast was great.

Most importantly their coffee is really good.

I haven't been there for dinner. I might one day.

The best-looking cafe in Kolkata, this, though the same can't said about the food.
What catches the eye is the use of the owl motif in wall paintings (a motif considered to be in contemporary kitsch) and white-painted wooden fence, that raises expectations to a real high.

The items to be had at this cafe are also the most popular- coffee , sandwiches, pasta, burgers, and other finger food.
The items to be avoided- iced tea, rice courses, pizza, mocktails.

If you have a lot of leisure time to catch up with old friends and deep pockets, visit Wise Owl as it can be quite hard on your purse strings.

Best cafe in town!

The best cafe in town, may be not so much for the food, but surely for the classy ambience. Very laidback and delayed waiting which is good for the conversationists. The place is always packed with a long queue in the evening. Menu offers great variety and prices are really low. What would cost 350 here would make a staggering bill of 1700 at Starbucks. They use Twinnings tea-bags in their teas. If coffee is your thing, have the wise owl special cappuccino. You must avoid the lemon iced tea which has lost its earlier zing and tastes very bitter these days. The muffins are always great. They have stopped selling the cookies, a regret. A good indulgence would be the ‘Avalanche’, a big bowl of chocolate mousse and vanilla ice cream with a dash of chocolate sauce. They serve great breakfast too, which one must order by 11 am as they are quite strict with the time.

Among the many upcoming cafes in the city which claim to provide a distinctive ambience both in terms of food and decor, Wise Owl stands out at least on the latter count. I admit to having visited it for the first time not because I'd heard good things about the food but because it looked pretty in the pictures I'd seen of it. 

The white picket fence and the abundant use of the owl motif notwithstanding, this place was a bit of a let down. It has been noisy and overcrowded every time I've been there. A decent conversation cannot be expected, which is especially annoying because service is particularly slow. The tables on the outside are better spaced than the ones on the inside and are also a better option if you have bigger company but are definitely not recommendable during summer.

The burgers and sandwiches seemed to be the bestsellers, so you can expect them to be consistently good. They also take lesser time to be served than the other dishes and are worth their price. I've never tried the specials, even though they've looked quite delicious on the menu, mostly having to do with prawns or crabs but are also a major drain on the packet. 

The risotto is not to be tried. The lasagna is quite good and very filling, as are the pasta dishes. The grilled fish with lemon as well as the baked fish are lighter but the fish always seems a tad bit overcooked. Salads are generously proportioned, the starters are not. They have a healthy deal of vegetarian dishes to offer. the vegetarian lasagna is just as good as the non vegetarian one. 

The worst part of their menu, apart from the risotto is their mocktail section. They have the corniest names and you'd be surprised to find how literal the names are. So 'Floating Honeymoon' refers to a big blob of vanilla icecream (the moon) dripping honey that is floating in the drink. 

This place is one of the few affordable cafes that provide a proper breakfast section; a special mention owed ot their pancakes. 

I've been there a number of times and although the food isn't particularly great or a 'wise' monetary pick, I find myself suffering from bouts of wanting to return to it.

I really liked the ambience: that of a cozy, warm coffee shop. They’ve got outdoor seating, a nice owl graffiti and all of it adds up to a nice evening hangout.  However, most of the food on the menu is too heavy for an evening snack and there isn’t enough coffee (or other beverages) on the menu.  (I visited last evening and the menu was not the same as what I see on Zomato now) 
Food was definitely good, but nothing you’d remember the place by (We just ordered some coffees, Garlic Bread and desserts).
 Service was fine – we didn’t have a bad experience as some of the reviewers did.
The place is slightly overpriced  (Maggi for 90 bucks  ) and “400 for 2 people“(as given in the restaurant details above)  is definitely way off mark – its closer to 700-800 for 2 people.
So basically the ambience is awesome ut everything else is average.
It’s worth a visit or two but with so many other hole-in-the-wall places springing up in that area that  offer better food at a better price and in a better ambience they need to up their game a bit.

Wise Owl - Needs a lesson in humility.

I have been living in Bangalore for the last 1 and a half years and have truly been pampered by the good food and cheap price at lounges there, so when a friend recommended it I set out with really high hopes. I was severally disappointed.

Decor and Service -
Terrible service, the waiters were snobbish and unapproachable, with very little knowledge about the menu. They did not know what ham is or what bacon is which was so disappointing. They have a very long wait time and are highly understaffed. I was getting very frustrated with the wait for my food. 
The decor on the inside is plain and poorly done with any resemblance to the name coming from the small owls in glass shelves. The outside was better with beautiful wall paintings. The decor was really poorly done overall with the menu a pathetic piece of laminated paper. 
 
Food - 
The most disgusting food i have had in a long time. Poorly made food with no creativity, finesse or flavor whatsoever.
I order the HAM and BACON pizza only to discover that it was one of the two toppings and they chose to give ham. I found a  bone in my pizza. I was infuriated but decided not make a big deal of it and just leave the place as soon as possible.
The Spaghetti Algio Olio was noodles in Olive oil with no taste whatsoever and the garlic bread hard as a rock and no garlic flavour.The drink i ordered was Strawberry Shake and to be honest a 5 year old would have made it better at home. 
The quantity was quite less and the prices quite high in comparison.

Opinion - Don't approach this place with a 10 foot rod, it truly bad IMO.

Situated at a great location on Purna Das Road, this quaint little cafe has both, an air-conditioned and an open air seating arrangement. The decor inside is nothing spectacular, but neat little cane chairs and tables. There is a wall graffiti outside, which looks pretty, and adds to the charm of this simple cafe. 

Probably that is all that is good about this place. We visited this place for lunch, at around 12.30PM. We ordered Chicken Cheese Rolls and Non-Veg Platter (from the Today's Special menu) for starters, Ham Risotto and Chicken Casiotora for main course, along with a Green Apple Soda and a Fresh Lime Soda. 

And then started the GREAT WAIT. We waited till 1.15 PM when the two drinks arrived on our table. One sip of the Green Apple Soda and it left me wondering how can this simple item taste so dull. It was not chilled, no ice cubes, no fizz. It left me disappointed rather than refreshed. The Fresh Lime Soda even more disappointing with it being nothing but some lemon flavoured Tang/Rasna powder mixed in slightly cold water. After asking for the starters a couple of times, it was served finally, after almost an hour of ordering. The chicken cheese rolls were nice, with hot cheese oozing out with every bite. We were finally happy. But the happiness was not long lasting. The Non-veg platter was a huge disaster. It had chicken nuggets, potato smilies and french fries (yes, it WAS supposed to be a NON-VEG platter) - all which were frozen and fried and served. No salad, no dip. Horribly disappointing. 

The main course came another half an hour later. We were pretty enraged by that time. We were in the cafe for almost 2 hrs and just half way through. The Risotto was just OK, with very less ham. I have had much better ones in other places. Chicken Casiotora was more like a shredded chicken curry ladled over a heap of herbed rice. Not something I will ever try again.

Finally after a LONG lunch that left us somewhat unsatisfied, we left the cafe deciding to never come back. I shall suggest this place to people who have lots of time to spare and would like a lazy cup of coffee over a good book. But if you want to grab a quick meal, this is not the place you should choose. 

P.S - They do not serve water, you need to buy it, or carry your own bottle. Yes, I hate that.

I heard a lot about Wise Owl from my friends living in South Kolkata. As I happen to go to that part of the city pretty often for my work, I thought of paying a visit to this "happening" place. It could not satisfy the taste buds of a foodie like me. I have been to Wise Owl like for three times now and every time my expectations were crushed because of the extremely slow and poor service. Spending a lazy afternoon or evening with your friends does not mean a lazy service either. If you end up at Wise Owl hungry, you would just starve to death because of their sloth-like service. There is no warmth in the place. 

Okay, Now let us come to the food served. It is very average. Nothing out of the world. It is just ordinary. I liked the chocolate shake and the chicken caesar salad. But it is just okay. The sandwiches were very dry.  You wont crave for it again and again. Prices are a bit at the higher side but it is not worth the money with such an average quality of food when there are better food joints in and around that place. So, I don't recommend this place for a food lover.

Perhaps an example of a bad food joint in such a good area. First thing first, the service is unimaginably pathetic and ignorant. At the time we reached the place, only a couple of tables were occupied. The service people saw us and went inside the kitchen or staff room at the back. It was not less than 15 minutes when we finally decided to go the back and call them for the menu card. And there we made the mistake because the food we paid for was real pathetic. The peach iced tea was like sugar syrup, the pasta was like hakka noodles and the grilled chicken was a riot of salt!! Horribly overpriced and very bad in taste. Also the 130 rs veg soup we ordered was served in such small quantity it seemed they imagine themselves as 5 star hotel outlet. And top of that the soup tasted ordinary. So to sum up things, its a place best avoided.

Wise Owl is one place I have visited on umpteen occassions. The motivation behind is not the fact that there's no other cafe as good as this one but that the laid back ambience got me hooked. Also, those of my friends addicted to smoking enjoy the seating  arrangement outside where they can fag comfortable while enjoying their cuppa.

The ambience is nothing to write home about but is pretty decent with cane chairs and quite a variety of owl mementos adding to the decor. They have recently had a major price hike with the addition of a good number of dishes in the menu. The menu n zomato needs to be updated for the same reason.

Coming to food we usually stick to dajeeling or assam tea, filter coffee, cappuchino and cafe latte as none us are fans of fancy mocktails. The coffee served are refreshing and so are the teas. Food quality varies depending on the items ordered. The grilled chicken in mushroom sauce which we mostly order is delicious . Succulent pieces of well cooked chicken breasts smothered in delicious mushroom sauce accompanied with sauteed veggies and mashed potato give the right kick to our tastebuds. The pasta arabiatta was disastrous however. The pasta was undercooked with no sauce to speak of and minuscule morseld of chicken. The chicken burger tasted amazing though with a large chicken patty and melted cheese, it is served with fries and ketchup on the side. My friend loved it and has been ordering it everytime he visits this place. Coming to the fish fingers, they tasted pretty well too anf the tartar sauce served as a perfect accompaniment to the crispy fish fingers. Thus, the food items are a hit or miss. We stick to items we found tasty while going through the trial and error method.

The service is pretty laid back, slow to be honest. However, since we hit this place after work when we are actually in the mood to relax and chit chat that is not much of a con to us. Overall, I quite like this place and would keep on visiting it until something better comes up in the vicinity.

Disgusting place to be honest. Good location, bad overpriced food. Ordered peach iced tea, never knew it can be prepared to in such horrible taste, felt like drinking sugar syrup. Then grilled chicken was a riot of salt. And lastly pasta too (which is always a good bet) was served in hakka style, completely dry. The worst thing of all is the ignorant and "do not care" attitude of the management. Should be avoided in terms of food.

Okay I know everyone raves about this place but it did not impress me that much. To be honest it is an amazing hangout place where you can chill out with your friends but the food and ESPECIALLY the service does NOT match up to the hype.
I went here for breakfast and we ordered the smoothies, toasted breads,ham sandwich, bacon and cheese omlet, pork sausages, and a choco blast sundae. We wanted to order pancakes but we were told that it would take time. Well, so did the other things to come. The service is incredibly slow. The waiters are ignorant and from the looks of it do not take their jobs seriously at all!. So after waiting a good forty five minutes our food came. It was good, nothing exceptional. The ham and cheese sandwich had two slices of ham and cheese. Cheese NOT MELTED. The omlette was really good and tasty although the tomato on the side was weird. The sausages were well average. It's good to give them a miss. Small tiny pieces. The smoothies were good. Again nothing exceptional. The desert again average, just scoops of ice cream with chocolate sauce , nothing special.
The only thing that was good was that I got to meet Anand Gandhi here ! The director of Ship of Thesus. :D
This place requires a visit when you are too lazy to make your own breakfast as trust me the food is nothing that you can't make it on your own at your own home easily !

Pros:
Food is better than that at Cafe Coffee Day and similar hangouts. After all it is with a hotel.
I liked the cozy ambience, looks like other reviewers did not
The caramel custard is fresh made, not from powder
Decent prices and quantity
Club sandwich amount is large, and better than that of other coffee shop chains

Cons:
No fresh juices, all canned, which some over the top reviewers have given over the top name calling to. 
Some items are made from frozen food, like the french fries. Bread appears to be regular grocery store bread.
Some items in menu are not available

Contrary to other reviews, the waiters are polite, but do not wait on you. You need to make special effort.
I ordered fish and chips, and the fish was not beer/soda battered. I did not care for the indian type batter, however, the item was decent. 

I will definitely drop in just for a casual bite, and may even recommend the freshly made items.

well what can i say??i am still searching for words to describe my stupidity for stepping in the cafe and ordering for foods..lewt me jot down the points quickly so that my fellow foodies can get an idea about this place..
SERVICE..far from cordial and friendly..rather reluctant..when i was there a gentleman was putting a fresh coat of paint on the wall and i had to suffer the horrific experience of having my food in that pungent smell...
AMBIENCE...nothing classy at all..simple cane chairs and very small wooden square tables...
FOOD..pathetically small in quantity..few strings of bacons and even fewer slices of sausages are called a complete dishes there..
PRICE..overwhelmingly high,though i am yet to figure out why..neither the decor nor the food has the right to demand such prices..
VERDICT..a strict NO-GO zone unless you have some spare money itching in your wallet and want to indulge yourself in a charitable mood...as the name suggests WISE OWL is basically a place to make FOOL of the customers..no wonder the place used to be a restaurant named CHARCOAL  before and after closing that down they have opened this new venture to con foodies in newer methods..sorry for writing such a harsh review but truth is bitter many times...

One rainy Friday evening four of us gal pals decided to check out Wise Owl. It was my fourth attempt to visit the place. The first three times I did not find seats. This time I was super excited about the fact that I did. 

Wise owl has an outer open air section where smoking is allowed. It also gives a French twist to the cafe. Even the inside of the cafe is decorated to look like it is on the side of a street. I see it as a waste of space, but then that is just me. Location-wise this cafe is bang opposite Shibani on Purna Das Road.

Among the four of us we ordered two diet cokes, a green apple soda, ham sandwich, one plate of french fries and an avalanche.  We entered the cafe at around 4:20 p.m.  We were too busy talking and laughing and admiring the rain to notice that the food was not coming. At around 5 p.m  a waiter came and served us the french fries. I asked him about the rest of the food. He told me "Taiar ho raha hai". To that I asked him if even the Diet Coke was in the process of "Taiar Ho Raha Hai" ? To that he did not reply and simply walked away. Here I must add that they have a glass counter and that shelf is stocked with mostly diet coke cans. At around 5:20 p.m. I finally went up to the counter and asked them if I could have the Diet coke. They again replied that "taiar ho raha hai". I then pointed at the Diet Coke and told them that as far as I know Diet Coke usually are bottled as ready to consume drinks. At that point the server handed me two lukewarm cans of Diet Coke with which I walked back. After 10 more minutes he gave us four glasses. Then I asked him if we could have some water. He put down a bottle of Bisleri. I told him that normal water was fine. Again no response and he simply just walked away. At that time even the counter was unattended so I could not really go up to the counter and say something. 

I HATE this culture where restaurants force you to buy water. They cannot do it by law. I think every restaurant who does this should be severely reprimanded. 

They finally served us all the food a little before 6 p.m. And yes they did server the sandwich the green apple soda and the avalanche at the same time. A restaurant where the servers don't even realize the difference between snacks and desserts have a problem.

Now coming to the food. The Green Apple Soda was the worst thing that I ever tasted in my life. It tasted like dead rat juice. It was vile. I actually wiped my tongue with tissues after taking a sip. On the other hand the french fries where the best french fries I have had in this city. They were crispy and were coated with lemon pepper salt which gave it tangy x-factor. They were awesome. The ham sandwich had too much butter which was overwhelming the taste of the ham but the ham itself was of very good quality. The avalanche was strictly okay taste-wise and pretty impressive quantity-wise. 

I think this place got all the hype as it was new and gave the provision to cigarette lovers of the city to relive the days when you could smoke and drink your tea/coffee. It also has the potential to serve good tasty food. All my 2.5 points are for the food. But they seriously need to improve their service. Because sooner than later a new cafe is going to crop up at some other part of the city providing the customers with the liberty to smoke and serve good food. Then it is the service that is going to make a difference.

I write this review as I am sitting at the cafe. service is terribly slow...been 20 minutes and have not got as little as an acknowledgment. Grabbed the attention of the waiter n all I got was "5 minutes"....he seems to only have concentration for 3 tables at a time...cannot rate anything but the decor and ambience which is nice. maybe I will get a chance to try something next time. that is, if im convinced to return....I would rather take my business to somewhere that cares

Wise owl cafe was introduced to me by a friend, and I must say I am glad it was. Almost. The café is adorable and the food is so great that it is almost unreal! However, the service is so horribly slow that you can watch four Bollywood movies by the time you get your food. Drunk tortoises walking on gum would be faster than the service here. I've been there thrice and I swear, the service only gets slower! I would happily go there every week if they could spend some time and energy in employing some more people instead of collecting owl showpieces.  
While the service is a definite con, the food is a pro. The food is so good that it beckons your taste buds, seduces it and leaves you wanting for more. 
Do visit, but only if you have lots and lots and lots of time to spare. Because trust me, I mean it when I say they are slow.

after going through all the reviews ,i didnt find anything interesting to visit the place except the name.
the name wise owl was a good curiosity for me and for it i wanted to give it a visit.
and what. .i liked the place. every restaurant has its own character and this has it s own, with all its pros n cons.
it is a small restaurant ,serving mainly continental food. the scarcity of the staffs make it almost a self serviced restaurant.
yes it takes a lot time to serve but thats not a cons because continental food do take time for preparation in oven.
this also becomes a positive point,because the late servings gives you plenty of time to sit and chit chat.
The staffs are not that knowledgable about food and theres no point of asking for their guidance about food.
 it has two part- one outside non ac part,where people can fag and another ac part.
coming to the food, i orderd lasagna . it took a bit time but it was very well made with layers of white and red sauce with plenty of cheese.
the interior is neat and clean. i dont regret to be here and would love to be there if i m near it.
overall its a good place to have quality conti food without burning a hole in ur purse.

very few times in today's world a place comes out to surprise you. on suggestion of a couple of friends i went ahead and visited wise owl which is like 1 min from my house. 

i was fairly surprised with the European concept they have going there. the food took time to come as it does in the cafes b ut then the wait was so worth it. 

From the siciliana to the risotto to the egg sandwich to the ice tea. it was a run of tasting bliss as every bite sung of freshness and authentic cooking. 

the arrabiata was just above average but the rest of the food was just top notch.

Just waiting for them to start wine and beer. and then this place will be one of my frequent visits restaurant.

i for one will defiantly go there again.

Having heard diverse reviews about this place I was wanting to try this place for a long time now.Ultimately,I visited this place with a friend a couple of days back.
Location: very convenient.It is about 3-5 minutes walk along purna das road from gol park crossing.
The Menu: The place is mainly a continental cafe,serving mostly what one would call finger food like sandwiches,burgers,fish fingers etc along with pasta items and a few continental main course items.The place also offers desserts and shakes.The menu though quite decent has room for improvement.
The food: We had ordered fish finger,pan fried chicken and chicken tetrazini.All the items were really well made and tasty.The fish finger was nice and crisp and served with a decent amount of tartar sauce which I really liked.The chicken tetrazini was also much better than what I had expected.We also ordered a cold coffee in the end which was also quite good.
The price: very reasonable.We had ordered four items and the total bill came to be around 750 which is quite reasonable.
The service: I was warned before hand of the pathetic service provided.I went there expecting the worse.Probably because of my low expectations,I did not feel too let down.But,yes it took a long long time for the food to arrive.The waiters seemed quite uninterested.
The ambience: The place offers both indoor and outdoor seating facility.The space is not that large.I felt the tables were a bit too close to each other.But overall the decor and ambience is quite good and attractive.This may not be a place for fine dining but it is quite a perfect place for hanging out with friends.
Apart from these,another thing which is worth mentioning about this place is that they do not serve plain drinking water.They only serve packaged drinking water and hence it is chargeable.This I feel is quite unacceptable and something that I wish is corrected.
Overall,this is a very decent place to hang out with friends providing good food and good ambience at reasonable prices.But the service needs to improve.

I stepped into this place to catch up with friends and was pleasantly surprised by the décor and the presence of outside seating arrangement. It was raining outside and the place seemed perfect for an adda fortified with chai, foodies and the background music of the rain pattering on the tree leaves outside. Not sure how much convenient the outside sitting arrangement would be on a dry sultry afternoon/evening but on that particular rainy evening, it was a heavenly place to be in. 

There's also place inside for all those who prefer to sit in solitude, engulfed by the blast from the air-conditioners. 

As regards the food, I found the tit-bits to be quite delicious. The fish used for making fish-fingers was nice and soft and melted in the mouth. So was the grilled fish which we had ordered as a main-course meal later in the evening. The chicken lasagne was also "melt-in-the-mouth" stuff. I had ordered two rounds of Darjeeling tea and the aroma of the tea added to the feel good factor of the place.

The waiters do tend to leave you to yourself, not bothering much about your presence unless you force them to pay attention to you. 

Overall a nice place for an adda!

This place is always full or rather full on most of the days  because they have really small seating arrangement.
The best thing about this place is the superb location!  And the good things end there.
When I visit a cafe I expect a bit of good food too along with the decor, ambience etc but wise owl disappoints and like HOW!!
They can even screw up Maggi or basic fish fingers! Cold Coffee is served in a new watery base form, where you can smell the coffee but won't be able to taste it!
So nothing good about this place until and unless you don't care about the food and want to sit back relax and chat with screaming teenagers around...Well...in case you do get a spot free! !

Well i have been to this place a lot of times, mostly to catch-up with friends and not so much for the food. Today was one such day. The open-air section is almost at all times full, and you don't have much chances of getting a seat there unless it is a weekday afternoon. 
We ordered a meat lovers sandwich, a chicken caesar salad, a chicken macaroni salad and a chocolate muffin. The first one was really good, i mean really really good. After a long time i got good proper sandwiches at a coffee shop. But i was terribly disappointed with the caesar salad - the greens were wilted, too many tomato slivers, just 4 thin dry bread toast strips (instead of proper crunchy croutons) and almost no dressing. however the macaroni salad (which came after a wait of 45 mins) was better but nothing extraordinary and certainly not worth the wait. And then the came the muffin which was not even warmed up, and it tasted of cheap cocoa powder and was more bitter than sweet. 
But to be fair, would also like to mention that their shakes and egg burger are not bad, which i had tried on earlier visits. Also it is a good place to just sit and indulge in adda over a cup of coffee if you are tired of CCDs.

Seeing the great reviews on Zomato we were really psyched about going there but then this place was quite a let down. Food is very okayish and portions are small. And you have to yell at the waiter to clean the table, to get the orders.
This place shouldn't be high on anybody's priority list.

The first time I went there in a group of 4, after reminding the waiters about our food for about half an hour at an interval of 5-10 minutes or so we got them. The food was pretty decent. The drinks were okay too. The ham steak burger was meh, my friend ordered some pasta dish which was good, the fries and nachos were okay.
Since it has free wifi I went there again with another friend to talk over some things and we needed the internet. We got busy talking after placing the order. The orange juice came out of a can (as understood from the taste) and the chocolate shake was nothing to write to anyone about. Then the fun began. After an hour we kept asking both the waiters about the chicken wings we had ordered. The guy we ordered to looked dazed and confused and the other one kept grunting at him with frustration. After half an hour more we decided to leave as we were getting late. We got up to the counter to make sure they don't keep us waiting for another hour for the bill and also to make sure it is not the wrong one. When they offered to pack the wings we vociferously shook our heads as we wanted to flee as fast as possible.
This place has hope. Places with worse food get by better for having cheaper prices and faster delivery if not better service. The bad service bogs it down.
P.S - Went there for a meeting 2 days ago (December, 2013) again and I wanted to mention here we got the orders taken and got the food with no excessive arm flinging. The meat lovers club sandwich was good, the coffees were okay. The service has improved, not massively but still it has.

Well, the place is super awesome!!!
The cozy outdoor and the laid back atmosphere is a constant hit for one and all.The indoor ambiance is a bit noisy and stuffed up due to the all time crowd it faces.Its difficult to get a place there, and may be you have to wait for a while.But overall, its a nice place to hang out with friends and have long talks.
Next, the quality of food they serve is good.Specially I love there penne alfredo pasta(chicken).Garlic breads are great.Chocolate shakes and juices are also satisfactory.But the white sauce or maybe the mayo which they put in there burgers and other stuffs is too watery and messy at times, it spoils the taste :(
The quantity they serve is enough and filling.
Though the service is slow, but the good behaviour of the waiter boys compensates for it!
All in all you will not be disheartened.
The place is very much recommended for all the teenagers.
For I had a very relaxing and refreshing experience out there with my friends.

I liked the place as well as the crowd. Had ordered Jasmine tea - which came in sachets in cups and a pot of hot water - that's always disappointing. The same seems much nicer when brewed in a pot and served... 

Tried the club sandwich and fish fingers. Fair. 

But I want to go there again for adda - the place seems warm, the service is decent.

We went there for a Sunday morning breakfast. We were looking forward to going there for awhile because very few places in Kolkata outside fancy hotels offer a standard western style breakfast. While the menu looked promising - different kinds of omlettes, sausages, bacon, eggs in different style, the service left much to be desired. The menu offers a standard non-veg breakfast combo which we thought would be the easiest thing to order. The waiter first had to go back and check if any of the ham/sausage/bacon options were even available. The bacon was not. Then the combo came with herbed potatos/boiled veggies. The waiter said the herbed potatos would take 30 minutes which was absurd. He suggested we junk the combo and get the a la carte options. We wanted to know why advertise a combo at all. We asked for the combo minus the potatos. Eventually it came with the potatos but minus a knife to spread the butter. While the service was not unfriendly, it was annoying that a fairly simple/standard breakfast order was so complicated to get. It's not like we ordered the mushroom pancake which was unavailable. Very disappointing. "Why don't you get sandwiches?" the waiter told us. Because we wanted to have BREAKFAST!

Wise Owl! Wise Old Owl! very very innovative in its name and branding! and I just love the Owl's collection out there in display! The Ambience is just right if one has loads of time at hand and doesn't mind waiting. The outdoor setting and the picket fences adds to the charm of the place.. first Service:- very slow.. one needs  to order and then wait for it to arrive. I ordered for tea with muffins and it came after some twenty minutes. We ordered food which  the staff said would take 20 minutes to serve came after some jolly good 35 mins later.. Really need to pull up your socks here..Food:- The chicken sandwich we ordered was good.. french fries have to be hot and seasoned.. otherwise they become soggy. The best is Pasta Alfredo. We also tried Chicken Tetrazinni which was also good.. A cup of tea is a bit highly priced  though.. Very good location, honest intentions, fairly good menu... a little bit of quick service and charm can take this place a long way..

Wise Owl.

The 2 points out of 5 are entirely because of the ambience. There are table settings outside (under the shade) as well as inside the shop. The place, though relatively small with regard to seating capacity, is artfully decorated keeping in mind its own name. In terms of the menu that they offer and the variety of items in it, there is a need to innovate. The prices on the menu are exclusive of taxes. The only kind of drinking water available is packaged, hence chargeable. Severely understaffed, the place offers service that is the worst of its kind.

On an early evening, my friend and I decided on going to Wise Owl and this is what we had, in no particular order:
(1) Avalanche: It is supposed to be chocolate cake lavishly coated in vanilla icecream, chocolate sauce and the like. We loved everything about it till we dug into the cake. It was dense, dry, disappointing and partly inedible. 
(2) French Fries: One plate is abundantly laden with fries. It wasn't appropriately seasoned nor was it as hot as we'd have liked it to be. Though bland, it was the best dish of the order.
(3) Nachos with Cheese and Salsa dip: It was the most disappointing dish. The Cheese dip was horrible. It seemed less like cheese and more like watery melted butter. It alone ruined the dish. The Salsa dip could've been better. The Nachos were as good as the ones you can purchase from vendors. 

The bill came to 323 rupees and I wasn't content, parting with the money.

Bottom-line: It's a good place to spend a few hours in, when in the area, considering how laidback and uninterested the waiters are.

one recommendation: try chicken lasagna...u get minced chicken and veggies in layers of red and white sauce separated by pasta sheets,and baked with layer of cheese on top.its extremely delicious!

Can't bother to give any rating to this unhygienic crappy hub at one of the most posh areas of South Kolkata. Ordered Fish Finger - Stale, off and rotten fish was served and ofcourse we couldn't eat that. When we complained the cashier who acted as the manager , he asked us whether we want to change that in a very happy and shameless manner. When I complained about their awful state of food, he kept smiling. I asked him how can any place charge for rotten food. He kept smiling. SHAMELESS and definitely don't know BUSINESS.... This place should be checked by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India immediately to save people from falling sick. Their Wise Owl Special Cappuccino & Brownie just reminded us of one word - YUCK !  More than this shameless coffee shop, we should blame all food and coffee lovers for even giving any good reviews to this place. Some of the reviews here made me wonder - do these people have any taste bud and sense left in them? WISE OWL - you cannot run your business by fooling customers and playing with their health.  I am going to report this to the appropriate authority for immediate action !  In a word, there is nothing and no one "WISE" at "WISE OWL"  Dont bother to visit this place ever !

I visited this coffee shop today while returning to office from a client call. Must say that the location is indeed very convenient. As i approached, i liked the look of the place (specially the open area outside). Instantly wondered what it would be like to sit there sipping tea during heavy rains :) 
We sat at a table outdoors. Shockingly the waiter approached us at least after 10 minutes of waiting. By this time we asked the security guard whether we had to go to the counter and place the order (Self service ie.) . The poor fellow kept knocking on the glass door to get attention of the service staff inside  to show them that a new table (us) had arrived. :)
We ordered for two cups of tea and one cold beverage when the waiter finally came. I insisted that i would like to have a mint flavored cold beverage, instead of which this gentleman offered me a mint based cold coffee which i refused (b'coz normally i am a tea drinker, certainly not a coffee drinker). It took me some effort to explain what i wanted, which he understood only after a while.
The drinks took ages to arrive. We could see about five tables being occupied (not counting ours) and only 2(maybe3) guys working at that time. Grossly short staffed i would say ! 
We were also very disappointed with our drinks (both Darjeeling tea as well as the "supposedly" mint flavored soda ). I would like to mention that i am regular (literally) at different cafes in south kolkata. 

I had certainly heard many wonderful things about this place. But my very first experience made me think that it was perhaps not meant for people who want to take a quick sip (en route to office on a busy week day). 

Only regret ............ forgot to tip the guy who did not disappoint us -  that security guard.
 ................ sorry!

my score - 2/5

if you are looking for a break from ccd and barista, wise owl is the place to be...
the ambiance is very good, so is the crowd, and its a perfect place to hangout with friends.
In spite of the fact that service is a bit slow, the food is delicious, and so, you won't regret waiting for that 10-15mins extra, before you are being served...
cafe mocha, the wide range of pastas, and fries are just too good.. and if you feel like splurging more, try out the grilled chicken and the bacon wrapped prawns, which is one of their signature dishes!!
happpy eating :)

Giving this a score as a formality. This restaurant doesn't even deserve that.  Definitely my worst restaurant experience in a long long long time..reached there by 9.15 when the inside place was starting to fill up. we ordered 1 fiery chicken wings which the waiter recommended along with a garlic bread , a pizza and a chocolate shake. The wings were fiery indeed. it was chicken and red chillies and just that... and that was the best of the lot !!!!! The shake was very warm and the garlic bread and pizza very cold. sent it backto correct them..shake and garlic bread was quite ordinary, but the pizza was inedible !! They took it back but were unapologetic about it. We ordered another garlic bread which didn't come for over 25 mins..had to finally leave and the order was still not in site. .hopeless service !!! sub-standard food! no one in their right mind should go there.

If you are going to wise owl at any given point of the day make sure you have plenty of time in hand. The service is extremely slow. The last time I went there we wanted an extra chair, the staff very conviniently said we don't hv any when there were plently which were used by women to put their bags. The outside seating arrangement is full of people playing music n ordering just few cups of tea. We requested the waiters to take our order since we did not have much choice but they never turned up. We were left with no other choice than to walk out. Now coming to the food its not bad. Quantity is good but the amount of time you need to wait for your food to arrive you will be in no state to give an honest opinion about how it tastes. Wise owl seriously needs to recruit more staff. Time is money these days and not all people are jobless.

If review required only one word, it would be PATHETIC.

Early morning, a handful of customers, and such slow, unprofessional service. After so many complaints posted here I understand that it's no use asking owners to train their staff, as the owners don't give a damn, they still get the business, for Kolkata is not Mumbai, and the fight for customers has not arrived. "Crib as much as you want, just pay me your money"- this is what they think.

  Measly installments, stretched over an hour- that's how our order was served to us, and final cappuccino has arrived just right when we were getting up to pay the bill and leave. Kya timing hai! Beautiful!

That aside, the quality of the food is just bordering on very average. The ostensibly Frech Fries served with my omelette were a stack of brown, grease-soaked crumbles and debris, sandwiches had too much butter. The rest of dishes- ok.

 Will I visit again? No, not even if it's the last place to eat out left in Kolkata. I don't like people who despise their customers and simply take money from of them - and this is exactly what owners of Wise Owl do, by maintaining such low standards of service despite overall dissatisfaction.

This was by far my most pathetic experience.... I ordered a burger and a cold coffee.. The burger was pathetic.... The patty cold, the veggies ancient and the fries were soggy. To top it all the cold coffee was warm. Enter at your own peril..... Would have preferred to give a negative rating but the option is not here.

Nice place with excellent food..but quite similar to what everyone else on Zomato has mentioned service is slow.However if one wants to relax and enjoy some good time with friends and family I would definitely recommend this place provided one likes continental food.
I loved prawn wrapped in bacon and chicken tetrazzini.We also liked chicken in mushroom sauce.Mango juice was a bit disappointing since it was similar to packed juice straight from the market.Mango shake was ok.
One thing we did not like was that the person who got the cheque waited directly staring to see how much tip we would leave!It was same for the other tables!The waiters seriously need coaching here.
But overall, given the price ambience and quantities I would surely revisit(and if I get a chance will mention  to them that staring is a bit awkward)

A 'Wise owl' visit was very obvious. It's one of the newest coffee shops in South Kolkata and is creating a lot of positive buzz. Read the reviews before the visit, and was pretty apprehensive about the delivery time. Thankfully though.... everything was on time!

Coming to the food - they were delicious. Ordered one Chicken sandwich, one French Fries, one Chicken Stragonoff, one Mango shake, and one Peach soda. In short, tasted everything from each major category. The quantity was too much for 2 people, and LOL!! I'm still quite full.

The ambiance was cool and laid-back. The staff was friendly too. Holding back a star 'coz I want a few more items included into the menu. In all, an ideal place for a get-together.

I have been to this cafe about three times because the food is quite good ( nothing special, but above average) , but I feel I must complain about the service. Not only is it extremely slow , the waiters are rude and lazy when it comes to taking orders. I had asked a waiter politely if he could come later as we were not ready to order and he rudely said,' No.' and waited until we had to scramble for our orders. Not only was he extremely rude and obnoxious, the service was very slow. I was quite angry at the end of the meal and I would recommend people complain to the manager if the service is terrible so it can be corrected.

first time I've been here. well had heard about this place and personally I loved it. seating arrangements outside is amazing. good for smokers like us. food is great with lots of subtle flavours. The chicKen wings are amazing, soft and tender. you should definately try the chicKen caciotora with herb rice. it's amazing.. service is a bit slow.. though it's great for us. you just don't want eat but talk too. now I would be a regular here.

Wise owl is a nice cosy place where you can hangout with your friends. Ambiance is comforting soft music and quiet place may be because not many customers where present when i visited there.
Lack of customers wasn't improving the service though.Service there is a major issue. Food there is good, sandwich n mock-tails was really nice,good sense of presentation .My friend tried cafe latte which tasted very bland, lack of creamy texture.So i would rate it 3.5 for its good food ambience and presentation. Visiting this cafe for quick bite is not advisable better you relax there chat up with your friends till your food arrives.

the joint's service scores are 2/10. they serve the dishes at your table one after another, at times becomes difficult to fit in all (table space too crampy). empty dishes are not removed unless ordered. my bitterest of experience here. food quality is just ok. for a breakfast one has to spend approx 250 per head on an average.

This place is a blessing as now we have a decent cafe to go to in Golpark area and don't have to go to the vile CCD or even vile-er South City Mall for a place to sit down and catch up with friends. The outside seating area is great on a cool day, great when it rains. The inside seating is a bit crowded and as this is frequented by groups of high school and college kids, expect loud conversations, irritating music played on mobile phones and suchlike.  

The service is very very slow. I would have given this place 4 stars had it not been for the service. There are only 2 people who do everything from taking orders, serving and clearing the bills for all the tables. You have to wait for 30 mins and repeatedly call them before they take your order, you can finish a game of scrabble before they serve your food, and the bill is best cleared at the counter itself unless you want to get hungry yet again before you leave the store. And if you want tabasco or ketchup or any thing, it's best to carry your own bottle because it will most likely not arrive if you request for it.

The food is good. The sandwiches come in large servings, good enough for 2 people as a snack (or one very hungry person). The burger is good, comes with crispy fries and is filled with salsa, tastes a bit spanish but that's not a bad thing. The pastas are also really nice. I have had the carbonara and arrabiatta, both of which were not very italian, but filling and tasty. A bit of oregano on the side would have been nice, but then I did not want to wait 20 minutes and let my food get cold, so I had to go without it. I have also had the fish and chips over here, which wasn't too good. The fish was fresh but too oily and tasted weird. 

The drinks are good too. A had a cola float which I loved, but then anyone can make a cola float. The chocolate milkshake my friend ordered was nice, creamy and rich. The ice teas are good too. But the coffee here is awful. 

I will surely be frequenting this place but the growing crowds are a bit of a worry for us regulars as it's irritating when you don't get a place to sit or have to deal with noisy teenagers busting your peaceful evening out.

Nice ambiance to the place. Good news for smokers as they allow outdoor seating. Tried the Cola Float and it was a pleasant surprise to find that dollop of vanilla ice cream in my cola. The Fish and Chips however was the star of the show. I'll go back just for that. Batter fried soft and succulent fish. Also tried the chicken Caesar salad. Good but I've had better. Will visit again to try out their coffee and also the cheese and bacon omelet which was not available this time around.

I was told about this place by a friend, I liked the name and thought it would be fun to try it out when a friend came visiting from out of town. 

Wise Owl has a charming ambiance, on a tree lined, primarily residential road, and is quite an interesting little place with an eclectic collection of owls displayed in glass cabinets; they have a few tables inside, mostly for couples or 3 people at most; and a few more tables outside, under the awning, which give it a nice 'cafe' touch and is perfect if you enjoy a smoke with your food. 
 
We were waiting for our 3rd friend to join us and decided to wait for her before we ordered our food; however, an irate mother-daughter team at the next table told us that service was slow so we went ahead and ordered right away. They were right. Service was excruciatingly slow and the lone waiter wandered around looking confused and like he was about to burst into tears any moment. He also failed to take the orders properly and had to be asked over and over to bring, napkins, water, glasses, cutlery etc.  

The food was good, my fried Fish was very Fresh and their Fries were better than I have had, in a while. None of us had any complaints about the food. 

If they want to last, however, they must hire more waitstaff immediately and train them to follow orders effectively. The place has a lot of potential and it would be a shame to find it downing their shutters due to slow Service.

Really Good food, but really lousy service!! The pizza and pastas were decent, nothing unusual, pocket-friendly and it was a nice welcoming ambience... Yet, the poor service eats into all the pros of this establishment. The staff was clueless as to what was going around and we had to wait for a really long time for each order! Otherwise, it is just another decent cafe in south Kolkata.

Well,as a hangout zone it rocks ! 
Firstly because of the fact that they don't really hassle you to leave but rather the service itself can be a bit slow mostly due to the fact that they are under-staffed compared to the crowd they pull.

Foodwise,it's pretty good. They offer a good range,their breakfast combo being a filling assortment of goodies.
The dish that stands apart and out is their Fish & Chips ! I would rate it to the best available in the city. The fish absolutely melts in your mouth. The tartar dip and fries could do with a bit of an improvement but the fish is the real show stealer. 
Macaroni Salad proved to be a good try too,albeit it was a tad too salty for my buds. 

It's cheap,it's cool and by the way it's always jam- packed,its well on its way to being the New 'IN' place in town.

Uh! I have no clue why people die to go here! Is it only because of the 'cool factor' of being spotted at a place sitting on the porch, smoking? Honestly, something you can do better at home. Nothing about this place really excites me. The service is slow. Even tortoises would bring food faster. They should make this a self service. Honestly, no one would mind walking 3 steps to the counter to get their food. I don't know how the inner section is called air conditioned. The air is only conditioned with humidity and all you will do throughout is keep wiping your sweat.
Coming to the food. The Ham sandwich is pretty yummy. Lasagna and Spaghetti are about average. Nothing which would need a special mention. The coffee, which comes after ages along with the other food isn't a worthy mention either. The chocolate shake tastes like bournvita.
This is not a biased review. You surely will enjoy time, sitting out on the porch behind a picket fence enjoying your time on a lovely weather, which honestly is very difficult to come by in Kolkata.
I had been passing by this place long before it was being made and had really high expectations about it. Anyways, this place is nothing amazing. 
If you have tons of time to spend, throughout the evening, sit, order and relax. Forget about what you order, even the waiters might forget it too!! 

Anyways, maybe okay for a one time visit to whet curiosity, otherwise, avoidable!
Cheers.

Wise owl,a coffee shop is located near Mrs magpie and offers a guest house service plus indoor and outdoor coffee plus food service. A good place to visit but service is very very slow. Food is okay. People who generally come for chitchat and smoking sit outside and enjoy the lovely weather. It is decently priced.  A 3 star rating from my side. :) 
=====
On my recent visit(05.10.2015) to Wise Owl, I tried few things:- 

1) Virgin Mojito - The mojito lacked the real mojito taste. It was mixed with some mint syrup and some mint leaves were just dropped in on top. It lacked the flavour. Didnot enjoy it much. 

2) Spicy Chicken Fingers - The spicy chicken fingers were expected to be fried and crunchy. However, it was tossed with the gravy and was not much spicy too. Tasted fine. 

A friend ordered a Strawberry shake and was quite unhappy with it as it was extra sweet. 

The service has surely improved a bit but still loads of scope of improvement. They have come up with a Wise Owl Steak House too.

Note: More offers required for customers.

Word of mouth - "wise owl" is awesome.. So I, like many others on hearsay, visited this place with my girl friend. The decor is simple and tasteful with an Air conditioned portion and a porch like portion where one can also smoke. The Menu is quite diverse and contains more than the usual cafe' regulars. To start off with, I ordered for 'Filer Coffee' which was not quite up to the mark. The food however in portion and taste was quite satisfying. Apart from the coffee, the service was also disappointing. Not to blame the waiter since he was the only one doing the  running around. So I think its completely a management issue. The little owl figurines give it a 'concept' type look which makes it all a bit more artsy. All in all a chilled out cafe, not harsh on your pockets, serving sumptuous tasty portions... can't really go wrong can it? so word of mouth - carried.

Noisy. Extra ordinarily noisy compared to any other coffee shops - boutique or chain. Cappuccino was made with sugar in it and that was a first and definitely a surprise. The fish finger and cheesy garlic bread was good. Overall a so-so experience. Mrs. Magpie nearby was a much better place for coffee hangout.

This place has of late become "the" place to hang out with friends, family or just for an evening cup of coffee in solitude..The sandwiches are awsome, so are the dishes with fish-especially the fish n chips..also loved the coolers here..however the only problem the place has and a major one is that the waiters have no clue about what the dishes are in the menu and even if they know theyd explain it to u with such an indifference that u would be prompted to leave..and both the food and the bill take ages to reach the table..look beyond these glitches and ur decision to eat at wise owl would indeed be a wise one..

Looking for a place to hangout with your friends???? well you can definitely try visiting this one. This is a damn nice place with a refreshing and relaxing environment. 
The facilities are quite abundant and the wifi connection actually works fast. The staff are cheerful and no complains regarding this matter. 
I personally am a big time coffee lover so if the place serves good coffee I am definitely impressed. The cold coffee is well made the pricing is reasonable. 
Overall I liked this one and would rate it 4. I must say now in Kolkata there are just too many good cafes, so the choice available is quite incredible.

I had given this place a three on my last visit and mentioned how they can't make cold coffee. On my most recent visit, yesterday, I ordered the cold coffee again. As was assured to me, they have definitely changed the coffee. And have done a remarkable job with it. I appreciate how they worked on my suggestion and immediately changed the coffee.The consistency of their coffee and shakes have also improved. I quite liked the strawberry and chocolate shake as well. 

We walked in around 5 30 to find the cafe completely full. We managed to get a table and I was really happy to see how the cafe has become so popular in a few months. Kolkata is just filled with coffee shops (particularly ccd) and this kind of a change was much needed.

Now, coming to their service: The servers lack knowledge about what's on the menu. I ask the person what meats are in the meat lovers sandwich? He says tomato, onion and capsicum. I again asked for the meats. He had no idea. There has to be someone supervising who is well spoken, with knowledge of the menu, ready to improvise the dishes a little if needed. These things add to customer satisfaction. Please work on training the servers well. The service is also quite slow. Given that the entire place was packed, I understand their pressure. But, now that they have picked up well, they should work on crowd management.

Food: We ordered for a macaroni pasta salad (nonveg) and a ham steak burger in bbq sauce. This was the deciding point for me. One of the best burgers I have had in Kolkata so far, the steak is soft, well done, juicy, tangy with the tartness of the tomatoes, succulent and so much sauce. They could reduce the amount of tomatoes and perhaps put a whole steak meat slice rather than chunks of meat. The sauce is a typically sweet bbq dressing, (wondering if they prepare the sauce?). Otherwise, a good job done with the burger.

The salad was also very well prepared, sufficient portions,sinfully creamy, generous amounts of chicken and yet light. They should add more variety to their salads, add prawns, bacon, potatoes etc. Perhaps they should consider having a salad bar with options in meats, veggies and dressing and charge according to the add ons. 

Loved the food! But yes, the drinks as compared to the food, still fall behind. For a complete meal and experience, they need to work on better mocktails/shakes etc.

Pocket pinch: Rs 550 for two. 
Overall : 3.5!



----- 24 Feb, 2013 -----

Wise Owl. The name itself fascinated me. I live in Pune, we have many such cafes there but something like that in Kolkata seemed interesting  and a new idea. I usually come back here on holidays and this time my friends kept mentioning the WISE OWL. A nice cafe with simple interiors, had quite a bit to offer. I love their seating arrangement outside with a nice little fence on one side giving it a different look as compared to cafes in Kolkata. Sitting outside is good for people who smoke, also if the weather permits.

Suggestion: They should put allouts/goodnights under the tables in the evenings.

Food: We ordered a chicken fusilli arabiatta, was well prepared with a good mix of red sauce and herbs, decent portions and lots of cheese! I particularly liked their carbonara, i customised it a little bit by asking them to put bacon instead of chicken and use spaghetti instead of farlfalle. Topped with cheese, it tasted delicious. My friend ordered a chicken lasagne. Quite a meaty and creamy lasagne they serve. I must add that they serve very good portions for the price at which they sell. I ve tried their tetrazini which is also well made. What one may also look forward to on their menu, are the shakes, and their bacon wrapped prawns. The chocolate mousse is delicious, fluffy, creamy and chocolaty but they should a add chunks of brownie/slices of sponge cake at its base or in the middle to break the monotony. 

Negetive: The shakes are not as thick as they should be. But I like the amount of sweetness that they add.
Service is a little slow, but warm and friendly.

The cold coffee is not something they know how to make. Its watery with less coffee and had less sugar which is when i added extra syrup yet the required punch in a the cold coffee was missing. 

That apart, we had a great time. Company matters of course and this cafe provides a lovely ambiance when on a lazy afternoon, one feels like catching up with friends or even if you just want to read a book alone and grab a quick bite. 

Must visit. Over all rating - 3.5/5

the wise owl really lacks in service and needs to either train their staff in a better way or else introduce self service which would be less painful to handle...!
The omelets are fantastic though but the shakes and the cold coffee were no where even near "cold" . Overall the food is good ... would love to go again but am hesitant due to the poor service.

The place from the outside looks very convincing. But the moment you enter, you'l realize how bad the service of the place is!!...We had ordered only for cheese garlic bread and one chicken shawarma. It was over 45 mins and the food still did not come. When I had gone to complain, they are saying that it takes time. I have had shawarma a hundred times and I know very well that it does not take so much time!!...worst possible experience at any coffee outlet at Kolkata!!!

Wise Owl has turned out to be a disappointment. Its appearance holds out promise; once seated, hopes are dashed. It is remarkable that it continues to draw a large crowd. I have been there twice in two weeks, and on both occasions, not found anything good to say about the food, beverages or service. The only thing I like about the place is the collection of owl figurines in a large display case on one side of the restaurant.

The service is very slow. This starts from the point of taking orders, where the waiters mill around aimlessly but never seem to notice a raised hand or a glance. Speaking very loudly draws their attention, but it is something that should not be resorted to in a place where people might want to meet and chat with each other without the insistent voices of fellow-customers preying on them. Items as simple as an iced tea or a cold coffee take twenty minutes or more to turn up. The waiters are unable to describe what goes into their more fancily titled beverages.

The quality of the food/beverages is also bad. The tea and coffee are not good quality. On one occasion, the cold coffee has so much sugar in it that it overwhelmed the taste of the coffee - a feat that takes some doing. The sandwiches are woefully lacking in substance and use very thick bread that is unsuitable for sandwiches. The fish and chips is passable.

Overall, not the best place to go to unless you enjoy long waits to get a table, poor food and bad service.

I just happened to pass by this coffee shop in the month of October in between my work hours and liked the place from the outside.It looked to me like a British Cafe types.I dropped in for dinner and this place happens to be my favorite place near my office.The Food is great!!Their service is good!!I always feel at home coming to this cafe.The owner is a great and warm host for her customers.It is a place which i have recommended so many in my office that all of them have become regulars to the coffee shop.
They have a lovely OWL collection in the cafe and adds glamor to the ambiance.The hot chocolate is as yummy like i have never had earlier.The Pastas has a superb taste and fulfills the taste buds.
All who have not tried this cafe has missed great ambiance with lovely food.I m a vegetarian but still its my fav hangout.

Home away from Home!!!!!!

A nice and cozy place, nice sit out, good property. But how it is wasted. I've been there 4/5 times every time hoping that with all the negative feedback they have received, they will have the least bit of shame to try to improve!!!! Last time we went, they had no bacon, for Sunday breakfast !!! No pork sausage too. Today, we were sitting outside, and ordered mushroom on toast and mushroom pancake. The mushroom on toast arrived first, without any fork or knife. After 20 minutes a wrong dish arrived which we didnt order. None of the service guys were outside. We went inside to ask how long it'll take. We could also see through the glass - other customers being served wrong dishes. After half n hour when we went inside for the third time, this time to cancel the order, the mushroom pancake finally arrived, with 2 sets of fork and knives !!! What did they think, I'll wait with a soggy mushroom on toast for half n hour for the other dish to arrive !!!! When we complained about it, we were told every dish takes 20 minutes to cook. What we didnt understand is, with the same mushroom-cheese topping, why would the toast arrive immediately and the pancake, which was nothing but a different kind of bread, will take half n hour !!!! And if 2 people are coming together to eat, why cant the 2 dishes be served together !!! Does this common sense require too much of training? I dont know what makes the owner take the guests so much for granted ! I'm definitely not going back again.

Horrible service, average food... The only plus point was the good location...  The service is just too bad... I mean I don't expect 5 star silver service but give me a break... I think the road side chai- wallas would give better service then the wise owl...  I specially would like to note the manager who declined to explain an take my order instead said that he will send someone else to do that which of course never happened and after waiting about 15 min we just got up and left. So good luck with the wise owl.

an awesome place!!!!!!!!!!!!
my favorite-the hamburger steak...
the shakes are also great.
With its rising poularity it has become impossible to get seats.....and maybe just maybe it might just start losing the charm it used to have when people could just hang out over a cuppa coffee and chat for long hours...how times change..hope the authorities try something out to keep its charm!!!

No wise owl will recommend this place..I went there on a thursday afretnoon for a late lunch and I was dissapointed...I was welcomed with mosquitoes and flies, but I guess where there are owls there could be deadly blood sucking parasites. The waiters here certainly live up to the name of the resturant.. they r like owls..they act dumb and deaf and just roll their eyes..maybe they are from another country and don't speak the language...the food...I ordered a chicken Hawaiian pizza, it was ok. Next came the chicken wings (yes the starter was served after the main course!) And it came with a side of hair. That's right, if u like human hair as one of the ingredients in ur wing batter..this is a must order here... I sent the wings back promptly and gave them a piece of my mind..next came the chicken shashlik with a side of herb rice..might I suggest they rename it chicken capsicum with a side of capsicum..and for someone who hates capsicum...it wasn't exactly a delicacy...overall...I can say my visit to the wise owl made me wiser about where my next lunch won't be :P

It doesn't live up to the hype generated but I guess the hype is there mainly because of the out door seating arrangement they have where people can actually settle down with their group of friends and smoke and relax. The food is average, not bad, but nothing exceptional. The inside could be any other coffe joint. The food is modestly priced as you end up feeling you get what you pay for. Pasta's n pancakes are pretty decent. But what I found truly exceptional was their chicken burger. They didnt settle down for a pattie inside but had chicken chunks in a special sauce serves with fries. Sadly i hadn't ordered for it and I wouldn't mind going back for it. It's a perfect place to spend your evening with friends. Their mocktails look beautiful. End of the day, it's a decent place and the food doesn't disappoint you. I would surely drop by again if I'm nearby but I wouldn't take the pains of driving down south only for the grub here. They have a showcase full of different kinds of owl memorabilia which is quite quirky!

It's a long walk from Gol Park, but the picket fence and potted plants at the entrance more than make up for it. The outdoor seating is comfortable and spacious but I wouldn't recommend it for Summer afternoons. The Owl motif is carried through inside with a shelf dedicated to similarly themed knick-knacks. Plus points for the wooden floors. Kolkata has slim pickings when it comes to eating options prior to 11am, therefore I loved the fact that they have a breakfast fare here at Wise Owl.
Service is rather slow though, especially if you are seated outside, and certain items on the menu are often 'out of stock'. 
Peach Soda was disappointing and tasted suspiciously like Sprite+Cough Syrup. Nachos was alright, but I personally would have preferred salsa and cheese on top instead of in tiny dip bowls. Jalapenos wouldn't hurt either. 
Lasagna was served scalding hot but the abundance of cheese compensated for all other discrepancies. It was well seasoned and the portion was generous for one.
We also ordered the Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce, which was delicious! The butter was fragrant and the veggies on the side were nicely done. A little more seasoning wouldn't hurt, but thankfully there is a pepper mill on hand (nice touch!) to take care of the customer's seasoning needs. Mashed potatoes needed to be creamier, but the fish was absolutely perfect! Flaky inside and evenly golden brown on top, it met expectations, and how!
For dessert I ordered the Caramel Custard which was cooling and subtly flavoured - just what was needed after the heavy meal. 
I'd recommend ordering wisely keeping in mind the possible margin of error, not going by visual representation of the food available and going there only if one has a lot of time on hand.

Nice & cosy, you can spend hours here and the service will ensure that. The bites are quite impressive, the burgers & sandwiches are quite a relief from the gimmicks served by the 'CCDs'. For Kolkatans, the place  gives you a feel of Flury's. Service has to improve. The patio allowd you a smoke with your coffee.

So evening coffee after a really tired day with a dear friend...Only problem was that we chose Wise Owl.
Cozy interiors I must say but after a while the 'owl' overdose really gets to you, specially when you see so many owls hanging from the necks of young girls these days !! LOL

My friend and I really just wanted to sip on something while chatting so she ordered a Blue Lagoon and I ordered a Lychee Soda. You cannot really go wrong with a 'soda', right??
Well, Wise Owl proved me wrong. My soda was warm (try drinking warm lychee juice, you'll know what horror I sipped from that glass!) and was also lying out for ages. So basically I got warm lychee fizz-less soda (fizz-less soda = water!). My friend's drink was decent but served in a tall (around 11 inches) glass with a regular straw. I really don't know what the waiters were thinking (replaying the story of The Fox And The Crane, maybe??!!)

We also ordered a Kiwi Sundae. I really love the tang of kiwi so hoped it would be a nice end to our visit. But the Owl was not really that 'Wise' in this case either. When you order a sundae, you expect to see a well defined scoop in a bowl (drizzled with kiwi syrup, in this case), but all we got was two (I'm guessing!) meatball-ish balls of ice-cream dunked in its own molten puddle with the green kiwi syrup scattered over it.

*sigh*

And their service?? Please let me NOT get started with that. One word = Sloppy!
And also there was a big scene in the cafe when we went. Apparently some people got served non-veg instead of vegetarian or something. The lady picked up her plates and smashed them on the floor before she left. *TRAUMA*

All in all, I doubt I will go back there again. Was about to give them 1.5 but gave the extra 0.5 because of the really comfy chairs :)

But yeah, will NOT go back !!

Coffeehouse-r shei addata....
Ambience: The perfect adda joint I must say, and believe me I have reasons aplenty. The ambience is warm, the decor quirky and has stuck to the owl theme, which I find very interesting. There are miniature owls all over the place! It has an indoor non-smoking seating area and an outdoor smoking area complete with a colonial roof and a picket fence! The romantics will surely prefer to sit outside! :)
Service: Surely not their strong forte! And believe you me, that helps the cause of the long addas but that also causes the longer lines, depends whichever side you're in! The service is sloth. The staff inefficient but cordial. And I usually spare them the hoot since I'm quite a regular here and acquainted with their ways.
Food: The food is okay, nothing great...but is cheap. Coffee and tea are the safest and cheapest orders. Tried their lasagne once and it was okay. The avalanche (brownie, ice cream, chocolate sauce, chocolate chips) is quite a mouthful but nothing extraordinary. The breakfast is not that great (whoever slices up the sausages?!? gosh!).
Recommendation: Only come here if you want a long and hearty chat session with your buddies over a cup or two or come with a storybook or a sketchbook or a notebook...man this place emits such a creative aura!

This has become my new haunt recently and I'm happy to say I've finally found a coffee place in Kolkata that has both 1.) great coffee and espresso and 2.) spacious and comfortable environs. 

I have had cold coffee and hot chocolate almost all kind of coffees served and it's very delicious and very strong. They use quality food products which is great. The lady behind the counter are always nice and seem to have good senses of humor.

I love the atmosphere: beautiful ceiling, beautiful floors, tasteful decor touches. Seating is nice and varied, although the chairs are simple yet elegant. I like that there's every variety of seating imaginable,cafe tables outside, seating inside. This is definitely a great place to read, study or do work.

Music has been always a hit, although that's purely a personal preference thing. I can say it's never obtrusive or obnoxious. 2 times I've been in I was really impressed and digging it, a couple other times not so much.

There is one, customers-only bathroom which is good.

This review may come across as just a bit nit-picky, but it's coming from a man whose favorite pastime is reading for hours in coffee joints.If i have to say which is the "Perfect Coffee Shop" and only Wise Owl comes mighty close,really close.

Its a sweet little shop! I have been there just once but I really liked their food, ambience and of course the price! The staff seems a bit lost. ..They came to take our order without providing us with a menu card and seems so careless and less attentive that you can easily slip away without paying your bills!! hehe
All in all a nice place to hangout! 
All the Maggi & Non Maggi lovers must try their Chilly Garlic Maggie it's YUMMYLICIOUS!!!!

Second visit to this place.The experience could'nt get any better.Ordered Cola float,Chocoblast sundae,brownie with icecream and french fries.The chocoblast sundae was a little piece of heaven:rich,creamy,fun and chunky completed with Strawberry icecream,chocolate sauce,choco-nuts and cashews.Brownie was served with  a scoop of 2-in-1 icecream on the side and a drizzle of chocolate sauce,the inside of the brownie retained its gooeyness and was crusty on the outside. The mocktail had a simple composition but went perfectly with the desserts.French fries neutralized the sugar RUSH.

Visited this coffee shop yesterday evening with a friend.Loved the ambience inside,didnt get a chance to sit outdoor though.Cosy and a great place to hangout.Ordered Penne Alfredo (chicken) and Veg followed by Cola Float (Mocktail).The quality and service was incredible.Worth a visit.Overall experience really good.

Very bad experience. Supposed to open at 7.30 am in the morning. Even at 8 am the cooks were sleeping. So we left the place without having breakfast.
if 7.30 am is a problem they should say so and open the shop at 9am or later.

This is a nice little place on Purna Das Road jusr opposite the Azad Hind Dhaba. Its a good place for a snack or a light meal. Stopped by for a light lunch and was quite happy with the overall experience. We had a chicken burger with cheese and a grilled fish ... both were pretty good . They also seem to have a really nice breakfast menu so I hope to be able to go have breakfast there soon. Prices are resonable and place is very clean and neat. They also have a good bit of outdoor seating which would be nice in the mornings and evenings. A cool place to hang out and chill with friends. The staff though nice don't seem too well trained so that is something they should work on.
The Bacon Wrapped Prawns and Cheese Toast which I had on later visits were pretty good.

I had a look through the earlier reviews. They aren't the most praiseworthy to say the least. However, I must admit that I disprove any of them. My experience was a little different however. I was back to the city after 6 months and wanted to catch up with an old school friend on a Saturday Winter's morning. 

I sat on the cane chairs in front of the coffee shop for breakfast. We ordered pancakes and sandwiches. The prices were definitely high but nothing that wasn't affordable. The sandwiches were VERY good. The pancake wasn't bad. It wasn't exceptional though. Coffee was good and nothing more than that.

Service was really slow but my friend had already warned me of it and since we were not pressed for time in anyway, we enjoyed the lazy morning. Purna Das road isn't crowded on a Saturday morning and we quite enjoyed sitting outdoors. 

Keeping in mind the previous reviews, I would suggest foodies trying the place out for breakfast and have a lot of time at their disposal. It would be quite a lovely experience.

Went there on the first day of 2013. Ordered sandwich and coffee. The sandwich was good-but I have tasted better. What I really liked was the coffee. I ordered the Wise Owl signature concoction-and it was delicious.

I liked the ambiance too-psuedo French-but it grows on you.

Not far from Golpark,this little cafe is situated in the same building as a guest house. Full of little owl curios,it was pleasant on a winter evening.

Seating: There's very few seats inside,but the ones outside wouldn't really be comfortable at all hours of the day,so that's a big negative.

Food: Pretty shody coffee. Overpriced dishes like maggi(starting at 70). Terrible risotto. Grilled chicken not as nice and juicy as one could expect. Didn't dare be more adventurous. Tried their prawn croquettes: it was just about alright,could be better seasoned. Basically,the food isn't up to the mark.
Desserts were VERY boring. Nothing new to offer for such a quirky owl.

Ambiance: The service is slow. Guests in the guest house share the same entrance as the cafe's clients. The staff couldn't really give us helpful pointers about the food. 

Price: For such an average cafe,specially since they can't cook well the fancy dishes they advertise,it's pretty overpriced.

Would I go back? Probably not. Specially not in summer,with their inconvenient seating space.

Went there a few days back. I was alone and ordered a plate of chicken wings and a cup of black coffee. Even when the restaurant was practically empty, it took them 45 mins to get just these items, that too when the chicken wings were merely batter fried. The black coffee was ok too. Saw the mousse and pudding on the counter and they didn't seem very appealing. The chicken wings were decent. The service is very slow, but the taste was not bad. The staff is warm and friendly.

Couldn't have found a better way to spend a Christmas morning than to have a lavish breakfast. Wise Owl was an automatic choice being close to my place. Had heard a lot about it and I wanted to try it  out first hand. The five star rating is solely for one of the best breakfasts ive ever had. The bacon was delicious, then again, they are so most of the times. The sausages were pretty ordinary. The cheese omlette TOTALLY justified its naming contrary to most other places that serve the same. i had a cafe mocha which was awesome. And then, the chocolate pancakes. Soft and sinfully delicious. A 1.2k bill was what three of us had to shell out, but then again,we gorged on multiple helpings of the above mentioned items. The people were warm and friendly and the ambience does justice to the name of the place.

A visited this nice little place for an evening snack, and was absolutely thrilled. Nice, warm and friendly service, simple but well spaced out interiors make it a place where you can hang out the entire evening. They have an option for outdoor sitting as well. Food was awesome for the price. You must try out the bacon wrapped prawns and the grilled fish! Coffee flavour and character was good. They take a slight amount of extra time to serve the food; but you'll not feel the weight of time in the warm and jolly atmosphere, and the food when ut arrives, will be worth the wait.

for so long i have waited, but it's here, a place where i can sit and enjoy a good cup of coffee, or i can chow down a good hearty ham burger . that bistro feel, good sandwiches and pretty much everything else. highly recommended. try the ham steak burger and the lasagna for sure .

And even if all this wasn't enough to convince you, go for the ambience and then fall for the coffee...

I visited this place for breakfast and was quiet happy with the nice fresh feel of the place. The cafe has options for sitting inside or outside. The quality of the food was also decent, though i would suggest that you taste your coffee before adding sugar to it, as it may already have hints of it! 

Calcutta definitely needs more such places like these.
