A very small joint, Amantran. Located about a minute walk from Medical College Gate 5. Looks like a odd place from outside, but their food quality is quite good. Momo was fine at Rs.60 for pan fried.
Much popular for rolls. Decent quality.

From outside it might look dirty , rotten etc. 
To be honest food wise it is brilliant , went for Chicken Clear Soup and Chicken Steam Momo both the items were exquisite in taste.
Best for takeaway.
