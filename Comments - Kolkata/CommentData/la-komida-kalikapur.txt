They have a unique concept......
Global Kitchen.
They promise to serve global food under one roof.
I personally have doubts about their authenticity of the food served,but they tasted well.
Infact the Shawarma they served tasted like Curd instead of Mayo.The Biryani was overspicy.Chinese is good though.

Location:-Very easy to locate as it is main road Anwar Shah Connector near over bridge.
Ambience and Decor:-Ok -Ok type.Light a bit less.Though they brighten up the lights after my request
Food:-Well the main part.I ordered for Chinese combo.They took a lot of time to prepare the food.Though the restaurant was non crowded.Paneer pakora was okayish.Their paneer Manchurian and Paneer Hot garlic gravy was same.Egg Hakka noodles quantity is very less.
Overall:-Not bad a change of taste.But they should seriously work on food delivery time and food quantity.

Visited during this puja. Service was pathetic.  At the dinner time around 10 pm they could not serve desired dishes . Anyway it is OK just for puja days . I think in normal day they are very good . Hopefully we will visit soon after the puja

Ordered few stuffs for dinner from this place.We ordered chicken momo and burmese non veg khaw suey and cheese sesame rolls.Talking about the food in zist below:-
1.Cheese Sesame rolls-The batter was crisp to perfection went really well by the gooey cheese and toasted sesame seeds on top.
2.Chicken momo-Not my favourite.I have tasted better momos
3.Non veg Khaw suey-The best of the three we ordered.Very light and refreshing broth with a slight coconuty flavour,the noodles were soft which is the way they should be and the extra condiments like fried garlic,red chili powder and lime took it to a next level.

Ordered food via swiggy, got 10% discount. Food arrived within 1 hour. Ordered masala kulcha, matar paneer, hyderabadi chicken, pan fried chili fish, chicken hariyali kabab, all the items were good. Price pocket friendly, quantity was sufficient, food ingredients were fresh. Overall had good experience with la komida..

Attended a party at this place. The place was well decorated, and the ambience was also good so were the staff. Coming to the food quality & quantity , quantity I can't comment as I had the food at the buffet counter, but the food quality was too good.

I have tried veg noodles,veg fried rice, hot garlic fish, hunan chicken and clear soup in starter. Noodles nd garlic fish was good. But hunan chicken was not so good in taste. Veg fried rice was okk. The soup was so good in taste.
