In no time this has become the best sweet shop in the Entally area, other sweet shop doesn't come closer to this. All the sweets are the best thing possible for people who have sweet tooth..

This sweet shop is located near Entally , just adjacent  to A.J.C Bose road.
They serves a vast variety of sweets. Tasted their Gur sondesh, plain sondesh, singaara and gulab jamun. They were decent with an affordable price but if one want to taste the best sweets in Kolkata , one may opt for Balaram Mallick, KC Das etc 
Crowdy ambience , without any sitting arrangements.
Service was quick.

The sweets are good in quality and my personal favourite is the sour curd. Mostly i buy the sweets while coming back from the church. The owner has a brother  and the brother also has a sweet shop it is located in SN banerjee road.  Taltala bamsameti even this shop is larger than the other brother.

Traditional mishti shop of Central Kolkata, the entire city abounds in such shops, each one a sparkling gem. Not much by way of ambience or hygiene. In fact these old shops are somewhat lacking in that department. So if one is looking for a spic and span interior with state of the art cooling counters of some modern mithai shops then you can give this one a miss. But then you will also miss tasting some amazing sweets. This being the winter season we had a gur malai roll sweet with kheer and shaur,it was amazing. Just right amount of sweetness and the flavour of nolen gur.

Sri Gopal is like old is gold. It is very near to moulali crossing just 2 minutes walking distance. This sweet shop has lot of varieties of sandesh misti. Ofcourse the rosogolla is the best one here and misti doi, khancha golla, khirkodom, rosomalai are also very good in taste. Pocket friendly and best one in my locality.
