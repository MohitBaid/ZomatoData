Very bad experience. Management is bad. Behavior is worse. Bar manager is the worst. Started misbehaving, shouting and abusing us at the entrance. We didn't tell him anything nor we misbehaved with him. WONT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
0 stars from my side.

Newly open bar lounge named as Sunset and it's amazing place best place to hangout. Service guys too friendly and well groomed. Cocktail menu very surprising huge option. I can't remembered the name of the cocktail taste good. Specially food was amazing wow feeling....we had pizza paesana it's really amazing taste wow best pizza
Grilled fish it's really amazing bit unique and fusion served with Chia seeds 
Red Thai curry taste good Herby flavor lemon leaf and Thai ginger...it's balance but need bit improvement.
Recommended everyone
