Ordered #Chicken Thai Chilli Rice from Swiggy
Although I'm a big fan of Nom Nom, the dish just didn't taste right. There was not salt in it and hence all flavours remained suppressed. Absolutely tasteless.
Not at all expected.

Food (5/5): We ordered the Thai Fish and Chips and Chili Fish starters. For main course we ordered the Nom Nom special rice, Bird Eye Chili Chicken and Mandarin Fish. The food was fresh and incredibly tasty and the quantity was more than enough. Would love to come back and try out more of the fish items!!

Ambience(5/5): Located beside a serene lake the restaurant looks like a quiet beach resort. Great place to click a lot of photos with friends.

Service(4/5): This could be improved upon as the waiter took a little more time than usual to deliver the food. That's the only reason for giving 4.5

All in all a great place to come over and over with friends and family for some of the best food near and around Sector V, Salt Lake, Kolkata.

Nom Nom has introduced their "Thainese cuisine," a selection of distinct Thai tastes combined with select flavours from parts of South China. Prices of the food here are also pocket-friendly. üëå

Visited the small neatly-decked eatery on New Year's Day with two of my former university friends to usher in the new year with some delectable Thainese offerings.
The restaurant has arrangement for both indoor and outdoor seating. We chose to sit outside under the cosy umbrellaed seats to enjoy the warm winter sunlight, a tranquil view of Nalban and of course the lovely food.
Except for a few flies occasionally hovering over the food the alfresco area is hassle-free.

We lunched heartily on the Lung Fung Soup, Assorted Veg Dim Sum Platter, Nasi Goreng with Crunchy Peanuts, Pad Thai Noodles and Bang Bang chicken. The soup, nasi goreng and chicken happens to be Nom Nom specials.

The soup contained bits of chicken and shrimp, was light in taste and good to sip, although learnt that the Lemon Coriander Soup is better, so would try it the next time I visit. :)
The veg dim sums, stuffed with vegetable, sweet corn and cottage cheese were tastefully pleasant and a recommended good option to begin a decent Oriental meal.
Nasi goreng is the staple Indonesian rice dish, the name literally translating to 'fried rice' in Indonesian, and personally felt the nasi goreng at Nom Nom, flecked with baby corns, was the best item I had among the others.
The Pad Thai flat noodles had a "strong" spicy flavour, and were so much better than other flat Thai noodles I've had elsewhere.
The Bang Bang Chicken, a traditional Chinese sliced chicken preparation, were spicy as well but highly flavoursome and satisfactory to taste.
All the items were quite delicious and served in not just sufficient but simply more than enough quantities.

Servers are polite and well-behaved. Service is also good.

At such affordable prices, Nom Nom is a wonderful place to indulge in Chinese and Thai delicacies. Those fond of Thai and Chinese cuisines should give it a try at least once. :) üòäüëç

We were there at around 2:30 pm. It is situated just next to parking area lot of Nalban food park. When we reached there the restaurant was full after 15 mint we got our table. Talking about the ambience the decor was so nice and simple, staffs were so courageous. The main attraction is outdoor sitting and pond side area awesome in one word I can say. Here coming to the food we have ordered 
1. Sauted mushroom with ginger chilly
2. Sizzling BBQ Chicken
3. Randang fish
4. Prawn salt and aromatic pepper
5. Burnt garlic fish with seasonal veg
6. Grilled fish with red curry sauce along with Burnt garlic rice.
7. Nom Nom special mix fried rice
In one word except fried rice all the above mentioned items are heavenly tasty .. fried rice was so so not like other items.
We have ordered soda sikanji like soda and cola float and in beverages we ordered Aitim tod ( fried ice cream) first time I have tasted fried ice cream it was bliss.
Lastly the price is so reasonable.  I suggest to my acquaintances to come here and taste their  finger licking items..

Shining like a diamond in the ring road, Nom Nom delivers you super quality food at a pocket friendly rate.
It was my first visit and a great experience altogether. We started with Red Chilli Paradox Chicken and the tenderness made it paradise chicken. We ordered 2 mocktails, blue lagoon and pink lemonade. The drinks were very good considering the price.
In main course we had Mei Foon(Rice Noodles) and Devils Prawn. Both were equally palatable. I am very much eager to pay another visit to try their special dishes.
Highly recommended to all Thai and Chinese lovers!

A unplanned visit to this place was really blissful,the place updated in Zomato is wrong,so if you wanna visit you have to walk a little more you have to cross the SDF more then also a bit more then you see a board pointing the direction following that you will finally reach the place.
So it's a bit bad response for both Zomato & nom nom.You guys should keep the details updated for the customer as it is a huge source for us.
Coming to the ambience it's a soothing one.you have huge chinesse umbrella for decore, dim lights, slow music.perfect for a date night or a friendly lunch gathering with friends.so a 4 out of 5.
Coming to the foods now we had Red chilli paradox chicken for starter which was really yummy with mild spicy for taste.For main we had Burnt garlic spring onion mix fried rice & for side Hunan chicken.both were really yummy.so a 4.5 out of 5.coming to the service I was bit disappointed,when we entered the restaurant no one even bothered to greet us neither they came to us for attending us to the table.so 2 out 5.they really need to improve in this.

It was a mini reunion of sorts and I was delegated the task of zeroing in on a place that would be close to all our offices.
After much deliberation, I chose this place because of it's astounding rating and the open-air seating which is a bliss during winters.

Location:Nalban food park,a 5 minute's walk from RDB boulevard.

Ambience: Tasteful,minimal decor and serene atmosphere especially with the fairy-lights and outdoor seating.

Food:We were ravenous and ordered for the following-

SIZZLING BARBEQUE CHICKEN(4/5)-10 small to medium pieces of chicken tossed in a garlicky,sweet and hot sauce, served on a sizzler plate.

MIXED NASI GORENG (4/5)-An Indonesian classic,spicy rice served with a sunny-side-up and 2 gandharaj lemon-infused chicken satay sticks.It had ample amount of chicken,egg and prawns.

MIXED MEIFOON(4/5)-Mildly spiced rice noodles jam-packed with chicken, eggs and prawns.A subtle yet tasty accompaniment for bold gravy dishes.

CHILLI GARLIC VEG NOODLES(3/5)-An average affair.Our vegetarian friend wasn't too pleased.

BANG BANG CHICKEN(4/5)- Innumerous pieces of tender chicken in a comforting Chinese gravy.

TSING HOI CHICKEN(3.5/5)-Again, plenty of chicken and mushroom tossed in a delicious gravy.

AMERICAN CORN AND POTATO CHILLI(2.5/5)-Below par.

FRESH LIME SODA(4/5)-Standard fare.

Prices-Extremely reasonable.The portion sizes are crazy and after a 10% corporate discount, it just came down to 200 rupees per head.

Service-Swift and efficient.
Just a side note,I personally looove chilli heat but if you're not a chilli enthusiast,ask them to dial down the heat because the dishes are quite spicy and hot.

Verdict-My friends were chuffed at the recommendation and I couldn't have been happier.I had a gala time and one of the most memorable meals in a long,long time.

Lovely interior.. Coloured chairs and colourful ceiling, even the sit out was nice
We ordered cola float, masala coke, chilli fish (they made it fish with bean sauce though), Cantonese noodles and nom nom special mixed rice ( this was horribly hot.. I don't now y they had to add so much chilli or whatever I could hardly have it,  it was a total wastage ) 
Other than the rice everything was just perfect

Nom Nom The meaning of it is the expression of having a perfect food experience. Found it in zomato itself. And it drew my attention because there was not good chinies or Thai cuisine restaurant around sector 5 ( near SDF).

Location:
___________

Now it is @Nalban Food Park. To be specific at the car parking end of Nalban Food Park.

If you come by Ring Road ( water side) , going towards SDF, you need not to be go upto the junction where right turn take you to RDB. It's before that, on the left hand side.

Decoration:
_______________

They have a sitting arrangement for 25 people around. But it's seems to be pretty small at the peak hours.
They have the outside sitting arrangement of 3 table. But it's not good to have your meal there. In the indoor they have a neat and clean arrangements, with some roof hanging umbrella.

We went there around 2 PM. One side of the restaurant is west facing, they have big wall glass. Which looks very nice, but at the evening and at the rainy season. The sunlight is too uncomfortable to be sitted at that end, where they have no curtains on that wall.
It's look superb, but sitting there is a bit ask in the scorching sunlight. Just the curtain may solve the whole issue.

Food:
__________

¬© Starters:
_____________

‚úì Murtabak : we took Muitabak Chicken. They called it a Indo Muslim Malaysian dish. To be simple is their version of our very own moglai paratha. But the stuffing is here Chicken with egg. It tastes superb.

‚úì Randag Fish - they promise to give it in a Banana leaf wrap. But in our case it was a bit different. The banana leaf was not available. So they presented it in a sizzler plate with two wanton. It was having a mild taste of gandharaj lemon and tossed in Randag paste. It's pretty nice. Yes the fish was basa. So, if you only like behtki, this is surely not for you.

‚úì Sizzling BBQ Chicken : superb one. The sweet n chilli taste combination is the X factor of the dish. Presented in a sizzler plate.

¬© Main Courses:
________________
‚úì Nasi Goreng Chicken : amazing one in taste. This is presented with chicken steak. And the omlet with the yolk on top of it.

‚úì Nom Nom special Noodles: superb in taste. We took the mixed noodles. It tasted just perfect.

‚úì Bang Bang Chicken : shredded chicken with chinies gravy. It's simple but yet so tastey.

¬© Beverages:
_______________

‚úì Kush Lime Cups : it was very nice. The syrup mixture was perfect. Loved it.
‚úì Virgin Mojito : didn't like it. It could have been better. Main problem was it could have been more chilled. May be due to winter they refrain to do that, but it became as a big blow to me.

If I summarize the whole experience - we had a great food experience.

Few things they need to take care:
‚úì one thing I already mentioned of sitting in scorching sunlight.
‚úì 2nd point is service. I was wandering why they are so slow. They realized, it so too much ask for 3 people attending 25 odd guests.

To management: you guys are doing good, but please take care of the small odd. The food you offer are superb. Just maintain that and consider these small things.

And all that cost 1372 for 3 heads. We were too much occupied if having dessert.

And the best part they do not charge extra GST.

To all : please give this a try. You will love it for sure.

And till my next restaurant visit- happy fooding.

We ordered via Swiggy and had a horrible experience experience as they came with 2 items instead of 3. So the entire matter took an additional 1 hour to be solved. Coming to the food, we ordered

Burnt chilli garlic Mixed Noodles - The Noodles we‚Äôre immensely oily with no flavour of burnt garlic.

Prawn Fire Crackers - The prawns were marinated in some red chilli paste and then fried but there was a raw flavour of the chilli paste.

Bird‚Äôs eye chilli chicken- The chicken pieces were really soft and succulent and the gravy was tasty as well. Tanginess need to be balanced. Quantity is sufficient for 2 adults 

It was not a WOW experience as per the expectation from a 4.4 rated restaurant. May be it was a bad luck of us. But not a highly recommended eatery as per the price.

This place a just a few months old, packed up in a corner of sector five.
The best part about this place is the ambience, really romantic, dim lights, colourful chairs add to the feel.
Outdoor seating is also available.
Food is okay, not too great, or made I didn't make the right choices.
I took Tom yum soup which was okay, it had less salt.
Next was stir fried fish in starter which was nice.
I took Cantonese noodles in main course with a lamb dish.
Lamb was quite chewey and hard and I returned that. they didn't charge me for the lamb fortunately.
Price is light on the pocket, they done charge gst yet.
Its a perfect place to visit on a weekend night.

Though I have already tasted their awesome food ordering in office, visiting Nomnom was on my checklist for a long time as it has one of the best views in town. Situated just next to Nalban parking lot Nomnom has a lot to offer. We went there when lunch time was almost over so it was quite empty. They have followed 'keep it simple' mantra in their decor. The outside area is the main attraction and that can be turned into a breathtakingly beautiful romantic spot in near future. Coming to food, we ordered Red Chilli Paradox chicken, wok tossed pepper fish and non veg assorted dim sum platter (fried). They give sumptuous quantity for two people. Every dish was finger licking tasty. I specially liked the prawn dim sum from the platter. In dessert we ordered their much talked about fried icecream and it was a treat for both our eyes and tastebuds. The pricing was very reasonable and it can be the next hotspot for giving treat to people when you have a stringent budget yer want to have good food. From my previous experience I will definitely recommended sizzling barbecue chicken - it's a must-have for all meat lovers. 
Overall experience-
Ambience- 5/5
Food- 4.5/5
Service- 4.5/5

Located opposite to the Tangerine Royal Banquets, just beside the Ring Road parking lot, this place is close to the RDB Boulevard as well. The combination of unique food, competitive pricing and sumptuous quantity has managed to draw hordes of people to this place. Located at the IT hub has definitely helped it's cause. We went there for Lunch, ordered to our hearts content and had a wonderful time. We started off with the Mocktails, they are just to-die-for. We ordered Barbequed Chicken wings and golden fried prawns as starters. Both of which were finger licking good. In the main course we ordered Mix Meifoon noodles, Burnt Garlic Chilli Noodles, Nomnom special Rice, Pan fried chilli fish and burnt garlic fish with seasonal veg. Out of these the fish with veggies was amazing and so was the Meifoon and Burnt Garlic noodles. The quality of the food was amazing and quantity wise it was so much that we had to takeaway some.
This was my first visit and I would jump at the chance to revisit this place. Very promising dine in place and truly a star in the making.

Oh how much did I love this place!
Located near the parking lot of Nalban, you can get buses from Ultadanga/Karunamoyee to reach.
I went there on Saptami, which was an unusually hot day, so couldn't experience the outdoor seating.
The insides have minimal decor, nothing extraordinary, and the area is not huge, just enough for maybe 25 people at most. But the overall ambience of the place, with a view of a small lake, is quite beautiful.
The place offers a lot of oriental options. But since we wanted our food quickly we stuck to a basic Chinese order of Chicken Drums of Heaven, Chicken Fried Rice and Garlic Chicken.
The Drums of Heaven were truly heavenly! Succulent chicken pieces in a crispy coating sauted in a spicy sauce, with some onions and bell peppers, it's a burst of flavours in your mouth! 6 leg pieces for 179 is a decent amount to pay.
The fried rice (139) and garlic chicken (189) were very good too! But most importantly, the quantities were huge! Two of us had visited and we had a really hard time eating so much. Took us nearly 2hours to finish the food I cannot remember the number of chicken pieces in the side, either 8 or 10, but absolutely worth the money!
The shameless people that we are wanted to try a dessert too, so we asked about the fried ice cream but unfortunately it was unavailable. So will be back to have that soon!
Also, worth mentioning, they didn't charge any extra tax, as far as I can remember, and staff was courteous too. And, their washroom, even if not very posh, is very clean and hygienic.
Big thumbs up! Keep up the good work. Definitely recommended. üòÉ

This place is unlike others in sector V, located in nalban food park opposite to the road leading to RDB cinemas. The staff is courteous but a little inexperienced. The ambience is amazing, specially the outdoor seating with a view of the nalban lake. Coming to food, we ordered manchow soup, sweet corn soup which were piping hot and taste was good. In starters we had drunken chicken and drumsticks which were the best part. Main course was also great. But the mocktails were the ones to steal the show, pocket friendly and top-notch.

Situated at the exterior part of Saltlake, inside Nalban Food Park. Interior was good and seating arrangements were also good. The staffs were very courteous and humble. They expertise in Thai, Chinese and Asian dishes.

Food: Coming to food, we were¬† four people and had ordered veg sweet corn soup, chicken man chow soup, Rice and Noodles with , Drums of heaven and Drunken fried chicken.¬† Veg sweet corn soup and chicken man chow soup were good. Drums of heaven and Drunken fried chicken were really awesome. Overall the food quality is very good. Lastly we took four mocktails namely pink lemonade, etc and each and every mocktails were too good to taste. This place is worth a visit and I would definitely try to revisit this place soon. 

 Price: This is really a pocket-friendly restaurant. I would suggest this place to them who seeks a place with cheaper food in comparison to other restaurants yet not compromising with the food quality.

Location : At the very start of Nalban Food park.

Food and drinks : Nom Nom is specialized in Thai food and hence we ordered everything from the Thai cuisine. Starting from the dimsum to chicken platter and rice, everything was a really good mixture of taste and flavours.
The mocktail served were above average but looked sexy!

Ambience : The restaurant itself is quite small but their backyard is straight out of fairytale. Do check it out ‚ô•Ô∏è

Pocket Pinch : THE PLACE TO GO!

Bottom Line : If anyone says get together for lunch at the end of the month, I point them towards Nom Nom .

This restaurant truly deserve 5.0 most of the people unknown of this place .I can confidently say they are serving best Chinese dishes in sector 5 area.this is truly a hidden gem.

We had non veg soup,drums of heaven, chicken fried rice,bird eye chilly chicken and cola float.
Every dish was perfect spicy and flavoured.great treat for sweet tooth.
Quantity of every dish was much satisfied.prices are reasonable too.

The restru has Well decorate interior,a small glimpse of Chinese theme, the natural view of nalban is cozy and eye catchy and the staffs are well mannered and friendly.

We had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. The ambience is great with both indoor and outdoor seating.. The price is INCLUSIVE OF TAX and they also offered 10% corporate discount which is really value for money.... However the food tasted average.. Overall only recommended if you are nearby and craving for Chinese..

P.S. The fried ice cream is awesome...

We went here, on a rainy day when the dewdrops were fallen against the window panes. A pretty little place, with absolutely fantastic interiors, the food here is to die for too! Best time to visit this place is the evening or night time! 
This place is exceptionally cheap too! Must visit for all!

Awesome!!

** Corporate discount of 10% if you show your id **

After almost a year I rated a restaurant 5/5.
Nice ambience both indoor and outdoor. Courteous staffs and professional service.

Must try *Sizzling barbecue chicken wings* we had this as a starter and it was so good we ordered again at the end instead of dessert üòÇ

Along with it Nom nom special rice was also good and lill spicy which perfectly complimented bell pepper chicken. 2 appetizers, 1 main course and 1 side was enough for 2 people.

All the prices are pocket friendly & inclusive of taxes, you pay what you see.

Was introduced to this restaurant very recently. During office went there for a quick lunch. The restaurant is fairly new and I hadn‚Äôt heard about this. But now that I have tried this out, I can vouch for it. The food served here is amazing and the quantity is great. We had ordered Lung Fung soup, Fish in Chilly Mustard Sauce, Burnt Garlic Noodles, and a lamb preparation (can‚Äôt recall the name). Everything was delicious, and my personal favourite was the fish. The place is very affordable. I plan to return here very soon and will definitely suggest everyone to try it out. I haven‚Äôt found a place this great in Sector 5 Since Barbeque Nation.

I went to NomNom today . Since i saw such a good review I decided to visit it . Since i was alone i ordered a selfie dish that would suffice 1 person . It was chopped chicken with fried rice .¬†
Now I am not feeling well , the food quality was very bad in taste and the after effect is also worse .¬†
I think somehow something was wrong with the dish that was served to me .

On our quest to try a new place for lunch in sector 5 area. My colleagues & I decided to have our lunch post office at this place. Located near RDB nalban food park gate, the outlet has been beautifully recreated beside the nalban jheel where the diners can enjoy both the food with a good view of the lake. They have AC sitting inside of about 25-30 covers & also outside sitting of around 8-10 covers. The decor is simple yet very eye soothing. The menu boasts a good range of chinese & thai delicacies along with desserts & thirst quenchers.

So from their menu we tried the following:-

1. Kiwi Margarita - They use flavoured syrups for their mocktails. The kiwi margarita wasn't too bad in taste but it certainly could have been made better since it wasn't stirred properly due to the whole taste wasn't relished by us and was rather flat.

2. Pink Lemonade - A sweeter mocktail as compared to the kiwi margarita but again it had the same problem of improper stirring of the syrup.

3. Chilli mustard fish - Beautiful 8pcs of grilled basa tossed in chilli mustard sauce,bell peppers,onions,garlic & chillies. This was a good recommendation from our server & certainly made tastebuds dance. The subte flavour of mustard really stood out. Highly Recommended!!

4. Mixed Nasi Goreng - One of their specialties among the rice staples. The dish comes in a huge bowlful quantity of aromatic rice topped with a sunny side up egg & 2 lime infused grilled chicken skewers. The dish as a whole really just won our heart. The rice had a subtle distinct taste of spicy yet very soothing as found in thai friedrice. The lime infused chicken skewers were also prepared to perfection with chicken being very tender. Recommended!!

5. Nom Nom special chicken noodles - A bowlful of chicken noodles were served topped with prawn chips & thin egg blankets. The noodles were decent at max & didn't make us go wow. So the special noodles unfortunately didn't have the x-factor which we were expecting.

6. Tsing hoi chicken - A spicy side dish which would really compliment your staples. The dish had good quantity of diced chicken along with garlic,onion,mushroom. The taste was simply exemplary. The chicken were tender & the gravy was thoroughly enjoyed by us. Recommended.

7. Fried ice cream - This was the first time i tried a fried ice cream and i simply fell in love for this amazing dessert. The a big single scoop of ice cream had its outer layer fried in cinnamon sugar with a drizzle of chocolate syrup topped it with a luscious cherry. The dessert was really mouthgasmic to say the least & all of us enjoyed it till the last spoon.

The hearty meal was certainly enjoyed by us overcoming the nitty flaws. The staff were really courteous which was reflected during their service. The pocket ping is also on the lower side considering sector 5 standards with per head expense of Rs 380 per head. Also all the prices on the menu are tax inclusive(so no extra taxes YaY :D).

The restaurant is a newly opened one near the paid parking lot of Nalban Sector V. The restaurant has two entrance one on the main road and other from the parking lot.
‚ÄîThe ambience of the restaurant is very nice, with both outside and inside sitting arrangement. 
‚ÄîThe view of the bherry and the sky scrappers near science city are clearly visible with natural beauty, fresh air and less noise. Interior of the restaurant is neat and clean and also spacious with AC.
‚ÄîNow coming to the main thing food, quality, quantity and price.
- Here is visited for two times and I ordered for Sizzling Barbeque Chicken and Drunken Fried Chicken for starter, Assorted Non-Veg Dumplings; authentic mixed fried, authentic chicken fried rice, wok tossed chicken noodles in staples; Bell Pepper Chicken and Devils Crab Meat for Sides. In desert I ordered for Aitim Tod- Fried Ice Cream awesome taste. The food was really good and quantity is also good. 
‚Äî The service of the restaurant is very good and the persons present there were very courteous and also served food on time.

Well this was kind of a family treat! And the decision of the place was good. Bright Colors, clean decor and the lake view- the ambiance couldn't have been better. Coming to our order:

Tom Yum soup: A broth with the flavour of Lemon grass, it was a refreshing taste. The consistency was good and so were the meat and vegetables.

Assorted Dimsum platter: It consisted pork and chicken dimsums. Nothing extra ordinary but definitely tasty.

Fire Cracker prawns: Crispy coated prawns, these are a must try for prawn lovers. It look pretty and it tasted prettier.

Grilled Fish in Chilli Mustard: If you love fish you should try it. If you don't love fish, you must try it. Perfect grilled and an amazing balance of flavours.

Virgin Mojito: That was not Mojito by any means. They should really work on it.

Fruity Punch: A thick shake with fruity flavour in a very creamy base.

Kiwi Margarita: This one is definitely a winner. The green drink was eye appealing and the taste was not something I tried before so I loved it. More so, my sister loved it so much that I didn't get to love it enough.

Overall a pocket friendly place with the taste intact. I would definitely like to revisit sometimes.

Soumyajit Dey and I wanted to have some chienese, consulting zomato we got there. The decor was really appealing. They have colorful wooden chairs and colorful umbrellas hanging in the ceiling. They also have a mocktail bar outside where they provide seating too. It is preferable to seat outside in winter as the scenery is quite good outside. They let us took pics outside where there was a pond and the sunset made the place look heavenly.
Only compromise we had to do was about those flies flying around the table. Otherwise a lovely look and feel.
It is situated in the opposite of the fire station (mentioning as finding the restaurant maybe a little tricky).

We ordered-----

.**Nasi goreng - A red spicy fried rice with mushroom and chicken along with 2 chicken strips in barbeque skewers and a pan poached egg. The dish was quite spicy yet so flavourful and delicious. They serve so good amount of food in a bowl that it would be enough for 2 people.

.**Hot garlic chicken - 10 pieces boneless fried chicken in hot, spicy and garlicky gravy that was finger licking good.

.**Kiwi blast - very odinary mocktail, not so special. We thought they would add kiwi crushes but they served kiwi juice in lemony sugar syrup which didn't taste very good.

This Thai-chienese fusion restaurant is a must try for all who wants a pocket friendly yet delicious food. A very good experience visiting nomnom. Will come back soon.

First of all the address given here is absolutely wrong. You have to go all the way towards the ring road to find this place. It's a cute little joint overlooking the pond there. When there a few days back with my friend.
Tried the garlic chicken and aunthentic egg fried rice.
One of each was enough for the two of us.
They serve 10 pieces of chicken and the gravy was medium spicy. 
Overall loved the food and ambience.
Perks-no gst as of yet.

Located at a very inconspicuous corner of the nalban food park, this hidden gem is truly a foodie's delight. Especially if you are on a tight budget, this restaurant is just perfect. The decor is simple and minimalistic with even a outside seating arrangement. We tried a soup and then chicken gravy noodles and must say both were much better than my expectations. The noodle was filled with assorted exotic veggies and tasted just perfect( although the noodles could have been slightly softer but thats pardonable). Overall a very peaceful and quiet place to have food in good environment.

If you are looking for an open restaurant to visit during a cool afternoon or evening, this is the place for you. You can visit it even if you don't want that because they have arrangements of serving food indoors as well. But let me warn beforehand that it might not be a very easy task to locate this restaurant. The Google maps will probably guide you wrong, it is likely that your Uber will drop you at Nalbon but you will be all confused as to where to find the restaurant. Anyway once you walk in, you'll realize that the little hassle was worth it.

The interiors are very colourful with the chairs being of various colours and colour coordinated with that of the tables and the cushion. Colourful umbrellas hang from the ceiling to add to the vibrance of the indoors. If you wish to eat in the open, you will have a beautiful feeling of having your food in a village landscape. The outdoor dining area has a rustic look that is perfect for a winter afternoon or a cool summer evening.

The place claims to serve authentic Thai and Chinese food and thus they call themselves 'the Thainese Restaurant'. We ordered the pan fried chilli fish for starter. It was a very spicy dish and as the nane suggests, it actually had too many chillies in it. The fish was incredibly soft and succulent. For the main course, we ordered Nasi Goreng and bang bang Chicken for the sides. I must say that the Nasi Goreng was the show stealer of the day. The rice was extremely soft and had chunks of chicken. It comes with a single egg poach that adds to the taste. You get two chicken skewers with the rice. Overall, if you order Nasi Goreng, you actually don't need sides because we loved it so much that we refused the bang bang chicken to steal its thunder for the most part. The bang bang chicken on the other hand was a delicious dish itself with shredded chicken. The curry had black sauce and there were mushrooms added to it. Everything was served in a very large quantity so you should order accordingly. We were disappointed when we came to know that only darshan was available for dessert. Since we're not huge fans of that particular dessert, we had to go without dessert. 

It was overall a nice experience. The food was good. The indoor dining space, inspite of being colourful and vibrant, is very congested. The staffs were fine. The service was very fast. They didn't charge GST so the purses were happy!

This place deserves a 5. The only disappointing aspect about it is the non availability of the fried ice cream. I don't exactly remember the names of all the dishes we had, but each and every item we ordered was extraordinary. The d√©cor was simple and yet elegant. We ordered 3 types of soup, one containing coconut milk (Tom Kha), One containing lemon grass (Tom yum) and one with egg whites(lung Fung). Do not get carried away in hunger. They are served so hot that they will burn your mouth. The taste of specially the lung Fung and Tom Kha was spot on. For starters we ordered murtabak( chicken and mutton), and wok tossed fish. The murtabak was a meat stuffed parantha type, more like moglai without eggs. It comes in 4 pieces. The taste is amazing. The wok tossed fish was super too and came in 8 pieces. For mains, we had shangdon butter rice which tasted delicious, and the Nadi goreng fried rice. This is a must have, and I will just leave it at that, or else it will act like a GOT spoiler. For sides, we got fish prepared in clay pot. Without a doubt, the softest and juiciest pieces of bhetki I have ever had! We had some pretty cool drinks too. At the end I would like to say that Nom Nom is love, if your tongue and stomach has heart!
2nd visit: This time they had fried ice cream, only solidified my rating for the place!!

This is a 5 mins walk from my office. I had heard rave reviews of it from friends and colleagies and decided to have lunch on a weekday. We turned up at around 12.45 and good that we did because by 1.30 it was full. It is a small place with an outdoor setting as well, with only 2 tables outside. 
Whatever one looks for in an eatery- Nomnom has it all- great food, good ambience, quick service and lots of selfie zones! 
Overlooking the sector V lake and quaintly decorated, it has quite an impressive menu. We had 3 kinds of soups- all delicious. One should definitely try the Muttabak (appetizer) - both chicken and mutton, the
Wok tossed fish and Shangdon Butter Rice. We had also ordered Nasi Goreng- it was a bit too spicy.
The mocktails were ok- ish. My Kiwi Margharita had a candy-like taste, which I did not quite like. We wanted to have Fried Ice Cream for dessert but that was not available.
For 6 of us, it was 1700, with tax and after 10% discount.

went on soshti this year , with office colleagues for having lunch . actually it was unplanned though our office is situated just beside this Nom Nom . anyway we haven't booked it prior .¬†
let me help you locate this place : this is just located opposite J J Medical center . bus stop is Cognizant (If you are coming from Nicco Park) then go towards ring road and if coming towards Niccon Park then stoppage is J J Medical center .
Decoration is quite good , it looks cool and trendy. I didnt understand what are significances of hanging umbrellas though it looks really good . they have outdoor sitting options too.¬†
Food quality is normal , nothing special to say and not over priced according to food quality and quantity .¬†
Hospitality is good , and not great .

In one word---its just perfect! From all possible respect- be it food, ambience, location, decor, service. Located in Nalban, Salt Lake. Quite easy to locate and you have a BIG( yeah trust me its that big to write it in caps) car parking lot just beside the restaurant. There is also an entrance to the restro from the parking lot side. Now, why the location deserves more points is because of the beautiful scene it offers as you sit outside or inside overlooking a lake and lots of greenery around though the place is a tech-hub with all sorts of giant structures inhabited by corporates working 24X7. Its like an oasis in the middle of an otherwise crazy world. There are two seating arrangements- one is indoors, an air-conditioned area with seats for around 30 or so and the other is outdoors, a fenced area with umbrella made of straws covering tables and seats.
We went there for a Nabami lunch this year and was surprised to find it quite empty. We were lucky enough to find so because just after that large groups started filling in the empty restro. We ordered for Red Chilli Paradox Chicken, Sizzling Barbequed chicken, Kaffir Chicken and Wok Tossed Pepper Fish as starters. Chilli Paradox Chicken was indeed a bit paradoxical as the taste was on the sweeter side. Its one of their specialities. We wanted to have Martaba Chicken as we had heard about it a lot. But the waiter gave a confusing reply stating the reason for the non-availability of the dish and we were really very disappointed. But the rest of the starters totally compensated for the Martaba. Sizzling Barbequed Chicken is a must-have. Small crunchy pieces of chicken tossed in an tangy sweet sauce which will make u lick ur fingers long after you have finished with your dish.The soothing flavor of lemongrass in case of Kaffir Chicken and soft Bansha pieces with perfect outer coating in case of Wok Tossed Pepper Fish will instantly make u fall in love with them. Two things that are again worth mentioning is the quantity and the service. The dishes were served within 10-15 mins of ordering and also the reason for unavailability of Martaba was the considerable amount of time that goes in preparing it. This proves that they don't want their customers to be waiting. The waiters were courteous and helpful. Again, lets come back to the food. The main course consisted of Khao Phad Thai Stir Fried Rice, Thai Chilli Rice; Kaeng Ped Gai Chicken which was a yellowish green curry served along with rice sprinkled with spring onions on top. Quite a common dish that you'll get in any Thai restro. The curry had this queer taste of coconut oil. We also ordered for Chilli Basil Fish in a clay pot which was quite good as well. We had Khus Lime Cups and Fruit Punch as mocktails. Both were pretty good. I liked the fruit punch more. For desserts, we only ordered for Aitim Tod Fried Ice cream. It was nice and reminded me of paatishapta ice cream i had in some other place.
You might be wondering what the bill turned out to be since we ordered so many dishes. But you won't believe, the bill was way below of what we expected. One point is that the place is very economic considering the location and the cuisine they are offering with their own touch of innovation.They didn't even charge any tax or I think it was included in the menu. Another thing I almost missing out on mentioning is about the quirky decor the place has. With checkered designs of the seats and colorful umbrellas on the ceiling, it makes u feel like as if u are in a Wes Anderson movie set! So, give this place a try even if you aren't a Wes Anderson fan.

This place is so difficult to locate if you take the help of Google maps! We had to literally roam for around half an hour just to find the entrance.
The best direction I can give will be the car parking area of Nalban. There is a small decorated gate that leads directly to the restaurant. 
The location is beautiful. They've both an indoor and an outdoor seating area. Since it was raining, we had to opt for the indoor area. We took a seat by the window side to enjoy the scenic beauty. 
Coming to the food, their much celebrated Murtabak and Randang fish was unavailable. We had no other option and had to settle for Red chilli paradox chicken as an appetizer. It was great. Not spicy. Serves perfectly as an appetizer. We also ordered for a Kiwi mocktail which had the perfect concoction of the kiwi pulp and soda.
For the main course we opted for a plate of chicken Nasi Goreng and bang bang chicken. The Nasi Goreng was served in a huge quantity. A plate will suffice 3 people. It came with two chicken skewers that had been prepared with lemon zest and had a very wonderful taste. And a sunny side up. The rice tasted fine. Bang bang chicken too was up to the mark and the chicken pieces were soft and well prepared. 
The second disappointment came when they said they can't serve us with the fried ice cream. So, we asked for the available desserts, which too came as a disappointment as they had no desserts. I had deducted points for the unavailability issue because 3 of the most famous items were unavailable for tasting.

Food quantity is good and quality is good too with pocket friendly menu . Liked their grilled fish in mustard sauce - somewhat spicy but good in taste. Fish was very soft in texture too. Tried their burnt garlic noodles and tsing hoi chicken as well. Tsing is too spicy with either shredded pieces or small bite size- as you want. Rice and  were okay. Delivery time was fastest and that was unexpected. They delivered within 30 minutes as promised over phone. Also they have a pocket friendly menu.Thank you.

Newly opened and on every techie's to-do list, this place is a little removed from the hustle and bustle of Sec 5 proper. It is situated on the Ring road, closer to Nalban and RDB cinemas Lane.
We went there on a Friday evening and it was satisfyingly empty. The restaurant is minimalistic in its decor and has two tables by the lawn for the outdoorsy folks amongst us. They should really maintain the lawn and light it up, that would really make for a perfect romantic sit down. Enough about the surroundings, let's get to the food.
For the starter, we ordered Chicken Muttabak, which was recommended by our maitre d'. It's essentially a distant Malaysian cousin of the Kolkata Moghlai Paratha, a pancake of a chicken stuffing. This one tasted okayish, not the stars that we were promised. For the main course, we ordered Burnt Chili Garlic Noodles and Mandarin Fish. Both of them were very well made, and tremendous portions, easily feeding two people. The noodles were a bit too spicy, so customise according to your palate.

All in all, a fantastic eatery, with reasonable prices and generous quantities. Keep up the good work!

Although happened to discover this place by chance, yet am delighted to have experienced the taste of food here. ¬†It was a pleasant dining experience . Absolutely loved the burnt chilli garlic noodles and bell pepper chicken. Taste and quality was up to the mark. Price was reasonable depending on the quality and proportion of the dishes. Liked the interior decor along with the outside sitting arrangement in the open space. Would definitely recommend everyone. Spent a lovely evening here. Will surely visit again.

This place is truly a hidden gem. Great food, great service, wonderful ambience. The location of this place is just beside a lake overlooking a lush green ground. There is outside seating arrangements apart from the usual AC seating. I visited this place on a weekday afternoon to beat the rush of the weekends. The food that we ordered is as follows:

1. Lung Fung soup : mildly flavored. Just the right amount of chicken and shrimps, topped with frothy egg white.
2.Sizzling barbequed chicken : delightful chunks of chicken doused in a spicy sweet barbeque sauce. Crunchy on the outside, juicy inside.
3. NomNom special fried rice (mixed): Nice presentation. It comes topped with a fried egg and a couple of fish flavored wafers. The quantity is sufficient for two people. There is ample amount of chicken, shrimps, mushroom and veggies.
4. Fish in chilli basil sauce: Basa fish in semi spicy gravy flavored with basil leaves. Goes well with rice preparations.
5. Sweet lime juice: Served in a mug like container. Refreshingly cool.
6. Fried ice-cream: this is vanilla ice-cream fried with a coating on the outside and topped with chocolate sauce and cherry. Nice way to end a heavy meal.

All of the above preparations were excellent. Service was prompt and attentive. All in all, this place has all it takes to give a wonderful dining experience. Highly recommended!!

Visited here yesterday after getting recommendation from my friendz ..... thankful that i did so .... :)

GREAT QUANTITY : 1 plate main course (noodles , rice ,ricenoodles, ,etc) would suffice more than 1 avg person , though for big foodies like me, 1 plate would sufficiently suffice just one person.

GREAT TASTE¬† : I had double cooked lamb in starters, then had rice noodles and authentic fried rice along with¬† Bird Eye chilli chicken ....... Taste was really good but double cooked lamb deserves a special mention ,it was awesome ..... Bird eye chilli chicken had 10 pieces so quantitywise like i mentioned its a thumbsup from me ...... would try other dishes too to have as broader experience .....

GOOD PRICING : Pricing w.r.t the quantity and taste i would say is NOT at all on the higher side .....infact quite cheap specially considering the fact that prices ARE INCLUSIVE of TAXES , so the extra 18% (or whatever) doesn't get added up in bills ,which i think is a USP in today's era .......

AMBIENCE is ok .....u have the option to sit outside as well and enjoy the greenary and the lake,etc , apart from the option of sitting indoors (yaa its airconditioned inside) .....

Overall i would definitely visit again and refer u to do the same ......

This place is a revelation. amongst the steel and glass jungle in sector V and having probably one of the best views in town, this one is a must visit. The good part is, it has got a huge paid car parking attached- so, nothing to worry about. Firstly, the portion size if huge and can easily be split between 2 hungry souls. Amongst the items, the veg nasi goreng was slightly less spicy and I was told that can be customized- good. The crispy veg kafir lime had a distinctly fresh limey essence, which is pretty rare these days. The thai thigh chicken was pretty good and the best part was, they used only the drumstick boneless meat for this dish.¬†

Personally, I hate Basa and so, randang fish was not my type. But the fried icecream made up for it. We shared one portion between two of us and it was sufficient.¬†

Overall, recommended and an evening there is definitely worth the travel.

They have huge parking space.Ambience is very beautiful rather superb. I found the place was not at all overpriced, food good both in terms of quality and quantity. We took some nonveg appetizers , noodles and a side dish. They don't charge gst. Prices are all inclusive of taxes. Thanks!
P.s they provide outdoor sitting too. So you can enjoy your food looking at the nalban lake. It's damn romantic.

Amidst the hustle bustle of Sector V, if you're searching for a cosy nook with a mesmerizing view, Nomnom is here! Located at Nalban Food Park, this is a beautifully decorated Oriental restaurant. Serving some of the best Thai and Chinese dishes, this Thainese restaurant is a hidden gem. 
Perfect for romantic dates and get-togethers, Nomnom will not in the least bit disappoint you.

Nomnom is an absolute hidden gem in the city. This place is a beautiful Oriental eatery among the numerous pubs in the Sector V area. The wonderful ambience is very pleasing to the eye. But the reason why this place has become my recent favourite, is the amazing Oriental food they serve, and that too with absolute authenticity.

We were two of us. It was lunch time. We started with mocktails. The Blue Lagoon and Starwberry Lava was what we went for. The Blue Lagoon was very refreshing, chilled and fizzy. The strawberry lava looked beautiful. It was equally refreshing and pleasing to the taste buds.

For starters, we went for Murtabak, Randang Fish and Sizzling Barbecue Chicken. Murtabak was a sheer winner. It is an Indo Muslim speciality from Malaysia where crispy pancakes are stuffed with minced chicken. I was completely lost in its flavours. The chicken stuffing was spicy and tasted great. The dip served aside was perfect in complementing it.

Randang Fish had basa fillets marinated with spicy Randang paste, which were wrapped in banana leaves and grilled. The smoky and spicy flavour of the fish was amazing. The sizzling Barbeque Chicken had chicken cubes tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce and served on a sizzler plate. The unique sweet and spicy flavour of the chicken was beautiful.

Moving on the main course, we had Mixed Nasi Goreng and Chilly Basil Fish. The Nasi Goreng looked amazing. It was loaded generously with chicken, egg and shrimps and was topped with a sunny side up egg. It was undoubtedly the best Nasi Goreng I've ever had. The flavours and the use of spices were perfect. One can have this even without a side dish. The Chilli Basil Fish somewhat complemented it. The fish was soft and fresh. The gravy had a beautiful flavour of basil.

Overall, such amazing Oriental delights at such pocket friendly rates is beyond imagination. The ones working in Sec V or are staying nearby, are lucky enough to have such an amazing place in their vicinity. Though the management suggested us to try Fried Ice Cream for desserts, we were too full to go for. Would definitely try it on my next visit.

Wanted to visit this place for a long time and finally got the opportunity. Though, we did takeaway, so can't really comment on the ambiance. But, judging from the looks, it looked cozy, and the staff were very good. Now let's get down to the food.

Pan fried chili fish - The zomato suggestion never lies. It was simply amazing. Succulent and tender pieces (8 pieces) of brilliantly cooked fish. This is MUST order!

Bang Bang Chicken - This was special too. Amidst generous portions of mushroom and what i think to be black beans (am sorry, if am wrong), the chicken pieces were very tender and flavourful.

Wok Tossed Chicken Hakka Noodles - Noodles was very good too. Was it the best? Nope. But was it good? You bet! Though a bit more veggies would have helped.

Burnt Garlic Spring Onion Chicken Fried Rice - Excellent! Though, a bit more veggies would have helped, as I like my fried rice with a lot of veggies.

Final verdict - Cheap and excellent food, along with a good ambience makes this a must visit.

PS - It has a 10% discount for all PwC employees. The only catch is, you have to pay in cash to avail the discount.

We went to this place for lunch. It has both indoor and outdoor sitting facilities. The outdoor would have been an excellent choice if weather is good. However we chose the indoor option as it was very hot. The whole ambiance is nice, Seats are comfortable, tables are not very congested. The waiters are well behaved, but service is on slower side. the food is very good. Very light and tasty. Portion is more than expected at this price. Overall a fantastic choice for lunch or dinner.

And that's actually we are. This time target was Nom Nom @Sector V Salt Lake. As the name suggests, we did the same while devouring the delicacies. Nom nom !

We adjured for assorted non-veg dim sum platter which included prawn wonton, fish and chicken momo. Chinese successfully trespassed this time to satisfy our tongue. With dim sum platter, we also enjoined for Randang fish in banana leaf: fillet of Vietnamese basa submerged in a spicy rending wash and grilled in banana leaf; crispy chilly baby corn: indeed very much crispy in taste; and aitim tod: fried ice cream. Cherish every scoop of it. 

Mesmerized by the service, food and ambience of it. Colourful. And this beautiful moment was charged only 656/-.

For a peaceful date, you can go for it. Thanks for reading. Follow me on Instagram/ Zomato @ Supratik Chakravarty or on chakravarty8supratik.wordpress.com

I had been to this place for a quick dinner with my wife ,1.8 year old daughter and my father in law. We ordered 2 sweet corn chicken soup, 1 authentic chicken fried rice, and bang bang chicken. Quantity was sufficient for 3 of us as my daughter ate soup only. food taste was good. bang bang chicken pieces were some where between slice and chunk.There is also outdoor seating facility and view towards lake I think is very nice. Over all very much value for money restaurant with nice decor a combination which is rare in and around sector 5.¬†
¬†I will definite go there again for other foods they offer.
There is a large parking space adjacent to the restaurant where parking fees is 75 rs for any duration between 7:30 am -10 pm. I feel for people coming to restaurant this parking should be free or nominally charged. ¬†I had given 3.5 only because the lack of free parking and since I had tasted only a few of their dishes. This place is definitely worth trying in sector 5 . ¬†I will definite go there again for other foods they offer and then again give review accordingly.

Visited this place on a weekday for lunch. It is a quaint little place with a panoramic view since it is situated  just beside the lake. The decor is mild and soothing with Thai influence (as can be deduced from the name). Food is really good. We tried the nom nom special noodles ,lamb chops with lemon grass rice, nasi goreng, Thai red curry,etc with mocktails. Mocktails can be bit better. The food was very good-light and authentic. The quantity was optimum. Staff is very courteous and well mannered. Overall a very good experience.

This is my new favourite joint in salt lake. This quaint little eatery is bang opposite Tangerine Banquet hall and quite a heart stealer in terms of food, ambience and price. Their food is sumptuous, light, and overflowing in quantity. Just call ahead to ensure you don't have to wait. Instead of reading about Whatcom good, just give it a go and see for yourself. If the menu sounds doubtful ask the sservers they are more than happy to help.

I have tried dishes from this place a number of times after its opening.A very recent addition to Salt Lake this place has become quite popular very quickly.I have tried a couple of prawn dishes and considering the price,the size of prawns they offer is really impressive.Though I did not find it to be proper fresh prawns but comparing other places this was much more acceptable.I also tried the Thai chicken which was supposed to be a grilled version of chicken thigh as the description suggests in the menu,but it was basically a dry curry of chicken thigh which had a very rich coconut milk base with loads of thai herbs.The taste was really different and very delightful.I also tried the devil's crab meat but unfortunately it was not spicy for me at all unlike the name of the preparation and though they do not use immitation crab meat but the quantity of crab in the dish is really low,most of it is batter so maybe I won't go for a second crab dish at this place.Another special mention for me was the lung fung soup.This was by far the best lung fung soup I ever tasted.Spice lovers,please add a couple spoonfuls of the chilli sauce they provide to this soup and I bet you'll love it.I am looking forward to dining in this place soon and trying every other item they have in their menu.

Feel the Thainese @ Nom Nom

Ever wondered,  what's it like sitting by the lake and having sumptous momos or else thought of dropping into Thai village with coloured bamboo shafts? Or visiting a place lush green,  by the water body, sitting under mini huts with straw thatched roof and that too in the concrete jungle of Kolkata ? If your answer is NO,  let me take you to a ride of NomNom - one of the newest place of the town. 

NomNom - The Thainese restaurant serves a cuisine which is a blend of Authentic Chinese and Thai cuisine.  Popular Chinese and Thai dishes have been blended together to suit the taste buds of the locals. 

Location : It's situated in NALBAN FOOD PARK, Kolkata, Sector V, Salt Lake City at the Gate no. 6 near SDF. 

Decor and Ambience : The restro is casual diner with an ambience to die for. The restaurant section is decorated with coloured sticks and wooden furnishings which gives it a very rustic look. The major attraction is however the outdoor seating arrangements amidst a Thainese village, a vast stretch of water which indeed makes it a picturesque spot. The greenery and the serene environment is perfect to get a relief from the monotony of life. All this in Kolkata? Unbelievable! 

Beverages:
Love in afternoon - A delicious drink for Love in the Afternoon, with strawberry liqueur, orange juice and coconut juice.

Sunrise frenzy - The Ideal Mocktail for a Casual Brunch made from bananas syrup topped with orange and pineapple juice.

Pink lemonade - Strawberry crush with fresh lime juice and soda.

Kala khatta - One thing that we all love during the hot and humid summer months in India is ‚ÄúKala Khatta‚Äù‚Äì black and tart, made with the concentrated juice of the Java Plum flavoured with jaljeera.

Khus Lime cups - Lemon and khus are both summer buddies! These flavours tend to provide a sense of relief from the heat . Khus syrup dipped in lime,vanilla ice cream and soda. 

Appetizers:

Assorted non veg dimsum platter- Humble dimsums with 8 pieces of assorted pieces of chicken, fish and prawn. To all the Momo lover's,  a must try. 

Rendang fish in banana leaf- The Nom Nom goodness of Vietnamese origin. This is basa fillet washed in rendang sauce and grilled in banana leaf. Rendang uses coconut milk (Minangkabau: karambia) and a paste of mixed ground spices, including ginger, galangal, turmeric leaves, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, chillis, and other spices. This contemporary form of Bhetki Paturi with twist is a must try 

Chicken murtabak- The Indo-Muslim speciality from Malaysia, this is pancake stuffed with chicken,  a very contemporary form of Kolkata Mughlai Partha.

Main course:

Phad Thai noodles- This delicacy from Phuket is worth the try. Rice noodle stir-fry with scrambled egg, napa and red cabbage, citrus, peanuts, Asian sprouts, green onions and cilantro, serves with sauteed chicken.

Fish in chilly oyster sauce- Stir fried fish in Cantonese sauce served with seasonal veggies. 

Bang Bang chicken - This is an authentic Chinese delicacy.  Amazingly crisp chicken bites drizzled with sweet chili mayo ‚Äì so good, you‚Äôll want double or triple of it. 

Mee Goreng- The Indonesian fried noodles were simply something to relish. Teamed great with h Fish in chilly oyster sauce.

Red Thai Curry - The tomato based red Thai curry is such a delight when served with plain white rice. 

So finally the monsoons are in.  Get ready to get drenched not only by the rains but also amazing oriental at NomNom,  The Trainer restaurant. Cheers! 
Cheers!

Nom Nom was on our wish list after going through some good reviews and decided to visit this place today . The combination of Thai & Chinese ( Thainese as they call it ) had attracted us very much. The view of the approach route to this place through the Ring Road in Sector V is very picturesque with water bodies on one side & towering office complexes on the other side .The place is just before the Cognizant & beside Nalban Food Park . It has one of the best scenic views among the restaurants in the Kolkata.Though it's a small place but has nicely decorated interiors . Parking is readily available .Staffs are friendly & eager to serve . Had some issues with flies inside the place although staffs tried their best to rectify the problem . Coming to the food tried the following : 
Assorted Veg Dimsums Platter : Contained 8 pieces of dimsums with generous amount of stuffing . The associated chilly sauce was quite good . Would love to try out non veg platter later on .
Rangdang Fish : Two pieces of fresh Basa fish wrapped & cooked with spices inside banana leaf ( reminded me of our very own Paturi ) . The dish comes with vegetables & 2 pieces of wantons . Had read a lot about this particular dish & enjoyed it .
Brunt Garlic Spring Onion Rice  : Asked them to make it less spicy & they obliged . Quantity is sufficient & tastewise very nice .
Burnt Chilli Garlic Noodles : Again requested to make it let spicy & got it accordingly . This was a very tasty dish .
Bird Eye Chili Chicken : This was the best of the lot . Quantity is sufficient & the gravy was brilliant . Really liked it .
Crabmeat in Chilli Oyester Sauce : Another good preparation . Though my companion said it was a bit salty but I personally liked it . 
Darsan with Ice Cream : Two scoops of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup & Darsan . A good dessert . 
The total bill was Rs 1303/- which is quite pocket friendly given the quantity & quality of food we consumed .
Will definitely come back to try out their other delicacies .

Feeling drowsy ¬†and bored due to the incessant rains? Well here‚Äôs a place which can lift your mood instantly solely because of it‚Äôs ambiance;the newest addition to the plethora of restros and pubs that Sector V has to offer- Nomnom. Going by the looks of it, rooftop cafes and open air restaurants seems to be the newest trend. This one is an exception. They do have outdoor seating arrangements but the main attraction of this place is the vast stretch of water which indeed makes it a picturesque spot. Located conveniently near sdf more this waterside ‚ÄúThainese ‚Äù restaurant is definitely worth a visit.

A Thainese Restaurant. Serves foods which are Thai or Chinese cuisine. Well versed restaurant with culturally ambient. Rate of foods are affordable. Quantity is good for one and Quality is good and tasty. It was a team lunch. Whatever you order, don't forget to order 'Mein goon', a rice noodles with 'Bang Bang chicken' which is made with Black Bean Sauce. It's really tasty. Thanks guys for a good food treat.

Even before visiting Nomnom, it was love at first sight for me.... all thanks to the photos and the menu on Zomato!! üòç After following the place for sometime, finally visited it a couple of weeks back. At my very first visit, I sooo loved the place, that this week I ended up at their door 3 times in a row. Nomnom has now become our most regular hangout.

Location: Situated near Nalban car parking area, it stands diagonally opposite to Tangerine banquets, a 10 minutes walk from Godrej Waterside.

Infra: Nomnom has both Indoor as well as Outdoor seating areas. The outdoor seating area is what I loved the most about the place. A small and sweet area, representing the look of a countryside, it rests at a small distance from the lake. During the evening, it is all lit up and looks so pretty. The indoor area is decorated in vibrant colors, be it the chairs or the umbrellas on the ceiling.

Food: Food is simply fab over here!! During my multiple visits, I've tried the following cumulatively;

Prawn Dimsums: Each one is filled with more than decent amount of shrimps. Tastes just Wow!! The dip along with it is also great! üç•

Chicken Dimsums: Tastes quite good! üç•

Burnt Chilli Garlic Noodles: Spicy and yummy. If you're not too fond of spicy stuff, stay away from it! üçù

Bird Eye Chilli Chicken: My most favorite pick over here, alongside prawn dimsum. This item is just too too good. A must try!! üçó

Chicken in Black Pepper Sauce: Prepared with whole black peppers and a wide variety of veggies, this item was also quite good. üçñ

Fried Ice Cream: Vanilla Ice Cream, golden fried, topped with a cherry, it's a must for us on each visit. Delicious!! üç®

Other orders consisted of Mushroom in Chilli Sauce, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Fruity Punch mocktail, all of which kept very well up to the standard!! üòäüòäüòä

Staff were nice and courteous. üíÅ

Overall, it's a 100% value for money place!! I love Nomnom. Will be back again soon!! üíù

Recommeded!!

We had a great experience at Nom Nom. Initially it was difficult for us to find the place. The food was really tasty. The quantity of every dish is enough for any foodies. We had Nom Nom special mixed fried rice and Hot garlic chicken . Rice was indeed mouth watering. Behaviour of stuff and the owner is really appreciated . We will definitely come again for sure. One suggestion, don't just judge by the size of the restaurant.

The place was so so hard to find
The maps show it wrong, the cab showed it wrong
Its actually close to 10 downing street.
Anyway, after an hour walk, we finally found it.
The place is really nice and i wish we can visit it again when its not raining and after sun sets.
Ordered the barbecued chicken from starters and fried ice cream to end.. weren't very hungry
But both of them were good
The staff was well behaved and the ambience, as i said, takes your mind off everything

At my very first visit, I sooo loved the place, that this week I ended up at their door 3 times in a row. Nomnom has now become our most regular hangout.

Location: Situated near Nalban car parking area, it stands diagonally opposite to Tangerine banquets, a 10 minutes walk from Godrej Waterside.

Infra: Nomnom has both Indoor as well as Outdoor seating areas. The outdoor seating area is what I loved the most about the place. A small and sweet area, representing the look of a countryside, it rests at a small distance from the lake. During the evening, it is all lit up and looks so pretty. The indoor area is decorated in vibrant colors, be it the chairs or the umbrellas on the ceiling.

Food: Food is simply fab over here!! During my multiple visits, I've tried the following cumulatively;

Prawn Dimsums: Each one is filled with more than decent amount of shrimps. Tastes just Wow!! The dip along with it is also great! üç•

Chicken Dimsums: Tastes quite good! üç•

Burnt Chilli Garlic Noodles: Spicy and yummy. If you're not too fond of spicy stuff, stay away from it! üçù

Bird Eye Chilli Chicken: My most favorite pick over here, alongside prawn dimsum. This item is just too too good. A must try!! üçó

Chicken in Black Pepper Sauce: Prepared with whole black peppers and a wide variety of veggies, this item was also quite good. üçñ

Fried Ice Cream: Vanilla Ice Cream, golden fried, topped with a cherry, it's a must for us on each visit. Delicious!! üç®

Other orders consisted of Mushroom in Chilli Sauce, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Fruity Punch mocktail, all of which kept very well up to the standard!! üòäüòäüòä

Staff were nice and courteous. üíÅ

Overall, it's a 100% value for money place!! I love Nomnom. Will be back again soon!! üíù

Recommeded!!

We had a great experience at Nom Nom. Initially it was difficult for us to find the place. The food was really tasty. The quantity of every dish is enough for any foodies. We had Nom Nom special mixed fried rice and Hot garlic chicken . Rice was indeed mouth watering. Behaviour of stuff and the owner is really appreciated . We will definitely come again for sure. One suggestion, don't just judge by the size of the restaurant.

The place was so so hard to find
The maps show it wrong, the cab showed it wrong
Its actually close to 10 downing street.
Anyway, after an hour walk, we finally found it.
The place is really nice and i wish we can visit it again when its not raining and after sun sets.
Ordered the barbecued chicken from starters and fried ice cream to end.. weren't very hungry
But both of them were good
The staff was well behaved and the ambience, as i said, takes your mind off everything

Chinese-Thai combination just Rocks.. :)

I visited this place thrice in one month and the only reason for it was FOOD.. it's delicious it's pocket friendly n of course Chinese Food what they serve is bit different from other Chinese Outlet in terms of taste.. 
.
Staffs are very well mannered.. n I appreciate the way they keep a look at every table.. u don't even have to serve it ur own they will come to serve before it finishes in ur plate.. 
.
Price is something which is very attractive... It's cheap compare to the quality they serve..

Overall it's a good place to enjoy food at low cost with family friends.. 
.
N of course one last Thing... Ambience.. indoor - outdoor both.. wat else u can ask for.. :)

What an experience I have had today. I have visited Nom Nom today. It was a very good place for authentic chinese food. Good thing is , it is within the walking distance. The restaurent is very well decorated and location is beautiful. Today I have tasted sweet and sour soup, Sizzling barbecued chicken & burnt chilly garlic noodles. All the items are very good in taste. Specially the barbeque chicken although it is lillte bit spicy  but taste is very good. Quantity is also good. Love to go there again.

We have seen some lovely Photos and good reviews of this restaurant. So we really wanted to check this place out. Today me with my girlfriend visited this place for lunch. The restaurant is located in Nalban Food Park Car parking area. This is a small  Thainese(Thai & Chinese) kind of a eatery with nicely decorated interiors.
We Ordered : Masala Thumbs up, Kala khatta, Schezwan Pepper prawn, Randang Fish and Grilled Fish with Burnt Ginger Rice.

# Masala Thumbs up was nicely made but the Kala khatta drink was average. Didn't like that much.
# Schezwan Pepper prawn was just fantastic. Lovely big 6 Pieces of Freshly prepared prawns stirfried with bell peppers and tomatoes. Just wowww.
# Randang Fish was something very special. 2 big pieces of Pure Betki Fish wrapped in a banana leaf with the traditional Randang masala. Served with 2 pieces of Fried Chicken wantons and mixed Salad. Fish was very very fresh and juicy. Will recommend everyone to try this dish.
# we also ordered a plate of Grilled Fish with Burnt Ginger Rice. Veg Rice served with 2 pieces of Grilled Fish in a Coconut based gravy. Rice was very well seasoned and had slight burnt flavour in it.

Staffs were very very professional and courteous. Service was excellent too. Prices were very reasonable and all the dishes in the menu card were inclusive of all the taxes. If you love Fish and sea food then I highly recommend this restaurant.....

Located few yards away from the Nalban lake, this place shields you from the cacophony and hustle-bustle of sector V. It has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Beautifully decorated in shades of red and white, the interior is crisp and tasteful. Food was decent. Service pleasant. Overall, a refreshing break from the regular restaurants of sector V.

Hidden gem of the Sector V area

Food: We went after the lunch hours. Ordered 2 mocktails, Sunset frenzy n Kiwi Margaritta. Both mocktails were refreshing and filling. In appetizers, we ordered Assorted Non veg dimsum platter which contained 8 pieces of momo (chicken, prawn and fish). The momos were pretty big in size and tasted good. However, soup wasn‚Äôt provided. In main course, we ordered Chicken Mei Goreng and Crab meat in chilli oyster sauce. Both the items came in huge quantity and tasted pretty good. However, the oil quotient was a little on the higher side. But overall, the food was satisfying. And particularly the crab meat was mouth watering.

Ambiance: The place scores high on ambiance. Located just beside the Nalban lake, the place has both indoor and outdoor seating. Since it was a sultry summer afternoon, we chose the indoor seating. The interior has both the road side view as well as the lake view. The indoors are beautifully decorated with colored umbrellas and Buddha paintings And the outdoor has the mocktail counter and little hay umbrellas to sit under. Place is tidy and well maintained. Its just walking distance from the RDB movie hall. Parking is inside Nalban area and free.

Service: The hospitality was awesome. May be due to the post lunch hours, but the place was empty even on a Saturday. The staffs were very courteous and well informed about the menu. They knew when they were needed and when not. That‚Äôs a rare quality in restaurant staffs nowadays. Cash and card both are accepted. And the best part is they still haven‚Äôt started charging taxes and hence the bill stays pretty well under budget. 

Overall: Had a very satisfying experience. Scores high on ambiance and service. Food is also not bad. Recommended for anyone who wants to try Thai food and Chinese food in sector V area.

Recently I had made an take away order from NOM NOM for a family dinner. After reading through all the reviews I decided to try something different. Went in for the Thai food. 
We had ordered a range of stuff and realised that these food are better had on spot, coz when you have them at home they loose their heat and taste, rewarming such food in microwave.
We had ordered for 
1. Murtabak (Chicken) - Its more like stuffed chicken keema in paratha or basically Chicken Paratha (Indian way to understand).

2. Burnt Chicken Garlic Spring Onion Rice - It was really spicy and not preferred for children and old people and also those who don't enjoy spicy food, coz my folks didn't enjoy it, but I did.

3. Mixed Cantonese Noodles (Gravy) - The best of all dishes, healthy and filling. On the bland side.

4. Crab meat in Chilli Oyster Sauce - Had this dish for the 1st time in my life and really enjoyed it, so did my other folks. 

5. Roast lamb in Devil's Sauce - The one that was a misfit to my entire order, the meat was hard and had difficulty chewing, and then it was extremely spicy. This was the dish which everyone rejected coz of the spicyness and the hard rubbery lamb meat.

Overall an average experience. The reason i don't rate it higher coz while ordering i had mentioned the dishes should not be spicy and yet we were suggested spicy dishes by them and ended up having unhappy folks due to the spicy dishes.
Thanks to Nom Nom to give us an discount, the courtesy well appreciated.

Inside nalban, opposite cognizant. Ambience is great, with both indoor and outdoor sitting available. Newly opened hence no taxes. Themed chinese mostly but with great play of colors and chequers.
One side high rise sector v other side vastness of water of the fisheries.
Food availble is neat and supporting their thainese theme, eclectic mix of thai and chinese. Mocktails and soft drinks are also availble.
Ordered dimsum platter nonveg, had 3 chicken, 3 prawn and 2 fish dimsums in different shapes, sipped it along with kiwi margarita and sunrise frenzy mocktails. Dimsums were well stuffed served with a chutney. Mocktails were good without ice.
For main course there was nai moreng aka a noodles of the chicken variety and crab in chilli oyster sauce. Quantity was a lot. Noodles were served with egg and chicken satay and had egg too. The crab meat was made into balls and curried, which slightly marred the taste and it was a little salty.
Its a great choice for pocket friendly filling eat. Kudos!

You should absolutely visit this place if you want mouth watering delicacies.
It is not actually very near to Cognizant.
The place is small and compact with an outer sitting arrangement.
The ambience is really good.
Coming to the food we had
Hot and sour soup which was good.
Randang fish in banana leaf- This is actually a treat to the taste buds. Served with a fish wanton and salad. Highly recommended dish.
Nasi Goreng rice- this is a medium spicy rice with a burnt grilled taste served with a poached egg and two chicken satay.
Chicken in black pepper sauce- which was extremely delicious containing 10 pieces.
And two fresh lime sodas.
The prices are also quite affordable.
Had a great experience. Highly recommended.

Had lunch with few of my colleagues. I liked the ambience, the staff's behaviour and the decor. Nice place to hangout. Liked the food. #NasiGoreng, #ThaiThighChicken,#BirdeyeChilichicken & #Mandarinfish was delicious. However, I didn't like much the noodles. I think they can develop the taste and quality of the noodles. Must try the starter #ThaiThighChicken. You can also enjoy the view of the open green space and the water body of nalban. Overall nice eatery. I truly believe that they have more potential to be one of the good Chinese eating place. My personal suggestion is that it would be great if they can introduce pork to their menu. Since, in Kolkata very few places serve good pork. Looking to visit again.

The newest Thai and Chinese restaurant in Sector 5. Nom Nom is highly inspired by the food culture in Thailand. The place ¬†beautiful. Located right beside the Nalban lake, they have an outdoor seating area. With thatched structures, it gives you a very sea side feel. The interior seating area is very simple in decor. A place where the food speaks than the decor.¬†
The place is run by the brother-sister Shaw duo. List of what we were served -

1. Murtabak Chicken: It is an Indo-Malaysian dish, inspired by our very own Mughlai Paratha. The inside was stuffed with minced chicken, and the outside is crisp. Oil quotient is a bit of concern, but the management said, they completely dry off the excess oil before serving their customers. This was served with a peanut sauce, and dried chilli chutney.

2. Randang Fish: A good quality Basa steamed inside a banana leaf, filled with Vietnamese spices. The best of the lot. The fish was marinated well, and extremely soft. Beautifully steamed fish - Recommended.

3. Thai Thigh Chicken: Boneless pieces of chicken cooked in spices and tossed in coconut. The dish was nicely spiced, and was paired well with the noodles, and the rice. The coconut was not overpowering, and is a must try! It is not watery, can be termed as semi dry.

4. Crab Meat in Chilli Oyster Sauce: Minced crab meat (no smell at all) cooked in oyster sauce, mixed with spices. A spicy dish but worth the spiciness!¬†

5. Burnt Chilli Garlic Noodles Mixed: The noodles were good. They were well cooked, and topped with enough prawns and chicken. no complaints there! The chilliness could have been more given the name. Their quantity is more than what two big eaters could manage.

6. Aitim Tod Fried Ice Cream: Very few places serve fried ice cream in Kolkata, this could be the next place to go to. The layering is thin, and crisp. The ice cream inside is frozen, and is topped with chocolate sauce. We had expected a warmer version of it, but were surprised by the frozen version of this.

The latest Thainese joint is recommended for various reasons:

1. They let out the restaurant for private parties and corporate meets
2. No limit on guest counts - they could be arranging a buffet for a minimum of 15 people too
3. They serve single portions for those not coming in a group
4. No worries on getting the extra food packed, or ordering too much
5. The ambiance is their USP; located right beside the lake - it's a beautiful sight for a rainy day6. They accept cards and cash
7. You can park your car in the parking next door, they have a restaurant entrance from the parking side as well

Cons:
1. The road infront of the restaurant is one way

Enough positive reasons for you to go and try these guys out! :)

A Thai Delight! 

We were craving for some Thai food and thought of giving NomNom a try. Well the food was just super, and while we got it home delivered, I must mention that with their neat packaging and extra cellophane wrapping on the boxes, the food was just as fresh as it would have tasted at their restaurant. 

We ordered these
1. Satay Ayam - Chicken satay with peanut sauce. I have not tasted a better version of this sauce. It was mind blowing! We loved it and this was the star dish of the evening. Must Must try! 

2. Kaffir Chicken - The kaffir lime added to much aroma and freshness to the dish. A complete winner, specially in these summer months! 

3. Wok tossed Pepper Fish - This was a good dish too, the fish pieces were big and the best part was they weren't coated heavily with corn flour. 

In mains
4. Cantonese gravy noodles - I have tasted Cantonese Gravy noodles at a lot of places, and this was was by far one of the best! The quantity is quite good too, one dish would easily fill 3 people. 

5. Chicken in Chilli Oyster sauce - Big pieces of chicken and the gravy had a very nice flavour - spicy with a sibtle hint of sweet. 

6. Kaeng Keow Wahn Gai/ Thai green curry chicken - It comes with plain rice, so no need to order extra fried rice with this one. The curry tasted very nice and chicken pieces were well sized too. Thai green curry is supposed to have fish sauce, but I think this one had a bit more of it, which overwhelmed the dish and the sweet refreshing smell of kaffir lime leaves was lost in it. 

Overall wonderful food. Thanks a lot, all our friends at the party loved it, specially the Chicken Satay. Clear winner!

In two simple words NOM NOM is a '' MUST VISIT'', the place is an absolutely  charmer.. With its beautiful lake view and cozy but peaceful ambience. To get straight to it the primary reason why you should visit NOM NOM is for its food! Excellent quality of food is served with every bite exploding with flavours.. And trust me guys this is in complete honesty as I am not paid to write this review..! If ur a fan of Thai food then u must visit and still visit even if ur not into thai.. The menu is a combination of many things fused together and the flavours blend in beautifully.. The cooks do a great job at presentation and use of spices in the right quantity.. Nothing seems to be over powered. I tried a 4 course meal and trust me guys everything was simply perfect.. Plz try the rangdang fish wrapped in banana leaf, the fried ice cream, the chicken with red curry sauce they are all amazing.. Rice and noodles every item was justified in our platter.. It also acts a getaway from the hustle and bustle with its remote location even being at the heart of the corporate hub of Kolkata.. Just a few mins walk from RDB boulevard.. Beside the lake rests this restaurant. Do try it.. Thats all i can say!

A great place to be!
Great food.
Beautiful location.
Warm and efficient management!

It is located conveniently in the IT district of the city along the beautiful waters of Nalban near SDF.
We had ordered Lung Fung soup,Tom Yum soup,Drunken Fried Chicken,Assorted Non-Veg Dimsums platter,Bali Prawns,Fire Cracker Prawns,Mie Goreng,Special Noodles,Thai Green Curry and Thai Red Curry and finished it off on a sweet note with Fried Ice cream and Darsan with Ice cream and (Choco Fantasy : as an alternative to Sizzling Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream)
Honestly,there are actually no complaints with this place. Absolutely brilliant,but there's always a scope for improvement.

This place is one of the hidden gems of Sector 5, best part is the view and the really good food. This place is right opposite the lake and its very windy and refreshing   its almost like a place away from the city but at the same time being at the middle of Sector 5. Keep up the good job team Nom Nom

Loved this place, Food is out of the world, best part is the open seating place opposite the Lake, you should go to this place after your office and sit in the open and unwind and indulge in some really tasty food. I am surely recommending this place to my friends

Visited this place which has newly opened just opposite to Tangerine Banquet of Sec 5 . The restaurant has two options of sitting one outside with a great view of the Nalban Lake and other inside. We opted to sit inside. The restaurant has a nice ambience. They serve Thainese food a mix of Chinese and Thai. We order Momo platter, lung fung soup , chicken in barbeque sizzler , egg  burnt garlic fried rice , chili garlic noodle and chicken in oyester sauce.
Was a bit disappointed with the momo as it was dry and a bit hard. Chilly garlic noodle was a bit soggy . But rest dishes was very good . The service was also good .
