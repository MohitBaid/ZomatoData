I'm sorry, but tried this twice. The food is just not good, the quantity of noodles was very good but the taster bland. And the wings wasn't tasting fresh.
 Sorry to the owners, hoping to try the food again to give another chance.

ordered chicken drum stick during Durga puja (Sasthi 2017).Found the overall preparation was ok. The chicken drum stick balls can be prepared in much better way to improve the food quality. Swiggy delivered the food as expected. Hats off to Swiggy for it marvelous delivery system

I've ordered from these guys twice & they are *seriously* inconsistent. The 1st order (Veg Manchow Soup) was pretty good. The 2nd one (Veg sweet corn soup) was inedible - sickly sweet thick gloop with a handful of corn kernels tossed in. So I'm not sure which of the 2 days is the exception. 
No thanks Prity, I'll find another kitchen.

It was quiet late around 9.45pm, 
We found this place open for delivery so we called up. 

Orders: 
3x Chicken Fried Rice
12pcs Chilli Chicken

Chicken F.Rice(8/10): Quiet good at taste with generous amount of chicken and veggies. The quantity of rice is enough for 2. Well cooked and delicious! 

Chilli Chicken(5/10): The pieces were good, gravy was also delicious, chicken was well cooked. But, for 12 pieces they sent us gravy for only 6 pieces. Yes, the chicken pieces were way above the gravy level in the container! Not at all happy with the quantity of the gravy. It was on the sweeter side

Delivery and Packing(7/10): Crushed rice boxes(2 of them bent). Plastic container for Side dish. Ordered at 9.45pm. Delivery at 10.35 pm so that's good.
