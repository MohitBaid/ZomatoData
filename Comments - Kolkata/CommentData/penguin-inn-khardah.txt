Ordered through Zomato for the second time (because am out of options) and for the second time they are late!
Worst delivery system! On call the person who picks up says that he doesn't deal with orders from zomato and is very unprofessional and rude!
Now for the food: ordered mutton biryani this time, and its pathetic! Last time the special starter was good,i would even call it tasty if it had been delivered on time and was hot!
Never ordering from here again

Excellent food, needed a little bit more cooking both 
for mixed fried rice and your special mutton.
Delivery was dot in time.
My first interaction with zomato and your khardah outlet made my new year Eve a very special one.
All the best to you all.

We had prawn do pyaza and mutton bhuna today. I remember my visits when the first holder of this restaurant managed everything well and we were happy to have a restaurant at Khardah. But when I had prawn do pyaza which I concluded prawn tempura dipped in do pyaza gravy and small cubes of mutton boiled and dipped in some kind of gravy mixed with tomato sauce, I am actually thinking do we really have restaurants/a restaurant that will kick our taste buds.

Don't order from Penguin Restaurant unless you're completely out of options and you cannot survive few more minutes to reach another decent restaurant!!

We ordered Mutton Biryani and Chicken Tikka Kebab.
Kebabs were too small in size to complement the 8 pieces serving. Taste wise kebabs were below average (even the road side jhoops in front of my office prepare better kebabs).

Coming to Biryani, it was the worst Biryani I've had still now. Only kauwa biryani from the movie Run would taste worse than this.

So again warning you. If you're thinking to order from Pebguin please give it a 2nd 3rd 4th...Nth no of thought and don't order.

Talking about taste, the quality is very average. Most of the chinese dishes, whether it is rice or noodles.. Tastes almost same. Even it is deteriorating over time.most of the time i order food home. But my experience is quite different when i have the same food sitting in the restaurant itself. Qualitywise it is way better than the food they deliver. Since this is the closest restaurant in khardah from my place and I often order food from here, so this is my humble request to the management to take good care of the dishes you are serving and also delivering.

A multi cusine restro located in Khardah B.T.Road,so quite easy to loacate.Had visited & ordered via Zomato so my review is based on both.Starting from the Ambiance which was okay nothing to describe about.Moving towards the food had taken Chicken Hot & Sour soup which was tasty,in the starter Chicken Pakora which was also good to taste perfectly fried with soft chicken inside,after that had Mixed Noodles which was again above average & lastly a cold drink.Quantity & Quality both were good.Staff behaviour was okayish.Service was also okay.This review fetches 3.5.                                                                                                                                                      Next time ordered via Zomato: Mixed fried rice,Chilli Chicken & Chicken manchurian,to my utter surprise both the gravy items were identical & were most poor in taste & the rice was over tossed thereby loosing its taste & hardly found any prawn in it.Service was quite prompt.Quantity was okay but quality wasn't.So by summing up both the reviews my conclusion/suggestion is a restro which needs a lot of improvement & not sure whether i would visit again!!!

The kebabs and cream of chicken soup is worth a try. The garlic sauce they provide with the kebabs is so yummy you will end up asking for atleast two sachets . The salad is also good. 

Overall the restaurant is nice, waiters are good and well behaved.

But they kinda suck at home delivery if there are too many orders. They don't have delivery guys. Once I ordered food at 9pm received it after 11pm. 

Anyway still it's near my house, and convenient enough, so well 3 stars for it.

One of the good restaurants in Sodepur area. I am fond of their Hundi Biriyani. But recently I saw that the prices are a bit high and the quantity has become less as compared to their competitors. I think this matter needs to be taken up by the management team of Penguine Inn.

The food is average. When you don't wanna have homemade food this can be a place to go to as it's cheap and won't disappoint you with its service. The taste of the food is indirectly proportional to the number of people at a given point of time. If you live in khardah and don't like cooking on sundays, just come here.

I use to visit this restaurant very often but today I got bitter experience which I ever had. First of all they are charging cost of mineral water more than it's MRP which they can not be as per New Govt Circular. I have raised this concern earlier as a result today they billed us with VAT which they normally do not do. Though in front of me they are issuing kaccha bill for others which is very frustrating. They have two kind of bills one is kaccha bill another is VAT bill. In kaccha bill they do not charge VAT but if you want to pay through card they will give you VAT bill because obviously it will come in their Bank which they can not hide. Overall food quality & behavior of staffs per todays experience is very bad. I will not visit this place again.

Food : not at all special.. you can definitely opt for road side stalls if you dont have any problem.. skip the chowmein.. they just boil and serve
Seating arrangements: not comfy
 If you hav no options left..you can try this..but please stick to the soups only.

Every time we go there for family dinner we taste crispy chicken in honey-I am definitely not going to forget the taste ever in my life. We ordered mixed fried rice, lemon chicken and prawn in garlic sauce for the main course. The food was served on time. The hospitality we received is good but not outstanding. The food costs nominal but I think they should be more careful about the interiors. It has become monotonous. Time for a makeover!

This restaurant located just by the side of B.T.Road in khardaha station road connector. We two friends went there for dinner. We took Thai soup Mixed and Veg. We also ordered Thai fried rice,a mushroom dish. Soups  and foods were OK,though not bad,not very good. We also ordered two Mock tail, which they completely forgot to serve, although the staff behaviour was cordial. You can hang out there when you don't have an option.

I'm very upset with the service provided.
The air conditions are not working properly. Food coming very late. Have to sit there for ages. The food is very good no problem. Staff compared to the restaurants is very low. Little renovation needed. It remains empty most of the time with 1 or 2 people sitting and waiting for their food to be served.

I have visited here many times, probably becuase of the fact that Khardah does not have a standard restaurant. Penguin Inn is the only good place, that's just above average in today's terms but on its earlier days it was quite good. As of now it has good ambience for family dine out, staffs are good, serve fast. Food quality is standard like Barrackpore's Penguin Food Bazar. Price wise okay in quality, quantity and portions.

We went there on 2nd Jan, 2016 with another couple. We ordered there chicken tikka and reshmi cabab, chicken fried rice and chicken Manchurian & ice-cream. The quality of food was quite good, if you want to check out some nearby place for hanging out then this is a good choice.

At a stone'd throw distance from where i live

Unparalleled biriyani till date as its as light as anything without oil

Staff is cordial yet the service is slow

And they at times lack in consistency in the quality they serve and their behaviour at times matches to the unpredictable calcutta weather

Nevertheless in a friendly pocket pinch, its definitely worth it

Penguin Inn is a vintage for all those foor loving people looking for a quick, well served lunch or dinner. The service here is fantastic, with quite a lot of variety in food. The interior is very simple yet very attractive as a place for  a perfect afternoon lunch or a late night dinner with family or friends.

Simple decor. 
Courteous staff.
Average service.
Decent portions.
Nothing extraordinary taste-wise, but good.

I've been to this place many times, and that's probably because it doesn't have much competition in this locality.

It is located in B.T road,beside khardah municipality.
It is a pocket friendly restaurant.I have been here with groups.
Generally the food served is hot & fresh.There chinese dishes are better than Indian.
P.s:must try the tandoori chicken.

Not a good restaurant by any standard. The ambiance is not so good. The staff are not well trained about taking on call orders. 

The only good thing about this restaurant is the price. Which is cheap. 

The chicken kolhapuri is a waste of your money. The dish is anything but kolhapuri.

Well we band of foodie brothers went for bachelor party dine out. Though Sodpur do not offer enough options for restaurant we went to this for with minimum expectation.
The restaurant is spacious with minimum decor.
Coming to the food. We ordered Chinese. Chicken drum stick
Chilli chicken, chicken Hong Kong (very generic in name and taste) mixed fried rice, and mixed chow. 
The drum sticks were spicy moderately tasty but lacked chicken :-) . The mixed noodles was good enough but the noodles were over boiled. Fried rice was a complete flop. Chicken Manchurian was ok. Chicken Hong Kong was best in all. 
If you in a need for restaurant food and curving for Chinese TRY to skip.This place gave me and my brother stomach problem. But for people near sodpur and khardah wait for other options to crop up.

Its the only good restaurant located in Khardaha/Rahara.

Edit on 26 June 2017
খড়দহ তে এই মুহূর্তে সবচেয়ে বাজে রেস্টুরেন্ট এটা। কিছু দিন আগে আমি বাড়ির জন্য mutton বিরিয়ানি নিয়েছিলাম। বাড়ি গিয়ে দেখি ৩ পিস ছোট ছোট মাংসের টুকরো যার গায়ে ঝোল লেগে আছে। পরিষ্কার বোঝা গেল মাংসের ঝোল থেকে মাংস দিয়ে উপরে ভাত দিয়ে বিরিয়ানি বলে বিক্রি করছে, অথবা ইচ্ছে করে বিরিয়ানির মাংস না দিয়ে বাসী মাংসের ঝোল দিয়ে দিয়েছে। আর এটা ১ দিন না, ২ দিন হল আমার সাথে। আমি আর এখানে যাবো না।

I went there almost 1 year ago with my friends. And I quite liked that place. It is big, have well seating arrangement and the behaviour of the waiters is very good. At first we ordered Chicken Tandoori, then Chicken Biryani and Chicken Kolapuri. I must say the foods are very tasty. I became fan of their Chicken Tandoori. The quantity of Biryani is very good. Its more than enough for a fully grown up person. Chicken Kolapuri is real spicy dish and I love it. Overall my experience is great.

The Description: I went to this place long ago... Just crossing the Sodepur Mina Bus Stoppage.

The Ambience: At that tym is was fully wooden chair and table.. Empty but quite big place to seat.

The Food: We ordered panir pasinda and Butter nan and it was really very good. The panir was soft and the gravy was tasty enuf to eat lots of nan and rotis.

The Conclusion: Didn't had a next chance to be there as its far from my residence. Hope to visit to see the new penguin.                                         

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.
