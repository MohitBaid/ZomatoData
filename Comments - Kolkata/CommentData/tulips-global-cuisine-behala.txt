Small but organised but also not cozy. Grilled chicken sandwich, buffalo style chicken wings, crispy chilli baby corn are good. But hakka noddles are not good.

Rating this just because they have decreased the quality like anything .
Used to be one of my favorites but now this was the last day I have checkd in there  
Provides you with such high priced food and the thing is u get to know after the billing .
This wasnt even expected .
Menu card shows somthing and u need to pay 20 or 30 more .

The ambience is quite good. It has more of a cafe feeling. The food is good as well but then yes it could have been better. Just had chicken bharta and mixed fried rice from here and krusher's as well. But it's understandable because taste and preference is a individualistic term.

The restaurant,which actually has more of a small café feel,is very easy to get to.It's right on the street,from janakalyan leading to James long,just on the left side.

Food: 3.7/5
We ordered sabo-sabo,Mac n cheese (with chicken), teriyaki sausage, icecream soda
The sabo sabo is excellent,a little sweet,it's served in a "steamboat",with 2crispy skinned fried momo.If they have a small appetite,it's enough to fill two people's tummy on an evening.4.5/5
Teriyaki sausage was okay,not as smokey as I like my sausages and it was served with something crispy,carb-like which smelt a little burnt.3/5
Mac n cheese didn't have enough cheese but it was quite tasty too.The white sauce had flavour.
3.5/5

We took a lot of time to eat and they didn't make us hurry like most other restaurants in behala,and the
Icecream soda tasted gooood! Refreshingly different and helped us settle the debate between whether we should order soda or icecream.

Service: 5/5
food came in real quick,even before we had finished the starters,the main was ready.The order was taken by one person,most probably the chef/owner,and the food was served out in table by another.Both were extremely cordial.

Ambience: 3.7/5
Quite simple decor,lit by bluish and golden lights,not dingy like the reviews suggest.The space is small for a really large group of friends but enough for the normal sized ones.It's a really great place for regular hangout.

Portions: 5/5
Each one was enough for two people,if not a lot.

Special mention: the menu is quirky,with a lot of different items from a lot of countries,each of which I plan to try out atleast once!
The owner who took our order gave us an idea about the portions,else we would have ordered too much! Normally you won't see restaurants helping you order less!
Oh and they serve biryani as a puja special.That was cute,but we stuck to the menu.

Revisit: most definitely.😊

You get an amazing collection of food on the menu. Food from all over the world. But it's disappointing that they are few in number and can't tackle with the situation when there are more than 12-16 people. What you should really try out once here are 'buffalo wings' and 'chizzza'. The price of the food are somewhat decent.

Nicest discovery in behala so far. In a garage sized room, it is a home to some of the finest cuisines from around 15-20 countries across continents. Less of a restaurant it has an indoor cafe feel. We ordered a Vietnamese chicken Cauh chua soup, American buffalo style chicken wings and hot chocolate. Taste and quantity is worthy of its price but found the hot chocolate to be little pricey. Anyway, there is lot to discover within the place itself now... Can't wait to introduce all my friends one by one to this fairly revisit-able food oasis located between behala chowrasta and shakherbajar.

Behala is making a mark in terms of good eateries. This newbie is also following the trend. The major plus is the variety of food they are serving. Right from Chinese to continental. Only the downside would be the location.

The chicken coconut soup with cilantro and buffalo style chicken wings are a big hit for me. However, I tasted fish cake which i didn't find upto the mark. Looking forward to more visits good luck

I dealt with this restaurant only once, but my experience had been rough with this place.
I made online order of schezwan chicken and veg fried rice, both 3 plates. The restaurant called me for confirmation of order. 

My review:
Delivery was great

Food quality was great.

Wrong food was delivered. I was delivered 3 plates of veg fried rice and 3 plates of schezwan fried rice. Wheras I ordered 3 plates each of veg fried rice and schezwan chicken. I called up the restaurant for this issue, and I did not get good response. So had to reach out to zomato for help.

Service of zomato for the above reported issue WAS INCREDIBLE.

Just avoid this place. If anybody is starving thn better to visit a road side eatery then visiting this place. Visited this place two times. There is just a two Man army. One the owner cum chef other his brother. First day orderd mocktail and desert .both r decent but not chilled at all. For parcel ordered veg manuchrian and fried rice. Though okay but the rice is bit less quantity. Second day experience just horrible. Orderd desert which ws oky. Take away items are gravy noodles and veg Manchurian. The gravy chowmein lacks the punch in taste and quantity also not decent. Worse was the veg Manchurian. A vry sour taste I felt after having it. It was lik having a sour fruit. I wonder how a chef like MR. Das serve such dishes to guest. Equal unprofessional is his brother 'S behavior. He just handed me a Chang of 10 rupees note when I ask him to change it He showed a frowning face and extreme displeasure. Furthermore he was giving three items in containers in just 1 thin plastic. Whn asked for another He showed me the same displeasure. Poor quality food with unprofessionalism at its best. Better avoid this place at any cost and if one wishes to get quality food visit 18 James Long nearby.

This restaurant is a hidden treasure. We are bowled over by the culinary skill of chef and owner Mr. Debasish Das. His hospitality is to be added here. This place serves global cuisine. We ordered chicken manduguk soup (a Korean preparation) and buffalo style chicken wings (An American preparation. Both tasted awesome. More specifically, the chicken wing dish is to die for. We were also served an ice-cream based dessert with an eye-catching presentation by Mr. Das. We will definitely this place again and again.

This place is located at Janakalyan, just a few steps from the Diamond Harbour Road crossing, on Janakalyan Road. I went there during the Durga Puja, on ashtami. The place is small, cozy and the staffs are really nice. I brought a parcel of Chicken-Egg Noodles(gravy). Interestingly they do not have the option of prawns, also they seemed to be the only or at least one of the very few restaurants who serve gravy Noodles during the Puja time.
Now coming to the food the Noodles was great and not too oily, the taste was good with ample portions of chicken and egg, the quantity was also good and the price was also moderate at around 130 bucks.
Overall a very satisfying experience and am looking forward to visiting them again.

-------- Review number 100 ----------

And for my 100th review i was in dire search of a hidden gem which is very close to my place and after a lot of searching i came across one . Since, it is a tiny auspicious occasion for me to celebrate this achievement i would like to make this review a "note of advice " for every foodies out there to come forward and support the hidden gems which are still located at many corners of the city but still yet to be properly acknowledged .

Tulip's is a tiny place with minimal ambience but a lot of heart is put into the food that is served here . And with the tag of global cuisine stamped onto the name itself , this tiny hidden gem boasts a big chest of dishes in the menu . But , my question before coming here was that will they succeed or this is just another failed attempt at trying to grab the foodie craze that has swallowed the city . Then came the chef cum owner Mr Debasish Das and just made my evening a worthwhile experience .

° Location :- People living in behala will be familiar with the stoppage Janakalyan bus stand . Those who are not , will just have to reach behala chowrasta and walk towards sakherbajar . Ask anyone about janakalyan and reach there . After you reach the janakalyan alley then enter it and walk towards James long . After some steps , tulips will be located at your left.

° Ambience & Service ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- No it does not boast a fine dining ambience but know what, it does the job . That's what hidden gems are like right . Minimal ambience but great food . Service is prompt as very surprisingly it doesn't get that many customers . So, serving time is a max of 10 mintues .

----------------------------

FOOD :- Let's go straight away to the part where they truly excel and yes it is the food . The reason why every dish is carefully crafted properly with the right amount of spices and cooked just perfectly . After having a starters we were already sure that we were in for a treat and that's what we got . We had the following items and i will highly recommend each one of them :- 

1. Chicken cheeza ( 4 / 5 ) :- Their signature starter . Yes it doesn't sound that interesting but trust me taste wise it clicks . 6 pieces of tender chicken strips deep fried and topped with cheese and salsa . Each bite will hit you like a ton of flavor and the soft chicken will render a satisfying feel to your appetite.  This is the kind of starter everyone dreams of and a rare and perfect combo of cheese and chicken is every foodies dream . So , just go for it and a good time  .

2. SABO SABO Mongolian Steam boat ( 4 / 5 ) :- Wow, who knew that we had such a dish in behala . This is very similar to the legendary chimney soup . Or should I say exactly the chimney soup , that doesn't matter . What matters is how it is and how it tastes . Firstly it is recommended for pork lovers . The dish comprises of fish , chicken and pork pieces slower cooked and boiled in a thick delightful gravy which also had spinach and noodles . All these is served on a steam boat . The taste of the soup or gravy is simply out of this world . The pork pieces had a lot if fat so those who have issues can stay away but those who truly love it can have a hell of a time . The dish is sufficient for 2 and very much recommended .

3. Chicken pasta arrabiata ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- After having 2 stunning dishes we were a little apprehensive about this one but damn. This was the best of the lot . Actually after having 2 completely different type of dishes we went for something not that uncommon and the chef nailed it . I still remember the spicy tomato sauce the overpowered the penne pasta . Priced at 250 the quantity of the dish is humongous . We had a superb time and had a great pasta after months . Highly recommended .

---------------------------------

Verdict :- A restaurant worthy of having its name placed in the hidden gems section and if its truly happens then i will be happy as it will be from behala the part of the city from where i come from . The main point that makes this joint a stand out is :- 

1. The quality of food, which is excellent and tax free.

So, a big shout of to the foodies to come here and have a try . You guys have given a chance to so many joints then why don't u try here . This place a variety of items other than your day to day ones . It also has pork fajitas , who knew we had fajitas in behala. Will be surely back to try the other items but till them requesting the kind and experienced chef to continue the good work.  People will come , good food always has customers . 

And with the end of my 100th review i encourage my fellow reviewers to write more reviews and make them informative enough for the readers to properly judge and estimate the right food that can be ordered . Please , tag the photos with the name of the dishes so that the readers can have a clear idea as to what exactly the dish is all about . One bad experience doesn't encompass the stature of a restaurant . Be a proper judge and always support good food . 

The motto of a petuk bangali is keep munching but stay healthy . So, keep eating and take care of yourselves :) :) :)

Little cozy eatery located on the ground floor of Oxford View between the James Long and the JanaKalyan Bus Stop behala. The owner - Debashish recommended to try out the starter - Chicken Cheezza which sounds bit common,  but to my surprise the taste is so so unique with soft tender chicken breast deep fried and topped with salsa and cheese slices - my palette never experienced this taste before. Will advise every foodie in Behala to try out the same. For parcel i ordered Barbeque chicken wings (juicy and tender with perfect blend of barbecue sauce) , polao and mutton roganjosh are the items must to try out. Will visit this place again..... Service is good

Stumbled on this place while looking for new restaurants along James Long. A cozy place with beautiful ambience. Mr. Das was very friendly and helped us decide our orders. We ordered chicken cheesezaa and chilli pork with a side of rice. The cheesezaa was delicious and the pork was melt-in-the-mouth. Quick service and reasonable prices.

Went there for the first time with my friend. It is located at Behala Janakalyan. The interior is tastefully decorated but a bit of music would have added more charm to this place. Now coming to the food, the owner cum chef Mr. Debashish Das was extremely humble and made our choices easy. We ordered for hakka egg chicken noodle, chicken burger with french fries, fish fries and fresh lime soda . The dishes are reasonably priced and wont go heavy on your pocket.

It was really good and tasted even better than it looked. The owner was extremely friendly and gave us great suggestions. We also tried Chilli Pork with Fried Rice and it was delicious. The menu is amazing and everything seems so tasty there. Also the menu is actually larger than provided on Zomato. Looking forward to visiting again. Soon.. Very soon... :)

So today I ordered chocolate shake, chicken popcorn and coconut chicken soup. The whole thing cost me 250/- and it came in huge quantities. The chicken popcorns were more like chicken balls and was filled with chicken. The chocolate shake was pretty nice and the soup was creamy and delicious. The packaging was quite commendable and the delivery was prompt. There isn't much to complaint about, just that the chicken popcorn wasn't chicken popcorn!

Small and cozy place with a nice ambiance. It serves different and uncommon food items which is not found in general Restaurants. The food menu does justice to the name "Global Cusine". Chicken Cheeza is my favourite item. The owner is very friendly and suggests food as per your likings. He helps to prepare the food so there is a personal touch to all the food items.

Tulip's Global Cuisine is another restaurant in Behala which has come up in last two years. It is one of those places which is not that same stereotype kinda place which serves Chowmein-Chilly Chicken. One thing which I really liked about the place is their newly launched menu, which is quite attractive. Not only you get a wide variety of cuisine to choose but you all get the knowledge of its inception and where it belongs to.
I went to this place in an evening and went on to order these things:

#Green Heaven: Its a mocktail basically with "aam panna" flavour. The drink was just satisfactory and nothing exceptional. It lacked in presentation too. It was more of a synthetic drink which is not worth its price.

#Chizza : Yeah, the name is quite popular with KFC but here it is different. Chicken strips fried, with cheese and coriander on top. Somehow, I felt that the coriander didn't quite go well with the overall dish.

#Buffalo Styled Chicken Wings: This was quite nice. I really liked the preparation. The chicken was crunchy outside while soft and juicy inside. Kudos to this dish.

#Banana-Strawberry Pan Cake : It attracted me as soon as it came to me. Lovely it was. Everything was inch perfect. It was soft and had the right proportion of sweetness to make you love it more and more.

Location:
Well, you have to be lil focused to locate this place. You get this place as you come from D.H Road to Janakalyan. Better to check your zomato map.

Ambience:
Well, nothing to talk about it. A small place  with few chairs and tables in it. The place is neat and clean. You can find the different coloured feedback notes on the door which makes it colourful.

PROS:
** Wide Range of Cuisine
** New and different in the locality
** Nominal Price

CONS:
** Locality
** Ambience

Overall a nice place to visit as this place serves you with some interesting cuisine. The owner/chef Mr. Debashish is a lovely person to talk to. You can definitely give this place a try.

I went there for the first time with the hope of trying something different, and I got my wish! We tried the chicken cheeszza (not sure abt the spelling!). It was really good and tasted even better than it looked. The owner was extremely friendly and gave us great suggestions. We also tried Chilli Pork with Fried Rice and it was delicious. The menu is amazing and everything seems so tasty there. Also the menu is actually larger than provided on Zomato. Looking forward to visiting again. Soon.. Very soon... :)

So today I ordered chocolate shake, chicken popcorn and coconut chicken soup. The whole thing cost me 250/- and it came in huge quantities. The chicken popcorns were more like chicken balls and was filled with chicken. The chocolate shake was pretty nice and the soup was creamy and delicious. The packaging was quite commendable and the delivery was prompt. There isn't much to complaint about, just that the chicken popcorn wasn't chicken popcorn!

Small and cozy place with a nice ambiance. It serves different and uncommon food items which is not found in general Restaurants. The food menu does justice to the name "Global Cusine". Chicken Cheeza is my favourite item. The owner is very friendly and suggests food as per your likings. He helps to prepare the food so there is a personal touch to all the food items.

Yesterday was my second visit to this place. The first visit was long back. Its in my locality and is operated by the owner cum chef Debasish Das. A wonderful man and knows what he is exactly serving. Nothing much to talk about the interiors as there can be a bit more that can be done to it. Coming to food I am now a fan of the Sandwiches they serve. Its always Grilled to perfection and is stuffed with good meyo and chicken and veggies. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Sandwich and on Debasish's recommendation a new preparation called Chicken Cheezza which is yet to be put up in the new menu card, which is on its way as he informed. Food was good. The Cheeza was something very unique and soft and tender. A good place with great opportunities I must say.

Tulips comes in the list of my " favorite restaurants " and i have to say it ranks quite high. The food , the ambiance , the warm and courteous nature of the people employed there  , everything is just perfect . I am quite a regular visitor of there food joint and i have to admit that every time i hear that little bell on their door tingling , notifying me that my food is arriving  , my taste buds go ga-ga !! Every preparation is prepared with such precision that its commendable . One of my personal  favorite is the " PRAWN TEMPURA " . It comes along with a mayo dip and the crunchy outside and juicy inside texture of that dish , blows me away every single time . I would recommend everybody to try this dish , once at least and i am sure it wont disappoint you  .
My words wont be enough to describe " DEBASISH UNCLE " , the owner of that place , as he is like family to me and treats me like his son . He is a wonderful person , with the most intricate knowledge about every preparation he offers at his place and his behavior is so warm that it would impress any customer of theirs . I would request every body to go visit this wonderful , cozy food joint , fall in love with their food and keep visiting in future !!

Tulip's Global cuisine is a nice restaurant situated in a passageway near Janakalyan, Behala. The restaurant has a dimly lit bluish atmosphere and personally i liked it.. We ordered a manchurian noodles and a belgian frost waffle. The noodles was okay but the waffle was brilliant. Quite the one that tickles your taste buds! The staff is quite friendly. Would visit again and recommended it surely to others.

Same here as somebody who reviewed this wanted to give this 0 stars but could not. Me and couple of my friends landed up there and ordered 2 hakka noodles which were similar to that you could possibly find in a rodeside stall. The quantity was very poor and so was the quality. We had also ordered spaghetti with meat balls , the quantity of which was so low that i finished it in exactly 2 mins. And above that they charged 200 bucks for that. Along with that the side dish for hakka noodles was honey garlic chicken where we did not  find any taste of honey. Its our request please avoid this place as you will get better places to go to nearby in the same locality.

I wish I could give a rating 0 to this place.
My online ordering experience had been pretty smooth till I had the ill mind of ordering my lunch from here.
I had ordered Fish Fingers, Egg Fried Rice, Chilli Paneer and Frosted Waffles from this place.
Okay.
1. I placed the order at 11.30 and they made me cancel Caramel Custard and promised to get the food delivered by 1 p.m.
When did they arrive? Around 2.15 p.m.
2. I had repeatedly asked the person concerned NOT to put any kind of chicken and that it was supposed to be an Egg Fried Rice. But what arrived was a rather shabbily packed Chicken and Egg Fried Rice.

What kind of an unprofessional behaviour is this? At least they let me cancel the Chicken and Egg Fried Rice, and paid me back for that. But that doesn't really compensate for the fact that I was depending on them for my lunch, as was my grandmother.

Coming to the food, one was worse than the other. The Fish Fingers weren't crunchy enough, and the biscuit crumbs(or whatever they used) could be distinctly felt. The surface was not tightly bound together, and the fish inside tasted plain bad. The Chilli Paneer looked like bags of maida. The paneer was there alright, but the outer covering is enough to steer you of. I had to throw it away, it was THAT bad. And the waffles? Well, can they be even called so? They appeared as pieces of chewing gum, with only their shape resembling waffles. I wouldn't even start about the packaging, as it's very much evident from the pictures.

It was just sheer bad luck that I chose to order from this restaurant. I would ask nobody to visit here, unless you're starving. And even if you're starving, DO NOT order online.

A nice and cozy place. The chef himself came to take our order. We had a nice chat with him. He is a pass out from iihm Kolkata. He was a chef in cruise ships. We ordered chicken fried rice and chilli chicken (the name might be different) on his recommendation. The food was really tasty. Price is reasonable. Definitely will visit again.

Hello to You.

A quaint little place.  Easy on the pocket.  

 
                     Cosy ambience(i liked the chairs) if its empty, otherwise it becomes too crowdy and loud, with everyone chattering.

                                          You should try the Buffalo Style Chicken Wings, real tasty.
The spaghetti with meat-balls was sweet, though the chef-cum-owner assured me, the next time would be as it normally should be. 
I can not presume to think why he assumed in the first place that I would like my spaghetti sweet!!!
Not being too hard on he owner, The meat balls were real juicy.
The shahi-tukra was not nice.
                             Now, the quality of food is good, hygienic and all those c**p, but the quantity was very less. I understand the prices are low, so he has to cut costs, but the owner being a Chef must understand "one portion" should atleast serve one person, even if it means increasing the prices, albeit, a bit.

Biriyani is also made here on "some days", though not mentioned on the menu, which is quite NICE and light to the palette. 

Service is good too. Polite though a bit inattentive responses.

Definitely a tryable option.

Now this is what you call a restaurant. Excellent ambience, mouth watering delicious 😋 food, prompt service and most importantly excellent behaviour. The chief chef cum owner Mr Debashish is wonderful man and certainly have some magic in his hands. 

The restaurant is not so big, hardly a 24 seater, but its well decorated and obviously air conditioned. The quantity served is good, the pricing is better and the quality is best. Must try the Chicken Coconut Soup, Buffalo wings, Meat Balls and the Pan fried Momo. 

And yes after meals don't forget to taste the ice cream 🍨!!!

Happy Eating !!!!

This restro is situated in 1min walk way from Janakalyan, DH road to James Long Sarani. The place is good, well decorated. We ordered buffalo style chicken wings as a entree which was very good and chicken fried rice, chicken chow, chicken Manchurian, garlic chicken. All main course foods are medium except chicken fried rice. This rice is very bad. Wish a better food in our next visit.

When i visited there ....as it is near my place...i ordered chicken pasta arabiatta...crispy chili baby corn and chicken momo. The pasta was a bit spicy but needless to say was delicious. The red sauce added compliment to the dish. The baby corn was perfectly baked and very crispy. I ordered it to be less spicy. The sauce was served decorated in little heart shaped beside the dish was beyond perfection. The momo was very good but the soup was a bit oily. I always prefer my momo soup to be a bit clear and light. Over all it was a foodgasmic experience. Loved it...!!

Discovered this quaint little joint while arguing with a friend about"where to go for dinner". Favourable reviews and a location that's just at a stone's throw from my friend's home,we picked the joint mainly because a single reason. A call. We called the restaurant with a couple of questions, to all of which we received favourable answers. Several times. And then of course his food started speaking for him.


Location: The lane connecting James Long Sarani and Janakalyan more. The restro looks oddly uninviting from outside. Definitely need to do something about that!

Decor and ambience : A well lit 20 seater, this reeks of American restro flavours! A light arrangement is awesome, not too loud. Just very warm! Cane chairs with chequered cushions and walls with framed pictures! The glass door is awesome too! Intelligent designing technique by using small chits of paper placed criss cross containing customer reviews! Splendid!
The tables need to change! Not really in for plastic tables!

Hospitality and Menu design: We were warmly received by Mr Debasish Das, a global chef and the man behind this joint. He started chatting with us immediately. The guy who served us was also very polite. Glasses of water was served to us immediately. When requested for cold water, they had it brought in immediately. The menu is interesting given the fact that it enlisted the country of origin of the food. The menu card however is just about average! Expecting to see a better styled menu card next time.

Food: The food was phenomenal!! Started off with the Chef's suggestion of coconut chicken soup. I pretty much hate coconuts, but he assured me that this would be worth it! Indeed it was. Loved it.
The Buffalo chicken wings were awesome too. A bit too spicy for my taste though!
Main Course. My friend ordered veg rice and red chicken curry. One Chinese, the latter Thai. He tells me iit was amazing! I ordered a Spaghetti 🍝 and meatballs! Turns out, this Chef knows his Italian taste! The meatballs were juicy and are the best that I have ever tasted. We were also given some advice on food and I now know how to eat Spaghetti like a true blue Italian.
Next came dessert. Cassata with a variety of sweet sauce! Hell yeah!

Pricing : All this for ₹820! Enough said!
Mr. Debasis has promised me steaks next time along with a variety of other meats! He has plans for Barbecues in winter! Definitely going for those!

Pro: Everything
Con: Outside decor. Absence of variety of meat.

I was looking for new restaurants in Behala area…after searching through zomato i came to know about TGC…the reviews were quite in the favour of this restro, so finally on a rainy evening me n my bestie landed up in this place…at that time the place was fully empty…the decor was quite soothing…after getting ourselves sitted one uncle came to take the order…our order consisted of::
CHICKEN HOT N SOUR SOUP- we asked to serve us 1/2 individually,but the uncle told us that the quantity will be very less,but after he served the soup the quantity of each portion wasnt that small…:-)…it was perfectly made…generous amount of veggies n chicken was there…freshly ground black pepper added a great taste to it…
BUFFALO WINGS- it was perfectly crisp from outside,saucy yummy chicken pieces made our evening great…
one think i would like to mention they didnt provided any plates…we cannot eat from the same the plate in which the food was served…please take care of these things…otherwise it was a good affair…

An interesting thing happened when I put my review against this restaurant for this joint...A profile named Debashish Das commented "false" to my review.This was my review and I believe zomat 3.5 is not a bad review at all.
"This is a cute joint with polite staffs.... we ordered crispy chilly baby corn, noodles and garlice chicken.. the food was average and missing the x factor... their pricing is bit on the higher side considering the quality  item they serve."

After that I found out this is most probably the owner of this joint who uses a different profile to comment on the reviews of Tulip Global cuisine......wich is entirely wrong because any management related comment should be made from Tulip's business account and extremely unprofessional.
Seriously I am repeating again they does not use all varieties of sauce such as teriyaki , capsico,fish sauce,hunan sauce,tobasco sauce (mentioning this in case they don't  understand what exactly my review mean )...
Coming to the pricing it does not based on the Selling price of the i.e. rather it is dependent on factors like quality (obviously varies on individual opinion and if youa re in zomato you should be professional enough to face it ) and on the amount served and to me its not a fare game... 
Originally I rated this joint as 3.5 but due to their extremely un -professional attitude and pathetic comment instead of criticizing themselves I am degrading my rating for them..Till date i have visited them couple of times, but from now on will never ever visit this joint.
Image attached as evidence for why I degraded my rating....

visited this joint today because we wanted to try food from this place from a very long time as we hang out nearby. 

A nice, cozy place with appropriate lights and other things. 

the food here is awesome. I did not expect this at all, I will be honest.

The service is good if compared to the quantity of dishes that are being ordered. The staff is well behaved and helping.

I am amazed by everything this place offered.

I am surely coming back to this joint soon.

This place is on its way to become  one of the hidden gems of the food joints in Kolkata.Do not despair ever again if you are stuck in  any water logged part of Behala .Come here order their Tomato Soup.It is tangy delicious spicy light and it will warm the cockles of your heart. Follow it up with hot and crunchy Fish Fingers.They are really fresh.Now end this on a sweet note with their yummilicous Choco Waffles .Its just perfectly sweet and crisp with the chocolate sauce oozing out.A divine and sinful thing this. So the next time it rains on your plans don't crib .Come here instead and enjoy the rains.

This is a new addition to behala's cafe culture. Run by chef Debashish Das(previously a chef in a leading cruise)!

*location-
Drop off at janakalyan(just between behala chowrasta and sakher bazar). Walk down to janakalyan girls school(just a minute's walk) and there u r!

Parking for bikes is no issue at all however a car or two can be parked along the school wall as well...

The place is exactly opposite to the school under Oxford View residential complex!

*Ambience:-
Sweet & Simple!!!
Seating capacity- 20(approx.)
The seating arrangement looks calm yet cozy with pictures of the chef during his cruise days & a post-it corner.

Don't expect a Barista!!!

Subject to order!!!
Home delivery available in and around the locality!

*Food:-
Now here comes the main attraction!

Ingredients- all the sauces used are self prepared by the chef himself with ingredients, handpicked and nurtured to perfection!

Quality- Fresh ingredients (as the Bengali's say, "No bhyajaal")

Taste-
Dis place serves:-
Standard Chinese.
Good Tibetan.
Awesome Italian.

Must try-
1.Chicken steamed Momo(no soup served along)

2.Buffalo style chicken wings.

3.Spaghetti in meat balls.

4.Whatever the chef suggests!(never been let down as yet!)

#Soft drinks and ice creams available.

Since I am not much of a veg eater so haven't tried anything!

Thumbs down:(
No free WiFi!!!
Good Music or TV(playing TLC)!!!
