I have had the veg thali and the chicken thali from this place and I must say that they are good.

This place do not boast of anything and they are right at the basics. Cleaniness is there. The accompaniments are served properly and the price is reasonable.

The place is very close to my hostel, so i am their daily customer. If you want to taste some good bengali food at affordable prices, this place is for you. The quality of the food is above average with a complementary sweet dish and chutney. Service is very good with friendly staffs. The place is under development so the ambience is not upto the mark, i hope they develop it in future and i am sure they will.  And most importantly the place is very clean. 

 P.S - The place is not meant for some romantic date or birthday parties because it is no fancy restaurant.

3.Rice is of finest quality
4.lanka, lebu, with onion and cucumber slices find the place in Thalis.
