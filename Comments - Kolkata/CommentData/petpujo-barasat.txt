A small place near barasat municipality... Ambience n dÃ©cor was decent... I ordered for some chicken omlette, chicken burger n dry fruit lassi... All were very good but they need to work on their service a lot... Firstly they taken a long time to serve all the items... Although I asked to serve the dishes which are ready but they taken time and served all together... Secondly they presented a plastic spoon to had the omlette which was not that stiff enough to handle... And thirdly they didn't served any spoon for having the dry fruits which got settled in the glass... P.S. that plastic spoon was not enough to had those... Pocket pinch is friendly... Staffs are polite too... Good place for hangout with college friends...

This place is on the verge of extinction. I was waiting for a friend, who would be very late. So decided to try this spot all myself.

Very small place with not so comfortable seating arrangements. The room has a giant LED screen otherwise with Bollywood music played on it.

There's free WiFi network available, which sometimes got disrupted.

And now the main point. Nothing except cold beverages and burgers are available anymore. Cooked on flame option has  shut down, as informed by the solo attendant. I ordered Badam Lassi which tasted average. There was scarcity of badam, all I found were raisins.

Got a discount voucher of 10% for next visit within 15 days. Sadly, can't use it, because I'm not visiting ever again.

Have been here quite a few times since past month. Had burgers, fries and sandwiches on the go. Tasty food,Â good ambiance, great value for food, and friendly attitude are the reasonÂ for my revisits. A couple of items were unavailable which I wished to taste out. Worth revisiting for the burgers.

So our exploration for food,took us to a new venture in Madhyamgram. The place is cozy holding the nostalgic Kolkata memories, decorated with the stills portraying the famous places of Kolkata. A perfect destination for an evening hangout. Food was nice. We ordered Pan fried momo and Fried Schezwan momo along with masala cola and mint mojito,and it was amazing to satisfy our insatiable palate.
Surajit, the manager was a nice guy,with a proper and sweet attitude to complete the awesomeness of this place.

The ambience of the place is really soothing. Yesterday I went there for the first time and ordered momos and some coffee. I would suggest people to try the pan fried momos over there . They are really good. The coffee was also nice.. the staffs over there are also very well mannered. I just missed some good music to complement the place. Otherwise its a good place to try out . Would like to visit again ðŸ˜Š

A small and calm place with a nice ambience! The food is decent.  Service is very good, but on the other hand the prices are quite reasonable. Don't miss pan fried momo !! Would like to visit again.

Although I have not tasted any food over there...but I am writing the review on my sudden visit ...I was just passing by, suddenly looked the board & decided to have a look of it. It is situated on Rangit Apartment beside Madhyamgram Municipality & adjacent to Madhyamgram chowmatha & not into Barasat.

Ambiance : Yahh its good enough to spend good times..space is neither very big nor very small....its a simple cafe style with Â Cane Tools... .nice decoration, lighting makes a foodie crazy... :DÂ 
Food : Ahh...I have not tasted...just watched the menu card...selected items are there which can be a great companion along your friends & addas.

Surprise : I got a complementary coffee from this cafe after visiting...I met the owners of the cafe...overall it was a nice visit...got warm welcome...planning for some food plans soon.
