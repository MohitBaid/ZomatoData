Extremely bad food.
Uncooked rice. And that mix veg was extremely tasteless, how could name that 'mixed veg'?? I am very very very disappointed n I would like to recommend others not to have anything from this restaurant

Atmosphere--The place is pretty small and the ceiling is not something a tall person would like, one has to bend their head low when sitting on the top floor to dine. Decent spacing of tables. Accommodation is moderate.

Food--Elaborating on the ones I ordered individually.
1)Veg fried rice-- Decent in taste. Quantity suffices one person and justifies the price.
2)Chili mushroom-- Excess gravy. Mushroom tasted and cooked properly. Onions however were undercooked. 
3)Brownie with hot chocolate-- Brownie was perfectly on point for the taste buds. However the hot chocolate syrup was too less in quantity and too thin in context. Best part was they served two pieces of brownies in one plate, so yes! A good bite.
4)Masala coke-- Big glass. Worth the pay. Perfect blend of the masala in the coke. Perfect for thirst reliefs. 

Pocket pinch--All of the above costed 335. Best part is you pay the price exactly on the menu mentioned, no tax or gst of any sort is levied on the price mentioned in the menu.

I have visited this place around 3 to 4 times with my besties . And since I am a vegetarian and looking for pocket friendly places to eat , I found this food house to be completely fitting in with harmony. They are more commendable for Take Away and Home Delivery .

Must Try:
Sweet Corn Soup.
Paneer Tikka Sandwich.
Pasta with White Sauce.
Crispy Chilly Babycorn Dry.
Brownie with Chocolate Sauce.
Mexican Corn Pizza

Pros.
1. Good quantity of food
2. Courteous Staffs
3. Fast servicing
4. Delicious Food

Cons.
1. Low ceiling height in the seating area , difficult for tall people to stand.
2. Difficult to find the place as it is located in Amherst Street , 115/A Raja Rammohan Sarani and not close to College Street but it is on the main road opposite St. Paul's College.

This small restaurant serving vegetarian dishes is situated in Amherst street near to City college. It's a good option for veg dishes in pocket friendly price. Food quality, though not excellent is above average. Particularly paneer tikka sandwich, special paw bhaji, pan fried momo. About south Indian dishes they need to improve the quality of sambar and chutney.
Staffs are well behaved and efficient.
Only one thing which is  irritating is the ceiling of the room, it's so low that you will bang on your head even if you duck.

During my final days of my college life this place had opened up bang on opposite my college in Amherst street when there was practically no proper eating place in the surroundings nearby for college students as canteens of colleges can't be tried everyday so a eating place like this was needed .

HOW TO REACH HERE
&
THE FEEL OF THE PLACE -

The location is reachable if you are entering Amherst street lane towards St Paul's College area well there in the opposite road of a petrol pump CAPSICUM FAST FOOD CENTRE has its board up so as you enter you see steps heading upwards where sitting arrangement is done and in the ground floor the billing is done , when you go up you get to see very smart and bright coloured 5 to 6 set of tables and chairs for customers kept clean and proper which is a very nice thing as it's a fast food place with a feel of a restaurant ambience.
This place is mostly a hangout for college folks however family and other office people too consider this as an eating place option ,
moving on well it is a air-conditioned place which is very needed in summers , and they have simple standard decors which is pretty nice out there .
Talking about the service over here the staff and waiters are very polite and take your orders and get your food pretty quick as personally there was a crowd in the next table with a bulk order but still I got what I ordered in a couple of minutes .

MY ORDER AND EXPERIENCE -

I have just been there once during my last phase of my college time as i mentioned so as far as I remember I had ordered COFFEE and MASALA DOSA and after my encounter with them I have to say that the coffee was made pretty decent and rich and had a hard aroma enough for the price they charge you and it is a very good thing and about the masals dosa well it was nice and hot over loaded from the plate accompanied with sambhar and chutney however on my first bite the inside stuffing was dissapointing  but it did lift up the taste with every dip and bite mixed with the sambhar and chutney I tried along with.

And so after my experience just once I must say this place is good but can be better over the time and can get more recognized not only among the nearby people but also among the food fanatics in the city .

Unlike the other persons who has reviewed this place, my experience is quite bitter... I ve finished my lunch with their food just an hour ago...I opted for home delivery through food panda... Me with 3 of my friends ordered fried rice with Manchurian, Mexican rice with spicy veg and chocolate shake... After a long delay they came for delivery.. Charged extra Rs.35 for delivery.. Though it was in the list of their free delivery zone.. The fried rice was average.. Mexican rice too.. But spicy veg was too sallty, they sent 3 Manchurian dishes in the same container even though we asked them to send separately.. Veg balls were not good in taste.. The final shock was yet to come.. The chocolate shake they sent was hot and tasted just like bournvita.. It was a total waste.. I have not tried any other dishes.. So cant give a verdict.. But I warn u not to dare to order any Chinese items there.. On my way I saw the place a couple of times. It is near armharst street junction.. It looks a small one..

30/5/16  my earlier review was a bit harsh.. Ovioo the food was bad.. But today I ordered for veg combo.. It was quite good..

**Location = Amherst Street crossing.

** Brief = I went there to have some quick snacks along with 3 friends. The place is predominantly vegetarian :)

** Ambiance = Decent ambiance, we went to the upper section which has a low ceiling and I had difficulty standing straight.
The servers behaved nicely and were prompt with the availability of the food.

**Things tried = Panner Tikka Sandwich, it tasted good and was served hot. The filling was tasty and well cooked.
White Sauce Pasta, it was decent and I would have preferred it a bit more spicy.
Vegetable Momo, it was good and the coating of the momo was not rubbery,it was soft and delicate.Â 

**Purse Check = Rs.300/- for two people.

**Overall = It is a nice place to have some quick bites with friends :)
            

P.S. Images added of my last home delivery from there.

Capsicum is a very small and neat joint located on Amherst street near city college. The spiral stairway leads to a cramped eating place which has such a low ceiling that you'll bang your head even if you duck. But after the initial jitter one would actually be taken aback by the food as it is surprisingly tasty. The panfried momo, the chilli baby corn, the paw bhaji all were quite delicious and they score pretty high in all types of cuisines they offer. And the blue lagoon (non alcoholic) was so refreshing that for some while i thought it was the best blue lagoon i have ever had. It is a vegan joint, meat lovers might feel discontented, but for a pure veg snack experience at a low cost this is quite a place to be.
