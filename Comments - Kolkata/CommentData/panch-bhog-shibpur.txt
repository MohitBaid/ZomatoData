Though I don't love desserts that much but I have been here many times to buy sweets for home. They really have some quality sweets there. And they too have a lot of variety of snacks. I love their samosa and patties( specially their chutney) . There are a variety of sweets and they have a specialty in kheer sweets. They have colorful sweets and a lot of namkeens too. Some are a bit overpriced but their Kaju barfi is amazing and their own jhal muri is amazing too.

Very bad quality at the store at Vivek vihar.
When you ask for pre paid home delivery the quality is even worse.
On requesting them to change the goods,they refuse.

This is the king of snacks and sweets in Howrah. People from outside calcutta been here for sweets. I love the veg patties here. During diwali you can get lot of varieties of sweets. Though price a bit high..but after having some snacks here one can realise that the price is justified..
