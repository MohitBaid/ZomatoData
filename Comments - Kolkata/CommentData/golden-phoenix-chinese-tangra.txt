The restaurant is just ok. Food is only for one time. Ambience is ok. The charges are at the higher end.So I won't recommend you. You can try for there authentic Chinese cuisine.

Very nice place to enjoy drinks.....
Reasonable price. One thing you must try their Dragon Chicken, it's delicious, best appetizers I have ever had with Booze.....
We also order for Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken chilly Dry they or just okay. I think when you say chicken chilly their should be capsicum and chilly, which was missing.
Coming to the service need improvement, staffs are very casual not very attentive.
Parking staff wes very courteous.
Will visit again.

Ordered chicken fried rice and crispy fried mushroom from Golden Phoenix via swiggy.
Was shocked to see what I got for Rs.413.
food packed in may be 10 times recycled paper boxes. The quality of boxes was not better than any roadside food vendors packaging boxes.
Worst they dont give tissues and spoons. Thats what was told to me by swiggy delivery staff.
I believe all food is tasty its just the emotions which a person preparing food puts in. Teh food I received. I feel emotions in making that food were missing.
Next time you plan to eat here meet the guy first

Serves the best and tastiest food in China Town. Way better than Beijing and Golden Joy. Though the ambience needs a lot of improvement.
One must have the Mixed Rice Noodles and Phoenix Chicken here.

Awesome place. If you really wanna taste the real Chinese cuisine, go for this place. The ambiance of this place is more or less avarage but the food quality and taste is too good. Ofcourse I specially love the schezwan sauce. You have to ask for it separately otherwise it won't be given. You can go for this place, this place is just awesome. service is more or less average. You can try anything Chinese dish over here. All the dishes are just delicious. This place is not much pocket friendly and not much costly its overall middle of something.

So this restuarant is located  close to the entrance gate of Hot Wok village facing EM Byepass . They have pretty decent interiors ,and also if you want to have good food at a reasonable price in china town ,this place is the place you should be . 

What I Ordered - 

1. FRIED CHICKEN WANTONS : The wants were quite crispy and the stuffing in the inside was tasty. 

2. CHICKEN HOT & SOUR SOUP : The sweet and the spicy flavour of this soup will bring you back to this place. A good item .

3.CHICKEN RICE NOODLES : The quality of the noodles with big pieces of chicken makes the dish taste more good . 

4.DRY CHILLI CHICKEN : The chicken pieces are quite big and this item was very tasty. Do try 

5.CHILLI GARLIC PEPPER CHICKEN : If you are garlic and a pepper lover ,then then dish is for you . A good one. 

6.CRISPY FRIED PRAWN : One of the must try dishes of this place , It was quite tasty.

7.DRUMS OF HEAVEN : We ordered this in our starters and all I could say it was a perfect start . 

8.FISH FINGER : Being a ardent fish lover, the fish fingers were very tasty and the quality of fish used was quite good .

9.KUNG PAO CHICKEN : This is one of the star items of this place, besides chicken ,this dish is filled with cashew nuts making it all the more tasty 

10.MIXED FRIED RICE : The prawn, eggs , and chicken used in fried rice was quite impressing. Overall a good item to try 

11.MIXED HAKKA CHOWMEIN : Being a chinese restuarant , this place makes amazing hakka chow. 

12.PANEER PAKORA : If you are a vegetarian , do not miss out on their paneer pakora, it tastes good 

13.PEPPER BABY CORN : If you are baby corn addict ,do try this , the smell of fresh pepper fried with baby corn is impressive. 

14.PRAWN CHIPS : A basic start to my meal at this place, nothing much to say .

15.SZECHWAN CHICKEN : I had the szechwan chicken with mixed hakka chow and it was a perfect blend


Overall the quality of food is good ,but the service is a bit slow. Also the lighting of the place should improve.

I have been a frequent visitor of this place along with my friends. For tha last few years we have been visiting here. Staffs are good and since I have been frequent visitor I know few of them.
Special mention dishes which I like are Chicken rice noodles, Kung pao chicken, chilly garlic chicken and chilly paneer. The quality and quantity is pretty decent.
It has two floors, ground floor for stags and first floor for families and couples. Hope you guys will like the place as well.

It was Ashtami night and all the renowned eateries of China Town were overcrowded. We were assessing the available options when we came across this place and luckily found a table for ourselves without having to wait.
The seating arrangement is not very cozy and and the place doesn't have a very neat & tidy appearance.
However, we were quite satisfied with the food quality which although wasn't something exquisite but decent enough with respect to the pricing.
Overall we were content with both the appetizers and the main course, and left the place satisfied.

Located near the China town exit gate, this place is similar to many more restaurants that you chance upon at Tangra. Family section is separate. The place is dimly lit, neat and clean, decently decorated. Don't think there is anything extravagant about the place. The food is decent. We ordered crispy fried chicken, Green Pepper Chicken and Thai green chicken. The quantity served in one plate is sufficient for three people on an average. Nice place for a group of friends on a strict budget.

Chanced upon this restaurant on a weekend. We didn't have the time to wait in the queue for Golden Joy so we opted for this place. They have separate family sections. The place looks shabby and not much thought of the decor. The lights were dim. The food was okay. An extremely simple restaurant but prices were not so simple!!

An eatery situated in China town is a bar come restaurant like those numerous outlets in this area. The prices of alcohol is amazingly cheap over here, thus when you have a crunch do opt for this. The family room is on the 1st floor and is spacious and neatly decorated. 
As for food the menu offered a huge variety of starters, main dishes and sides. 
We settled for some snacks namely chilly mushroom and crispy chicken and chilli garlic fish. All the dishes were oily and a bit too fried. 
All in all a good option for month ends and friendly addas over some tit-bits.

Procrastinator's review 002
There are days when one realises how poor and unimportant he is. One of those days is the 31st of December. So on that day while the world decided to go places and do things we decided to hit this joint in the evening and enjoy the emptiness- both in our lives and the restaurant. 
The food here is pretty decent but don't expect a Big Boss like palate or the ambience. Never the less one receives a nice TV to catch up with the sports. The waiters are more "dada" and less of a "waiter" type. 
If one wants to taste Tangra in a budget and considers food more important than ambience this is the place to be. And as always bon appetite....

I really don't know how to describe this restaurant . First of all it is located at the milan mela end , to enter which you have to take the lane of golden joy & walk 12 mins non  stop , which is unbearable , because of the narrowness of the lane . also after finishing your meal , you won't find any taxis / cabs here because of the oddity of the location . only saving grace is that it is near to the bypass . That apart i can't find any positives for this joint . Ambiance is zilch ( zero ) to be precise .  Quantity of food is very less , &  NO , it is NOT pocket friendly . alcohol is also on the expensive side .  A 60 ml peg of Antiquity Blue would cost you upwards rs 160 . I don't call the economical . Coming to my experience , I went there on  a  lazy afternoon to find it Nearly Empty  ( justifiably so ) , with some old   stags drinking their  poison . the place is small & dingy & very dimly lit . Once i entered i thought of coming out immediately , but was persuaded otherwise by my fellow mates , who thought that the 12 minute walk would otherwise  go to waste . we sat down  & after looking at the BAR MENU  decided to opt out of drinks . we ordered  2 glasses   of fresh lime soda ( 2 x 50 = 100 rs ) , which tasted like numbu pani with   very little soda .   Disappointed , we ordered to bottles of thumbs up as refreshment  ( 2X 30 = 60rs ) . in starters we ordered 1  full plate of chilli garlic pepper prawn ( rs 420 ) , which had 10 pieces of shrimps rather than prawns , & way too  salty  in taste .  Half plate ( 1/2) of crispy fried prawn was also ordered ( rs 250 ) , which had 6 pieces of shrimp again . Since we were hungry ,   & tired , we decided to bear the ordeal , & ordered the main course .   We ordered 1 plate of prawn fried rice which cost  us rs 160 . given the price we thought that the quantity  would be huge . to our  utter  disappointment the fried rice  could barely feed two people .  we had also ordered 1/2 plate chicken in hot garlic sauce  ( rs 190 )    , half plate sweet & sour fish (  rs 220 )  &  1 plate of prawn hakka chow ( rs 140 ) . the chow was salty , &  the chicken  preparation straight out of a  roadside eatery . to be  Fair to them the sweet & sour  Fish was good in taste & my entire 1.5 points is for the fish only ( now you can imagine how frustrated i am even while writing this review ).  To sum it  up , a horrible decision to end up in this restaurant & an experience best forgotten soon . 

My advice : please avoid as you have been forewarned !!!

Well if you are short on money and need a hearty meal with a little alcohol this is a place to be. Me and my friends always visit this place. The liquor here is cheap and they give you the complete bottle(not many places that do that). I love the baby corn manchurian as my starter. I being a non alcoholic cannot suggest the drinks to order here but the chicken noodles is satisfactory if not more. Also a drunk friend broke a glass here but the management did not charge us anything. The mood is a little down with no music or anything also you are not allowed to smoke inside which is a bummer if you are a smoker(unlike me). Overall the experience was good and it was pocket friendly.

This was a joint that has never disappointed me starting from the quality, quantity of the food and moreover the unconditional service that they provided me throughout the last 4 years. They have served drinks even after the restaurant was closed at around 12.15!! Kept the parking slot open till I drove out. You can drop in to check but I would suggest the owner to increase the stock of variety of beers.

First of all I have visited this restaurant for the first time and it did surprise me with the quantity and quality of food as well as service at their end which was actually pretty good in terms , as I had come with my friends and after eating a sufficient meal of rice ,chow ,dragon chicken and also not to forget some soft drinks and juices the bill came to just 950 bucks .

My verdict - Isn't that a good deal for a group of four in an authentic resto ?
So better go at least once
