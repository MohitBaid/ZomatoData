Decent place,liked the chicken pakora and chicken fried momo for starters.

The main course was a bit of disappointment though.

I ordered the classic :- 

(1) Chicken Fried Rice

(2) Chicken Garvy Noodles

(3) Chilly Chicken 

(4) Manchurian Chicken

The food looked good but I wish I could say the same about the food.The food was pretty average and also the behaviour of the staff was not so good and also the service was pathetic.They took forever to serve the dishes to us.

Not coming to this place again.

Never tried many dishes, but tried pan fired mono for atleast a dozen of occasions. I guess that says it all. It's just yummy every single time. Once tried chicken lolly pop and fried rice. They were just OK considering price range. Decor is horrible but yet gives a cozy feeling.

I Visited This Place Zaika, Golpark For The 1st Time On 16th April 2017 After Attending A Program At My Morning Glory Integrated School From 3:30pm - 5:30pm After That I Ordered 1 Plate Mixed Gravy Chowmein With Egg+Chicken+Prawn For Rs. 135/- It Was Awesome And Tasty. Thank you Zaika For Making My Day Superb.

The food quality is not good though all the stuffs are friendly and cooperative. They served in time abut they should take care on the quality and presentation especially in North Indian dishes,.

We visited this place on the day of holi with college friends after playing with dry colours (abir).
Not wanting to enter a restaurant in that condition, we ordered rolls from here to kill our hunger for the time being.
It had been over an hour and our seven rolls still couldn't be prepared. People with lesser number of orders were being served first.
We had already paid for the order and were repeatedly telling them to hurry up. But they were taking their ancestors' time without even lending an ear. Finally, we got so mad that we were about to leave and asked for a refund when they finally handed it to us.
I don't even remember how the roll was given such a horrible experience it was. Never had to wait that long in my life for a roll.

Used to be a common hangout place during my college days. I have a special liking for their mixed noodles and Chinese Chopsuey. Biriyani not very good but do try their Ring Paratha and Chicken Bharta. Simply delicious. The place is ok with a bit of space crunch. They even have a separate AC section with just two table and added tax. But if you go, better avoid the AC part, its a bit stuffy in there. Service a bit slow, but the food they serve is good and piping hot. Located exactly opposite to the RMIC library, this place holds a special place for me. If you are around, try their chinese. With reasonable price and surplass quantity, you may find a new and cheap place to hang out

Why this place is still operating is still a mystery to me. Located at the prime loaction of golpark they could have done som much. Zero decor and ambience, stale food, lazy service. This place shouldnt exist on the food map of Kolkata

Zaika is not among the popular places but still known to most of us. It's located just near the famous grub club which is at the opposite foot of the Ramakrishna Mission.

The mainly offer Chinese cuisine in their offerings and has a very average food taste and quality. I don't have much complaints as I had a very little expectation from them. But they never take an effort to make their place popular.
