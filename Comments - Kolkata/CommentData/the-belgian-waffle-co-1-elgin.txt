I m a big fan of this Belgian waffle..!! I had it in Mumbai for the first time..n I was really happy when it got open in Kolkata too..when I had my first waffle in Kolkata outlet it was very nice but after 2 months it has degraded their quality which is disappointing...only opening several outlets will not help pls maintain the quality as i would love to have those waffles again n again..!

Heard a lot about this place and I finally decided to give it a go since I was nearby that place. It's located in the lane opposite of the forum mall and is quite a popular spot for a quick snack.
Ambience- The outlet is small and I had to wait outside for receiving my ordered waffles. But it was nicely decorated and was looking quite good.
Food- ordered a chocolate overload and a red velvet, which were quite good considering the low pricing. 
Service- this is the department in which they should improve themselves. They took 20 minutes to serve the red velvet waffle but the other order was not given to me. On enquiring about it they said that it was being prepared with another batter and it would take some time, although the same waffle was being served to other customers who ordered after me. I finally received it after 15 minutes. This was quite absurd and I hope they don't do it again. 
All in all it was a decent place and I'd love to try out the other waffles.

Waffles are the new cool thing in town. They are an 'eat while you run' kinda food. The Belgian Waffle Co. has a great range of waffles including hot and cold waffles along with different shakes. We had chocolate ice cream waff wich with oreo shake and we weren't disappointed. They are extremely pocket friendly and the service isn't bad either.

Waffles are the hot new items in town and many new waffle places have opened up in the town in the last few months! Among them, this place has been on wish list for quite some time and I finally visited it yesterday. 
It's a small pretty outlet near the forum mall and as soon as we entered inside we were greeted by the irresistible smell of waffles in the making. 
Coming to the taste, we ordered the strawberry creamcheese and naked nutella waffles.
Both were served within 10 mins. They were warm, comforting and super delicious! Though I think the strawberry waffle really lacked cream and was a bit too jammy. The nutella one was a cracker though!
Would love to visit again to try out the other flavours.
Pocket pinch-- 310 including gst. So yes I think it's quite pricey, considering the size.

Finally my wait for good waffles in the city is over! 
This outlet is located opp. Fabbrica Della Pizza. It's really tiny and always over crowded. Decked up in yellow, it's got 3/4 seats- so it's just a take away. The best thing about this place is the smell of freshly cooked waffles. 
The ones I tried were the red velvet waffle and of course the Nutella waffle. Both absolutely delicious- crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

No doubts I'll be a regular here.

Though a small shop and is crowded most of the time , this place serves amazing waffles. Among the many options we tried the dark and white fantasy and the Belgian chocolate waffles. Both were too good . Though very much crowded we only waited for hardly 15 mins. We also tried the Chocolate shake . The hot , fresh , rich chocolatey waffles along with the cool shake made an awesome combination. 
The only minus point is the tiny space of the shop. We had to wait outside after placing our order.

Best waffle shop in kolkata i must say. Peanut butter and chocolate waffle and chocolate overload waffle are the best to have if one is a chocolate lover. I had waffle from many waffle shops in kolkata but this is the best. I have fallen in love with  the waffles they make. The waffles are hot, pefectly sweetened and they have so many good combinations.

This cute little place is very cozy and you will always find a lot of customers. My regular is blueberry cheesecake , I always order that. The waffle will cost you 150 including tax.

Was here at this place this evening owing to my curosity after visiting the Salt Lake outlet and to my notice the staff was way more courteous and service were more fast in Salt lake outlet than here, that might be  to so many order at a time,hence justified. Moreover a lovely and delicious Chocolate overloaded Waffle in hand makes you forget everything bad.....but i look forward to visit the Salt Lake outlet over abd over again rather than here but to mention the waffle was too delicious.

Bottom line: for all the waffle lovers, it‚Äôs a must go! We have tonnes of waffle outlets in the city now, but for sure this takes the cake away! They have massive lines through the week so keep some time handy before you head 

What to order: I always always go for the naked Nutella, like keeping it simple 

USP: its a chain and have many outlets across bombay, Jodhpur and Manu other cities. Hence you can expect them to maintain their quality

A place you must try. A small joint of waffle wonderland. They have three outlets, one in Elgin, one in Sector 1, and one in Avani Mall, Shibpur. This is located on the opposite lane of Fabbrica Della Pizza. They serve hot and fresh, crispy waffles here! 
The decor is pretty minimal, with bar stools lined on one side. The staff is interactive and service is quite quick. 
We tried their Chocolate Ice-cream waff-wich. It was really delicious! Price is reasonable. Going back for more waffles!

Waffle is my Kryptonite and when you get a place like 'The Belgian Waffle Co.' so close to your palce,you can't help but go here again and again.I have already visited twice and my review will be based on those two visits.

'The Belgian Waffle Co.' is located in Allenby road opposite to Fabrica Della Pizza,in the lane opposite to Forum. The outlet is a small one. The d√©cor is minimalistic but quirky with quotes like ' Waffles are Pancakes with abs'. The lighting is a warm one with high tables and high chairs. The waffles that I tried during my two visits are as follows:-

1) Dark and White Fantasy Waffle- The first one that I tried over here. You can choose whether to use dark or white chocolate.The waffle is topped with fresh cream/ The waffle is warm and delicious. This waffle can warm anyone's heart.

2)Vanilla Ice Cream Waffle Wich with Extra Nutella- The name itself explains the fact that this waffle wich was delicious. A huge chunk of¬† vanilla-ice cream within the warm¬† waffle topped with Nutella made the dish a divine one.

3)Chocolate Overload with whipped cream- Dark chocolate waffle with ample amount of Nutella inside and topped with whipped cream was a delicacy.

The staff was courteous and well-behaved and I will surely visit again.

I have visited this place thrice, and, every time, it's crowded with people of all ages, happily munching their Waffles.

The courteous staff at any place gets an addition brownie point, but, the way they multi-task and manage their customers is commendable.

Have tried Chocolate Overload and Belgian Chocolate and they were really good and worth the money.

This waffle outlet is located right opposite Jhoomar and Fabrica della Pizza. It's a small shop with limited seating. However, you can wait outside while your order is being prepared, and they'll call you when it's time.

FOOD: here are the waffles we ordered-

1) Naked Nutella - Beautiful golden waffles with a generous helping of Nutella. Really tasty and highly recommended.
2) Belgian Chocolate - we tried both the milk and dark chocolate versions. They were both delightful and the waffles were cooked to perfection. I personally liked the milk chocolate one a bit more :D
3) Blueberry Cream Cheese - golden waffles with a layer of cream cheese and lots of blueberry compote. I found it a bit too sweet, but my friend really enjoyed it.¬†

SERVICE: the staff was cheerful and polite, and the service was also quick despite the place being crowded.

I would highly recommend this outlet of Belgian Waffles Co. for their amazing waffles and generous portions. Will surely be back soon!

The Belgian waffle.

It's a small waffle parlour situated on Elgin road , Kolkata.They stand out to be pioneers in making waffles. The naked Nutella is one of it's most sold waffles. You drool over the amazing taste of Nutella in the waffle. It has a small and a tidy counter , yellow in colour. Also , it works on the takeaway basis. The waffles are soft , crunchy and irresistible. As a whole, Belgian waffle is the best waffle parlour for a person who craves for chocolate and waffles. Do visit them when you plan your next trip to Kolkata.

A very crowded waffle spot in town. I had to wait around 45 mins to get my hands on my freshly prepared hot waffles. The staff members are really helpful and they helped me choose the best waffles there. This particular small yet pretty outlet is located right opposite to one of the famous pizzerias which is "Fabbrica Della pizza". They have extremely limited seating and it is mostly a take away counter.

1. BELGIAN CHOCOLATE WAFFLES-- They tasted extremely delicious with the Belgian chocolate oozing out. I had also added chocolate icecream as addon which just made the whole waffle tasting experience tastier and they suggested me to go for the dark waffles. The waffles were definitely value for money.

Absolutely RECOMMENDED.

A sudden surge for need of waffles has made waffle stores spurting in all corners of the city. This outlet on the opposite lane of forum mall grabs a lot of young patrons throughout the day. Joining in for some fun experience I ordered one red velvet and one nutella waffle.  It's a sandwich kind of, with a quarter of a waffle on another with your choicest fillings/toppings. Red velvet has a white chocolate filling and nutella has nutella (obviously). The crunchiness and  texture is perfect with appropriate amount of filling. Mastering simple things is always a challenge and it fulfills.

We initially ordered Chocolate Overload waffle, but after waiting for so long it turned out that they mistook the order for Belgian Chocolate waffle(Dark and Milk). When we brought this to their attention we were asked to cooperate with them since we were already billed. The team should be a little more meticulous. However, when we took a bite of the crisped Belgian Chocolate waffle, it compensated for it all because it tasted really good. It cost us ‚Çπ 260. Gonna pay a visit soon to try out the Chocolate Overload one!

The place is extensively small even for 10 people. The service and food is commendable. The food is really filling for the price. Best recommended is the Dark Chocolate and Salted caramel, as well as the blueberry cream cheese. They even offer you extra spoons and paper towels if you ask for it. Quality is fresh off the oven, made with wholesome ingredients in a very hygienic place so it's a good place for takeaway, not for a sit down meal.

The wait to visit The Belgian Waffle Co. ended today and it was worth it. Right opposite to the Forum Mall front gate you will find Cream Centre, walk down that lane and after crossing Fabrica Della you will reach your destination.

A small and tidy counter decked up in yellow with handful of chairs and a bench it is more of a takeaway counter than anything else. Every waffle we tasted here were delicious and fresh, but will brief about each one. Coffee Waffee is a must if you are into coffee, and even if you are not; who cares just gobble it down. Next came the Bubblegum Velvet, and again outstanding. You are in for a treat if you are a fan of White Chocolate as the Dark and White Fantasy will make you crave for more. Had the Cold Coffee as well, which didn't amaze us but certainly worth a shot.

The waffles are soft but at the same time crunchy, and instead of showering down toppings they prefer to present it as a sandwich making them irresistible. However, the prices have mushroomed all of a sudden, so a better pricing system would help everyone. Excluding the price, The Belgian Waffle Co. could be the next go to spot for dessert in Elgin.

By the number of cars parked outside the outlet, it seems that the govt has to widen the road more so that there is smooth way for the vehicles to communicate...  Carry on the same hard work and quality more for a year and you will do wonders and the city of joy will be proud in having this outlet..

Well my waffle craving kinda got satisfied after i visited this place.
I was pretty keen and eager to drop in and try out some since our city has kinda been taken over by a waffle storm.
Paid a pretty late visit here at this small joint stationed close to Forum mall, dropped in at around 10pm expecting the place to be empty but it was filled with people eager to grab a bite here in.
I picked up 2 kinds. 
Chocolate Overload and Dark and white fantasy. 
Lemme tell you something my first bite was amazing.
I loved every bit of it. 
I didnt really expect that it would turn out to be a uber good experience for me. 
For me chocolate overload was undoubtedly the star in there. With dark chocolate highly satisfying my sweet tooth. 
I would definetly come back here to try out more variants. 
If you kinda get waffle cravings like me you should be headed to this place. 
This place gets a 'Must Visit' tag from me.

I just love this place... They make waffles so handy and ready to eat... Even the shakes are amazing. One of the best places to have waffles in Kolkata 
 One must try the following waffles:
‚Ä¢ Dark and white 
‚Ä¢ Red Velvet(only if you are a die heart red velvet fan)
‚Ä¢Chocolate overload is a must try
If you haven't visited the place then I would surely recommend you to visit it because you must try the waffles along with the shakes.

This place is creating quite a buzz now a days and after tasting their waffle I can surely say it's just amazing. Though this tiny place is always crowded they serve the best waffle in town right now. We took Belgian milk chocolate waffle. It was soft inside crunchy outside and filling of milk chocolate was just perfect. I am just too excited to taste the othe flavours soon.

It is exactly near fabbrica della pizza
Place is very small and always crowded 
And it should be because its taste do attract people I've tried the red velvet here which was really yumm and the waffle they serve is not that much crunchy 
It is tasty anyway...

Waffle lovers in Kolkata have a new go to place.. "The Belgian Waffle Co".. opened a few months ago on Allenby Road (opposite Forum Mall).. manned by a super efficient and friendly Yash Khanna, and his crew. They serve some interesting flavours.. there are plans to open a few more outlets over the coming months.. Sinful and irresistible..

This place is located at a walk's distance from Forum Mall and is just opposite¬† Fabbrica Della Pizza.It won't be difficult for you to find this place at all.
As you enter you will be welcomed by the sweet aroma of freshly baked waffles.
I do agree that this place is small and cannot accommodate a lot of people at once,but the waffles these people bake is rich in taste and it does tick all boxes required for it to be lip-smacking. I had tried the chocolate overload.
The staff members are well spoken and polite.
Will visit again soon ,and it is worth all the hipe that this place created in Kolkata.

A new and a very sweet dessert joint opened, just to opposite lane of forum mall serves you with varieties of sweet waffles.
And when i say "waffles" it is something which we have been watching on TV, as an item in morning breakfast which foreigners start their day with.üòãüòâ
So i had to try to this and I landed up to this place ordering for a strawberry cheese and red velvet waffles. And honestly taste was good and something i would say we got a new addition in the menu of our dessert list which is available easily in kolkata..
On the cost part wont say it is quiet reasonable, Coz it costs Rs.150/- for one waffle which will serve only one person..

I love waffles both savoury and sweet so when I chanced upon The Belgian Waffle Co. I was eager to try there waffles. My personal belief is that the simple dishes are always the hardest to master so decided to opt for the Maple Butter Waff-wich which is the waffle version of a sandwich. I was absolutely delighted with the end product ... perfect taste and texture and just the right amount of maple butter.Cannot wait to go back and try more stuff soon.

From your packing to pricing to taste. Bang in line!! 

I've tried your red velvet, blueberry, peanut butter, dark chocolate, mill chocolate waffles respectively and they were all great! 

My favorite though was the peanut butter!! Just open more stores guys!! 
Cheers!

They have brought about a new addition in desserts and they indeed have done it well. Their outlet in Elgin road is a small one but irrespective of the day of the week it is full house and you have to wait quite a while. Nutella waffle is one of the best sellers and their ice cream waffwich. My personal favourite blueberry waffle.

A desert treat for all those who have sweet tooth Belgian Waffles a small outlet near Forum Mall is the city's new destination which is flooded with people most of the time.Though the place is crowded yet they are polite and serve you with a smile. I had ordered a Red Velvet Waffle and Choclolate Overload out of which I liked Chocolate overload more. Initially when I had the waffles I loved it but slowly it was too much sweetness for me as I don't have much appetite for sweet.
Overall it was good but a one time visit for me.

Located in Allenby Road , currently one of the coolest lanes in Kolkata , this tiny little outlet packs a big punch. The waffles are really good and the outlet is always brimming with people ! Overall experience is amazing and though the pocket pinch is a bit high but the taste of the waffles make up for it !
Food Ordered - Nutella Waffle , Chocolate Overload and the strawberry cheesecake waffle.
Value for money - 4/5
Food Quality - 4.5/5

The Belgian Waffle Co. is located at the opposite lane of Forum Mall and just opposite to the Fabrica Della Pizza restaurant.

It is a small outlet and the place was too crowded. Even I waited for 33 mins to get my order.

Now coming to price menu which attracted me when I saw on zomato. Menu has lots of offerings.

I tried Chocolate overload and Dark & White Fantasy.

Both of the waffles werw tatsty but I found the problem that was compared to the topside the fillings were not so good so that's why it became dry in your mouth.

Else for 1 time eat it was good experience and pocket pinch was acceptable.

The best place for Waffles in town, that will definitely keep you coming back for more! Always serving crispy and hot waffles, they're meant to be devoured on the spot (and come with specific instructions for the delay in eating!), they don't disappoint in the quality of Waffles served. It's a minimum wait of 15-20 mins, because they're perpetually crowded!
I tried a number of their Waffles, and here's reviewing them, rank wise:
1) Naked Nutella is hands-down one of their best Waffles, especially if you like your Waffles to be super sweet and chocolate-y.¬†
2) If you're more on the health-conscious side of things, you should try their dark chocolate overload/Belgian dark chocolate. Their milk versions are just as great, if you're looking for something on the sweeter side.¬†
3) Their Red Velvet with Cream Cheese was something that I enjoyed. When you take the first bite, you get a whole lot of the cream cheese, and that might be really salty to taste (but you do get used to it!) However, if you don't like your food to be on the salty side, ask for additional Nutella, or dark chocolate; it strikes the perfect balance!
4) Their honey/maple butter waffle is like any other classic waffle, if you want to play it safe! With generous layers of honey/maple (albeit not-so-generous with butter), this waffle is wholesome!
5) Their Coffee Wafee seemed to be more of a milk chocolate waffle (which was a bit too¬† sweet, even for milk chocolate) with a very slight under-tone of coffee to it. If you're a hardcore caffeine lover, this Waffle won't do you justice.¬†
6) Their peanut butter and chocolate Waffle just didn't cut it for me. It felt as though the chocolate and peanut butter just weren't in the correct proportion which is why the saltiness of the peanut butter over-powered the sweetness of the chocolate.¬†¬†
Highly recommend this place, if you're a waffle lover! (bonus points for their hassle free, on-the-go serving of waffles.)
I've tasted half their menu. The other half awaits. Any suggestions, foodies, on what I should try next? I was thinking dark and white fantasy! Comment below your views on the same, and if you found my review helpful. Hope you had a great day, with great food!

Well, for you Kolkata people, this is a new chain that‚Äôs spreading it‚Äôs roots here and they serve amazing waffles. Typically, I‚Äôd rate it 4.0 but i think the restaurant is still learning and is unable to serve hot waffles! Belgian waffles are best served hot. There‚Äôs also very less space to stand even. Further, they are yet to come up with the Red Velvet waffle so I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a lot of scope of growth and improvement. 
Nonetheless, you ought to try waffles if you haven‚Äôt already and fall in love with it, especially with the ones from The Belgian Waffle Co.!

Overall - I‚Äôll still visit.

Going out for a date or a friend's meet up? Or is it your cheat day? After you are done and dusted with food, visit this place located in Allenby Road, the lane just opposite to Forum Mall. For this place offers waffles to die for. Its a tiny store and I found it very crowded( thumbs up for thatüòâ). They prepare the waffles right in front of the customer, so one have the option of directing the amount of chocolate that goes into it. Tried out their Chocolate Overload and Nutella Shake.. I must say both are praise worthy. The sweetness was in correct proportion and satiates one's desert cravings to the fullest. Would love to visit again.
P.s. Do deliver your orders a little faster. 20 mins waiting time is too long for a waffle.

This is a small kiosk eatery in opposite Fabrica Della Pizza near the lane of FORUM. They serve amazing waffles, though I would say they're a bit expensive. I've been here thrice by now and I haven't seen the place empty even once. It's main USP is it's location, near BESC. They're most selling waffle is the choclate overload waffle, and as you step inside the place you can smell the amazing aroma of freshly baked waffles.

The Belgian Waffle Co. Is probably the most trending place in town at present. Situated right opposite Fabrica Della Pizza, this place is always crowded and have a very little seating capacity, they should increase that as soon as possible. Now they serve the best waffles of course. Staffs are very good and the service as well. We had Chocolate Overload and Coffee Waffee. Both were delicious. Coffee Waffee had the perfect flavour of caffeine and chocolate overload can never go wrong. Price is reasonable.

A small space, cozy yet cute. The waffles they serve are amazing and way to crispy and all ready to melt in your mouth. They serve it in a triangular paper cone in the waffle's shape and that actually really cute. If you want to carry away your waffles, they provide you with a box which is yet again too cute to be thrown. A must try place for everyone for once at least.

This is a small food joint located at Allenby road that concentrates mostly on whacky dishes of waffles. It stays packed most of the time so spaceous is not the biggest advantage here but it's not such a big issue anyways.
Ranging from basics to specials, you'll find mostly every dish quite delicious. The waffles themselves are pretty big and crunchy, the service is fast and accurate and the prices are quite reasonable as well. Overall, a definite recommendation to everyone out there.

Must tries - Dark Chocolate Overload, Belgian Chocolate Waffle, Blueberry Creamcheese, Dark and White Fantasy Chocolate Icecream Waffle-wich.

This is the place we didn't know we've all been waiting for! Located at the alley bang opposite to the back entrance of Forum Mall, this place is on its way to win the town over. 
The best part is surely the simplicity. Freshly made warm waffles with sinful spreads or ice cream (or both!) and delicious iced drinks on the go. They make their waffles really good, crispy golden on the outside, soft fluffy in the inside. And they have a maddeningly decadent variety of spreads in store to hit your dessert cravings right at the sweet spot. You can also mix and match with the combinations to get your perfect waffle sandwich. 
So head over to get your fix before the rest of the town does!

The Belgian Waffle Co. is a great place to have waffles and ice cream sandwiches.I tried the Nutella waffle and blueberry cheesecake waffle.The Nutella one tasted amazing and the blueberry one was also good.But the outlet is very small and it gets crowded when only 8-10 people are there at once.

Well veey easy to spot. Opposite forum mall. Small cozy setup with good infrastructure. The waffles were being made quick and crisp. However , the milk chocolate was finished even with the unlimited crowd coming in. 
About th waffles. I had strawberry cheesecake, belgian dark chocolate, and one more. Well, it was good. But I didnt have the love feeling which I have for waffles. As it was cold .. Yet crispy. Well, I wouldnt mind having a bite. But one entire waffle wouldnt atteact me here.

So, a lot of reviews have complained about the crunchiness of the waffles it them being burnt. I faced none of these problems and I'm glad I went here. It's probably the best waffle place in Kolkata! The waffles were cooked perfectly and were so wafery and crunchy. We ordered the Nutella one, Dark Chocolate Overload and Strawberry. The strawberry one was simply yum and so was the dark chocolate one. A very small place but cute decor. Hardly any place to sit and it is usually quite crowded. The cashier guy is super enthu as well. I really enjoyed my visit and this place is highly recommended. :)

The first one of its kind, The Belgian Waffle Co. promises to give your sweet buds a feast and will leave you wanting more. With a wide variety of waffles, this place is definitely worth visiting. However, the space is a small drawback.

I had the opportunity of visiting waffle company within the first few days, and I must say it was worth it.
I had ordered a chocolate overload with milk chocolate which was drool worthy, an ice cream waffle which was okay, not very good since I felt there could have been little more chocolate.
I also ordered the signature Belgian waffles, which were awesome. 
They also range in a number of shakes which are good.
The prices are decent and trust me completely worth it.

This place is right next to Cream Centre, just a few meters away from Forum mall in Elgin road. Decent waffles at reasonable prices. Not a lot of variety. I ordered 1 oreo milkshake, 1 red velvet shake, 1 red velvet waffle with cream cheese and 1 chocolate overloaded waffle. It's good enough to go once in a while for a change. It is definitely not a place to go in a big group. The place is very small, more like a kiosk, good for take away. The red velvet waffle was good. ^_^

This place is basically a take away with very less room. The waffles are served like a sandwich of 2 quarters, with a filling of your choice,
In a paper cone.
Don't go expecting a generously topped plated waffle you can dig in with a fork.
We took a Maple Butter Waffle with vanilla ice cream and a Blueberry Cheesecake waffle.
Both waffles had a slightly bitter burnt taste possibly because it was overdone. The bitterness totally spoilt the cheese cream flavour, and the blueberry was already less sweet.
The maple one was better because of the ice cream, but I feel the waffles in general are more wafer-y and lacked the inner sponginess.

All the weeks of scrolling through pictures and finally visiting this place was worth it. Obviously, the one thing every one points out is that this Waffle junction hardly has much space. But my heart and tummy felt too big to notice anything but the sweet treats here.
We tried:
‚òÜRed Velvet Shake: When you take a sip out of it, it has a mild sweet creamy flavour but by the time you gulp it, a slightly salty buttery smooth feel spreads in your mouth. It was the best surprise that day. Combining a shake with a waffle gives you a 20 rs off btw.
‚òÜDark and White fantasy hot Waff-wich; the rich chocolatey waffle and the fresh cream cheese filling was too good.
‚òÜVanilla Ice cream waff-wich; this had the plain waffle and the warm crust with the fresh vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce, is there anything to complain about?
The wonderful smell of the baked goods that creep up through your nostrils while waiting for your Waffles was way too distracting.
The service I felt was efficient, cuz they were managing their continuous inflow of customers in a courteous and speedy manner.

The very best of Waffles comes to Kolkata!!
Bang opposite to Fabbrica Della Pizza, this small shop serves the best of what you crave!!
With quick service and an amiable environment, this place is surely a good hangout.
Recommended is the Chocolate Overload ( Dark ) and the Strawberry Waffle. 
However, the space inside is a bit limited, so it's mainly cool for takeouts.
Overall, a nice place to meetup, have some good waffle takeout and enjoy the smooth yet crunchy waffles with the delicious flavour of dark chocolate tickling your taste buds.

With all the rage about this place, I decided to drop by and overall it was an ok experience for me. The place is cute, colourful & cramped. Limited seating options and it's more a QSR. The half sandwich waffle is crunchy, which i wasn't expecting, but its different and nice. Variety of toppings are offered for your taste buds. The chocolate overload could have been more rich and chocolatey and blueberry one was fresh. Portions are very small and apt for a person only. Price is definitely on the steep side. No option to pay by card as yet.

Having been to the Mumbai outlet of theirs, I was really excited that Belgian Waffle set up shop in town. However, I was left disappointed with the waffles that we tried out. A couple of us tried the Naked Nutella, Blueberry cream cheese (which lacked any cream cheese whatsoever) and the Belgian Milk Chocolate. All were pretty average, nothing spectacular.

This kiosk is a stone‚Äôs throw away from Forum Mall, right opposite Fabrica Della Pizza. They have managed to put some seats together within the little space but the place is always crammed up. The attendants looked really unskilled and unorganised. For instance, I had to call several times just to place my order and the cashier gave my bill and change to some other guy, and again he served my waffle to someone else. Three or four people were working in a small chaotic kitchen having no idea about the orders and servings. I hope this is not an everyday scene.

Quarter of a waffle folded into a sandwich with some fillings and served in cute paper cones. My Red Velvet Waffle was warm and nicely stuffed with cr√®me but it should have been better. These are basically quick bites, so the prices are definitely higher and should be reconsidered.

Best waffles in the city!! It's a little on the steep side, but it's completely worth it! I went for the chocolate overload dark which was to die for- crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside! The place is very very small so it's not a good place to go and hang out or sit with a big group of friends. In fact there are just 3 or 4 barstools, but the service is really fast and efficient so even when it is over-crowded you don't have to wait for too long. And the waffles, truly, are out of this world!

A small junction located at 7B, Allenby Road, Elgin. This place is a must go for a sweet tooth. Its well decorated and simple, but is quite appealing form the outside.
The staff is very well behaved and knows what they are selling to the customer.¬†
People from any age group can enjoy their precious waffle at this magnificent junction.¬†
This was my first time, I tasted Waffles. And after my first bite I felt so pleased.¬†

Waffles Ordered: Banana Salted Caramel, Butterscotch Crunch, Dark & White Fantasy and Belgian Chocolate.¬†
Pocket Pinch: Rs.530 (Including GST)
The Banana Salted Caramel and Dark & White Fantasy is a must try for Waffle lovers.

The Waffles are pretty fairly priced and is pocket friendly.
Cost for two: Rs.300 approx (Including GST)

I would have given this magnificent joint a 5/5, but the seating capacity is too small for a crowd of more than three.

Although their outlet is small in size....they do make some finger licking waffles and yummy shakes. We tried their waffles through delivery first but found it soggy. The taste however compelled us to drive to it the very next day. Trust me....we were no dissappointed. The taste and pricing of the food is simply perfect!

They offer you a large variety of waffles and banana popsicles, with a lot of options for add ons. 
We went for the chocolate overload waffle, and classic Belgian waffle bot of the dark variety. 
And oh my god. I wasn't surprised but what deliciousness it was. I'm not even exaggerating . 

This is a must for all sweet tooth out there, and also otherwise you have to have to visit once at least.

The waffle was crispy and the filling was this creamy ganache of dark chocolate. Their presentation of food is also very good. They serve in paper cones for the convenience of eating it. Waffle ice cream sandwiches are also served here. The prices are a bit on the higher side but it‚Äôs really worth it. I got the waffles packed , and the packaging was really cute and reflected the effort put into it. Best waffles from Mumbai now In Kolkata.

This place seems to have become quite the rage and deservedly so. Super crunchy, decadent waffles, especially the nutella & chocolates ones. I'm curious to see how well the risky red velvet waffle fares. While I agree that a quarter waffle is the perfect solo dessert portion, the price point is too high. Finally, on the positive, It takes very little for customers to go from patient to irate and I saw this being managed well on the day.

Although taste was good and waffle was crunchy I would say a very small portion(just two quadrants) was served they can charge a bit more and give a whole waffle or it might be that they wanted a on the go serving outlet but overall a good place to grab a sweet bite.

Finally this Mumbai based waffle shop opens a franchise at elgin , opposite to Fabrica della pizza on Allenby road. The space though air-conditioned is very small with three high tools and a wallside slab and almost always entirely occupied.I tried a Blueberry Cheesecake waffle , a quarter portion of which came in cone pack , non photogenic but a handy way of serving . Honestly i was a bit disheartened as the waffle lacked crunch , and the sogginess gave a feeling of gulping down a warm golden bread filled with blueberry jam. Price wise Rs 150 didnot justify the serving. Also , there isn't any option of topping the waffles with add ons like cut or dry fruits , syrup drizzles or some whipped cream ; which failed to fully satisfy my serious waffle cravings.
my second visit was again dissapointing since i planned to try their chocolate waffles and they ran out of chocolate both white and milk. I had NAKED NUTELLA and RED VELVET WITH CREAM CHEESE with strawberry filling as the white chocolate was missing. the waffles tasted good enough this time but chocolate unavailability at a waffle shop should be mentioned in block letters outside the gate , cannot be pardoned easily.

It is located bang opposite Fabricca della pizzeria. One has to take the lane that runs opposite to Forum mall,a little walk would bring one to this cute place serving the best waffles.
The place is a tad bit small,but cute nonetheless with waffle posters on the walls and yellow themed decor.

Ordered the most recommended: Chocolate Overload and what a treat it was.

A place where you get variety of waffles which do not disappoint your taste buds. A small place but service is really fast and the staffs are really courteous. Tried few of the waffles like chocolate overloaded, blueberry cheesecake, vanilla ice cream waffle,etc, which are all equally tasty. Definitely a great place to visit for one's waffle cravings. A must visit for waffle lovers. ü§òüëå

Take-away waffles are lip smacking. Good concept where the traditional way of eating has been replaced by a handy option. Tried blueberry cream cheese waffle and it tasted superb. 
Once you place your order you have to wait for a few minutes but fresh waffles from the oven prepared in front of your eyes justify the concept and make the wait worth it.
Kudos!

Lets gets this straight, a cool and comfy place where you can come and have some delicious waffles. I ordered Red Velvet Waffles,Naked Nutella, Blueberry Cheesecake. All the waffles are too delicious but red velvet is the best. The place is neat tidy you will love it for sure. Waffles are pancakes with absü§£ü§£üëåüëå. Do visit you wont be disappointed.

We need to remember what's important in life: friends, waffles, work. Or waffles, friends, work. Doesn't matter, but work is third.üòçüòçüòá‚úåüòéüòÑüòÇ

We went to this place today. The staff was very helpful and guided us through the menu. We ordered the chocolate overload. The waffle was awesome, it was crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside, the milk chocolate filling was also very good. The service was ok as they took a long time to give us the order but otherwise the ambience of this place was very nice and we could see the chefs make the waffles. Overall this place is perfect if you want to taste some good waffles.

Lip smacking good. As aptly said - the batter does matter. Walked in after a heavy lunch for a quick bite. Took an ice cream waffle (dark) and then went again for an overload chocolate waffle (dark). Amazing waffles and the toppings. Current favourite dessert place. Must visit.

Tried their coffee waffle (dark) which was average and salted caramel shake which was also average. 

Didn't like their blueberry waffle.
