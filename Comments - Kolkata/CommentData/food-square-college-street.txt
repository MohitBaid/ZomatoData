The fried momo was awesome...
Try some of them...
And it is good to have the service as it is good ..
The decor is also very good ...
Modern thinking of showcasing the restaurant...

I can sum up review in just three words. It may sound harsh, but "NEVER GO THERE".
I went there with my 3 friends. We ordered 2 chicken momo, 1 chicken burger and 1 veg sandwich. And I can say that we have wasted our money. They served 4 pieces of momo and some french fries. I think they had less momos, that's why they have served the french fries too. The chili ketchup was so hot that I can't explain. It was just too much. The momos were also not that good in taste, and the stuffing of chicken was also less. We had to search for chicken. We went there to eat something because we were too hungry, but we made ourselves more hungry by paying them money.

The lassi is quite good.. If u dont find a seat at Coffee House or Paramount, then you can visit here. Pocket friendly and good snacks are found.
