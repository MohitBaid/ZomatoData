Value for money. The quality and quantity is good. We actually ordered for a home delivery using the number given in Zomato- the delivery was completed in 40 minutes, despite the 30 minute ride.
We ordered for the classic chicken, schezwan steam and mandarin fish pan fried momos and fish fillet with chips. The fish fillet could not be completed so they delivered he remaining 3. Yet we were happy with what we got.
Will keep re-ordering again.

Good and standard Momos. Place is very scarce otherwise food quality is very good. I took the basic steam chicken Momos and sprill roll and both were up to d mark.

Food is good. But the ambience is not up to the mark. I had steamed cheese chicken momo. Which was very basic nothing great it costed me 114 bucks which wasn't up to the mark. The sauces served with the momo were good. Do not highly recommend this place but can give a try if really hungry :)

Momos are good. Price is also reasonable. But, a big BUT, I ordered Steam Chicken Momos. They were cold. The whole idea of having momo is to have them hot.

Worst momo you could ever have. The chicken inside the momo had a really bad smell as if old chicken had been served. The price is way too high for some shitty momo.

Worst momo ever had in my entire life, thought of having pan fried momo , i went there took 6 pcs of shwezuan flavoured , told them that i want it to be spicy, may be the coold they hired are really untrained, they packed the food and when we started having it was not at all a shwezuan sauce, rather it was a tomato based sauce with extremely sour in taste, will never go back to this place

Food was good.The schezwan pan fried momo was not very spicy but a bit tangy.
The steamed momos were good too. 
The pocket pinch is not so much so overall a nice place.

Quaint little momo joint in Behala Manton. The ambience is young and vibrant. The quality is better than the more popular Wow Momo. Especially their sauce is nice. Fillings are soft and crust is not soggy. The pocket friendly price range makes it a great choice for evening snack or take away. I say, way to go Momore!!!

It's a new momo joint located quite near to Manton supermarket. The seating is absurd. They have around four plastic chairs to sit in and if the chairs are preoccupied then we need to stand. Its an open place so the people walking on the street can stare at you while you're eating and it is quite uncomfortable. I had ordered pan fried schezwan momos. The momos were tasty and the schezwan sauce had a nice kink of heat which I loved. This place is more suitable for ordering.

The momos are Nice. Quite a lot in quantity considering the price. We ordered the Schezwan Chicken Steamed Momo & the filling had a great blend of Just the right amount of ginger, spices & evenly minced chicken.
Will certainly go back to try their amazing Combos & Satays.

The location was easy to find, just across the Manton bus stop. Staffs were quite good and as well as the service was pretty fast. Tried "Pan Fried Veggie delight, Corn Spring Onion, Spring roll". Food was really good and the prices were reasonable. Any Momo lovers hitting that region must try out.

Momore is a newly opened joint for Tibetan dishes especially for Momo lovers.

They serve a wide variety of momo, like Wow Momo.

This outlet is located at Behala.

Service is quick with decent staffs.

Tried Cottage Cheese momo, which was very delicious and fresh. A must try.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

A relatively new Momo-joint in d city. I have tried its Corn Spring onion momo and Cheesy chicken momo(both steamed & pan fried). Both the versions are equally tasty.However d pan fried ones are very spicy & tangy.The sauce provided along with d momos is too tangy.Pricing has been done including taxes. Overall:Good VALUE FOR MONEY.

I have tried their momos earlier also at their axis mall outlet..and was greatly satisfied with the taste as well as the pocket pinch. So I was very excited when I came to know about this oultet in my area. And I must tell, they are indeed a good joint for all the momo-lovers. Yesterday I had their Mandarin fish momo(6 pc) and cottage cheese momo (10 pc) for only 227 bucks! And this time also it tasted great as usual.. with their signature sauces..So I recommend this place to those who wanna take a break from Wow-momo! Surely they will be facing a tough competition.

Too costly.. 
Food tastes good, but paying 90 bucks (69+ tax) for a plate of 6 momos, is too much !! 
No idea about the other food items.. price has to be reduced in order to compete in the market...
