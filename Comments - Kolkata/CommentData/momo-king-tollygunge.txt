This is the 'parar Chinese dokan' of Surya Nagar area. My office is situated here so whenever hunger pangs hit the team while brainstorming Momo King is our saviour because of their smooth process of home delivery and their low prices.
We had mostly had snacks like momos from this place but today we ordered lunch for three.
We had placed the order for a veg fried rice, a mixed noodles and garlic chicken. They misheard us or were just plain careless and delivered veg noodles in place of the veg rice. We were really hungry by then and in no mood to call the place to complain. But, we really hope such glitches do not happen further.
All said and done the food is definitely a notch higher than your average 'para'r Chinese' and seems to be cooked in a hygienic environment. 
I absolutely loved the lightness of the gravy in garlic chicken and the robust flavours of the veggies and chicken, egg and prawn in the noodles.
A place one should definitely try.

It's a take away food joint. Newly opened at Netajinagar. I tried chicken steamed & pan fried momo & mixed fried rice. Taste is good & pocket friendly food joint...
