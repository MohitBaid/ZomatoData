I'd say they give a good quantity of every dish you order. Don't go for the Indian dishes there,  I personally didn't like it and half of the time it's not available even. As the name suggests, you'll really have good Chinese food there. Service is pretty good. Taking about the ambience, it's okay, not too great.

Indulging in fancy dining experiences...as much as that is lucrative, we all at times get restricted by our budgets and during those crunched-pocket days, we need to find ourselves generic eateries which fulfils the hotchpotch desire of 'filling the tummy with some restaurant food'. China Town is one such place which will be a default takeout joint for residents nearby but we took something on our way back to home(Behala). This is a little joint serving Bengali versions of popular Chinese dishes.

We took China Town Spl. Fried Rice and Hot Garlic Chicken. The ample amount did satiate the hungry bellies but the souls weren't touched at all. With undercooked prawns and sprinkling of black pepper that didn't coalesce with the dish, it left a feeling of mediocrity...not one that can be appreciated. The side dish was bland, although having soft chicken pieces without excessive usage of coating. The gravy had a taste of underseasoned vegetable stock, which diluted the heat and the garlicky punch we were anticipating.

This was overall a disappointing experience but at least, the quantity was commendable.

Chinese food always rings a few unusual bells in my head – unusual to most Indians except for those who have traveled to China, lived there or stayed there for some time. I freak out on food every time I am in a Chinese eatery. The food that is served in most places in India as ‘Chinese’ are versions that the Chinese nationals would be shocked to know about. So I will refer to the authentic version as ‘authentic’ & the "Bengalified" version as ‘Bengese’.

Enough beating around the bushes. Let's cut to the chase. This Chinese joint falls on the latter type (Bengese). A very average food joint, serving equally average 'chini' fare (All Bengalis would understand that). Yesterday we dropped off at their Tollygunge branch. We were in a bit of a hurry, so we opted for take-out. We ordered two plates of Chinatown special mixed rice along with a dish of Hot-Garlic Chicken. A very cliche' combo I know. But pocket crunches make people do unusual things! 

The Special Mixed Rice was too generic (nothing special about it). The quantity was ample though. As per quality, it was fine. What didn't struck the right chords is the Hot-Garlic Chicken. It tasted bland. Void of anything "Chinese" about it. To be honest, I won't be visiting this place for second time.

This restaurant is surprisingly better than its other two outlets. The service was quick and the amount of food was applaudable. The Chilli Pork was succulent and well cooked. The noodles were crisp and in enough amount to feed two people. The pepper chicken and red chicken curry were perfectly tasty and fresh. It was a quite good experience, a good place to run and catch a quick lunch in case you've skipped a meal.

This particular outlet of China Town near Tollygunge metro has evolved more as a roll joint than a dine-out place.. Awesome food and awesome staff make this place an ultimate destination for foodies of Tollygunge area..I bet there is no one who has not checked in China Town residing in Tollygunge..Rolls are seriously awesome as well as the entire menu..A must try...

On the tram depot crossing in tollygunge, china town for me is sort of a last resort place. Being on such a busy street and knowing the unavailability of many options in the locality, they fell short of capturing the market.
I had ordered veg hakka noodles and manchurian. The food was edible but a value for the money spent. Quality of service was pathetic on a regular day with minimal crowd. Food took ages to come without any sort of presentation considering the amount of money they charge from the customers. The seating on the other hand was standard and we could somehow make ourselves comfortable there.
Not a place to visit if you want to eat out. Rather keep it as a last resort if you are in the locality and craving for chinese food.

We went to this Outlet few days ago for our dinner. Located just on the left side of Tollygunge More beside the famous Manti Restaurant towards road for Garia side, this is actually a small food joint concentrating only on Chinese Cuisine. The outlet has an air-conditioned dine-in facility with a small cabin like interior which was nevertheless quite good to hangout. They have a huge variations and quite a lot of options in their Menu for which the Chinese Foodies can surely have a lookout. We ordered Chicken Fried Momo, Mixed Gravy Noodles and Chicken Gravy Noodles. The Ambience is okayish and the staffs were ordinary. Nothing professional though to be honest. The food came in within a few minutes and was served fast by the waiter. Talking about the quantity, I would say that it's more than enough for a single person and worth pricing truly. Coming to the taste, The Gravy Noodles were Seriously one of the best noodles that I have ever taste and came across till date. In one word, I would say perfect. The gravy was neither too slothy nor too dry but just perfect to be craved for mixing with the noodles that was simply superb in taste. Their noodles are a bit thicker types but believe me it will not disappoint you honestly. The amount of chicken, egg, broccoli, mushrooms and vegetables that they mixed with the noodles was surely a taste Vitalizer. Now coming to the Fried Momos, This is was indeed not at all satisfactory in terms of taste and inner fillings. I thought they were also expert in Momos but seriously, it went down in the taste. Not a bit too oily but neither a bit too dry, the taste was no upto the satisfaction. Quantity is as usual more than enough but they need to change the taste of Momo fillings to have satisfied the Chinese Cuisine Freaks. Overall the experience was good but could have been much better had the Momos were perfect. Anyway, I would definitely suggest everyone to visit and check out this small outlet in Tollygunge..!! :-)Upasana

This was a branch at Gariahat we went to, we ordered a Thai styled chowmein and chilli baby corn. We were warned that the Thai style noodles would be spicy but as we've had Thai before we expected it to have the normal spice it usually does, unfortunately this was volcanic we struggled to eat even half the portion that was served to us. The taste though was great! And I'm sure I would have given a good review had I eaten something else. Baby corn was good.

This place, in my opinion, is perfect for takeaways and deliveries. They have a seating arrangement on their mezzanine floor, and you have to go up a narrow and steep flight of stairs to get there. The ambiance is not anything to boast of. The waiters are courteous and will help you to provide a description of the items on the menu, if need be.

Coming to the food, I find it to be one of the best in Tollygunj area. They match their quality with quantity. The chicken drumsticks, the chilli chicken, the schezwan chicken, the fried rice, the chowmein - all are delectable. I am particularly fond of the drumsticks. The fried rice is actually very mildly flavoured, which is a big plus for me, as it means that you can eat a lot of it, and it pairs well with something spicy like Schezwan chicken.

All in all, it's a place that serves good food.

Ambiance: 3/5

Horrible delivery service. After giving a perfect address with all details of the gated complex we live in, the delivery boy left without delivering as I did not pick up the call once,@ agreed that it was my mistake but he did not care to call back the second time. On calling the food was delivered more than 60 mins after placing the order and then to my surprise the order turns out to be complete incorrect and that to non-vegetarian when I am a total vegetarian. 
The situation was quite bad when after 30 mins of argument a refund was made and the owner who claims to be a respectable footballer of supposedly the Indian team never offered to agree that it was a mistake.
Talking to the delivery boy I understood that he was sent the incorrect ordered on WhatsApp from the company guys who look after Zomato orders. 
I request Zomato to please choose your vendors properly and try to keep a quality control mechanism. 

Horrible service and moreover I will have to sleep empty stomach tonight. So much for Garlic Noodles and Chilli Paneer.

Loved their fried chilli chicken. Just disappointed with their service since they forgot to include eggs in our biryani despite deducting the price for it. We ordered 4 biryanis and two chicken sides. Minus 1.5 coz of forgetting the egg because that's a crime when it comes to biryani.

It is just located opposite to the petrol pump of tollygunge. Not very spacious and the sitting arrangement is above the kitchen that one can see from outside. Though the staff for the upstairs is only one but the service is very prompt. Tasted only Chinese and the food was really good. The only drawback is if you order a bit off bit dishes then either they are not available or they will pretty long time to get prepared. Overall will recommend to everyone if you are looking for good Chinese with a average price and will visit again.

To start with, the restaurant probably deserves a better rating than 2.5. Now the reason for rating it so is that I am left with not much of a choice. We wanted to taste the chinese obviously seeing the name. However, they were unable to serve most of the dishes. Meifoon wasnt ready to be had for a long time, some of the chicken sides as well were added to this list. We asked for kebabs and none of them was available. Since we were running short on time, we were literally forced to try the chicken biriyani. The biriyani is probably the lightest I have ever had in my entire lifetime. I must say it smelled pretty good when it came, the aroma was well mixed with the food, the rice was well textured and there was very very little oil, almost negligible. The ingredients were properly cooked, even the potato had been cooked properly. Overall presentation was good. However, such a light biriyani can almost be mistaken to be plain rice with some aroma. I am not saying it was bad, but probably my tastebuds like a bit more of punch. I would like to try the chinese here and update my ratings. For now, based on the Biriyani, this is it

This is a small joint near tollygunge tram depot. Good food at affordable rates. My all time favorite is chilli chicken dry. I have visited this place many times and almost each time it was in my order list. They can never disappoint you with this one. Perfectly soft, juicy and chunky pieces of chickn. On my last visit I tried the china town special mixed fried which turned out to be exceptionally good. The quantity can serve two average eaters easily. It had baby corns,all veggies,fresh prawns and chckn pieces,medium spicy and was decked up wth prawn papad and fried egg. It does not require a side dish. Their pan fried momos and chicken drumsticks are equally great and must be tried. They serve biryani as well but I would go for their chinese only.
The only problm wth this outlet is most of the favorite starters get finished too early. They need to make those dishes in sufficient quantity keeping the high demand in mind. Cards are accepted. Waiters are friendly.

If one overlooks the serious lack of space, one would be tempted to visit the place again. Mainly a takeaway, it has a tiny air-conditioned seating area upstairs. The only staff was quite attentive and the food was served pretty quick. We only had two starters and we were full. The mushroom preparations are delectable here and the crispy fried chicken tangy and fun. Overall a decent experience. Wish it was more spacious!

Believe me,  the food is great and the quantity is greater.

Service is bad here. And food taste is also not good. For me I had ordered prawn chilly and they delivered paneer instead. And delivery time was 2 hours late than promised time. And cost is also not worth.

Tiny place, situated absolutely in the heart of tollygunge area. It is has 2 (or should I say 1.5?) Floors. The ground floor is where there's a counter for delivery, take away etc. They make really good rolls. The 1st floor if I can call it that is a ridiculously tiny place for dining. The food however is quite decent. I love their chicken drumstick, schezwan noodles and dragon chicken. However I've heard their Indian is decent barring the biriyani. (relying on my Indian cuisine obsessed friend's input) Haven't had any delivery experience yet so can't comment. If only the dining area could somehow be made bigger then this place would have been an even bigger hit.

Never ever go for this place even if you're dying of hunger and all other outlets are Off. Stay hungry or have something at your own house. But never visit here. Biriyani they served was awful. My friend ordered chinese dishes which were equally awful. Morever the ambience doesn't suit for a perfect dining experience, with rude staffs in service

I like this restaurant. This is the smaller outlet, located at Tolly crossing. Even though the space is too crammed up for comfort, still it's not as bad as it may be look from the outset. Food quality is quite good. They make their Chinese items right. Availability of Biryani at times is problematic. Rates are okay when compared to the quantity and quantity served. Chilly Chicken Dry and Garlic Chicken are the latest dishes I tried, and I loved both. Brilliantly spiced, soft, good chicken pieces. 8 pieces per plate. Service needs to be better though. Would not be a bad choice for spending some casual time with a small group of friends or your partner, specially during the month end.

Packed dinner - 2 chicken fried rice with 1 chilli chicken. The quantity of the fried rice was really good as per the price. But tge the taste is extremely ordinary. The chilli chicken was not at all tasty, it was tasting like some Indian dish. Maybe as they make both Chinese & Indian dishes the tastes get altered sometimes, God knows. The only point for which the restaurant is good is for the good quantity. But the taste is very ordinary.

A popular chinese outlet, known for massive quantity and good food. I had never visited the restaurant thus have no idea about service and sitting capacity. I once ordered from the tollygunge outlet. The mixed Hakka noodles was good though a bit oily. The chilli chicken was rather ordinary. All in all an okayish  experience

On a hot humid afternoon when you are hungry, Chinese can possibly be the only calling to keep you light and energetic. Especially when you atr nearing tollygunje metro station, China town seems to be evidently one of the preferred options.

Location : travel to tollygunje metro ( mahanayak uttam kumar) . Cross the road to find a petrol pump. Just opposite to the petrol pump stands China Town

Decor : this is a very basic restro that you could have a casual lunch in. Decor as such is very simplistic. The restro is located in the mezannaine. On entering the you can see a lot of yellow and red. Red bricks lines by yellow walls. It is a very small space. The place has just 6 four seaters.

Ambience : from what i feel about the ambience is it is very stuffy and congested. The whole concept of a dimly lit chinese joint is marred. Nothing to symbolise the cuisine it serves. It is a very bad idea if you go on a casual date as everything is quite clearly heard in the next table even if its a murmur.

Staffs: the staffs are quite well versed and suggestive. They will suggest you whatever you feel like eating. Although I felt,the staff is quite imposing at times, they will insist you to take more but in a very courteous way.

Food: the food in one word is amazing. Since I went in to have lunch all alone, I could gobble a lot of food. So the order was very less.

1. Chilli chicken dry - the dry chilli chicken has the authentic Chinese taste that it ought have. The bell peppers and chillies in the right proportion further added to the amazement. The taste persisted. The portion was good enough for two people.

2. Steamed chicken momo- however the momos were a surprise package. O would prefer these momos to the momos served by tibetan joints. It was wholesome, stuffed with chicken, the sizes were quite large, the momo was succulent and melted in the mouth. There were 8 pieces in a plate. The portion is enough to serve two peole. The vegetable clear soup that accompanied the momos also tasted amazing. I would definitely suggest people to try this for sure.

Value for money: the prices are decent according to the quality authentic food that they serve.

Definitely a great option for people deciding to have chinese for lunch in and around tollygunje metro. I am going back again to taste their noodles. But definitely a thumbs up from my side.

4.  Packaging and delivery - 3.5/5 - well better than many of the recent encounters but this one was dusty too....

It's located just near the tolly metro so the location is pretty good. I have been here a couple of times and ordered the spicy pan fried momo, chicken clear soup, sweet corn soup, mixed fried rice and garlic chicken . The potions were very good. The momo was very spicy and tangy, the soups were so-so, the rice was high on quantity and the chicken was yummy. Overall an OK place and affordable as well.

Very nice place, located exactly opposite to tollygunge metro station . Less time  and no mood to walk much after getting down from metro this is the perfect place with almost right amount of choices in the menu. I came here 2 to 3 times but the latest time I ordered 
Vegetable hot and sour soup with pepper mushroom and 1 chicken drumstick. Soup was nice with the right amount of hotness  (it was kinda spicy ) and mushroom pepper also tasted nice. Thaugh I dint taste the chicken drumstick as I was vegetarian that day but my friend said it's spicy and juicy. That sounds surely nice. 1 disadvantage is its space , it's very congested but thanks for the ac.

This place is very close to my home and it used to be a roll counter previously. It is opposite to the Tollygunge petrol pump. Food is not bad but the ambience isn't quite appealing. Prices are cheap and they provide in generous quantity so its favourable for a casual hangout with friends. However for large family dinners, this place might seem a bit claustrophobic.

It used to be "roll take advantage" for me..Never dined in here before last Tuesday.
It was a take away, but obvious reason was, I always feel the upstairs where they serve the food for dinning is less spacious. And 2ndly it was my parents 29th anniversary. 30th will be large. But was small, last 16th. Ohk
Coming back to food..
I ordered 2rices and 2 chickens and hence it was a request from Miss T for a Schezwan Chicken.
2 chicken dishes were , Lemon chicken and Chicken and Mushrooms with White Sauce.
2 rices were China town special fried rice and Sanghai Fried rice(a li'l yellowish in color).
Honestly I didn't expect it to be that good. Every single dish was just nice and warm.
As it was main course and I was expecting a bit less flavours from them.
Lemon chicken was just lickable dish and it was bitterly and savoury dish, flawless execution of lemon soup.
Chicken and Mushrooms with White Sauce was just good.
If I consider the rices,then China town special has something mouthwatering which Sanghai Fried rice lacked. But yellow rice is also tasty.
Miss T thanked me for Schezwan Chicken. It was nice for her.
C a.

This is very small restaurant in tollygunge...not in a very considerable distance from the metro station. We were walking past this place when suddenly we encountered it. We were a bit apprehensive of the seating arrangements considering their outlook...after hesitating a bit we finally decided to drop in.
The first impression was really very poor since the second we entered we were almost suffocated due to the smoke in their kitchen...we had to walk in through the kitchen from where stairs lead to the dining area. They apologised for the inconvenience caused and we learned that they had a problem with their exhaust fan which was the reason for the disturbance caused. They were kind enough to come running to hold open the door to their dining area for me noticing the problem i was facing.
The narrow stairs lead to a small eatery..during that hour the place was almost empty and we noticed only 1 couple seated. As we were really late we didn't have much time to scan through the menu card...we asked the waiter which item would be available within a short span of time and he recommended us to opt for chicken noodles. Placing our order we looked around a bit. The place is small but well maintained...an air conditioner placed for comforting the customers...the whole place has a lime yellow tinge to it..and small tables and chairs were all matched with the yellow colour. Small dim lights not too bright lighted the place up which was a pretty good touch to the yellow background.
The noodles arrived fast as was said. The quantity was enough for the 2 of us. As we didn't have much time we gulped the whole thing down within 10mins. The noodles were made nicely though i felt that it had more salt in it which ruined its taste to a certain extent. But the other things in it along with the big chunks of chicken made up for the small disaster.
1 noticeable thing about this place was the behaviour of the staff. The staff here were really very helpful and attended us with a smile whenever we called them...they even tried to make conversation with us. When we were leaving the manager apologized again for the inconvenience in their restaurant leading path. Well,having checked out only one dish here and the extra salt they put in there i would have given it a 3..but the staff behaviour really made up for it and hence this place definitely deserves a 4! Am eagerly waiting for my next visit here...and i would surely like to try some more of their items.

Infrastructure:
The space inside the restaurant is very less and it is quite compact.
They have the AC but sometime it not run.

Food:
I have tasted almost all the dishes in this restaurant as i live in this area .
Mostly the briyani of this restaurant is good.also you can try some hakka noddles.
Quantity :The quantity that they will offer you that will be enough to enjoy one person.
Quality : From 5 i can rate 2.5 .

==LOCATION==

Yet another China Town.. This name is getting so confusing lately as till now i heard of this name in almost every area in Kolkata starting from New Market To EM Bypass but are not managed by the same person.. So this outlet is situated opposite of Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro Station ticket Counter beside the Tollygaunge Tram Depo..

Nothing too fancy about this place,just a simple Chinese Restaurant.. A small passage which was half occupied by the kitchen will lead you upstairs into an Air-Conditioned room where you can enjoy your lunch or dinner or etc.. There was a problem with their exhaust fan in the kitchen so the whole place was covered with smoke and they did apologize us a lot for that inconvenience and one of the cook did hold the door for us which was really a good sign..

It was already the 21st hour of the day and we had very little time to go through the entire menu and then start with starters and side dish as well..

So we opted or a single plate of Mix Fried Rice,but the waiter did inform us to order a plate of Noodles over Rice as we were in a hurry.. It took them exactly 5-7 minutes to bring us a plate of Mix Noodles and less than 10 minutes to gulp down the entire plate ..

==QUALITY AND QUANTITY==

Now coming to the quality and quantity.. Quantity was enough for a couple to enjoy and Quality was also good.They served us Hakka Noodles which you know is different from normal noodles and a bit heavy also.. Overall it was nicely prepared nothing to fancy to go in details.

==BEHAVIOR OF STAFFS==   

A special mention to the staffs over this place as they were cooperative and were gentle enough to cater you..

This place is a tax free zone also..

==AMBIENCE==

The ambiance was also nothing fancy a small room painted in lime yellow and 4 tables with chairs of 4. But they do have A.C which is always great.

Overall a nice experience at this place and i would try to give this place another visit to try some of their starters as well..

Well I chose this restaurant the other day apparently because I didnt find any other eat out in the tollygunge karumamoyee area.. Food quality is satisfactory and the quantity is enough.. There are some areas that can be improved like the Chinese dishes don't have the consistency in their taste.. But regardless it's not a bad choice when you are out of options..

This a local restaurant which serve decently tasty chinese foods with nominal prize range.I must say my dinning experience with them was pretty good.I ordered both indian n chinese in which I like the favour of chinese dishes. Talking about the ambience of the place it was spacious with limited list of songs which is sometimes boring when you go for an elaborate meal. So this place is truly value for money.

Have been to this place a million no of times but the place never disappoints. The best dish to be had is chicken drumstick. Its too spicy and too tasty.

Though the menu is quite limited by the chinese is fine.

The major problems being that they dont generally stock cold drink and THEY DONT ACCEPT CARDS.

The place is too congested and the ambiance a bit shady but the quality of food makes up for it.

Location is good, presentation is poor, price reasonable but tastes good.

The first strikes my mind is d chicken bharta. I looked for moreover the same taste of each n every restaurant where it is available, but disappointment grabbed me. Unfortunately moghlai items r not now available in this outlet. But if one would search for chicken drumstick n crispy chicken they will definately like it.

It was really less crowded for a restaurant on a christmas day, in fact it was totally empty. It didn't have much space. The celling was low also. We ordered singapur,hong kong and schezwan fried rice and schezwan prawn and sanghai chicken. The rice was okay, prawn wasn't that good, chicken was okay! The food overall average! But compared to the price it was decent! All these costs us ₹860.
So if you are looking to eat some decent Chinese at reasonable cost this is the place for you.

As we were on a go to discover new restaurants in the area, we tried this one once on a hot summer afternoon. The upstairs sitting place (no sitting arrangement downstairs) is a small one, with closely placed tables, but the AC was chilling indeed. We have ordered some regular chinese items like Fried Rice and Chicken side dishes, they were to our surprise pretty good! Quantity is also decent. After that we have made 4 times repeat to this place, trying the Chicken side dishes and meifoon, and chowmins. Trust me, they are quite good. Price is also reasonable, no tax.

Please check your quality of rice in Singapore fried rice...it stinks...Chicken in side dishes should be cooked a tad more to avoid tenderness (it feels like raw")...

Having a quick roll at the heart of Tollygaunge is limited to Manti, China Town and the road side stalls. Initially I preferred China Town mainly to avoid the queue of Manti, which back then was very famous. Gradually I started liking it and now it became my preferred destination to grab the egg chicken roll. 

I only tasted egg chicken kabab roll since this is the only item that I ordered in my last 10 visits. It's not that oily and contains ample amount of chicken. The good thing is that the staff always ask you the add-ons, which lets you choose what you want to go into the roll. Do ask for lemon explicitly as it isn't part of their normal recipe. I always kind of like this roll - tasty and heavy, a perfect way to  fill your rumbling stomach temporarily. 

The outlet also has a seating arrangement as well but I personally feel a little claustrophobic inside. It's almost like Saima at rabindra sadan

Ditched by Manti...got an excuse to visit China Town on the same lane... :p  As the name suggests they really serve lip smacking chinese items... Not very spacious but definitely cozy environment... Being little bit hungry ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Hot Garlic Chicken... The rice was nicely done and the chicken they served was literally piping hot and it tasted yummmm.... Both the dishes were complimenting each other beautifully....Quantity is good...One can share it well for a small treat... One can surely try this restro once....

The food is really nice in here. I will suggest people to take away to their home. The receptionist are very prompt, and serves quite fast. The food in here is very affordable. This is best in class value service. Home delivery are fast. People are kind, and well behavioral. The only problem is the restaurant itself. It is unfit to sit and eat there. The restaurant is poorly Air conditioned, unhygienic, and very cluttered. Space is small, and noisy. Under-lit. that's why I deducted 2 points off charts. The food is very delicious, so if you don't mind taking the food home, then it is for you. The special noodles, is the most recommended dish. So try it out guys, and of course for take away or Home delivery.

It is located just opposite to the tollygunge petrol  pump. Its a small counter but they have still managed to fit in a 16 seater AC cabin.

Have been there twice and tried my all time favorite biriyani which was average but was not disappointed, may be my expectation was not that high. I also tried mutton kassa and laccha paratha which was very good. Mutton was soft, spicy and flavorful. 

Definitely a good place for a quick bite.

Am quite regular at this dine out,not on daily but on weekly basis and not for it's delicious food but for the dearth of good eating joints here,close to Tollygunje Metro,ofcourse am excluding Munty's...To say the least,don't you dare go to China Town until and unless you are habituated with crazy air conditioners that fluctuate its temperature itself higher or lower anytime or stop functioning suddenly,or if you are ready to bang your head accidentally at the low roof a couple of times,or if you want to just eat the food in your dream that takes forever to arrive at your table!!And the place is so narrow and the attendant is so meek and mild in his hushed voice,I'll not blame you if you feel like "Gosh!Where the Hell am I!!"

It would be very unfair if i don't review this place because i have visited this place many times. They have two branches one near siriti more and the other near the uttam kumar metro. The restaurant near sirti more is bigger than the one near metro. But i generally go to the outlet near metro. The place is small bt properly decorated. You can't complain about ambiance at this price. Coming to the main part that is the food i have to say they are simply great. I have tried a lot of dishes here and each one of them is equally good. For a suggestion try the dry chilli chicken,lemon chicken,ginger chicken. But the other dishes are also very good. I liked the hot and sweet soup very much. Overall the place gives you a very nice eating experience.4.5 stars for this place.

They have a branch on B L Saha Road, close to South City Garden. They generally run on the home delivery services. The service is worst and will put you down any moment. At least three times caused me embarrassment because of the poorest services. 
Choose not to order, because HATARI or Chowman and few more are giving very good services. This is a typical Mahabirtala shop with Dada type attitude. 

I dare not think about the quality of food etc....when the service which is the showcase is so poor. 

Enjoy food but not here.

Been to China Town, mezzanine floor,  for a quick lunch today! 
Ordered for Peper Chicken, and Drums of heaven in starters!
Peper was really tasty..must say..and drums of chikn was as usual lipsmacking..very spicy and hot!
In the main course..I ordered for HongKong noodles..and schezuan fish! Noodles and fish both dissapointed a bit..they tasted like Kolkata Chinese..too much spicy..and oily!
Starters are alwas gud in China town..so those are recommanded for evening snacks or for starters!

This place is located bang on the long store front straddling the crossing of Tollygunge Tram Depot. Serves a typical continental menu along with elements from Punjabi cuisine. 1 of the many medium range takeaway joints in the city. They've however added a seating area just upstairs which will be a tad bit too small for you if you're over the age of 3. It's pretty freaking small. Doesn't much help that they've crammed as many tables as possible. 
The food tastes nice. The nuns were succulent and the tandoori roti was larger than usual. Chicken dishes are however very small in portion. Service was in a whole new level. We asked for a Chicken Bharta to be packed. Came home and saw that we got served Chicken Tandoor Butter Masala. They were courteous enough to waive the extra cost thus incurred though. :p
A positive for this place would be that thay stay open till late at night.

Chakraborty Tip : Nothing other than the name suggests Chinese-ness.
