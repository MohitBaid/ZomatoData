This outlet is located near Mukunda Bhaban, Mukundapur and certainty the best place to have food at Mukundapur.
This mainly is a street food stall and do not expect anything more from them. They don't provide any kind of seating too. Even though it is just a street food joint, they maintain cleanliness.
They serve Momos, Rolls, Biryani, Pakodas and regular Chinese foods. Momos are actually pretty good and their noodles are very good, comparing with the price. Biryani, that they serve is below average.
As a street food joint I like what they serve and will recommend this placeif you are at Mukundapur.

It's a street food junction and the best in mukundupur area. Rolls are better here then any other shops in this area else you try their moghlai which is not bad actually. Few days ago they started to serve momo which is also good. In case of biriyani this shop is like the other shops which means it's below average. Other than these their chicken pakora, drumstick is pretty average. Shop is very clean and staffs are good. Thank you.
