Horrible. One word is enough. It's small but has variety of options and it's cheap. That's it. Otherwise it's an insult to your taste buds. If you have rolls from here after having the roll you'll have a layer of ghee/oil around your mouth. Yeah it's that bad!
It wasn't like this before. But to attract more business their food quality degraded slowly and steadily! :(

We took chicken and veg rolls. Food is good,at par with items from other street-food restaurants. The owner seems to be jovial and customer friendly. Worth a try if you are hungry and looking to eat some quick street food to satiate hunger. 
Note: observed that the restaurant takes more time to prepare food. It would be better for them to server quickly as large percentage of customers would be already hungry at the time they order food.

A run down restaurant very hot with poor quality food and servicing. The only mercy is it's cheap. If you have a hunger for good taste please I humbly request you not waste your time here cause it will not meet any of your tasting criteria.

A good local outlet,and famous too.But it gets reduced when one looks at the hygeine,hospitability,food,ambience or even sone space.It is crumpy,yet the food is mediocre.Pocket friendly rolls is a delicacy,but as usual filled with doses of Vegetable oil and crampy sauces.Its when you are fixed in a traffic,excuse yourself from honking at others at order a good roll for yourself.Cheers!

The place serves more than decent food, dare I say 'total paisa wasool'. I've been eating its food for more than 3 years, and been coming back to it again and again. Yes. there isn't enough seats to dine, but you can always treat it as a takeaway or call for home delivery ( which is what I do).
 Their Seekh Kabab is to die for, the Chicken Bharta, Butter Masala, kassa, Korma are also very good. Even its Chinese dishes are as good as the Indian ones; soups, and other snacks are also worth trying. As a student, I appreciate its low cost (but not low worth) food:)
It sad to see such dismal ratings for this restaurant. This restaurant is much better, yes it isn't as fancy, neither it charges much; but the food is worth the buck. You will not be disappointed.

The khana khazana outlet of manicktala is just beside the Duff Hostel of Scottish Church College where i spent three years of my life during my BSc.So i have a pretty good idea about this place! Â My advice please don't have anything from this outlet which charges exaggerated price for everything.They would make you wait hours for an 'oil dripping' roll! and please don't use the sauces and vinegar they keep on the tables!

Got takeaway food few days back and was surprised to see the quality of food at a reosonable price. The fried rice was good and so was the garlic chicken.The quantity to price ratio also good.Please comment if you  tried something different and tell me how it was.

Horrible food. Very unhygienic. Don't know how to deal with customers. Chicken chilly and fried rice are absolutely pathetic. Roll is OK. Cheap but although that it is a waste of money. After all we give money in exchange of proper food.
