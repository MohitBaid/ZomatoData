This restaurant can be easily located in the Dhakuria Station Road area.

Ambience is OK with dim lights and 35-40 seating capacity.

Service was prompt and the staffs were cooperative.

I tried veg fried rice... Crispy chilly babycorn and pan fried chilli fish(dry) from this place.

Crispy chilly babycorn tasted good...but I think they deep fried it bit more which made them very very crispy ...bit less Fried would taste more perfect. 

Veg fried rice from this place is not at all recommendable (according to my experience)...the rice which they provided, was hard and not well cooked as it was lacking in taste.

Pan fried chilli fish was quite good and the pieces were soft and well prepared... worth a try.

Quantity was OK and quality as well (except the veg fried rice)

Pocket friendly place.

Starter was good.
Rest wasn'r upto the mark.
We ended witg Lime Soda (Sweet),which was really great.
Good thing about them you don't have to pay extra in form tax.

Few years ago this restaurant came up in our locality and I got positive reviews from a neighbor about the quality of food ¬†offered in this restaurant. ¬†On navami night this Durgapuja I went here hoping to have a delicious treat. But I was highly disappointed. I have to say this is the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever come across. The food offered was so less in quantity that I had to order some starters after finishing with the main dishes. I would like to suggest ¬†the people of Dhakuria please don't go to this restaurant and waste your money, we have a hell of a lot of options for sumptuous Chinese food so we are smart enough ¬†to stay away from ¬†this disgusting place......To the restaurant owners I would like to say please don't run a restaurant with the sole intention of making money ¬†by fooling and depriving your customers.

At the region of Dhakuria station it was very hard to believe that we have a restaurant like this with so much of variety in such prices. Went here with one of my good friend for a hangout as she was familiar to this place.
Small but very silent and at a very quite location. Ambiance is decent enough with Coca Cola banners and flexes all over the resto because they are sponsoring them.¬†
Tried few of their dishes starting the things of with the Fresh Lime Soda which was just Wow. Couldn't get better than this at Rs.30/- only. In the starters i had the chicken Pakora which was a disaster, the coating was too much than the chicken. Secondly we had the Crispy baby corn which was quite satisfactory but later after few minutes it got a little difficult to dig my fork in it, but taste wise it was a good pick.¬†
Finally tried the Veg Hakka Noodles which was decent enough but it might do much well with the gravy items.
Note: A very good budgeted place for your small treats or birthday celebration. Prices are very cheap and reasonable with the amount and quality they are providing. Service was good.

While so called best restaurants downfalls in their quality in Puja time, this restaurant is among that few ones who serve equally good food in Puja time.. Visited yesterday, although they took about 15 mins to serve the food but the food was very good, price is exactly according to the food.. Approx 500 bucks for 2 people..
