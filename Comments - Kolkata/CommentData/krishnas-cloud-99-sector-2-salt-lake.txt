Krishnas Cloud 99 is a very unique food outlet and is located near the 7 no. water tank, Salt Lake...This is not essentially a restaurant and may nearly be called as an outlet with provisions, only for home delivery..However, they have a very small waiting/seating area comprising of 2-3 chairs , where you can rest yourself enjoying their delicacies...They serve snacks such as fish fries and momos and also main course items such as chicken/mutton kasha...The striking feature of this outlet is that, they serve pure home made food with zero adulteration..I tried their fish fry, which cost Rs 100 a plate (2 pieces) and to be honest the sizes were so small that I kept fuming at my decision to stop there to satiate my hunger..However, when I had the first bite, dipped in the mustard sauce, my entire notion about the place changed..It was a thin buttery coated fish fry with a solid fresh fish stuffing inside which tasted as delicious as any fish fry I have ever tasted....As the saying goes, "Don't judge a book by the cover" , avoid doing the same in case of Krishnas Cloud 99 and do try their food Â (atleast Fish Fry , as I have personally tasted it and am in a position to recommend it to the fish lovers)...The pricing is indeed high for such an outlet, but when the food served is that delicious, you would scarcely regret..
