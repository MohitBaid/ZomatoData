Good South Indian food at reasonable rate. A few plastic chairs on the pavement make the seating arrangement. I love their dosas. Try the Sada Vada, surely you will like it.

Small, simple place to satisfy your South Indian food craving. Food is tasty and fresh, dosas, vadas, idli's, dhai vada all great. Very friendly owner and the price tag won't empty your wallet as you watch the traffic go by while you  stand or sit on the road side and eat.

A nice, budget South Indian joint. Although there's some rudimentary seating, it's more of a takeaway. Dosas are good, though Sital's does not have Rava Dosa on its menu, alas.

Excellent vadas may be had here, though the idli could do with a little fluffiness. A personal favourite is their Dahi Idli. The dahi is smooth and creamy and the imli chutney is scrumptious.

For a predominantly South Indian joint, the Papri Chaat is amazingly good. Prices are very reasonable. Service is fast. It has my approval.

South Indian food is my favorite and this place is absolutely incredible. Everything on the menu is wonderful and the employees are very friendly. Even though it's on the main road, they always make sure to set up seats for you and bring the food to where you're sitting. Sital's is very affordable. I highly recommend the vadas and dosas. The coconut chutney is amazing! I've been known to come here five or six times in one week. If you like South Indian food you have to check this place out!

Very very affordable, take-away counter type eating joint. No seating arrangement but one can sit on the stool they provide laid out on the footpath right at Nabapally bus-stop. Food is good, ideal for snacks/tiffin. It is named after the elderly gentleman who sits at the counter and is really cordial. He might tell you a thing or two about the history of Kasba :)

A very very small shop, on the edge of the street, Sital's is not impressive to look at.. But the food's good, and that's what matters.. We had plain dosa, masala dosa, uttapam from there, and all of them are quite nice, specially considering their price.. It's really cheap, and with so near our place, would love to try it once or twice again..
Edit: Visited here last week and to my disappointment, the quality of food has deteriorated.. The uttapam was pretty bad, the paper butter plain dosa was okayish, and the masala dosa was the only one dish which maintained standard.. Hugely disappointed and not looking to visit again..
