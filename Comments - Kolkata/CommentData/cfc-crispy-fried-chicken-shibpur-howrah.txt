Have been there for 2 days. And ordered food online too. Ordered Crispy Chicken, Chicken wangton and ordered chilli chicken for home delivery. Crispy chicken tastes exact same as KFC. It was delicious. And their service was very good. They offered us one piece extra coz one piece in the plate was comparatively small.  Chicken wangton was good. So was Chilli Chicken. But they served 10 piece in one plate. Best part is they serve all food very fresh That was quite good. Place is very well decorated. Staffs are really very friendly and we'll behaved. Will visit again and again.

1st Time Order: Chicken drumsticks
Food & Taste: The pieces and quantity was quite good. Although it's not completely dry, had little gravy. The chicken were cooked little hard. It is also too hot and spicy. Best if eaten with roti.
2nd Time Order: chilli butter mushrooms
Food & Taste: As before it was super spicy, one couldn't really get the taste of mushroom as the chilli was dominating. We asked them to make it less spicy yet they made it extreme spicy.
Delivery: In both times they took more than 15mins from the scheduled time to deliver. The delivery person behavior was rude, he didn't accept his fault of being late. It was the same person who delivered the 1st order. 
From my same experience 2 times, would not suggest this restaurant to anyone....unless if you are ready to face delay, super spicy food and rude staff.

This restaurant really need to take care on its management system. I have had ordered twice from this restaurant, 1st time i ordered egg chowmein and 2nd time i ordered 2 portions of chicken strips. And in both the time they had exchanged my order with someone else. In the 1st case I had received veg chowmein and next time i got only a single portion of strips.
Coming to the food.
The quantity of the chowmein is enough for two but it was very oily! And taste was okayish;not great.
The chicken strips were indeed very tasty. The chicken was soft and well cooked.

Edit:
My 3rd order: Big chizza pizza (see how big it is). The chicken was soft, but as toppings they provided tomato and onion (round cut or salad cut) and tomato ketchup with chili sauce!!
