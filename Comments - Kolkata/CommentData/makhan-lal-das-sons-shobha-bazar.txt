Been going here since i was a toddler and even now when i live in another city, everytime i visit kolkata i make sure to carry back sweets from Makhan Lal. It's a different experience visiting their manufacturing unit in Notun Bazar and getting freshly wrapped sweets. Simply love the mishti. Value for money & taste üíØ ‚úîÔ∏è

It is a small shop at natun bazar, rabindra sarani. They prepare different types of sandesh like butter scotch sandesh, nolen gurer talsash, monohora, rose sandesh. They are very famous for preparation of sweets for wedding party and other rituals.

One of the legendary sweet shop in the dingy corners of north Kolkata, that has been satisfying the cravings for our sweet tooth for centuries, yes u heard that right....centuries!! üòéüò±

Its little difficult to find the shop, since it is inside the 'notun bazaar' market. Bt once u find it, u will be coming back here again and again.

Now as far as the taste is concerned, their sondhesh has a distinctive coarse texture with no melt-in-the-mouth feel bt trust me, the butterscotch sondesh will leave u in heavenüòç.
Oh yes, they don't have a showcase. don't be surpised to see the sweets arranged in large brass plates in open. And sweets are being made besides. That's the legacy!

Very pocket friendly. Highly recommended!

Sweets in Kolkata are as old as its culture. 
Makhan Lal Das n Sons are carrying their heritage with quality and variety for many decades. One of most renowned sweet shop in Kolkata and pride of North Kolkata. Their sweets are loved by every Bengali and anyone visiting Kolkata cannot leave the city without salivating on the whiff of their sweet aroma, smooth texture and soft chhena. 
The winter season makes sweets even more irresistible. Everywhere people use the secret winter ingredient ‚Äònolen-gur,‚Äô which partially replaces sugar and add a blissful feeling and it tastes best when it's from Makhan Lal

Makhan Lal Das & Sons is located at Shovabazar is one of the oldest sweet shops of Kolkata.

Ambience is ok. 

Staffs were polite.

They have many varieties of sondesh , all are soft and delicious. Chocolate sondesh, choco almond sondesh , nolengur sondesh, icecream sondesh are a must try.

Pocket pinch is reasonable .

This outlet of Makhanlal Das and Sons is located on Rabindra Sarani, near Girish Park. The path from the main road to the shop is kind of congested and dirty. However, one would not be disappointed taking the trouble to visit it.

I am rather surprised at the low rating for this shop as because I rather liked it during the more than one visit. It is one of the oldest shop to continue is yearlong tradition of sweets. The behaviour of the whole unit is touchwood and they will hardly give you any reason for dissatisfaction. They also does home delivery of sweets at the minimum charge possible.

They are known to experiment with sweets and dahi (yogurt). You will find usual sweets along with the special items available at certain part of the year. They never make any syrup sweet preparation but only sandesh and chana misti.

They are particularly famous for Ice Cream Sandesh. However Special Items include Aam Dahi, Strawberry Dahi, Aam Chana Payesh, Gurer Misti (Jaggery Sweet), Cocunut Sweet, Chocolate Sweet, Black Current Sweet.

It is to be noted that they showcase in a thali and many a time preparations such as Ice Cream Sandesh, Special Dahi are not showcased but one needs to ask for the same to be served.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Of course you should.

Qs) What are the must try items?
Ans) Ice Cream Sandesh, Chocolate Sweet along with the Special Items are must try always.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) There are hardly any negative points I can score against them and hence this ratings.

These guys are one of the best in their sweets especially Kolkata's favorite, Sandesh. U can get a wide variety of sandesh with awesome flavours. U have to taste to really appreciate it. Hallmark of north kolkata.
The rating is only based on its sweets.

They have been our family sweet supplier. ¬†Be it a sacred ceremony or marriage ceremony or any get together we bring their karapaak burfi and jol bhora. Even the sweets for offering our gods comes from this shop. Though they are specialized in making karapaak, their chocolate sandesh is too good to miss.

In most of the sweet shops in North Kolkata you are bound to find a few very delicious items. This one is however one of the better ones, who makes very good sandesh.
