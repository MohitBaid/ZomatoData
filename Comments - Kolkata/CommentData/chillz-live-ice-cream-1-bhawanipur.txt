Amazing ice cream rolls with a huge menu
You will not have a shortage of choices to try, thats for sure.
Tried their Banarsi paan ice cream and KitKat Crash
Both were good but the KitKat one was no doubt better.
The owner is very friendly and always greets you with a smile.
One minor let down is that there is no seating.
So the prices could have been a bit lower considering that.

This outlet is located in Bhawanipur, just one crossing away from Exide More. Yesterday, my four friends and I decided to give the trending Ice Cream Rolls a try for the first time.

First and foremost mention will be the owner who is very friendly and aptly guided us, first-timers, throughout the menu to make our choices. Service is fast and live (of course). There's a wide variety to choose from, spread over a reasonable price range. Also, this is a Pure Veg outlet, so everyone can give it a try; though you'll not find marshmallows here, like me.

Coming to the ice cream, we ordered a Minty Dark Chocolate, Dairy Milk Gems and Caffeine^2.
DAIRY MILK GEMS: It consisted of Milk Chocolate, topped with Chocolate Sauce, Chocolate Dust and Dairy Milk Gems. It was soft, but too sweet and chocolatey for me.
CAFFEINE^2: This consisted of Chocolate with a strong hint of Coffee, topped with Chocolate sauce and Choco Chips. The roll wasn't too sweet and the balance between the Chocolate and Coffee was bang-on! It's a very tasted and tested flavour, so definitely can be given a try.
MINTY DARK FANTASY: This will, hands down, be the best of the lot. It consisted of Dark Chocolate with a subtle Mint Flavour which was not overpowering. I had it made on the stiffer side and it tasted good that way. This was topped with Chocolate Dust and Choco Chips. This one is truly recommended for every Chocolate Lover, though try it out with lots of Chocolate Sauce.
The Rolls were well-made and one cup is adequate for two people. But they're a bit too thick. Also, the cream they use is kinda too sweet for my preference.

The total bill amounted to around Rs.350 for five, which is reasonable. This place should definitely be given a try by all the Live Ice Cream lovers out there.

Location- within 500 Miter from Rabindra Sadan metro.Interior-small shop but with so many varieties.if you want ice cream +"ADDA",this place totally disappoints you.staff-staff is kind of "one man army" type but he Handel's all things smoothly.very much coordinating.i thing they must be include their sitting place.it is very much lacking.we sit on a tool in the footpathðŸ˜¥.food quality- within so much variety,we ordered royal banarasi pan and caremal explosion.they prepared the roll in front of u.staff totally maintain the hygiene with wearing gloves while preparing the food.the also used branded ingredients.finally the taste.it give you real mouth watering taste of ice cream.caremal blust is brilliant with lot of caramel + chocolate + crispy taste.royal banarasi pan is different in taste,but good.IF YOU WANT TO TASTE THE REAL TASTE OF ICE CREAM ROLL WITH SO MUCH VARIETY,THIS IS A MUST VISITED PLACE.

Live icecream is the new sensation in town . And I today hopped in to this place in Bhawanipur to try their icecream rolls . 
The owner was happy to help us with the best they had . He suggested us a KitKat Crash Icecream first . The whole process is a treat to watch . The ingredients used are very fresh and that reflects in the taste . The KitKat Crash tasted amazing . Each bite was so tempting . 
We had heard a lot about the Banarasi Paan being their best one , so we tried that next and trust me it's the best I have ever had . The flavours of paan in an icecream was a treat to cherish . 
Would love to try some more flavours very soon . Good work team Chillz .

The ice cream was okay..  But it could have been Better.... Well the chocolate liquid needs to be more thick than the real ones..  Otherwise it was OK...

My first intro to Live Ice cream was here in this small joint... Earlier I was it at some Food Channel but didn't knew that it exists in India sply in my city... One day I was passing by, when their live ice cream board came in my vision.. When I inquired its owner was kind enough to demonstrate and explain all the process of making my ice cream... I ordered Kiwi Ice cream, which was made with original kiwi pcs and concentrate, taste was heavenly... I would like to visit them soon to try some more flavors...

We went to this place today hoping to taste ice cream rolls for the first time and i am pretty sure i will be visiting this place again soon.. ice cream rolls are the in thing now and if you want to taste a variety of flavors, this is the place to go. The price is not much compared to some other ice cream roll parlours. We tasted oreo delight, dairy milk darling,caffeine,chocolate crepes,dark fantasy and they all tasted really great and very distinct from each other. We also tasted cola flavored lava drinks as per the store's recommendation and it really tasted great! Only downside is that it doesn't have seating. Still, i would highly recommend this place.

Tawa/Fried Ice cream rolls are the in thing now! so I wanted to try them out..and Chillz Live Ice Cream
 is the place which i find yesterday on Zomato.I went there with my friend.
Firstly, Chillz Live Ice Cream is located just beside Gol Mandir at Elgin.
Coming to the icecreams, we had chosen two varieties Dairy Milk Darling and Royal Date.I loved both! You have many options ranging from Paan flavoured to Dark Fantasy to Mango!
The staff was really polite and described everything to us.The process of making the ice cream seemed really cool.
I will be back again to try the other flavours of ice cream rolls :)
