A small juice parlour near the Bhawanipur Gujrati Education Society College. Juicy Fresh is a savior during scorching summer months. Had their Bananaberry Shake which was a nice blend of bananas, strawberries and ice cream. It tasted awesome. Also the Chocolate Milk Shake was a good one though the price is a bit high. (Costs Rs 70 for each medium glass).

I've been here a lot. Every friday and sunday for almost 2 consecutive years( long time back). 
I do not vivdly recall their menu and I believe they have changed their menu a bit not sure because there used to be a protein drink with a spinach base which was too much vegan for me. 
Their other combinations including the carrot and watermelon mashup is amazing. Even their orange and mausambi mashup. Nice small place. Value for money 3/5. Juices 5/5!
Happy dining.! 
CHEERS!

A place where you get fresh juices located near Bhawanipur College, this place does bring a spark with fresh and tasty juices and shakes on offer. A sure stop during college days to beat the heat with refreshing juices. Happy to see they still maintain that freshness and spark at the outlet

Overpriced, but somehow the freshness of the places everytime you step into it makes you like it!
Some out of the box and fitness beverages also available!
Surprisingly, never once have they ever served us a juice or shake that wasnt up to the mark!

My favourite Juice Bar.

A small store with barely any identification except the kickass juices squeezed and blended in front of you.

No flies.

Lotsa college crowd.

Reasonably priced.

Energizer and Kiwi Crush my favourites.

Brilliant.

It is located beside bhawanipore gujrati education society college and also opposite to diocessan girls school. It is a juice centre highly popular with the post school kids . There are sitting places for 3-4 people. They prepare the order in front of you fresh from the refrigerator.

Location: Adjacent to Au Bon Pain (Elgin); A minute away from Bhawanipur College.

Have been visiting this place for years now, but somehow missed on reviewing this place!
Its a small shop with a few stools as seating arrangements serving, as the name suggests, freshly made juices along with a few shakes and unique juice blends in three different sizes (small, medium, large). I have always stuck to a couple of them as they are my personal favorites.

- Choc Shake
Milk, chocolate sauce and ice-cream churned together served with chocolate sprinkle on top! Delicious!!

- Create your Own Juice (Orange+Mausambi)
Freshly churned out juice, pulpy in nature. Absolutely refreshing!

The staff is polite and caters to your order at a standard speed.
Prices are pretty reasonable.

Overall has always been a good experience.
- Fresh n' healthy

Juicy Fresh is a small juice bar located near Bhawanipore College just next to the newly opened outlet of Au Bon Pain. The shop is a small one and hardly has standing space for 6-7 people and sitting space only for 3-4. Juicy Fresh specializes in customizable juices, shakes and other carbonated drinks. The essence of lemon surrounds the nearby area because of their famous Fresh Lime Soda which is their most recommended item. Choco shake is also quite good with some ice cream. Other shakes include Strawberry, Chikoo, Banana, Citrus and seasonal Mango shake which is rarely available in July and August. Shakes and juices are not too cold and are just perfect for immediate consumption without having throat problems.

Hygiene is quite good as the fruits are stored in refrigerator and the mixer, blenders and everything is clean. Service is very fast and shakes and juices take very less time to be prepared, billing is also very fast and professional as they have computerized billing (not expected from such a small juice bar).

Value for money is very good. Their pricing is for small, medium and large cup sizes and everything costs less than 100 bucks (as far as I remember).

Update: Recently tried out their Fresh Lime Soda. I will say that it is really very good and value for money as well. It is highly recommended and the most selling product of Juicy Fresh.

Juicy Fresh has been there for a long time but I started visiting this place more often after I quit drinking carbonated soft drinks. If you've been to Bangalore or Hyderabad you'll find juices here in Kolkata quite expensive. (I don't understand why?!)
Keeping that aside the place serves nice fresh juices and some really amazing combos. My favorite is Citrus Kick.
There are three sizes available S, M and L. As you increase the size, you add 10 bucks extra, so usually it makes sense to just go for the large one. Choose a healthier lifestyle, go try Juicy Fresh!

Juicy Fresh - Absolutely Fresh and customised juices at Reasonable prices.
=====================================================
Intro: 

It is located like 2 minutes from Bhawanipore College and serves really fresh juices made in front of you with no mixes. I had been here couple of times. They have different blends of juices to give different mixes to our taste. I really liked their concept of serving fresh juices at pretty okay prices. In this scorching summer, you need some good natural juices to chill. It was flavoursome. 
=====================================================
Drinks:

I had tried yesterday night when i was near flavour's to chill around. I tried:

Citrus Kick Juice - It was amazing. Not very sweet to make it not enjoyable. It was quite sweet and that's what was making the juice amazing. I perhaps felt that they had mixed some ice cream in the juice. It was a unique preparation much different from the usual juices you get.

One of my friend had packed it for me. I would recommend take away as the place isn't too big. However, the quality of the juice makes up for it. However, i had visited this place long back too. The staffs were very courteous and there make amazing combo's of juices here. 
=====================================================
Summary: 

Ambience 3.5/5
Quantity of Drink 4/5
Quality 4/5
Taste 4.5/5
Hospitality 4/5
Value for money 4/5
=====================================================
Conclusion

Would love to visit it again. It's too good as a healthy drink. One must try it in this scorching summer. :)

This juice bar has been sitting pretty on Elgin Road, at the crossing of Lansdowne Rd for the past 9 years or so. It is only recently I have begun visiting. One reason being the attempt to shift away from sodas!

Being a  creature of habit, I tend to order my usual, which happens to be the Citrus Tango here. It consists of freshly squeezed orange juice, Amul vanila icecream and sugar blended into a nice thickish shake, deliciously sweet and tangy!

They use fresh ingredients and seem to be clean enough. Friendly staff, they do not try to short-change you either. The only issue is the place is rather small, with just 3-4 small chairs.

They otherwise have a variety of juices, and offer customisation too. No gimmicks though. I have tried the plain orange juice and the fresh lime soda (the latter should have tasted better, but for some reason it did not).

Worth a visit.
