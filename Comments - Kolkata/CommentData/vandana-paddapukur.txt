One of the best restaurant for veggie people in bhawanipur. The south india food is nice and the best part Jain Sambar is also available here (Which is not available everywhere).

This is a small restaurant for South Indian dishes along with some choice of chinese food. This is a veg restaurant. Â The option in dosas are many but not much in chinese food. The prices are reasonable.

Vandana.....on Ashton Road used to be a restaurant we used to go to when we wanted to have a typical Gujarati thali, which had farsan, salads, veggies, kadhi, phulka, rice, dals et all. There was also chaas and you finished off in style with the Gujarati special Shrikhand, But alas it shut down and was sorely missed. Suddenly one day passing that area I saw the signage and Vandana open again. So it was on my wish list to visit again and taste their food again. But alas when I visited again it wasn't the same. I was in for a disappointment as they didn't have a Gujarati thali. They had a limited North Indian thali, which was very limited having roti/ rice, paneer butter masala, Chana masala, moong dal, parval Bhaji,dahi, mango pickle and papad. No salad, and definitely no sweets. ( Sigh). It wasn't the same.( Nostalgia).
There really wasn't anything wrong with the dishes but it wasn't great either. The missing items from the thali could have changed that. We had to order chaas separately and they put in so much of green chilly in it that it was undrinkable. ( Of course on telling them they changed it) The second time the chaas was ok.
They don't have North Indian dishes on the menu to be ordered a la carte, only South Indian and sandwiches. They need to look into this anomaly.
The place was ok but service needs improvement.

very bad experience from one of the oldest restaurants in bhawanipore.. Got a hair in sambhar. on informing the waiter and management, they first told they cancel the order but charged me in the bill. when I complained about it one of the senior person started arguing that he cannot change the bill and said they'll parcel another idli vada and give (giving sambhar from the same unit from which hair had come out). very unprofessional approach. had to pay the full bill to get out of the argument. bad dinner experience.

Vandana is a pure veg restaurant serving South Indian and Chinese food.

I have been here once and tried their South Indian option from their offerings. The masala dosa was made well and quite decent in taste. I liked the fact that they kept it simple and that's what you need or search for in South Indian food. I am rating them a bit high because of their service which really impressed me.

Vandana is one of the oldest restaurants around in bhawanipur. Used to be of medium quality, and then they rented it to another group and it changed to chechis. Chechis maintained their quality so well, unfortunately they closed down and vandana is set up again. The quality has gone down by tons. Tried it two days back, the masala dosa wasnt up to the standard. The chutney was stale, the sambhar tasteless. 
Would strongly  recommend against it.
