This is the best option in the city centre 2 food court when it comes to sizzlers. We have tried their italian sizzler, smoky chicken and cheese pasta. All the dishes were delicious. The italian sizzler comes with pasta , a chicken patty, a chicken salad and chunks of smoked chicken. Price is also pocket friendly.

There is nothing to talk about their ambience s it is situated in Hangout(CC2). The staff interaction is extremely nice. Their food quality and quantity is proper according to the cost. I like the Italian sizzler here and the smoky chicken too.

This small food joint is located in food court of City Center 2 Mall of Rajarhat. They offer various kind of items in such affordable prices. There are some really good tasty items in their menu. We have tried their-

1) Cheers special Chicken sizzler ( It was served sizzling hot and was presented well in cabbage leaves bed. It had two chicken items each chicken with minimum of 8 pieces of chicken so in total near about 16-18 pieces of chicken in the whole plate. One of the chicken items was way too tasty but a bit spicy and the other one was on sweeter side. It was served with hakka noodles which was also good in taste. Quantity was good for one adult and a child. It won't serve two adults fully.)

2) Bread combo ( Another awesome one with 8 pieces of sandwiches that have lipsmacking filling and served with a chicken side dish)

I don't know why the rating so poor here in zomato but I happen to like the food items here alot. Prices are economical and the quantity and quality of food served in respect to that price is quite good. Hope to visit there someday again to try their other sizzlers and Mexican items.
