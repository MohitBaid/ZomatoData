Sharma Sweets is synonmous to every Calcutta Kachori Sabzi Lover. This outlet is easily locatable as it is very near to Charu Chandra College. The Hing Kachori along with Aloo Kids Sabzi( Typical Marwari Style!) served with Green Chilli and Tamarind Chutney is lip smacking. If you are passing by Lake Market this is the snack to gulp down. Go & Enjoy ur our very own Calcutta style Puri Sabzi!!!

Nothing about the ambience as it is a small kinda shop. 
Staffs are sober and service is prompt. 
Must try their kachori, Lassi, gulab Jamun, jalebi. 
Recommendable ‚ù§

The filling was good, slightly spicy from garam masala! Also got rasgullas from here. Was surprised to find it soft and spongy and absolutely delicious!

A place for good breakfast that's for sure. Their sabzi and kachori are very freshly served and it's always comes hot.

Also the variety in sweets are long and it's really good too. To mention is their 
Gulab jamun
Gajar ka Halwa
Kalakand and 
Other Bengali style sweets
Even to mention is Jalebi 

Good one :)

This was a real discovery. After having Puri-sabzi at Maharani (which i found is a bit overrated) i had a craving for sweet lassi. Being from Old Delhi, I am used to having Bedmi-aloo with lassi. So I asked one of the workers at Maharani, who recommended Sharma Sweets. It's a little no-frills kind of shop in a nearby lane. The lassi was authentic UP-style. ¬†Not too creamy, nor too sweet, easy on the stomach. Sharmaji was preparing the lassi, which again is a very UP thing (where the owner himself takes charge of the lassi). I had a Motichoor laddoo, which had no silver coating or pista. It tasted very much like the famous kanpuri laddoo. The kalakand was equally delicious, as if I was biting into pure milk and sugar. All in all, the place is simplicity personified. I was too full to try the kachori-sabzi but I am sure that would be great too.

Location :- just a walk down lane through the lake market area  you will find this legendary place.

Ambience :- old school sweet shop nothing speacial xcept the aromas of ghee and rabris.

Food:-
Gajar ka halua is my favrt.. the smell ghee is makes it unique n loaded wid dry fruits.

Lassi one of the best with a thick malai on the top. Both salted n sweet version available but i prefer the sweet one.

Gulab jamun always served hot soft n fresh.

Pocket pinch :- Rs 100 for two

Conclusion:- an ideal place if you want to put on some xtra weight at lower pocket pinch as the prices are reasonable compared to outlets of these stracher.

This is located in the same building as that of Tamarind restaurant.¬† They have many outlets in Kolkata but I like this outlet the most. During my school days I used to frequent here a lot as I had tutions in the next lane. The Kachori-sabzi combo is outstanding. I am not a big fan of their Gulab jamun but the Lassi is a great way to finish off the meal. Prices are very cheap too.

I love the Sharma's outlets for their Kachoris. They are superb. Every time I am in Kolkata, I have breakfast out there for 75% of the time. I have had the Kachoris at various times during the day. Its always served fresh and hot. They taste wonderful with jalebis which are available only in the morning.

Lassi is good too. And I always finish with kalakand and peda. These are the best kalakands I have had anywhere in India. With all this, it is a filling breakfast, but super light on your pocket. 

There are two Sharma's around this region which serve the same food. Same quality. Exact same taste. I guess they are brothers. You can try any of them. One of them is on Sarat Bose Road bang opposite Deshapriya Park (next to Tamarind restaurant), and the other one is about 750 mts down the road towards Southern Avenue next to some college (on the lane which will be on your right hand side - the 1st traffic light after petrol pump).

Being very near to my place, it is my new spot for quick bites. :-) 
This place lacks seating arrangements, but has wall-side table which facilitates people to stand and eat.

Talking about the food,
- Sabji kachori, Khasta Kachori, Jalebis and Samosa tastes great. 
- Gulab jamun is absolutely delicious!! Always served hot. 
- The Lassi to flush the bite down is simply yummilicious.

Staff is prompt and efficient! 
Prices are pocket friendly. 

Overall a good experience always. :-)

On the very first morning of New Year's, walked down to Sharma's and gorged on Kachuris. What I love about Sharma's Kochuri is that along with the "Alur Torkari" and "Misti Chatni" they also serve an awesome "Lonkar Achaar". 

This morning they also had hot freshly prepared "Gajar ka Halwa". It was a perfect gastronomical start to 2014.

It is just really a sweetmeat shop, but I for some reason like the ambiance. I like sitting outside under the trees and having my Kochuris. The shopkeepers are nice and always serve with a smile.

Whenever I come to Sharma's I realize what Lal Mohan Babu meant when he said "Selling like Hot Kochuris !"

Piping hot kachoris, jalebis, and all of it ends with a thick lassi with a good bit of the curd skin on the top floating on top... perfect meal to start or end a day. I am also a fan of their Kaju Barfis and Gulab Jamuns, as well as the samosas with a side of chutney.

I can never forget those days, when Sharma sweets was tucked into a small corner of a very old building at Deshapriya Park junction. Now though, they demolished the building and created a new one, which houses the new Sharma, as well as the Tamarind. Their kachuris served with chutney are awesome, and must be followed by, either lassi or gulab jamun. From my school days, and of many other's, this place remains a fast bite haunt, a must visit.

Sharma is al delightful little eating joint that is enough to satisfy a hungry stomach and not burn a hole in a wallet. Priced quite reasonably, the kachori sabji served there is simply marvelous and so as the other items. Of course, visiting Sharma for it's lassi alone is worth it. Drop by at Sharmas if you safe passing by, fellow foodies.

Sharma's is the best place for the best kachodis in town. This place gives Tasty Corner a run for its money any day. Also, its more decently priced. The food served is always sizzling hot and delicious. The guy at the counter is friendly and polite. The chutney served with the kachodis and aloo is amazing. And then there's the lassi. I stay in north Kolkata and have travelled south on a couple of occasions only to have their kachodis, such is the appeal. I will go back again and again. A very good 4.5

Sharma Sweets the name in most people's mouths. After the Maharani and the Maharaja competition the next thing which comes to people of the area is probably the kachoris at Sharma Sweets. 
It is very famous but not to be confused with the chain sharma sweets.
I used to go here sometimes for the lassi after my rowing sessions. That was way way back, some 9-10 years back. 
There are a few sweets here which I just love, like the "kala pata shandesh" and the Gulab Jamuns and in winter they make Gajar Halwa which sells like hot cakes or probably even faster.
The place is a normal sweet shop, non ac and simple but yes the food is very good.
Do not forget their lassi's 'malai maarke' or the dahi vada or even the 'mishti doi'. Though the mishti doi is no where close to Jadab Das which I believe is the best here but it won't be a let down at least.
My personal favourite however is the samosa chaat which comprises of a smashed samosa, some kachori gravy, few masala, a little curd and chutney with spices. Simple, but I have been having it for ages way back since it was worth just 5 rupees. 
As a sweet shop it is not very great as well as they have a limitation regarding the space and the area to stand and eat.
I hope they open up another section maybe on the opposite side or something if possible as often it gets too crowded.
In short it is nothing but value for money if you go for their snacks.
Their samosas are samosas and not shingaras so if you know the difference between the two you would know what to opt for according to your personal taste and preference.

Sharma's is quite good for samosas and rabri. They also make a decent milk cake. Though they aren't part of the more famous (and now almost defunct) Sharma chain, their rabri can be compared to what used to be churned out by that Sharma's chain. Since this is a shop, one shouldn't expect any kind of fancy decor. It's the quality of the food that is more important.

The only problem with the shop is that it has become very dirty these days. Given the volumes that visit, I am sure they can afford to put aside part of their profits and ensure that the place is kept clean. It's an excellent place to go to for an evening snack, especially in winter.

In my college life sharma sweets full filled my hunger with its delicious kachori. Its kachori is best in the city,and pls dont forget to take lassi at last as desert. You will be really refteshed after having it. Sharma's soanpapri are also main attraction with gulab jamoon and jalebi. In a word its a place to filled up stomach in low budget.
