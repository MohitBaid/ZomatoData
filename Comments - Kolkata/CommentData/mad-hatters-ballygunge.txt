A cozy place suitable for couples and friends. It will be a bit difficult to locate for first timers but the map is accurate. Coming to the food, we ordered chicken cutlet and chicken Penne pasta in white sauce. I am very satisfied with the quality of food. The quantity was okay considering the price. This place is good for long chats and romantic dates.

Located in the lanes of Swinhoe Street, the cafe could be a little difficult to locate. It's a small, cosy place with beautiful decorations comprising of hats (Referring to the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland) and portraits of Johnny Depp. The food quality and quantity is quite impressive. I came here twice. 
The non-veg platter was a special menu available only during September. We ordered pasta, Cool Rita, Cold Coffee and chicken burger. Every item was delicious. And they host small birthday parties or anniversaries. The staff is amicable and courteous. The promptness of the service can be improved. Nevertheless, love this place.

Not at all an easy place to locate,its almost in a dead end street with a single entry/exit road.But its a beautifully done up place.Probably because of the location not many people have come across it.Me and my friend were out for a walk in the bylanes of ballygunge when we stumbled across it.We went up for tea and caramel custard and it was mouth wateringly delicious.I would definitely want to visit this place again to try out the main courses.Prices are reasonable and the staff very homely.

Situated at ballygunge place, Mad Hatters provides you an excellent ambience to spend your stressfully day. The food quantity and taste is worth every penny you pay( it is pocket friendly ). We tried the ham egg club sandwich and chicken cheese spaghetti. Both are extremely good.

This is one stop food shop - a hidden gem located @Ballygunj Place. The landmark is a bit tricky - take the lane beside 6, Ballygunj Place and and when you hit straight to the end of the blind lane just take a look on your left, you can see the glowsign Mad Hatter's cafe (recommended by one of my close foodie friend). We visited on a Fri eve when our city of joy was flooded with heavy shower. 

Cafe is located on the first floor of the bldg - a nice cozy place to hang out with friend. Ambience is impressive too with lots of paintings, hand crafted show pieces.

Coming to food we ordered - meat balls, cheese balls, chicken burger, grilled fish and caramel custard. We relished the food like anything specially the grilled fish and the caramel custard was so so yummy. I would recommend the food lovers to visit this cafe specially those who crave for western taste.

Place was easy to find wid google maps so we checked into this cosy place around 5 ish in the evng, place was absolutely empty‚ù§Ô∏è! 

Its got hat theme nd d view through the transparent glasses was üëåüèΩüëåüèΩüëàüèΩ. 

So we first ordered chicken delight burger and chicken sandwich, got us waited for sometime before it finally came - looked colourful with fries, chips and salad!  Burger with chicken patty tasted good and so did d sandwich which came in huge quantity!

Then went to chicken cutlet -- absolutely  mouthwaterin !! Golden brownish and crumbly, tasted so fresh üòãüòã & again quantity was good enough. Finally we had cappuccino and latte, both strong enough wid right amt of foam and steamed milk.

Tucked away in Ballygunge, the place is hard to locate! The seating is fine but not for long as these are stylized wooden benches actually. Furniture is assorted with the hat theme dominating the decor. Food is very good. Friends met for an after-work adda and catching up. It was pretty satisfying. Finger food and hors d'oeuvre and tea, that's how we spent a great evening in the company of dear friends meeting after months. Cozy corner and good food, what more does one want on a rainy evening? The service is unobtrusive and efficient too.

Mad hatter's! Neat little joint tucked in the bylanes of Ballygunge. Further down the lane from 6 Ballygunge place. It's a nice restaurant with warm decor and good food. The service was nice and staff was very courteous.

We ordered the following :

Cream of mushroom soup - good
Bacon and potato salad -  average.My suggestion would be limit the sheer amount of mayo that they put in this. Way too much mayo masks the taste of the meat.
Lamb chops-Great ! Fabulous succulent lamb chops served with Khus Khus and scrumptious fresh sauted veggies.
Grilled Fish - Again a very tasty dish !

Overall a decent experience.

Last month on a rainy evening , we fixed our cousins meet up at madhatter's. The staff was extremely courteous and friendly , helped us to choose our orders and clicking few pictures. The ambience is warm and cozy with seatings available in high tables as well as normal ones. Right from the gardened entrance to the flight of stairs with fabric walls and huge mirrors , the interiors are quite impressive.
One advice for the first timers , use Navigation to locate the cafe , as the lanes are extremely confusing.

The menu seemed very restricted with fewer choices , i ordered for a CHICKEN ROAST and CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD , both done well. Our other orders were PENNE IN PESTO SAUCE , tasted nice but the smell wasn't appreciated and a combo meal including MULLIGATWANY SOUP , CHICKEN CUTLET , CHICKEN LASAGNA and CARAMEL CUSTARD , Everything tasted good enough . The mocktail PINK PANTHER was average , STRAWBERRY SHAKE and COLD COFFEE was spot on , while my cup of CARDAMOM TEA was tad pricey.

Only con was the serving time. Tremendously slow , we waited almost 40-45 minutes for a single dish , the excuse given everything is cooked fresh !

Mad Hatter's is situated deep within the alleys of Ballygunge. It's on the first floor, the ground floor being Firaangi Desi (a boutique kind of thing). The entrance is beautifully decorated with trees & lamps. The interior & decor is quite & calm stating the cuteness of the space.

However, food served here is FRESH !! The plating & presentations are just perfect - a colorful plate always !!

Staffs always have smiling faces :) are friendly, courteous & keeps on taking feedback, which in turns equalizes towards a scope of betterment & suggestion. Menu have limited options.

The things we had tasted:
Mocktails: Fresh Lime Soda, Pink Panther, Orange Lemonade
Sandwich: Mushroom, onion & cheese, American corn & cheese¬†

Reasonable pricing ¬†P.S. No Tax charged !!

Might be little difficult to locate. Please keep google map handy to find this place in the one of the lanes of the posh Ballygunge Place area.

It was a Saturday evening when we visited and the place was almost empty. I quiet liked the calm and decent interiors.

The mocktails are really good. Refreshing and perfectly made. Food tastes slightly better than average, not great. However, the ingredients are fresh and they will never serve you pre-cooked stuff. That is one of the reasons why the serving time is about 35 minutes for 1 single dish.

Menu options are limited.

Staff is extremely courteous. Nothing to complain about.

Price is reasonable.

Try the "COOLRITA" it won't dissapoint you.
And for people like me who love to click pictures of themselves  (narcissistic basically ) , there is also a beautifully decorated specified corner for it.

The food in Mad Hatter‚Äôs has one ethos- the freshest ingredients, simply but expertly concocted, always make food that is classic in its elegance. It's the best kept secret in Kolkata for a summer eat out with amazing soups and salads!
The salads I tried were the ‚ÄòMoroccan shrimp salad‚Äô, ‚ÄòKabuli salad‚Äô, ‚ÄòSummer greens salad‚Äô, ‚ÄòMediterranean salad‚Äô and the ‚ÄòItalian surprise‚Äô.¬†
The Italian Surprise was fantastic! Fresh, handpicked tomatoes stuffed with crumbly feta cheese with a sprinkling of parsley and a drizzle of olive oil- it‚Äôs a perfect example of the culinary feat that can be achieved when you blend the freshest of ingredients with an innovative presentation. The crunchy, tangy freshness of the tomatoes is nicely offset by the crumbly, salty feta and the combo of olive oil and parsley beautifully enhanced the flavour, making for a dish that promptly flew of the plate!
The Summer Green was a light-as-air, fruity salad that was a treat for the eyes as well as palette. It offered a delightful, fresh crunch with lettuce, cucumber and apples mixed with sweet pomegranate and tart olives, all lightly bathed in a tangy French dressing that added just that right amount of ‚ÄòOoh La La!‚Äô in this delicate summer salad.
The Mediterranean salad offered the same note as the Summer Green, using cherry tomatoes, colourful bell peppers, lettuce and feta to create another lightweight, delicious summery concoction.
I fell in love with the Moroccan shrimp salad at the first sight! It was a medley of colours, with brightly coloured bell peppers and fresh, lightly-steamed pink shrimps peeping out from a bed of couscous! The yummy taste and flavours popped in my mouth with every mouthful and was like instant food Nirvana! A zest of lemon enhanced the nutty after-taste of the dish and left me craving for more.
The Kabuli salad took me by surprise with its taste and presentation! Imagine an exquisitely-crafted ‚Äòalu kabli‚Äô of sorts, with ginger juliennes and shredded chicken to up it‚Äôs irresistibility quotient by a few notches and you can get an idea of the dish. ¬† ¬† ¬†
What really impressed me was the freshness of the ingredients, the fact that they were all so light in the stomach, and yet tasted fantastic and were very innovatively done.
I tasted the soups next, and let me tell you at the outset that they were absolutely mind-blowing! The soups in Mad Hatter‚Äôs simply re-define the standard idea of soups that you get in any outlets in Kolkata serving Continental cuisine.
First came the Curry Soup which had the unmistakable Anglo-Indian touch to it. It had a thickish, lentil-based broth, spiked with the flavourfulness of curry leaves and very innovatively studded with firm, fresh apples!¬†
Next in line was the Italian Delight which floored me with it‚Äôs simple goodness! It was a light and clear soup with a handful of fresh veggies like carrot, zuccinni and bell peppers thrown in. It tasted so good that you will invariably come for a second helping, and it is just the kind of soup that will cause your Mom to shed happy tears due to your rapid devouring of the same.
I loved, loved, loved the Simple Fish Soup that we tried next. It is exactly that- a simple fish soup with a light, clear broth delicately scented with coriander and lemon, with little chunks of white fish in it. It is incredibly toothsome!¬†
The other soup that made my heart sing a song was the Mushroom Delight. It is a simple Cream of Mushroom soup, that tasted something like heaven! I have tasted various renderings of this soup all my life, and this is probably the best one that I have had. Yes, it is THAT good!

Located in the bylanes of Ballygunge, this place offers a nice cosy ambience, great food, good service at a very competitive pocket pinch.Apart from a wide array of vegetarian and non-vegetarian burgers, they have seasonal menus that are innovative and delectable. Their summer menu comprises of an enticing list of Coolers, Soups and Salads which are sure to please you in ways more than one! The fish soup,curry soup and the Moroccan shrimp salad are a must try. For people like me who are not great fans of soups and salads this place is the perfect answer. If not for the Cool Rita I am surely going back for that Fish soup! Bon Appetit üòä

Soups and salads aren't things which I am usually very excited about. But my experience at Mad Hatter's completely changed that. The salads ranging from the simple Tomato Feta to the lovely Shrimp and Quinoa salad, we're exceptional.

Of their soups, I loved the Fish Soup the most, followed closely by the Curry Soup. But well, being mushroom loyalist that I am, I couldn't ignore the rich, creamy Mushroom Soup too.

The food here is light, fresh, and unpretentious.
The wide variety of soups and salads that this place offers is perfect for the sultry summers. And if that's not enough, their lamb burger is pure joyüòç!

Mad Hatter's is a beautiful cafe located in the lanes of Ballygunge. The cafe shares space with Firangi Desi and the salon! The owners are beautiful people who take you through the menu, and never let you feel like a first timer. The interplay of colours and taste is impressive! Their summer menu is highly recommended. Definitely order their fish soup and curry soup; their minced steak burger; mocktails, and salads! The food is freshly prepared and very light. My favorite place starting yesterday.

Tucked inside Ballygunje's various lanes and by lanes, one would not so easily find or go this place until he/she is really willing to be adventurous and try out something new, something different yet something similar. The entrance of Mad Hatter's is a rather tricky one to find but once inside there's  the most homeliest feel one would get. There's the wonderful staff who'd greet you with a smile and try and be the most polite of people in Kolkata, which is a rather very nice feeling. The ambience of the place was great with the added decor and furniture.  I'd ordered two burgers, pork and lamb which were served within a very adequate time. The chef himself had come to ask me about the food, which was very very generous of him to do so. Now leaving aside the other little details I directly jump to the food. 
Everything is freshly made and prepared starting from the patty for the burger to the dips themselves which was really appealing. The only place where it fell short was when it came to the quantity of the fillings in the burger. Just the meat patty and veggies dosent make a good burger. It was missing slices of bacons and ham which was important to make it a filling meal for which i had to add the aforesaid to the burger with extra charge. Most importantly Mad Hatter's burgers missed out on  Cheese and burgers without cheese are not great burgers at all. The service and the behaviour of the staffs are commendable which is an obvious since it's a new place and it will be great if such a homely service is continued along with certain improvements in the 'quantity' of the ingredients used in the food served.

A gem of a place. Every dish we had was great. They have a wonderful collection of soup; we chose the potato and onion soup and loved it. Creamy, flavorsome and absolutely soothing. The mushroom and paneer croquettes were very well made, deep fried yet super light. The Persian burger was the healthiest burger option what with the patty being a khus-khus one. It was crumbly and delicious. I was glad they served it with onion rings. My companion enjoyed his chicken stroganoff. Portions are the perfect size. The place itself is quite small and cute. We were the only ones there that afternoon, hence, service was great. Kudos and well done to the team!

Mad Hatters in Ballygunge Place is a new outlet in a space I have visited earlier. The little boutique on the ground floor has interesting sarees and the first floor (where the cafe resides now) was where I have attended some lovely performances.

A dear friend invited us there for lunch in the Christmas week. The space is aesthetically done and you can see the owners good taste reflected in every corner including the little money plants in light bulbs placed on each table.

The food had been pre ordered, which ensured we could focus on conversation. We ate:

Cream of mushroom soup: Absolutely delightful! It is my favouritest soup; I am very picky about it and make a mean one myself, but have to say this was very impressive.

Roast chicken: Looked just right. The dark golden brown chicken pieces were just waiting to be devoured. It could have done with a bit more of the roast gravy but otherwise all good.

Shepherds pie: My childhood favourite did not disappoint. The mince was flavoured just right and potatoes done perfectly.

Accompaniments: Salad, saut√©ed vegetables and mashed potatoes....all pretty good.

Caramel custard: This did not quite live up to the rest of the meal. The sugar was not caramelised enough and the custard denser than what is ideal.

Given this is a very new enterprise I was pretty happy with the quality of food. The menu looked very interesting and the staff were very courteous. I went back the next day for coffee with some friends and we had a lovely time. Definitely a place worth revisiting.

Yes you have to take the lane beside 6 Ballygunge Place and where the road ends just look at your left... you will find the bright sign board of it... ask no one just entire the boutique and take the staircase to the first floor... the deco is bright and classy... ambience was mesmerizing... music was very catchy... it's a very good place for hangout with friends and family over some tasty foods...

I went their with some of my friends and tried some of their delicacies...

‚ô° Cream of mushroom soup¬ª¬ª¬ª Very yummy... the crispy croutons served with it... gone very well...

‚òÖ Walnut vegetable salad¬ª¬ª¬ª Good one...

‚ô°‚ô° Bacon and potato salad¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent...

‚òÖ Assorted fries platter (Veg & Non veg)¬ª¬ª¬ª I personally liked the veg one... it consists of mushroom potato fritters and paneer fritters... both were very tasty... the non veg one consists of two different types of chicken fritters... good one... but nothing wow...

‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° Pasta with cherry tomatoes and bacon¬ª¬ª¬ª Insane... just amazing... # Highly recommended...

‚òÖ Grilled fish with veggies¬ª¬ª¬ª Okish one... I find the fish being bit under done...

‚ô°‚ô° Walnut brownie with chocolate sauce¬ª¬ª¬ª what a dessert to end with... just yummy... #Highly recommended...

So overall it's a very good experience... only they need to work on their service a bit... Will visit again for sure...

This review might be a bit biased since it's owned by my family but I really enjoyed my dining experience. We ordered the pesto pasta with prawns which was creamy and isn't cooked al dente, which I prefer but could use more prawns. I also tried the chicken salad sandwich and chicken roast with mashed potatoes for take out. I usually never eat the skin on chicken legs but it was so tasty I finished all of it. To finish with I tried the brownie it was so soft and gooey it was the perfect dessert to end the meal. Looking forward to going back

Cute entrance and love the flight of stairs that you take to reach Mad Hatter's. A very Simple yet Elegant D√©cor. A unique Menu Card which is written on the wall using a black board I guess. Coming to the Food. I have a Mushroom Soup. Lovely presentation and Fantastic taste and texture.  Had Order a pasta (Cheese) based for my kids and boy they had a gala time perfect Pasta. We Order for a salad which was delicious and tasty. In the main course we ordered A Veggy Stroganoff. Well presented and prepared but should limit the use of wine. I could feel and smell the wine. Yes would love to go back to try the Non Veggies.

Ballugunge is now becoming the new area for the young Gen in the coming times with some most mind blowing places. With the kind of needs and love for food and relevant experience for the youngsters the requirement has been diverted to a casual dining than to be fine diners for some quick and better experiences.

Yes you have to take the lane beside 6 Ballygunge Place and where the road ends just look at your left... you will find the bright sign board of it... ask no one just entire the boutique and take the staircase to the first floor... the deco is bright and classy... ambience was mesmerizing... music was very catchy... it's a very good place for hangout with friends and family over some tasty foods...

I went their with some of my friends and tried some of their delicacies...

‚ô° Cream of mushroom soup¬ª¬ª¬ª Very yummy... the crispy croutons served with it... gone very well...

‚òÖ Walnut vegetable salad¬ª¬ª¬ª Good one...

‚ô°‚ô° Bacon and potato salad¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent...

‚òÖ Assorted fries platter (Veg & Non veg)¬ª¬ª¬ª I personally liked the veg one... it consists of mushroom potato fritters and paneer fritters... both were very tasty... the non veg one consists of two different types of chicken fritters... good one... but nothing wow...

‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° Pasta with cherry tomatoes and bacon¬ª¬ª¬ª Insane... just amazing... # Highly recommended...

‚òÖ Grilled fish with veggies¬ª¬ª¬ª Okish one... I find the fish being bit under done...

‚ô°‚ô° Walnut brownie with chocolate sauce¬ª¬ª¬ª what a dessert to end with... just yummy... #Highly recommended...

So overall it's a very good experience... only they need to work on their service a bit... Will visit again for sure...

This review might be a bit biased since it's owned by my family but I really enjoyed my dining experience. We ordered the pesto pasta with prawns which was creamy and isn't cooked al dente, which I prefer but could use more prawns. I also tried the chicken salad sandwich and chicken roast with mashed potatoes for take out. I usually never eat the skin on chicken legs but it was so tasty I finished all of it. To finish with I tried the brownie it was so soft and gooey it was the perfect dessert to end the meal. Looking forward to going back

Mad Hatter‚Äôs newly opened joint is located in the interiors of Ballygunge. It‚Äôs at a walking distance from 6 Ballygunge Place. Mad Hatter‚Äôs is a caf√© which boasts of a homely environment which is at very much contrast with the regular hookah parlours found in abundance around the city. This place has a fresh feel and is best suited for people looking out for a peaceful joint where they can spend some alone time reading books or articles (which you have to bring your own), while sipping on the favourite mocha and munching on to some delicacies.

The use of vibrant colours and quirky d√©cor puts the interiors right in line with the ambience which makes you feel right at home.

I was saddened to discover that they don‚Äôt serve alcohol. But there are plans in formulation to acquire a liquor license pretty soon. Well that‚Äôs a piece of good news.
Being a budding joint, the staff also needs a slight bit of polishing on their skills. All in all, it was a pleasant evening, thanks to the owner who is a real gentleman. Would like to thank Shahbaaz Zaman for suggesting this place.

So folks that was about it from Mad Hatter‚Äôs.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Quiet corners of Ballygunge can certainly throw up surprises. Such is the Quirky joint with the coziest decor, funkiest and cutest cutlery ever. What is even more Fantastic is what they serve in them. The cream of Mushroom soup, a rather staid offering by any standard, is also so delectable served with lovely croutons on the side. Now take their spaghetti with meat sauce, it blew my mind away. The bacon and potato salad is Delicious. Their prawn cutlets are something to die for.

Location: This place is located near 6 ballygunge place.

Decor and Ambience: I loved the look and feel of this restaurant. It has a nice laid back feel to it and the use of white and bright colors gives this place a really lovely positive vibe. I loved the bulbs, so beautiful. This is a fun place for you and your group to sit down and have a good time over good food.

Shahbaaz Zaman introduced me to this place.

Food tasted :

*Cream of mushroom soup : This soup screamed mushrooms. The mushroom flavour was bang on. The soup was Perfectly creamy, well seasoned and the crispy croutons added a lot bite and crunch. Loved it.

*Walnut vegetable salad : I liked this salad. It has loads of veggies and walnut in it. And they have actually not sabotaged the goodness of this salad by dousing the veggies in mayo. The vinaigrette dressing is perfect in my opinion.

*Bacon and potato salad : I loved this dish. If you love bacon then Mad Hatters wil surely impress you. The quality of bacon used is excellent. And they are so generous with their portions. The mayo was not too heavy on the palate as well.

*Assorted fries platter (veg and non veg) : The veg one had mushroom-potato fritters and paneer fritters. I loved the taste. Brilliant. The non veg one had two types of chicken fritters. This one also was pretty darn good. What I loved most about the fries were that none of those were soggy or oily. The crust was beautifully golden brown and crunchy. Both the platters came with kasundi, pico de Gallo and spicy mayo dip.

* Pasta with cherry tomatoes and bacon : perfectly 'al dente' pasta, well seasoned with parmesan cheese, lovely plump cherry tomatoes and loads of bacon chunks. What can go wrong? Loved this dish!

*Grilled fish and veggies : I liked this dish.

*Walnut brownie with chocolate sauce : This dessert was oh so yum. Warm and gooey in the middle, with that chocolate sauce sipping through the surface, It was lovely!

The owner was cherry in the icing. Such a nice and genuine gentleman. Loved interacting with him. Do drop in, this pujo for a nice adda over food with friends!

In this clutter of ever growing cafes comes Mad Hatter's . The owners want to portray the cafe as "a home away from home". The new inclusions in their summer menu is all about fresh ingredients and some beautiful drinks that is meant to provide relief from the sweltering heat.
Drinks-
Cool Rita: A refreshing drink made with fresh lime juice and orange juice
Sinless Mojito: The mint and lemon Mojito is soothing .
The soups that are included in the menu are a departure from the mundane.
Of the four kinds of soups that I tried I absolutely recommend the 'simple fish soup', a light clear broth with shredded fish.
The curry soup is a thick soup infused with green apple chunks.
The Italian Delight is a light summer broth with vegetable chunks. This is a perfect blend of health and taste.
In summer salads are important part of our diet. Thus "Madhatter's " have introduced a number of fresh salads in their menu.
My personal favourite is the 'Moroccon Shrimp Salad', a salad prepared with khuskhus, bell pepper and shrimps.
The ' kabuli Salad' is much like alu kabli, made with shredded Julian ginger, boiled potatoes and kabli
If you love fruits in your salad try the Mediterranean salad.
They have in their menu a series of gourmet burgers, which are served with French fries.
Apart from their new inclusions they have in their menu a continental thali
So if you want to eat some delicious fresh healtby and want to ample your time in a place which is not noisy then 'Madhatter's ' is the ideal place e for you.
Location-Take the lane next to six ballygunge place and then turn left.

A bunch of was walked in to this quirky place. This is near 6 Ballygunj place. The ambiance is soothing with the light colours of the wall. The food was amazing.
We started of with cream of mushroom soup with croutons. The croutons on dipped in the soup retained its crunchiness.
Then came a veg walnut salad and potato bacon salad.
The vinaigrette of the veg salad was perfectly balanced.
The potato bacon salad was creamy and had generous portions of bacon on it. Trust me they give a lot. The quantity is very good.
Them came the pujo special chop platter. The veg one had paneer and potato mushroom chop. While the non veg platter had chicken fried 2 ways.
The show stopper for me was the pasta
 Fettucini with cherry tomatoes and bacon on the side to top it with. My time was over so I couldn't try the other items. Will be visiting real soon to try the grilled fish and desserts.

A cozy restaurant with wonderful food! The Ham and Bacon Salad was delicious. The ingredients were all fresh and the portions filling. ¬†The salad was great, but the main course was out of this world! The lamb chops were soft and succulent...Cooked to perfection. One of the best I've had in Kolkata in recent memory. ¬†My friend ordered the pasta with pesto sauce. You can customize your dishes as you want and add a variety of toppings. The pasta too was tasty and the flavours were intense.¬†
The service was prompt and friendly. ¬†A high quality destination where you're spoiled for choice. Overall, a great place to visit. Can't wait to dig in soon again!

Discover this cozy corner in a by lane of Ballygunge Place  and you will not feel "effort gone wasted". Being a neighbour, we just walked to see how the place has come up...got into an impromptu munch in over some soups & sandwiches & I must admit, they're made with a lot of care. The decor, the taste (both food & for interiors) gives you a good feel to return to the place. We are yet to try the main food, but the warmth & eagerness of the owner to understand what you might like & suggest says that we will not be disappointed. Loved the place

An amazing joint in an area which was long denied of a quaint and warm place like this. What's not to love about The Mad Hatters? Warm and cosy interiors, tasty and fresh food and impeccable service makes it a must visit. Tried the ham and cheese sandwich and home style tea. The sandwich was delicious and presentation great. Keep up the good work! 
With the summer menu...  They have introduced cool drinks and absolutely light soups which are delicious.  The salads too are fresh and yummy.
