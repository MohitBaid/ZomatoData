Limelight Restaurant & Bar, a famous restaurant , located near BBD Bagh square is mostly  crowded by office goers.

Ambience is fine with cosy sitting arrangements.

Staffs were cordial & service was fast

We ordered fresh lime soda which was appetising & enjoyable . Chicken grilled sandwich , which had nice fillings and was nice & soft. Mixed chowmein was a bit oily, but had generous fillings and was palatable.

Pocket pinch is bit high but food is good.

One can visit this place if one is nearby.

অফিস পাড়ার রেস্তরাঁ বলা যায় । বাবার হাত ধরে প্রথম প্রবেশ । তারপর ফ্রায়েড রাইস আর চিলি চিকেন । সঙ্গে রুমালি রুটি । চিলি চিকেন টা একটু তেলযুক্ত । তবে  ফ্রায়েড রাইস উচ্চমানের ।

Limelight Restaurant and Bar is very near to BBD Bagh Square or Millennium Park. The place is beautifully lit up with rice lights. Inside ambiance is good.
I tried Chinese here and the food was good. Took Pepper Chicken, Chilli Garlic Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice and Mixed Noodles. Both were cooked well and was good to taste. Pepper Chicken was really nice. Quantity of one dish was sufficient to serve two adults.
Prices seems to be bit higher. Their service is no doubt good.

Situated opposite telephone Bhawan. Limelight is just like a normal bar with restaurant. The rates of the booze are reasonable. The taste of the food is average but the service here is really very clumsy .

This restaurant is just a 5 minutes walk from my office that's the reason I have tried almost every dish here. But I found the continental dishes more palatable. Mexican rice with devil's chicken is my personal favorite. Apart from that chicken stragonoff and Korean rice r also worth trying. Ambience is like any other restaurant and the outward appearance is not eye catching but that doesn't affect the quality of food they serve. Service time is good that means u can take a quick break from office and have a grub here..So loosen up ur belts and try out!
