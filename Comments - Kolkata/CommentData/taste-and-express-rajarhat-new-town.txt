Situated outside the Axis mall entrance, this is a small counter which servers few fast food. I have tasted the pav bhaji, pasta with white sauce and papri chat. I loved the pasta with ¬†white sauce.

Located  on the outer side of the axis mall ,it's a very small food stall .They offer quick bites. Food is good. They prepare the juices out of fresh fruits. Negative point is that they don't have any seating arrangements. We ordered fresh lime soda and mango juice. Taste is good. The pricing is accordingly fair.
