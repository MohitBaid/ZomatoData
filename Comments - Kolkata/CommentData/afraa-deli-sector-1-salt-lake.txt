I took the breakfast veg board and it was sufficient for two people. Its good enough to give your weekends a perfect start. 

Everything tasted good and was worth the long wait.

P.S - the place remains a little crowded on weekends so they may take some time to serve.

Been afraa deli (cc1&cc2 both) a couple of time for coffee. Decent place. Friendly staffs. Tried cappuccino and caf√© latte b4. Today we had hot chocolate. Not the best, had better here in kolkata. It was lite but tasty, not that bad for such a cold day.

A decent place to have some quick bites. The interiors are impressive and gives you a good feel of the cafe. The service is pretty good and fast. The only thing that I felt was that the price was not justified to the quantity of food offered. I felt I could expect some more options in the food menu which was a bit lighter on the pockets.

They are never open fully before 10. Customers are made to wait when they arrive for breakfast. Often denied entrance. Staff flatly tells that service not available before 10

Located in the ground floor of City Center, this place has a lovely ambiance and the right kind of food for a little chit chat with a couple of friends. The outdoor seating gives a nice view of the mall. There is limited indoor seating arrangement too. The food is fairly good. I love their fish and chips particularly. Their fowl cutlet on the other hand, did not quite appeal to my taste buds. The Deli's signature dish, which is a combination of tiny chops, sausages, little fish fries and other goodies is a heavenly delight. 
The service is pretty good. The presentation of the food is extremely appetizing. The prices are on the higher side.

I was really impressed how they were able to serve so fast in such small outlet. The food was great and so was the service. I would love to have more when it comes to variety. I will definitely recommend a must go when you are around salt lake area.

Straight in Rajarhat on the ground floor of City Centre is  this beautiful caf√© located. This has to be my personal  favourite caf√© in town .  The ambience here is homey but funky too at the same time, a perfect place to hangout with your friends and family.  The staff here are probably the most diligent and attentive people you'll ever come across. Coming to the food here , take it from me the 'fish and chips' here literally seals the deal . The burgers and pastas  always seem to score a homerun. Afraa has a wide range of salads and mocktails that never seem to disappoint. But my favourite section is the desert section here, the apple pies and the rainbow cakes are the prettiest and the tastiest desserts you'll ever have on your plate.

This is a very small cafe on the ground floor of City Center. Went there for lunch. Ordered a Tuscan salad, penne pasta in pesto sauce and hazelnut coffee. The salad was not so good, seemed oily and bland, but the pasta was tasty. The coffee was okay, not the best I've had. Also had a slice of apple pie, which was really tasty.
As for the cafe itself, although it's very small, it was difficult to get the attention of the staffs. Overall it's a cozy place.

With just 2 months left for the Christmas and New Year , Afra Deli, City Centre 1 began the celebrations with the grand Christmas Cake Mixing Ceremony. There can not be a better way to bring in the festive mood and make merry. I was present with my team #MunchingMonks who alongwith the chefs and staff, took part in the fun filled ceremony donning aprons, caps and gloves. The various ingredients used for the mixing were: Broken Cashew nuts, Candied Orange Peels ‚Äì Coloured, Dry Cherry,Raisin,Black Currant,Tutty Fruity,Almond,Dates,Orange Juice,Apple Juice,Honey,Rum,Brandy,Red Wine,White Wine,Cinnamon,Cloves,Small Cardamoms, ‚Äã,Nutmeg,Star Anise,Figs, and Candied Fruits ‚Äì Petha. It was an immense amount of fun to mix huge portions of all these ingredients with the best of liquors available. This mixture would be preserved for about 2 months and then will be added to the dough to bake delicious plum cakes for Christmas and New Year Celebrations.
Thank you Chef Sumanta, Chef Soumyajit and Afraa Deli Management for inviting us. 
Thanks to Kavita Maity for the great hospitality. It was a delight to be a part of  a celebration.

Cake mixing marks the beginning of the winter festive christmas. Since my growing up days I always wished to visit a cake mixing ceremony but I was not getting an opportunity. It was a special experience at the afraa deli cake mixing ceremony. Our group Munching Monks along with team karjoner kolom (an upcoming bengali movie) were invited to witness the ceremony. Media coverage was done by The Times of India, T2 and 24 Ghanta. The dry fruits like broken cashew nuts, almond, dates, tuity fruity, black current, raisin etc are soaked in rum, whiskey, gin, fruit juice, wine, honey. The soaked dry fruits will be preserved for a month before the final bake.

This little cute coffeeshop is our favourite spot in the city to spend a lazy afternoon.We prefer the alfresco section as it feels really nice to gaze at the busy life passing by,the crowded mall and its surrounding while sitting idly  amidst nature sipping my favourite cappuccino.So, whenever we are in CC1 we make out some time to spend here.Though the cozy interior also gives a warm shelter in the winter evenings ,we try to get a seat at the porch at least till December.
For food, there is the assurance of quality every time you order something.Also here you can get good yummy food according to your every mood and requirement. From different salads to pizzas,pastas, cutlets,Wraps & Sandwiches.. of Continental,Indian  and Oriental flavours....you will get everything at a single stop.So it will always cater your choice whatever be your requirement.
The grilled chicken sandwich with pesto sauce      and the Balsamic Sandwich are two of our favourites. The quantity is more than sufficient for one person.So you can always share it if you have a lesser appetite.Both the chicken patty and the fish 'n chips are mouthwatering accompaniments with your afternoon coffee or masala tea.They also make awesome pasta... be it spaghetti aglio e olio or penne in white sauce with chicken and mushroom the  preparation is alway lip-smacking.Many a time we have ordered pizzas too.It is the same thin crust authentic Italian style base that you will get in the restaurant upstairs .The choice of toppings is yours.The flexibility of option is really nice to enjoy.
For beverage, my all time favourite is the hazelnut flavoured Americano. I have never found this  perfect delicate  balance anywhere in the  city except this outlet (even very few coffeeshops have it in their menu).
The food counter adjoining the open kitchen displays an array of specialty breads and other bakery items including exclusive brownies and muffins to accompany your cup of coffee.
Regarding service there is a severe lack of consecutivity. We often get the second or third item even after 30 to 40 minutes of the arrival of the first one though all of them were ordered  together.Either you will have to wait and wait and wait till one of your friend or family members finishes his/her own food or have to share whatever has appeared first. Surely the small kitchen is not the cause of it.Because at that time span several other orders come at other tables.May be a single person preparing all the items ordered  from a single table causes the problem. We have complained it several times but faced the same problem again at our next visit.

Now let's coming to the food it is always satisfied my taste buds be it anytime of the day.. I ordered pasta with white sauce.It was nice thick and creamy.
The beverage was very refreshing..Pizza was crunchy and thin..
And now let's come to the dessert part last but not least the brownie with vanilla ice cream was absolutely heavenly...
All in all Aftab Deli offers good quality food at a pricey range..It's worth the experience....

The ambience of the inner space of the small restaurant is just fine. The food is also tasty but a little overpriced as compared to the quality. I like hanging out here when I am free and have time to pass. The inner AC area is really small so it gets crowded easily. I have tried the wings of fire here and it's a tangy sweet preparation of chicken which is decent to taste and the cucumber splash and lemongrass cooler are greatly refreshing for summer! The honey French fries was a different preparation but again moderate. I would like to try other different dishes here soon.

One of the nicer cafes at cc1 , the outer seating with high benches is a perfect spot for long conversations over coffee on a good weather day , while the  small air-conditioned inside holds few tables , a bakery display with lucrative pastries and the kitchen. i have tried sevaral items from the bakery , worth mentioning is their Apple Pie , the others namely the Mango Mud cake slice , kitkat mousse , red velvet cake were nice , the rainbow pastry seemed quite dry though. Capuccino and Cafe latte were decent , some latte art would do better. Among food items, their pesto grilled chicken sandwich was stunning , but the chicken ham pizza was dissatisfactory , not the toppings and cheese which were given in abundance , but the crust tasted like some old stocked readymade pizza bread which none of us liked.

Really nice ambience that has a rustic charm to it. We ordered 2 pastas, one portion of chicken wings and a chicken wrap. Pastas were very good, especially the white sauce one. Chicken wings were okay, and the cheddar filled wrap was a surprise! The portions (other than the pasta) could have been better, though.

I wouldn't say I like this place and wouldn't definitely opt for a revisit. The cafe has indoor sitting area and outdoor sitting area. It was hot, we wanted to sit inside but then we saw there are only a few tables, that too are already filled. So we had to sit outside. 
Coming to food we ordered Red velvet cupcake and Apple pie. The cupcake looked pretty. It is nicely crafted with whipped cream and has a layer of Strawberry flavored white chocolate on the top, tasted good as well. The Apple pie tasted okayish. I would prefer some other cafe next time onwards to fulfill my cupcake cravings.

If you are really fond of outdoor seating this is a nice place to hit when the weather is favorable. 
Service is bit slow. 
Foods are really sumptuous. 
Go for the pizza they are exquisite. 
There were four of us and the bill was nearly 1800 including tax.

A cute little place located on the ground floor of G block City centre, salt lake.
It has an outdoor seating and an indoor seating. Since it was raining heavily, indoor was the only option available. It's a very small place with an open kitchen and 5-6 tables.

We ordered for spaghetti in creamy pesto with mushrooms, chicken, onions and extra cheese. The portion they served was huge. It was more than for two people. It came with a toast. Two people will feel stuffed after having that.

Since we already placed the order for a 10 inch thin crust pizza with egg and Chicken, we had to eat it. The pizza spoilt my taste buds. It was hard. It was bland. I couldn't eat it. It was so so bad.
The only reason that I gave them a 3.5 is because you can make your own pizza and pasta. Second, the portions are huge for that price. Third, the staffs are really welcoming.

The restaurant is located at the ground floor of the afraa building at city centre.

A very good place to hangout with friends for breakfast or evening snacks. The first thing you notice¬†
about the place is their outdoor seating arrangement

One of the best place in the town if you are looking for a classy cafe..

¬†They have launched their breakfast platter.Their american breakfast  is amazing.¬†

I went to Afraa for a quick bite with a friend, and that's important in this review because when you go to dine with someone, the least you can expect is that the food will arrive for both together. Sadly, that didn't happen. My friend ordered an English breakfast, and I ordered a prawn starter. They served the English breakfast first, and it took them 20 min to serve two sunny side up eggs, 2 breads, two sausages, and a hash brown. The next dish came in another 20 min later; my friend was almost done. A gap of five mins is still something one can bear, but to serve food to two diner at a gap of almost half an hour is unacceptable.
Now, let's come to the food. There's nothing to say about the English breakfast, except, the pork sausage was one of those pre-cooked sausages from the super market, that look like boiled meat. The juice that came with it was not cold. It was at room temperature. I did not know that is how juice is served.
The prawn dish was excessively sweet, and I didn't like it at all. The prawns were overcooked, had no taste or flavour, and had the texture of what frozen elastic bands would probably taste like when deep-fried.
The portion sizes were quite small, as well. The only thing good was the politeness of the staff members. But altogether, I was deeply disappointed with the food and service.

Good food, good ambience. I ordered an English breakfast while my friend ordered a üç§ shrimp based dish.
My food items were pretty good - sausages,hash brown, toast and eggs sunny side up . I especially loved the orange juice that was the part of the breakfast.
However my friend didn't seem very impressed with the shrimp.
Pocket pinch - for the order it was nearly 700.

For any service industry, customer attention is very crucial. Even with good food, this chain fails to deliver customer satisfaction with highly untrained staff. Please train your staff about the food and how to take an order without being inept. It's such a pity that a place which serves good food has people who can't serve well. :(

Afraa Deli is located City Centre - 1 Salt lake.  I've visited With my friends Yesterday. First off all Ambiance of this Restaurant is good but it is very small outlet. They have few number of Seating arrangement. Here We orederd Some Mojito like 1. Water Mellon Mimosa 2. Fizze Orange.  Both are very Tasty. Both are Summer Special Mojito. Price is Reasonable and Service is Good.

Afraa deli is just like the next door coffee shop which has got bits and pieces of all a nice coffee shop should have, but not excelling in anything particular. The outdoor seating is good, the indoor is cramped a bit.we ordered grilled chicken sandwich and non veg platter. Service was quick. The waiter helped with the order. 
The sandwich was good, but there was nothing special about it. They did not have the sausage for the platter so they replaced it with fish chops - they asked us of course, but they asked only after they had prepared the dish and brought it to us. The platter was decent, nothing much to write about. The staff was very cordial and helped us feel comfortable with the baby stroller amidst their cramped interior.

Had the deli's signature non veg platter,marinated chicken with corn flakes rolled over in pesto sauce,fish n chips,cappuccino and chocolate brownie shake.
Love the food. Hope to visit again soon. :)

Afraa Deli is like Manoj Tiwary in Ranji Trophy. Scores meaningless runs. The English breakfast is made just for the sake of it, in the name of Darjeeling they just throw some random tea bag. The sausage is soaked in oil. This 2.5 is solely for the ambience which reminds me of Bangalore where I hail from.

Never thought the standard of Afraa Deli has deteriorated like this. I had the worst chicken cutlet of my life here (which is named as fowl play and literally foul as hell).
The blueberry smoothie was not up to the mark. The non veg soup was just a soup of extremely sick patient of a hospital.
I'm not showing them my face again. Adieu.

Ask for a personalised black coffee or Darjeeling tea from Ithirat Hussain.

The chicken pizza and bowl of clear soup is a specialty of Chef Nawab. Simply awesome and
a must try.

As the regular visits continue, the boys and chefs@ afraa deli continue to deliver world class service and food. Pizzas remain world class and as on this 2nd day of Feb,2017 they are best in class in Kolkata@Subhashish

Afraa deli being an old favourite of people of Kolkata. We came with a set of expectations that weren't completely met. The service was good and satisfactory but the food was not. With a history of having some of the better pizzas in the city, the quality this time was dismal. The cheddar cheese sandwich however was filling and quite tasty.

The first thing about this restaurant is that, I find it very very expensive. Why would I pay around 100 bucks for a simple darjeeling tea? I don't even know that is darjeeling tea. The coffee is pretty ordinary. The only thing is ambience which is good but only if you sit outside.

Simple and Subtle.. the chicken wings were delicious, the salads were good too.A cozy ambience. However the man serving us were too eager to take our plates away, when evidently we were not done with our meals.. Well that was surprising, considering there was no rush at all in the cafe at that point.

Really bad service. Ordered a pizza but they forgot about it and when reminded they made the pizza in a hurry which was not baked properly and the dough wasn't cooked. The bread served with the pasta was old. To top all of this an extra item was added to my bill which I hadn't ordered. Overall over priced, bad service and food!

A cozy nook within 500 meters of a bookstore with outdoor seating capacity near an Antique store-the Deli could not have chosen a better location. The service was prompt, the place neat and the food fresh and delicious. We ordered the following:
1. Chicken salad with caramelized pineapple: The salad was made with fresh ingredients and the meat portion was wholesome. The pineapple was soft and caramelized to perfection, with the sweetness balanced by a tinge of fresh vinegar. The garnish was just right. Overall representation of the dish was professional, with a wedge of toasted bread by the side.
2. Spaghetti with arabiatta sauce and ham: I would recommend this pasta as the perfect embodiment of Italian cuisine. Rarely in Calcutta have I eaten a pasta so well-cooked to perfection, with the right balance in sweet and sour. The arabiatta had the right texture. Arguably, the sauce was a bit heavy (maybe the chef was too generous with the olive oil). The pasta had basil and mushrooms and wholesome chunks of ham. It was accompanied with an enticing aroma of fresh herbs. Personally, I would recommend a more generous infusion of wine to balance the spice.

3. Pizza with jalapenos, brocolli, and onions- The thin-crust pizza was well-done. It was a nice (and thankful) change from the usual Pizza Hut. The crust was crunchy and the cheese was in right proportion.
4. Garlic bread- Toasted to perfection, with the perfect aroma of butter, salt and pepper, and garlic.¬†
Overall:¬†
Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 4.5/5 (Includes preparation, taste, choice of ingredients)
Location: 4/5¬†
Highly recommended
Pocket-friendly (the whole meal cost 1089 including tax)

The first thing you will find charming about this place is, it doesn't feel like you're in the middle of ¬†a shopping mall. The outdoor sitting has a nice foliage over it which provides enough shade. It is small but well decorated and the place feels cozy. The food is somewhere between okay-ish but good if compared with the price.

Not a bad place to visit to get away from the crowd and savor some delicious mouthfuls.

Christmas Cake mix ready @ Afraa Deli, Salt Lake..!

Jingling all the way ‚Äì the city smells of plum cakes, because Christmas is knocking on the doors. Christmas marks the onset of the Harvest ceremony¬† and thus lots of assorted fruits and nuts is thus variegated to give rice to the traditional plum cake. The stirring ceremony held on 15th of November is a part of an age-old Christmas tradition of cake mixing where wine and liquor is added to the ingredients of the festive fruit cake in advance to develop aroma and taste. After which fresh juices , honey and freshly ground spices are added until the fruits and nuts are well coated. And thus leads to the sinful and¬† sumptuous Christmas plum cakes.
                                                                ...

This place should be considered for brunches or light dinners. The ambience is ideal for a family outing, with light music and not too much noise. We had gone for a late lunch and the place looked very warm from inside, especially near the window seats.

We ordered a Cucumber Splash, Fresh Lime soda, Garlic bread, Tuscan Fried Bread Panzanella Salad and Penne Arabiatta pasta and Apple Pie. Everything tasted good, especially the salad and garlic bread.¬†

The staff is prompt and it is almost live cooking.It was a good experience and not very expensive. Hope to be back soon

Decided to grab some food here after watching a movie nearby. This place offers outdoor as well as indoor seating. We chose to sat indoors. The d√©cor had a wooden theme and was simple in nature. The ambience called for a nice quiet meal over some chitchat with friends or a date. We had ordered the Panzanella chicken salad and Spaghetti with cheesy sauce along with mushrooms,babycorn and broccoli. This place was very fast in terms of its service as my salad arrived within 3-4 minutes of my having ordered it. The salad was dominated by lettuce leaves along with black olives,capsicum,bell peppers and a hefty amount of grilled chicken pieces. It had vinegarette dressing and came with a piece of crisp toast. To my utter amazement and delight,it tasted superb inspire of being a salad. The chicken pieces were well grilled and the salad was dressed with just the right amount of vinegar and lemon. The black olives in the salad tasted especially good. The spaghetti in cheesy sauce was another delight on the taste buds. It was quite cheesy and filling,without being bland. It tasted even better with some oregano sprinkled on top. We finished our meal with a Rainbow Pastry. It was a considerably big sized pastry consisting of layers of chocolate,mango,and probably red velvet cake,with fillings of whipped cream in between each layer. The top of the pastry had a sort of mango flavoured jelly which was yummy and it was garnished with a small white chocolate square along with some chocolate sauce drizzled on top. That pastry was top notch! The pocket pinch was moderate üòÉ

Located amidst the hustle bustle of City Centre, lies in a tiny little corner Afraa¬†Deli. The first thing you notice about the place is their outdoor seating arrangement, designed to provide you with good food under a not-so-starry sky. Well, since there are no stars, you shift to indoors and find this cute place with soothing lightings. Nicely done interiors.¬†

In a moment, the fragrance emanating from the open kitchen makes you instantly hungry and you(or rather I) order a Penne Pasta with creamy pesto sauce, a Spaghetti Pasta with cheese sauce, and a Deli signature cold coffee. You could customise your pasta which makes it even more satisfying.¬†

Hands down, the food was great. One of the better pasta I have had in the city. Served in mason jars, the beverage was equally good. Not too sweet, not too damn bitter.¬†

Not so fast service, but then the place was crowded when I visited it. Standard pricing which doesn't burn a hole in your pockets and a nice chatty environment, suitable for hangouts. A Deli worth visiting regularly.

We went there during the breakfast hour. The place is quite small and they need to pay attention to their ventilation. The fumes from the kitchen area made my eyes water throughout the time I was there. Otherwise a wide selection of breakfast items which are made fresh and are served in good portions.

Staff service is very poor. Had to ask water everytime. Asked him to keep a jug or a bottle but he never listened.

Talking abt food.
Pizza - absolutely raw. Seemed like we were just eating bread.
Pasta - the gravy sucked. Try urself and you will be shocked.
Soup - seemed like water. Not at all thick.
French fries- okay because no extra skill is required to make this.
Coffee- asked him to make strong coffee. He made a light one. It was just edible although nothing special. You can make a better coffee at home easily.
Desert- brownie with icecream . brownie was good. Vanilla ice cream didnt taste good as well.

Adding photos just for reporting that i was actually there. Cam quality wasnt good so dont see the pictures.

I went to afraa couple of time for hookah and everytime I went there I had a a terrible headache. Initially I thought it was only me but later I realised that the same thing had happened with my friends who were with me. When we started asking others, people have experienced similar headaches but have ignored. 

Probably they are mixing something in hookah. Never order hookah at this place.

Located inside the CC1, just beside the Apollo clinic, Afraa Deli is such a warm cafe. It's not so big but when you'd enter into the place it'll surely give you a cordial kind of feel. We ordered cappuccinos and sandwitches and the breakfast was really good. They served us 3 kind of sauce with the sandwitches & those were out of the box indeed !¬†It's a small but cute cafe where you could come, enjoy the snacks and do a long adda.

Located inside the city centre mall...the place is always packed. Getting an indoor sitting is difficult but I have been lucky on all the occasions. Their outdoor sitting is good.I have edited my review since today i went there and it was not crowded...still servers took 10 minutes to give the menu...not only that ...they forgot my drink where in i just ordered for 2 dishes and a drink. disappointing. 
A decent place serving good pastries.....nice food. Breads are nice and can be purchased to make good sandwiches at home. 
coming to the items:
1. Blueberry marshmallow smoothie: was more of milk and marshmallow. Was bad.
2. Cold coffee: lacked the coffee flavour. Bad.
3. Breads: fresh and soft
4. Garlic bread: good
5. Chicken burger: nice taste. Good to eat. Nothing extraordinary.
6. Sandwiches are tasty.
7. vada pav- good

Decent place.

Went here for breakfast. Cool place. We had ordered for the English breakfast, the chicken and coleslaw sandwich, with tea and the Irish caf√©. Food was on the okayish side with the coffee being exceptionally good. But the only problem was the service. Just two people. The whole staff consisted of two people! The chef and another man who did the cleaning, waiting on tables and every other thing. While we did not have to wait much for our food, but he did make a delay for our beverages. Completely forgot about it. Ended up feeling bad for him. You guys can sure try it out.

First of all the behaviour of the staffs are very nice. They are well mannered and not so uber cool sort of.
The food is good. Atmosphere is well acceptable. There is a outdoor seating arrangement also. I would recommend everyone to go.

Afraa Deli is organising a burger festival with some varied selection of burgers, & invited our group PanchPhoron to try those out. The festival is being organised at every outlet of Afraa Deli namely CC1, CC2, Ecospace & Park Circus untill September 18th, 2016.
Coming to the burgers, there are 5 on offer. Interestingly the buns have been coloured (with edible pigments), green denoting the veg (of course), orange denoting the chicken ( a welcome change from red) & white for the fish ( hmm). By the look of it every burger seemed to be loaded with cheese, mayo & veggies apart from the advertised filling. It was time to dig in & find out whether they stood up to what they looked like.

This little cafe in the ground floor of city centre has a very feel good vibe going on. The decor is very minimal but elegant. This place offers an open air seating as well. They have an open kitchen so you can see your food being cooked in front of you.The waiters are very friendly and helpful. We ordered the American breakfast platter and pasta in cream cheese sauce. The platter had two toasts which were quite crunchy, a sunny side up, two sausages and two aloo tikkis.The platter was very filling and perfect for an early breakfast.The sausages were fresh and extremely soft. But the cream cheese pasta stole the show. It was rich and full of melted cheese. It is very filling and I savoured it for a long time. The place is perfect for dates as well as for long sessions of chit chats with friends. But the best part about this place is that you can come alone and sip a beer and read a book and have the perfect date with yourself. :)

Afraa Deli is a tiny eatery located in City Centre ‚Äì I in the same building as Afraa. I have come here a couple of times with friends (whenever a seating had been available). I love the pasta here ‚Äì the penne in cream sauce is one of my favourites. The black forest pastry is good as well. The caf√© is pretty but very small, so do come here early and grab your seats!

This is where we hang out almost every Saturday. Very well behaved staff and decent food. I was disappointed only once when I tried their English breakfast, the quality could definitely improve. But to be fair to them that was a year ago, and I didn't have that again so can't comment on its present quality. But I can definitely vouch for their cold coffees, pasta, hot dogs, pies and pastries.

I went with two friends, on Sunday evening. We ordered a few beverages , Classic Ceasar Salad (vegetarian) version, and the Mumbai Express sandwich. The sandwich was just alright, but ¬†the salad was rather disappointing. ¬†For reason's best known to the Deli the Classic Ceasar's Salad had assorted vegetables such as Baby Corn, Broccoli & Zucchini. The lettuce was anything but crisp. The dressing was an overdose of Thousand Island and the parmesan was hardly there. Clearly, they have made their own recipe for a classic salad, which seems to have no resemblance to the real stuff. The salad is made of crisp romaine lettuce with croutons, and not with assorted vegetables. The dressing is olive oil, mustard and mayonnaise and not Thousand Island. ¬†Get your facts in order. If you don't know Google. Not difficult. Further, the cafe seems to suffer from the quintessential problem of Calcutta of no change available. They couldn't provide a change of 300 something to a bill of 600 something that was paid by 1000/- Sigh ! Don't see myself visiting again, ever.

Heard a lot about this place so thought of visiting it once! But as I did, I was quite unsatisfied with the whole array. The place is quite clumsy and is very small from inside. Though the interior is quite commendable. I wanted to order a cake for my birthday but they couldn't provide me any from the menu. They had none. The pastry that I ordered later was over heated up. Moreover they couldn't serve me few items that I instructed.

Sipping on a piping hot Clear Chicken Soup with the pitter-patter of raindrops in the background-what else can be called divine!!!Yes,that's what Afraa Deli is for me!Loved whatever we two ordered.The Chicken Sandwiches were as usual, nothing extraordinary. The potato wedges(wrongly mentioned in the menu as French Fries)were soft tender and went perfectly with the soup.But the best part came right after: Chicken Penne Pasta in Cheese Pesto.I'm still awestruck with the taste!Forget about the calorie bite,just savour the taste, you won't regret,trust me!Also tried the Peach Ice Tea served in beautiful mini bottles.It was lovely.Only the staff took a lot longer than usual to serve the beverages.It was a Thurs dinner date with my hubby,both of us didn't expect the place to be thronged but unfortunately we had to wait little longer before we could get a seat.The cafe seemed to be understaffed and hence the rush.There are provisions to sit in their open arena too.The only suggestion to Afraa Deli-please grow the cafe to be more spacious to accomodate all the delectables you serve.
Can't comment on the pocket pinch since we went through a deal.But overall it was a lovely experience and I'm surely gonna head to this place again n' again.
2nd visit on 28th July'16:
Orders: Potato wedges,peach ice tea,chicken clear soup,aglio olio,pasta in cheese sauce,vanilla with brownie.
Experience: Not satisfactory as that of the 1st one. Reminiscing about the lovely Peach Ice Tea we had last time, we again ordered 2 such.But the flavors were so intense that I didn't enjoy it at all.We ordered pizza.Initially though assured later came to know pizza is unavailable because of their non operational oven.So we ordered aglio olio besides pasta in cheese sauce.Aglio olio was just fine,but not half as good as the cheese pasta.
Favorite pick/s of the day: Pasta in cheese sauce and the dessert.The pasta was so filing for two of us and I'm still awestruck with the taste!!

Pasta, nowadays, has turned out to be a very common dish available almost in every cafe or continental restaurant in the city. But rarely would one expect to find something other than penne or spaghetti in Arrabbiata, Pesto or Bolognese sauces. These have turned too mainstream nowadays and pasta lovers in the city are craving for something unique and different. In this scenario, Afraa Deli has come up with its Pasta Festival, launching eight exclusive pastas in their menu. I was invited here as a member of ‚ÄòPaanchphoron‚Äô to taste the amazing range of pastas.

I used to love this place.. fine coffee and great burgers and oh so lovely macaroons. Excellent location and ambiance.

However, the past few visits have changed my perception and my last visit have made me realise that I don't want to come back. 

the quality of food has gone down tremendously in past few months.. nothing tastes the same and the worst part of the restaurant is the service!! I received stone cold cappuccino once and an aweful tasting sandwich. 

Their service has always been slow, because i believe some things are prepared in their kitchen on the 8th floor. But it has reached monumental heights these days!

Last week, while I was waiting for my doctors appointment, I decided to have breakfast there, I was kept waiting for more than 30 minutes for a cafe latte and beans on toast! what was more infuriating is that they served everyone who came after me.. and when I complained about it showed no remorse and courtesy; that's when i decided to get up and leave.

Really bad service! 

Buck up! you have just lost one loyal customer. I anyway preferred the Afraa Creperie over the Deli, but after last week no more!

I stepped into this outlet of the Afraa Deli, only last Sunday, when I was going about the Chinese food festival. I stepped in for a bit of relief from the humidity and the rising temperature, planning on treating myself to a tall glass of beverage, but ended up munching on some yummy deserts as well. This outlet of the Afraa Deli has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Both are extremely welcoming, but I did settle for indoors, solely to escape the afternoon heat. 

Food:

As we settled in, we ordered a peach iced tea, virgin mojito and a chilled mango juice. While there is nothing special to mention about the mango juice (poured from a carton of store bought juice) the other two beverages were really nice. The virgin mojito was packed with bruised limes and mint leaves and the flavor came through quite strongly, absolutely loved it. The peach iced tea had a distinct taste of the peach syrup. Though intended to be sweet, it wasn't too sugary. Just enough to bring refreshment to the drinker.¬† We also ordered the chocolate truffle pastry with ice cream. This on the other hand was not as satisfactory as it managed to look, but wasn't bad either.

Service:

I loves the way the beverages were served in different holders. The milk bottle used to serve the mango juice instantly stole my attention. The mason jars too looked great holding their respective beverages. 

The service is slower than what you would expects in an outlet that is so highly visited. People take all their life to heat a pastry through, put a dollop of ice cream on a plate with it and serve it on the table. When they manage to do so, they make sure that they have heated the cake enough to turn it into a puddle. 

Suggestion:

The service needs to be faster, everything else falls into place.

Though I have spent my childhood in Salt Lake, the road map is a difficult maize for me. Located in City centre ground floor, Afraa Deli will draw your attention effortlessly.

I had a visitor and post shopping we decided to munch on crispy stuff. We ended up going here. Though it has sitting arrangements outside, we preferred to sit in. It's a small cozy place and almost all seats were full. I personally don't like lights. The yellow low/dim light served my mood.

Under the SNACK SHACK option, we opted for Potato wedges, Crumb fried chicken with caesar dressing, Wings of fire: marinated chilli chicken wings with dry fried in the garlic( I simply loved it) and a drink. The food is good and reasonably priced here. 

Keep eating!

Went there with friends on Sunday for lunch. The ambience is nice and cool. Very casual and simple seatings.
We ordered vegetable and chicken soup, not good avoid ordering. We then ordered a Veg pizza, red sauce and white sauce pasta. Very normal nothing great, just okay. We ordered a plate of French fries while waiting for the mein course, that was quite nice, crispy. We also ordered the veg Mediterranean wrap that was quite nice.
We also ordered peach and lemon Ice tea. Nothing great just okay. Finally we ordered brownie with ice cream that was quite good.
Overall it was just an okayish experience.

This is a cozy, comfy eatery with outdoor seating arrangement, in CC1. I had takeaway of veg patties from this outlet which were hot, fresh and great tasting, and also the Lemon Curd Tart that was smoothly soft and lemoney and totally worth its awesome taste that leaves you with a warm, happy, tingly feeling after consuming it. For continental snacks, baked goodies, yummy fast food and the like, this place is a worthwhile food hub to check out.

So whenever I am in City Centre I make it a point to have some coffee and munch something in Afraa Deli and then leave this mall. This place is one of my favourite coffee joints in Kolkata. The ambience, service, food is just amazing. Though sometimes it gets a bit irritating when we don't get to sit inside because of the crowd. Always crowded!! But the food makes me forget everything it's just delicious.
In my last visit we had ordered for the below items:
‚Ä¢Chicken Platter - This platter has three types of chicken in it. Cornflakes coated chicken, honey glazed satay and chicken wings. All the three varieties of the chicken were amazing. The dip served along with them made them more yummy. The chicken was well cooked and tender.
‚Ä¢Bombay style grilled Sandwich - This was a simple grilled sandwich with some veggie filling inside served with hand cut potato wedges. It was simple but had its own serene taste in it.
‚Ä¢Masala Lemonade - This is a basic lemonade with a twist of jaljeera in it. It's refreshing for the summer.
‚Ä¢Peach Ice Tea - This was a peach flavoured ice tea. This tasted average though.

Overall the experience was good as always. If anyone has not paid a visit to this place then I would say you guys are really missing out on some great food. Do make a visit to this place.

A lovely place to catch up with friends. Both the interior and d outdoor space s beautifully decorated. I ordered nonveg platter which i found to be a little expensive. The food quality is good which gets me back to this cafe inspite of the price rate. The cold coffee is a bliss.

Went to this place two weeks back and let me tell you the coffee at this place is absolutely delightful. Coming to what we ordered, two Hazelnut Cr√®me Latte and chocolate muffins and something that I would like to mention specifically is, the temperature of the Lattes which was so much appropriate,  unlike most of the other cafes. The hazelnut flavor was amazing and the muffins were also good, though I did not find that afraa special amazing factor in the muffins, but it was good. The attendants were helpful and polite. I also took 4 chocolate cookies and it was really generous of them to let me taste the cookies before taking, so a brownie point for that. The prices are a little bit on the higher side but then again its Afraa so can‚Äôt do much about that. Well yes the interiors are pretty cozy and well decorated with outdoor options also, so a nice place for a romantic date or even a group hangout. Should I be going back to this place again, it‚Äôs definitely an yes as I want to try out their breakfast menu and my favorite Hazelnut Cr√®me Latte again.

I just love love Afraa Deli,located at CC1. It's a cozy little place with a small indoor seating arrangements along with an open air seating area,which is perfect for the early mornings or evenings or when you are visiting in a group as inside it doesn't have a lot of space,which is the only shortcoming of this place.The waiters here are pretty fast in terms of cooking,yes it has an open kitchen,and serving,they tend to serve with a smile but not at all over friendly which is how I like it. My all time favourite is their English breakfast,served with an egg poach,sausages,crispy toasts,coffee or a glass of juice according to your preferences.The menu is short and simple,doesn't try to confuse you at all. My next favourite is their grilled Chicken sandwich which is yummy and juicy yet perfectly grilled and the best part is doesn't crumble/crash as soon as you start eating ;) Next dish I would like to talk about is their oh-so-delicious Chicken salad which is tossed in a light lemon  dressing and served with lots of crunchy juicy bell peppers and lettuce,a yummy yet healthy option if you are looking for,then this salad is a must try for you.As for their drinks I would mention Cucumber Splash,a perfect summer drink for Kolkata climate. So when are you visiting Afraa Deli? Happy eating peeps :D

Targeting the small yet nicely decorated branch for sometime but due to kids preference overtaking mine, I was not succeeding. Finally on a Saturday I took my family there for a light lunch so we can meet the doctor at Apollo.

The decor is nice and they have open air tables as well, 

We ordered Chicken Hawaiian Salad with Pineapple, Sandwiches, Pasta with cheese sauce and french fries. Though the french fries were pretty usual but Salad and pasta were really good. Service was also good.¬†
Overall my experience was pleasant for I am definitely returning for the pasta....

Visited Afraa Deli after a long time, and found that they've changed their menu and made the dishes quite reasonable. A very nice and refreshing list of beverages. The pizza we ordered was good to taste, with thin crust. Great ambience. Ideal for friends to chat over food. Much improved. Give it a try.

The corn on toast was good but what I need to specially mention about is the Mediterranean sandwich we had. It was absolutely amazing. The blend of flavours with the zucchini and peppers was a delight for the tongue. Made my morning. Definitely will be visiting againüòä

Fowl Cutlet... Now that is music to my ears... and a burst of flavour on my palate.... The breast of chicken was tenderised to submission and seasoned with spices and herbs... Wrapped in a thin crust of bread crumbs and deep fried... Served with a side of French fries and a trio of homemade sauces.... It was a OMG moment for me and my bro... Awesomeness on a plate... Drowned with Breezer for him and a Cocktail called snake bite ( nothing as poisonous as all that)... But delicious never the less.... A quick ( or not so quick) grub at afraa deli is always a treat!!! I have been meaning to review this charming place so close to my house... And frequented by me.... But then you know... What is close by remains a tad bit neglected... Now I have done what was long overdue and I am happy....

Although this is not a complete review that can be put into reference, but something that can be granted for breakfast at Afraa Deli. We were given coupons for breakfast at Afraa after some medical tests at Apollo Clinic, so we landed up over here. They had a fixed set menu - four slices of bread, one egg, butter, sausages, a cake and a glass of fruit juice. Each of these were usual stuffs, nothing extraordinary, much to fill your appetite early in the morning after heavy courses of medical tests.
On the contrary, I had a weird experience. I was taking pictures for Zomato when a person from their authority came up to me and said that taking pictures are not allowed. When I said, this one is for Zomato review, he just shrugged and said, "Okay then but don't tell anyone." I felt a bit weird. Otherwise everything was okay. And the experience was usual. Happy Dining anyway! :)

Their savoury dishes are tasty, and the ambience is nice. They have an outdoor seating arrangement which is great for breezy evenings. But I had once ordered a Green iced Tea and it tasted like bitter water. It was not up to the mark, so it's best to be careful about what you order.

My only visit to this cozy little place has been an amazing breakfast experience. It is clearly visible due to its location at the ground floor of the Apollo Clinic building, beside The Mobile Store and overlooking the horse-drawn tram store of City Centre 1. 

This visit was actually dad's plan, and it exceeded all my expectations. One complete  ENGLISH BREAKFAST platter along with GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICHES. After adding a dash of salt, the sandwiches were amazing. The lovely amount of potato wedges beside the sandwiches brought out the biggest smiles possible. :P

It is the second time I've tried bits of the English breakfast - it was definitely satisfying. Dad had a cup of Darjeeling tea while I preferred to stick to Cappuccino. My liking inclines towards a little foam on top of the latter, but otherwise they were pretty good. 

We ended the meal with a tickle on our sweet teeth with a DARK CHOCOLATE PASTRY and a similar one of BUTTERSCOTCH flavor, both of which were amazing.

The prices were a bit heavy on the pocket considering the expenditure was about 900 bucks. I feel the money was worth everything we had. :)

Awesome breakfast place in city Centre 1. Has become my favourite. We usually order masala omelette,  served with multigrain/white bread, an aloo Tikki. It is a sumptuous meal for one. The other favourite is cheesy corn which is served with the same multigrain/white bread. The coffee is amazing. We have tried lots. The cappuccino,  mocha, Irish (the best I have had). 

Do visit here for an amazing start to your day.

Whenever I come down from Delhi, I like coming to Afraa, for the food as well as the ambience.

Today, however, I was disappointed. The tables had not been cleaned after the previous guests had left, and the man who came to clean the table left a strong whiff of an old dishrag on the glass.

The food that followed was awesome, I must admit.

The whole idea of a deli comes to life here. I am a regular here and have had almost half of the items on the menu. My personal favourites are the Chicken Salad, The Pasta Aglio Olio Pepperchino. 

Afraa is like a second home for me. The staff are very courteous and polite and the food is delicious. My last visit here was about 2 days back and this review was long over due. I love the ambience and the food. The wines are also choicest and I absolutely love the English Breakfast platter on offer.

The sausages are delicious and juicy. The hash brown finely done. 
In terms of beverages. My favourite is the Lemon Iced Tea. I come here with my fiance. And we both look forward to many many more good memories here

Went there on new years eve, didn't get the open seat. Had 2 seat inside, so cannot comment on the outside ambiance, the interior was well decorated but was cramped and filled with the cooking smell. We had chicken and egg sandwich which was paired with French fries and tasted delicious. We had chocolate and mango pastry which was enormous and tasted delicious. -0.5 for the cooking smell and gas

I really like the fact that it has outdoor seating. In this cold and pleasant weather , enjoying a hot cup of coffee is the best thing one could do. So my friend and I did exactly that. We ordered a caf√® latte and a cappuccino which basically tasted the same , and a chicken platter that had chicken cutlet , chicken wings and chicken kebab served on a stick. I really liked the sauce it was coated in , sweet and tangy. It was served with three dips - salsa , sour cream and retried beans. And it tasted really good. With a great ambience , Afraa Deli is the place to spend your evening or grab a quick bite. Or rather , just enjoy a good book with a good cup of coffee.

I love the location of this deli.Especially the outside seating which is perfect for the evenings.On a pleasant windy evening,I visited Afraa with a couple of my friends to satiate our hunger pangs.
We had ordered for a customised pizza and nachos.
The pizza came with bellpeppers,brocholli,extra cheese and babycorn topping.Well,the toppings were fresh but the flavour was mild.Also the amount of cheese felt less than adequate even after going for extra cheese as topping.

The nachos had a little melted cheese drizzled on top,served with a yoghurt dip. The nachos were crisp and quite flavourful indeed.However I still feel that some more cheese drizzled on top would have made it an ever better offering.

Overall it is a place with decent ambience and above average food . However I would suggest you to rather go for breakfast, as the experience was excellent during my last visit here.

Located in city center Salt lake, opposite the famous tram this place can't be missed. It's outside sitting is perfect for winters or cool evenings.
Have been there before but writing behalf of last 2 visits.
1st we went there to pick cold coffee, they didn't had lids & coffee was to be served in those coke printed glasses. So, I cancelled and picked pastry( sorry I don't remember) & vegetables patties. Total value for money and nice in taste.
2nd visited there with my 4 year old for Pasta, ordered Penne Arrabiata & Cold Coffee and was all satisfied with the taste.
Nice place to sit & have a bite.

The sector 1 joint of Afraa Deli is conveniently located right beside the mobile store and in front of the "tram". The ambience is cool and casual and great for fun chitchat with friends and family. The pasta is great and is my favorite, specially with creamy pesto sauce, arabbiatta and aglio olio sauces. The finger foods like garlic toast, garlic flavoured sauted mushroom are great.

In drinks my regular lemon iced tea is just as it should be, Keventers Eespeshul is a heavy yummy drink making you miss Darjeeling a lot. The Peanut butter shake is okay and needs improvement in terms of taste.
All in all, worth hanging out in Afraa.

Went there a couple of weeks back, armed with a Groupon. The menu was limited, but we had a wonderful experience. I would recommend this place to everyone, but since it lies entirely out of my price bracket, I'll pick up another Groupon for this place!

1. 2 servings of the soup of the day: Chicken clear soup; light, aromatic and heavenly. It was really quite delicious, and didn't fill us up too much.
2. French fries: simple thing, done very well. Serving is enough for two people. I really love their portions, though I would have preferred ketchup in bottles rather than pouches. I like lots (and lots) of ketchup with fries, so it's a bit of a bother to continuously open packets. But the fries were crispy and perfectly cooked.
3. Chicken pasta in mixed sauce: another yummy dish. The sauce wasn't gluggy with cheese, there were spices and other flavours too. The portion was, again, great and they gave two bits of crunchy bread with it. Chicken was soft and well cooked. We were left wiping the plate with breadcrumbs in the end.
4. Chicken pizza: I found it absolutely fantastic, but was too full to have more than 2 slices! It was a 10 inch, thin crust pizza and my boyfriend finished off the rest (though he says it could have been better). I like onion on my pizza, so I missed that. But the tomato sauce was good, and crust was light and crispy.
5. Chocolate brownie with ice cream: 
Oh. My. God.
It's a small bit of fudge brownie, the kind that sticks to your teeth. The perfect sweet ending.
6. Hot coffee: good and well made
7. Lemon ice tea: very tea-ey and not too mocktail-ey, if you know what I mean. I love tea so I enjoyed this drink.

Service: very good. Friendly. We didn't feel ostracised 'coz we availed a coupon üòÇ

Ambience: it's lovely, but tiny.  You can see all the tables, no matter where you sit inside, and you can probably hear them too. If you're on a date, better sit outside (if you don't mind the lack of back support). 

Bit of advice: order the pasta after the pizza. The creaminess is a good follow up to the crunch, but not the other way round. Also, don't order milky coffee with cheesy stuff. The tummy doesn't enjoy it much. 

The Groupon is still available for 600 bucks, so if you're cash strapped like me, go ahead and indulge! The brownie itself makes it worth it. üëÖ

The experience with Afraa Deli was pleasant. This review is based on my two times visit to this particular place and I'm satisfied with what they serve but a little disappointed over how they try to manage. It's little slow so there's room for some improvement.
Food is above average and the pasta stands out of all. The perfect taste of white sauce with pasta blends so easily in the mouth "yumm" the apt expression that comes forth.

Every item on Afraa Deli's menu from the omelettes to the salads to the pastas to the sandwiches, tastes pretty decent and comes in more than generous portions. The English Breakfast is the standout dish though. I'd also personally recommend the Three Egg Omelette which comes with a side of toasts, a hash brown, dips and with a filling of your choice like cheese or mushroom or chicken or ham. The Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, the Chicken Tikka and Egg Sandwich which comes with a side of fries, the Rosemary Potato Wedges wrapped in Chilli Barbecue Sauce, the Rasmalai Shake and the Chocolate Milk namely the Rang Rassiya and Keventer's Eeespeshul. The Chicken Cutlets which comes with three types of homemade sauce is nice too. Also love their array of desserts. 
It's cute how they have played around with the names of the dishes.
I mostly visit this place during the winter cos I love sitting in the seating arrangement outside of the Deli overlooking the Kund area. The high chairs, the open air feel, the retro-like lamp posts, even the presentation of the food like how they serve the quenchers in lil glass jars, everything appeals to me a lot. The service is a lil slow so that's the only area where there is scope for improvement. But not the kind of slow that'd bother you, so that can be overlooked. :)

Four of us met together after a long time and we sat here and chatted while we waited for the dinner time. I got a Grilled chicken, cheddar .* sandwich, an Americano, and later some Earl Grey. The coffee was not impressive, but acceptable, tea was fine, the sandwich was good too. But did not stand out. Prices are kind of okay I will tell.

But I would definitely like to visit this place again and check out some of their items and try to get if I missed something that day, and update this review.

The lunch buffet at Afraa restaurant in city centre 1 mall was a pleasant experience.
The ambience is pretty with a carefully decorated interior and a nice view of the surrounding city from a height.
The food is good with a wide variety of salads,a live egg counter and an array of desserts to boast off. The grilled fish in lemon,the chicken omlette and the blueberry cheesecake remain my favourites from the day.
Also,the lounge is an added attraction for people of all ages.The Groupon deal was the icing on the cake,so,look out for more such offers,people!
It has to be mentioned that the warm welcome by the Afraa team and their service has earned a big thumbs up!
I'll be visiting soon.
Cheers,Team.

We visited this place on a sunny Saturday morning! Relieved, because it was open (not many places serve before 10)! The best part is the seating arrangement, outdoors as well as indoors! The ambience is relaxed and not overpowering. The menu card has been designed creatively and the tags for regular dishes bring a smile to your face! Some examples- Nacho Baliye (nachos), Moja-e-Mohito (mohito)! We ordered a cappucino and fresh lime soda to sip along with nachos and cheesy garlic bread. We were satisfied with our order as both the drinks and food tasted really well! The staff was prompt when we complained about being served broken bits of nachos and replaced the platter.

This place is settled and has a very nice ambience, a place where you can go and sit for while and njoy the music, though the food is not upto the mark.

Location : Next to City Centre 1.

Afraa Deli :) Visited this place with my friends. I took them over there as it was bookmarked on my list for quite sometime now.

So to start with, the ambiance is quite chilled out and relaxing. They also have a seating area outside for open dining. The staff is on their feet, ready to help you and are very friendly. However you might get a little cramped up for space if your numbers exceed 4.

Coming to food, we had ordered one Veg Clear Soup, Potato Wedges, Veg Pizza, White and Mixed Sauce Pasta, Mediterranean Grilled Wrap and Veg Grilled Sandwich.

Veg Clear Soup: It was utter crap. The veggies were fresh. Despite this, the soup was completely watery. Absolutely tasteless and bland. 

Potato Wedges: Crispy with adequate amount of spice. Probably the only dish that was well prepared. After all, what can you do wrong with a potato :-P

Veg Pizza: The pizza base was nice and thin and crunchy. The amount of cheese was sufficient and the toppings were evenly cut and baked. However, the pizza was too damn salty‚Ä¶nearer to bitter. Spoiled.

Pasta: White sauce Pasta was passable. But the sauce was too milky. The other one, Mixed sauce, was nice. Flavourful at first and providing the tangy spice in the after taste.

Veg Grilled Sandwich: Nicely done sandwiches. Very fresh baked and crispy. Great combination of veggies.

Mediterranean Grilled Wrap: Well what can I say. It never came. It was on my order but they forgot to serve it. Worse than ever, it was added to the bill. Real disappointment after such a fine staff service.

Brownie with Ice cream: Undoubtedly the best item that was served to us. One of the finest brownies I have had in a long time, in an all-time classic combination with vanilla ice cream. Bliss.

Iced Tea: This is a personal favourite. Was splendid.

Relatively lower on your pocket pinch. The order time is really less. We didn‚Äôt even have to wait for 10 mins to get our food. Very swift service ( So swift that they forget to serve you items :-P )

Food: 2.5/5

Service: 4/5 

Ambiance: 4/5

I love Afraa Deli. I just cant put my finger on anything specific. But the quaint store with its open air deck against the city centre backdrop as well as its perky menu attracts me a lot. when i used to visit earlier, I loved their Lebanese Burritos. with that off the menu, now I am left with the option of trying out other items. I love the pastas and the soups as well as the beverages they serve.¬†
Although the outdoor lacks the AC environ, it is still much relaxing to sit outside when the weather is not extremely unbearable!¬†
I fever you visit, do try out the crepes and salads.

We had two spaghetti with white sauce, a serving of French fries, a cappuccino, one black coffee and a lemonade. The bill amount was close to 1.4k. It's a bit too much if you ask me, given the fact that the food was not a 'wow'.
The waiter was eager to help though.
Food: 3/5
Ambience: 3/5
Service: 3.5/5
Value for money 2.5/5

Re-evaluating: tried this place after almost a year. The food was still pretty nondescript. The saving grace was the wait staff last time. But this time, it was completely different. No one bothered to take our order for 15 mins or so. The chef saw us waving like crazy for the waiter to take note of us and had to ask the waiter to take our order. We ordered our choice of pasta. Spaghetti in cheese sauce, with basil, sun dried tomato and extra cheese and yes pork ham and we asked for a lemon ice tea and a plain lemonade. The waiter did not note anything down. We know he would be back, asking for us to confirm the order again. It did happen. It's normal to forget all those combinations, specially for folks like them who are only part time waiters. After asking for confirmation for the umpteenth time, they served us spaghetti in mushroom sauce with pork ham? No cheese sauce, no basil, no sun dried tomato, no extra cheese sauce. They gave me a masala ice tea, although I asked for a lemon ice tea.

Then when they gave us the bill, it showed a veg pizza and cappuccino was added. We never ordered or eat any of that! When asked they said, sorry sir, it was done by mistake. I asked them to change it and give me a fresh bill with the correct items in it. They said that the veg pizza costs exactly the same as the pasta and the cappuccino costs exactly the same as a lemonade and *refused* to change the bill and said they can't rectify the bill. They'll have to void the entire order and generate a new order and bill. When I refused to pay my bill, until they show me the correct bill, they grudgingly changed the bill and I could hear them muttering under their breath. Some hospitality, this!

p.s: the AC vents were leaking.

Mixed experience... in the starting we didn't get the indoor seating... it seems like for getting indoor seats one have to be in the competition... but whatever we got a seat as we requested the staffs.... deco was good... outdoor seating are also good but I think it will be preferable for winter.... coming to the food have 1. Rasamali and peanut butter shake... both are very good. 2. Chicken Hawaiian salad... it was awesome. 3. Garlic toast with cheese... very bad  because firstly they burnt the toast and secondly the cheese are cold. 4. Pizza veg (with toppings mushrooms, onions, American corn and broccolis) with add-ons chicken and egg..... now that was a blender... firstly after a long wait they given us a pizza with chicken and egg only... notifying them they taken it back... baked it again three pieces of broccolis, some countable pieces of bell peppers and some babycorn and mushrooms with cheese and over burnt it... not ended here again after a long wait they served it cold... pathetic.. and lastly 5. Chocolate brownie... it's awesome... pocket pinch was ok..  staffs are not well trained... service was horrible... needed more management trainings.... sorry guys...

My favorite place to hangout with friends and family. Staff are amazingly good in terms of customer service and very friendly. Food is delicious. I am disappointed with a small service change where you have discontinued the plastic bowls for discarding the tea bags after use. One is left with no choice but to discard it on the plate which gets quite messy as with every sip of tea I end up with few drops on myself as well. Your service change should not compromise on your standards. Hoping for a positive feedback.

Located inside City Centre , Salt Lake near the Kund Area. Decor is fantastic loved it .
Had to wait in the open area as it was crowded with foodies. Ordered Chicken Clear Soup which was satisfactory . Sweet Fresh Lime Soda & Iced Tea were sublime. 
French Fries was crunchy and crispy.
Chicken Pasta (white sauce) was the best for me.
Chicken Pizza with extra cheese was brilliant too.
And for the last item Vanilla Icecream with hot Brownie was awesome.

Food is good. Ambience is sober. Had ordered the English breakfast which was very tasty indeed. Also, had ordered the Healthy Burger, which was good. But I would say that the price range is high-bound making the place a posh hangout. 
I also ordered a cafe latte and a blueberry marshmallow smoothie. I would say that I have no complaints regarding the drinks. Both of them were equally good with respect to taste, quantity, quality and price.

Visited there for a quick Business Lunch. The decor was very international in standards. The alfresco seating arrangement was great too but I think there will be less takers for that for most of the time given the hot & humid climate in Kolkata. It can be nice for Winters. The Menu was simple & less confusing. I went for Grilled Chicken Sandwich in Brown Bread & Cappuccino. However, I couldn't find anything for the diet conscious people. Almost most of the items contained mayo, cheese, fried items. I would visit again for sure.

The Afraa Deli still maintains it's high quality of food. Though the seating arrangement feels a little cramped & sitting outdoors is hardly an option due to Kolkata's weather (except in the winter). Fortunately, most of the items on the menu are available here & ofcourse, the food is great & the portions decent. Sadly, their Roesti is no longer available but do try the open-faced tuna fish sandwich.

Wanted to try this cafe since a long time. So today went with my friend to this small cafe which had a few tables indoor and the rest outdoors. We ordered a cappuccino and a caramel creme latte which was pretty good though the mugs they were serving in were cheap plastic ones which was not expected in a cafe like this. The pizza and roesti were also ok ok. The service was slow and overall experience was fine. Would visit again for coffee.

Love the ambience and silence early in the morning, before the stores open and the place floods up. Their eggs are done well and since I prefer the sandwiches, the tomato, pesto one hits the spot for me, wash it down with an earl grey or iced tea....depending on the mood and the weather and Im good to go...highly recommended!!

Afraa deli is more of a confort food place. They have great salads, pastas and breakfast. The ambiance is really nice but they could do with more than just 2 ft of space. Sitting at their outdoor seating is not the most appealing option in the kolkata heat/humidity with a dash of mosquitoes.¬†

However, with food, no complains really. Their warm mushroom salad and cheesecake are great, especially when paired together. Breakfast is decent, but I'd prefer if my eggs were actually made to order (which essentially means that the staff either doesn't listen to my instructions/ doesn't convey to the chef/ doesn't ask at all). Which is why I've docked 0.5 off my rating for them. Service could use some improvement, otherwise they're pretty good.

We went here yesterday to get a birthday cake for a friend. There were just 2 cakes available. Nevertheless,because of the popularity of this place,we decided to take a cake from here instead of Kookie Jar and we were not disapoointed at all! The cake was amazing. The chocolate was fine..and everything was well balanced. It was a delightful experience having a cake from here. However,the place does not have a proper kitchen and lacks good sanitation facilities. The cooks were preparing all the food in front of the customers and the mushrooms kept on the kitchen table had flies hovering all over it. I would have rated this place a 2.5 but a point extra for the cake. Do avoid this place if you can for food.

I visited Afraa Deli with a friend a month ago and made ourselves comfortable at the table on the left hand corner. The service of Afraa is very disappointing and I have noticed this all the three times that I have visited the joint. I don't judge quickly because I believe in second and even third chances. However, the waiters seem reluctant, even subtlety rude at times. So we ordered a beer, pasta and garlic bread. The food was great as usual. However, the spoons and plates were dirty. I could see the remnants of food on the fork I was given and it was a HUGE turn off. We got it changed, but I will definitely try to avoid Afraa Deli.

Afraa Deli is not a place for hardcore foodies. Having said that, this place serves decent food but the charm of the place is it's wooden decor, 'cafe' feel, and friendly staff. Putting up at salt lake, I have spent most of my evenings here. 40th cup of Darjeeling tea and apple cake goes really well with random conversations. You may want to try out their burgers and pasta as well.

First time I went there just to kill some time before going for somewhere. So ordered only peach and strawberry smoothies. But it was a real shock. I couldn't find any trace of peach in it. And coming to the strawberry i got liquid strawberry ice cream (that too very ordinary!). was not expecting this from a reputed name like "Afraa". Smoothies from KFC, pizza hut are far far better than it. at least they provide real fruit extract or something that tastes like  real fruit extract and not like ice cream that have been kept out from freezer long ago!

After my previous visit to afraa deli, I took a second chance to taste there other dishes (being optimistic). But again! they failed to impress. This time I went with my husband who was never been there before. It was bitter experience for him too.

We order grilled chicken wrap , Spicy chicken tikka kathi roll, deli signature cold coffee and virgin mojito.

1. grilled chicken wrap - Though it was not bad, a thin flour made roti was wrapped around finely cooked diced chicken, crispy onions and tasty mayonnaise. But it overall tasted like a normal Lebanese roll and definitely not worthy of 200 bucks!

2. Spicy chicken tikka kathi roll - it was like any other chicken roll we find at roadside roll centres, Nothing special.

Both the wrap and the roll were served with lays potato and tomato sauce.

3. Virgin Mojito - It was good. But had some artificial colour in it, Which I don't prefer. Though decoration was nice.

4. deli signature cold coffee - If it is their signature drink, then gays you definitely have to change your signature. It was very thin and had a watery texture. There was lack of sugar, lack of milk, lack of coffee and lack of taste. Though it cost us a 180 bucks, still I can't call it a coffee, surely not a signature one. My husband is very fond of coffee, so he became upset with it.
In spite of high price their food is not up to the mark, where there sibling restaurant afraa creperie own our hearts with a ease. 
They have a space problem too, Sitting arrangements are a bit clumsy and congested. 
Hope they'll try hard to improve in both taste and service.

Aafra Deli is this fine caf√©/bistro located strategically in City Centre 1 overlooking the lawn area.

Chic looking and European in style, it is one of my regulars, and there‚Äôs a very nice vibe to it, similar to its sister, the Aafra Creperie.¬†
It has 2 sections ‚Äì The alfresco section which is some 25 odd seater, while the interior is a bit cramped on a dozen seater side. 

There is a precise reason why visiting Aafra Deli is a much much better option than sub-standard cafes like CCD. Paying the same amount of money, you could have a much wider gastronomical option, and the tastes are bang on authentic.

They serve a pleasant, different kind of a chicken soup, and a wonderful Chicken and Mushroom Pasta in choices of Penne/Spaghetti. The English breakfast is just ok, maybe a bit on the pricey side.

The Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the mini burgers are also decent, and frankly saying I didn‚Äôt taste any of their veg offerings, hence would not be able to comment. The staff is chivalrous and they are always enthusiastic and smiling, with a frank sense of cordiality. If you are a regular, they know your palate ÔÅä

Without fail, I have the apple cake (which is mind-bogglingly delicious) and flush it down with a Darjeeling tea, every time after a meal/snack ÔÅä

Been here often latest being 18April15. Amazing in terms of ambience, although the indoor is slightly cramped. Had a black currant ice tea which was nice, a clear chicken soup: a no nonsense thin chicken based soup and a pizza. The pizza was fresh, with a very thin crust and fresh vegetables and chicken made to order. In fact the taste was so fresh that mid way into the meal, we ordered for a second one. A nice refreshing European cafe set up in Salt Lake ideal for those looking for a quick bite and/or to meet up with someone.

Lovely ambience, great food, courteous staff....I believe this sums up Afraa deli. Went there, a few years back with 2 of my school buddies, and had the time of our lives, eating, clicking photos and chatting, on a drowsy Sunday afternoon. We had the Sunday brunch buffet including red wine, and it was pretty decently priced. The menu included a whole lot of lovely desserts as well.

Well. This was my first time surprisingly and it didn't let me down. The ambience is pretty good and classy. Compact, well lit and nice vibes. 

Now. The food. I went for desserts mainly. So ordered a Blue Lagoon and Brownies with Ice Cream. Both of them were well made and served. Although nothing much to do here. Still. The Brownies were hot and yummy. The chocolate syrup and the ice cream really made it a good eat and then the lagoon. Perfect. Although I would have loved it more if it had been a bit more cold. Still. Worth it. 

Price is a bit on the higher side maybe but definitely nothing too much.

And the service isba bit slow. At least ours came late. All in all a good experience.

Good place to have your evening tea, or a mid-morning snack. They have a good spread of sandwiches, wraps, panini and pizzas.¬†

Would always ask people to have their tea. They're the only deli / cafe that I know of in Calcutta who use Teesta Valley tea - which is so much more uplifting and fragrant than the run of the mill Tetley tea bags used by most places.

Ambience is very nice, staff courteous. Though service could be a little quicker, Afraa Deli is quite a nice place to visit.

This place has become crazy and I am just giving it a rating of 1.0 because there's no other option for negative marking. 
On a lazy weekday in fact today I visited this place and ordered for a chicken pizza with "EXTRA CHEESE" well guess what? There was hardly any cheese. 
The staff are a bunch of mini scoundrel who shrugs their head from time to time and doesn't really care how they are behaving with the customers. 
When I called the waiter to complain about the state of their so called pizza, absolutely no flavours nothing, it was bland and really bad to eat, in fact I didn't even bother to finish it. 
Without even asking for the "cheque" they shoved the bill on our faces, this shit costed us 627 bucks and guess what upon paying the bill they did not even give us the change or the final bill. We waited outside for sometime but nor did anyone come neither did anyone apologise for their outrageous behaviour.
I had high regards for this place but after this horrible experience I am not stepping inside but again the management would reply "who cares"?! 
Disgusting is the only word to describe this one, my previous rating was 4.5 and today I am being forced to even rate.

There's nothing of its kind in and around Salt Lake. A great place to hang out and relax with with friends or family. Specifically meant for quick meals and fabulous desserts, Afraa Deli is one of the best of its kind in town. You can choose to sit either inside or in the open which I prefer more. Ambiance is well suited for the kind of food it serves. The service is quite impressive too.

It ain't cheap though and it suits me just fine with the quality and the experience on offer.

We had the Classic Cheese Fondue with Garlic Bread, Croutons, Broccoli, Gherkins, Potato, Carrots and other veggies & Chocolate Fondue with Strawberry, Marshmallow & Croutons both were great. Though quantity of veggies was less than expected.

A good place for hangouts. Though I prefer tea over coffee, I must say that they make really good coffee here. I tried the pizza here, which again is lovely. Perhaps one of the yummiest thin crust pizzas I have had in a pretty long time. To cut the long story short, it is an ideal place for occasional luncheon between work shifts.

Try their selection of coffee and also sandwich lovers must try their Mexican sandwich which is mouth watering. Portion is good and it is more of a entire experience.

We had to wait for like ages to place the order. The person just wouldn't come, prompting us to even contemplate leaving. And I do not know what problem they have with their payment option, the POS card transactions never work. Highly irritated.

Its a good place to chill out over some nice continental dishes but lacks incredibly when i compare it to afraa creperie in the same premises.

Its a small congested outlet and i would prefer their open air seatings, if the weather permits. The menu is small compared to their other outlets especially the conclave one. The staff however is very warm and tries to serve you their best.

Coming to food the menu might be smaller in comparison yet gives you enough choices to order from. The pasta preparations and pizza are pretty good here but when i tried to try some different things from the menu, i dint quite like them as much. the veg clear soup turned out to be very okkayish, french fries were very average, too crisp for my liking. The coffee is decent. I also tried the quesadilla which was lovely and a must try in my opinion if you love spinach.

Overall it used to a favorite joint earlier but afraa creperie has replaced it for me, unless i want to sit in their open air space.

Nice place to hang out with friends and grab a bite.. It is one of the few places which open at 10, so perfect for breakfast and chat.. The ac seating area is small but they have a quite big outdoor seating arrangement.. We were a bot disappointed that not all the items in the menu card were available like hazelnut coffee and lasagna. But those that were there were great. We had two types of stuffed omelette done to perfection, a wrap and a ham sandwich.. Adequate amount and well pricing.. The brownie with ice-cream and apple pie were scrumptious... And most of all no one shooed us as we casually sat there chatting and had a 2.5 hrs long breakfast... Definitely recommend this joint. Hope they keep all the items from the menu the next time...

The best part about Afraa is the ambiance and service. I love their open air sitting area outside with little candles on the table, perfect romantic setting, under those airy trees and quite faar from the hustle bustle. Now the coffee and the frappe here is great. It suits my taste exactly the way i want it. I am fond of their pies and pastries, yummy and the quality speaks for itself.I generally order their crepes and wraps and they are quite filling. I have tasted their pasta n pizza from a friend's plate and they were tasty as wel.. I like their gourmet pizza with goat cheese n olives and jalapenos and chicken ... quite a nice combination of taste. Every person who hangs out in CC1 must hv tried it all here but still for those who thinks it is a costly place , its worth a shot, next time in CC, u knw where to head straight ... Afraa.

The best thing about this outlet is the option of sitting outside, provided you are visiting it in the evening. They have very cozy benches and it gives you a very French cafe kind of feel. Tried their lemon tart, which had a very wonderful tart, not crumbly but not overdone as well, however the lemon curd was very, very sour. The lemon curd is supposed to be sour, but it was exceptionally sour that day. The open kitchen seemed like a fantastic idea because you could see the ingredients being put in the dish.However, more than the interiors, the exteriors definitely caught my eyes. Also, you see the tall chairs, where you could sit and gossip with your friend, feeling that your sitting in one of those tapas. I would love to try their savory items, as I've always been loyal to the sweet tooth that writhes in my mouth, whenever I enter this deli.

I do not mind paying more for a good quality food but then taking your customers for granted is not welcome. The coffee and tea is also average. Just that the ambiance is good and you can visit this place if you want to conduct an interview or meet a prospectus client.

Here's the thing with Afraa Deli: it's got a fantastic location in Salt Lake's City Centre, it's got a menu that'll make you sit up, some lovely outdoor seating arrangement that's fantastic on a lovely winter afternoon, and yet. And yet. I can't manage more than a 3.0 rating because of that 'and yet', because the lovely outdoor seating arrangement notwithstanding, Kolkata's weather does not really encourage outdoor seating on most occasion, and the interior of this cafe is cramped and often noisy (the only thing noisier is the CCD upstairs), making for a poor spot to either have a conversation or have a quiet cup of coffee to yourself.

They brew a decent cuppa, I will give them this -- in a part of the city where other coffee alternatives are the many, many CCD outlets, Afraa Delhi does make for a refreshing change. The dessert menu is interesting: I tried their apple pie, and it was good if not entirely fresh. Again, the cramped interior on a hot summer afternoon with that much noise does not make for a particularly spot to relish your food.

The food, however, leaves something to be desired. For one, a lot of the items in the menu weren't available. I eventually settled on the pasta aglio olio, and it was soggy as hell, with portions that's best passable. Their pricing, by Kolkata standards, is fairly high, and one expects better quality food for these rates. 

So: a 3.0 it is. A bit of a disappointment.

Located in City Center I, this place has cosy cafe interiors. I wouldnt say the interiors are exceptional but not too bad. I  visited this place on 15.07.2014 for breakfast. Their idea of an open kitchen is nice however i found that to be a little annoying, with vessels clanking and staff chatting out loud!
We ordered for a 3 egg omelette with mushroom filling and it was served with 1 small hashbrown, 1 slice of toast, butter and ketchup. It was was tasty though.
Also ordered was a plate of spinach, cheese garlic and chilli quesadillas and it tasted okay,not too bad. 
The oreo mint shake had a subtle hint of mint and a good flavour of oreo blend. However the lemonade was not that great, prepared with lime concentrate and mint syrup . That later gave me a sore throat! 
Lastly we ordered for a chocolate fudge and it was tasty. 

There isnt much to mention about the staff. They were very occupied with their side jokes !  
Overall bill was 811/- so yes it is pocket friendly !
Overall a pretty average place!

Have been to this place thrice so I guess a review is in order.

 I love the Balsamic Grilled Mediterranean Veggies et al sandwich and the mix sauce pasta with my choice of vegetables.
The sandwich leaves nothing to be desired further. The pasta is creamy, ever so slightly "liquidy", the sauce is absolutely delicious with a perfect combination of red and white. It is yummy, period.

On a different note, the fresh lime at this place, like the one offered by its elder sibling on the 6th floor, is terrible. I tried pineapple blossom and N ordered mango blossom. Both these shakes were equally poor in taste leaving me a bit disappointed. 

Its a nice place to have a quick snack and of course you will have the urge to come back at this place.

An absolute favorite, it is the perfect place to meet up with friends, colleagues and bump into old acquaintances. Love to sit outside on the benches, gives a lovely park like feeling when it's not raining and you can stare out into the distance at the shoppers walking in and out or people just sitting on the mall stairs catching up with each other. A cold coffee is my typical order, but along come a variety of munchies. French Fries, Cheese Toasts, Pasta, Pizza, sandwiches, salads it's good and sumptuous food. Try their dessert array and you wouldn't be disappointed. Won't deny it is a pocket pinch. But for the sake of a happy belly, good mood and lots of gup-shup, money rarely matters.
Even sitting alone with a book is a complete delight. Try it :)

We went there on a lazy Sunday morning for some breakfast. I had the English breakfast and my husband had a chicken pasta. Firstly, there was no coffee, which was bad news for a coffee addict like me (and who doesn't have coffee in stock, btw?), plus there was no fresh juice, only the preserved variety available. The food was mediocre at best. But then, I had ordered for a simple fare, so that was alright. The pasta was good. However, the food quantity was too little for the price charged. Overall, there are much better places offering breakfast or continental fare at this price range, so for me, it wasn't exactly something I would look forward to eagerly again!
The service and ambience was average, according to me.

I visited Afraa Deli today while catching up with an old school friend. It was my first visit to this particular deli and I absolutely loved the ambience. It's a small but friendly place that looks (and smells) exactly as an upmarket deli should! We ordered lemon and peach iced teas, and a spaghetti in tomato vodka sauce for her and a penne arrabiatta with veggies for me, both with add-on chicken. The iced teas appeared within five minutes. I'm a sucker for peach flavour and this didn't disappoint. Not too sweet, not too tart and deliciously refreshing. Our pastas came after another 15 minutes, piping hot and in just the right quantities for one person. Both of them tasted amazing. The broccoli was cooked perfectly and the sauces were divine - smooth and creamy without being heavy. The chicken was also well-cooked with no raw bits anywhere. After slurping up every last mouthful we were pretty full - but visiting Afraa without tasting the desserts is something of a sin for us, so we shared a slice of chocolate fudge cake. It was as rich and chocolatey as can be, but here is my only slight criticism - there was a faintly stale aftertaste to it, discernible after I swallowed. However, my friend didn't make any comment on it, and I haven't suffered any ill effects, so maybe it was nothing serious. Still, a word of advice to Afraa; desserts absolutely must be fresh! Even a hint of staleness isn't acceptable! 
Overall, I'd say great decor, great food, great service. Wish I didn't live so far away, or I'd definitely want to come here almost every day! :D

I was in Kolkata for 3 months, and whenever I went out shopping at city centre, I made it a point to visit this place for a quick bite. Afraa Deli has always been delightful, owing to it's lip smacking food and well behaved staff. They have both indoor as well as outdoor seating options (I prefer the outdoor). As I mentioned, the food is exceptional, starting from the lasagne, to the english breakfast or the pastas. 
This is the place to hangout with your friends, a little chitchat while enjoying the cool evening breeze over a cup of coffee and a perfectly grilled sandwich (or maybe a hot chocolate fudge!)
Definitely recommended!

A visit to Afraa left me spellbound. I called for a chicken ceaser salad, and I got glass pieces tossed with, I cut my tongue and luckily I did not swallow it. Such restaurants should be shut, they can very well kill a person and just apologise. On complaining they said they did not have anyone from the management level being a weekend. A chef who came from above said he had nothing to do with Afraa deli. Highly dangerous and unprofessional.

The attractive outdoors with a lush canopy of the gulmohar tree was probably the only saving grace .  We stopped by for some coffee and summer coolers‚Ä¶ both of which failed to impress us in any aspect‚Ä¶. It was such a turn off I did not even opt for any other eatables! The service is slow and the staff‚Ä¶ they r confused not knowing any part of their menu . Overall I would like to remember only the gulmohar tree when I will think of afraa deli .

This is the first of its kind in Kolkata. I have been here so often that I have lost count, I am so so sorry that they removed salads from the menu. They were to die for. The new menu is a tad disappointing but I will talk about the upsides first. The decor is really cosy and you can choose to sit inside or outside. The open kitchen here only adds to the overall experience because the staff is really warm and nice. The apple pie and carrot cakes are must-haves from the bakery section. Chocolate lovers can also try the chocolate pastries and brownies.
The sandwiches are carefully put together with the most awesomest hand-picked ingredients- balsamic, pesto, caramelized onion, brie, mushroom -  the list is endless. All of them are to die for. The pastas are pretty decent too. But what tops my list is the English Breakfast. It is better than in most delis. I would want them to re-introduce my favorite melon soda, and also introduce Eggs Benedict. Amen :)

Seating choice: indoor and outdoor. Summers (when outdoor seating doesn't works) and weekends it becomes crowdy.. Don't go if you want peace and want to chat for a long time.. However it's good if you have bunch of friends or some good old college friend to meet.. Food is good, reasonable, choices are less..

It has a pretty nice decor. Arrangements for sitting both inside and outside. I was a bit disappointed with the menu because i expected more varieties. But the food was top quality and tasty. Had a lemon iced tea, chicken nuggets, mexican chicken wrap and deli signature salad grilled chicken. 
The salad was not to my taste. In desserts I had Apple pie, simply blew me away. And fudge chocolate cake. Good too
Overall an enjoyable experience. Prices pretty reasonable.

This is one of my most frequented places in kol.It is just a walk away from my place and I love the food here.They have options of indoor and outdoor seating and when they opened up,it was not something calcuttans were used to and everyone loved it.They have the days specials written down on a little board.
Have eaten nearly everything vegetarian and all the baked goodies they have on offer over the years.Everything has always been delicious.They take orders for croissants and similar things if you let them know a day in advance.
Staff is warm and friendly but the speed of service depends on the day.They are quick to take your orders but getting food to your table takes a little while.Now that they have a open kitchen in front of you the wait's a little easier compared to earlier when the cooked food would be brought down from the lounge and restaurant upstairs.Let them know when you place your orders in case you are in a hurry and they let you know how much time your food shall take.One of the best cafe's kolkata has.Definitely a must visit.

You can't go wrong with the Afraa . Although this particular outlet is little cramped up and can find every odd person eavesdropping , the food was very authentic. Groupon's offer makes it perfect to try your taste buds if you haven't been there ever.

I was pretty excited about trying out Afraa Deli after I heard so much about their food, and I was pleased with their food until I found some stone chips in my mouth and  food. I went with my mother and we had ordered for a chicken mushroom pasta and a non veg pizza. I found some thing cracking loudly in my mouth while my mother found a stone chip on her pizza slice. We called the waiter and gave him the stone and he seemed amazed. He did not have any explanation. He did come and apologize and even gave us a piece of pastry as an apology but nothing makes up for the presence of stones in the food they served, Plus the ac there was too chilly, I shifted my place thrice before I could feel comfortable and not shiver! The same happened to the couple who came in after us. 
So even though I liked the decor and all the whole mood went down the drain. I might think twice before going there again because I was put off big time.

Well... it did start well but did't end well.

The menu is interesting and has a lot of options for conti food lovers. 
The setup is impressive - outdoors + indorrs.

The service was slower than expected (especially for the price that you have to pay) Food was ok, pasta was good and done well.

The bill that came after several reminders was the let down. The credit card machine didn't work and you need to carry cash . ugh!! 

summary - VFM is real low. variety is good, service is a tad slow.

A sumptuous place situated on the left of the gate facing the horse-cart in city center. It is pretty near to my office, so I tend to eat here quite often. The another reason is my love for aglio e olio! I don't know the reason of my fondness towards this dish.. but I just simply adore it :) 

Food: 
This section earns the maximum point for this place as the dishes are really tasty and contain distinct flavor of each ingredient used while making. No wonder I cant stop praising for the aglio e olio dish this place serves - it works as a bang-on for my taste buds. The lasagna, the sandwiches and the wraps and the pies are also at par. The quality is pretty good overall. 

Ambiance: 
Afraa Deli has recently undergone a makeover. The deli before and now are both significantly lavish looking and depicts a clean & fresh look relaxing your mood within few minutes you enter the place. Hospitality: If food is the gainer then this part is certainly the looser. You have to wait for long, which seems like ages, to get the menu card on your table and then another time gap is created when you order one. Now ordering has a weird chemistry with the people who take it. Everything goes fine if you order few things on the first, the problem starts if you try to order few more later. Either you have to ask for 2-3 more times to get it delivered or you have to actually get up and remind them of your order. It becomes more annoying when you find that the order has not yet reached the kitchen! This happened with me twice. I don't like to get up from my seat to ask for my order status. Come on people, it's your attitude which can bring this place an added charm and can also be the reason for empty tables. Get your socks pulled! 

To summarize, it is a good option to eat if you are near city center but not the best if you want to get a good service. The food is the reason to love it, the service leaves you feeling the opposite, at times.

Just got back from Aafra Deli, City Centre, Salt Lake. Incidentally I am a club Rio Vista member.

After a busy sultry day my friend and I dropped in for a cup of tea. To cool down a bit I asked for a glass of water before ordering some quick bite from a waiter.

We waited for over 15 minutes and in the meantime reminded twice for the water. When the waiter whom we requested for water asked a guy in the counter to hurry up and fill two glasses for us, the guy in the counter screamed "Ask them to buy mineral water if they are in a hurry"!

We were shocked at the audacity as it was audible to every guest in the packed Deli. It was the insult of the highest order! It was a horrible experience for us and we have never felt more humiliated.

I will think twice before visiting the Deli again. Their non co-operative attitude disgusted me. Your employees should understand that they are not doing any FAVOR serving the clients and should learn a few things about client handling.

My husband and me run a group of companies in Kolkata and have a huge clientele whom we treat with utmost respect because they are providing salaries for our employees and profits to us! 

These small things matter a lot more than the fantastic food or decor of any food joint. But who's listening?

Well, what to start with? I don't have any clue how to judge a 'Deli'. But when it is 'Afraa' you don't have to put much effort. I just wonder how could I miss to try it once during my Kolkata days when city center used to be our 2nd home.

Stories apart, I got couple of chances to knock on there during my Kolkata visit last month and simply I loved it. :) 

Though the indoor seating is little congested, they have few open air tables. Perfect for a hangout for a group, or go for indoor with your best buddies or better half.     Music is also great inside.
I have tried few things - English breakfast, chicken nuggets, wrap, grilled chicken sandwich, americanno, Darjeeling tea. Well everything seemed perfect for me. If you are running without breakfast somehow, then go for the healthy and full packed English breakfast which comes with a choice of tea, coffee or juice. Didn't get a chance to try the desserts. Nevertheless in a single line it is one of the best Deli in the city.

The zomato rating of "Well.." sums up this place. However I decided to give one higher because of the delightful coffee I had.
One is left searching for good things to say about this place even though one does not really want to be negative either.

This small but open format cafe is located in a pretty nook of city center 1, salt lake. Siting inside is a task in itself due to the chilly blast of the air-conditioning. So me and a friend made our way to the Deli to catch a quick bite after a movie. Afraa Deli is pretty, the format of a Spanish Bistro is rather charming but unlike such bistros the service here is appalling. We seated ourselves in one of the tables located on the portico/terrace and waited a full 20 mins for someone to hand us a menu. Alas, that was not to happen. I had to walk over to the counter inside and enquire whether this was self-service (knowing fully well it is not!!) and only then were we handed a menu.

We ordered a cafe mocha and cappuccino and I ordered the only non-veg pasta they have on their menu. I was damn disappointed to see such little choice for non-veg pastas, when in contrast there is a quite the offering for veg pastas. The coffees came in quickly enough. I liked my cafe mocha well enough, the chocolate designs over the cream was drool-worthy. The cappuccino looked bland and meh..but tasted ok. 

The pasta was strictly okay. With there being no Arrabbiata option for the chicken pasta, the creamier version did little for my taste buds. There were sufficient amount of diced chicken. However, I had a problem with the button mushrooms which tasted like they had been pulled out of a bottle rather than being fresh. There was not enough flavouring from the oregano coming through, and the cream overpowered every other flavour in the dish. 

We had to ask two different people separately for our bill. *sigh* Pocket pinch for the evening was 490 bucks which is okay. 

I would go back again to try the Caesar salad perhaps...and the coffee...but sadly the (dis)service would make me think twice!!

This was about my visit to this outlet, roughly 2 months ago. I'm really trying to remember the last time that I was served 'Ketchup' with Quesadillas. 
Having been highly impressed by the other branch (on the AJC Bose Road, If i'm not mistaken), I decided to try the branch at City Centre. What a bummer that turned out to be. We ordered four dishes, not one of which was as per the details on the menu or our request. The tortillas and Quesadillas were with ketchup, and the Kathi rolls were with ketchup as well. At 7:30 in the evening, which restaurant runs out of salsa, sour cream and mint chutney all together?  The food itself arrived after 25 minutes despite our table being among the only 3 actually occupied. Barring the Balsamic Grilled Mediterranean sandwich, none of the items were even remotely good, either bland or in the case of the Kathi, too sweet. Cleanliness was also a major issue that needed addressing. The cherry on top was the stale bread of the Quesadilla, two bites of which gave me food poisoning, thus effectively ruining my NYE.

I dont know whether that was a mishap of a day, or a perpetual phenomenon, but all in all a big let down.

I had been wanting to visit this place from a long long time but it was always full, hence I could not make it inside. But yesterday, I found a few seats empty and hence decided to check it.
A huge banner in City Centre read "Fondue Festival" and that is the reason why I ended up here. It was again J alongside.
To start off with, they DID NOT let me take pictures. I do not know why. They have an open kitchen and all. I understand but I could easily take the photos of the tables and chairs right? They were not allowing even that. Anyway, I did take a few shots.
The ambience is very classy with wooden furnitures and wooden shelves, an open kitchen. Very elegant. Reminded me of english bistros. 

Coming to the food, we had ordered :

Jasmine Tea
Mango Smoothie
Chimichurri Fondue (no veg)

The jasmine tea was nice and the aroma was enchanting. The tea felt good in the slightly cold season and the ambience soothed it even better.
The mango smoothie was a disaster. It was not sweet AT ALL. I felt as if i am a diabetic patient and hence have been offered so less sweet a drink.
Well, coming to the real reason behind my visit.
The fondue was good and nice, well seasoned and the aroma wafting into my nostrils felt just fine.
The assorted platter looked delicious and did go extremely well with the fondue. The well season fondue and the assorted platter of chicken, toasted bread crumbs, potatoes went really well.
I like.

But yes, they should improve on their quality of beverages and drinks.

Coming back for more.
Cheers! :)

I had been a frequent visitor to the Deli from the time it opened. I just love the coffee there. I wont say its very cheap but definitely much better in hospitality and quality than the expensive CCDs. Now whenever I visit Kolkata, I make it a point to have a sip at Afraa Deli. The hospitality is awesome and makes me feel to come back more often.
Love the outside seating area too. I am not a fan of the Afraa restaurant and I find it bit overpriced but the Deli is a must visit.

Afraa Deli is the place I usually land up at if I can't figure out where else to go in Salt Lake ....good food , nice ambiance and consistent taste  are the reasons it has become a fall back option over time. The only reason I have not rated it a 4 is the service  which is very inconsistent ! Coming to the food I love the fact it has good breakfast options , The English Breakfast as well as their Three Egg Omelettes are delicious and if your veg then the Baked Beans or Mushroom on Toast is a good option. The all day favorites are the Deli Cheese Toast , Roesti with Baked Beans and Cheese and the Meat Cravers Pizza fully loaded with Pepperoni , English Ham and Chicken are all delicious options. They also have good varieties of Hot Beverages , Shakes , Juices and the like though my poison is the iced-tea (lemon).

This review is in response to the new menu that Afraa Deli has come up with. The three of us were supposed to meet somewhere in City Center, and we decided on Afraa Deli since its pretty convenient for all of us to meet there. I went in with D first, and S was late. The first thing we felt was the cold. The interiors were pretty cold, and soon my friend was shivering delicately. That did not stop us from ordering a few goodies. I was eyeing the Smoked Ham, Mayo, Lettuce, onions, tomato and cheese Sandwich, and decided to split it with D. She got a Cafe Mocha for herself, while I went for the diet coke. Then S came in and ordered a Virgin Mojito and a garlic and rosemary toast with cheese. 

The ham sandwich was pretty big, and it filled both of us nicely, without making us too full. However, the garlic and rosemary toast with cheese was not to my liking. I had thought that the slices of bread would be thick, but they weren't and the cheese did not melt on top. My friend S, however, manfully ate them, and then said she was still hungry. So we decided to go for another main course. This time it was the Balsamic Grilled Mediterranean Veggies, Pesto and Feta Cheese Sandwich. This one really made her happy, and I could see her wolf down her sandwich. 

We decided to order dessert - an apple pie for D and a lemon tart (obviously) for me. The apple pie was lovely when warm, with a lovely crust and a not overly sweet filling. I was very satisfied with my lemon tart - tart lemon curd filling and a thin, but munch-worthy shell. My other friend also liked the chocolate cake, so got a slice of it.

Here came a little problem. We had ordered a second diet coke, and they heard it, but did not give it to us. It took us at least 4-5 attempts and a lot of calling to get their attention, and THEN they gave the diet coke to us. That effectively made all three of us slightly unhappy, robbing away from the food experience. 

Our damage was 1028/- after all this.

Afraa Deli is the place to go when I want the Chicken Caesar Salad and coffee. Countless times I have spent afternoons and evenings just chatting with friends, and the good news is... the ambiance is pretty much relaxed and chilled out. The servers here are very nice, if slightly inattentive. On my last visit, we decided to go get the soup of the day half portion, and it was a very nice cream of chicken soup, with Caesar salad for my friend, and I got the British Breakfast, complete with Hash Browns and a lot of meat. We also decided on a nice carrot cake between the two of us, and it all came together. The food was pretty tasty and made for a lovely light lunch.

A lovely deli with good items on the menu, be it the caesar salad or the chicken sandwich. I love the feel of the place with its prim, proper and clean background. This is a sohpisticated cafe but then with the pocket pinch it should be so. The bakery items here are also nice but I like to jsut sit and chill with a coffee and a sandwich. Since this place is located at city centre, which is but a stones throw from my home, going to this lovely cafe sometimes becomes a bad habit.

This place is highly recommended.

Went there on a a saturday afternoon with my best friend. Was planning it for a long time and finally we popped in. Beautifully lit cafe with extended outdoor seating in nature. We decided to seat outside as it gives you a foreign location feeling.  :-) 
We ordered one carrot cake. Chocolate fudge cake one sunny lemonade and strawberry milkshake. The cakes were soft moist with perfect amount of sweetness cream and proportion. And i loved the strawberry shake inspite of hating strawberries. Must try. Happy with service and attending. 
Next time need to try pizzas and sandwiches.

My Good old Afraa deli has gone down the drains... This happens when continuous quality checks are not done by the chefs and the importance of good authentic food take doesn't take precedence over money making shortcut formulas.
Today I went in for a smoked ham cheese and tomato sandwich which was served as a morbid combination of ham bits( which tasted as bacon) onion,( when did we ever have onion in this kind of sandwich) and Mayo. A MORBID broth which tasted equally bad and tomato?? Where did that vanish?? Any ways just like any other responsible customer when I asked about what sandwich was I served they insisted that this was ham and because they heat it up in microwave it ends up tasting like bacon ( I never expected this kind is explanation).
Add to it just a simple cup of morrocan mint tea was served with a mint syrup and some tea bag( fresh mint leaves are apparently too rare) gosh I think the dead Morrocans will rise up from grave to protest!!
That's what has happened to my good old Afraa- go at your own risk ..the chic cafe interiors doesn't guarantee good or quality food which is absolutely shameful. When food it served on plastic plates, plastic cups and water in paper cups you realise it's a sham after all .
My Poor Afraa has gone to the dogs after all ..:(

I tasted the worst southern chicken fry of my life here yesterday! it was dry, overcooked, rubbery. but when I called up the chef to complain, he was polite enough to apologize and offer us a different plate. unfortunately by that time our palates were so severely injured that we turned down the offer. 
coffee here is really good. tried the irish hazelnut creme and cafe mocha. the former was really delicate and well balanced!
wanted to try banoffee with ice cream for dessert. but though on the menu, it wasn't available. so settled for a carrot cake which was decent. hope to go back on a better day!

okay! first things first. It'd be great if Zomato could update the menu coz theres been a lot of change. The prices have really gone up and they have revised the menu.
Now coming to the review.
Went there today and this place lived up to all the previous reviews that have been uploaded by the other members. If you are going there in the daytime, i would recommend you to sit outside...the tree above and the greenery around you would simply transfer you to some other world. So 5 on 5 for the ambiance. 
If you are sitting outside, then you would have two options. One is the low seats, which is pretty much like a picnic table (only with a glass top). Or you can go for the high (read tall) chairs. I personally feel the high ones would be a little uncomfortable.

I didn't have a lot of time, was there for a quick bite. Ordered a roasted vegetable salad. It was really good. Specially the vegetables were really really fresh. The dressing was sort of subtle in flavors and I did like it a lot.
The staff was also pretty friendly. 
So overall, a good experience. Would like to go there again.

Hope it helped!

been there once after much recommendation and was quite disappointed. ordered a Caesar salad and a barbeque chicken and asparagus sandwich followed by a cheesecake and an apple pie.  The salad was bland and not at all to my liking. i am a huge fan of continental food and i have had better salads in many other lesser known places around the city. The sandwich was better. among the desserts, the blueberry cheese cake was good but the apple pie could have been better. the service is a bit slow.

I ordered for a chicken tikka sandwich in the City Center unit of Afraa Deli on Saturday 3rd August 2013. The filling in the sandwich was very little. In fact in one sandwich half the bread was empty and there was no filling. I was charged Rs 184/ - for the sandwich. I complained to them but they seemed to be not bothered.
I do not recommend people to patronise Afraa Deli. They are a bunch of crooks charging exorbitantly and providing very poor value for the money.

The place used to be so nice and the service equally good.. But then with things changing around city center, this place has also modified itself as well..
Came here last week and ordered Lemon Tea and Mixed Dry Fruit Milk Shake, received a revert "Both not available".. we had to choose some other options which were not as per what we had expected...
Snacks items could have been better.. you tend to repent your decision to sit there while you have CCD,KFc and some other kool places jus stones throw away..nevertheless one might still come here provided you really would want to enjoy an open air cafe ambiance...

definitely one of my most beloved cafes in kolkata.... have been there quite a number of times and have never been disappointed... the cafe, though small, boasts of a unique interior which you'll find warm and homely .. The service may take a bit of time depending on what you order....But the food is worthy of savoring till the last bite... love their sandwiches , wraps, brownies and everything else chocolatey... the pricing has increased a tad but that won't put off foodies with insatiable desire for good food... and the warm ambiance and polite behavior of the staff demand for repeated visits :)

As for Afraa Deli, I must confess that I really love their macaroons and EVERYTHING chocolate on their desserts menu ... a rare example of finest confectionery in Kolkata!! 

However, as for the snacks, I was a tad bit disappointed. The burger tasted just blah... even McDonalds burgers are better than the burger here... the salads are also pretty bland and okay-sih... if you feel that sitting outside and eating in the lap of nature is oh-so-romantic, then you need to be careful of the leaves and crow droppings falling on you or your food... the ambience is very plush, and the staff very friendly... good place, but need to redo their bites' tastes!

Afraa Deli in City Centre I is a cool hangout. To tell the truth, food variety and authenticity is better at another Afraa Deli outlet (The Conclave, AJC Bose Road). But the combination of open air, good view, good food, and security makes the former one a special place. I like the coffee, wraps and pastas there the most.

The first time I ate here with my family I was pleasantly surprised and made a mental note of returning here for more. It's been a while since then and I have to say not only did the quality of food deteriorate badly but also the service has become extremely poor. Two friends and I went for a nice meal in the evening today and were met with utter disappointment. Half of our order was not served to us, the food itself tasted bad and one staff member was extremely rude, though he was clearly at fault. My friend had ordered a penne pasta, even after repeating it twice to him, he brought spaghetti which tasted bland. We pointed out the mistake to him and he said he will get her penne immediately. After another 10 minutes we were again brought a bowl of spaghetti and it seemed to be the same plate. We asked the order to be cancelled and were very rudely told that we should have ordered properly and that the delay of 35 mins for a plate of pasta was due to there being so many customers. Our point is we could have waited if we were told to. We were clearly told the food will be served in 15 minutes. And, the rudeness and the carelessness of the staff member put us off quite a bit. We of course will not be returning here and we caution others also.

Solace is something thats mostly out of reach. And something as quaint and distant as this little cafe/ bistro would make your heart go schmaltzy in a go. Its good food. Its good bucks. And its good. With emphasis on the syllables please. 

Afraa Deli serves you breakfast and all continental delicacies with such impeccable neatness and mettle, that even the taste would make you appreciate the delectable ambiance that couples with a faint strain of background music. Open air and inside, Afraa offers its guests with both kinds of seating arrangements. It is like a small Europe amidst the hustle and bustle of metropolitan India. 

Good pasta and cakes. I went for a certain penne pasta in a creamy dressing with garlic, mushroom and herbs. And a banana cake. Which was soft, moist and scrumptious. There are wraps, pizzas, sandwiches as well. All made fresh in an open kitchen before you (unless you have chosen to sit outside). 
This Deli would touch your heart for sure!

This one is a nice place with good ambience and food but nothing outstanding in my view point. The interiors are quite stylish and intricate which is quite pleasing for your eyes. The various teas available are quite unique and refreshing to taste. 
Their salad section is very well prepared and I loved their Chicken Caesar Salad. Oh and yes there chocolate milk shake is awesome, especially in this hot weather. 
The staff are cordial and helpful. 
You may also try their pastries, they are delectable. 
Overall it was a good experience and I rate it 3.5. The pricing too is very reasonable.

I have been there many times, liked there food  but the service was too lazy, Now after renovation I took a bite and the service has detoriated drastically,  I ordered a lemon iced tea and received an lemonade, then the salad was totally tasteless, no dressing was there, after that when I ordered apple pie I was almost about to puke, the worst apple pie I have ever had, So this  time I did not like the food nor the service, next time I'll think twice to get into this outlet,

A nice shop for a quick bite at City Centre. I love their vanilla and chocolate milk shakes. They also prepare good salads like the Chicken Salad and even pastas like the Arrabiata one.
The barbecue chicken sandwich is also very well done. Staff are polite and ambience is well done. The choco chip cookies and brownies are very yummy.
I would rate 3.5 for Afraa Deli.

If you just want to enjoy a nice conversation and yet enjoy a good meal this is the place to be. They've renovated recently and the new decor adds a finer touch to the ambience. If not anything else this place will give rise to a positive energy within you. The food could be a tad bit better, and I'd really like it if they add a non-veg pasta with a red-sauce base to the menu......but,nevertheless its a great place to hang out with your girlfriends or jst have a lazy brunch with your loved ones.
P.S.- Those who have a weak spot for coffee.....definitely try the expresso......the quantity may disappoint but not the taste.

This place is perfect for a lazy brunch or for a quick bite after shopping or movie. If the weather is good then I prefer the outdoor area. They make awesome pasta and salads. Desserts specially apple cake and macaroons are worth mentioning. They have a good choice of coffee and beverages also. My fav is peach iced tea. Has gone back to this place again and again. Now they are open after renovation. The pricing is also cool. The cold coffee was served on a mason jar, super like!

Reminds me of Europe and the cafes there .
Visit the place often with wife . Its an experience to just sit and eat there .
Our favs there are : Crepe -- french dish . They are just too good there .
Prawn cocktail is also heavenly. 
Other than that there is also the chicken stake with their trademark sauce that makes the thing so special .PS : the stake sauce at City centre 2 Afra is diff renec from the one ate City center 1 afra.anyways .
HIGHLY Re Commended.

Through my stay in Kolkata, the Afraa Deli in City Centre, Salt Lake was one of my favorite haunts. Its a pretty little cafe with an outdoor seating under tree-cover. It somehow makes you feel that you aren't in Kolkata.

They serve really good coffee and deserts! In fact, I have never tasted a better combination of coffee and deserts in my life! The desert exhibit inside has wide range of selections, and the whipped creams and vibrant colors will make you want to clap with glee!! But, they not just look good but taste yummm too!

The pastas and the BLT here are also really good, and the best in Kolkata in my opinion.

The only drawback is that they close by 9.30. So, not really a place for dinner.

RECOMMENDED!

another great place to grab a quick bite, a good selection of salads, sandwiches. simply love the macaroons they make and they also make great cookies. the muffins are not that great the apple pie is wonderful . 

the fav a fairly decent selection of branded teas, and the staff is friendly and cooperative and do accommodate small tantrums if there are any, 

hav had the Ceaser salad here often, they do make quite a wonderful one . 

love the outdoor seating, and the fact that they give coffee beans in a mug with the bill.. 

over a great  place for a winter afternoon. ( sadly its under renovation now)

What can I say? Food is amazing, ambiance is great, made lots of great memories with friends and family over the years it has been opened. My only issue is their changing menu, perfection should never be altered. The staff is well behaved, great with kids, they have even introduced a kids friendly menu recently. All in all, if you're looking forward to some quality time with your loved ones, this is the place to be.

I don't know why are people reviewing Afraa here instead of Afraa Deli.
Both are different from each other! :|
While Afraa is a Lounge cum Restaurant whereas Afraa Deli is Delicatessen.
Coming to my review, The food at Afraa Deli is Awesome. 
The Pizzas (Cream Cheese one) and Pastas ( Vodka Pasta ;) ) are great and the Desserts are fabulous..
Escpecially the Wild Berry Pound Cake and the Macaroons :D
The coffee too is good
Great value for money ;)
I recommend it totally, especially with friends ;)

This is the place I find solace in; the decor is practical and minimalistic, and the option of both indoor and outdoor seating helps at times when the air-conditioning is freezing [that happens a lot]. 

While I have nothing pleasant to say about their new range of muffins and cupcakes, all of which are too sweet and have too much food coloring in them; the rest of the menu is affordable and mostly worth it.

Be sure to request dressing on the side while ordering your salads, they tend to be generous with it and that results in wilted greens [NOT COOL in my book]. However, being a regular helps as the ever-courteous staff keeps your personal preferences in mind and you don't need to complain more than once.

Their pizzas hit the spot and the chef is quick to add on any extras, which for me involves additional cheese, onions and jalapenos. 

I spend a lot of time here, nursing a diet coke and a salad or half a pizza, so waiting times don't really matter. There are times when they do take a lot of time serving up orders, but given that I go there "to" spend some free time, it's okay. 

IF however, you are in a hurry and are looking to pack your food, don't say I didn't warn you. Time delays do occur with meals which are cooked in the upstairs kitchen.

My love for Afraa Deli, btw, is equal to my dislike for the Afraa restaurant on the top floor !!! More on that in an upcoming review.

I think Zomato should go through the reviews before acccepting them. This is not the lounge on the 7th floor as somebody has written but the deli on the ground floor. ;)
I love the place because it makes great food at the cheapest prices. The seating is basic but if u're lucky n the weather's good u can sit outside. Try the smoked salmon salad, it had good quantities of salmon n the chef on our request put some shreds of blue cheese in it. The pastas n the pizzas r good as well. Don miss out on the desert options if u have a sweet tooth. Try their carrot cakes, cup cakes, cheesecakes. Heavenly!!! :) 
Overall a different..def pleasurable.. experience. A Must Go if u want the not 'so regular cafe food' n at amazing prices.

The new lounge bar in town that has the ideal ambience for you to, well, lounge about. Arfaa in Arabic means white. And the entire interiors of this lushly done up lounge bar are, yes, youve guessed it sparkling white. The fusion music reaches the soles of your feet and you cant help but sway and tap along. The perfect place to come to after working hours, to drink some good liquor, indulge in idle chitchat and to just simply relax and feel the stress ebb away from your body.I went there for a lunch buffet recently, and was impressed by the overall appearance and feel of the place. The restaurant is located in the 7th floor, and provides an excellent view of the city -- which is what makes it so special. Food is excellent -- A Rs.700 Buffet should have more variety though.
