Too much lemon water is used and thus ruining the original taste of authentic pav bhaji. The place, is however, very popular among the local couples for quick snacks

This is a nice place for many students for a break in between tuition classes. There momos are quite good. In the competitive market there it stands out quite well.

One of the spots for students to visit during the break/after/before a class(saraf or bacchawat). They serve decent pav bhajis. A full plate costs 40 while a half plate would cost you 30. Taste was good as expected of a street food joint.

One of the best pav bhaji i ever tasted and not only that their veg momo with soup and green & red chatni was the tastiest veg momo of kolkata. At durga puja they serve you the best pav bhaji. Totally loved it.

This place may be defined as not too good but not at all bad! The paw bhaji is good but you should choose the adjacent Agarwal's for better pao bhaji. The momos are good but not very tasty. Its not one of those 'must visit' stalls, but you won't regret visiting it either.

located near to m.g road metro station..and its a road side stall and fails to compete with agarwal's pav bhaji near to it..though i like this place too..i go here whenevr i visit m.g road area for work or with friends..here rows of shops on the roadside u will find selling pav bhaji ,veg momos..etc..

i like their pav bhaji...bread is soft and well made..vegetables and the bhaji is also good ..and their veg momos are not that good ...its very thick and the inner filling is not much..overall not bad ..quite good..

i will not say anything about cleanliness...service is good..pocket friendly and serves hot pav which just fills ur apetite..i like it..:)

Was browsing the collection of sarees around this area, when I glanced at the pav bhaji stalls and could not resist myself and tried their pav bhaji. They made us sit on a wooden bench and made us wait for around 10 mins before serving us our order. The bhaji had good consistency ,was spicy  and tasted quite good. The pav were also soft and moist. Overall the experience was good if I ignore the neatness part. But since its a roadside stall there is nothing much to expect from neatness or ambiance. The pav bhaji was definitely better than the much hyped mayaram.

Gupta's pav bhaji is located near the Mg metro station in Muktaram Babu Street. Previously, it used to sell only Pav bhaji and faces a tough competition from its competitor Agarwal's Pav Bhaji. They have recently introduced veg steamed momo with soup to cater to the needs of the customers. 

The Pav bhaji out here is definitely good but they should provide something in addition to win over its competitor. The idea of introducing veg momo really worked on the positive side. 

Pav bhaji is fine and delicious but momo size is pretty small and should be increased. Another problem with the momo is that the covering of flour Is sticking and is on the thicker side. The soup was up to the mark. 

Positives:-
1) earns quite a lot with the small shop.
2) prices are kept reasonable.
3) service is pretty good and fast.
4) seating place is available even after being a fast food corner.
5) food is served totally hot which drives the taste buds too. 

Negatives:-
1) hygiene is not maintained properly.
2) lacks items to offer. 

Overall, a very decent experience. :-)
