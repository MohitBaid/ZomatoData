Food is below average. Friedrice is like palao. And chilli chicken's gravy ws as thin as water. It had no taste. Not recommended at all. Horrible food.

A unique place, located near Quest Mall, which excels in various kind of innovative preparations, yet does not really punch a hole to your pocket. Try the different kind of rolls here, and you would go flattered. Their Chinese preparations too are quite good and calls for frequent visits.

A foodjoint neat Quest Mall  beside kotak/Ing atm,the owner of this place is a simple man who experiments with his dishes and we should encourage such joints,rather than spending on expensive food outlets in Quest Mall,the menu is very decently priced and good in the pocket,food served is fresh and tasty,very friendly staff. Please do visit this outlet at least once when u go to Quest Mall and if u like,this might always be in your list for a frequent visit.

This was yet another restaurant near my college. When you are broke and yet in for a filling meal, this is your destination. Though they do not serve much of their items that are in the menu in the afternoon , it still is a decent place to visit. The Chinese combos include rice or noodles with a serve of chicken gravy on the side. The Mexican combo was a kind of a let down for me, it was merely Noodles in a gravy of boiled vegetables, and chicken it came along with a drink. The biriyani is tasty, cheap and light. The service time depends on what you order.

I haven't had anything but the rolls from this Joint, and if that is anything to go by, this place should be great! Alaina peaks creatively at the Chilli chicken roll -- which employs a massive amount of gravy. The problem with the roll is that once it starts leaking, and it will, you're left with a lot of gravy on the road.

I really cannot judge a restaurant based on how well they make rolls -- but I'll have to. Their fillings are good -- quantities are good. Pricing is very competitive. The main problem is with their service. They'll take forever to serve.

Regardless, good food.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

situated at a 2mins distance from quest mall. been there just once, sometime back. earlier i used to avoid this place cause of their bright, yet unappealing exterior decorations. ambiance was okay. pretty hygienic, compared to other small food joints. service and staff are great. food is really good and cheap. tried their chicken shami kabab roll, and pav bhaji. worth a visit if you happen to be in this area. :)

Alaina foodies is located at a walking distance from quest mall. I have been there 2-3 times and i must say that am actually in love with their rolls. They have a variety of roll options which are really unique in taste and are not very common in other outlets too. The uniqueness lies in the sauces that they use to make the rolls.
Am not really a roll lover but everytime i visit quest mall i make it a point to drop in here and get myself a cbs roll which is one of their unique and heart filling preparation. They say its a malaysian preparation. The roll is made with generous amount of chicken fillings,veggies and some unique sauce along with mayonnaise. The first bite will only take you to cloud 9! I just got happier and happier with more bites i took. Everytime i drop in here i only go for this particular roll only along with some other variations. The usual chicken roll is also made with utmost care and it will also satisfy your hunger pang as well as soothe your taste buds. Last time i got myself a libyan roll which is also a malaysian roll. It is also one of the best rolls in city. Again the amount of chicken pieces were actually overwhelming and you will feel your teeth chew on meat each time you grab a bite. Unlike some other roll centres,they are never a miser with meat pieces. The libyan roll is made with another unique sauce which gives it an awesome taste. I just love all of their preparations,and i don't think i can settle for something else when am here other than their rolls,specially the cbs roll.
They don't have any inside sitting arrangement for people ordering rolls but for large meals they do have a sitting area inside. People who love rolls should give this place a shot cause its a heaven for roll lovers. Looking forward to my next visit. Keep up the good work alaina!

While returning from quest mall, i and my partner were deciding where to have our lunch. Suddenly we came across this eatery and we were awestruck to see items at such cheap prices. First we hesitated to dine here coz we were unsure of the quality of food served here. But the owner of the restaueant was courteous enough to take us to the dining area. The space is not too large but at that time it was vacant. So we were at peace. We ordered two chicken biryani and two cold drinks.
The quantity of biryani was huge and the texture and taste was fantastic. It was indeed a great lunch without making a hole in the pocket.
The bill came to just rs 160. Now that was amaizing.
Give this place a change. I can guarentee you wont regret it !
