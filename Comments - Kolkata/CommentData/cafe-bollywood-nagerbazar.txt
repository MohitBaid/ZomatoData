It is located in the food court of Diamond plaza Mall. Ordered chicken tikka masala and lachha paratha. Food was not bad. Slow service. Nothing unique about the place.

The food court of Diamond Plaza is no where compared to their counterparts at Mani Square, City Center 2 or any other malls for that matter. The main issue is the time they take to prepare the food. At times, is a bit frustrating. The Cafe has another problem that half of their items on the menu are not available most of the time.

It was the only food joint available, when Diamond plaza food court had just opened. Found their food a bit over-priced. The food court has other eateries available now.
