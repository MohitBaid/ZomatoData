An extremely small parlour near the Elgin Crossing, Amul is one of those places where the ice-creams are just delicious & wonderful but the seating is a let-down.They just have 8-10 chairs without any tables.
If you want to eat some simple, not too fancy but delicious dessert without spending much, this is a really good joint !!
Had taken "TRAFFIC JAM" which consisted of 8 scoops of ice-cream(flavours of your choice) with toppings of nuts, choco chips, cheeries etc.It was definitely a delight !! :D

Visited Amul Icecream Parlour in Lake mall , Rashbihari Avenue but can't find the place in zomato. As I liked the ice cream very much so I thought of rating the parlour on the basis of the taste not by the location. I have tried the tuty fruity ice cream here and it tasted delicious. Next time I am surely gonna try the icecream rolls. They really looked yummy when I noticed the live making of the rolls. Keep it up!üëç

Sudden find while heading towards forum. Nice flavours present here and the server was excellent. For like 7scoops of premium ice cream like rajbhog, choco chips, rabri malai ,etc the cost came to around 360. Any topping u ask for is given. It was a delight to eat here. Sitting space also available.

I was at the Lake Mall branch and had the Oreo Loves Brownie Ice-cream Roll and the Mango Roll. It was no doubt heavenly. The staff was very much helpful and helped us to select which flavour to try.

This small parlour is located near Sambhunath Pandit Hospital in Elgin Road area. Surprisingly, this is the only Amul parlour that is listed in Zomato even though they have many stores across the city. This is a gem of a place! The usual Amul items are all available here. The U.S.P. of this place is the element of surprise they provide by serving many items which we do not really link with Amul. The pizza they serve is very delicious. The toppings complement the bread really well and the quantity of the toppings make the pizza taste so good. All the ice-cream flavours of this brand are available here. A good outlet with extremely courteous staff. I would love to visit this place again in the future to try out some of their other items.

This outlet is located on the lane opposite the PC Chandra jewellers shop,Elgin. And I am so in love with this place! Right from the number of choices available in ice-creams to their toppings that compliment the flavours so well,to the service everything is on point! They also serve delicious pizza-that actually comes as a frozen food which they thaw and then bake! It comes with so much of cheese and toppings that its one of the best vegetarian pizzas that I have tried! A must try! I have tried all yes all their flavours, blackcurrant being my favourite-it actually has bits of blackcurrant in it! It's superb!! Pocket pinch too is extremely reasonable! Also when Amul butter hoarding takes place (that is when there is a shortage of Amul butter in the market and shops sell them for a greater price), one can actually come here and take butter from here which is sold at the printed price itself! This place is a must visit for all :)

Located on Elgin road near Forum Mall it is a small ice cream parlour. You will get varieties in ice cream flavours, affordable price. The taste is also good. Must visit if you are looking for sweet refreshments.

Few blocks away from the Forum Mall, you will find this Ice Cream Parlour on Elgin Road standing in solitary without any glamour. However, upon entering you will find many types of scoops along with cup ice creams available.

It is an air conditioned parlour with 8 chairs for customers to sit and have their time. The pricing of the scoops are reasonable and the lady serving there is polite and very soft spoken.

It is a well recommended visit!
