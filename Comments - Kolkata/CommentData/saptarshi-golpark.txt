DO. NOT. EAT. HERE. We once tried this place out, and ordered chicken fried rice and chilli chicken. The chicken morsels in the fried rice were almost bone-dry and tasted stale. The chilli chicken was watery and was not edible.

This restaurant is located near golpark anjali jeweller's. A pretty old restaurant which has undergone some renovations a few years back.  I used to love their fish fry but my recent visit was pretty disappointing. The quality of food and serial not the same anymore.

Not a bad takeaway place if you know what to order. Though there are lot of other eating joints nearby ,chicken fried rice is good along with chilly chicken    Ask for the one with bone. Quantity is good for 2 people. Their aloo Paratha is also very good.

A mediocre restaurant with a mediocre name and mediocre quality food. I have been to this "restaurant" on more than three occasions, and I have never been more disappointed with the food. It's not about quantity or quality. Its solely about how the food is cooked, which was, according to me, quite unsatisfactory. If you really want cheap food, you can try any other restaurant - there are several in Gariahat. But I will never be here to waste my money ever again.

We ordered the below items and the observations follow:

Mixed Fried Rice-Good in quality and quantity.

Garlic Chicken-Amount of gravy should have been more.Otherwise no complaints as such.

Chilly Chicken-Come with bone and is always rubbery and not to my liking.

I didn't visit this soon so my review will based on previous experience when I lived in the neighbourhood. I used to go there take away, I must say the price were very high compared to the quality they give... Quantity wise very much sufficient for two people. Located beside mouchak golpark.

I was just reminiscing some of my old memories which I had with Mouchak and Hotel Saptarshi while penning down my review for the former. Not many people perhaps know, that these two institutions were under a common branch and associated with each other (Although am not sure, if its still the same or if they have split).

Located right near Golpark Crossing, the location is pretty easy to find. Although, they haven't been able to keep up with their quality as well as ambiance over the years. Had visited last many many years back, so cannot comment on the present circumstances.

I have always been a huge fan of Chilli Chicken. My love for Chilli Chicken began here, as I used to have them while visiting a friend of my father at their Administrative Office along with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. Also at my insistence, sometimes my father was forced to bring it home as well! I remember of having dined here once with my friend some 7-8 years back. The experience wasn't good though.

The rice was under-cooked. And the same chilli-chicken, which I was a fan of was disastrous! The ambiance was shady and the behavior of the staff completely reflected unprofessional attitude. Whatever rating am giving here, is solely for the wonderful childhood memories I have enjoyed! I hope, I would be visiting here someday soon expecting a complete improvement from my previous experience.

Location of this outlet is excellent... it is in the always bustling Gol Park area. Since the Gariahat shopping area is near by,this place should have been an excellent pit stop for tired,happy shoppers eager to quench their thirst and appetite at a place that's reasonably priced and easy on the pocket. At one time it might have been so but not anymore. The place has deteriorated and is quite shabby. It has not been able to keep up with the times and meet the expectations of customers. Doesn't have much variety and a general air of disinterest prevails there. Pakoras and tea were just about OK.

As a kid, this was one place we frequently visited. I loved their Chinese cuisine. 
I still remember the taste of their Chicken soup and Chicken Manchurian. The ambiance was good too. Though now, it has become more of a road side stall.

Saptarshi used to be good at one point of time, but with the changing food habits and people's zeal to experiment , this place really need to pull its socks to stand strong in this market. They were the first to serve biriyani in a 'handi' .

I have not visited this place for years and my rating and review is solely based on my childhood experience. This was my most visited joint for chinese food after Tangra in my childhood. I used to gorge on their sweet corn chicken soup,chicken pakora,fried rice and chili chicken. I still remember they used to give half boiled egg as a topping in their chili chicken. I used to relish everything to my heart's content. Service was good too. Now I only have good old memories with me as I dont live in Kolkata now and sheer nostalgia made me write this review :)

Sheer nostalgia drives me while writing the review. By the late 80's it was my first outside dinning along with my relatives during the Puja shopping at Gariahat. The low - roofed , red couches, and of-course the white round large plates for serving which was served warm to disinfect germs, were unique to me by that time. I still remembered having American Chop suey with sweet & sour Chicken . Apple juice was served by that time..(which is not in the menu now ). After that i visited several times till my college days between 96 to 98. As there were not so many food-joints by that time, the crowd was mostly the couples, roaming around the Dhakuria Lake. I wish to visit the place at least one more time with my younger family members to nurture those child hood memories....

Small place, once part of a hotel, now operates out of its back yard. Don't expect authenticity or much in the way of service. But a good inexpensive place to order in or take out from when the coin does not show up of you don't feel like cooking. Try their prawn pakoras and chilli chicken with fried rice or noodles.
