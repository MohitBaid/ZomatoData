This shop is just next to the most famous biryani joint in barrakpore. Both chicken and mutton biryani are pretty decent in this shop too. The portion is ample, and most of the times you get to choose your piece of meat, and if available they give what you want. The quality of rice is good, soaked in flavor and the meat is tender and succulent.

Best part is that if you are not in mood for biryani you may settle down with plain rice, dal and sabzi with fish curry, or any other non veg curries. Overall a good rice hotel and there's no queue unlike the next shop.
