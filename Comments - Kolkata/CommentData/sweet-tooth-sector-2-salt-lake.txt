Confectionaries.

Although I am not a big fan of cakes and confectionaries, but the fact that I am still putting up a review here is enough to define how exquisite an item is made and served here.

You want a Cartoon Character, call Sweet Tooth
You want a Brand new Bike, call Sweet Tooth
You want a Bungalow, call Sweet Tooth

And yes, they all come in the very colour and flavour you want, at your favourite occasion. :)

Yummy cakes and chocolates.Cakes look amazing along with rich taste. Design and taste, both are in good balance. Good ingredients used, cakes and chocolates absolutely melt in mouth. Would like to have them again and again.
