Tried their Masala fries, which were really good. Also their mixed sauce penne pasta is a must have. Its just perfect. The chole masala fondue is just okay okay. Can be a miss!
Ambience is average but the service is really good.

I m not fully satisfied with that place...not well maintained. Seats are dirty,ambiance is nice but not very good... service is good.. you do not have to wait much time for your order.. but quantity of food is not satisfactory when comparing with the price...one and only thing which i liked was there presentation of food..otherwise i m not satisfied with them...taste was good but i can't say very good...now coming to the food one by one..
SOUP: we ordered spicy sweet corn and tomato. It was good..quantity was enough for one..presentation was impressieve..cost was rs190 (recomanded)
NIBBLES: we had guacamole phuchka.. i did not found so much speciality in it..it seems very ordinary...but taste was good...the cost of this was 250 rs without GST for 6 phuchka which i think too much overpriced. They were not so tasty or not so special that one should pay rs 250 for it...
Except this we ordered spanakopita tarts from chef's global kitchen. I did not like this item as it was too much cheesy... i like cheese but it was too much that i could not tolerate the smell and taste of that item. Though it was looking fantastic when it was served. Cost 250 which was overpriced i think for 3 pieces as it was not so much special.

BIG BITES: we tried maxican fried rice as our main course.. quality was good..the can improve it by improving the quality of rice..other than it was satisfactory. But quantity was not sufficient for two... presentation was appreciable...overall i liked it.. cost rs 370 (recomanded )

One thing,i should mention at first which is the GUAVA MARY. I must say, it was awesome...i enjoyed it till the last drop. It was tangy with a great flavour of guava..it was so refreshing...cost rs 190 (must try)

DESSERT: In dessert we tried mocha mousse.. presentation was lovely and the best one among all of we had. Taste was awesome...it was served with hot chocolate syrup.. as i m very fond of chocolate i loved it from my core of heart. Sufficient for two.. cost rs 250 .(Must try)

Located in the heart of Park Street, Hakuna Matata is the go to place for all the vegan food lovers.
With their new Global fusion menu they take food preparation to another level.
Desi Saag Risotto is a must have over here.
The desserts are absolutely mouth - watering with Sinfully Yours and Nolen Gur cheesecake being amongst the best!

This place in the party street of Kolkata is one of the best restaurants serving Vegetarian and Jain food ! They have a wide array of dishes that‚Äôll leave you speechless and desserts which‚Äôll transport you to food heaven ! For mocktails, I tried the Guava Mary which was tangy and refreshing with a great flavour of guava. The Spicy Sweet Corn Tomato soup was a hit in your mouth tasty dish ! Nibbles included Spanakopita Tart, Mini Baked Crostini, Guacamole Phuchka ( which is a must try ) and Acapulco Tostada. All of them were so tasty that I‚Äôm a loss of words to describe them ! And for Main Course I had the Thai Green Curry which was served with sticky rice and eggplant fritters ! And for a Bengali this dish was a trip down memory lane with it‚Äôs combination of flavours ! Now coming to the best part which was the desserts, I had Mocha Mousse and Nolen Gur Cheesecake both of which‚Äôll leave you gobsmacked and you‚Äôll keep on going for more and more ! This place is a must visit. Enjoy !

‚ÄúHakuna Matata‚Äù,this phrase always reminds me the song in the movie ‚ÄòThe Lion King‚Äô. One should actually don‚Äôt need to worry (hakuna matata means no worry) when a restaurant is providing you delicious and divine dishes to fulfil your hunger. Located in the prime location of Park Street, this restaurant knows how to make your vegetarian dish mouth-watering.

Started with Spicy Sweet Corn Tomato Soup, it was enjoyable.

Guacamole Puchka was terrific in taste, a recommended one.

Spanakopita Tart was excellent, another recommended one of them in starters.

Mini Baked Crostini was delicious and flavourful.

Acapulco Tostada was amazingly tasty, one should try this.

In mock tails, Guava Mary was impressive.

In main course, Thai green curry was a true winner, it‚Äôs superb in taste with the rice, a must try.

When it comes to dessert, Hakuna Matata is a true winner. Mocha Mousse was yummy and wonderful.

Nolen gur cheesecake was ‚Äòsplendid ‚Äòin one word, it will mesmerize your heart, brilliant.

Thank you so much Hakuna Matata for taking such wonderful care of us during our visit. Management and staffs were so well behaved. All in all, a perfect dining!!

Located in the heart of Park Street nearby to the Hard Rock Cafe!
Hakuna Matata is a break for the law of vegan foods.
Been to this place for a family dining.
Heard about this place quite a long time for some amazing vegetarian foods and so experienced having a such awesome experience with vegetarian food.
Ordered for
Special tea: This exactly needs 20 mins to take the exact smell of the jasmine from a seed that gets bursted in the warm water and takes the form of a jasmine flower. The smell is amazing.

Guava mary : This is the recommended drink. It's spicy in taste with the guava pulp. It's amazing.

Spicy corn soup: it's also something I really liked.The blending of tomato soup and corn flakes and a bit on the spicy note.

Spanakopita Tart: It's served in spinach crushed and boiled and Mixed with masala and served in a dish with some decor.

Guacamole puchka: The puchka is amazing in taste. The bombay style puchka is introduced in the dish and the imli curry and the pudina chutney tasted amazing in taste!

Thai Green Curry : The thai curry along with the coconut sticky rice serves the best.It is served with the traditional 'begun' bhaja to add a crispyness to the taste.

The end was with some best dessert across the town.The mocha mousse tasted amazing with the Chocolate brownie and the Chocolate syrup. The blending was Smooth and it was a ending with a sweet note.

Services was awesome. The waiters were friendly.
Food quantity and quality was great.
The owner's were friendly and was quite interactive with selection of the best dish .

Located at the heart of Park Street just opposite Kwality Restaurant.
The place has amazing decor and a great ambience. The staff is very friendly and good.This place has an amazing ability to lighten up your mood with its great food and ambience.
Now coming to the food
*Guava Mary (Recommended)
It was one of those very few spicy drinks which I liked.It was quite refreshing.
*Spicy Sweet Corn Soup (Recommended)
I was having a bad cold hence I ordered a soup and it did not disappoint me.Tangy and  Spicy, it really worked out well for me.
*Spanakopita Tart (Strongly Recommended)
This was a blast of flavours for the taste buds.This was probably the showstopper for me.
*Mini Baked Crostini (Recommended)
This was amazing too.
*Guacamole Puchka 
Guacamole and Puchka really worked out well.
*Acapulco Toastada
This was good too.
*Thai Green Curry (Recommended)
This consisted of a flavourful Thai green curry along with good portion of sticky rice and some brinjal fritters.The quantity was good.
*Mocha Mousse (Strongly Recommended)
Sweetness overloaded. I have no words to describe this beauty.Only thing I can say is that you need to taste it to know it.
*Nolen Gur Cheesecake (Strongly Recommended)
This is basically Cheesecake Infused with Bengal's very own palm jaggery.Being a Bengali you just can't leave this place without trying this piece of beauty and that too during Winters.This was just amazing.
I can go back to this place just to have the lovely desserts they serve.

Just as the name 'Hakuna Matata' suggests 'No Worries',this place has the amazing ability to leave you without any worries with its lip-smacking flavours.

Hakuna Matata, which means "No worries" totally justifies it's name. Located at the heart of Park Street, is a perfect place to taste some really scrumptious vegetarian delicacies. The d√©cor is extremely classy and vibrant. You're bound to love the ambience here. The Christmas carols playing in the background adds up to the mood. The food is absolutely extraordinary. Never had such lip-smacking vegetarian food before. Each and every dish is super yum. Some of the recommended dishes :-
‚Ä¢ Spicy Sweet Corn Soup
‚Ä¢ Spanakopita Tart
‚Ä¢ Mini Baked Crostini (must try)
‚Ä¢ Guacamole Puchka
‚Ä¢ Acapulco Tostada
‚Ä¢ Thai Green Curry (must)
‚Ä¢ Mocha Mousse (strongly recommended)
The dessert was so good that I couldn't stop having it until the last bite. This is place too good and if you still haven't been here give it a visit soon and enjoy the lovely atmosphere!

When you're in park street, you had to try some restaurant. This time we were in hurry and it was Christmas. Also, our pocket pinch was very low. So we decided to try this "Totally-Vegetarian" restaurant. The restaurant is very beautiful. I personally, liked the qoutations on the walls.

Coming to the food part, we ordered just "Margarita pizza". We were two people, so it was enough for both of us. And, trust me when I say this - the pizza was so delicious. It contained only cheese and tomatoes, still the taste was on point.

Although, basic things weren't on the table. Like - tissue papers, oregano - chilli flakes, sauce. We didn't liked that part. But otherwise, will give it a second try for sure. To have more food. ^_^

It was truly an amazing experience. Since I was looking for fusion taste Hakuna Matata became my one stop destination for global fusion cuisine. Food is  excellent in taste but what is more beautiful and stunning is their presentation. The food is really a visual treat. we ordered Indian shaslik platter,  Asian platter, Litti choka, pani puri and nolen gur cheesecake along with few mocktail and trust me it's really difficult to choose which tastes better because everything was unique in its taste... Although this restaurant is pure veg still it will appeal to the most hardcore non veg lovers...thanks to Chef Buvan for personally attending us and suggesting his specialities...

This outlet was pretty good vegetarian ( Mexican and Italian ) and well-decorated restaurant. We ordered Matata cooler which was basically watermelon mocktail and it was quite good, also chickpea masala enchil was good and here the special thing in winter was gur cheesecake. Here service was not as much as expected. Though I think the delay in serving food for the pressure of Christmas event.

Ordered a soup. Was more than just surprised by the quantity.. A 5 year old was left with an empty stomach after having the amount of soup served.. And he also had two slices of bread to go with it, mind you! For a 4+ rated restaurant, that charged me approximately 200 for one portion of a mushroom soup, this is pretty disappointing! I am seriously wondering whether I was served an incorrect order.. Maybe someone ordered half a portion & that was sent to me?

Ambience : 3/5
Food : 3.5/5
Staff : 4/5
Service : 3.5/5

visited this on Christmas Eve with family..
ordered white sauce pasta, arabian pasta, pizza, tart, chickpea, orange mohito and some coke..
spanakopita tart or simple the tart was quintessentially amazing in taste..

a good place for the vegans in park street area.. only flaw is it's high price and less quantity of food..

Went there yesterday evening with my friend. The ambience was nice, the staff knew their way around the menus. We took what our server suggested, croquet, toastada, kit-kat shake, and nolen gur er cheesecake. The food was delicious. We also took afghani paneer which was actually a bit bland. A special mention should be made about the cheesecake which was so good, we had to order another one. The price is also reasonable, considering the quality of food they serve. But the quantity could be a bit more, in my honest opinion. Nonetheless, I will be going back there to try out other delicacies they offer.

Absolutely crappy place. 
A vegetarian restaurant with nice interiors. Visited during the pujas. The place was well decorated with confetti and ribbons. Decorations made the place look festive. Unfortunately the food didn't match the expectations. The high price along with the less quantities and absolutely so so taste didn't make a great combo for us. Probably wouldn't visit again. Besides, being a vegetarian joint the place also lacks variety in the menu. Even the service wasn't good enough as the staffs stopped us from  clicking photos of the decorations . Totally Disappointed.

A nice place with Quirky Decor. It's a decent veg restaurant in a very nice location.¬†
we tried just 2 dishes here, which were pretty amazing.
we had our Custom-made Pizza were we had selected our crust, sauce and toppings, baked perfectly golden brown in wood- fire.
The dessert we chose was sinfully yours. It is one of the best desserts we ever had. Layers of different kind of chocolates, which will take every ice cream lover to heaven in every bite.

I happened to visiting this quirky and vibrant place, when they had launched their new array of desserts. 
And I wasn't less than surprised. 
They greeted us with mini ice lollies which was refreshing. 
We tasted a lot of amazing items. 
Ice tea flavoured jello, garnished with hakuna matata special house sauce. This was unique. 
Also had the double chocolate fudge cake , highly recommended. 
Lemon tart, Mango cheesecake, mousse in a chocolate edible cup, the chocolate bomb and hakuna matata fresh fruit pizza. 
These were all unbelievably unique and presentation was on point. 

I being a dessert freak, was really happy after my visit. You shouldn't miss these for sure. :)

Today I came to this Restaurant suggested by my friend Mr.Arpit Diwedi
He told Its a great Place for Vegetarian and hygiene, and a Variety Fusion Food from All Major Region international Middle East etc. So on this very Idea and being a chef, and foodie I travel a lot Singapore,USA, and every place in India

Now let me tell you about Hakuna Matata
It‚Äôs in the Park Street, we were 35 People booked the place 13Kids, 12 Ladies and 12 Gentle man, we were greeted by the doorman, they Have separate parking at the back Of the Restaurant also which is again monitored by security. 
The Restaurant is well designed, With wish tree on the right side inside the restaurant and complete different decor, with mezzanine Floor on top.
We started with Felafel with Pita, Masala Fries, Greek Pizza, potato wedges, Cheese Burst Croquette, Pita Naan Pakoda, bruschetta with Mushroom and cherry tomato and for the drink ladies tried Guava Mary, spicy twist, cold coffee, and detox Drink Virgin Mojito, and Orange Mojito. To our surprise all the starters and the drinks well complemented, I can say its just amazing. For the main course all had Individual dishes and Hakuna Quesadillas, Make your own Enchiladas, kali dal Makhani with laccha Paratha, Baked Kati Roll, Desi Tiffin, Paneer Tikka Masala, lasagne Vegge, Hummus Quesadillas, Veg Au Gratin, Asian Platter, Stir fried Vegetable, Malaysian Tofu Cur≈ïy, 
Thai Green Cur≈ïy with sticky Rice
Again to our surprise its just great and awesome I am and all my family and friend and we‚Äôre just taken away, the flavor were Mild, wholesome and just I can say that is it. 
This Restaurant is just doing great job. 
Appreciate the owners for the wonderful concept
And I wish they should take this culture to every place in India like BANGALORE in Electronic City, and other places too.

We all loved it.

Hello foodies,
I visited the place today with my family. My niece who is a year old was also with us so we requested for a baby chair. We got that. The chair was not at all clean and considering it was a baby chair it should have been clean as kids are very prone to infections. We asked the waiter to clean it. He just took a tissue and rubbed slightly. However there was no difference so we ourselves cleaned it as it was more of a concern to us. 
We ordered Afghani paneer, baby corn and rice wrap. We ordered three starters as the waiter told us that their starters are really good. Baby corn was fine. Rice wrap was bad and Afghani paneer had no taste. Also after each item being served, the waiter kept on asking how it was and I told him that I'll write a feedback but he kept on standing there and would not move until I told him how was the food. In the main course we ordered desi tiffin and Greek pizza. We ordered Greek pizza as it had cucumber along with other veggies (as per the description in the menu). When it was served it just tasted cucumber. I was wondering if I had to eat cucumber then I would have eaten I simple cucumber rather than paying so much. Desi tiffin was good. The waiter constantly was insisting us to order some drinks but after tasting the starters we decided not to considering their food quality is not that great. Also he insisted us to order desserts. He preferred going to flurry's to eat desserts rather than having anything from there. The place is full of mosquitoes so be careful when you step inside the place.
I will never recommend the place to anyone.

A loud thud of lightning and long spell of showers led us into this moderately spaced restaurant, overlooking a small lit up mocktail bar complimented by quirky decor, including a stairway to the wall of fame which leads to a more spacious level for hogging on.The amount of awe I was filled in by the food presentation,the courteous staff and the quick service was equally counteracted by the food quality.It was a huge disappointment to my taste buds.
We had ordered the following
1.Masala fries-Fries acompanied with a tangy cheesy sauce,the quantity was pretty less in comparision to its steep price.
2.Flavoured hummus( accompanied by beetroot cutlets and a white thick sauce)-The cutlets were nicely cooked and flavoured but the hummus tasted bland,even the sauce failed to save its significant other.
3.Afghani Paneer bites-Again,the presentation was stunning but the savourless paneer failed to reciprocate.
The management was very amiable and courteous.They served us chocolate paans in order to make up for their delay in service.Overall rating food-3/5, Ambience-4/5,Presentation-4.5/5,Management-4/5.Looking to come back soon and try some other dishes!

I'm a tad biased towards non-veg food because chicken is everything but this place isn't half bad.
Although, I'd say it's pricey, but that's a given because it's situated in Park Street. Portions are satisfactory.
We went there in a group on a very busy holiday evening.
The smoothies are good. We took a mixed sauce pasta which was well cooked.
They have a pretty wall, you can leave personal messages on stick on papers. Appreciate the idea.

Also, in case you want alcohol, you need an ID no matter how 21 you look!

Located just opposite Park Hotel in the heart of Park Street , Hakuna Matata which means "No worries " actually serves amazing vegetarian delicacies,so you dont have to worry once you come here. If you are looking for Global cuisine,then you are definitely at the right place. 

WHAT I ORDERED :

MOCKTAILS : 

1.CHERRY TWIST : Served in cycle themed table stand, this drink was quite refreshing for a start ,Do try . 

2. ELDER FLOWER TWIST : A tinge of ginger , makes this mocktail another class drink from this place .

3. TIBETIAN THUKPA SOUP : Served in a Coconut , this soup will definitely soothe you . They also give Laccha paratha which serves as an additional blend.

4.MANCHURIAN VADA PAO : I hope you have eaten vada pao ,but manchurian vada pao is something completely new. Do try .

5.RETRIED BEANS TAQUITOES : Another amazing dish from this place .

6.PINDI CHHOLE TACOS : If you already love tacos , then this is completely new version of tacos .It was so good ,I ordered another .

7.LEBANESE ROLL : One of the best if you are of thinking of starters from this place. Do order. 

8.ASIAN PLATTER 

9. DESI TIFFIN : Served in a old schooled style metal tiffin box , its contains a wide variety of items ,and it is quite filling. The gazar ka halua is an added bonus in the box

10. CHICKPEA MASALA ENCHILADA 

11. SMOKEY APPLE PIE : Was too amazing , the crispy crust on the outside and the apple inside , was too good. A must try dessert 

12. NOLEN GUR CHEESECAKE : When bengali sweets meet american cuisine, a product like nolen gur cheesecake comes out and trust me it will melt in your mouth in a jiffy. Do order. Do try. Thank me later . 

The staff in the place was very courteous, food was served in time ,and the ambience was totally very awesome. Must visit

Located at the heart of the city,this two storeyed restaurant is surely gonna mesmerize you;first with its all around bright yellow color interiors and then with its food.The Stick-it wishing tree,trek people coming down the rope,inverted hanging wine glasses on the roof and many other things is surely gonna attract your attention as you enter this 75 seater (approx) restaurant which specializes in vegetarian global fusion cuisine.They keep on innovating their menu according to the seasons and always come up with something so phenomenal that it will leave you awe-struck.The same happened with me yesterday after trying some of the dishes mentioned below-

1:Cherry twist 
2:Pindi chole tacos
3:Refries beans taquitos
4:Desi tiffin
5:Chikpea masala enchiladas
6:Manchurian vada pav
7:Nolen gur cheesecake
8:Smoked apple pie

All the above mocktail and dishes are a must try and if you are ending your meal without having the desserts from this place then you will be missing at the best desserts in town.

Food-5/5
Ambiance-5/5

I knew from previous reviews I'd read that this is a highly rated and popular place in Park Street. Now I see why. I dropped in at what is probably an unsual time for this place - mid-afternoon - just for amazing mocktails because I had several hours to spend somehow and I was nearby.A perfect place for Vegetarian lovers. Situated just opposite The Park. It is basically a purely veg restaurant where after having my meal will recommend all the veg lovers to go and dine in to this place. Really, being a die hard fan of non vegetarian foods, this had won my heart.¬†

My attention could't help being drawn to bold, colorful art on every wall, but it was the scene through the large tree and  colourful decorations on ceiling  that I couldn't take my eyes off. It was a thick stand of tall beautiful trees on wall. Interior of the restaurant was beautiful too.

Must Order :

MOCKTAILS :

1) Cherry Twist
2) Elder Flower Twist

SOUP :

1) Tibetan Thukpa Soup

STARTERS:

1) Manchurian Vada Pav
2) Retried Beans Taquitoes
3) Pindi Chhole Tacos

MAINS COURSES :

1) Asian Platter
2) Desi Tiffin
3) Chikpea Masala Enchilada

DESSERETS :

1) Nolen Gur Cheese Cake
2) Smoky Apple Pie

Overall, this restaurant is quite spacious and the decor and their ambience is lovely. The staff and owners are friendly. If you want to try vegan food, no second thoughts, Hakuna Matata is the place. Nice, fresh and delicious food. Highly Recommended.

Coming to the most important part: the food. It's quite tasty! The menu is fresh and carefully curated, with a lot of new items to try out. We had a variety of dishes but I'll tell you my absolute favourites. The Elder Flower Twist and the Spicy Twist drinks are a definite must try. The Lebanese Roll, Manchurian Vada Pav, Desi Tiffin were really delicious and filling! One thing for sure is that you won't leave the restaurant with an empty stomach since it's quite filling.
Now for the dessert, we had the Smoky Apple pie and the Nolen Gur cheesecake. I have to tell you that the apple pie was the best that I've had. The perfect mix of apple and cinnamon! The cheesecake also was equally tasty! Must, must try!

'Hakuna Matata- it means no worries' as said by Timon and Pumba of the lion king, this place totally justifies its name. The place is beautifully decorated and has such an amazing positive vibe that you can't help but will definitely fall in love with it. It is a veg joint and trust me when I say this - they serve some lip-smacking veg dishes and that wouldn't let you miss non-veg even for a tiny winy second. 
Today me and few of my friends went there for lunch. And returned home mind blown. 
We had ordered the following things-
Mocktails:
~Berry Twist
~Elder Flower Twist
~Spicy Twist
All the three mocktails were unique and visually enticing because of their presentation. The berry twist and flower twist were refreshing while the spicy twist had an amazing chatpata taste. Loved all the three drinks very much. 

Soup:
~Tibetan Thukpa Soup 
It tasted awesome and the laccha parhantha serves with it was also amazing. 

Starters:
~Pindi Chhole Tacos
Tacos filled with pindi chole topped kafir lime infused yoghurt. It was one of a kind dish and tastes great
~Lebanese Rolls
Flat bread rolled with hummus and mini veg patties. One of the rolls had a chickpea hummus while the othe one had a beetroot hummus. Both tasted excellent. 
~Retried Beans Taquitoes 
Served with salsa and kafir lime infused yoghurt, the Taquitoes were heavenly. Loved the dish and also the dips a lot. 
~Manchurian Vada Pav
Vada pav with a twist. Generally I find the traditional vada pav very dry and not quite of my liking but this one was different. It was great. I wish traditional vada pavs were like this one. Tasty and amazing! 

Main Course:
~Chickpea Masala Enchilada 
One word for it- lip-smacking. 
~Tiffin Box
This one came like e surprise. It was a huge box filled with small buckets of Jeera Rice, Alu Qorma, Dal Makhani and another sabzi kind of thing, achaar, salad and Gajar ka halwa. The tiffin box was sumptuous and each and every dish present there were excellent. Loved every bit of it! 

Desserts:
~Smoked Apple Pie
Served with Vanilla ice cream, this dessert was great. Perfectly cooked and had a cinnamon flavour. Loved it. 
~Nolen Gur Cheesecake 
The show stealer indeed! Tasted heavenly. A must must try. 

All the dishes had unique and amazing presentation and it is really praiseworthy. 
The staffs are very well behaved and helpful and service was prompt. Will definitely visit again ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hakuna Matata has been serving some really good vegetarian food for sometime now but after a long wait this was my first visit to the place,I along with a few friends decided to visit it today for lunch and the food as expected was amazing.

Heres what we ordered:

Beverages and Starters:

Cherry Twist: A really refreshing cherry drink which I loved because the flavour of the cherry was not overpowering as it happens in most places.

Tibetian Thukpa Soup: Served in a very unique manner inside a DAAB and with laccha paratha,the soup was flavourful and the presentation unique.

Retried Beans Taquitoes: These were the perfect starters served with two amazing dips,really amazing.

Main Course:

Desi Tiffin: Served in the style of a tiffin box,it had a variety of items inside ranging from aloo tikki chaat,jeera rice,korma aloo,dal makhani,laccha paratha,salad,papad to gajar ka halwa.All the items were really delicious totally loved it.

Chickpea Masala Enchilada: This dish tasted decent too and was very filling.

Dessert:

NolenGur Cheese Cake:This was heavenly,the taste was amazing and hands down one of the best dessert that I have had.

Highly Recommended if you want to have delicious vegetarian food and amazing desserts.

Soup:Tibetan thupka soup:this was somewhat too amazing for the winter.. served in a green coconut cut amazingly flavoured one with noodles and served with paratha..all make up a deadly hit!!
Munchurian vada pav:yess you heard it right ..it's the vada pav with the Chinese twist and a must have one.
Retried beans taquitoes:it was like spring rolls filled with perfectly spiced beans and garnishment and the dips were equally brilliant
Lebanese Roll:pita bread stuffed with veg tikkis,humus dressed veggies and garnished with some beet root flavoured hummus that simply made it amazing!!
Pindi chole tacos:this were super healthy and non oily
Tacos with a rajma filling that tasted too good
Mains:
Desi tiffin:now this is a complete meal one should definitely have here consisting of jeera  rice,lachha paratha,the potato curry with twist ofcoconut flavor ruled my taste buds,dal makhani,papad,achar,gajar ka halwa and pickled salad..this was like a dream tiffin box I won't be ashamed to carry it anywhere and everywhere!!
Chick pea masala Enchilada:This was amazing with pita bread stuffed with chickpeas in perfect masalas and the whole thing was probably baked with cheesy dressing..this was just a lip smacking one
Desserts:
Nolen gur cheese cake: probably the best cheesecake cake with a twist of Bengal in town. Don't miss it guys!!
Smokey apple pie:the crunchy outer pie crust with the cinnamon flavour that just creats the big bang on you taste buds and makes you carve for more and more!!
All in all this was probably the best vegan place I have been to so farüíü

Unique in its own way . I never had anything that uniquely served specially the drinks. We had tried almost every good thin there...so let's get started.

Food: Mexican pizza ,  baby corn as starters.

Drinks: Virgin mojito, orange mojito, chocolate milk shake and many more 

Prize : 2816 for 7 seven drinks and 4 mains which is a bit okay.

Went during their second anniversary‚Ä¶!! A nice offer of giving all the items at half prices for two days on their all items in the menu. Ambience was good, having ground floor and mezzanine floor for dine in. It is basically a purely veg restaurant where after having my meal will recommend all the veg lovers to go and dine in to this place. Really, being a die hard fan of non vegetarian foods, this had won my heart. Highly Recommended.
                    

Veg Biryani served with egg plant salan and raita ‚Äì Perfectly cooked with awesome taste. It‚Äôs neither light nor spicy. Perfect for two persons. They provided me the platter with raita and baingan (egg plant) salan. The salan was lajawaab‚Ä¶ Perfectly going with the biryani.

Smoky apple pie with vanilla ice cream‚Äì The pie was just awesome. It tasted heaven and the pie is nicely going with the vanilla flavor ice cream. A spoon of pie with a spoon of vanilla ice cream. Perfect‚Ä¶!! The apple inside was cooked having a smoky aroma in it. Lovely..!!

Went for a lunch meal at this 2 year european cafe. 
The best part about them is the variety in cuisine and the thoughtful presentation of the fusion food that they serve. 
Taste wise, food is good. Nothing more. 
Ambience, small but good. 
Not worth the price you pay unless you have some discount deal.

Hakuna Matata is one of the few restaurants that serves Continental, Mexican, Italian cuisines and is vegetarian at the same time. Sounds like a heaven for vegetarians. It was our second visit yesterday for a late lunch and we had ordered for Mexican Fried Rice and Cheese Burst Croquettes for food and Matata Cooler and Cherry Twist for Drinks. Food was very tasty and beautifully presented. I personally did not like the drinks much as they were too bland for my taste. Staff is friendly. As the place wasn't crowded, service was fast. Located on park Street, restaurant is quite spacious with two floors. A service charge of 5% is charged.They served pan flavoured handmade chocolates as complementary which was good. Alcohol is not served. Washrooms and Baby chairs are available.

Situated in the heart of Park Street, Hakuna is a must go for everyone who loves fusion food.¬†
Nice subtle music and a quirky decor add to the ambience.

All their dishes are actually mouth watering, especially their nachos.
The global menu and the jain menu are also very attractive.
What gives this a 5 star rating? The presentation, the quality of food and the courteous staff.

One of the many places in parkstreet but offers a fushion of flavours. I tried their special hakuna quesdilas. Was a bit hesitant since it was a veg place but the taste was nice. There are a variety of other interesting fushions they had. The service was good. An upscale place in my books.

I was expecting a lot from Hakuna Matata but it didn't match to what I though. I've my bday treat there. 
We ordered Pizza which was Quite Good, everyone liked it. Second we had Lasagne which was not at all good, I didn't like it's filling. Last we had Litti Choka Shots which was liked by everyone but it was very expensive, according to me I was not worth it, also the litti could be more hot then it was. 
I liked its Ambience & the behavior of staff which is the reason for rating it 3*!

We hv ordered Mexican rice which was not at all tasty.It was lyk we are eating risotto.And one main thing which was really disappointing was that they hv itself kept a change of rs 5.Its there duty to give the full change to customers whether it's rs 5 only.And let customers decide hw much they want to leave.Ambience was okk okk.But it's pure vegetarian and Jain food is also available that's it's plus point.And lastly it serves chocolate paan with Billüëç

The Veg cafe at Park Street tough a bit overpriced, is a nice place for some quick bites.
The services from the staffs were as good as they could've been so no complaints there. The ambience is pretty and the decorations really caught my eye.

While my visit with my friend, we had the the following

I ordered a papri chaat and for the price the quantity was not satisfying enough but I cannot disagree that this was probably the most fancy looking chaat I've had till date. But the most important part is how it tasted and I will say this, if I go there again I'll have it again. It was delicious.

My friend ordered a Falafel in Pita Pockets and while again the quantity was not enough to fill you up, the quality and presentation were top notch.

For beverages, my coffee wouldn't need a review, it was coffee and it tasted so, nothing to complain.

For desserts the Mocha Mousse was definitely the reason I'd recommend this place. It was presented in a beautiful way just like all the other dishes and it was absolutely delicious. I'd recommend everyone to try this out if not anything else !

Went in for an evening snack and coffee. Very pleasant place. Good service. Innovative fusion veggie snacks and meals available . Had a plate of three Spanakopita Tarts (one in picture) creamy garlic spinach¬† tarts with cucumber yoghurt dollop. Very tasty. Got a bonus chocolate with gulkand inside without any demands or hints. Made a promise to myself to try out other items from time to time, despite being a roaring non-veg type.

This is a veg cafe located at Park street opposite The Park Hotel. The place is nice, a bit overpriced, yes, but at the end, it's nice. The ambience is pretty and the service from the staff was top notch. The crafty presentation of the dishes are worth of appreciation. I liked the beverages and the desert more than the indian starters and the munchies as they call it. I'll update my review once I cover the rest of the menu.

1. Falafel in Pita Pockets - It was quite okay in quantity, it was well cooked and well presented. It tasted delicious, nothing to compain here.

2. Hakuna Papri Chaat - My friend ordered this. Not the best in the quantity, but on the better note, it didn't taste bad. It was well cooked and actually was not at all disappointing but sure to say, you'll find better things to order from the menu.

3. Double Chocolate Oreo Shake - I loved this shake. This was one of the better Oreo shakes I've had till date. The double chocolate addition surely did make it a lot more enjoyable. Definitely worth a try.

4. Coffee - Just a coffee. Not gonna drag this one.

5. Mocha Mousse - The best part of this visit, the desert. This was presented in such a beautiful way that makes you to just keep looking at it. On the taste department, this was absolutely stunning, beautiful to the core. Definitely having this again the next time ai visit.

The only veg eatery after Rajdhani and the only veg cafe on Park Street main road. The experience actually symbolizes the term "Hakuna Matata" or "No worries".
We just ordered four dishes including two coolers.
Nibbles Platter(Recommended): Crispy Potato Fries in a decorated bucket, Crispy cheesy Veg cutlet, Crispy Chilly Babycorn again served in a bucket and Veg Steam Momo; each in adequate quantity and rich in taste. The cheesy gooey veg cutlet was crispy and has abundant cheese. The crispy potato and the Babycorn added the spiciness in the platter while the veggie loaded in the momo neutralized the taste of the platter. Loved it totally.
Matata Cooler (Recommended) : A Watermelon drink with coconut base served in a flask which would remind you of your science laboratory and a perfect conversation starter. A healthy and a refreshing drink taking the food experience to the next level.
Grilled Veggie Lasagne (Recommended): This one was a surprise and the staff at the cafe urged us to taste their speciality. Even though it took a bit of time for preparation, this one was the best of all. A cheese base with a veg stuffing and a soft covering of cheese and flour garnished with crispy rings. Wow! it looked stunning and tasted awesome. Dont forget to try this.
Blueberry Punch: An icy cooler with mint was another refresher in the order with nice blend of frozen blueberry punch.
I had ordered these 4 items but I was surprised that all were equally good and must try. I feel to try other dishes and visit more often. 
No doubt you would have already got an idea how colorful the interiors of the cafe is from the photo section of the cafe.
Why not choose this as your next foodstop?

If you are vegetarian and want to enjoy Durga Puja special dinner with your loved one and family in a romantic vegetarian restaurant then your search is over, welcome to ‚ÄúHakuna Matata‚Äù, located in Park Street. They launch some Durga Puja special menu, to make these festival days more special.¬†

The place divided into two section, ground floor and first floor. The interior decoration is amazing. The upstairs created beautifully with a wish tree where you can put the colourful sticky notes writing you like and dislike about the restaurant. The hanging wooden structures from ceiling are very creative and the background music, perfect lightning creates a charming ambiance. 

Recently I and my fellow foodie friends visited the place during the Durga Puja Special Menu launch. The special menu was crafted perfectly by adding different type of delicious veg starter, main course and dessert.
¬†

Beverages:

Double Chocolate Oreo Milk Shake- Very thick and loaded with lots of chocolate. The garnishing was very impressive. It was Yumilicious.

Appetizer: 

Pind Chole Tacos ‚Äì Tacos is a well-known Mexican dish, and they made it unique version of tacos by adding a special stuffing which was a mixture of chole and chopped onion, coriander, salsa, guacamole, tomatoes & lettuce. Topped with white cream. Crunchy and spicy.

Fajitas: Another version of tacos, folded tortilla with different types of stuffing. You can add as you like. They served those stuffing in small size buckets. 

Main Course: 

Veg Au Gratin: Veggies like carrots, peas, beans drowned in white sauce, topped generously with cheese, and baked till the cheese melts. A traditional continental delicacy served with warm and crisp breads. Finger licking preparation specially for cheese lovers.

Asian Platter ‚Äì A specially crafted veg platter where you will get coconut rice with a layer of butter, Thai green curry, paneer satay and different types of stir-fried veggies. Thai green curry was superbly delicious.¬†

Flavoured Hummus & Pita Bread- Slices of flavoured Hummus & Pita bread served with two delicious dips. Like it.

Sweet Potato Dabeli- Well this is something you need to try whenever you visited the place. This spicy snack made by mixing boiled potatoes with a dabeli masala, and putting the mixture between pav (buns) and served with chutney made from tamarind, date, garlic, red chilies, etc. and garnished with pomegranate and crisp. It‚Äôs a mixture of sweet and tangy flavours. 

Desserts: Hakuna Matata is very famous for their special signature dessert. You can surely make a visit this place to try their special dessert. For Durga Puja purpose they arranged a special dessert known as 

Dark Chocolate Explosion- I can say in every corner of this dessert you will get the dark chocolate. Chef created this dessert infront of us and it was a hell of a show. A big size dark chocolate ball filled with ice cream crushed and mixed with a layer of liquid chocolates, colourful gems along with lots of pomegranates. It was an explosion of sweetness and taste. Amazing.

Apart from that, they offered,

Apple Pie: Sweet pie made with apples and served with whipped cream alongside cheddar cheese. Very tasty.

Sinful Chocolate Cheese Cake ‚Äì Cheese cake covered with chocolate, crushed cookie and topped with liquid dark chocolate. Insanely delicious. Must Try.

One of kind experience we have in this place. One of the best Veg Restaurant in Kolkata without any doubt. Quality and quantity both are satisfactory. Prices are also very reasonable. Staffs are very friendly and well behaved. A special thanks to entire team of¬† Hakuna Matata & Chef for these amazing lip-smacking dishes.Delicious moments spent. Good Food Feel Good.

It was all suddenly planned. The decor is simple yet pretty, colorful to be precise. Firstly, it is not for people who like to have non vegetarian food whenever they go out somewhere. I had a veg platter which consisted of paratha, daal makhani, aalo ki sabzi. The food wasn't very good. But their hospitality is A1. They give you to try out their seasonal specialities for free. Check it out if you haven't yet.

Good ambience, great food, great service. Mushroom soup was delectable. Lasange, falafel with pita pockets, pizza, cheese burst croquettes everything was too good. Their gur cheesecake is a must try. At d end unlike other restaurants generally which serve mint toffees, they serve amazing chocolates with paan filling inside. And it's reasonable enough for a restaurant in park strt with everything so good.

Visited the place with our family and found the food to be excellent. The best veg place in town. They have introduced new indian options in their menu like paneer tikka and kali dal which were a pleasent surprise. The pizzas are highly recommended.

Good ambience, great food, great service. Mushroom soup was delectable. Lasange, falafel with pita pockets, pizza, cheese burst croquettes everything was too good. Their gur cheesecake is a must try. At d end unlike other restaurants generally which serve mint toffees, they serve amazing chocolates with paan filling inside. And it's reasonable enough for a restaurant in park strt with everything so good.

Food is delicious and also liked the garnishing. Staffs are very friendly. One must try the Orange mojito. Ambiance is calm and a good place to hang out. In the beginning ice popsicles and in the last chocolates were offered as good gesture.

Located on park street hakuna matata is  a great restaurant for having veg food. The ambiance and the decors are really great. Also the dining area is large and with the back ground music and the decors the places becomes really lively and a great place to hang out with a big group.
As for the food , the taste and the presentation were nice. We had virgin mojito, fresh lime soda  , tandoor baked panini and pasta aglio.
The virgin mojito and fresh lime soda both were good to taste. The tandoor baked panina served with fries were finger licking good. We really liked the presentation of the dish. The fries were crispy from outside and soft from inside. The panina was also filled with filling soft and succulent.
The pasta was also good to taste.
Finally we were served with a piece of choclate each as complimentary.
Overall more than the food we really enjoyed the ambience decors and the service. It was a  great place to spend time with friends.

Actually this was suddenly planned. At first I was hesitant, but then I was proved dead wrong. The hospitality is one of a kind. Never have I seen any other restaurant constantly catering to your needs. They even let you try their seasonal specials for free ! 
How cool is that ?! The food is great and the best part about this place is that you don't need to have bulk of cash to afford it. Prices are very reasonable. Go give it a shot, if you haven't already !

I am a great foodie and has been to a number of restaurant but still,  when I came here,  I was at a loss for I couldn't figure out what to order. All the dishes were so unknown.  So, when the manager came to ask for the order, I said my budget and asked him to surprise me. And he just did that in an immaculate way. Only,  I found this restaurant to be too dear.  That's why I rate it 4.5 instead of 5

Second visit to this place and as usual I always love this place for their friendly behaviour and nevertheless good food. Although it is a vegetarian food joint but the food is really delicious. This time we ordered for a customised pizza with the toppings of our own choice and for a chocolate lawa dessert. Best part is they give you complimentary summer coolers till to wait for your order and mini chocolates with your bill. How cute is that? :D

It was Sunday afternoon. We were heading somewhere else but due to rains  we checked in here for a quickie. 
Ambience - 4/5 ( the walls and the artüòçüòç)
Food - 3.5/5 ( though we ordered only Baby corn, that was crispy and well presented and Chocolate fudge cake which I thought was kinda hard as compared to a cake)  
But I'll deduse more 0.5 points as the glass they gave me was stinking badddd. 
Service - 4/5 oh boy.. They were good.. 
Brownie points for presentation. 
P. S = A good restaurant for veggies And Surprise Surprise at the end ( when you get the bill,  do look out for the refreshments.. Aah that was class üíïüíïüëèüëè)
Thank you.

It's a vegetarian joint. Doesn't serve alcohol.
The crostini was good. Tasty.
The pizza was okaish , had other better thin crust üçï
For desserts ordered mango cheesecake.  It was chalky.....average . Any bakery 50rs worth cheesecake tastes better. The litchi mousse was equally disappointed. The only reason I put up 3 is because of the refreshing decor. And the crostini.
The wishing tree is cute.

I visited here with one of my friends then we had just just ordered a dessert..

It is on the opposite foot of The Park .
The staff Members are good.. A girl took all of our orders and she had really a good behavior with a constant smile on her face ! The manager ia also nice :)
This place has a wish tree where one can stick notes on it with her/his wishes !
The dessert was of a different concept and we liked it !
The next time me and 7-8 of my friends came here on a friend's birthday.. We ordered many a items.. The presentation of the food is just outstanding but the quantity is not much !
The best here are the desserts !!

I liked the place though its a bit expensive.. But the desserts are really good ! For the presentation, I would like to give 5+ on a mark of 5 !

"Hakuna matata" is a Swahili phrase; roughly translated, it means "no worries". It is formed by the words hakuna and matata.
It is a very popular 73 seater vegetarian restaurant cum bar serving global fusion delicacies located at Park Street, Kolkata. Besides veg people, non veg people would also enjoy Hakuna Matata's food ride without doubt.

Ambience - Mesmerising ambience with mellow lighting, cosy seating arrangements , beautiful wall hangings and their signature " Matata Wishing Tree " where visitors write down their wishes expecting them to come true is truly a visitor's delight.

Staffs & Service - Staffs were very friendly and service was prompt.

We Panchphoron team went on a food tasting event on the eve of Valentine day menu launch where the theme was - " This Valentine's Koko goes to Italy ".

We were served the following -

1) Injected Basilico Mozzarelline Fritte ‚Äì caprese salad spread with basil ¬†jaggery puree.

2)Risi e Bisi Bruschetta ‚Äì drop of olive,tapenade aioli & parmesan crisp.

3)Drunken Spaghetti with Ragu ‚Äì spread with alla puttanesca puree & soya mushroom ragu was ruby in color, cooked in red wine, well cooked and amazing.

4)Love and Cozy Blanket ‚Äì pea and spinach mash in parmesan lasagna on the bed of honey mustard watermelo was soft and yummy. It had a greenish hue and very well presented.

5)Honey-Sweetened Mascarpone Mousse ‚Äì served with berries and pistachios was heavenly and nicely presented.

6)Chocolate & Strawberry Samosa ‚Äì Basil and Strawberry puree,scoop of ice cream was crispy and enjoyable. A must try ....!!

Pocket pinch is reasonable along with good quantity.

Don't waste time, come here with your friends & family on any special occasion or on any normal day to relish their yummy food ride.

Thanks to the management for their warm reception and amazing hospitality.

Went here with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and the place was pretty empty. They have good decor and ambience. Food is a little expensive but that's ok given the quantity served. If you are an adventurous veg foodie then this is the place. 
We ordered queasidilla which were nice and crispy but got a little soggy towards the end. It had a lot of filing and oozey cheese. 
The arabitta pasta too was good and spicy and came in a huge bowl. 
Finally the nolen Gur cheesecake was brilliantly done although the base wasn't crumbly enough. 
A good but expensive place.

We went there almost a month ago to grab some food with beer. But unfortunately beer wasn't available as their bar license had been canceled at that time. However, we ordered some mocktails,spaghetti aglio olio and indian inspired mezze platter. All were good in taste. But the order was not properly served. I said add zucchini,sweet corn and mushroom to pasta,avoid broccoli but they added broccoli instead of zucchini.

It was never on my list of bookmarks, because it offers no non-vegetarian items, a simple dampener from my likings. But, I was interested to visit the place, as I saw a plethora of fusion food that blends well with our taste buds and also give plenty of continental flavours. Their way of serving, the style and their innovations are really recommendation-worthy. I must say, the flasks they use to serve mocktails and drinks will amuse you like never before.
As, I intended to visit the place, only; I just had one gulp of Matata Cooler, to kill time and thirst, both. Their staffs are courteous and good enough expert to handle rush. Nice place for casual eating out. Thumbs up for a whooole lot of innovative ideas and blended recip√©s.
Love, all.

Hakuna Matata was a last minute choice on a busy Saturday where it seemed to be one of the places with empty tables. Obviously empty tables on Saturday should spell out the obvious that the place must have something wrong with it. The location being park street in a weekend . However I had little spare time and decided to take the plunge. The waiter politely told me as I entered the place is all vegetarian and more importantly they don't serve alcohol . Guess that explains the poor attendance. The vegetarian fare on order was quite diverse ranging from the veg Tiffin ( very innovative presentation for a veg thali) and the usual mideastern and Italian fare. The  Caesar salad was excellent with fresh and crispy lettuce and the right amount of dressing. The falafel/ pita bread / hummus combo was quite acceptable as well. The pizza however could have had been better . The pasta ( Risotto in white sauce ) was again up to the mark however I have had better. They had a version of ice lolly which was really amazing with real fruit chunks . Overall experience was good with really good service and decent food. Would recommend it to my veggie friends who like continental food . The management did have alcoholic drinks on the menu but were having some licence problems hence could not serve it .

The ambience was okay. Pricing is fair. Though it was bad idea to order Caesar Salad. Guess its too difficult to get an authentic caesar salad in the city. Pasta saved the day. Mexican rice was decent. But I HAD THE MOST HORRIBLE GUACAMOLE HERE. And they gave long pause between courses.

Situated on the prime food street of Kolkata , Hakuna Matata offers you great vegetarian gourmet delicacies,nibbles,appetizers and coolers in a very pleasing and aesthetically designed ambience. I tried their house special quesadillas and oh boy ! they were soo good ..so is the kiwi crush and aglio olio pasta. The service and taste is incomparable. Though pricing is a little high and has nothing for the hard core non vegetarian, it sure holds it's own among the new breed of restaurants in Kolkata.

Located just beside Magnolia and opposite to The Park, this is probably one of the best vegetarian restaurants in Park Street, or anywhere in Kolkata for that matter.
The decor was rather simple lending a cafetaria-like appearance to the restaurant. It's really easy to order the food here, though. Vegetarian restaurants are generally not frequented by meat lovers, so they try to make up for it with their beautifully garnished dishes. This was no exception.
Upon being seated, you get a booklet which contains photographs of the more popular items on the menu.

We went for :
1) Matata Cooler - This mocktail failed to deliver as the promise of watermelon juice and coconut water was only partially met. We failed to find a trace of coconut and it was very watery.

2) The nibbles platter - Rather nice. A collection of all the veg starters we commonly see such as Crispy baby corn, Fried potatoes and Vegetable fries with mozzarella cheese. 

3) Mini Crostinis - The bite sized portions served in small glasses were extremely easy to eat and had a nice zing to them.

4) The Desi Saag Risotto - Probably the dish of the day for me. The bread ring served on top of the dish made it look very appealing visually. Apart from the fried okras, the fact that spinach could taste so good was something I realized only after I finished tasting this dish.

The waiters were extremely cooperative and regularly dropped by to inquire about the taste. 
I will not give a perfect 5 due to the watery mocktail, but other than that, this restaurant deserves it.

Visited this place on a scorching thursday afternoon on a friends recommendation.
And believe me guys my mood wasnt even close to what this restaurant meant( it means no worriesüòâ)i was very worried about the kind of food i would order. I was completely clueless as i am a hardcore non vegetarian with very less regard for vegetarian delicacies. But this place made me fall
"Kwa upendo na mboga chakula"( in love with vegetarian food)
This place has been decorated with care,with a lot of thought going into decorating it..the best thing about the decor is the wish tree where the customers have written their experiences on small heart shaped papers nd stuck them on the wall like the leaves of a tree and it looks just amazing.
The waiters are very well behaved and obliging
With a lot of query and apprehension i ordered for:-
1. Matata cooler- blend of watermelon juice with coconut milk. Frankly speaking it tastes like normal watermelon juice..the mocktail options are very limited and the cocktails are not being served as of now
2. Mini baked crostinis- Ahh this little wonder caught my attention. Served in shot glasses it tastes tangy in the beginning as it contains tamarind sauce and spinach paste.
Highly recommended
3. Nibbler platter comtains a variety of finger food to nibble on while u chat with ur friends..it truly means to urafiki (swahili for friendship)
4. The risotto with saag and crispy thin bread ring-  the people at the eatery insisted me to take this dish and it was quite delicious with a distinct creamy smooth spinach sauce with risotto..its quite filling.
Though for the food which is vegetarian i think its a bit overpriced but on the flip side pleasant hospitality and beautiful decor makes the visit worth every penny..
To my new urafiki with vegetarian food!!
So when i left the restaurant after the visit it really felt as timon said
"HAKUNA MATATA"

"Hakuna Matata" a Swahili Phrase we all are familiar with,right? Yeah, pretty much from the days of "The Lion King".

Anyway, "Hakuna Matata" roughly means "no worries, for the rest of your days"

So talking about the restaurant:
1. Well, It is situated in the heart of "Park Street" just seconds away from Flurys or you can say just opposite to "The Park". So very easy to locate.
2. The ambience is just beautiful. I would say perfect for a date but obviously for the people who love to explore vegetarian dishes.
3. Now coming to the most important part "Foods and Drinks"
We had: 
A.Matata Cooler: A blend of watermelon juice and coconut water.
B. Mini baked Crostini
C.Nibbles Platter
D. Desi Saag risotto with bread ring.
Well, the dishes were good and the presentation was very impressive.
They have a good collection of Continental and Mexican dishes and they normally serve both ¬† ¬† ¬†cocktails and mocktails but currently due to license renewal issue, they are just left with mocktails.
¬†And I would say the "mocktails' are pretty ordinary and the options are also quite less.
¬†PS: A nice restaurant to visit if you are a vegan.The staffs are quite friendly and the service is quite prompt. I personally felt that the dishes were sightly overpriced ¬†but that's ok because the decor and the ambience covered for it.

I am not much of a vegetarian lover. But I found some dishes quite tasty. Must try for all the veg lovers. And not much of a pocket pinch. The service is also pleasant here.

One of the best veg restaurant in the city...so many varieties of veg dishes which are served very creatively... Even the restaurant is decorated beautifully with a wish tree and hanging statues... We had ordered virgin mojito, matata cooler, nibbles platter and cheese cake... Everything tastes great, though the cheese cake would have been better. Mistakenly thay charged ur for two cheese cake but they recognize the mistake immediately and refunded the amount within that day.. Nice staff and great service... A must visit..

Friday night, deserted looks, we thought the restaurant was closed. Upon entering we got to know the Bar is not functioning (some internal issue related to license). One family walked in behind us hearing on the no booze availability... took off almost instantly.

No effect to us, we were not there to drink. Took to business and ordered soup and platter with pizza and  lasagne. The soup served in the coconut shell was good but it demanded a standing ovation.. cause the stand was too high for us sitting ducks. (Pic attached). The platter was nice but somehow the pizza instruction got lost in translation even after they took order of pizza in written from us, it tasted nice but since it was wrong toppings we decided to return it. Rest was smooth and the desert cheesecake was nice too.

Staff was courteous.

Would visit again sometime.

Yes it is veggie and it is tex-mex. Indianness redefined with mexican. So many new variety of dishes to try and die for. Simply amazing. Their portions are sufficient for 2 and they have several options to munch. Could u ever imagine even indian food to be served in so many different ways. Desserts were equally amazing. The decor is superb and the location even more convenient. Such a wonderful decor u simply stand to watch infront of u or above u. Interesting place with good service. This is the first time we tried so many dishes and ate so much more. Kudos and a highly recommended place to satisfy ur taste buds and fill up ur bellies. Full marks. Go go go !!!

I with my Friend went to it as there's a hakuna matata I used to visit in Bangalore which was my favorites, this isn't that branch after I asked the waiter. This one do serve alcohol. But we weren't sure of what to order as veg nahhh. Finally thought to keep it light and just to go for a brownie dessert. One of the finest presented dish I had recently and yes it tasted good enough. We both shared one. This review is just for the dessert.

Hakuna Matata is one of the best place in Park Street to visit. Located just opposite of Park Hotel, Hakuna Matata is a small cute looking place. I visited here recently and found their special Holi Menu launched. Here are the things you shouldn't miss out.
Among the Beverage I had their Rangeela Martini, red in color and was brilliant in taste.
Bhang Rasia Shots : You should miss this in the Holi season. This is the best way bhang can ever be presented.
And coming to the food.
Tandoori Veggie Shekh Kabaad was too good.
Rangeen Aloo Tikki Chat and Rangde Biryani are other two wonderful dishes I tried here.

Last Christmas I visited the place in the afternoon with a friend. It is located in Park steet area,  few meters from the Flurys outlet. The place looks very interesting and innovatively decorated.We took the stairs and sat on the first floor which is a mezzenine floor. While we sat on the chair we felt that the floor kept vibrating but we adjusted.We ordered a corn and a chicken dish, apology for not able to recollect the names but the food was quite tasty and extremely filling.

A great vegetarian restaurant that offers drinks on the pub street of Kolkata - Park Street. They have some great food, many of them are fusion food and are quite unique. We ordered for baby corn and masala fries, both were tasty and the dips were perfect with the food. I loved the cheese dip that came with the masala fries. ¬†Great service - I requested for some new cocktail which is not on the menu. The bartender was quick to offer a tweaked version of Cosmopolitan to suit the valentine day mood. None the less my date was impressed.

Hakuna Matata is a vegetarian restaurant located on park street. The menu offers a wide range of different dishes from around the world. The restaurant is colourfully decorated and very clean. When first i saw the interior from outside i was very tempted to try food here. One of the newest All veggie joint on Park Street. Interesting cuisine, unique menu and variety, amazing food presentation, moderately priced. This place is a must try if you are on Park street and have already tried the legacy restaurants on this street. Though all veg, but worth visiting for Non-veg people as well. Great location and amazing food. If you want variety they have amazing options for Italian food, Mexican, Indian and Thai. We were blown away by the food and the atmosphere is casual and very enjoyable. "This Valentine's KoKo goes to Italy"

There‚Äôs an enticing Valentine‚Äôs menu on offer. 

Injected Basilico Mozzarelline Fritte:-

Caprese Salad, spread of basil jiggery puree. With a crispy outside and a cheesy inside, Mozzarelline Fritte are fried mozzarella slices coated with flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. 

Risi e bisi bruschetta:- 

Drop of Olive tapenade aioli & Parmesan Crisp. Celebrate the vibrant flavours and colours of Valentine's week with this beautiful risi e bisi recipe

Drunken Spaghetti with Ragu:- 

Spread with Alla Puttanesca Puree & Soya Mushroom Ragu. Spaghetti Ubriachi, or Drunken Spaghetti, is a typical Tuscan dish cooked in the red wine takes on a gorgeous ruby red color.Do not worry about getting tipsy while eating this as the alcohol burns off with the heat leaving just a lovely hint of sweetness to the pasta.

Love and cozy blanket:-

Pea and Spinach Mashed in Parmesan lasagna on the bed of honey mustard watermelon. This dish uses a pea pur√©e instead of traditional b√©chamel as the base sauce. The result is a lighter lasagna with a vibrant green hue. And surpirisngly it is presented in such a way like a couple is sleeping on bed. 

Honey-sweetened mascarpone mousse with Berries & Pistachios:-

The deliciously rich mascarpone cheese. Aquick low carb dessert. 

Chocolate and strawberry samosa :-

Basil & strawberry Puree, scoop of ice cream. A unique twist to everyone's favorite snack item. It has chocolate, it has strawberry and it has the same crispy, yumminess of Samosa, what else is needed!

If you‚Äôre looking for a romantic and animal-friendly meal to celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day, it‚Äôs easier than ever to find a delicious spot nearby Park Street! Take a ride to Italy along with Koko and Love !!

Thanks

Nice place for veg lovers in park street. Great ambience, beautiful decor and courteous staff. We took the nimble platter, ginger blast mocktail and Smirnoff vodka: 1 free on ordering 2 small shots. The platter had a croissant, wrap, corn wings and fries- all of them were delicious. The dishes were served in really quirky containers and we had overall a nice experience.
Revisited today& tried the toastiza, red sauce pasta and nolen gurer cheesecake. Spicy twist & matata cooler was good too. Keep up the great job!

I visited this place on a weekday with my friends. This is a vegetarian restaurant. Coming to the food we ordered veg pizza, Hakuna Quesadillas , Kiwi frappe and Choco lava. The pizza had thin crist and it tasted good. The Quesadilla had a touch of Indian flavour and they added some Indian chatni to it which apparently i liked it. Somehow the kiwi frappe dissapointed us. The chocolava was well decorated and served in a quite presentable way. It was served with the cake and an icecream scoup. Service was good too. The place is cheap and pocket friendly.

Look and Feel - One of the beautiful restaurant/cafe in the locality. From outside only, it looks very inviting. The giant tree like design on the wall, and roof hangings, really beautiful. Background music, love sports, enough sitting space. Neither too crowded nor too vacant. 4/5
The best part for me was, it's all vegetarian.

Staff and Service - amazing people, courteous and friendly. I have seen some places, who entertain Indian crowd differently, when they have good number of foreign visitors, but this wasn't the case here. 4/5

Menu and Food - Menu all twisted. Every cuisine comes with a twist. It was neither too long nor too short. 4/5
Virgin Mojito - All good, Herby lemony bit sweet and flavorful. 4/5
Nachos - although they say it Mexican, but it tasted more like bhel to me, sour cream, beans and guacamole playing the role of curd, tamarind chutney and green chutney respectively. I felt nachos used was Cornitos or something like that. Cheese sauce was nowhere to be found. 3/5
Burger - comes with masaledaar potato wedges, crispy onion rings and onion barbecue sauce. All these 3 components were perfect. But Burger was bit dry, babycorn patty was something new, but tasty. Salads all good, cheese perfectly set with patty but sauce or mayo was missing, making it bit troublesome to eat. 4/5

Overall, great experience.

The place is strictly for Vegans !!¬†

Been there yesterday, The place is cool in one word. The interiors were pretty cool too. Nice cozy ambiance inside with good crowd. We went there for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.The upper deck was filled up with kids shouting and screaming, guess there was a birthday celebration upstairs. As soon as you enter if you look right there is a wall painting of a tree and the leaves are created out of wishes from all the people who visits the place. So if you have a wish , write it and paste it in the wall. It looks very pretty. Coming to the food and drinks. The beer and breezer were served chilled. The sweet lime soda had less sweet in it however. We ordered for Mexican Rice but they said that it isn't available. Was very disappointed. The food orders were limited. We ordered a pizza. The pizza was decent in proportion. The drinks were served very nicely. Overall 3.5 for the ambiance.

Visited this place on 28th December last year with my friend, this restaurant can be said to be for pure  vegetarians delight. Ambience is good .
 
First of all we ordered Kokotini - Chocolate based cocktail which was ok. 

This was followed by Home Made Masala Fries along with cheese spread and sweet chili curd - The presentation in tea kettle was awesome and taste was delicious. 

Next was Litti Chokha Shots - Eating this item was delight. Taste was beyond words. Completely unexpected. Must try for everybody.

Then we ordered Pesto Season Grill Vegan Lasange - The worst of all that we had. We couldn't talk other bite of it as it was not a proper Lasange . Moreover, it was filled with capsicum and all green veggies. 

Finally came the dessert time and we had Choco Blast Fusion - Never before seen concept. Totally new. Just like painting is done on canvas, similarly dessert was presented to us in same way with huge chocolate ball filled with vanilla cream with other toppings such as strawberry, Supari, sauces.etc. A complete masterpiece in itself

Overall , the experience of dining at this restaurant was quite good.

The place is just opposite Park Hotel . This is a vegetarian food restaurant and one of the very few good ones available near this place.¬†
Sitting arrangements are comfortable enough. All sefie people will love the beautiful ‚ÄòWish Tree‚Äô and innovative ‚ÄòHanging Statues‚Äô.
One can feel the taste of ingredients and it's a fine experience to relax and enjoy food.

I visited there with my friends last sunday.Although being a weekend,it was comparatively empty.The ambience was really nice.The staff was also polite.What I really liked about this place was the wish tree kind of thing and one side of the wall made of glass..Now,leaving about the decorations and architecture,lets come to the food part.We ordered Tibetan Thukpa in starters which came in a nice coconut shell and it was really tasty.Then we went on to order Pesto Season Grill Veggie Lasagne which was also upto the mark in taste.It was also a treat to my eyes and taste buds.
Then we ordered an item named rice paper wraps which was stuffed with noodles and sauteed veggies.It was tasteless.I would recommend that no one should order this.Also considering the prices quantity is very less compared to other restaurants in the same area.Moreover,we were looking for a filling lunch menu,but we didn't find any such item in the menu.

Truly speaking as it is a veg restaurant  and me being strictly a nonveg person,I went there basically with minimum expectations ,just for tasting some goodlooking  food.But i was completely proven wrong.The food was not only pretty looking they were amazingly delicious as well.The staffs were really attentive and polite.We had matata cooler,pesto veg lasagne and a dessert named koko something.all were superb and recommended..mata cooler was so refreshing.but what happened at last just simply ruined our happy mood.Transaction was not taking place by the card we gave them( it was an ubi rupay card). They swiped the card 3 -4 times in two card machines but it was all in vain..moreover we were not carrying enough cash with us so we completely freaked out thinking that the fault must be in our card.but after wasting almost 1 and a 1/2 hrs and going through a phase of extreme stress they tried it again and it worked.We gave a sigh of relief and left the place on a sad note but relieved!Anyways,once again kudos to their amazing plating ideas!!
P.s.on our bill they charged us both service charge and service tax apart from normal vat.but when i mentioned its no longer necessary to pay service charge they gave us a discount also of 4 p.c.

I wish i could rate it below 1. Horrible place, a complete waste of money, time and energy. I would rather suggest some roadside jhalmuri compared to the shit i was served for almost 600 bucks. The place has deteriorated to a GREAT extent. Mix the horrid prices, the terrible presentation and a superbly pathetic environment and you will find yourself with this shithole, an absolute sorry excuse for a 'hangout zone'. I would rather perch my MATATA ELSEWHERE!

Good food and a good drink makes your day amazing.

Ambience is good, light and simple

Service is also good. 

Little more work can be done on food. 

Nice place to hang out with family, friends or simply with your date.

But overall great experience.

We went in because of the interesting name. However the food or the restaurant is not. 
1. While looking through the menu we understand only veg food is available so core non veg people should not try it.
2. Only pint beer is served. *no comments*
3. The amount of French fries is too little compare to what the price is. The price is too high.
4. I am not sure but when you may have to experience water droplets dripping from the ac vent upon your shoulder.
5. Finally and most importantly they must consider the food quality. Because it is a restaurant and people go to eat there not just for a pint beer.

But it is new establishment, so if they consider the customer feedback they have scope to improve. Looking forward to that.

Do not judge a book by its cover. The decor, the presentation and the ambiance is bang on. However, the food is not to the mark. 

I visited the place on a weekend lunch. Located in a niche Park Street location,I expected it to be full. Though, there is adequate seating facility and quite spacious on the whole.When the food arrived, my eyes lit up but my taste buds couldn't agree with my cornea cells. Thus, as a whole, if you go there it's better to click duck face selfies and food pictures for instagram would be a better option. 

Order Highlights:

Mezze Platter: Hummus not that great, Rest was fine.

Crushed Fresh tomato basil Pasta: Penne. Overly sweet, and too much basil. 

Rating: 

Food: 2.5

Service: 3

Decor: 3.5

Went there on Christmas. After 15 minutes of waiting, we were let inside. And man it is one hell of a restaurant. We didn't knew it was a Veg restaurant so we had less expectations of it. But we were pleasantly surprised by the menu. They had some great fusion dishes. Ordered Pita paan pakoda, aglio olio peperoncino, Manchurian vada pao and many other dishes. All are recommended. Truly a good restaurant.

Visited this place on 25th December for lunch and ordered  tomato and sweet corn soup and that was awesome. Then came the tandoor baked panini which was good and different. The Texas baby corn wings were okay type. I feel they need to widen the menu and the names of the items should be less complicated. Otherwise the experience was good. Not to forget, the staff were friendly.

Service was quick with friendly staff. 
Loved the food was presented. 
Didn't like the food, it's all show no go for me. Pizza toppings and base sauce was not fresh. Mushrooms were over baked. 
Good for food pics, bad for taste pellet! 
Prices were doable.

Came here by chance...Ambience was OK like most other restaurants nowadays.... Food options are quite less as being a foodie myself I always look for some meal based items which happened to lack although they have an Out of the Box menu in place....Honestly not a viable option for people who are looking to try out good cuisines as you have to get away with Snack Items...Stict No No for real foodies....Too expensive by the standards as well.

Hakuna Matata is a small restaurant/caf√© on Park Street. The interiors are nice and friendly. Loved the food here. Tried the:
1) Polenta stuffed mushrooms- This starter was great. Did full justice to the mushroom.
2) Leek and mozeralla croquette- mozeralla cheese oozing out with fresh salad, what's there not to love in this starter.
3) Saag Risotto- excellent dish. The Risotto was light and tasty. The fried okras, unfortunately did, not add much to the dish.
4) Eggplant and broccoli parmigiana- The dish was good and tasty. Didn't like the bread served with it, it was very and a bit hard.
5) Thai Green Curry- It was excellent. The fragrance and the taste of that curry makes it a must try.
Overall, a very good dining experience. Out of the box dishes are it's USP. Can't wait to try other dishes here.

Pathetic is the word..total waste of money nd our evening as well. We ordered crostini,pizza ,kiwi frappe strawberry shake and Mexican fried rice, except the pizza nothing was eatable.
The manager came and started explaining us that how the food is prepared and how its value for money whatever they are serving. common man we go to so many places and we don't need your so called advice.
Never going to that place again. Neither will suggest anybody to try out.

Normally when I enter a restaurant, I notice the interiors and the ambience first. But when I entered this place, I don't know why I just didn't notice anything at all here in the first go. Although their interiors are kind of creative. Didn't really catch my attention too much.

One wall has a huge tree painted on it with A LOT of Post-its (Sticky Notes) filled by customers (it seems) as leaves ! There were a lot ! Almost stared at it for a good amount of time wondering as to how would they have reached the heights of the tree and the corners of the wall to stick those post-its. Was also wondering whether actual customers have written them cause there were quite a lot of them ! It was good but ! Looked really pretty !

Then looking up, there were stunning sculptures of men hanging from the ceiling. They looked more like men trekking in caves. I didn't understand why though.

We sat in the bottom section out of the two.Had ordered for-Constructed Gourmet Nachos Chips
Pesto Cream with Potato and Beans
A Veg Burger
Mexican Fried Rice
Cold Coffee

The Nachos, Pesto Pasta and the MExican Fried Rice were upto the standard.

The Veg Burger was not up to the mark. The cutlet inside felt stale and super oily. The wedges along with the burger was wrapped in Gram Flour (Besan) and fried ! They tasted like salt-less Pakoras. Why Pakora's ? Why not fries or proper wedges ?

The Cold Coffee was extremely diluted. Very watery. ¬†Ruined the mood.

The service was good though.

Overall experience was average. Would rate it a 3.5
Word of Advice - I found the lights too bright out here. Would have been better if it was a little dimer than the usual. This place has two sections. ¬†Kindly work on the Cold Coffee.

I dont see any point buying veg food at this price,which is only panner amd etc . But then a colleague of mine brought food for us frm here. The noodles were decent. And everything else was waste of money.

We won't to this place on a Saturday evening.. The place was not crowded and we got a table immediately.. 

We then moved forward and ordered Pita Nan Pakoda and Pizza Potato Fries for starters.. Pita Nan Pakoda was really very tasty and the best dish which we had for the day.. It was chana Pakoda and veggies served on a small pita naan bread with a tinge of green chutney on top of it.. Pizza potato fries were okayish with slices of potato which were fried and then veggies along with cheese on top was served.. 

Coming towards main course, we ordered Mexican Rice which was good in taste and Mixed sauce penne pasta which was not properly boiled.. Had it been boiled well, it would have tasted really good.. 

In mocktails, we ordered Orange Mojito and a Guava juice based mocktail both of which were really tasty.. 

The overall ambience of the place was good and I especially liked the wall on which comments were stuck from customers in sticky notes.. A nice decor concept it was indeed.. The staff was also well behaved and did cater well to our requests.. 

We were 3 adults and 3 kids, and the billed amount was ‚Çπ1720..

This place is a must visit for all!

Dropped in on a Sunday night for a family dinner. Funky ambience (the ground floor is more lively, first floor offers more privacy), cool music and Vegetarian food r what defines Hakuna Matata. Located opposite the park hotel, this place is hard to miss.
We started off with cold coffee with ice cream which was pretty average. Then we had the spicy sweet corn tomato soup - it was warm, it was spicy and perfect starter for a somewhat cold winter night. We loved it. Next came in the Pizza. Which is square unlike other places and they let u choose 4 toppings and the base sauce and crust of ur liking. The pizza was great too. We ended out meal with the pasta in white sauce. Which was quite nice as well.
The playlist was really cool. The staff r helpful and pleasant. Food is served quickly and the portion sizes r pretty decent too. Easy on the pocket ( however that maybe because it's a veg place ) They impose service charge @ 5/6%. Lastly the menu is really limited. However wouldnt mind visiting again. :)
Overall recommended! :)

The food and drinks at Hakuna are quite upto the mark! Though the menu might seem confusing for once and mighty spoil you for choices, the moment you start trying out stuff you realise it's all so good! In particular I really liked the cream of mushroom soup, the Pan Fried Polenta cake and the Koko lava cake (which is as good as the mudpie you get at Hub, Taj Bengal!).

On my way to work this place is good enough to chill with your friends on the go. The menu had a lot of options to try. Well we ordered just double bubble and cranberry with vodka for drinks. It was fair enuf! The platter of fried nibbles was to my delight quite good. The chocolate falafel was new and fresh to my taste buds. Overall with the ambiance and the conduct of the people in service was good. When matched with price it is a bit on the higher side maybe. But good enough for drinks n nibbles.

Firstly veg! Dang, not my place! I still gave it a try.
The food here is very much deceiving, what appears on the menu is definitely not what is being served. The crispy baby corn was nice enough, but the Polenta stuffed baked mushroom was nothing but 5 dumplings on a platter. 
I like the idea of making pizza your own way with the choice of toppings and crust. 
Booze is cheap, but no happy hours. :(
Rest apart, service wise and ambience wise its good enough. 
And definitely a nice place, bit die hard non veg people, please avoid.

This place is located in the heart of park street, just beside Magnolia restaurant, so very easy to find. The ambience was nice. But the place is vegetarian and the food is also not upto the mark. We took crispy babycorn which tasted good though and quantity was also okay. Next we took polenta stuffed baked mushroom.That was really a big dissapointment. Only 5 small pieces of mushroom decorated nicely on a big plate.Only the cheese dip tasted dip. Next we took pizza which was okay, the best thing about that was the thin crust. 
Bit high price also with lotta taxes. 
Dont think will drop again  .

This was one of the highest rated restaurants which was present in Park Street so I and my friend decided to give this¬†place a visit. We ordered couple of dishes here.
You get a free cold drink with every food item that you order and also the option of going for a bulb cocktail by adding 99 rupees to any food item that you order. The bulb cocktail is essentially a 30 ml vodka cocktail with a choice of 3 ¬†mixers sprite plus any of the other Monin syrups - lime, lagoon blue and crimson red or something. This is served in a ¬†bulb shaped glass and hence the name.¬†
We ordered a coke and also a vodka plus lime bulb cocktail for ourselves. We ordered two food items - Aglio Olio Peproncino & eggplant and brocoli parmigiana. The first one was recommended in spaghetti which we had.¬†
I especially liked the eggplant item which was super tasty. We had to order extra assorted veggies in the spaghetti to make¬†it a bit better than only a flour based spaghetti, being charged extra for veggies was a bit of a dampener. If it was chicken or seafood then paying would have added a lot more sense.¬†
Finally we were served a bill of 1200 bucks which was a bit expensive. One incident showing part about the service and their cordiality was that we had
 been charged extra for the soft drink and on pointing that out to the main manager - he was highly apologetic and polite  and got that immediately rectified. So great point won on service there, and in general the waiters were highly polite in taking the ¬†order as well as helping us with suggestions.¬†

Overall a good place just a bit on the expensive side. Food and ambience both were decent.

A cozy place to catch up with buds. It has a warm and welcoming ambience. 

Seating arrangements - Tad uncomfortable because the cushion  kept dislocating from the chair.
Food - 
1. Crispy babycorn - Soft, crispy, yummy and filling. 
2. Pizza (potatoes) - Soft, succulent , yummy and absolutely unique. 
Staff - Courteous 

Everything about this place is good but i feel it is a bit overpriced..

I never order veg food at restaurants as I am a strict non vegetarian. ¬†But during the pujas when you have no other options at midnight you turn desperate and do the unthinkable. But what came out of it was rather pleasant. We kept our order rather simple- beers and the pesto lasagna. The beers were chilled as is expected. The lasagna took some time to arrive (the reason they gave was that since it was a baked product it would take a while to prepare- uhh okay. Whatever!) But the wait was worth it. It tasted really good, was cheesy yet had the textures where you could make out all of its components. It went as far as proving me wrong that I wouldn't like it on account of it being vegetarian. Also their single portions are ¬†good enough for two people which they do specify on their menu- super like! The atmosphere was good enough. The decor was really nice and the music put us at ease. the waiters were really nice in helping us out as we were a large bunch. ¬†All in all, would return to this place for the ambiance and drinks if not the delicious vegetarian food.

I have my reasons for not liking this place! Even I'm an hardcore non vegetarian but still I appreciate good veg food and the quality! Here you'll find the quality sure but not different options! We had difficulties choosing cause everything we order have either bhindi or Brinjal in it! And I simply didn't understood why!
Why would I pay 450/- to eat a platter of Mochar chop/alur chop/ and all the chops? We are in Kolkata!! 
Cheesecake that we had was not exactly like a proper cheesecake, when asked they said it's baked! I had baked cheesecake before as well sir and it's definitely don't tastes like what you people had served yesterday!
My point is to provide better options, different options and a better service! There is only two guys to serve the entire second floor! Sony and the other guy! Not sufficient!
Improvement needed!

a good concept all together... but i disliked all the nonsense music they played. 3 corona came for rs 899 which was the major attraction. since its a veg restaurant and we mostly prefer nonveg we did not care for a meal as such. 2 buckets of corona we ordered (6 bottles) plus another one and they barely gave us anything complementary. only a cup of peanuts without any salt was what was given. free wifi is there which is a pros of the restaurant.

This is the first that i am writing  such a review for a place... Located in a prime  area of the city, park street. Hakuna matata .We ordered a pan seared veggies with some creamy cheese glazing on waiter's suggestion as he said, it would be filling(stomach filling).. But the waiter thought that we were asking for a dish which had a filling in it üôÑüò∂. What came looked like a single roll cut into 5 small bites and tasted like brinjal bharta in a roti.. It tasted so aweful that we couldn't finish those 5 small pieces of a roll which apparently was"Filling".

You are in Park Street! Yay! You serve alcohol! Yay Yay! You have a very well done interiors! Yay Yay Yay! You are veg! Not so Yay! Same was the reaction when my friends actually realised that this hip looking resto in the heart of Park Street, Kolkata is actually "pure veg". And the experience we had, spoke for itself. The food is awesome. The drinks are moderately priced. And the ambience is something which is very fresh.

A big thumbs up to the management! Cheers!

Ambience : 5/5
Food : 4/5
Service : 4.5/5

P.S Only thing which can be sorted is please do not charge people for asking mayonnaise in a small pot instead of it being smeared on the dish..because its not extra we are asking for, its just its easy to share among 6ppl from the pot.

Visited this place on ashtami after reading a lot of rave reviews to be heart( satisfaction ) broken.
There were 4 of us. First of all the top section was closed of, secondly a lot of items were not available, we considered it being durga puja.
The two salads we ordered we literally very bland lacking basic seasoning even, and the goat cheese mouse mentioned hardly existed. Next the non fried nibbles platter looked extremely pretty but the tasty items on the plate were the baked roots and the tomato sauce below the potato jacket, the noodles although picture perfect had a weird sweet sauce. The rice wraps also bordered on the bland side.Polenta cakes were too spicy on the other hand.
The iced tea was standard.
Full marks for plating and presentation and yes the decor is innovative and photograph savvy.
A lot of taxes on the prices are levied so its definitely a pocket pinch for an almost empyty tummy.
All over not a fan and sorely disappointed.

Yet another visit to this awesome place which we call " No Worries" food station at Park street.¬†
This time went there for their Durga Puja Sepcial Menu. It was again a warm welcome from the smiling owners itself and here it comes the puja menu on the table.

--DRINKS--

Paan thandai - Pan flavored drink comes onto the table. The drink gave a clear feeling of eating a Paan.

Aam Panna Vodka - ¬†Another drink that came and it was one of my favorite drinks. Aam Panna but ¬†this was the cocktails based aam panna with vodka.

--STARTERS--

Avocado Pani Puri - I love to eat pani puri occasionally and this was the avocado flavored pani puri in the mexican touch.

Jeera alu posto bhaji chaat- Had lot of chaats earlier but this was a different one. The chat was of ¬†jeera aloo, corn, peas ¬†which was served in kachori looking bowl. Tasted Decentwith ¬†garnishing of coriander leaves and grated cheese.

--MAIN COURSE--

Karaishutir paratha with chholar daal - This was one of my liked one on the table as i liked the cholar dal the most. ¬†Green peas stuffed parathas with some decent presentation.

Aloo Chanar Dalna - Bengali platter at its best for the puja when some authentic bengali dishes comes in one plate. Jeera Rice, cauliflower Sabji, sukto and potato sabji. I liked the rice with the sukto. it was splendid.

Bengali polao with aloor dom - ¬†This was another platter of authentic Bengali food. Again presentation was spot on. ¬†Alu bhaja kept throned on the ¬†rice and alu dum is all time favorite.
--DESSERT--
Kiki's Payes - ¬†The fantastic puja menu ended with the all time hit Payes with the love of Kiki. It was fusion based dessert with caramel based rosogolla.

All you need to do this puja is to visit Hakuna Matata and try their Authentic Bengali cuisine. Happy Puja

Been there on Saptami'16 night with 4 frinds. We ordered 4 pitchers of beer (kingfisher). Each pitcher contains 3 pint. Cost of one pitcher was Rs299 which makes the bill as Rs 1196. When they gave us the bill we saw besides Service Charge (5%) and Service Tax (6%) they are charging us 27% on something as "Wbst". When we asked what is that we were told that it is West Bengal Sales Tax and it is given as excise to the govt. When we provided a bill of same day from another liquor establishment they said others include that within the price and excise must be paid. They also provided us with a information booklet they had with them about the charges (see pic) and it clearly said they can charge 27% on MRP of foreign liquors; nowhere it said the charges were applicable for Kingfisher or any Indian made liquors. We asked them about that and suddenly their temperment changed and they started avoiding us. I am filing RTI about whether the charges taken were valid.

Durga Puja is surely the occasion that brings in a muddled emotion among Bengalis living all across the globe, it‚Äôs mostly happiness and excitement that prevails but for someone living away from home it‚Äôs often more of a depressing time. It‚Äôs an occasion for which people living abroad come back home, people cancel all their appointments to spend some quality time with their family and friends for pandal hopping and for eating out. It is a larger than life festival that is really hard to believe if not experienced by one. This occasion spins out abundance of excuses to spend nights on streets of the city with your friends hopping pandals, and to break your mundane routine, or to over-eat with your foodie friends or loved ones. So, this is surely one occasion when we visit loads of eateries across the city to satiate our craving for something delicious. Also on the other hand, this is the time when we visit our very well known eating joints and expect them to serve something which is very different and out of their standard menu. And here comes the importance of Puja Special Menu at our favorite restaurants. Hakuna Matata at Park Street is surely one such place which is very close to our hearts, but still they have amused us yet again with their awesome Durga Puja menu this time, which is very well curated, very well presented and yes of course, tastes insanely good!

## DURGA PUJO SPECIAL MENU LAUNCH ##

Hakuna Matata ‚Äì A Swahili phrase which means, ‚ÄúNo worries for the rest of your days.‚Äù

Hakuna Matata is a separate world in itself, accommodating global cuisines under a single roof amidst a flow of culture and tradition. This is not your average restaurant, the visit at which would only be limited to the food. At Hakuna Matata, they work to provide you more than just food. It endeavours to provide an experience jam-packed with activities and adventure.
Enjoy your meal as you gossip away or be delighted by some relishing songs during the karaoke stint. The entire concept of the restaurant revolves around how their mascot, KOKO, travels round the world picking up scores of gastronomic cultures on the way. This very knowledge is what leads to the impeccable fusion dishes made at this place. It might sound a bit rhetorical but it‚Äôs true to every word.

This festive season, Koko comes back to Kolkata, bringing with him a score of fusion recipes which applied to the traditional Bengali dishes. Let‚Äôs take a look at what Hakuna Matata has to offer during this year‚Äôs puja.

I have been here before and quality of service is still top notch. This special menu is a delightful combination of typical Bengali food with a certain twist. The presentation of each item was exemplary as it has always been at Hakuna Matata.

So folks that was about it from Hakuna Matata.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Koko Goes to Bengal ‚Äì Where Food & Celebrations mingle..!

Help Koko win his love back, as he ventures into yet another exciting journey into the lands of Bengal. At a place, where Durga Puja defines the essence of this city, food does not fall much behind. and where else to find some mouthwatering fusional combos to please the heart of an angry girlfriend, than to munch on some popular delicacies from the streets and houses of Bengal.

Hakuna Matata proudly brings you some lipsmacking and enticing dishes to celebrate this festive season. Following would be the complete list:

1) Avocado Pani Puri: Guacamole stuffed, served with sweet yoghurt, salsa and khatta pani.

2) Jeera Aloo and Posto Bhaja Chaat: Tossed with milk corn, imli and green chutney

Nice ambience with fun decor. The vibe of this place is relaxed and fun. We ordered for Rice Paper Wraps, and Mocha Mousse along with Corona beers. The beers were well priced and the food was palatable. But this place has more potential. They need to improve their food quality and portions. The rice paper wraps were kind of flavourless. But the Mocha Mousse was good. The staff were helpful but the prices are on the steeper side.

Hakuna Matata..quite unexpected named restaurant.. but at the end of the day we find it just awsome.. ofcourse it is veg restaurant..but who says veg is only "gas fus"... 
Lets come to main point
I and my friend went there yesterday for beer bucket nd some starter but as it was dry day(bad luck) we only try their starter "crispy baby conrn wings"
It was really awsome, nicely decorated.. 
Ambiance is really good, staffs are also.. 
Not only vegiterian but also non-vegiterian(like me) should come here.. they will surely fell in love with this restaurant.. presentation is fabulous from hair to toe..

This is a restaurant with a lot of potential which is not restricted by the vegiterian food on offer. The d√©cor is more caf√© ish and needs improvement. The wall of wishes is excellent. Coming to the food. Excellent in every which way . Just the presentation itself is worth the money. The BBQ sauce on the crispy baby corn.heaven. we were demanding guests today and required onion and garlic free food but not Jain food since we could have potatoes. and the manager helped us the bestest cream of mushroom soup. The mustard potatoes served with the baby corn is to die for. There is room for improvement in the service. The servers forgot to serve us a course inspite of us repeatedly asking . Then when it finally came out we had already paid and half of the party had left. The servers were really apologetic and gave us a divine payesh on the house. We were in a hurry and couldnt do it justice. Servers are very polite it's s shame but This is a place I would like to rate a 4.5 but just deducting the .5 for the service hiccups today. Will be coming back again for the ravioli.

Updated Review - 2nd visit to this place and the experience this time was so much better. Hence had to change the rating!

Hakuna Matata has launched a Summer special Dessert menu which will leave you in awe.

These desserts are not the regular, usual ones that you get at other places. Priced extremely reasonably, these desserts will make you happy for sure.

Try the Ice pops (Blueberry & Virgin Mojito), Watermelon & Lychee Granita, Mango & Lychee Mousse, Double Chocolate Fudge cake, Mango Cheese Cake and Hakuna's Dessert Pizza.

Kudos to the Dessert Chef!

Old Review -

Wikipedia says Hakuna matata is a Swahili phrase; roughly translated, it means no worries. I was really worried though...had no idea what to order in a vegetarian restaurant.

Hakuna Matata is quite easy to locate. Opposite to the Kwality restaurant at Park Street. Reached there at around 6:30 pm on a Friday and the place was almost empty. We chose to sit upstairs. The 1st thing that will draw your attention is the wish tree on the wall by the stairs. Loved the concept!¬†

We ordered a Matata Mojito, Ultra Bloody Mary and Orange Mojito. The 1st one came with a smoking kettle & we were quite impressed! Both the cocktails & the mocktail tasted really good.

Also we ordered Baileys Irish Cream which was unavailable & we were little disappointed.¬†

Coming to the food part. We ordered Pan Seared Chickpea Cake & Crispy Baby Corn wings.¬†

The Chickpea Cake was a total let down. I would advise everybody not to order this. It was dry and tasted absolutely bland. We ended up having 1 piece each and ¬†leaving the rest of the pieces untouched.

The 2nd dish was average. I've had much better Crispy baby corn wings at other places.

However, The portion sizes of both the starters were good and the presentation was excellent!

For main course, we ordered a Mexican Fried Rice. We loved this item...specially with the sour cream that they had served as accompaniment. The presentation was great. However, portion size could have been better.¬†

For dessert, we ordered a Koko Lava Fondant. Again, the presentation was nice but it tasted totally average.¬†

Service was great. Price : Okay.

Hakuna Matata has been much in the talk of the town for the last few months. They are recreating veg food in their own ways and each of them are becoming an absolute hit. I would like to thank Shahbaaz Zaman ¬† for inviting me here. It was a pre pujo lunch along with a few friends.¬†
Let's talk about the ambience first. It's yellow, it's funky, it's quirky. I loved the wish tree by the side of the staircase. The installations, the mascot of Hakuna Matata, Koko giving different poses on the wall is absolutely a treat to your eyes. I loved the vibe, which I think the young generation can relate very well with it.¬†
Next comes the food. As we were huge in numbers, the spread was vast. There were -
Avocado Pani Puri - Guacamole stuffed inside the panipuris served with sweet yoghurt, imly water and mex salsa. A mexican twist to the Bangali¬†Phuchkas. It was absolutely a surprise!
Jeera Aloo and Posto Bhaji Chaat - Served on a raj kachori and aloo chaat, this dish was really great. The imly chutney added a twist to the taste along with American corn and green peas.
Bengali Bhaja Platter - This was a huge platter that contained so many things. Mochar¬†Chop, Shingara, Achari Lonka, Narkel¬†Posto Bhaja were the items, each two in number. If you're truly a bhajabhuji loving Bengali, you gotta try this.¬†
Karaishutir Paratha with Chholar¬†Daal - I have always had Karaishutir Kochuri at home. This paratha thing was new for me. The chholar daal¬†was served with oodles of ghee and the smell was divine. They also gave some achar along with this. Must say that this was a good shot by team Hakuna.
Aloo Chhanar¬†Dalna - This dish was good as everyone said but I didn't have it. This platter had Jeera rice with Shukto and Badhakopir Ghonto.¬†
Bengali Pulao - The yellow pulao was sheer¬†bliss. I had most of it with the aloor dum which could have been cooked a bit well. There was Potoler¬†Dolma in this platter also but I didn't try that.¬†
Kiki's Payes - Payes is rice pudding. But this have a twist which is topped with Caramel Baked Rossogolla. Ah! How much I loved this dessert. Wish I could have one more spoon of it.¬†
Drinks -
Paan Thandai - I am not a paan lover, so this drink didn't suit my tastebud as it has the original flavour of paan. But my paan loving friends adored it absolutely.
They also had Vodka Aam Panna which they said were excellent. I, being a teetotaler didn't try this.
Hakuna Matata has completed one year last month. So, their mascot Koko will be travelling to different parts of the world each month this time. Since October is Durga Puja in Bengal, where else but here would Koko come? This special Bengali menu will be available there during the five days of Puja along with their regular menu. I found it really great and would recommend you to go and try this out. Loved the overall experience, how they are innovating ideas to create more dimensions in the food scenario of Kolkata. Best wishes to the team. Happy Dining! :)

Situated bang opposite to The park this is a new veg restaurant with a nicely laid decor sprawled over ground n mazonite floor . The food they offer is varied but the options on drinks are rather less. we ordered crispy chilly baby corn , chickpea cakes, Mexican rice, chocolate lava cake and a few cocktails to go with it. Portions are small, food is good and tasty except for the chickpea cakes which were hard and chewy and not to mention tasteless... rest was good ..pocket pinch a bit on the higher side wrt the portions served..

This is a different restaurant in looks and ambience and not like the regular ones. We ordered few drinks and a snack called Burwan Bhendi. Though it was crispy from outside but the Bhendi inside was not proper and was difficult to eat.

As there were not many choices in rice items, we ordered Mexican Fried Rice. And to our surprise it tasted really great and activated the spicy side of my tongue. I could really feel the spices in it and enjoyed the meal.

Over all a good experience here.

This place has a uniquely crafted menu, undoubtedly. The chefs have f(used) local ingredients in typically continental and Mexican dishes to create interesting new items.¬†
We tried the chocolate jalapeno pizza and the bread cheesecake. The chocolate pizza had a good taste, the sweet chocolate being complemented by the jalapenos. The crust however, was too thin, hard and crunchy. As my partner commented, it had a very nacho-like feel. The bread cheesecake was good.¬†
The decor was interesting and the service was moderately good, nothing exceptional. I would probably re-visit to try out some of the other items. They look pretty interesting.
Definitely recommend!

This place is easy to locate . I went there with my friend . We had ordered for cocktails (matata matitas and cosmopolitans) with nachos and quesadilla. Quesadilla was utter shit I asked them to make it spicy and all it had was spice and no taste (they should have rather changed it). Staff was courteous enough and service was average. Very average experience.

I liked the seating arrangement of this restaurant for once. The restaurant is not spacious, but the ambience is nice. I ordered their Rice Paper Wraps and Poletta Stuffed Mushrooms. The rice wraps were good, but it is the stuffed mushrooms that were amazing. I had an interesting mocktail called Ginger Blaster. I think the chef in this place must be great as the food is really good and there is quite a lot of variety for a vegetarian restaurant. Also, a lot of attention is given to the plating and presentation of the food.¬† Where they can improve is the service. The staff is friendly, but they also need to be professional. They are a little naive. The person who served me could not understand my order the first time and only after I spoke to another waiter did I get the correct order leading to a waste of¬† a lot of time. There were just a few tables occupied when I went and quite a few waiters (and supervisors) and yet the service was a bit slow. With so many fancy items on the menu there should be someone to recommend and explain stuff.¬† Otherwise, I enjoyed my visit.

A nice place right at the Center of Park Street food places. I generally do not visit Veg restaurants but this one has a fine fusion spread. The veg items are very well presented and are indeed tasty. One wouldn't miss the non veg. Polenta cake, mushroom preparations are very good indeed. Its a little low on portion size though. Didn't enjoy the cocktails. The only ones that was good was the Desi Swag cocktail and another beer cocktail. Must visit for all the veggies and definitely worth a visit for all the non-vev folk. The staff are extremely courteous and helpful. Even the manager was very cordial. We had a birthday party and he arranged a cake and some music too.

I was here last week, the food was good and so was the service. I had baby corn and Long Island Ice Tea. Despite being vegetarian restaurant I liked it (I am meat lover).
Only thing I would like you guys to be aware of is the extra WB tax they add which no other restaurant adds.
And this tax is 27% over the vat and service tax. So anyone of you going with a mindset that food is not very costly will be surprised and hurt.

Hello all my lovely readers! I am so excited about this post. And, I am sure you guys are going to love this. Today I will be more of a story-teller, and I will tell you a tale about Hakuna Matata, which tells the story of Koko. Hey, curious? Interesting, isn‚Äôt it?. Hakuna Matata is one of the newest additions to the name-list of restaurants of the happening Park Street, Kolkata. Featuring in global fusion food, hand-crafted blend of Euro Asian flavors, and some of the mesmerising Indian takdas into American and French cuisines, Hakuna Matata promises to deliver the best ever vegetarian food experiences to the people of Kolkata. After my visit to the Hakuna, I realised that its not merely a restaurant but a complete story in its entirety. The protagonist of the story is Koko, whose roots are based in Africa. He is the heart and soul of Hakuna Matata. His girlfriend, Kiki, whose love he had won over this Valentines‚Äô Day, is also there with him now. At present, Koko and Kiki, have headed towards their voyage to explore the culinary experiences all over the world. The first stop is South East Asia. In clear words, the management at Hakuna Matata have organised this food festival to celebrate the world cuisines and global fusion food. This September, from 7th to 13th, they are celebrating the South East Asian Food Festival with which they are bringing in the fusion cuisine styles from South East Asia in their menu.
                                          ...

Koko sets voyage to South East Asia..!

A time when global fusions are a hot favourite to the Kolkata palate, the very existence of a joint experimenting on global fusion becomes a challenge.¬† But Hakuna Matata, accepts on emerging out as the numero uno in experimental cuisine. Centered on the theme of travel and adventure, the place has a lively ambiance that brings the bohemian spirit to life.
            

The brain child of the  husband-wide duo Mr.Prabhas and Mrs. Pallavi is all set to make a mark amongst the Kolkatan palatr and promises to make vegetarian food a dead favourite. They said, ‚ÄúHakuna Matata stands for more than just food. It endeavours to provide a whole new culinary experience to people, with a pinch of adventure and a dash of fun‚Äù.

Location : located just opposite the Oxford bookstore in Park Street.

KoKo Goes To South East Asia-An Exciting Culinary Journey by Koko..!

For a city, which is defined by the likes of people having their traditional staple food as Rice and Fish, it is much of a surprise for a Vegetarian Restaurant doing amazingly well, in the heart of the City, which is again basically defined as the Centre for Continental Cuisine. Located bang at Park Street, which has been famous and popular by the likes of Peter Cat, Oly Pub, Barbeque, even thinking of opening up a pure Vegetarian Restaurant needs much of contemplation and conviction. With changing times, the city has fortunately adapted to changing tastes, and Hakuna Matata, proudly has been part of this drastic revolution. Known for its fusion affairs, the restaurant is segregated into two floors. The staircase is decorated beautifully with mountaineering ropes. Looking at the virtual ceiling, one could see adventurists climbing off the rocks, on their way to voyage.

The interesting part here is to visualize how these mountaineers are holding the tiny sized bright lights within their fingers. Hakuna Matata, proudly resembles its vision and name by a mascot, named as Koko. The cute lad has even got a girlfriend early this year, who goes by the name Kiki. wants him to impress her with some exciting and mouthwatering dishes from all across the world, And so, here goes Koko, on a culinary adventure and expedition all across the world, to bring back lipsmacking, delicious and mouthwatering dishes back to Hakuna Matata to impress Kiki, and everyone else. The first stop being South East Asia, Koko was kind enough to give us a preview of what was in store. Team #panchphoron landed up at Hakuna Matata, to have a glimpse of this gastronomical adventure, and following were the experiences we were lucky to have:

1) Asian Spiced Broth: Inspired by the popular Vietnamese Soup Ph·ªü or pho, Asian Spiced, this one is basically a spicy noodle soup, served inside the shell of a tender coconut. The only missing ingredients here would be the traditional meat, but then the broth, having its own charm, outdid itself in every possible aspects, and made us savor the soup, till the last drop in the spoon. The broth was loaded with garlic, lemon, noodles and other spices, which created an amazing contrast of sweet and sour taste. A separate serving of thin crisp noodles was served, which was to be dipped inside the soup as a supplementary serving. Not to forget here, the creaminess of the tender coconut shell acted as a further contributor. Post consuming the soup, we indulged ourselves in scooping out the malai, which was by then flavored with the sweet and sour taste of the soup. 

2) Gn Tso‚Äôs Cauliflower: Gn Tso, a sweet and spicy sauce, derives its origin from China. Prepared from the likes of Soy Sauce, , Wine, Vinegar, Sugar, Garlic, Ginger, Red Chillies and many other ingredients, this sauce was cleverly used for a Cauliflower preparation. Finely sliced cauliflower, which was coated in a thin batter, was then fried to crisp and light brown. These crisp cauliflowers were then lightly tossed within Gn Tso‚Äôs sauce, and the final outcome was fingerlicking good. The tossed products were sprinkled upon with some sesame seeds, and a small bed of deep fried crisp noodles was placed upon it. A further gentle tossing of some sweet onion, and we had absolutely no shame in  plucking the bowl out till the last remaining portion. This particular preparation somehow reminded me of the traditional Aloo-Gobi Sabji. For sure, this was the best dish for the day.

3) Chinese Katori: Talk about fusion and innovation! This dish is a perfect example! The base of this dish had a fried wanton sheet, shaped in the form of a bowl or a basket, or otherwise referred to here as a ‚ÄòKatori‚Äô. The basket comprised of noodles tossed with beetroot quenelles, thinly sliced bell peppers and baked apple wedges. The apple wedges, were further wrapped with Noori sheets, which is used to wrap ‚ÄòSushis‚Äô. The Katori was further topped with thin noodles, which was tossed in some sweet and spicy sauce. Some more sprinkling of sweet and spicy sauce, which then saw some goat cheese dollop placed upon the Katori. A combination of flavors and concepts hailing from various countries, this is one dish which you cannot miss. Sweet, spicy, crunchy and cheesy, this has everything packed into a small basket of excellence. 

4) Mushroom Sticky Rice: A complete meal in itself, this one had sticky rice wrapped within a banana leaf. The sticky rice was flavored with some saut√©ed mushroom, sliced ginger and sliced spring onions. The sticky rice came with a bowl, which was filled up with a thick soup of cabbage onion dumpling broth. The soup and the rice were accompanied with batter fried vegetable flowers. The rice alone tasted a bit bland to me, but the combination of the broth, rice and the crispy fritters were astounding. Slightly cheey, slightly pungent and soury, and then the crispiness of the batter fried fritters, the entire saga was quite appealing and pleasing. 

5) Veggie Banh X√®o: Otherwise referred to here as Vietnamese Crepes, this one had batter made out from rice and wheat flour, coconut milk and turmeric. The crepes had a generous filling of shredded cottage cheese, rough cut lemony salad, onions, almonds, tomatoes, peanuts, herbs and quite a handsome drizzle of lemon juice. The crisp crepes were topped with some finely grated cheese. A small bowl consisting of spicy tomato coulis was served as well, to counter the sourness of the filling of the crepes. Crispy, sour, spicy, crunchy, nutty; the crepes was a powerpunch preparation, enough to keep us hung up for even more of it. If not for anything else, the winning combination of the aroma of the coconut milk and Gondhoraaj Lebu, will surely bowl you for sure.

6) Green Tea & Lemon Pannacotta: Talk about a love affair, this one saw the fusion of Green Tea and Pannacotta come together to form a masterchef‚Äôs art! Infused with Gondhoraj Lemon/Kaafir Lime, the Pannacotta was finely prepared with the correct amount of sweetness. Served with a jelly of sugarcane which was topped with sour cream, the very presentation of this dish won us over. The Pannacotta was perhaps infused with green tea, and served inside a standard tea cup. The cup was placed upon a lotus leaf, which also had two generous dollops of sugarcane as described above.

7) Bubble Tea: Essentially a cold tea, this one had sweetened condensed milk loaded with colorful tapioca pearls. The consistency was close to that of a milk shake, but unless you know of the ingredients being used, this would mostly taste like the ‚ÄòDudh-Chawal‚Äô, we were used to in our childhood. The drink was served chilled, and the very remnant of the tapioca balls hitting the tastebuds was quite exciting.

8) Brewing Flower Tea: One item in the list, which took us everyone by surprise. A flowering tea ball, was first placed into a mug of hot water. Within a couple of seconds, the ball unraveled into a lovely garland of flower. A couple of seconds more, and the flavor got completely diffused into the hot water. The flowery ball was apparently litchi flavored, and imparted a lovely fragrant taste into the water. Since I am not an admirer of a hot cup of tea, I had to resort to the feedback of my friend, who happily proclaimed that this was one of the best tea preparations she had ever tasted. 

The festival will run from 7th of September to 13th of September. The pricing is absolutely astounding, and has been kept after duly consulting the students having limited pocket money. The dishes to be served in this festival here are not only visually appealing but are full of flavors and uniqueness. If you happen to possess the zeal and enthusiasm of a culinary adventurer, if you want to try something unique and flavorful for a change, if you want to help Koko to convince Kiki that he loves her more than everything else, drop into Hakuna Matata and help Koko win back the heart of his love.

Nice place for some drinks and dinner at park street, Kolkata. Beers and Cheers is one really cool stuff. I also ordered one appetizer, baked mushrooms, which is also nicely prepared and presented. Reasonable pricing.

Finally landed up going here this week.
The wishing tree on one wall was quite interesting and so was the cheese grater used as a chandelier, thou there are two random pans kept with newspaper cut outs on one side that dint seem to fit the good decor! The chair was quite uncomfortable. Coming to the food had crispy feuille papdi which was good and quite filling. Then had the pan fried polenta cake which was bang on superb and rich in mushroom cream along with the ratatouille lasagne which was a sheer disappointment after the polenta, the salt was less and the vegetable should have been sliced more thinly for it to be flavoursome..since it was with carrot pur√©e which is blander than the tomato pur√©e. Was too full to try the desserts, may be next time.

‚ÄúA veg restaurant in the heart of Park Street?‚Äù
‚ÄúA veg restaurant serving alcohol? How does that even add up?‚Äù
Not only him, it was my exact reaction when I had first come to know of the place. & contrary to what one may think, this restaurant has been doing quite well since it‚Äôs inception. As a hard core non veg Bengali who claims to ‚Äúeat anything & everything if it‚Äôs tasty‚Äù, I practically wrote off Hakuna when it started its operation last year. Exactly a year down the lane, the restaurant has steadily gained popularity & shines amidst the culinary giants in the foodie heaven of the city.
Now ‚ÄòKoko‚Äô is their mascot who was chosen from a no. of entries from a designing competition (he‚Äôs got himself a girlfriend even,¬† kiki, this valentine‚Äôs day). Now Koko & Kiki are on a culinary journey through the world map. Simply put, Hakuna Matata is organising a Fusion Food Fest, featuring a specific country for the whole month, for the next couple of months. They‚Äôve started with South East Asia, which is in stark contrast to their western (if I ignore the desi styled) foods served until now. Our group PanchPhoron was invited over to try out the dishes from the special menu by the owner Mr. Prabhas & Mrs Pallavi themselve. We tasted a variety of dishes, from starters to mains, from beverages to desserts. Here‚Äôs a brief review of the whole experience.

Hakuna Matata is a very famous joint for their extraordinary dishes,exotic flavour as well as lovely presentation.this is a vegetarian joint.the meaning of Hakuna Matata is no worries. lovely interior which was maintained very well. divided two parts ground and first floor and it is very spacious.ground section there is big mirror,upper ceiling¬†was decorated with shot & whiskey glasses.varities of things like mountaineers,wish tree lots of things there.recently i was invited there with my fellow foodies to try out their ‚ÄúKoko goes to South Asia‚Äù festival foods. it will start from next week of this month.in this festival they introduced various types of foods.being a hard core non vegetarian food lover i really loved these vegetarian foods without any hesitation.we satrted our food tasting session with a glass of¬†sweet fresh lime soda which was really good.after that come to the food,

Hakuna Matata doesn‚Äôt need any introduction. This place had gained much hype since it‚Äôs launch about a year back. Occupying a prominent position in the restaurant hub of the city, Park Street, and giving a tough competition to the legendary restaurants there, isn‚Äôt an easy job, which Hakuna has been doing quite well. And above all, this place serves pure veg food ! So, I was really eager to try out the food of this place, which I assumed to be the reason behind the hype. But then, I‚Äôm highly non experimental about veg food and thus could never manage to give this a visit. However, it was through an invitation to ‚ÄòPanchphoron‚Äô for the pre-inauguration of the South-East Asian food festival named ‚ÄòKoko goes to South-East Asia‚Äô, that I finally gave Hakuna a visit and I was glad it happened !

Relatively recent addition to Park Street, Hakuna Matata boasts of excellent food. After having heard a lot about this place, finally i decided to try it out. Mind you its a vegetarian place, and being a non-vegetarian I was a little skeptical. But after tasting the food I was very pleasantly surprised. The items on the menu and the flavours made sure you are not served the typical vegetarian dishes. We ordered one mushroom staters and one pasta. It is good that they already indicate on the menu that one dish is good for two people, so, people have an idea about the portions. The food was delicious and I loved the mushroom starter was the yummy sauce. The place also servers a variety of drinks and cocktails, we ordered cosmopolitan. The interiors are beautifully done up and the 'wish tree' with the colourful sticky notes look pretty. The service was also good and the servers were attentive. Overall, a good experiance, would definitely go back when I am in town again.

Beer prices were dirt cheap and I loved the whole experience... will definitely come back again...see you soon

I went to Hakuna Matata after seeing its decent rating and attractive photos showing well presented food. Sadly it was all a facade. The restaurant wasn't half as attractive in real life, the chairs were uncomfortable and I felt like I was in a fast food joint. After a long wait for the food to arrive, I got a plate full of disappointment. I tried to hide my disappointment and tried to remain positive, after all I had come all the way to eat here. But then the next dish was served and I got another plate full of disappointment. My rating and review might have been a bit harsh(considering my inflated expectations), but still I suggest that you avoid this restaurant.

It's difficult to visit a new place on Park Street given the stellar options. I'm a hardcore non-vegetarian, but gave this place a try based on the reviews and recommendations. Things we ordered: Pizza, Baby Corn Wings, Paneer roll and this chocolate mudpie dessert served in a jar. Along with that we got a long island ice tea and a cosmopolitan.

Drinks: The drinks were well mixed. It was clear that they weren't skimping on the alcohol content. The LIT was really good, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet which a lot of places seem to do. Kudos on the pricing to, a beer just costs 120.

Food: The wings were a delight, the sauce was well made, if you've been to Plan-B in Bangalore and had chicken wings there you would feel right at home. The pizza was one of the best I've had in Kolkata, we got to choose our own toppings, the base was crispy, the toppings and cheese were well done, if nothing else one must try the pizza here. The paneer roll was spicy and saucy, the paneer itself was very soft and the parantha nice and crisp. The dessert was served in a special way, where they poured the chocolate sauce on top of it, which makes the upper covering melt, both the presentation and the taste were top notch. The portions for each of the dishes we ordered was more than generous.

If you're looking to have a great time with family and friends. I can't recommend this place enough.

Well did not know it was a veg restaurant. Yet it amazed me. Got a way out of the traditional non veg platter when you are boozing. Sumptuous brunch of food and variety even in veg platter is possible, and "Hakuna Matata" has done it brilliantly. Cool place and excellent place to hang out with friend.

Well to begin with I am a hard core non vegetarian, i don't write reviews as I visited a lot of restaurant, but after hearing a lot about "Hakuna Matata" i could not stopped my self by visiting this place, and after visitng this place I could not stop my self in penning down about it. so I am writing my first review for this refreshing place,Last Saturday me and some of my friends visited "Hakuna Matata" it is just to say "WOW!! once we entered we felt a very refreshing, the ambience and the decor is marvelous, The creativity is awesome, a very new in the park street area, as we entered this outlet on the right hand, I must appreciate a creative person who is involved in the presentation, any way ....... after entering we saw a wish tree, a new concept "JO APNI DIL KI WISH YA KHWAHISH KO PATTE (Heart shape post it )KE ZARIYE IZHAR KAR SAKE, I think till now it is no where in kolkata and hope even India where i have visited....... ok coming to the food, this outlet knows exactly what the fusion food is.... the way they present their food its really awesome after seeing the presentation of the food your appetite grows more......................... and more and more....... the taste wise wise also the chef has done in a very balanced way as per the taste............. some of the dishes we ordered was potato pizza fries............ the taste and concept of this dish is very unique, its a pizza style but the base is rings of potato which topped with cheese and jalapenos, yummy ............. mouth watering...... pesto base lasagne, then stone baked pizza, where we had given our recipe and they made it for us, it means make your own pizza, excellent work by chef, and followed by some drinks, the drinks presentation is also very awesome and unique, they serve cocktail in a very different glass ware which i used for chemistry lab, which we used earlier in chemistry's practical classes. and we could not order dessert as we were so full and mesmerized with taste......... no worry guys we will drop in again and again and................¬† everything is here is very unique and and refreshing, the server and the co ordination among them is pure hospitality and nothing else...................

well i think i have written a lot which i personally feel is very less for such an innovative place like this, we need some more like Hakuna Matata in our city of Joy.

Thank you very much Hakuna Matata for making our weekend so memorable.

Decor, ambiance and presentation is definitely noteworthy, but what fell behind was the food. I had ordered Pizza Potato Fry where the Potato was not cooked properly, tasted way too salty as well.
In that price range where 30ml of Rum costs Rs 90, I have way too many options in Park Street that would provide delicious food as well.¬†
P.S. : Also it would be good if the management puts some thought to use the juicer inside the kitchen instead of outside; so the noise does not irritate the customer.

Well, I'm rating it a 1.5 out of humility.
Should've gone for 1 star.
We had ordered the Stone baked Pizza. And were asked to fill in the choice of ingredients.

Surprisingly the pizza that arrived was burnt. Had all the ingredients we didn't tick. No olives jalape√±os. The waiter apparently had no clue about the ingredients that were present. The 1.5 star is entirely based on the ambience which was fairly nice and pretty. 
We were so disappointed that we had to leave without ordering anything else because we werent brave enough to take any further risk.

The last time I came here was because it was listed under Mexican food in Zomato and I walked in with a friend who particularly wanted to eat Mexican that day. I asked the waiter what they have under Mexican and he pointed out Mexican rice and could not suggest anything else after asking twice. So we left.

Yesterday night I went there because my sister insisted on eating at Hakuna Matata. We ordered for the mushroom polenta which was exceptional. Also the babycorm in Texas sauce was a new touch and something different. It was well made and still had the crispy texture to it. We also ordered for friend nibbles platter which had an innovative chocolate Falafel. It was neither too sweet and neither savoury. It was well made; the rest of the platter had nothing great. 

We ordered for aglio olio which had a tad bit too much salt and it could have been less dry. The pizza was awesome. I loved it. Also the burger was nice and juicy and so were the Quesadillas. (more Mexican options available)

Drinks were all too good. Go for the bulb cocktail with blue ocean. It has a touch of gondhoraj nimbu which makes it very refreshing. 

They switched off the air-con by 11:30 like they really wanted us to go. Very nice ambience with a wish tree wall with nice messages in multi-color post its taking an entire wall and the other wall in full mirror gives an open look. 

All this food and two rounds of drinks for 5 of us took the bill to 5.5k which I think is reasonable.

Service could be faster with better informed waiters to tend to tables. The bar should have more options and not just keep basic brands being in Park Street. 

Way to go, Hakuna Matata!!

Spoiler: I loved it. Well, there you have it. So, from the moment I entered till I finally walked out, I loved every bit of it. We started of with a couple of beers(happy hours offer enabled us to get two for the price of one). Next we ordered a long island iced tea and a rock island iced tea(upon the waiter's suggestion). Both of them were good and the long island iced tea did exactly what it's supposed to do. Get you tipsy. You could clearly taste the rum but it was not overwhelming, plus the presentation was something to praise. Next we got a plate of fried baby corn, again the presentation was top class, which is more of what I can say for the quantity as well.

After a while the manager along with a couple of waiters came to ask us to cooperate and change the seats cause they had to sit around 10 people together using by joining booths but that was okay and were very polite about it. 

On one occasion, my friend I needed to get a smoke so we asked them if we could go outside and smoke and they seemed to be very okay with that unlike a certain pub(famous for it's stakes and stakes alone, now) I know that's in the vicinity. 

Last but not least, there was live music(band: Jack frost). It's a place that caters to everyone's needs and that is what I liked about it. From 6-7 year olds with their family to a casual date to just two dudes planning to get drunk. They'll serve you well.

Bottom line, this place deserves a visit. Looking forward to enjoying a couple of more rounds at this place.

Located opposite to The Park hotel, the place can be very easily located...

Firstly, the food- it was average, not good, not bad.. we ordered nachos and stone pizza.. nachos were well crisped and the thick gravy with it was spicy, we expected it to be a bit more cheesy. We asked for cheese sauce and were immediately brought some in a cup... The pizza was super crispy but I didn't really like the sauce they used in it... Otherwise it was okay, they should add more options to customize the pizza.

The service- Full marks.. the service was excellent and no complains at all.. they were all ears about what the customer wants and you just need to ask.

The drinks- we went on the Independence day so apparently, we were not served alcohol as it is a dry day. We tried different mocktails. The Ginger Blaster was spicy and tangy, exactly the way I would like. Orange mojito did not disappoint us too. It was perfect. Matata cooler was one of the most refreshing drinks to try out, specially if you are a water melon lover...

Overall, I would rate this place 4. The food presentation and all is very good, just need to take care of the quality and ingredients you use. Don't make it too mushy, try to keep them tasteful.

Well , let me begin this saying vegetarian places are never in my wishlist , so never intended to pay a visit at hakuna matata , till it turned an year old , when i finally stepped in for some light booze and snacking. Honestly the entire credit goes to the staff and service as well as the food presentation for this score. We tried a starter with potato replacing the pizza base and topped with cheese (sorry i forgot the name) , a vodka base cocktail BLUE OCEAN and few pegs of hard drinks. The cocktail had such innovative presentation with ocean blue color in an inverted bulb that came smoking in a pot of dry ice. And lastly the manager surprised us with their speacial dessert chocolate mousse , such warm and sweet gesture , and the mousse was brilliant to say the least. It came in a glass mug with a crisp chocolate disc in top with a central hole , and u have to pour the chocolate sauce through it to indulge in such richness .
Will surely drop in soon for more !

This place is a little, cozy place with a very soft touch to it. 
Located at the centre of Park Street opposite the Park Hotel, it's easily accessible. It has a ground floor seating and an upstairs seating area. You can choose either but you should take a walk upstairs and read all the wishes people have posted on the wall against the staircase. 
The food, italian specifically was delicious and drinks, cocktails, that is look exquisite, but are not so brilliant. They could be improved, may be. But still, the cranberry one is good. Prices are avg, not too expensive. 
The staff is ever smiling and are very attentive :)

Highly disappointed with zomato review about hakuna matata. When we entered we thought it's matched with review, service was good, presentations is also excellent, they used perfect ingredients in their items but the quality and taste didn't matched with their level of presentation. Expected much better taste. But their drinks section was quite better.

Just one word.. OVER HYPED..
ZOMATO misguided me this time.. Been there just after checking reviews n ratings here.
Being a lover of Italian food, I was expecting more delicious pastas with creamy sauce.
Baby corn were OK. Ambience is also fine but pasta they served were not good. My hubby didn't complete his portion.. Even after the portion they serve each plate is very less.. Overpriced !!

Only vegetarian! That's something risk when it comes to bar with only veg! I guess very few people will prefer tht in long run if you don't have extreme good veg food wt service! Coming to the mexican cuisine it was good but quantity was very less and expensive considering the ingrediants! But what i really felt bad was the drinks! Yes you guys present cocktails absolutely stunning but the problem is you guys try to fool us by hardly giving alcohol to the cocktail and make us drink like a mocktail. I didn't like tht! Also when i ordered for a kingfisher pint but instead they gave corona! I thought they didn't have corona so they gv this and will charge fr kingfisher bcz they hardly informed us that kingfisher is not available! But in final billthey charged for corona! I didn't think to argue and paid for what was in the bill bcz already with the cocktail they have fooled us! So, i dint think it will mean much.

- It's just opposite to The Park.
- It offers kind of fusion food..mostly combination of italian/Mexican/indian.
- Suggest to try dishes apart  from pizzas and pastas.The waiters are helpful enough to explain each of them.
- Can be visited multiple times.

Not a fan of Vegetarian food, due to alcohol we thought to stay back and trust me, we had some wonderful cocktail. The ambiance was quite eye catchy, staffs are well behaved. To have more and more drinks we had to order some food, so we place the order of 1. Baby corn wings 2. One similar to a drink n  ite platter (forget the name though) 3. Falafel which had chocolate on it and 4. A pizza. Baby corn perfectly replacing the chicken wings, it was yum yum yum. The platter had some tandoori flavor bread in it which was awesome. Rest all the food just doesnt reminded us  of non-veg. 
It was a wonderful time we spent there....with our old school group. Loved it, for sure . Surely going to come back and recommend others too. Cheers....

To be seeing a place so empty at 1100hrs on a Sunday morning at park street is a surprise, but then this was a new one.....

First and foremost, the hygiene of the place is quite poor.....musty smell, bees all around....the manager & staff kept telling that they are / wanted to do something about it but, it was more lip service than anything else....on the other hand the staff kept standing at their own places pretty much the whole time....the intent was totally missing

The place has been done up well but given the above....kinda ruined the experience

The food (lasagna and something with eggplant/broccoli) was pretty avg....for a bill of shade under a grand....seemed just about ok pricing....

In between the food and orders one of the staff just waltz in and asks for the name, address & mob nos as a matter of right....just goes on to prove that:-
- we have got better lifestyles these days but are still prepared to take nonsense / poor service standards and 
- people just get away with these kind of behaviour / antics

Experience wise I prefer terming 3/5 as generous!!!!

What a disgusting gesture shown.
I was in Park Street Area and decided to have some great weekend time with my colleague to have some good evening, upon reading the reviews we entered the outlet. I will describe you the with details:
Place: The place is very easy to find on Park Street, thanks to the big hoarding they have.

Entrance: Security person will welcome you at the entrance gate. As soon as you step in the staff will reach you to escort your needs. (Positive)

Seating: The place have two seating section one on the ground floor and other on just above it can say as 1st floor. At the time of my visit the upper section was booked for private get-together. (Positive)

Menu: A different presentation of Menu can be seen with lots of items plus one photo menu describing about few dishes. (Positive)

Staff: When asked about suggestion from the menu the staff was dumb and was seems to be confused, i opened up the zomato app and showed him one drink picture and told him that i want to try out this drink, as i was in state that if the drink goes well then i will settle down for some food.

Drink: As the drink arrived, the garnishing was not as they show pictures in zomato app, when i asked whats wrong in the drink, they informed me that they do not have the proper material to do the garnishing, upon asking that why this was not informed to me at the time of order taking, NOW COMES the disgusting surprise: the 3 staff people was smiling shamelessly and was saying what can we do when the marterial is not there. Literally i understood that even if a will say one more word to them it will nothing do positive to me rather than will further expose how well trained staff they are. People at side of my table were also noticing and as per their expression they were also surprised at the gesture from the staff.

Thanks Hakuna Matata for fooling, kindly do not fool people in such a way.
No more future visits and recommendations.

Reminisce hit me hard when I was passing by this place named, "Hakuna Matata". A popular caf√© spot with great ambience in Bangalore, by the same name, was what I felt would be in the city of Kolkata. I, along with my friends went inside this restaurant. Ordered a cosmopolitan, 5 tequila shots , 2 beer and 1 Desi swag. The beer, though was good, the cosmopolitan was rather like a fruit juice. We then ordered some burgers. The burgers were good.The price was high, but was not at all worth in comparison to that of in Bangalore. Overall not a good place to visit again.
Cheers..

Too pricey for the food that is being provided. Purely from a foodie'e view, I was intrigued by the catchy name, and the option of having a pure veg meal. However, the Pizza that we ordered was not what was expected, lacking the softness and the comfort of an actual Pizza. I have heard that the platter is the most famous dish in the place, so shall visit one more time, and update the review.

All food and drinks served were scrumptious. Will recommend for its decor and presentation even food is tasty.. Best in town for vegetarians. I would name one staff kartick treated us so well that I remember his name. Thanks to the team to make my birthday special.

We ordered the mozzarella and leek croquette and the mini baked crostini, for dessert we ordered the koko lava fondant , the food was delicious. The drinks menu is interesting  , specially liked the matata cooler. The highlight of this place is the presentation of the food .

Vegetarian place. We ordered a platter each of fried and non fried nibbles. Both were pretty good. Service is good and ambience is very nice. Not too expensive as well. Located in park street almost across the park hotel. The food was tasty but non veg options would be better for me, personally. Nice experience.

No I do not really have a problem with veg food but it is my personal choice that I do not really like to pay for veg food.
I land up here since the name is catchy. The ambience is small but nice. Very likable. Art work here and there and tastefully decorated tables,etc. really liked my rum n coke served in a beaker and volumetric flask. Chemistry became interesting.
Staff was good and the price was a little on the higher side. 70INR FOR 200ml COKE. But you might just be satisfied since the bill arrives in a fancy miniature bicycle.

I had decided to visit all restaurants and caf√©s which I hadn't eaten out before, on Parkstreet before I left Calcutta and this was the first on my list, thanks to my boyfriend.
However, when I got back from here, I just had two things on my mind :


1. Why did I pay like ‚Çπ 250 on a pint of beer ?
2. I need a dominoz to wipe out the bad aftertaste of the pizzas I had here.

The quantities are pitiable, and the pricing is not suited to student budgets, even if you are not on karki.

The ambience is Okayish and the service slow.

Two likeable things however were :

1. Their Long Island Tea.
2. Their socially responsibled-ness because try actually took out IDs to make sure we were above 21 years of age.


Not recommending this place. Do not go here, you've been warned.

Actually. I am writing on them in together for 2 times thus giving 4 stars. When i went there first time and ordered spaghetti aglio o lio, they served me penne pasta instead in parcel. After reaching my destination i was quiet disappointed but then i let it go. Suddenly during rain i wished to go their again as i was hungry and didnt have an umbrella. But this time with the malaysian tofu curry. My heart melt. Thus a good and bad both experience. You can either love this place or hate it. Both. Isnt that what the whole park st is all about? ;)

My 600th Review
***********************

"Hakuna Matata"- the name itself was so catchy that it dragged my attention from the moment it showed up its existence in the city.

##Location:
At the heart of Park Street just opposite to the Park Hotel.

##Experience:
Even if it is a vegetarian restaurant but it successfully dragged me for the second time even me being a hardcore non veg foodie.
On the second visit I tried their bulb cocktail and Choco mud pie after a sufficing dinner somewhere else.
I was there for the Nolen gur cheese cake which made me fall in love on my first visit but unfortunately due to high demand of the dish I didn't get that.
But the mud pie did not let us down and did perfect justice for the dessert session. Also the bulb cocktail was made well with perfect proportion of mix. 
I was so happy and excited after my first visit here but even after the second visit it remained the same. My experience about this place is so different it's worth a share so decided on putting up a blog too for more details about them. 

##Service is one of their prime skillful area which is always executed with ease and style.
Loved them and wish their whole team all the best.

I went to this cafe a few days back with a bunch of friends. The ambience is great specially the wishing tree as they call it. The staff is quite courteous and gives good suggestions.¬†We ordered for Crispy baby corn wings - which was delicious and Penne arrabiata - which was too tangy for our taste, for desserts we ordered Mocha Mousse and Hakuna fresh fruit crepes- the only fresh fruit in that crepe were bananas!But the mocha mousse just stole my heart, we ended up ordering it twice.

Went here for a beer and some finger food.
Beer was chilled and served in a nice chilled mug.
Decor was nice, though a little confusing.
It's new and quirky in a heritage bar place like park street.
The place is new and it's pretty eye catchy.
Good place for a drink.

We ordered their potato pizza thingy, which was just okay.
It was over seasoned and missed balance.
Well maybe they were having a bad day.

Will visit again.

Also, peanuts in a shot glass looks cool, but seriously, no. It wont work, logistically stupid.

We were looking forward to have a different dining experience at Park Street and not typical street food one so we landed up at Hakuna Matata. We ordered rice paper wrap dumplings, Mexican chipotle  bowl and regular lime soother. Amazing presentation and very filling meal. Quantity was very good. Also they had these heart shaped post it notes stuck all over the walls and ceiling. Lovely feel. Very cosy dining experience. Would love to come again.

The bright yellows all around is an instant mood-lifter, and it is evident that a lot of thought has gone into the decor of the entire place. The hand-woven barricades made by local artists, the coasters with happy Swahili words, the stick-it Wishing Tree, the three sculpted mountaineers by Chhatrapati Dutta, symbolizing exploration and adventure, the miniature cycles and the painted oars showing travel and movement ‚Äì all come together to induce a very positive vibe and also fuels your wonderlust.

Superb location at the heart of park street opposite Park hotel though at the same time not good from a parking stand point. So when I went their 2 spots were full so I had to park 1 km ahead as I could not get parking anywhere closer. However despite that this place is absolutely worth it.  Went there for a family dinner and boy the food was deliciously sumptuous. The service was also excellent. They serve the food items stylishly and when I didn't like a pesto gnocchi they were so sweet and used quick thinking to convert it into a rice dish with the same gravy as the gravy was good. We ordered a matata cooler which was a good mocktail. Everything we ordered and ate apart from the gnocchi was excellent - thin crust pizza, Malaysian tofu curry, baked paneer kathi roll among others. The best part is that the portions were just right for sharing and trying more dishes and the food didn't feel heavy at all. I highly recommend this place to all veg food lovers ( no non veg here) who want to eat excellent light food with different kind of items. Even the decor and the cutlery and the dishes they were serving in along with the glasses were contemporary good designs which add as a part of the experience of eating here.

Passing by Park Street, I'm sure many of you have noticed the bright yellow banner that spells "HAKUNA MATATA".
And I'm sure as well that you've given it a thought at least once that what does it mean actually?!!
Well, it is a swahili phrase which means 'no worries'. In fact once you step inside, you eventually leave all your worries behind the corridor, as the cute little mascots Koko and Kiki welcomes you to a world of joy and fantasy.
Yes, that's the way the place is decorated with a lot of innovations involved behind each and every signage and artworks used to craft the decor. The entire interiors reflect a classy yet quirky vibe, and perhaps innovative mind is the biggest asset that has been utilised to create this concept altogether. Specially the mascots Koko & Kiki, the wish tree, the right choice of furniture complementing perfectly with the decor, and all the other artworks, everything combines perfectly to make an ambience, which is distinguished, different and exciting enough to enjoy the rollercoaster ride that takes you to a world of joy and brings a flattering glee on your face.

Perhaps, that's the reason the founders of the place Prabhash & Pallavi, are happily smiling, whenever you meet them. It proves that it is the smiling face that can make others smile. And they have done it successfully.
They are a charming duo with strong sense of hospitality, and the way they treat their guests is something worth learning. Each and every moment of your stay at this place is sure to be a prized possession in your memory, and Prabhash & Pallavi will be an indispensable part of the entire experience.

The service persons are courteous, well trained and prompt in their duty. In fact the entire team cooperates really good so as to provide the best service to the guests.

And now comes the art of mixing that is really something sure to amaze anyone, anytime!! The wide range of mocktails and cocktails available here is not only some drinks to sip on, but rather an art of the mixer/bar tender, crafted with excellence. Every sip you have, you'll feel the magic that it creates on your taste buds.
Among the mocktails, the 'must have' items include "Orange Mojito" and "Ginger Blaster" and if you have a preference for mild taste/flavor, you can also try "Matata Cooler".
For the alcohol lovers, this place can be a heaven for the mindblowing cocktails, of which the 'must have' ones include "Cheers and Beers", "Desi Swag", "Blue ocean(bulb)", "Green valley(bulb), and off course the showstopper of all cocktails, "African Sunset". If you like mild taste you can also try "Crystal lady(bulb)".
For the health conscious foodies out there, it is requested to try the "Fruit tea" of this place. It is a miraculous concoction of yummilicious fruity notes and nutritional replenishment. Also it is good for detoxification of body.

So far the food is concerned, it can be challenged that this place will change your entire perception of vegetarian food from the very first bite you have. They have raised the art of experimenting with food to such a level that even the common household items like ladies finger, saag(roughage leaves), potato etc tasted extraordinarily delicious. The 'must have' items include "Crunchy fried bharwan bhindi", "Pizza potato fries", "Chocolate pizza", "Mini baked crostini", "Pita naan pakoda", "Polenta stuffed baked mushroom", "Caesar salad", "Baked aloo paneer kati roll" and "Desi saag risotto".

Now, who don't like to end a meal with some sweet anecdotes??!!! Perhaps every foodie out there!!
And to conclude a meal sweet ended 'Hakuna Matata" have a good set of dessert options of which one of the 'must have' is "Flame of fame Mocha mousse", a gooey chocolaty dessert with a unique way to have it(let it be a surprise for your visit :D).
And there comes the showstopper of all the desserts, the "NOLENGUR CHEESE CAKE"!!! If you have not tasted it yet, you don't know what you are missing out!!! One of the best dessert you'll get to taste in a lifetime for sure.

Another thing that deserves appreciation is the way, the food and beverages are presented to the guests. In fact "Hakuna Matata" is a live example to showcase, how to make the best use of the concept of innovation!!! From concept to presentation, everywhere you'll find a reflection of innovative thoughts involved.

Overall, a must visit place for all the foodies out there.
Highly recommended, and wishing "Hakuna Matata" all the success in future.

Thanks a lot to

I have never been to a completely vegetarian cafe/ restaurant before, and I would cringe at the thought of it. But I'm glad I visited this place. Not only did it change my opinion but it is now highly recommended by me.
*Look and Feel* 
 A very different atmosphere from the usual cafes we go to. Very funky, yet gorgeous. Good ambient lighting, click a picture anywhere and its bound to come out good ! There are two floors to it. The wall adjacent to the staircase is adorned with these tiny notes from happy customers ! It does justice to its name !
**Food, Drinks and Presentation **
First of all I would like to mention that the waiters are very well trained. We went there almost at the closing hours, yet they were very happy to serve us without any hurry.
Three of us had a drink each . One Matata Cooler, one Desi Swag( vodka sikhanji) and one large whiskey peg. Matata cooler was non alcoholic and had a refreshing taste to it. 
We took a starter, Baked And Stuffed Mushrooms, 5 stuffed mushrooms wonderfully presented and lovely to taste. Mushrooms were really fresh and baked perfectly.  
To the main course now. 
	‚ÅÉ	Thin Crust Pizza with Thai chilli base, topped with Mushrooms, Pineapples and bell peppers. Certainly one of the better pizzas I've had. 
	‚ÅÉ	Eggplant and brocolli Lasagne. The round garlic bread on top stole the show. Ample quantity, tasty and fresh. The chef nailed it. Though I almost couldn't stop thinking how good a Lamb Lasange would feel about right then. üòú
For dessert we chose the Nolengur Cheesecake. Definitely my non Chocolate favorite dessert for now.

Finally we have an excellent 100% vegetarian bar cum restaurant in park street area. Quirky but awesome food. The creative ways in which they serve the drinks and the food is fascinating. I never thought that beer can taste so good with the shikanji. It might get a bit difficult for you to order the food as the name of the dishes are pretty quirky but never mind, the staff at the restaurant is superb and they will make sure that they explain the dishes to you and would recommend the best items from the menu to suit your taste buds. Excellent ambience to relax and enjoy the evening. Just want to make a point to the management that however the cocktails that you serve taste excellent at the beginning but by the time i finished my Cheers and Beers mocktail the after taste was not that good.

This purely vegetarian restaurant is just good for its presentation. The food tasted really bad. The pasta was not even properly boiled. Visit this place if only you want click some good pictures of yourself and the food.

Vegetarian place, but, but, the food is quirky, fancy and tasty! One will fall in love with the ambience and the way they plate their food as well as their alcoholic concoctions. We took the orange infused LIIT and a shikanji beer which is one of its kind. It was very tasty and quite cheap. A sangria jello shot was given to us complimentary but it was okayish. We took a non-fried nibbles platter that looked gorgeous and tasted pretty great too! Although the chef could have cut down on the use of curd in all the portions. Overall a nice experience of happy eating+drinking in Park Street. Just wish they introduced some non vegetarian cuisine as well.

A little too expensive... but the food is quite good. It's a good choice of restaurant, if you're a vegetarian and love continental food. To non-vegitarians out there, you might want to give it a try if you're NOT in the mood for non-veg for once.

Heard of this place with cool interesting drinks and a all veg menu.

The location is convenient and the ambience nice. The drinks have interesting names but they are quite funny in taste. We did not like either of our drinks. Tried he desi swag and the ultra bloody Mary. All drinks come with chat masala on the glass rims. 
Food was also not to be taste, tried the potato pizza and did not find any other interesting option on the menu. A lot of items sound weird like a chocolate pizza with jalape√±os and garlic etc. I am all for experimentation but this one is a failed experiment.
I am surprised at he good reviews this place has got.

Hakuna Matata a place with very unique name and a place of innovations. But what is Hakuna Matata? When you step in at this place you leave all your tension, thoughts and worries outside that is what this place is all about. Hakuna Matata is what we call ‚ÄúNo Worries‚Äù in Swahili. Thus this place offers you all sort of happinesss and comfort that you want to get beyond your daily life, as said earlier this place has something more than just food fellas!
                                                                ...

Hakuna Matata is easily the best restaurant I have been to in a while. I loved the interiors, the d√©cor, their Wish Tree, and the fact that it‚Äôs a pure vegetarian restaurant right in the middle of Park Street. I tried their mini baked crostini and the ratatouille lasagne. Both were delicious, and the price was easy on my pockets! I will definitely be back for more fusion delights!

This place has really good ambience & food. They have a mix of dishes - indian , italian, mexican. I suggest you try the nachos, lasagne. The paneer lasagne is more like a curry filled lasagne but interesting to try.

Having heard so much about this place, I decided to drop in with friends for mocktails and desserts after a heavy lunch.¬†
We ordered Nolen Gur Cheese Cake, Mango Cheesecake, Matata Cooler, Ginger Blaster, Orange Mojito and a Virgin Mojito. I loved how the Matata cooler, a refreshing watermelon based drink was presented in a chemistry lab flask.
The Orange Mojito was also spot on and I would have ordered a second one but I was already too full.
Both the Nolen Gur cheesecake and Mango Cheesecake we ordered were delicious, and I liked how they were presented on granite slabs.¬†
I want to specially give them extra points for the Mocktails which were brilliantly presented and tasted as good as they looked. The servers were friendly and very polite. ¬†Hakuna Matata's decor is also very pleasant to look at, and the wishing tree is something unique, where one can write down any wish on a sticky note and put it up on that tree on the wall. It adds so much color to the place!¬†
I think its a great place for vegetarians and I will soon go back to try their main course dishes. I am extremely satisfied with my experience with the desserts and mock tails.

This was the chosen place where I was meeting a friend after 4 years. It exactly reflect the kind of vibe we shared - quirky, fun and full of life. So much for the ambiance and the menu, that most part of our conversation revolved around the place and the food here. Full points for capturing our attention.

Without much ado we ordered a veg Panini, Pizza fries as it was an in-house special and 2 mocktails with a lemon and an orange base. Service time was decent - not too early or late. 

We were very surprised when the order first arrived. The presentation looked amazing (fried bhindi in a rustic kettle with fumes coming out of the nozzle) but it did not quite taste like what we had ordered. Upon inquiring, we realised that our order was swapped but it did not taste bad too. The staff immediately apologised for the lapse and served the right order. Lot of catching up, laughs and banter followed in the 90 minutes we spent there and we got lucky as there was live music that day as there was a corporate event going on. Loved the way bill was brought to us in a tiny little wrought iron cycle and also all the little pieces that added to the peppy interiors - the wish tree, grater chandelier, cycle basket vases. Price is a little towards the higher side but I wouldn't mid spending the extra bucks given the experience I had.

Would love to go back again and may be try the bhindi starter üòâ

Quintessential caf√© located in the heart of Park Street with a vibrant ambience. Hakuna Matata is definitely a place you won't regret visiting, once you are there.
The vegetarian food is worth trying , you get a chance to literally customize your pizza. More than the food I loved the beverages here. The cocktails are pretty much innovative, presented really well and tastes amazing. I am going to try all of them in my subsequent visits.
The service is good and the staff are amiable.
Pricing - totally affordable rates, it won't burn a hole in one's pocket.
This place is definitely recommended.
Updated on 13th Sept 2016 :
My friends and me decided to celebrate a birthday which went totally in sync. The service was highly hospitable and the food was delectable. This is one place I tend to keep going back and they never stop to amaze me.
Must try : Pan-fried Polenta Cake , Litti Chokha Shot and Polenta stuffed baked mushroom. Cocktail: Desi swag and Cheers and beers. Loved the complimentary dessert which was Green tea panna cotta with a hint of lemon zest. Thank you!

I loved the experience here. I was with my family and since it was Christmas time, all the places were full. We hopped in here and what we found was an amazing ambience. The staff here were very polite and they even guided us in choosing the dishes. What I loved was the uniqueness of the dishes and the fusion of flavors that I had. The only minus point is that it is a pure vegetarian outlet. So, it somehow diminishes the options. Other than that, a great hangout place. A must-visit place for people having sweet-tooth.

Here to attend my first Bloggers Meetup for an occasion of New Menu launch of the Restaurant. Event Organised by the Owners Mr. Prabhas and  Mrs. Pallavi in Collaboration with Shahbaaz Zaman.¬†. ¬†Before with Discuss anything i have some interesting facts to share with you about the Restaurant. So let's start with The name First 'Hakuna Matata' The Swahili Phrase taken from East African Bantu language which simply means 'no worries for the rest of your days' to fulfill that quote they are producing global food in their local kitchen and make finger leaking delicious dishes so that we enjoy our meal and feel our worries evaporated. now let's meet their Mascot 'KOKO' an fun loving creature who represents the fun and free spirit of the world. In his first valentine he got his girl 'KIKI'. you can see them enjoying together at first floor's left side wall named 'deja vu in the Hakuna Matata age'. By their Mascot they wanted to send a message that 'The fastest way to a Person's heart is through its tummy' for that they take quality, taste and presentation of food very seriously. Move on to 'Wishing Tree' which was on the wall where stairs was. a beautiful thought that at Hakuna Matata wishes comes true So write your wishes and stick them in the wishing tree. I see lot of wishes on the wishing tree with some feedbacks and idiotic stuffs like 'Champu loves Champa'. In the Bar Decor you see paddles and a bicycle with the help of these they want to say us that they travelled alot around the world to provide us brilliant quality drinks and foods. The moment you enter the Restaurant look on your top you see two sculptures of rock climbers made by Mr. Chhatrapati Dutta signifies the exploration, adventure and passion. The Key ingredients of the food they prepare and presents for us. Restaurant Decor was extremely amazing. They have two sections. 1st one was in ground floor which has bar and dine in section for regular customers. 2nd one was on first floor which has a private Mezzanine for private dine in with family and friends. They have live music show us sung by a beautiful voiced singer & live sports screening and a valet parking. Cool looking place which was beautifully designed and decorated with comfortable sitting arrangement. Whole Credit goes to the innovative minds of Owners. they did really hardwork to make this place that much interesting.
                                          ...

Recently I went to this place and had a fantastic time. It is very easy to locate, it is situated absolutely in the heart of Park Street. They have recently introduced a new menu, which looked quite interesting. We ordered the polenta stuffed baked mushroom, which was delicious; and a special mention for the Pizza. The staff was pretty courteous and patient. I thought they must have hiked up their prices with the new menu, but the cheque was very reasonable. I will definitely be visiting this place again soon.

Finally... visited this amazing place in Park Street.  Fun filled ambience, fancy menu, a nice place to chill out with friends... food presentation is appealing... only one drawback... slightly on the expensive side...
A must visit place with friends if you just want to chat for an hour or so!
 One shouldn't be thinking of having a proper meal(lunch/dinner). :)

Most horrible place to eat for vegeterian foods. The rates are also too high. Only the desserts are a saving grace here. The vegetarian dishes were nothing more of boiled vegetables while some had some extra cheese. They looked great but taste was utterly horrible.

This was my first visit here, and I must say I had a great time. I was glad to find free WiFi which actually works. The ambience was great, and the service was good. I ordered the Classic Thin Crust Pizza, Spinach Cannelloni and Matata Cooler. The food was amazing, especially the pizza. The best part is that the prices aren't high, the place is pretty affordable. Hakuna Matata is a must visit!

Hakauna Matata, a Swahili phrase which roughly means ‚Äúno worries‚Äù. And if you are guessing why such a name? You should recall your memories and remember that famous song of ‚ÄúThe Lion King‚Äù which we all used to love in our childhood. And you actually forget all your problems and worries as soon as you enter this magical place. Hakuna Matata is one of those places where you would get something more than food. This place is just as amazing as you would like to have. Each and every department is perfectly handled by one of the most innovative owners I have seen. Mr. Prabhas & Mrs. Pallavi, the owners of this amazing place are just too good with their innovative skills. They are creative and have executed their plans perfectly well. A place where you would be stunned with the ideas and concept they have put into to make the place.

It's located in one of the best areas of Kolkata. We ordered watermelon juice which was served in a round bottom flask. Nice way of serving food. The ice tea was so so. A little too sweet for my liking. The coffee shake was really good. Perfect amount of everything there. 
So one can choose which toppings, base, sauce one wants on the pizza here. They say it's for 2 people. But if you're a foodie, trust me it's for 1 only. 
The white sauce and red sauce pastas were good. So so to be fair. They charge extra for adding vegetables to the pasta which is absurd.
The green sauce pasta is bland. Really bland.
We ordered spicy baby corn. The presentation was really nice but the taste was only so so. 
The staff is really good and responsive. Service is superb. 
All in all a place worth visiting

Well "Koko" (official Muscatof the restaurant) took me to a cullinary journey and at the end i was enamoured by the food and drinks served.
Location-This eatery is located on to Park hotel in the ever bustling park street.
The owners MrPrabhas and MrsPallavi,  won us over with their infection smile and warm welcome, they proved the perfect guide providing details aboit all the food and drinks served.
#Moctails and cocktails#
Cheers and beers
This was a unique fusion of beer with shikhaji mix, orange juice, and soda. A refreshing drink  Beaitifully presented and befitting for two. This is a must for setting the mood of an "adda".

African Sunset
This drink bowled me over the moment it was served. The presentation was one of a kind and for me this was the highlight. The gello served along added an extra touch to the whole fusion.
Bulb Cocktails
These cocktails were vodhka based served in unique inverted bulb bottles. Named 
Blue Ocean-as the name suggests, blue in color and slightly sweet
Green valley- loved the hint of mint and pinapple and mint juice. 
Crystal Lady- This for a change was gin based, clear in appearance and tased much like mohjito, but the lemonade and gomme syrup blended to perfection added an edgge to the drink
Desi Swaag
A stylish vodka based drink which was tangy and refreshing.
#Gourmet Nibbles#
These dishes perfectly compliments the drinks served and i am sure when with friends they will fly off in moments.
Crunchy Fried Bharwan Bhindi
OMG!! Can our naive ladysfingers be so tasty!! They habe done the unthinkable, here is bhindi in it's crunchiest and tastiest avataar served with blue cheese mayo mustard and khatta aam. This was a delight.!!
Pizza Potato Fries
this dish exactly looks like a pizza but you will be pleasantly befooled to find potatoes fried in a semi dry graby of tomato sauce topped with oozing cheese. I am sure this will be the dish to look out for all the potato lovers.
Mini Baked Crostini
Beautifully presented these were nibbles stuffed with saag and date jam. Perfect blend of saltly and sweet delight.
Pita Naan Pakoras
Yummy and quite a mouthful. Pita breads stuffed with chana masala humus, and the hara chutney to add a bit of tang
Polenta Stuffed Baked Mushroom
This small wonders explode in yr mouth with a handful of flavours. I love mushroom and this really satified me.!!
#Salad#
CaesarSalad
I absolutely afore Caesar salad but this was the first time i was trying the vegetarian version.But once again i was bowled over, fresh lettuce, beaitiful seasoning,with pumpkin seeds, parmesan shavings and dash of lemon. The roasted peas did the trick for me.
#From Koko with Love#
Baked alu paneer kaki roll
This rolls are small wonders dipped in kadai gravy topped with dhaniya and mirch pesto. This is filling and delicious.
Desi Saag Risotto
For me this dish was out of the world!! To start with the presentation was encore and the taste left me spellbound. I completely fell in love with this risotto. Cooked to perfection and a perfect example of fusion food one must try this dish.
#Dessert#
Flame of Fame Mocha Mousse
Can a dessert be an absolute visual spectacle?? Yes it can be. The oozing gooey chocolate mousses is served in a glass with a paper thin chocolate rim. As one pours the hot chocolate sauce the rim melts and voila!! The dessert lies within. The chocolate mousse will surely satify the carving of those those with sweet tooth
Cheesecake of the day
Well you must be thinking..cheesecake..not again!! This is an absolutely Yummilicious Nolen gur cheesecake with leaves you craving for more....yummyyyy...is the last word.

This be ready to be served by the ever smiling manager Mr Vakil Ahmed and taste the culinary wonders prepared by Mr Chanchal Dutta. Another very important fact their food is free of baking soda and monosodium glutamate. If you are still sceptical thinking of trying vegetartian food don't even think twice, do pay a visit to this absolutely wonderful place called "Hakuna Matata"and leave yr worries behind.

A new player at the game on the buzzing blocks of Park Street, but it surely sounds like a game over for some closely situated competitors.
I have walked right past this place a couple of times without noticing more than the occasional brand name. Now that I have visited it, I regret on missing out on so many possible dine ins. 

~~**~~¬† Refreshingly cool drinks are the best way to start off a perfect dining experience. The presentation was spell binding throughout.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Cheers And Beers : Beer is mixed with masala shikanji, soda and orange juice. The sourness of shikanji blends well with the beer to whip up an outstanding concoction. Its served with an orange jelly that‚Äôs equally amazing.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†African Sunset : This is a bucket filled with orange juice punched with some secret recipe (apparently they won‚Äôt tell) with an inverted beer bottle. At first you get the orange taste in majority. Then as you started to empty the beer into the tumbler, gradually the cocktail takes it true form.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Ginger Blaster : The mocktail truly has a blast of ginger and coriander. The whiskey glass is set atop a yellow kettle with smoke exuding from its nozzle. Remember not to have this via straw, as the glass is rimmed with an acerbic masala. In addition it also has a spice element which is powered by tabasco sauce.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Matata Cooler : It comes in a bulb shaped flask with an ultimate appearance. The drink is a combination of tender coconut water, watermelon juice and mint extracts. This is as refreshing as it gets. Also the flavour of lime juice is eminent.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Bulb Cocktails : These are three separately cocktails that you‚Äôll find on the menu named as the following descriptions. Blue Ocean is vodka based with blue curacao, pineapple juice and lime. Green Valley is also vodka based with green mint syrup, pineapple juice and lime. Crystal Lady is gin based with lime, gomme syrup and lemonade. These have been clubbed together as the presentation is equivalent for all of them being served in bulb shaped flasks which are set into martini glasses with crushed ice acting as a cushion. The taste was satisfactory.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Orange Mojito : This is just another variant of the virgin mojito which has added orange flavour. I had read about this cooler in the reviews and sorely wanted to try it. But after having it, it failed to meet expectations.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Desi Swag : The name itself signifies that the drink might contain added amounts of spice. In the instant case, finely cut chilli. It is vodka based and mixed with lemonade base. But the strong chilli flavour is intense.

~~**~~¬† It‚Äôs always great to have a bunch of starters along with drinks. These might be labelled ‚Äúnibbles‚Äù but they are quite filling.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Pizza Potato Fries : It might sound and seem like a pizza, but don‚Äôt get confused. Its sliced potato fries layed down on a wooden pan just like a pizza. Its topped with jalapenos, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. Taste‚Äôs amazing if you consume it with the toppings.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Crunchy Fried Bharwan Bhindi : I am not a bhindi lover but I liked the dish. The bhindi is coated with bread crumbs and then fried till its golden brown. The outer layer was rightly crunchy. Its served with blue cheese mayo and khatta aam relish.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Chocolate Pizza : For a true pizza devotee, this is a dessert version. This is not something you can just gorge down on. One has to take time to cherish the exquisite flavours. The toppings included jalapeno and corn.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Mini Baked Crostini : Awesomely graceful looks, this item was a first timer for me. Crispy cones inserted in shot glasses which were filled with date jam. This was my favourite for the evening.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Pita Naan Pakoda : The pita naan wraps inside fried chick pea patty and is served with green chutney. Its garnished with an abundance of coriander.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Polenta Stuffed Baked Mushroom : A slice of the freshest tomato resembles the base and a soft ball of polenta bloated mushroom. Consuming it with the tomato slice gives it an extra tangy flavour.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Caesar Salad : One of the most trending salads nowadays, and each is trying to whip up a better one. HM lags behind in this section in regards to its core ingredients, but the dressing is up to the mark.

~~**~~¬† Couple of mains to go with the above.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Baked Aloo Paneer Kati Roll : Don‚Äôt think of it as a regular roll. This exemplary dish might be the healthiest roll you‚Äôll ever have. It is filled with dhaniya pesto, green chilli, kadai gravy and Julienne cucumber slaw. Ordering a plate will be pretty satisfying for two.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Desi Saag Risotto : Almost everything included in the menu here is on the healthy side. The desi twist given to the risotto is by garnishing it with fried okra (bhindi).

~~**~~¬† An evening of efficient dining is incomplete without some savouring desserts.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Flame of Fame Mocha Mousse : Making this mousse is no child‚Äôs play. We are talking about a dessert so unique that I have only witnessed such art on telly shows. The hot chocolate works its magic on the frozen chocolate disk as it melts into the glass, where it meets the crumb. The taste is scintillating.Though we were expecting a fiery chocolate mousse, we weren‚Äôt disappointed by what we received.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Nolen Gur Cheesecake : This is by far, the best cheesecake I have had in the city. I couldn‚Äôt refrain myself from having a second and a third go at it. Its elegantly decorated with nolen gur caramel and blueberry infusion.

The head chef, Mr.Chanchal, has pushed boundaries when it comes to taste and demonstration.
They have an ever active Facebook page which you should definitely visit to participate in weekly contests that can win you couple of freebies, which is managed by the proactive owners, Pallavi and Prabhas. They have been putting in a lot of effort towards the interior as well with the primary focus being on traditional or local articles.
The staff is really efficient in their work. The major difference here is the level of interaction with the customers. The restaurant ensures the customers get to know their visually also. The descriptive brand cards (menu cards) display the pictures of how the actual dish will look like. Plus they come up with loads of seasonal menus and also for special occasions.

P.S. : After their bar launch, things look more promising as ever.

‚ÄúLet the good times roll.‚Äù

Kolkata's been lately opening up to cafes and restaurants serving strict vegetarian fusion food. And the response has been overwhelming! One such wonder story is shared by Pallavi and Prabhas. You see that twinkle and spark when they talk about their baby, their first venture together, Hakuna Matata. They have been involved in bringing it up so much that when you leave the door of HM you will but leave with a dream of opening your venture one day!

Hakuna Mata lives upto it's name. You enter and leave your worries outside. Interestingly beautiful, extremely significant decor welcomes you! Wow...I do not think any inch has been set up casually; every nook and corner screams Hakuna Matata. And the cutest thing being, their mascot, Koko. Kiki, his girlfriend is the newest addition in the HM family!

Special mentions: 

They have two talented people, providing live music to the already lively ambience! 

Mr. Wakil, the smiling Manager, the happiness and satisfaction amongst the staff was quite evident! A happy place indeed!

Note:

Keep checking the Hakuna Matata facebook page, they keep offering events and competitions, and drinks of the house!

Much about the place, let's come down to the food. By the end of this food ride, trust me, you (the non-veg eater) will not miss your meat!

The Mocktails were an array of brilliance! They also had cocktails arranged and equally brilliantly thought out. 

1. Cheers and Beers: Summers "were" incomplete without beer! Now, a visit to Park Street would be incomplete without trying their "Cheers and Beers." This one's a brilliant concoct of beer, shikanji, orange juice, soda, orange jelly, and love! Clearly, the drink of the night.

2. African Sunset: The African stands for a figurine who accompanies the drink and has smoke oozing out of his head (looks cute!) while the sunset depicts the orange juice infused with beer.

3. Ginger Blaster: The best cocktail of the evening! The glass rim is laced with chat masala. The presentation was mentionable.

4. Matata Cooler: Quite a hit with ladies. I had never experienced such brilliant concoct of coconut water, fresh watermelon juice. 

¬†

5. Bulb Cocktails: The name is a giveaway...the drinks are served in inverted bulb like glasses which is in turn is inserted into a martini glass full of crushed ice! The names were Blue Ocean, Crystal Lady, and Green Valley.

6. Desi Swag: The name oozes swag...It's a chilli based drink...The base of a mix of vodka and shikanji. The ever flavorful ginger and chat masala taste could also be felt! 

Nibbles

1. Crunchy Fried Bharwan Bhindi: While the world complains about bhindi, so do I. But the world still needs to try this! The bhindi was filled with spices and coated in a crunchy batter and tasted heavenly with the blue cheese mayo mustard and the aam relish!

2. Pizza Potato Fries: The bed was of potatoes and pizza topping on the top completed the dish. Yumm is the word.

3. Chocolate Pizza: Heard of this before but m sure you have tasted nothing like this before!! Each bite talked of sweetness, spiciness and crunchiness! Where did they come up with this!!?? Amazing!

4. Mini Baked Crostini: Uncommon, never seen, never before heard of dish but tasted super! Crunchy cone with a filling topped with date jam....a mouthful of freshness and evenness!

5. Pita Naan Pakoda: Rolled pita with a  channa patty covered with green chutney. 

¬†

6. Polenta Stuffed Baked Mushroom: A slice of tomato as the base, the ball sits on it. You have to put the entire thing inside else the essence is lost! A little on the tangy side thanks to the tomato but different nonetheless!

Salad

1. Ceaser Salad: Tried and tested salad. Known to all but you would love their dressing and presentation!

From Koko with Love

1. Baked Aloo Paneer Kati Roll: Wholesome, huge, filling, cannot be fitted inside the mouth all at once! But you can differentiate the aloo, the paneer and the soft paratha!

2. Desi Saag Risotto: Beautiful green rissotto greeted us with a in-house baked bread and fried okhras. The next minute it was gone, wiped out and clean! best eaten when hot!

Desserts

1. Flame of Fame Mocha Mousse: I had only seen this in MasterChef, Kolkata's serving such desserts...wow!! The chef, Mr. Chanchal takes it to a new level altogether! You have a cup of warm chocolate and a chocolate disc covering the mousse cup. You pour, it melts into the cup. Heavenly;y to watch, heavenly to taste! 

2. Nolen Gur Cheese Cake: I slurp as i write this...cheesecake and nolen gur. Sweetness has never gets overboard. A taste that lingers, a memory that travels with you!

The hosts left no stones unturned to make you feel at home. Their warmth and humbleness ended the dinner, the event on a happy note. Hakuna Matata guys..keep doing the good work! Coming back for sure!! :)

I had visited Hakuna sometime back and found it pretty good.¬† Firstly, it has got its own parking space, which was a relief, especially since it is located in Park Street. The decor is fun and attractive and the ambience is wonderful. Tried out the Paneer Makhani Lasagne, and I must admire the innovative fusion food (it was my first time trying out fusion). I had a very enjoyable experience here and will definitely come back for more!

What are the three basic things that a food lover looks forward to when stepping out of the house for a good dining experience? We look for good food, good ambience and friendly service. Hakuna Matata does not stop there. They have gone forward to present themselves as an unstopping revelation of surprises. Especially for those who have waved it away at the thought of a Veg-Only place.

Hakuna Matata, situated just opposite to The Park, in Park Street, immediately catches your eye, thanks to the bright canary yellow sign board, fixated right above its entrance. With Coco, its mascot jiggling its butt on the board, you immediately get the fun and carefree vibe this place tries to emanate. But do not be deceived by the casual charm the place has easily pulled off. The food is no way near casual. A lot of brain storming on the part of the management, teamed with the exceptional ideas of Chef Chanchal has gone into creating some of the most impressive dishes. A big thank you to the management for inviting us and allowing us to enjoy this experience called Hakuna Matata.

FOOD SWAG

We started off with the food tasting with a considerable number of the top grossing beverages served at the eatery. We moved onto to the appetisers and soon met the sweet end with lip smacking deserts. We tasted-

1)¬†¬† ¬†Matata Cooler-

The Matata Cooler is a house speciality and goes down exceedingly well with the ladies. The beverage comprises of tender coconut water as its base, mixed beautifully with fresh watermelon juice and crushed mint. The first sip is almost an explosion of fresh flavours in your mouth. Apart from the mentioned elements the touch of lime juice in the beverage in the drink is prominent. The drink is served in a bulb, set on a carved piece of watermelon shell. The garnish comprises of fresh water melon balls and lemon ring skewers. Highly Recommended.

2)¬†¬† ¬†Ginger Blaster-

The second mocktail served at the table was the Ginger Blaster. The drink is served in short, whisky glasses, rimmed with a punchy chat masala. It comes in a kettle with escaping smoke, obviously a lot of liquid nitrogen action going on here. Never drink it with a straw, you lose the whole Shikanji touch otherwise. The drink, as the name suggests is a ginger based drink, with the right balance of sweet, gingery and spicy flavours.

3)¬†¬† ¬†Orange Mojito-

For people who like orange pop, this drink just escalates it by quite a few notches. Following the basics of a good Mojito the Orange Mohito comes stashed with prominent minty and lemon flavours.

4)¬†¬† ¬†The Booze factor-

For people who like their cocktails more than anything else, Hakuna Matata has some of the best option for you. Cheers & Beers (Served with orange jello), African Sunset, Blue Ocean, Green Valley and Crystal Lady are some of the best and highly grossing cocktails at HM.

5)¬†¬† ¬†Crunchy Fried Bharwan Bhindi-

For a person who detests, even the thought of Bindi, I absolutely fell in love with this one, and so did the team. We went in for seconds and thirds, it was just impossible to give up. The Bhindi is stuffed with some lip smacking masala and tenderly coated with bread crumbs and fried to its golden best. It is paired with a green mango relish and blue cheese mayonnaise, which are equally mouth watering.

6)¬†¬† ¬†Pita Naan Pakora-

The pita naan pakora is a brilliant take on Mediterranean flavours, camouflaged as an Indian appetizer. Crispy fried chick pea patty is wrapped in pita pocket and served alongside red and green chutney.
Some other very promising and popular appetizers on offer, include- the Mini Baked Crostini, Pizza Potato Fries and Polenta Stuffed baked Mushroom.

7)¬†¬† ¬†Nolen Gurer Cheese Cake-

This is sheer holiness spread on a plate. There is no better way that I could have expected to end the evening than this beautifully spread plate of Nolen Gur Cheese Cake. The baked cheese cook is accompanied by a mouth watering nolen gur caramel and a hint of berry compote.

8)¬†¬† ¬†Flame of Fame Mocha Mousse-

As if the flavours were not enough, Chef Chanchal went forward and put a bit of theatricals into this dish as well. The smooth and decadent Mocha Mousse is served in a glass with some wonderful crumb at the bottom and a perfectly tempered chocolate disk on top. Pour the accompanied hot chocolate sauce on the chocolate disk, to watch it succumb to the heat and melt away into a puddle of chocolate.
I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and innovation put forward by Hakuna Matata and can‚Äôt wait to make my next visit.

WHY HAKUNA MATATA?

Here is a short peak into a never ending list of things that have worked for the restaurant and puts it on top of an undying craze.

ÔÉò¬†¬† ¬†You Won‚Äôt Miss the Meat-

When starting a veg-only place (strictly Jain food) Mr. & Mrs. Prabhas and Pallavi Dutta were all hands into the idea of creating veg-food so tasty that you forget about the meat, all together.

ÔÉò¬†¬† ¬†Smiling faces everywhere-

Right from the manager to the attendants, you see smiling faces everywhere. The great working atmosphere reflects in the service.

ÔÉò¬†¬† ¬†Lovely Decor-

The decor though minimal is nothing short of extravagant. The first thing that catches your eye, the moment you step into the restaurant is the vibrant wall on to your right, recognised as the memory wall with the wish tree. So innovative!

ÔÉò¬†¬† ¬†Lots of Free Drinks-

The management has all the notes on how to catch your attention and it does so brilliantly. Though this place has no happy hours (which as per the Owners diminish the value and reputation of a place- point taken), Hakuna Matata keeps no stones unturned to let you have a ball. Post their bar launch in February, 2016, the IPL season has been THE TIME to drop into this fantastic place. Every Six and Four from your native team earns you shots and drinks on the house. Now that‚Äôs reason enough to drop by ;)

Finally, the food served at Hakuna Matata is of uncompromising standards that has lead it to earn a wide base of loyal consumer base. If you have not dropped in yet, make sure you do so, soon.

Hakuna Matata. The name itself makes you wonder what this place could be. Everyone passing by park street must have seen this bright lit board of Hakuna Matata. Some of you entered and some of you passed by. To those who passed by without entering have missed out big time. Go now. 
Hakuna Matata is a south African word loosely translating to no worries. And it sure does live up to the meaning.
Firstly a big thank you to Prabhas and Pallavi for inviting us. Such lovely and lively people. They have given everything to the place and it is evident from the moment you enter. Smiling and cheerful faces greet you and instantly you get a happy feeling.
They have a official mascot called Koko and this adorable mascot is filled inside the walls of the restaurant. They have a wish tree wherein anyone can put up their wish and I heard that they do come true.
Every weekend they have a live band playing but for us they had arranged it yesterday. Such good environment is created on hearing the beautiful songs crooned by the team. 
For a weekday evening the place was packed in the ground stairs. So they are hitting the right buttons. We were seated on the first floor.
Before I start reviewing the place I must say that thanks to my father again I couldn't taste all the items on the menu decided. Thanks to shahbaaz I could taste the desserts and I have fallen in love with them.

Started of with their signature Matata cooler. Each of the mocktails and cocktails were presented superbly. Kudos to the bar tender who not only makes killer drinks but presents them in a very pleasing way. 
The cooler was served in a beaker and placed on top of a watermelon skin. Made out of coconut and watermelon juice this really was a surprise. Lemony and minty with the perfect mixture of the fruits and completely balanced. 
This was followed by the Ginger blaster. Newly introduced mocktail this has a spicy flavour. The glass edge is covered with chaat masala and black salt so having the drink with them combined is a real kick. 
I wanted to have the orange mojito as I had heard good things about them and this drink sure stood up to them and how! Sweetness and tanginess to the spot. Topped with mint and orange pieces this was a delicious one.
Then came the cocktails.they are a visual treat! The summer special cocktails had 3 variant and we tried all of them. Ranking them as my personal favorites.
1)Blue ocean
2)crystal lady
3)green valley
All the drinks are served in inverted bulbs and to keep them cold they are put in a really sleek glass which is filled with ice.
Then came my day's favourite. Cheers and beers. Who knew beer cocktails are so delicious. Beer mixed with shikanji, orange juice and soda and with a orange jelly on top. I can drink this everyday! I want to drink this everyday.
The last of the lot was the African sunset. Served in a huge bowl and dry ice vapors in the side this is something one has to see. Beer mixed with orange juice. Mind blowing!
I could try only 2 starters. The first was bharwani bhindi. Crispy fried coating with soft bhendi on the inside. Fried perfectly and most importantly drained of the excess oil to the T. Served with a house special aam chutney and blue cheese dip. You are rest assured that you will be licking your fingers. Then came the pakora stuffed pita with hummus. This bite size pitas have a veg pakora with crunchy vegetables inside and paired with a hummus dip.
I was dreading that the cheesecake of the day that was their on the menu would be mango and I wouldn't be able to have it since I don't eat mangoes. ( Don't judge with those eyes!)
But it was not. I could have the entire cake if given. It was a nolen gur cheese cake. Wow. Nothing else to describe it by. At last it was the flame of fame mocha mousse. It has a chocolate sphere on top of the glass it is served along with chocolate sauce on the side. One has to pour the sauce on top of the disc and it melts down to the treasure! Made with dark chocolate this mousse is smooth and delicious.
Hats off to the chef for such brilliant work.
To the entire team a very good luck. Keep up the awesomeness. Thank you once again to Prabhas and Pallavi for having us over. All the very best.

Right, so this took a long time coming. Funny that I would've been one of the first ones here, and had my picture on their wall on day 1, but as Pallavi rightly said, I was destined to have a grander first visit.
It was yesterday. I was a last minute inclusion in a list which comprised the who's who of the food industry. I can't thank Tag and the Duttas any less, for honouring me as a guest.

The Ambience here is great as most of you would know and agree while passing by a hundred times. But I'm going to acquaint you a little bit about the food here.

Mocktails:
Orange Mojito
Virgin Mojito
Guava Merry
Matata Cooler
Spicy Twist
Apple cinnamon

Salad:
Quinoa Rocket
Warm Chinese Casserole

Main Course:
Polenta stuffed baked mushrooms (awesome alert)
Crispy feuille papdi
Rice paper wrap (a signature)
Mozzarella cheese pizza
Indian inspired mezze platter

Desserts:
Koko lava
Mojito cheese cake

A quick word each on the items I liked.
The stuffed baked mushroom is a must try for funghi lovers. Its the owners and my favourite.
The rice paper wrap was a unique Addition to the list of vegetarian dishes I like now.
The pizza was just perfect, with a generous amount of cheese and stingy Amount of dough. You can make your own pizza here, but I like the experts doing their bit while I sit back and gorge.
The mezze platter was another unique item, in sync with the theme of fusion out here, where India meets Africa. Eat it while it's still hot.

After everything, what stole the show was ( No. 1 was definitely the awesome hospitality by Prabhas n Pallavi) the round of desserts.
I'm not a big chocolate person, but the koko lava was a bliss! Not too sweet, it had hot chocolate oozing out once cut. I liked the fact that the exterior was delicious too, and not smelling of dough like in other places.

Thus ended an eventful day. It was overall a Great experience. If I had to point out a glitch , it would be the servers. It's evident that they lack the skills and confidence, which is a shame. Hope that gets looked in to soon enough, so that they are in sync with the owners enthusiasm and zeal.

I wish the team all the very best . Keep being the reason for the smile on people's faces. Keep serving the society in the innovative ways that you guys do. And lastly, keep up that photography of me on your honours wall :D
Cheers! Hakuna Matata. 
                                          ...

The place looks amazing- its new and its fresh and quiet lively and located in the heart of park street. the decor from the ceiling is really cute. Its a completely vegetarian restaurant and has a decent menu spread. The presentation of the food and drinks are really awesome. However the taste isn't upto the mark. We had 4 things and all were below average. I guess we really shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

The place lives up to the name and is quite lively with colorful decor. Its easily located in the park street opposite to the park hotel. Interiors are diff with beautiful hangings on the ceiling. Decorated walls.

The staff are polite friendly and courteous. Table was well set. So all marks for that too. 

Coming to food. Nachos must try with diff sauces and avacado sauce was amazing. Papdi chat also diff and yummmyyy not too spicy but doesnt miss the tanginess.. I can have 2of them..
The paneer makhni lasagne was well done too and a must try.
Mexican rice not that great although. Make your own pizza was delicious with absolute thin crust. Loved it.

Definitely another visit soon. 1600 for two... So little on the expensive side.

Located at Park Street. Right opposite to The Park Hotel. This place has a great ambience. Purple back drop. Tiny details.. like those tribal miniature figures, coasters, drawings on the wall everything about this place is true to its theme. The food is good in quantity and taste is on point but price could be less honestly. Alcohol is on the higher end expense wise ( I mean you have oly right opposite to this place) Please please please introduce happy hours. (Suggestion 1) Please please please accommodate non veg food to the menu. (suggestion 2). The staff was well behaved and food was served with a short span so no complaints there. Very chill place to be in general.

Hakuna Matata is the one place I would love to explore once more. It's a cute little restaurant located quite visibly in Park Street and has quirky interiors and overall, a charming ambiance. Our server was very sweet and patiently listened to us discussing our one very special order - Nutella Fruit Crepes.¬†

While I can't yet speak for the rest of the food here, the Nutella Fruit Crepe was both filling and good. The entire dessert item contained four crepes with generous servings of Nutella and fruits. The presentation was excellent (see picture) and the Nutella oozed out of our every bite.¬†

P.S. - I love the name of the restaurant! No worries, indeed. :)

Loved the interiors of this place. This place was almost empty when we entered. We ordered a pizza fries, a cosmopolitan and 2 pints of beer. To our surprise, they added a risotto to our order. I don't know what kind of waiters you all employ. He just added it himself. The food was average. And the cosmopolitan was also average. It is a bit pricey for the quantity and quality of food is not so good. I would think twice to visit this place again.

This place on Park Street is quite nice. All vegetarian joint has a lot of variety and options. The one thing I really like is that it has a lounge/cafe setup but without hookah. That gives it a big thumbs up from me. 

The food overall was decent. The corn soup was excellent. The rice paper wrap was good but the saut√©ed veggies stuffed inside needed a non aioli dressing to cut the oil. 

Pasta was up to the mark and cooked well. The sauce was again slightly oily. 

The burrito rolls were quite nice with a tasty sauce. However the cooking of the burrito made the wrap slightly tough and rubbery. 

Desserts were very good. The lava cake as well the mocha mousse were highlights of the dinner. Both were excellent and pushed the dinner from average to good.

This place is located in the heart of park street. The decoration and ambience is fabulous. It's really eye catching. The music was good. The food we ordered were nachos, pizza and spaghetti. The spaghetti could have been better. Other items and drinks were delicious. The staff is polite. The service is really fast though. Highly recommended for vegetarians.

Adorable place with creative decoration. Ambience is nice excepting the loud music. This hot summer evening compelled me to order some cold beverage. And yes, ORANGE MOJITO amazed me by its nice appearance and good taste. It's a favourite thirst quencher. Then came POLENTA STUFFED BAKED MUSHROOM, connoisseur's favourite. Something very innovative to the palate. Mushroom with exotic herbs indulge my taste buds. The food was presented in such a nice way. But the quantity is small, difficult to share by two people. KOKO LAVA was another hit for the desert. Ultimately very satisfying and innovative experience.
Pocket pinch is high, considering the quantity.
Few staffs seemed to be new and inexperienced.

Recently went to this place in the heart of the park street called Hakuna Matata. The location of this place is awesome.. Right in the park street The ambience is pretty cool, a unique one, must say. They have a comfortable seating facility, walls are all decorated and not to forget, the onion shredders hanging from the ceiling. The food was pretty good. Not amazing but still good enough. More than the food, it was the ambience which impressed me. The staff were polite n suggestive. Overall a good experience.

I was headed towards a different place when this catchy name grabbed our attention. Being a religious non vegetarian I was sceptic at first but the cool decor and the luring display board outside made us take a chance and trust me, we didn't make a bad choice. The place hugs the lively vibe of the youth combined with an eclectic decor and scrumptious food. The menu is crisp but serves you just right. They deliver much more than what is written on the menu and excels in plating and presentation. I was awed by the beer based cocktails. Also a double thumbs up to middle eastern platter. I will go back for more. With

True to its name, this restaurant livens you up and is the perfect place to chill with refreshing food and drinks. I loved the flamboyant decor and the colourful ambience. We sat back with a Matata Cooler..which was the perfect kickstart to our meal. We followed up with Grilled Panini and Hakuna Crepes. I heart the way the dishes are presented and their delicious taste. The service is excellent and the staff very cordial. Also no really pocket-friendly!! They acquired their bar licence recently ...so would love to go back again for a taste of their cocktails!! Cheers! :)

I am not a fan of vegetarian food but I must say this place serves some really good dishes. There is a decent amount of variety and as far as the cooking goes, both the dishes I tried were cooked to perfection. But for some or the other reason the flavours were not suited to much palette. I found the dishes too heavy and something about the flavour put me off. I just couldn't like it!
I tried the Mushroom and Cheese tart and the Ravioli dish.
The mushroom tart looked really pretty and the tart shell was perfectly crisp and the filling was well cooked. Buy the flavour didn't impress me. I won't say it was bad, I just didn't like it. Ofcourse others might like it, but for me its a no.

Ravioli - Another really well cooked dish. The Ravioli was so soft and tender. Wish my ravioli was ever this soft! But then again the sauce was not to my liking.

The place is definitely very pretty. The staff is really courteous and the ambience is amazing. The food though, in my opinion, is a hit in terms of execution but a miss when it comes to flavour.
In saying that, I still would like to visit this place again and try some other dishes because I truly see a whole lot of potential here.

But did not reach up to the expectations.
No doubt the ambience and the decor were perfect!
The KoKo cheesy fried dumpling which the staff recommended was a disaster. Its sauce smelled horrible. The pistachio spinach bake was better and made upto the previous dish. 
We has taken a kiwi shake. That was the best!

Breakfast Menu launch at Hakuna Matata

Listen up, Veg lovers ‚Äî this is the spot for you! Ready or not, Hakuna Matata is the places for you to check out this month! Today Hakuna Matata have launched their breakfast menu keeping in mind the growing popularity of morning walk diners across the city, looking for new options for morning treats! Especially for breakfast, they have even tried to serve items from the ‚Äòdesi kitchen‚Äô to give a greater variety on the menu.
                                                                ...

Really loved this place!
We ended up here on the day of Asia Cup T20 2016 finals between India and Bangladesh without knowing that they had an offer going on.
We had ordered Constructed Nachos, Pesto Cream Pasta, Mojito and Beer Cocktail. And we loved every single thing! I am a nacho-fan....and this place has really good nachos, trust me! You come here, you should definitely try the Nachos! The pasta also was unexpectedly good! A little oily yes, and also with potatoes - which I have never seen anywhere before - but tasted excellent nonetheless!
The cocktails also were really great! The beer cocktail came in a mini bucket! I was just so excited with the look and feel of it! That definitely added to the experience of the cocktail. :)
And then suddenly the waiter came with 2 shots saying they are complementary as a part of their offer for the Final match. A shot for each Bangladeshi Wicket and for each Indian Six :D We sat through Bangladesh's innings. They lost six wickets in all and we ended up having an excellent time.
In the meanwhile we also ordered the Pizza Fries which were mouth watering tasty!
This place is a definite go-go for anyone! Good cocktails and great food...a good experience overall!
The only thing I find lagging here is perhaps the ambiance. This is the kind of place you'd want to go to have a casual fun evening with your friends, and not anything special. Maybe this thing can be improved.
I am a fan of Hakuna-matata. Definitely looking forward to visiting them again...so should you!

We were looking for places where we could go and watch the India vs Pakistan match as we were unable to lay our hands on the ticket. One of our friends from Kolkata mentioned about the offering at Hakuna Matata. Apparently, they were inaugarating their cocktail bar that day so they were running this offer for the match

Whenever Indian hits a six or takes a Pakistani wicket, free shots on the house. They were also serving beer @ 120 and 1+1 on the breezers. Fair enough deal.

We reached the place at 7 PM and lucky for us it was not full. We got ourselves good seats near the bar and started the match with some beers.

For food and drinks, we ordered the following:

1. Pizza Fries: Basically potato wedges which are baked like pizza. New dish. 5/5. Also, the servings were enough for 3 of us.

2. Hakuna Quessadillas :¬†You can't go wrong with them.¬†

3. Paneer Makhani Lasagne: Indo-Italian collaboration. Too much paneer I would say. Give it a miss if you are not a fan boy/girl for such collaborations.¬†

4. Cheers and Beers: Best drink that I have had in a long time. Good presentation with overturned bottles and glasses mixing the beer and the other ingredients while you sip on it. Quite refreshing.¬†

5. Chocolate Mousse with Tiramisu: This was the special¬†dessert ¬†of the day and awesome it was.¬†

Apart from this, we had a constant supply of shots. Overall 8 in all. 5 Wickets and 3 sixes. The place is quite chic, with good decor and lighting. As compared to the 1st floor, I preferred the ground floor as it is more spacious. They have a "Wish Tree" where people scribble down their wishes. Nice thing I would say!¬†

Regarding the service, good and prompt. Though it again took ages for the dish to be served, but once served there were no complaints at all. Presentation wise they were nice too. Some of the staff seriously could do with some restraints regarding their over-zealous customer service instincts.¬†

All in all, a night well spent with India winning the match comfortably and we being happy with the foods and drinks!

This is a very innovative place...and has got a very young vibe to it. As the name suggests you can surely be carefree in here. It is air conditioned with beautiful decor. The wish tree is just beautiful with all the wishes as leaves. 
------
As the food here is quite innovative so it's a bit pricey. The bar here is well stocked up. The staff is super caring and are always there to help you with the orders as well. As the food.
------
We had ordered the matata cooler, virgin mojito. The matata cooler was refreshing as soothing for my palate after a hot day of toil. The mojito had an air of theatre surrounding it. As this place is somewhat famous for its pizza, we ordered that as well. We chose our own toppings of corn, mushroom and burnt garlic. For dessert we had "nolen gurer cheese cake". It was sugary sweet but the black current jam served with it gave just the right balance of acidity to balance the sweetness from the jaggery. My friend has a chocolate mousse...and it was mamma Mia!! Just amazing!! The dark sinful chocolates just melt in your mouth. it was full on theatre.
I am in love with this place and their presentation of food. Will visit it sometime soon.
Cheers!!

The d√©cor is very cool. This place has a very different feel. The food is all veg and quite good. The quantity doesn't match the prices. It's good if you're in a mood to splurge. The staff , however, are really friendly. And the bill comes in a small caravan... That's so cool! It's a quirky place ( I didn't like their Virgin mojito cheesecake).

Make your own pizzas or choose from the many others on your dinner mat cum menu, truly engrossing. Mocktails are served like long lost treasures, the presentation gives pleasure.

Burritos are wow...

Guess the music could be kept a little low since the people around are loud too...

They serve food in such a magnificent way, that you can't help but CLICK before digging in. My order included Virgin Mojito, Guava Mary, Spinach Cannelloni and Grilled Panini.
Both the drinks were fresh and up to the mark.
The Grilled Panini was not that great ; I loved the Spinach Cannelloni, the cheese melted so softly in my mouth, the filling was amazing and left me wanting more!üòÅ
Surely gonna hit it again, to explore more optionsüòä

First visit and their veg pizza managed to capture the heart of a non-veg lover enough to ensure that there will be more visits and updates on this review.
I'm finding it hard to describe the ambiance in one word because its just that good. Loved the decors. They have a board on wall which displays the newspaper clips mentioning the restaurant.
Its refreshing. They give the bill in the basket of a mini bicycle which I found cute.
But the waiters seemed pretty preoccupied with themselves but managed to give the customers attention surprisingly.
Finally coming to the food, I'm a non-veg pizza lover but wanted to try their veg one. And I was not disappointed. It was amazing and left me wanting more. Really hope they wouldn't stop being generous with the toppings bcuz ones a place becomes pretty famous, they stop being generous with the quantity.
Will be visiting the place again to explore rest of the menu.

After all that hard work shopping in nearby markets and malls, don't flush your efforts down the drain and spend your calories on fatty food. Instead, head over to Park Street and eat your way to a healthier you. Hakuna Matata situated right across the Oxford Book Store and allows you to enjoy a hard-earned respite.

Say aloha to the food trend that is sweeping all across the world ‚Äî vegetarian food. Not all healthy vegetarian foods are green, mean and downright tasteless. Hakuna Matata believes that there‚Äôs no need to compromise on the quality or flavour of your food when it comes to treating your body well. After all, green is the new black.

Step into this urban looking bistro, complete with beautifully crafted graffiti and illustrations of their mascot ‚ÄòKoKo‚Äô adorning the walls. Bright light and yellowish wall make this place look brighter. Sitting arrangements are comfortable enough. All you Instagrammers will love the beautiful ‚ÄòWish Tree‚Äô and innovative ‚ÄòHanging Statues‚Äô.

Allow their knowledgeable, warm staff to take you through the unique but not so difficult-to-define menu, which focuses on traditional techniques such as salting, curing, brining and grilling. Leave all preconceptions at the door, almost nothing you get will be what you expect! Hakuna Matata stands for more than just food. It endeavors to provide a whole new culinary experience to people, with a pinch of adventure and a dash of fun.

We started off with Quinoa Rocket Salad and Warm Chinese Casserole Salad accompanied with six mocktails Orange Mojito, Virgin Mojito, Guava Mary, Matata Cooler, Spicy Twist and Apple Cinnamon.

For a satisfying veggie start up, we dig into their Quinoa Rocket Salad, organic rocket leaves with a gratifying crunch, served with quinoa, zucchini, assorted vegetable with cucumber and sprinkled olive, olive oil and tomato, best paired with the pomegranate yoghurt dips. Alternatively, the Warm Chinese Casserole Salad boats clean flavours, with skillfully garnished by fried noodles accompanied with Szechuan sauce. Of the dips, the pomegranate yoghurt and the Szechuan sauce were simply irresistible. Extremely appetizing and healthy salads, the show-stoppers of both salads were its fresh ingredients.

In mocktails I especially liked to mention Orange Mojito, Guava Mary, Matata Cooler, Spicy Twist and Apple Cinnamon. Virgin Mojito‚Äôs taste was also awesome but it‚Äôs too common to talk about. Matata Cooler was heart pleasing - a blend of watermelon, coconut water and mint leaves that works as a perfect detox drink. Guava Mary was a mixture of Guava juice and special Hakuna Matata seasoning mix, definitely reboot your palate. Spicy Twist was another crowd pleaser - pineapple juice mixed with Hakuna Matata‚Äôs magical drink. Apple Cinnamon was perfectly blended and it‚Äôs a natural detox drink to boost your metabolism. Orange Mojito was one more perfect drink which will play tricks with your tongue, made with fresh muddled oranges, lime and mint; it will protect you against premature ageing. These energizing, healthy mocktails were great accompany for a mid-day lunch, or alternatively,

For mains, we tried Polenta Stuffed Baked Mushroom, Crispy Feuille Papdi, Rice Paper Wraps, Pizza and Indian Inspired Mezze Platter.

For a satisfying vegetarian option, dig into their Polenta Stuffed Baked Mushroom, use of magical herbs gave this dish a gratifying twist, served on top of sliced tomato and finely baked mushrooms filled with polenta and sprinkled with olive oil best paired with finely prepared herb & cheese dip. Certainly try out their polenta stuffed baked mushroom as their Polenta had a really creamy texture, an exceptionally luscious dish that imparts a ton of flavour without being heavy.

Alternatively, the Crispy Feuille Papdi boosts clean flavours, with skillfully prepared crispy feuille papdi, layered with tender cilantro potato, a refreshing mix of salad, curd, bhjia and a hint of flavourful tamarind glaze topped with cherry tomato. The Crispy Feuille Papdi was another must-order you should share; this dish will stimulate your palate sense, and you will felt you are right into the ocean of flavours.

If a straightforward bland Rice Paper Wraps is what you're after, the tasty, classic Hakuna Matata‚Äôs Rice Paper Wraps slathered with coriander aioli on pan saut√© vegetables in ginger is sure to satisfy. Grab the veg mayonnaise for dipping that lovely rice paper wraps in. Wash it all down with Matata Cooler freshly pressed watermelon juice with coconut water from Hakuna Matata.

Though Hakuna Matata is not famous for Pizza but I found, seemingly envelope the toppings, the pizzas here were all about that airy, chewy crust. Yet somehow, its center was thin and topped with fresh, high quality ingredients and if you like traditional or fusion toppings, you're at the right place. Go with a hearty appetite because you won't want to miss their tomato and basil Pizza. You can be sure that these pizzas will hit the spot without burning holes in your pockets, saving you some cash to spend on some excellent healthy mocktails.

Middle Eastern Mezze Platter got the perfect Indian touch at Hakuna Matata. Indian Inspired Mezze Platter was the most value-for-money item on the menu; it could be served as an appetizer, as well as it could be as satisfying as lunch or dinner. Considering the generous bits and bites it‚Äôs a one order finish your meal kind of dish. It comes with Began Bharta, Dal Pokora, Chana Masala, Humus, Mix Vegetables, Raita, Cucumber Salad & Desi Lachha! The Chana Masala with Humus and Desi Lachha was extremely tasty and flavourful, with fresh, slightly charred Began Bharta adorning the dish.

For Desserts we had Mojito Cheese cake, Koko Lava cake and Three Layered Mousse Cake.

Mojito Cheese cake - enjoy the toothsome contrast between the oozing savory mascarpone cheese with mint flavor and sweetness of muscovado sugar & almond served along with a small cup of virgin Mojito as palate cleanser. Coupled with Hakuna Matata‚Äôs solid line-up of tapas, this luscious signature dessert was impossible to resist. It's paired with the freshly made virgin Mojito (a match made in heaven) that's refreshing and light on the palate, brilliant in keeping this dessert from being too heavy and monotonous. So sinful, yet so comforting and satisfying.

This saliva-inducing dessert had become synonymous with this place‚Äôs ambiance and even after seeing it again and again everywhere on social media, it still never fails to tempt even the most regular of diners. The food here was splendid, but the dish that really takes the cake (ha!) was the Koko Lava Cake. It‚Äôs simple, really. Think lush warm Lava cake smothered from the inside with gooey, rich, melted chocolate that bleeds out of its cake mould at the very first incision. This one's truly a feast for the eyes and stomach, so get those cameras ready. This place screams date night!

Hakuna Matata also whips up stunning desserts like Three Layered Mousse, which you should most certainly end your meal with. It was a trio of Vanilla, Chocolate and Coffee combined in a delectable mousse. Sure to please those who have a thing for mousse and leave you wanting more. Three Layered Mousse Cake was light and refreshing ‚Äì the perfect finale to a wonderful meal.

Hakuna Matata also serves savory breakfast in their set breakfast menu such as their Desi and Videsi Tiffin. Best part is, Hakuna Matata opens seven days a week. With a reasonable price point, this is a great choice for a breakfast / lunch / dinner with friends or colleagues, or a Sunday night family meal! There‚Äôs no better place to bring your favourite friend or that special someone who loves fusion food. Finish up with an immaculate Koko Lava Cake. Don't even ask why. You and your date will be all smiles when you leave.

It is possible that we did not like the food as much because of our selection, but still I feel, it can be better. Once visit place according to me.

My first time to the place just after Christmas, there was celebration going around every where with New Years approaching..
Decor: It's a huge place with very creative interiors. The sign board outside is very quirky, the dreamy wish tree is outstanding, overall great environment. Writing down your wish on a stick note and putting it up is really a fancy idea.

Food:
Fruit Tea-Staff suggestion, it was very very bad, too much cinnamon.
Thin Crust Pizza-was amazing, sadly they didn't have broccoli mushroom for the topping, which was surprising.
Quesadillas-was the best I have had in Kolkata,
 Served with salsa and guacamole.
Aglio Olio Pasta-This was a lip smacking dish, must try, along with the garlic bread.
All the dishes were presented impeccably, but the quality served was quite less.

Service: The staff were cordial and helpful in placing the order. Service was very quick.
It's a Pocket pinching resto, not at all worth paying that much.

The unique fusion dishes like paneermakhani lasagne are a must try.The menu was a bit confusing and scattered and some were presented only if it was asked for. Nevertheless I liked the place and will definitely visit again for the own choice pizza.

Hakuna matata-- "No worries for the rest of your day". Located just opposite The Park, Park street. The decors, the wallpapers, the wish tree, Al were so perfectly placed and created such outstanding environment. We took the suggestions from the staffs for what to place an order. All the dishes were presented impeccably. Little pocket pinching but it's worth. Foods were lip smacking and delicious. We had ordered for chocolate infused falafel, Constructed Nachos, white sauce pasta, Virgin Mojito, Hakuna crepes( strawberries and Nutella).

Horrible food.if possible I would give a negative rating.Went there after seeing it on zomato.Got food poisoning after having their pizza which tasted like rubber. Had to get both the food amd moctail replaced but still not up to the mark. I will never go their again and ask all my frnds also not to.

I was really excited to visit this new entrance in the list of newly opened cafes in Kolkata. The glow sign board at the entrance is really eye catching. As soon as I entered this most talked about cafe in the city, my excitement was turned into sorrow. I was just confused why it was empty. I was the only customer here from start to end of my meal. The decor was really quirky and something new in Calcutta. Staff were very welcoming and courteous and well informed about the cafe but not about the food. I ordered for a thin crust pizza as I was really hungry and a coke to quench my thirst. Pizza was thin crust but it was not crunchy enough to be called a thin crust as it turned soggy as soon as i finished 2 slices of it out of 7 slices. Pizza toppings were like someone bombarded it just to cover the base. Toppings should be neither less nor more. The best part was the feedback section. Along with the check, an iPad is given to give the feedback where the manager comes to know how the customer has rated. All of a sudden the manager pops out and asked me why I rated so poorly. It was really nice to this as very few cafes in Kolkata really cares about their rating. I am really hopeful of visiting this cafe again in the future and I wish am not disappointed like this time. This cafe really deserves to be the be the best only if few boxes are ticked out. I would request the cafe manager/owner to give the security guard a chair so that he can rest his legs outside as he is old enough and very cheerful to the customers.

Awesome vegetarian food and interiors. We tried the dishes which were recommended by the waiter. All the dishes turned out to be awesome. Spinach cannelloni was the highlight. All the dishes were presented impeccably. Although the preparation took some time it was worth the wait.  The orange collada I ordered was not so get though.

Hakuna Matata - Just like the name, the place is also quite different. Continental & Mexican Cuisine is served here and it's really awesome. We were surprised. Great Preparation of all the dishes we ordered and lovely presentation. A bit heavy on the pocket. We had a Classic Thin Crust Pizza, Paneer Makhni Lasagne, Mexican Rice, Spinach Canneloni & Arabiata Mix Sauce Pasta. Pizza was okay. Rest all was yummm. Only suggestion to the management is to improve the Quantity you serve.

The first thing which caught my eye was the great ambience. The decors, the wallpapers, the wish tree, all were so perfectly placed and created such outstanding environment. We visited on a monday evening resulting an almost empty restaurant giving us the opportunity to look around and appreciate the decor. The food was good too. We ordered assorted nachos, crispy feuille papdi and South East Asian noodles. The noodles seemed a tad odd to my taste but the other two were fantastic. I would definitely recommend it for the vegetarian people.

After a hectic final mbbs exam ,what we needed was this refreshing outing. Though it is a veg restaurant,  but I am totally impressed with Hakuna Matata in Park Street.  
We ordered Pasta Aglio olio,  Paneer Makhani Lasagne, Hakuna Quesadillas and the most unique of all is a totally personalised pizza . 
One can choose the base, the sauce and minimum 4 toppings which is a very  big positive point for a pizza-fanatic  like me. 
Though I liked the paneer makahni lasagne very much. The greatest of all is that it is a perfect place to hang out with friends .

Visited on a busy workday with my colleague. 
The inside formed kevlar to the busy business day though, with the all enticing creative, merry and youthful decor.
Special Hi5 to the tree whose leaves were 'stick me notes'.
Coming to the food we ordered cream mushroom soup and the pistachio spinach raviolis.
The staff were amicable and helped in chosing the dishes.
The soup tested unique, though till the end i havn't been able to fathom what elated me more the uniqueness or the taste of it.
The raviolis were decently prepared and nicely garnished.
While you can't say that they are the best in the league but considering the scarce options of raviolis in kolkata, they score well.
The menu chart read that one dish serves two people well however i feel the quantities doesn't live upto that notion.
And oh, they gave the cheque in a rickshaw shaped toy. :D
Would I gv them a visit again? Would be happy to.
P. S. Non veg guys don't be sceptical bout this veg place, I am a guy who starts with octopus steamed and ends with steak but I would still recommend it.
If you are vegetarian, just make plans already :)

When park street gets a new restaurant and dat too a pure veg one how can one miss it..having the most prime location this restaurant was on my wishlist from day one of its opening and it actually is a must restaurant to go to.
The ambience is lovely,the decor is fantastic , the service is  amazing and the food is really goodüòã
A wide variety of dishes on the menu all with a new twist, making them unique in its own way.
We had ordered for:
1) Koko cheesy fried dumplings-perfectly cooked filling and properly fried dumpling with yummy sauce..oh what a delicacy it was!!
2)pesto cream pasta- this too was good enough a bit less salty and bit more oily so this needs to improve a bit.
3) paneer makhani lasagne-it was really tasty,it tasted sweet actually so could had been more tastier if it were a bit spicy..otherwise the whole dish was perfectly cooked.
Though I had just these dishes I couldn't comment on what other dishes tasted like so for that I am really looking forward to go back quite soon to taste more of there yummy foodüòä 
There is a space crunch for big groups so that needs to be paid attention to.

Being a non-veg lover I get a lil bit skeptical when its comes to a pure veg restaurant. After going through the menu we ordered Koko cheesy fried dumpling and Pistachio spinach baked ravioli. I must say that both recipes were lips smacking and surprisingly delicious. The decors were beautiful and the staffs were sincere and courteous. Kudos to Hakuna Matata.

Dates of Visit: Nov 2015 and Dec 2015

Nov 2015: ‚ÄòHakuna matata‚Äô is a Swahili phrase which roughly means ‚Äòno worries‚Äô, and that is the vibe, that ‚ÄòHakuna Matata‚Äô, the swank new veg restaurant, aspires to create, amongst it‚Äôs diners. It is Kolkata‚Äôs answer to two long pending needs of vegetarian diners ‚Äì a) presence of a pure veg restaurant on a high street , and, b) a pure veg restaurant with quality fusions and international style presentations.

Situated, almost opposite ‚ÄòThe Park‚Äô, it is an attentively designed eatery with around 75 seating capacity, combining the ground floor and the mezzanine floor. Furniture is a combination of wood and metal. Seating is in the form of couches, as well as, chairs. Tables have thick table tops. The ceiling d√©cor consists of inverted glasses of myriad colors and patterns. They are placed in clusters. Flooring is tiled. At the onset of the stairways to the mezzanine floor, the wall consists of a ‚Äòcomments tree‚Äô, which has become the natural choice of diners to get clicked! Herein, a cut out of a tree trunk with branches and few leaves is pasted on the wall, and is covered with stick-on notes, mostly in pink. These notes consist of comments and wishes of the diners. On the ground floor, an open bar like structure with few bar stools can be seen at the end. But currently, it serves no purpose, as they are yet to get their liquor license.

The owners, Prabhas Dutta and Pallavi Ruia Dutta, are young, passionate, well travelled foodies by their own admission, who have travelled galore, and now wish to use their food and travel experience , in their hometown Kolkata. And this signifies the placement of bicycle, boat oars and trunks, in the restaurant. Hanging fiberglass installations of firemen, atop the entrance, signify their hardwork. The mezzanine floor‚Äôs border wall is wooden, and is woven with plastic threads, like the typical old age Bengal chairs. This is to salute Kolkata‚Äôs spirit and artistry. Last but not the least, their logo consists of a cartoon character ‚ÄòKoko‚Äô, which they use in their menu, advertisements, wallpapers etc. to keep alive the fun element.

Hakuna Matata‚Äôs menu can broadly be divided into four sections ‚Äì Jain Food, Food, Desserts and Mocktails. Both the food menus basically consist of ‚Äì nibble or starte, pizza, pasta, soup, salad, sandwich and main course. And mocktails consists of ‚Äì coolers, shakers, mojitos and detoxtails. Healthier options in the menu, also show the ‚Äì calorie, fat, carbohydrates and protein count!

We ordered - Spicy Sweet Corn and Tomato Soup, Platter of Fried Nibbles, Paneer Makhani Lasagne, Mexican Fried Rice, and, Indian Inspired Mezze Platter.

Spicy Sweet Corn and Tomato Soup: The soup was served in an interestingly designed big bowl with very wide and slanting rim. It tasted nice and spicy, and the quantity was sufficient for two people.

Platter of fried nibbles: It was a mayhem by design. It consisted of ‚Äì fried dumplings, vegetable wraps in nori, arborio rice and mushroom fritters, fried chickpeas and assorted dips. It was nice to see an unusual array of starters. Rice and mushroom fritters and fried chickpeas were really nice.

Paneer Makhani Lasagne: It was fusion dish of lasagnea in paneer makhani, and it was served with a curry scented baguette. The taste was ok, but the fusion failed to create any mark or purpose.

Mexican Fried Rice: It was nice and spicy, and was served with sour cream and salsa.

Indian Inspired Mezze Platter: It consisted of baigan bharta, lachcha paratha, dal ki pakodi, spicy hummus, mix veg raita and kachumar salad. It was spicy, but with balanced seasonings. Presentation was on a smoothened wooden plank, and pretty innovative. It tasted nice and fulfilling.

The staffs were young and courteous. The food bill arrived in a lidded basket, atop a black bicycle. Customer feedback was not taken on paper, but on an electronic tablet! Apparently, the owners receive it instantly, upon submission.

To sum it up, Hakuna Matata is a nice and happy place, filled with innovative vegetarian wares.

--------------------------------------------------

Dec 2015: ‚ÄòHakuna Matata‚Äô has started serving Sunday breakfasts from 6th Dec, 2016, from 7:00 am ‚Äì 11: 00 am. Since I had already dined and liked their food, it was an honor to get the tasting invitation for their inaugural breakfast.

As expected, the reception was very warm, and it was nice to meet the- owners, PR heads, chef and other staff. I shared the breakfast table with the owners, Prabhas Dutta and Pallavi Ruia Dutta. They introduced me to the brand new Breakfast Menu, which consisted of ‚Äì fresh juices, shakes, coolers, hot beverages, continental, Indian, and two combos.

We ordered - Sweet Yoghurt and Muesli Mescolare, Matata Cooler, Virgin Mojito, Strawberry Cream Melange Pancake, and, Videsi Tiffin.

Sweet Yoghurt and Muesli Mescolare: It was a fantastic mix of muesli, sweetened thick yoghurt and an assortment of berries. It was served in a martini glass! It‚Äôs a healthy breakfast option, and highly recommendable.

Strawberry Cream Melange Pancake: It consisted of three fluffy pancakes, strawberry sauce with big strawberry chunks and cream. The dish was drizzled with organic honey and mint. First and foremost, it cut a very pretty picture, with a lot of pink and white. It‚Äôs the kind of dish, that young hearts like to order to celebrate Valentines! It was eggless, and still tasted very good.

Videsi Tiffin: It is one of combo meals available in the breakfast menu. It consisted of - watermelon juice, potato and bean hash on baguette, veggie pancakes topped with baked beans plus cheese sauce and sweet yoghurt. The food - looked good, tasted nice and quantity was more than enough for one person. It was served in a metallic box with attached lid, the one that the old age students used to carry to school! In-box presentation was novice and amusing.

Matata Cooler: It was a concoction of coconut water, fresh water melon and mint, and served in a glass flask, like the ones, that you find in the laboratories! The flask top was covered with a watermelon slice. The cooler looked interesting and tasted nice. Please note, that this item is not present in their breakfast menu, but the mocktails menu.

Virgin Mojito: Mojito is something that we find in almost all the restaurants. So, amidst all the innovation and fusion, this one failed to catch any special attention! This item was also from their mocktails menu.

To sum it up, Hakuna Matata‚Äôs breakfast was a lovely experience. The menu is well designed, and pretty different from the breakfast menu of other Kolkata diners.

Unlike the name the place is uninteresting totally ...except the ambience and the mojito nothing seem to be good :( sheer disappointment the menu lacks description and if you a New visitor you'd be simply clueless as to what to order !!! Other highs may be for a vegetarian who has a very few options in the city can try this place ( make sure u understand the name of dish before you order !) umm another well the portion is good enough for at least four people to eat . Overall - Sigh :(

At the heart of park street among those bunch of restaurants , Hakuna Matata is one of the most famous and well known not only for its spicy Mexican & Continental food but also for its amazing decor and environment...
We ordered Constructive nachos from nibbles in starter ...
then in main food course we had platter of fried nibbles sharers which is full plate combo of different types continental foods like Fried Dumplings, Bhaji vegetables wrap in nori, Arborio rice with mushroom fritters, Chaat fried chickpeas & assorted dips ... this whole dish is really scrumptious ...
In mocktail drinks we took Virgin mojito, Apple cinnamon twist detoxtail... Mojito was very refreshing...
At the end we had Koko lava as dessert... this jst took my breath away... the hot chocolate in the cake and the little ball of icecream ... it's jst too smooth and lip smacking...
Besides foods the ambience, decoration , the background songs , the wish tree & specially the little cycle in which the bill was given was very innovative and nice ...
Only thing is this place is little bit smaller
Overall A must try for foodies...

Being a hard core non vegetarian, I did not think I would ever try this particular restaurant in Park Street. However, our 10 year school reunion was arranged here and boy did they do a great job organizing it. The decor and the ambiance was really nice (although we may have spoiled the peace and quiet by being too loud). They serve a wide variety of food, very nicely presented in little wooden platters. Their mocktails are also pretty good.

Located in the heart of Park street, has a cute ambience and a very fresh feel to it. 
 Loved the Arrabbiata pasta and Paneer makhani lasagne. 
Good service and friendly staff.  Undoubtedly  one of the best vegetarian restaurants in the city. Recommended!!

"Hakuna Matata" - Remember something??? Of course you do silly! 'The Lion King'...come on who could forget that?! :p

Coming to the point..this newly opened diner is every veggie lover's paradise! The place, its food, the warm hospitality, the people, the ambience - everything is suited to perfection!¬†

As a foodaholic I place this diner at the top of any restaurants serving veg! The food is that good!! Since I visited with my relatives we ordered 'Indian Inspired Mezze Platter'. ¬†It's a wholesome dish comprising of Dal pakoda, chana masala, baigan bharta (brinjal), laccha, mixed veg raita & kachumber salads (which was new to me). Every item (literally) cooked to perfection! My mouth still waters while I am writing this review! :D Everything is so tasty here even the brinjal bharta which was unexpected!¬†

All in all we were quite satisfied by this place and plan to visit it again on Poila Baisakh! To sum up our first visit it was a memorable one!

Thank You. :)

Review #50.

Being a hard-core non-vegetarian, I can't believe my 50th review is of a Pure Veg restaurant!
So Christmas unfortunately fell on a Friday. These days my friend eats veg for religious purposes. Now Kolkata has lots of great veg places but this is a new one, and located in a very posh area at Park Street so this had to offer something unique.¬†

-Decor-
It sure is funky when it comes to the ambiance! Extremely well lighted (even the floor has lighting embedded) with the non-alcoholic bar at the far corner. Cosy with well spaced seating arrangements; also has a floor above (albeit with a lower ceiling and minimalistic decor).¬†
The most unique thing I saw was the wall beside the stairs; it was laden with pink stickers with customers' wishes written on them; adds a completely refreshing zing to the place.
The restaurant title actually means "No worries" in Swahili, so keeping with the theme, you see architecture on the ceiling depicting young free-spirited individuals with backpacks on their journey.

-Food-
Their regular menu is already laid on the table. I actually wanted to try the baked mushrooms from that but my friend has some restrictions such as no onions, tomatoes, lemon. So they gave us their "Jain Menu" which didn't have garlic or onions. (thumbs up!); but even here, most of the dishes either had tomato or lemon. So very selectively, we ordered the safest item on the menu (PASTA) and one item recommended by our server.
1) PENNE PASTE IN WHITE SAUCE: This was a delight. The aroma and the cream made the pasta so delicious that we forgot it didn't have chicken. However, major con with this item is the weird breadsticks and the fact they don't have any provisions of adding mushroom in their pasta!¬†

2) STUFFED DATE FRITTERS: So this was suggested by our server and is one of the Chef's special but this was so disappointing that we parcelled it. No matter how well the garnishing was, it was just fried dates! Avoid!

After our last item, we were unsure how the desserts would turn out to be, so we skipped and asked for the bill. They serve it in a tiny basket on the back of a small hand-wrought bicycle. Looks really nice.

-Cons-
>Server was not at all competent. We asked him to check back with the Chef regarding making some items considering our restrictions but he seemed more confident than the Chef and also didn't bother to get back to us after we asked for the confirmation from the Chef.
>Even with all the decor, the place needs to be prepared with everything in the food department if it wants to succeed in the competitive Park Street scene. (the restaurant had plenty of tables empty even on a busy day like Christmas)

-Final verdict-
As a non-vegetarian, I visited this place as a compulsion and not a curiosity. So it really needs better advertising and word-of-mouth; however, if you're a vegetarian, do check other reviews from vegetarians on how they feel about the place.¬†

-Bon App√©tit. :)

Posted on September 12, 2015Being a hard-core omnivore, a pure veg restaurant is never my natural choice, and thus Hakuna Matata happened accidentally‚Ä¶ happy that it did though!! As you enter this newly opened place, just opposite Kwality in Park street , you cannot but love their colorful, casual and smart d√©cor, and yes that wish tree with sticky note leaves. They have sitting arrangements in two floors. We loved the Rice Mushroom Fritters and the dips do deserve a special mention.

Really really good. Luckily found a table for four on Christmas Eve. The place has a cool, fun vibe to it. Among the four of us we ordered the following-
Pistachio spinach baked ravioli- this was the best ravioli I've had in town. The crushed butternut sauce was a fresh change from the regular cream-cheese-white sauce. It was so good!
Stuffed date fritters- I should have clicked a picture because the dish looked super pretty. and it tasted good too. Loved the dressing. It was something different!
Pesto cream pasta- loaded with olives and capers. Good quantity.
Robust tomato risotto- yum yum yum!
The food looks good and tastes good and the menu is fantastic. Finally something new for vegetarians on park street.
Loved the food, would definitely go back many times again!

Cutting the '25K Kolkata Marathon Run' üòù short on a chilly winter Sun-Morn, I walked into Hakuna Matata finding that just 3 weeks since they have started serving B'fast menus as well...

Tried "Sweet Potato & Baked Bean Hash - served with toasted Baguette & Cream Corn". 

Serving was too much a quantity for one person with moderate appetite.

I found 'Baguettes' little too crunchy & rather hard...waited for a moment if the baked beans toppings could soften the 'Baguettes' a bit...but even the beans failed!!!

May be some other day I would try some other items before I comment conclusively.

The decor & ambience is superb...innovations are aplenty inside - starting from wall mounting to installations near serving deck to life size human figurines clinging onto ceiling & many more...even the bill comes riding on by-cycle (plz refer pics uploaded)!!! Simply cute & superb collection of interior decor element / concepts - whoever has done their interiors üè°üëèüëç

Price point-wise quite satisfactory a place considering the serving quantity & location of the outlet...

Stewards are attentive ... Free wifi (password available on request)...place's hygiene has been given equal importance which is evident  ...

Since this place is serving Vegetarian food only, garnished with such innovations - I need to explore more and surely look forward to visit HM back soon !!! üòÄ

Highly recommended...üëç

I along with my my some freinds went to this new place in park street on saturday. In  Hukana Matata the ambi was great and staff were very polite and have a smiling face. Wr first ordered chick peas falafal and is was worth ordering. It was well presented and dish was too good. Then we ordered brocolli bake and that dish was also very good. Flavours of herbs was exploding n our mouth. Lastly we ordered thin crust pizza and i bet this place will give Dominoos or pizzahut a run for their money. The pizza was one of the best Pizza  i had in recent time. Our overall expereince was awesome and this place is definetely having a repeat value and i strongly recommend food lovers to visit this place

Amazing Food..The spicy tomato and sweet corn soup and the Pizza is a must try..The staff is courteous..the decor is quirky..the food is worth every penny spent..presentation of the food is so satisfying.. The people sitting across our table complained about the toppings on the pizza and they got a free desert..too bad we didn't get the chance to complain.. As everything was just perfect..

A quaint vegetarian cafe in the prime eat street....Park Street. This is a comparative newbie among the dowager beauties(the grand old restaurants) of Park Street. Decor wise the ambience is interesting ...with some very innovative ideas,like the wishing tree on the wall beside the stairs leading to the mezzanine floor. But the food had its plus and minus points. The thin crust pizza which we customized was excellent. But the shared platter of fried nibbles was really disappointing. The presentation I felt was very untidy  and taste wise just ok. Didn't like the measly sauces they gave with it. The drinks that we had were reasonably good. But I. Felt it wasn't value for money at this place.

A perfect place to treat your vegetarian friend. Exactly what I did. The delhite friend of mine was overwhelmed and i was happy to find a place in Kolkata ( that too at Parkstreet) which serves pure vegetarian dishes. And trust me, the non-vegetarians will not be diappointed with the taste! 
P.S.- The giant wish-tree is a thing to remember! 
Cheers! :)

Outstanding decor and complimenting yummy food. This is a must try for Marwari families who are looking for a veg family outing. My son loved the decor and it was getting difficult to control him. A must try is the mushroom polenta, which was exotic. Salads were ok. The sweet corn soup was fab and a novelty. The fusion dishes like Indian mezzo platter and paneer makhne lasagne should be defiantly tried. The presentation of the drinks were very innovative .

Was attracted by the ambiance ... The location too is a nice one... but ultimately the experience was bad... 
Ordered a starter .. A main .. and mock tail... 
First the mock tail : the bartender after some dancing and throwing up of glass and bottle crushed a few mint leaves and poured sprite... The drink had barely any flavour of mint and tasted just like normal sprite.. 
Then main course came. .. (ya they brought main first )... It had 3 sause/chutki ... All three pain in taste.. not spicy not tangy ... All d same with different colour
Then came d started ... baked roots if I remember correctly... All cold and cooked skin deep. It was almost raw and cold... 
Over all real sad experience.. I have given d rating only for d looks of the place..

The concept of this place just blew my mind, such simple yet so interesting. The interiors just as the concept very simple yet you will praise it. The wish tree indeed takes away all the attention and one cant stop but take a picture with it! 
Mexican rice was so so but spagetti was lip smacking! Very nice and warm hospitality by the staff! Keep up the work. Would love to visit again!

So finally visited this restaurant today afternoon.
The restraunt ambience is cute.
Well coming to the food.
They have nice varieties.
We ordered  two coolers.
One was guava and the other one was kiwi frape.
Kiwi frape was descent.
But the guava one was so so.They had put too much jal jira in the drink which I did not like it much.
Coming to the food.
Firstly we ordered nachos.
It was yummmmyyy
I would rate it - 4/5
After that we had cheese dumplings.
It also turned out to be tasty.
And I would rate - 4.5/5
Quesidillas was decent - 3/5 
What I did not like was grilled panini. 
It wasnt upto the marks.
Only the fries was better.
If you wanna try different food..then you gotta come to Hakuna Matata once.

Now coming with bad thing -
Service was okay..not very fast.
The quantity was less and the pricing was little expensive

Went with a friend on Saturday for late lunch. Ambience is good, has a smart decor and is centrally located. Coming to the food which is specifically designed for the vegetarian palette is pretty good! We tried pizza fries, grilled panni and a pizza with four toppings of our choice. Pizza fries was cheesy and nice and kiwi frappe was refreshing. Quantity served per plate is sufficient for two. Good place for a quick bite.@

the food was out of the world. For once i dint feel the need to have chicken .
This place has the capacity of converting non veg lovers into vegans for sure. The Mexican Rice was the best i have had. ¬†We were 8 people and billed around Rs 3100 which is very well priced.¬†
the Mojita was ¬†out of the world.¬†

This is the best new place opened in town

I had been waiting to visit this place ever since I saw there "coming soon" banner. The name was a huge plus and I visited the place within a week of its opening. The place is beautifully decorated but is a little too stuffy. I wanted to try the desserts available since I was quite full after my lunch. Asked the waiting staff to suggest the desserts considering there was no mention of it on the menu. The only suggestion I got was the dessert of the day - the cheesecake. Decided to order that since I have a major love for cheesecakes. Was massively disappointed at the miniscule sized dessert that arrived very beautifully on a granite slab. A bite into it and my face fell. The base was too dry and the rest too sweet. My disappointment was rather evident I supposed because the manager came twice to ask me how I enjoyed my food. I left after paying Rs.270 for a tiny slice that I did not like one bit. Don't think I will be visiting anytime soon.

During navratris having a dinner for my brothers birthday we had to pick a vegetarian place and having heard good things about this place we ended up here. They had a puja special menu which was quite downsized from their regular menu but looking at the puja rush i think it was a smart decision.

I liked the decor of the place and the ambiance was good but i did find the seating a tad bit uncomfortable. The staff were helpful and courteous and the service prompt.

Coming to the food we ordered for quite a bit with nachos, mushroom risotto balls, penne in pesto, paneer makhni lasagna, pizza and mexican rice. Overall the food was really tasty and i liked the lasagna the best. For drinks i had their strawberry shake which was quite good.

All in all a good experience and i would definitely suggest the place to any vegetarian or non vegetarian wishing to have a go at veg food.

The bill was around 3200 for 7 of us which is quite reasonable.

This place is a newly opened joint opposite The park in park street. 
The place looks happy, with a tree of post its and furniture in yellow, the only let down- its a vegetarian restaurant. Menu on the opening week was very small, though they promised to add more stuff, but still - vegetarian.. 
I honestly felt that given the location and space, they could have had a better menu. Pumpkin soups and lattes are depressing. 
They have few coolers and detox drinks which are nice. And the management has gone OTT. there are dancers who would suddenly come down and begin performing.. Now if i am out for a meal with friends, i dont need people leaping up and down beside my table. 
The management visits every table and appreciates the choice of menu, it all feels bit exaggerated. 
The only thing which i liked- was the photograph. They have appointed a photographer who shall click your pics and share the copy of the same at the end of the meal.

Too much going on in the restaurant- i wish they toned it down a bit. And veg menu never appeals so i am definitely not visiting again.

It always feels great to visit a place which serves only vegetarian food. Hakuna Matata has a pretty decent ambience. We ordered Pizza Fries which was ok & nothing great. Mexican Fried Rice was nice but extremely spicy. Thanks to some of the precious reviews we ordered that without the chickpeas so it tasted just fine. Lastly we ordered mojito cheesecake which was tasted quite good. One setback was the extremely slow staff service. Also felt that the food was overly priced in accordance to the quantity they served.

Veggie friendly Park street restaurant is very inviting. Appealing decor and friendly hospitality. My mother had the strawberry milkshake and I the kulfi milkshake which was really nice. We had the arborio rice and mushroom fritters for starters which had more of a cheesy taste than the mushroom; yet it was good. The Sri Lankan delight we had rice and a curry was delicious, but unfortunately the vegetables were undercooked. The best dish of this restaurant was the dessert, mojito cheese cake in which you had to alternatively take a bite of the cheesecake and then take a sip of the mojito. This was such a unique experience and the sweet and sour taste was amazing. I definitely recommend it.

I have been to this place twice. The first time on a weekday and the second time on a Sunday.
The presentation of food is good but it took a little long time to get served on our table on both the days. Service is slow. A pure vegetarian place and the quality and taste of food is good. Recommended - Lebanese, Aglio Olio Pasta.
Their dessert menu can be improvised. 
Cool Interiors but it's slightly over priced. Location is excellent but parking it's tough to get parking.

Located right at the heart of Park Street opposite the Park hotel, Hakuna Matata has made the lives of poor vegetarians in Kolkata better than it used to be. Quirky decor (onion graters suspended from the ceiling), good music, very polite staff and seriously amazing food. Had the masala chickpea paav (way better than paav bhaaji) and the noodle broth (spicy but good). The portions looked really small to begin with but it was seriously filling! A must visit for vegetarians.

WELCOME TO THE WRLD OF HAKUNA MATATA. THE SONG IN THE CAFE INTRODUCES YOU TO THIS MYSTICAL LAND OF YUMMY VEG FOOD. I WAS IN NO WAY DISAPPOINTED BY THE OFFERINGS THE CAFE HAD AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE. WE LANDED HERE IN THE PUJAS WHEN THEY HAD A COMPLETELY NEW MENU IN PLACE HAVING NEW DISHES THAT WERE NOT THERE ON THEIR REGULAR MENU.

1) WE ORDERED AN ORANGE MOJITO AND MATATA COOLER. BOTH THE DRINKS WERE SOOTHING AND REFRESHING. THE PRESENTATION WAS ALSO INNOVATIVE

2) WE WERE ADVISED TO TRY THE SRI LANKAN CURRY WHICH WAS NEW AND WE INDEED DID GO AHEAD AND TRY IT. THE DISH WAS VERY INNOVATIVE AND FULL MARKS TO THE PRESENTATION. THE CURRY WAS ON A BIT OF THE SPICY SIDE AND THE FLAVORED RICE WENT VERY WELL WITH IT. FULL MARKS

3) ¬†TRIED THE NOODLE BROTH: WHICH WAS VERY TASTY AND SOMETHING I HAVE NOT HAD IN KOLKATA.

4) HAVING A SWEET TOOTH, WE ORDERED FOR BAKED MISHTI DOI. THE WORD TO DESCRIBE IT WAS MARVELOUS. ¬†I HAVE TRIED BAKED RASGULLAS ¬†AND MISHTI DOI BEFORE BUT THE CURD SERVED HERE WAS REALLY FRESH AND PERFECTLY MADE. ( WE ENDED UP WITH ANOTHER FREE DESSERT: THE ICE CREAM LOLLY DESSERT AS MY FRIEND COULD PLAY THE CONCH FOR 14 SECS ( CONTEST THEY HAD)¬†

OVERALL A VERY SATISFYING EXPERIENCE. I AM GLAD WE SPENT OUR TIME HERE. A MUST VISIT FOR ALL FOODIES ( ESP VEGGIES)

Hakuna Matata = "No Worries" (Yes, that's what happens when you enter inside)

=====

Location + Intro:

Hakuna Matata open's it door's at Park Street right on the opposite foot of Kwality Restaurant (Park Street). It is a pure veg affair with no bar available. I had visited it a few days back and was delighted to meet a foodie friend of mine here. 

The Ambiance of this place is chic and staffs are very courteous too. Hakuna Matata comprises of a mezzanine floor as well. It is welcoming from the outside and once you enter inside, ambiance makes you gaze in awe. Very well decorated specially the hanging glasses and the sky diving sculptures.

The menu card which was served to me was tampered and a bit torn. If you are coming to a new restaurant and paying a good price for the food, this should be taken care of. Though, after stalking the menu, i continued with my order:- 

=====

Beverages and Food ordered:-

1) Before i had arrived, my friend had already ordered for Spice Juice which was mix juice with some green chillis crushed into it. A different drink altogether. If you love spicy, you can go for this one. (Ordered through House Specials of the Day) #musttry

2) Pizza Fries - Apart from the presentation, there was nothing extraordinary about the dish. The pizza topping inclusive of mozarella cheese was sprinkled over some crunchy fries which took away its crunchiness. The fries were soggy which i didn't personally like. Just moderate to taste. :|

3) Mexican Rice - The rice was just fine. I had much better before. Too much of chick peas into it took away it's charm. Though, well presented. 
The dips served were excellent.
=====

Meal for two: 1000-1750 max

=====

Pros: 

1) Courteous staffs.

2) Moderately Fast service.

3) Pure Veg Affair.

4) Presentation is excellent. 

5) Quality food.

6) Hygiene is maintained.

7) Good Seating arrangements.

Cons:

1) Pocket pinching. 

2) High scope lies for improvement in Taste. 

====

Expert Suggestions:

1) Change the old menu.

2) Improve the dishes with respect to their taste. Mere serving fancy dishes isn't enough, it should taste great too. 

=====

Summary:
Food Quality 3.7/5
Food Quantity 3.6/5
Food Presentation 3.8/5
Food Taste 3.1/5¬†
Ambiance 3.8/5
Hospitality 3.7/5
=====
Conclusion: I shall come back again in the near future. It's a good feeling to see so many vegetarian restaurants coming up in the city of joy. There was real scarcity of it!¬†

Note: Unbiased review based on my dine-in experience.

Location: Right Opposite Kwality Restaurant (The Park) on Park Street.

Ambiance: I really liked the Staff Management and Ambiance. Very well organised and good crowd. Loved the concept of a Wish Tree. Calcutta needs something innovative like this. The wall sculptures really caught my eye.

FOOD: I had ordered Spicy Juice, Pizza Fries and Mexican Fried Rice. They've got to improve by MILES on their food.

PRESENTATION was superb though.

Spicy Juice: Ahha ! This was the Most spicy juice I've ever had. It's a mixed fruit juice with LOADS of Chillies . Yes! green chillies. It isn't on the menu. It was on the House Specials for the Day. #MustTry

Mexican Fried Rice: This dish was Visually Tasty! However Chickpeas ruined the taste. Please remove Chickpeas, they just make the taste flat. Else the taste was good.

Pizza Fries: Concept was good. But bad implementation. The fries were soggy before they reached the table. Needs more cheese and Pizza Spread. Something has to be done to remove the sogginess.

A Word For Management:
‚Ä¢ You've got such an amazing location and Decor is superb. Keep it up.

‚Ä¢Do something about your Menu card. It's all tattered and torn. A torn menu doesn't give a good first impression.

‚Ä¢Food needs a lot of improvements.

Else, All good. Hope you grow :)

Firstly this is an over priced restaurant....the ambience is really nice and the service was commendable...but the menu options were very limited and the food quality was not upto the mark..

Probably if u increase the food menu options and make it affordable...it should work for you.

Now, this is a pure veggie's paradise! The flavor of tomato corn soup is so instilled in my mouth, that I really support any further franchises to be open in Pune/Mumbai of the same. Green peas starters were awesome! The quality, starting with service, menu items and food taste and hygiene is simply upto the standards. This restaurant is situated on one of the busiest streets at Kolkata called Park street, which may create problems for parking as this restaurant has no private parking space. The ambience is fascinating, suitable for couples, groups and families. 
As a personal note, I would want this restaurant to add more options in the soups section. It's a must visit if you are a pure veggie traveling to Kolkata.

Had an awesome experience at this joint. First time experienced pure vegetarian Mexican and Italian delicacy. I must talk about their ambiance, which is mind blowing. Starting from serving water to presenting cheque was simply outstanding and unusual. We ordered corporate combo which justified the authentic taste of Singature cuisine they serve.  
Drawback- very slow service.
Overall experience was nice and very innovative concept.
Love to visit again.

Well in this Hakuna Matata everything is not fine !!

Poor choice in menu , long waiting time to get your food and then uncooked vegetables in the sides and the main broccoli burger which was as chewy as it can get !! A sheer waste of a lunch and worse it has caused a poor stomach bug for both of us who are there this afternoon !! 
A horrid experience !!

Visited the place today...must say decor catches the eye as soon as you enter. The wishing tree is a nice concept and certainly kept my 7 yr old niece occupied....service is nice and prompt, they gave play sheets for the kidz which was a nice gesture....tried their fried  snacks platter....was good.....then the usual pizza, pastas n rice...all preparations have been given a nice twist by the chef and it worked out well on the palate. The presentation of food was also good.
The stairs seem like a risky affair, and the management may consider doing something about it before it leads to a mishap!

This place had been on my list for quite sometime now. Finally we went there for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The interiors are decent. However we couldn't find a lot of variety in their menu. They had very few things to choose from. We ordered Matata cooler , Peach iced tea and virgin mojito for drinks and pizza fries and arbor rice and mushroom cheese fritters for starters. The fritters were nice. And the matata cooler was different. This place had a lot of emphasis on marking the healthy food on their menu. Overall an average experience.

I went to get some lunch with my mom and ended up on having some pasta.which is not fullfilling at all. but the food was delicious with fresh tomatoes. the only thing that bothered me was a small space and less privacy. the was filled with limited dishes. it was a cozy place. the idea of giving the heart shaped paper to make wish and writing on it made the experience special.

Visited this place in the evening,located at the prime area of Kolkata , hakuna matata offers variety of continental and Mexican cuisine at affordable prices. The pizza fries was a complete new concept and the burito roll was worth giving a try. The concept of personalised pizza was excellent and the quantity was sufficient for 4. The  mocktails were superb with exquisite presentation . the ambience was different and new and the service was friendly.

VEGGIES another good option to try for Continental, Mexican food...
A separate JAIN menu can attract many to this place who wanna try all dishes without compromising there food habits...
Another theme based place where one can throw parties and enjoy to the fullest if in a group bcz of which its a bit noisy place.....
We tried Starter platter, Soup, pasta and Desserts and everything was Delicious....
Quality and quantity of the food and service, all was excellent.... ¬†Will cost you a bit more then suggested here but its worth trying...
Definitely a Must try place Specially Vegetarians.....

Great location , the owners seem to be very interested in how people perceive them and they serve good aliolio. These three things they have going for them. 
The rest could use work I feel.
My feedback is this if the owners are reading. The black menu needs to be turned into toilet paper. Get nicer menu cards and try to put pictures on em so that people know how the food looks. We were 4 of us and none of us could make out what the menu offered so we went with aliolio which was good. Also the mixer behind the counter needs to be put up for adoption. It ruins conversation. You guys are serving veg food and with jain options, highlighting that would help. 
The service staff is very good and there are always people around if you want something.
They could be more creative about the drinks they serve.

Fascinated by the name and ambience my friends and me went to the restaurant hoping to have amazing food. But all we received was disappointed. They served us in huge bowls but the food portion inside was very little. The taste of the food was very average. Clearly, they pay more attention to the ambience than the quality of the food. Very bad experience. Not recommended.

I was SO pleased with their service, i cant even begin to describe! We loved everything we ordered except the pumpkin gnocchi. We didnt complain about it though. But these people really showed that they care when they realised that we didnt like it as none of us really ate it. They not only didnt charge us for the dish but also offered us a complimentary dessert!
All in all the place has a really cool ambience and amazing food. The mojito cheesecake especially stood out. Cant believe i didnt go to this place earlier!!

There are places which amaze you by there culture! Hakuna Matata was one such place!
1. The ambience- the ambience of a restaurant like that was amazing! The concept of a pink wall and the wishing tree was great! Continuously a staff member played the flute.
2. The menu- the menu had new and carried options! Kolkata offers you limited option in veg food! But HM gave you good healthy options! The idea of making your own pizza was well thought!
3. The food- The Mexican rice and non fried platter is a must try! I think the dips they provided with both were phenomenal!
The garlic bread had a sober taste and so did the rice wraps. The mocktails were up to the mark.
4. The service- If you're really hungry and want food within 5 to 8 mins this is the right place. The staff was prompt and attentive.
I guess this is more than enough to explain what HM is exactly. I highly recommend it! 

After the first review,  on my second visit,  i had a completely different experience. 
The food quality was bad. 
I ordered pasta with vegetables but the the pasta didn't have a single veggie in it. Moreover it was served at room temperature. 
Secondly we ordered Mexican rice which was actually my favourite dish there- but upto my surprise-the rice was bad- it was so spicy that I couldn't take a second bite. When I told the staff- They insisted on the extra spicy bit.
After a while- when we asked them to replace it- they just got the initial plate of food modified and didn't bother serving a fresh portion. This was really unacceptable from a fine restaurant like HM.

The one thing that makes me visit a restro again is the service. Dressed in yellow, the staff is very warming. Interiors and environment are loud. We ordered pizza fries, spicy sweet corn and tomato soup and a cold coffee with ice cream. All of it came pretty soon and very on the mild side of the taste. I will give it a 4.

We went for lunch on a Sunday and it was filled with family crowd! The servers were helpful... We called for a mushroom and rice fritters which was a bit to sour for me, though my friend liked it. We then called for a hakuna cooler which was amazing! We wanted to skip the main course... So we called for a hazelnut slice which was dry and bad :( what I loved about the food is the presentation!

I visited this place two weeks back and it was a surprisingly delightful experience. I honestly didn't think much about it before I looked at the menu. It's a fresh change from those regular stuff you eat at cafes these days.
The watermelon drink was however pathetic. They did change it (it was billed, though). 
My favourite was the baked broccoli dish and the kiwi frapp√© (Yum). It was overall a good place.

Being from Bangalore I wasn't expecting something in Kolkata to be so exciting to make me back to the place, but being to HM my expectations were proved wrong....definitely a place you can visit with a gang of any age group.....!!
Broccoli burger, Mexican Rice, Non-fried platter and guava smoothie....made my mouth watery till the last bite!
Red sauce Pasta was one heck of the chef's preparation which I couldn't have allowed my siblings even dare to touch....amazing to eat and barely to be shared!
It's very reasonably priced and worth the money spent!

A pure veg place in Park Street just opp Kwality restaurant. When you enter inside the place has its own charm which attracts you. The interiors are good and innovative. The staff is always ready to help you suggest you and make sure that you are comfortable and enjoy your food. Have loved there mushroom fritters. Was a little disappointed with the Broccoli Burger as they put in fried Broccoli and not a Patty made of Broccoli even it taste more sweeter. But overall I suggest to visit the place once for sure and don't forget to put down your wishes on the wishing tree.

Looking for a lunch place this afternoon at park street, being a vegetarian suddenly open the Zomato to find a restaurant nearby. Saw about this place, lots of mix and odds comments. Still we 3 decide to visit the place, and I must say THOSE PEOPLE ARE GIVEN SOME RIDICULOUS POINTS about this place doesn't show to us. 
Maybe some people had a bad time or others reason but we had fantastic lunch this afternoon. It is not a very huge menu but we had enough options to choose. We loved your stuffed date, something really I never thought or taste before, pizza was awesome some unusual shapes but totally loved it. In main course we have tried the polenta cake and tomato risotto which was really good. 100% quality food, the mocktails are totally matched with the dish.

Loved it.....keep rocking.....c u soon with more others. Cheers....

Had been here a few weeks back with a group of friends and wanted to write a review ever since. The better half loves pizza, in fact loves would be an understatement. Ask him to choose one single dish he could have every day and it would undoubtedly be this. Little wonder then that we land up at almost all places serving decent enough pizzas.
 The thin crust pizzas surely made his day.

This visit was long due and we were charmed by the d√©cor as we walked in. The colourful decor and the wonderful lighting add to the warmth and homeliness of the place. The bar is right in front and just seeing the bar tender toss and mix ur mocktails is almost magically n adds to the charm. They even have the cutest pink wish tree made inside to add the the urban decor.

Service is prompt and friendly .¬†We got the iced teas to drink. Both the lemon and the peach versions were perfectly made and faultless. :( The pasta's were excellent and staff was courteous. Would definitely go back for more :)

The food is great and is presented in a very professional manner. The veg menu  is good in taste... Satisfied with the food quality and lives up to the ratings.

TIP: Do ask the waiter/owner for special dishes as per your pallet and they can suggest some good preparations...

This place has been getting a lot of mixed reviews and finally today I decided to check it out for lunch. The interiors were pretty decent n comfy. Liked the huge bar with rustic stools in the front, the chairs, the ambience, the yellow casual t's and the table setups. They are still awaiting bar license. So settled with a iced tea and a soba noodle salad to beat the heat. Iced tea was normal like any other place but the salad was amazing. I loved the miso flavour and the veggies added a lot of crunch to it. Soba is a light noodle and was just al dente. Missed the kaju chikki though. Next tried the ravioli, was ok,could be better. The taste was amazing but was overcooked and the sauce though tasty was too thick, I didn't like the presentation so much either. I liked the menu and dishes, but the place its just pretty new and needs sometime to really deliver what it promises.
There were ample amount of staff and they really take good care of u. Specially my waiter Amit he was commendable.
Overall I would like to go back to HM soon after they get the bar license. Im sure this place will rock and recommend it too all fellow foodies..

Located bang opposite the iconic The Park, Hakuna Mata serves fine Mexican food with a beautiful & open ambience. The broccoli bake was baked well. And so was Mexican rise cooked with ample flavors. The pizza was crisp with a sufficiently loaded topping. The burrito roll was filled with good stuffing although the quantity of all was unimpressive. Te star of the show was Kiwi Frappe though. The green apple mojito was flavored well too.

A cute little place with a good ambience, the staff is good and helpful . the place is clean and doesn't make u feel confined in a small place. The food is good , even though the menu might seem a bit restricting but They have got plenty to offer. I wanted my spaghetti a bit customised and they sure did it after confirming it from me. The food tastes really good and has a very fresh feel and taste to it. They should work on their drinks menu as I felt there were not many options given to me on this . same goes with the options for the desserts and trust me they weren't quite enough for me and so we rather opted out fir desserts. The prices are quite decent and you should be visiting this place to know exactly how good the food is. A thumbsup from meüëç

The first thought on entering the place was 'Wow! This place sure looks great:
And the food didn't disappoint too!!
It is pure veg, but that did not stop a non-veg lover like me from relishing the wide range of food Hakuna offers!
It also has an exclusive Jain menu!!
Great experience :D
Looking forward to visit this place again!

I usually never write reviews but after going to hakuna matata I must! I had the matata cooler and the fresh spring roll. Was pleasantly surprised by the combination of ingredients in both! Unusual but definitely yum. Nice to see some experimentation in Calcutta. Please try if you want a break from the usual and want to tantalise your taste buds :)

A rather cozy cafe with cute options to create your own Pizza. This is the second time I'm visiting this place and I love the food - try the spinach canneloni or brocolli bake with almost anything and you won't regret it. Also, an additional plus - the staff is very friendly. Love the concept of new  dishes per week. Loved the Nachos.... Good job guys...

When first i saw the interior from outside i was very tempted to try food here....
Today when i went inside... VEG menu made me disheartened... Yes it is pure veg!!
But happy to eat something different and new....
Good ambience... Very good interior...  Good service by staff...
Food- tried broccoli burger... Not satisfied
Hakuna matata freezer... Ok
Platter.... Ok

Overall food was ok but different in taste....
i would have given full marks if it was non veg. 
But overall good place for trying something new in veg snacks.

Was torn between trinca's and flurry's.. Found this place and wanted to try it out. We were REALLY hungry after 7 hours of walking!! Then we discovered that the food is completely vegetarian. So, we decided just to go for some snacks and something to drink.

We ordered a green apple and cinnamon drink and a water melon based drink. The green apple was good, the water melon, while it was fresh, was not really that refreshing!

We ordered a 'make yourself pizza'.. With aubergine, corn, jalape√±os, extra cheese with basil sauce base. Thin crust. It was good! Nothing extraordinary, but good!

This seems to be a new place. The upper section is still not open for diners.  The decor is cute. Li'l girls would find it very pretty. I know, 'cause I was with one.. and she loved it :P

This place serves food specially made for Jain folks. While we have thousands of non-veg places serving halal and kosher, places like this are rare. Although, going green is not my cuppa, but the food here is still decent enough. Nothing to complain.

Over all:
Food: 3/5
Ambience: 3.5/5 (4, if you like pink)
Service: 3.5/5 (done with a smile)

From the decor to the food i dnt have nethn to complain about. The food is delicious the decor is beautiful and i am in love with veg food if n only its hakunamatata. The portions r quite less compared to price. The garnishing is beaitiful. Try n drop in to this place you will surely love it.

As we entered the cafe we were welcomed by the smiling staff.. The cafe was fully packed and the only thing tht i didnt lyk was tht it was extrmly noisy.. Comingto wht we ordered were cold coffee with ice cream which was good though i flt it cud a bit strong.. Next wht we orderd were spinach canelloni and veg pizza.. Both of which was great ! The waiters out thr seemed to b v friendly and in very high spirits.. They kpt on askng whether we were comfortable and whether whtever we ordered were up to the mark or not!

The ambience is good and fresh. Staff is hospitable. The starter was a mushroom dish whose name I cannot recall. Ordered a pizza after that, closing it with a dessert of chocolate browie. The starter was decent, pizza ordinary.   Brownie was hard and too sweet for my taste. Pineapple drink which we had ordered tasted more like virgin mojito. 

Major put off is the quantity they serve, which is very meager.

I visited this place with my friends yesterday... The location is a definite plus for this place.. The decor is good.. Neither very classy not very chic.. The ambience is good.. The food was well served.. We tried experimenting and ordered portions of a lot of varieties.. Pasta was average.. Pizza was good and we ordered a repeat but the toppings changed in the 2nd order.. Risotto was good.. Pizza fries was good too.. The best items for me were the Burritos , chickpea Falafel and Mexican Rice..

In the drinks kiwi mix was good but for me Virgin Mint Mojito was the ultimate one.. So refreshing.. Sad that when we ordered the 2nd one, they went out of mint and I dint get mine..

At the end, the owner sent us complementary red velvet brownies which were also good

A bit over priced.. A bit of things here and there but overall a very refreshing and a very good experience.. This place has it to become a very popular eatery in the near time

First the name - it felt familiar but i couldn't quite place it. Then the gentlemen at this nice bistro feel caf√© explained that it was part of The lion king that we have all grown up listening to. 
The food: very impressive menu. I loved the variety and the menu selection. However, between the two of us we could only order for a quinoa rocket salad and a burrito roll. 
The love for rocket literally soared this time. Great after taste. Absolute umami moment. 
The burrito rolls had a serving of four cigar shaped rolls with two dips sour cream and salsa. The dips were nice but the rolls were average. I'd personally strike it off from the menu. When you say burrito you've got to live up to the name. The filling inside the rolls were minimal. 
The complimentary red velvet brownie was well done too. 
The ambiance was as i pointed out bistro-ish although the pricing was comparable to a fine dining restaurant. 
I'll come back for more. Keep up the good work.

Hakuna Matata which literally means no worries is really a no worries place. The whole restaurant's theme is based on the theme of exploration. Bright interiors and lively music strikes as you enter the place. Fully veg and continental is this Hakuna. 

We had rice wrapped saut√©ed vegetables for the starters. For the main coarse we ordered Thin crust Pizza and Burrito rolls. These were accompanied with mocktails Guava Merry which was a spicy Guava drink and Matata Cooler which was a combination of Water melon and coconut water. 

The portions are good and the staff pretty cordial. 

All in all a very satisfying experience.

The rates for the starters were around 180 and the mains were priced around 390. The mocktails were priced at around 120 each.

Visited Park street with a friend today, and was disappointed when we found that our favourite restaurant did not have a single table empty. A few blocks away, there stood a new restaurant which looked more like a theme-cafe, and seemed very inviting. So we decided to step in and experience what it was all about. Thus began my first experience with this awesome place. We ordered for Malaysian tofu curry and Pesto cream, both of which were amazingly delicious and fresh. We gorged on the food, all the while enjoying the little Swahili bits included in the decor. The paintings on the wall, the lovely and off-beat decor and the courteous staff who were all smiles, throughout our time there, all added up to a great experience. Though the menu seemed a bit over-priced, considering the fact that the portions were small and the quantity could have been better, over-all it seemed like a great fun hang-out zone, apt for a Sunday brunch with family and friends.

Good place and very centrally located. The ambiance is good, but on a Friday night it was empty.

Everything we ordered was good especially the soba noodle salad. It was amazing.

What this place lacks in is the service, the plates which the had on the table were dirty and had water stains all over. Their waiters are way too attentive, every 5 min someone was up and asked if everything was OK. Finally good irritated and had to say if we have any problem will let them know.

If they work lil bit on their service and cleanliness I think this place should do well. For the food they serve I felt it was a bit overpriced tooo. But the food was good

A modern place that looks fun and makes you want to check it out. The interiors are interesting but too many themes are at work, repurposed kitchen ware, large hanging statues, cycles and boats, chemistry lab equipment, warehouse style furniture, cute work desk display, and probably more which I failed to notice in the crowd. A bad start for me as I had to change places thrice. I got wobbly chairs and the place was vacant enough for me to hop tables in search of a stable one. My husband and I quickly chose an interesting platter from the food menu but struggled with the drinks menu which is in fact written on the four sides of two small chalkboards in inconsistent format. To save ourselves the trouble we ordered the basics, hot coffee and virgin mojito. We were told our drinks will be served first and the food will take 10-15 minutes. Fair enough. The music wasn't bad but too loud for a little place. The trying to be too friendly waitress stooped over our table to be literally face to face with us and apologised for the absence of milk in the kitchen. We didn't mind a black coffee. The drinks came quickly and were both pretty good. Perhaps one of the best virgin mojitos I have had recently. We finished our drinks and sat waiting for our food. After 20 minutes we got impatient and inquired about our food from another waiter. He left saying he will find out. He returned to the dining area but didn't bother to give us an answer. When we called him after a couple of minutes he again said he will find out about our food. After a few more minutes our original waitress came, stooped over our table once again and said she didn't take any order for food. She denied telling us that our food will take 10-15 mins. She was unapologetic which wasn't very nice. We were disappointed and in no mood to argue so left after paying the bill sans the service charge. (Why have restaurants started to force a tip of 5-10% on customers these days?) The manager of the restaurant was nowhere to be seen all this time, not even to ask us why we weren't paying in full, which I think explains the slack in service. I wouldn't have bothered to rate and review if the mojito wasn't delicious.

Friday afternoon lunch during office hours

Food: 'Global'. We ordered the pan fried polenta cake, and 2 'sharer' platters: one fried and one non-fried. I'd call it comfort food if the portions weren't so painfully small. Ends up as not-so-flavoursome nibbles. Warning: The non fried platter was a well plated disaster. And please order mineral water. They serve hard water.

Ambience: This restaurant's only reprieve
Popular music mostly. Ideal for lunch with a bunch of friends.

Service: Really really slow. We got here at 13.40 and placed the order immediately. The last of our order arrived at 14.40, with individual dishes spaced over that one hour. Atrocious.

Damages: 1350 for the 4 of us. We didn't order any mocktails or bottled water. And finished lunch elsewhere.

Verdict: Not coming back unless they overhaul the menu. They have an empty bar, I'll be back for just a drink if they do get a bar licence.

Though must admit was a bit dissapointed with food. The rice and mushroom fritters were amazing. But indian mezze platter and pasta really was a dissapointment. So was the matata cooler.
But the staff were extremely friendly. The gave me a hazlenut chocolate dessert as complimentary dish for my dissapointment. Will visit again but avoid these 2 dishes.

Wow wow and jus wow... We came to hakuna matata after reading the reviews on zomato and first things first.... Jus loved the place and decor ... It's surely a breeze of fresh air on park street...( reminded of the new ages pubs/cafes in mumbai ).... On entering , we were given a badge with the Indian flag... ( a gesture worth appreciation) after waiting for some time , we were finally given our tables on the ground floor... Being seated, the owners sent us some free welcome drinks in chai mud cups....the drink was tangy spicy and refreshing ... There was tri colour decor everywhere ... Felt patriotic....sat down and ordered a handful of dishes ...
soba noodle salad( 4/5) ... 
Spinach cannelloni (5/5)
Mushroom soup (4.5/5)
Matata Cooler Mocktail (5/5)
Mushroom fritters (5/5)
Burrito rolls (5/5)
Chickpea masala paw (4/5)

This place is a must in your gourmet outing in kolkata especially on park street ( especially for the vegetarians ).... The dessert of the day was 1947 Desi mousse ... It was out of the world.... Good food ... Wonderful staff and good ambience .... We need places like this in the city ....

Hakuna matata is an absolute Veggie delight! Bang opposite Kwality on Park Street, the place has a nice, casual, fun vibe to it. The menu varies from Italian favorites, to Mexican regulars to even unique Oriental preparations.
My 2nd visit in 3 days, out of coincidence. On my 1st visit, service was a little iffy because of some system issues-which was more than made good to us by personal attention from the owner himself. Their strive to ensure customer satisfaction is really appreciable!
Now, for the food. We were a small group on the 1st visit, so we had the Bell Pepper, Tofu, Walnut salad. Soft (non-paneer like) melt in the mouth tofu, a brilliant olive oil based dressing with touches of garlic, well marinated bell peppers, yummy in short. Next up was the Chickpea Falafel, a not-to-miss dish. They got this one spot on with bite sized pita pockets, a matching size falafel bullet, and a dollop of garlicky hummus and iceberg, thin slices of tomato, cucumber. The finisher was the Tomato Risotto, enjoyable and delicately flavored. Last but not the least, were the bite sized red velvet brownies, moist and delectable.
My 2nd visit was a lot more fun with more people, which meant a lot more variety in terms of food. Service was also much better this time. We started off with the garlic bread-light, flaky, crisp and yummy. A good start to the meal, especially if you're super hungry :-). Next up, was the Mexican Rice, a portion good for one, mildly spiced and accompanied by sour cream and salsa-the verdict was so, so. We also ordered the Aglio Olio Spaghetti-al dente with liberal amounts of olive oil, fried garlic and herbs. Thumbs up on this one. We ordered a repeat of the Chickpea falafel, which was a little different from last time, but nice all the same. We also ordered the Green Pea falafel which was basically Green Pea falafel bullets served with Hummus on a mini toast. The verdict on this too was so, so, because it lacked seasoning. Among the winners was the Broccoli Burger served with a blue cheese sauce-crisp fried smoked broccoli patty with a tangy cheese sauce, a not to miss for burger aficionados! Pizza fries came somewhere in the middle-french fries baked with cheese, herbs and pizza sauce-nice but not exciting. The finisher (and a brilliant one at that) was the pizza. Super thin, with a flavorsome tomato sauce (hints of garlic and lots of herbs) and loads of yum toppings. If you're Ok with a soft, roll n eat type pizza, this is it!
Best wishes to the owners to maintain the fun, warm vibe and the yum food!

I'll start with the positives. Great ambiance. The staff takes feedback from every customer and pays personal attention which shows that they want to improve. Amazing presentation of the food and use of exotic vegetables. Use of chemistry like beakers for drinks stole the show for me. 

The menu however is not quite up to the mark. The drinks menu should be along with the main course. Maybe because they haven't settled on the permanent ones yet. I am not a person who is too fussy about the options but i feel the menu is too restrictive.  But no complaints as they have just opened up and are continuously experimenting. Hope to visit soon !

Park street needed a place with such exquisite continental food! If you love broccoli,mushroom and all sorts of exotic vegetables,this is the place to be.
But the variety of food is too restricted and the portions are not very big. The ambience is lovely and the people are very amiable. Very tasteful and a good experience.

Good place to have Vegetarian Mexican food. Good ambiance and cordial staff.
¬†Ordered Pan Fried Polenta cake and Kiwi Frape , Food was good but drink was too sweet full of kiwi squash.Option of food is less though tasty. Menu does not mention list of drink they have to offer. Zomato says 800 for 2 but I would say it should be atleast 1000 for two people.

Well the location of the place is great, the ambience is nice but the menu needs to be improved as the options are limited.
The food is pretty decent though the ravioli didn't turn out to good.
The service is nice and the staff take a feedback from the customers which is nice as it shows that they are enthusiastic about making it a better place.

You can't resist stepping inside this beautiful place , the interior is amazing. A wishing tree where you are requested to write a wish is an attraction. The waitresses are friendly and so is the staff. Glad with the service too.
I just had one dish named pizza slice which is french fries served as a pizza base with mozzarella and olives all over and it was tasty to the Y.
Must try üëç

I am in total love with this place. 1st things first - this cafe is in the place that the first Barista of Kolkata resided in previously. If that is not all that blows your mind - the decor and the ambience sure will. This cute little cafe is located right opposite Kwality Restaurant on the main road of Park Street. When you enter the place you are transported into your happy zone. There is latin american songs playing in the background ( dat makes u wanna groove ). There is also a mezzanine floor area and we opted for that. The mezzanine floor is also similar but more calmer. We sat down and ordered for kiwi frappe, matata cooler, burritos and the cheese cake of the day. The order arrived in due time and the spread was delectable. Special mentions for mocktails both of which just lilted our mood they were so good. The cheese cake is the runner up here and it is pure bliss. The burritos were very tasty too. A mention about the staff here. They were very helpful and ever smiling. They even told us the story of the brand and the concept of the cafe. The Its a perfect place to take your loved one on a date. And the price for all this happiness not at all much. Definitely going back there. Bon apetit! !!

A nice cosy outlet with delicious food. We started with the arborio rice fitters which basically were risotto balls. We had the foccacia which was really tasty. Special mention to the broccoli burger which was a first in any menu I have seen in Kolkata so far. The showstopper was the chefs special pizza, of which one helping wasn't enough. A thoroughly amazing dining experience.

The restaurant did not seem to be full at that time, but despite being a weekday we had to wait a long while before the food could be served. The portions seemed inadequate and some of the fusion was a little too forced.

Celebrated friendship's day yesterday at Hakuna Matata - our group was of 8 couples. Very friendly staff - a little different menu than the other cafes. I wld rate the food average. Wat I liked is tht it just does not concentrate on food - also came up wth some different ideas of entertainment , like yesterday a group of boys performed acrobats on the entrance of the cafe.. Clapp for the boys! I look forward for such cafes. Oh Yes! The desserts were good!

Drawn by the fond memories I have with it's namesake restaurant in Disney Land, Paris, my friend and I decided to pop in for a quick lunch. Nicely done up interiors with bright yellow chairs seemed promising. But it ended there!

Being a hardcore non-vegetarian, was instantly put off by their vegetarian options. However, decided to stay on and have coffee and some dessert.

We ordered their cheesecake,which turned out to be extremely hard, gluey and too sweet! Also ordered for some coffee and biscuit layered pastry slice (can't recall the exact name), that too barely tasted of coffee. It was rather ordinary and you probably find it in some local Sugar and Spice outlet!

The cherry on the cake was when they said they don't have Cappuccino!! On asking what they do serve, they sheepishly said," Hot Coffee and Cold Coffee"! I felt like doing some epic facepalm but refrained and politely asked for 2 hot coffees.

After the depressing, barely eaten desserts, the coffee came. It was way WAY strong, almost bitter, barely any milk, more hot water to gargle your mouth than anything else!!

The waiters will come up to you and sheepishly ask how you are enjoying your food, expecting rave reviews ofcourse. When we had something negative to say, he simply walked away, not impolitely but more of a flabbergasted look-like he couldnt do anything more! Proper training should be imparted to tackle adverse situations!

A thoroughly frustrating and irritating experience has brought on such a negative review! Caveat emptor!

It's a nice place with a pleasing ambience! Went here on friendships day and had a great time! The little efforts made by the owners (friendship bands and an impromptu picture) made the over all experience even better and memorable! Though the menu is limited, we liked the broccoli bake and pizza fries! :)

Well i went to this place with lot of expectations after reading d reviews in zomato.But to my disappointment i did not like the food that much service and ambience is no doubt excellent but the food wasnt up to the mark.we had date fritters which was the chef's recommendation but it was way too sweet. The grilled panini and butter squash ravioli was good but the ravioli lacked a little sauce.May be they need little time to get the flavours right but i wil be visiting the place again for sure..!!!

Yesterday on the eve of Friendship day i decided to try and experience this new resturant on Park street.(Hakuna Matata my favourite cartoon charaters)/Must say! Did not disappoint!! A classic combo of great ambience and food. I personally prefer non veg but after trying their mexican rice and starters, you wont mind being a vegitarian for a day:-) 
Quick service..top quality food..easy on the pocket..a perfect place for vegetarian lovers.We hope to see one opening in Mumbai soon!! Go Hakuna Matata:-))

No doubt the setup and ambience is very good.. Let us give them some more time to get the right flavours.. Even if they not, they ll sell good bcoz of the location. (Au bon pain is also doing good in park street :-P )ATB hakuna matata

A fresh ambience and a young vibrance. We tried chickpea falafel , which was nice. Italian sauce pizza was okay, the crust was a bit undercooked. Burrito rolls were good. Apple Cinnamon cooler was good, matata cooler was good, i liked kiwi frappe, which was on a sweeter side. The staff here were humble and helpful. Nice place to hangout.

The place has a cheerful vibe going with its name meaning "don't worry be happy".. Service was excellent..a lot of thought had been put in the decor..the platter of nibbles was v tasteful though a bit over priced..don't miss the Matata cooler, their signature drink..it was simply heavenly.. Menu needs more variety n pizza section should be more detailed..but this quirky lil place is a must visit.

Well, this is one place that deserves raving reviews all the way . Great ambience , great service and great food. Kudos to the management.¬†

Hakuna Matata is just a perfect gastronomic experience one can ever imagine . First thing you will notice on arrival is that, how warm and welcoming this place is. The staff doesn't leave any stone unturned to make you feel special. The best part about the place is that the owner personally makes sure that you are enjoying your time.¬†

The menu comprises of modern classics with an ultra modern presentation of global cuisine, price is very reasonable and quality is excellent.

Its probably gonna be one of the best place here in Park Street! A must visit! You will leave happy and smiling.

Hakuna Matata has a great, chilled out vibe about it. Quirky decor, courteous staff and amazing food. The highlight of the place has to be the all vegetarian menu. The crunchy broccoli burger was really nice. The onion rings, fries and the garlic mayo dip served with the burger were pretty good too. The polenta cake was the show stealer though. It's cheesy mushroom base was to die for. Highly recommended for all mushroom lovers :)
