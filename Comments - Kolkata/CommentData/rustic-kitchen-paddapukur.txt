Pathetic food, ambiance and music!!!! The foods was below average, the place wasn't hygienic and let's just not talk about the music. The only good thing was it's service. Name added to my blacklist.

One of the best place to visit for a pure vegetarian as well as jain food..The interior is just amazingly done to give a rusty look..
We tried, 
Lemon coriander soup which was just amazing,
In starters we ordered hara bhara kebab and paneer tikka which was absolutely fine and fresh..
In maincourse dal makhani, aloo udaigari, tawa vegetables is damn good...
The chatpata chutney pulao is something new which was even amazing..
The food in overall is too good..
Everyone should definitely visit this place..
It is pocket friendly and worth visiting...

One of the worst restro i came across in recent time. We visited around 8pm and entire restro waa empty. The look and feel is perfect but food sucks. Half of the items mentioned in menu is not available. There was no Chinese food no hot and sour soups sweet corn soup.. The starter is awful in taste. We ordered hara bhara kabab which had zero taste. Tomato soup sucked to the core. How often you visit a restro and come out after eating just the starters. I would not recommend  anyone to visit this restro. Its in my blacklist.

Nice Ambience and Good Food makes a Great Restuarant and Rustic Kitchen is somewhere close to that. I tried out north Indian and it was pretty good. Ordered Tandoori Aloo in starter and it was Mast along side lemon coriander soup( my Daughter loves it). Main Course was Paneer Khurchan and Aloo Kali Mirch both very tasty. Can improve on the bread quality a bit but other than that all good. The portion of veggies served is good for 4 pax and so the pricing is descent enough as the quantity.
Will surely visit again

Amazing place to be at. Celebrated by sister’s birthday here. Booked the place before. The service was good, food was great but can be improved mainly the breads. Desert is nice and the staff is extremely courteous.

Pathetic food 😷
Food was horrible no taste in it.
According to the price they charge there are a lot of restaurants that feed good and tasty food.
Moreover half of the menu there was unavailable that to on a Saturday night could you believe it.

Terrible first experience. We were very keen on trying out this place during the festive season and we were not satisfied at all. We ordered Chinese food and the quality was not at all at par with the restaurants in this price range. They really need to keep up with the food quality because this locality has many other equally priced restaurants with much better food. We did not try North Indian cuisine and I hope it is much better than Chinese. The interiors have been done really good and gives that Rustic feel. Thumbs up for that. Hoping for a better experience next time.

We ended up in this place all tired and exhausted on ashtami night at around 1 am when the nearby jai hind dhaba was jam packed. Even though this is a vegetarian joint, I had high hopes of a creamy daal makhni and paneer, but alas! We ordered crispy chilly baby corn, butter naan, dal makhni and palak paneer out of which the corn and the naan were good to taste. So you know where this is going. The dal was bland and low on salt. The palak did not taste anything like palak but was a green tasteless mess. Even if it was pujo time, the place wasn't that crowded so there cannot be any excuse for the bland food. Vegetarian food can also be quite delicious, which this place has got to learn how to make.

Food tastes below average and food takes longer than forever to come. Staffs were polite and that’s the only reason this restaurant deserves a 3 else not even that. Food was tasteless and bland.

Pathetic service and worst quality of food. Too much waiting time.
Went there with family and ordered North India where quality and quantity was completely compromised against the prices. When a paneer dish was prepared raw and served we complained and to suprize they turn a deaf ear. Infact they billed us for the same upon cancelling the item and making a repeat complain for same.

Guys do come up with better service, quality and quantity to take it long because you are surrounded by good competitors.

PS: Zomato now that the restaurant has got a poor review send in your best sales manager to the restaurant to sell your banner at huge price and give publicity. You got a lead Zoman!

I planned Sunday afternoon lunch here since it was newly opened veg restaurant... We hadn't booked the table as assumed it would be empty.. however it got crowded once we got in @1:30

Overall nice plc... Good interiors .. I guess it's inherited from the previous restaurant which was at same location

Coming to food we had order lemon coriander soup & Papad panner tikka in starters .. they were good but paneer could have been spicy more & it was fried panner not barbeque..

In main course it was pudina paratha & adrak ..mirchi roti which were good.

In sabzi veg Jaipur & aloo udeini .. Jaipuri was tasty but aloo were simply fried aloo with no masala.

Mocktail of day was -Black Mojito which was basically diet coke in Mojito... I think virgin Mojito taste much bttr then ths.

Overall good food but very slow service, guess they recently opened so cooping up!

Almst every customer complained of late arrival..

No GST till now as new restaurant but prices appear with GST only :)

Food was satisfactory, Ordered schezwan fried rice but it was damn spicy, have complained about it to the waiter so he went to the kitchen and came back after 5 mins and asked us to taste again but it was the same.
Restaurant is small still the service is bad, have to wait long for the food as well as to get the fingerbowl and bill.,
Even no time to collect money for the bill so at last I had to go to the counter and paid the bill. Also No cards accepted.
Not recommended.
