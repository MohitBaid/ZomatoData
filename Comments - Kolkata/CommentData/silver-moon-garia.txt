Located Just behind Garia metro stands a timid tiny eatery.
Ambience : quite shabby. Spacious. 
Food : max food in the list remains unavailable. 
Even biriyani or nun. 
We had to settle for Tandoori roti and chicken butter masala. Both of which were horrible in taste. Chicken was too hot and no taste of butter in it. We literally had to pay such big amount and fill our stomach with tandoori roti.

Horrible experience.

The place is really convenient. Its just beside Kavi Nazrul in garia. Though the place is small but has a well maintained ambience. Food is good in both ways quality and quantity. Importantly the rates are pocket friendly. Its a great place for a sudden plan.

Arguably, one of the most underrated restaurants in south kolkata, perhaps owing to the tug-in-a-corner location. No cons absolutely. All the chinese and mughlai dishes worth a try. Their Chicken Malai Kebab is parallel to almost none in town! P.S - Better avoid the veg dishes, not their forte.

Taste of food is okay. On spot table service is also good. But worst thing is their sitting management. If there is rush then in a 4/6 sitter table they approach to sit separate peoples. Really I Never seen this :0 they have varieties of starter. But try to avoid any rice. Rice is somehow tasteless.

Good quality food.. Speedy service.
Ordered chicken fried rice, schezwan chicken, chilli chicken,hot garlic chicken.
The hot garlic chicken lacked flavours. The portion of the chicken fried rice was less. Had to order 4plates for 6 humble bellies. The rice could have been less oily.

Located in the opposite of Kavi Nazrul Metro Station. The decor is cool, the quality was good, the quantity was enough, the waiters were ok, and even the order was filled quite fast. Just a bit costly. Like a little bit. It's not an "everyday-go" restaurant.

We never expected the food to be good..  we were expecting some stale and tasteless food as we popped in just to give it a try.   But the food was quite good.   We ordered chicken swechwan noodles and sweet and sour chicken..  both of them tasted good,  much much better than the pricetags of the item.  Tbh,  I loved it simply. And the pricetags are tax inclusive, which acted as cherry to the cake. üòç

It's located just beside the Kavi Nazrul Metro Station at Garia. Decor is nice and eye-catchy! But the staffs are very lazy and the service time is something which you may not like. Staffs don't pay detailed attention to the guests' needs. Portions are okayish and so is the taste. We opted for a Chinese starter-Indian main course mix up as we were there for the first time and didn't know which one they serve better and didn't want to take a chance! The Drums of Heaven which we ordered was nice and had the right crisp.

I've been to this restaurant for dinner many a times. It's mostly empty but this place is value for money. Their chicken momo is a must try. The size of the momos is quite fascinating and one plate leaves you with no space for anymore food. The Chinese here is better than the Mughlai. The service is commendable as the waiter will serve you food everytime he sees your plate getting empty. The ambience too is quite soothing.

Being a frequent visitor I saw its upgradation to its new avatar, aftr the upgradation I thot that there'll be a hike in the prices bt its wasn't like that, even the quantity was same. U should try this place if u like chinese cuisine, it is pocket friendly too.

Location: Just opposite to the Kavi Nazrul (Garia) metro station
Ambiance, decor, lighting, sitting arrangement: Impressive
Behavior of the staff: Average
Though the experience of the restaurant is above average, surprisingly I found it empty during both my visits. ¬†
Food: This is my 2nd visit here, last time I tried Chicken Chowmin and didn't find that tasty enough. This time I tried Chicken tandoori (half), it was consisted of 2 large chunks of grilled chicken with salad & a tangy dip. Chicken was soft, well grilled and tasty. The dip was very interesting, I found the flavour of Pudina & Coriander... and it was well synced with tandoori. Though the price was a bit high (150 bucks for half plate), Chicken Tandoori can be tried as a snacks. So from next time, after getting down at Garia metro, pay a visit to Silver moon :)

The worst restaurant ever ! Please don't be deceived by the decors and all that.  This place sells the most third class food. They charge 140rs. For one plate biriyani, and the funny part is, their biriyani doesn't even smell like a proper biriyani. And yes, it tastes like they have added "Maggie masala" in it. The worst dinner I have ever had. I would recommend people not to visit this place ever ever. There is no "zero" in rate. Else would have rated it Zero.
