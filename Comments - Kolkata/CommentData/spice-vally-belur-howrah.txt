This is a nice place and serve value for money dishes. I have tried their rolls it's nice and filling. They also serve biriyani which is not that hi-fi but average. You will also get chinese here like rice, chow, chilli chicken which is again good to taste and pocket friendly. Don't expect food to be authentic but it's nice enough to eat.
