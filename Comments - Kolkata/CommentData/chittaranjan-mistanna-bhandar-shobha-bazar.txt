When it comes to Rosogolla Chittaranjan comes within the 1st 3 names . Typical sponge cottage cheese with the right balance of sweetness . They also have "aam"flavor and "strawberry " flavor rosogolla which is a definite try out . Lot of people arnt aware of a sweet dish called "Madhuporko". It is a one of its own kind. There was an occasion at my home  where we had served Madhuporko and people still remember and have praised/thanked me for introducing them to a delicacy .

I have heard this sweet shop's name earlier also from my papa's mouth.But time didn't come to go and taste the delicious rosogollas.Then time comes. And today was the day when My brother and my father went there .The sweets papa took were :
1)Rosogollas 5/5 :The main criteria of rosogollas should be like sponge and it is exactly like that.In one word it can't be described .It was yummy,delicious ,awesome and many more .
2)Gulab Jamun 4/5:It was good.

To be human is the most important thing in the world. You may earn in billions and be famous in the world, but when you treat people with disrespect you lose your identity as a human. Today, I went to the famous shop for buying sweets, a child beggar of 5-8 years age came and asked for money. I instead chose to offer sweet. The poor kid was looking forward at it. I asked the shopkeeper to hand over the sweet to the child and he literally gave me a nasty response as if i committed a crime by asking for a sweet for the poor kid.

Its a Bengali auspicious day, its "Bijoya", and people deserve to be treated with sweets. Small kids who have no means of getting it have to beg. It is really a sad and unfortunate event in this country. However, people who sell sweets ought to have sweeter tone.

Never ever eat Bengali sweets here, because if you do you will never like any other place. I used to a regular at Sweet Bengal in Mumbai, but ever since I went to Chittaranjan in Kolkata, I have never been to Sweet Bengal ever since. Although Sweet Bengal is no benchmark, the point is that Chittaranjan is sheer heaven

Located near Shyambazar AV School ( a few minutes from Jaipuria College ) this is a famous shop for their rasgullas. They proudly announce through their signboard that they have been here since 1907 . You just have to put a rasgulla inside your mouth to be mesmerized by their long-standing tradition . It's simply astonishing. The shop is a small one & there is no seating arrangement. Highly recommended for rasgulla loving foodies .

This sweet juncture is known for  its famous Rasgolla. But I tired there the signature desert item Madhuparko. It comes in four variations, as Litchi, Mango, Chocolate and Vanilla. Not so sweet and quite different from Bengali Mishti Doi. But the texture is same. Prepared and frozen in plastic cups. Each cups costs ‚Çπ20. If you planned to have a Madhuparko as your desert.,be there before 7p.m.

Well, there might not be a single soul in the whole of Kolkata, who has not eaten at this divine mishti joint ‚Äì atleast once in his or her lifetime.

Faint memories suggest that I had last visited them more than a decade back. Since I live pretty far away from them, my visits are grossly irregular and I was pining to visit them some fine day.

However, I got lucky and a neighbour was kind enough to send over a bhaand of their sponge rosogolla ‚Äì as he was blessed with a son! It was more of a dream come true ‚Äì as I held that precious rosogolla bhaand in my hands!

Now, coming to the rosogolla, this is simply the best in the whole of Kolkata ‚Äì no matter how much you praise the likes of Nalin Chands, Balaram Mallicks, Girish Chandras ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ these rosogollas are the ‚ÄúTRUE SPONGE‚Äù ones ‚Äì much better than those of the other brands. You can squeeze them a thousand times and each time, they get restored to their original shape and size ‚Äì MAGIC!

Packing was very presentable and their prices are somewhat high, but pretty justified. So, just pay them a visit ASAP and dive into the sponge to experience eternity!

Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar of Shyambazar at Kolkata city is very renowned for Bengali sweet dishes not only because of its taste but also because of its quality, varieties and flavours. I tried few sweets here but which I liked most was rasgulla, sandesh and sweet curd. They also keep some snacks like samosa, kachori, radha-ballabhi, etc which also tastes good. The tastes of sweet will simply surprise you with its aroma and softness. The taste can only be experienced and cannot be explained. It is simply superb. Another such kind of taste I had with mango flavoured sweet which also looks tempting in its yellow colour with transparent look. It tastes juicy with vanilla cream over it. There are more than hundred varieties of sweet in the shop. They also take bulk orders for major events like party, occasion, ceremony etc and have special sweet catering services also. All generations like and appreciate this sweet concept. People are waiting and having this sweet by standing in queue especially on festival season.

Chittaranjan is a very old and renowned mithai shop and is always remembered when ever it comes to "rasgulla".They have been serving for more than 100 years and still it's all same.When ever we have visited this place,we have never opt for a third item other than their "Rasgullas" and "Malai Chamcham".Both of them have been their speciality and its taste is unbeatable till date.

Can't seem to get over how spongy and moderately sweet they taste. They don't overdo the sweetness and the sponginess of the rosogolla is a secret which no other sweet shop / home cook can perfect.

Bongs are sometimes (well almost every time) characterized by their love for Rosogolla and when it comes to the best Rosogolla of city of Joy, Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar is obviously the place. Whenever I crave for a perfect rosogolla I never mind to travel from the Southeast part to the Northeast corner just for the sake of he over the top Rosogolla! Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar is for sure Kolkata's best confectioner's shop for the round wonders. One of the Oldest Sweet shops in Kolkata and having the shop near Shobhabajar, this place is nothing but a heritage Sweet joint..

If you like light, fluffy and moderately sweet ROSOGOLLA in a light syrup, then this is the place of choice. MODUPORKO is another exceptional item which gives you the feel of ice cream and Misti doi at the same time. It comes with four flavours. All are delicious and none of them  leave any synthetic after taste in the tongue. Besides various sandesh are also decent. 
Situated near Shyambazar AV school area, walking distance from sovabazar metro station. If you are new in this area, ask any locals, they could say the direction, this place is so popular.
Staff behaviour is not always good and the price is on the higher side. There is no sitting arrangement, only for takeway.

I am not from Kolkata so I really don't know where this shop is, somebody took me here and I am so glad he did.

Its a small shop on the main road with half a dozen people working non stop to serve you the delicacies they have to offer.

It will be unfair to rate the shop on the basis of just one thing, but I can't help it because it was so damn good.

I had roshogullas here (Rs. 10/piece) and lemme tell you it was the best that I have had, period. The roshogullas were soft and soaked in the 'chashni' so well that it got us drooling for more.

Overall Rating: 4.5/5

I think this place has the best roshogullas in all of Kolkata or maybe India as well.

This is Kolkata's one of the oldest sweet shops. It is the quality of the sweets which makes this place so famous. The taste of rosogolla is sooo good (it is famous worldwide) and that of the sandesh (chena) too. I have also tried some juicy sweets there which are also equally good and one who like less sweetness may opt for one white sandesh green colored¬† in middle. It is located on a lane opposite to Maharaja Manindra Chandra College, Shyambazar. Sweet lovers my visit this place. Only problem is that they dont have any seating arrangement.

Situated on a lane beside the lal mandir near Girish park , this place has the best rosogolla in town . Everytime i went , i get the freshest rosogolla that ia still warm . The rosogolla ia really spongy and not too sweet . However i was once denied of 200 pcs of rosogolla durning the puja time . They say one person cant buy so many and they need to keep for other customer also . Their sandesh is nice and fresh too .

A legend in its own right, while people keep fighting who were the inventors of Rasagulla, here are the guys who excel in making them. Pop one or two into your mouth, and you shall keep yearning for more. Located near Shyambazar A.V. School, this is one of the oldest and legendary shop in Central Kolkata. Madhuparka, a sheer innovation by them is also something these guys are known for. If you wish to have something else, try their Cham Cham! Although a bit far away from home, but I do not usually miss coming here, if I am around.

I simply love their rasgullas. The rasgullas are nothing but spongy dollops of extreme delight. The moment you pop them into your mouth, it feels as if you are in heaven :D
Chittaranjan rasgulla is a must if you are to visit Kolkata for the 1st time & many more times. 
As this place is extremely far away from my house, I cannot avail this sweet shop so often. But my family ensures that every Durga Puja ends with Chittaranjan's rasgullas.
Today I tasted another sandesh along with the rasgullas but I don't know its name. It had a rabri-like texture as the outer ring and a tiny rasgulla embedded in it, topped with a whole pistachhio.

For me, Chittaranjan will always be the best creator of Rasogollas I will even have ! Situated at a lane near to Shyambazar AV school, this small outlet envelops some maaterpieces of Kolkata sweets.¬†
My favorites among their sweets are the Rasogolla, the Malai Bati and the Malai Chomchom. Everyone of them speaks of brilliance and the best part being none of them are sweet over limits. I recommend this place highly if you have a passion and yearning for quality sweets.

I would not hazard a guess on what Jesus had for his last supper, but had it surely been the irresistible Madhuparka, even Judas would have desisted. Thirty silver coins do not match the awesomeness of Chittaranjan's sponge rosogollas and the legendary Madhuparka. 
Sweets have always been a cornerstone of my gastronomic adventure. In fact, sugar rush is a condition I delightfully revel in. It's not just a sweet tooth I have, it's the entire set of teeth which craves for it. And who better to serve me than Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar. Serving Kolkata for over a century now, this institution has reached mythical proportions. Not only are their creations sumptuous, but they also leave an after taste. The craving never actually leaves. 
So the next time you find yourself at Shyambazar Street, having left A.V School behind, at the Bhupen Bose Avenue/ Shyambazar Street crossing, you need to head towards this sweetshop. Order a Madhuparka, and they come in four flavours, and the ritual for me is having all the four. Once you are done with it and amidst the daze, order for a couple of rosogollas. Head back home, carrying a memory of a lifetime. Sweetly tucked into your Bengali pallette.

Known for their 'mouth-watering rosogollas', their sweets are just great for a delightful dessert. Had their malai chamcham and malai bati which were simply magnificent. One of the best and oldest sweet shops in the city, I recommend this place for their Bong 'mishtis.' A die hard Bengali sweet lover must try out their sweets at least once in a lifetime. Cheerios to Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar for their treasure trove of gorgeously delicious confections, desserts & sweetmeats.

I've been eating Chittaranjan's mishti for years and every single time it brings a smile on my face :) Its famous for its rassogolla but plz do try the malai cham cham, malai bati, gulab jamun, and the pineapple flavoured mishti.. I bet mishti lovers will be delighted :) best in quality and taste! Also if you have some special purpose they provide exclusive packaging, which looks awesome!!

While I love the Sandesh here I must say the service is terrible. The salesmen have attitude and are rude. They don't seem to have respect for the customers needs. I wanted to buy rose petal Sandesh which was over. He said it's getting made and will take 10 minutes. So I did not buy the other Sandesh that was ready. As he realised that another guy jumps in saying it may take 15 mins so u buy what is ready. I said I am willing to wait for 15. After 5 minutes when I see another Sandesh coming from the pantry I requested that if they can make rose petals first. Immediately a third one responds rudely that it will take 30 mins. I bought the ready Sandesh n when he was giving me the change he slapped the money on the table. Really disappointed.

The only cute outlet situated at the junction of Shyampukur Street and Shyambazar Street, is home to the best Rassogollas of the city. The soft gollas surely are delicious and mouth-melting. 
The other signature item of the shop is Modhuporko which is highly recommended. The other sweets will not disappoint you either.

We have been there at 830 in the morning and helped ourselves to few ragullas few gulab jamuns and some chum chums beside other ones whose names I couldn't register while enjoying the delicacies ! All were yummy, Rasgullas were hot and so soft they almost slipped from the hand !

For me the name Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar is synonymous to Best Rasogolla that Kolkata has to offer.

The shop is located near to Shovabajar metro station on Shyam Bazar Street. Very close to Shyambazar AV school.

Try to reach the shop by 4PM or else on most of the days the famous chittaranjan's soft, sweet and juicy rasogollas will be over. Although they are famous for their signature rasogollas, one must also try their malai chom choms, rabri and other sweets as well. It won't disappoint.¬†

Personally, I am not very fond of their another famous sweet madhuparko but still one can try them as well.

They definitely deserve a 5 on 5 for their Rasogollas and Malai chom chom.

Kolkata is known for its mishtis and each sweet shop has their unique claim to fame.For Chittaranjan it is their rosogolla.Undoubtedly,they make the BEST sponge rosogolla in Kolkata.I say this after having tasted rosogollas from all famous shops in Kolkata and around 30 not so famus 'para' sweet shops.

Another of their speciality is the Modhuporko.Its basically a cross between kheer and mishti doi.thick,smooth and rich creamy in consistency,its absolutely melt in mouth.They get over soon,so try to grab a cup early.Available in flavours like chocolate,mango etc.But I personally prefer it plain.
Sandesh like rose sandesh are also mouth watering here.But in Sandesh area the cannot beat Nakur.
So if you are in the area,ie,in Shyampukur street,a short walk from Shovabajar Metro station,just order rosogolla or Modhuporko and experience pure bliss

I don't eat sweets much. However I had packed small rasogollas from this place and it left everyone in awe. 
The next day, I tried another two sweets - Malai Chamcham and Gulab Jamun.
Oh it's so so so yumm. ^_^

Situated in between Shyambazar A.V School and Shyampukur police station (near Shobha bazar metro station) In North Kolkata, this small sweet shop catches all attention of sweet lovers with their unique kind of sweets. 

This is age old sweet shop located at the corner of Shyampukur st needs no introduction about their quality of sweets as it is very very famous among sweet shops in N. kolkata. I mostly like their confidence of making sweets when every famous sweet outlets are updating their varieties with growing competition, they are making their own,same sweets (no show off, no off bit using of colors on the sweets, putting no extra flavor) and year after year their same old sweets are sold very consistently. For this confidence and consistence I would like to rate them 10 on 10. üëçüëçüëç

I am frequent customer of their outlet and always I buy their best products. They have no so much variety in ‡¶∞‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶ø, I picked the best ones....roll on and Ros madhuri (yellow colour flavoured). These are very smooth,as you take a bite,it melts in your mouth. These age old ‡¶∞‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶ø deserve 10 on 10. üëåüëåüëå

They have a lot of variety in ‡¶∏‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂ class. ‡¶∂‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶ñ ‡¶∏‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂ and ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶∂‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶∏ are very famous,these are vanished in minutes. My personal favourite is  Pesta sandesh, chocolate sandesh and ‡¶ó‡ßã‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶™ ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶™‡ßú‡¶ø‡•§ These all are fresh and very smooth. They never sale even a sweet of previous night. For their all old varieties and mouth melting sweets.....10 on 10. üëèüëèüëè @priyabrata ganguly

West Bengal and Odisha might go on fighting for Rosogolla's origin, but there's no doubt that the sponge rosogolla was invented in Calcutta. And one of the best places to have it is not the shop of the inventor, but a close neighbour, Chittaranjan. 
Come here for their rosogollas, komolabhogs and ledikenis. Malai roll and malai batis are must try items too. 
But according to me their best product is Modhuporko. It comes in four flavours - Vanilla, Elaichi, Orange and Chocolate, and all are super delicious and hugely addictive. Flavoured desserts generally leave a bad synthetic aftertaste, but they have managed this issue perfectly.
Am not a big fan of their sandesh, but as far as  rosher mishti and malai and chomchoms are concerned, few sweet shops can compete with Chittaranjan.

We stood there with our  shaalpata'r baati, ogling at the huge pot that had our freshly made rasagullas. For what seemed like a decade long wait, (read 5 mins), we were finally served with piping hot pieces of amazing succulent little rasagullas that melted in our mouth like nobody's business. Ok I'm hungry now.

A word for the owner there- he personally explained how to eat rasgulla the proper way. Hats off! 
Will definitely visit this outlet again if I am in the city.

Visited this shop on Choturthi this Durga puja after reading an article on Kolkata's heritage sweet shops on TOI. The article claimed that Chittaranjan is famous for a sweet (whose name I can't recall now :( ) but it wasn't available so we chose Malaibati . At ‚Çπ15, it is a decent sweet. And then came the sweet surprise..The historic, the melt in the mouth, the oh-so-delicious MADHUPARKA.. We had not heard of it before but the shop has pictures of it put on the wall. 
Madhuparka is like doi but very unlike it..No!! the shop didn't pay me for doing their advertisement but then I would definitely urge everyone out their to give this one a try. I bet u can't be disappointed!  Although it's available in 4 flavours,I tried chocolate and elaichi..Both being equally tasty, I can't suggest any one! 
Had it been closer to home/college, I would have been their regular customer :) ‚ô• Looking forward to trying out their rasgullas, they have got the 2nd prize from TOI in the list of best rasgullas' shop in kolkata :)

As this place might have lot to do with 'spongy' Rosogolla lovers, I regularly visit for one and only item, Madhuporko (‡¶Æ‡¶ß‡ßÅ‡¶™‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ï), Chittaranjan's unique masterpiece, comes with choices of flavours - chocolate, orange, cardamom and vanilla-the regular one. Being a rasogolla lover, I dislike the kind of rosogolla they make. I find Chittaranjan to be much overrated for its rosogollas as their signature..!     But as I mentioned earlier, nothing beats Modhuporko (especially the regular flavour), a heavenlicious delight.  :-)

Undoubtedly they are one of the best when it comes to Rosogolla. Such soft, spongy and delicious it is. 
Every Time I visit Calcutta, I go here at least once. 
In their menu card, I have not seen Modhuporko. If anyone has not tasted it yet, go and give it a try. It is gem of a sweet. 
Now a days they have introduced a number of different flavours of Modhuporko; but personally I still love the old and original one. You can't give it a miss if you have a sweet tooth. 
This sweet shop is highly recommendable. 

P.S. We even order Rosogolla from here during any family event and not for a single time they have disappointed us.

Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar is counted amongst the legendary sweet shops who have been serving the people of City of Joy with delicious sweets from their kitchen which leave the taste buds wanting for more. You just can't have one! :P

From the array of sweets available, the following was ordered:

- Rossogulla (Plain)
One of their famous items. The soft ball of mild sweetness simply melted in the mouth. Recommended.

- Gulab Jamun
Served hot. Had the perfect balance of cardamom flavor. Delicious.

- Chocolate Sandesh
Tasted good. The chocolate flavor wasn't too overpowering.

- Malai Chumchum
Was just about decent. Could have been a tad sweeter and softer.

- Madhurparka
It is a light, sweet and creamy yogurt served chilled in plastic cups. A couple of different flavors are available of which the chocolate was opted. Tasted nice.

The friendly staff served with a smile.
Prices were pretty reasonable.

Overall a good experience.

Their rasgollas are too good...small round sweet balls of goodness. I have never been to their shop which is in north Kolkata but have been having their rasgollas for years. We send someone to get it for us from the shop.They have maintained their standard and the price of ten rupees for the small ones is tremendous value for money. Nowhere else do I find such spongy balls of sweetness.

Rassogola Rassogola and only awesome Rassogola if you have not tasted their rassogola yet, you have tasted nothing. In my opinion here's rassogola is the best rassogolas of the Kolkata. So spongy, so tender, extremely light & delicious rassogola, you will forgate to court how many enjoyed.... Must must try. This outlet pack rassogola in traditional earthen pot for carrying home. Others sweets and sandesh are extremely fine.

It is situated near A.V.School. Each and every sweet they offer is great but there is nothing like their rosogolla. Chittaranjan is mainly famous for the rosogolla. They serve the best spongy rosogolla in the town. Whether you like rosogolla or not you are gonna love the spongy rosogolla offered by this place. The demand is so high that mostly you cannot avail the rosogolla worth rupees 15 but the 10 rupees rosogolla will also do great.

Known for Rassogollas and variety of different sandesh, this more than 100 years old shop is very famous in North Kolkata . But I personally like the soft Gulab Jamun more than anything else. One must try the Madhuporko available in 4 different flavours which tastes like having Misti Doi and sandesh together.

I am so overwhelmed and intimidated by the legendary sweet shops of Calcutta that I rarely want to write a review! Hence read this is as an expression of my elation rather than a review of CMB's sweets :D I had the opportunity to savor the chocolate sandesh and malai chamcham here. The chamcham stole my heart and continues to do so even 5 days of refrigeration later. Just beautiful. The chocolate sandesh might pale in comparison but is mighty good in itself. Surprisingly not overly sweet.

Rosogolla!!!!!! ¬†The Foremost choice of Most people of Kolkata when it comes to Rosogolla. Specially for Celebrations and Family Occassions.

The people at counter are always busy packing Big Handis(Earth Pots) with Rosogollas for their Loyal Customers.

What I liked more is their Malai Chamcham , it was Superb and worth what they charged. Best I ever had. Fresh, Juicy, Flavourful.

One advice, If you are getting it for any Function to be served to Guest, Double your estimate of Quantity. North is enough, be ready to run for more Rosogollas in between the Program :)

Not much to say about a legend itself Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar at Shyam Bazar. They are known for Rasogullas, Malai Chamcham and of course Madhuparka.¬†

Rasogullas are¬†soft, spongy, yellowish juicy sweet balls will melt in your mouth one the best one can find in Kolkata. Madhuparka is their innovation and token of gratitude to sweet lovers on completing centenary in the year 2006. This is a flavoured, sweet and creamy yoghurt, served chilled in plastic cups comes in 4 varieties like Vanilla, Elaichi, Orange and Chocolate. I liked the Elaichi flavour compared the rest. Kindly note they don't have traditional misti doi (sweet curd). Malai Chamcham is another elegant light flavoured juicy sweet highly recommended too.

Price is not exorbitant quality comes with a cost. Packaging is neat and no dripping of juice.

Today was my first visit to this iconic shop & I dare not rate it anything below 5!! lol

I am not too fond of sweet dishes, since childhood... however, after being told several times about this place by my cousins, I decided to give it a go! Visit to North Kolkata is always incredible as I don't frequent that part of the city too often.¬†

Although the address says "Shyam Bazar"... just don't make the mistake I did! It's much more conveniently located to the Metro station - Shobha Bazar.¬†

I was there to try the Roshogollas only, however I was pretty sure that a sweet dish won't be able to make a notable impact on someone who is SO inclined towards chilli & spices!! The skeptical me... ordered one rashoholla to gauge their credibility... WHAT FOLLOWED WAS A TSUNAMI OF SWEETNESS, SOFTNESS, FRESHNESS & AWESOMENESS! lol I ended up having five more & packing a large quantity for home. I literally had to hold back my brother from devouring all 15 of them & managed to take some snaps of the last ones remaining! lol Honestly, right now I feel one can only call him/herself a Bengali, after savouring this delicacy at least once!! Oh well, looks like I just graduated ;) :D :D

It's a takeaway shop and the Roshogollas are priced at 10 & 15. BUT, IT'S WELL WORTH THE MONEY & EFFORT. :) Do visit even if you are not into sweets!!

This place was at a stone's throw distance from my school, a lot of memories are attached with this place. I remember my mother used to by me the kalojam or the pantua after my exams. The rosogolla and all other 'roser misti' are very very good. I particularly loved the decorated hundis in which they sell the rosogolla or the doi. Many variations of sandesh as well. They kepp on experimenting and you would invariably see something new every month

Its just a few steps away from my place, so no prizes for guessing I have grown up devouring their sweets! But, sadly, my age and this shop's quality share an inversely proportional relationship. As I have grown up I have seen this shop get worse. Frankly, the one thing it was(is) famous for, ROSOGOLLA too doesn't taste the same anymore. You will not be able to make out whether that's plain water mixed with some sugar syrup or really the much cherished juice(rosh) of "rosh"ogolla!  Their MADHUPARKA tastes very nice bdw and I have given this shop 2.0 solely for that. Don't waste your time visiting this place and people who try and link " tradition" with this outlet, its utter claptrap.

Chittaranjan is a very popular name, when it comes to mishti of West Bengal, especially the rosogollas are just out of this world! Not only are rosogollas good in taste, but also they have a uniquely soft texture, which makes it even more delicious. About the owners', I have a family-like relation with them & their humble response from that side of the counter pleases the customers to come back the next time.

Chittaranjan is situated very close to my house and so me and my family holds a good relation with the owners of this place and for any special occasion we take sweets only from Chittaranjan. As already mentioned in the earlier reviews Chittaranjan makes one of the best rasogullas. I love their modhuparka and kesar chumchum also. So every time when I am in search of having good rasogollas or sandesh I generally go to Chittaranjan.

One a short trip to Kolkata, needed Bengali sweets for a family occasion. A trip from south Kolkata meant a 15 km distance, but decided to go anyway. Was egged on by a friend who defined their rasogollas as world famous.

It was worth the effort. Gr8 spongy stuff! And the freshness of the cheese!

Best enjoyed when taken in as whole, then softly squeezed with your teeth to suck in the syrup and and finally chew into the cheese slowly. 

Rasogollas are available all over Kolkata and is a must-have when you are here. Chittaranjan is by far one of the very best!

They too made me try an ice-cream cum frozen curd like sweet dish packed in a ice cream cup. I dont remember the name, i guess they havent named it yet but the flavour still excites my sweet tooth. 

All in all a very good place for sweet lovers.

This place is famous for its soft and crunchy(?) rosogollas but these rosogollas overshadow the other sweets in this outlet. Try their chocolate sondesh, aata sondesh, raabri, nolen gurer sondesh, even ponchamrito and I bet you won't be disappointed. They have a wonderful variety of somewhat overpriced sweets but the culinary experience is totally worth it. I live nearby and I have watched this shop's journey from ordinary to legendary so please pardon my emotional bias towards this place.

This is another legendary sweet shop in Kolkata which has been in existence over a hundred years. My father was a regular here during his boyhood days and also during his youth when all friends would go all the way to Chittaranjan to eat their rosogollas amd mishti doi. Located near the sova bajar metro station it lies in the heart of North Kolkata. The rosogollas are to die for and so are the pantuas. Yesterday i tried the Madhuporko and it was out of the world. i tried the vanilla flavour though there are other flavours like orange, elaichi etc. Madhuporko is something in between mishti doi and a mousse. it is simply mindblowing sweet dish. An innovation which is a must try.

I said, u bet there is. and if u havnt tasted their products once, ur stay in northern side of the city remains unfulfilled. fortunately, he stays in south. and fortunately, i hav bn to this shop since i didn't hav the memory when. excellent sandeshs are what most people don't associate with chittoranjan, chiefly bcoz the fame of their rasogollass is legendary! but they are no less special, especially the norom-paak ones. housed near AV school, this is one of the old sweet shop who has not yet branched out in different locations.

During my recent Kolkata visit I made it a point to visit Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar. Initially I had problems finding the place which was eased after giving a call to their number. It was raining heavily on the day but still I decided to visit the place.
¬† After reaching the place, I was so relaxed to see the sweets. They all looked so beautiful and gave an idea of the taste they carry. I first ordered for two rasogollas. Wow was what I uttered after I put the first rosogolla in my mouth. Then I ordered two pieces of pantua. It was so delicious. I really never had such rosogullas and pantuas. Finally I ordered them to pack rosogullas and pantuas for my relatives. Many of the relatives never had rosogullas from Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar even after staying in Kolkata for years. They really liked the rosogullas and made a point to visit the,.
¬† The only negative thing happened with me was that Mishti Doi was not available with them.

Though this place is famous for its special Kolkata rasgullas the one reason I repeatedly visit this shop tucked down in an alley near central avenue is for 'madhuparko'.

I went to this place yesterday and i am so sad it took me 3 years to get to know about this mishti treasure trove right in my area.
The rasgullas were great compared to what kolkata offers but well,i am a bit biased about burdwan's rasgullas.
But the rest of the sondesh...(and i have always been a sandesh freak) ...were awesome. Fresh,soft and not too overpoweringly sweet,they had just the right balance of flavours. The 'golap pata' and the chocolate sandesh were excellent,as were the host of other mishtis we tried,including kara paker sandesh.
To finish it off,i tried their 'madhuparka',and was so delighted that I ended up having two-one cocoa flavoured and one vanilla.
The place is quite affordable,with 5 sandesh, 5 rasgullas and 2 madhuparka leaving us with only 128 rs less.
I'm surely going to visit it regularly for my mishti cravings!

Kolkata the name of the city is synonymous with the word Mishti. Even the person who knows nothing about the city knows rosogolla and mishti doi. And trust me none makes the rosogolla better than Chittaranjan. Situated at walking distance from Shobhabajar metro, their Rosogolla is what defines the true bengali delicacy.¬†
But the best is yet to come. Try their 'Madhuparko'...its milk with cream. Costing at 20rs for a small bowl its the true food of the gods. It will surely take you to another world.

There is just one place in this town which serves soft ¬†as butter rasgulla every time you visit and if your are lucky you would get hot and soft rasgullas. I love this outlet and I have never actually tried anything else other than their rasgullas . having them takes you to a different world. You just cant settle with 1 or 2 . You feel like gulping down more and forgetting about all the calories. Price wise its always cheap and its standards are quite high. They should really consider opening some new outlets in a more accessible area. Other than that amazing place.

Whenever somebody visiting Kolkata enquires about Rasogolla, I always end up sending them to this place. If you are a Calcuttan and did not have a taste of Chittaranjan er rasogolla then you have surely missed something. The rasogolla is spongy and soft, with the just right amount of sweet syrup in it. You cannot stop yourself at just one. It is tempting. They also make very good malai chamcham, chanar jilipi etc. it is a legend, it is a part of Kolkata‚Äôs food heritage.

This is a wonderful sweet shop at north kolkata which is located near lal mandir in shyam bazar. Chittaranjan is a lengend in rosogolla's and chamcham's, the malai cham cham they make is just superb! I live in South Kolkata but whenever some people from the North comes to our house they have a big hari of rosogollas or a big packet of malai cham cham. I prefer their malai cham cham as it is heavenly. One passing by Shyambazar or Hatibagan region must visit this place!!
My recommendations---> Malai cham cham.

I worship this place for its Heavenly ROSOGOLLAS.. Just feel like diving in those big buckets of rosogolla they prepare fresh and store in the early afternoon.. and Mind u.. they do get over before evening.. Such is the popularity of this place.. I am a South Kolkata person.. and still travel the long distance to have their Rosogollas whenever I am in Kolkata.. Apart from the Rosogollas, I am a big fan of their Malai chomchom.. This delicacy is wrapped with a layer of malai unlike found in other sweet shops and is so tasty.. Even we ordered Sweets from here on my marriage reception..and everybody was going gaga over the sweets served.. A place you should not miss if you are in Kolkata

Again i do not know why i haven't reviewed this Epic place earlier. I usually don't go to the shop, prefer to send people over for the fresh rasagolla. I prefer them any day over KC Das. The claim to fame is that they clam to originate the Rasgolla as does KC Das. 

Their sweets are comparatively less sweet and besides rasagolla they make an epic Chamcham . It is juicy and moist  and finger licking good. 

last time i went there the man at the counter suggested me this Custard like thing which came in plastic cups and was available in various flavor. The elaichi and the mango flavor were brilliant . 

over all a part of  the epic kolkata gastronomy

i have been a great fan of chittaranjan mistanna bhandar (located near lal Mandir, shyambazar)  ever since my childhood. My dad always used to get me rasgullas from here.  I am happy that zomato has even brought this misti shop into its ambit. Despite the fact that it is so far from my place, we always used to purchase sweets specially rasgulla from here due to its outstanding quality. The rasgulla out here is the most special because of its tenderness and the way it melts in your mouth. I dont think any other mistanna bhandar prepares as good rasgullas as chittaranjan.

Its a must try for all the foodies. Now that i have discovered the place, i will be coming up with my second review shortly on other dishes too. Their yellow rasgulla is also outstanding. The main fun of having these rasgullas is when it is served hot. So, go and grab urself some rasgullas. :P 

Even the cham cham out here is mouth watering as my foodie friend Poorna Banerjee has already mentioned therein.

Another visit is due on my cards. :)

I have to say, I am totally guilty of forgetting this amazing place near Shyam Bazar area. Chittaranjan is a legend in itself, especially for two things - the rasagolla and the cham cham. If any one from the house goes towards Shyam Bazar or Hatibagan region, we sort of give them a list of things to get, and sweets would definitely be in the list. A few days ago, got a batch of their cham cham, and it was sweet, soft, and melt-in-your-mouth gorgeous.

I am as surprised to see no vote or review for this place as i am honoured to be the first reviewer of this legendary sweet shop located in Shovabazar area beside Shyambazar AV School. It belongs to the league of Girish Ch and Nakur Ch Nandy, Surendranath Dey etc who have maintained a top notch quality since forever. Such is its reputation that once the shop opens at 8.00 am, there is quite a rush for its sweets any hour of the day. 

The place is very clean and food very hygenic. The racks keep emptying ensuring you get fresh stuff always. Known for the extra soft rossogollas, gulab jamunas, it has a great and amazing variety of sandesh on offer as well. The prices are decent. The staff are friendly and do not hesitate in answering your queries.

My favorite here is the malai cham-cham which is a delight and have seen many people from out of town taking it with them when they leave. Gulab jamuns are provided just like rossogollas dipped in the sugar syrups and are very soft and yummy. Pineapple sandesh too is great though not always available. Gulab sandesh, nolen gur sandesh are the other great sandesh they make. Everyone i know loves it rossogolas though i prefer the harder variety available at banccharam etc.

In short, it is one of the best sweet shops in Kolkata for me but yes, it could add some more variety in the sandesh department.
