The best things about this place are pan fried fish and drums of heaven. They can be real good. Nothing much to talk about anything else. It's quite a humble place with around 4 tables that can accommodate 16 odd people at max. The most common mode of ordering seemed to be parcel delivery ordered over phone or takeaways. I was in a mood for some gravy noodles. So we also ordered some. But that's not what you should visit this place for. Try those two dishes I have mentioned. If you are lucky (often such eateries are quite inconsistent) you won't regret having them.

Originally, it was a multi-cuisine restaurant, but has since branched out into two separate establishments: this one retains the Chinese and roll sections, while the South-Indian and Mughlai fare is presently available at Bhoj Bilash, a sister-concern situated across the street. I visited here for dinner and ordered mixed Jai Thai (flat noodles), but the waiter informed us that they have run out of prawn. Hence I had to settle for the chicken version; even so, it was scrumptious…so I’m no longer complaining ;) The side dish of Manchurian Fish was okay, though the gravy seemed awash in tomato and soya sauces. 

I must laud Bell Peppers for using Kolkata Bhekti in their fish preparations; it is a welcome break from most eateries which nowadays serve only the bland basa…even the so-called famous restaurants!!

A small restaurant located near Acropolis mall famous for its momos. Two of my friends suggested to try out their pan fried momo. It was delicious to the power infinity.Along with that we took a plate of dry chilli chicken which was also palatable.

I picked up mixed chowmein and boneless chilli chicken for dinner at home, so unable to comment on their dining service. Mixed chow was tasty. But the chilli chicken ordinary. Quantity was moderate. Two years back I had the same dishes, this time I found a little improvement in taste. Price is reasonable.

While searching for greasy spoon with fascinating  combos, we happened to find this place just bang opposite of Acropolis Mall named BELL PEPPERS. A not so teeny-weeny hashery which have their outlets also in Baghajatin. They assist with some combo meal during luncheon time from 12pm-3pm,which is devilishly value for money. We asked for two chinese chicken combo meal which comprises of finely cooked chicken fried rice and another one with chicken chowmein with some scrumptious 3 pieces of chili chicken along with cold drinks to quench your thirst. The staffs are courteous and well mannered even they have the facilities of packaging of leftover food if you wish to. This is a perfect place to treat your taste bud even in your busy schedule for lunch and foods are all inclusive of taxes. All in all we liked our experience, their combo would definitely  take us back to this place again.

I have been frequenting this food joint since 2015. Built on a very small space equalling the size of a bedroom, there's not much to the ambience to boast of. If you are on a frugal budget and would want to have cheap Chinese, this place is the place to go to. Food taste is okay-ish and the hospitality on a mediocre level. I have hovered from rolls to dosas to biryani to soups to Chinese. Taste was decent only until recently when much to my dismay, I took bro out for Bhai-Dooj dinner and discovered that the place is in shambles now. The floor looked like it wasn't mopped in many months littered with garbage. The table allotted to us had morsels of food stuck to it. Waiter had to be asked for water and told to clean up the table. We ordered Chinese since Biryani wasn't available. Soup and noodles was okay. Fried rice tasted like puke and the color of the garlic chicken gravy was something we witnessed the first time. Waiter never waited on us. He dropped the order and went about running other errands. As much as I feel disappointed while I write this review, I wouldn't visit this joint anytime in the near future again (it spoiled the evening to no end) while hoping the concerned authorities look into it and strive to better the worse state of affairs.

Have been to this place ample lots of times, but have mostly chosen the takeaway option since the place is quite tiny. Their combos are a great way to fill your tummy and also not dig much deeper into your pockets. 

I have tried their mixed hakka noodles, chicken noodles, mixed fried rice, chicken fried, chilly chicken and chilly fish from their main course. I find the fried rice quite bland to be honest. Not a fan of it. However the hakka noodles is great and the fish ws quite well cooked. 

From their starter section I had ordered the crispy chilly babycorn twice, but it was very disappointing to say the least. The momos however are extremely good. Overall its a decent place if you are in that area and run out of places to visit, but it definitely would not be my first choice.

We mainly go there for a hangout after college coz it's nearby and when the wallet feels too light for an eat-out at Acropolis food court. But I am not complaining as they offer good quality food. Seating space is quite small. The AC stops working often and we have to sweat out in summer. They have a good ongoing business and the menu is varied too. They didn't add tax but that should is justified because of the not-so-good service. Once our tone went a bit high and we were rudely asked to lower the volume. We have mainly tried the Chicken Noodles and The Crispy Kronjee Chicken. The latter is my favourite here.

This restro is located near Kasba New market, opposite of Acrpolis mall. It's a very tiny restaurant with 3-4 tables crammed in. 
The only and major huge setback of this place is the behaviour of the staff. They just don't give a damn about anything. Once they made me wait for so long that I got up and left after waiting for 45 mins( they didn't even take the order in that time period)

A takeaway counter mainly comprising of rolls and south indian fare is set up on the outside of the restro. The cash counter being inside the restro paves way for commotion. People queu up inside this little place for billing of their rolls.

But, Food is good. Decent food at decent price. I love love their chicken momos. Huge momos filled with a spoonful of chicken mince(sometimes I found it too dry though) served with an extraordinary red sauce and soup.
Other Chinese dishes ar good too. Special mention: Jai Thai nodlodles, their speciality, is really awesome. You have to place your order for the noodles from beforehand as it takes time to cook this thick flat noodles.

No matter what others say, I just love their rolls. It has the correct proportion of ingredients according to me. Their biryani is not so good. Once in a while it's fine for consuming if really hungry coz the smell they give, spoils the fun of having the same. It doesn't go with the smell of biryani to a great extent I feel. Their chow mein is good with reasonable quantity which people can try out. I always go for their rolls that's it :d

Let me elaborate the experience on Various parameters.
Ambience: A small and cluttered place with too few seats. If you are there during the evenings or weekends, be ready to stand in the queue. It just seems like a small room with tables and chairs. 

Service: I should call it disservice to the consumers. The staff is extremely uncooperative and is indifferent to the ordeals of the customers. They have a south Indian stall just outside the gate. When we visited there, we were told to wait as the seats were occupied. Meanwhile, we bought the coupons from the restaurant and ordered some Idlis. When we got our seat, we were not allowed to bring the Idlis inside because it's against their policy! Upon several entreaties they remained indifferent and despite having bought it from the same restaurant we were not allowed to eat it there even though we were ordering more food from the inside.

Food: Most of the items on the menu aren't available and you hardly get a meal of your choice. Most of the times, they serve Chinese food which is pathetic from every standard. 

Overall: It's a trouble best avoided. Don't visit them unless you are at a gunpoint.

This restro is located near Kasba New market, opposite of Acrpolis mall. It's a very tiny restaurant with 3-4 tables crammed in. 
The only and major huge setback of this place is the behaviour of the staff. They just don't give a damn about anything. Once they made me wait for so long that I got up and left after waiting for 45 mins( they didn't even take the order in that time period)

A takeaway counter mainly comprising of rolls and south indian fare is set up on the outside of the restro. The cash counter being inside the restro paves way for commotion. People queu up inside this little place for billing of their rolls.

But, Food is good. Decent food at decent price. I love love their chicken momos. Huge momos filled with a spoonful of chicken mince(sometimes I found it too dry though) served with an extraordinary red sauce and soup.
Other Chinese dishes ar good too. Special mention: Jai Thai nodlodles, their speciality, is really awesome. You have to place your order for the noodles from beforehand as it takes time to cook this thick flat noodles.

I knew of it as a takeaway joint until a few days back. The service is a sheer dissappointment. Consider it as a paaraar Chinese shop and ud be happy with the food! I tried the dry chilli chicken and noodles, both were decent.

The quality as well as the quantity has degraded a lot in two years. Sometimes they don't even serve water. When they do, you may smell the dish washing bar in the water.

No matter what others say, I just love their rolls. It has the correct proportion of ingredients according to me. Their biryani is not so good. Once in a while it's fine for consuming if really hungry coz the smell they give, spoils the fun of having the same. It doesn't go with the smell of biryani to a great extent I feel. Their chow mein is good with reasonable quantity which people can try out. I always go for their rolls that's it :d

Ordered online,was a little late for delivery but the food made me happy.I have been to many Chinese restaurants and many of them sell fried rice with small prawns and they stink.but fried rice from this restaurant was very good to be true and they gave good and fresh quality prawns as well as the hunan sliced chicken was standard.Good to have this kind of restaurant in locality..

Very few people know about this awesome petite but cute restaurant located near Kasba new market. This is by far the cheapest with sufficiently delicious pocket friendly Indianised Chinese restaurant I have come across till now. Its pan fried chicken momo and veg schezwan hakka noodles are awesome! They also have a fast food stall which gives away rolls, mughlai parathas etc in the evening. Cheap yet yummy, decent air conditioned seating inside. What else do you need when you are tight in budget yet want to treat your taste buds ! :) :P

Placed an order for home delivery last friday which had plain dosa,uttapam,veg chow and chillie mushroom. With the first bite of chillie mushroom a feeling of uneasiness gripped me. I had to throw entire mushroom in bin after having 3 -4 bites. Mushrooms were stale,which left me with severe food poisioning through which I am still recovering. Worst food I had ever had in my life. Will suggest people think twice before visiting this place. Selling stale food to customer is the biggest example of unprofessionalism one could ever see.

Ordered dere mutton thali n it was just like home food . Fish fries r d best but  not good enough french fries with it . Dose living near kasba Siemens should know abt it even though area has lot of Chinese restaurant. Dere house fav pan fried chicken n chinese items r quite famous along with south indian dish. I wish dey open thai restaurant in dis area soon.

As a student and a big fast food lover, I use to visit here every day after college to have some evening bite. Rolls are very good at reasonable prices with nice service. But if you think to visit here for the main course items, please don't. The dishes are not up to the mark. Some times got burnt food.

This time i placed the order with zomato  online order app.As this place is nearby my home i thought it l hardly take half n hour to deliver the food..god!they took an hour n 15mins.
Less than a km from my home..
Coming to the food.. i orderd sweet corn soup and hot and sour soup..the taste was not good...the soup wasn't thick neither i cud have any flavour of sweet corn soup!nothing impressive.. along with tat i orderd masala dosa and idly!The packaging was not done nicely..dosa was too oily..n the sambhar and chutney was not up to the mark..
Overall experience was ok..

this was yet another order I placed with zomato order.Therefore,I have no idea about its ambiance and service,and I rated it completely based on the food quality.I took the chicken biryani with raita which was just like you expect it to be,albeit a troubling aroma of synthetic products..The prawn masala is spicy,tangy,almost a working class oil-laden junk with succulent pieces of prawn that can enliven your palates  both with rice or bread.only complaint would be at250,they can serve better portions.yumyum noodles is gravy mixed noodles made very similar to spaghetti.It tastes great,and comes at 160/- only.
However bell peppers made a mess with the delivery.They are located hardly 3-4 km from my place and yet I received the order 2 hours after placing it.Normally,that attracts poor rating,but they kept in touch over the phone all the time,thus maintaining the appearance,that they will deliver.

Absolutely atrocious experience. Went for a quick bite yesterday. Ordered a Dosa. Once delivered from the counter, took it inside the restaurant to grab a quick bit. After i sat down and started having the stuff, i was told curtly by a waiter (as instructed by the person in the counter) that one could not have dosa inside the restaurant and I needed to move out. I was shocked first, and then was infuriated by the callous tone of the waiter and the owner. While i asked the owner, in spite of being apologetic, he was trying to give justification of this action. Firstly, i was never told that dosa was for takeaway orders and one could not have it inside the restaurant . Secondly, as a customer, i have never experienced this anywhere in the world that a customer has been asked to move out after s/he started dining. Thirdly, it was half empty and definitely i did not come in the way of their business. What a shame! 'Customer' been royally thrown out of the window! In spite of it being costly for the average food that they serve and long wait time, i used to visit this shop for its proximity to my residence. However, after yesterday's experience, I promised to myself never to visit this place ever again. You might like to consider this while you visit this place the next time and be ready for a not-so-friendly-service. All the best to those who would dare!!!

This place is very close from my home. Had their egg rolls couple of times which they sell from their open counter next to the entrance of the restaurant. Recently they have opened a dosa counter as well. Anyways I went their couple of days back to get some chowmine, the staff asked me to step in. I was their for parcel and not sit and dine. The if you compare the place with some other restaurant the price is decent. But in general the price is on the higher side as it's a small restaurant with mostly customers from the locality who search for evening snacks and cheap dinner on a regular basis. Veg Chowmine costs 85 and chicken Chowmine costs 100 so I settled for the later one. The food came after 15 mins wait. The Chowmine was very much oily and normal to taste. 
It's a one time visit destination since the price is on the higher side and located in a Bengali para. It's difficult to get regular customers..

This is a good place for anyone who desires a nice Chinese meal in a decent air-conditioned room, and at the same time, is running low on money.

That was exactly the case for us. A thriller movie in the morning had made us hungry, along with the summer heat pounding on our heads. Zomato and GoogleMaps led us to Bell Peppers - if going from ruby, get down at Kasba New Market, turn left and walk a few steps. The place will be on your left.

First and foremost, the offerings mentioned are probably the most inexpensive ones among those in the menus of all of its nearby competitors (with airconditioned seating areas).

In a matter of seconds, the Chinese Combo was ordered. Having a half plate of chicken hakka noodles, an equal serving of chicken fried rice in the same plate, served alongside a bowl of chilly chicken (3-4 pieces) and a soft drink, all for ₹110 (as on 17th April, 2015) was like a dream deal!

Although the fried rice and chowmein were good, given such a low price, the chilly chicken got all the thumbs-downs. The chow had a homely taste in it, which wasn't too bad for the place.
The entire meal was filling, coupled with really quick service to tame the hungry souls.

To all college students, do give this place a visit!

The bharta tasted awesome with the parathas . The combos ... here .... are awesome .... we took one Chicken Chicken Combo - 3 pc chilli chkn , fried rice , noodles , cold drinks all included . The combo was only Rs. 110 /- , the quantity is too much for one , unless one is in empty stomach . 

All over , its cheap & good ! * if you need Combos , please check in before 3 pm . :)

An average place with average food. Price is the the usp of this place. A little calm environment, but the ac does not work at times,making it suffocating. At times maybe some other cook cooks it,so the quality falls down sharply at times. The combo deal is lucrative,but the quantity is really very little. Overall, will go to this place again n again for a quick bite.

Not much crowded, calm n quiet, little restaurant at Kasba, Chakrabarti Para. Well known in the locality. I went with my brother and we had mixed hakka noodles and schezwan chicken. I liked the chicken dish more. I was a bit amused since they served the food exceptionally fast. But a second visit to the restaurant totally let us down. There weren't enough waiters to attend the tables and they made us wait for a long time after which they said the cook was on leave. How strange can that be!!

This is probably one of the cheapest restaurants in the Kasba area. Bell Peppers has two sections - one for the fast food section and another the air conditioned restaurant. Good food, affordable price & comfortable ambiance are what you can look forward to here. I and a friend went in here one afternoon to celebrate her first salary. We ordered Deep Blue Sea in mocktails, Fried Chicken Wings as starters, Veg. Fried Rice and Chicken Kung Pao for our main course. The mocktail was good and the name of it was quite synonymous with the look of it. For starters, a plate of Fried Chicken Wings had 8 pieces. It was very well cooked and extremely tasty. The main course was enough in quantity. The fried rice was rightly cooked and tasted great with Chicken Kung Pao which is a must try here.

Bell Peppers is one of the cheap eats in Kasba. The restaurant is located just behind the lane of Kasba New Market. Looking from outside, the restaurant looks very small and limited in space.

The food is nothing to praise about, at least their Chinese preparations are not good enough. They are just about eatable, and nothing more than that. The Hakka Noodles was very oily and the quantity was very less. Moreover it was packed so poorly. The Sweet and Sour Chicken was also very oily and was not tasty at all. Crispy Garlic Pepper Chicken was hard rather than crispy.

Packing of the food for home delivery was pathetic as all the boxes were smashed. The Hakka Noodles was in the worst state as it came out of the box. Delivery time is also very sluggish as it took 1.5 hrs for food to arrive to the house in the next lane. The delivery boy was not at all efficient in finding an apartment on the main road and we had to call him three times to get him cleared.

The delivery boy was so annoying that he could neither tell where he was and didn't even recognize well known landmarks. After he delivered the food, he did not returned the change and was almost running away when I stopped him to ask about the change to which he said that he didn't carry any and before saying anything else, he rushed away.

Prices are very low but the kind of service and the food quality is not good. Also quantity is of some items such as Hakka Noodles is not sufficient. I would recommend them to increase the prices if they can improve their services and the food.

This little restaurant is very close to my house and i often order from here. Not a swanky place but their service, food is bang on.
Recently they have got a chef specially to make biryani and i have to say its brilliant. The price is verry reasonable and the quantity and quality of food is just WOW.

The best i had so far was their mutton biryani, chilly fish in garlic sauce, fish finger and prawn pepper salt. Very succulent and well cooked. The fish items dont have that typical fish smell.  Till date their food have not let me down. Whenever i have guests over i make sure i get food from here. Who doesnt enjoy good food , good quantity and good rates. 

This place proves that even a small restaurant can serve good food. We usually get carried away with big names and ambiance but this place will prove you wrong. Not only are their north dishes yum but their chinese items are equally good.

Just superb.

Update for 20th Aug: Well i have been ordering from bell peppers for a long time and their items are indeed good and tasty but i do feel they are starting to drop. Recently went there to have dosa. Ordered one butter masala dosa and my oh my i think the dosa maker practically poured kgs of lemon in it. It was sooo sour and inedible. Not just the sambar, the dosa and the coconut curry too was insanely KHATTA.  Really disappointed. Moreover the guy who sits at the till now is so DUHH. Initially their owner used to sit and run the show and he was prompt, jolly, informative and suggested me variety of good dishes but the guy now is so dull that you dont even want to speak. Buckle up guys before you end up with no customers.

*** i am not changing my rating as i still believe they can get back in form !!

A small food joint that surprises u with the taste it excels in....... lip smacking biryanis, rolls, Chinese...
The joint has a lot to offer... plus location wise its very good due to its presence in one of the developing areas in South Kolkata,...........
Bell peppers is one of those joints that not only provides u with gr8 food, but also gr8 ambience, service, quality, and real good food at a very reasonable cost.
A must visit for people who love to have rolls and biryanis!!! Gr8 job :)
