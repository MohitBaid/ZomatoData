Ordered food online through Zomato and got a complimentary cold coffee as Zomato treat.
1. Veg momo: 4/5 ~ Ample filling, outer flour coating soft and thin, doesn't break off on mere touching, neither hard like most of the joints. Also the soup is good, you can add salt if you want but I would recommend otherwise.
2. Masala paw : 4/5 ~ Absolutely wonderful at such low price.
3. Cheese onion and capsicum pizza : 2.5/5 ~ Now this was a huge disappointment. It was nothing like the pictures given in Zomato. I would have considered their misery in cheese but that with onion and capsicum was simply not acceptable. The number of tiny pieces of onion and capsicum were even less than the number of pizza slices. I mean like how much does that even cost?
4. Cold coffee: 4/5 ~ Good. Neither too thick nor too thin. Also it was delivered without any spillage.
Nevertheless quite a pocket friendly place to order food and their packaging is also good. Just do not order pizza and you're good to go.

Tried their "Double Cheese Pizza", "Supreme Garlic Bread" and "Red Sauce Pasta". I must sware that in an El-chepo price, I tasted real good snacks after a long time. The pizza costs 68/-, at this price range it cant be compared with dominos, but the pizza was realy juicy and tasty having ample amount of cheeze. Red sauce pasta was equally enjoyable. Only the garlic bread tasted average to me. Overall it was a pleasing experience. I will try their other items too in future. This restaurent can surely be considered as a hidden gem of Bangur area.

Hunt for some mixed red sauce pasta 
But was never that good as I expected
Took too much time to deliver it 
The packaging was poor as well 
They still need to work on their food a lot
Not satisfied at all!

Ordered an aloo cheese grilled sandwich and mixed pasta from here via Zomato and received a cold coffee complementary from Treats membership. The food was well-packaged and delivered before time. 
Aloo cheese grilled sandwich: 10/10 
Couldn't be any better. Huge, well-grilled, excellently prepared and very filling, this one is too good for the price it comes at. A simple yet brilliant sandwich. 
Mixed pasta: 8/10
Another really good dish. It was a bit sour but not uncomfortably so. Good quantity. Not much cheese was there. Overall, worth the money.
Cold coffee: 9/10
Not much to say about this. It's well proportioned and was delivered without any spillage. A good accompaniment to a great lunch.
I would definitely recommend this place for ordering in.

Ordered double cheese margherita pizza from here.. Well... Its good for an evening snack but if u r looking for an actual pizza taste this place will disappoint u.. Because they used mayonnaise nd tomato paste(excessive) as pizza base... Who does that?! 
But i think if they strt using less tomato base nd mayonnaise nd start putting extra cheese nd oregano.. It will taste good. Though i will mention a last point. Their packaging system is amazing.. Thumbs up for that.

Ordered Cheese Corn Sandwich, Cheese Pizza, Cheese Pasta & Butterscotch milkshake.

Pizza : 2/10 (extremely poor preparation & taste. Even Monginis, Mio Amore, Pizzas taste better) 
Sandwich : 6/10
Pasta : 9/10 (Delicious & great quantity)
Shake : 8/10 (wonderful taste but a bit watery) 

PROS :
Economical
The packaging was properly done

CONS :
The food could be a bit more tasty.

Food is great no doubt.Just there is a space issue.
You must increase your seating capacity. We had ordered pan fried momo,it was tasty. than we ordered paw bhabhi it was also good.than idly it was also nice.
We had pineapple shake which was heavy for a person.and a cold coffee which was also good.

Edit - I am increasing your rating to 4.5 because of my countless happy food experiences from this place. :) Thanks to it being amazingly pocket friendly and your too good to be true french fries. However your chocolate sandwich had something wrong with its taste. The chocolate tasted sour, like sour cream. And the small pouch you send with french fries is mayonnaise (I hate mayonnaise) and not cheese. Yet I still am in love with this place sinply for the pocket friendly, lip smacking taste of most of their items and hygiene maintained.

Old review - ordered food from here. I ordered pav bhaaji, grilled masala corn cheese sandwich and cheese veg momo.
The pav bhaaji tasted great. Loved it. It was served along with a piece of lime and chopped onions in a seperate pouch.
The grilled masala cheese corn sandwich had huge bread slices. Very filling. But I felt there were more onions in it than corn. It was nicely grilled. Liked it. The sandwich was packed with a sachet of ketchup complimentary.
The cheese veg momos were a little disappointing after all the great reviews of the momos. There were six pieces provided along with soup and a pouch of hot sauce. The soup lacked salt but that isn't a big issue since salt can be added. However the thing is the momos had very thick outer coverings (the maida part) and very little filling. They had cheese in them so that isn't a complaint and I can even overlook the small filling amount if the coating wasn't so thick. Spoils the taste of the momos. However that hot sauce was simply lip smacking and tasted great with the momos.
Very pocket friendly and nice variety of menu. One out of the three items was great, one good and none bad so definitely a place worth trying out.

I loved the food here.  I had ordered french fries with cheesy dip,  mix sauce pasta,  vada paw,  momos,  garlic bread.  If you ask me what is a must try dish here,  i would say everything is fantastic!!!  I wonder why it got so less rating as i feel that the quality and price are good.  Since i ordered online on zomato,  i got extra discount too. I loved the service and timely delivery and the food,  especially french fries,  pasta and garlic bread are mind blowing!!!  I would definitely recommend Refuel.

It's a small eating place located just beside Pepperz, which attracts most of the young crowd in the area.Once we were looking at places to eat online and found they had a really great deal on Little. We bought the code and went there. We ordered a Cheese Corn Sandwich and one cold coffee with ice cream for the two of us. While the food was being prepared the old man in the cash counter struck a conversation and started talking about how he started this food joint.The food was great and real economical, however, the whole eating out in a joint lost its charm after the person in-charge asked us to throw our plates ourselves in the dustbin outside.A few weeks later, we found ourselves at the same spot and we went inside again to try Momos, as it was something different from what half of Bangur has to offer - Vada Pav!The place is so small that it hardly had place to move after accommodating the three of us there.We ordered Momos, Pao Bhaji, Garlic Bread and two shakes! The momos were nice and so was the Pao Bhaji but the Garlic Bread didn't really hit the mark. Since we had a great conversation the whole time, the experience was amazing!But then when the time came for us to leave, we were called from outside the joint to throw our plates in the dustbin outside. It was a shocker for two of my other friends and they didn't really think it was a great service place like an eating joint should be.

Had ordered from Refuel for the first time via swiggy. I had ordered for a Oreo shake, Butterscotch shake and a Strawberry Shake. I loved the butterscotch one. It was the best among the three. The strawberry one was okay. Didn't quite like the oreo shake. One negative thing is that the shakes are not thick at all. A bit expensive considering the quantity.

Wanted to have a Pizza, came across this new joint Refeul, nice name must admit. Well ordered Vada Pavs, Supreme Garlic Bread, 9" Double Cheese Pizza and 9" Cheese Onion Capsicum Pizza. To start with the Vada Pavs were well made, Hot spicy Patty, Chutney was already included, and the Pav was Fresh and soft, Tasted yum. The Supreme Garlic Bread was truly Supreme by its name was hot and did contain ample amount of Cheese along with small pieces of Capsicum and Onion. Lovely must say... Finally the Pizza was well made only concern if the Tomato paste could had been a little less, nevertheless both the Pizza were good, hot and worth the money. Tomato Sauce sachet was provided, if only Chilli Flakes & Oregano's could had been provided. Overall a good experience would try again and yes just remembered the packaging is top notch wow very eye catchy.

Refuel is a small juice & dessert parlour located at Bangur. I have tried their masala cola and ice cream sundae from them. Both were refreshing and quite nice too. Liked them and will come back again too. :)
