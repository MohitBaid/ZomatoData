This place isn't worth a visit for its food but for the history attached to it. This is one of those shrines of bangali adda. Running since a time when independence from the British rule was still a dream. This place has seen generations come and go.. revolutions and revolutionaries.. the walls of this place are soaked with all sorts intellectual conversations. Coming to the food.. mere toasts tea and cakes are served which aren't something one would enjoy but the price is reasonable enough for whatever they are serving.

This place is visited not for articulated snacks but for the history attached to it. It has been running since the British era and still functional.

People generally sit here and have talks as well as debates ranging from local politician to NASA's failure in Mars.

The food out here is "not bad" and the price is extremely reasonable. The people serving out here may not be friendly at times and there are numerous occasions where you need to self-serve your food.

A visit to look forward to.

the taste may not very good still the legacy of history and it's incredible location keeps this cafe one of the best choices for college students. the clumsy interior is almost century old and carries histories of remarkable and notable personalities!

This place at collage street just near the Suryasen Street...very old place..running since 1918..among kolkata's  oldest teastalls..so many generation are involved there...If you want a place just to eat..and not matter the ambience just matter ta food and nostalgia..then you are at the right place..
Foods age so reguler...like tea..coffee..toast..etc...but their taste are good..& price is one of the most value for money..there are no one to tell you to leave the place..Most of the people who goes there are either our office going or student...I must say the intelligent students..& if you want to know the history of this place just ask the man..who sited at the cash..You can see the glory & happiness in his eyes..& a warm behaviour by this old man.."Dadu" is too good...
I'll recommend to go this place for those who want to explore...not every time you want to go for food...just go and saw..i think if you not love it you will surely like it..
