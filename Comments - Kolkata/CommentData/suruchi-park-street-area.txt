The price is on the higher side but the ambience and the food is good ... The vetki fry will simply melt in your mouth .. The kochi patha r mansho was light less spicy and good .. We had the Ilish thali .. The fish was ok ...

The restaurant serves authentic Bengali food. Being established in 1952 and fully operational from 1972, this was the first one to serve only Bengali food - a pioneering concept indeed. We opted for rice, daal, aloo bhaja, bekti fry (only one piece was available), mocha chingri, ilish bhapa, kochi panthar jhol, pineapple chutney, gokul pithey. All the items tasted really good. The hilsa was fabulous, so was the tender mutton curry.

It is run by women and their warmth and eagerness to serve can be felt easily. Added advantage is watching trams passing by while savouring the food - a touch of pure Kolkata.

As for the food, we rate them way ahead of other fancied restaurants in Kolkata.

I had learnt about this place thought highway on my plate and had wanted to go there for its authentic Bengali cuisine. It is run by simple ladies . The quantity is less but the food tasted amazing. It was light and tasty. The ambience was plain but nice.

I had been to this place in 2008 and the fact that i still remember the food vouches for how amazing it was.Suruchi was what a quintessential tourist of kolkatta must go to.The rui mach,iilish mach, dal ,rice and the thali is delicious and very satisfying.Huge recommendation if any of my mumbai friends plan to visit kolkatta someday .

After probably 15 yrs I went for Lunch at Suruchi. With Sukto, Dal, bhat, alu bhaja, Ilish mach, Malpoa. One of the low profile home style, standard eateries. The locality is downbeat. Parking is an issue. Pricing is VFM. Serviced and run entirely by Ladies. Amateur homely personal touch can be expected. One of my favourites. 16th October. 2014

This was the best food in our Kolkata trip. Ate the thali with jhujhure aaloo bhaja, parshe, bhetki, mishti doi. Everything was amazing. We got greedy and also ordered motorshutir kochuri. Another divine eat.

The food quality here is very bad. We went here for lunch. The quality offered and the service is not good at all. The veg items offered are very bad. We had lunch in kasturi and vajahari manna. They were awesome. After those experience, this is possibly the worst experience we had. And the price is too high.

I visited this place long back with my husband in a hot afternoon and came satisfied with the food and service.. This place is run by only women.. and they do it with care.. We ordered Plain rice,dal,alu bhaja, pui sag with macher muro, Ilish sorse bhapa, Mutton,chanti,papad and misti doi.. All the items were lip-smacking and so so tasty and light in your stomach in this scorching heat. The prices are also reasonable.. Had a great time here.. Hope to return to this place once I m in Kolkata
