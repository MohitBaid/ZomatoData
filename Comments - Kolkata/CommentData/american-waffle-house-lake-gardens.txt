A small waffle store in lake gardens! There is just one table to sit, so nothing to comment upon ambience. Staff is good and service is prompt. We had the dark chocolate waffles and it was quite good.

A small outlet, just opposite the Bandhan Bank near Lords crossing is this American Waffle House. It has a list of waffles, and shakes on the menu to pick from. I got my first taste of waffle with their Honey Fly Butter waffle with roasted almond topping. The crunchy hot waffle with this topping was heavenly and satisfied by sweet-tooth cravings.

Awesome waffles!!  Can't imagine such a crunchy waffle with so many variety of options,  specially in 100+ price range.  Tried Shakes.. Truly too good.. Lovely environment and location with multiple options for hanging out with family and friends..  Need to go again for other variety of waffles..  It is near to South city mall..  This attracted me like food lovers.. As all mist no waiting time their.. loved the concept of make your own waffle..  Opened till late night as late as 11.30
