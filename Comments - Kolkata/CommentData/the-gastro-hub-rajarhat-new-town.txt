It might be a good place and the staff might be good too but personally i did not like the PR lady over there. I went for 31st party n i called them n booked the table through zomato but when i went there the lady just denied that there’s any booking in my name. Then she is giving a lame excuse that we dont take booking thtough zomato, dear if u dont take bookings through zomato then please remove your outlet from zomato.. I would like the management of gastropub to look into their staff n do the necessary changes. Thank you👎🏻

Visited The Gastro Hub for Bhaifota celebration... We ordered the chinese sizzler along with Thai Chicken Satay, Thai mixed fried rice, Thai fish red curry and Thai chicken red curry. The sizzler was mouth watering. The momos were very juicy. The chicken satay was soft and succulent. The fried rice, the fish and the chicken curry carried a different aroma and flavor. Mostly, in Kolkata, Thai fried rice is served as a 'little more spicy simple Chinese fried rice'. To feel the difference and have an authentic flavour, you must visit this place. The staffs are extremely courteous and helpful regarding selection of the menu.
A huge Thumbs Up for the restaurant. Cheers!

I recently went there to try different style of foods. Really was satisfied the way they modified the simple roasted chicken into a elegant dish which was served with smashed potatos and baked veggies. I am now a big fan of you guys.  really deserve an appreciation for your creativity. Would recomend people who have a taste of different cuisines. We all are tired with the normal Britains, chaps ........ we indeed need something different in our life... this is the place to visit.

Gastro hub is a nice place. The ambience is very nice. The food was great and the price was also not very high, although they had not many varieties for starters.The service was very nice and the manager was very polite. We went for a birthday party celebration and the staffs greeted us very well. Overall it was a good experience and you wont be disappointed.
