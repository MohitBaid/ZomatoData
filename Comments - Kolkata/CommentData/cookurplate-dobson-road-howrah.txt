I have stopped reviewing since quite a few time now, but this food made me compulsory to review it.

Cook ur Plate a startup from home.
The owner is a lady, pretty decent and subtle. However this didn't helped her in the quality of food though!

I had ordered three items, and giving reviews on the basis of that :

1. Veggie burger : I just don't know how it tasted! First big bite I had taken of the burger and got a long strand of hair in my mouth. Out of the yucky feeling I threw the burger straight away.

2. Mixed sauce penne pasta : It was penne pasta for sure. But only penne pasta.
No sauce, no SALT, Nothing!!

Only boiled pasta, that too was in so small quantity for RS 110.
Even sunfeast pasta worth RS. 25 sever more quantity and definitely 1000% more taste in it.

3. Cheese garlic bread : It was a bread loaf, on which there was a garlic butter spread... Cheese was not there dur dur Tak!

I had give 1 star because there was no option for giving -5 stars.

Preferably the worst food I ever had.

The lady was quite decent and sweet, but I am sorry food was exactly the opposite.

Ordered Pasta in Italiano Alfredo Sauce, Tex Mexi rice & toffee frappe. The pasta was a bit on the dryer side and bland but the Tex Mex rice and coffee was pretty good. Quantity was lesser than expected from the advertised pictures, could increase the portions on delivery orders with larger foils maybe.
