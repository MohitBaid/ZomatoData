An average restaurant! I was in Elgin road and was looking for any fast food outlet. I accidentally dropped in here- Orchid. A narrow entrance leads you towards the main restaurant, table set up and seating arrangement is good and up to the mark, However I found the staffs without uniform not much experienced! Because they served us a chicken soup rather than a veg sweet corn soup which they later replaced it. Moreover, the noodles was not served hot and the service was very slow! Otherwise the taste was good. Quantity was worth the price, which is very much reasonable. Apart from all the cons mentioned above, I think that the service and quality can be significantly improved and it can be one of the best Chinese and Tibetan cuisine restaurants!

Basically we went in momo plaza to have lunch but it was under construction so we went for orchid because it was too late to go anywhere. The wait was very long as it was 25th December. They have very few staffs which is a problem. The ambience was nice according to the pocket pinch. The food was not very nice,we took a fried rice and lemon chicken. The rice tastes fine but the chicken wasn't good. They should improve the quality. Thinking about the money I would say one can have dinner or lunch if you are looking for cheap food.

Nice place to try some Tibetan food.  Hakka chowmein is good as well as Momos. However, soup is very bad. They need to improve  this. New decoration & ambiance is good but, the washroom is very dirty.
We have reached there for two time.
We have eaten:
Chicken momo
Chicken fried momo
Mix hakka chowmein
Shredded pork
American chopsuey

Really bad service. The staff kept confusing orders. And ended up mixing them with another order. 
Taste wise schezwan chicken and garlic chicken was totally similar, lookwise even the staff got confused about which dish was which . 
Mixed chowmein was a bit burnt . And orchid special chowmein was extremely watery , definitely not even at par with roadside fast food stalls. 
The only good point was their pan fried momo. It was tangy yet sweet, a beautiful balanced tasted.

Momo plaza was closed. So had to go there. And boy it was great. The food was awesome. The momos melted in the mouth. The chowmein had a hint of authenticity. I would though like a bit more chicken and prawn in the mixed chowmein. The chilly roasted pork made the evening divine.

Overall it was a good experience, not outstanding not bad. I went there with my friends and we had to wait for seats as the restaurant is pretty small. So keep that in mind. It can accommodate approximately 20 people at a time.
Now coming to the Food. Food was good. I liked it. Not extraordinary but keeping the prices in mind I would say its a nice place to satisfy your cravings for Chinese food(Momos are really good,must try the chicken pan-fried one if you love spicy food).
Prices on the menu is moderate. Like not too high and not crazily cheap either.
The service was fine. The waiters do listen carefully and also ask for specification while taking orders of certain dishes.

As informed by the owner it has opened after 4 long months of shutdown due to renovation only couple of weeks back. The decor has been revamped thoroughly with designer false ceiling , warm yellow lights, designer tiles, mirrors, wooden cabinets, chic tables and AC fittings. Great thing is price has not increased and the food tastes as good as before. Definitely pleased to be back here again !!

A cozy little place with quality chinese food at a very reasonable price. Clear noodle soup, mushroom soup, mixed fried rice, pork momos, cheese chicken momos and chilli garlic noodles are some of the local favorites. Don't be fooled by the old appearance and lack of an A.C because the food and the natural coolness of the place due it's old age compensate for the ambience.

A shady place on the road near sn pundit govt hospital, this restaurant is an age old joint serving oriental food. The very entrance may not be of any class, even the seating arrangements are quite road side shop type. But everything changes when you have the food. 
The momos are special here- pan fried or steamed, great ones. Pork momos are must have with a light chicken stalk soup. For main course we had their schezwan mixed rice- little oily but tasty. The american chopsuey is again- too too good. Sweet and sour prawn a dish to go for if you are a seafood lover. A pleasure to palate on a whole. 
P.s.  as its a non- ac restaurant so sunny days will be difficult here, otherwise a good joint.

This is one of the oldest places in Kolkata. 
My earliest memories go back to early 2000s when there weren't enough chinese or tibetan places around. My dad used to take us for some nice chinese food on weekends.
Till date I frequent this place. 
The pork preparations are tasty. 
My personal favourites are, Fried Pork Momos and Chilly Pork. 
The mixed fried rice is one of my favourites too. 
The place has a 70s Calcutta feel which comes quite naturally to it. 
Service is a bit slow, but the taste makes up for it.

When there are loads of eateries of the same kind and at the same area, I used to always think what makes one different from another. Over the time, I realised it's not solely because of the food but more to do with other associated factors.

Orchid is such a eatery which seems all fine for business but they have been too grumpy to carry on. It is located at one of the most popular location near Forum Mall and in 'hub' of Chinese eateries.

Upon entering you will find the ambiance to be dimly lit, the tables amply placed and the first look will give you the impression that it is clean. However, upon clear inspection, you will find that the tables are not really clean, they just cleared the tables somehow.

The food are tastes okay but the people serving are of worst quality possible. They lack normal decency and doesn't have even the least etiquette of serving. Their motive is to somehow 'crash' the table.

The only time you want to visit it will be possibly when you are with a comfortable group of friends and wants to spend an hour or so without much botheration. Otherwise, it is a big No No.

Orchid used to be another of the places where we used to celebrate our birthday parties or other get together during our college days. This place also serves pork for quite dome time now. And they are worth mentioning in terms of quality. The Chinese foods other than momo are pretty decent though it is slightly overpriced. Overall, not a bad place for a quick bite or lunch or dinner with friends.

All the three dishes we had was very tasty. Each one had to pay Rs 95.its quiet cheap. The ambience or the place may stop u to entering the restaurant, but the food is really awesome.

This place is suitable for quick grab on food if you are really hungry and do not intend to spend much!  :p
We went here to try out some momos and some chinese maincourse all of them in vegetarian!  
We ordered a plate of veg steamed momo and when we wanted to try out some more veg momo, we were told that the veg momos are over and don't have any!
Then we wanted to try some chinese main course but since we are vegetarians, we could not find much options..so chose not to order!
The steamed momo was really good though! 
A good place for non vegetarians!

This is one of those places that have been consistently maintaining a set standard. Tried their pork steamed momo and special thukpa.  The pork steamed momo was as always good. But what sealed the deal was the amazing special thukpa with a sizeable amount of noodles chicken prawn and eggs. The taste was subtle and needed no garnishing. Highly recommended as a pocket friendly and healthy eatery.

yes.. it's situated one of the prime location of Kolkata... in between Excide crossing and Elgin Road.. on the Chowrangee and Lee Road connector... & right beside Momo Plaza..

As I wasn't aware of this restaurant before.. we were getting back after some shopping from Forum (shoppers stop) and looking for some new joint (never been before place).. we suddenly discovered this place..

While getting in.. what we got that.. it's actually the unused place of the ground floor of an old traditional style building.. they've decorated like a restaurant.. not very well.. but good enough..
the place is not much organized.. uses plastic made tables & chairs.. 

and there was only one person who was managing all the customers.. taking orders.. serving.. billing.. etc.
not sure.. that's for the day only or not.. serving was delayed..

Foods was also ordinary.. but not bad.. appropriate to the prices...
Quantity was good.. one plate is enough for two..
Overall it's not a great place for hangout.. but a pocket friendly place to put out your hunger...

Recently, when we visited orchid an ordered a plate of steamed chicken momos we werent satisfied with the taste of the momo. It could have been much better. Orchid should pull up its socks when competing against momo plaza and tibetian delights.

Went to Orchid for some cheap food yesterday after a few drinks and well, it always is cheap there. If you're looking for ambience, turn around and walk away before you even enter the place, but, if you're looking for huge quantity of chinese food which is cheap, you've come to the right place. Let's go through the order now:

Fried veg momos - Huge sized momos, with good filling but oil was too much but I have no complaints like my friends who were dabbing it with their tissue papers

Mixed chilli garlic noodles - These noodles had a perfect balance which was not too spicy and had egg and chicken in it, when it first came we were shocked to see the quantity but well, we managed to finish it all.

Garlic chicken - We ordered this as the main side dish and it was amazing, not too spicy and just perfect to go with the chilli noodles.

This is located near Rabindra Sadan metro station. I had gone there quite some time ago after my friend said something about getting good momos here. I was very annoyed by the state of the restaurant. There is no ambience to speak of at all and the place seems unhygienic and dingy. We ordered a plate of chicken Hakka noodles and steamed chicken momos. The momos were alright,not bad. The chowmein wasn't up to the mark. Very oily. Pocket pinch is low here.

Orchid was one of those places which failed to impress me, be it with food quality, taste or service. Located in one of the prime locations this place is very easy to find. Its just few steps away from Chai Break near Rabindra Sadan Metro.
As you enter you would hardly find any light, so they should think to do something on that.
Secondly, I didn't find the place to clean and hygienic. As its one of the most important criteria in a restaurant, they should definitely look after this.
I ordered a Chicken Steam Momo, a Chicken Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken. I could find any of them to be very good. They were just edible. They took quite a bit of time bring the starters and we had to wait long.
The competition over that area is high and they should buck up to survive in the market.

The place is not very big and the ambiance is not at all praise worthy, but the food is good and it is a pocket friendly place. I've tried the chicken momo, which was juicy and good.

A pretty decent place to dine without burning a hole in your pocket. It is situated in elgin road near brand factory. There is not too much to mention about the decor. It has just basic decorations with air conditioning. It has a seating arrangrment of maybe around 40 people. The staffs are pretty nice. We ordered lung fung soup which was delicious and creamy. Then we ordered mixed chowmein hakka and mixed chowmein gravy. Trust me the quantity was huge. And lastly for side dish we took hong kong chicken. Hong kong chicken was pretty average. The chicken pieces were were perfectly cooked. But i was a little dissapointed in the gravy. Overall a good dining experience.

Elgin is basically storehouse of Tibetan delicacies with so many famous momo places here!
So I tried this place on a weekday, looks very impressive from outside though but once you get inside it...it kind of looks very shabby, dull..n moreover it was empty!
I ordered a simple pan fried pork momo.
They took half an hour to serve that. Such poor service, with untrained staffs.
Momo was edible but that gravy they served was really odd...they served sweet tomato garlic instead of schezwan.
Pocket pinch is on the lighter side.
****Recommended only when you wanna try a new restro!

A place to have Veg steamed momos if the roadside stall at exide crossing is closed..the fried momos are strictly No No as thay are full of oil and not fried properly..the ambience is murky and unhygenic..service is like any roadside hotel..the Sauce is too spicy for comfort..and mind you no soup for vegeterians..veggies please avoid..

Elgin is basically storehouse of Tibetan delicacies with so many famous momo places here!
So I tried this place on a weekday, looks very impressive from outside though but once you get inside it...it kind of looks very shabby, dull..n moreover it was empty!
I ordered a simple pan fried pork momo.
They took half an hour to serve that. Such poor service, with untrained staffs.
Momo was edible but that gravy they served was really odd...they served sweet tomato garlic instead of schezwan.
Pocket pinch is on the lighter side.
****Recommended only when you wanna try a new restro!

Come here for the Pork Thukpa. The best according to me in this area. Thick soup base, which tastes great, with generous amount of pork, veggies and noodles. Also the Mixed Singapore Gravy noodles is my favourite here. Its hot and spicy. 

Price is a bit higher than my other favourite Tibetan Delight, but the quantity, here too, is good. 

Ambiance is absolutely basic and service is generally fast as never found this place too crowded. Another reason why I love this place. While to eat at most of the other places you will have to stand in a queue, here I can just walk in, occupy an empty table and order my favourite thukpa.

Just now went in there and ordered a couple of plates of Chicken momos for takeaway, the place was so dirty as if it was never wiped, insects and cockroaches were running around on the tables and the sauce bowls that were kept open, the momo was good but along with Chicken momos they had packed baby cockroaches as well, thanks god they did not charge me for that. very poor..... will never ever go there neither will recommend anyone ever.

Had gone to Elgin looking to try some Tibetan cuisine as an alternative to Hamro momo, but was terribly disappointed at the quality of the food at this joint.  Neither the plan fried momo nor the Singaporean chow mein was up to the mark with the chicken being pretty cold and undercooked. A definite no-go for me taking into consideration the price also being on the steeper side as compared to many others.

It's just beside momo plaza,another popular momo joint. 
Tried chicken saucee momo and pork saucee momo.
Taste wise - not what I expected it to be. Felt like had a bowl full of gravy which not at all spicy but very mild.
Ambience - well nothing to describe much.
Staff - well,the staff was cordial and courteous.
Overall experience - 2/5

I was wanting to have nice Tibetan cuisines and after walking down from forum mall area I had three to four options for good and reasonable food so hopped in restaurants and witnessed a huge line of folks waiting so decided to enter ORCHID as it was almost empty and its just beside momo plaza .
I remembered some fond memories of initial days I used to visit this place and it is still looking the same and almost no scope of improvement is there I assume as what it looks like now is seriously very dull and boring and sadly not an happening place anymore with such an ambience I never like to eat nor like to suggest anyone to eat however if there is no option this place can be considered occasionally maybe just for certain foods that is prepared here which possible gets the crowd coming here so thanks to that I guess .

Ok now let me tell you exactly what I ordered and how was it like .

1) Chicken steam momos with soup
2) Chicken fried momos with soup
3) Chicken thuppa

THE CHICKEN STEAM MOMOS were served within minutes which is a good thing as service wise they were fast but the momos lacked the strength of flavour as well as stuffing wasn't loaded full inside and the outer portion was soft but not enjoyable whether you dip it with the sauce or not it just taste nothing great nor proper at all .

THE CHICKEN FRIED MOMOS were looking very dark I assume it was over cooked than it usually is but there wasn't any burnt smell so can be the possiblity its made that way so I won't judge that part , so moving on the inner stuffings were a little more better and filled properly than the steam momos which is quite ok and tasted just fine too . Also the soups which came along were clear soups which were hot and filled up to the brim of the soup bowls .

THE CHICKEN THUPPA was a mix of noodles, veggies ,soup and chicken small slices made in a mixture of ingredients had tasted the best among the three things i had tried as the chicken thuppaa was loaded with carrots , onions to cauliflower and the chicken pieces were generously filled from top to bottom .
Also the gravy was thick and full nicely served in a cute bowl which is truly worth eating as it gave me a sign of relief after the momos had ditched my expectations .

The bottomline is that you will probably like certain things to eat from here considering the dim ambience as I personally won't visit until I hear or see any changes in the coming days .

It is one of the 3 outlets situated in the same location famous for the Tibetan and Chinese cuisine. However, I guess, that this particular outlet is the least popular among the three. Firstly the ambiance is not at all of that of a restaurant. We went to this only after finding long queues in the other restaurants. Surprisingly there were not a single diner inside. The food preparation area is also fully visible from where you sit. Food quality was average although we expected a lot worse seeing the footfall. However, fried momos were only the exception of getting excellent remarks. Talking of the service, you get it better in the street side stalls. Pricing is okay.

Had fish fry and chicken steamed momo over here after office. Its a normal ,shabby , hangout place. At around 6.30 we were the only customers here. Service pretty slow. Ambience nothing great. It is situated after crossing Momo Plaza. The soup that was served with momo lacked evrything including salt. They could have been a competition to Momo Plaza if they can increse their level in food, taste, quality and service.

A pocket friendly place, serving ordinary stuff. They are not too keen on maintaining cleanliness or hygiene factor. It's a small space, almost like a lane, with some seating arrangement at the extreme end. The momos are pretty ordinary. I didn't find the stuffing inside good and filling, also the soup served along with the momo was absolutely tasteless. I ordered pork momo but it hardly tasted like pork. Chicken momo was better though. They have to bring their level up by some degree if they wish to compete with their neighbor, Momo Plaza.

Direction: Take the Fifth Element lane, beside Momo Plaza.

Not very keen on taking care of hygiene but somehow if you are looking for a pocket friendly place you can come here for a quick bite.  Even its good for a friendly gathering. 
Food is average though the service was fast. Drawback- no ac .. You may feel bit suffocated.
If you like momo plaza you may like this too..

If you are in Elgin and are looking for a great Tibetan place, then Orchid and Tibetan Delight are your options!
The latter might take away the crown but Orchid isn't bad either!

Try both, the steamed and pan fried momos!
The quantity of the noodles is ample for two!
Also good are their chicken starter dishes :)

I ended up in this eatery not by choice but because i was unable to get a table in my preferred choice. First of all the seating area is very shady and not at all suitable during the summers as it is very stuffy and humid. They have plastic chairs and tables in place for dine in. We wanted to order Momo's but was told that it would take 30 mins for it to get prepared but sadly even after being in there for an hour, it was not ready for the customers. The Gravy chowmein that we ordered was very mediocre and somewhat bland but the worst part was hardly any chicken or prawn was put in the dish. It's a serious crime in my book if you charge a hefty price for a below average item without the ingridients that you paid for. The Chicken Salt & Pepper was relatively better but still falls short on the tasty meter. The serving time once again is disappointing. Overall avoid this place since there a quite a few good options nearby in the same price range.

This is one place one must go to if you want to ruin your day! First of all the decor, well its dark, dinghy, sooty, sultry and downright uncomfortable with no ventilation whatsoever. The tables and plates look dirty and careworn. The person taking your orders is dressed more shabbily than the average street urchin.
We ordered a pan fried chicken momo, a veg fried rice and a schezwan fish for the two of us. The chicken momo was soggy with hardly any chicken. It looked big though. The accompanying soup was well, water with cornflower slowly sedimenting slowly and nothing else.
The veg fried rice was oily and under cooked. The fish consisted of 5 small pieces in an extremely salty broth and not worth commenting on.
Except the fried rice portions are small, price on the higher side for a non ac place and service slow.
Not coming back to this place. Ever!

Like many reviews here, momos here are really good. Quantity of food is enough for 2 people to share, and it's value for money. But I am highly disappointment with the decor, ambience, and services. Huge improvement is required in these fronts if the management wants its customers to return. Hence, I am giving a modest 2 stars only for the food.

The steamed momo was very ordinary and not at all worth the price. Though the pan fried momo was tasty, it was just steamed momo with a tangy sauce. It was nothing close to "pan fried".

It monsoon here in the city of joy and the two of us were hungry for some pan fried momos. Orchid floated up through the Zomato app, and was finalized within moments.

★ LOCATION : Situated just at the mouth of Elgin road. Take the road along Chai Break (Elgin Road) and Orchid will be on the right after a minute of walking.

★ AMBIANCE : From the entrance, a dark corridor led to the seating area. It was dark, pretty shabby and most importantly, REALLY hot. There was no air conditioning system inside, and the fans inside weren't enough to cool us down.

★ FOOD : The first time we came here, in 2014, the pan fried chicken momos were lipsmacking and steamed momos equally delicious. 

The scene seemed to have changed in June '15. The steamed momos weren't as good as before. To make it worse, the pan fried momos were actually steamed momos in a nice tangy sauce. Although it tasted good, but the momos were definitely NOT pan-fried!

★ PRICES : The prices seemed a little steep for the food served. 
Cost for two - ₹300+.

When hunger had hit us hard in the stomach Orchid seemed like an oasis in the midst of a desert. Orchid will offer you nothing close to a fine dining experience. The shabby and dingy restaurant is rather informal and raved about for its tantalising     delicacies. We ordered Egg Hakka Noodles and Chilli Fish. The food did not impress me much. I have had tastier food at other places that are within the same price range. While we were absorbed in our conversation , my friend with a mouthful of food uttered " Oh SHIT!!!" I saw him lifting up the pepper container which had a BABY COCKROACH camouflaged in it! YES, I  HAD SPRINKLED THAT COCKROACH INFESTED PEPPER ON TO MY FOOD!! We complained to the man available there. DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF YOU GET FOOD POISONING OR STOMACH INFECTIONS AFTER EATING THERE!! 
Sadly for us ORCHID was a mirage and not an oasis!!

Orchid has become synonymous with delicious and steaming hot momo. Everyone keeps raving about their pork momo and their Chinese dishes. 
Personally I find the place highly unhygienic, seating area is dark and dingy. Their momos taste like rubber with lots of onions. 
More or less people have a high opinion of this place because it has been around for years and maybe at some point of time when there weren't so many good places to choose from Orchid ruled the Kolkata circuits with their momos and maybe they were good at some point of time.
Now they serve really bad food.
Last time I was there we ordered two plates of chicken steamed momo and one fried momo, they were more than horrible. Pepper chicken was decent but again the chicken pakoras were ..well not seasoned properly but chunks of deep fried batter. The tables and chairs are old, the water jugs placed on the table are ancient and I wonder from time to time whether they even get washed once in a while. 
The sauces placed on the table doesn't get changed, it remains there for people to taste them and I wonder whether they even change the spoon. 
Fine the price is good but to save some extra cash I ain't going to compromise on the quality of food. 
It's filthy and dirty and the owners don't even try to renovate this place to make it a little decent. 
I personally have quite a low opinion of this place can't say about others. Not going back here for sure.

This restaurant is near to my office so we often come here in the evenings. It is located very close to the Rabindra Sadan metro station, opposite to the P. C. Chandra entrance near The Fifth Element and Chai Break. Take the road towards Brand Factory, it is on your right hand side. This restaurant has so many landmarks that there's no way you can miss it. Now comes the main part. I will jot down the pros and cons below:

Pros:
1. Familiar ambience. Like one of those old coffee shops in town.
2. Inexpensive food.
3. Quality momos and Thukpas.
4. Special recommendation: Try their Chicken Fried Momo; we order two plates for each, every time. 
5. Come here for pork craving. You won't regret the decision.

Cons:

1. Takes time to prepare the food.
2. Avoid their chicken pakoras. Very disappointing.
3. Not every item on the menu cards is available all the time.
4. Avoid their Chicken Pan Fried momo if you are not too fond of momos dipped in a hot and spicy sauce that numbs your taste buds.

Conclusion: Event though there are Hamro momo and Momo Plaza right beside this place, we keep coming back here for certain  items they offer. They may not be the best but they are unavoidable.

This is another tibetian restaurant in kolkata that serves authentic tibetian food. This is a good restaurant and apart from the momos and the thukpas, they also serve very nice fish items, which one should try if she/he visits this place

This place is one of my most favoured places when momos are concerned. Though the city has recently come up with some good momo joints, all sophisticated ,polished with innovative momo dishes,this place has still got a charm of its own. Situated neat rabindra sadan metro just opposite to chai break and just beside momo plaza,it is extremely easy to locate. Starting with the negativity,the restaurant is a letdown when ambience is concerned. The sitting arrangement is very ordinary, with plastic chairs and tables and there is nothing worth mentioning about the decor. There are some wall mounted tubelights with a small christmas tree and the lighting is quite dark.But when it comes to food,the restaurant deserves a big thumbs up. Orchid should be visited just for their momos. Their 'authentic' steamed chicken momos are just a delight to the taste buds. I just can't get enough of it. I have almost tried all their momos and never for once did I have anything to complain. The momos are soft,filled with ample chicken and the outer texture is quite moist and not dry and leathery. Among the other dishes served, dry chilli chicken is my another favourite. The gravy of the dry chilli chicken is just delicious. It has a nice mixture of tangy and chilli taste and this is a 'must order' dish whenever I visit this place.Their fried momos are also quite palatable however I feel there is a slight lack of taste in the fried momos and they are a bit too deeply fried. The price is in balance with the quality of the food served. However during my last two visits i felt that the quantity of food served has reduced compared to the price,which I feel is incorrect. However if one can just cope up with a little shabby place but at the cost of great food(specially momos) orchid is a must visit for foodies,specially momo lovers.

we can say hamro-good,orchid-better and tibetean delight-best.
Momos are brilliant here but slightly bad to taste at times.maybe a bit of extra frying in a pan-fried spoils the mood

Location: Adjacent to Momo Plaza; Opposite Chai Break (Elgin).

This eatery was visited last evening, i.e. on February 11, 2015 along with a couple of colleagues while returning from office.
The AMBIANCE here seemed quite shabby and was lit by the wall-mounted lights running across the whole stretch and a big chinese lantern in the middle of the ceiling. There were plastic chairs and tables as arrangements for seating.
We proceeded with our ORDER of steamed Momos (Veg, Chicken and Pork for me and my colleagues respectively) which was delivered on our table after a long wait of twenty minutes. The momos [5 pieces] were steaming hot.

- The flavorful filling of the momo (Veg) consisted of cabbage, carrot, onions and a punch of pepper. The wrap around was found to be thick which became chewy on getting cold.
- The sauce along was spicy and complimented well.
- Clear soup was available only along with non-veg momos.

The STAFF was polite and friendly, but the SERVICE was found to be too slow.
PRICES felt a pinch with respect to the quantity.

Overall was an average experience.

Good momo. Went there with my friends once. The place is a little dimly lit and the restaurant is not an epitome of cleaniness. However service was good and the momos tasted alright. Price was a little more than we expected, but on a second thought may be the quantity compensates for that kind of pricing.

Hamros was down, and we were hungry, so visited this joint and ordered pork momo, chicken fried rice and chilli pork.
The momo was, no doubt, great. The sauce was good too. But, the price was little high (80 bucks). There was nothing special about the fried rice, regular taste. But, the chili pork was a disappointment! They just served cubes of pork fat in the name of pork. I had to ask them to replace that, but instead of making that over again, they brought a plate of hard pork which looked like chilli pork and said they made it again for us. We couldn't eat it anymore, it was awful. Really disappointed with the place. 
Only the momo is worth giving this joint a shot.

Went to this place on 25th Dec with friends and cousin. It had decent seating arrangements! There were plastic tables and chairs. We ordered pan friend momo and mixed chow mein. While we waited for the food I was joking how no one can mess up pan friend momos. But when our pan fried momo arrived I realised you can actually mess up pan fried momos! The sauce was literally tomato sauce and nothing else! They put simple tomato sauce on top of steamed momos and called it pan fried. Chow mein was decent but still well below average. 2 plate pan friend momo and 2 plate mixed chow cost us ₹ 500
₹500 for that food quality!! It was a complete waste. Not going back to that place again

My first visit to Kolkata, and the first food outing was Otchid. And I must say, the journey in Kolkata started on a good note. We had different kinds of Momos, steamed & pan-fried. And those were undoubtedly some of the best Momos I have ever had. The red chutney too was authentically spicy. Then place is offers great value for money as well. Ambience-wise, for any other metro I would have said it was average. But guess Kolkata operates differently.

My first "momo"place.wel, there r a few others in d same locale, but its only at orchid that I find everything in its right form.......d taste, quantity, pricing, service.D only minus point is its "non ac"factor.talking of food, it has to be the pork preparations.pork momo, double roast pork, chilli pork and lots more.d only thing apart from d pork which can hold its place at d level is d "Chinese fish fry".

Orchid situated in Elgin road opposite Chai Break and Fifth element used to be a very good place if you were looking for good quality momos and for that matter good quality Chinese and Tibetan food.But over the years this place has declined quite a bit.Now they are just about average and there are many better options available.The momos are still pretty soft and decent but the filling inside contains less of the main ingredient and more of onions and cabbages these days.The main course items are no where near what it used to be.There is nothing called as ambience.It is still a non ac joint.There is narrow corridor leading to a rather spacious main area of the restaurant.But the dim lighting and the lack of an ac do not do this place any favours what so ever.The prices are may be a little less than other places but the low prices have definitely come at the cost of quality.

When I was a kid, I was introduced to momos by my mother - the place was Hamro Momo in Elgin Road. It was economical and best.
Over time, Hamro Momo lost out to the joints which opened next to it - one of them being Orchid. Of the lot, probably the best place to have momos in Elgin Road nowadays is Orchid.
The momos are fine. Also try out the Mongolian Chicken over there - that's pretty good too along with the chowmein.

I visit this place whenever I get an opportunity because of my absolute love for momo. The place is still not air conditioned and seats hardly 32 people at at a time but the food is quite delicious and more importantly its pocket-friendly. Also it serves pork! I love the chicken steamed and fried momo and the double fried pork. If u r famished and need bulky food u can try the mixed hakka chow with any side dish. They serve good quantities within a decent price.

This used to be my regular momo place over the years, till I stopped going there some years back, because I figured the neighbours were less expensive and better. I walked in this hot afternoon looking for a suitable respite and I was not impressed.

The place is still the same... a corridor that opens into a larger room. They both have tables. The same gentleman was manning the stop. It was empty at 1.15, they packing up some food for takeaways.

I asked for a pork steam momo. It got me five pretty small pieces. These were reheated, and therefore the thick cover seemed thicker and was dry. There was very little filling and it seemed mostly onion. Overall it was tasteless and on the saltier side. The accompanying broth was mostly water and spring onion! Bleh!

The cold Thumsup was welcome, but it warmed way too fast. Them being a non-airconditioned outlet kind of hastened the process.

I asked for a pork item and was recommended the Special Roast Pork. It was not bad, thin slices of reasonably lean pork with onion and capsicum. Was not too spicy at all.

Service was reasonably quick, and mercifully it was not too warm inside. The prices are no longer much more than the neighbours, but in the process it is the quality that seems to have suffered.

Absolutely not impressed. I was there to taste the food only so I did not pay any attention to the decor and ambiance. The service was lightning fast as they were able to serve me with mixed rice, special roasted pork and double fried pork within 13 minutes (yes, I was watching the time constantly). Now coming to the food, they skipped pork in the mixed rice. Otherwise it was so-so, nothing extraordinary. The special roasted pork was extremely sweet. But that being a signature dish, one should not complain about its taste. The double fried pork was anything but double fried pork. It was insanely sweet. In general, all the dishes were pretty sweet which is against my taste. So, sorry I did not enjoy the dinner. However, I am thinking of giving it a try again for momos. But other than that, I don't think.

First time when i entered this restro, i thought it was a coffeshop. Ambiance and decor is realy casual. But when when it comes to food they are realy serious.
We started with roasted pork, After that we had mixed noodles, mixed rice chili pork, chicken with babycorn. Service time taken to serve the food around 10 minuters, a priety good service. Portion size of food is quite enough for two people. Taste is realy good specialy noodles and roasted pork. We paid 1000 rs after having all this including soft drinks. No extra hidden charges, a value for money restro.

Located between momo plaza and hamro, orchid serves up some amazing Chinese and Tibetan preparations !!!

I wanted to try it since quite a while but somehow always ended up in other two outlets mentioned above . It's got a very narrow corridoor but to my surprise place is  spacious inside though AC is not present inside that becomes a problem during summers. The dining area is clean and tidy. Prices of momo seemed a bit high to me but for Chinese food, it was quite reasonable. The staff seemed polite and courteous.

Coming to food, momos were pretty good but a tad expensive when I could have better momos at hamro for cheaper price. The pepper sauce served alongside was really good. I also had a plate of garlic hakka noodles that was prepared really well and I just gulped it in a span of 4 mins at the top. 

I feel i tried the place bit late but really looking  forward to sample other items on the menu !!!!

Last week we were in the mood for some good Tibetan fare and headed down to Elgin Road. Having heard a lot about Orchid and its glorious days, we decided to give this place a try. The ambience is nothing to write home about, service is a bit slow. We ordered for the Chicken TomYum Soup, Chicken Steamed Momos and the Special Roast Pork. The tomyum soup was tangy and flavourful, and helped my sore throat to no end, and I ended up enjoying the soup immensely. However, the momos were a big let down for me, having heard so much about the momos here. They were mostly thick layers of flour batter with very little and bland stuffing inside. I wonder if it was just a bad day or if the quality of momos has really deteriorated. The pork was however tangy and to my liking, though the Mister didn't really have much to say about it. Prices are pretty reasonable. I wish they would beef up the momos a bit, and increase the prices a notch if necessary. But for a place which is famous for its momos, this restaurant was a big let down. 3 from me, mostly for the yummy tomyum soup.

Orchid - 

I have such fond memories of this restaurant, I used to go here with my dad as a daily escape from our vegetarian household. Used to love the Momos and specially the clear soup that accompanies it. The chilli sauce to accompany is one of the best chilli sauces I have had ever. The vegetarian momos are also quite delicious unlike most places. The decor is pretty standard but 1 thing that always kept me attracted when I go there is the Led board which shows their specialties and dishes of the day. 
What makes this place even better is the person who used to serve us 10 years back is still there and recognises me when I go there,, so I have an emotional attachment to the restaurant.

Opinion - Of Momo Plaza and Orchid , Orchid is definitely the place with better quality Momo's and since its less crowded, better customer service.

This place brings back so much old memories from college days. In that area, it is one of the better place for thukpa and momos (the others being Hamro momo and one unnamed one inside a small bylane).

We used to visit this place when we were a little indulgent and could afford the pricier stuff. The food was always good, though I never had the usual Chinese stuff (noodles and chilly chicken kind of stuff) over there. The taste has more or less remained the same. The thukpa is still a big bowl full stuffed with generous amount of meat and vegetable pieces. Especially wonderful is the mixed thukpa that has everything from pork, chicken and prawn. The momos nowadays do not taste as good as before, but is still quite decent compared to the ones available elsewhere. If anybody wants nice décor, then this is not the place. Many will not consider the place to be even hygienic. But then for tasty food at that price, the décor goes just fine.

Thukpas are a must have in this place. Momos always will be a good accompaniment to it. There are far better and affordable places to have Chinese food. In all, I’ll keep going back to them for the Tibetan food.

"Chicken Steamed momo with Clear Soup" and "Pan fried momo" are two main dishes that you must try here. This a place where you can gather with friends have momos, thupka, Chopsuey, Sanghai Chicken(dry is best) in a short time and leave the place with pleased mind and full stomach and less wallet weight loss. Don't go there for decor go there for food! :)

On a rainy day, when the breeze brings along just the right amount of chill for you to sit down with some hot steaming soup, Orchid is the place you should try. 
It's a small eatery, very near the Elgin Road exit of Rabindra Sadan station, and offers nothing elaborate in it's decor.
But....the food.....the food itself is every reason to be there. The steaming momos with clear soup are a perfect addition to a day filled with dark clouds or pouring rain.
Try it out. It's worth it.

Momos are really very well done....the three to four chinese restaurants opposite the lane of Brand Factory at Elgin Road are some of the good chinese restaurants in city... Ambience is very ordinary,,,not something gr8. The other chinese dishes like fried rice and preparations of chicken are very delicious and tasty....sitting arrangement is available for almost 15 to 20 people probably but it is better to have food by sitting inside your car. Staff are well-behaved and food expenses are affordable, quantity is immense too. 
3.5 from my side.

Orchid is a good place for momos. They have several varieties on offer, and all of them are good. That is not true for most of the other items on the menu, which serve as padding to a list that would otherwise contain momos alone.

The service is slow, but the waiters are polite and attentive. The decor is not top-class, and the restaurant would be better off with a coat of paint. The basin for customers should also stand in a cleaner place.

An interesting item on offer is the Saucee Momo (available in vegetarian, chicken and pork varieties), which consists of a number of steamed momos served in a bowl of sauce, which is essentially a thick gravy with finely chopped vegetables. Along with the clear soup that is served with all momo dishes, it is a meal in itself.

I am all for the pork here, as well as for the momos. Personally I find the kothays here really good, and the pan fried momos are quite nice too. I love the roast pork fried rice as well. The double fried pork (yes, I am giggling as I say it because its so ridiculously fattening and delicious that you will be giggling too when you eat it) is AMAZING.

However, minus points for service, which is slow, to say the very least.

This place needs more publicity. So here Im doing my bit! Orchid. Easy to miss, this little place is located on the lane, opposite to Brand factory main entrance on elgin road, close to sambhunath pandit hospital. Orchid is one place where people from all over calcutta would go JUST for the food. There have an ambiance, one that many may not appreciate. Dim tooni-bulb lights, shabby bluish green walls, plastic chairs and tables, mostly crowded. One may park their car outside and order for food as well. They serve Chinese and Tibetan food.

A must order is the special roast pork priced at Rs 131 per plate. Spicy, tangy and delicious. Good quality meat and good portions. Besides that, I would recommend its momos, they also serve momos in a spicy sauce (too spicy for me)...but some of you may really love this one! Dont like the soup they serve with the momos though. Service is good. A snack for two would be around Rs 300.

This is a very small eatery near Exide/rabindra sadan. The shop is in a small bylane and chances are that you would miss it. The ambiance of this place is not worthy of mentioning however that is not so for the food. This place serves some quite delicious chinese & tibetan food. The Momo's, thuppa's and gravy chowmein's are wonderful. But for me the highlight of this place is the excellent pork dishes it serves. The pork dishes are just fantastic..be it the chilly pork or pork momo/thuppa. If you are a pork lover..then this place is a must for you. Very easy on the pocket. Service is fair. All in all a good place.

Have been to this place a couple of times. The food quality and quantity is good. The ambiance is nice, like that of Momo plaza.The momo and soups are good.. except the Sweet Corn Chicken Soup. I love the Chicken Lung Fu Soup and Talomen Soup.
