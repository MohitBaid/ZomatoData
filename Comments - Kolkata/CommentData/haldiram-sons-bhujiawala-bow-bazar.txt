Excellent place for pure veg foodies. The place is neat and clean. Staff were polite and decent. Food is served pretty quick. Paw bhaji, milk shakes and chaats are a must try!

Location is just beside Cesc Building opposite to Paradise Cinema. 
I have been here before too for takeaways of my office purpose but this time it was personal takeaway.
Tried their Gulab Jamun, Dhokla and other sweets and they were all good and fresh. Haldirams never compromise with their quality and as per this place is concerned they are very up for it.

A well known name, when it comes to North Indian sweets and snack, their most popular item is probably Kaju Barfi. Some of the other well garnished and decorated sweets too sees a good demand. Located close to Hind Cinema, this is a decent option for a quick snack incase one was felling hungry.

Located at busy area of Bow bazar this Haldirams outlet serves all the signature items this brand sells.  Got my favorite kesar laddus from here which was fresh and tasty as usual. Also my eternal love for kaju barji always ignites whenever I get into any of their outlets. I quite liked their behaviour as well all in all an useful outlet.

I frequently drop here for their Kaju Bari and Laddu. Their Kaju Barfis are good in taste, perfect mixture of Sugar and Kaju. Laddus are also decent in size and quality. Located about 4-5mins walk from Hind Cinema towards Chadni Chawk Metro, this place is worth visiting.
