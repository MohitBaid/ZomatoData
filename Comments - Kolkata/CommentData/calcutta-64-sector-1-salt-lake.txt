Location- as you come out of the exit gate of CC1 take a left, head straight till you see this cafe on your left(this is the gate towards BATA shoe store)

Decor- A simple, elegant and sophisticated decor with comfortable wooden chairs, lights and paintings on the wall(paintings which are there for sale-good strategy there).

Food and Menu-They have cafe regulars like sandwiches, burgers, pizzas, shakes as well as some continental main courses too.

We had a chocolate shake, a choco frappe, one grilled chicken burger and one BBq Chicken burger and I was in love with the burgers clearly as I never order a second burger anywhere and here I did.

The shake too was a great one and so was the frappe.

Cost- very affordable and one of those rare places who give you great value for money and do not overcharge you.

Service & Staff- The service was quick and the staff were very friendly.

The only thing they would need is some more space as at present they have a capacity of 15-20 people hardly, although this cannot stop me from giving them a full 5 out of 5!

Calcutta 64 is one of the most happening cafes in saltlake. It is a small and cosy cafe with just 4 tables located near 3no island. The food over here is great and the staffs are pretty much quick. I would recommend people to try out this one those who havent.
We ordered pasta in pink sauce, mexican grilled chicken and one BBQ fish. 
All of the dishes were really good.

In one word, it's a very good place for hangout. Tastes are really awesome of each item. I have ordered smoky chicken and cheese wrap, BBQ chicken, Baked tandoori chicken pizza. Smoky chicken cheese wrap is too good & yummy. Pizza was well toasted, very thin crust. I have taken two drinks i.e. Green apple soda & Virgin mojito (barbeque nation best). Both are good. In dessert section i have taken caramel custard and double chocolate brownie. Double chocolate brownie was good.
Place is little tiny. Only 14 seating arrangement is there inside the restaurant. 
Ambience is very good. Once you visit there you have to come again and again.

I visited this place with one of my friend..this place is located in saltlake city sector 1 BC block..
The oulet has both indoor and outdoor seating..and the inside is very beautifully decorated..
The stuff is very helpful and cooperative..
We ordered 
1. Lemon ice tea
2.smoky chicken & cheese wrap
3.Grilled chicken steak
 Lemon ice tea was refreshing.. and the smoky chicken & cheese wrap was served with mayonnaise..and its was full of vegetables ..
However the steak was bit dry but it was complimenting the soggyness of mashed potato..
Overall the place is really good ..

I think these guys took the phrase 'Less is more too seriously' ! The place is too crammed up. The d√©cor is simple and nice but there is barely place to move.
The plus point is, the food is reasonable and tasty. The server took forever to bring our dishes but overall not a bad experience.

5.PRAWNS IN CHILLI LEMON SAUCE 
6.GARLIC CHICKEN SANDWICH

The tandoori pizza tasted just out of the world so as the fish and chips.One of the best fish and chips , I'hve had in the recent times. 
The double chocolate walnut brownie was pure heaven, do not miss out on this as it was amazing .
Now coming to their coffee ,being an ardent caffeine addict ,I could not miss out on their cafe and trust me they make the most amazing coffees in saltlake. Do try.

Calcutta 64 is one of the fine cafe that is located in sector 1,salt lake.
The place is great to hang out with friends. Highly impressed by the outdoor seating arrangement and the fine interior decor and the greatly affordable prices of the menu items made me today to write this review. The service was too good and the owner also had a conversation with us. A lovely interaction over food.
We ordered for some starter's which included 
_fish and chips : The fish was fresh and soft. And the outing layer was neither too hard . It was soft and crispy.

_tandoori pizza : The great cheesy burst along with veggies tasted amazing. The appropriate amount of cheese tasted too good. 

_baked tandoori fish : Freshly baked fish tasted good in tandoori flavours and spicy a bit on taste.

In drinks we ordered for the 
_mango shake. The best shake of mango I had in this non mango season.The thick taste of mango is rare to find in this winter season though.

Apart from starter's and drinks we had 
_prawns in chilly lemon sauce : The big sized prawn was unexpected. The chilly lemon sauce is one of the RECOMMENDED item from this place. The rice was served with boiled vegetables. Too good to have it all.

We ordered for Double Chocolate walnut brownie with ice cream is one of the RECOMMENDED too. The soft brownies tasted amazing with the icecream scoop on the top.

Service was good. The place was decorated well and the staffs greeted us too.
Had a wonderful experience ‚ù§Ô∏è

What a place!! Amazing. This place is without a doubt one the best for food lovers. The presentation the taste the class the everything about these dishes are luscious. A rating beyond 5 Star would be the best possible way to define the standard of this menu. Located at BC 25, Sector 1, Salt Lake. 

Every bite was bursting with flavors and every next bite you would discover a dash of this or a dash of that oozing out on the taste buds. The food, ambiance and service all are praise worthy. These people know the stuff they are doing and everyone in their team make sure customer feels like king.

I visited this place with a group of friends for early lunch before college. I was instantly impressed by the outdoor seating arrangement that greeted its customers, in addition to the indoor dining space. Wanting to have food amidst fresh air, we decided to sit outside. And Boy, it was amazing! The decor is awesome. The view is perfect. The interior is also very beautifully decorated. Overall ambiance is very soothing. We ordered a number of dishes.

We ordered Lemon Ginger Soda and Mango Shake. The soda was too refreshing; the mango shake was sweet and delicious.
For starters, we went for Fish and chips. The fish was soft and well-cooked.¬†
For the main course, we ordered a medium baked tandoori pizza and prawns in chili lemon sauce. The pizza was very filling and yummy! The prawn dish was beyond perfect !!!
Lastly, we ordered Double chocolate walnut brownie with scoop of ice-cream for dessert. It was the perfect ending to a sumptuous lunch.

I found the staff to be extremely efficient and well-informed. One thing that stands out about this place is that the food is really very cheap and affordable, on top of which the quantity and quality are extremely impressive!

Calcutta 64 is a great place to dine or hangout with friends which is located very near to the 3 no Island in Saltlake,sector1.Visited this place today with bunch of friends for lunch. The ambience is pretty cool, outdoor seating is also available.

In food, Garlic chicken sandwich was good to start with, it‚Äôs delicious, a recommended one.

I really liked the Mango shake, it‚Äôs mesmerizing.

Fish and Chips were awesome in taste.

Coffee lovers should try the Vanilla Latte, it‚Äôs excellent.

Pasta was tantalizing, a recommended one of them.

Tandoori pizza was enjoyable.

Lemon ginger soda was an appropriate choice after a heavy starter session, it‚Äôs terrific.

Baked Tandoori fish was over the top, another recommended one of them.

In main course, Prawns in chilli lemon sauce was splendid, it‚Äôs flavorful and appealing, surely a recommended one of them.

We have tried the Double chocolate walnut brownie with scoop of ice cream in dessert and trust me heavenly feeling it was, yummy and wonderful.

A noticeable thing for Calcutta 64 is that, all the dishes are budget friendly which is a very key thing for the youngster like us.

Overall the lunch was Wonderful! We will be back for sure! Thank you so much Calcutta 64 for making our lunch so special!

This place is definately worth trying and i mean it guys. From service to food, everything was perfect. Located in Sector1, went there with my friends and trust me guys i couldn't be more happier and delighted. Its pocket-friendly and food being lip-smacking. What else do you need? 
Beverages:
Lemon ginger soda- very refreshing. The slight hint of ginger flavour definately gives a unique taste to the drink.
Mango Shake- this was yummm. Loved it
Vanilla Latte- cold wintery days and some hot vanilla latte. Perfect combination. I enjoyed it very much.

Starters & Main Course:
Medium Baked tandoori pizza- highly recommended. Packed with flavours and loaded with cheesy goodness, i loved it. Beautiful.
Fish & chips- crunchy and crispy outside and soft and fresh fish inside. Just wow.
Baked tandoori fish- yet another delicious dish. 
Prawns in chilli lemon sauce- highly highly recommended. An extremely delicious dish. The beautiful herbed rice and the oh-so-beautiful succulent soft prawns in chili lemon sauce- match made in heaven combination.
Garlic chicken sandwich- yumm yumm yummm. Being a sandwich lover, i absolutely loved this dish. 
Desserts:
Double chocolate walnut brownie with scoop of icecream- deadly combination. The brownie was dark,goey and fudgy. Beautiful.
Perfect place for hangout,date,meeting or any kind of treats. Definately gonna visit this place again.

Visited this place today with friends. The place is small with a seating capacity if around 15 people inside and 8 people outside. The interior is quite amazing. We opted to sit outside as the weather was pleasant. We ordered for Pasta. The dish had little nuts with a peanut butter flavor and yeah, I loved it. Then came Fish and Chips. This is one of the best cutlets that I have ever had. We ordered Mango Shake and Lemon Ginger. The mocktails made me fall in love with them. Yes, they were fantastic. The Cheesy Medium Baked Tandoori Pizza was great in taste but the Baked Tandoori fish wasn't too good. It had a sweet tangy taste. The Vanilla latte and it's mesmerizing presentation was pleasing and the Prawn in Chili Lemon Sauce was too good. Being a prwan lover i will surely have it the next tym when i visit.
Last but not the least was the Double Chocolate Walnut Brownie with icecream. Someone had truly said, "Life is uncertain, eat dessert first". The dessert justified the line.
Im surely visiting the place again.

For someone with a terrible road sense, I would conveniently say that this place is located close to cc1, at a walking distance, that too. It's a very small caf√© serving a fair bit of very caf√©-ish dishes. We ordered 2 pastas and 2 pizzas and a few sodas. The BBQ fish is a must try. I loved it! 
The green apple soda is a delicious drink to try as well. Prices are nominal.

It was on my wishlist for long time, finally I got chance to visit this small and cozy cafe located at easily accessible place in Salt lake. This cafe is almost 10 mins walk from City Centre and very close (around 5 mins walk) to 3 Number Island.

This is very small food joint with 14 sitting capacity inside and around 16 outside. Ambiance is very good and festive. Staffs were really very polite but service was little slow that is why I reduced .5 rating in this review.

Now coming to food.

Mochaccino: Very well presented in a cup made of glass. Taste was really good and not expensive too. Their beverages starts from 50 bucks which is really affordable.

Pasta with Pink Sauce: It was really yummy and cheesy. Taste was up to the mark. I took prawn option but quantity of prawns were very less. It comes with 2 small pieces of garlic gourmet bread. I would suggest to cut the bread little more thicker which will increase the taste.

California Orange Salsa Prawns: Taste was outstanding. Fried rice served along was also nice. They served some saute veggies which was very less in quantity. The platter was looking very cheap because of the portion size of veggies.

It is really a must visit place and I would like to visit again because the taste of the food is really commendable.

It's been on my "Cafes to be Visited" list for a long time and finally it's been ticked off.Yesterday I visited this place with my friend .At first when we reached the Place at 12 noon,they were just setting up( though it's mentioned that they open at 11:30 AM ) so we had to come back later. It located near CC1 . the place is really small .14 people can be accommodated at most inside the Cafe.Though they have have outdoor sitting as well. The place is cute and well decorated. Coming to the food we tried their Hot Choco Latte and Grilled Chicken Pizza . The Latte was really well presented but tasted a bit like Bournvitta or Milo but it was kind of Okay. The grilled Chicken Pizza had a good topping of Fresh Veggies , Chicken Shredded and generous amount of Cheese but the crust was super thin and moreover like biscuit which I didn't like that much but overall it tasted good. I expected more from them but the pricing is really cheap at that kind of location so can't really complain much. I feel I will get back to this place to try out its other offerings . The Service was good and also the staffs were really well-behaved and quick.

Had quite expectations from this place but it turned out to be quite average, though for the price point it's well enough. The pizza had a hard biscuity base which I didn't like but the topping was tasty. The choto latte tasted like Bournvita but the art was commendable. Nice place for a quick bite.

Went here a couple of days back with my sistaaa. Cute little place right on the main street very near to City Centre Salt Lake. White painted brick walls and cozy chairs, they had Christmas decorations on too. Coming to food, we ordered jalape√±o cheese balls, hazelnut and mocha frapes, and BBQ chicken in hot sauce. When we had asked for the house specials, the staff recommended ordering main course. Honest yet strange! Then again the frapes were very nice (can give CCD a run for their money), and the cheese balls had oodles of cheese (perfect for cheese lovers), the BBQ sauce quite tasty. They had also given us rice along with the BBQ chicken which we asked to be taken back. Since we didn't want to have rice and it wasn't mentioned in the menu either. The service was on the slower side but we liked the ambience and chatted away to glory üòâ Wouldn't mind visiting again and trying out more stuff on their menu ü§ò

A nice place amidst a residential area in Salt Lake. This place will not to be too harsh on your pocket neither will it taste bad. They serve quality coffee and rest assured the food is at par for the price you pay as well. Going here and taking a shot won't be a gamble.

Wishlist ticked finally  My looooooooong wish to visit this cafe came true today when a dear old friend of mine was back in town.
We were their first customers today 
The place is very cozy and we just loved the ambience & decor. We ordered two Lemon Ginger Soda Drink,Chicken Fiery Nachos,Double Walnut Brownie & Mousse.
Needless to say We liked the food immensely but here I would like to mention one thing-spoon should have been provided with Nachos as we had to dug our fingers. 
AND..
The cherry on the cake was when one of the staff members clicked a picture of me and my friend with Instax Moments and gifted it to us.
How good is that? 
Pocket pinch very reasonable

Had a Funghi pasta and Veg Quesadilla with a cup of Hazelnut Latte.The Funghi pasta sauce was great but some mushroom pieces tasted bitter and stale and that was a put off. The Quesadilla are not at all authentic and it was very low on cheese.H ad sauted seasonal vegetables inside it. The Hazelnut latte was the best of the lot. Hot and refreshing.The value for money is great though. Ideally its a 3.8 for the order that I had.

Seeing the rating, me and my wife went to try out the place. To be honest, experience was average. We couldn‚Äôt differentiate between Hazelnut Cappuccino and  Irish Cappuccino, didn‚Äôt taste anything different from a normal office cappuccino out of the machine. Darjeeling tea(marked in the menu card as second flush/first flush) was nothing more than tea bags in hot water, expected to be at least in a pot. Pizza was decent. Staff seem to be confused, contradicting information when asked whether fresh juice is available or not. Overall, nothing very wow, definitely not as per the rating.

Few steps from BD block crossing. Small place but outside seating available. We ordered crunchy chicken, pasta in white sauce, chocolate shake and mango shake. Chocolate shake and mango shake was 4.5 out of 5. Both were great. Pasta was also 4.5 out of 5. It was mouth watering. Quantity of food was quiet enough for one. But the crunchy chicken was 3 out of 5. It was so so.

REVIEW (TAKEAWAY)
This joint would often come up when I needed food delivered so I finally decided to give it a try... And I must say that I have mixed emotions for this place after the meal.

THE ORDER
C64 Chicken Pie
Al Funghi Pizza
Brownie

C64 CHICKEN PIE
The "chef's special" pie was a nightmare. The pie crust was all most and undercooked... And the filling was just not up to the mark. When I complained I given all bs from the staff. 
Upon requesting to talk to the chef, I was informed that the pie is refrigerated and microwaved :3

AL FUNGHI PIZZA
Would love a bit more sauce on my pizza but it tasted great and had a lot of that cheesy goodness. Also, I loved the little containers in which they sent the condiments. It however didn't make up for it's price point.

BROWNIE
Who doesn't like desserts? And it tastes even better when it's free. But even after saying all that, the brownie was bittersweet (I was okay with it but everyone might not). It wasn't as moist as I'd want it to be.
But I loved the ganache as it was the only thing that was sweet in the brownie.

THE VERDICT
I would recommend the pizzas as they taste good... Not very Italian but at least it's tasty and made just like other mainstream food outlets.
Also, the food came earlier than what they said... So I loved that as well.

RATING
It's just another restaurant that serves average food at a high price point. Nothing new there.

A dinky little cafe with a surprisingly large menu! Honestly the small space and casual ambiance did not really say much about the variety of food they offer. A few minutes walk away from CC1, this cafe is quite popular in sector 1 area.From the amazingly spiced Honey chili prawn to juicy yet crunchy chicken the food here is quite a a stunner. On my recent visit with a fellow blogger I tried:
Crunchy chicken: Juicy inside and super crunchy outside this fried chicken goes amazingly well with a cup of hot beverage.
Honey chili prawns: I am a sucker for prawns and a bit picky about the flavors. The prawns were extremely well flavored and a bit on the sweeter end. Now I do not like my prawns sweet but there is no reason that others would not.
Funghi pasta: An absolute favorite! Creamy and cheesy just the way everyone likes it!Mousse: The basic chocolate mousse with high creamy quotient.

Located at a walking distance of 5-6 minutes from City Centre. It's a pretty small place so seems kinda congested but then it sure is properly decorated. We had a BBQ pizza, a Mexican grilled chicken under mains and the double chocolate walnut brownie. 
The food is pretty good for the prices. You sure don't wanna miss out on the brownie. Basically, you can refer to this place as one where you get pretty good food that doesn't affect your pocket much.

One of the most well-known cafes in sector one. They specialise in shakes and burgers. They will definitely satisfy you with their price range! You don't have to worry about the food standards. However, the only thing which disappoints me everytime I visit here is their seating arrangement. Too congested and compact furniture,  sometimes we have to wait to get a place to sit because as I said earlier this place is very famous and opted by many localites to spend their evening! Anyway, they have recently arranged tables and chairs outside which is pleasing and comfortable! They decorate the place well during festive seasons. Overall, Calcutta 64 is an outstanding place to spend quality time with your family and friends.

On 25th December evening, when you need to keep all your fingers crossed to get a table in BIG restaurants, we found this little cafe near CC1. They have very limited seating arrangement, so had to wait for 20 mins which was more than okay for us. Now the best thing here is, they have outdoor seating. So you can be in queue for indoor seating while having your coffee and starters at outdoor!! This is the most beautiful thing about this cafe and 5 star for that.

Now coming to food, we had VANILLA MOCHA and HAZELNUT MOCHA. Both of the drinks were well made with good coffee beans and adequate amount of creams. Only thing is they had usee cold milk for the coffee, so it was not piping hot!

Next was MIXED MINESTRONE SOUP. This was really delicious. Packed with crushed black pepper, roasted chicken cubes and prwan chunks, this made the perfect start of our food journey.

From mains, we had GRILLED CHICKEN STEAK and FISH STEAK. 
CHICKEN STEAK was awsome with large boneless chunk of chicken covered with beautiful rosemary sauce and topped with poached egg. This dish was the best of that evening.
FISH STEAK was having nice spinach lemon sauce, it was grilled to perfection but we felt the fish required more seasoning. As they are using BASA fish which doesnt have distinct taste and smell, the dish would be more tasty if fish fillet was seasoned better.

Both of these dishes were served with FRIED RICE and MASHED POTATO. RICE was good but MASHED POTATO would require more butter and garlic.

Overall a nice place to hangout and have good food along with that. Price tag and quantity are also plus points for this cafe.

It is very close to City Centre with a perfect ambience. 
The place is a little small, with a limited menu compared to most restaurants, but the food is delectable. We ordered Mexican grilled chicken, Chicken quesadilla, Caesar Salad, Fish meuniere, Mousse & Ice cream with oreo. Every dish was prepared to perfection and the price is very budget-friendly. Though the service was slow, I liked the place quite a lot.

I still remember the day when I found this cafe while scrolling through Zomato. I came across this cafe and was into my wishlist.

Finally one day I visited this joint. This cafe which is just 5 minutes walk from City Centre 1 is a tiny one with a total of 14 odd seats. But good news is they have planning of expanding in near future :) Now long story short,let us come to the overall experience.

Ambience -> Simple,supercool and nice.

Service -> The boys out here are very well behaved,apt and serving time is also quick too.

Food and drinks -> As of now I am not disappointed with any of the food items or coffees I have tried out here. They tastes real good and the way they serve is just awesome. A simple omlette with mushroom(Mushroom and Cheese Omlette to be more specific), Chicken Ceaser Salad, Grilled Chicken Steak, Chicken Wrap Sandwich, Crunchy Cold Coffee, Affogato, Double Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream deserves special mention. We are still left exploring the other items here.

And last but not the least, a visit to these place will not make a hole in your pocket!

To the people scrolling out through these reviews I have one word for you all: Do not hesitate or give a second thought to visit this cafe. If you are looking for a nice place to spend a morning, an afternoon or an evening with your friend or loved ones, this place is the perfect choice.

CALCUTTA 64 is a treasure trove in the heart of Salt lake .It offers guilt free indulgence to some mouth smacking delicacies.
>>Location- 5min walk from city center 1 ,the lane beside Kalyan jewellers is this tiny little cute cafe .
>>Look and Feel- This cafe isn't spacious as it can hardly accommodate 4table indoors.It has an outdoor seating arrangement too. But boy looks are deceptive when it comes to the quality of good they serve.
¬ª¬ªFood-
* Pasta in Pink Sauce- Heavenly delicious pasta . It was a mixed sauce one. Tastes great along with the garlic bread.The pasta sauce isn't too heavy and it creates a great chemistry with the taste buds. Heavily recommended.
* California Orange Salsa Prawns- the presentation of this dish is alluring . It simply looks like a piece of art. The curry tastes sweet and mingles perfectly with the rice served along. It serves 5-6 small prawns which are seasoned perfectly.Highly recommended for the prawn lovers .
*Fresh lime soda - we opted for the sweet one . It's a refreshing drink and is my all time favorite of mine.
¬ªService & pocket pinch - The service was quick and the staffs here are really nice. I ordered the above mentioned dishes and the bill was around Rs.700 . Great place for hanging out . The prices being so low makes it an ideal one too.Please do visit this cafe . Its hands down one of the best cafes in town .

A cute tiny cafe located in saltlake sector1,Near cc1. The name 'CALCUTTA 64' comes frm its pincode(kolkata-700064). Perfect hangout destination with frndz..

About : Nice ambiance, well decor. Nice wall hanging, soothing ceiling lights makes dis place amazing..
Service is slow, well behaved stuffs.. 
They hve sitting arrangements for both inside and outside..  Air conditioned dine in cafe.. Hardly 15-20 people can enjoy der service at a time.. 

Food: they have huge variety in their menu from beverages to light meal .. All d items thy served were perfectly garnished.. Thy hve some ready-made dessert items like chocolate mousse.. 
We ordered - choco shake, mango shake, smoked chicken pizza.. 

¬§ Smoked chicken pizza(3/5)- thy served it in a wooden pizza platter.. it looks delicious..thin crunchy crust üçï baked with ring shaped yellow/red bellpapers,capsicum, cube smoked chicken..
Pizza crust was too thin nd crunchy like toast biscuit which tastes worst than anything.. Still i gve it 3 because of the cheesy toppings and garnishing..

¬§ Chocolate shake(4.5/5)- one large highball glass of chilled, tasty ,rich chocolate shake served by them aftr a long wait.. It was superb.. 

¬§ Mango shake(4/5)- same as choco shake it was served in a large glass..  Aftr one sip u can feel the taste of pure mango pulp mixed with heavy milk.. Love dis shake.. 

Pricing is moderate.. If u are in saltlake area nd you have some time in ur hands dis can be d best place to  spnt good time with good food..

A short walk away from City Centre and tucked in one of the many Salt Lake sector 1 lanes is a pretty little cafe that goes by the name Calcutta 64. While Salt Lake may itself be a confusing area for many, including me, this was quite easy to locate even for me. I found myself very drawn to this place as it had a very welcoming and cosy vibe. Once inside, I was delighted to find it was indeed so. As a blogger, I'd say this is quite the good place to sit and work on your laptop while snacking away. They provide Wifi to the customers too. What more can one ask for right? Well the answer is good food. Lets get to talking about what I tasted this evening.¬†Fish & Chips- A classic. Two pieces of fried fish, some french fries and a dip. What I liked most about this dish was its texture. The outside was crumb fried and crunchy while the inside was pillowy soft due to the use of Basa fish. While this did provide great texture, Basa fish is itself known to be quite bland which was where this dish fell slightly short for me. However, it was still enjoyable and others may absolutely love it instead.¬†C64 Chicken&Mushroom Pie- This was certainly the star of the meal. Flaky pastry with generous filling which was cooked perfectly and delicious. The added cheese made it taste even better. Highly recommend anyone visiting C64 to try this.¬†California Orange Salsa Prawns- This was a spicy and tangy prawn dish served with herb rice. The presentation was quite impressive and I rather liked the idea of serving the curry in an orange peel bowl. The taste too lived up to how it looked and I think the sweet tangy orange salsa was perfectly complemented by the herb rice and the prawns were well cooked too.¬†Lemon Iced Tea- One word, REFRESHING! Absolutely recommended.Creamy Irish Coffee- Black coffee with cream in layman's terms, this was also a rather enjoyable beverage.¬†Affogato- The combo of vanilla ice cream and coffee is absolutely divine as was this dish. An amazing end to an amazing meal.¬†I had already walked in with quite a full stomach along with a fellow blogger so this is all we could sample today. Definitely look forward to going back and¬† trying out more of their vast menu soon. Thank you for your service C64.

Food : I would give a 3. Cheese and Jalapeno Pizza and the cheese garlic bread were really bad. Only baked cheese pasta was good. Well if someone is searching a cafe for some good food.This should be among the first to get eliminated.
Service - 0 nothing more to say. They are the worst when it comes to service.We sat ideally for like 1 hour and even after that they just gave half the order and the hot chocolate I ordered was never brought to the table but was added in the bill.
Ambience - Not worth talking about.
In conclusion I felt cheating myself giving it a 2/5 but I would say I am highly generous giving them a 2. Go for some other cafe there are many and most of them are better.

This review is served fresh off the oven as I casually dropped by at this cafe with a fellow blogger today evening. Quietly tucked at Salt Lake near Tank No. 3 is this little cafe that boasts of fine coffee, a good adda and in this weather, a lovely meal in the evening. Come over all by yourself, or with your folks, Calcutta 64 is the quite little place offering scrumptious food at a reasonable price so no complaints there.¬†

I was honestly not very hungry so I couldn't essentially tuck in full fledged, although I promise to do it at the soonest.

Ambiance : Very casual. They have a big window, you might want to bag a seat near it while munching on the food. The vibe is friendly - nothing very fancy. Humble abode serving humble food at a humble price. You can choose to sit either outside or inside - they have both options at your disposal. This place can accommodate a total of 30 heads max. They do have space crunch so you might want to drop in early.

Suggestion : Drop in with an appetite because they have plenty of options to choose from.

Food :

Fish n' Chips - The only let down was the Basa, although it was soft on the outside and crispy on the outside. Loved the fries along with it. Dip could have been much better, wasn't the classic tartare. Half a mark deducted for that.

C64 Chicken & Mushroom Pie - Spot on. Generous amount of mushroom and chicken stuffed inside the pie. Fabulous seasoning. Definitely recommended.

California Orange Salsa Prawns - These are served with a side of rice (with beans and corn kernels) and veggies. The orange salsa gives a sweet yet tangy kick that is a nice change to the palate really. Goes very well with the side of rice and veggies. Give this a try! I loved it.

Beverages :

Lemon Ice Tea - Very refreshing actually.

Dessert :

Affogato - This was absolutely amazing. Loved the bitterness from the coffee and the sweetness of the vanilla. A clear winner!

This place definitely knows their food. Service needs a bit of tweaking, other than that this place has immense potential. Good place to chill with folks and family. I am definitely revisiting because I would like to try more from their mains!

This cafe is hidden, so take help of google maps. This caffe fits in the culture of Kolkata where small cafe keeps popping up. The place is cosy and has limited seating inside and outside. The ambiance is cute and cosy and the place is decorated well with hangings and paintings. 

Coming to the food, I ordered 

‚òï Hot Choco Latte: Hands down its one of the best choco lattee i had in a long time. It came in a tall mug and the barista wasent shy to show his lattee art skills. I was almost thinking of ordering it twice. 

üçû Baked Tandoori Chicken Sandwich: The dish is value for money. 4 piece of well made sandwich with a side of potatoe chips and ketchup. It was good 

üêü Butter coriander Fish: This was a bit disappointing, the plating was shabby and the fish was lacked proper seasoning making it blant inside. The overall taste was confusing with no clear idea of what the chef was trying to serve. 

üêîSchezwan chicken momo: They were good. 

To conclude, its a value for money and the place is cool.

After finding it fully occupied in three consecutive Sundays , was lucky today to find a seat for two inside. Tried there canada cheese chicken soup - which was a real energy booster on a cold evening. Ordered for bbq chicken burger - the buns were quite thick concealing a rather thin patty inside. Mexican grilled prawn, though took forever to be served - was tangy and tasty with decent sized fresh prawns. Sunny side up egg and Assam tea was as usual. Highlight of the meal was the lichi ice tea - which was just perfectly done. 

Service was little slow and immature to handle the volume of demand.

Pocket pinch was around 800 for two - had a 20% discount coupon from Kolor Kanvas workshop (AD 206)

We had ordered a margherita pizza which tasted good. Our 2nd order was fungi pasta which was a white sauce pasta with mushrooms and it‚Äôs taste wasn‚Äôt upto to expectations after having such a great pizza. The third order was crispy chilli babycorn which was the worst i‚Äôve ever had. The babycorn was not at all crisp and the sauce was really really bad. Apart from this the virgin mojito was good in taste. I would like to recommend to visit this place only for pizza. It‚Äôs not even much expensive and pocket friendly.

Calcutta 64, a cool little cafe and a definite visit if you stay in Kolkata.

Located near Kalyan Jewellers (5-7 mins from City Centre 1)
A very small cafe with a cosy ambience. Gives a very homely feeling when you enter at once.

We ordered a BBQ Chicken Burger, Chicken Pizza, Chicken Quesadillas and Chocolate Mousse.

The Burger had a crispy patty and a lovely taste to it. Must try over here.
The Pizza was quite normal but on the bland side.
The Quesadillas had a very soft base and the filling wasn't well spiced up. Lacked the basic flavours.
The mousse was a delicacy. Loved it to the core.

What hit the ratings was the service. We celebrated a birthday, so asked them to serve the cake, which at first they refused. Then we requested to atleast give a plate on which we only place everything and then again had to request for the knife and spoon.
Overall also, the hospitality was quite let-down types.

Well being foodie and then having friends who r cafe owners r something called bliss! It is one such case here. This place is much talked about and eventually the owners r my besties. But the review is honest and can be relied upon.
Location - very easy from ultadanga just an auto.
Decor- Small cute place, decent decor and feels lik home.
Food - Quality and quantity pretty decent, menu also gives a quite variety of spreads from salads, pastas, nibbles, pizzas, main courses, mocktails, desserts etc. The price doesnot bite the pocket.

Our choice of food - Winter lunch needed a customary touch of good coffee which is a feel good factor for souls here. We had Hazelnut cappucino n Mochaccino. Followed by Mongolian chicken nibbles, garlic chicken sandwich that contained chips n sauce and tandoor baked chicken pizza(which i tried for the 1st time). Since the food quantity was good there was no space for desserts which i miss already. The pizza is highly recommended alongwith the sandwich. Thoroughly enjoyed and foodies do giv a visit and judge urself.

This restaurant is very small and cute but don't let its look deceive you cause the food is just delicious. We ordered chicken Caesar salad, tandoori pizza,iced tea,cafe latte, mocha coffee and last but not least brownie with ice cream. I think i never had brownie this delicious, and mind you the salad is best around kolkata so definitely try it. As for the pizza and the drinks they were very good to. I think I'm gonna visit this lovely place soon again‚ù§

I am pretty impressed by the food they serve. We oredered for Caesar Salad, Funghi Pizza, Fish and Chips and Mousse. This was truly the best Caesar Salad I have tasted. Funghi Pizza is a thin crust pizza, and very well made. I heard other customers  appreciating Fish and Chips and truly it was very delicious, but I felt they used MSG in its preparation. Their service was extremely slow and that is the only reason I have rated it lower than what it deserved for its food. The waiters are not aware of what is there in their menu card. Ambience and decor are truly commendable. So, an improvement in their service can make customers' experience even better.

A nice and cozy little joint located in the Kalyan Jeweller's lane. The ambiance is very soothing and is complimented well by the music. Have tried their crunchy chicken and BBQ chicken sandwich along with cappuccino and have no complaints whatsoever. Do give this place a shot whenever near city centre area. Recommended place will visit again.

Location-The easiest landmark would be City Centre 1.Walk straight from Balle Balle dhaba keeping Kalyan Jewellers to your right .Continue walking further for a few minutes.This outlet would fall on your left.

Ambience-This one's small but extremely elegant with tastefully done-up decor.Large glass windows, overlooking the quaint road in front, keep you from feeling claustrophobic despite the space crunch.The bookshelf, paintings and vertical garden provide the necessary element of quirkiness in the otherwise minimalistic chic decor.

Food-I was here on a Sunday evening and ordered their hazelnut mocha along with a plate of sandwiches and chocolate mousse to round it up.

HAZELNUT MOCHA(4/5)-I drink coffee more for the taste than the kick and for me this drink ticked all the boxes.The latte art on top is the best you'll find in the city.

GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH (4.5/5)-I cannot fault any aspect of this dish.Extremely moreish.

CHOCOLATE MOUSSE(4/5)-Lightly whipped mousse with a very subtle taste.Delicious.

Service-Fast and efficient albeit a bit lukewarm.A smile goes a long way in making the guests feel comfortable.The staff should also be prompt enough with the menu card and the bill as they are with the orders.

Prices-Very reasonable.Full value for money.

Verdict-Great food.A plethora of choices.Reasonable prices. What more could one want?The pastas,beverages and pizzas on offer are too irresistible to not warrant repeated visits.

Calcutta 64 is the new hot cafe in the city of Joy and is deservedly so. Though there is heavy competition around the area they have made quite a name for themselves. The only negativity is the place is simply too small (actually a bit too small as nobody wants to wait). I loved their BBQ chicken burger which was very juicy and the flavours were just about perfect. Their speciality according to me is their brand of THIN CRUST PIZZA. I LOVED their baked tandoori chicken pizza, for thin crust pizza lovers there cannot be a better substitute, the crust was perfect with adequate meat cheese and overall it was an amazing pizza and much better cause me and none of my friends some of whom being future hoteliers never expected such a delight. The cold coffee with whipped cream was also good. The staff is courteous and the service is prompt. The place is pocket friendly and the food is paisa-wasool. So be it a date or an outing with close buddies perfect place for some aatlaamo and adda. But the only downside is that this place is very small, but who cares when their food is so great.

Wow....This place is so good. Its just that it is a bit too small but the food makes up for all. Food they serve is really tasty and my brother and I absolutely loved it. We tried strawberry soda....which is a little change to normal soda flavours and is nice, then we had bbq chicken burger, chicken tandoori pizza which had the perfect crust for thin crust lovers, then we had chicken steam momos which were again good and also brownies were perfect chocolaty pleasure.
This place is healthy for your pocket as well.
Keep up the good work Team Calcutta64, their staff are also friendly.

This cozy little cafe is one of the highest rated here in Kolkata and deservedly so. They dish out a wide variety of food, and all the ones that I‚Äôve tasted are simply delicious. Special mentions are chicken nachos, pasta in pesto sauce and chicken caesar salad. Although their coffee is not upto the mark. Tried hazelnut cappuccino and affogato, none were strong enough for my taste. The crunchy cold coffee is very fulfilling though. Also one should try the double chocolate brownie for the sinful chocolatey goodness! They do get the very important concept of food presentation just right.
As for the place itself, they have limited seating arrangements (including an outdoor option). The staff are nice and service is rather quick. Also it‚Äôs really pocket-friendly.

This is actually what defines a perfect cafe taste in Kolkata keeping in mind the budget of the neighborhood and it's feasibility. Ordered for cold coffee with ice cream and it was made well. Then comes the pizza with tandoori chicken bits which is surely not to be missed and moreover the sandwiches are a must. Strongly recommended.

The chocolate shake looked as well as tasted good . I totally loved the cafe frappe ‚ù§. Chicken pasta was amazing . Mexican grilled chicken Pizza was yummy but crust was too thin . Chicken grilled sandwich was love . The only thing that I didn't like at all was the caramel custard dessert as we all were really full and it didn't excite our taste buds as expected .

C64 was a loooong time awaited place to us. I had bookmarked this place from near about one year. It's located at BD block, few minutes walk from city centre.
So, finally we stepped here in today. ‚ù§ somewhat celebration of something else!ü§£
The cafe has both the inside and outside sections. Yet little but cozy. Outside section has 6-7 seats. Inside section has seats for near about 14-16 people.
The decoration was compact and arranged beautifully. It's impressive that how you can manage a little place with some little things. The food came after 20 minutes after placing the order.
Now come to foods.

Mexican grilled chicken - go with the name. Literally spicy. Little pungent. Chicken pieces were too big and they served 6 pieces which is enough. Topped with cheese. A complimentary rice and salad is served with all main course. Loved it.

BBQ Fish - I loved that dish too much. 9-10 pieces of fish were served in bbq sauce. A perfect blend of sweet and sour. The rice side was enough.

Mousse - this is simply love ‚ù§ the blend of choco cream and choco topping was fabulous and delicious üòã

Pocket pinch is not too much. Basically it's known for budget friendly place. Moreover, as the GST rate has come to 5%, it's a real funü§£

Definitely recommended.

This tiny little place gives u the perfect place to chill out on a lazy afternoon or a cold night at sector 1,Salt lake..
The decor is pretty simple..space crunch being the biggest problem i believe..
Coming to the food..
We ordered baked chicken tandoori...it was yumm..perfectly cooked chicken served in a rich delicious buttery gravy with baked apple garnished with pepper..loved it thoroughly..
The bbq fish..well the gravy was tangy..good enough but somehow overshadowed the fish..basa i believe..not upto the mark..
The mexican grilled chicken served with steamed rice..mammamia..this dish is a win win..the gravy is super tasty with tamarind..gives their full fledged flavour with well cooked veggies alongwith..loved it.
The bbq chicken was good enough..tasted quite like a steak..loved the simplicity..great one..
The double chocolate walnut brownie..well i expected to be a bit more chocolaty..but it tasted pretty balanced..with the vanilla ice cream..smooth and enriching..
The caramel custard was a tad bit turndown on their part..average one..could have been better..
The creamy irish coffee was exotic..loved the aroma..the taste..classy indeed...
Overall prices are a tad bit on the higher side..but a place worth a visit for ur tastebuds to have a jolly ride..

A very small (actually very small,can't accomodate more than ten people together)cafe in saltlake in saltlake at moderate and reasonable price. We tried BBQ chicken burger as recommended by zomato. But i was lil bit of disappointed with the burger. Kfc or Macd offers a way better burger than this. Next we tried coriander lemon chicken which was juicy and somehow different from usual chicken starter. Hazelnut frappe was satisfactory. Staffs are very friendly and prompt.

Calcutta 64 is a relatively small cafe near 3 number island, salt lake. Their best selling dish has to be the fried fish with chips which are served in these quirky dishes with mayonnaise. The chicken penne pasta in pesto sauce is also one of their best sellers which in undoubtedly absolutely yumm! I have also tried the chicken grilled sandwiches which is yet another of my personal favourites. 
Overall the quality of food is just amazing in such less price. üíñüòç
One problem which most of us must have faced is that it‚Äôs always too crowded and we hardly get any space in the peak hours. But they also serve outside which is a plus point again.

I went there yesterday with my friends and we ordered BBQ chicken pizza , hot chocolate latte, mousse , chicken and egg mayo wrap and chicken salami sandwich.. the food was no doubt good and it's pocket friendly although gst is applicable. But I didn't rate as 5/5 as the crust of the pizza was too thin it could be a bit thicker so it would have tasted better ... Anyway would like to visit again :)

The food here is nothing great but when you‚Äôre hungry and want to sit and gossip with your friend over coffee and some sides you can hop in here. We had ordered margherita pizza,  chicken bbq burger and a cappuccino. The burger was small compared to its price and the chicken patty tasted nothing like bbq chicken, the chips served with the burger was not fresh either. Honestly I couldn‚Äôt agree with the bbq burger! 
The margherita pizza(thin crust) was good and the smell of cheese was its proof. The size of the pizza was good for the price but the thin crust was way too thin!
The coffee was served hot and it smelled like coffee too with ofcourse some cream.
The place is a bit too tight to be a cafe and you might have to wait for a seat. 
Overall it‚Äôs definitely a go to place for some lazy hangout and adda!!!

This place is really special for me, I have so many memories attached here. This is one of the very famous cafe out here in salt lake. The place is in the lane near cc1, the area is quiet and serene, and yes this is a small cafe which fills your big soul with amazing food.
They make amazing lattes, cold coffees, sandwiches and mousse. A must try.
I had been to this place a lot, so giving all pics at once, so far whatever I have clicked. It's funny how I forget about clicking pictures as soon as I enter snd start chilling with my partner, and have those refreshing frappes.
They have outside sitting area too, but will prefer to sit inside beside the glass, in the afternoon, the serenity and amazing food is a total winwin!

In the maze of not up to the mark restaurants of Salt Lake, I finally found out an oasis. Small ( read too small ), compact, reasonable and not too hard to find out, Calcutta 64 is a simple eatery to help you out during the bad end of the month.
After a movie at the Carnival, I decided to go for a quick bite before leaving for home.
Calcutta 64 welcomed me with their Chicken steak, Swiss Pie and Cold coffee served with ice cream.
Chicken steak served with rice was an added benefit for me, as I was a bit hungry. Chicken was tender, gravy was bang on and the poached egg was as beautiful as it looked like.
Cold Coffee was just the regular sort, the one we are used to drink at any coffee shop.
But the Pie definitely caught my attention.
Warm, tasty carrot stuffing with banana toppings gave a sweet ending to my short, simple and not at all costly snack.
Will definitely come back to taste what else they have to offer.

It is a small caf√© in sector 1, with only 4 tables and seating for maximum 13-14 people. Went there with a friend to have dinner on Navami night. Had to wait for 20 minutes as the place was full. Ambience is minimal. Ordered their chicken coleslaw sandwich, funghi pasta, caf√© frappe' and sweet n sour lime soda. Service is quite slow. It took almost 20 minutes for the food to be served. The sandwich was soft and delicious with a wonderful aroma and was served with tomato sauce and potato wafers. Pasta was creamy, well done and yummy but quantity was less for the price. It was served with two pieces of toasted bread. Frappe' was nice, chocolatey & thick with a layer of froth but a little too sweet. The lime soda was horrible. It tasted disgusting. Totally not worth it. I have tasted better lime soda at the road side at 10 times cheaper price, so it's not recommended. Staff are attentive. Prices of some items are a little high but food is good. They charge 18% GST.
Overall nice experience. Will visit again to try some more sandwiches.

I really wish they had more sitting area inside, the waiting time to enter this restaurant never less than an hour after you arrive here (unless you are here at noon). They have just 6 tables amd they gets filled in no time. People mostly come here to pass their time and relax too much!! :P May be because of the ambience?!
The ambience is pretty classy I must say. We had ordered a portion each of egg-mayonnaise sandwich and chicken BBQ sandwich and a Funghi Pasta with Cheese and Chicken. They were really smooth and delicious. Our food was gone in 10 mins!! :D
Pricing is a bit on the higher side i would say.
I wish i could stay there a bit longer but my engagements for the rest of the evening kept this wish at bay. Dunno when i will be back but am looking forward to my next visit. A definite recommendation for my friends!

This place is a bit difficult to find, so rely on Google maps.
This place is one of the innumerable cafes that keep popping up in our vibrant city. The place is extremely small, can't seat more than 12-14 people. And because we went on Ashtami, it was even more crowded. I deducted 0.5 only because of the space issue, because it makes the place a tad bit uncomfortable.
Coming to the food, it more than makes up for everything else!
I only had a barbecue chicken sandwich, though I also clicked a picture of my friend's chicken burger.
The sandwich comes with a side of chips and ketchup. Four sandwiches, layered with decent chunks of chocolate smothered in barbecue sauce and a cheesy mayonnaise, this one is sure to take your heart away.
It is definitely something I'd recommend everyone to go have there.
And the pocket pinch was quite reasonable. I had to pay less than 150Rs for a decent meal during pujo, but every penny was worth it! üòÉ 
Keep up the good work, Calcutta 64.

The ambience is soothing and is very sweet, hence perfect for date night.

Coming to the food, the drinks are amazing, from hazelnut frappe to oreo milkshake to hot chocolate, every drink is delicious to the last sip.

While in food, We have tried the pizza and the pasta and both of them were delicious.

The veg pasta in particular has fresh vegetables sprinkled like a garden of different colours.

I have been there thrice already and would love to explore more from their menu again.

Of the coolest chill places in Salt Lake which serves awesome food. I‚Äôve been here many time but forgot to review it as this place feels home. The space is less but it makes up for the quality of food served. The pizzas are lip smackingly great ! Do visit and Enjoy.

Went to Calcutta 64 with my friends few days back. Its a nice, little place near the BD island. I had ordered for a Fresh Lime Soda, a Barbeque Chicken Sandwich and a Garlic Chicken Burger. All were pretty good. The sandwich and the burger came with potato chips and tomato dip. And the quantity is sufficient. Loved the place. Will be revisiting soon.
Prices on the menu card are exclusive of taxes.

This cafe is the ultimate proof for the adage ‚ÄúGood things come in small packages‚Äù. A tiny, tiny cafe with courteous service, cosy ambience and delicious, lip smacking food. We were very lucky as we didn‚Äôt have to wait at all for a place. The menu is well sorted and the pricing very very reasonable. The chicken was juicy, the barbecue sauce thick and the desserts heavenly. So hangout at CC1 but do eat at Calcutta 64.

A very small cafe with above average food. We ordered babycorn mushroom in cajun sauce and Mexican grilled chicken pizza. The babycorn mushroom in cajun sauce had me going through a mixed feeling. On one hand i liked the sauce and the mushroom but the babycorn was way too sour. I had to ask the server whether the babycorn was stale or not. Coming to the pizza it was splendid. The crust the topping to cheese to sauce ratio was just perfect. If you are into thin crust pizza this is the place to be. I want to visit this place again try out some more items.

A very mediocre place to be at. The place is too tiny. Food was nice but the quantity was too small. Nothing extraordinary. The worst part was their service. They didnt even serve us drinking water before we asked. They did not even bothered to pick up the cup and plate after we had our tea. It took nearly about 45 mins for the main course to arrive.  Unsatisfactory experience it was.

A tiny place tucked in a corner of salt lake. 
I like the nicely done interior and the recent pop songs playing on their tv which makes the mood a bit better i must admit. 
I have a mixed feeling about the food
Jalapeno cheese balls - A nice starter of crispy balls with cheese mixed with mashed potatoes and the hotness of jalape√±os served with a beautiful dip. 
Crispy chilly baby corn - one of the best crispy babycorn i ever had. The crispiness of the babycorn was just perfect with a wonderful chilly sauce. This tastes awesome.
Margherita pizza - the classic pizza but i didn't really enjoy their pizzas. The dough was hard and the cheese was not only mozzarella and was hard.
Cheese and jalape√±o pizza - this pizza just tasted bad. The pizza was too hard and the cheese tasted like local slice cheese. 
Baked tandoori chicken pizza - this also was okay but could have been way way better.
Veg mixed sauce pasta - The pasta was awesome. Tasted delicious with garlic bread.
White sauce penne with chicken - This was also delicious and i loved both the pastas.
Doubles chocolate walnut brownie - it was nice but i have had way better brownies.
Swiss pie - This according to me was one of the best pie I tasted in Kolkata. Just awesome 
Chocolate mousse - another good dessert. Delicious.
Cold coffee with icecream - tasted awesome.
Cappuccino - good but nothing special.
Overall a nice place to hit with your friends for a quick bite. Just do nit order pizza. .

Everyone needs a cafe near their house, to go to, on an evening when things are getting too boring or to just go with a one or two friends and catch up. Calcutta 64 is just the place for that. Though the accomodation space is significantly less, there are small stools and low tables outside to sit. The salad is good and so are the sandwiches. Quite impressive.  A coffee and a plate of sandwich or salad or maybe a plate of pasta is a good option. A very good hangout spot for a group of 2-4, specially for those living in or near Salt Lake (Sec-1)

When you talk about caf√©s in and around Salt lake, rarely you can string affordable and delicious together in a sentence. However, with the introduction of Calcutta 64 there seems to be a new ray of hope. Located stark opposite to a Hotel Management College, and just two-minutes away from City Center 1, one can easily locate this small caf√©.

First things first; the place is cramped and would hardly fit a swarm of 20 people at once. They have added outdoor seating, but let's face it during daytime, it is an improbable option. They have decorated the place well with intriguing wall hangings and paintings, although nothing impressive. Keeping out the seating space and d√©cor, food and courteousness are where Calcutta 64 rack up the numbers and popularity.

We have been to this place for half a dozen times now, and have tried out numerous dishes. The Fish & Chips is our staple dish in here, and like the British we can never have enough of it. The Chicken Quesadilla is delicious and surprisingly filling. It would suffice as a starter for two. For mains, the Mexican Grilled Fish Steak would certainly blow your mind away. Dripped in succulent Mexican spices and served with small scoop of rice and vegetables, it turns out to be pretty filling. The Chicken Fiesta Nachos is a surprise package, although you might feel they have slashed down the quantity, but it ends up being a delicious and filling appetizer. Never a fan of too much veggies, but the fiesta nachos boast of chunks of chicken and veggies cooked together forming a delicious package, and the mayonnaise on top acts like an icing. Their pizza section won't disappoint you, and all the thin crusted pizza lovers should definitely hog The Baked Tandoori Pizza. The coolers act as thirst quenchers, although nothing extraordinary. We have tried out their Mocha mystery, Blue Moon, Virgin Mojito, Strawberry Soda, and Lemon Iced Tea. To end your day at Calcutta 64, do try the Swiss Pie.

Quality and the price of coolers and shakes turns out to be the difference at Calcutta 64. They have limited number of staff, but arguably the most courteous one we have been catered to in Sector 1. They would also let you celebrate birthdays and all. Kudos to the owners of Calcutta 64 for keeping it neat and humble.

Cozy Ambiance + Interesting Food + Economic Pricing = Calcutta 64 ‚ò∫

Named after it's city and pincode and sharing it's inaugural date with Gandhiji's birthday, Calcutta 64 is a small but well built cafe in Salt Lake Sec I, near City Centre I, between Kalyan Jewellers and Tank No. 3.

Neatly built on a ground floor based area, measuring around 200 sq feet, this 14 seater cafe is barely one year old and already a favourite with localites, thanks to it's good service and economic pricing. If you are not able to secure an empty seat here, feel free to order a parcel or order via swiggy. That's what I do.

Seating arrangement herein comprises of wooden tables and chairs arranged in clusters of 2 and 4. The chairs have padded seats. The bakery counter cum reception desk is placed right at the entrance and it's background wall is stacked with crockery, juices, crushes etc. Three hanging lights are present atop the bakery counter.

The walls are colored in white and adorned with miniature paintings for sale. False ceiling is straight lined with embedded light bulbs. Flooring is carpeted in tiled pattern. The entire place is hued in cafe style white and dark brown. Background music, LED TV and loo facility are also present. Full roadside view from the entry side gives a nice perspective of space to the otherwise small place.

The menu card at Calcutta 64 comprises of the following categories - Hot Beverages, Cold Beverages, All Day Breakfast, Sandwiches & Burgers, Wraps, Pizza, Pasta, Salads, Soups, Snacks, Chunk Of Tibet, Mains and Desserts.

The menu is quite well designed, mostly keeping in mind the eating habit of the locals. Alongside, the menu also comprises of some interesting experimentations and old favorites, around which I planned my food tasting session.

The veg food items ordered for the tasting & review session were -

- Cucumber Iced Tea (Rs. 80/-): Mostly, the cafes and diners provide the option of Iced Tea in the following flavors - peach, green apple, litchi etc. Herein, the cucumber flavor seemed unusual and thus interesting to me. So, I ordered the same.

Served in a moderate sized glass with black straw, it was a refreshing, ice cube rich and frothy cold beverage, with a nice flavor of cucumber. It tasted nice.

- Cheese Cherry Pineapple Salad (Rs. 150/-): During my childhood days, I was quite fascinated with this salad, as it was often ordered by my uncles, whenever we visited those Park Street based restaurants. Of late (read few years), my quest for new food and restaurants take me to myriad locations, but I don't come across this salad anymore. Seeing it in Calcutta 64's menu, made me almost shriek in joy and I promotly ordered the same.

A wide rimmed and deep basin white ceramic plate came laden with six hefty portions of this salad, separated with big ice cube chunks. Each salad portion comprised of a freshly cut pineapple piece, a canned cherry and a big triangular piece of processed cheese, all inserted in a toothpick, in the same order as stated above.

Inclusion of ice cubes was a nice touch to the whole presentation. But instead of fresh pineapple pieces, canned pineapple pieces would have tasted better. Also, the cheese ought to have been cheddar, or even cottage cheese, but not the usual processed cheese.

I shared the aforesaid modifications with the management and they agreed to imbibe the same.

- Peanut Bbq Pasta (Rs. 160/-): Being quite tired of tasting the Pastas with red, white and pesto sauces, I was quite happy to spot this experimentation of Pasta with barbeque sauce, on the menu. Needless to say, I opted for the same.

Served in a similar ceramic dish as explained above, alongwith two slices of Garlic Bread, it was an interesting Pasta made in tangy, spicy and dark colored barbeque sauce, with seasonings sans any vegetables. It came topped with a generous serving of peanuts and grated cheese.

The pasta was well cooked, different and tasty. The Garlic Breads were also nice. The quantity served was good enough for one person.

- Lebanese Paneer Steak (Rs. 240/-): Served in a square white ceramic plate, a generous portion of Lebanese style Paneer Steak came accompanied with a small mound of rice infused with fine choppings of colored bell peppers and a side serving of mashed potatoes. The Paneer Steaks were square shaped, grilled and covered with a cheese and herbs rich preparation of white sauce.

The entire dish was quite filling and tasted good. The quantity served was good enough for one person.

- Babycorn & Mushroom In Cajun Sauce (Rs. 140/-): Being an ardent lover of both babycorn and mushrooms and being always on the lookout of discovering new ways of cooking mushrooms, I couldn't help from ordering this side dish.

A plateful of tilde (~) shaped white ceramic dish came laden with good quality, big sized, juicy mushrooms and long, crunchy, chewy babycorns, cooked in assorted sauces and slightly spicy seasonings. The dish was topped with chopped coriander leaves.

It tasted quite fresh and excellent.

- Hazelnut Cappuccino (Rs. 80/-): To be honest, I like my coffee to be perfect and thus I am quite scared of sipping them in most of the eateries, as most of them are big time mood spoilers after the initial 2-3 sips!

My dining partner cum co-owner of this place had to actually cajole me in trying one of their hot coffees, as they provide 18 types of coffees and are quite serious about each of their taste and presentation!

Trusting my wonderful hostess, I settled for a good old cup of flavored Cappuccino.

To my surprise, not only the coffee tasted good and uniform throughout, it was presented with the design of a teddy bear, which was a pleasant (read cute) break from the ususl swirl patterns.

If you happen to visit Calcutta 64, do try one of their hot coffees.

- Mochaccino (Rs. 80/-): Ordered by the hostess, a generous serving of this chocolate rich hot coffee came in a moderate sized glass with a handle.

Presented in two shades of brown and topped with neat swirl patterns, it looked quite inviting. My hostess seemed to devour her each and every sip of this beverage. She did request me to order one as well, but I refrained from doing so, as I did not want to mix the taste of two different coffees back to back.

- Swiss Pie (Rs. 90/-): Heavily recommended by their Chef, it was an innovation of presenting the Carrot Cake in Pie mould.

Served in a circular white ceramic dish, the slice of Swiss Pie was drizzled with honey before warming. Rich in butter, it was quite heavy to the tummy, but tasted nice.

All in all, it was a wonderful tasting session, comprising of - good and interesting food, soothing ambiance, courteous staff and lively and intelligent hostess.

Visited this place...located near cc1.. an average cafe..the interior was average..the place is very small..the sitting arrangements were poor with jst only 5 tables.
We ordered fish and chips--the fish was yummy but the quantity of chips was very less.The price was high according to the quantity offered.
We also ordered fresh lime soda-to my expectation it was very poor.
Price was high this time.Dont know why people say it's cheap.They also include GST to the bill.

Cozy pocket friendly place. Life becomes slower : you can take a cup of coffee and can spend a lot of time with a good company.

We ordered hazelnut cappuccino and hazelnut frappe. Both were good.

As per recommendation we ordered BBQ chicken and BBQ chicken Berger. The chicken was succulent and flavorful. As a dessert the creme caramel was just the perfect blend of taste and texture.¬†
Will love to visit again.

Had been there for a number of times. But not a single visit disappointed me. The food here is delicious and pocket friendly. The only problem is the Pocket-size space(although intelligently used). Thus,most of the time, You will have to wait outside for your turn. But who cares ! Once you enter the enticing decor and yummy dishes welcome you. I had their Cold Coffee,Mango Shake,Grilled chicken Sandwich,Szechuan Momo. All of them are scrumptious(Except the mango shake).

Conclusion: They have introduced some new dishes before puja. They offer great food in comparatively low price. Value for money.

Calcutta 64 is a low budget cafe that serves good food. Located near City Centre I this cafe is a must visit.¬†

We ordered Mexican Grilled Chicken with Fried Rice, Fungi Chicken Pasta, and Double Chocolate Walnut Brownie. While the main dishes were delicious, the brownie was a bit too sticky for our choice.

Though the service was a bit slow,¬†
the staff was courteous.

Hope the next time we visit, we get a better service.

A gem of a cafe located nearby city center one. For a quick bite we visited here. The joint is very small but quality of food is really good. We had Oreo vanilla shake and mango vanilla shake. Both were yum. The starter chilli pepper fish was awesome, flavours bursted in our mouths. Next we had chicken tandoor pizza which was again very tasty. Finely baked with melted cheese and thin crust. I am not a big fan of pizza still liked it a lot. Last but not the least we chicken steak and fresh lime soda. Chicken steak was a bit flat compared to other dishes.The place is pocket friendly too. Highly recommended to everyone.

This small cafe is tucked in secret corners of saltlake. Small cafe with limited seats, you got to wait to get a seat. 
But the wait is absolutely worth it. Ordered cafe latte , amazing it was. 
Next we tried barbeque chicken sandwich and crunchy chicken! 
Crunchy chicken needs special mention! 
Service is prompt, with friendly staffs. Prices really doesn't burn a hole in the pocket, great place to sit back and relax on a lazy afternoon!

This place was on my bucket list for a long time.. A small cozy joint with 4 tables would app accommodate about 15-18 persons at once.. 

Location:- 10mins walk from city centre 1.. This place is quite easily locatable as it is on the main road.. very near to momo I am sector 1..

Ambience:- A small joint decorated well..nothing much special to be honest.. A decent one..

Service :- the service was quite slow tbh.. There were 4 guys but still Cud not manage well.. They were polite and courteous but too damn slow..

Food:- Ordered lemon ice tea and chocolate shake as refreshments.. but they forgot to serve those ad directly served the main course.. After completing the food we made them remember that they didn't serve the refreshments..üòÄ may be diwali effect they Cud not concentrate..üòÖ

1) lemon ice tea :- They took very less tym to make this and I was thinking the taste might be not upto the mark.. but to utter surprise it was really tasty and refreshing.. One of the best I have had.. (5/5) the blend of tea and lemon infused with ice cubes were just perfect..neither too lemony nor too sweet.. üòçüòç loved it..

2) chocolate shake :- wow.. üòçüòò the first word that comes to my mind... It was just too yummy... kudos to the guy for making our taste buds feel heaven... (100/5) 

3) chilly and paneer pizza :- there was again a fumble... ordered medium one but we're served a small one.. and the medium one was served to another table who ordered a small one..üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ but again the taste makes up the error in service.. cheesy.. thin crust.. loaded with lots of paneer chunks.. perfect...üëçüëç(5/5) not a veg lover but totally loved this veg pizza..

4) baked Tandoori chicken sandwich:- the show stealer.. don't miss it.. This one is very very tasty... The stuffing is soo soo delicious.. This will make u crave for more...üòçüòç

Totally  recommended.. Food quality is top notch..üëçüëç

P:S :- plz do maintain a register to take the names of customers in waiting list.. Other wise it will create a chaos of who comes first and second.. try to serve the food accordingly.. 

They charge 18% GST.... A pocket friendly cafe.
 Do hop in and enjoy some lipsmacking food..

A 10 minute walk from CC1, it is a small little cafe which seats about 15 people. The place is a little cluttered. Good for breakfasts. But we were hungry and went for lunch. We ordered penne pasta with pesto sauce and a chicken steak. The pasta was upto the mark n good in quantity. However the steak was very hard, undercooked and not how it should be. When asked to cut it, as we were unable to, they said they can't serve. So overall, even after checking for high reviews in zomato I was very disappointed with the service.

Very popular cafe in sector 1, you would hardly get a sitting place in the evening. Sitting place is really a must want here. Minimalistic pristine decor, the food i must say is the pull here. Ordered green apple ice tea as litchi wasnot available and A mocha mystery in beverages. A caesar salad, bbq chicken and a walnut brownie. The iced tea was one of the best I have had bt yes a little bit less on the ice please. The mocha mystery was very very akin to a cold coffee with again high on ice. The caesar salad, well, seasoned with crunchy croutons, chicken and ice berg lettuce lacked the essential boiled egg tho.
The best dish of the day was bbq chicken, sauted in a sweet chili sauce, the chicken was succulent and heart warming. The sweet dish was a well made brownie with a dollop of ice cream. 
It was a great experience. The bill totaled to 802, with taxes. Well the taxes do hit. 600 for these items is a fair thing but who can help it.
There s nothing special to mention of service, waiting time is a tad long, we had to ask for the dessert. But then its always crowded.

 The waiters were bit disappointing.. they were not rude but there were only 2of them so it was very difficult to response quickly.
Else good and affordable..

Well it's a tiny joint in the calm Sector 1. Hardly 4-5 tables. But pretty decent decor. We had the following things:

Cheese Omelette: Two of us liked and two of us thought it could be better. The cheese was chewy which is not something that went well. Had it been a little liquidy, it would have been tastier.

Mushroom & Corn in Cajun sauce: Well this was an absolute delight. The creamy mushrooms and corns along with the while sauce with a hint of tanginess, I guess it really was amazing.

Funghi Pizza: With mushrooms, bell peppers and cheese it was thin crust pizza. And it was okay.

Grilled chicken pizza with extra veggies: Not a fan of pizza, this was an order by mistake. And it proved to be a tasty mistake. The veggies, grilled chicken, cheese and the crispy thin crust were all a celebration in the mouth.

Overall it was good experience with friends.

this joint is too small to fit the puja crowd.
since we visited this cafe on panchami,we had to wait oitside for 15-20 minutes
but the food we received after that was delicious and quantity too was good enough.
though the service was bit slow and to our utter shock we and the guys sitting on another table found hair in our drinks.
though they immediately changed it once reported.
deducting 1.5 point for this part of our experience only.

One of the best cafe near salt lake. The varieties of snacks r there. Especially,  mexican & continental dishes. We had enjoyed a lot of times. But space is small. Plz,  try to extend the corridor portion so that can accomodate more than 20 people at a time.

It is a cute, tiny little caf√©. Perfect for college students as the prices are quite reasonable. The downside to this place is it's very small, only 4 tables, so even on a regular evening you have to wait outside to get a table. Coming to the food-
1. Chicken salami pizza- the pizza was pretty good. Thin crust, the crust was a bit on the crunchier side rather than being soft. There was abundant cheese. Overall a satisfactory dish.
2. Fish & chips- very delicious. The fish was fresh and the tartar sauce was tasty. Loved it.
3. Mexican grilled chicken- this was my favourite out of all the dishes. The chicken was spicy, and was served with fried rice. A very tasty dish.
4. Chicken coleslaw sandwich- did not like the sandwich at all. The filling tasted bland, and I could just taste the cabbage.
5. Chicken salami sandwich- it tasted okay. Was a bit dry. A little bit more of cheese would have made it a very good dish.

While I used to go there pretty often, once I had to leave after 45 minutes because my order of an Irish Coffee was never prepared and after 45 minutes the person wanted me to confirm the order. While there was a misunderstanding, there was a lack of initiative to make up for it from there end. I have been there since then.

I've been to this cafe innumerable times and I must say that every time it has lived up to my expectations. I visited it on ashthami and luckily got my picture featured on their facebook post which won me a rs 500 voucher. The staff as I always felt is cooperative and cordial. This time I ordered chicken caesar salad, cappuccino and chicken coleslaw sandwich. All of them were tasty like always. I would recommend everyone to try their pizza which is a thin crust one . Looking forward to many such visits. :)

This quaint and tiny little place near city centre, salt lake is a joy for people like me who're on the lookout for good food at affordable prices. This place is not too hard to find, around 5 mins walk from the said mall and the landmark would be Kalyan Jewellers.
This cafe accommodates around 15-16 people at a time but there are chairs outside if one has to wait.
With coke studio playing in the background and a courteous staff, let's dig into the food.
We ordered pasta in white sauce(veg but there are options to add on chicken etc), barbeque chicken pizza (the one with 4 pieces), chicken quesadilla (not sure of the spelling ), Mexican grilled fish in main course and finally two chocolate shakes.

The pasta was accompanied by two pieces of garlic bread and generous amounts of mushrooms and tasted delicious and creamy. The pizza was good. The chicken quesadilla consisted of 6 wraps with succulent pieces of chicken and veggies accompanied by a dip, the fish was soft and tasty and the buttered rice enhanced the flavours although it was a bit too sour for our taste but pretty good nonetheless and last but not the least the chocolate shakes were heavenly.
The cost per person was approximately Rs 360 and the prices in the menu are exclusive of GST.
Would like to visit soon and definitely would recommend everyone to do so.

The place is small, yet cozy. Accommodating hardly four tables, the place definitely deserves one visit at least. It is very well thought out and executed, food is good and the ambience is more than just good. However the salami pizza had something they called home made salami, a little chewey, and the service was quite slow. #recommended.

Loved this place in short. Cosy and comfortable are the words to describe the place. And some great Coke Studio music in the background really adds to the feels.

We ordered a Hazelnut and a normal Cappuccino in beverages. To add to them we had Funghi Pasta (White sauce) and Baked Tandoori Chicken Sandwich.

Loved the coffees and the sandwich. The latter was just absolutely perfectly done. Right amount of chicken and no extra sauce. Everything was perfect for my liking. The pasta was good too. Not much of a pasta person, so I can't really dive into the details but it tasted great 

All in all a great experience for just Rs 389 bucks.

Recommended.

This place serves some mean dishes.. Among the newly opened cafes in Saltlake, this is one of the best.. Though the place is very small (and therefore you have to wait during the peak times), the food here more than makes up for the wait. Its minimally decorated, and the ambience is warm. The staff are courteous. You shouldn't miss their barbecued chicken burger. I loved their sandwiches and burgers more than the pizzas. The chocolate mousse will satisfy your sweet craving..

Tried this place for the first time today, and this will be the very last time. Cappuccino was questionable, expresso was awful, cold coffee was cringeworthy. Staff didn't know how to take orders.

Looking for a lit night accompanied with some yummy delicacies? Well this is the place for you then!
Conveniently located near City Centre I, this cafe will grab your attention with its bright ambiance for sure.
A small joint with a classic environment, in short.
Black and white texture sits right in the heart of this cafe.
Well decorated I must say :)

Coming to the food now, I was in awe with the variety of foods that they offer.
There's almost everything under one roof!
‚è©Chicken tandoori pizza was fabulous n you can trust me coz this comes from a non pizza lover!
The crust was thin and soft, baked with utmost care and filled with tandoori chicken all over! Cheesy n YUMMY!
‚è©Fhungi pasta is my favourite! Can have it all day long infact.
The bowl was decently served with great quantity of white creamy pasta tossed with mushrooms and chicken.
What more could I ask for?

‚è©As mains, we had ordered #Fish_steak and #Chicken_steak.
Both were served with decent amount of herbed rice, mashed potatoes and well sauteed chicken and fish.
Fish was baked in lemon butter sauce and tasted heavenly!!
Chicken was juicy and delicious. Wish it was little softer!

‚è©We were charmed by the finale of #brownies with ice cream immersed in chocolate sauce.
Hot brownie n ice cream as we all know makes a deadly combo and this portion surpasses the desserts in its own way!
Wish it never ended!
Staff was cordial and thumbs up for the excellent service. üëç

P.S. South Kolkata is eagerly waiting for Cal64. ‚ù§

I visited this outlet yesterday. A tiny outlet which can hardly accommodate 14-16 people located at the heart of Salt Lake. The ambience is good and price friendly menu. Ordered pasta in white sauce and chicken skewers. The pasta was average on taste (we felt that it was prepared in microwave) while the chicken skewers was good. Overall experience was good, point is one need to reach a bit early considering the waiting time in the queue.

I visited this place yesterday. It's location is pretty good easy to locate. 10 mins walk from City Center 1.
A tiny cafe which can accomodate 12-15 people.
A nice place small and cozy with good music. 

We ordered Bbq Chicken Pizza, Penne Alla Pasta and Oreo Vanilla Shake. The pasta was good. It was just too tangy I felt but it tasted fine. The crust of the pizza was too crunchy. Cheese was only on the top of the crust. The Oreo Shake was good.

The only problem was that when we entered the cafe we waited for 10mins to get hold of a menu. We had to go and ask for the menu from the counter. The cafe was pretty empty so a behaviour like this is very unprofessional.

Located about 10 mins away from City Centre 1, Salt Lake City , this 10 - 15 seated cafe caught my eyes while returning home after office and finally today I visited this cafe. Interiors are nice but they can hardly accommodate not more than 15 people at a time. Ambience is good. We ordered :-

1. Pasta in pink sauce :- Penne pasta in mix sauce basically, colours were quite vibrant, taste was very good and accompanied by 2 small pieces of bread.

2. Chilly and Paneer Pizza :- It wasn't that good. With  thin crust , pieces of paneer and green chillies were provided as toppings. Had much better pizza than this.

3. Chilly Cheese Toast :- Another item in menu that was very yummy , the toast was covered with chilly cheese and it was very delicious.

4. Chocolate Shake :- As the name suggests, Chocolate shake was much chocolacious and was quite good.

5. Lemon Ginger Soda :- Quite refreshing ; Flavours were quite enriching , loved it.

6. Double Chocolate walnut  brownie :- One of the best brownies I had till date, it will sinfully chocolatey accompanied by scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce, this one was another major gem of this cafe to try out.

Sadly Momo's and Chocolate Mouse were unavailable but I will surely make it a point to visit this cafe once again and try their other items too.

Eventhough Salt lake can be a pretty convoluted place to visit , this cafe was very easy to spot and very conveniently located . Navigating to it was a breeze , as it was situated just adjacent to the main road. The cafe however , is pretty small and cannot accommodate more than 12-15 at a time ; we were lucky that we could visit it while their were still ample number of seats vacant. Ambience is very plain but Kindy soothing , with some soft songs playing in the background , and a large glass window seals it from the exterior, making it a very scenic destination to eat your food. Coming to the food , we ordered pasta in pesto sauce , a BBQ chicken pizza , BBQ chicken with fried rice for the mains and a chocolate and walnut brownie for dessert. The pasta was good but the pizza was heavenly to say the least; the BBQ chicken with fried rice was good too but the dessert that we ordered wasn't as flavour rich as we would have expected, mainly because the ice-cream over the brownie was completely melted when we were served and it kind off deteriorated the taste of the combination I believe. Overall, it's a nice and quality place to relish some time with your quality friends and I would definitely be coming back to this place more often than ever.

It was a thin crust pizza and was indeed one of their special attractions.The mocha was good in taste but the pineapple juice tasted below average.

‚óÜ STAFF - Well mannered. The ready to help attitude of the staffs gather special attention.

A tiny cafe (can house not more than 15 people at a time) located at the heart of Salt Lake, serves outstanding food and to top it all, will never burn a hole in your pocket. 
What else can one expect?
Except for the fact that their pizza is a big turn-off, the rest is heavenly!!
When I say that their fish section is simply out of the world, I am not exaggerating at all.
Special Recommendation : Jalapeno Cheese Balls, Pepper Butter Fish and Fish Muniere! *_*

I ordered :
BARBEQUE CHICKEN :This item might be the best on their menu. They gave 6-8 pieces of chicken, sweet rice(pulao), and fried vegetables in dried spices. I liked spicy coating over chicken.It was amazing. The vegetables and rice were also tasty.

EGG CHICKEN MASALA WRAP : This item was average. Don't buy this.

Visited this cafe based restro quite late at night. Its located along the lane of kalyan jewellers near cc1. A bit of walking distance from momo i am. Had ordered sweet fresh lime soda, barbeque chicken, grilled chicken steak and lemon pepper chicken in main course all of which came with boiled vegetables and buttered rice enough for a person with huge appetite üòù actually the quantity of the rice when served was looking less in quantity but while eating it felt like too much for a single person. It could be easily shared by 2 people. Now coming to the taste... Tastewise barbeque chicken was good with medium spicy sauce. It had some 6 to 8 pieces of chicken chunks. But one letdown was the starting few pieces were soft and succulent but the latter pieces were so chewy that it seemed like that the chicken was not washed properly before being cooked. That was the only bad point. Other than that everything was fine. The lemon pepper chicken was good to taste. It was mildly spiced with a cheesy base and a hint of ,pepper. While the grilled chicken steak was for my sis in law. She liked it very much. The soda was served in a large glass and was good as usual. Hence the i liked this restro. Might come back to taste more of their dish while in that area.

It's a cool place to hangout, located near 3 no. island. Most amazingly, this cafe is named by its pincode. Went today for a quick bite after a movie at cc1, ordered for Irish latte (very smooth & pleasant) , french fries and grilled chicken sandwich (toothsome). Lovely food. It's a small place having 5 tables and one of the cheapest in salt lake area. But the cafe was awesome and the ambiance was lovely with a well mannered hospitality. Surely will go again.

This little restaurant tucked away into a corner is a stone's throw from City Centre Salt Lake, and it instantly caught my eye after I looked up its pocket friendly prices on Zomato.
Since then, I have been here thrice, and I intend to keep visiting it regularly, because of the delicious food and more than reasonable prices. However, the seating capacity is very less, and I have had to wait for a table each time I get here. Fortunately, there are little chairs placed outside the restaurant. The inside decor is well done, with quirky pictures and brick walls and polished wooden tables and chairs.
The last time I came here was for a late lunch with two of my friends. We ordered a Pasta in Pink Sauce, Grilled Chicken Steak with Rice, Paneer and Cheese Pizza, Double Walnut Chocolate Brownie, Fresh Lime Soda, Cold Coffee with Ice Cream, and a Chocolate Shake.
Even after ordering so many items, there was hardly a pinch in our pockets. We thoroughly enjoyed the food and were more than happy with the quantity. Special mention to the Grilled Chicken Steak and Walnut Brownie.
One request: Do expand the place!

This cafe near tank-3, sector 1 is a really pocket friendly restaurant, which offers great food and ambience.
Being located in a calm and quiet place, the cafe has got a nice atmosphere overall. Moreover, the outside sitting arrangement is really cute.
The one problem that the restaurant has is the space issue. There is very less space inside, only 5 or 6 tables. We had to wait outside for a while to get our table.
Coming to the food, we order
1.Baked pepper pasta
2.Pepper butter chicken
3.Mousse
The pasta came in a very large bowl which was sufficient for two people. Tasted quite delicious with garlic bread. They give a pretty good amount of cheese.
Next, the pepper butter chicken tasted totally awesome, with the rich flavour of pepper. It was a non spicy white gravy served with fried rice and veggies.
The mousse was a common choice though. And honesty, not much impressed with the taste.
I would surely love to taste other dishes there.
The staffs were really well mannered and behaved quiet well.
Overall experience was great. Starting from the ambience, food and services, everything was pretty awesome.
This budget friendly restaurant would surely win anyone's heart.

All our orders were upto our expectations. Penne Allah pasta won our heart. And I had my best ever chocolate brownie till now. Looking forward to visit this place again in winter.

Visited this cafe thrice and would love to visit if again and again. It's a small cozy cafe situated near city center having only 5 tables to sit. Most of the time we need to wait for a table. Food is just awesome for the price they serve. Previously they didn't take any tax but after GST they apply GST on every bill. But overall a nice cafe with awesome food to spend the evening. Waiting to have dinner here soon!!

Decent place. 
Pros: 
Food tasted great. 
Funghi Pizza was very yummy.
Fish Meuni√®re was also a must try.
Blue Moon Mocktail was also tasted very refreshing.
Cons:
Very small restaurant with limited seating capacity.
It's better as a delivery restaurant.
Also the service is really slow.

Very bad behaviour from the restaurant crew.....very suffocating place.....people standing on ur head for place.....other people in the queue frowning at u while u sit down to have ur food inspite of paying hell lot of money....not only that suddenly anyone might come and start screaming at you for occupying the space..... No interference from the Restaurant authority for such an abusive behaviour from a stranger all of a sudden ....the restaurant people has got nothing to say.....over all experience horrible....horrible service provided... Never gonna go there I swear.. ..yak yak yak...... A big NO for Calcutta64.....üòñüòñüòñüòñüòñ

Calcutta 64 is the perfect place for a quick bite of some delicious food.Its a cafe named after its pincode , but on the food part their is no compromise with the quality. The pocket pinch is just apt as per the food quality and the quantity. 
Commenting on the food that I had was Grilled Chicken Steak, Mexican Grilled chicken and Crunchy chicken. The chicken was soft and nicely cooked and and every dish was differentiated with their taste and spices.
I would recommend this place ,but you should be patient enough to wait as the seating capacity is approx 12.
Overall good experience.

Calcutta 64 is a small cafe named after the pin code of its location.After noticing much hype about this place , we finally decided to give it a try.‚ô•

Located in Sector 1,Salt Lake,this place has a seating arrangement for around 14 people.The ambience is quite good,spiced up with good music and lighting.

Coming to the food section,we ordered the following :

‚àö Mocha mystery : This is a refreshing coffee which made our beginning perfect.

‚àö Chicken Quesadilla : These had 6 pieces of tortilla wraps stuffed with enormous quantity of chicken and vegetables which tasted delicious. Recommended !!

‚àö Chicken Salami Pizza : The quantity of chicken on the pizza was really good in comparison to the prices.But the pizza crust was a bit harder than it should have been.

‚àö Fish Meuniere : This dish was the show stopper of the day. They offer two big bhetki fillets and rice with veggies. The bhetki was marinated with lemon butter and so well cooked and soft that it melted smoothly in our mouth. We were really satisfied with the quality of the fish. Highly recommended !!

‚àö Caramel Custard : We wanted to try Mousse ,but it wasn't available and hence with settled with this. It is a decent dessert but it tasted quite normal,nothing extraordinary.

The staff were courteous but they should pay a little more attention to the customer's needs.

Overall verdict goes like this - One of the best cafes at very cheap rates . It is obviously a must visit ‚ô•‚ô•

Went several weeks back with a friend. Ordered for cold coffee with ice cream for both of us along with a Griill Chk. Sandwich and 1 BBQ Chk. Sandwich. The cold coffee was good, and consisted the right amount of thickness to get the smoothness right. The sandwiches were also good to eat, only problem was that the BBQ one was a bit dry and could have had some proper filling to make it more moist and gullible. Overall, a good place to hang out.

Visited first time with a lot of excitements.. But it was a very weird experience like firstly they couldn't arrange two chairs for two seater table. We ordered  virgin mojito, bbq chicken pizza and chicken cheese momo. The mocktail and momo were good. Pizza was ok type.. Very thin crust.. Service was horrible.. Like I had to keep saying 4 times for forks..foods were served before mocktail.. And the mocktail came after requesting 2 times. So it was a very very bad service.. Specially one waiter was very disrespectful to the customers..

Barbecue Chicken Burger is a must! So is the pesto pasta. I usually don't spend money on vegetarian food, but I literally had half of the pasta from my friend and it was yum! Mousse was a little too sweet for my liking, though. 
Definitely recommend this if you have 150-200 bucks to spare. Should try this place out. The only complain about this place could be that the decor has nothing Calcutta-ish about it, which is something I was expecting.

If you need a cozy catch-up with your friends with really good food, this is the place you should hit without a second thought. 
Totally love the food there. Ordered BBQ pizza, Fish n Chips and coffee, and they made sure i was totally satisfied with the food, taste as well as quality. I would definitely recommend the Fish n Chips, juicy and perfectly made. Kinda goes easy on your pockets as well. 
The only turn down for this place is that it's a bit compact and there are hardly 5-6 tables. So you need to be a little lucky to get a place just when you arrive. 
One of a kind in Salt Lake! Go for it guys!! Strongly recommended.

This place had been in my list for a long time. Finally I could write a review after a wonderful time spent here. So the best way to reach this place is to walk straight from bikharam towards the rang de basanti dhaba, and keep on walking for a good 10minutes until you see Calcutta 64 on your left hand side.
This place is really small. 5-6 stools were placed outside. When you go inside you hardly find 4-5 tables.
We went around 2pm and could grab a seat. The decor is really neat. They even have a washroom. The staffs were really welcoming. They also play good pop songs which was a relief. We ordered the hazelnut frappe, chicken BBQ pizza and the fish meuniere.
The hazelnut frappe was smooth and tasted really good. It came in a huge glass. I could drink it up because it tasted good and also it wasn't too sweet. Definitely worth trying. Next came the BBQ chicken pizza. We ordered the regular one, and there comes 8 slices of thin crust pizza with good amount of chicken chunks. I had a real good pizza after a long time. But my personal favourite was the fish meuniere. It tasted amazing. 2 thick fish fillets sauted in butter sauce. The fish was so soft that it melted in our mouth. It was accompanied with butter rice and sauted Vegetables. Delicious and very filling. I'm gonna come back for it again. I was really impressed by this hidden gem. Kudos to the team.

Well i call it cafe awesome , stands amongst Bc block salt lake .
Isn't a very big place but this little food joint does deliver wonders.
I happen to like the pizzas here.
Grilled Chicken, Barbeque Chicken and Funghi pizza are something which will immensely please your taste buds.
Penne alla pasta is mentionable one too.
This particular joint is so far from my place yet the food here literally pulls me down.
The ambience and the staff is very gentle and good.
The pocket pinch is surprisingly very less.
Calcutta 64 is one joint which runs down ti be one of the best.
This place definetly deserves a ' must visit' tag.
A Calcutta 64 fan.

Located near City Centre, Saltlake, Calcutta 64 is a hidden gem! The place is albeit small, yet it has overwhelming potential! Cosy, cute interiors add up to the lively vibe of this place. 

Last week my friends and I had visited this caf√©!
We had ordered Chicken Burger, Egg Chicken Masala Wrap, two glasses of cold coffee, and a glass of lemon iced tea. 

While the Chicken Burger tasted good enough, what I really loved was the Egg Chicken Masala Wrap! Definitely a paisa vasool place.

Well, let me tell this is one of the cheapest restaurant when it comes to the location,so much that I literally came all way around from jadavpur just to taste some of the amazing dishes. It is located very close to city center 1, Salt Lake.,the place being known as tank no 3. 
Ambience : The ambience is pretty simple and sober, prim and proper with nice Arijit Singh movies playing in the background but nothing extraordinary. It is a very small place with a seating capacity of 14 people at its maximum. 
Food : There was various items that we ordered.. 
Mocha mystery- I have tried this for the 1st time in any restaurant. This is supposed to be a cool combination of coffee and chocolate. But I didn't like it that much as it taste almost like that of chocolate version of horlicks üòÑüòÑand the quantity of ice was a little bit extra so it was turning wateryüôÅüôÅ.  Not so recommended. (3/5)  
Chicken quesadilla : this was good.. Good amount of stuffed chicken and vegetable was loaded inside as the mayonnaise was given as a dipüòÑüòÑ (4/5) 
Chicken salami pizza : This is the best pizza that is have eat so far in any restaurant. The crust and the toppings both was perfect. There were good size of chicken salami given and it was just perfect. Although my friend felt that the portion of cheese was less but to me it just just perfect (5/5) 
Fish munuiere : This was also one of the popular dish of this cafe Two large size of fish pieces were given marinated well in lemon butter and parsley sauce. The fish were soft as he'll and the portion of rice and sauted vegetables was also nice and tasty. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  
Caramel custard : This is a very classic dessert and although it was a very tasted and tried dish it gave us immense pleasure to have it.  
  The food was good and we were satisfied highly. However the points have been deducted for one reason only and thats the service. They didn't even serve water even after 15 mins and on requesting only we were both the water as well as the menu.  They took nearly 30 minutes to even serve the starters so that comes unprofessional. üòëüòï

A perfect place to hangout after office. Very near to city centre 1, this place is having nice collection of various menu being a cafe. All foods are fresh and delicious in taste. We tried chicken schezwan momo which was awesome in taste. Smoky chicken & cheese wraps - good, Mexican Grilled chicken and baked tandoori fish-- fish dish was very nice, caramel custard and swiss pie . In all of these for just 1139/- for 3 person and trust me we were so full. The only point cut for this place is the seating area. It's very small and it is very difficult to get a place on rush hours.

surely one of the best cafe in saltlake area. Its very cheap for your wallet and the food is heavy fr your stomach.

The food was very good. we ordered Fungi Pasta and Grilled Sandwich and both were awsome.
second day we ordered BBQ Chicken Pizza and Fish and Chips. In both instances i was amazed by the food quality and quantity with price. The only con is this cafe is very small and they have only 5 tables. So you may have to wait for a long time also. But if your wallet is on diet then you may not have to be on diet if you go to this cafe.

If you don't believe you can eat one helluva three course meal without any pocket crunch even if you are broke, come at Calcutta 64 anytime and see for yourself.

To begin with, though the place is cosy and appropriately decorated bound to give away some comfy coffee experience with your squad but is distinctively small. Being a Sunday afternoon,
we had to wait around 15-20 minutes to get a table to ourselves. They were out of lime syrup, so that narrowed down the mocktails choices to Green apple soda and Strawberry soda. Both of them was chilled, breezy and perfect summer coolers. Their variety of hot & cold coffees has certainly booked another visit from my end.

In the appetizers we went for their popular BBQ chicken and Fish dumplings in Cazun Sauce. The BBQ chicken was extremely tasty, spicy and grilled to almost perfection and given the amount had great value for money. But the fish on the other hand was a bit disappointing. I did like the thick authentic cazun sauce the dumplings were tossed in but the fish doughs were too chewwy and dry for my liking.

The best of the course was their Grilled Mexican Chicken which came with steamed rice and veggies. Cooked in thick and spicy mexican pepper sauce, the pieces were tender and in fact enough to serve two people.

Ended the meal with their walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream as they were out of their house special mousse. No complaints on the desert section though, the brownie was as soft as a cloud and supremely delicious.

Their service was something which I found inconsistent. At first it seemed like one person is in charge of the entire place but then gradually people started to come out of the kitchen. The staff is courteous but confused. Could be a little warmer. However they are pretty fast with the orders. Calcutta 64 has a lot to offer at very reasonable prices. No wonder how it has slowly become one of salt lake's favourite points in a very short span of time.

A visit to this much-gushed-about cafe was long overdue and we finally made it this week. Situated not far from City Centre 1, this place is an easy find if you're consulting Google maps. The place is pretty small, with only seating space for around 15 people at any given time, so there's almost always a bit of a queue. Kudos to the management who have laid out some bamboo stools to wait out on the pavement outside. Tastefully decorated, with quirky paintings of Kalighat style Babus hanging from the walls.
We ordered the highly recommended Fish Meuniere, the Chicken Quesadilla, a Mocha Mystery drink and a Pinacolada. The Mocha drink was a bit on the blander side, we felt it could have used a bit more of chocolate syrup, chips et al. Coming to the star attraction, the Fish Meuniere, boy is it worth the hype! Two perfectly cooked and batter fried fillets in a lemon butter herby sauce are served with butter rice. The gravy was silky smooth and very flavourful, so much so that as soon the first bite got in, our table went a whole lot quieter. The Quesadilla was also good, but a bit more of cheese would have sealed the deal.
All of this cost us around 770 rupees after taxes which is a steal considering the quality of food.

Location : This place is so close to my home but I never got a chance to visit this hidden gem! So finally my best friend and I decided to give this place a visit and tick it off our wish list. It's located near Island no 3. Just a few minutes walk towards City Centre 1 and you're there.

Food : Cafe Frappe : This is a cold coffee. Very basic nothing fancy. But good quantity.
Barbecue Chicken Burger : This burger is quiet big for just 100 Rs . It will fill your stomach. The chicken was juicy, tender with a balanced barbecue sauce. It had slices of cheese and onions too. I liked the flavour.
Chicken Cheese Pan Fried Momo : This was mind blowing! These momos are better than momos served anywhere in the city and I can vouch for it. The size was good, the filing was perfect, they also garnished it with cheese in top. Again it was very very filling. It was served hot out of the oven. This has now become my favourite place to hog on momos.
Chicken Salami Pizza : We ordered a small one and we thought it will be enough for one. But my best friend couldn't have more after eating two slices. Though it was small, the size was quiet big. It was full of chicken salami, cheese, capsicum, onions and was super delicious. I didn't have a different kind and good pizza for a long time. It's thin crust and has a tinge of smokiness to it. Since my friend couldn't finish it , I did. Forget Pizza Hut and Dominos guys rush here!
Fresh Lime Soda : Refreshing is the word.

Decor : It's nice. The walls are done with picture frames that has an element of 'bangali ana' in it. Black chairs, wooden tables.

P.S. - Everyone needs to rush to this place now! It's super super super pocket friendly! The quantity and quality is great. You can visit this place even with a hole in your pocket. The staff is very courteous , polite and tolerant. Because I had called them a hundred times for various reasons and they catered to our needs with a smile on their face. The only drawback is their space. That's why I have given 4.5 rating. It's very small. The place can accommodate hardly 14 people. I would suggest them to expand their area. I've seen people waiting in cues outside and some people even leaving due to insufficient place to sit. This is an amazing place otherwise. Calcutta needs more places like this.

In the hoard of cafes in every turn of Salt lake, by the looks of it, this small cafe hardly stands out. But its the food that makes people wait outside in queues trying to get a place. With its limited seating and unlimited variety in menu, its a perfect lil place to catch up with friends over some good food.

Ambiance - Nice decor with some cultural paintings and a small book self. You can also pick n read a book if you wish to. Seating is seriously limited as they have only 5 tables.

Food - Everything i have tried so far has been good, some even amazing and few absolutely finger licking good. Must try things are Chicken Qusidellas,  Smoked chicken wrap, fish n chips and hot chocolate.

Service - Poor and slow and thats the reason for a 4 rating. The staff does not smile..neither at customer nor at each other. It looked like they were really unhappy abt working there. We asked twice for some extra sause. First time it didn't turn up and second attempt by the time they brought it, the fish went cold.

Price - Very reasonable and pocket friendly. Especially given the location and ambiance.

Overall a recomend for all cafe lovers who like good food on budget rates.

The service is pretty slow and the space is small. However the reasonable price and the quality of the food makes up for it. 

If you want to chat with a friend over good food, this is a place you might want to consider.

While scrolling down in zomato, the name of dis cafe appears..so went there one fine afternoon.. Well, it is situated near City Centre 1  so one can easily locate dis place..at the very outset it looks great but sadly i didn't find any extraordinary thing there..they occupied a small place and so  had a limited sitting area.so it was a bit congested. we ordered hot chocolate with cheese chicken omelette.Those were good.Though the price was moderate but service was poor.They were a bit slow and dats why we had to wait fifteen minutes only to give order.

Calcutta these days seems to be sprouting cafes with alarming speed and regularity.... As soon as someone has a little spare space Cafe this or a Bistro that mushrooms.. with predictable menus and substandard food and services  . But Calcutta 64 is not like that... Though it is a home run business on the ground floor of a residential house... The place is not without its charms... For instance I was struck by how pretty the slim wall of money plants looked just as one enters the Cafe. The cafe is a small one and seats only 14... But I understand there is a promise of expansion soon... And it should expand... As one finds a perpetual que of people waiting outside.. my friend and I tried the fish and chips and the chicken bruschetta both were delicious... But I can assure you you will be spoilt for choices in this cafe... The fish was especially good..m with the quality of fish being excellent and the cooking of it.. perfection.... the bruschetta was great too... And unlike so many other places who simply substitute bruschetta for toasties this was indeed bruschetta... Lovely brioche and nice toppings... The fresh lime and ginger lime drinks didn't disappoint.. only complaint I have is the slow service and the waiters not being informed or prompt enough... But it is a lovely place for a soire√©... Or two!!

One of the newer cafes on the block, Calcutta 64 is a tiny joint in sector 1, within walking distance of City Center. It can seat about 14 people at a time, with two four-seater tables and the rest two-seaters and some stools outside. As a result of that, there is a list of people perpetually waiting. We tried their fish and chips and chicken Bruschetta. We loved both. The fish was of good quality and fried to perfection. The tartar sauce tasted great too. Although a few more french fries on the plate might have been nicer. The Bruschetta was also delicious. The lime soda and ginger lime soda did not disappoint. The service is a bit slow, but the place is great for a little chit chat with a friend. The prices are also quite reasonable.

I could literally give out 5 stars if the place was bigger. Simple and yet elegant interior. Service is fine. What's better is the food. This bistro is just next door to my place and I cannot get enough of it. The quality of food coupled with the quantity at the given price tag is simply amazing. Mocktails taste amazing and the food is absolutely delicious.

Although the service is a bit slow but that doesn't make anything go bitter. 
The experience will still remain sweet and one would love to go back to the place again and again. 
The Chocolate mousse is a must try! üòç

This place is really the perfect definition of cute and cosy. The interiors are so well done in such a short space that it really impressed me. I had ordered chicken cheese momo and it was pretty good along with pasta in white sauce. Both tasted pretty decent and the price was very reasonable. There is usually a queue in this place after 6pm. But I did love this little Cafe and would love to try it again on my next visit to Kolkata!

Calcutta 64 is a small cozy cafe near No. 3 island. It was a Saturday morning when I visited this place and yet it was quite full to my surprise. Infact some people had to wait for the seats to be empty.
It has a seating capacity of about 14-16 people. The ambience was good. They've got good music playing and the staff member seemed nice.
So we ordered a 'Mocha mystery'. It was supposed to be a cold coffee or something close to it but it was was a little watery and tasted so weird that we had to leave it. Then we took 'Chicken salami Sandwich' which was quite good. Finally we ordered a 'Funghi pasta' which was so creamy and good. It was quite cheap and the quantity was a lot more than what was expected in that price range. It was so filling that we had no space left for desert. Next time would like to try some of the other dishes on the menu hoping it would not disappoint us.

You have to take a left from there ( 2mins of walking distance). The outlet is small and only 14 people are allowed to sit . Because last week i went there and it was full ,we had to leave. The service is slow as well. Hence i gave 4.5 stars .

We ordered latte coffee, virgin mojito, mocha mystery, chicken salami sandwich, bbq chicken pizza and double chocolate walnut brownie. Except the pizza which was not upto the mark everything else very well prepared and was tasty. The service was quick and the staffs were attentive. A must visit place. Good job.

A regular customer for almost a month but today's experience was the worst. C64 served the wrong order and even billed an order twice. We just asked to correct the bill without saying anything but again they billed it wrong, when we told them they reacted very badly and one of the person also used abusive language. No way we are going there ever again.

The place is a bit small, and that's why we had to wait for at least 20 minutes to get in, as it was full, we ordered mushroom omlette and chocolate brownie. The food was good, but the cost was very high. And now after the GST , I don't think, people will be able to afford the food expenses here. Even the quantity was not satisfying enough üòû

Have been to this place twice and both the times I was equally amazed to see how pocket friendly this place was. And it's a very small place and never do you see it's empty. Anytime of the day you go and you'll find it packed. So coming to the menu, we had the barbeque chicken pizza and the grilled chicken pizza. Both were good. Then we had the barbeque chicken burger which also tasted pretty good. And finally the grilled chicken sandwich which was very tasty. And among drinks we had the strawberry soda and fresh lime soda both of which were again decent items. So overall I've had a very good experience and would like to visit again and try the other dishes and recommend people to go give it a visit.

Have been visiting for quite some months now. It is located just near 3no. island opposite to Annex College.
I have tried a few things
My favourite are the sandwiches and burgers which are extremely pocket friendly.
The BBQ chicken is also very juicy and tasty.
The pancakes are a bit more sweet than usual. The chocolate shakes, hot chocolate are really really yummy.
What I don't like about the place is that it has a really small accomodating capacity and the main course dishes.

Continental food goes pocket friendly @ Calcutta 64

For more drop into www.konizfoodwheels.wordpress.com

Planning to drop in some great Continental food near Salt Lake area?  Or a bit of chit chatting and catching up with a friend over coffee? The best place to drop in is a fairly new cafe with a revamped superb menu - Calcutta 64.

Calcutta 64 is a continental cafe. It is a kind of shop, which creates a landmark of its own, with awesome food at a reasonable rate and does not compromise on the flavors of the food.

Location : The address reads BC-25,SECTOR-1 SALT LAKE CITY. This is just near No.  3 tank in Salt Lake. 

Decor and Ambience : Calcutta 64 offers a cozy ambiance, yet affordable to the pocket for having gossip with friends or meeting for the office purpose. Calcutta 64 will be truly the place ‚Äúwhere it all comes together‚Äù and if someone looks for the perfect spot to pass their time in leisure with their friends-this is it. Some beautiful paintings from the "Babu" culture of Kolkata adorn the walls which celebrates the name of the cafe as well as takes you on a ride to the yesteryears of Bengal.

Food : Calcutta 64 promises exotic Continental Foods with wide variety ranging from Snacks to Main Courses apart from Coffees, Tea and delicious Mocktails. The continental dishes we serve are the chosen ones to give your taste buds the best ever feeling and we are sure of making you happy whenever you visit.

Beverages :
1. Pina colada - This is a typical refreshing fruit drink and is made with fresh pineapple juice and coconut milk.

2. Mocha mystery - Spicy coffee and chocolate isn't as crazy as it sounds. Give it a try and you are bound to fall in love. 

3. Mocha Frappe - This is rich chocolate flavor and a hint of coffee, blended and topped with whipped topping. Grab your Frapp√© Mocha today!

Soups :
1. Cream of Tomato soup - A tangy soup of spice-tinged tomatoes, the Cream of Tomato Soup is a choice that perfectly pleases the Indian palate . A chunk of cream teamed with soup breads is worth all the try. 

Salads :
1.Cheese cherry pineapple salad ‚Äì This is an innovative salad which is not only a visual treat but also amazing to taste. This is freshly cut pineapple with cherry and cheese. The Ice cube makes it all the more delectable. 

Appetisers : 
1. Chicken cheese momo ‚Äì The cheesy chicken momo with stuffed chicken was amazing.  The deep fried Momos with cheese dripping out adds to the amazingness.

2. Jalapeno cheese balls - Crispy Cheese Jalapeno Balls with cheddar, mozzarella and Parmesan are a cheese lover's dream come true.

3. Masala omlette ‚Äì A spicy combination of eggs, onions, tomatoes and flavorful spices is a great way to start your day when teamed up with toasted bread.

Mains : 
1. Funghi Pasta- Pasta cooked in white sauce with mushroom and cream. It's super creamy and tasty. 

2. BBQ chicken burger - Chicken Burgers topped with sweet Caramelized Onions and drizzled with savory BBQ Sauce is hard to resist.

3. Smoky Chicken and cheese wrap- Wrap up smoked chicken, roasted capsicum and cream cheese for the ultimate food experience.

4. Grilled chicken pizza- This Grilled chicken pizza with cheese,onion and capsicum was yet another favourite of mine.

5. California orange salsa prawns - This was the USP.  the stir fried prawn with spicy orange sauce and served with herb rice is a deadly combo. 

Desserts :
1. Caramel custard - A delicious traditional dessert with creamy caramel over silky custard is a must try.

Try out the food prepared with love, to make a happier you. Drop into Calcutta 64 and feel the incredible food revamp your taste buds with a greater joy. 
Cheers!

Went there with hubby after reading reviews on zomato....
We had ordered mexican grilled chicken, mushroom and cheese omlette and crunchy cold coffee. 
Coming to mexican grilled chicken... the chicken was grossly undercooked despite returning it once... the sauce was ok and so was the rice. 
The omlette was too bland with an extra dash of salt in some places.
The only saving grace was the coffee. It was superb.
The best thing of the place was that is was pocket friendly.
I would never be coming back except if i just want to drop in fr coffee

Visited this place this afternoon with 3 of my friends. Located at BC block, Salt Lake, near 3 No. Tank opposite of Annex College. The cafe is very small, only 12-14 seats are available at a time. We had to wait for 15-20 min outside for getting a table of 4. We ordered many dishes. 
1. Chicken Schezwan Pan Fried Momo- it comes in 6 pieces tossed with Schezwan sauce. Taste is delicious and size of each piece is medium.
2. Garlic Chicken Sandwich- probably the best one among the dishes we tried. It comes with 4 slices of sandwich along with tomato sauce and potato chips. it is a must try!
3. Pasta in Pink Sauce- penne pasta with mixture of red & white sauces. Served with grated cheese & roasted bread biscuits. Quantity & taste is okay.
4. Barbeque Chicken Pizza- we went for a medium one. It has Total 8 pieces of pizza slices. But the decoration & ingredients are amazing but the crust is not so good at all. It is very thin & it can hardly be hold in hand. The crust was over-baked so it became kinda crispy. Overally, I will not suggest to order pizza.
5. Choco mousse- delicious choco cream with grated chocolate. Taste is good.
6. Double Chocolate Walnut Brownie- it is served with a scoop of vanilla flavoured ice cream along with choco sauce. Delicious dessert.
Overall experience is good and will surely visit again.
This time will try their mocktails & main courses.
And the service is not professional at all. Most of The staffs need to be more professional in their work.

A cozy place in salt lake. The decor an aura is indeed soothing and perfectly stands up to a cafeteria. We ordered Funghi pasta,mexican grilled chicken and chicken Caesar salad. For desserts we we ha@d their cold coffee shot with vanilla ice cream. The pasta was the best we had ever had in the city. The white sauce had depth in it's taste. Caesar salad was expectedly light and dressed up in cheese. However the chicken tasted mediocre. Their Honey glazed chicken tastes awesome though !To finish things off the desert was out of this world. Such a beautiful blend of taste and presentation earns them a 4.5 out of 5

The cheapest cafe in salt lake but with finger licking food and beverages. The quality of food is amazing and it is outstandingly delicious. I don't know how many times I've visited this place. Some of the specialities are like- pizza, mocha frappe, cold coffee with whipped cream,sandwiches and the entire poultry section of the menu. It's so damn pocket friendly. Each and every item tastes unbelievably yummy. It will definitely satisfy the crave for finger food. One drawback is that it's bit small. Only few people can fit in and hence you might have to wait a bit.  Otherwise no complains at all. Food,ambience, behavior of the waiters everything is 10 on 10.

A quirky name, a convenient location, amazing food and eversmiling and helpful staff makes for a perfect ¬†place to dine out at. That Calcutta 64 is already a crowd puller is evident from the fact that even after a heavy downpour ample guests were there and were even ready to wait if they had to. Team PanchPhoron was invited there for lunch and here is what you should order for a blissful dining experience-

Dropped in with my friends, had an amazing experience.Heard a lot about this place.on arrival discovered a tiny cozy place, simple decor with a tad classy touch.service is so prompt & the staffs are well informed about the whole menu.

This place may look small from outside but when it comes to their dishes they have a lot to offer.
We tried various dishes.

#PENNE ALA PASTA: - It just melts into the mouth & the crunchy toasts alongside provide a great twist to the dish.

#CHICKEN GARLIC SANDWICH: - Grilled to perfection & tastes excellent.

#PAN FRIED CHICKEN SCHEZWAN MOMO: - served in a stylish plate & equally well marinated in sauces.

#GRILLED CHICKEN STEAK: - A steak is all about the consistency & they score a perfect 10 on that.Tender & juicy.A great main course.

#SWISS PIE: - Ends your whole experience on a high, do you have a sweet tooth?, Then it's your‚Äã go to dessert.

So if you are looking for awesome food with less pinch on your pocket,then grab your friends & hop in.This is the place to be.

Ordered BBQ Chicken and Chicken Steak from this place one fine evening and now a big fan of the food. Both the dishes were very good. Will definitely be coming back for more from this kitchen. Will definitely recommend. Keep up the great work.¬†

Only suggestion, a lot many restaurants start off very well but then the quality goes down. Hopefully care will be taken to ensure that the same is not the case with you.

Barely 5 minutes away from City Centre-1, this Caf√© is a gem.
Looks great, feels great, serves great!
We had tried BBQ chicken pizza, Grilled chicken pizza, Mocha Mystery, Chocolate Shake, C64 Chicken Pie(with ample amount of mushrooms-MUST TRY!), Penne Alla Pasta with Prawn add on and Chicken cheese panfried Momo.
I absolutely loved the pizzas-thin crusted, cheesey and lovely ‚ù§ The smoothies were nice too!
I would strongly recommend this Caf√© to anybody.

It was a bad experience...., we ordered a red sauce pasta ... they added to much of parsley, they charge extra for putting vegetables in pasta.. n finally tasted horrible ... cheese chilly toast was extremely spicy, it was killing... ! Cold Coffee was okay. My suggestions is that pay a little more and chose some other place than this. Don't go with its price value. It's not satisfying at all.

One of the best places in Calcutta...I can bet, there is no other pocket friendly cafeteria in salt lake except Calcutta 64 which can serve such good quality food..! We ordered
Darjeeling tea
mocha frappe
Orange ice tea (a must try)
one chicken salami sandwich (includes 4 pcs)
one Chicken pan fried momo(includes 5 pcs may be...I don't exactly remember...I was so busy in chatting then ;D)
One Chicken Quesadilla(includes 6 pcs)
They served everything very quickly...and the food were too good! Specially the momos and the orange ice tea...Only the chicken Quesadilla took a bit late to get served.
Quality and quantity both were worthy...!
Only problem is that, the place is very very small..we had to wait a little...:)
We were charged accordingly the price which was very very reasonable and 18% GST were added...:)
The overall experience was very very good!

A Big Thank u to Calcutta 64 Team!
Keep serving good food!
And Keep Receiving Love!

Will see u soon... :D

I guess the cheapest in Salt Lake area. But the floor is too small and that results in congestion. I will visit this place to have food and beverage only not to hang out. But have a go if you are going for the first time.

We ordered :
* Canada cheese soup with chicken : Cheesy creamy thick soup 
* Nachos : Regular nachos served with tomato salsa,the combo of which is really tasty
* Cheese chicken momo : Chicken momo topped with cheese,so the momo itself doesnt taste that great like Wow Momo cheese chicken momos, can be avoided.
* Bbq chicken pizza : Tasted normal
* Fish muniere : 2 bhekti fillets in cheesy sauce,with fried rice. This type of dish tastes awesome always!
* Chocolate mousse : Tasted good but did not have a smooth texture,had a little bite to it which I din't like much
* Caramel Custard : This classic dish tasted great!
* Swiss pie : Made up of carrots inside,topped with honey,this was the best dessert. 
There are only 14 seats but we found place in it on Sunday afternoon. Ambience is good like that of a quaint neighbourhood cafe. 4 bamboo chairs are there outside,but nobody prefers it in this summer. Service is okay.

Nice place could use a bit more room .
Service is slow,really slow. Staff well behaved.Thin crust pizza turned out to be average. Burger could use a bit more dressings. And menu says provided with side of chips & dips which turned out to be some ketchup and the smallest amount of potato chips that too unsalted.
Pina colada was probably made from extremely diluted syrups.

I had planned to go there long ago, but for some reason or the other I wasn't able to. So, then one day I finally went to Calcutta 64 to eat, but to my disappointment, there were very few vegetarian dishes, out of which also half of them weren't in the Cafe because their oven wasn't working. The restaurant was completely empty as it is. I had to get up and leave myself, because the equipments did not work properly. Now I do not feel like going here anymore!

Calcutta 64 is a small restaurant better to say a cafe situated just opposite the Annex College. Nothing extraordinary is there about the ambience or decor. But the food here is really good. We had Grilled Mexican Chicken which was great. The rice,vegetables and the chicken-everything was just perfect. Then we had Chicken Quesedilla which eas great too-loved it. We had Bar-b-q chicken pizza as well which was good but not that much good comapred to the other dishes. The chocolate mousse was amazing. Good place to hang out with buddies over some good snacks. It was a good experience.

Dropped in with friends on a rainy evening. Cosy little cafe, quite close to City centre 1.
The staff are well mannered,and thoroughly in the know of the various dishes in the menu.
We ordered pasta in pink sauce,Mexican grilled fish, Barbecue chicken with fried rice,Grilled chicken pizza, and crispy chicken. Washed it down with crunchy cold coffee,mocha mystery,and cucumber lime ice tea.
Everything bordered on perfection. Definitely recommended. ‚ò∫

Ambience: We went on Tuesday evening and had a bit of a wait due to lack of space. Great location close to city centre Salt Lake. 4/5
Food: Best Chicken Barbeque burger I've had in Calcutta. The Veg burger was great as well. We had a small Funghi pizza which was pretty good except it had a crunchy crust, where I prefer a soft one. Chocolate shake was also worth the money. Expense was quite low as the total was 400 for two. 4.5/5
Service: Quick service and sweet staff. 5/5
Definitely one of the best cafes in Salt Lake. Recommended.

I had seen the reviews of it in zomato so wanted to try it for once. I ordered a chicken grilled pizza with sweet lime soda . The toppings of the pizza was good now the base of the pizza was like a chewy instead of being crispy. I thought there must be some baking issue so after eating i told the staff but to my surprise he only initiated saying the base of pizza wasn't crispy na.. 
Then he told me he is having a problem in the oven because of that the base doesn't get crisp from the past many days. I mean how could you offer a bad product to a customer intentionally. .you should have stopped servicing pizza till your oven don't get it repaired. . But you are serving it and burning customers money .... Don't waste customers money that too intentionally. . .

I must add an incident... We were there at around 11 pm... Their kitchen was closed...but still they had provided us .. awesome delicious food...
We ordered ceaser salad, barbeque chicken burger, and chicken steak... 
Ceaser salad was delicious, and so was the burger..
But steak was not that tasty... But the highlight is the price.. they are damn cheap... Which gave me cheap thrill!!! (Lol).. 
I vl suggest every young people to go and enjoy this place and food!!!...

I was planning to visit this place from a long time.üòá today at last we made it possible,and visited the place for a pending bday treat from my side. üòÅ
Situated at a 8-10min walking distance from CC1, a small outlet,max 15people can eat at a time..fancy decor,with beautiful paintings on the wall,hanging lights...overall a nice comfy place to hangout. üòÅ

The staffs were really helpful,though all of them were really not co-operating. Like the person who took our order, he was the only one to communicate with us and even if we had a query to others...they were just dragging the other one to go and talk..üòê

Ok so now coming to food..
For starters we ordered ,
1. Chicken Steamed Momo ü§ó
2. Crispy Chicken üòã
3. Fish Fingers üôÇ

Main Course,
1.Ginger Cherry Chicken Salad üòá
2. Bbq Chicken üòä
3. Thai chicken curry (red gravy ) üòê
4. Grilled Mexican chicken üòó
5. Chicken Skewers üò∂

Dessert..
1. Double choclate walnut brownie with ice cream. üòç

They took about 10-15minutes to serve.
And the Momo was served first.
Trust me one of the best momos I ever had. Six momos,fully loaded with tasty chicken filling,a different taste it had..yummy üòã and that soup..üòç So light and watery but really tasty ü§ó We didn't miss a drop..üòù

The crispy Chicken was again one hit item.
Chicken breast pieces fully flattened, seasoned with salt and herbs coated with cornflexs I think ü§î and deep fried to the perfection. üòçüòç Just too much crispy and tasty outside, though the chicken may have some more flavours inside I think ü§î

The fish fingers were okayish, the size was a little small as we expected according to the price..üò∂ Served with mayonnaise dip and few french fries. üòê

Now comes the main course. üíÉ
I personally had the salad,and requested them not to add mayonnaise to it.üòã It was a good portion for one person, lots of lettuce,cherry,chicken chunks, croutons with a gingery nice dressing..loved it.üòç
With mayonnaise it would taste a lot better I would suggest..üëç

Each chicken dishes had a portion of rice,cooked with some veggies..served with decent amount of chicken. ü§ó One plate was just enough for one person. üëç

Barbecue chicken was good, had that smoky flavour of barbecue..though by the taste I dnt think they have really barbecued the chicken,ü§î hence used a readymade barbecue sauce..but whatever,it was tasty..sticky sauce,had lots of big chunks of chicken.. Served with sauted veggies and the rice.ü§ó

Mexican grilled chicken was spicy, again served with sauted veg and rice.üôÇ The chicken was well grilled,had flavours to the bottom, with grated cheese on top, tasted really good with the rice..üëå

Chicken skewers had the same mexican sauce in it. Only here raw chicken was used to cook with the sauce, whereas the above dish had grilled chicken. üòä It had two skewers with 8 pieces in total,tasty oviously...liked it. ü§ó But I would prefer the grilled one much. üòä

Thai red curry was served with one portion of rice only.. Didn't like this much üôÅ , dnt know why..maybe lacking some flavours, and the gravy was a bit watery....ü§î And nothing tasted like thai..that spice...thai heat was missing ...üòê The taste was average I would say.üò∂

For dessert we had only one brownie with ice cream, which was bliss üòç The brownie itself was so tasty, chocolatey,full of walnuts and with the ice cream and chocolate sauce on top...just bliss,üòá Just the perfect way to end our dinner. üòÉü§ó

The bill amount was 1930 with tax, thanks to GST üòë
But for this amount of food, it's reasonable I would say..ü§î
However we had a great time there,enjoying tasty foods and laughing with frnds can never go wrong I think..üòÅ..will be back oviously to try some other dishes from the menu..overall a big Thumbs Up.üëç

Having moved back to Kolkata I was told that there is so much happening on the culinary experiments in this city.. The newest find in that quest for me is Calcutta 64. Accidentally bumped on it one day when I was literally craving for some continental fares..

At 8:45 in evening we had to wait for about 15 min and got a cosy corner table. Kudos to the interior guys who could make out such a small place into what it is.. Ambience is nice, clean and optimised. Its a bit cramped but that's about the only spoiler I would say.

Moving on to food, we ordered Chicken & cheese omelette
 ; Grilled chicken steak ; Fish Steak and¬†
Double chocolate walnut brownie to end the course. Omelette was just usual .. I would suggest shredded chicken stuffing than the sausages. Its just my personal choice ¬†though.

But the steaks got me drooling. Any place that can make a fish steak with the right kind of juicy flakes and not a single bite that is rare n rubbery is worth its salt as a good kitchen!!! The Fish steak was all juicy n rightly flaky. The Sauce with just the required level of tangy n with hint of mustard.. Compared to this chicken steak is always a cake walk.. With the standard set so high, the brownie came in as a bit of dampner as it was a lil more dry n crumbly. Nevertheless taste was good.

Overall great experience and planning for more of the stuff soon. This time I would look at the pizza fare...

A small, cosy and pocket friendly cafe on a calm street of Salt lake Sec 1. Was in the area with a friend and looked for cafes arnd n discovered this place.

Ambiance - Good ambiance with Cosy decor. Seating is quite limited though. Only 4 tables so we had to wait 15 mins to get a place.

Service - This was the only disappointing thing for which i have not given a 5 to this place. No one greeted us when we went it. No service staff smiled even once at us. They all had a very unwelcoming vibe. For me service is not just about food served on time. Staff behaviour matters a great deal.

Food - Simply delicioussss. We ordered Chicken Quesadilla, Fish n chips and Hot chocolate. The fish was fresh, fries were crisp, Quesadilla was one of the best I had in Kolkata and Hot chocolate, unlike other places, was thick and piping hot. Menu has a lot of variety. I wanted to try the Bruschetta but thr oven was out of order.

Overall a good place to hang out with your friends for coffee. Best part is its cheaper than CCD and many other cafes arnd.

Well looking from outside I did not expect this place will be this much good.
Although this place is a bit congested but the quality and varsity of food items will overlook that fact.
We ordered chicken pan fried momo , bbq chicken , chicken quesadilla & grilled chicken pizza.
Each dish was good in taste and in reasonable price.
I liked the pizza more as they make these a bit different that we get on dominos or pizzahut.
Definitely love to visit again .

Located just a short walk from City Centre 1, this cafe welcomes it's customers with a warm, homely ambience. With quirky and unique paintings on the walls, this cafe is dimly lit and provides the perfect getaway after a long and hectic day. Although, it could be a bit more spacious, so that people do not have to wait outside to get a table. The waiting is very inconvenient during summers.
I had visited this cafe with a friend. We had ordered 
1. Grilled Chicken Steak
2. Pasta in Pesto Sauce, with chicken add-on
3. Fresh Lime Soda
4. Virgin Mojito
The food was absolutely delicious. The steak was dressed in a sauce that tasted pepper-y and tangy and was beyond yummy. The pesto sauce was a beautiful green sauce, that coated the pasta and was pleasing to the taste buds. Being an ardent lover of lime soda, I had to order two, as I couldn't resist the wonderful taste. It was unlike any other lime soda I had tasted. It might be just lime soda, but there was something about it that had me ordering 2. The virgin mojito was absolutely marvellous. The drinks provided us with a lot of relief and we enjoyed the food a lot. Here's to visiting again.
Cheers!

One of the affordable food stops in town. A small eatery which can accomodate around 16 people. From various kinds of beverages to light snacks and also heavy mains and desserts they excel in most of the dishes. 

SMOKED CHICKEN AND CHEESE WRAP:- Coming to the wrap it was the best wrap i have ever had. The wrap was soft and the chicken had the perfect smoky flavour with the right amount of spices and mix of veggies in it. 

BBQ CHICKEN:- The bbq chicken was nice enough not the best but good. The chicken was soft and well cooked. Took around 15 minutes for the food to arrive. 

CHICKEN BBQ BURGER:- Made another visit to this place and I had ordered for a chicken bbq burger. It was priced at ‚Çπ123 inclusive of taxes. I have never been a fan of burgers but this was really nice and the chicken filling was not the conventional chicken steaks that one can find in Mc burgers. The best part was it is a must try for all cheese lovers. Also this was served with red sauce and potato chips.

CHICKEN SALAMI SANDWICH-- the sandwich was really tasty and was filled with chicken salami pieces and mayo. The bread was grilled nice. This was served with potato chips and red sauce. Wasn't their best dish true, but was well satisfied and worth the price. 

The staff was very courteous.  Well do i want to go back? Yes definitely gotta try their desserts and steaks. The light ambience and the pocket friendly caf√® is a must visit for all. Refer to my account for pictures of the food items that I have tried.

I have heard about this place a lot, but it did not stood upto my expectations. We have ordered Chicken Salami Pizza, Barbeque Chicken Burger and a Cold Coffee. Pizza was okayish. Chicken burger was dry and something was weird with the flavour. I have to think twice before hitting this place again. The service was super slow. The ambience was great but they should improve their quality and service to attract more customers.

This small cozy place is located nearby City Centre 1...ambience is nice with seating arrangements for 13-15 people at a time.

Service is bit slow... One Staff was there and he was cooperative.

I tried cheese garlic bread and cold coffee with ice-cream from this place.

Garlic bread was not at all upto the mark it was very dry and hardly one could find cheese and flavour of garlic in it...it just tasted like a small pieces of bread toast. Not at all recommendable.

Cold coffee was good though.

Pocket friendly place.

The price of the food items are reasonable. Service can be improved. To piece up, it is short and sweet. However i am sucker for artsy interiors, hence I would be bias and give it 4 stars.

Totally unsatisfied!

(1) lack of space
(2) Poor hospitality
Moreover,
(3) Poor taste of food

Expected tasty food after seeing the good rating on Zomato but returning with nothing! 

* Better try Terminal_11

What's good!? Definitely the chicken steak (it comes with a delicious mash and a portion of rice with bell peppers), grilled chicken burger, fish meuniere and almost all the desserts. Cold coffee and chocolate mousse - must haves. If you like thin crust pizza, go for the small grilled chicken pizza.
What's bad? Very small seating of only 15 people. We had to wait for around 20 min before we could enter.
Very pocket friendly. Menu exclusive of 8+8% GST. Washroom is very small and poorly maintained. Service is slow.

This small place is perfect for any two or three people to catch up with each other over some great food. We recommend the pizzas and the main course meals, which look and taste equally great.

Great place for desserts and beverages. We had cold coffee with ice cream and cold crunchy cold coffee which were AMAZING and perfect to consume on a hot summer evening along with smoky chicken and cheese wrap and grilled chicken wrap. The grilled chicken wrap was satisfactory.
We had choco mousse and double chocolate walnut brownie among the desserts.
The double chocolate walnut brownie is exceptionally delicious and a must-have if you ever happen to be here.
The service is overall satisfactory. But the place is not that spacious and the tables are clingy.
The overall ambience is however soothing.

To begin with, the place is a small joint, not spacious. Music was soft and fine. 
We ordered a hazlenut frappe which was more like a strong cold coffee, nothing of what the name suggested. Then we ordered cottage cheese with moroccan sauce which was something which people would either like or only dislike. Depends on individual taste. 

Service was not very good. They just stayed behind their table and you only had an option to raise your voice and call. All over, not a must visit.

I just loooove this cafe!! This cafe is small, cute, plays amazing music, serves delicious foods, treats their guests well, very neat and clean. near to my house, near to city centre- what not to love!!! I went there twice till now. Whenever I head to city centre I really want to go Calcutta 64 but its not possible always because of the boring people you go with!! 
I tried their Cold coffee, pizza( I forgot the name of the variant), barbecue chicken, chicken sandwich. 
I really want to go there again and again only to have their coffees in these hot days. Their cold coffee is really wonderful. It is thick, full of the flavour of coffee, brothy, whipped, and tasty. They serve it in a big glass so it is also a value for money item.
I like their pizzas too. They load their pizza with a really large quantity of cheese and chicken. I am like having a bite of pizza right now while writing about pizza!! 
Barbecue chicken is the only thing that I didn't like so¬† much as I liked the other things I tried. It could have been better. The pieces of chicken were not tender and juicy rather hard and chewy. It was an okay dish for me.
I liked their sandwiches. They really serve a great portion of sandwiches with chips. The sandwich was tightly stuffed with chicken, mayo, cheese and bell peppers. I loved the taste of it.
Salt lake has so many cafes here and there. But according to my opinion Calcutta 64 is the only cafe which is an Air conditioned joint, Serves quality food, gives you the hanging out vibes and the main thing is that its so pocket friendly!! After a long day you just can have some sandwiches, cold coffees with you friends or loved ones and chill for a while. Really recommend this place.

I have been recently visiting this place after suggestions from friends and seeing good reviews. This cafe will surely stand up to anyone's expectations given its food prices,  decent staffs and the amazing ambience it has. It serves delicious foods. The shakes , pastas , pizzas, snacks and desserts are a must try. The only thing which could have been better was the space , as this place is small. So many a times people might have to wait as i did if its full. To conclude it is a very nice place, serves delicious foods and desserts and a very pocket friendly cafe cum restaurant.

Had heard about this cafe from a friend who lives nearby. So went there. Though it's almost like on some other island (that's how non-Salt Lake residents of Kolkata usually refer to any place in SL. No offence though :P) takes almost an hour from place i.e. Jadavpur, I went there coz had some work that day in that 'island'. Oops.Sorry! Its like 5 mins in an auto from City Centre though. So much with the location! Phew!
Okay.Lets get straight to the food. No more beating around the bush. The food was quite good but could be better. To comment in a sentence, that is. I ordered Cold Coffee Crunch as I wanted to cool myself down coming straight from the angry glare of the Summer Sun. And, it did cool me down. It was too good--- cold and a strong taste of coffee-- a must have for any coffee lover. Now, being a lover of soup, I ordered for a Fresh Onion Soup and it was neat is all I have to say. For starters, I had Chicken Quesadillas. Again, nice and neat.Loved the dip that accompanied. Now, Fish Steak was really very good. It's one of their signature dishes or so I've heard and it was damn good. Well cooked pieces of bansha served with rice makes for a sumptuous main course. And it looked quite attractive as well. Perfect end to the grand lunch I had there. Will come back for the pizzas and  lattes with customised decorations. :)

So, it was a hot Tuesday and I was looking for a place to have lunch in Salt Lake, when I came across Calcutta 64. It was a small joint and the interiors were classy. 

Here's what all I had,

Beverages: Crunchy cold coffee - Stood out as one of the best item of the day. 

I then had Canada Cheese Soup, which was rich & creamy in texture! Quite enjoyed the bread crumbs that came with it.

For starters, I had Chicken Quesadilla. They were decent.

The Mains comprised of Chicken skewers & Fish Steak, and the Fish Steak is something not to miss out. This one is a must have.

Desserts included Double Chocolate brownie with icecream & chocolate sauce and Mousse. Both were as they should be, AMAZING! 

All in all, the place was good and it ought not be missed.

The place is too small and service not that good. It nearly took 50mins to get us our food which was just a Bbq Chicken pizza (medium) .We ordered other stuff later which we got faster ,but the pizza really took a long time. Apart from that, food was good,bbq pizza(Italian crust)was good. Price wise its good enough because rs.330 for a large bbq chicken pizza is an affordable price.
The chicken Salami sandwich was also good.
Overall‚Äã the place is okayish and the food was decent.

This place was in my wishlist for a really long time. I along with a few friends of mine visited this place today. 
It is quaint little cafe situated close of CC1. The walls are decorated with cute and innovative painting and wall facing the road is made of glass, so I guess a seat beside that wall during evening would be great. 

Now coming to the food, we had ordered a lot of things. 
For the beverages there was-
1. Strawberry Smoothie 
2. Crunchy Cold Coffee
3. Pina Colada

We had also ordered  two soups-
1. French Onion Soup
2. Canada Cheese Soup

For the starters, we had-
1. Chicken Quesadilla
2. Fish Dumplings in Cajun Sauce 
3. Chicken Momos

For the main course, we had-
1. Chicken Skewers 
2. Fish Steak

For the desserts, there was-
1. Double Chocolate Brownie With Ice cream and Chocolate Sauce 
2. Mousse
Each and everything that we had ordered was excellent but among all these the most recommended from my side are-
1. Crunchy Cold Coffee
2. Canada Cheese Soup
3. All the Starters 
4. Fish Steak
5. Double Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce. 
I would recommend everyone to visit this place atleast once and I am sure it won't disappoint you guys. 
Happy Fooding ‚ô•

Finally ticked off from my bucket list. and let me tell you, the gastronomical experience was breathtaking. 
                        Since salt Lake is very confusing and you wouldn't want to get lost, i would recommend you to use GPS from city centre to reach this place, it will take you roughly 5 mins by walking, no criss cross, keep walking straight and on your left you will see this little hidden gem! A cozy and comfortable cafe decorated with wall paintings, this place will lift your spirits up once you enter. 

Now this place offers alot of diversity on your palette and since our greed was infinite but owing to our finite pocket power we decided to try out some of their signature dishes! 
On the beverage front, the pina colada, the strawberry shake and the crunchy cold coffee are some of the shakes which are bound to shake you up, refreshing and energising! 

Among the appetisers, we tried their newly launched chicken momos which i felt could have been abit better, though i am not complaining, they were quite adjusting to my taste buds! The chicken quesadilas were stuffed with adequate fillings and this dish packed alot of punch! For the health conscious, quesadilas should be your go to option! Do try out their fish dumplings in cajun sauce too, I personally loved this dish. 

For the mains, we had chicken skewers and fish steak. Both the dishes came along with mashed potatoes, rice and veggies. The fish steak was soft and juicy, the way i wanted it to be, highly recommended! 
We tried a few of their deserts too in the form of double chocolate brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce. For all those sweet tooth lovers out there, go for this one you won't be disappointed!  You can try their mousse too!  
The presentation and the quality of their servings are unmatched and unparalleled. They do take abit of time in preparation the dishes but hey!  I don't mind waiting as long as they serve me some good food and this place certainly rose up to my expectation.

Finally,  I got to visit this little quaint cafe at Salt Lake Sector 1.
Situated at a 10 mins walking distance from City Center 1, this is a small food joint has created quite a buzz by attracting a large number of patrons, mainly office goers and college students.

AMBIENCE: The place is really small, yet not crammed up by unnneccesary seating arrangements. Can accomodate around 15 to 20 people. Has a clean washroom too. The place is quite vibrant with good lighting. Has a laid back atmosphere. The decor is simple and minimalistic, which makes it all the more inviting.

Service is on the slower side, but considering the facr that each of the dishes were made from scratch, had no room to complain.

Coming to the food, a well curated menu was served to us, which includes the following:
Beverages:
1. Crunchy cold coffee: Classic cold coffee which tasted good.
3. Pina Colada: It was good and had various flavors. I could understand the hint of coconut used. It was thick and heavy.

Soups
1. French Onion Soup : This is a classic French dish. I must say that justice was done regarding the preparation of such a rustic and classic dish. Accompanied by croutons, this was a simple in flavor, yet a hearty dish.
2. Canada Cheese: more like diluted cheese fondue with chicken pieces. The soup was smooth and one could taste the cheese flavor. The chicken bits elevated the taste and goes well with the croutons served as sides.

Starters
1. Chicken Quesadilla: Getting the tortilla right is very important for this dish. Thankfully, the tortillas here were crispy and well cooked. The filling was minced chicken with onions and bell peppers. The flavors were good and the simplicity of the dish made itball the more appetizing .
2. Fish dumpling in cajun sauce: The fish used was fresh basa. Very flaky and moist. The cajun seasoning was spot on. Recommended.
3. Chicken Momos: We had the pan fried version. The filling was great. Generous with the chicken. Tasted better wirh the spicy red chutney served with it.

Mains
1. Chicken skewers : Served with herbed rice and butter sauted veggies. The main attraction is the chicken ofcourse, which didnot disappoint. It was on the spicier side and one could taste the variety of soices used in its marination. The chicken could have been a bit more tender.
2. Fish Steak : Absolute beauty. A delectable dish with really fresh basa fish being used. The fish very tender and flaky. It was like cutting a butter with hot knife. The cheese sauce on top tasted good and complemented the fish. Came with a sides of mashed potatoes and rice.

Dessert:
1. Double Chocolate brownie with icecream & chocolate sauce: This is easily one of their best desserts although I would prefer a bit more crunch in their brownie. Chocolatey delight for people with sweet tooth.
2. Mousse: Had a nice smooth and velvety texture. Tasted good.

USP: Good assortment of dishes available in their menu. Affordable prices. Courteous waiters.

Location:
Calcutta 4 is a small located just few metres away from City center 1 and opp. To Annex college in prime locality of Salt Lake sector 1.

Ambience: Small but well decorated! Can't ask enough from that small cosy place. There are few beautiful arts decorated on wall and those are on sale too.. Bright light and lovely music playing in the background, perfect setting for some quality time with your friends.

Food: I went with a group of bloggers and had an elaborated dishes to taste. Starting with beverages - Cruncy cold coffee & pina colada, both were nice but I found pina colada best of the lot as it was refreshing.
Canada cheese soup was something that was too delicious and probably the best of all the dishes I had. It was creamy and smooth.
Starters i din't like much, it was ordinary. Chicken quesadilla is something you should try.

Coming to main course, chicken skewers and fish steak was yummy. Fish tasted fresh and chicken skewers was very juicy! Also the buttered rice and sauted vegetables were perfect.
Desert I had brownie with icecream and chocolate sauce, which was good as expected. Brownie was soft which seems to be the issue in many places. Chocolate mousse was good to end with.

Service: Service was bit slow I assume. Not many crowd was there still they took some time to serve the dishes. You can't take more than 20 mins to serve momo atleast. But overall it was okay considering the vast variety of items we were served.

Definitely recommended to one who are looking for some good continental dishes with good beverages to go with near salt lake area.

Well it's a relatively new small hub near city centre 1 serving relatively good food considering the price. The thin crust pizzas are damn good. But only one thing I would like to suggest them, that they should be more careful while packing the momos as they were all broken up.

Excellent, Superb, Mindblowing !

This place looks small and common like any other evolving new eatery. On your way you might just ignore or choose not to go. And that would be the biggest miss ever.

Good things First = > Great food ! 

Nice drinks, we ordered cold coffee and Strawberry vanilla ice. The later is a must try.

Next came Fish and Chips and...... Oh ! My palate was thanking me for ordering that ! Big fillet of juicy fish, lovely batter, greatly cooked.

Smoked grilled chicken wrap then came, hugely stuffed, nice and smoky flavour and lovely sauce !

Being already full but yet greedy we ordered a chicken steak which came with choice of rice and mashed potato was another burst of joy for the foodie tummy of mine ! 

Happy and over-eaten we kept the desserts for the next time, because, of course I am going to come here the next time for some more.

The best part IT IS incredibly CHEAP !

I could have stopped here with praises, but I need to be a bit critical as well ;)

I think they should work a bit more on training their new staffs and the space crunch issue !

Truly doing justice to its name, Calcutta 64 defines the word ‚Äòperfection‚Äô. As someone who loves the concept of bistro, this little beauty has become a personal favourite now. The brilliant eatery with fantastic d√©cor, ambience and prime location leaves little more to desire.

Tucked away on the famous boulevard, the glass fa√ßade offers a breath-taking view if you‚Äôre planning to bring someone special. From the stunning setting, complete with cosy nooks to the enticing menu of modern cuisine whipping out decadent savoury as well as desserts, trust me it is the best combination to woo her.

Coming to the food, I will list some of my personal favourites, but whatever picks your fancy I would suggest you to go for it. There won‚Äôt be any regret. Different is always better. The thin crust grilled chicken pizza and the chicken salami sandwiches never fail to put a smile on my face. The hazelnut frappe is a summer time favourite while the varieties of coffee are every worth the dime. And if you order the coffee, the latte art is a huge turn on as well.

And the best part in all this.  TAX inclusive. So go large and still it won‚Äôt leave a hole in your pocket.

I would definitely recommend you to try this if you‚Äôre planning for a sudden meetup with old friends or just to kick back and have a nice conversation with her while sipping on some evening coffee. Do give this place a visit.

Having heard good feedback about this restaurant from a friend we decided to try it out for lunch. A small place..with merely 5 tables.. 10 min walk from city centre.. place was well decorated with innovative paintings.. we ordered grilled chicken burger, bbq chicken burger, grilled chicken steak and honey glazed chicken.. the burgers were good.. nothing extraordinary about them.. but the honey glazed chicken.. my god.. it was hard.. undercooked.. it totally sucked.. we could not eat it.. the service is painfully slow.. the steak came 49 min later.. almost when we thought they had forgotten about it and were ready to leave..  even this was undercooked.. I kept on thinking how can people rate this food as 4.5!! It's simply pathetic.. anyway.. we did not like this restaurant at all.. would not recommend it to anyone.. the only positive side was the food was damn cheap.. so many items and the bill was just ‚Çπ700..

A small and quiet place near CC1. It is easy to locate. India was playing Srilanka at that time, and they played it on a TV.
We ordered Smoky Chicken and Cheese wrap and a Chocolate Shake. The Chocolate Shake was good. They serve a good quantity.
The wraps were okay. I really feel they need to have more cheese in it. You get the Smoky chicken flavor pretty nicely.
The service is prompt and the staff is friendly. It is ideal for a small hangout.

Located near city centre 1 salt lake just few blocks away from the landmark but do work with your navigation if you feel that salt lake is very confusing.

The ambient location with a minimal exposure and a limited seating arrangement but a perfect cafe to be with everyone. All being the best foodie location.

FOOD
Garlic Chicken Sandwich - Well prepared chicken with a fresh garlic taste with mayo adds up a reviving feel of a good sandwich. Not overly expressed in terms of adding too much flavour of garlic but essentially smooth.
5/5
Chicken Salami Sandwich - a nice tender chicken sandwich adding salami and mayo which was decent enough for a commendable sandwich formation.
4/5
Chicken Cheese Fried Momo - Well this was a let down in terms of all the other dishes that we tried out here. Since the name itself suggest that the stuffing will add the cheese making it more like an Italian experimentation on the dish but to our disappointment the cheese was fried on the outside making it a dull add-on.
3/5
Pasta in Pesto Sauce with a chicken add-on - well prepared and presented pasta in pesto sauce and garlic bread.

Whatta a discovery!! Zomato users never fail you. Such a high rating and it's worth it. I am so happy to have found this cute little cosy joint that I am reviewing it straight from the place after one of the most satisfying meal in recent times. We ordered cucumber lemon ice tea and pinacolada. Pinacolada is a star, my friend insisted we order again at the end of the meal!!! Then we ordered bbq chicken and Mexican grilled fish from their mains for our dinner. It took 15-20 mins for it to get served. And they were cooked to perfection. Excellent seasoning and dressing for the steamed veggies. Succulent chicken pieces and fresh fish pieces. Along came fried rice which is buttered steam rice flavoured with bell peppers, very light , aromatic and tasty, goes great with the mains as it accompanies fine but didn't overpower. Bbq sauce was sweet and smoky and the Mexican sauce was hot, spicy and peppery. I am highly impressed.
I hope the place gets bigger in no time, need more tables, need larger place and the same awesome dishes. Well done.

Ordered food twice last week from this place close to my office. The first time I ordered two plates of pasta - one with white sauce (Funghi) and the other with pink sauce. The white sauce one tasted really good, but the pink sauce one was sweetish!

The other day I ordered rice with vegetable green Thai curry. Was good, but the curry was too sour. I think they just need to be a little more careful.

We tried Chicken Steak, and they did serve a pretty good sized portion. The Mexican Grilled Fish was superb, too, although it could have been a little bit less spicy. Also, the Pi√±a Colada and the Lemon Ginger Soda were really nice.

Would definitely like to come back again, and really hope these guys make it big.

Gem in a making.
A very small, cosy outlet snugged in a quiet lane of Salt Lake, this restaurant is a gem in the making. The food quality is over the top. Although we didn't try much, we had pasta, garlic bread and nachos, but all in all it was a great experience. 
The mocktails are drool worthy. We had tried the blue moon (the waiter was constantly trying to sell it, don't know why), oreo chocolate shake, fresh lime and orange ice tea. They were quite amazing and refreshing to start with. The service is a tad bit slow and the waiters need to belt out their best dishes when asked for. 
This is a fresh start for Calcutta 64, but I strongly believe they will go for the home run, in becoming the best of restaurants here.

Ordered a few dishes of rice and chicken. Quantity too less ! The rice was buttery. The chicken though was tasty, tender and juicy. Hence the 2.5 stars !

Small cafe near City Centre Salt Lake, situated on the road. Indoor seating of around 10-15 people, and some limited outdoor seating, which is the only drawback of the place.

Robust menu for breakfast and evening snacks - pastas, salads, wraps, sandwiches, eggs and toast. Tried the Chicken and Egg Masala Wrap and the Masala Omelette, was quite good.

Beverages are also pretty uniformly good. Tried the Cafe Frappe, Mocha Mystery and Lemon Soda. 

Decent dessert options also available. Friendly staff, nice ambience, good decor.

All in all, nice place to hang out with a small group of friends or on that date with a special someone.

Yay yay, it feels so good to spend money on something worthy especially when the food is cheap and yum.

Location :  UBER was my saviour. The only thing I can tell you that it is in the walking distance of City Centre, Salt Lake and is located right opposite to Annex College .

Ambience : Very small, a cafe serving such amazing delights should have a big place so that we can relax and enjoy the food . They cannot even fit more than 10 people one at a time, it will get so fussy inside . And under this heat, I cannot even think of advising the chairs kept outside. No complaints, otherwise.

Food : Ordered Virgin Mojito and Lemon Ginger Soda, would prefer the former over the latter because it was more refreshing and cool . Next we had ordered, a BBQ PIZZA and Pasta in Pink Sauce, which comes with two garlic breads . Basically, I don't have anything to write about their food, I guess it is one of the very few cafes in Salt Lake, serving good food within a limited budget . The way it was presented was very mouth watering indeed, and the food was heavenly. Another must visit cafe for all.
The total bill came around 700 bucks for three people , which was justified . Thumbs up, to their decoration skills both interior and culinary !

Have a wonderful time all of you, gorging on food and visiting eateries!

A cozy and a cute cafe in Salt Lake is creating quite a buzz these days. This cafe is very popular among the people from in and around Salt Lake. I wanted to visit this place for a long time and it was by sheer chance i got to visit the place. Thanks to our friends, Anusreea and Swarnava for suggesting the place.. First I tried the shakes and they are amazing.. Tried the Mango Shake, Chocolate Shake and the Strawberry Shake. Each shake was really thick and amazing in taste. In starters, had The Chicken Crisps with a crunchy crust and with fresh chicken as the stuffing.. It was wonderful.. I really liked it as i have never tried something like this before..¬†
Then I had the Chicken grilled Pizza which had nice crust with decent amount of stuffing and cheese toppings on it.. Now came the Grilled Mexican Fish which had wonderful spicy taste to it.. The fish was fresh with a thick fillet and ¬†a tangy gravy with grated cheese with mashed potato and veggies on the side.¬†For dessert, had the chocolate mousse.. The texture was very nice and it was not very sweet just the way i like it..¬†The place is always filled as It has a very friendly vibe to it and People of all age group come to this place for chit chat and a nice meal at a decent price.¬†Do give a visit to this place.. You'll love it !

Music in the background
But,overall cool place to hangout & make your tummy fill üòç

Behind a veneer of a contemporary look lies this very ordinary place in Salt Lake. On the outside, it looks tempting. Even the service exudes a sense of warmth even though it is painfully slow. However, the major disappointment was the food. The sandwiches and burgers were very bland and defeated the purpose of eating out.

Also top it up with tobasco sauce .
Also have the cool blue and Virgin mojito as summer coolers .

Its a small cafe in Salt Lake sector 1, it has beautiful ambience with paintings on on side from which some were for sale. Its a small cafe so not too much place to sit.

The staffs were nice the service was a bit slow. We ordered pasta(Funghi) and scrambled paneer wrap. The quantity of pasta was good and it tasted great and so was the wrap.

I guess i will be coming here often, a great cafe with great food and good ambience.

A much needed cafe in salt lake which is cute as well as pocket friendly.
With it's wonderful staff and amazing offers, they keep the crowd attracted.
I have been a regular here for the past few months.
Every time I decide to beat the heat I sip on the cold coffee with ice cream and they can do some crazy coffee art on the cappuccinos!
Coming to the solid food, the non veg pizzas are amazing.
They are freshly put of the oven each time hence they take 20-25 minutes to serve them.
The non veg pasta in white sauce had a bit too much garlic and I didn't really like it.
The chicken burger is very filling and so is the club sandwich.
The chocolate mousse ia really amazing and you can give it a try.
Will I visit again- If I could I would go everyday !

The first day I stopped by Calcutta 64, there was no space! There are 3-5 tables strategically placed in this tiny cafe. The next time we tried it was late into the evening and thankfully found a spot!

We ordered the following:

Chicken Thai Red Curry (‚Çπ240): I'm a huge fan of thai curries + their biggest critique. You wouldn't need to know much about thai to say this curry was a fail. Sure, it looked great, smelt great but taste wise it was sour! Probably an overdose of lemongrass?

BBQ Chicken Pizza (large for ‚Çπ330): I've read much about the thin crust pizzas here. Eight big slices of pizza for this price is excellent! With generous chunks of chicken, this dish was on point, a little on the sweeter side (BBQ sauce is so). I found the tomato sauce base under-seasoned though. The vegetables were not sauteed so, if you didn't bite into a piece with chicken, the salt was definitely lacking. Apart from that it was great.

Orange Iced-tea (‚Çπ70): Slightly uncommon, this orange flavoured iced-tea proved to be a glass of nostalgia with its orange candy flavour.

Double Chocolate Walnut Brownie (‚Çπ120): Let me put this straight, this was not a brownie. This was a big chunk of chocolate cake-mix cake with little bits of walnut, a scoop of ice-cream and chocolate sauce. If you're not picky, this is okay. My brother found it quite nice.

Calcutta 64 scores when it comes to their pricing, very reasonable. I think a little extra care in seasoning will go a long way. Although small, it's a nicely done space. Looking forward to more!

A small quaint cafe in salt lake is slowly becoming the favourite hangout place for the residents of that area. I discovered this hidden gem while visiting salt lake for some work. I thank   Anusreea and her husband Swarnavo for helping me locate this place. 
Tried the Mango shake, Strawberry shake and the Chocolate Shake. Of all I loved the Mango shake the most.
The Chicken chips are the perfect snacks for light hunger. 
The Mexican fish is an absolute delight!! The perfectly grilled fish comes in a tasty gravy accompanied with mashed potatoes and veggies.
For dessert tried the Chocolate mousse , which was beautiful and creamy.
The items are very reasonably priced .
The place remains crowded during weekends , so might have to wait for your turn.

A long walk from Cc1 can take you to this place. The cafe is pretty small but ambience done right ! We ordered honey glazed chicken and barbeque chicken pizza , the chicken preparation was pretty good , but the pizza just stole the show , right amount of cheese and chicken chunks adding flavour . Very much pocket friendly , though the service was pretty slow .

A nice place for a cup of tea or coffee..food is quite better than a lot of cafes in Kolkata but you have to wait for your food for quite a bit of time....4 to 5 tables and they have four waiters for them and even then u can't get their attention....they are busy chatting amongst themselves....they need to pull up their socks in the service division and need to get a slightly bigger place....

For someone who's visiting the first time,be sure to be treated not in the same way as a regular.That being said,I wouldn't be visiting you a second time.

Before I start writing my review I must say that this is a must visit eatery. üôå
I already have been here twice, gonna come back again üòÇ
It's located in BC 25, Sector 1 , Salt Lake. If you come from City Centre1 - Straight pretty long walk, bang opposite of Annexe Management College. üìç

Nowadays it's difficult to find a eatery which serves good quality foods by inexpensive prices, where we found CALCUTTA 64 qualifies into that at it's best üòãüòã

This eatery is a tiny place yet has beautifully managed setting arrangements with wooden chair - tables which accommodates approximately 14 souls, a roadside glass lets you see the road view while enjoying your meal or sipping over cold beverages with ear on background music. Hanging paintings some of which are for sale, an extended part of it contains small bamboo stools and small tree tubs which makes the place quite decorative and appealing. 
Well, beside this I must consider that the place stays overcrowded most of the times. Inside interior isn't spacious although, one can easily eavesdrop your conversations which is quite uncomfortable üòå

Foods we have tried so far are as follows : 
o Chicken coleslaw sandwich : 
It comes with tomato sauce and potato chips. It tested good, crunchy. It had 4 sandwich pieces. 
o Veg coleslaw sandwich : 
It comes with same items as chicken one. It had good veggies inside, I really liked it more than the chicken one. 
o Grilled Chicken pizza : 
Which was staffed with grilled chicken, cheese, onions and capsicums. I am fan of pizza yet tried it. It tested yummy, so good. I can bet if you try their pizza you'll forget about Pizza hut! üòãüòä
o Fresh (Mixed) lime soda : It was over salty somehow!
o Chicken Thai curry- green : 
It was served with rice and Thai green curry in one platter. Curry tested good, gravy part was more than chicken pieces. But it lacked the instinct of magood lime somehow otherwise it was good to try.
o Lebanese Panner Steak : 
It tested awesome üôå, a must try. So delicious! It was served with rice, two big panner pieces and mashed potatoes. Panner was cooked with light gravy - which is a mixed paste of eggplant, limes, olive oil, 
It had strong instinct of lime and tested sour, I found it quite refreshing and equally good in quality and quantity. Worth to try ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ. 
o Grilled Chicken Steak : 
Was served with rice, juicy chicken steak topped with poached egg and mashed potatoes. So delicious üòãüòã
It tested heavenly. Wow! üôå Value for money ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ! 
It was equally good in both quality and quantity. 
o Creamy fruits salad : 
Sadly this was a disappointmentüòêüòê! It was prepared with fresh cream and milkmaid. Cream was not good enough to moist the fruits though, it was very thin and poor in quality. Neither fruits were huge on any medium sized bowl. It was served in a small sized bowl with mixed fruits - bananas, green and black grapes and apple. I didn't find it value for money!

We both were completely filled so couldn't try desserts.¬† Will try in our next visit. 

Service was good. It took quite lengthy than estimated to bring the foods on table but it was worth the wait. üòÄüòä
Prices are all inclusive Tax and Vat üòÑ

Overall experience ||
Foods : 4.5/5
Service : 3.5/5
Ambience : 3.5/5

Hope you find it helpful and enjoy your visit! üòäüòä
Keep checking my website chetepute.com
I will come up with more detailed portrait.

Not a salt lake person. But having been here has to mean that the food and drinks are amazing here.
It can be spotted from the main road itself, a small cafe.
Has a decent interior and decor.
For drinks we had ordered for Mango Shake and a Lemon Ginger Ale. Both were refreshing and satisfying.
For food we took a Garlic Chicken Sandwich(serves 4 slices with chips) , Barbecue Chicken Pizza ( loaded with crunchy cubes of chicken) and Mongolian grilled Fish (has an overpowering ajwain taste sprinkled over with cheese).
Me being a dessert person, had to order for sweet dishes. I settled for Chocolate Mousse and Hot Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream. Loved both of them.

Had a great time here, good work! 
The service was a tad slow , for the drinks but surely worth the wait.

Tuesday  and scorching heat in the May Afternoon.  What you look for is something chilling atmosphere with lots of amazing drinks and delicious food. And exactly what i got and witnessed here at the very well known Calcutta 64. Was traveling with friends to Salt Lake yet again and i had this place in mind as it was in  my bookmarks for long time. Location is very very easy opposite of the Annex College at Sector one and just a bridge and 5 mins walk away from Lake Town.

It was very hot and we all decided to have some cool and chilled variations so we went for my favorite 

Mango Shake : Thicky affair. Just a perfect thirst buster with the mouth watering taste of mango.

Strawberry Shake : Another well made drink which just rocked the table. The look said it all.

Done with the drinks so arrived the dishes...

Crunchy Chicken : Crunch! Crunch! Crunch! that all i was getting in every bite. Chicken pieces with crunchy chip coating. I wished it never ends...

Chicken Salami Sandwich : Grilled one. Triangular in shape and in between it contained some eye soothing stuffs in forms of Chicken, mayo, cheese, onion etc. Every bite was just so so good.

It was something lovely to have earlier at the table and what can make it even better with Choco Mousse. It was yummy. 

Waited so long for visiting this place and it has paid off finally in a satisfying manner. It was all smiles on my face. It feels good when ur expectations are fulfilled. Cheers.

This place was a major disappointment. The only thing going about this place is its sleek and contemporary interior. Food was a major let-down. We ordered sweet lime soda, hazelnut frappe, coleslaw sandwich, coleslaw burger and masala egg. Only the frappe and the egg were satisfactory. What they passed off as coleslaw was an insult to the actual salad. Service was quite slow. The staff lacked congeniality. This place is economical but quality is largely compromised.

Food :: We ordered 1 BBQ Chicken Burger, 1 Funghy Pasta, 2 Chocolate Mousse and 1 Blue Lagoon. The burger was quite tasty. We didn't quite like the taste of the mushrooms in the pasta. The mousse was delicious! The mocktail was extremely refreshing, too! The cherry on the cake was the cheap prices. Almost all the dishes were below ‚Çπ200 (except the main dishes), which was one of the reasons why this place appealed to a lot of people. 
Ambiance :: It's basically the size of one room. Hence, owing to the current popularity of the restaurant, it becomes very crowded. However, the atmosphere is really warm and nice. Even the paintings on the walls were unique and challenged societal norms. Plus, all the paintings were on sale!
Service :: The service was slightly slow. But, given the fact that only 2 people were managing it, we were okay with it. The staff was courteous and we didn't have any problems, whatsoever. 
I loved this place and will surely recommend it to my acquaintances.

This is a small well decorated caf√© located near CC1.
This place is located near the post office and just opposite annex college.

After having heard a lot about this place,finally decided to give it a visit this week with few friends.
This place happens to be little small and cam accomodate about 12 people max!
Decorated with paintings put up also for sale and plants,the lighting adds up to the charm of the place.

We had ordered:
Beverages:
‚ö™Green apple soda(which tasted a lot like appy fizz but nevertheless was refreshing)
‚ö™Cold coffee with wipped cream
‚ö™Mocha frappe
‚ö™Hazelnut frappe
-The coffee based beverages were really good.

Starters:
‚ö™Chicken quesadilla (MUST TRY)
‚ö™Fish & Chips, the fish was perfectly fried with a crispy layer on top retaining the softness if the fish and the mayo they served with it was also really good.

Main course:
‚ö™Grilled chicken steak(This is the basic chicken steak served with buttery mashed potatoes and poached egg)
‚ö™Mexican grilled chicken(The flavours of this dish was lit AF)
‚ö™Chicken skewers(MUST have)
‚ö™Fish meuniere (once again perfectly cooked fish sauted with butter and parsley with lemon juice,the flavours were damn good and the softness of the fish was retained )
‚ö™BBQ chicken burger

P.S-
1.The main courses were rally really good.
It was really satisfying because the flavours in each and every dish could be seperated. Continental at it's best.One should definitely order any of the steaks when in Calcutta 64.

2. The prices wouldn't dig a hole in the pocket.
Such delicious food at low prices are a rare.
Another reason to visit this place.

3.I wish they expand the place so that big groups can be accomodated also letting many people to visit this place.

A VERY GOOD CULINARY EXPERIENCE :)

It's a very small place.. we had to wait for a while.
We ordered a Mexican Grilled Chicken, Blue Moon, a BBQ Chicken Pizza and Chocolate Mousse.
The main course was pretty good.
The mocktail was as it should be.
But the pizza and the mousse weren't that great..
It's not too hard on the pocket and the prices are inclusive of taxes.

This place had grabbed many footfalls over a short span of time. Successfully found an empty table, otherwise I found this place packed in my last two visits. With minimalistic interior, the eatery is small and feels cramped. The food being the USP, space issues can be forgotten. Service was fine. Food is inexpensive. We tried the following
Mushroom and cheese omelette: seasoned with just salt and pepper, it was light and easy.

Paneer and chilli pizza: crust was crisp, nice and juicy, paneer was amazingly tender. Wasn't spicy, coz I had to season it with chilli flakes and pepper sauce.

Korean stuffed potato: jacket potatoes stuffed with mashed potatoes and a pool of spices. Somewhat had a tangy taste of indian mango pickle. Was average.

Paneer in Moroccan sauce: tendepieces of paneer sauted in a garlicky white sauce that too had a tangy flavour. Was nice and different.

Orange flavoured ice tea: nothing creative to comment

Pinacolada: was amazing with equal flavours of pineapple and coconut.

Altogether, had a satisfying meal.

But I think it's worth the wait coz it serves good food at cheap price :) Best place for college guys who are low on cash :)
My personal favourites :
1- barbeque pizza or salami pizza (small pizza would be enough for 2 people if u are taking any other dish. It's 120 per small pizza) (cheap as fck :v) 
2- grilled chicken steak or fish steak 
3- nachos with chicken (evening snack) 
5- strawberry iced tea if u r thirsty :) milkshakes are also naice :3

We tried the 
Chicken üçó and cheese üßÄ omelette üç≥: 4
Grilled üçó steak: 4.5 [it was served with mashed potato and fried rice. The steak was beautifully covered with perfect spices and the rice was also good. ]
C64 chicken slice : 4.5 [this one is an absolute  show stopper... just love the taste of it.]
Mocha frappe: 4.5  [blown away by the awesome taste of chocolate and coffee ]

Did order their chicken barbeque pizza and was glad that I chose this resturant.With the right amount of cheese and chicken toppings I couldn't have asked for more at this price.A must try cafe.No hidden taxes are an extra benefit.

I have tried their mixed sauce pasta , choco mousse, chicken wraps and fish and chips... Well the place is really nice... Though they have less space but the ambience ,music is fine.  Price and quantity of food is perfect , it is pocket friendly. Pasta and choco mousse was really tasty. But I didn't like the chicken wraps much. Fish and chips was good but could have been better. But then the experience was good and I would like to visit again.

This has become my second home :P I've been here so many times and I aim to visit the place even after trying all the items on their menu. I love the bbq chicken pizza, the funghi pasta, garlic chicken sandwiches, the thai curries, and the list is endless. I love their all day breakfast funda too. The only negative point that compelled me to deduct half a point is the space cram and countless hours of waiting at times because there are just five tables. But I guess it also makes the cafe cozy and comfortable being cute and small. All in all, I love this place and you'll not be disappointed with the food,price and the comfort this place offers.

Definitely a soul comforting place in Salt Lake(Just near the 3no. island)..
A relatively small place but its absolutely cozy..
Menu is a collection of stuffs like soups,wraps,burgers,sandwiches to thai options,seafood & poultry and pizza...I'm glad they serve desserts..Another USP is their selection of beverages...
Service is pretty quick and the food is yummm.
I ordered the Caesar Salad(Veg), smoky chicken wrap, funghi pasta, a Mushroom & corn sandwich, cold coffee and 3 espresso's...
All the foods were served hot and were proper tasty foods,made with utmost love and passion..And quite surprisingly our bill was only Rs.770....

A great place to be visited often(The only problem is the space crunch)..

N.B. - Photos coming up soon

Heard a lot about this place so decided to pay a visit! On walking straight from City Centre for just about 5 minutes you can locate this place easily. Since the cafe is quite small, we had to wait for about half an hour before we could grab a table. The decor is quite pleasing and gives a nice look to the cafe.
Coming to the food, we ordered Chocolate Mousse, C64 Chicken Slice and Mexican Grilled Chicken. The mousse tasted like we were having the chocolate cream out of a big pastry or cake! A total thumbs down!
The mexican grilled chicken was cooked well with the necessary spices and tasted good. But the chicken slice was again not upto the mark. Wish we could have something better!
The hospitality is pretty okayish and they need to buck up if they plan to be here in the business.
The staff here generally consists of boys quite young in age not knowing really how things should go about. Once they become aware I think they will do a really good job! 
Overall full brownie points to the cafe! Would come here again to try some of the other dishes.

P.S Eat as much as you can with no taxes! ;)

We went there in the evening. It is a small cafe which can very few people, hardly 10 people at a time. The ambiance is wonderful especially the touch of framed paintings hanging on the wall and the appropriate lights that went great with it. We ordered Blue moon, Pina colada, BBQ chicken burger and Smokey chicken cheese wrap. The food is no doubt tasty and the service is good. It's a perfect place to sit with your friend and¬†spend some quality time together.

A small cafe near CC1. Small but tasteful. And light on the pocket too. We ordered Fried Onion Chicken Soup, Chicken Bruschetta & Honey Glazed Chicken. Serving proportions are ok. Except for the soup we liked the other too. The soup had a typical smell of some oil. The honey garlic chicken was crispy and the hotness of the pepper was just right. Best of the lot was the Chicken Bruschetta...

A tiny cute outlet very easy to locate in google maps,  about 10 minutes walk from CC1. Nowadays with cafe all around it has a tough competition with respect to service. The staff is not at all prompt. We were served with our order with a considerable waiting time and that too only part of our order was served. We had ordered cucumber lime iced tea,  fish n chips,  crispy chicken,  chocolate mousse. We were served with only fish n chips first we being thirsty (beverage not served on time) asked for a glass of water THRICE  and after 5 minutes of waiting did we get a glass of water.  

Coming to the food.  It savoured my taste buds absolutely so i kind of ignored there service flaws.  The fish was juicy and sumptuous.  The fried chicken came in good big slices and were crunchy. Cucumber lime iced tea was refreshing and classy in taste and as for the mousse it was average.

C64 has lesser competition as there aren't much caf√©s around but as for my experience despite of good food i would think twice before visiting again!!

This was my second visit here, it is located near 3no tank ,salt lake.It is a very small cozy place with seating arrangement for maximum 20-22 people

For two people we ordered

1. Chicken bruschetta - small chunky pieces of chicken tossed with tomato and black olives which is served on  crispy small toasts.It looked stunning but the sour flavour was a bit overpowering which made the dish a poor choice for us.

2. Ice cream with chunky oreo bits - it had vanilla  scoop garnished with half oreo biscuits placed on either side of the scoop and chocolate sauce . The chocolate sauce was too sweet for my palate.

3. Green Apple soda- highly recommended if you happen to visit here
   Strawberry vanilla ice tea- I don't know why I ordered this ,it looked stunning but nothing extra ordinary like I had in my mind when i ordered this drink

 The atmosphere is pretty chilled out ,the price is extremely reasonable and the staff is very courteous.

We had very high expectations with this place before coming as we had seen amazing reviews
-We were served water when we asked for it.
-There were no cold beverages(considering this hot and humid weather) available,only hot beverages.
-We were given dessert spoons when we asked for spoons to have nachos.And once again we had to ask for it,it wasn't provided along with the dish.
-the pizza arrived after 20mins..and we had ordered after reading a lot of reviews...and when it arrived the chilli paneer pizza was just warm which turned cold!! We don't go to restaurant to eat warm food right?? And there wasn't a hint of chilli..In fact the pizza sauce was sweet!! It should be named sweet capsicum paneer cold pizza!!!
Will Never go again and not will recommend anyone

Visited this place twice.
It's a very small place.
Located near city centre 1.
I heard a lot about their pizzas but somehow it was a let down. Their crust is very crunchy. There was no cheese inside the pizza just on top it an thick crunch layer of cheese like the topping and the cheese didn't blend. 
So I won't recommend pizza but the burger was good. 
It was at least better than the pizza.

After a bit of argument we decided to try out Calcutta 64.
The ambiance was great and the d√©cor too.
We asked for chicken salami pizza, Mixed fruit juice and Choco Mousse.
Thought they took a while to make the pizza, all the items tasted delightful.
Lastly all this came at a great affordable price.
All I can say is that you must visit this place at least once, you wont be disappointed.

On successive visit we tried different items and they were tasty as well.
Only issue is that they run out of some common things like mousse, momo,juice,etc.

Love this place. 

I love a place which serves good coffee and it does and it also smells of coffee :) 

The place is close to city centre and tad bit too small.. 15 seats only. So you gotta come in early. 

Ambience is relaxed, waiters are nice, decoration is simplistic.

The cold coffee with ice cream and plain cold coffee both taste amazing. 
The pizza was tasty, with lots of toppings and cheese. Such a hearty thin crust pizza. I wish the base was a little different though. 
Mexican grilled chicken rice was tasty too. Chicken cooked to perfection in a great sauce. The rice by it's self was flavoursome. 

Will come back for more. 

Definitely recommend. :)

How can you run a mixer at your front desk??

First things first, food was average. Ordered Funghi Pasta 3/5 and Quesedillas which were 2/5 as it's was partially cooked.

But but but the best thing, cafe is already too small, so you already can hear everybody talking. Still you put in a 750w mixer at the front desk and run it for cold coffees. The noise of the mixer is unbearable and basically you ruin the feel of a cafe and make it a roadside vendor.

If you wanna save yourself and ask them to serve outside, they don't do it as they are basically waiting area. I don't think I will go again unless and until someone doesn't tell me where we are going and we land up here again. Calcutta 64 for me is Mixer 24/7

1 mark only for polite staff.

Thank you zomato reviewers, the true foodies who never disappoint me whenever I look for a new place. So with little help of Google maps I reached to this place. 
Ambience:
A small place with seating arrangements for around 15, 16people. But you will find a place soon as many people don't know about this cool cafe. Though its small but feels cozy and comfortable with excellent music at the background.
Service:
Very good and courteous. Though I was a bit unlucky because I could not get mocktail as they had some issues with their mixer. 
Food: 
Various options are there considering a cafe. We ordered french onion soup(chicken),chicken momo and bbq fish. The taste was too good and quantity was also adequate. The clear soup with the momo was awesome :) 
Overall one of the best cafe around. I would also say its very much pocket friendly considering the quality of food they are serving. A great place,complete value for money, highly recommended for foodies!

Green apple soda : it's okish refreshing but nothing spcl.
Korean stuffed potato : Try 1st tym , nice in taste

We visited this cafe and was shocked at how small it is. The staff are not at all welcoming because we sat waiting for someone to take our order. And they seem to favor people who visit often or something because this lady was so rude and kept wanting me to shift obviously because of how small the place is. And the staff instead of telling the lady to be polite and adjusting, he rather asked me (not at all nicely)to shift not only my chair but the table as well. The food is not great but the quantity is quite big. The prices are also average. The chicken steak that my boyfriend ate said it was nice, so I guess that was the only nice thing. And We had the garlic cheese bread that was also average and really like chips than toast. I wouldn't lie that I am going to revisit, because quite frankly I won't.

‚Ä¢ Green Apple Soda - Loved the flavour and really enjoyed the drink.

‚Ä¢ Lemon Ginger Soda - Wow! This was simply amazing and refreshing.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Salami Sandwich - Outstanding and awesome, totally worth it.

‚Ä¢ Garlic Chicken Sandwich - This was different but simply brilliant.

‚Ä¢ Barbeque Pizza - One of the best pizzas I ever had. Damn! Made me crave for more and more.

‚Ä¢ Crunchy Chicken - Yummy and hot, my lips were seduced had to try it and totally fell for it. Gonna go for it again for sure.

‚Ä¢ Mixed Grilled Fish - The fish was fresh and awesome tastewise.

‚Ä¢ Mousse - Best way to end a meal.

‚Ä¢ Brownie - Loved the design and the way it was presented. 

Overall a wonderful experience.

This is a good joint if youre in the mood for a quick bite or brunch or just coffee with friends. Its a small cosy joiny located in a quiet clean area and has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Although the joint is almost tiny, the decor is good and the place is spic and span. The service is prompt and staff polite. 

Food:
I tried the pasta in red sauce which i personally thought had too much sauce which was overpowering.

Must try the chicken nachos though!! Although the quantity was small, it tasted reeally good! 

Definitely going back!

A very small and cosy cafe situated near city centre mall. I liked the interior, simple and smart. I always use to pass by this cafe so one fine evening thought of dropping in with my cousins. Coming to the food we ordered cappuccino, mango shake, coldcoffe, white pasta with mushrooms, chicken grilled burgers, California orange salsa prawns (their signature dish), panner pizza , barbq chicken pizza and a chocolate mouse. I liked the mango shake, it was bery refreshing and perfect for this summer. The salsa prawn did not hit my taste bud at all, though its their signature dish. It was very sweet and was served with plain rice. I loved the mouse as well. Pizza was just not up to the mark. I also parcelled Mexican grilled chicken for my parents and that tasted good. Overall food was okish but people can drop in for small meetups and gatherings.

Lovely place with beautiful interiors. Just a drawback is that the place is way too small, but nevertheless, the food is worth for the money paid. Ordered Grilled chicken burger and BBQ chicken. Both of them were stuffed in with chicken n cheese and served with mayo n chips. Then had Penne Alla Pasta which was served with garlic bread. Way too tasty and saucy. Then for dessert had Chocolate mousse which happened to be my favourite as it had liquid chocolate at the bottom of the glass n shredded chocolate on top. Very happy with my visit n would definitely visit again. Kudos to C64 team!

Planning to been here after heard that their pastas were amazingly delicious. So few days back been here with some of foodies friends to their dishes, drinks and caf√© drinks.

Situated in 1st Avenue BC block of Sector 1, Saltlake just 5 minutes walking from City centre 1 near Post Office.

"Big surprise in small package" - This quote suits Calcutta 64. A small sized caf√© with sitting capacity of around 20 serves delicious Continental dishes and caf√© drinks.

D√©cor - d√©cor was classy like European caf√©s. Minimalistic design in white and creamy with artistic paintings on walls. Coffee colored tables and chairs. Outdoor space for waiting. 

Ambience - Ambience was just amazing and so as hospitality. Friendly and helpful staff. Service in reasonable time and presentation was ravishing.

We tasted some amazing dishes and mouth watering drinks reviewed below -

* Mochaccino - A caff√® mocha, also called mocaccino, is a chocolate-flavored variant of a caff√® latte. They made it perfectly and presented beautifully. Very delicious a must try.

* Mocha Frappe - Made with rich chocolate flavor and a hint of coffee, Mocha Frappe is blended with ice and covered with very thin whipped topping and chocolately drizzle. Tastes heavenly delicious totally loved it.

* Green Apple Soda - One of the most fizzy drink I've tasted so far. Refreshing and flavorful, tastes like appy fizz. A must have drink with your meal.

* Mango Shake - full of flavor thick shake which tastes amazingly delicious. A shows topper drink which loved by all. Refreshing, flavorful and very tasty.

* Korean Stuffed Potatoes - Grilled Jacket Potatoes stuffed with mashed potatoes mixed in Indian spices. Spicy and very delicious in taste. Loved it.

* Babycorn and Mushrooms in Cajun Sauce - Babycorn and boiled mushrooms tossed in Cajun Sauce which was a mix of salt, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, onion powder, cayenne pepper, oregano, thyme, and red pepper flakes. A cheesy and creamy sauce tastes amazingly delicious with babycorn and Mushrooms. A must try.

* Pasta in Pesto Sauce - Penne Pasta cooked in Pesto Sauce made from basil, pine nuts, Parmigiano Reggiano, olive oil, and garlic and topped with parmesan. Very delicious, Herby and mouth watering pasta. My personal favorite highly recommended to all.

* Lebanese Paneer Steak - Thick Lebanese Paste made with garlic, salt, lemon juice, vegetable oil and olive oil filled in between two grilled and marinated paneer tofu covered with Lebanese style sauce made with garlic, lemon juice, Ginger, tomato paste, some spices etc. Amazingly delicious and very tasty dish. A must have and served with choice of rice.

* Veg Thai Curry Red - Whenever I had a veg thai Curry it was almost every time in green and sometimes in yellow. First time I had a Red Thai Curry Veg. Experience was really good. It was very spicy, little tangy and very little creamy. With lot's of veggies in it's it tastes really good. Served with choice of rice a must try.

* Swiss Pie - A Traditional Swiss Pie with Chef Special touch. Made just a way Swiss Pie was made. Layers of sweet dough slices filled with apple pulp, peach pulp, seera and some honey. A delicious and must have dessert.

* Scoop of Ice Cream with Oreo Bite - A Simple Looking dessert made with vanilla scoop with poured Hersey syrup and topped with Half cracked Oreo Biscuit.

An amazing experience here. A must try place. Personal favorite. Highly recommended to all.

Along the vast lanes and by-lanes of the Salt Lake area, an inexpensive yet high-on-quality caf√© is hard to find. That too a place which serves extended varieties of continental dishes is a rarity in this city. The menu doesn‚Äôt just stop there and goes on to cover the other main global cuisines like American and Asian.
To cater to all this empty space come Calcutta 64, a caf√© that lately has been a boon to the teenage crowd of the Salt Lake vicinity.

It is situated on Second Cross Road, and takes a 10-minute walk from City Centre-1 to reach it. The fa√ßade has been neatly designed with large glass panes and a sleek logo. There is some bamboo furniture placed just outside, by the footpath. The place is small, with a seating capacity of about 15 souls. The d√©cor is minimalistic with simple artistic props and paintings. Quite a lot of them are also for sale.

Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Calcutta 64, takes up very little space and has a very limited seating option. In spite of that the lights, the colours, the props together make this caf√© kinda adorable.
The tables were so small that at times it becomes difficult to manage all the plates and glasses on it. It's manageable though.
We ordered hazelnut frappes, chicken Caesar salad, fish fingers, pasta in pesto sauce and grilled chicken steak. I think it's pretty clear that we ordered a bit too much for two people. We finished everything.
The hazelnut frappe and the Caesar salad were great. The fish fingers were okay. The steak came with eggs, mashed potatoes and rice. That's dinner right there. The steak itself was hard though, that needs to be improved.
The pasta, unfortunately, wasn't a hit. The colder it got (and it got pretty cold because we had ordered a lot of things), the more difficult it was to eat.
Basically the drinks and starters here are great. Main courses, not so much. Calcutta 64 is a pretty good place for a snack, that's for sure.

Well needless to say about the location, as one can easily find this cozy cafe.

Best for "Gup shup with friends","Budget Dates","Enjoying your own company with a cup of coffee" and many other ways.

Now coming to the food, We ( me and my best friend ) have been here twice and have tried couple of things like Fungi Pasta with extra cheese, Chilli and Paneer Pizza, Grilled Chicken Pizza, Hazelnut Frappe and one of the items from the snacks section in the menu (not able to remember the name). The food is very likeable by a person who enjoys soulful food. Its like we tried their fungi pasta once on a Sunday evening and loved it so much that we again went to the cafe on next Sunday.

The price for the stomach full and tasty evening or morning snacks will be light weight on your pocket ( this i can bet ).  The cafe DOESN'T charge you any SERVICE TAX ( yes you read it right ), at least not now ( don't know about the future).

So overall, its a must visit if you are looking for your own place to be with friends, family or your own self.

This is a cosy little place in Sector 1, Salt Lake, within a walking distance from City Centre 1. There's indoor seating for 12 and outdoor seating‚Äã for about 4-6. Four of us friends got together to celebrate a birthday. The ambience is what first caught my eye. It's small, but looks very comfortable.

We sat down and got the menu cards and what caught my eye was the low prices. Isan Basu already had high words for the food. So we ordered a Jalapeno Cheese Balls platter, a Bbq Chicken pizza, and a Pasta in Pesto Sauce, to go with a Strawberry shake, a Lemon Iced tea, a Darjeeling first flush and a Masala Tea. The order took a while to arrive, but it was oh so lovely! The taste of the Pasta, the sauce, it was exquisite. After this intro, we ordered a California Orange Salsa Prawns (picture). This was mind blowing to say the least. The portion was sufficient for one person. For desserts, we got a mousse. After all these, the total bill came to around ‚Çπ1500.

All the items were superb. This place is highly recommended for a small group or a good food date.

Location : Take the road right next to Bhikaram(adjacent to Citi Centre 1), head straight, cross the island. Keep ehading straight and you'll find this cafe on your left.

Decor/ambience : decor is minimalistic and the space is a little less, but the ambience is cosy and warm.

Food/beverages :

I've been to this place soo many times that I've almost tasted most of the menu. Fee of my favourites include :

Beverages :

*Mocha frappe
*Mango shake : this is a must try.
*Cappuccino

Starters:

* BBQ chicken
*Fish and chips: this is a must try.

Mains:

*Grilled chicken steak
*Californian orange salsa prawns
*Pesto pasta : just ask them to make this a bit strong otherwise it tastes bland.

Desserts:

*Swiss pie
*scoop of ice cream with Oreo bite

Service : service is excellent. Staff is very courteous and attentive.

This place definitely bags a reccomendation from the_bigfatfoodie. And prices are insanely cheap!

After seeing good reviews in zomato, I've finally decided to check out this cafe.. This cafe was in my wishlist for a long couple of months..

Now as soon as I entered the cafe there was no sufficient place for me to sit , then I've placed my order of CHOCOLATE SHAKE and Cheese and BBQ CHICKEN BURGER..

Now after placing the order I've to wait for another 20 mins.. Finally they have arranged the seat for me..

Now come to the food the Cheese and BBQ CHICKEN BURGER just average according to me, I've a big fan of Mc Donalds and by comparing this burger to Mc Donalds , I'm sorry to say that Calcutta 64 has disappointed me.. Chocolate Shake was the only one item which I like..

The interiors of this cafe is good and lively, they have many wall paintings and they have also arranged a TV where you can enjoy any music video or any live match.. The cafe is very small with a less seating capacity.. So you might have to wait outside for around 15 to 20 mins and after placing your order you might have to wait for another 15 to 20 mins.. I was the lucky one that I've to wait inside.. Rest of them were waiting outside while I was having my meal..

So, I just want to end my review by saying that this place has disappointed me, My expectation was very high but the service, food quality has disappointed me..

The only advantage of this cafe was according to me on the basis of my order was CHOCOLATE SHAKE and moreover, you dont have to pay any VAT and service tax..

Located straight from Balle Balle Dhaba, this place is 5-7 mins walking from there. This place is a small hidden gem for inexpensive continental food. This place is small and very decored. For college students like me, this place is a must visit! 
Now coming to the food : 
*Prawn shashlik - These prawn skewers are tasty,spicy and juicy. 

*Fish&Chips : They serve two big pieces of well fried fish with crispy fries and tartare sauce. 

*Mexican Grilled Fish : This was a main course fish serves with steamed rice. 

* Green Apple Soda and Mocha Frappe were my favourite beverages. 

*Swiss Pie : This dessert is highly recommended and one of the chef's specialities. The pie has a carrot and apple layer. 

* Chicken slice is a speciality of the Chef and is a must have !

Close to City Centre 1 and very easy to locate, this place is about 5 minutes walk from Island no. 3 in Sector 1, Salt Lake.
Calcutta 64 is a newly opened restaurant that I wanted to try from quite sometime now. Finally visited.
A small cafe with a seating arrangement for not more than 15 people. Cool interior with framed paintings hung on the wall for sale. Glass pane facing the road - an impressive trick used to make the place feel less congested.
Staffs were efficient and very responsive.

What we ordered :

For drinks there were Mocha Frappe, Green Apple Soda and Mango Shake.
Mocha Frappe is my personal pick. Perfectly balanced flavour and sweetness.

Starters had C64 Chicken Slices, BBQ Chicken, Fish & Chips and Prawn Shashlik.
Loved the Prawn Shashlik. Served with pineapple, bell peppers, onion and one prawn in each skewer. Amazing!

For main course we had Grilled Chicken Steak, California Orange Salsa Prawns and Mexican Grilled Fish. All of them were served with Steamed Rice.
Again, the prawn turned out to be my favourite pick. I equally liked the steak. Both were different so it's hard to compare.

Dessert had Swiss Pie and Scoop of Ice Cream with Oreo Bite.
The Swiss Pie was lovely! It was a very different kind of a pie, I tasted. Very indian. Chef's personal recipe, guessing. There was the aroma of the ghee and gajar ka halwa as the filling, amazing!
The presentation of the Oreo Bite was cute.
Nothing extraordinary‚Äã about the taste, though - plain vanilla ice cream served with chocolate sauce and an oreo cookie but still a great thing to end your meal with. 

Overall, great experience. Definitely going back!

If you are looking for some snacks and light meals and also up for something new, then this cafe is your desired destination. It's a small and cozy place with sitting area provided inside as well as outside the cafe. The walls are decorated with paintings among which some are for sale. The ambience and location of the cafe is really good.
Coming to the main part, the food, ofcourse is delicious and can get you addicted to it. I visited this place for the first time with my friends and we ordered Mocha Frappe and Green Apple Soda. The Mocha Frappe had a perfect blend of coffee and cream, Green Apple Soda was something I have never had before so we tried experimenting which turned out to be successful. We order a few starters- C64 Chicken slices, BBQ Chicken, Prawn Shashlik. C64 dish is so delicious and the presentation of the same is commendable. BBQ had perfectly barbequed chicken pieces, the Prawn dish had prawns, crisp from outside and soft and juicy from inside. Talking about the main course we ordered Mexican Grilled Fish, California Orange Salsa Prawns, Grilled Chicken Steak. The steak is the age old all time favourite dish but the catch is that the chicken is grilled here. Grilled fish has that Mexican touch with a blend of all the ingredients which make a perfect mixture when it enters your mouth. Salsa Prawns are small prawn pieces dipped in salsa sauce and both the steak and prawns are served with butter rice. Bengalis can't do without something sweet and Swiss Pie and Scoop of Ice cream with Oreo Bite seemed too but appealing to me. The Oreo Bite is vanilla ice cream served with Oreo Biscuits and chocolate sauce- nothing new about it but Oreo drives me crazy. The Swiss Pie is baked so well and the inner layers are thick and you can't help but fall for it.
This cafe with it's soothing ambience and very appealing food and beverage inclusions gets-
Ambience- 5
@Staff service-5
Presentation of dishes and beverages-5
Taste-5
Talking about the most important thing, the prices are pretty reasonable and you can drop in anytime you want with your friends or family without worrying about pocket pinch. I would personally recommend everyone to visit this cafe soon enough.

Well, eating out these days is quite expensive, and when it comes to good continental stuff then its hard to find a place which is really good with reasonable pricetag.
If you think why am I saying these things, this place is your answer to all the things said above.
Calcutta 64 is one of those places which wooes you with its delicious food.
Situated in the lanes of Sector 1, just a couple of minutes walk from City Center, this is a gem of a place.
Not much of decor and not a huge space to dine out but those things wont bother you as you get the food on your table.
Went to this place with my friends today afternoon and was completely satisfied with the quantity, quality and the service.
Started with Fish and Chips which was really good. The quality of the fish was something which was commendable.
Next comes the Chicken Steak which was another item which was well presented and really good in taste. The tender chicken, and the flavoured rice was good enough to tickle my taste buds.
In the beverage section, I tried their Mango Shake which was again a definite thing to try on.
The last thing which completed the meal was Scoop of Icecream with Oreo Bite. Good Presentation, nothing great to brag about.

Last Words:
If you have a tight budget and want to eat some delicious food. Don't look for any other place for confusion.

Food - 

Beverage - 
Mocha Frappe : 
Lovely taste and a delight to eyes. Very flavoursome.

Starters-

Fish and chips : 
Wow. This was something beyond expectation. The fish was very tender and tasted wonderful. Served with mayonese and French Fries. Very fitting too. 

C64 Chicken Slices : The delicious Slice. Shredded Piece of chicken makes this dish completely and delicious. 

Main Course - 

California Orange Salsa Prawn : 
Excellent. 
If you are a prawn lover, you dont wanna miss on this. Very tastefull and served well with rice. The combination is equally fitting. The tangy flavour wasa delicious surprise. 

Grilled Chicken Steak - Tender and Perfect. Just the way it should be. Served with Rice.

Walking down the empty lanes near island no 3 in Salt Lake to find this little cafe, so well maintained that it wins you over.
Going by look, there's place for near about 5-6 tables with lamps hanging over, glass panes onlooking the main road, coffee mugs and books on the shelf, a TV and also an outside seating area.
The food is delicious here. We started with Green Apple soda, Mocha Frappe and Mango shake. Each of them were amazing!
Chicken 64 slices is totally recommended. It's one of their signature dishes too. BBQ Chicken and even the Prawn Shashlik were clear winners. Personal favourite was the Fish & Chips with mayo dip.
The California Orange Salsa Prawns, Grilled Chicken Steak, Mexican Grilled Fish for mains and they were spot on. Couldn't get over the fish yet.
We also had Swiss Pie for desserts. This one's basically the star dish. Its amazing!
The prices are extremely pocket friendly.
The service here is quick, very friendly staff and extremely cooperative. We had a great time and hope everyone else does.

Went on my friend's birthday and to my notice the place was full which initially confirmed that it would be a great place to binge on. After few minutes, literally grabbed a table. They patiently waited for us to cut the cake and place our order of Fish Finger, Grilled Chicken Steak and Funghi Pasta. It was served after around 30mins which is not at all impressive for a newbie in Salt Lake. The Fish Fingers were juicy and soft but the Chicken Steak was pretty disappointing. Steaks are generally not that tight and tough to cut up into pieces. The Funghi Pasta was also not that remarkable because they charged us extra for adding chicken pieces and provided us just 4 to 5 pieces of shredded chicken. All in all, a very homely place to spend time with your friends, a tiny cafe sort of with good music to chit chat and no "Hurry Up" vibes from anyone. Thanks 'Calcutta 64' for such a comfortable experience.

Cozy but the food makes it worth all. Tastes great whether it's drink or food. Pocket friendly. We ordered Barbeque fish platter, Mexican chicken platter, chocolate mousse and Mocha mystery. Thumbs up for Mexican spices and presentation of mousse. Willing to try more dishes ahead!

Had a second visit to this place to try out their more dishes. And it was awesome. We had scrambled paneer wrap, mix sauce pasta, coffee frappe and hazelnut coffee. All were delight to taste. Food quality and taste is so good compared to high end restuarants. And this cafe also excels in coffee. Hence revisiting justifies for trying out their more dishes !

This review is about 3 weeks old. But I am sure its applicability is still as fresh.

To me, one of the primary reasons to try out a new place is its looks. In that sense Calcutta 64 scores brownie points here since they have a very cozy and rather inviting setup. It is not difficult to get a sense of the cuisine that this restaurant offers simply by looking at it from outside. I had first visited this place about a month after it first opened, and since then the owners have made few changes to suit their offerings to their patrons' taste buds. 

Ambience - This place gives out a very decent looking mid scale cafe feel. And that is exactly what it is. The seating is nice, and the interiors is tastefully done with some thought provoking( :-P ) art hanging on the wall. I feel the sitting area could have been a little larger with the counter pushed backwards towards the kitchen, but it is how it is. They also have seating on the pavement outside the enclosure now. 

Food - They serve a pretty good variety of pastas, pizzas, burgers, salads and some Thai dishes. I am yet to try the Thai ones, but am in love with the sandwiches. Try the Garlic chicken sandwich and the Bbq chicken burger if you are a non-vegetarian and the coleslaw sandwich. Somehow the bread they make is just the right amount crunchy on the outside and mellow on the inside. The pizza looked great but did not get my taste buds excited. Also the base was too crisp to be enjoyed as a pizza. The burgers are great with shredded chicken and not a patty unlike traditional burgers. I also have tried the Caesar salad but was not a big fan. Nachos too could be better.¬† I expect my nachos to have mayonnaise in it, since it adds softness and juiciness to the rather crunchy, dry and hard chips. The mozzarella just did not do the trick. And the toppings too were very dry rendering the dish not so enjoyable to me. But hey, that's my opinion! Try the hot beverages as much as you want, but the cold ones if you a big fan of sugar. 

Service - Staff is good and courteous and experience but tediously slow. In a four table cafe, we waited for our order for nearly 30mins on 2 separate occasions. But then it gave us enough time to just chit chat and not worry about the world, so this is not really a complaint. 

In all, I would visit this place over and over again because it is very relaxing and does not pinch my pocket too much at all. And their sandwiches are so good!

Tiny cafe,  seats about 15 people.  Very easy to locate. Outside  seating available. Pleasant  decor in whites and browns.  Pocket friendly.  We had ordered 1.  an Americano coffee,  
2. a cold cofee with icecream, 
3. a Caesar Salad since it was recommended in the reviews, 
4. a garlic chicken grilled sandwich platter,  
5. A bbq chicken pizza 
6. A chocolate mousse . 
Two of us had all of these and the bill came to Rs 580.
The coffees were okay. We really liked the salad.  Everyone  was having  the sandwiches  so they must be a real hit. They were generously stuffed  with chicken and served with chips. I loved the sandwich. The pizza was great too.  As was the chocolate  mousse. We sat talking for hours and the waiters didn't  ask us to hurry even though  the place was quite busy and we were really  slow with the orders.

This place has become popular  within weeks of opening.  I wasn't  surprised.  Looking  forward  to eat here again.

This joint is compact yet spacious enough to sit comfortably and enjoy your meal. There's indoor as well as outdoor sitting options.

Coming to  food, they surely serve meals which are value for money. I ordered Grilled Chicken Pizza, Chicken Caesarian Salad & Chocolate Walnut Brownie. The salad and brownie was awesome but i personally didn't like the pizza because it was of thin crust and the pizza sauce was sweet.

The staffs are very well behaved and i didn't face any delayed servings which was mentioned in some review. Do give it a try

We ordered chicken thai curry (red) , crispy sweet baby corn and chocolate mousse. They took 40-45 minutes to serve our order. The main courses are not spicy at all. The chocolate mousse was perfect. Reasonable price. it's a great place to hang out with your friends.

First things first, easy to locate! Walking distance from City Centre, Salt Lake. 

The place is extremely small and seems to have gained popularity in a very short time and is quite crowded. We had to wait for more than 30 mins to get a table. 

The food is great. We ordered frappes, which were made to suit our personal tastes. I asked for strong frappes and my wish was complied with. :) The Mexican Grilled chicken was yum! Should definitely be tried. The BBQ chicken pizza was a treat for the price! However, I felt that the sauce was okayish. 

The place is very easy on the pocket considering the quality of the food they offer. 

One thing they really really need to look into is their service. Extremely poor service. The waiters didn't ask for or give us water until we asked. No tissues were given until we specifically asked for them. We repeatedly had to call waiters to draw their attention towards us. I believe this is so because it is a new place. However, they need to notch up the service soon!

A very small cafe situated near city centre 1,this place has many options in its menu..we had a chicken pizza which was pretty good and hazelnut frappe which was awesome..the service was decent..definitely a hidden gem,the only con is the very small seating area,hardly 3-4 tables...

The highlights
1. Pocket friendly- no extra taxes
2. The pizzas are a must have- but be sure you order either mediums or larger as they are way better in taste, crisper and better baked than the smaller ones. 

The improvements need to be made on
1. Lousy laid back service
2. Expect atleast 30 mins to receive your dish
3. There are only four tables so not much of a space
4. Other than pizzas nothing else is that great or a treat to the taste buds

We decided about this place just because a friend had recommended us to try out and we were not be disappointed, the decor was nice and had a good retro feel about it. The food was good too although the time taken for processing the order was way too high. Nevertheless, the food was good as we had ordered a pasta with pesto sauce, chicken BBQ and a BBQ chicken pizza with Pepsi and Fresh lime soda. 
The place is also pocket friendly with no additional taxes. The waiters were nice and very cooperative. The spacing was a bit on the lesser side as they could accommodate only 4 tables.
Excellent place if your nearby salt lake.

Nice place to hangout with friends.Beautiful ambience..Loved every dish we tried,specially the Chocolate Mousee.The mocktail tasted similar to the roadside thellawalla's nimbu pani,so that was a bit disapppointing.Another thing,hospitality was not upto the mark,they were late in serving the dishes,and we kept on reminding them about our orders.Overall a very good experience,would like to visit it again.

Now it's added to my favorite cafe list. A small place but can amaze you with their food quality and flavors. Well decorated,beautiful ambience. Cozy place to spend hours with friends. Every single food we had was more or less amazing. Specially the poultry platters, shakes and dessert were lip smacking good. Price is pocket friendly. One thing that disappointed me was their delivery timing. It was way much late. It will be fine if the staffs become a bit more active.

Had been here recently for lunch,this place is located near city centre 1 and it's a really tiny joint with 3-4 tables,coming to the food we ordered the chicken skewers,grilled chicken steak,thai curry and the mexican chicken along with chicken wraps which tasted awesome, the food overall was good and all the four dishes were served with a good quantity of rice and all the dishes had their distinct flavours,along with the meal we ordered a few soft drinks.The place is really reasonable price wise however the only hinderance I found was that they do not have any power backup,there was a load shedding and they did not have any generator or inverter facility,it might be a real problem in the summers if they do not take care of it.Overall a good experience.

'Calcutta 64' is a cafe located in Sector 1,Salt Lake just opposite to Annex College. A small walk of five minutes from City Centre 1 will be enough to reach this place. 

We went here today for our Valentine's day celebration. We reached the cafe at 12.30 p.m. But there was load shedding. So, all of the items were not available. 

We went for 'Mexican Grilled Chicken' and 'Chicken Caesar Salad'. The food took nearly fifteen minutes to arrive. But the wait was worth it. The Mexican grilled chicken was delicious. It was perfectly grilled with different spices and had grated cheese on top. This dish was delicious to say the least. 

The Chicken Caesar Salad was another masterpiece. It was filled with chicken, lettuce, croutons, olives, garlic and had the right amount of mayonnaise. I personally loved the salad more than the grilled chicken. I can come here every day only for the salad. 
We wanted to go for Pizza. Sadly, the power was not back. So, we could not have it. The staff was polite and very well-behaved. I will visit this cafe again.

The best thing, prices are tax included and so you don't have to worry about.. "itna bill kaise"
Ordered the bbq burger(heard its great)
And i wasn't too disappointed but it seemed small
Anyway, the taste was really good
And the ambience feels like a cafe shop, and it was nice, have been to too many dim lighted cafes, liked a fully lit cafe for once.

Went again on 20-07-17
Ate chicken salami and chocolate mousse

Just one word for this joint - pathetic. The person who served us named Krishnendu was rude and lacked courtesy. We went yesterday evening and ordered food & coffee. We asked this person to give coffee first and then food. He came back and served food first. We told why didn't he serve coffee first as requested, at which he told he has to serve other customers. Strange and dismal, did we say him to serve us leaving other customers. We just asked him to serve coffee to us before food. The food was way too bad, Nachos were soggy, pizza tasting sweet, pasta semi cooked, walnut brownie hardly had and trace or taste of walnut. Only coffee was ok. Further for 4 people seated another person, who we came to know was the Manager there, serve two glasses water not before we asked for it several times. Its a small space with hardly many seats. Ambiance is so so. Head on to another cafe nearby, avoiding this.

This is a small cafe, only 5minutes from city center, 
Not really hard to find. 
The ambience is good, the amazing aroma of coffee, when you enter the cafe, just settle you mind to have a cup of coffee.
Their specialty is the main course, 
But for starters you could have chicken nacho, 
And pizza, it was thin crust and it was good, good enough to make you not go to Dominos for a while. 
Chicken grilled steak was minty, which was pretty nice, bbq chicken burger was flattering, 
We also had sandwich, which was beautifully prepared. 
Friends if you are looking for a nice, inexpensive place. Have a go

Though the steak was well done, they could've provided a side of roasted vegetables instead of just rice. Service could've been tad better. Reasonable prices.

Me and my two friends went here today. It's a very small cafe. Service was okay, they took a little time to deliver the food. 

We orderd one Mexican Grilled Chicken, one Grilled Chicken Steak, one BBQ Chicken Burger and two Cold Coffees with Ice Cream. 

I liked the burger. But the other two dishes were just okay. Cold Coffee was good. 

Overall it's a average experience. One huge advantage is this restaurant is too much pocket friendly.

Nice decor. Nice music.
Food  looked good but taste was not nice on my Bengali tongue.
Everything was sans salt.
The bread of the BBQ chicken burger was crunchy! The onions inside it were burnt.
Crust of the grilled chicken pizza was very crunchy. Almost crackers. Toppings were tasteless.
Chico shake was good and smooth and yum.
Green apple soda was good.
Choco mousse was too salty and disappointing. 
Very pocket friendly. Don't go if you are in search of good food. Other wise go have nachos hang out come back

It's a small cafe which can accommodate around not more than 14 people inside.. üòÑ Outside also they have some space for few people! It was totally empty when we arrived today morning.. üò¥ We placed an order of barbeque pizza (medium size), cold coffee with ice cream and pan fried chicken momo.. After 15 mins or so they served our coffee.. It was sweet and quite good in taste! üòç The pizza was thin crust and sufficient for 2 ppl easily..üòÉ It was cheesy and yummy..with ample amount of chicken..üòãüòã But they messed up the momos! üò©üò© Some momos were literally burnt.  It contained no salt, no spices.. basically it was flavourless! üòî We conveyed our dissatisfaction to the attendants.. They listened to us and asked whether we would like to replace the momos. But as we were running out of time, we denied!  It was a really pleasant gesture from their side, that they didn't include the momos in our bill. üòá Would come here sometime again to try more of their delicacies! ‚úå

Fantastic place in heart of sector 1. The place is little and can seat only like 10 odd people. The ambience is simple and pleasing, service by staff was good and quick. 
Ambience and service 4/5

Coming to food

Mexican chicken - simply amazing, I would say one of the best tasting dish in salt lake 5/5
Chicken momos - was served with soup and momos were kind of okay okay but the soup was minty and tasty 3.5/5
BBQ chicken pizza - it's a thin crust pizza and packs a crunch but felt like missing something 3/5
Cappuccino - simple but not that hot 3.5/5

Overall a good experience. Would love to visit again and tryout other main course dishes.

Most of all they don't charge any taxes. The food is just awesome...The menu is wisely drafted. But one thing I was dissapointed about is hazzlenut frappe- it was like any other cold coffee . Mexican grilled chicken is good but little bit spicy... The staffs are slow , but well behaved. Hope to visit soon for better experience.

My friend and I had made our mind to eat elsewhere, and while walking down the street when we stumbled upon Calcutta 64. It seemed to a nice and cozy place. A quick zomato check and we were eager to try. The place is quite small, so you cannot really accomadate a large group of friends. The place was full even on an Monday evening. The ambience is simple. Lightings are bright, a hard to find these days. The wall painting here are for sale and for art enthusiasts, well you may end up buying one with your meal. The staff is not very responsive and self initiated, though they provided for, whenever we asked them to. Coming to the menu, they have a diverse one and covers quite a lot of stuff that you expect when you go to a cafe such as this. Wraps, burgers, pizza, pasta, momos and much more. We ordered a Penne Pasta in Pesto Sause, Veg Fungi Pizza and Veg Quaisidillas. For drinks, she had a classic Lemon Soda and I had a Iced Lemon Tea. Everything was upto the mark and no where did we feel disappointed.  It is budget friendly, so you really don't shy away from ordering more if you want to try something new. 

Penne Pasta in Pesto Sause: Over years I have seen Pesto Sause gone horribly wrong. But this one was near perfection. It had just the right amount of bitterness, a very creamy and consistent texture and the flavor of garlic was brought out perfectly without overpowering the classic Pesto. The dish was served with garlic bread. Though strong on flavors, the garlic bread looked very plain and non-appealing. 

Veg Fungi Pizza: A thin crust pizza overloaded with veggies, cheese and mushrooms, this pizza had my mouth rolling with flavors. Though the sides were a little burnt and the salt was not properly dispersed, overall it turned out to be a great dish. 

The Star Dish: Veg Quaisidillas: I am a huge fan of this dish and oh how beautifully had they made it. I wasn't a very fancy one, but it had simple elements put together very well. Light on stomach and healthy, this dish deserves a try for people who love simple food. 

Lemon Soda(Sweet): It was an average drink. The sweetness was on the lower side, but it was refreshing. 

Lemon Iced Tea: Not the best, but one of the very good ones. It had a pleasant flavor neither too sweet, nor too strong. Very refreshing and a nice drink to order with the order above. Kind of balances it all in between. 


Overall, a decent place to go if you are in the area. You may divulge into their desert section too, if you aren't as full as we were.

This cafe has recently gained quite popularity and it's kind of worth it.
Visited this place yesterday with my friend. We ordered
PASTA IN PESTO SAUCE - very creamy pasta tossed in green basil sauce served with two breads. It was good though we had to put a lot of oregano and chilli flakes to make it more appreciable to our taste buds.
HAZZLENUT FRAPPE- it was like any other cold coffee without any creamy whipped topping or extra chocolate sauce.
EGG MAYO SANDWICH- it had two pairs of sandwiches served with potato wafers. Tasted a bit dry because of the insufficient amount of mayonnaise. It had only one dip (ketchup) anyway.
NACHOS- it was the best part of our experience. Crispy nachos loaded generously with cheese . It had a tangy dip with some veggies. It was delicious.  Recommended.
Overall we were satisfied .The food was good and they were perfectly at par with the price. No additional  tax charges were imposed.
Hope to visit them again and come back with  an even better experience.

The proverb"good things come in small packages" is perfectly apt for this cute and tiny cafe ..
Located a mintue away from salt lake 3no island.. 
And 5min away from city centre has become the hot hangout spot for all of us salt lake locales.. 
Calcutta 64 has 5 tables.,,,3tables for two people and 2 table for 4 ppl.. That much that it can accomodate, 
At a reasonable price it serves delicious food items mostly tit bits.. 
The menu is wisely drafted,, touching all the sweet spots of the x generation.. 
From coffees to pasta to pizza to salads and sea food it almost covers all favorite items of the youth population... 
The sandwiches are perfectly made served with dips and chips.. 
The omlets look fantastic.. 

Eager to try their salads and pizza.. 
Will definitely visit again.. 

The only thing recommended to the authorities is to try and accomodate the cafe in a bigger space...since the tables are so near it gets awakward sometimes!

The walls of the cafe is all adorned with some very quirky paintings, most of which are for sale. We ordered Mango Shake, Chicken Thai Curry (Red), Bbq Chicken Burger and Garlic Bread ! The food is really good, I especially loved the Chicked Thai Curry. Will surely visit again! :)

The Ginger Lemon soda was okay but hazelnut frappe, a must try. Mocha Mystery and Mocha Frappe was good too. Pizza was tasty but the chicken wrap filling was not good at all. We ordered Affagato for dessert. I didn't like it. It was plain coffee and ice cream.  I want to come back again to try other dishes.

This place is located between 3no. tank and 3no.Island in salt lake area.
One of my friend told me about this place and since then we wanted to try their menu.So,me with my friend went there in the afternoon.This is a very small but beautifully decorated place.Despite its limited seating arrangements they provide excellent service and the staffs were courtesies too.

We Ordered : Egg & Mayo Sandwich,Barbecue Chicken Pizza, Cold coffee and Cappuccino.

Both the beverages were perfectly made.But the cold coffee was mind-blowing and definitely one of the best cold coffees i had tasted.
Egg & Mayo sandwich was perfectly grilled and served with potato wafers and tomato sauce.It was a¬† simple preparation yet the taste was very unique.
We opted for a small Barbecue Chicken Pizza and it was enough for two of us.Pizza was nicely prepared with ample amount of chicken and cheese on it.

Overall we were very satisfied by the quality and quantity of food they served.
Prices were very reasonable and they did not charge any additional taxes.
This a great place to hangout with friends and loved ones.
I would definitely recommend people to give it a visit.........

The staff gives minute details about the food asked for. We had cappuccino, chocolate shake, bbq chicken pizza and cheese garlic bread. Beverages were good, cheese garlic bread was not as expected, it could have been better, but the pizza was perfect. I would really visit this place again to try the pizza and a few other items.

After having read such good reviews about this place, I had really high expectations from them. But it turned out to be a disappointment. The food is very, very average and the coffee is also not that great. We had the pesto pasta , which was bland and creamy and had a distinct flavour of peas , how I don't know. Also, the garlic bread they served wasn't well presented and basically looked like irregular pieces of garlic placed on buttered bread. 
Coming to the ambience, it's a small place. The conversations occurring between people get held up due to the loud blender which they have placed conveniently in the dining area. Also, the staff is not very cooperative and have a careless attitude.

Nestled in a silent corner of salt lake, Calcutta 64 is a gem in itself. It has a very soothing decor and an amazing food. I had their barbecue chicken burger, pasta and chicken steamed momo. I fell absolutely in love with the pasta. It tasted really amazing. And I have to say that the burger was one of the best I had in a very long time. But the momo was not really up to my expectations. I would definitely give this place a double thumbs up!

The place was referred by one of my friend and it was a worth giving a try. The food was really tasty and satisfactory. Ambience was cool and calm, an ideal place for spending good time over food. Considering the decoration, it was a mind relaxing place with white walls and Jamini Roy paintings. The service persons where attentive as well as humble. Though the place is really small, but that can be easily overlooked due to there good food and service. They even have outside sitting arrangements.

We ordered...
*BBQ Chicken,the chicken was tasty and soothing to my taste buds.
*Chicken Thai Curry, was good but could have been more better.
*Fish Meuniere...this was so tasty than we couldn't resist ourselves to order another plate,even before finishing the previous one. This is a must try one.
*Chicken and Cheese Omelette
*Grilled Chicken Pizza
*Crunchy Cold Coffee, crushed oreo on this made me fall for it.
*Hazelnut Frappe, am in love with this drink.
*Cappuccino 
(The best thing is, if you are a true coffee lover @then must try, calcutta 64 's Cold Coffee Beverages. Because they value your love for coffee).

Place to be visited again and again. Hope they won't disappoint in future. BEST OF LUCK to the team.

A tiny little place that is just as big with its food! Perhaps the only small negatives with Calcutta 64 is its jam-packed floor space and music videos on repeat!! The staff are friendly and always smiling. We loved the Pan fried Chicken Momos, BBQ Fish, Fish and Chips, and Cold Coffee. The portioning is perfect according to the prices, and they taste wonderful too. It's a perfect place to unwind; I hope Calcutta 64 will soon expand and add some more comfortable chairs against its pristine white walls. It's a perfect adda place in the making, something that Salt Lake really lacked.

Got to know about this place from my bestiee .. Yesterday we visited it .. The place is near cc1.. The cafe is small , cosy with perfect ambience to chit n chat with friends with a coffee in hand .. Coming to food we have ordered Moccacinio , Mocha Frappe , Hazelnut Frappe ,BBQ chicken in mains and BBQ pizza ..
The way they present Moccacinio , is awesome and its has a yummy taste of hot coffee with chocolate sause :)
BBQ chicken with fried rice was also good , its sufficient for one and they give you some big chunks of chicken also üòÅ
BBQ pizza is thin crust filled with cheese n chicken , the size was perfect and taste good also ..
Mocha Frappe tastes like cold chocolate milk ..
Hazelnut Frappe was good but a bit bitter , may be just becoz i dont like bitter taste , however my friend liked it everymuch ,  its her favourite drink :)
Overall its a best cafe i have ever gone
Perfect food
Perfect ambience
I will defiantly visit again and again üíú

Got to know of this place for the first time through some promotion of theirs' on Facebook and planned to visit it today which I did. Must say that the the place is really nice, a complete package, the food, the ambience which was really very appealing and as I walked in really appreciated the interior which made this place which is very small look really very elegant. So my congratulations to the owners for a job well done. 

Coming on to the menu, the nice move was to not to cramp things up and try and offer every and anything, hence the food me and my colleague had was very tastefully cooked and pleasantly served.

Service was up to the mark as well with the two young boys manning the counter were as helpful as they could be.

Overall it was a nice experience worthy enough of coming back. My best wishes to the owners !

Thanks

Located in sector 1, Calcutta 64, is a small cafe with cute interiors. The place is small accommodating 5 tables. The interiors are done tastefully. Frames, tables, yellow lighting gives a fuss free look.

Between the two of us, we ordered the following-
‚Ä¢ Hot chocolate which was very disappointing! It tasted bland and had milk? Hot chocolate does not have milk!
‚Ä¢ Cold coffee was good and made well.
‚Ä¢ Pesto pasta was al dente but the sauce was overbearing with a strong cream flavor. Also there was no salt. Found a piece of hair in the garlic toast that accompanied the pasta! But they replaced it.
‚Ä¢ Paneer chilli pizza was just wrong! Didn't like the sauce, crust or cheese used.

The service too was pretty laid back. They don't serve quarter plates unless asked for. They don't serve water.
Morover, the sound of the mixer in the small room gets a little too much.
The prices are low but I guess they can increase it to serve some food which creates an impression, because right now the food or service has failed to impress me even a bit.

For now, this place gets a 3 from me ( +.5 for encouragement because right now, the place is only a 2.5 for me)

Not recommending the place at the moment.

Located near city Centre, 3 no. Tank. It is a small cozy cafe, for small groups of friends and families. Ambience was good. Staffs were cooperative and helpful. Service was slow. Food they was serving in room temperature, not only complained by me as well as with the beside table. I think so there micro Owen was not Working properly. We had ordered Veg. Quesadilla, corn&mushroom sandwich, penne pasta mix sauce, cold coffee with ice-cream, mocha sparkling.

The charm of small cozy cafes and the personal touch that they bring with them, calcutta 64 brings with it the added bonus of good food and great service to go with it. I visited the place a couple of times in the last week and had the chance to try multiple dishes from their rather generous menu. The pizzas were definitely top notch although i found their pasta a tad bit dry and underseasoned. The chicken steak was juicy and their coffee.. well thats one of the reasons why you ahould definitely visit this place

Calcutta 64 is a small,cozy and classy place to spend some quality time with your friends and family. They provide you with excellent ambience and the coke studio songs are just absolute peace. I have tried out a number of dishes over there and all of them were almost perfect. The fish meuniere, the bbq chicken pizza, the grilled chicken steak, ginger lime soda and swisspie are my favourites over here. Highly recommended.

Calcutta 64 is a small but cozy place near my house. It has got nice decoration and great atmosphere. We ordered ginger soda, iced tea, chicken ceaser salad and BBQ chicken pizza (Medium). Foods were prepared well and tasted really good. The best thing about this cafe is the price. Very much affordable but not compromising on the quality and quantity of the food till now. Only concern would be the size of the cafe as it's really small, but they are based at a residential area, so that can be understandable.¬†Calcutta 64 is a MUST VISIT cafe and I strongly recommend this place!

üëç Well decorated. Neat and clean. Nice service. Budget Friendly. Yummy food.

üëé Small place.

Near City Centre 1 this small cozy cafe was our destination today.. nice place for a small group of friends, couples.. or solo. good food in low cost. There are 5 tables inside,which makes it easier to have prompt service always. We tried their Grilled Chicken Steak, Egg-Mayo Sandwich, Orange Iced Tea, Cappuccino. Must say, all the staffs are quite active and friendly.
The only matter I faced, being too small a place you'll hear all the talks from other tables, more or less!
If i really rate,
Food quality : 3.5/5
Food quantity : 3.5/5
Ambience: 2/5
Service : 4/5
Decoration : 4/5

Lovely new cafe close to cc1. Though its quite small..But the ambience, food and above all as its totally value for money..its a must visit for all who wanna hangout with friends or loved ones.
The latest bolly tracks playing in the background in the television provide good entertainment. The walls are decorated with quirky paintings.
Now coming to the service it was fine. Moreover one can spend as much time as one wants.‚ò∫
And last but not the least..the food was great in quality and quantity. The BBQ chicken burger was good served wid ketchup and chips. However the grilled chicken pizza was yummy. The small one was even pretty large..and more than enough for one. The hot chocolate was very good but the pinacolada was excellent!
P.S.-we were too hungry to click the pics of d foodüòÅ

This place is having very limited seating arrangement. Anyway it is a very pocket friendly restaurant. The ambience is good. The foods are delicious and the staffs are also very friendly. Good place to hangout with friends for hours. However we felt that the service was too slow, we have to wait long for getting our orders served. And added to that they forgot one of the dishes we ordered.. we kept waiting and waiting and at last had to ask for the bill as it was getting late. I hope they would improve their service cause otherwise I liked the place very much.

A small quiet place with 4tables and beautiful decor. A regular haunt for couples :) There's also a small outdoor seating area. 
Now, this is a very budget friendly place and it does not cut down on quality at all. I loved the Mocha Frappe we took, it was really good. Perfect proportion of Coffee and cream..
In mains we took A pasta dish (Funghii) with extra cheese and chicken. It had no salt but it was prepared well. Thick cream, soft pasta bits and chicken. Season it well and it's a delightful dish. 
We also took #Grilled Chicken. Large portion, served with buttered rice and masala peas. Very nice combination. 
Although the service is a tad bit slow, the overall experience was good enough. I'll definitely come here again. 
And please introduce more items !

My new love in Saltlake is Calcutta 64. Tasty Delicious Scrumptious Flavoured FOOD at a very decent price is what you get here. Yes the cafe is small but how far does that matter as long as you get a seat. Sophisticated ambience and decent staff who listen and cooperate with everything. Since the cafe is small and customers more, service is little slow but it's our duty to keep patience and one can in the meanwhile read story books (they have a good collection) and gaze at the artistic paintings or engage in uninterrupted conversation with friends.

We had a margherita pizza, veg fiery and chocolate brownie in just for 200. Yes they don't take tax. :) 
Thank you for the complimentary drinks Calcutta 64

With all the reviews in Zomato, I was really excited to visit this place !! Rating above 4 in Zomato is itself a big achievement :P
Many a times I thought but finally I went here on the Christmas eve when almost everyone was in Park Street :P
A small cafe very near to CC1.
Hospitality is really good ! The staff gives minute details about the food asked for.
We are Vegetarian, we ordered :
1. Small Margarita Pizza : Good in taste but it doesn't seem to be small.. I wonder if this is small then what is medium and what is large ! Sufficient quantity !
2. Veg fiery : a pakoda type of dish, Heart-shaped with a chutney (6 in number).. It was really good ! We liked it very much !
3. Cold coffee with ice cream : It was a bit bitter in taste. I said the staff about it and he took the coffee away and then he brought it back after mixing sugar to it. It tasted good this time !
And the bill came to be Rs 220.. Inexpensive !

I ll surely visit this place again and try other dishes !!

The service absolutely sucks! We sat there for a whole hour for a plate of French Fries and Chilli Cheese Toast. They have two people who take orders as well as go make the food and probably one tiny oven inside which takes them days to produce 10 sticks of French Fries on your table. Has some 4-5 tables in total so not that they are bustling with work anyway.
Very irritating!

What a fine place! The place is small, but makes up with the minimalist decoration & wall hangings/portraits! Very fresh. 

About the food, we were two, ordered a coffee and a French fries and later a fish meuni√©re. It was filling enough, it would be incorrect to assume a lot in quantity for the fries, but 50 bucks can only get you so much. The fish came with a rice which tasted good, but the fish & the sauce treated sour. Could have been better. 

But the best part is the VFM the small eatery provides. All of this only costed 370! Incredible! This is a place where you're tight on your budget and you still want to have a great bite!

We visited this place for lunch after reading so many good reviews in zomato. It is little risky to go there in a group of more than 4 since total seating capacity is not more than 16. Ambience is cool...service cordial. They were facing some problem with card payment but that i guess was one time issue. Food very good....we ordered 1 coffee, 1 chicken salad and 2 main dishes with grilled chicken and grilled fish. Main dishes come with rice and grilled potato......1 dish sufficient for 1 person. It costed less than 700 bucks...so pretty cheap for 2 persons lunch. I will try their sandwich and pasta as they looked yummy (in other tables üòã). But one disclaimer....if you want to have an exclusive continental dinner.....this is probably not the first choice....there are better places available in vicinity. But No doubt a very good place to hang out in a small group....have good food...with a limited budget.

Have been to this place twice, loved it everytime. Calcutta 64 provides one with really amazing food (personal favorite- Fish Meuniere and Bbq Pizza) along with soulful music played on a loop. Have quiet time with yourself or loud cheer with your friends, this place provides both.  Had tried their Fish Meuniere, Mexican Chicken, Bbq Pizza, bbq chicken, cappuccino, green tea, orange pekoe, cafe frappe, hazelnut, cold coffee with ice cream, and crunchy cold coffee (they all tasted almost the same!), but boy, we did eat a lot!!

This cozy little place is very easy to locate. while going towards Quality from PNB ,take a right turn from tank no 3 island adjacent to the housing complex located there,after few minutes on the opposite side you will find this place. the shop is small that is the only shortcoming of this place.The shop is new, ¬†i guess with time they will be expanding. the food quality is no doubt good. we tried BBQ CHICKEN AND GRILLED CHICKEN STEAK WITH RICE. both of them were equally delicious but still if i have to rate then i will give BBQ ¬†chicken a little more rating. ¬†the sandwiches are great too.. definitely will be visiting this place again.

Firstly, I would like to tell that I never gave a review of any food joint in ZOMATO. But this cafe literally prompted me to give a review, as I was so amazed!!
We, few of our friends visited this small but cozy cafe for office lunch and I hosted the lunch for 6. To my utmost surprise, it costed only Rs.2010/-. We ordered ¬†Fish & Chips, Mexican Grilled Chicken as starter and BBQ Chicken, Chicken Steak & California Orange Salsa Prawns as main course. I was amazed with the quality of food. It was really very yummy and fabulous. The quantity is also good for having a full course meal.
Now comes the ambience. The space is bit small but the well arranged and ¬†well decorated.
The waiters are very well behaved and prompt in their service.
As a whole, the experience with this newly opened cafe cum restaurant is extra ordinary and a must recommended for all. Kudos to the owners of this cafe.¬†
A suggestion: Please arrange for a bigger place so that you can accommodate more people to relish your mouth watering dishes.

Visited this place with one of my dear friend.Though it could have been a date, but I was friendzoned long back.(Lol) Anyways, this place is cozy, sweet and as the name suggests, quirky. The food is really good. The location is definitely a plus point, as it was not that far from my place, although I had to pick my companion from her place, which was twice the work. :) She ordered Funghi pasta and Hazelnut frappe, which was good.I completely lost in the menu and unable to decide, what to order, asked for a BBQ burger and a mocha frappe. Lost in the awesome food, as well as catching up with her life, time flew like anything. Though, I wanted to try their BBQ chicken pizza, I fall short of both time, as I had the noble responsibility to drop her, and appetite as well. Anyways, the ambience, and the overall dining experience was phenomenal. Looking forward for ky next visit.
Cheers..

Went there with friends . Ordered for a bbq chicken  pizza ,  pasta , blue moon , cafe frappe . Blue moon and cafe frappe were good , but the star of the show was bbq chicken pizza. It's one of the best I've had so far in my life . Do eat it when you go there . The place is small but great . Ambience is nice . The service is a little bit slow but the food makes up for it .

We went here for lunch with my office colleagues.¬†
Firstly, I must tell that within such a small place, how they have managed to create such a ¬†good ambiance. This place is really have a very good but simple, sophisticated decor with light audio visual music, which feels good.
Then, come to the food part, we ordered their cafe frappe as per their suggestion and it was so good!!
We ordered BBQ Chicken, California Salsa prawn ¬†as main course and ¬†thin crust BBQ chicken pizza. And at last, as per their suggestion we ordered Mexican Grilled Chicken. All foods were excellent, mouth watering and I must tell that I have never tried this types of dishes earlier.¬†
Lastly, we tried Affogato, which was also very good, had scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate espresso as we learnt the same from their staffs.¬†
I must tell that all items have new flavour and a must try for all food lovers. Service were excellent and staffs were courteous too.
A must recommended place for all. Must try their main courses and Pizzas specifically.

My two friends and I went today to have lunch.The ambience is quite good and the food was more or less okayish.But the thing which created problem was lack of management.Only two people were there who were serving us.They didnt provide us water at first and we had to constantly ask them for things.Also they had started the mixer grinder in the room we were sitting and due to its noise I couldnt talk with my friends properly.I hope they have a better management in the near future.

So we visited this newly open caf√© in sector 1.
Although its a small with just about 5 tables but the interiors are lively and sophisticated. To our amazement, the place was crowded on a Wednesday evening as well. Though a very remarkable mark for an eatery!
Coming to food- We ordered Veg Panfried Momo, Veg Thai Red Curry and Fried Rice,  Penne in Pesto Sauce and Mocha Mystery!

Veg Panfried Momo- We were looking forward to the traditionally cooked momos in schezwan sauce but instead it was Pan Tossed momos. Barring the name..the dish was flavoursome and tasty.

Thai Red Curry with Fried Rice- This was a different take on Thai curry. A bit bitter maybe because of the Zucchini in it but tangy and was loaded with veggies. The  fried rice was better than the curry and was cutting through the bitterness.

Penne in Pesto Sauce- Nicely cooked in pesto sauce but could have been a little less creamy/milky. Pesto tastes better with its overpowering flavour of basil abd garlic. 

Mocha Mystery- this drink was suggested by the staff and we really loved it. It had a nice flavour of chocolate and coffee and was really creamy although just like any normal chocolate shake. 

Overall a decent experience and the quality and quantity of food is nice and sufficient. You won't feel a pocket pinch while visiting this cafe! I would've given 4 but they can still improve alot,..in terms of their food and also by making the place a bit more spacious.

Location: Salt Lake Sector 1, BC block. You can also take a look at maps for your own convenience.

My friend and I went to have lunch in Calcutta 64, at around 12:30pm. We were quite surprised to see it, we expected to be a bit bigger that what it currently is right now. Nevertheless, it was very cosy and comfortable. Not too loud music so as to drown your voice.

Interior designing: upon entering, you will find hardly 6 to 7 tables with very little space to walk around. The seats are comfortable, and the restroom is very small with no mirror to look into. They also maintained a very proper ventilation system, making it feel more relaxed and comfort to us. 

Food and service: there were only two servers, who also happens to be the cashier as well. The menu is simple, not much fancy words in it. However, we were a bit disappointed when the stuffs we wanted to eat were not available. We wanted to have an American breakfast platter, which were not available. However, the omelettes were, which is a part of the American breakfast platter. So this confused me. We wanted to try virgin long Island iced tea, which was also not available. 
So in short, we ordered:
‚Ä¢ mushroom and cheese omelette: this is probably the best thing that I ever had in Calcutta 64. I already like mushrooms a lot and to add cheese on top of that, yum. Absolutely delicious.
‚Ä¢ butter toast:  it was actually two slices of bread, cut into a triangle, thus making it 4 pieces. Goes absolutely well with mushroom and cheese omelette.
‚Ä¢ lemon iced tea: this tastes good, and it has a slight taste that it's made from Lipton brand of iced tea.
‚Ä¢ orange juice: just your normal orange real fruit juice.
‚Ä¢ Grilled chicken steak: every steak items has a side dish. Similarly, we wanted to have mashed potatoes along with the chicken steak. That was not available. So we opted for roasted potatoes. It was also served with fried rice which tasted more like pulao to me. The rice really wasn't all that good. It would have been better if the chicken was served with more gravy, and if there was an option of sauces used, then it would have been much more better. Because lack of gravy makes the meat a bit too dry, thus harder to swallow.
‚Ä¢ Chicken steamed momo: momos tastes best when it's steamed. I really like the soup that they provided. It has a tangy taste to it. The momo meat, again, was a little bit too dry. Adding a little bit of fats inside would make the meat more juicy and more enjoyable. 

Despite all this, we enjoyed the meal a lot. The quantity served was huge and we were not able to finish the meal. Also, the best part about this was it is super cheap. All this costed us around rs560, which is actually quite cheap. 

Would visit this place again!

Went to visit this last Saturday.The place is bit Odd & Secluded.(It is just in opposite of Annex College).Got to know about this from Zomato only.The place is small but it is cozy, comfortable & good for long chat.
Now lets talk about the food.We ordered coffee latte,lime soda,fungi pasta (with extra cheese),pan fried chicken cheese momo & crispy babycorn.The coffee was so so but the lime soda was too sour to intake.But I love the fungi pasta.It was yummy. On the other hand the momo was disappointing & to my surprise the crispy babycorn was in gravy with rice & completely something else rather than the expected crispy babycorn.
All totally I can say that it was not up to my expectation but would like to visit at least for one more time for the fungi pasta.

First comes the ambience. The place is very well maintained and very much clean with proper lighting but then again the space is very small. After this is the behaviour of the staff which is again very good.
Now comes the food part. The tea and the milkshake and the mock tails that was ordered was so-so. But when it came to the Caesar salad the portion of vegetables was very high the quantity of chicken in it was low. And yes the vegetables were fresh very much. Then there was a chicken steak. The steak was good enough but nothing special was there about it.
The last was the affogando, to be true it was a complete mess. The proportion of icecream and expresso was not even in scene.
Now about the price it is on the lower side like we ordered 2 teas, 1 pinacolada and 1 milkshake with a Caesar salad, steak and an affogando. The bill was only Rs. 740/-. In short if you want to yes you can visit the place once.

A cozy little place with potential, to sum it all up. The place seems to be fairly new and still finding its footing, as you can tell from the food, staff and paraphernalia. Focusing on the food, the basics are in place. The chilli cheese toast was curiously a long while coming but quite worth the wait. The pesto sauce in the pasta was good; if only the pasta had some veggies in it. The chicken burger was serviceable. The best thing we had was the cucumber lime iced tea which is just such an obviously great concept!

After many plans, after many elaboration.. finally the execution is done. And super happy with this choice :)

‚àö Location
______________
Located near cc1. If you are coming from karunamoyee towards cc1, you having the lane of 6 bullygunje on the right hand side, from the island don't turn right , just go straight.. you will find it just beside the main road on the left hand side.

‚àö Decoration
________________
Honestly this is one back draw of this restaurant. Very small place. Hardly 14 people to accommodate at a time. Decoration is nice and simple though.

‚àö Food
__________
This segment is just a treat to have. Most important segment and most amazing one.

‚ô†Omlet
____________
¬© Mushroom and cheese omlet: good one. Not that excellent.
¬© Chicken and cheese omlet : owssumm one. Great in taste.

‚ô†Sandwich & Burger
_______________________
¬© Garlic chicken sandwich: owsum in taste. The chicken was tossed in garlic sauce. Amazing.

¬© BBQ chicken burger: excellent preparation. And the taste is just superb.

Will try to taste the other items surely in the next time.

‚ô†Pizza
_____________
¬© Fungi pizza : veg pizza contains mushroom and mozzarella. Owsum in taste. If you are a veggie we will sure to love this. This is like the hand made pizza and the bread was just perfect. We took the medium one having 7/8 pieces.

Will love to try the non veg items next time.

‚ô† Snacks and wraps:
________________________
¬© Smokey chicken wrap: owsum in taste. Excellent one.
¬© Maxican grilled chicken: soft juicy chicken tossed in maxican sauce. Owssumm one.
¬© Veg quesadilla: very very good in taste. Maxican item. Cheese and veggies wrapped in wheat tortilla and grilled then. I am not a veg lover, but yet it taste superb.

‚ô† Pasta
_______________
¬© Pasta in pesto sauce : veg pasta tossed in green basil sauce. If you like basil flavour, this is just owssum to have. I liked it completely.

‚ô† Main course
__________________
¬© Crispy sweet chili baby corn : its taste okay type to me. It's comes with a rice bowl.
¬© Clarification orange salsa prawn: the presentation of it will blow your mind 1st of all. Dish comes with 5 pieces of prawn made in orange sauce come in a bowl made of orange wrap. And the taste is heavenly.

‚ô† Beverages
_________________
¬© Green appeal soda: very refreshing. Nice one.
¬© Lemon ginger soda: excellent one. Very very refreshing.
¬© Mocha mystery: okay type. Basically orio shakes type in taste.
¬© Mango shake: very very good.
¬© Pina colada : that taste just superb.

‚ô† Desert
______________
¬© Affogato : I just love this one. Vanilla scoop with coffee punch in it. The taste of coffe and vanilla ice cream was superb.
¬© Swiss pie : very good. slice pie with carrot and appeal. Great one.

--------------------------------------------------------

Overall a great great experience. Few items are not good to me. But most of the items are bang on.

All that cost 2155 INR. It's for 5 people. So it's more than u can ask.
----------------------------------------------
It is a delight to be there. And will surely to visit it again. As many items still left. It's dat tastey and pocket Friendly also.
---------------------------------------------
To the management: great work. Keep it up. Cheers.
And you guys will become pop very soon, so keep going and main this quality, quantity and cost. And look forward for a big area for your cafe in near future.
---------------------------------------------
The only problem I felt is that they have very little. But the food is good enough to delete the odds from memory.

Last but not the least: do you know it is there in hidden gems list in zomato? It should be right? Let me check zomato then.. and till then enjoy the pics and happy eating :)

Was hearing a lot of buzz about this newly opened cafe so decided to try it out . Neat and classy ambience . Soothing music and pleasing lighting . We were really hungry so jumped right into burgers and pizzas. The chicken burger was good , they served it with coleslaw and little amount of fries. Chicken was tender and flavourful and fries were crispy. Pizza was not so good. They over did with basil and rosemary on pizza. Staffs were decent but take way too much time to serve. Anyway pretty decent cafe with delicious food and very light on pocket .. Will visit again ..

Had the Chicken Caesar Salad, for it's price I have no complaints about the quantity of chicken in the dish, but yes compared to the chicken and the croutons, the lettuce was a bit too much, but overall it was a good dish to have.
Will definitely be visiting here more often to try out their other dishes real soon.

The soothing ambiance along with the pocket friendly range of dishes are the main attractions of the brand new cafe of Salt Lake, Calcutta 64. The quality of food as well as the prompt service of the staff was simply amazing. The Continental Breakfast Platter I had consisted of Cereals, Oven Fresh Breads with Honey, cup cake, omelet & orange juice.

All in all this is a must visit place for the foodies and snack lovers.

This was my 1st time in Calcutta 64. We ordered for a chicken Caesar salad, chicken quesadilla, chicken and cheese wrap, lemon ginger soda and strawberry soda.
To be honest I ordered lemon ginger soda because before visiting this place I read about it in someone's review on zomato. And it really did taste good.
The strawberry soda was also quite well balanced and was nice.
The Caesar salad was good. Very good quantity but it really did need little more croutons, olives and chicken. Because there was way too much lettuce.
The quesadillas looked good but didn't taste half as good. When you eat them u will instantly feel u r having sliced stuffed parantha. This isn't the grilled stuff, the stuffing wasn't right, the taste wasn't like a quesadilla at all. The whole thing was way too dry. We had to ask for some ketchup. They provided it immediately. Kudos for the quantity though.
Now coming to the chicken and cheese wrap, I was disappointed to see that it had the exact same stuffing as the chicken quesadilla. I couldn't locate any cheese but it did have a little more mayonnaise which made it more moist compared to the quesadillas. The actually wrap was quite soft too.
Even though there were a few negatives in my 1st visit, It hasnt demotivated me to visit this place again. Next time I will try their grilled sandwiches, thin crust pizza (which I couldn't this time because they said that their machine broke the night before) , burger and any of the main course dishes.

Calcutta 64 is a long run horse.....the quality of food they provide is undoubtedly one of the best......had tried there hot chocolate, mocha,  chicken salami pizza n fish muniere....all the items where simply fabulous but the rice companied with fish is bit dry.... that's a sort of drawback I found otherwise all is well.....
Small suggestions to you people - enlarge your seating capacity or else most of the people have to wait outside to get your service....
Cheers n happy winter......

The place is just a km away from cc1. The place is very small and by small I mean really small. It can accommodate Max 12 persons at a time.
But as you say good things come in small packages ,the food is good ,service is impressive, people are friendly,interior is beautiful and a very good place to hang with friends.
We order bbq chicken pizza which was way different from what we eat in pizza hut or dominos. The thin crust pizza had a everything rite, starting from the home made pizza sauce to being superb cheesy.
Initially we thought of leaving after just having the pizza ,but the goodness of the pizza made us stay and try some more dishes.
We tried the Caesar Salad with French fries ..... Then again we thought of leaving but this time the next table pasta made us stay a little longer. We again ordered the Fungi Pasta  with French fries.
So overall the place is nice,good food,awesome friendly service but one suggestion please increase the size.

A great place to sit with your friend for a really long chat. Great ambience, cute decor, extremely pocket friendly, yammy & tasty food, good service, friendly people - these are all about Calcutta 64. 0.5 deducted only for the space, as its really a small Cafe, 4 tables which accommodate only 12 people. But when you are fortunate enough to get a table, who cares! Price includes taxes which is again great. 2 cafe frappe + 1 French fry + 1 cheese omlet + 3 hours gossip = only Rs 240. What else you could expect from life ! Just on the main road, easy to locate - another plus point. Probably the most pocket friendly cafe in Saltlake !

Had cappuccino, mushroom pasta in white sauce and cheese chili paneer thin crust pizza. Pasta was okay type. Pizza toppings with cheese was overloaded and yummy though I would prefer typical pizza base rather than crispy thin crust. The servicing was on time. The bill was pocket friendly and I would definitely visit again.. üòä

This is a newly opened cafe in Salt Lake Sector 1 area. The space is a small with only 4 tables. The white walls bring a lot of light within the cafe. The decor is simplistic with paintings hanging on the wall, which are also for sale. Me and my friend ordered a cheese omelette,barbeque chicken burger and a cup of hot chocolate. I thoroughly loved all three dishes! The omelette had ample cheese in it and the hot chocolate was warm,sweet and gooey in just the right amounts. The barbeque chicken burger exceeded my expectations. A thick chicken patty with mayonnaise and cheese and lettuce among other things,it was quite filling and totally yummy. The staff is courteous although service is slow. This is the one of the most affordable cafes I have seen in Kolkata lately. Totally recommended!

The closest eating joint from my house, this place is located merely 4 plots from mine. The store literally came up in front of my eyes and kept me all excited with the goosebump of not having to venture far away again in times of sudden hunger pang. The interior is quite simplistic and has minimal decor. The walls are elegantly put up, and the lovely pictures hung up on one side of the room gives this place quite an artistic vibe. The sitting option is limited owing to shortage of space. But then the food makes up for the most part of it. I have had the opportunity of trying quite a number of things here. Crunchy Chicken Chicken BBQ Steak, Fish & Chips, Grilled Chicken Steak, BBQ Chicken Pizza, Chicken Salami Pizza, Chicken Salami Sandwich, Fried Chicken Momo, Chicken & Cheese Omlette, Chicken Thai Red Curry, Mango Shake and Hazelnut Frappe.¬†

The favorites here would be Crunchy Chicken, Chicken BBQ Steak, Grilled Chicken Steak, Mango Shake and Hazelnut Frappe. The Steaks are usually served with rice, and goes well with the meat or the fish. The Pizzas here are good too and are a nice value for money. The Hazelnut Frappe is a killer and is a thick concoction of ecstasy. Do remember to stir it well as the ice cream settles down at the bottom. The Mango Shake is yet another favorite drink here of mine. Goes well with the BBQ Steak or the Grilled Chicken Steak. The pricing here is quite cheap and won't burn a hole in your pocket.

It is a place with 4 tables but in a cozy setup with reasonable rates too. Has good menu and good food too but be prepared for waiting for your plate to appear. It can get really slow if all the 4 tables are full. Without this for sure 1/2 star would have gone up.cold coffee is good,

A very cozy place for a date. Small sitting capacity but very subtle interior design and a great deal of hygiene. We ordered chicken barbecue pizza, fungi pasta with shredded chicken, cold coffee with ice cream, crunchy cold coffee and hot coffee. The thin crust pizza was great, all cheesy yet crisp with generous amount of toppings. The pasta was good. I was a little disappointed with the fact that they ran out of Irish coffee and whipped cream. Price is reasonable and totally affordable. A must try for all the lovebirds.

Great place to spend an evening with friends. The food is good and the prices are quite reasonable, compared to some other joints in Salt Lake. The place also has a TV and free WiFi. We had ordered a fresh lime soda, a hot chocolate, a chicken burger and a Margherita pizza. The total bill amounted to Rs. 270 including taxes.
Only downside is that the space is very less.

Kolkata, Salt Lake has a new cafe cum restaurant. The restaurant is conveniently located and serves excellent food. I have had the option to visit the place quite a few times and tried varied items from their menu. Be it the pizza or the grilled chicken with rice or the crispy chicken or the fish and chips, it has been awesome consistently! The place has wi fi and prices are soo reasonable! Do visit.

Ds place has been trending on zomato,nd going by their high rating decided to try out their food. This place is located near city centre,the place is small & has seating arrangements for about 15 people. The decor is simple,however the art pieces(which are on sale) are truly commendable. Coming to the food,have ordered for the Barbecue chicken pizza & Fish meuniere. Both the items were appetizing & the quantity was also good. All the dishes are priced reasonably & would like to mention that they are not charging any tax also. But however the only negative thing was the staffs were not too professional,they were fumbling with the cutlery,didn't provide us with the seasoning for d pizza,we were served the same only on request. Apart from this all in all a thumbs up for Calcutta64

Trending on zomato and I was there.. ^_^ first look made me think wether it will provide me good or not. Small a place it is with max of 15-20 seatings. Decor is utterly simple making it look really sober. Staff seemed inexperienced as one of them was unsure whether he could serve the coffee without spilling it. Ordered cappuccino which was really good(unlike most of the cafes it was hot) veg coleslaw that was enough to fill my tummy tastily. The staff suggested to order orange ice tea which was undoubtedly the best I had had anywhere before. Pocket friendly for sure. Only tip use mosquito repellant pls!

A very small cafe just walking distance from city centre. The ambiance is very cozy and warm. We ordered cappuccino and grilled chicken pizza. 
No complains about the coffee.
To my surprise the pizza was excellent. A small sized pizza was enough for 2 people. It was loaded with bell peppers, onions, chicken and a huge amount of cheese. I am sure I have not had a better pizza that to at just Rs 100.
Overall loved the experience. The staff was also very friendly. Really looking forward to visit again.

It was during a drive one evening that er noticed this coffee shop. The white interior and the glow signboard did attract our attention. On entering we found a cozy little outlet which had a very elegant feel to it. Though the wooden furniture is kind of too formal for a coffee shop, yet the simple d√©cor is inviting enough to sit down for a while. What we liked was the involvement of one of the owners as he suggested us things to try and also how he and his brother came up with the idea of the coffee shop. It was Monday and I could try something in veg only.  I Was asked to try the paneer wrap while my husband ordered for a garlic chicken sandwich. We loved the way the food was presented. Next we took a bite from our respective items and we were like 'Wow'. The veg paneer wrap was succulent and it was something I never tasted before. The chicken sandwich was so good that I went back again another day just to try it. I must say it was delicious. We also ordered for a hot chocolate and √† lemon ginger drink. Both the items were mind blowing and must try. I love Irish coffee but it was not available on my second visit... waiting to visit and try the Irish coffee here. The mocha frappe we tried the next day was refreshing and breathtaking. Loved the service and the feel of this particular joint. The coke studio songs being played on the screen added to the feel on our first visit. The cricket match kept is glued to the TV for a long time until we realised that the place is full and there are people waiting. The price as of now is very reasonable and the quantity is equally good. It's a must visit place for sure.

Despite most of the fab ratings this newly opened cafe has received, initially thought of giving it a lower one because of my recent experience with their food.
Had ordered for the garlic chicken sandwich and Margherita pizza via home delivery. The sandwich tasted bland, tasteless, low on salt, almost stale when gone cold. Pizza was average, decent, okayish. 
Food packaging is appreciable.
Was not satisfied with taste of food. 
However, very shortly and promptly they sent me a complimentary set of the same items I'd ordered, a kind of replacement, and this time the food were hot, fresh and delicious! The four sandwiches were accompanied with lovely potato crisps (a different set this time than the earlier ones which had been okay), and the pizza with satchets of seasoning which they hadn't provided the previous time.
Their initiative to satisfy customers shows the integrity and honesty of their business, which I have never encountered anywhere else. This will surely boost their reputation as a happening cool cafe on the block and all over the suburb and elsewhere.
Kudos to Calcutta 64 for their efforts! Do keep up the good work! :)

Whatever you think you fancy, wherever you think you fancy, believe also that you are a queen. Your kingdom is one which is polished with captivating edible little chocolate dwellings atop an enchanting, picturesque landscape which bears witness to a slow wafting wind which imports the scent of freshly roasted coffee beans; Enid Blyton could only grasp at it in a dream state.

Nice Place! Better for Breakfast or Brunch. Quality of food is amazing,waiting time in between ordering and receiving the food is bit more than normal. Not very spacious,tables are clingy! Variety of food is quite nice. Tried Barbecued Chicken Burger which was great,tried their shakes and frappes which are also great ! The Quantity of French toast was however disappointing,but can't expect more with that pocket friendly prices of the restaurant. Their Pizzas are fabulous,its cheap,it's tasty and it's more than what you pay for. Kudos to this place for it. Overall a nice Cozy Food Joint, it is pocket friendly, tastes of food is authentic and the behaviour of the management is good as well.

The place is small but nice and the food is good and quite cheap for its quality and quantity. The decor and food presentation were also nice. I really liked the menu but few of the things that I wanted to order from the menu were not available because they r thinking of changing the menu. I went there for lunch and had grilled chicken steak, Bbq chicken burger, mochachino and affogatto. I loved the chicken steak, affogatto and mochachino were decent. Didn't liked the burger because it was too sweet for me ( and I personally don't want my burger to taste like that ). I am surely gonna visit this place again and again as I wanna try everything from the menu ( I actually liked the menu ‚ò∫).
I am sure they will add some other good stuffs to the menu as they are thinking about removing the breakfast items.

Lovely cafe in Salt Lake. Newly opened. The ambience and decor is so calm n serene. The bright bulbs, the coffee counter, the presentation.... Everything is so good. Has a cosy feeling. Quite a number of options on the menu. I had a cafe mocha and a chicken salami sandwich. Both tasted really good. Pocket friendly. Staff is extremely courteous.d
 The only drawback is the space. Too small. Hardly 4-5 tables. Increase the seating aresea and am sure this cafe will be one of the greatest cafes in the city.

Well Calcutta 64 is definitely a very good place to visit in..Newly opened at saltlake.The space is not much but the ambience is really good.The staff's behaviour was really polite, very much humble.. now coming to the food we have ordered cappuccino and affogato both of them were good.. then we ordered bbq chicken burger and fish finger.. both were served with French fries , sauce and mayo.. which I really liked.. And finally for the main course we ordered Grilled chicken steak but unfortunately it was not good it had some kind of stinking smell so we told the authorities and they quickly changed it and told us to order another thing.. we ordered a new platter of fish muniere.. Now that was really yummy.. filets served with potatoes and fried rice.. our bill came up to be 620 which is really economical.. After having so much of food..I would definitely visit this place again..

This is a pretty newly opened cafe in salt lake..as per the information gathered,they opened their first outlet here on the 2nd of october. We were a little misguided with the pictures here on zomato..it seemed big enough but when we went there it was a shock to see that the place is extremely tiny...only 10-12 people can be accommodated at once. The place is small but really cosy and comfortable..they are still under construction as in the restroom and other small things aren't still complete and cannot yet be used. Coming to the decor,it is very well decorated..even with such small space they have managed to decorate it with paintings and beautiful lightings and it looks very pretty and well maintained..even from outside. The cleanliness is what need to be mentioned..me,personally,i cannot have a meal or any food somewhere if the place is not clean enough..but this place was glowing from every nook and corner,may be due to the fact that it hasn't even been a month since they opened up but they sure have maintained hygiene. Only one person is there to attend the customers and that is why it takes a long time for them to serve the customers..we had to wait for quite some time to get our orders done. Also,they didn't serve us or the others with water until we asked for it and then they took notice of the other tables as well and served them with water too. They need to hire more servers otherwise it would be a problem for customers with less patience.
Coming to the food,the menu is not quite vast and u have some very common options to choose from. Other than some extra drinks the menu is quite bland and simple. We had ordered for one hazelnut frappe and one crunchy frappe which actually took ages to arrive. After that we confirmed with the manager of they would take this much time to serve the burgers and stuff and he confirmed us that those won't take this much time so after that we ordered one chicken burger and one chicken coleslaw burger. Now the food is what impressed me really. The hazelnut frappe was really really impressive and the smell and taste of caramel is what got to me..and the ice cream was also a good accompaniment. The crunchy frappe was good as well with all the crushed cookies and nuts on top along with the ice cream again. Both were chilled and were comfort drinks for the hot weather outside. The burgers,however was a bit cold..not totally cold but was warm and it did not take long for the burger to get totally cold in the ac. Keeping that apart,they served the burgers with french fries and sauce. Not a lot of these burger shops or cafes serve burgers with french fries which is what they should..but here they did that and that was a good gesture. The chicken burger had shredded pieces of chicken along with onions and sauces and tasted quite good..i had never seen burgers with shredded chicken pieces but this tasted good with that. The coleslaw burger was also good and came with a generous serving of mayonnaise,which is not quite healthy but tasted awesome:-P The prices of food here is quite reasonable..they are tax free so you don't have to remain anticipated about the huge hole the taxes will only make in ur pocket..so its quite good that way. Overall,the place is cosy,comfortable,well priced and the food is what will get to people. A nice place to hangout for quick meals.

This place is a must visit to hangout with friends over delicious food. The ambiance is cozy and nice. The food is absolutely delightful and reasonable too. 

I went here with my friend during the puja because i had heard a lot about this place and really wanted to give it a try and let me tell you i am more than happy to have given it a shot. 

We tried the chicken fried momo, the momos were so perfectly fried (not too oily) and the dip was the best part... i finished the whole thing and asked for extra dip, it was that delicious... the soup with the momo was good too...

we also had crunchy chicken... it was so fresh, and again beautifully fried, crunchy on the outside soft on the inside, the chicken was moist and tasty... Beautiful....

I also had a cold coffee with whipped cream and my friend had cold coffee with ice cream, both were yummmm.... 

Surely give it a try... i am definitely going to visit again and again and again... :)

Underdog, this is the word I have for this small yet phenomenal place. I am going gaga over the burger, which by the way is American in the real sense, the wrap, a new twist to traditional rolls, and the Chicken BBQ platter. If you are in or around Saltlake, looking for a place to eat without ripping you pockets off, this is a must place visit. After long have I eaten such astronomical / gastronomical food.
Kudos to the team, specially to the young gentleman whom I met for 5 minutes. 
My advice: make this place open till 2 AM, and advertise your breakfast menu. 
All the best people, I just wish you can keep this quality, quantity and hospitality in the long future.

The coffee was upto the mark, as expected it to be.

I had ordered for momos, presentation overpowered the taste.

Had crossed many a times, but never stepped in , and now i think i would be coming very frequently.

I was looking for new caf√©s in salt lake area, over Zomato, and I came across this place. The reviews were very much positive, so decided to give it a visit.

The decor is minimal and very classy. The staffs are very polite and homely. However the biggest two negatives are:

Firstly, the place is very small, with only four tables and 2-3 chairs per table. And the tables too are very small to accommodate the food for more than two people at a time. The number of diners came and waited inside or outside the cafe for very long. As I was alone, occupying one table, i felt like offering a few diners to share my table, out of courtesy, however I did not particularly want winning kids to occupy the chair opposite to me and do all his nuisance, or elderly people dumping their empty cups on my table, when I have come alone to have some peaceful time. The authority should have handled the waiting customers better.

Secondly, the place is very much understaffed, compared to the intricate menu they serve, which results into a very long waiting time. I had ordered a mocha frappe and a chicken steak. The frappe arrived after 15 minutes and the steak took 45 minutes to arrive.

Coming to the food, in one word it is par excellence. The frappe is thick and creamy and is better than the ones served in many renowned restaurants and caf√©s. The grilled chicken steak was served in a creamy mushroom sauce, along with assorted veggies, poached egg, and herb rice. Well, before I had this steak, I could not think of any steak other than beef, however this dish changed my very conception. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a hint of crunch on the outside because of the grill, which was perfectly balanced by the creaminess of the sauce. Never did have rice with steak before, however this combination of steak and herb rice felt heavenly and the rice was perfectly al dente with mild flavours. The veggies comprised of zucchini, broccoli, and baby corn, evenly diced and stir fried. I ended my dinner with Affogato, which was a perfect bittersweet combination of vanilla ice cream and espresso shot.

I was so impressed with the food that I asked them to pack a Fish Meuniere for my dad, which they did prepare in 15 minutes. The packaging was neatly done with separate containers for the rice, the fish & the white sauce, and the veggies. My dad thoroughly loved his dinner.

The total bill was 650 bucks, ONLY. I mean a mocktail, two full meals and a dessert for 650!!! The evening couldn't get any better. :)

I wanted to deduct a point due to long wait time and a bit clumsy customer handling, however the food is so tempting that I can't deduct any point at all. I would surely come back again and recommend others. Dear Management, please make sure that the people get better and faster service in future.

I was passing by this cafe and the interiors was so attractive that i couldn't resist myself from entering it. I had ordered veg momo it was thin stuffed with veggies & soft, the soup was yummylicious, i think they have the best barista in town, never had this soothing cappuccino anywhere. The prices are too good.. Staffs are friendly & helpful. The owners are cordial and are always present to help you out. Very neat clean & hygienic place.

Yday was our first visit to C64 . The location is more or less good but the restaurant is extremely understaffed. They really need to work hard with the order taking and food delivery thing.However the staffs were polite enough to accept their mistakes & hope this takes them high in future and they learn from their mistakes. Good luck to them.

It is located on the stretch of the post office behind city center salt lake. I was passing through there and got attracted by the wonderful decor and decided have some refreshments after shopping. I was really surprised to see the wide range of cuisine they offered and I went for fish fingers, chicken ceaser salad ,BBQ chicken pizza (thin crust) and afogatto for dessert. Food , ambience,service were A class absolutely and the floor manager was really nice. Altogether it was a great experience and it is a must visit.

Calcutta 64 is a small joint conveniently located at a very near distance from City Centre, Saltlake. ¬†Two minutes of walk from CC block post office. I loved their ambiance, not a big place but very cozy atmosphere. Food was amazing, they really have a wide spread menu covering different cuisines at a pocket friendly price. In this upcoming festive season, if you want to spend some quality time with your friends while having a decent food at cheap price, you must visit this place.

Calcutta 64 is located right on the stretch from Kalyan jewellers to the next stretch. Extremely easy to locate. Based out of a ground floor of a building. Parking available. Wi fi available. Good food, definitely available!!!
The servers are extremely humble and they know their job. The person at the counter aka the manager is a pretty lady who greets you with a smile and guides you through the menu and the place! With this half your evening is made üòÄ
The other half is made by the chef and the decor of the place. Their USP is their main course...they have a breakfast menu as well. The main course is to suit everyone's varied hunger pangs! Recommended, grilled chicken with mexican rice and veg fiery!! Kudos team...will visit again!! Soon!!
