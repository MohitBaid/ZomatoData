This is my 5th time in this Restaurant situated in 5th Floor of Axis Mall. and it never disappoints me. According to me, this is one of the top restaurant which serves authenticate chinese cuisine in Kolkata. Ambience is always good, very calm and quiet. We were very much comfortable with our 1.5 year old kid. 

We ordered Yin Yang Style Fish and Chilli Garlic Noodles. FIsh item was awesome taste. It was two different type of steamed fish in the same platter. One was steamed and dipped in garlic sauce and another was steamed in sweet and honey sauce. Taste was superb and it is must try for fish lovers. Noodles was equally nicely tasted and accompained perfectly with the fish.

I home delivered mixed schewan fried rice from this restaurant.. it arrived on time.. quantity was good.. but the question is.. why do Kolkata restaurant serve normal fried rice in the name of schewan fried rice? Schewan rice is orangish red in colour and damn hot.. this is just the usual fried rice.. anyway coming to whatever they served and not going by the name of the dish, the rice was quite tasty.. and had adequate chicken and prawns.. would request management to look up the actual schewan preparation though..

Located on the fifth floor in Axis mall, Yin Yang is a savior when it comes to Chinese in the Newtown area.

Ambience-
Its all red. Everywhere. I don't know what's it with the Oriental themed restaurants, maybe it's the red dragons, but the interiors only have red lighting. Unsettling at the beginning, one would start admiring the lighting when one sees all the other settings that goes with it. Seating is fine, the Turkish lamp shades are neat and the dragon scrolls and the laughing Buddha give the finishing touches.

Service-
This place has about ten tables, so the waiters are also few. But they give prompt service. Of course they could do with a little more training about the cuisine they are working for, but no qualms, as long as the food arrives fast and hot.

Food-
I have not eaten at many Chinese places where the Manchurian actually tastes like Manchurian. Most places will give you a hybrid chilly invention. But not Yin Yang. Ten on ten there. I went with a Nearbuy lunch voucher, so the menu was fixed, but it all tasted amazing. So, hot and sour and tomato soup, veg Manchurian, garlic chicken, crispy baby corns, chilly chicken dry, Hakka chowmein, vege fried rice, and the oh so amazing darsaan with vanilla ice cream. Every single dish was making me love this place. Although I had a bad experience at an earlier instance with a chilly paneer, it didn't look like I'm in the same place.

In all, very nice place for a date, good Chinese meal or if you want to see how people look like under red light. The menu could do with more Oriental items and the pocket pinch doesn't fit the look and feel or service. Hence a rating of 4.

I bought coupons for lunch non veg from nearbuy.
It was for ₹225 and it was supposed to serve one person, which actually did not happen.you can see the picture the amount of noodles and rice was way to less for an adult to eat. Fyi you had to choose between rice and noodles not both.you shouldn't be mentioning it's for one adult person when it clearly isn't.the ice cream was to be served with darshaan which they didn't have. Like what? Why?
Plus the ice cream was served melted.
Really? Then what's the point of having ice cream in a restaurant?

Never ever go to this restaurant if you are using a voucher from nearbuy or little app. They discriminate between people coming with voucher and general customers. I have been here on both scenarios. The quantity of food, staff behaviour changes the moment you say you have a voucher. Normally if you go without voucher then it is good however their prices are too high.

Overall:-     [WHEN NOT USING VOUCHER]

Surprised that it has such low ratings because our experience wasn't bad. We had chicken manchow soup, Indonesian fried rice and lamb roast gravy and all the dishes were authentic south asian- not the indian chinese stuff that you find in most places
 So do expect the pungent smell that is characteristic of Thai dishes that you will understand only if you have tried street food in Pattaya/Phuket/Bangkok. 

While we have no complaints about food and staff demeanor, service time is a tad slow. However, the awful red light is what spoilt the experience. The management should take the issue seriously. 

P.S.- we were served 2 complementary dishes- prawn chips and taaler bora (some fancy name it was given which i fail to remember). Both were tasty.

As you might now about the Chinese concept of Yin and Yang, there is a little yin in yang and a little yang in yin. This restaurant is actually a blip to that concept as the bad was outdone by only worst. First of all the restaurant is hard to find by and it seems as if it exists in some third dimension, there is just a customary mention somewhere in the Mall that there does exist a restaurant in the top levels of the mall by the name Yin and Yang. The restaurant decor and lighting is quite good and gives a fell of an Oriental setup and that is the only positive otherwise it is bereft of anything that is taste, service and/or entertainment.

This review is based on the food and service as we ordered for a take away. Everything was pathetic. The fried rice was simple boiled rice with few chunks of chicken. The noodles were tasteless and prawns were not cleaned properly with all the black vains clearly visible. You can except it from a steet food joint but not from a restaurant which charges so much on higher side (more expensive than chowman and hatari). Now coming to main course all the the chicken gravy items taste the same. Hardly any difference was there. Aweful. Not the worst part is the packaging. They delivered the main course chicken gravy item in those foil boxes!!! can you believe that. Even the smallest of the food joint also serves gravy item in plastic container. Horrible place. Only consider if this is the last option you have. I am giving them a rating just because they prepared the food.

This is a restaurant of Camelia group and situated at 5th floor of Axis mall. This restaurant boost the chinese and thai menu. The price of the menu is quite reasonable and the decor of the restaurant is quite like an chinese restaurant with red coloured fabrics. The food is just upto the mark. Nothing unique about it. I ordered chicken sui mai with pan fried noodles in cantonese style and szechwan prawn. The items where good. the restaurant was empty whenever I visited.

I went there with family. There weren't a lot of people, because of which we got a table.It was pretty dark place,apart from the red hues.Pretty cold too. Food was ok though. Taste was good, but we had ordered two lamb dishes and they were extremely salty.It seemed to me that in there,only our family was talking. I would ask management team to make this place look a little more family like..I mean Chinese restaurants don't always need to be that red.

While desperately looking for a Chinese restaurant in and around Rajarhat we finally arrived at Yin Yang at City Centre 2,New Town. The best thing was we did not have to wait despite the day being Sunday. The restaurant is spacious but very dimly lit. They could have done with some more light. For starters we ordered Pan fried chilly fish. That dish was quite well prepared and along with that we ordered crispy honey chicken. That was an average dish. In the main course we ordered mix chachoi noodles, sliced fish in oyster sauce, chicken with bell paper and kung pao chicken. Again they impressed us with their fish item. The rest were good as well. Overall the food is good if not extraordinary. One can pay a visit anytime if you are going to City Centre 2 and need a break from your shopping spree.

Yesterday I visited this place for the second time. We had a 4 course unlimited coupon from "Nearbuy". The place is very quiet very few people come here during the day time. The ambiance of the place is good and the decor too, it is a red themed restaurant but i felt the place was too dark they should have focus lamps over the table with low power lamps, to slightly illuminate the place. The music playing in the background were also not so good, Instrumentals by Kenny G or some other good artist will be very nice. The waiters were very good at what they do very professional and well mannered and the service was very good.

Coming to the food:

Chicken Sweet Corn soup: Tasted awesome, made perfectly.

Dry chilli Chicken: The chicken was tender and crisp and tasted very nice.

Pan fried chilli fish: The fish also tasted very good.

Kung Pao chicken: The chicken dish was very delicious.

Schezwan chicken: Not very spicy, it was made very well.

Veg fried rice: The fried rice was not so good tasted very plain.

Veg hakka noodles: The noodles too was very plain and not very tasty.

Overall this place is good at this price range. The place is usually quiet and empty,  very few people during the afternoon. All those who want to spend  some private time with their loved ones over some food, this is a perfect place.

Visiting Yin Yang was a pleasant experience. Going by the current rating I expected little from this restaurant. However at the end, I left the place with a mouthful of exotic oriental taste. They have improved, it seems. The burnt garlic butter fried rice was full of aroma. Mongolian fish was peppery and added to another mouth watering tongue tickling experience. The lighting in the restaurant needs a bit of customisation. It has a saturated red filter feel all over. It is quite evident in the photos. A little more non red light would do a lot of good, offering us a 'see same, eat same' experience.

We went for our office team lunch to this place on Group On coupon - Non Veg - 225/- per head which is great as normally team lunches have tight budget. They give a 4-Course Chinese Meal - Soup (Lemon Coriander and Sweet Corn), Starter, Main course (Rice/Noodles) along with a side dish and dessert - Orange Darsan.
The food is value for money (given the fact that both times I visited with Groupon Coupon) and the ambience of restaurant is good with nice decor, dim red lights - to give a feeling of China. The attendants are courteous.

Again went to this place and this time tried out their A la Carte menu without Groupon Coupon. You should actually try out their menu without Groupon Coupon menu to find out their actual delicacies.

I went with a couple of my colleagues on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only ones in the restaurant.

We ordered 
Busket Chilli Chicken (this is a new thing which I had and it was delicious)
Spicy Lemon Coriander Soup
Pan fried lamb "Xinjiang" style
Burnt Garlic Butter Fried Rice
Ginger Pepper Fried Rice

All the preparations were very good and much much better than what they serve in Groupon Coupon menu.

---3rd Visit---
Went there on a late afternoon and we were told that Yin Yang is closed but we can seat in Calcutta Retro and we will be served menus from Yin Yang only..so dont get confused by the photos I am uploading against this review as the space decor and ambience is that of Calcutta Retro, so lets straight go to the foods

We ordered 
Chicken Manchow Soup - It was good. Put tomato ketchup in the soup to make it better (IMO)
Chicken with Sour and Pepper - This is actually good. Crispy, dry shredded pieces of chicken
Crispy Congee Lamb - The gravy was good but while trying to make it more crispy they ruined the dish.

Sometimes when I go with friends / colleagues we follow Dutch, so it becomes essential to split the money among us and most of the restaurants they swipe more than one credit card without any complains but inspite of requesting and explaining the situation the staffs didn’t allow us to swipe more than one card.
<Its a separate story that their card machine all together didn’t work and we had to withdraw money from the Axis Mall ATM beside Axis Mall. But i don’t have any complain for this one as this can happen but they should reconsider swiping multiple cards as almost all the restaurants does this without any complain>

Situated in the 5th floor of Axis Mall, this place is a nice discovery for me - an all Chinese restaurant with reasonable prices, nice food and ambience.

Ambience is nice as they try to provide a China-feeling with Chinese decors, dim red lights, China show pieces etc.

The red light is however very dim and should be bright.

Coming to food - Ordered Sweet corn soup but had to settle for lemon coriander soup as the former was not available. Soup was just average and very spicy. 

Thereafter, ordered oriental veg salt and pepper which was nice but very spicy.  It seemed just like babycorn along with some vegetables. For main course, I had Veg Manchurian and Veg Fried Rice - both were excellent. The fried rice had a nice mix of vegetables including corn. Manchurian gravy was very tasty. 

For desserts, I had darsaan, which were crisp and tasty !

Service is very nice and staff is courteous. They made every attempt to make me comfortable.

Overall, a great experience.

Despite of avg feedback I decided to visit the place  as it's very near to my office and we have to arrange a Lunch for 10 ppl, so it's going to save lot of our "Business Hrs".. and surprisingly I found the food really good. Almost all of out group members enjoyed the food, secondly  the staffs are awesome, they were really helpful.  Ambience is ok .. Avg .. Don't know why they have so much -ve reviews.  I will definitely visit the place again and also recommend others to visit the place. .. :)

Situated in the 5th floor of Axis Mall, this place is a nice discovery for me - an all Chinese restaurant with reasonable prices, nice food and ambience.

Ambience is nice as they try to provide a China-feeling with Chinese decors, dim red lights, China show pieces etc.

The red light is however very dim and should be bright.

Coming to food - Ordered Sweet corn soup but had to settle for lemon coriander soup as the former was not available. Soup was just average and very spicy. 

Thereafter, ordered oriental veg salt and pepper which was nice but very spicy.  It seemed just like babycorn along with some vegetables. For main course, I had Veg Manchurian and Veg Fried Rice - both were excellent. The fried rice had a nice mix of vegetables including corn. Manchurian gravy was very tasty. 

For desserts, I had darsaan, which were crisp and tasty !

Service is very nice and staff is courteous. They made every attempt to make me comfortable.

Overall, a great experience.

Went to yin yang at city center 2, kolkata.. Very non hygienic food.. Found hair, insects in food.. Cockroaches were roaming around the table.. They manager was not even feeling sorry that.. Did not consume the food.. Moreover the took the entire bill amount not giving any compensation.. Found very bad behaviour from the manager.. Will not visit the outlet again..

The food is average but tasty. The decor is average too. If I were to choose between Mainland China and Yin Yang, I'd definitely choose the former. If I were to choose between 47 South Tangra Road and Yin Yang, I'd still be tempted to choose the former.
For Yin Yang to stand out as a Chinese restaurant, the food has to come a long, long way.

Yin Yang is located at the Axis Mall and is quite a nice palace to sit and have your meal peacefully. The ambiance is average and it's a bit dull to me. The cuisine they serve is decent and the service is quite nice. People react to your orders nicely and are prompt with the service. The restaurant has a seating space for about 50 and the tables are well organized. It's a good place for those who doesn't like crowded places and want to have things silent around them cause this place is mostly empty and not fully occupied.

Here's what I feel about Yin Yang:

1) Quite empty, so you can enjoy a peaceful meal.
2) Very red and dark - needs some happy lighting. Otherwise decor is OK.
3) Staff is not so well-trained, but very courteous and customer-friendly. Service is prompt. I needed to catch a movie in 15, and they served the food in about 10 minutes - very good work indeed!
4) I ordered oriental greens in oyster sauce - quite nice, flavorful and crunchy. The pan fried noodles were OK too - a tad too oily and deep-fried. They did not have paneer or tofu available. But they were open to customization which is good. 
Overall good endeavor and quality, but there's room for improvement. Pocket pinch is on the higher side.

The best thing Yin Yang provided me was a nice display picture for my zomato account! I never wanted to do that, but I guess it was just a bad decision! Then on I shall truely follow the reviews given on zomato. The place was simply RED  (Good for my DP though)! I had no idea what was being served neither did I have an idea how on earth can someone make a dish out of 3 little prawns, only! Even after a four course meal, I felt my dinner was incomplete! 

I think Yin Yang needs to work on the ambiance and I would request them to hire some polite staffs because even if the food of a place fails the staffs should make up for that!

This restaurant is located at the 5th floor of the Axis mall (It is a Camelia group venture). They have two restaurants side by side on the 5th floor of the mall. However, they do not have any hoardings outside the mall hence very few people know about this place. We came to know about this place in Zomato and thought to give it a try as we live in Newtown and the place was nearby.
We went in  a group of five (family). The decor and ambiance was nice. The red light however was a bit of an eyesore (which they reduced on request).  
The place does not have much footfall, so we were the only customers that evening. 
The staff were very courteous right from the time we walked in. They patiently explained many dishes which were on the menu. We ordered a prawn starter and a lamb starter which were delicious. They also served it real quick (maybe due to lack of customers). In main course we ordered chicken and pork dishes along with hakka noodles and fried rice. Both the pork and the chicken were delightful. The fried rice was also great in taste. The noodles were okay.
The best part was however the dessert. We ordered the special fried ice-cream and it was an instant hit as soon as it was served. They make it by covering a real large scoop of ice-cream with some kind of a batter and then frying it and serving it hot.
Positives:
1. Good food
2. Great staff
3. Some innovative items in the menu
Negatives:
1. Location
2. Lack of advertising

While writing the review I am still having headache not because of food but lighting inside the restaurant. The killer red light ambiance is harsh that will one will feel stress to their eyes.
We received Groupon vouchers and thought to give it a try. Though they claim the voucher is discounted price but the quantity is extremely less compared ala carte.
In starters we had Pan Fried Chilli Fish and Oriental Chicken Salt and Pepper. The fish was ok sort of but the chicken batter was not properly cooked.
In main course we had Szechuan Chicken and Kungpao Chicken along with vegetable fried rice. This might be the mildest Szechuan ever tasted and Kungpao Chicken fell flat on its face. Truly disappointing. Finally Darshan was served as dessert which was again average.
In one if the chicken dishes we found pieces of egg shell. Both quality and quantity needs a lot of attention.
Service was dead slow. The management shall understand culinary delight also includes visual presentation and colour of the dish.
Due to harsh red light was very difficult for us to understand visually what are we having. Hence the photos will not make any justice so not uploading the same.
You won't repent at all if you give this restaurant a miss. There are better Chinese cuisine options inside the same building. My wife had food poising post eating here, wish Zomato had zero rating option.

You should have your food here only when you are shy to come out once entered / do not have any option out. . Very average food - nowhere near the better known Chinese restaurants   - Overpriced and small portions. 

Starters are very spicy and over fired. Main course is a slight improvement.

You end up spending 800/900+ per head for which this restaurant does not worth

on 22nd June, me along with two of my friends went to this restaurant. we started with soup Manchow and lemon coriander soup. it was good. 

in starter, we had Basket Chili Chicken, Pan Fried Chili Fish and Oriental Crispy Corn.. non-veg starters were really tasty and as expected. Crispy corn could have been little better.

in main course, we had Szechuan Chicken, chicken with Bell Pepper, Fish in Oyster Sauce and fried rice. in the fish item, i guess the usage of sauce was bit higher but i liked the chicken with bell pepper. 

but here comes the best part, the dessert - darsan with ice cream . it was really delicious. 

**********************************************************************************************************

Now coming to ambiance- the group sitting side is OK about the lightening part but the left side is bit high red. i understand as per Chinese restaurant ,they wanted like this but making it so red using small led lights did not seem too much appropriate. 

regarding Service, we were happy as we had friends to have fun and discuss, never the less we were satisfied but during our visit, one of the customer was not at all satisfied with the service.

Location wise, they have to do lots of advertisement as it's situated on 5th floor of axis mall and people are not very much willing to go axis mall until unless they get some good information about the restaurant.

And finally the food taste, i really liked it. thumbs up for the chef. just in some dishes, usage of sauce could be less. 
& i am a happy customer of this restaurant :)

So 5 star for the decoration. And talking about the food and the services,   the food is quite good. As we were in a fast food mood, we ordered for a Chinese fried chicken, a hot n sour soup. The service is very good and the waiter was very friendly. And the order came within 20 min. The food looked delicious, well garnished, it tasted so good. The food made our evening. n for the food lovers, if u like Chinese food , go or it. This restaurant will serve u good..  :)

Yin yang, situated on the 5th floor of Axis mall is a place which is well decorated,well put up and serviced by capable staff.  Sad part is no one knows about this place(isolated on the 5th Floor of the Mall) and hence no one goes. At 8 45 pm on a Saturday evening the two of us were the only customers around.  Since the place doesn't really run well food is not thst good too. I m not sure about the kind of ingredients they use. However, the staff is courteous and they greet you well even though they know you are the only customers for that particular evening. 
Not recommended overall.

We had taken 4-course non-veg meal on 11/4/2014. This ambiance is very good. The food was not up to the mark and not testy at all. The amount of food (soup, starter, two main course, dessert) is fixed and it is so small that it will not even fulfill the appetite of a baby! In starter, they will serve only two small piece for each person :) Therefore for a foodie guy, it is the worst place to go mainly because of the amount and also lack of taste in food. The service timeline is also very boring.

The ambiance is too red for a comfortable meal experience. It was so red that all the food items looked same.  Also the place is pretty cramped.
Food is not upto the mark, there Indian kitchen offers much tastier alternatives. Pricey when compared to the service and quality of food.
Don't want to go back again soon.

Very bad experience!!!

We have visited the restaurant on 08 Nov'13 for a team lunch.
The food was very poor in tsste. The recipes are of their own and not accorfing to the stsndard taste.
We h ave order Hot chicken wings and received chvken drumstick s. Thry crispy konjee Lamb was full of aniseed. 
In the main course the Kun Pao Chicken was ordinary roadside chilly chicken and Lamb in oyster saw was lamb with cinnamon .

Even they couldn't make the Fresh Lime soda. We were bound to return the same.

This place is not worth of giving a single try. It will spoil your mood.
Total wadte of money and time.

Nothing good to mention. Worst experience

Suddenly a couple of eateries have sprang up in the Rajarhat area apart from the old Mehek e Punjab and Addiction which had become quite boring for me after repeated visits. Located on 5th floor of the Axis Mall, beside another new joint 'Calcutta Retro', this Chinese-Thai joint serves decent food. Staff are well behaved and polite, ambiance is good but doesnot deserve to be priced on the higher side. Though its not costly but over-priced with respect to the food served. 
Their signature dish would be Garlic Butter Prawns which was tender and tasty, Schezwan rice was good, Kaeng Ped Thai Chicken was supposed to be cooked with coconut milk, not submerged in it, Mongolian styled fish was delicious, Konjee Crispy Lamb was over-fried. We had other dishes too which were average, but I would not care to mention them.
Fried Ice-Cream was a total let-down with the fried coating being too much thick  and thus too heavy on the tongue.
I am not sure if I would really want to go back again as I could not find any taste that lingers. A good one-time experience no doubt. Do visit if u work in this area and want to explore a new joint (only for the sake of exploring) !

Visited Yin Yang in Axis Mall. They had an offer of 299 for 4 course meal. The portions served in the meal was so small that it wasn't sufficient for a person having less appetite also. ice-cream served was just size of a spoon full. If you have an offer please at least make it a point to offer quantity that would make a person feel he has had a meal,rather than a snack.Or if the restaurant cannot afford to properly feed at 299,rather do not have any offer. In main course i was given two small chunks of chicken. 
Food taste was just ok, not worth the high prices mentioned in Ala carte menu.Avoid at all cost
