Very Very dissapointed with the Fish fries , there was a time when They were quite famous for fantastic fried fish but lately there is more of rubbish inside the fry than rather the fish ...Rolls used to be succulent and huge , now what you get is the normal roadside kind of rolls , no difference and then they go and spoil it by adding cheap sauces into the roll ....yikes !!!
The chicken lollipops are no more lollipops but rather small 1" small pcs fried to the bone - Pathetic

Good place for snacks and light items. I ordered a chicken kebab and fish fry. Fish fry was delicious with good quality fillet and tasty coating. The kebab was pretty much like home cooked chicken stir fry. Wouldn't recommend that but the snacks are good

I've visited this place many times (bcz my house is near). Chicken rolls are really good. Momos r worth trying too. Prompt service. Pocket friendly. Nothing too special about it though. No seating arrangements. Menu is also limited. But since the pocket pinch isn't high, you can surely give it a try!

After Watching The Movie Naam Shabana At Navina Cinema, Tollygunge From 11:30am - 2:00pm I Visited This Place Gossip, Prince Anwar Shah Road For The 22nd Time After 9 Long Months. The Movie Was Good Filled With Action/ Thriller Just Like Baby 2015. Akshay Kumar And Taapsee Pannu Rocked The Movie. Most Anticipated Movie I Have Ever Seen In 2017. Coming To Food: I Ordered 1 Combo Pack For Rs. 90/- And 1 Chicken Kebab Roll For Rs. 35/- Total Rs. 125/- The Food Was Delicious And I Was Satisfied With Both The Movie And The Food. Thank you Gossip For Making My Day Priceless.

To start first the quantity of the food is sumptous next price is extremely reasonable..
Comming down to taste is also decent I had been eating here regularly for evening snacks whenever I am at my friends place in Golf green. We mostly order hakka noodles, chilli chicken dry and chilli fish and I must complement their food is good!! The owner of the place is very well behaved and he is friendly and whenever I am down at his place we engage in a friendly chat always!!
For me at Lords more this place is a must try joint!! High five!!

I like the placement of this eatery. Just at the heart of Lords! And I personally love the momo of this place. Food is precise and neat. Good hygiene, and reasonable price. Just if there was something that could make it stand-out.. Would be nice.

Gossip has been around in lake gardens for many many years now. Very good price line. When ever I have small parties at home I order both the fish and chicken munia because the taste good and come in portions. Momos and rolls are also good.
