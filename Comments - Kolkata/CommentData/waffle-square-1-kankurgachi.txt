I had ordered black current waffles and the kit kat waffles .... and I Loved It. The warm and creamy and yummy waffles are heavenly to eat!! Certainly lifts your mood and gives you soooo much happiness...  the kit kat waffle’s base was filled with Chico chips .. so if you love chocolates like I do, you should definitely try it out.

Location-- right outside pantaloons kankurgachi.
My first waffles were from here. Quite a small outlet with just only 1 staff running the entire shop. The reason why I rated it 3.0/5 was only and only because of the nutella waffles. The service was extermely poor and the person made mewait more than 30 mins just to serve me 1 nutella waffle. He was extremely inexperienced and had to check the waffle's crust more than 10 times to ensure it's hardness.
Now the food:-
NUTELLA WAFFLES-- the waffles were finally served and they tasted nice enough. Although they lacked proper plates to serve them. Moreover he served my vanilla icecream beside the waffle and not on top of it, which made it quite difficult to have the icecream along with the waffle itself. He was generous enough with the amount of nutella though and sprinkled nuts on top of it. 

I would certainly go back and try more variants only if they can get better experienced and effiecient staff.
