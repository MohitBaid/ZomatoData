Another restaurant on Theatre Road, adjacent to Emami Market, its proximity to schools, colleges and markets make it a popular hangout spot for old and young people alike. With all sorts of chaats like papri chaat, aloo tikki and puchka, the menu also includes sandwiches, South Indian, North Indian, Chinese and even Italian fare, complete with softy ice cream to polish it all off.

Overall a good experience to eat overthere... but don't go with many expectations!!

Now time to review this parar dokan (local eatery) thats hardly 500 metres away from my residence. You cant call it a restaurant, its an eatery with no option of dining in. Located right on Jessore Road near Kalindi Bus Stand, hardly 20metres towards Tentultala. Its hard to notice given the small signage they have placed. However, people nearby knows the restaurant and they aint losing business for being non entiity. Basically I dont prefer veg food outside. But Ridhi Sidhhi Palak Paneer is a class apart. Ditto with their Aloo Paratha. Both these items are super cool at this eatery over and above soft hand made rotis they sell. Probably very few people in the locale are yet to tastek Riddhi Siddhi rotis... ; p
