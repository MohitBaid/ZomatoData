One of the worst outlet in terms of food and drinks. We ordered a plate of Chicken Pakora and Coffee since that was only available. Quantity and quality was poor compared to the amount charged. Will not suggest. Not satisfied.

This place is situated @ d entrance of Eco Park. From outside it looks like an expensive place with extrovent price but once you are inside its totally pocket friendly. Prices for Tea and Coffee ranges from RS 30 to RS 90 a Cup. Well we ordered a couple of Cheese sandwiches price @ RS 40 a plate which was awesomely made, Grilled to perfection with liquid Cheese. And decorated with wafers which were lays. Also we ordered sausages @ RS 100 a plate which were served with mayonnaise and again decorated with wafers. Finally we had a Masala Tea @ RS 35 a Big Cup with all spices and condiments. We also had a Darjeeling Tea which was totally refreshing with its flavors. L @ RS 90 a cup Filled in a kettle. Finally we had a filter coffee @ RS 40 a Cup which too was refreshing. The lady owner is quite friendly & always interacts & takes feedback from her customers regarding the quality of her beverage's. They also sell lassi & Soft drinks. An ideal place to spend quality time with your partner must visit.
