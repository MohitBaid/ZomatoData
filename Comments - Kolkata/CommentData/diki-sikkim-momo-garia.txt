Awesome place...
Nice place to jump in for food with friends.
Pocket friendly and the food taste awesome.
We ordered thaipo which was awesome and cost 30/- it is a jumbo size momo.
The shefali taste good too bit oily but very good.
For dinner we ordered
2pack of chicken chowmen
1 thukpa
2 shefali
Total was just 240.
They take a bit time but it is worth waiting for.

This evening I was without my smart phone, went to patuli for a evening walk to lose the calories , but all r in vain while I tried today chicken fry momo and Chicken noodles. Both cost 170 INR . Gained calories , but best thing is my mind became happy when I tried these dishes.

A road side stall with dogs and mosquitoes hovering all around,you get momos and thukpas served here.We took a plate of fried chicken momo that costed ₹60 ..there were six reasonably good sized momos but oil dripping and no tissue to soak it up...if you can blindly munch on street food...you can be here...the oil could hv been less but taste was good thats why a 3.5 rating!I hv seen fried momos in roadside Delhi but the first had one in Kolkata that too near my place...the owner could do better!

I can proudly say they make the best momo in my zone! I have tried momo at several places, big and small, but this one simply is the winner. This is actually a mobile-van outlet. You can watch momo being made live. This is the best part and I love watching the way they make: stuffing the minced chicken inside the flour dumpling and then beatifully sealing them in a unique design. 

Another speciality about their fiery-hot sauce is that they make it by themselves, not purchased from anywhere. You will feel a touch of own-ness here. Nothing artificial. And obviously the momo tastes finger-licking with the blissfully made soup with chunks of chicken bones and lots of vegetables accompanied with the fiery-hot sauce. 

Previously they used to make veg and chicken momo both. But presently they have confined to chicken momo only. So this might disappoint the strict vegetarians. 

 A new introduction in the menu is Thukpa and Steam Roll. These are yet to be tried out. 

Very easy to locate. Keep heading towards Fire Brigade keeping the Hanuman Mandir on your left. You will find few stalls as well. Under a big tree birds chirping you will find "Diki Sikkim Momo".

This is a temporary stall, mostly suitable for takeaways, but you can have your dish standing there as well.

The good:
1) Good dumplings (momo), I mean really good dumplings at this scale and setup. The price is justified too. I find more oil in steamed momo in other places, but not here, they know their business.
2) More good dumplings.
3) The owners are very friendly and nice, they take care of your order well and communicate the status in an organized fashion.

The bad:
Well nothing as such, considering the fact that this is a mobile outlet, the place is randomly closed occasionally. Also you have to have your food standing under the sky if you are not doing takeaway.

Verdict:
Good, tasty and somewhat healthy (compared to even bigger kitchens) food for a very justified price range. Not sitting (in the strict sense), best suitable for takeaway or casual eating.
