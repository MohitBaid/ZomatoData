The concept of Churros making its debut in Kolkata was both exciting and alluring. Adding another feather in its hat, Kolkata and its people are awaiting for such concepts to quickly grace the roads. However, our experience at Bosphorus Churros & Co. Salt lake branch was disappointing. Firstly, one of the worst locations to choose as it is inside the RDB Cinemas, so either you buy a ticket for a movie or simply wait outside the security checkpoint for them to come and explain the menu. 

We went for the second option and had to wait for 10 minutes for a guy to come up and hand us two leaflets. We were a bit surprised, but the want to try out Churros prolonged our patience. We tried two Churros; we selected one to be filled with Nutella and dipped in White Chocolate and topped with M&M. The second one was filled in the same, but was dipped in Dark Bavarian Chocolate and topped with KitKat and Choco chips. 

The Churros came and it tasted wonderful, the cinnamon essence draped in such amazing flavours would satiate your sweet cravings. However, our experience was marred by another mistake and this time it was the billing. We ordered white chocolate, but they charged us for Nutella. Upon asking for it they made the necessary correction. 

We are yet to try out the other outlets, but a big no if you want to taste Churros in and around Sector 5 excluding you are going to catch a movie at RDB. Extremely slow and confused service makes it unbearable.

Churros were something which wasn‚Äôt easily available in Kolkata but thanks to this place now we have a wide range of flavoured churros to choose from. I tried the peanutbutter  and loops churros with chocolate filling. I brought it home and, though it tasted great, it was a bit soggy. I‚Äôd advise all to have it there itself ! Enjoy .

A churros boutique is trying to set a new trend in town. They're on the verge of expanding as well. Situated in RDB, Bosphorus has a seemingly perfect crowd - couples and college-goers.
Any sweet tooth is bound to have a try and with so many options, I bet the ladies won't resist as well.

THE FOOD
The churros are on-point as go very well with the toppings and dips.
Even just the original churros (churros with cinnamon sugar) is very tasty.
But for the freaks out there, I'd recommend-
Madhouse(Churros +Nutella +m&m)
Swiss Affair(Churros +Nutella +Toblerone)
My combo üòá (Churros +White Chocolate +Bubbly +Chocolate Almonds)

CONCLUSION
People love fried food and people love dessert. Ergo, churros will be a big hit in the City of Joy. And what they're selling is compact and has an on-the-go style packaging makes it very portable as well. Very street food friendly and a possible trendsetter IMO.

The madhouse churros is my favourite accompanied by the nutella floop and toops the dough is very tasty and is very heavier in taste as it is prepared by flour and it does make the taste very rich...a must try dessert...

Gaining a lot of popularity across all over hearing a lot about it from facebook and seeing such tempting scenes of churros I couldn't resist myself from ordering one.

The churros was crispy and the Nutella?Yummy!
The pistachios added more of to the taste of the the crispy churros.

Delivery was quick. Price's are reasonable too .

Churros makes it entry in Kolkata.

So what is it basically? - it's a Spanish sweet snack. Fried dough pastry. A strip of fried dough, dusted with sugar / cinnamon.

From the day I came to know about its opening in Kolkata, I was very keen to taste it.

Location:
____________
RDB, 2nd floor. So, you can have it only when you are there to watch a movie in RDB.

Churros:
_________

They have various of options. They offer you some predetermined churros. Or you can make of your own.

For that: the basic base will always be there( basic churros), they you can select the fill it. It will be in the cylindrical churros. Then on the churros you can select the dip of your choice. Then on top, you can select the topping.

‚úì The Dark Knight- this one was predetermined im the menu. Choclate fill + choclate dip + KitKat topping. Amazing in taste.

‚úì strawberry fill + Nutella dip + topping choclate almond- superb in taste. This combination went just extraordinary.

‚úì peanut & loops - froot loops with peanut butter. Not that good.

Have the churros as soon as they prepare for you. Hot churros is just too delicious.

This review is totally based on the items I have tasted.
This is unique and amazing experience.

All that cost - 373 INR.

They are yet to start the milk Shake and ice cream section.

And what I came to know from them, they are launching some Indian taste item very soon

Team Bosphorus Churros - wish you many success for the unique thing you serve here. Cheers :)

Churros is a Spanish dessert... Basically it is a fried dough with a coating  of suger syrup for giving it a crunchy texture... 
Bospurous introduced this delicious dessert for the first time to Kolkata... And obviously with some fancy twists... Apart from the suger coating, there Churros have a predominant cinnamon flavor... But they had plenty of options for filling it up with Nutella, strawberry, chocolate or salted caramel... Plenty of dips like bavarian chocolate, white chocolate, mango etc. And also have lots of topping options like snickers, kit kat, M&M, pistachio, mix nuts etc... You can make your own Churros with these or you can go for their regular combinations too... 
I had Peanut and loops, the swiss affair, planet red and customized two others... All were just awesome... Belive me just awesome... 
Nothing to say about home... Although the service was quite satisfactory and the pocket pinch is bit on the higher side... But completely worth it... 
P.S. Consume it hot... It will taste heavenly...

Who doesn't love desserts and specially when a new variety is presented to you, went to this outlet during a movie interval. Couldn't restrict to just one, their mad house is a must try and so is their kit kat variant.
A must try for those who have a Sweet tooth.

A tall brother of donuts has just landed to the town. Churros a new dessert was spotted by me during intervals, ordered one but couldn't stop at that, tried too many options and ended up missing some post interval fun.

The best among the lot was mad house, it had m&m toppings, which are crispy and at the same time just melts in the mouth, the best among the lot. Also loved the ferrero rocher which had Nutella in its base.  The kit kat and the twix toppings were equally surprisingly. 
Recommend for everyone to enhance your movie experience.

Bosphorus has gained a lot of popularity amongst food lovers making churros one of the go to desserts for everyone. Hearing a lot of positive reviews about the place, I got myself a churro delivered by placing an order online. It was crunchy and fresh when it reached my place, presentably packed in a cardboard box and toppings kept separately in a pouch. 
My order was a classic cinnamon and sugar churro topped with Twix and Nutella. Definitely worth a try at the given price point.

Finally, Churros in the City of joy! Couldn't wait to try these out. Thus got it delivered to my place from this newly opened Churros joint. I ordered for The Swiss Affair - a toblerone topped churro filled with Nutella. These are by far one of the best Churros I've ever tried. Had a great balance of the sweetness and the crunch was just right. I look forward to order some more next time soon.

I opted for home delivery, from the new and only churros place in the city. 
I ordered for a ferrero rocher topped churro filled in with Nutella- the dark Knight. 
And a red planet, which was KitKat topped plain churros. 
They were amazing. Though having it after an hour of transit, it tasted lovely. 

They have outlets opening all over the city. So watch out for that üòçü§û

Location: RDB Cinemas, Salt Lake Sector 5.

I was really excited when I heard that churros have finally come to kolkata so I did not waste anytime and decided to head to this place along with a friend.

What we ordered:

They have a menu from which you have to choose from different fillings,dips and toppings to make your own churros.

The first one we opted for had nutella filling with dark chocolate dip and M&M as a topping,it was amazing really soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

The second one we chose had salted caramel filling with strawberry dip and choco chips topping,this one also tasted amazing.

The service was okay and the pocket pinch is reasonable.

So I tried Churros for the first time in my life. I didn't even have an idea about it until I came across Bosphorus Churros & Co.
I customised it with a strawberry jam filling and topped with Nutella and Toblerone. The Churro was absolutely fresh and crispy. My experimentation of strawberry with nutella might not have been too well but I was still wishing for more. It was such a good thing to have!

Finally churros in Kolkata.It's located inside RDB cinemas so they won't let you inside.So it's a bit of work to get to the churros.But you can call them up to get your order placed.It is a takeaway place.
I had a churro with white chocolate filling and dip finished off with an oreo topping. Tasted great. It had sugary syrup and was yum.Hope they open in more accessible places soon so i can try out their other flavours.

So ultimately  the independent churros outlets have made an entry in the city of joy.It is a small takeaway counter with all the varieties of churros in display.They make the churros just in front of you and you get the option of customizing it according to your wish.Though we found it quite overpriced but its worth a try.We tried many varieties in it but what we liked the most was-

1:Kindergarten
2:Bumpy
3:The dark knight

Churros are fried dough pastry which hails from Spain. When i heard that churros are being introduced through the hands of Bosphorus Churros & Co. I couldn't resist myself, so i took along Disha with me.They have a mcq type of menu where you have  your own desire to choose a filling, a dip and a topping. So i took nutella as filling,dark chocolate as a dip and M&M as topping. And my friend had chosen salted caramel as filling, strawberry as dip and dark choco chips as topping. They makes their churros right in front of you. Now what i loved about the churros was that they were crispy outside and soft inside.  Both the flavours were heavenly. The service was a bit slow but overall we both liked it. Will surely try the other flavours as well.

Located in the 2nd floor of RDB Cinemas where food court was.
Takeaway outlet which serves Churros.  Presentation was really cool. Thumps up for quality, quantity and taste. Price was little high but tastes and quality manages it. Service was bit slow but reasonable as you're getting purely fresh products.
So Churros or Crispy rounded waffles centre filled with Chocolate, caramel etc of your choice with Chocolates, dips of your choice and loaded with toppings of nuts, m&m, cadbury, Oreo, KitKat etc of your choice. A Crispy, chocolatey, sweet and very delicious dessert which absolutely you gonna loved it.
I tried mix nuts Churros and Oreo Churros both were superbly delicious.
A must try please, highly recommended..

New destination for one's chocolate cravings! Loved the churros. Just mouth watering combination of the fillings and toppings. Tried the silk bubbly churros and the fruit loop one. Preferred the former. Salted caramel filling with Bavarian chocolate and silk bubbly is a delight to taste buds. One negative and just one-since it is located inside RDB cinemas, only one or two people can get access. Becomes difficult for bigger groups.

PS: staff is super helpful and sweet. So is the look of the counter. Loved the vibrant colors.
