Standard sweets are available here.nolen gurer puli is my favourite one.creamy ,smoothy outer nolen gur flavour just make my day.this is kind a out of typical misti.misti doi is also fresh and very yummy.tried their snacks items too.hooked for paneer pasinda.it was a bit oily.dont like it so much.but their rosomalai is big thumbs down.it does not even tastes like kheer  or something creamy.plain milky flavour.i have tasted better roso malai than this.

Jalajog is a very under rated sweet shop. Down memory lane, this shop and it's several outlet happens to be a part of my fondest memories. Every time you take a bite of the confectionery in here, it gives you a taste reminiscing to home made bakes. It is a must visit for sweet tooth. I promise you would not be disappointed.

Actually Kolkata is a place of authentic sweets...There are so many sweet shop out here. Garia is a place where the competition is high in sweet shop.But if you want standard out here,jalajog is one of them.Their dry sweets are good.we tried their balusai and moong ka laddu,it was good,not like wah lajawb,but okk.

Tried their baked rasagulla and sandesh. Not bad quality sweets. A sweet shop that comes up with sweets that are okay to have once in a while.

Serves really good quality and tasty sweets and snacks. Specially their rasgullas was very delicious and soft. But in home take away make sure you finished your chhena and cream sweets and also masala filled snacks within approx 3 hrs otherwise they get sour.

The rasgulla of this place is comparitively better than most of the sweet shops in that area...they are soft and spongy and luckily for me,not too sweet.
