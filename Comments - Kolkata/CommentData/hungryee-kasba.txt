Food quantity is really good and hot garlic chicken is too much hot. So be careful on that. Timing was good. Food taste was good. But it was just 7 mins late, not a big deal though.

Absolutely addicted to their mixed fried rice.
When I first tried it I thought the prawns wouldn't be cleaned well, like most of the other places but considering the price they provide really big and clean prawns unlike the other places..might be a bit on the pricey side considering its one of the smaller places but the box is stuffed and compact..in each mouth you get a prawn and chicken piece or more and the combination of the slightly  sweet red carrots mixed with the savory dish top it off and  make it hard not to want more.
Have tried the mixed thukpa Definitely worth the price. Sweet corn soup is a favorite. Momos are pretty average but their spring rolls are delicious! Definitely will be ordering more of the thukpa.

A big Thank you to my uncle for making me try out this place.  I have heard of this place but never got an opportunity to try it out. 


He had brought the Pork Pan fried noodles and trust me it was an absolute delight. The meat was tender and juicy, the Vegetables were delicious and the noodles were not your regular run of the mill noodles but actually more like spaghetti.

The quantity was really good and so was the taste . I really enjoyed my experience and am looking forward for more.

The only cause I am giving an avg rating of this restaurant is "hygiene". The quantity is more than enough. I ordered a mixed thupka for lunch. And the quantity was so good that I ate it in my dinner also. Price is reasonable. Delivery was within time. Now coming to the quality. I can say it was good in taste. Though there was some big chunks of cabbage which we normally do not like while eating, and there were some prawns with its shell on it which is a big no for me. Everything was fine till I found a piece of aluminium which we generally use for washing of utensils (‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶® ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶ø). Like seriously? If it was by mistake then pls the restaurant authority try to improve your hygiene level when you cook coz this can really upset your customer. Otherwise everything was good but just be carefull in this matter. I hope you won't upset me next time.

There was a time when we used to order food from here on a frequent basis. Those were the days of our residing in Kasba area and this was one of our favoured places to get food from. Must say that nearly 7 years have passed but the taste remains the same, the quality and quantity is reminiscent of those days too. We have always adored the food that they put on the table and the adulation remains the same too. Their Chicken Drumsticks, Chicken Chowmein, Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken are worth every penny that one pays and the quantity is amazing. The home delivery service is excellent too. We have been their loyal customers for a long time and I don't see much of that changing too, in the future. Good food at a very reasonable price....what else can one expect??

Well first time I placed an order with this fast food chinese joint after going through the reviews, and must say it was worth ordering. Im bit choosy about the tatse of food and after having their lemon chicken and chilli chicken it is worth saying that they maintain a good taste that will keep the foodies drop in again and again. Also the quantities of the two ordered dishes were much sufficient enough. Looking forward to have some more from them. Cheers and good going Hungryee..!!! Keep it up.

Never been to this restaurant.. Just order whenever I visit to my colleague house. Zomato and he himself referred this restaurant.. 

Price to quantity ratio I can say it is above average. They seem to me a very good para restaurant with so depth in Chinese menu. Love to see pork in their menu. Till now we had ordered Chicken lollypop, Mushroom chicken, pork chopsuy, trampura chicken, mixed Meifoon and chicken with bell peepers.  Each and every item is damn delicious.. 

The drawback is thier delivery time management. Be sure u order more than 1 HR before the time u want to eat.

As you call yourself Hungree?, my answer is "No, not anymore". Just for everyone's knowledge, please do not order food from this place on the days of India's matches as they are closed for delivery. An answering machine takes the order and says it will deliver the food within 45 mins but even after 2.5 hours the food doesn't come. And everytime to check with them the answering machine says that the person has left 10 mins back!!!  Isn't it incredible, a delivery boy loses his way from Kasba to Bondel Road!!!

Hungree has been a favourite ever since childhood, right from the days when they opened up in talbagan. They then shifted just next to the new kasba police station and finally relocated to where they are now. This place marked the beginning of good chinese food in this locality and others followed suit. Probably I am a little biased towards them and overlook all flaws to focus only on the positives. The meifoon here is a must try and i LOVE their crunchy lemon fish though it's a bit extra hot. All the chicken and fish preparations are very good with the exception of garlic chicken which is just too sweet for my palate. Whenever mom doesn't feel like cooking, we order from here and these people are usually very prompt with their delivery service. This is not a place where u sit and eat, instead it's good for takeaway and home delivery.
Recommended for reasonably priced kolkata chinese.

They are good deliverers! You can order almost anything in their Chinese category, where they serve quite some good quantity. The taste is good as compared to the roadside toddlers. They will not serve you authentic flavour. Adding onto the local touch in their food, serves the local mass quite well.
I tried the Chilli Pork: didn't like the concept of coating the meat. Hence I will rate it low on meat meeting the buds.
Prawn Fried rice: the carrots are way too visible, the prawn not evenly cooked. The taste is more Bong-Chinese. Rate it as okay.
Their noodles on the chicken variant is tasty...again on the Bong-Chinese flavour.
Tired! Don't wanna move ur muscle on a weekday...dial hungree and order a reasonable meal.

Compared to the oder food joints tat r running in kolkata dis place truly gives u value for ur money.

I haven't really got inside and dined. But I and my friends keep ordering from here. First of all its very pocket friendly. And the food is extremely tasty. I personally feel that the chicken fried rice they make is addictive. You have it once, you are bound to get back to it again. One plate is enough for two people. You will get a distinctive taste. I simply love the starters specially the dry chilly chicken with onions and capsicums and the juicy dragon chicken. From side dish you can order the hot garlic or manchurian chicken. The chicken and baby corn soup tastes good too.

Maybe little underrated but when the unannounced guest arrives or just a lazy Sunday dinner then this place is at the rescue. Home delivery takes a little time on holidays but food is quite good. Do try their pan fried noodles and their starters are perfect accompaniment with your drink.

This place is almost next to my home.
When I first moved into this locality, Hungree was the first eatery I tried. The First time was mixed bag of feelings.

The Place is with shoddy decor, red plastic chairs that are dirty. Food was just average if not below average.

The second trip with a bigger group made me want to give them negative stars. The unhygienic food, dirty place, rude manager made sure I would never set ¬†foot there again, unless i am starving to death.

Of the 8 plates of food placed in front of us for a group of 6 people, 5 plates had hair in it.

the staff was most casual about the first time we pointed it out. His solution was to throw it away and have the rest of it.
At the end of the 5th hair detection, the manager was most casual when we told her that we would leave. She was most eager to give us our bill. No repentance. We paid the bill in full and left forever.

I would avoid this place till the end of days.

I often order from Hungree.
This restaurant is quite close to my house and provides a good service.
Their quality is quite good & the food is very tasty.
I like all sorts of Chinese items,specially the noodles.
The only thing I dislike is their momo.In momo,they stuff more onions than chicken & therefore it becomes a thick meatball and the softiness of the momo gets missing.
Otherwise this restaurant is too good with such a low price. :)

Dashami...the restaurant is at a stone throw distance...
Ordered 1 Pan fried pork chow
1 mixed chow
1 chilli chickn
1 drums of heaven
...
We were 4...just wanted to hv light stuff...ordered at 8. They said it will be delivered within 30mins...after 30mins they said 20 more mins...delivery boy took the rest to deliver at stone throw distance...and was delivered after 1.5 hours. Too late so 2 left we tried to cancel. We were 3 frnds one was a thin one so....
.This outlet is not crowded or burdened with home deliveries.
It was Wings of heaven...not drums of heaven...but tasted good.
Pork pan fried chow...fair but noodles burnt and salty gravy!!
Mixed chow tasteless...yukk...
Chilli chicken...salty!!!

Ordered from Hungree today as I was a little hungry this afternoon. Never really saw this restaurant, so cannot tell about its location. Just felt like ordering from here while randomly browsing Zomato.

The food was fine, Chicken Hakka Noodles was good. Chicken Pepper Salt was quite professional and Sweet n Sour Chicken was also good. Since it was my first order, I only ordered basic items but can safely say that they really know how to make good Chinese food. They have quite a detailed menu with lots of professional items that are not expected from every third Chinese restaurant. They also serve Fish, Prawn and Pork items as stated in their menu.

Prices are really cheap and quantity is above average. Home delivery service is really fast but packing could have been better as they delivered smashed boxes with oil leaking out. The gravy was protected in a tight container though.

So basically, not a bad idea to try out some Chinese food from Hungree when you are really hungree.

remember the good(debatable) old days when a restaurant preparation meant throwing chunks of meat into a pan full of oil,and then dousing them in chilli sauce and tomato sauce? it's not that old of an era either..just a decade ago.nowadays we look for varieties..mediterranean,continental,thai,italian and the most boisterous of today..lebanese! with those quaint¬† indo-chinese joints,we just jeer at ourselves even if we ourselves ordered from them in the first place. Hungree used to be in bosepukur if i remember correctly,and now has shifted to new ballygunge with a veritable question mark added to its anxiety over existence,or so i deduced, it being renamed hungree? while most of these joints thrived on reducing the complexities of modern day fine dining to simple catch phrases sauteed--"sauced--spiced", hungree used to have a note of difference.but that since has transformed¬† into an jingoistic propaganda of diffidence and self-inflicted derision.its now a shell of its former shelf,a deplorable state of gastronomy.I ordered few of my favourites from last decade.spring chicken,chicken pakora,hungree special hakka chow,chicken in oyster sauce.the first two were simply the most disappointing event since nostadumas' failed doomsday prediction of 2012.better,lets shred down the disappointment level to rafael nadal's absence from US open this year with his archrival "nole"ovic¬† licking paws over cincinati and toronto..it meant rafa had his path steered clear,and failed to show up. well.look,i realise this review is much less about hungree? than its about the days of yore,nostradumas,nadal or even the question mark in the restaurant's name;but with such food,i probably can't do more.safe to say,i will order those pakoras and spring chcken when i plan to get sloshed at my place,in a hope to get a kick start back to consciousness. but you can order the noodles and the chicken main course.they won't give you aneurysm,and that's why i gave them¬† 3. the noodles had a flair of rice noodles with¬† plenty of chicken and shrimp,and the oyster sauce chicken was decent enough.sadly,i started with the starters.!

oh,and the price chart has been revised,so both the starters cost 140 ,and the chicken oyster sauce cost 160(against what's given here as of 3rd sept'14).
merry dining!

an absolutely unhygienic place to eat! what i understand when i come to hungree is, it has some fixed set of customers who are pretty regular. they dont really care about other things much. the food is pretty average and tastes as good as roadside chinese joints. 
Cost for 2 in my case: 450 approx.

Nice take out joint. today First time we tried this joint and believe me or not it will really make your taste bud overwhelmed.
Its been a rainy day and thought of trying out a new one. called them up for pickup.
We tried though Chili Pork and Roasted pork. Both are really quite good only complaint the pork should have been little tender and the chili pork should have been little milder. But that  does not spoil the tastes. 
The location is bit off route but who cares for good food :)

Hungree is my go to place for any takeout occasion. A party, a small dinner, even when for little food cravings. 
The food here is always top notch, never ever disappoints! And if you are confused about what to order you are always provided with the best advice!  To top it all off, it is very easy on the pocket!

My favorites here are: 
The chicken lollipop/drumsticks-- succulent pieces of well seasoned and cooked chicken that will always make your day!

Red Pepper chicken as a starter had always been my craving speciality! No one makes them like Hungree! 

Chicken in Oyster Sauce is a Must try! It is the perfect side to any of their accompaniments. 

A standing favorite has always been their Hot Garlic chicken! 

Kim chi kai -- another beautifully cooked dish 

If you are a pork lover,  please try their roasted pork! It's cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth! 

In other words, if you are looking to order Chinese and do not want to move outside the house, look no further!  Hungree provides restaurant quality food at your door step and trust me, you'll be calling them back for more!

Having sampled all their dishes (Yes, every single one), I can guarantee a wonderful meal. 

Bon App√®tit!

This is the same Hungree with a new location. It's adjacent to the New balygunj state bank just 2 minutes away from the previous location. The food is absolutely delicious and I thoroughly recommend it. 
Do try their garlic chow and momos! The chicken in oyster sauce is my favorite :)
A must-try place. You'll come back for more!
