Recently visited the place near kalighat area. The cafe is pretty small, however the decor of the cafe is an eye catcher. The owner's taste of music was excellent. We ordered pork bhuni pao, pasta in red sauce and chicken crisp burger. The pork bhuni pao has become a favourite since this day.

Visited this Odd little place hidden away in a street corner under a fading board. small but cozy cafe. Climb up the very steep metal staircase and enter into the room(be careful not to bang your head against the doorway) and be amazed... Tried the Buffalo wings and butterbeer. Rightly said on the menu: HP wishes he had tasted our butterbeer. Very friendly owner and wonderful food. Though the munu looked promising they didnt have fish and lamb.

Woodstock 1969 promised 3 days of peace and music, the place has similar ambience and very different footfall. The great taste in the owner's music sense is something to look forward to. Ordered BBQ sandwich,Corn Cheese Ramen, Strawberry Coke and none other than Butter Beer. Food tastes great , service is good. Interior is cosy and has a touch of Woodstock all over! Only thing mismatched was attendance at Bethel and the crowd at Greek Church Row.
Food - 4.8/5.0
Service - 4.5/5.0
Interiors- 4.5/5.0

The place is small. Foods are average . Service is slow. The place is known for its butter bear which was nice. Improvement is needed in the maintenance.

If you are looking for a place to smother your appetite with classic delicacies along with some good old rock and roll ambience, Woodstock is where you should be. This place probably has the best burgers I have had in Kolkata, tenderly cooked patties and soft buns will give you a foodgasm that you will remember for a very long time.
P.S - Harry Potter fans will have a “magical” experience here. Try it yourself.

This is a real hidden gem-- comforting food, cosy & relaxed environment and a haven for Harry Potter fans. My friend and I wanted a quite Christmas afternoon get together and settled for this place . We ordered their Butter beer ( sans alcohol) and Bolognese pork pasta. The pasta was a bit spicy but good and butter beer ok. For the butter beer , I think the price was a bit on the higher side. The management was courteous. However it would have been helpful if they had washroom and accepted cards, as a payment mode. I think I will go back , maybe for their live music on Sunday evenings.

A small and unique cafe in the Kalighat area. I ordered the pasta Bolognese in white sauce with smoked bacon. It's one of the tastiest pasta I've had in a long time! And also had a bacon chocolate shake. I mean bacon is heavenly, and so is chocolate. So why not fuse them, right? A must have!
Now let's talk about the interior. At first you might think it's a shady joint of some sort, because it's so small and dingy looking. Then you'll notice all the Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix references. There's a place upstairs : the stair is a very narrow and steep metallic one, and the 'place' is basically a small attic. The ceiling is covered with pages from Batman comics (cleverly hiding the ugly metal beams in the roof). And then there is a shrine containing the iron throne, Star Wars memorabilia, bad piggy etc. Numerous reference to metal music (since it's Woodstock after all). At this point, the pop culture reference got a little tiresome and seemed like they're trying too hard!
The staff was friendly. My only gripe would be that they don't accept card!

Totally disappointed.

After hearing a lot from husband decided to visit. They have recently renovated the interiors & I don't like it. The ground floor seating mainly consist of desks & stools. Only way to access first floor is through a steep ladder kind of staircase so preferred to seat at the ground floor. It was really uncomfortable seating.

Now coming to the food. We ordered one butter beer, one chocolate shake, jamaican chicken wings, chicken tikka sandwich & crispy chicken. Butter beer was really good & the shake was ok. We insisted not to add any extra ice as I had a soar throat, they listened. So really appreciate that.

Jamaican wings were flavour full. The wings were quite sticky. There was not tissue paper holder on table. When we asked for tissues they gave just one tissue. Seriously guys? Are you trying to save money by saving tissue papers?

Chicken tikka sandwich tasted really good with smoky flavour. But the chicken was a little hard. However, the accompanying potato wedges were extraordinary. Overall this is the best dish among all we have tried. My suggestion will be that you cut the square sandwich into two triangular part for ease of holding. Otherwise the stuffing keeps falling out while eating.

Next we had the crispy chicken. It was worst of all. Absolutely no flavour. Even lacked basic salt paper. There was nothing crispy about it, only oil dripping shredded chicken.

And finally the bill. It was hand written. They charged us GST but didn't have the GST number printed or written on bill. Upon enquiring they written it on the bill. And cards were not accepted, only cash or paytm. Now a days if any restaurant is not accepting card they generally inform their customer in advance.

Overall what I felt is this place lacks professionalism & consistency. Small things make a big difference which needs to be taken care of. Just for an example, the torn menu card. It just gives you a bad vibe. Afterall it is not a roadside dhaba. Service was really slow.

At the end the owner do come & ask us about the experience. But honestly we were so disappointed, we wanted to leave ASAP rather than explaing this whole thing.

It a small place with pretty good food. We ordered the following:
1. Pork Bhuni Pao: It is a new dish and tastes amazing. A must try. 
2. Masala Pork Wrap: The wrap is pretty good. Order it or dine in and eat it when you are hungry because one such wrap will be enough to satisfy your hungerpangs. 
3. BBQ Bacon Burger: This dish was a disappointment. The burger was dry and didn't taste good. 
A good joint for college goers and you can play pool as well. The pool table rents aren't very high. 
Had the price been a little less it would have been ideal for the college goers.

A tad difficult to locate, along the Greek church row. 
A very small place , with only 4 tables or so. 
Their service is slow too. 
We ordered barbecue chicken wings, which were sweet and sticky quite the opposite of what we expected; the chicken and paneer wraps tasted about average, while the nutella ice cream pan cakes tasted good. The butterbeer here lives up to its name.

I had visited this place in December of last year with few of my friends. The lane leading to this place is between the Church and the Tram depot. The ambience of the place is nice with good music being played. We had ordered Butter Beer (5 glasses), Crispy Chicken (1 plate), and Potato Cheese Balls (1 plate). The food was delicious, and the service was good as well. However, the place is not spacious. And maybe, the Butter Beer was a bit more expensive than it should have been. But anyway, the experience was good. It's a decent place to hang out with friends.

Not an ardent reviewer of eateries in zomato, but this place surely swept me off my feet, such a hidden gem really! Just to laze around a little on a Sunday evening, me and my friend thought of visiting this place as this was coming in nearby suggestion. When we entered we found a very small place having maximum accommodation capacity of 4 to 5 people, so when they asked whether we would like to go upstairs or not we didn't think twice. Slightly more spacious but the place's quirkiness in it's decor and ambience instantly cheered us up and probably the first cafe where we clicked quite a many photographs (yes, such instagrammable this place is). Coming to the food, we ordered for Hot caramel, Oreo shake, monster meat burger and a Pao bhuni pork. All the dishes were super delicious having not an inch (read pinch of salt/sugar/spice) go wrong. Highly recommendable, go visit at least once and thank me later ,:-)

A reminder of old rock and pop cultures,with a touch old school antiques and furniture.Which all together go really well with atmosphere and adds an old school vibe to your dinning experience.I would recommend you to try out the chicken wings section on their menu, which I found to be outsanding and orgasmic reminding of the fact the other preparations were made with surreal taste and flavour.I would recommend anyone to go and dine out here and im sure you will be licking through the plate.👍

This place is behind the kalighat tram depot & a bit tricky to locate. On a sunday evening when we finally reached this place it was already full & we were asked to wait. After some waiting we were provided two stools with one small table. It was a dimly lit space & there isn't much to describe. It's like a garrage space where there were 6/7 stools set up. On entering we discovered some old friends were jamming there & as it was a very small place among their jamming-talking it was very uncomfortable & embarrassing for us to continue to eat. This is more like a para cafe where there are frequenters & college going buds would be more comfortable here. The food was very good both in taste & prices! Won't visit again!

The place is small but comforting... Almost around 10 seats...
Ambience is cozy comforting.. Staffs are good.. service is good...
As for the food we asked them for suggestion for spice side dishes and as they suggested

1ST Virgin mojito --- which was our take and its ok at its best....

2ND Buffalo chicken wings --- Their take and it was pretty good and spicy, and afterwards we wanted more, it is a well done dish...

3RD Spaghetti in minced pork sausage marinara --- which was the best dish of this day suggested by them ofcourse, the taste of those pork is amazing..

And 4TH Ice cream with chocolate sauce --- which was just ordinary nothing new...

Overall the will visit again for those pork dishes...

Amazing place with really great food options. We tried an array of food items, ranging from spaghetti to wraps and tried a few coolers which were exotic and amazing to say the least! I had never had them anywhere before! The owner had come to know from our facebook post, that we were going to bid a friend farewell, before he left for his PhD in USA. Hence he offered us a complimentary mudcake. It was not my first visit there, and shall definitely not be my last. An amazing quaint place to explore for the young and the old!

We went there checking it's 4 star rating in Zomato...
On entering, we were a bit uncomfortable with it's shady appearance as well as it's location which isn't that good.But the waiters were very courteous & helped us out to get rid off the eeriness.Service was decently quick
The seating arrangement was actually stools and short tables which weren't very easy to sit on.Then we decided to order -

1)Nachos with dip - They were pretty different from the normal Nachos.Hot,extremely delicious & really a joy.Served with Salsa dip(spicy), they really were Nachos with a twist !!(4.5/5)

2)Teriyaki Chicken Wings - Painted with delicious honey and barbeque-like sauces, it was just too delicious.A MUST TRY I must say.(5/5)

3)Penne with Cream & Cheese(added Chicken) - Again was different from the normal pastas, decently tasty(4/5)

4)Butter Beer - Definitely is their speciality !! No words to express how delightful it is. JUST DON'T MISS THIS !!

Overall, the ambience is a bit shady but then if you're a food lover like me, do give it a try !! :)

Had visited this place with dear friends. 
Had been invited by the owner who also happens to be a college senior. 

Really nice place.  Different decor. 
And cozy!! The paintings and posters on the walls are unique. 

Loved the fact that the owner made the dishes for us himself. 

Will visit again. Surely!! 

Great work Senior!!

We went there checking it's 4 star rating in Zomato...
On entering, we were a bit uncomfortable with it's shady appearance as well as it's location which isn't that good.But the waiters were very courteous & helped us out to get rid off the eeriness.Service was decently quick
The seating arrangement was actually stools and short tables which weren't very easy to sit on.Then we decided to order -

1)Nachos with dip - They were pretty different from the normal Nachos.Hot,extremely delicious & really a joy.Served with Salsa dip(spicy), they really were Nachos with a twist !!(4.5/5)

2)Teriyaki Chicken Wings - Painted with delicious honey and barbeque-like sauces, it was just too delicious.A MUST TRY I must say.(5/5)

3)Penne with Cream & Cheese(added Chicken) - Again was different from the normal pastas, decently tasty(4/5)

4)Butter Beer - Definitely is their speciality !! No words to express how delightful it is. JUST DON'T MISS THIS !!

Overall, the ambience is a bit shady but then if you're a food lover like me, do give it a try !! :)

Visited this place twice and love the WRAPS and not to forget if you are a potter-head BUTTERBEARS are there,not only the name will soothe your soul but also the taste of that. I love the cozy ambience too :)

This is a pretty late review. 
Had visited this place with dear friends. 
Had been invited by the owner who also happens to be a college senior. 

Really nice place.  Different decor. 
And cozy!! The paintings and posters on the walls are unique. 

Loved the fact that the owner made the dishes for us himself. 

Will visit again. Surely!! 

Great work Senior!!

This place is different from others cause it's enable us to fall in love with Harry Potter's butter beer drink.The interior is really small.But the lighting is different from all other cafes.I enjoyed being here. Butter beer is all one need to uplift one's mood.

This place is small, little and cute.
Their biggest advantage is their ambience, it's organised yet 70s look makes it worthwhile.

Cons, didn't find any.
chairs are small, does that count? 🤣

Their food is great to be honest.
They have a variety of coolers, filter coffee is great indeed.

I love their buffalo chicken wings.
Spaghetti was great as well.

The service is good.

This proved to be a surprise revelation for us; discovered it on Zomato and went to sample the food earlier this year. It is located on the lane leading to Women’s Christian College near the Greek Church at Kalighat Tram Depot. The interior is themed on pop-culture; there are paintings and quirky one-liners from the Harry Potter series; also posters of icons from the world of western music. The furniture impressed me with its ideas of improvisation, viz. iron-trunks utilized as centre-tables. We originally wanted to order Jamaican chicken wings, but were informed that it was unavailable. So we settled for Chicken Barbeque wings; they were savoury.  Next was the Crab Butter Fish Wrap....the crab sticks were melt-in-the-mouth good :D We ended our evening on a sweet-salty note: the dessert being Chocolate Excess with Grilled Bacon. Once again, it was extremely yummilicious....I hope they maintain their high standard in the future as well.

Firstly This Cafe was in my list from a couple of  months and I made my mind to visit their outlet yesterday with my friend. Situated in the street just beside the Women's Christian College inside the Church Lane Road just opposite to the Kalighat Temple Main Entrance on the Main Road, This Outlet is actually a very small and little cafeteria that you can spend some time in it. The Exterior is ordinary but the Interiors are an absoloute retrofitted old school decors that suits up the ambience with some light background music that plays on. The only dissatisfactory thing is that it is extremely limited and small in place with a small room for Pool Play just above the ground floor. Though its Airconditioned but the seating arrangements were not satisfactory. The Staffs were courteous enough to welcome us with chilled water and we were keen to look at their variety of options available in their Menu. Apart from their Signature Dishes, I chose to opt for a Lemon Tea, Crispy Fried Baby Corn and Spiced Chocolate Warmer for my Friend. Quite a long after came the Tea and the  Fried Corn. Then came the Spiced Chocolate Warmer. As expected and heard from others, Their Food is what actually they are famous for in their area. The Crispy Fried Baby Corn was amazingly delicious and to my hunger and satisfaction, I ordered an extra two plates again out of which one plate I parcelled it for my home. The lemon was lickably perfect and tongue vitalizing. The chocolate warmer could have much better as told by my friend. Coming to the billing point, I informed them that I will be paying via Paytm as They irritably don't accept card payments but they did not inform that their Paytm Limits have reached and hence I forcefully have to pay in cash. Unnecessarily due to their fault, a little bit harrasment as I have to walk to the ATM towards Hazra and then I came again and made the payment with surprisingly 118 rupees GST Charge as extra. Also notably, They parcelled me the food but did not even gave me a plastic spoon with it. So ridiculous management. Sorry for the inconvenience was their Stupid Excuse. Believe Me.. Had They Food not been upto the Mark or Satisfactory, I would have simply exposes their mismanagement that made me give such poor rating to them..!!

Woodstock 1969! A tiny cafe located near kalighat. Yeah there is a space crunch . They are able to accommodate 10-12 heads at a time but that actually doesn't matter when the food will be served in front of you!! Moreover the walls ,textures , picture frames are just splendid (being a big rock n roll ,hard rock ,metal head  i do like these a lot) ! There's an separate room for playing pool! 
Now let's come to the food review!
"AMAZING" !!!!!
I have already visited around 5-6 times till date and have tasted a lot of foods. 
Pork-bhuni-pao ,Chicken buffalo wings, creamy cheesy pasta,pork wrap,spaghetti (probably it was spaghetti in broccoli) ,Sandwiches, virgin mojito,vanilla ice cream with excess chocolate and bacon( the best desert of Woodstock 1969)! 
Each of the dishes  was equally good in taste and had a decent tariff. 
Last but not the least , the playlist! ❤️ 
Everyone over there is very hospitable,friendly.
Cheers for Woodstock 1969!

To be very honest we had quite a high expectation from this cafe.
Located near the church, just opposite to the kalighat kali temple, is this tiny cafe..
Firstly, the location is quite tricky and the lane is mostly desserted with a shop next to it.

Now, as we entered the cafe, it was empty. Only the owners were sitting, playing games and gossiping among themselves..
Firstly, the place is shabby with minimum decor and funky walls.
Now coming to the food. We ordered their usp drink which is the BUTTERBEER, DIAVOLO CHICKEN WINGS AND SPAGETTI IN BROCCOLI AND CHICKEN ALFREDO..
Well, the butterbeer was good. Though it came in a beer glass, it was quite light and not that filling as i thought it to be.
Loved the unique flavour, all my vanilla shake lover foodies are definitely gonna like this drink. It was tasty but nothing extraordinary..
Now coming to the wings.

Just loved the spicy and tanginess of the wings.. It was really hot, but the tanginess balanced it out so well.
Well, the spagetti was average. Not that good atall. It was a bowl of spagetti in white sauce, with just a few pieces of broccoli and chicken. Taste wise it was extremely average.
Now, though the food was good over here. There were quite some cons of this place.
1) Firstly, the dishes are quite pricey as per the quantity they serve. The butterbeer was ordinary and not tht good in quantity as per the price. Same went with the wings and spagetti.
2) The place is very small and can be claustrophobic at time.
3) There was noone to ask us for anythng, the owners were busy playing and gossiping..
4) No tissue papers on the table and we had to ask twice for it and lastly
5) There is no washroom. And when we asked for it, there was a guy in the store who told us about a PAY AND USE toilet beside it.
Overall, had an average experience though the food was good.
Not sure of a next visit.

This cafe is situated in a small lane just opposite to kalighat metro station.Entering for the first time it is just a small room of a house turned into an old cafe.Good place for the localites to hang out in the evening.Small stools ,books and cute little pictues make up the decor with barely 10seats.But the food makes up for it.We ordered :

1.Oreo shake
2.Basil Mojito
3.Masala pork Wrap
4.creamy chicken sandwich
5.Mutton cutlet

The shake was thick with crushed oreo,the basil mojito was okay ...I have had better.The masala pork wrap was the star of the evening...minced pork stuffed in tortilla wrap served with garlic fries.Thoigh the fries were missing that crunch still the pork mince was too creamy an spicy.The mutton cutlet on the other hand was too dry and the outer coating of cornflakes were overcooked.Next came the creamy chicken sandwich which was average .The fries served as a side were more crunchier than tha last one.The staff is hospitable and kept an eye on orders.

Overall worth a visit on a rainy evening for gossip over  a cup of coffee and home food.

I was really delighted to visit this place !!The ambience was nice . It's a nice place to hangout with your friends but please think before ordering as the prices are a bit higher.We ordered butterbeer and hot chocolate both of which were delicious..Among the crispy chicken burger and barbeque chicken wrap , I found the second one more tasty. Although the place is really very small but I should appreciate the person who decorated the place!

Kolkata's got little cafes in every nook & corner carved out of garages or small houses. Such can be said about woodstock 1969 which strikes out a rock & roll theme. Any rock lover would absolutely love this place due to the theme & rock music playing continuously in the background.

The cafe is located inside a small path between the greek church & tram depot. The place is tiny with 3 small tables being present for diners. There menu has got lots of variety per section which gives the oppurtunity to try a new version of a regular dish. Anyways after going through the menu, we ordered the following:-

1. Butter beer - The usp of this place. The only place in kolkata to serve this(as far as i'm informed). Those who are unaware of how it tastes then let me inform you that its tastes like butterscotch milkshake with mixture of cola float. The drink was made with butterscotch ice cream,fizzed cola along with chocolate syrup!! The taste was marvellous though with not being too dense & you will like it if you love butterscotch!!

2. Diavolo chicken wings - We wanted to try super spicy wings out of like 20 varieties of chicken wings. As suggested by the owner/manager we took this one & he even made this boneless instead of boned version at the same price. This was truly spicy for our tastebuds!! The flavour & spices were of chettinad. The presence of pickles gave a kick of sour to balance the hotness. Again a very likeable dish!!

3. Crispy fried chicken burger - This was taken by our friend. A medium sized bun with crispy chicken patty served along with garlic & herb tossed wedges!!

4. San francisco chicken burger - Fluffy burger with the presence of crumb fried chicken bits with cheese in between. Again wedges were served with this one as well!!

5. Buffalo styled chicken burger - This is a spicy burger. The patty itself was larger than the buns which resulted in a clumsy presentation of the dish. The patty was crumbly in nature due to which it got messy in the end to finish!! The taste was superb though,spicy & very flavourful.

The pocket pinch is moderate with each of us dishing out 500 per head. The place charges separate GST. The service was moderate!! Overall had a very satisfying experience!!

A small joint besides the church in Kalighat. The place has some quirky decor with music playing. Ordered BBQ Bacon burger, chocolate shake, spaghetti, nd a pork wrap. Though the food tasted good, the service was painfully slow. Had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food and with repeated reminders.

Hidden gem indeed. 
I'll start off with the negatives. A cafe needs a washroom. Management, please have that arranged. It is almost a necessity. 
When I walked in, I was greeted by this Bengali song in afamiliar tune and I kind of liked the place. Cosy and small. Three tables and the beauty of the place or the luck i had was that people knew basic table manners and kept their volumes low. 
The sizes are sumptuous although the preparation time could be hastened. The spices are perfect and the shakes are thick as you'd want them. The gentleman attendingn us deserves a mention. 
If you're around Rash Behari and in need of a cafe, find this place. Wouldn't regret it.

We decided to spend the afternoon at this cafe. As per our expectations, it did not disappoint us. The cafe is nicely decorated. Actually it was an unused verandah of a old house, which is decorated and colored. Almost everything in this cafe is recycled goods like the tables are old trunk boxes etc. It feels good to see this type of start ups in the city of Kolkata by youngsters like us. Coming to the dishes- we ordered legendary old calcuttan dish Fowl Cutlet. It was served with mayonese and sauce. Its taste was so nice that my tongue still feels its taste. A must try for all food lovers. Then we ordered Spaghetti in Minced Pork Sausage Marinara. It was also very delicious. Then as a dessert we ordered Gondhoraj Lime Gelato, a brand new dessert item which I think is their special item. Three scoops of vanilla ice cream were served with frozen lemon juice and grated Gondhoraj leaves. A taste of sourness with ice cream make a brand new taste in your tongue. Its a must try for all foodies who loves to have sour as well as ice cream. Lastly, we can say that it is a very nice cafe with tasty foods and we spent a very good anniversary eve. Eagerly waiting to visit again.

Located on the lane between the Greek Church and Kalighat Tram Depot, Woodstock 1969 is a small joint that serves good and yummy foods. The decor of the place is good with wooden chairs and iron trunk as table. Potterheads will find solace in this place, as many things here have a direct relation to Harry Potter. I had been into this joint for 2/3 times and tasted few items and really it tastes good with economic rate and good quantity. Ordered   chicken wings which were brilliantly seasoned and virgin mojito as refresher.....had experienced chocolate shake and classic chicken sandwich too very impressive in taste. Though the AC wasn't working well and at full strength this place might accommodate 10-12 people at max, space is too small.

1) If you love music and you know what woodstock is all about, I think you should not waste time reading this, go over to this amazing food joint right away. The place is really cozy at the cost of awesome music and beautiful lighting. They have portraits up for sale, so do indulge in the delicacy of finding the portraits of Kinks, Pink Floyd, etc2) Time is a big issue, so be ready to visit this place in peak hours otherwise the place is closed.3) I tried out Maple Bacon Chicken Wings along with Lat me Kai. Full marks for the food, amazingly made and absolutely delicious. Do try out Fruity Black Coffee if you are trying out this place for the first time.

This tiny cafe is located in the lane right next to the tram depot , opposite Kalighat Kali Mandir Main entrance ! The space inside is very small, but the ambiance sort of makes up for the lack of space , for a cafe as tiny as this . The tables are trunks where your grandmother would keep her clothes in her younger days , and they are surrounded by little stools . A wooden mirror is decorated with toony lights , and the walls are decorated with quirky posters and graphiti that takes you to the 60s and 70s of Rock !! The service here is not slow , not very fast either . They have to be asked to provide tissue papers, or your table might not have any. The food, however , is worth every buck, and the menu is quite unusual ! The Jamaican Chicken Wings have a dominantly sweet and spicy base , with a gravy that includes onions and cinnamon, and pieces of chicken with bones that are served piping hot. The Bacon Wrapped Mexican Hot Dog looks gorgeous , and has soft bread wrapping slices of slippery Bacon that melts in your mouth. The Butterbeer tastes like a frothy Butterscotch float , with a cream base and just enough sweetness to make you happy on a summer evening ! The Basil Mojito tastes great too, and is perfect for the Kolkata weather !! The music is a mix of popular rock tracks that don't smother your conversation with their loudness . Overall , a nice place that is a must visit for its unique menu and quirky interiors !

Easy to locate. A small place close to Greel orthodox church. Even though this place is really very compact and small it has well decorated interiors. The staff and owners are friendly and service is good. We ordered a cottage cheese grilled sandwich along with a vanilla shake and homemade brownie bowl. All were good .

Located behind the Greek Church Row, Kalighat tram Depot , this is a very small homely cafe. But don't judge this cafe by its appearance, this is a real food gem. We ordered honey BBQ chicken wings.. With less honey off course and it tasted brilliant. Spicy hot chocolate and iced tea were good too. What stood out was their burgers served with sauted potato wedges. Both lamb and cheese chicken burgers were good in taste. The Patty was well cooked. ( bit more onion pieces to our liking). Overall a good place. Though the AC wasn't working well and at full strength this place might accommodate 10-12 people at max. Give it a try for some finger foods at a reasonable price.

One can get easily intimated after entering this joint, even we did. Even it doesn't look like a cafe from outside 😛 but as the proverb goes " don't judge a book by its cover ", your perspective will be completely changed once the food is served. Accomodating nearly 8-10 people, this cafe suffers from space crunch no doubt, but this has not stopped them from serving some great food and shakes. Ordered one chocolate shake, sonpapdi shake and one plate of chicken fingers. Definitely, the sonpapdi shake is mind-blowing. Such innovative culinary tactics definitely light up your mood. The chicken fingers were also tasty, and so was the chocolate shake. Had a wonderful experience. 😊 located adjacent to Women's Christian College in kalighat in a lane just beside kalighat tram depot. This place is absolutely recommended .

Dropped in this Sunday afternoon. I had bookmarked this place long ago by looking at the ratings in zomato. From outside it seemed as if there was some electricity problem because there was almost no artificial light. The cafe itself is too small and when I say that I mean real congested. The sitting arrangement was too low. Tiny low seats with equally low tables.
We ordered virgin mojito and Nutella and peanut butter shake. They were fair. 
I didn't like the ambience of the cafe much as it was a little weird according to me. Truly disappointed.

Nice small place to hangout. The ambience is cool , and it has pictures all over the wall of different singers and bands , though it can accommodate max of 10-12 people.
Now coming to food
We ordered iced tea, Virgin mojito, cream chicken sandwich,garlic chicken wings.
Except the iced tea, all the other items were good in taste.
They do not take extra taxes, so cost was around 600.

Firstly I am a huge potterhead. So when I heard of a place where we can get butter beer in Kolkata I knew that I had to be there. When I arrived in Woodstock I realised that it was a very small place indeed. However the place was nicely decorated with 60s and 70s rock music ,Harry Potter and had a warm feel to it. We started by ordering for butterbeer. Then we ordered for crispy chicken fingers and Penne with cream and cheese. Lastly we had a hot chocolate. There was retro music playing at the backdrop and the playlist was exquisite. We chatted there for hours and therefore it's a great place for a hangout. For all potterheads it's a must visit.

The restaurant is situated at end of the lane beside the Greek Orthdox Church. Ambience is on a darker side with a theme of songs from all the century. Sitting arrangement could have been done better and confortable for visitors other than students. Low stools chairs and tables are closely placed. We had Penne in arrabiata sauce and penne in creme and cheese sauce with chicken chunks. Quantity was good according to price. But chicken chunks were too big for a dish like pasta. It could have been smaller or shredded. Taste was also good. The service was too slow and too hot. Looking forward to try homemade brownie. Rating 3.5
16.04.2017: My second visit and i was mesmerised by the amount of the brownie they serve. And the taste was too good along with chocolate sauce. We also tasted creamy chicken wrap. It was also good just a a bit much cream. But the service is still slow except the fact that they had to shut down because of some gas leakage.

Updated Review on 31st December, 2017 :

This is a relatively compact cafe themed on the retro 60s and 70s era of the western world. I'm updating my review after it's huge revamp and even a small extension upstairs.
The place, after it's lovely revamp has a dedicated nerd section upstairs with easter eggs from Pottermore, Marvel/DC and Game of Thrones communities. Downstairs, there's a lot of changes going on with new decorations and seating arrangements for everyone so overall it's a welcome change.
The Food, as always, is absolutely delicious and hasn't got any changes. The Menu is also pretty much the same. I loved everything that I ate from this place so a huge thumbs up for that. The service from their staff in terms of attendance or service is also commendable. The shakes are one of it's highlights and for me personally, their Hot Chocolate is one of the bests I've had till date.

Must try :- Spaghetti in Classic Alfredo, Cheesy Chicken Burger, Creamy Chicken Sandwich, BBQ Chicken Wings, Hot Chocolate, Chocolate Shake.

Woodstock 1969 is located in the alley adjacent to the Greek Orthodox Church. Their pasta, burgers and wings are scrumptious, with a classic playlist comprising folk and pop-rock numbers from the late sixties in US and Britain. I would also recommend their butter beer, to wash down your meal.

This place can be hard to find - a tiny joint tucked away on an unobtrusive little lane! Enter into cramped but quirky interiors with pictures of rock stars of the yesteryears and a lovely carved mirror on one wall. I came here with my BFF, another fervent foodie. We ordered Diavolo Chicken Wings, warranted to be super spicy, and the penne AOP with smoked ham. For drinks we wanted coffee, but there wasn't any available. Bummer! So I took a kiwi mojito and she took a basil mojito. The former was a burst of fruity sweetness, the latter was more subtle, reminiscent of lime soda.
The food arrived soon, in generous portions. My word, those wings were spicy! But equally were they delicious! I have a weakness for flavour overloads, and this hit the spot! Beautifully crispy, too. The pasta had nice whole chunks of garlic in it, and was generously seasoned with black pepper. And they didn't skimp on the ham, either! We ate every bit, and then decided to share the homemade brownie bowl for dessert. Dear Lord, that was a treat! A large bowl filled to the brim with warm brownie and melted chocolate fudge, topped with Oreo halves. Needless to say, we were left satiated in the best possible way. I have to put in a special word for the service, which was extremely courteous. Overall, apart from the fairly uncomfortable seating and the inexplicable lack of coffee (a beverage that is pretty much a requisite in a cafe), a wonderful place that cannot be missed!

While the ambience is great, with posters on the wall a dream for every music lover, the kocation migjt be a bit tricky for some and the food isnt all that great. The mojitos were either too sweet or too minty, the sandwiches were okay, but the fries were stale. That ruined the entire experience. Overall, okayish place, with tax included prices.

Everytime I see the Zomato order for Woodstock open I have s smile on my face! They make some amazing cutlets,sandwhiches and burgers. My fav is the meaty club sandwhich with the extra grilled bacon! I always ask them to add less mayo to my sandwhich cause' if you're a real meat lover you'd like to  get that zing and taste of the bacon and the chicken without a heap of mayo in it but of course one should go with their own personal preferences. Even the potato wedges they give aling with the sandwhiches are made in an unique way with a twist of herbs in them! I have always ordered online and never been dissapointed with their quality. Look forward to visit the restuarant sometime and meet the owner and compliment him. I 'll be rolled over if his name is also Max Yasgur just like the original owner who owned the woodstock farm iin the U.S.A  ;-)

Me and my hubby have recently developed this interest for trying out new food joints around kolkata and on one such evening we discovered Woodstock 1969.
The cafe has a different look.... The paintings, low height seating arrangements and the dim light makes it a cute cozy joint to hang out with buddy's..... It's great for a casual adda. 
The food we tried included Pork bhuna, buffalo chicken wings(for the ones who love spicy) cheesy chicken wrap and in beverages we went for kiwi cooler and one iced tea.... I would say the quality of the food is very good. The taste is also excellent. 
We were also impressed with the great behaviour of the ppl who were taking care of our orders and we were given good suggestions. 
Don't forget to carry cash with you as they do not have the card arrangements as of now. 

So it's a cool, small food joint with real good food and a perfect place for an evening adda with friends.

Woodstock 1969 - a place that has been on my bucket list for quite a while now.We finally got a chance to visit this place.It is located in a lane just beside the Kalighat Tram Depot.


Honestly speaking, the ambience is not that satisfying.The cafe is not lighted up much and the decor and seating arrangements are also not much attractive.It was a bit disappointing. 


But,the disappointment regarding the ambience was completely pacified by the food 😍.

We ordered - 

▪ Pork Bhuni Pao - This is a special dish of this place and it is simply awesome !! The pork was soft and so damn tasty !! This is highly recommended 😘

▪ Cheesy Creamy Pasta - The quantity of the pasta and cheese was really good and it was worth trying.It was good enough !

▪ Bbq Chicken Wrap - This was also a successful experimentation with the menu . Really loved the quantity of chicken served in the wrap. Good one again!!

▪ Hot Chocolate - Quite satisfactory.But it could have been better .

▪ Butter Beer - Okay so this is the best thing among all that I tried from this place. It gives you the magical feeling of Harry Potter (You must remember butter beer from Harry Potter 😉) .This drink is just out of the world !! I can just go to this place again and again for this drink alone !!

The service was quite good.

In short,loved the place but a little upgrade in the ambience is required.

HORRIBLE! 
 First of all, I must mention, I WILL NEVER EVER VISIT again to Woodstock 1969. Before visiting the place, i found all the reviews here in zomato very good. But surprisingly when I stepped in there, I found something is wrong. Only 2 tables with stools in a bathroom-like small space. No proper place to sit or eat. And then, I realized all the reviews in zomato are made by themselves or their friends may be.

First experience: One girl was giggling with the owner in a corner. Nobody was there to take the order. After a while the girl came and took the order.

Food: I ordered Fruity Black coffee, and Crispy chicken burger. She went inside and closed the door and started making the dishes. 
After waiting half an hour,one guy served me a glass of Cold Drink with piece of lemon and pinch of coffee in it!!! I don't know what is the meaning of 'fruity' to them?!? And why did they put coca cola in the coffee!
Next the guy went out and returned with 2 breads (went to 'buy' breads I believe). Then again he stepped in to the 'forbidden forest' (that was painted in the closed door), and again after waiting another 15mins, he served me the burger finally!!!
And, that was nothing but a chicken fry, with potato and onion smash in the middle of two breads and nothing else, which cost me 189/- !!!

I could rate it A BIG FAT ZERO if there was an option for that. Totally wasted my money, time. A street-side egg-roll stall serves better food than Woodstock 1969.

Went to this place twice. And am already in love with their burgers! 

We tried their cheesy chicken burger and by far ..This is the best one I have had in Calcutta! 

Butterbeer - reminds me of those days when I used to Harry Potter and used to wonder what on earth is special about the drink! Well, Woodstock has finally solved this mystery... It is simply mesmerizing.. all butterscotch lovers should try this drink. 👍

Virgin mojitos and chicken wings were also good. 

Although the items are moderately priced, but I would say that it's a complete VFM... 

Definitely going there again!! 

P.s: we were so busy eating that we forgot to click pics!!

Its located in a lane, very near to the Greek Orthodox Church and Kalighat Tram Depot. Its truly one of the hidden gems of Kolkata. They serve amazing food. Service is homely. The decor is amazing with some great music to enjoy with the food. I went in with my friend yesterday and had an amazing experience. We had ordered one chicken sandwich, the famous porl bhuni pao, lemon soda, strawberry shake and countryside potato wedges. All of them tasted delicious. A must visit!

I visited this place yesterday. I must say I took the right decision. :) Woodstock 1969, it reminds me of some old rock band cafe so yes this place is just too impressive. (Especially for cafe lovers) They are having some classic wall decor with some beautiful dim lights under the wooden table and some intoxicating music which boost your energy easily. Now comes the food section. Well, I haven't ordered much but all I have to say that the chicken nuggets and chicken wings were simply good. The taste and the texture of the food were excellent. Altogether, it was a splendid place to chill out with friends. 

 And yes, I missed out the butterbeer, I'll definitely try next time. Will visit this place soon..:)

Want to spend a good evening with friends...a place to sit and chat..a place to cherish good food..Woodstock..revolutionary indeed..
We ordered pork bhunia pao..this dish is finger licking good..minced meat in that rich gravy was yummilicious..
Next the butter beer...honestly i expected it to be better...a tad bit sweet..but i liked it..
The buffalo chicken wings...well..the wings were too skinny..the spices were not adequately cooked..raw onions and garlic..made it an average one..
The mexican lamb wrap was a win win dish for me...the lamb was well cooked..spicy...and made me drool for more..dish is served with fried potatoes..
Then the italian ground lamb sandwich was a good one...perfectly cooked lamb served with fried potatoes..
Ambience wise pretty cool..but quite heavy on ur pockets...

Starting from the location, very difficult to locate.
Google maps came to our rescue.
The place is very small and they play hindi songs, which is not appealing keeping the decor in mind.
I was very excited to try Butter Beer, much raved on zomato as well.
But it was a complete let down.
Tried penne in cream & cheese sauce pasta and spicy chivken wings.
Both were so good that I'm impelled to give this rating!

This place is perfect until there are more than 6-7 patrons/guests to serve. 
The food is perfect (everything), ambience is great they have the best music, wall arts, posters everything top notch. 

Good clean house/free wala water. (Laughs)

But, they seriously need to relocate for business purposes the place is quite small. What they are offering from that tiny joint is worth the 5.0 rating.

I also guess the owners themselves handle the service at tables, I'm not sure about it though.

Heard a lot of hype about this place so had to visit it. Located at the lane beside the kalighat church makes it easy to hangout at. Moreover, the "butterbeer" also added to the excitement. Along with butterbeer I ordered spaghetti with meatballs. The butterbeer was scrumptious. The pasta tasted good but it was too hot. It literally made me cry. That was the only disappointing part. I am in love with their decor, ambiance and mostly the lights. It's simple, retro yet attractive. Seating arrangements are limited but they are quite beautiful. Surely I am revisiting this place to try the other dishes.
What to have: Butterbeer (Ofcourse)
                         Chocolate and bacon shake (must)
                         Creamy chicken sandwich (too yummy)
P.S. They don't charge extra taxes 😜
I will keep on adding "what to have" for each of my visits.

This place is truly a hidden gem. Located in a quaint old lane beside the Greek Orthodox Church, this is a small restaurant with a very cosy atmosphere. The central idea of this place is good food (at pocket friendly prices) and great music. The first time we went there we had crispy chicken fingers with a very delicious dip,barbeque honey chicken wings , pork bhuni pav, bhojpuri bhurji bhaat with bacon and indian salsa and a crispy cottage cheese burger. We loved each and every dish so much that we vowed to come back for more. The next time we ordered for a red devil pork dog, Vietnamese chicken wings and pasta. Once again, we weren't disappointed. The pork dog was perfectly spicy and they served it with these amazing melt-in-your-mouth potato wedges. The chicken wings were tangy juicy and had a hint of gondhoraj lemon which made all the difference. The past was also good. Overall, its a foodie's paradise. 
P.s. Along with the great food, the warm behaviour of the owners makes the experience even better.

This place is located very near to the Kalighat Metro.
It can accommodate 10-14 people at maximum. 

Ambience - This place is well decorated with dim lights on your table. It has wooden tools for you sit and gorge on your food. However, i felt the sitting space could have been made more comfortable. 

Food - Had Butter Beer, Virgin Mojito, Hot Chocolate, Creamy Chicken Wrap, Crab Wrap, Mexican Lamb Wrap.
Butter beer was something that you MUST try there. It's probably their new innovation. Tastes so good.

Virgin Mojito could have been served in a better way.

Hot Chocolate was satisfactory.

The Wraps were pretty good. Creamy Chicken Wrap be the best of Three.

Service - Service Time was pretty high than expected. While serving wraps, they should provide with some basic cutlery stuffs and serve in a more neat way. 

However, we availed 10% discount today. And the most important fact is This Place is Very Pocket Friendly. Good for student hangouts or with your bae.

Keeo going. :)

Cons : Too small and crampy for comfort specially if u have a big frame

N.B Do try their very own version of butterbeer. Hogsmeade anyone !

Located on the lane between the Greek Orthodox Church and Kalighat Tram Depot, Woodstock 1969 is a small joint that serves great food. The decor of the place is impeccable. Potterheads will find solace in this place, as many things here have a direct relation to Harry Potter. The best part was replacing "no entry" sign as "forbidden forest". We ordered two types of chicken wings: the spicy chicken wings, which were brilliantly seasoned and maple bacon chicken wings, these were just brilliant, the favours of maple syrup, crunchy bacon and perfectly seasoned chicken were bursting in the mouth. We also had virgin mojito, it was refreshing. FYI Woodstock 1969 also serves Butter Beer....yes, the nectar served in Three Broomsticks! Looking forward to another visit soon! Great job Woodstock 1969. Highly recommended.

Dimly lit interior with tiny tables and seats and a mirror on the wall, decorated with lights, that looks akin to a shrine. These are the first things one would notice upon entering this small and a tad difficult to find café. The decorations may feel a bit ominous but the semi-retro and retro music playing in the background along with the man who took our orders and helped us choose our meal certainly weren't.
We ordered a nutella and peanut butter shake, hot chocolate, lemon and garlic chicken wings (because we didn't want something too spicy), crispy chicken burger and a Buffalo style chicken burger.
Now the drinks were great, especially the shake. The lemon garlic chicken was pretty good as was the crispy chicken burger, although a bit uncomfortable because the crispy chicken shreds kept falling out.
What did offend me a little was that the buffalo style burger was pretty darn spicy. Now you would think that after having such an extensive conversation about not wanting spicy food (when we talked about the wings), he would warn against the burger. But he didn't and my experience with it was far from pleasant. People who love spicy food should go straight for it though.
Definitely worth a shot.

Just the opposite lane of kalighat mandir , near Women's Christian college , this pretty joint is tucked below an old house. The ambience is quirky , giving satisfaction to Potterheads. The sitting is very limited , getting in an odd time we could easily manage a place there. We ordered Hawaiian chicken and bacon wrap , Chinese combo ( chicken ) and chocolate excess ! The wrap was really tasty , succulent and there were fries with it which were again delicious. Chinese combo was not like any other Chinese meals , it was different , had an amazing vibrant flavour , a cherish to the taste buds . Finally , chocolate excess , how dreamy it was ! Perfect amount of Oreo , brownie and chocolate sauce , a great end to a wonderful meal. And yes very pocket friendly ! Would love to visit again ! ❤

Located in the lane beside Women's Christian College, near Kalighat Tram Depot, this little cafe is tucked away from the main road. A tad difficult to find but definitely worth it once you do.
The interior is amazingly well decorated and there are new things to look at everytime you go. The walls are covered in music memorabilia of the years that once were ranging from Elvis to The Scorpions and everything in between. It's really a great place for anyone who is still stuck in the era of great music that  once was. This is complimented by the playlist of the owner who plays music you probably won't hear anywhere else anymore.
The food is great and the portions are generous. If you're a Harry Potter fan, definitely try the Butterbeer. It's the closest you'll get to the real thing. 
The barbeque bacon burger is really really good and the chicken wings section which offers you cheesy chicken wings which will take you to food heaven. 
Don't miss out on this great place.

If you want to cut short your budget on your meal then you're at the right place.Indeed this joint is pocket friendly.And as soon as you enter the place you'll get the ambience of a hard rock cafe.Moreover the joint serves the purpose of being named after a music festival which had bands and musicians perform from a diversified genre,I'd just say songs played over here at Woodstock 1969 are exemplary .Posters of the famous bands of the American hall of fame with awesome music makes this place a perfect place to hangout,personally I can spend hours here ! Hospitality is good ,so is the service.The food,the bacon sandwich was splendid and the choclate Oreo shake was delightful although the chicken wrap was average.Cash and Paytm both are accepted here ,that's a relief ! Only thing the management needs to care of is to get rid of the roaches!!

A perfect joint for Hangout. Pocket friendly and good food with adequate quantity. The ambiance is very nice. It's a small eatery with seating arrangement of hardly 12-15 people. The décor is quite peppy. Been there with a friend. He absolutely fell in love with this place as the owner has very good taste in music and offers large burgers as well :p we had ordered the monster meat burger, buffalo chicken wings, butter beer. The chicken wings were huge in size and were perfectly cooked. The butter beer tasted sort of like butterscotch soda with alcohol :p and the burger, well the patty was good but the bun was too much soft that we were not even able to hold it and ended up eating the burger with a fork :D as after failing in the struggle of keeping the bun and patty together. Hope they come up with a perfect burger when we visit this place next time :) All over, a good place to have pocket friendly munch!

Various Cafes have been springing up here and there in our 'City of Joy' but a few hardly leave a lasting impression. 'Woodstock 1969' certainly did leave a lasting impression.

This cafe is lovely located in the lane beside Kalighat Tram Depot. The cafe is designed with pictures of Elvis, Ac/Dc etc and has seating arrangements of maximum 15 people. They have used trunks as makeshift tables. The idea is however quite unique.

We went for 'Cheese Garlic Chicken Wings' first. The food came within ten minutes. The chicken wings were delicious. They were crispy and was covered with ample amount of cheese and chopped garlic. It was delectable dish.

Up next, we went for 'Butterbeer'. Being a Potterhead, this was my first chance to have a 'Butterbeer' just like the trinity who used to have it at 'The Three Broomsticks' run by Madam Rosemerta in the village of Hogsmeade. 'Butterbeer' does not contain alcohol. It is made up of ice-cream, ice-cream soda, butter scotch and butter. The first sip gave me the foamy moustache that the people in the Harry Potter universe used to get. The Butterbeer was delectable. It was a great ending to the evening.

The staff was amiable and courteous. All in all, a great cafe and I will revisit soon. @

A place which I would love to visit over and over again. Being a potterhead my curiosity got the best of me. From the moment I entered, I fell in love with the place.
The whole Hogwarts ambiance is such a treat and not to forget the scrumptious food. 
The butterbeer is another definite try-out. 
And I got sorted into hufflepuff! :)

This review was long due. Visited the place on a lazy winter afternoon. The cafe is a bit hard to locate if you are not familiar with the area. However, I being a nearby resident could locate it pretty easily. We reached the place when the store was not even open for customers. But on seeing me and my friend they opened up. Nice cosy place for an adda session with friends. Being a Harry Potter buff, I just loved the decor and the cosy seating arrangement. Service was prompt and helpful. Tried both the warm and cold butterbeers. Personally, I loved the warm one. You got to try it to believe it. For food we ordered the honey barbeque chicken wings which was too sweet for my taste buds. So next, we ordered the diavolo chicken wings as suggested by the owner/manager. This one is fiery , tangy and everything that my taste buds adore. Definately worth another visit. However, the number of people the cafe can accommodate is very little. Though the cosyness adds to the warmth of the place, I think they should expand the seating capacity.

This cafe is inside the narrow lanes of Hazra just beside the Kalighat Tram Depot. With just 3-4 tables and an area for playing pool, the place doesn't fail to make an impact on the customers. This is another place which provides mix and match food and beverage items like Pork Bhuni Pao, Butterbeer etc. The walls have pictures of legendary band members and quotes from famous songs and band names. My favourite bands are up there which made me feel very happy. I ordered butter beer which tasted like butterscotch shake presented in the form of beer in a beer mug. The other beverages are also good and the food items are very appealing. I would give full marks to the ambience and service and the price as well. But the place could have been a little bigger though it creates a warm and cozy environment. You can play pool with your friends while your food is getting ready. An ideal place to drop in with your pals.

I've been here a lot of times before and was never disappointed with the food (specially the Godzilla sandwich) but never came to review it on Zomato. This time we went for some butterbeer as we had heard of it some time back. The decor was changed a bit with a Harry Potter theme with sign boards and little quotes here and there. I've always liked their otherwise rock and roll posters and playlist. We ordered two warm butterbeers. It tasted like warm cola float with caramel, which I don't mind but the caramel made it a little bitter. Perhaps it was overcooked, I don't know. Anyway looking forward to going there again and having the meat dishes.

Tucked in a bylane in Kalighat(The small lane next to the church) is a cafe called "Woodstock 1969". A perfect place for adda and a perfect hangout. Decorated with posters(which you can order and even customise), the place transforms you to the 90s and early 2000. There is even a pool table.
The menu itself is a blend of the 90s element with a dash of quintessential "bong" taste.
Their specialities are Buffalo wings, fowl cutlet and Gondoraj Gelato.
The Buffalo wings was perfectly flavoured.
The "Gondoraj Gelato" is sure to give you dessert goals.
There were some very interesting dips like chilli chocolate dip, peanut butter dip, which I will try next time.
The owners informed that every month they have events based on several themes, like their butter beer festival was "Hary Potter" themed.
Here is a sneak peak at one of the coolest cafe I have ever visited.

This is one of the places which tells you that opulence has nothing to do with quality service. We had gone to this cosy nook on Christmas Eve for the Butterbeer Festival. My friend and I being Potterheads were over the moon with the delicious butterbeers they served. Green hued butterbeers because we sat under the Slytherin banner and delicious chicken wings aptly named Phoenix wings for the occasion. The ambience was perfect both in terms of aesthetics ( modified for Pottermaniacs for the occasion ) and feel. It is definitely not a huge space but you instantly feel at home. The guys here are extremely friendly and warm. It is cheap on the pocket too though one more visit is required to try other stuff from the menu.

Gist : A rock festival themed small cafe with playing rock music (one of a kind in this city), great decor & music with great food. Bit overpriced though w.r.t. quantity but already created there signature items, hence loyal visitor.

I visited this place on 14.5.16 around 6.00PM. Bit tricky to locate. It is a small cafe with a washroom for singe person inside of it. Decor & music demand a visit from all rock music lover. They definitely know what was Woodstock '69, you are not a rock fan please know about it & visit this place. It can accommodate around 14 people. Staffs are cordial Ordered Mexican Lamb Wrap, Pork Burger, Basil Mojito, Kiwi Mojito. Serving speed can improve a bit, but still good. Though at that price they can add up some quantity. There food having signature taste, so this place requires some more visits to try other items.

A very very small cafe located inside a narrow lane right opposite to the Kalighat temple entrance. The place is small but quirky! It is a Harry Potter themed cafe. Extremely basic interiors but the efforts are quite visible. The seating arrangement is nice. The place was apparently completely booked, hence, we had to opt for chicken wings only as a takeaway option! They do not accept cards but only cash and Paytm.

The recent theme and the associated decor of this cozy cafe provide the happiest flavour of Christmas. Even if you aren't a Potterhead, you are sure to find the best use of a few hours of those lazy winter afternoons here. Evidently, a little more space would have done great to the comfort of customers as well as their business, the cozy atmosphere and the warm owners do more than the usual trick. 
Foods are good, butterbeers are fabulous and firewhiskey (dunno if its gonna be in the menu after the festival) lives upto its name 😄 
Meet the owners, have a chat with them once you are there. These people are the USP of this place. And itsadvisable to bring a small group only 😊

It's a cool partially harry potter themed cafe. It's small but I loved the ambience. Coming to the food, it was much more delicious than I expected, we had the diovlo chicken wings, which was very spicy but delicious, chicken hot dog, pancakes with ice cream and maple syrup. This dessert was too tasty. And the service was good too. Would love to visit again.

Regular customer for their amazing pork bhuni pao which I personally believe is a pure stroke of culinary genius.  One more straight out brilliant thing is the use of gondhoraj lime instead of the conventional lemon in all drinks and desserts.  Big fan of their cheesy chicken wings too.  I'm not a  big critique of space constraints as I believe this is the perfect little shack for musicians.  It's got the right setting, the right ambiance and the right music.

Thank you guys for making me nostalgia with your mind blowing songs...

I liked the ambience n deco of the place by heart... it is simple but still very attractive... though the place is very small but large enough to accommodate people's with good heart... music was very smoothing... Ordered for...

◆ Mexican chilli soda~ Good one... but rather then chilli flakes some chopped chilis or shocked chillis may work more...

◆ Soan papri shake~ This one was insane...

◆ Meaty club sandwich~ Tasted heavenly... the combination of crispy becon, chicken n pouched egg was deadly... also the potato wedges were just wow...

◆ Spicy ranch chicken wings~ Awesome... gone very well with the dip...

We also opted for some take away...

◆ Grilled mutton cutlet~ Fabulous...

◆ Buttered rice with masala pork~ Very good... but expected to be a bit spicy...

◆ Spaghetti with broccoli n chicken in Alfredo~ Excellent... but they missed the mushrooms as extra topping...

The service was very good... but the serving time was bit long... All the guys are very friendly over here... pocket pinch was very very acceptable...

You guys can consider this 4.5 as 5.0 if you can ignore the flaws I had mentioned...

What is it? Paradise. Splendid food and fabulous music. Excellent ambience. What I must mention is why I give it a 5 insatead of 4. 5 is simply because their essence of novelty touches your heart. You see effort ( essentially dedicated kind ) in everything. Right from the decor , to the menu , to the art and the playlist. Such polite people as well. Overwhelmed by the welcoming  warm behaviour. ( Hence, extra credit justified. ) Also , they are open to suggestions and receive it with genuinity which makes them awesome plus. Must add this, the smallness of the place makes it cosy in it's own way. <3 Finally found my ecstasy corner in the city.  ^_^

A small cozy cafe located inside the lane just beside the Greek church - space of an old heritage building turned into a cafe with a lots of vinyl painted faces on the walls and the posters with dimmed lights all around. I love their innovative concepts of using old trunks as cafe table, the painted liquor and coke bottles - a personal touch being reflected at every corner. The Victoria wall clock at the corner will definitely draw the attention of all guests. Coming to food i had the Blue Hawaii as cooler and ordered Godzilla sandwich for take away which tasted delicious with chunks of all types of meats and topped with poached egg. I am thrilled with the taste of their potato wedges served with the sandwich tossed with garlic and dried herbs - felt the same taste of American baked potato wedge during my stay in the West. This cafe lacks a bit of space, hence the seats are bit uncomfortable. Otherwise, they just rock in terms of food, pocket friendly rates and service. They accepts cash only.

simple food, great music, and they have butterbeer, which I thought was clever and very delicious - caramel is definitely a hit with me. I was also pretty happy with the burgers, the spicy and sweet chicken wings, and the dogs - very very good value for money, I have to say. A special mention of the music - they played some of my favourites - I would definitely be going back for more!

The name Woodstock 1969 will immediately strike a chord with any music fan – and it is not unlikely that you may think it is perhaps a trifle pretentious to name a place after the legendary festival. However, "What’s in a name?", and that’s exactly what this place stands out for. Located in a lane near the Greek Orthodox Church, this is a small place set up inside an erstwhile garage by some enthusiastic entrepreneurs, and they indeed do a fabulous job. The place and the seating is a little cramped up, but the ambiance is solid, and takes you back to the humble American country joints who used to sell their décor as an additional means of income. The place is full of posters of iconic rock bands, and each of them is for sale, complete with a price tag. I loved the concept, and the dim lighting, especially around the tables. The hand printed parts of the wall, and the caricatures add to the overall flavor. However, the seating is definitely cramped, and has ample scope of improvement. Well, after the first phase of observation was over, it was time to get down to business, and we ordered a selection of their well-curated items for an evening snack. 

The first to arrive on our table was their signature Pork Bhuni Pav. Coming from the land of pavs, Mumbai, me and my sister suspiciously looked at what seemed another plate of Pav Bhaji - but it took all but one bite for all such inhibitions to go out of the window. Pork mince cooked in typical Indian spices, this was Pav Bhaji of a different class and dimension all together. It took us about 3 minutes to wipe the plate clean, and blimey, was it good! The next item to arrive was the Vietnamese Chicken Wings, along with the Soan Papri Shake and Ginger Ale. The wings were great – loaded with crushed garlic, herbs, and lemon juice – they had a tangy, oriental flavor that was refreshing from the regular variant of wings generally available. The Soan Papri Shake tasted very good (however, no distinct Soan Papri flavor) and you cannot do much wrong with a Ginger Ale, can you? 

Just as we were mopping up the residual jus of the wings, the best dish of the evening arrived on our table. It was an innocuous looking, standard size specimen of the Kolkata Mutton Cutlet, but the effect it had on our taste buds can be compared to a hand grenade. It was simply sublime. The coating was crisp, most probably crushed cornflakes, and the interior was pure mutton mince with flakes of cilantro, onion, and garlic. The taste was better than most mutton cutlets in the city, and that is about as high the praise can get. The same old legend with a twist, and a fabulous job at that! We were almost full by now, but the quality of the food pegged us on to order one last item – the Crab Butter Fish Wrap, and thank God we did! The wrap was one of the most unique I have ever had – loaded with fish bits and some of the tastiest, most flavorsome steamed crab meat pieces that I have tasted. The veggies and mayo in the filling makes it a delightful wrap, and the potato wedges are just incidental, though well made too!

At this point, we were full, but I would not leave without the Gondhoraj Lemon Ice-cream. Just as we placed the order, a special guest, the resident cockroach showed up, which was followed by a brief phase of panic, finally culminating in it getting crushed under one of the owner’s sandals, while I was calmly polishing off the vanilla ice-cream infused with Gondhoraj flavor and rind. I wouldn’t call it excellent, but the quantity was huge, and it was refreshing indeed.

The best part of the experience was when the cockroach-slayer-café-owner did not charge us for the ice-cream in lieu of the insectuous (pardon me) disturbance, and though we insisted otherwise, he insisted on the ice-cream being on the house. It was a wonderful gesture – though I am not fond of cockroaches, but I do understand a stray one appearing in an old house. A small place with a big heart and great attitude – that’s what Woodstock 1969 is. And yes, superb food. Give them some love, folks!

This place is located very near to the Greek Orthodox Church. I found it on zomato's hidden gems collection and it was in my bucketlist for a long time. Finally on a lazy Saturday afternoon after puja shopping we dropped in there. And guys!! You know what?! I just can't restrain myself from going there whenever I'm nearby. 
They make the world's best butter beer. Also the American breakfast platter, English breakfast platter are worth dying for. The pork bhuni pao is also lipsmackingly delicious. In short this hidden gem has got plenty of gemstones in their house. 
Oh yah..! Special mention for those two young musicians who sang so well that evening :-) cheers to team Woodstock!

Went without knowing what to expect and I have to say that the place left me speechless with the quality of food and the cozy, not so officious ambience. We ordered Chicken wings, pasta, fish and chips sandwich and a fish wrap. Each item was better than the previous one. Price-wise too, the place is reasonable to say the least. A must try for a casual foodie.

The USP of this place is the food and the innovation done to it. They have handpicked every recipe and tried to put their take on it, which though is commendable but needs polishing. I liked the decor which is very friendly, homely, arty but they badly need to expand. When you are having good food, you need a relaxed posture at least. 

Coming to the dishes I liked - creamy chicken sandwich, teriyaki hot dog, soan papri shake, gandharaj icecream, but the buffalo wings were just bland in taste. The overall experience was great because of the quality of food offered at such affordable prices. I would say, great going guys! Work on the smaller things and you are all good to go. For me, this place is there to stay and I am going back soon to try out the other dishes.

Woodstock 1969 is located in the Greek Church Row. It is named after the famous Woodstock music festival of 1969. It is a very small place with just four tables which was established inside a Garage. Once, you get inside Woodstock, it is filled with posters and arts full of rock bands and music. Be it posters of Bob Marley, Pink Floyd, Green Day, etc etc. it is filled with them. This place was on my wish list since a long time. However, it is rightly said that don’t judge a book by its cover. Similarly, don’t judge Woodstock just by the seating capacity. Some of their dishes are exemplary. It is a place which was established by three hotel management student who wanted to provide Kolkata with really lipsmacking and distinct food at affordable prices. All of them I met were jolly and they helped us with ordering food as well. The prices of each of the dishes has been kept sensibly keeping in mind the young crowd especially.
                                                                ...

The music was little loud though and the preparation time was little long, but they amazed us with all the food they served.  Shon papri shake and meetha paan shake were  not only innovative but also great to taste. Pork bhuni pao was good to gulp. Try this with a good group

Well, I am probably very late to put in my thoughts as I am a regular woodstock 1969 guy.Somehow, I have become biased about the place. The people here are really humble and the ambiance is extraordinary. The food has it's originality, Pork Bhuni pao being one of the regular orders . I would like to try everything on the menu card with time. Honestly I've had nachos at many places but here it is of a different league. Same goes for the rolls and wraps. Classic rock, rock n roll  and progressive music with food  of this quality is a heavenly feeling. Even the bill comes with a "All hail rock and roll" tag.... I mean what more does a classic rock person need? I think this place brings back the vibe of Calcutta.

While looking for a place to hangout on a weekday, me along with 3 of my friends discovered this cute little heaven at Kalighat. 
Coming to the food... We ordered a spicy hot chocolate and virjin mojito which were awesome, and a lemon tea for me.. 
Recommended by the owner, we tried Godzilla Sandwich. As the name implies, that was meant Godzilla only, till it decided to go extinct. It took two people to finish and it was something extraordinary. Highly recommended. 
The service was good, and the ambience along with music can get you high even without alchohol.

The following is an experience of this place's foods, ambience and services.The entire review is a complete personal opinion of mine.

Ambience: A perfect hard rock cafe. The total decoration of the joint matches perfectly with their name and the tagline.
Though the place is very small in size.

Service: music lovers will be a suitable reference than waiters.Friendly atmosphere.

Food:
1.butterbeer: an unique one. The wizards' drink with a mixture of butterscotch and a mild flavour of beer.

2.masala pork wrap: taste of the masala pork was really awesome. But the masala pork was missing the porkwala thing. I prefer to have pork as shredded or as solid cubes.its completely unrecognizable if one doesnt know that its a pork item.

3.steamed buttered rice with pork masala combo: i dont know if i am right or wrong but they have added some garlic flavour into it(not sure). The butter and the garlic's mixed flavour with pork combo was the showstopper. Too good

Things to note: all prices are inclusive of all taxes.
They accept only cash

To management: please do look into the matter of 'porkwala thing'. :p

If you're a Potterhead, you MUST come here. The reason? Butterbeer!!!!
In the menu you'll see both warm and cold butterbeer. You get the warm one in winter and the cold one in summer. We had the cold one. It's creamy, sweet, thick, gooey with a lovely frothy feeling and caramel in the end. They give you a beer mug full of butterbeer (yaaaayy), and I believe even Snape would've approved of it. Now that's saying something!!!
Service is good with friendly staff. Last week it was closed for renovation. And then they have these cool tables, with light. Enclosing pictures.

And thus, we now have our very own Three Broomsticks in Kolkata ❤ Nilarghya Das

On Panchami night when the entire Kolkata poured into the streets, we were dying to sit down somewhere and talk. And that's when my months of zomato-digging came in handy.
This is a quaint little place in the alley right beside the Greek Orthodox Church in Kalighat.
I absolutely loved their décor! Very boho, very chic, with a classic assortment of Bengali and English music.
There's also a pool ball table upstairs!
Coming to the food: we ordered Hawaiian chicken and bacon wrap and monster meat burger, as was recommended to us. And frankly we weren't planning to have dinner, but we kind of did. The food wasn't super-good, but it definitely was above average. But I absolutely loved the garlic potato wedges they serve with wraps and burgers. Also the owners are very very friendly.
I'm definitely coming back for their bhuna pork pao and butter beer, which we were lul enough to not order on our first visit. :3
Oh. And. And. They don't take taxes. So, yayy!! 😁

My first review, and am lucky that I really found a "hidden gem" of a restaurant. Loved the ambiance. Let me repeat it again, totally lovveed the ambiance. And then there was the food too. They have a lovely spiced up menu. Me and my friend ordered Mexican Chilli Soda and Butter Beer for coolers (deep down in our hearts we too are Potterheads). And then came Buffalo Chicken Wings & Monster Meat Burger. Both were suggested by the restaurant owner and tasted really good. Visit this place without any doubts, you won't be disappointed.

Given the direction, the cafe is not hard to locate. It's a very small cafe with 4 tables and can accommodate somewhat 14-15 people at a time. But the place is decorated very nicely with framed posters and wall paintings. Oh and there's a pretty small fish bowl too adding to the decor. Coming to the food, we ordered crispy chicken burger, lat me kai and black tea with unlimited refill. Our bill was only 464 which is quite affordable. The crispy chicken burger was really tasty! The chicken was indeed crispy, had a proper amount of mayo in it and the complimentary potato wedges were properly fried with spices. It was the first time I tried the dish 'lat me kai' and I won't try it again. It had an excess flavour of gondhoraj lemon. Can't really say if the dish is cooked like this or it's the restaurant's fault. But I didn't like whatever it was. Wanna spend an hour or two gossiping with your friends without having to spend a lot of money? This is your place.

The food is overpriced and not at par. Not the best place to go if you have other options.
They serve something called MOZITO which can permanently damage your tastebuds  so that
next time when you will  have mozito at some other place, you will only get the smell of tulsi leaves from it.
Dont go there.

Unlike what most people think, this place isn't very difficult to locate.
On my first visit to this place, I had the chocolate shake, which was pretty good. We ordered for pasta and the helpful friendly staff suggested the toppings that would cater to our taste buds.
I absolutely love the pork sausages out here
I am going to go back just to have those! :3
The seating arrangement could use a little more work.
The ambience otherwise is pretty Cool.
Would recommend this place to friends
And most definitely coming back for the sausages

This place is quite difficult to locate. Period. We spent a lot of time asking people around and ending up on the wrong streets. Having said that, the place is actually quite well decorated and one could say that it defined coziness. We had ordered pork bhuna pav and a pasta. While the pasta was nothing out of the ordinary, the bhuna pav caught our attention. It was tasty enough to make us crave more of it. They provide around 2 pavs (I think), along with the pork bhuna masala which is nothing but really well cooked keema pork. Lastly, we finished off with desserts. We had ordered one gondhoraj lime gelato and had shared that. The ice cream gave off authentic gondhoroj lime smell and tasted just as much. My recommendation - if you're okay with pork definitely try out the pork bhuna pav. You won't regret it.

This tiny little place can be a bit difficult to find, it is right beside the lane to the Greek Orthodox Church. Once I entered this place, I was like "this is it?? Such a small place!!" We saw a staircase, and enquire did we could sit upstairs. But then the owner told us, that there is no seating arrangement upstairs. But, I loved the tracks they were playing and the frames hung on the wall(I guess they were for sale, as there were price tags written on them). So we settled ourselves to a corner table, and ordered a Butter Beer, Chocolate shake, Black filtered coffee (unlimited servings), potato cheese balls, pasta in cheese sauce with bacon, and buffalo chicken wings.
First came the chocolate shake, it was just like a simple chocolate essence shake, nothing special. The butter beer was too good, had a taste of butterscotch  with the right amount of butter in it. Though it was my first time I had a glass of butter beer, and may be that why I loved it. 
Coming to the food, we didn't like the pasta at all, the salt was more in it, it had a bad taste. 
The potato cheese balls was good, nicely filled with potato and cheese.
The buffalo chicken wings were very delicious, very very spicy. This was the best dish amongst all.
Now, coming to the service, it was a bit slow. There wasn't a big rush, but still they took long to prepare the food and butter beer. 
For all the food and drink, our bill was around 700-800, which was quite reasonable for the amount and quality of food they gave.

In the times where "cute,cosy,tiny" cafés are a growing trend in the city of Joy, Woodstock 1969 manages to hold on to their USP- "Food". Period. Decor, ambiance- take my suggestion, kindly neglect and overlook. Nothing much to speak about. Read couple of reviews where space and the portion sizes of the food seemed to be a concern with many, but boy, when you go to Anadir Cabin/Peter cat/mocAmbo/Paramount/Aminia n etc. ,you go for the food. So let's concentrate on food n there they score a perfect 10👍🏻
We ordered -

Lemon tea- out of the world. So we ordered one more. The chaat masala blend with the citrus flavor of the tea, was gastronomic!!!

Hot Chocolate- The gooey chocolaty mix with the milk was yummilicious! The owners must think about making it one of their signature dishes. 

Pork Bhuni Pao - Spicy, tangy minced pork , exactly the way it's served on the Konkan areas! 

Creamy chicken wrap - my friend wasn't really able to finish the entire thing off as it was huge. The cream and mayonnaise and the chicken balanced the tastebuds to the T. 

Lat me Kai - a Thai preparation with chicken with a tantalizing lime leaf flavor. Recommended. 

Service was quick, owners were courteous and hospitable enough to ask for feedback . 
Prices all inclusive of tax. No extra burdens . Appreciated. 
Undoubtedly recommended. Hidden gem.

We ordered for monster meat burger and steamed buttered rice with masala pork. The burger was good with two patties and bacon which us more than filling (the fries alongside were very bad though). Now coming to the rice with masala pork... A total mood spoiler. Minced pork masala with too much oil.. One cannot figure out what he or she is having... Tasted like i am having only oil and masala with whole garlic pods!! Bad bad bad

The name was enough to attract any foodie who is also a avid music lover.
For of us went to the place after college.It is located near Kalighat Tram Depot,take the lane beside the Greek Church,and you will get the cafe.

Decor-Although the place is really small but quite tastefully decorated.There are posters of different bands framed over the walls,they are also for sale.

Food-
The main reason for our visit was Butterbeer, all four of us being potterheads.
None of us has obviously gone to Orlando studios so it is not comparable to anything we have tasted yet.
But we absolutely fell in love with this drink.

Spicy Chicken Wings-It was deliciously cooked.The chicken wings were juicy and tasty.

BBQ Chicken Wrap- The wrap was perfect,the chicken inside was incredible in terms of taste.

Buffalo style chicken Burger- It was really awesome,it felt so great with those crispy potato fries provided.

Pork Bhuna Pao- This was another showstopper.This fusion was perfect.The Pork Bhuna was incredible,we had to lick our fingers till the end to get over with it.

We came here only to taste the butterbeer but had an delightful experience over food.
They also have a Pool table upstairs,we had real fun playing it and they play some awesome classic Rock music.
Heartfelt thanks to the owners for providing us with such experience.For someone who always dreams of having his very own restaurant in future,this place had been a real inspiration.

Woodstock 1969: The 1st positive thing is the convenient location. Reach Kalighat Tram Depot, take the lane beside the Greek Church, walk for a minute and you will get the cafe.

The cafe might have shortage of space but the owners have used it in the optimum way. 
The decor and theme justify the name of the cafe without overdoing it.
Some might find the low seating arrangements little uncomfortable initially but I assure you once the food arrives, you will totally forget about the discomfort!

We ordered a Lemon Tea, Hot Chocolate, Creamy Chicken Wrap, Lat Me Kai & Pork Bhuni Pao.

A big shout out to the Lemon Tea & Hot Chocolate. Honestly, I've never had a better lemon tea. It was so good that we ordered 1 more. 
The Hot Chocolate too, was just perfect! Gastronomic pleasure in every sip.

The delicious Creamy Chicken Wrap had substantial amount of chicken and the wrap was little crisp. It was melting in the mouth. One creamy chicken wrap is enough to make you almost full.

The Lat Me Kai was little different from what we normally get. Nevertheless it tasted good and we quite liked the distinct flavor. 

Pork Bhuni Pao, as my friend said was unique and she loved it.

Price: Reasonable. No extra burden of taxes. Quantity: Sufficient. 

Totally Recommended!

Located in kalighat , and this place is easy to locate.


The place was small.

The moment you enter and when the music hits your ears and you are greeted with such beautiful band posters, dude  you're in heaven, definitely :D 


I visited this small joint today only with a friend and it was amazing. The staff were good and helpful. and  must they all have good taste for music. 

And the posters , we Didn't notice it was actually for sale so for a moment we got excited, because they literally have good collection. 


We ordered.. 


Steamed butter rice + masala pork combo 

Cold butter beer.


The masala pork was amazing. And will definitely fill your heart with joy. Highly recommended,do try it out . :D 


Cold butter beer was good too. 


I am definitely coming back to this place 

If not for anything , but definitely for the masala pork and music.


Cheers!

Ambience 

The music and the posters are good but the seating arrangement is extremely congested. They need to work a bit more on this!

Service

The owners of this place are in one word, amazing. They treat you courteously and give proper suggestions regarding the choice of food.

Food 

We've been here two times and each and every time we've been duly satiated with the quality of food. We have tried Barbeque Honey Chicken Wings and Jamaican chicken Wings for the starters and both of the dishes were beautifully prepared. Jamaican chicken wings was about a tangy orange flavour that went deep into the pan fried chicken.
We recommend these dishes!

For the main course we've ordered Penne with Vegetables in Alfredo Sauce with chicken chunks and Penne Arrabiata( chicken ) . Penne Arrabiata was a bit on the spicier side whilst Penne Alfredo was just perfect! Recommended!

Beverages 

We have tried four mocktails out here..! So we'll just list them one by one.
1 . Virgin mojito. It was as good as it could be.
2 . Italian Herb Soda (drooling as I write about it) Beautifully flavoured. Must try. 😃
3. Ginger Ale. Have no complaints about this one. 😍
4. Rastafari Mojito. Aesthetically beautiful. A bit on the sweeter side. ( Sprite based, and the flavours are added with the help of fruit crushes.)

Dessert

Chocolate excess with grilled bacon was our choice. A gastronomic delight, without any doubts!  The  ice cream was garnished with chocolate sauce, grilled bacon and oreo chunks; and there was a hot-cold, sweet-salty feel to every bite. 
Recommended!

Our mini visit to this micro sized cafe , located on greek church opp to kalighat entrance. The space surprising was way too small and claustrophobic for us to stay there long , but we ordered a couple of dishes , PORK BHUNI PAO something very innovative and damn tasty and BARBEQUE HONEY CHICKEN WINGS , they ran out of wings and made the dish with small cubes of chicken 6-8 pieces. They undoubtedly serve quality food but the prices which seemed reasonable at a glimpse were not so once we had seen the quantity. No added tax yet , still good!! Hoping to see a larger version of the cafe coming up soon :)

Was in Kolkata for  a 2 day visit (my 3rd one) and was looking for something different than traditional bengali, mughlai and fast food options. Found this place. Its run by ex hotel management grads and they are the cooks as well. And what comes on the (old metal trunks) table is value for money delicious fare. Ordered a chicken and pork hot dog and Fowl cutlet (grilled not deep fried) and they were bang on as i was expecting. Even the potato wedges served on the sides were tasty and top notch. As for the establishment...its small and cramped with the dining on lower level and upper floor for a pool table. And its  bit difficult to locate. And these are the only shortcomings. Otherwise its nice place to hang out. Especially the rock and roll posters décor...most of which is FOR SALE at a discount. The menu is extensive and needs multiple visits to try it out all. So this means I am definitely coming back. I wish their team a long successful more tasteful future.

Its located beside the orthodox Greek church...the decor is fine...based on the Woodstock festival that took place in usa ...nice tracks being played all along bt the thing which put me off was the cramed space...its very uncomfortable...coming to the food must try is the mango smoothie which I had...along with it the pork pao bhaji was not worth the money they were charging...the best was the crab and fish wrap...its very yummy..over all nice for one visit...though I did not try their soanpapdi which is supposed to b a great one and the Godzilla sandwich.

Ignore the small outlook,  keep an open mind and just get in..  The place where you get butter beer which an absolute yum with a touch of butterscotch and cream. 
The sandwich was a bit small against the price I paid but was actually delicious. The creamy chicken sandwich will get your hands dirty but will be a delight. Would have been better with a hot crust. 
Atlast I got a gift from them as it was their one year anniversary.  
Just a small request,  add a banner on the main street so that people can know about this tasty shack.

I love visiting cafes with their own unique innovative ideas with a twist.I visited this place in a rainy friday afternnon.After a hectic day,I wanted to have some food that can swing my mood.Firstly the decoration was fine,the place looked tiny comparing to other cafes i visited.
 I ordered a lemon tea,pork bhuni pao,creamy chicken sandwich.
After having the tea and a bite of the creamy chicken sandwich my heart melted for the place.The music playing in the background made the ambience great.
Its a good place to visit for having an afternoon meal or breakfast.Its not too much pricy,serving proportion s are sufficient and their execution with the food will certainly make your day.
And what i observed that their serving tables were actually some old steel boxes and they serve you tea in regular tea stall like glasses but with their own decorative ideas.That is what I liked the most.Same thing represented with a twist.The food was definitely great.
But the lemon tea was too much lemony.

It is a very small but cute cafe located near kalighat tram depot. Hardly 15-17 people can seat. They have a pool at the first floor. We ordered spicy chicken wings, bbq chicken wrap, classic chicken wrap, Mexican lamb wrap and spaghetti with cheese and cream sauce with ham and pork sausage. The food was delicious. And the quantity was good too. But service is not so good.we had to wait so long after ordering.  But all over it is a nice place to hangout with finger licking food.

Woodstock 1969 is in my wishlist since I heard some good reviews of them.. Finally today I was able to go there.
Finding the place is very easy, you just take the left lane beside greek church opposite kalighat.

#Place was very cozy and small, decorated with music posters etc...

#Drinks we had SoanPapdi shake which was totally unique and tasted good and Butter beer which taste like a beer with a buttery milk.

#We had creamy chicken wrap with creamy grilled chicken sandwich..
Taste was excellent....

And all these things were cost us 786 INR....

At first look, this is a small place, which can accomodate 15 people at the most; but dont judge it by that. This place has nice ambiance (that of a cool place to hangout with your friends), the decor is quirky and fun, with walls full of posters and paintings and the service is fast, friendly and non-fussy. To describe in a sentence, it feels like chilling at a friend's place.
Now coming to food. No complaints here. The food is quite delicious. We had ordered butterbeer ( for the potterheads), pork hot dog wrap, chicken sandwiches, pasta with arrabiata sauce. While the arrabiata was a little too spicy, the other dishes were good. Do try the chicken sandwich, its yummy with its cheesy goodness.
Also, the day we went the second time, there was a mini jamming session going on! Bonus points for that!

IHM students turned  it wonder. They have that improvisation, innovation which i always search in any restaura . we had godzilla sandwich and warm cheese with white chocolate. Both of the foods were yumm ! Yumm ! :)
Ok, they gave us the chance to customize the own menu which was actually helpful.

Missed to gve a review for this place. It was fan first show day. Paid a visit to this cafe after the movie. Its on the lane of women's Christian college. Easy to locate. A small cafe with a pool at the 1st floor. As we were really hungry ordered many dishes.
Penne Aop, creamy chicken sandwich, pork bhuni pao, soan papdi shake, teriyaki chicken wings, Mexican chilli soda, bacon nd chocolate shake, gondhoraj lime gelato. 
Pork bhuni pao was tasty, teriyaki wings were spicy fingerlicking, penne was good as expected. Sodas were good too... a sumptuous lunch thats it.
Would surely visit again.

If you want the new definition of what a cafe can be, then you should visit this one!

Location is somehow little difficult to find. First location Greek Church, just beside of Tram Depot! Then take the right side lane and walk for 1min and after couple of turning you will find Woodstock!

The name is quite bit a odd but that also make some curiosity in your mind! Couple of friends and their great effort make a car garage into this wonderful cafe. You will see posters of English band, wall painting which is a real attraction for youngster , music in background makes this place a great one! The decorations are kinda retro type. Big wooden box are used as table and LED lights is fitted with some of it will really catch ur attention! It has a max capacity of 12-15 person at a time!

When an ambiance of this cafe is so good, then you can guess how is the service and management could be!! Yesssss, everyone of this cafe are very helpful and you can see the effort in their every movement, wether it is for dish selection or the politeness, you find it everywhere! Service are good and very responsive also!

We ordered couple of items and believe me, every dish they served really melts my heart down!!

Chicken Roll - Yes, one can think about that how well a Chicken Roll can be! But believe me if you want to find your answer, then you have to come here and have to try it! Well fried paratha and full packed fillings of chicken pieces make it an Awesome one as a starting one! The sauce they served with it, is also finger licking!!

Pasta - Yes, there are lots of customisation available for you according to your taste. We take Pasta(Spaghetti) + Cream & Cheese Sauce + Chicken toppings! I tasted various kinda pasta from different restaurant but this one makes me really a die hard fan of their cuisine! Pasta with sufficient amount of well chopped chicken pieces and perfectly blended with cheesy sauce can definitely make you day! Just a spoonful of pasta and let it melted in your mouth slowly!!! Just woooow!

Cheese Garlic Ch. Wings - Though we were very much satisfied with Chicken roll and Pasta, still we ordered this menu, as they are sending us surprise with their every dishes and yes, the surprises are still their in it! Well fried chicken pieces, crispness and cheese sprinkle on top at every bite sure melt down your heart!

Oreo Shakes - Seeing couple of reviews on zomato and as per suggestions of my foody friend

Goa is in town. Pondicherry too is in town. This little wonder is just amazing. Ambience is just mind blowing. Please go on Sunday evenings. They got live music. Food is excellent. A bit 'zara hatke' Menu. Be sure to order Lipsmacking sandwiches, Spicy honey Chicken Wings. Coolers-- do try their home-made Ale, it's refreshing. Also, not to forget-- butter beer. My best wishes for them. Really, this place is the start, I think there will be more cafe s like these in the days to come

Located in a lane between rashbehari tram depot and ancient greek church. A small place but they have found their ways to make it a cozy one, decorated with all teen times loved musics -nirvana, queen, pink floyd posters. Impressed by the kind of hospitality shown by the staff and they also play amazing songs. In all a cool place to hang out with friends and to cheer up your mood.
Coming to the food- butter beer indeed is becoming their attraction zone. Yes it was a sort of new expirience, though I would have more satisfied if it was a bit less sweet. We also ordered for barbeque chicken wrap - I liked it - perfectly cooked, medum spicy, I liked the crunchy wrap. The best among all was the fried potatoes that came with the wrap, it was spicey and yummy, loved it!! for desert we had gandhoraj gelato - it failed to surprise me. I find it more or less like ordinary vanilla ice cream- for which Rs-119 was just a waste.
Best part about the cafe is the food comes inclusive of all taxes and they dont charge extra which is appropriate for students like us with an almost empty wallet nd limited budget.
Overall a nice expirience, good place to enjoy, would like to come back soon.

This is an extremely small cafe serving unusual foods(read experimental and fusion),mostly fusion foods at kalighat.It is located behind the greek church.walk into the narrow lane between the church and the depot and you hit this cafe.

The negatives first.1) it is small.really small.dont come if you are a big group,or with family,or even not recommended for plus sized people.

2)seats are uncomfortable.especially the table at the back where the chairs are high,and the table,being un old trunk,too low for comfort.

3)Not recommended if looking for privacy.

Now the good part.The food.That is good.quite good.

a) The barbeque chicken wings : this was the star of the meal.sweet spicy,slightly smoky with a hint of rosemary,we licked our fingers.

b)crabmeat fish wrap: again great.lightly spiced and creamy,full of crabmeat. value for money because it was huge in size.one thing I want to know though,why noodles were used as part of the fillings?

c) masala pork wrap: again,huge in size.full of spicy pork keema curry.personally felt the curry was like mummy's keema curry and lacked the innovative flavour punch like the other two.but my friend loved it.

d) butterbeer: tasted good but a bit watery.expected it to be creamier and a bit more chilled.

e) virgin mojito and kiwi mojito: good,nothing special.we wanted the mitha pan shake but that wasnt available.

Pricing below those of popular cafe chain.and food quality definitely better.keep it up.will visit again.or may be order in via swiggy this time.

This place is tucked into a small corner behind kalighat tram depot and Greek Orthodox Church. The place is a small one...but the moment you step in you realise that it's a little class apart. Be it the wall decor, the pocket friendly menu with a variety of food and drink options or the amazing ambience created by the owner and the owner's friends, with the evening adda and live musical jam session, the experience was something we did not expect, and it was truly amazing.
We ordered chicken pasta in cream and cheese, which tasted a lot like chicken Alfredo.
Next we tried out the spicy chicken wings. Unfortunately, wing pieces were not available, but they did prepare the same and serve us with boneless pieces, and it was a treat for the palate.
We had read good reviews of the Butterbeer, and decided to take the risk of experimenting. We went ahead and ordered it but was a tad bit disappointed when it came. It looked simply like a butterscotch milkshake when it came. The Butterbeer tasted like crunchy butterscotch particles, sweet milk and bitter coffee, which was a weird combination. We ended up ordering the kiwi Mojito, a bright green coloured drink with bubblegum flavour, which was refreshing. Next we ordered the basil Mojito, which was no different in taste from the ordinary virgin mojito. All in all, it was an amazing experience and highly recommended. I do not know whether the live jam is a daily affair, or the owner's friends get together only on weekends, but we went after a sudden Sunday plan, and thoroughly enjoyed te evening.
Food: 3/5
Ambience: 6/5
Service: 4/5
Variety in menu:3.5/5
Pocket pinch:4/5

Tucked into a small corner lane beside the Greek Church near Kalighat is this teensy cafe. It's literally the front room of someone's house and has been done up with Rock and Metal posters with genre-appropriate music playing in the background. We ordered the Creamy Chicken Wrap, a Mutton Roll and a mug of cold Butter Beer. My high expectations as a Potter-head where dashed when I sipped the drink. It reminded me of liquid Alpenliebe (toffee) mixed in soda and was too sweet for my taste. The Creamy Chicken wrap was made with copious amounts of mayo from a jar which was sad. My friend enjoyed her Mutton Roll though. All in all....I wish they'd tried a bit harder with the food and drinks.

The restaurant is located in a narrow lane adjacent to the kalighat Greek church,near Rashbehari tram depot.A really small compact outlet and the Walls are covered with posters and seating arrangement is little uncomfortable.

We Ordered : Godzilla sandwich,Buffalo chicken wings,Butter-beer and Oreo Shake.
Oreo shake was extremely ordinary,Chicken wings were a bit spicy,Butter-beer was good.
The Godzilla sandwich needs a special mention just for the amount of protein in one dish.
Ham, chicken, 2 sunny side up, makes it a must have for meat lovers.

Though the service was slow and not up to the mark.Prices are reasonable and there's no tax applicable.
Go to Woodstock if you haven't already....

Its a small place near kalighat with a maximum seating arrangement for 10 to 12. I suppose its usp is its loacation and cool music numbers. The downside is the space crunch and above average price of its dishes. The crispy chilly babycorn (nothing special in preparation) is priced 160 while the strawberry coke ( 150 ml coke plus strawberry flavoured syrup) costs 70rs. 
I liked the butter beer and soan papdi shake as these were a bit different from the mainstream drinks. My friends recommended Cheese garlic wings and Crab butter fish wrap which were the only dishes to vouch for due to unavailability of most of the dishes.
The whole ambience is music-themed along with a snooker parlor on the first floor of the cafe.
A better experience is expected for the next visit. I hope the place revamps soon.

This cafe is situated in  the lane adjacent to the Greek Orthodox church near Kalighat .  It is not that hard to find if you take the right lane.  The place  is very  small and cosy. The ambiance is quite good and creative. They have only about 4 tables, so you might have to wait outside before you get a place. I found this very disturbing.  I also found  the seating arrangements not so comfortable. The couches were really small and its hard to dine there. But yes the staffs were nice and polite. Service was fast enough.  They apologize every time when they need to make someone wait outside. 
 Well ,coming to food we ordered their and Spicy Chicken Wings and Kiwi Mojito. We would have ordered more only if they had accepted cards. Yes, Cards are not accepted. Never mind ,the coolers were refreshing and tasty enough to make you wait worthy. Chicken wings were fried perfectly and the flavours of the sauces were distinct. Quantity was also good . 
Overall a nice place for small eats.

This place was on my wish list for quite sometime now and hence I decided to check it out a couple of weeks back. The first thing you'll notice is the fact the place is small. Like tiny. But then don't judge them on that. There is a pool table upstairs which you can play on for 80 bucks an hour I guess. Coming to the food, the first thing I ordered was buffalo chicken wings. They were a bit too hot for my liking. Nevertheless, I quite enjoyed it. It eas very tasty indeed. Next we went for the crispy chilli baby corn and I was surprised to find it surpass my expectations. It was very tasty, however, it could be a bit more crispy. What stole the show was some of the following; first of all, the fresh lime soda was the best I have ever tried out. It smelt really lemony and tasted amazing. Secondly, their penne arrabiata was the best that I have ever tasted, if you're gonna go there, you have to try it out. And lastly, their chocolate excess was a mouthgasm, you would think I'm exaggerating but to be honest I've never ever tried a better dessert than that. It is a must try. The staff is comprised of the owner and his friends so the hospitality gets a 5/5. I'd surely visit them again . Thanks for a great experience guys. The review is missing the .5 because of the space crunch. Nothing else would stop me from giving them a 5/5

Remember making a pact with your friends to start a cafe one drunken college night? Well, Woodstock 1969 is what you would've gotten if you actually went through with those plans.
It's a small place, not as cosy as it is cramped; but you have to admit they've got really cool framed posters of The Beatles, Pink Floyd and other legendary bands almost from floor to ceiling, wall to wall. They're on sale too, by the way. It's so refreshing to see a place which is made around a concept instead of a random cafe. 
The food is undeniably top-drawer. Special applause for the Masala Pork Wrap in particular which was sumptuously decadent - a real delightful smack in the face if you're having a bad day. It'll lift you right up. They've got a marvellous variety of foods and drinks and meats and sandwiches and rolls and wraps and pastas and momos and other things which Heaven is made of. 
However, the one untidy splotch which sullies the good name of Woodstock 1969 is the "pool table" they have upstairs. Let me break it to you in decidedly unambiguous terms - it is no pool table. It is barely even a table, and is no larger than a large cot for a child. The room which embowers this table is infuriatingly small as well. Hitting the cue ball on the table becomes a task in and of itself, even with the extra small cue sticks they've provided. If you're going there for pool, don't. 
But the food, no doubt, is great. If you get a place to sit, that is.

This place was  on my wish list for a long time , and only for butterbeer . So finally I went there today with a friend. We ordered two cold butterbeer. The warm one is served during winters. And it tasted gooood. Though I don't think it has anything even nearest to beer (atleast I didn't find any :P). Still everyone , and especially potterheads :D , should give this joint a try atleast once.

This cafe is situated somewhere in between the lane of Kalighat tram depot and Greek Orthodox church. One if it's nearest landmarks is also Women's Christian College. We dropped in here today at around 2:30pm for lunch. This cafe is not too big but small and very cosy. The ambiance is quite appreciable and creative minds will definitely love this place. They have 4-5 tables so it would be better if you reserve your table before you make your visit. Everything about this cafe was nice but I feel that the seating arrangements can be improved because I found them not so comfortable. The couches were really small and the edge of the table was hurting our knees. :( This is one of the drawbacks. Well coming to food we ordered their Kiwi mojito, Virgin mojito, Sphagetti lamb bolognese from the main course and creamy cheesy sandwich. Sphagetti lamb bolognese was okayish but the creamy cheesy sandwich really won my heart. It was amazing. The coolers were refreshing specially the Kiwi mojito. Service was good and staff management deserves a thumbs up. They also have good playlist which will not make you feel bored. Looking forward to visit it once again.

A music lover's den... The moment you enter Woodstock 1969 it will take your heart away... A perfect place to rejuvenate you after a day long's struggle and monotony... A small quirky place with three caring hosts always on their feet and creative seating arrangements with all time hits playing in the background will set your mood just right for a relaxed evening... Be it their finger food or the extra large meaty burgers or the innovative mocktails... You just can't have enough of this place... The cherry on top is the small loft arrangement with a pool table to keep you engaged through the evening along with live musical gigs every now and then...Being a metal header's wife, I could not resist purchasing one of the various posters around... So if you think rock and metal are slowly fading away from the Kolkata musical scene, you should definitely visit this place for a first hand experience...and once you bite into their extra meaty burgers, you are bound to be back for more...

Woodstock 1969 - A small cafe tucked in the lane between Kalighat Tram Depot and the Greek Orthodox Church near Rashbehari crossing. Now lets put the review in the following sections:-

Ambiance:

- Small cafe with a seating capacity of 10-12 guests. The room looks like outer seating area of a half a century old building with a twisted staircase.

- The decor is nice and attractive with the murals of all legendary rockstars.

- Their seating is on nice and cozy tools. Perhaps the cushions can get a replacement.

Food:

- Innovative menu. Some of the items really catch your eye.

- Nice cheesy white hot chocolate, wraps, sandwiches.

- Great food and the ingredients used are fresh.

Could be better:

- Ordered for some chicken wings, which tasted nice but the way it was cut and served can be improved.

- The chips that came with the sandwich was under-cooked. Probably because it was their last order, the chef was in a hurry.

- This place can seriously get a washroom. When you visit a cafe or a place to eat (not the roadside stalls of course) you expect it to have a washroom. Hope the owner has a chance to add that to his wonderful quaint little place.

Overall very nice experience and keep it up.

Refreshing to say the least. The theme, the food, the music and definitely the infinity tables. Lets get straight to the point. 
Pros : 1. The theme of the cafe will certainly appeal to music lovers
2. The food quality and quantity. More than satisfying
3. The unlimited coffee. I dont think any other restaurant or cafe has this edge
4. The inevitable personal touch because the cafe is managed by her very owners. So u know u will be in good hands
5. The infinity tables
6. The sunday evening music sessions. Do attend one.Ul know how good it is.
And much more....
Cons : just one. Dude should have had a timeportal that takes us back to 1969. Woodstock to be precise. Was really expecting one 😃

It's really a nice place for teenager like us and also for those who love good food and good music. Last but not the least I would like to add that it would have been much more better (the ambience and all) if the place would have a bit more space.

I am voracious eater and i found solace in the Godzilla sandwich this joint offers.  Layers of bread decked up choicest filling of chicken, mutton, ham and eggs with a spread of herbs, butter and sauces. I would also suggest the Mexican Lamb and the their specialty - Butter beer. Do try out this place people!

Guys, I must say that this place is a hidden gem in the food map of Kolkata. Three IHM graduates with dreams of a start up came up here in the bylanes of Kalighat where they serve food with a touch of 'quirkiness'. I am calling it 'quirky' because you can't define what kinda cuisine is actually served here. There's continental and also something extra with a touch of innovation. It's fused with Kolkata street food so well that your fingers will keep on licking good till the end starting from the very beginning. From paos to sandwiches to wraps, even the desserts, everything is so freaking good. You will be amazed to see that they have combined weird types of dishes for certain courses of the meal that's totally unexpected but it's worth to be tried for.
One thing I must say, it's pretty hard to locate, apt for being a 'hidden gem'. You have to take the lane beside the Orthodox Greek Church at Kalighat and then turn right for three times and will find a very small place resembling a Xerox shop. Get inside and surprises are awaiting you to tickle your taste buds with open arms. Another backdrop is the place is too small and congested. Maximum 14 people can be accommodated at a time. But when they serve good food, you can go till the highest extent.
The decor is cool charmed up with music and concert posters of rock and roll genre. They themselves have painted up the place with cute wall paints of birds sitting on branches. The whole thing, amidst all congestion created a nice ambiance. I loved it when the aroma of cooking embraces you as soon as you enter the place.
Now, coming to the most awaited and important part - F O O D! I must say it's just top notch from top to bottom. Every dish is cooked with perfection, love and innovation. We had taken the Pork Bhuni Pao with Soan Papri Shake Combo, Crab Butter Fish Wrap and a Godzilla Sandwich. For desserts, came the Gondhoraj Lime Gelato and Chocolate Excess with Grilled Bacon. And if you're a potterhead, how can you miss butter beer available at this part of the city?
First came the Pork Bhuni Pao. Two average pao breads lightly toasted with butter served with a super delicious Masala Pork. Oh my goodness! The masala pork was so good that I kept on licking my fingers even after finishing the whole plate. Felt like licking off the plate, but that would have been a bit too much for me, then! ;) It came with a Soan Papri Shake combo. I have been eating this sweet since forever. Never thought that a drink could be made out of this delicacy. Kudos to the person whose idea it was because this is an absolute hit! This should be definitely tried here.
Then came the Crab Butter Fish Wrap. I thought this would be average. But no man, I was wrong! I wonder where did they manage to gather so much of solid crabmeat? Filled with layers and layers of crabmeat and fish and mayonnaise, you will definitely love this if you're a seafood lover like us.
Last came their signature Godzilla Sandwich. It's huge, enormous, big as anything. Two sets of sandwiches with potato wedges. This contains their classic masala pork, the classic chicken mix, ham, bacon and a fried egg with lettuce. I think they can also add tomato and onions to it to make the thing more yummy. I got tired while eating this delicious beast, rested and ate again. Finished the whole thing off. Not even a small bit was left on our plates at the end.
Last came the desserts. The Gondhoraj Lime Gelato was yummy. I don't know if it's homemade gelato or what, but it was so creamy and soft with a gentle flavour of Gondhoraj Lebu, subtle enough to blow away all the senses of a food loving bangali. And the Chocolate Excess! Did you ever thought of bacon in a dessert? Yes, they made this impossible to be possible. The salty bacon and the sweet chocolate created a perfect balance of the sweetness. Many may feel sceptical about this. My suggestion is go for it. You will definitely love this. The butter beer was also good as this was my first take on it. Can't judge if it was perfect or not until I have them at Universal Studios, the ones made and served by the Harry Potter franchise itself. But I loved it for now.
The person who took our orders, helped us with his valued suggestions was extremely helpful. He kept on asking how was the food after every course and was extremely keen if we had any problem or discomfort sort of thing over there. Later, after paying the bill we had a word about their mission and dreams. He is one of the owners of this place. It was good to be here and have a delightful gastronomic experience. Hope to be here again. And one more thing, they don't have added taxes which is surely gonna save a whole lot of your pocket. The prices are good in compliance with quality and quantity. So, next time, definitely hit this place for a sumptuous meal. Happy Dining! :)

Cafe Woodstock 1969...not a cool place to be..
I thought of not writing a review but couldn't stop myself from doing it. We left the place in like 15 mins coz it's a bit shady, claustrophobic n the coffee wasn't that great.
The coffee was a bit to expensive compared to the quality. It is definitely not a very cosy cafe where u can sit for hours.
There is a lot of scope of improvement.
Possibly not stepping in again~ Period.

Quality food at the best possible price! The decor and music add to an overwhelming atmosphere which detaches you from the flow of time. This place is addictive. Beware!

Had the chance of visiting woodstock  1969 today..And boy oh boy, i am jiggered. Tucked in an alley a small food joint which serves lip smacking food.. The concept of the place is well cerebrated.. Sitting arrangement is small but well good food redresses for everything i believe.. We made ourselves comfortable and ordered- 
1)soan papdi shake- i was recommended to try this shake, and I genuinely fell in love.. Soan papdi blended with milk and topped with crushed soan papdi, it was a bliss for my taste bud. 
2)classic vegan sandwich- the bread and tomatoes were fresh and had opulent amount of cheese too.. It was satiating.
3)crispy chicken burger with extra cheese- glad we ordered it.. The good old burger.. The patty was thick with the right punch of flavours. 
4) barbecued honey chicken wings- it has to be my favourite.. The wings succulent.. The marination was really done beautifully.. The best part was the sweet sticky sauce.. Definitely a winner.. 
5) creamy chicken sandwich with a sunny side up- well even this one did not disappoint us.. The chicken stuffing was creamy and rich.. 

About management- amiable, helpful.. Extremely courteous.. 😊
Cost- very much pocket friendly. 

Woodstock 1969 is truly a hidden gem.. It serves better food than many over hyped places.. Surely needs to be explored.. It is a paradise for foodies..

Honestly, after staying in Pondicherry for a year (where meat usually means pork or beef) my knack for burgers has suddenly hiked. I was always so disappointed by the limited varieties of burger in Kolkata until now. Thanks to Woodstock cafe. It is indeed a hidden gem. My order was an American Breakfast Burger which had ham, bacon and eggs. Basically, everything you want in a burger and I got it at below 200. Seriously cheaper than UT Pondicherry. The burger was beyond bliss. So, if you are a meat lover and you want to eat a good wholesome burger without being worried about the price then this is definitely your place.

Really cool place. Small but good ambience. The music played is very groovy.
Food is really very good. Some of the mocktails are interesting. And it's all extremely pocket-friendly.
Service is prompt.
Great place. Worth going.

Located in the alley between Kalighat metro and Greek Orthodox Church, Woodstock 1969 is a treasure once found out. It was a friend who first took us to this place as she herself consider it to be a hidden jewel. And she isn't wrong as I too feel the same. A small cafe with ten to twelve seats, and much to the surprise they have a pool table on the second floor. The decor is pretty much cool with hand drawn art on the wall and few posters of musical bands hanging to add up to the theme. Service is pretty much prompt. Now coming up to the food. I wouldn't hesitate to say how much this place attract me and the only reason be the delicious food it serves which are pretty much pocket friendly. Being a regular visitor I have a lot to review when it comes to food. Here it goes.

Butterbeer: It has no doubt become a famous cafe in South Kolkata and one of the many reason be this one. Yes, Butterbeer, landed straight from the Diagon Alley. Sounds great, ain't it? Yes the same thought pretty much attracted me as well being a Potterhead and with no surprise it did not fail to impress me to be very honest. So I would definitely give it a thumbs up for sure. 
Rate: 4/5
Mexican chilli Soda: Next comes my second favourite. The name says it all. Chilli, that's right! For spice lover can definitely give it a try. Who thought spice could be used so efficiently in a drink! Although my friends didn't like it much but I would definitely ask everyone to give it a try at least once.
Rate: 4/5
Fresh Lime Soda: An all season drink, which is pretty much the usual one as served elsewhere. So there's not much to say about it. 
Rate:3/5
Kiwi Mojito: Thought of trying something new, so gave it a go. Although a completely new one for me as I never tried it before, so there's no place to compare it with elsewhere, a sweet flavoured drink good enough for a try.
Rate: 3.5/5
Chicken Tikka Sandwich: This is probably the first dish I tried on my very first visit and let me tell you it was since then I added Woodstock 1969 to my go-again list. They serve it with potato wedges which is tasty as well. So I would definitely ask everyone to give it a try.
Rate: 5/5
Classic Chicken Wrap: This one is another precious gem to the treasure, trust me. It has creamy feeling right till the end that soothes the tastebud to the different level all together. A must try.
Rate:5/5
BBQ Chicken: This is probably the one that didn't impress me at all. So only if you are "JABRAA" fan of BBQ sauce give it a try, otherwise I would definitely not suggest this particular one. 
Rate:2/5
Mexican Lamb Wrap: Not much a Lamb fan but still loved the way it was prepared and the taste. A favourite among my friends and me as well so definitely giving it a thumbs up.
Rate: 4/5
Crispy Chilli Babycorn: The Crispy Chilli Babycorn is probably the best I had in town. Trust me when I say it. I would definitely ask each and everyone who is reading this to order this particular one.
Rate: 5/5
Kentucky Style Chicken Wings: A new one. Good one. Taste good. Crispy from outside and soft inside. Overall a Nice dish altogether. 
Rate:4.5/5
Teriyaki Chicken Wings: Teriyaki Chicken is basically my personal favourite so ordered with great expectation. I loved it, although it was not much a hit among my friends but I would ask y'all to give it a try if you are a big fan of Teriyaki Chicken. 
Rate: 4/5
Monster Meat burger: As the name say, it definitely is of monster sized. Not much a burger fan so for me it's a big NO. But then no burger impress me so just don't refrain yourself from trying it if you are a burger fan. 
Rate:2/5
Penne Pasta in Creme and Cheese Sauce: Now comes the one that I love. Particularly the one they serve. Whenever I suggest a friend to go Visit this place, the first thing I ask them to do is try out this particular dish. It has everything in one bowl to take one to the creamy world until the last bite. This is surely the best they have in stock. I would ask everyone reading this review to give it a try, I am sure you'll love it. 
Rate: 5/5
Gondhoraj lime Gelato: Ordered it after getting a lot of positive reviews. But this one didn't impress me at all to be very honest. 
Rate:2/5
Having numerous pros with few cons I would definitely rate Woodstock 1969 with 4.5 points. This place is definitely my personal favourite among the others. 
Note: They make customised posters too on order.

We went there on a particularly sweltering afternoon, and were welcomed into a cosy little cafe. Decked up in posters of rock bands and graffiti of legends from Hendrix to Morrison, it looked pretty neat and well maintained considering the lack of space. We started off with the Kiwi mojito and the Italian soda. Both tasted fresh and were an instant relief to our poor souls. The barbeque honey chicken wings were cooked to perfection. I couldn't get enough of the glaze!! The monster meat burger stuck to its name: a massive affair of meat along with some lovely potatoes on the side. My friend could hardly finish it, even after sharing it with me. The best part was the mexican lamb wrap. It was just the right amount of spice and crunch, and was as good as an entire meal. The ambiance went up another notch for the amazing playlist they had. It was fun singing along to some  of my favourite refrains. I ended up adding a couple of new songs to my playlist as well! The owner is extremely helpful in choosing out dishes. Brownie points for no added taxes: what's better than great food which is lighter on the pockets! Only drawback was there being no washbasin. Overall, I'd definitely give this place another visit!

This little joint is a room full of happy vibes. The interiors, the walls are decorated with old school rock n roll posters. Having to be a rock n roll person, this place is enticing! The whole area is really small but the people are ultra nice and polite. Now coming to food, the place has great, great food! Worth every penny. Their chicken wings being one of them. I hope the little joint levels up because it's a tiny place and a little hard to locate.

A small, cosy pocket friendly place with scrumptious food. I guess that's all college goers like us look for. Well then, Woodstock 1969 it is, for you. On my first visit to this joint near Kalighat tram depot, I was quite taken in by the feel of it. Almost as if you've gone over to a friend's house for a cup of coffee and, if circumstances permit, a game of billiard maybe. As it is with my memory, I completely forgot about clicking pictures. But there's some really cool wall art you should check out. Though I missed out on the billiard room upstairs, I'm sure it must have been equally pretty if not more, for the people up there weren't the least interested to vacate the room !
Now coming to the food, we chose crispy chicken and a classic chicken wrap, which was enough for two. Though the former wasn't something I would vouch for, the wrap did us the better. A generous amount of chicken and mayo filling rolled in a thin crust, it made the day ! Would like to try pasta next time.
In summing up, a nice endeavour. I just wish they did something about the entrance, to make it a tad bit more noticeable.

Woodstock 1969 is a nice, quaint, rock-and-roll themed cafe located just beside the Greek Orthodox Church near Kalighat that serves delicious food coupled with an array of drinks. The ambiance is cozy and complemented with good music and friendly owners. I'd recommend it as a great place to hangout with friends. Do try the Butter Beer, it's amazing! :)

Located right at the end of the lane beside the Greek Orthodox Church at kalighat, this is a tiny cafe formed at the ground floor/garage of an old residential building. By small I mean it is really really small. Barely 10 people can fit here at a go. They have provided low laying seats which are a tad bit uncomfortable I feel. This is basically a Rock n roll themed cafe and whatever little place they got, they have tried to decorate it with nice posters and paintings of famous bands and personalities. That's great and refreshing, so thumbs up. There's a tiny pool table upstairs where you can chill if you wish to. The music sets up the mood. Now coming to food. The highlight has to be the Butter beer. Being a Harry Potter fanatic I was overtly excited about it. Barring that we had ordered ice tea, oreo shake, chicken tikka sandwiches. The ice tea was good. Oreo shake was extremely ordinary and the sandwich was below par. ( One could make a better sandwich at home). We had a brownie bowl in the end which was quite good. The owner (I'm presuming 😛) personally took the orders,so that personal touch is great. Price is reasonable and there's no tax applicable. This place has received some amazing reviews, I however cannot agree with them completely. This is a very fresh initiative for a city like Kolkata where there's hardly any innovation. However space crunch and food quality is something they need to work on.

Located just beside the church near Kalighat is this quiet little cafe. It might not be known to many people but this is where you can find Butterbeer, the drink popular in the fictional Harry Potter universe, Fans rejoice!! One can also get customized posters here. 

The decor is very old school and the number of seats are not very large, however there is a pool table upstairs for people to play. Now coming to the food, they have a large variety of food to try from as is available in many cafes. What stands out is the butterbeer and the use of bacon with chocolate and in desserts. The creamy chicken sandwich was even creamier than expected and the nachos were hand made and not sold out of a packet. The drinks were all refreshing.

This place is definitely one to check out in the city. So head over here soon. I will definitely visit again.

Butterbeer!!!!! This is probably the only joint in kolkata which serves the butter beer straight out of the Harry potter books. I am not a fan of beer at all but boy, could one resist their butterbeer? No!
Its a perfect blend of homemade butterscotch and beer. But this is not the only star in the menu. The food menu in fact is pretty smartly made covering both vegan and nonveg options. The classic chicken wrap, Kentucky style chicken wings , pastas in various choice of sauces are absolutely amazing. The oreo shake they serve is out of the world. The place is wee bit small but I must say they have made the best out of it.

It is pathetic. Can't believe how this place is so overrated. They served hot coffee with cold refrigerated milk. The other order was also very loosely made with no taste. Then the person serving the coffee held the cups from the edges (sipping edges). I mean, really! Can't be more unprofessional..
It is as small as a store room.
Travelled so far for the place and were seriously disappointed..

Well,no amount of words would suffice for this place. To start with, the food here is delectable. Each and every dish on the menu card is absolutely worth the price and you definitely would not regret tasting even one them. The ambience is perfect for a cozy 'adda' with friends. The decor is something to be taken notice of.
To sum it up,the cafe vouches for the hard work put into turning it out the way it is ( both in food and decor ).
Way to go guys.
P.s: looking forward to see your outlet in some other places as well. ;)

Terrible experience . From sitting to food, nothing was worth it . Two cups of coffee is Rs. 183 (mind you, small cups) and the quality was very bad. Better have coffee in your own house .Never go here until you are very stupid. I guess the good reviews here are the paid ones . Better go to barista , CCD, or your own house is enough in this case

Now that's what a start-up is like..A quaint lane leading to an old-fashioned house and when you least expect it, you find a little cafe..Filled with frames of rock icons and da booming music in the background, this place has a homely feel to it..The food is okay and the people are amicable..

The basic problem with this place is that it's too small. The seats and tables are too close together and it's pretty uncomfortable sitting there. The food and ambience is decent but nothing too special. In spite of having high expectations for this place the experience was pretty underwhelming to say the least.

Had been hearing about this cafe for quite a long time. So when one of my friends decided to give a treat for her new job, & name of this cafe sprang up during the discussion regarding the venue, I was one of the very first to vote for it.
Located near kalighat tram depot , on the lane beside the Greek church, this one is quite easy to find. Named after the legendary music festival held in 1969 at Woodstock, this cafe is themed in the style of a music cafe. It's evident from the signboard containing colourful pics of musical instruments which hangs over the entrance. However as you enter the outlet you are sure to be disappointed. It's really small, I mean so small it's not possible to make your way without bumping into somebody first. That's bound to happen when an old house is repurposed into a cafe. This cafe hardly seats around 12 people in quite uncomfortable low repurposed stools. There's a second floor with a pool table too, but the stairs are fairly steep & the place is congested as well. It's better to seat in the ground floor. Also note, inspite of the small size, the popularity of this cafe among the city's young ones make sure it's full to the brim during the evening, & you'll have to wait. It's better to visit it during the noon, to avoid the rush.Coming to the décor the walks are decorated with band posters & insignias. Popular english rock & pop music is played over the music system. Surely if you have been a music lover at some point of time you'll find most of the tracks familiar.
As we made ourselves 'comfortable' we were handed the menu. The menu is quite extensive for place of this size I must say. We ordered the following items:

Butter Beer:
I'm not sure what Hogwarts has to do with music, but this one was the first one from the menu that we chose.Had heard a lot about this drink, so much so it seemed it is the signature drink of this place.Prepared with butterscotch , root beer, whipped butter & soda this one definitely is no alcoholic drink. However I could not really enjoy it. In fact before coming to the place I had planned to haves at least a couple of glasses, sadly had to limit myself to half a glass only.
Bacon & Chocolate Shake:
Chocolate milk shake topped with shredded bacon. This was a surprise! I for one never expected to find bacon in a drink. The sweetness of the shake was a stark difference to the salty bacon shreds. One of my friends liked it. But I do not quite like these idea of chewing when I am drinking. So in spite of its innovative taste I was not able to fully appreciate it.
Soan Papri Shake:
Well this one was what I loved. Quality soan blended with milk until smooth as silk then again topped with crushed soan papri. A great tasting drink. Enjoyed till the last drop. Definitely recommended.
Mexican Chilli Soda:
This one was ordered by one of my friends. She being a fan of spicy drinks & me being not, I only took one sip of this drink which I did not like. However others quite liked it & I will recommend this item if you are fan of such spicy mixes.
Pork Wrap:
The next item we ordered looked quite interesting. However the wrap itself seemed confused between crispy & soggy. To say the truth I would have loved it if it was any of the two. The filling however was perfect. I so wished the whole item would have been the same.
Godzilla Sandwich:
Now untill this moment the experience had been quite mixed one. Still quite hungry & wanting to discover at least one item that we can appreciate , we asked the server for a pork sandwich. She suggested the Godzilla Sandwich. We were sceptical since that was the costliest item in the sandwich section. But when it arrived on the table we knew that it was money's worth. Bacon, poached eggs with cheese, the sandwich was quite huge, undoubtedly tasty. Will definitely recommend this one.
To sum up the experience, the place has too many cons compared to pros for a subsequent visit from me. Small place, uncomfortable seating arrangements, not so good drinks. But....
In spite of all these things I am going to go back their. For the music they play, & for the Godzilla Sandwich for sure. From the look of it , the owners didn't seem highly professional hoteliers, but their prompt service, polite attitude & above all this initiative of opening a peace & music themed cafe should be definitely appreciated.
One thing that they need to improve upon is the presentation of the food, a touch up here, a touch up there will surely help.
Will visit as soon as I can,
Till then
Happy Eating,
Cheers
                                          ...

This place is tiny. Food is okayish. Good job with the decor,  the posters keep you busy. Try the pasta you might like it. Price is reasonable.  Overall okayish.

Woodstock 1969 is an embodiment of 'Big surprises come in small packages"!! The restaurant is named so because it is themed around the 60s and 70s music with posters of famous bands from the era adorning the walls (namely Queen, Lynyrd skynyrd, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Elvis Presley) along with caricatures of renowned musical legends. And as one can guess, the awesome music brings alive the place and works up a good appetite!! We ordered Italian ground lamb meat sandwich with egg boats in place of bread slices (basically they scoop out part of the bread and stuff it with egg filling)! The deliciousness of the spicy and tangy lamb meat combined with egg made for a very gratifying appetizer. Next we helped ourselves to barbeque honey chicken wings-the juicy marvellously grilled wings with the honey sauce tasted blissful. For main course, they served us penne pasta in cream and cheese sauce with added chicken and ham- quite well prepared but somewhat heavy. Now the dessert, chocolate excess with grilled bacon was a novelty. I was a bit skeptical about grilled bacon being part of a dessert but who knew, it would blend so well with the chocolate sauce and vanilla cream and yet stand out with its unique taste!! Kudos!! The place is really small and service is kind of slow but the wait is worth it for the scrumptious treats that are in store for you!!

I've visited that place last night. It was a horrible experience of mine. I didn't know where it is properly. So,I called up them on zomato's phone number,they were less interested to talk with me and don't want to tell me where it is properly. I called up them many times beacuse i couldn't understand where it is. Atlast I've found it. That time it's tottaly full. One of them told me wait outside and when a table will empty,they will call us. We are waiting like 30-40mints. After that one group came, they entired the cafe and they've got a table. Whenever they already told me wait outside,we will call you. Even they don't want to check whether anyone is standing or not on outside. SERIOUSLY U GUYS ARE TOO BAD . TINY SPACE,BAD BEHAVIOR,BAD STAFFS,BAD MANERRS may be there foods will be LIKE THEM. Be careful GUYS. Don't visit that place.

Woodstock 1969 is a tiny restaurant (if I may call it so) behind the Greek Orthodox church in Kalighat.
I first thing I felt was suffocated . .an itsy bitsy room with 3 even tinier tables n stools. You can actually hear the conversation at the next table and that's quite distracting during your own chat.
We ordered a butterscotch milkshake . .2 butterbeers(hot and cold) . .a chicken lak mi kai and a chicken in classic sauce . .The drinks were awesome . .they surely would give Madam Rosmerta some competition. The chicken dishes though tasty (the lak mi kai more so) were not much in amount.
Then my sugar cravings kicked in and I ordered I a brownie bowl in my desperation. It  was not a brownie but surely that was some bowl .  A huge bowl filled with what I could call at most a soft airy cake. .its too much in amount for even two and I had to struggle till the end as I hate wasting food.
The service is ok for a cafe kind of a place . .not too fast . .but they do not accept credit cards . .that's another down.
I don't think I will be going back except if I get a huge butterbeer craving.

A really small compact outlet with rock and roll theme. Walls are covered with posters and seating arrangement is little uncomfortable. Music is pretty good. Drinks beverages and snacks are very tasty. Price is little high I guess for a place like it. They do have a pool table which you may book a slot for 80/- for half hour but you do need to reach there via a narrow and steep staircase. The service is not up to the mark as I guess the staff are not professional but rather college going students.

Went to this joint today. It is located in the narrow lane adjacent to the kalighat Greek church. The signboard outside won't attract much attention. But the interior seemed quite cool to me. Although they have space constraints but they've decked it up with nice graffiti and cool posters. One thing attractive about this place is the music that they play over here. We were greeted with pink Floyd and we left with jamiroquai in our head with Metallica sprinkled in between. The food is nice although they can do a lot better with more coffee choices. Had to satiate out thirst with hot chocolate instead. Although we couldn't complain as hot chocolate goes quite as nice as a cup of coffee in a rainy evening. You can have quite a nice time over there. Another con is the seating arrangement as they are quite small. It's cool but without any support to lean your shoulders on can piss you off if you stay seated for a prolonged period of time. All in all a cool little joint with a nice ambiance, good food and good music. Recommended. @

A rock and roll themed cafe in an old Kolkata house, which would not seem at first glance to be the appropriate setting, but has come together nicely.  We had the Fowl cutlet and barbecued chicken wings, both of which were nice enough.

A little cafe near the Greek Orthodox Church. We had ordered the BBQ and honey chicken wings, the butterscotch shake, Godzilla sandwich, crispy chicken burger and chocolate excess with grilled bacon for dessert. The food was exceptionally good. The Godzilla sandwich needs a special mention just for the amount of protein in one dish. Ham, chicken, 2 sunny side up, makes this a must have for meat lovers. The butterscotch shake was good, refreshing on a summer day. The wings were tossed in a wonderful sauce. And the dessert was such an interesting concept and somehow seemed to work. Eager to try the various other innovative dishes available on the menu. Service was a but slow, but you know what they say: Good things come to those who wait.

Having heard good things about this place my friend and I decided upon giving it a shot a few days back and ended up having a rather average experience. The place is located near rashbehari crossing in one of the alleys bang opposite to the newly constructed main gate to the kalighat temple.

The interiors are very nicely and tastefully done. The way the management has converted this small space into an innovative food joint is definitely appreciable. The choice of music was good too. But the issue for me was that the seating arrangements were way too uncomfortable and we had to bend down to reach the tables. The amount of leg space was far too less. The tables were so close to each other that its almost impossible to have a personal conversation.

Coming to the food,the menu is nice and attractive with different kinds of options. I had ordered the monster meat burger for myself and my friend ordered the penne in cheese and creme sauce. I had asked the waiter what all they had in their burger and the person could tell me only after 5 mins consultation with people in the kitchen probably. The fact that the staff were not aware and knowledgeable of what they were serving was somewhat of a turn off for me.

 When the burger arrived I must admit it was pretty decent. It was nice and big and the way i kinda wanted it. The bun could have been a little softer and fresher may be. The patty was a tad flaky and dry. But it was good otherwise. The Penne in creme and cheese sauce took a long long time in arriving and when it finally did it was average at best. The sauce was rather dilute and no where near as cheesy or creamy as it should have been. Finally we had wanted a bacon and ice cream sandwich but then it was unavailable.The pricing is quite moderate.

I tend to like these type of innovative joints with reasonable pricing and an unique menu. You cannot go to these places with massive expectations but then my visit to Woodstock honestly left a lot to be desired.

First things first, the management has played their smart card with the interiors and it is super creative. Transforming such a small space into an hospitable little room does take some brain storming. The art on the wall is very attractive and one of it is now my phone's wallpaper. Another plus is the music.

Service:

We got into this place around 8.50 in the evening. Though the place closes down anywhere between 9 to 9.30, they did take our orders and served them to us politely. Once we received our food, they also asked whether we would like to order anything else, when we declined, only then they went forward to close the kitchen for the day. This is the kind of service you get when the owner's take it upon themselves to entertain guests. Very hospitable environment. 

Food:

Coming to the food. We ordered spicy chicken wings, creamy chicken wrap, butter beer and kiwi mohito. The spicy chicken wings were the favorite at the table. Spicy, saucy, crispy, juicy, they ticked all the right boxes with our expectations and was a straight hit. The creamy chicken wrap was more of a let down. The chicken was way over cooked, almost thread like. I had a very hard time getting through the wrap. The wrap along with its filling is abundant and can be easily distributed among two people. Both the beverages were average. 

The hospitality and the good smelling pasta on the other table will surely see me coming back for more. Hope to try the other dishes, though with no overcooked chicken please. 

Suggestion: The plates are really disappointing. Better plates and larger glasses will be appreciated.

Tried out the Butterbeer & Chocolate Excess with grilled bacon... Both were quite good... The music was also of my taste... However the negative point is that the place is extremely small & cramped... Only 4 small tables(2 of them were actually trunks)... Each table can accommodate properly 3 people & a max of 4... I would recommend not to go their if you have a large group....

We had Strawberry coke and Bacon and chocolate shake. Both had unique taste. A must try indeed. Coming to food, we had Cheese Chicken garlic wings and Pork pav bhaji. They tasted pretty decent. Music was good, so was their service.

after going through all the zomato reviews i finally managed to visit this place..it was an afternoon time n so was a bit hot n it took a lil while finding the place but obviously its worth of that...
.>>location:just near women's Christian college....
>>Ambience:it was a little place with lots of posters..well decorated..dimly lit..air conditioned .and there were only 14 mini chairs which is the one and only drawback of this place..there is a pool board ..upstairs which i previously thought was free of cost but on reaching there came to they charges 150/hour for this...
.>>Serving time:it took hardly 10minutes to serve our 1st order n before finishing that they served d 2nd n so on and there were 2persons taking the orders n they were very well mannered..
>>Food:now coming to the main attraction of this place.we ordered 3items for d 2 of us....
●Pao bhuni-4 slices of bread served with spicy pork with some onions and masala french fries.it smelled yum.n d taste was just mouth-watering...
●meaty club sandwich-double layered sandwich with 2 pieces of ham,lotsss of mayonnaise,chicken cubes,lettuce,egg.it was served with some masala french fries.it tastes heavenly.a must have for mayonnaise lovers.....
●Mexican lamb wrap:it was kinda tacos filled with spicy minced lamb n corn.this dish was also fantastic...Dont know which 1 was better than others..all the dishes were truly fingerlicking and quantity was also enough.The two of us couldn't finish it properly....
>>Pocket pinch:i didn't know that it was totally tax free..all of these only costed 437......unbelievable man......overall i m going to give it a full 5/5..n will obviously recommend even i am planning to visit there again and again and try all their dishes
------------------
Visited 5-6 times
N tried new items(repeated old items too😁)
>>spaghetti with meatball-large quantity and obviously high quality (meatball option:lamb/chicken)
Tasted spicy n yummy
More than enough for two people
>>italian lamb sandwich-this was the best sandwich i ever had..the filling was way too much for a single sandwich..perfectly cooked n adequate ratio of spices with enough amount of minced lamb..presented with potato wedges (cooked in garlic and coriander)
Enough for two ppl
>>chicken wrap-may be this was a bad choice for me as it was too filled with mayonnaise n chicken & not at all spicey..still mayonnaise lovers can go for it
>>chocolate shake- truly chocolaty
>>oreo shake-good to finish with

Food is good. Decor is creative. Staff behavior is humble.
But the only problem is the seating arrangement. The seats aren't comfortable and one needs to bend down uncomfortably to reach out for the table. Except this, everything is perfect!

Woodatock 1969 is a cafe near Rashbehari-Hazra.
I went there on Saraswati Pujo. It's a small place but is nicely decorated with posters of movies and songs related to 1969.
Coming to the food, we ordered the Pork Bhuna Paw. They've given 2-3 paws with a good quantity of pork bhuni. The pork bhuni was beautiful. We also ordered Nachos. This is when the owner gave us an option of having the normal typical nachos which we get at all other places or to have the one which they are personally making. We wanted a change so we went for the latter. It tasted different good different and they had given a cheese dip with it and we cannot complain anything about it, thus. The dip was one if the best dips I ever had. We also had grilled tikka chicken sandwich. Nothing great but definitely not bad at all.
Lastly we ordered Choco Excess which had generous scoops of ice cream, chocolate aauce, oreo and choco chips.
Overall, a great experience.
Highly recommended.

We were walking past the Kalighat Church when a friend mentioned this joint tucked in Greek Church Row and its name being kept after the Woodstock Music Festival of 1969 grabbed my attention so much that I insisted on dropping by for a quick evening bite there. And I was not disappointed!
I have a personal fetish for cafes like this one. Tiny, cosy, simple and minimalistic. Such a pity it was one of the city's typical sweltering summer evenings. Because this is the kind of place that would give you the warmth akin to what you may expect upon walking into a cosy wooden cafe in the hills on a wintry evening. Well, with the likes of Presley and Lynyrd Skynyrd greeting you, you know what to feel!
We weren't too hungry so we stuck to a a couple of Lemon Tea, a Virgin Mojito and a Hot Chocolate while one of us tried the Spaghetti Lamb Bolognese with Pork Sausage toppings (I wonder if I am getting that right haha).
The food was extremely well cooked and the drinks were fine too. However, I'd suggest them to give the sugar separately while serving tea because 6 out of 10 people these days tend to avoid added sugar owing to health concerns or merely out of habit. They, however, looked into it upon my second round of chai haha.
I am really looking forward to trying out new dishes here the next time I drop by! Needless to say, the prices are extremely reasonable and perfect for students like us with flimsy pockets haha

Wanted to see what all the fuss was about and I ended up with great disappointment. Went there a couple of months ago. Now this is a very small cafe located at the lane of Greek Church Row, Kalighat. The seating arrangements were immensely uncomfortable and clumsy. They had graffiti and pictures of retro singers on their wall with retro music at the background which was cool to some extent and also had a pool table upstairs. Now coming to the food we ordered :

#Mohito and coke float - Both tasted decent and quite refreshing. 

After having our coolers, we had to wait nearly an hour for our food and we were starving like hell. Finally, the food arrived and we gobbled it like bhukkads, so you really should skip my review on tasting because a dry bread could have tasted like heaven at that time. We had :

#creamy chicken sandwich - Tasted yum. Cream was oozing out of the sandwich and was quite filling.
#Masala pork wrap - Tasted good. The pork was nice and juicy with right amount spice. 

A very pocket friendly one, you hardly gonna feel any pinch in your pocket. This will be my only reason if I visit this place again, provided I already fill up my appetite from some place else.

The beauty of this place lies in its simplicity. The cozy, small interiors remind one of the cafes in McLeodganj/Himachal in general. And to top it up - great food with amazing music collection. I have been a regular to Woodstock 1969 for a while. So much so, that this has become a second home for me.

Coming to the food, whatever you see in the menu is delicious! I personally prefer the Spaghetti Bolognese and Monster Meat Burger. Good in quantity and great in taste. If you want something out of the box, try out the Bhojpuri Bhoorji Bhaat with Bacon or the messy Godzilla Sandwich! Drinks - Lemon tea is great! So are the sodas. And if you don't know it yet, they are the only ones selling Butter Beer in the country - that should get you Harry Potter fans to visit the cafe ;)

Price wise, Woodstock is perfect for school and college students, as well as people looking for a quick lunch/snacks. And, if you're bored, there's a Pink Floyd themed pool room upstairs for you to enjoy!

You can definitely go for this one on days when you're starving and hunting for a new joint feels like a Herculean task. Easy to find, sensible rates and good music will keep you coming back for more. Old fashioned trunks used as tables give a nice touch to the retro feel of the place, although one has to be lucky on busy days to get one. We had a simple egg wrap which was delicious and the Italian lamb ground meat sandwich is a treat for lovers of spicy food. Coming back again for sure!

The picture of Meaty Club Sandwich drove me to this place and I must admit that I was not disappointed. The sandwich was awesome. Probably the best I ever had. We also ordered cheese garlic chicken wings and strawberry coke which was delectable. The place is really small (only 3tables) and the sitting arrangement was not comfortable. The ambience was pretty good and the décor of the place was a bit different. I personally liked the graffiti of Bob Marley. The prices are affordable and they charge no taxes.  Overall it’s a nice place to hang around with friends. I would definitely visit this place again very soon.

Firstly, finding this place is not at all difficult if the directions are followed correctly- take the right lane just adjacent to the Greek Orthodox Church, walk for a minute and there u are... When we entered, we found place to be small with very limited seating. But I really liked the theme " love, music, peace & food". Coming to the latter, we had a meaty club sandwich, cheese garlic chicken wings and Strawberry coke.. THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT.. Service was also good.. will surely go back for more!!

The place is very small and kind of hard to find amidst the lanes. Anyway, it has an informal look. But I truly think it is an overrated place. We ordered a virjin mojito, pork bhuna pao and creme cheese pasta. The food was nice.   The service can be more professional. The seating can be a tad more comfortable..But frankly, I have been to better places and well Woodstock didn't live up to my expectations which I had had seeing the 4.4 rating.

Located on the lane beside Greek church , opposite Kalighat temple road. After entering the cafe I wasn't much impressed, but after sometime I made myself comfortable with the retro music. Loved those graffiti and the pictures. We had pork bhuna pao , creamy chicken wrap and gondhoraj gelato ! Pork pao was mouthwatering , loved the creamy chicken wrap also, roasted potatoes with herbs on side, delicious !! But the gondhoraj gelato stole my heart <3 Must try one! Will visit again soon.

This small cafe located in the lane adjacent to the Greek Orthodox Church (left side) @ kalighat packs a huge punch.The decor is quirky with posters of rock and roll legends on the walls.There is a separate pool zone upstairs. The service is very friendly and cordial. Ordered 

1.Butterbeer -Rich creamy butterscotch shake. Very nice. 

2.Masala soda -Was very well made and really refreshing.
However would have preferred if the drinks were a bit colder 

3.Cheese garlic chicken wings -Very yummy. Deep fried chicken wings garnished with cheese. 

4.Fowl cutlet -Mashed chicken fried with breaded crumbs and it was delicious. The chicken inside was soft and juicy. 

5.Gondhoraj lime gelato -This one is a stone cold stunner. The flavor and taste just amazing.

A few cons 
1.no washroom 
2.need to work on the seating arrangements (@present it's a bit cramped).

I loved the pasta and the Mutton cutlet was very tasty .

Sitting could be more comfortable...I wish they give more back rests and cushions...
but then for a small nook and an adda ..it is ok. 
The menu is reasonably priced and the owners are very friendly and warm. I shall go back again.

This is such a hidden gem. I made a plan to visit this joint after going through many positive reviews on this search engine. So finally I with two of my friends visited the café though they were not so sure of it but being a foodie I convinced them easily.

It is located near Rashbehari crossing, Kalighat tram depot, just opposite to kalighat temple road. The narrow lane adjacent to the Greek Church takes a right turn where you would find this very small café with a large name plate and a very interesting quotation with a sign of peace on it.

The name of the café has a significance. It's named after the three-day long music festival named "woodstock" which took place in the year 1969 and drew an audience of 400,000 people at New York. The poster of the festival had a picture of white dove and it said "3 days of peace and music".

Whitewashed wall and many photos of  1960's and '70's British and American rock bands such as Queen, Black Sabbath occupied maximum area of the wall. You would find Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash too. Few graffiti works on those singers were also there. So in one word it's a heaven for all rock and roll and jazz music lovers. Some of the photos are for sell too. A corner vintage wall clock gave a special touch to the ambiance. 

The air conditioned interior is occupied by 3 to 4 small cane or wooden tables with glass top and it can accommodate around 10 people. Though the seats are not so comfortable and all of them are cane stools. A narrow wooden staircase leads to upstairs where a pool table is placed and it's only for those who want to play. But those old but evergreen rock music would just uplift your mood.

After going through the menu, we were totally confused when the guy present there helped us. For drinks we had Butter Beer, Strawberry Cola and Bacon & Chocolate Shake.

Butter Beer- Well yes it is that renowned drink of "Three Broomsticks Inn" from Harry Potter series. It was chilled and refreshing with a thick froth. A perfect mixture of milk and butterscotch and it is a must have.

Strawberry Cola- It was suggested by them. But if you think it's a common drink having black cold drink with strawberry flavour, you are wrong. Of course it's a black cold drink but it is mixed with crushed strawberry which gives an amazing flavour which is very mild but unique.

Bacon & Chocolate Shake- Again suggested by them. The name itself is so interesting. I mean, a drink has bacon in it!!! Well it's a chocolate shake with topping of chocolate sauce and bacon. The sweetness of chocolate is broken by salty bacon and it made an exclusive and tasty drink. 

For food we ordered- Spicy Chicken Wings and Masala Pork Wrap.

Spicy Chicken Wings- It tasted amazing. Chicken pieces well marinated with spices and mayonnaise was a perfect snack.

Masala Pork Wrap- As the name suggests it is spicy but the outer wrap was grilled and crispy. It was served with spiced potato chips and tomato ketch up. It was scrumptious and a unique item indeed.

For dessert we had Gondhoraj Lime Gelato as suggested by them.

Gondhoraj Lime Gelato- Again a very uncommon dessert. Three scoops of white Gelato is sprinkled with ground peels of kaffir lime. It gave a bitter taste with the sweetness of gelato. But the surprise was waiting for us. When we reached the bottom layer,we got a salty taste with bitter and sweet tastes as well and it just changed whole taste.

So it was an amazing experience with tasty food which played well with my taste buds and great music which soothed my soul. Together they brought "PEACE" in me. And the cost for peace is within everyone's reach.

We went on a Saturday afternoon. The place was cool and cozy but a little bit congested. We ordered vanilla milkshake, virgin mojito and masala soda, all of which tasted nice. The Mexican lamb wrap was very tasty but the creme penne pasta was a little undercooked. The mushroom pasta in the menu was not available. Overall a decent place to hangout.

Nice little spot to catch up on friends. Quite an impressive range of menu to select from. Chicken wings were nicely done with perfect balance of seasoning and herbs not to forget the hint of cheese shredding to top it off.
The people were cordial and genuine effort to please the guest was quite appreciated.

What do you do when you're broke, need a bite and good music to unwind? You visit Woodstock 1969.
My friend and I were really hard on cash when we visited the cafe, through the dingy lane by the Orthodox church. It was such a pleasure to find, because it was in a really long time that I had heard some good 80s bands playing at a cafe. Add to that the lighting, the hippie graffiti , amazing poster collection and the pool room! However, they could improve the seating, it's a little uncomfortable and the furniture isn't too nice. We tried the much awaited Butterbeer, that was pretty awesome. I had tasted nothing like it before! Alongside, I had a nice, chocolatey Oreo shake and certain meat and Spaghetti dish that was a winner. I'd definitely like to spend more time and money in the little corner of music recently so found.
However, the last 3 times I visited, they said they were closed and so, they're not doing too well in driving off potential customers who love the place!

A lovely restaurant! It's a little hard to find since you have to go a bit inside the lanes but its right between the tram depot and the Orthodox church. A small but lovely place, the decor and ambience was quite cozy with hit songs being played constantly. The staff was courteous and attentive. The food was delicious and piping hot as it was made fresh. Each and every dish as well as dessert and drinks were wonderful with personal touches. The prices were reasonable too. A great place to hang out!

Woodstock 1969 is a small, music-themed cafe situated next to the Greek Church near Kalighat Tram Depot.. This place is an absolute delight for music lovers.. The wall paintings are worth mentioning.. The seating arrangement could have been a lot better in my view.. There is also a pool board upstairs for those who are interested.. We ordered a coke float, virgin mojito, classic chicken wrap and creamy cheese sandwich.. The food was good.. Though I was a bit @disappointed with the coke float.. The staffs are friendly.. The ambience is soothing with dim lights and soft music.. Price is okay-ish..Overall, a cool place to hangout !!

We were a group of four food bloggers visiting Woodstock 1969, a highly rated (in Zomato) eatery for some evening snacks and coolers. This place surely stresses on peace, good music and great food. The name of this little music themed café is of course based on the 3-day long Woodstock festival which was arranged during August 1969 at a dairy farm in New York. The rock festival was attended by almost 4 lac audiences and was studded with performances by Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Santana, Pandit Ravishankar, etc. The festival had total 32 acts performed. This Woodstock festival is considered as a crucial moment in the history of music and one of the most remarkable events defining the history of Rock and Roll. This eatery is located in an alley just beside the Greek Orthodox church near Kalighat Tram Depot. The eatery is an old garage converted to café, so it is not so prominent and one can easily miss the entrance.
                                                                ...

A tiny little cafe next to the Greek orthodox church, this is a dream cafe. The furniture is the only problem with the seats being too low, but with the extremely friendly staff, the delicious food you are only likely to see on the tlc channel, and the best (only) gondhoraj lime gelato I have ever had, this is a must visit. With extremely low pricing and a pool table for those interested this is the perfect hangout place that people have been dreaming about.

Man I was a bit skeptical in the beginning. I see most of these new places are reviewed by the friends of the owners and it turns out to be fake. Woodstock 1969 is just 5 mins walking distance away from my office and when I saw it in the the hidden gems I thought of giving it a try. What attracted me most was the different menu. I saw stuff like pork masala wrap, monster godzilla sandwich and many other stuff which I just saw in Travel and Living channel. I decided to give it a try. I ordered take away of Godzilla sandwich, pork masala wrap and bacon and chocolate sandwich. I wanted to have it with my six pack of beer so did not eat there. The first bite I took of the pork masala wrap made me realise that the total 600 bucks which I paid for the order did not go to waste. I enjoyed each and every bite of it. The godzilla sandwich was too heavy and I could finish only half of it , probably the beer just took away too much of space. Then the bacon and choco sandwich was also awesome. I must say I am really impressed and this is is gonna be one of my regulars as its near my work place and totally worth the money. A thumbs up from me. Really a hidden gem and hope it continues to be good and maintains the quality.

The ambience was really 'cool' and very cosy. The food was different and lovely. The quality of their food is excellent with a fun taste added. The pork pao bhaji is fabulous, the spaghetti ala lamb is a beauty BUT the dish that stole my heart was the gondhoraj lebu gelato. Would love to go there again and again.
Cheers. :)

A wonderful place to visit in the evening to sit and talk...the place is pretty small but the food they serve here is just too good...there was a limited veg item so we ordered a wrap on recommendation which was pretty good everything was perfect from the mayo to the stuffing, then there was cheese creame pasta, which was more than what we expected, nothing was over done,tasted good,now the strawberry coke drink was very pleasant.Being such a small place the quality of the food and service they provided was very good. Although there was a limited vegan food I would still love to visit this place again :)

Chandni Chakraborty , thank you again for taking me to this hidden cozy little place. Named and themed after the music and art festival of 1969, 'Woodstock', this cafe is too simple in its built to grab your attention in the first place. However, once you try their dishes, you might want to revisit the place again and again. We had ordered for garlic cheese chicken wings, chicken tikka sandwich and homemade ginger ale. As for the chicken wings, the taste of cheese and the flavour of garlic blended perfectly to give a tantalising feeling to the taste buds. The chicken tikka sandwich was deliciously flavoured as the flavour of capsicums and the chicken pieces cooked in the tikka masala were in sync. As for the cooler, I opted for homemade ginger ale, which proved to be just the best refreshing drink to kickstart the summer, with. As I haven't tasted much of the dishes, I would restrict myself to give 3.5 out of 5 to this sweet little place. Hoping to visit it soon.

Woodstock 1969 is a café after my own heart, because I am a Woodstock fanatic and would sell my soul to the devil to be able to attend the most legendary music festival of all times. The unkempt, bohemian décor is very theme appropriate. I love the murals and graffiti on the walls, the pool room is pretty effing awesome too. I love how they have framed posters and brilliant music playing in the background, it's a music lover's delight. Coming to the staff, they're pretty great, the service is as prompt as is possible and the demeanor is quite friendly and open to suggestions. Now, most importantly, the food is pretty damn easy on the pockets and its up to par. I ordered a monster meat burger, it was stuffed with meat and sauces and was pretty heavy too. The devilled eggs were pretty large and had a mutton filling, albeit the coating could have been better, but the filling more than made up for it. The pork bhuna paw is my favourite there, it's rich in flavour and a brilliant twist to your regular paw bhaji. The nachos are all right, hot and crisp but I especially loved the cheese-garlic dip, fresh made and piping hot.  The sandwiches are filling and fresh too. And I LOVE that they serve cola floats, which is a childhood favourite of mine. 

All in all I'll rate this place 8/10 and I'll recommend it to a every food, music and fun lover, especially college kids because let's face it we are always broke.

A little cozy place to chill with your friends. Very friendly people, you would feel like you are chilling at a friends house. Great ambiance, with frames all over which you can actually purchase. There is also a pool table on the mezzanine floor.
The mocktails offered are pretty cool different from others and also the food, the chef has done a good job coming up with new things to try on the menu. And ya... How can I forget the "BUTTERBEER" all Harrypotter fans will know. They have it on the menu :P
Keep going guys... Hope to see more outlets coming up soon.
All the best

Woodstock was on my wishlist for pretty long time and finally got fulfilled yesterday.Its not that spacious but nicely done in with frames of classics rock bands adoring the walls.ohhh wait they are up for sale as well. Music inside was commensurate with the ambience and they have a pool table in the mezzanine. We ordered for black coffee and crispy chicken. Service was quick and prompt. They have unlimited fillins of black coffee on the offer and crispy chicken was also done the way it should have been. Succulent chicken inside with perfect blend of crispiness outside. Loved it. Pocket pinch for 2 would be around 400-500 bucks.

Since I'm not much acquinted with this area, it was a great deal to locate it. So after a 10-15mins walk in the heat in search of this place, we reached to find a small little cafe. It hardly had three tables. Was feeling a bit suffocated for a while. Later, the music and the ac changed my mood. Although the interiors do not make me want to come back again, food wasn't a disappointment. Classic chicken sandwiches here are the best and most memorable ones for me. Of other things I remember ordering oreo shake, masala soda, chicken chinese bowl, and a burger. All of them were good. Expect great service and hospitality by some great people. :)

So I discovered this place thanks to Zomato.

Its located conveniently at about a two minute stroll from the Kalighat metro.
I had absolutely no idea about this place and was thus,taken aback by its size.
Okay ,coming to the good then..
We started off with Classic chicken wrap and Masala Pork Wrap.Well,we had just ordered patiently waiting for the food to arrive.It took them three quarters of an hour to prepare the food,which admittedly was good. Strangely though,the joint was not crowded at all.Wonder what took them so long.We had also ordered Arabiata Pasta-one each of chicken and ham.These two duly arrived another twenty odd minutes later.
Well,the food was good but the time they took kind of spoilt the fun.Yes,the staff was polite and well behaved all throughout but that cant really treat hunger pangs. Having these dishes we were nearly full ,yet we decided to gorge upon burgers.We ordered a Meatzilla and a Crispy chicken burger.Surprisingly,both arrived within fifteen odd minutes(pleasant surprise) but neither had cheese nor mayonnaise,which was a bummer.
That said,overall the food is genuinely very good,especially when you factor in the very reasonable prices.

okay,now two big downers for me.
One,cockroaches cockroaches everywhere.Two on the floor one falling from the ceiling.Definitely a sore point.

Second,a really shabby washroom.The lesser the said the better. 

All in all,good food led down by these niggling issues.

Had high expectations. Some were met, waiting for the rest. :D

Easy to locate. Lane beside Greek Church in Kalighat.

Ambience is awesome. And and and they play Dire Straits. Yay!

Nachos with chicken dip- Ample quantity, beautifully light nachos and smooth dip with mild garlic flavour and no excessive mayo that some places serve. Loved it. 

Lamb sandwich- Burst of flavours even though the lettuce at first bite was a no-boner for me. 

Crispy Chilli Baby Corn- A gem. Sweet and spicy, it was softly crunchy on the outside. They had bell peppers and a light garlic flavour that isn't too overpowering and the quantity is enough for two people.

Spicy Chicken wings- Beautifully crusted and doesn't dry out your mouth. I detest wings, but I just might fall in love with these! And the dip with it was awesome :D

Penne with Arrabiata- Love this. Ample quantity. Perfectly al dente pasta and a quirky flavour of mint sauce.

Barbeque Chicken Wrap- I didn't like this at all. The minty flavour just didn't go with the bbq sauce I think. Mint juleps sure, but not bbq. My friends loved it though and the chicken pieces were succulent. 

Amidst the great food there were some glaring inconsistencies, but I 'm sure they'll look into it. They said there was maintenance work going on and were pretty short-staffed. It took almost half an hour for each of the items to arrive. They didn't have laminated menu cards and it was difficult rummaging through what looked like xerox sheets. I'd also appreciate it if they would put paper towels on the table. The choice of crockery could be better although it does give a homely, casual feel. I wish the space was larger and the seating more comfortable.

Special mention goes to the potato wedges they serve, which are absolutely delightful.

This little food hub is located in the lane next to Greek Orthodox Church, Kalighat. Very nicely decorated with posters of different bands. Ambience wise its good. Heard the food is also good. We were already full, so couldn't try anything other than coffee and hot chocolate. Its cheap and I hope to visit it again. The only drawback was it's small space. Other than that its good enough.

Finally managed to pay this comfy little food hub. The decor is very simple and yet very lively. You get serenaded by evergreen tunes. You look to the walls and you see all the album covers you've loved all your life. The tables glow with tiny lights. The seats are tiny cute stools, the kind you would love to have round your own little coffee table at home. The food is incredible and at prices that make your jaw drop. The creme and cheese pasta was incredible. It was definitely one of the best I have had so far with the perfect blend of cheesy goodness and seasonings. They have Butterbeer! For a muggle who has grown up dreaming of Hogsmeade, that is a BIG deal! It is definitely worth a try for a first timer. The burger is huge with perfectly grated and fried chicken. The whole place exudes a kind of warmth that makes you feel good, that you went there, in the first place. 
And for the club aficionados, they have a pool table upstairs,

This is one wonderful hidden gem of a restaurant. Tucked away in an obscure corner of Greek Church Row ( near the Greek Orthodox Church) it is like the reward of a treasure hunt. The decor, the music and the total ambience instantly transports one to a bygone era. And the name! It so goes with the theme! It is just the place where one can hang out with a gang. Good food ( we had Creamy Chicken Wrap and Nachos with Cheese Garlic Dip, served in a huge bowl ), excellent music, quirky sitting arrangement ( old black trunks used as tables surrounded by low cushioned boxes) and an extremely warm owner-cum-host, things can't get better than this. We even bought a Queen poster adoring the walls (all the posters are for sale ). Coming to the food, it was good enough and extremely affordable. 

The only con is the place doesn't have a decent washroom. But I for once did not mind at all.

This garage turned cafe stuck at one of the quaint corners of kalighat is one of my favourite places on the gastronomic map of kolkata!! Having heard about this place from many friends I finally visited this place after a movie date with my friend. And I must say that till now this is the only place that made me fall in love with pasta. Now coming to what we ordered-
Penne pasta in cream and cheese sauce
Lat me kai chicken
Fried chocolate mono with cheese cake cream.
All the dishes that we had were just lovely. The warm pasta sauted in cream and cheese was a delight in the cold weather. The chicken dish was one of a kind and the momos where absolute love at first sight. And the guy who took our order (who probably was the owner) was really cordial. And the other thing about this place which is to die for ( specially for music lovers) is their taste in music and all the posters of legendary music bands that they have used to decorate the place. So to conclude, this is that one place which makes you feel at home and you can sit hear as long as your heart desires!!! 😊😊

P.s: they now have butterbeer 😁

Well...lets start off with the ambiance...perfect for a friends day out or a date with that special someone. They don't offer a huge space with 3 tables and accommodation capacity of around 12-14 people and band music and awesome wall paintings with band posters they make the perfect ambiance for a adda session.
Now, coming to the food...In one word awesome. We started of with chicken wrap and pork wrap...they were very tasty and considering the price the filling were fine. Next came in chicken burger and fried chicken momo and again they didn't disappoint us. The clear soup that accompanied the momo was excellent. The thing that costed the place half point was the quantity they served the combo bowls...the chicken bowls. I thought a more quantity could have been good considering the price but yess again it tasted very good. For dessert we took the gondhoraj gelato and was shocked. We were blown away with the concept and the odour with the taste was awesome.
In one word I felt the dishes were innovative just like the place is and may it remains as it was throughout the years to come...hoping to try out some more dishes on my next visit.

Damn, I forgot to review this place.Been here five or six times till now, haven't tired out yet. Tried their Mexican Lamb wrap, Masala Pork wrap and BBQ Chicken wrap. Pretty darn good, especially the first one.  Their Italian Ground Meat Sandwich, the Godzilla Sandwich (huuuuge and messy aka my kind) and the BLT Sandwich are all rather filling and extremely tasty (so worth their price). The bacon in the Monster Meat Burger (another big messy love thingie :') ) was overdone, sort of too chewy, but the rest was so perfect it's easily forgiven. The Pork bhuni paw my friend ordered twice was such a hit amongst us! (if only we could order it one more time). Their pastas are nothing to write home about, they are good, but that's about it. I did order an entire plate of Spicy Jacket Potatoes and Potato Wedges for myself, so much I loved the potatoes (my happiness was shortlived, 'friends' lunged at them the moment they arrived at our table). Finally I have also tried their Kentucky style chicken wings and their Nachos with a chicken dip.  Loved both of these, LOVED both of these, especially the nachos with the chicken dip (the dip was a clear winner amongst all of us! )

Choco excess was a nice end to the lovely lunches at this place! :D Will visit again, ofc. 

P.S. Photos will uploaded as and when I finish editing them. :)

THE FOOD THEY SERVE HERE IS FREAKING ORGASMIC, I KID THEE NOT! We had a burger, some chicken wings, potato and cheese balls, black coffee, butterbeer and hot chocolate. Brownie points for the unlimited refills given regarding coffee. I was however disappointed with the butterbeer and the fact that the place is soooo tiny. Besides that the atmosphere, the decor and the music played here is amazing. If all of this still doesn't convince you to eat here, they have a pool table which they charge you at 80 bucks for every half an hour.

Yesterday was only the second time I visited this place and this place has already got me hooked to its classic ambience, their wonderful taste in music, and of course, the wonderful posters of iconic bands covering their walls, and the best part? They're all up for sale!

Coming to the food, they serve really nice sandwiches and wraps at very decent prices. You can eat a lot without burning a hole in your pocket. 

I found the seating to be a little uncomfortable, and of course, the biggest problem is the space (wish you guys have a plan of expanding soon!)

In a nutshell, it was a wonderful experience visiting this cafe and I'm definitely coming back here. Cheers!

Located in the narrow lane right next to the Greek Orthodox Church at Kalighat, Woodstock 1969 is a place for the rock n roll and classic rock lovers! Right from their enchanting ambience and amazing music collection to their most amazing menu, where you will find the ice creams marrying bacon, smoking hot momos and mouth melting burgers! Definitely coming back here!

Woodstock 1969 made me look forward to college, and coming from a lazy-arse like me, it is saying a lot. The management is super friendly, and the days it stays closed, a lot of us return with heavy hearts. A quaint place where we can listen to good music and munch on delicious food for as long as we could, there's nothing NOT to fall in love with. I just wish the recent price hike was of lesser proportions than it is. :P still, love!

Please call the owners for directions or else you will not be able to spot this jewel. Located in a cosy corner , this joint reminds you of the retro era. The pastas are awesome and so are the wraps. Must try

A good place to go with friends for some light hearted talks and gossips but very disappointed with the food. Worst was the attitude of the Chef who doesn't really accepts mistakes. He says "this us how we make it here" even if the smell of the raw mutton will make you puke and white sauce will not taste tasty at all. Passion as profession always don't pay off well. The attraction of the place for young crowd is the pool section which is a part of this café.

Hi foodies!

So this place has been been getting some rave reviews lately so we decided to check it out. It was on my way to tuition so it wasn't a big deal. But this is NOT a convenient location at all. It's not exactly Kalighat either. It'll fall on your right when you go towards Hazra from Kalighat. 
Being in an odd location, this joint has to bank on word-of-mouth and of course, Zomato ratings. And so far, it has managed to excel in that by providing what matters most - good food at great prices! (with the added bonus of a pool table)

-Decor-
The place is tiny. Period. The owners have managed to acquire a small room of an old house and revamped it completely with walls entirely covered with framed posters of iconic music bands/artists. (all for sale). Some old trunks for tables and some very uncomfortable chairs make up the room. A very narrow fixed ladder leads up to the pool room (which is very cool) where you can eat your food too. However, there are no sitting arrangements in this room. Both rooms have individual air-conditioning which makes them very comfortable to be in. 
Also, a 5.1 speaker system plays some famous rock/metal songs. The owners are passionate about music and that's clearly reflected here! 

-Food-
1) At first, we ordered the SPICY CHICKEN WINGS. The owner (Somisubhro Ganguli) took our order at first. He explained that this was a Chinese preparation and the wings were cooked in a Schezuan sauce. My friend loves Chinese but didn't seem to like this dish. The salt was on the higher side and the Chicken could have been better marinated. Determined to not let this bog us down, we decided to try a few items but this time, we followed their suggestions:

2) GODZILLA SANDWICH: True to its name, this item was a grilled sandwich between which was stuffed a fried omlette, chunks of bacon, chicken and pork, cheese and dollops of one of the tastiest mayonnaise I ever had! 
*Note: A few concerns of this dish was that the Bacon strips could be better and also the price of this dish (250rs) did not quite justify the well-balanced prices of their other items in the menu. 

3) Next up, on the suggestion of the other owner (Soumya Mukhopadhyay), we had the MEXICAN LAMB WRAP. Caution: This item can be spicy so have it medium-spicy like we did. Honestly, I didn't expect the wrap to be so generous in its size and in its stuffings. The minced lamb was cooked excellently and all the flavors will make you want to just keep having it. 

4) Finally, based on the reviews of my fellow Zomans, we had the GONDHORAJ LIME GELATO for dessert. With three scoops of vanilla ice cream infused with the flavors of the king of limes (and shavings on top), this is one dessert whose flavor can't really be described. A #MustTry item; I can't imagine how much more awesome this dish will taste in summers. For 99 bucks, there can't be a better dessert. 

-Pros-
1) The value for money! We had all this for a price of 640 bucks. (All items in the menu are inclusive of all taxes) 
2) Cosy ambience. Even with the small space, it does not feel cramped. 
3) A pool table (Charges apply though, starting from 40 bucks for 15 minutes)
4) Staff wore caps over his head. This always gives a good feeling that they're maintaining hygiene.

-Cons-
1) Very limited seating. I will love to bring my huge college group here for my birthday treat but they won't be able to accommodate 30 people. So please think of more space fast!
2) Uncomfortable seating arrangements. 
3) The items on the menu are such they require lots of napkins. So please keep a bunch of them at each table.
4) No mushrooms on the menu. Even though for me, Bacon and Ham makes up for the lack of it, my vegetarian friends will surely miss it. They supposedly had a bad experience with a customer who was allergic to mushrooms and hence the exclusion of this item but I believe this was kind of a lame excuse. As a food joint, they have to keep that option open to their customers. 
5) Staff (other than the owners) seemed to be a little helpless and under confident.
6) Serving time needs to be improved upon. The wrap came after 30 minutes of ordering it.

-Verdict-
A fairly new joint which has started off well with a fun and varied menu and has great potential to do a lot better. Good luck!

-Bon Appétit. :)

This place is located in the alley between kalighat tram depot and the Greek orthodox church. You won't spot this tiny place till you enter the lane. I had to call up the owner for directions.
Coming to my experience, I went on a lazy afternoon to meet a few close friends who were running very late due to the pre puja traffic.
The place was mostly empty barring a few people chit chatting who I later gathered were the owners/owner's friends(?) They played a good collection of music and had posters and various merchandise for sale.
Coming to the food, it is very reasonably priced and the service is excellent.
We gorged on cheese chicken wrap, chilli chicken wrap, pork bhuna pav, chicken crispy burger,Godzilla sandwich, coke float and some other drink whose name I forget.
The sandwich is heaven on earth. The cola float having generous quantities of ice cream.
To top it all, the service is excellent.
I waited alone for about an hour for my friends to arrive. The owners kept making sure I was comfortable, adjusting a.c temperatures and music volume. Whether you wanted a knife to cut the cake(yeah, I was reluctantly made to celebrate my birthday but that's another story) or wash your hand in a no washbasin zone, you said it and they did it. Also what I found really sweet was the manager/owner(?) guy taking several trips to the kitchen to supervise the cooking.

I am sold. Definitely going back for more.
P.S-bigger groups might find it a bit difficult fitting in as my friend who I had recommended this place to experienced
P.P.S- the bill was 720 for 3 very hungry gluttons
P.P.P.S- even if you are very impressed you don't know whether to tip or not. I mean is the guy a manager/owner? Do you tip owners? Weird dilemma

Anyway, go to Woodstock if you haven't already

REVIEW EDIT
I think they mix something in their Godzilla sandwich,it is borderline addictive. Swiggy delivers to my house nowadays. I have eaten too much of their food by now. The chicken wings are to die for. Favourite home delivery place now.

Nice dark nd shady ambience. Music is good all about 60's 70's rock nd roll.Though I only heard dire straits during my whole visit. place is surrounded by the paintings of rock stars(the paintings r up fr sell) ..Food is good i wont say mind blowing but nice..Food amount is sufficient bt price is little high..Place is little cozy nd small hidden in the suburb of south kolkata.But its for the good u can totally hide from the noisy traffic nd spend a luvly time with close friends..there is also a pool table up on the frst floor u can enjoy that too.Conclusion nice place to hang out with friends.

I had read a lot about this place on Zomato itself and decided to give it a try today evening. I wanted to have the lat mai kai chicken based on the recommendations but sadly it was not available. However me and my friends decided to try the pork bhuni paw, ham penne arabiata pasta and classic chicken sandwich with extra ham and cheese. All of them were super wow! Specially the paw. It was amazing and one of the first kind I tasted. The pasta too was yumm with perfect amount of spice and sauciness. The stuffing of the sandwich was super yum. I recommend everyone to try the pork bhuni paw. Its amazing! The another great thing which will attract the caffiene addicts like me is that you get black coffee with unlimited refills for a price as low as 59 bucks! The service was a tad bit slow but the food made up for it.
As far as the decor is concerned, its a grungy tiny place with cool posters and paintings all over with trunks turned into tables. The icing on the top? It has a pool table upstairs! Now isn't that cool!
All in all a nice little place with nicer food which is easy on the pockets!
So foodies... hog on! ;)

Who'd not want to hang out with some great food and rock n roll in the background? Probably this city needed this kind of a place long back. 
Great aura inside the place. Small but comfy and the psychedelic walls with posters of bands from the golden era of rock n roll and heavy metal makes us drool not only over the food. 
As of the food, monster meat burger is the one you should head for. Crispy bacon with sausages is like pure love.

A perfect place for a hangout . If you want some good taste of music+food just don't to visit this place. 
Located just beside Kalighat tram depot. 
The decor & ambiance are just awesome.
They play some good music & the walls have pictures of Bob Marley & many musicians. But yes the cafe is very small. 
I visited this place this durga puja along with my friends.
We ordered nachos with chicken dips.
The cheese chicken dips was lovely.
Then we ordered crispy chicken
& noodle chicken combo bowl.
It was spicy, tasty & mouth watering.
The staffs are well behaved & friendly.
Overall a pocket friendly cafe
& must visit for everyone.

Went to this place yesterday with a friend and fell in love with this place. Some might say it's small place but it doesn't matter tbh as the ambiance is awesome and any music lover would simply love it. The posters, the drawings of music legends and the food all top notch and also pocket friendly. Will surely recommend this place and will surely be visiting this place again. Ppl saying this is an average place and small place don't really know the value of such place where you can have good cheap food, hangout with friends and hear good music, now that's a place worth spending time at.

This tiny cafe in the lane adjacent to the The Greek Orthodox Church is not at all difficult to locate. It's pretty cosy and they do not compromise with neither the quantity, nor the quality and the service is pretty satisfying. You'd surely not mind visitng this place. You could try the pasta, burgers and sandwiches.

A very small place located in the adjacent lane of The Greek Orthodox Church.

Very small

Kind of cosy ambience with posters of bands and painted Bob Marley and Bob Dylan on the walls all around you (which are all for sale), painted glass bottles etc.
(Also a HIT spray{cockroach repellant} across the basin)
@
Its basically a VERY small room of a very old house transformed into an eatery.

Old chests or what you call "trunks" im colloquial are used as tables . plastic bottles for water and very strong airconditioning
Upstairs there is provision for pool.

Staff(only one) was quite friendly and courteous. Tasted cream cheese chicken pasta. Isnt the best in the city , neither the worst. Being a pasta lover , to be honest i didnt quite like it.
Something worth mentioning is the music. There are few places that play good music. This is one of them
Basically, in a nutshell a small, cute, moderatey priced place to hangout with friends( the less the better in this case though :P)

And as you enter into this place the dim lighting will charm you with the rock-n-roll music from the 70's and 80's uplifting your very mood. The decor is just eye-catching with the beautifully painted faces of The Bobs- both Marley and Dylan, and nevertheless the kaleidoscope of chromatic framed posters of varied bands of that era is an add on to the ambience. 
Now coming to the food the Mexican lamb wrap had a delightful tangy rich flavour,the Masala pork wrap and  the BLT sandwich was mouth watering, and yes the pork bhuni paw is a must try for all alongside a sip of Mexican chilli soda. To cool down your taste buds Chocolate excess and ice cream with chocolate sauce would be a nice meal all together!
It was an enthralling experience with some gala adda with my friends. Nice service indeed from the cute guy out there and others as well ;)
Cheers !!!

This place is at a stone throw distance from my house & needless to say that I just love the fact that it is!!! 
Though all the dishes I had here over my visits and takeaways are really good, I specially love their Pork Bhuni Paw & Spicy Chicken wings.
The second best part of the place is the good music!! It reminds you of the lost 70s & 80s. The ambiance is awesome too as it compliments the divine music with all the wall paintings & the photos(Which are for sale) of the different bands that they generally play.
The only 2 downsides of the place are as below & trust me that's the only reason I have rated this place 4 and not 5:
The place is really small so you might consider booking a table if its available, &
They still do not serve alcohol which is much desired with the music!!

Boy oh Boy ! This place is just INSANE ! From the decor, to the led lit tables, to the menu, the actual food, the owners to the music . This place is Nirvana. With really quirky dishes (Pork Bhuni Pao, Masala Pork Wrap, Godzilla Sandwich, I can go on..) to really quirky drinks (The Mexican Chili Soda) . This is one place that I keep going back to happily! Only the fact that the seating is a tad bit uncomfortable and the place cramped with very less seating area are the only two things that anybody can find a fault with. They also have jugaad-ed their way out of this with a pool table upstairs ! The music is something, you won't find playing in any cafe in this city. They also make their own posters, which are available for purchase and are dopey as shit ! All in all, if you are one hungry head-banging carnivore, this place is your Mecca !

Tucked into the tiny lane between Kalighat Tram Depot and Greek Orthodox Church, Woodstock 1969 is an awesome eatery and a must visit for all. They provide delicious food items at very reasonable prices. Today was my first visit and my friend and I ordered a Pork Hot Dog and a Meaty Club Sandwich. Service was good and quick. Both the dishes were very good and filling. The pork was nicely cooked with suitable flavours added to it and the club sandwich was indeed very meaty - it had everything one can ask for in a perfect sandwich - bacon, eggs, ham, chicken, veggies, mayonnaise! The ambience here is one of a kind, the walls being decked up with numerous framed posters of bands and artistic impressions of various musicians. Together with the rock n roll music and the dim lights, it gives the place an unique charm. Last but not the least, the owners are very courteous and hospitable. I'm definitely going back to this place to try new stuff.

From their playlists to decor to food to the billiard board upstairs and what not is just fantastic.

A cafe is a place where people can talk freely with their closed once while providing some nice time to them. Isn't it be beautiful if you could carry the cafe experience into a whole new world with some soft music playing in the background, with some excellent quality food?
Horribly odd named Woodstock 1969 is a place that ensures you get the most rare authentic cafe experience ever.

Location : Unfortunately this place is not available on the map of Zomato, so its little hard to find. But with a little try if you could locate the Clean City just opposite to the Kalighat Metro Gate No 1 & locate the Tram Deport & the lane beside, entering into the Church Lane to the end & here you got the small yet fancy Woodstock 1969.

Decoration : The first feeling after entering to the place was "Wow" to me, Is it a Cafe or someone's music collection that is shown on the walls. The whole place was very nicely decorated with lots of Music Posters & wall painted arts that makes you feel you are in a different world for a few minutes. Some old furniture & mirrors that is used to fill this place gives you the feels of 1969. Where as some simple tin made box that we use to keep cloths or things are painted & used here as a table is a cool rare idea that I don't think you could find in any cafe. If you visit this place with your special one, music playing in the background adds a warm touch to your date. There is a second cave available on the first floor with pool board for a group of friends to enjoy. Posters were including a price tag that declares all those are for open sale.Seeing all this its hard to believe that this place were redesigned from a garage.

Staffs & Management : For a cool place like this, you will definitely get some cool staffs to please you with their recommendations of their special dishes. The service is very fast too. This aliens will make you feel comfortable in every angle into their musical world. They will even ask you about the food you liked it or not, all this shows they will be happy to get you as a guest for the next time too.

Foods : The real specialty of this music gallery is hiding into their food menu. As per their recommendations & other reviews on Zomato we ordered the following...

Oreo Shake : It was a soft drink that was made with the grind ed powder of Oreo Biscuits. It was very soft chocolaty. Very dark but very smooth, Cream fulfills the mouth well. Such a wonderful taste this shake can offer.

Chicken Tikka Sandwich : It was a dish that was made out of perfection. Well grilled chicken pieces were inside soft bread outside, that tasted really good. It was also served really well with some boiled spicy potato & Del Monte Ketchup.

Cream N' Cheese Pasta : The pasta was cooked perfectly, cream & cheese was melting into the mouth. The amount of spices, cream & cheese used was perfect. It was overall delicious.

Gandharaj Ice cream : It was such a pleasure into this music world. It offers such an authentic soft taste that is very rare to find. Gridded lemons on 3 scoops of Ice cream not only provides some rich smells, it also provides such excellent taste too. Scoops were real big so the single bowl can be easily fulfill two people. The taste of this will attract me every time to the place. Its hard to explain its taste until you taste it.

The foods over here simply touches the soul of your heart just like some good music do. You will surely love the foods of this musical world.

Price : All the above mentioned items cost us total of Rs. 426, where Oreo Shake was for - Rs. 89, Pasta - Rs. 139, Sandwich - 99 & Gandharaj Icecream - 99. The pricing was very well balanced & compared to other cafes it was value for money in some cases.

Conclusion : All the above mentioned presentation makes this gallery highly deserving for their tag line "If music be food for the soul, Play on." It may not deliver you the luxury comfortness of CCD or Barista but it can definitely impress you more than those places for sure, while offering you a much better value. It is a highly recommend place especially for youngsters for a date or a gossip with friends.

Woodstock 1969, tucked away in a cozy little corner in the lane beside Kalighat Tram Depot and The Greek Orthodox Church. The first thing you notice are the various band posters on the walls (which are all for sale) and the next thing you realize is how small the place is, with a seating capacity of 12 to 14 people. There's also a billiard table up top, rented at a very nominal price.
We tried the Pork Bhuni Pav and the momos. Food was good, a quicker servicing would have been better. It's very pocket-friendly.
Kudos to the LED lightings and decor. Their playlist along with the friendly ambience makes this place a must visit.

The food I ordered for arbiata pasta and chicken pasta it was really great I ordered extra ham with it and it was really nice. I finished of with peanut butter chocolate sandwich which was a new item and I licked my plate clean.
The decor of the place is apt with its name will be going again very soon 
Cheers guys keep up the good work.
Long live rock & roll ^m^.

Very easy to locate,on the lane between the tram depot and the church. The cafe has a great playlist and the walls have posters of rock artists and bands hung up on them which is for sale. Coming to the food, the special pork bhuni pav was great. The chicken pasta with arabiata sauce was a disappointment. It was very spicy and dry. And i hardly found any chunks of chicken. But in all fairness they charged just 99 for it.  Next, we had to order the choco excess with grilled bacon because it sounded new. The dish was two slices of fried bacon with icecream chocolate sauce oreo and chocolate cake. The bacon was rubbery but i liked the dish otherwise. 
Service seemed a bit confused. There is a definite scope for improvement. 
To sum it all up, this tiny little joint offers great ambiance with above average and reasonable food.

The very idea of turning a garage into this cute little eatery,turning something so plain into something so pretty appeals to me like anything. 
The music just adds to the ambience created by those walls-arts and nice lights.
For my first visit,I had the pork bhuni pao. It was delicious,though I would say a little too spicy for me because I am not a spicy food person.The virgin mojito was a relief after travelling for so long in the heat. 
Secondly time we had the meaty sandwich which was delicious. Sowas nachos with cheese garlic dip. The dip was amazing.Crispy chicken was tasty,but portions were too less going by the price.
Butterbeer was good,a bit too sweet though,but loved the taste.
And they unlimited refills of black coffee btw,which is great news.

Besides being this extremely pretty place,Woodstock serves food,lip-smacking food,at a reasonable price!

A hidden gem. A small place located in Kalighat near the tram Depot, take the lane between the tram depot and the Church! First of all, small small place. 2-3 tables with a seating capacity of 10-12 people. But the ambiance makes up it for it! They have a great playlist, and I found myself singing along to Nickelback, Deep Purple, Nirvana! The place is filled with posters which you can buy if you want to! Now coming to the food I ordered a Chicken Burger and a Chicken Wrap and Fresh Lime Soda! Food was served within 10 minutes. No complaints there. And it was tasty too. The place is really cheap, and there are no additional taxes. Give it a try and you will surely like it! Looking to go back soon as I heard they have a Pool Table upstairs! :P
And as they write on the bills. "All hail rock & Roll"

Awesome place. 
Absolute value for money. Went here with 5 other friends.We ordered a mexican lamb wrap, masala pork wrap, Creme 'n' cheese pasta, monster meat burger, spicy potato sandwich, pork bhuni pao and chocolate excess
Each and every item was JUST PERFECT. 
There were generous helpings of meat, cheese and the spices were perfectly balanced. The ambience is quite cosy and the staff quite hospitable.
The only flaw,if I HAVE TO find one would be that the portion of bread served with the Bhuni Pork seemed quite less.

This place is located in the lane next to the Greek Orthodox Church near the Kalighat Tram Depot.Since its quite small,we had to wait outside for around 15 mins before we got a table. But once we were inside, we were in love with the ambience of the place.Great music, really nice decor :D We ordered the cola float,the fresh lime soda, virgin mojito and the oreo shake. The float,mojito and lime soda were very refreshing but the oreo shake was not very tasty in my opinion, though my friend really enjoyed it.The pork bhuni pav is their signature dish and its amazing. A must try. We also had the lat me kai, which is a spicy chicken dish in Thai curry sauce. Do not try it if you don't like your food spicy :P Next we had the Chicken wings, which was also quite yum. We then tried the Mexican Lamb Wrap and Devilled Eggs. The Devilled Eggs had a crispy minced meat coating with boiled eggs inside and a delight for egg lovers and the lamb Wrap is for those lamb lovers who love lamb in any form. The filling is made of minced meat and corn with a surprisingly tangy twist. For dessert, we had Chocolate Excess- which is brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce. It was a perfect end to the perfect meal. All in all, a great place to go to when you are on a budget. I would recommend it to everyone :D

The wooden decor complimented with just bright yellow lighting and cool posters is a thumbs up. This little cafe behind the kalighat team depot lacks space and becomes cramped the moment all the tables are occupied. The food is decent, the pool on the masonry floor is a nice addition.

The moment I entered the place I just fell in love with the ambience. .quirky artwork on the wall and posters of English rock n roll bands.Went there during afternoon so it wasn't much cramped up. We ordered the speciality there. .The pork bhuni pav & cream n cheese pasta with ham.

Pork bhuni pav- It's a must have here.Soft bite-size buttery delicious pav buns went so well with the spicy minced pork meat on the side.Me and my friend was very hungry that time so we didn't get to click a pic of the dish.

Cream n cheese pasta with ham- The portion was unexpectedly a lot! We were planning to have another pork bhuni pav after it..but we decided to bunk it.The pasta was good..as it was described it was cheesy and creamy with ample amount of hams in it.

My only negative criticism is that..The music which was played here didn't suit the decor at all.They were playing hindi songs on radio.Some English rock n roll would have been really nice.

The place is very pocket-friendly too. Looking forward to go back here few more times to try all the dishes on menu.

Location: It is easy to locate. Its in the lane next to the Greek Orthodox Church.
Ambience: The place gives you a 1960s feel; as the name rightly hints at! A good place for music lovers :D
Food: Ordered Chicken tikka sandwich. Tasted really good. Next in line was the Cream n Cheese chicken pasta. Well, let's say I have had way better pasta!
The beverages (Virgin Mohito and Fresh Lime soda) were good! All in all, the food wasn't great but it was good!

Also, look forward to their pujo special menu (Malai Chingri Wrap and all)

A cozy little place, tucked away in a small lane between kalighat tram depot and Greek orthodox church. The first things you notice when you enter this joint are the numerous band posters hanging on the walls, which are all for sale. The ambience is bang on and the music playing is a treat to the ears, especially to the "band" generation. The food is excellent and the prices are quite cheap. I took a godzilla sandwich, which was not in the menu, and I was treated to the best sandwich I've had in my life.. complete with bacon, eggs and what not. It was difficult finishing one off! Then there were nachos, ice cream with hot brownies , etc and all of them ticked all the right boxes in my food diary. This place also offers a pool room, which you can rent by the hour and play pool with your friends. A must visit place for all those in the area. Only con? The number of seats is quite small.. so it might be difficult to find a place, with the puja coming up. All in all, an excellent experience. Do give this place a visit.

Its been trending on zomato for few days and my wife and I decided to grab a quick bite from this place.
Its hidden in the lane between the Greek church and the kalighat tram depot, popularly called women's Christian college lane.
This food joint is the named after the famous musical event of live band performance, popularly known as the "Woodstock 1969", I was reminded of it by looking at the interiors decorated with posters of famous rock/metal bands! 
Its basically a courtyard converted to a food joint. Its a small place but well managed,well decorated by the administration.
Coming to the food, we ordered a plate of chicken sandwich, lat me kai, chicken arabita pasta and a cup of filter coffee with milk.
Listening to some great scores we were served with the coffee and sandwich  immediately. The coffee was a bit cold n dull. But the chicken sandwich was bit of surprise. I dont like sandwiches; but this one, perfectly filled with tidbits of chicken, mayonnaise and cheese tasted awesome. It was finished in no time.
Lat mei kai followed immediately after that. It was a spicy gravy ish item of tender chicken slices served in tangy sauce. Though I am not sure if that's what lat mei kai should taste like, nonetheless it tasted delicious.
But the best of all of em was the pasta arabita.  It was served after a bit of time. It tasted perfect. Delicate pastas soaked in spicy tomato based red sauce and served with chicken morsels was too spicy and yes, the definition of delicious!!
To sum it up, it indeed is a hidden gem! Great place to hideaway from the bustling crowd of Kolkata during the upcoming pujas, listening to the great numbers they have and gorging on the delicious food they serve. Also they have a pool room upstairs!

PS it cost me 360 bux

So, Woodstock 1969 is pretty much the era I'd like to be in and the music to this tiny place takes me there. I love how accommodating they are and there's also a pool table on the second floor for people who like playing whilst waiting. Love the decor and led lights. The food is great , the menu is witty the atmosphere is nice. I'd actually give them a 3.8 because they still have room to improve (everybody does). But this place is pretty awesome ! 
Recommended: The virgin mojito and Godzilla sandwich oh god . That's a shareable club sandwich ... One can't definitely finish it on their own. It's rich and luscious and just amazing.
Thumbs up: the atmosphere is kickass. Love the led and the pub street feel.

This place was on my wishlist and I was quite keen on visiting this place and finally today we landed in Woodstock 1969 at around 6:30 pm. Located inside a narrow lane between the Greek orthodox church and the kalighat tram depot, this is a tiny cafe with a capacity of around 14 people. The place was empty when we reached and we took a table near the door which was brilliantly lighted. The ambience of this place is worth mentioning and the owner himself was taking our orders and was catering to our needs and he was extremely friendly. The best part about this place is that it is very pocket friendly and they also have a pool table upstairs. We had ordered a pork bhuni pao,two monster meat burgers, one Chinese combo meal and one spicy chicken wings and our bill was Rs 700 only! All of the preparations were just amazing, specially the burger, that's a meatlovers delight. Hats off to this place. Coming back pretty soon.

Woodstock 1969!! Sounds quirky right? Well that's the first thing that attracted us too. But after only one visit there, I can say this for sure, it was truly one of the best results of our food hunt. Not even 2 months old, this new shack, which was named after the great music festival of Woodstock in 1969, is a tribute to all kinds of retro music stars from the 70's 80's 90's. In fact, the shop was opened on 15th August, the day the festival began originally. On entering through the door one is greeted by the drifting soft pop rock songs playing lazily in the background alongside the warm welcome smile of the owners. I particularly being a very big fan of old english songs, was blown away instantly. The painted walls, framed pictures, the fishy in a bowl, it was all just amazing. The menu was equally tempting. A range of sandwiches, pastas, burgers, drinks n more to choose from. Our orders promptly arrived. The Indian twist to a keema pork, the pork bhuni pao was just amazing. The aglio olio peperacino pasta sprinkled with sugar crystals for extra fire, the cottage cheese sandwich one of the best I've ever tasted really, and the Virgin Mojito didn't taste like a sprite, the way it does in most places. But wait, it's not over. The cherry on the top to all of the above is the fact that the place is really pocket friendly, just what a foodie college goer like me loves. A place to hang out, even when I'm nearly broke at the end of the month :P So to sum it all up, really great place. Just a tiny bit of drawback, the seats r kinda uncomfortable. I hope they look into it soon. Otherwise I would have given it a straight 5

When I heard the name "Woodstock 1969", the quirkiness of the phrase itself pulled me to the place. The two of us set out in search of this recently opened place which has already ruffled up a storm of 4+ ratings in Zomato. From the ambiance to the food, we loved it to bits!

★ LOCATION : It is located inside the tiny lane between Kalighat Tram Depot and the Greek Orthodox Church. The owner, Soumyo (da) was really helpful in guiding us to his little "masterpiece".

★ AMBIANCE : The tiny place with seating arrangements comprising around 4-5 tables carries an overall theme of music, mainly from the genres of Rock and Metal (yaay!) . The walls are adorned with various music posters of different bands which are available for sale. A setup of overall dim lights with a brilliant concept of LED lights under some of the the glass tables illuminates the place. A little staircase goes up to a room with a pool table surrounded by entire walls done with Pink Floyd lyrics. A really exhaustive playlist of overall genre of music plays throughout.

★ FOOD : We decided to start slow, but the really filling portions forced us to stop very soon.

> DEVILED EGGS : Two big pieces of eggs covered with chicken and mashed potato was something really worth trying. A delightful start.

> KENTUCKY CHICKEN WINGS : The six pieces of crunchy, juicy fried chicken wings served with two dips was finished as soon as they were served hot on our table. Need I explain how good it was? I feel like ordering it again in the next visit!

> CHICKEN TIKKA SANDWICH : Scrumptious grilled sandwiches stuffed generously with loads of a Indian style grilled chicken.

> CRISPY FRIED CHICKEN ,: A very different type of fried chicken which was possibly the best I've ever had.

> GONDHORAAJ ICECREAM : We were really lucky to get a chance to try this gem of a dessert on the very first day of its preparation. The strong scent of Gondhoraaj Lemon lingering through the icecream filled with chips of real lemon was too attractive. A must try. Do finish it before the air melts it up. :)

Lastly, the fresh lime sodas were very refreshing and made just as we love them.

★ SERVICE : We were happily taken upstairs to the pool table to be shown the brilliant graffiti on the walls. Soumya (da) was a jolly person who helped us throughout the time there. Food was served quick as well.

★ VALUE FOR MONEY : A big YES! The prices look like they are catered perfectly for the college student's pocket.
Cost for two : Rs 300+ .

We loved the place. Lots of visits coming up. :)

Just came to know about this place yesterday, and couldn't wait to visit. It's only 1.5 months that they have opened so it was not crowded yet. When we entered the place today afternoon a sudden warmth wrapped around us. Didn't know was it the innovative interior or those posters on the wall or that small fighter fish in the bowl or those small seating arrangements or that lighted up table tops.. But I fell in love. The hosts were very very cordial loved the way they greeted us. People loving good music will definitely like the ambiance. The place is small and cosy.
Now let's come to the food , we ordered virgin mojito, pork bhuna pao, aop pasta, and cottage cheese sandwiches...
Mojito was as it was supposed to be with generous amount of mint,
Aop ( angliooliopeperonchilo) was too good, with chicken and spices
Loved the twist to pao bhaji with pork in the form of pork bhuna pao , there speciality
And the sandwich with paneer slices, perfectly seasoned , and crisp and that relish uff I loved it. And it comes with wedges
Only thing is the food is a bit too greasy , I am sure they will think about it. Food is decent in amount and easy on the pocket so a must go.
But one thing they should soon include desserts in their menu which I missed totally to sooth my tongue... Please look into this else I would have given a 4.5 cause I totally loved the place.

My best friend took me to this place. And I fell in love with it. This is a tiny place, with an awesome decor and great music. The greatest thing is the lovely food for such affordable price. We had an amazing Lat Me Kai, spicy chicken wings and fish fingers. The ambience is very nice and the staff helps you to make a proper order. It's simple and pleasant and I have a personal fetish for such places. They even have a place for playing pool. Such an amazing place in a narrow lane near Kalighat tram depot shouldn't be hidden from people. I recommend everyone to go there, it will surely make you happy. I am pretty sure I will be going back for many more times and dragging people with me.

It was a drizzling evening, when I and my friend suddenly had a craving more some good food. We did want a change of place to dine in and surfing through Zomato landed me at this page and I quite liked it. We called up another friend and decided to hit the place. 

Its a small eatery in a lane by the side of the Kalighat tram depot and can sit about 10 people at a time. Sitting arrangement is the modern cafe style with the decor being mostly based on the rock culture. 

We ordered potato cheese burger, chicken tikka sandwich, 3 pasta bolognese, 2 virgin mojitos and a fresh lime. the sandwich and the burger were served soon with the coolers and the coolers were really good and the burger was amazingly tangy. Quite liked it. 

The bolognese was served after a while and though was good, the bolognese sauce was a bit more spicy. Two of us were quite fine though my other friend found it a bit difficult to continue with the dish. 

To complete the experience we had some hot chocolate and would have loved to gulp down a few more cups.  :)

However, they do not accept cards, so be ready with cash friends. 

Overall a great experience at a very nominal price. 

P.S: Please,please try to make the bolognese a bit less spicy. 

P.P.S: You all are really very courteous... Am impressed and so are my friends!

A hidden gem in South Calcutta and a must visit for people who enjoy good food and old school rock music vibes! The food here is very economical without any compromise on the quality of food. The items are unique in their own way, specially the burger patty flavors keeps one guessing. Be sure to save some room for desserts. Overall the the decor and ambience is something that any 80s/90s kid would feel nostalgic about and would want to go back to!

It's really a hidden treasure..!!!

The songs,the ambience and most importantly the food won my heart.The prices are really reasonable n won't pinch ur pockets. It's managed by some educated young men,who are really well behaved and polite,we were really pleased by their 'non-austere' behaviour as u would find in some typical management staffs of a restaurant. They didn't even mind teaching us how to play pool(giggles)...probably this is the most informal review of mine till date.. It's a really good place for college goers considering the budget,the ambience and also the food quantity(and ofcrse the quality)..

we ordered non-veg combo
,creamy chicken wrap and fresh lime soda,all the items were well cooked and appetizing...Their only problem is the lack of space,but considering all the other aspects,it shud b ignored!
Keep up the good work! :) LOved the place and the food  :)

Whether you are into Rock and Roll or Metal, you have come to the right place. My school friend introduced me to this place, and I was mighty pleased with what they had done to the place. Transforming the ground floor of an old house into a music restaurant is a mighty effort. We started of with the Mexican Chili Soda which was totally not on the menu (Not everyone know about it :P), along with a Fresh Lime Soda. Then we went on to the foods starting with Chili Chicken Wrap and Creamy Cheese Wrap followed by a special item they had on the menu i.e. Pork Bhuni Paw. Try everything whatever I tried in the exact same way and you're gonna have an evening to remember. All I can say is, if you're a foodie and fond of good music, do hookup to this place. Plus, you get an hour of Pool upstairs at a very decent price. Its not only a great place for hangout, but also a pretty good place to set up a date with your girlfriend. Peaceful, Cozy. You get my point guys. :P Plus the hospitality and service you will get from two guys, Soumyo Da and Subhro Da is fantastic. The only downside of this place is that it is quite small. But I guess, nothing in this world is perfect. :)

A quite peppy shack located in one of the bylanes of Kalighat; Infact, one that plays great music. The guys have a great collection of posters and other collectibles that they sell. Space  is surely an issue with barely enough space for 4/5 people to move around. However, what they lack in space, they surely make up with the food they serve. I tried the devilled eggs, noodles bowl with chicken and arabiata pasta with chicken on three separate visits. The devilled egg comes in a humongous portion, in fact two large eggs on a plate. The mine filling is nice, though I found it a bit too spicy. The noodles bowl was fabulous. It's really a good old noodles combo meal available at other fast food joints, but the presentation gets the brownie points. Plus the noodles taste decent, but chicken garlic sauce that the noodles were tossed with (as per my request) tasted quite good and actually, better than most places where you can have garlic chicken at such a pocket-friendly price. The arabiata pasta was decent; however I like my pasta a bit more tangy and cheesy. 
The three guys who own the place are super courteous. It's a nice shack if you are on a budget and rock music is your passion.

My first visit to this place has made me fall in love with it despite the fact that the space in here is quite small and could be a turn down if you are in a large group. Other than that each and every thing right from the chocolate shake ,chicken wings , classic chicken sandwich that I tried to the decorations and the classic music cafe theme that they have created is enamoring. And yes! This place is pocket friendly too! Give it a try folks.

A nice, small place near kalighat metro. The place can be a little hard to find. The place is quite small, if you have a big group with you, might have to end up waiting. The food is awesome. The menu consists of different types of foods and drinks as well. The quality nd quantity is great. The meaty sandwich I found to be the best of the lot we had ordered. The place is very pocket friendly too. No complaints.  Thumbs up.

Excited on seeing the menu on zomato, visited last thursday... 
Directions - lane between the church and tram depot..
Small place - very limited seating capacity.
Ordered pao bhaji with pork bhuna, pork wrap, vanilla shake, hot chocolate.
The food was a great attempt in trying something different.
Shake was really nice and thick and the hot chocolate really appreciable.
What really struck us was how the owners put their will in this venture... absolutely amazing. Wishing them a great future and hope they keep serving good food all the way.

came upon this restaurnt in zomato quite by chance and boy i'm glad that i did. seeing the pictures i thought i hav got to try this place. so today me with my 4 friend went here at around 3.30 pm. 

it is a very very small place but with excellent decors. if you a fan of rock and roll and had been listning to the beatles, pink flyod, led zepp or the doors while growing up then this place is a must visit to all of them. 
now the food- we orderd the chicken hot dog, the mexical wrap, a bacon ham chicken sandwich and a rice with chicken .. taste wise good. i found the mexican lamb wrap very delicious. we also orderd lat me kai chickn and salt and peppr chickn and spicy chickn wings..the spicy wings were so good we had to order 2.

we were so full we couldn't try the meat lover burger. I mean munching on delicious food while "smells like teen spirits" humming in the background...absolute bliss..

the only let down was the small cramped up space. Hence when there is overcrowding you stop feeling the A/C..
The best part was that the dishes were so reasonably priced. Awesome place to hangout with your buddies or have a date ( if your date is into nirvana or bob dylan or pink flyod that is ).

definitely going to return again.. Two thumbs up!!!

Perfect place for school and college students to hang out,and since asutosh college is just at a stone throw distance,so its the perfect place for asutosh students. 
Retro style is the main attraction of this restaurant,with songs of bands like 3 doors down,GnR etc. Food is fantastic at a cheap rate,and there's a pool room too. Overall,a must visit for all foodies and couples.

This place is just 100 meters away from my home. The place is a small cafe with awesome music only the hookah was missing. We ordered virgin mojito, masala thumbs up, crispy chicken, masala pork wrap and pasta bolognese. For dessert they suggested chocolate excess. Crispy chicken was good, pork wrap tastes heavenly, pasta bolognese was also good. However, there was much room for improvement in case of the dessert which had a brownie which was not hot and was missing the crunch. Overall if you want to spend some time having some food other than the boring Chinese & Indian, its a nice place. Since, its been newly opened, there is scope for improvement.

A very nice place to hangout with friends over some coffee. The retro culture and the fascinating embellishments would make one more attracted. Hospitality is at its best. Fantastically fantastic food. Pocket-friendly.
The pool zone is another main attraction.
Yes! Woodstock 1969 does have the magnetic feature in it. A must visit place.

A great place to dine out with friends. The food is quite reasonable and delectable that exceeds your expectations and the rock-theme-based look and feel of the restaurant adds as music to the ears. One must try the Mexican lamb wrap and Chicken hot dog here that will not only touch your taste buds but also your heart. And the most unique part of this restaurant, is the pool facilities that too come at an affordable price. Certainly a great place to hangout with friends. :)

It was an absolute delight being at Woodstock 1969, a brilliant setup for hangouts with an equally brilliant menu with mouth watering recipes. A well thought out setup which again shows Kolkata's love for food and music. And the most important part is that it will not rob your pocket. I recommend Woodstock 1969 to every food lover. Pork bhuni paw is a must have. Keep up the good work guys. I promise to visit again soon . Welldone!

One of my good friends Ishita Acharya recommended this. I went there with Ma today evening. Both of us were charmed with the decor, particularly the minimalist yet gorgeous approach. The service was homely, and the food was very, very good at a very competitive price range. I am in love with this place and will definitely come back soon enough. A great place to have a casual brunch or a snacks date.

Wonderful place, lovely ambiance and a very quirky feel to the place! The food is delightful, the pool table brings a much awiated sports relief to the corner, the decor is so spunky and remniscent of the 60's and 70's that it takes oen to woodstock indeed. Overall its a nice retro addition to the city.
