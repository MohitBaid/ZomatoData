This roadside eatery popped up when i took a different route for my evening walk. This stall is quite small and kept missing my gaze whenever i passed this area while coming from sector5/Rajarhat to salt lake. A display board could have helped as its missing. They have home delivery service and they provide it well. The options of foods in their menu card is quite impressive. They also serve pastas, momos,burgers and sandwiches along with rolls, noodles, friedrice and various other chinese dishes that we eat as fast food. I have had rolls, sandwiches and noodles here. They tasted really good. The quantity served is enough to make you full. The level of hygiene they maintain is quite remarkable for a roadside eatery hence extra marks for that. I will keep visiting this outlet whenever i can. ðŸ˜Š
