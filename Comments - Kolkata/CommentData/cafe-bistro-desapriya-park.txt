One of the worst cafe ve ever visited. We sat on the cafe area and not the restaurant. The ambiance was not that great. Service was on the slower side. And we were served with stale pizza... Though they changed it after we complain. Coffee and fries was also not upto the mark. 
Not recommended at all!!

It is a small cozy and romantic place. But the food is not up to the mark. We ordered Crispy Fried Chicken, Drums of Heaven, Chicken Mushroom in Paprika Cream Pasta and Virgin Mojito. The Pasta and the Fried Chicken was not good at all. The Mojito tasted better than these but not like a proper Virgin Mojito. Compared to the rest the Drums of Heaven was good in taste. So, if you are a foodie, this place is not for you. It is a place for couples who wants to spend their time holding hands of each other.

Cafe Bistro, is a really good place to hangout with your friends, chill or even group study while munching on some Piri Piri fries.

Located in Southern Avenue beside the famous Mona Lisa Guest House, where the shooting for the famed KAHAANI (part 1)movie starring Vidya Balan, took place.

This place has 2 types of seating the 1st floor has the fine dine restaurant, and the ground floor has the Casual seating. While i havent been to the fine dine one yet, so i will only review the Casual part.

Visited there several times, with friends, and it is really a winner. The walls are all decorated with Bob Marley, Marlyn Monroe, The Beatles etc. The regular orthodox chair seating has been replaced by cushioned floor seating, with extra cushions everywhere and glass movable tables in between. 

This place is really good for group studies, as it is really calm and quite with slow music playing on your side. Order some fries or pizza and discuss and study while munching.

Pros : The serving time is quite fast. The food quality is good, if not the best. But the comfort level is a 10 on 10.

Cons : Ambience can be improved a bit, like one part of the wall can be decorated with posters instead of keeping it blank.

Food suggestion : Piri piri fries, Crispy Chilli Potatoes and Lime juice.

Cost : Easy on the pocket, very good for school and college goers. Pocket friendly.

Overall : If youre up for a casual out or some relaxed discussion, or some leisure time...this place is a definite yes. 

Soumen's Rating :-

Food quality : 3.5/5
Ambience     : 3.5/5
Serve time.   : 4.5/5

Location: southern avenue opposite Royal Lebanese outlet

Decor and ambience: a small space with recliners and sofas, dark lighting to give it a jazzy look with good music, oerfect for an only friends venture

Food and menu: bistro offerings and pizzas and pastas are on the menu, we tried barbeque chicken pizza and white sauce pasta with chocolate shakes and cold coffees.
The shakes and coffee were just ok and need improvement
The pasta was‚Äã creamy with the pizza standing out

Staff and service: just one staff who cooks and serves so the speed is a bit on tbe slower side

Overall: a small evening time with friends is the reason u cn go to this pkace and dats all u may do with this

Located near Desapriya Park. On the roadside. So it's a very convinient location.

Ambience - In this summer, what else do you need other than a cosy place to sit, good music and cool air. üòã This place serves it all. They had live screenings of IPL matches also. Played good music. It has got dim lights which sets the atmosphere so cosy. üòç

Food - Had Chocolate Shake, Cold Coffee, Pizza, Pasta.
*Chocolate Shake could have been more cold.
*Cold Coffee had less coffee and more water. It tasted so watery.
*Pizza was good.
*Pasta was yum. üòç

Service - It needs a lil check on this. As soon as we entered there was no one there. After we grabbed our seats, the staff came. Service time is good. But needs a check on the attendant. ‚ù§

Overall this place is good. So you might go and chill out there ! üòç

We went there mainly for a hookah & ¬†adda on my birthday but we were disappointed to find that hookah is not allowed for the time being. Food is okay.. we had pasta, french fries, virgin mojito & cold drinks. The reason you would like to visit this place is for the ambiance .. nice sitting arrangement with the gaddi & cushions.. light music.. dim lighting.. great for hanging out with friends. Pocket friendly as well. A nice place overall.

I attended a family Tilak ceremony in Hotel Bistro's banquet, it may b a little place they have but I bet it will throw a tough challenge to any big banquet in the city in matter to the food taste. It was simple, light & awesome. Chicken Rara, Fish Tawa Masala, Pulao, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Crispy Sweet Babycorn, Chicken Hariyali Kebab was so good. I bet the food here tastes parallel to any 5 stars of the city. Sorry for not taking photographs ;-)

Located next to the famous Monalisa Guest House, the entrance of this cafe looks good. Interior has shortage of space thereby making it kind of cozy and warm.¬†
Good for a group of 5-6. You will get decent mocktails, finger foods & hookah at reasonable prices.
Service is okay. Could be better.

A small cafe located next to the famous Monalisa guest house, is the smallest cafe you will find. It's a place where you can order hookah, mocktails and finger food. The items in offer is really cheap and a nice place to sit with friends. I even loved the quirky decor with Marilyn Munroe staring at you and Madonna in a medieval attire.

On one of those city halting Bandh day, I ordered a Grilled chicken, jalape√±o and black olives thin crust pizza via Swiggy and sadly it wasn't great. The crust was thin, but the topping wasn't great - a lot of cheese and ingredients but no sauce base to add some zing. Also, no oregano or chilli flakes were served with. Overall, not a great experience.

Me and my friend accidentally found out this place... Very easy to locate and quite a fine place to hangout with your friends...Though this place could have been a very good place but it has too many drawbacks to be one,as there are few things they should work on ...
They should teach their stuff how to communicate properly as all they do is nod their head even if they don't understand a thing,
Also A very odd thing they do is that they will serve your drink 1st and after half and hour or 45 mins later they will serve your food.. Also they don't have alcohol so having a mocktail just like that is not fine where you have to eat your food dry.. That's another thing that the waiter should know, even if you tell them to serve the food and the drinks together they will nod and will come back with just the  drinks.
Food is quite fine l, we ordered their special sandwich which is too much for one person but very delicious and for drinks we had the virgin mojito and pinacolada and coffee which was really good.. Quantity wise Wat we ordered were quite good.. Quality is also not bad quite fine..
Another odd thing is that if you need to use a rest room you have to leave the cafe and use the washroom of the restaurant upstairs...which is really weird..
Also very limited seating..max 15-17 people can fit in the entire cafe... 
So ya overall it's an okay place for an evening hangout...if they work on their drawbacks this place can be an awesome place for hangouts

This cafe situated at deshapriya park close to monalisa guest house(of Kahaani fame). The room is very dimly lit,  barely anything was visible. Horrible service. The seats were uncomfortable, low lying. We went there for hookah mainly. They took a good 30 mins to provide us with that. There was no one to attend us most of the time. We had also ordered French fries which took them 40 mins to get on the table. The ac was not working properly on top of all this this and it was the month of May so you can imagine. Would not go back again.

This cafe is very easy to locate, situated in the lane which is right opposite to Deshapriya Park. Just a walk of few minutes and then exactly beside the Monalisa guest house. The decoration is minimal and the ambiance is sophisticated and well maintained. We dropped in there at the afternoon time and the cafe was entirely vacant. They provide a very comfortable seating area on the red couches loaded with soft pillows. From the beverage section we ordered a glass of Pepsi then straight away jumped into the main course section. From there we ordered garlic chicken, onion, capsicum and black olives pizza and chicken mushroom in paprika cream pasta. Pizza when served was almost cold and it didn't taste that much good and that was a real disappointment. But in order to nullify the taste buds on the other hand the pasta was absolutely amazing. We chose sphagetti in mixed sauce and if you are really confused by the menu card what to order, then I would suggest you to blindly place an order for this dish. Staff management was polite and well mannered. Overall had a great time.

Sitting here writing this review,one of the worst service provided by any cafe. Unfriendly staff. Horrible food. Hookah took 40 mins to be prepared and had to be returned because flavour was burnt. Replacement taking another 40 mins. Cockroaches roaming around. A big no no and a mood spoiler.

Cafe Bistro, a small cafe situated in Sarat Bose Road, just near Deshapriya Park. A very easy place to find as you would just get this place beside Monalisa Guest House where the famous "Kahaani" movie was shot. The cafe was a disappointment to be honest. It was a real turn down from the moment I entered the place. Firstly, the room was too small and the sitting arrangements were done improperly as if they were forced to fit in that place with no space in between. Secondly, the AC was not working properly. When we asked them to adjust the temperature they couldn't do it as the remote was not working. Thirdly, the impression moved downwards as the menu given to us was half torn and that gives you an idea of the condition of the place. Fourthly, the staff was just stumbling with each question asked to him, as he took the order we asked him about few of the items but he failed to answer and went to ask the chef.
Though the ambience didn't fail to prove itself bad, it was now time for what we came for. These were the following ordered by us:

#French Fries: The French fries couldn't heal any wound as it failed again. Too oily and overcooked, the colour was different from the usual French fries and it was not good to be precise. They forgot to make the fries crispy which is essential for a perfect French fries.

#Crusty Mozerrella Garlic Bread : This was the first thing which gave the hint of something good. The crust was crunchy and the upper layer had a thick cheese spread all over. 

#Classic Cheese Corn Sandwich : This sandwich was well made and it was tasting good. Though the layer between the breads is little thin and can be thick with corn and cheese. But still this was one of the best of the evening

#Chicken Steamed Momo : Yeah, this turned out to be a hit. The momo was juicy with a good amount of filling inside it making it tastier. The momos were soft and melted as soon as it went inside my mouth. But the price was little over priced.

#Shisha (Ice Blue) : This was really bad. Actually they couldn't make it properly. And the list given to us had very minimum number of flavours. There were no double or triple flavoured hookah. The only thing which will get your attention is the price which is quite low.

LAST WORDS: 
As the place failed to impress me with there large number of cons still there are some positive. The price is much lower than many other places. The walls are attractive here, with posters of Beatles, Bob Marley, Pink Floyd all over. If you are a classic music fan you will love it. The place also plays some nice classic music which I really liked. So if you want to spent some time not giving pain to your pocket you can try this place.
Not Recommended

3/5 is what I would give to this place.

Located at a stone's throw from desapriya park, this cafe with a very simple decor is a must visit for foodies who love to munch onto yummy food though keeping a check on their pocket...I had ordered for french fries which though over cooked pleased my taste buds..Then it was turn for some cheesy breads:Corn cheese sandwich and mozzarella garlic bread;the later being so tasty that I had ordered for two of the same..I ended up the day ordering  one last plate of chicken steam momo which was a bit more costlier than the other dishes..But it was too juicy and tasty...
To sum up..An overall average experience..

Caf√© bistro. First time here. It's located near deshopriya park. It's a small caf√© but very cozy and comfortable. The first thing that hits you as you walk in the door is the decor. It's great. The wall art is awesome. Perfect in every way. The black lanterns and curtains sets the mood for hookah. The sitting arrangements are great too. Love the fact that I can put my feet up and relax. We went in for the combo offer. Hookah + piri piri fries + chicken pizza + 2 virgin mojito. The mojitos were refreshing. The fries were great. Hookah was nice and the pizza was just ok. I've had better. The staff was very friendly and attended to our every need. Service was quick too. Overall good place to send the evening with friends.

I can easily place "Cafe Bistro" among one of the "pocket friendly" hookah joints in the city. Located near Deshapriya Park, it is not very difficult to locate it either. The place is small, yet very comfortable and cozy. The lighting and the interior decor is proper providing us with a perfect environment for hookah. The hookah is pocket friendly but the drinks and desserts are not at all value for money. The pizzas are tasty, but not the best in city. I really loved their mozzerella fritters and crispy chilli potato as it comes at a resonable price and its very tasty. If you are looking for a good place to chat and wanna spend little, and try some hookah, this is the place for you.

Perfect place to spend lazy hours with friends where you can comfortably chat gossip even can take small naps. The ambiance..its simply wow, with loud rock music and those low lying matresses that gives you the feeling of being at home and dim light. I am in love with the environment.
Its a perfect place to throw a party where one can sit with buddies and feel absolutely comfortable. Ordered piri piri fries, pizza, virgin mojito and paan rasila hookah. Thin crust pizza tasted good and the staff was well behaved.
The only drawback I found is that they could have worked a bit more with the menu. You do not get to choose from a wide variety of food. And the place, it could have been a bit large.

This place is easy to locate. Yesterday was my 1st visit to Cafe bistro. The place is not like the name sounds. Small place. Decorated but small.only 4 grp of people can sit at a time. Ambience was good.songs were good too.
We took a deal from Groupon. We got a hookah , 2 drinks, pizza and piri piri. Piri piri is nothing but french fries with a diff taste.i liked the taste. It was good. Hookah was not up to the mark. Smoke was not that much. And we had to chnge the coal in onli 15 minutes. Smoke was very less. Drinks were soda sikanji and virgin mojito. Soka sikanji was ok but virgin mojito waas terrible. It was like basil leaves in soda sikanji. Pizza was ok. There were no seasonings! After asking they gave chilli flakes. Avg place. If you are looking for hookah and you are a hookah lover this is not the place.
Deal was good. But spending money on this place without the deal is not worth it. Deal was of Rs.329/-
They also serve alcohol if asked silently. ND charge a lot for it. But its given that they don't serve alcohol and bar not available.
They took 961/- for large 2 pegs of Smirnoff and 1 peg of BP which was too much.

Location: Near Desapriya Park. 

Caf√© Bistro, a sister concern (or managed) of the Ivory management was opted over a casual meet and the same was visited on May 29, 2015.
The AMBIANCE was nice yet, nothing great. Low height daybeds, a wooden plank with glass fitted on top; kept on the daybeds which acted as the table, wallpapers depicted the music world & lanterns to light up the place.

The FOOD range on offer wasn't quite wide, yet, was decently ranged. Was the range up to the mark? Let us see in detail:

- Piri Piri Fries
Crisp potatoes (cut length-wise) served with a generous sprinkle of flavorful seasoning (oregano, red chilli powder, salt and garlic powder) and chopped coriander. Tasted good.

- Nachos
Disastrous and tasteless in-house nachos served with a generous topping of warm melted cheddar cheese and salsa (tasted good) along with seasoned curd (beaten; a weird pairing yet, complimented well) on the side. The in-house tortilla chips (nachos) could be improved and the cheddar cheese on top could be reworked a bit.

- Veg. Pizza
The pizza was nicely baked with ample toppings to satiate the taste buds. Tasted good.

- Virgin Mojito
The mojito was perfectly made and helped flush down the meal.

- Chocolate Shake
The shake was nowhere near a sane expectation. Way too watery and passable in taste.

‚Ä¢ The SHEESHA wasn't quite smoky and choked. Disappointed.

The polite STAFF served at a moderate SPEED. The service could be improved.
PRICES were inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall an average experience.
- The beverages need to be improved and the presentation needs to be researched upon.

This place is just nearby desapriya park, serving mostly finger food along with hookah. The place is cozy and cushion-y, but quite small. Now talking about the food, had ordered their pizza and basil pesto pasta. The food was sizzling hot and tasty too, but the only thing that was not upto the mark was their delivery. We had to wait almost around 45 mins for our food to arrive. 
So overall a nice hangout place.

I got Basil Pesto pasta packed from this place yesterday since I was in a hurry. The food was well packed in the regular white box. It was piping hot. It was extremely yummy in taste and quantity was perfect. I am surely trying other items in the menu soon.

2nd visit to the place and was as disappointed as my first. To begin with this place is very constricted and you are likely to hear every bit of conversation of the party seated beside you. They have tried to decorate the place with some unique wallpapers but it doesn't add up with the overall presentation of pink Floyd, Beatles and Madonna with Monroe . they have a TV that they are not allowed to switch off, but they do lower the volume on request. The 1st time we visited we had to leave due to a sudden incident with a mouse. Yeah you read it right, A Freaking MOUSE , it crept up to the plate as we were getting done with our pizza and refused to leave it alone. I guess that should vouch for the quality of cheese that they use. The incident did give us something to laugh about but it also had us questioning the quality of the service. The food is nothing worth mentioning and seems to lack the taste and flavor that you are entitled to with their prices. The hookah is standard and I cant say that it was something new or extraordinary. The servers are however attentive to your needs and very polite.

Located in Desopriya Park, Cafe Bistro is owned and managed by Sheesha & Ivory. I went there with my old buddies for some snacks and hookah in evening. Inviting people to share a hookah is a gesture of friendship, much like asking them for advice on how to hypothetically convince a friend to help you move. The cafe sports a contemporary look with photos of famous musicians and bands on the wall. We found it was pretty empty, other than a couple on the other side of the room. First of all the ambiance is really cool. Nice, worn cushions all over the floors and low couches so you can lounge and really relax. It feels like your friend's living room- super chill & comfortable.

We were seated pretty quickly and had our hookah within a few minutes after choosing our flavours ‚ÄòBrain Freezer‚Äô & ‚ÄòPan Rasna‚Äô, amazingly quick. In starters we finally decided to have ‚ÄòPiri Piri Fries‚Äô & ‚ÄòNachos‚Äô accompanied with ‚ÄòMocha Frappe‚Äô, ‚ÄòSwiss Chocolate Shake‚Äô, ‚ÄòVirgin Mojito‚Äô & ‚ÄòBlush on Ice‚Äô mocktails. Service was bit slow, they serve Mocha Frappe & Swiss Chocolate Shake within 5 min but took 10-15 min to serve Virgin Mojito & Blush on Ice. Brain Freezer hookah was awesome in compare to that Pan Rasna feels pretty average. Piri Piri Fries & Nachos were munchy & tasty enough, side by side dips were quite interesting. Mocktails were so so, but Mocha Frappe & Swiss Chocolate Shake was good.

For mid course we had ‚ÄòSpicy Chicken Onion Capsicum N Coriander Pizza‚Äô and ‚ÄòChicken N Mushroom in Paprika Cream Pasta‚Äô. Pizza was nicely done, taste wise not bad at all, quantity was also satisfying enough. They had put enough chunks of chicken to please us. Chicken and Mushroom in Paprika Cream Pasta was also delicious. Overall decent experience though expected better, we will definitely revisit here again.

Cafe Bistro: Not as extraordinary as the name sounds
=====
Location and Intro:
Located very near to Kurry Club. To be more precise opposite foot of Barista.¬†
It is a very small place and decorated with posters and shining reflecting glasses. Good music though. The ambience of the place is bit quirky.
=====
Food Ordered:

1) Cottage Cheese, Capsicum and Onion Thin Crust Pizza - It tasted good but had much much better pizza's before. The paneer was fresh and not well marinate at all.¬†
It was nicely presented.

2) Nachos served with curd dip- It tasted different than usual.¬†

3) Virgin Mojito - Really not great preparation. It was more like limca with tulsi leaves and lemon wedge.¬†

4) 3 Paan Hookah - It was good. Lasted long but not very smoky. Did not choke.
=====
Pros:

1) Location
2) Music is good.¬†

Cons:
1) Service is damn slow.¬†
2) Bad seating arrangement.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 700 - 1000 max
=====
Summary:¬†
Food quality 3.6/5
Food quantity 3.6/5
Taste 3.3/5
Hygiene 3.2/5
Serving speed 2/5
Hospitality 3.3/5
Value for money 3.0/5
=====
Suggestions:

1) Not much people are aware about it. Needs a lot of advertisement.¬†
=====
Conclusion:

Would visit it in near future only if they improve their services.¬†
=====
Note: Unbiased review based on my dining experience.

Have been there following a Groupon promotion. Horrible service! Firstly they clearly refused the fact that we had a prior booking even after reconfirming twice. To top it, took more than an hour to serve a hookah... Or even a simple hot chocolate for that matter without any explanation for the delay. Food quality is pretty decent, especially the chicken and mushroom pasta. Would never recommend to anyone though.

Cafe Bistro is only a minute walk from desapriya park bus stand. This is a small place with cosy sitting arrangements. The use of two vibrant colours red and black is very much noticeable as well as appreciable. We ordered 2 cold beverages and a cappuccino which was good with a chicken bruscetta and a thin crust pizza which were mediocre. Very limited menu. Ambience is very good for a lazy evening. I wanted to taste their hookah but only orange flavour was available so didn't order. Service was fast.

Just off Deshapriya Park crossing, downstairs from Metropole hotel and next door to the Monalisa Guest house is this quain little place. The decor is amazing. Comfy cushions, almost divan-like seating area, pop wall art, red n black accents, mirrors on walls n ceiling, soothing tasteful music, all contribute to a very relaxing and chilled out experiance.
Place excels in finger food. Chicken mushroom pasta in white sauce was quite good. Quantity is a bit let down. Fit for one person n just so. The wedges are nice. So are the chicken wings. 
I wud visit this place again n again just for the ambience.

Cafe Bistro is near Deshapriyo Park .
Its a nice place but there was nobody except us in the afternoon.
There you get pizzzas ,pastas,coffee,tea and what not.
We had chicken wings out there which was very tasty and was served well.
We also had pasta with white sauce served hot and it tasted great.
The chicken wings were not boneless.
The place is decorated with mirrors and posters and wallpapers of Madonna ,Pink Floyd ,The Beatles and many more.
Hookah is available there and the price is ok .
Comfortable place with great food and time.

Well the first thing that comes in my mind regarding this place is quality at its best and yes the most economical place I have ever been  compared to other sheesha places . Ambience is amazing , something different I mean the way they have decorated with mirrors a new idea to be seen . No parking problem as you can park in street outside the cafe or inside the hotel . The hookah price I paid for is the cheapest price I have ever paid since last 5 years that is 210 (without tax ) with coal change . The quality and quantity of food is like you are getting more compared to the price of food you are paying for . I had spinach and mushroom pizza and believe me it was totally different in taste and was new to me and was amazing in taste . The basil pesto pasta , veg burger and yes the traditional cold coffee was also no doubt super amazing . It's newly opened so it's not known to everyone yet I guess but yes one should definitely try this place . Lastly it is actually a great cafe to visit .

Food tastes good,  especially the chicken mushroom pasta with white sauce. But the costs are a bit too much. Taxes will increase ur Bill abnormally. Dont try desserts coz they serve less qty. If u go for hookah, then dont exceed 30 mins,they charge extra tax after that#weirdly. The sitting arrangement is soothing, while u can nearly sleep on it. Overall its a #TryOut from me, but there are many good places around deshapriya park which goes lot better if it needs to be compared.

Located in the Metropole hotel, this new hookah joint/cafe belongs to the management of ivory and shisha. As I have always been skeptical of visiting places before reading reviews, my friends wanted to give it a try, as we were getting a really good deal. But I hardly knew that i was in for a surprise yesterday. I seemed to be in love with the place from the moment I entered. It's a really nice,small and cosy place, with low seated sofas, red and black cushions all over which made it even more comfy; somewhat monochromatic walls with one of it being decorated with posters of legendaries, from Beatles to Bob Dylan. For me it was a place where I could spend hours, simply for the look and feel of it.

We chose a corner seat and went ahead with our order. We got a Double Apple hookah, nachos/cheese with tortillas,
virgin mojito, pinacolada, and later a coal change as per the deal. We also ordered a Pan Rasna hookah, chicken wings and a virgin mojito separately. The hookah's were absolutely brilliant and strong. The mocktails were awesome specially the virgin mojito. The nachos came in good quantity, were cheesy and crisp, but the chicken wings were a bit not-soft-enough and was a little sweet as per our taste. 
The service was good and prompt, and our server was very well behaved and welcoming. They do not have a menu for the hookah yet, so the server narrating it to you might be a bit messy. They also serve cocktails if you are interested. 
Overall I loved this place and would like to keep visiting in the future! :)
