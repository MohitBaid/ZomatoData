Their chicken roll is awesome to taste n the green sauce are aswom. The green sauce make the taste delicious. Their chicken biriyani was also good and many time they offered some discount on rolls and biriyanis which make sure we want to grab their foods

Visited this place in DURGA puja'16 days at around 11pm with small place they arrange good decor for sitting arrangements with wall paints off kolkata beauty and in starters we order chicken soup which is thick and tastes good, golden fried fish with mayonnaise (in love with this, with so great juicy and softy tastes of fish) and coke for refreshing and order chicken biriyani which we found not hot at all and had to pay 180 bugs for 1 pieces of chicken kasha which I found very disappointing thing.

I visited this place with my cousins today..this place is very easy to locate..i have walked past this restaurant many a times so decided to give it a try!
Lets directly go to the food...it was okayish... Rates were okayish too. We had crispy chilli babycorn...it was a bit on the sweeter side not much spicy.. followed by chicken tikka kebab which was good but the green chutney is the worst i have ever had till date...next coming to the biriyani combo it was not at all warm.. biriyani combo had chicken biriyani chicken chap and 150ml pepsi...well they charged extra money for the combo but it was cold...next we tried chicken lasagna which was okay... finally we ended it with brownie with hot chocolate and ice cream which was good. 

Decor is not much appealing and service is the worst one i have ever received in any restaurant...it should not be termed as restaurant...the waiters are not available we have to get up and ask for spoon, plates and tissue paper. Waiting time between the dishes was like forever!!!!!

Well I won't visit again and others visiting this place should go for takeaway or home delivery... eating in is a big NO.

Chicken biryani nd chicken noodles were the 2 dish i tried for take away . the flavour of biryani was good but the piece of chicken they provided was smaller than those served in the streets of dalhousie. The noodles was horrible ...full of soya sauce nd tasted sweet . i just had a fork of noodles. But Would try their conti once ...

I really like this place. It's a self service restaurant and serves really good food. The pocket pinch isn't much either which is always a plus. It's a small place but the ambiance and set-up is nice and pleasant. The chicken mushroom lasagna and the Brownie with ice cream, is a must try.

This is a small Pocket friendly food joint located just opposite of Scotish Church college. If you are going low on bucks this place is for you. Visited couple of times, service was a bit slow. Their noodles are good, especially chicken schezwan noodles. They also have some cheap combo packs. But their signature is the desert, hot chocolate brownie with ice cream which is definitely a must try for every foodie. A must visit for sure...

Fatso's is a small cozy joint and a good dining place for the folks of North Kolkata. Located 2 mins from Hedua more, opposite of Scottish Church College. It's a pocket savior for all people. Ordered two of the moghlai dishes - "Laccha Paratha" and "Chicken Tikka Butter Masala". The parathas were soft but were soaked in a great deal of oil! This is where my rating would go down a bit. Coming to the chicken item, it was tasty, delicious though the chicken pieces were of the shikh kebabs (found a pierced hole in each and every chicken piece)üòÇ. The ambience was good. A small chilling place for all sorts of age people mostly dwelling in North Kolkata.

Food was okayish...noodle was a bit sweetish and more oily... Garlic chicken tasted like pan fried chicken...pasta was avarage..cheese was not sufficient... But the dessert brownie with icecream was the show stopper... I wld like to visit this place only for the dessert..lt was just amazing...

Today we went to Fatso. It's a hidden gem food tasted so good... At so pocket friendly price.
But unfortunately me and my friend experienced some bad things.
We're there, and other 3 girls occupying another seat. They were laughing loudly like insane and what we came across they were making fun of us for no reason. We thought we should report to some of staffs, but ignored it. 
I think it should be kept in mind that someone's fun doesn't harm other, the staffs should look after all these things.
Otherwise it's a good place

Whenever I think about fatso to go I have the mostly Reshmi Kabab , that‚Äôs something I like the most of that place  . It‚Äôs cheap and very good quality and taste . Rather than that I like masala tea and chicken sometimes roll , roll taste fine but it looks quite heavy and oily . If they use some better oil than this current oil,which absorb less oil on roll that will do good then .

This small joint near hedua Park surprises me a lot. They serves biryani as well as Chinese and Italian dishes. This eatery serves palatable dishes at reasonable prices. A small & cozy joint to hangout with your besties. 
We ordered chicken noodles, chicken lasagna and brownie with ice cream. 
The noodle was quit satisfying. After waiting almost 20-25 mins they served the chicken lasagna. It was loaded with cheese, corn, capsicum and shredded chicken. The dish comes with four bread slices with melted cheese on it.
Next is our dessert part and for that we had brownie with ice cream. The brownie was hot and fudgy loaded with chocolate ganache and vanilla ice cream. The dessert was just outstanding. 
Overall my experience was quite good.

Located near the Scottish Church College this place is very popular among the teenagers and college goers. They provide you with a lot of variety and it is quite cheap .  Heard a lot about this place from my Scottish church college frnds so visited it today and tried out Chicken Lasagna, Alfredo Cheese Pasta, Chicken Cheese Pizza . Much to our surprise the Lasagne was not well cooked and it was not properly made . There was less cheese in the Lasagne and @it was not firm enough and was served very badly. But the Alfredo Cheese Pasta was quite good. The quantity and the quality is not up to the mark.
Plus the service takes a long time. 
Not happy with the service. Not so generous staffs.
Definitely not visiting it again. 
They don't even provide you with a bill.

Adjacent to Scottish Church College this is the right place for youngsters to chill! Pasta, Pizza, Burger everything is at their fingertips. The taste is just perfect enough to make your day. It's pretty reasonable and serve in good quantity as well! I was in love with the non veg White pasta. Staffs r also good. basically I didn't find any negative point about this place. AC restaurant hence perfect to beat the summer heat!

It's almost walking distance from my place so evening adda in North Kolkata is a must at Fatso's!

It's a small little joint near the Scottish Church College, opposite Hedua swimming pool, on Beadon Street. I've been visiting this place for the last 3 years because I happen to live nearby.

Being a small place, don't expect too much from the decor or food. Ambience is pretty. Food is very cheap, certain items are really good, the others not so much. Their pasta alfredo is nice, its rich and creamy. Their calzone pockets are well built. The winner for me has always been vanialla ice cream with brownie and hot chocolate sauce. Cold melting ice cream on a bed of perfectly baked hot brownie, lathered with excess chocolate sauce, this dish yells LOVE in big bold letters.

You can visit this place if you happen to be in the area and are short on cash. They even have a take away counter for biriyani and roll, and their roll is better than your average roadside roll. Overall, it's not highly recommended, but a decent place.

I use to travel a lot here when I was a student of Scottish Church..
The decor is not that good..
It's cheap..
Food quality is also not soo good..
Earlier they use to only sell some fast food inside their place..
And now, They have even started selling kebabs,roll and biryani, it's in takeaway counter..
The staff I faced when I was in college was very rude and unprofessional..

Went to this place a few days back. small eatery, and had heard about it from friends a lot.
The decor was realky nice and eye-catching, with colourful chairs and tables and pretty pics on the walls. service was prompt and the young guy taking our order was cordial.
we ordered a chicken mushroom lasagna, baked chicken casaral, and a pineapple drink. the fiod came quite fast.
both items tasted good. nothing worth writing home about, and definitely not worth a second try, but if you live nearby and would like a quick and easy dinner, this will definitely be a good option. especially if you like cheese; both dishes filled up on their share of cheese. overall, good taste.
the quantity, though, was disappointing. Usually, food served in such restaurants can easily cater to two moderate eaters. but despote the fact that the dishes were rich and heavy, the quantity would be enough to barely satisfy one person. looking at the amount, the price tag looks definitely rather high.
avoid the beverages, though. if the oineapple drink is anything to go by, drinks here are extremeky, extremely sweet and thick. no amount of water will get the sickening sweetness out of your tastebuds.

This is a quite small restaurant with sitting and ac facility... Most of the time crowded with the college students because it's just nearby Scottish Church College.This place has seating capacity of approx 20 people.... The food is good but not excellent... Most of the food are very oily...but their North Indian cuisines are always preferably as I'm a student of Scottish Church College I visit here very frequently..the thing I hate is you have to do self service here and they don't even have basin to clean your hands... But it's very budget friendly. They don't charge any vat.Their egg rolls and chicken rolls are very nice overall a good place to hangout with friends.

It has become one of the most famous spots in the area for adda recently. The place is cheap compared to others in the area, and the quality of the food is beautiful. I especially liked the mixed sauce pasta which felt like the pasta you have at home and the one in the restaurants with a flavour of everything in there. The interiors are also beautiful, and the staff are cooperative and friendly.¬†
Overall a nice place to hangout with friends and not spend too much money. Moreover, they now have the ROLL counter when you can get a nice quality roll at a reasonable price. Plus they use good quality products which are very delicious and tasty.

Fatso's food quality is great, I must say. A bit chota but then again for maximum college goers it's okay. Their Veg lasagna and au gratin are a must try and Crispy Chicken. 
Take Aways for students or peeps with chota budget, this place can be very helpful for u. 
Thanks.

Well this is a very small food joint...better to say cafeteria...with various kind of foods snacks drinks and of course ice cream...the ambiance is good...but service is not so appreciable...though it is improving day by day...Me and my best friend love this place for some dishes...mainly their pizza...which costs only 110 rupees but tremendously tasty and cheesy...now golden brown fried  fish is another mouth watering item...u can go for crispy chicken...and another must must must have item is brownie with ice cream...I can bet that it provides the best brownie of Calcutta...which costs only 130 rupees...love this place...but avoid Indian food..as it is a new addition to their menus and not so cool...other wise this is a very pocket friendly spot for hanging out and it is totally tax free...but only cash is accepted...

This place can be easily located opposite hedua park.  The ambience is like a little cafe and it is clean. The staffs are helpful. The service is really fast and the food is tasty. The price is inclusive of taxes and is perfect for students. Recommended

Today i try thr fast food first time ... long back our college time it was a pastry shop n have good memories of scottish life ... after 10 year today i went thr and find out a new avtar... n glad to see that owners are same n contuning with same friendly nature. Today i try fast food part n proudly say one thing that they serve different type of ROLL which is totally seperate 4m others . Reasons are 1. They serve u chicken roll which is chiken slice with a tasty gravy... no one serve in north kol. 2. they only use a green sauce which w use to take with kababs/tandoori but u wl find it in ROLLs, no other use this type different thing which can gv a new taste to  the boring same preparation roll ... which change the whole taste n make it different... love it . Must try this üëçüëçüëåüëå

The service here is pretty good. And if somebody plans to be here.. he /she should try the cheese sauce pasta which is one of the finest delicacy here.

Small joint near hedua park, a little ahead of blossoms. Went there during the pujas. The place was more or less empty. We had time to kill. So we ordered two mojitos. When we wanted to pay they said that they don't serve drinks or desserts only. One must have food. That was something new we heard. Anyway we took crispy fried chicken which were more or less good. The interior was mundane like any other coffee shop with done to death concepts of hanging pictures of Kolkata landmarks. But overall the experience was pleasant.

2  mins from hedua ......this place turned out to be surprise for us three......
We dunno what came upon us three but we ordered around more than 5 glasses of cold drinks...hehe
Coming to food we ordered golden fried fish
White sauce nonveg pasta
Chicken lasagne with toast
Golden fried fish was so good we ordered another dish again. It's very tasty and even though fried not oily .
Chese sauce pasta was also gud.
But a little disappointed with the lasagne as the taste was on the sweeter side and the chicken wasn't suffice.
Serving time is a bit long but the stuff are polite. They asked us of our experience and we did say about the lasagne..... And very sincerely took a note.
I would have gone for a 4pointer but it's 3.5 for the lasagne

Happy Durga Puja to all ...üòÑü§óüòá
So it's Puja time. Every single place we were going for lunch,was full and with loooonnnngggg line waiting outside. I searched in zomato and found this place with a good rating and at a distance from the pandals,so thought it might be not so crowded.

And I was right...üòé,there was no line outside.üòÑ They allowed us to enter and we had to wait for 10-15mints as we were 13people in total....and one more table was needed.

They have a take away counter with rolls,biriyanis and also another counter to sit and eat. The accomodation is small..with a capacity of max 25-30people at a time. Colourful table-chairs with few posters in the wall...a cool deco overall.

It was 4pm,and we were starving like hell. üòü
We ordered crispy chicken,four chicken biriyanis,la66a paratha,chicken chanp,pasta with white sos,mixed fried rice,garlic chicken,chicken lasagna,chicken agratin,blue lagons and 10 cold drinks.
I personally ordered chicken agratin,which they said will take a lot of time. So I switched to chicken lasanea. üòÉ

The BIRIYANI was served within 10minutes. The quantity was more than enough for one person,with one decent chicken piece and potato. The taste was good,with all the aromas present. Liked it.

Next comes the MIXED RICE and GARLIC CHICKEN..the rice was tasty and full with chicken chunks and veggies,the chicken dish was also yummy. üòã People who prefer to eat less,one plate of mixed rice and garlic chicken will be enough for two. üòä

The CRISPY CHICKEN had 13-16chicken strips..crispy and served with fried onions and capcicums. It was finished in a moment. üòú

LACHHA PARATHA and CHICKEN CHANP was served next. The size of the parathas were bigg round and thick. It was finger licking good with the chicken chanp. Loved it. üòç

CHICKEN PASTA WITH WHITE SOS, was cooked perfectly. And I found chicken more than the pasta in the sos ...üòÑ Creamy,cheesy white sos with lots of chicken,capcicum and pastas.....another lipsmucking dish it was. üòÄüòÅ

Now atlast comes my order,the CHICKEN LASAGNA... quantity wise enough for one person. Served with two grilled breads with cheese on top. And I just dig in...it was looking so beautiful...üòÑ Melting cheese with every bite with pasta, chicken and veggie chunks.....it was perfectly baked...served hot. And I just loved it. üòçü§ó I was so hungry,it was finished in 5minutes.....the breads accompanied well with it,as it works as a taste changer from so cheesy lasagna. Though if you are not comfortable with so much cheese,or onions with cheese and pasta..then I would recommend not to order this. As it is a baked dish...and one of my friends couldnot eat this at all. So she went for ordering biriyani instead. So think before you order. Though I loved this totally...üòçü§ó

The blue lagon was also good and refreshing.. üòÅ

Our bill came...and it was approx 200-300 per head,depending on what each one ordered. I'll recommend this place to visit...the staffs are also friendly and well behaved. I am going to visit again here for their lasanea. Overall a good experience. üëç

Fatso's is a good quality cafe plus dining option for the folks of North Kolkata . And by good I mean it's decent but not top class.  It has a wide variety of offerings starting from continental to Chinese . People living around this part is well aware if it's existence and footfall is never quite a problem . Quality is better than customary cafes like CCD , Barista and all the bla blas . What's lacking is a little bit of tweaking in quality and attitude that could make this easily a top class cafe .

¬∞ Location :- This little dynamite is located opposite to hedua park on beadon street . 

¬∞ Ambience & Service ( 3 / 5 ) :- This is where it does not quite impress . It is not big and the decor is mediocre and the lack of a washroom makes it troublesome if you are in for a long conversation and sipping a whole lot of drinks . The staff was a bit inexperienced as he was not fully aware as to what was available and what not but made it in the end .

------------------------------
FOOD :- Quite well known for its sandwiches , cheese items and continental fare we were in for an evening snack so tried the below :- 

1. Masala omlet ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Decent omelete which was served with 4 toasts. The addition of toasts makes it a wholesome dish . The omelete had onions , tomatoes , herbs and it was quite tasty although it could have been a little thicker at that price . But still it was a good dish to try . 

2. Cheese white sauce pasta veg ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Once again the dish was good but not satisfying.  Somehow I felt have had better pasta in white sauce . Especially when the white sauce was overpowering everything , the pasta was less and it had a lot of onion instead of capsicum and no mushrooms . But still its a cheesy delight for white sauce fans . Still recommended .

3. Pineapple milkshake ( 4 / 5 ) :- Awesome drink with the a proper blend of  pineapple flavour in the drink . It was the highlight of the visit .

4. Cold coffee with ice cream ( 4 / 5 ) :- My partner loved it . While I had a sip and found it quite soothing . A very well made cold coffee for that price .

---------------------------

Verdict :- Obviously its a thumbs up from my side because the quality of food served is good enough and it overpowers joints like CCD anyday . People living here or somehow has visited hatibagan or girish park , if you are looking for a cafe you can always try it out.  

Following are the main points :- 

1. Decent food in North Kolkata in cafe style .
2. Tax free .
3. Cheese items are a yum .

Try out Fatso's and a word to the management is try to make it better as it deserves to be listed amongst the legendary ones .

Situated right opposite the lane where Scottish Church College is located it is a contemporary small place with AC sitting. 
Great food at pocket friendly prices and good adda is the prominent pro. Eaten here at least 50times.
Love all there items.
Stroganoff, augratin, pita pocket, pizza, sandwiches, wrap and all time favourite crispy chicken and dry chili chicken. Brownie with ice cream is also a must try. Mocktails and shakes are standard tries.
Owner is very friendly takes feedback and staff is ok. They prepare the food fresh hence waiting time is a little more but not bugging. Water is self service.
Con is during pujo and so they increase price and decrease items.

One of my "very new" college friends took me t@o this place. She, earlier asked me about my liking towards pasta. I said, I like it. 
But I actually didnt know, they here, make awesome white sauce and mixed sauce pasta. Omg. Also, we had some chicken preparations then. 

And guess what, now We visit this place almost on every occasion like, "Juto chire gele" , "Admit card dicche college a", "ei tor birthday treat ta de" , "pasta craving asche bhai" and blah blah blah.

Being a student of bethune college we visit the place quite often...they also have their roll centre and the sauce they use to make their rolls are not what you have been tasting all the way...they are a bit different and tasty too...here the taste of pasta is beyond imagination...specially the mixed sauce pasta.. also had brownie with chocolate... which was really delicious... dont wait too much to eat that, otherwise you will fail to feel the softness of brownie... but once I find the brownie to be overcooked... which became bitter in taste.... decorations are quite impressive... but some chairs being too small it's not a recommendable place for parents... the noodles and rice are also of great taste when eaten along with chicken side dishes... a must go place for college goers... the services are really very late probably beacause there are not many cooks... if you are too much hungry then go for the roll centre instead... the quantity and quality served here are satisfactory in most of the cases... In case of starters toasts are a bit high priced as well as the continental dishes and deserts except for brownies...never tried pita pockets, omlettes or shakes... the pizzas are almost of the shape of mio amore's which costs much less...
Recently they started providing chicken sandwich at the counter which you can't take inside. I didn't see a point in this. If you buy a sandwich you have to eat it outside though you can pay along with the total bill of what you have eaten inside.
Last time i had brownie in which the chocolate sauce was extremely sour. Clearly it was not fresh and good anymore. Upon asking about the freshness of the food neither they replaced it nor they discard the price of brownie. It was a huge dissapoinment.
The quantity and quality of the food has degraded over the years. I rated this place 4.5 initially but i am bound to rate it 2.5 because of its continuous decrease of service and food quality.

Located at Bedon Street just opposite of Hedua Park! It is a very common place for the nearby Collage Students and as a student of Scottish Church College I frequently visit this restaurant! The name may seem some kinda odd, but being a Continental Restaurant, they offers a large no of dishes!They also have a Take Away corner attached with this for Roll and Biriyani!

Service is fast during free hours and stuffs are all good enough! I tried many of dishes like Wrap, Pasta and Omlette!

On my last visit, my friend and I tried Roll from their Take Away Counter!

Chicken Roll - Well fried paratha, nicely cooked chicken pieces and served with their special green chatney sauce make the roll really juicy!

Paneer Roll - Well fried paratha as usual but one thing about their paneer roll is, paneer pieces are cooked in some kinda with green herbs and it taste really wowwww! The green sauce that they served is also finger licking taste,,I guess that sauce is their signature one! Very much recommended if you like paneer!

Bedside Rolls, you can try their Ch. Mushroom Cheese Wrap, Ch. Cheese Sauce Pasta and Ch. Cheese Omlette from their restaurant!

On conclusion, I can say the green chatney sauce that the serve makes every roll really an awesome one. I have tried many roll from various roll counter but the taste of roll that they served, no one can compete that! They served Biriyani in very nominal cost also and the price of other dishes are very pocket friendly! So you can try Fatso's if you want to taste somethinfpg different beyond traditional Chinese cuisine at affordable prices!

After reading the awesome feedbacks,today got the chance to visit at that cafe.Took cold coffee,chicken mushroom cheese pocket,chicken cheese sandwich.
U can get better sandwiches at Russell street or any road side food zone with half of the price and far better taste than it.And the pita pocket is became worst in taste for the red sauce.Cold coffee was only pleasurable to drink.Without that total waste of money and time.I don't feel to say more..

A long time wish got fulfilled...
Very much happy with Fatso's..
Their menu has different varities.. pasta, pizza, pita, sandwiches and many more....
I was craving for pasta (with white sause) since a long time. I wanted a place where i can get tasty pasta at a moderate rate. And trust me guys fatso's charges Rs.150 (alfredo pasta non veg)  quantity and quality both r too good. We had Alfredo non veg pasta, chicken club sandwich, and chicken cheese corn pizza and cold drinks. All 3 of them were amazing.. i wish i cud have tasted their brownie with icecrm but couldnt as i was full.. 
The place is good and easy to locate. It's just after 4 5 shops near to blossom, hedua park. They do take a bit time to serve but it's worth to wait. :) keep up the good work guys..
And their indian counter is equally good.. i got 2 packets of biriyani for my mom and sister back home. It was good. Might not be like Royal India or Aminia. But it was definately better than those roadside biriyani sellers. Price is also cheap.
Only i'll suggest you to expand your seating capacity. (Although a renovation is going on).
I'll visit soon for brownies.. ;)

Nice little food joint in Hedua. They serve continental, Mexican dishes(though Mexican items are few).
Ambience
Nicely decorated with BnW photographs of Kolkata and colourful photos of different dishes. Bright colours and different instrumental background music just enough to cheer the mood. 
Service 
Quick.
Price reasonable.
Food quality good.
Ordered paprika Rosa chicken pasta. I don't like pasta much but I very much enjoyed it. 
Overall experience good.

I must say their brownie with ice cream is really good but the biriyani is tremendously bad (half cooked potato, bad oily smell, poor quality and quantity). Overall the experience was not satisfactory.

Appropriate place for college students. Cozy ambience and pocket friendly food. But the chicken lassagna, peprika mama rosa pasta has just got me addicted. To start the meal, crispy chilli babycorn is awesome and to finish it off, brownie with vanilla icr cream..

This place is ideal hangout joint for college goers, starting from its canteen like ambience, cordial service to their awesome delicacies served by them. I specifically love their peprika mama rosa pasta(non veg), crispy chicken and chicken lasania. They also have a take away counter for indian and tandoor cuisine. In that section biriyani  , chicken shaslik and the kababs are really delicious. The place is really cheap enough and value for money

Located on Beadon Street beside Azad Hind Bagh (Hedua), this place is one of the few I visit after my swimming sessions. Reasonably priced with comfortable seating, they have an interesting menu. The mocktails and shakes are good, specially the Blue Lagoon. I found it refreshing after a tired session. The pineapple shake was also good.

Among food I liked the Chicken Mushroom Cheese Omelette. It comes with two pieces of butter toast. One bite into the toasts and you will know they put good amount of butter into it. I love these type of buttery crispy toasts. The omelette was also decent, though I would have loved it with just salt and peppers as seasoning.

The Chicken Corn Cheese wrap was a soft cheesy dish. The seasoning and the tomato sauce stopped it from becoming too cheesy and kept the balance. The cream served on top was tasteless though and didn't help the dish apart from the visual point of view. The stuffing was generous.

If you are around and want a quick bite, this is a decent place. Not worth travelling for.

I have come to know about this restaurant through one of my university friends. Fatso is just another restaurant with very normal atmosphere. It's like you go to a restaurant with no expectation, just to have some food because you don't have much money left in your pocket but it actually proves out to be exceptionally good. Must try #ChickenLazzania and #ChickenAugratin. The #GarlicBreads just added the perfect taste with the lazania and augratin.

This is a tiny little surprise package situated on Beadon Street next to Hedua. Too bad it did not exist when I studied in Scottish Church College right opposite to it. They make wonderful continental food. Their peprika mama rosa pasta and lasagna are awesome. The lasagna comes with cheese toasted garlic breads which are delicious in themselves. I have also tasted their chicken drumsticks and liked them. They have ¬†home delivery option as well Their service is quite slow but it is totally worth the wait. The prices are quite affordable too.

Being a Bethunite , this joint has certainly become a frequented place. It's located at a walking distance from Bethune college, just opposite to the street onlooking Scottish Church college and is one of the few joints that are cost efficient for college students as a daily hangout. Out of the dishes this place has to offer, the chicken lasagna and mixed schezuan noodles are my personal favourites.

Fasto's is located just opposite to the Scottish Church College near to Hedua Park. Fatso's name may seem odd to someone but being a continental restaurant they offer quite a large options from European, Mexican, Chinese, Deserts, Coffee & Mocktails.

I tried their outside counter that offers Rolls & parceled Biryani. As per my friend

This food joint started when I was in college and thus it has a lot of memories associated. Located just opposite Hedua Park, Fatso's is a delightful place. We still keep coming back here again and again for the delicious pasta they serve. The plate full of pasta tastes heavenly. It is a perfect place for food and adda for all the college going people. The decor is simple and cozy. I loved the sepia toned photographs of yesteryear Kolkata on the walls. Overall, Fatso's must earn a place in the Hidden Gems.

In an area where a quick bite means Mushroom, Blossom, Capri, etc., Fatso showed guts by starting off as a continental eatery. It's an intimate place with amazingly affordable dishes. You can't go wrong with anything cheesy here - Mexican wrap, sandwich, pasta dishes, lasagna, augratin... They are generous with the stuffing, too. They have Chinese on their menu, too, but the continental menu has kept me busy ever since I have been eating here. The staff is well behaved,and the crowd consists of mostly young college goers. All in all, it has given me the reason to go back every month ever since it was established, about 4-5 years ago.

I went there after a friend recommended me this place which is near to her college. Okay the first thing to do at Fatso is, try the Lasagna. After having that delicacy you can concentrate on ordering other things. The augratin is lovely. I don't know about anything else because I am still cherishing the Lasagna.

Tried their pasta in mixed sauce and veg pizza..the pasta tasted heavenly... Have also tried chicken roll and egg chicken roll from the roll corner... And it serves one of the best egg chicken rolls i have ever had.. And the restaurant do not charge any tax... This place should be visited by all pasta lovers

Being a Scottish Church College student,I ve visited this small food joint on numerous occasions and fall in love with it. 
I must say it is an under rated food joint in zomato...it deserves A HIDDEN GEMS category. üç¥üç¥üç¥üç¥

* Location : Just opposite of  Hedua park or Scottish Church College, this food joint is renowned for long years. So you won't have any problem to find it,especially they have opened their roll counter beside the outlet separately. So there is a big big festoon named Fatso's. ‚òï‚òï‚òï For college and school goers its a WOW food joint. Location wise 8 on 10.

* Decor : A very small food joint, may be for 20 to 25 odd people. But very much neat and clean and soberly decorated, colourful cafe. Chairs and tables are tiny,college canteen like. You ll feel quite a difference than other cafes. Pics hanging on the wall were eye catching.( rating 9 on 10) üëèüëèüëè

* Food : I started my review with this "it is an under rated food joint in zomato." I ve written it only for their quality and quantity of food. üëåüëåüëå Every food we took, there was an aroma of awesomeness. üëåüëåüëå We ordered
1. Chicken mushroom sandwich with cheese (You cant expect more better than they offer considering how the food joint is small). Very tasty and enough amount of chicken and mushroom were stuffed. ( rating 8 on 10) üëçüëçüëç
2. Alfredo pasta with white sauce ( you can never imagine this kind of small street food outlet could make such an amazing pasta. All pasta lovers must come and taste.) Lots of white sauced marinated beautifully tasted pasta. ( rating 10 on 10) üëçüëçüëç
3. peprika mama rosa pasta ( I ve tasted all kind of pastas in an authentic Italian restaurant.  I can even search a li'l difference with their taste. Just awesome ; very smooth,very good) (rating 10 on 10) üëçüëçüëç
4. Chicken cheese wrap ( you have to eat to know its perfect blend.) I must give the chef or chefs 10 on 10 as they are very well Italian food making trained. üíãüíãüíã
5. Chicken Lasagna with bread ( Its also very tasty. Beautiful. The breads were smooth and cheesee. (rating 10 on 10) üëåüëåüëå

Now for liquid items...
1. plain cold coffee (as usual. We asked for chocolate syrup in the cold coffee,but they couldn't provide it) (rating 7 on 10) üëåüëå
2. Mango milk shake ( It was very good, chilled shake, I liked it) (rating 9 on 10) üëèüëèüëè
3. chocolate milk shake ( This only item is a flop. I didn't like it at all) (rating 3 on 10) üëéüëéüëé

* Price : Moderate, not at all expensive. Perfect for pocket money having college goers. üëèüëèüëè

* Staffs : Its a small outlet, not so many service staffs were there. And we ordered huge,one after another. So it took some longer time to serve us. Otherwise they are very fast in preparing and giving your food. But little bit delay is always fine here cz all college friends come to have a healthy, time consuming chat and for fun. Staffs are quite cordial, well mannered and care for the guests. (rating 8 on 10) üëçüëçüëç

* Recommended : All kind of Pastas....all are equally very tasty. But m in love with their Alfredo pasta. Its a must try. üëåüëåüëåüëå
chicken wraps are also very very good.

* Not recommended : Chocolate milk shake. üëéüëé You would rather go for deserts. these are very good.
Lastly I can only say if this outlet with so much of their reputation can open another outlet on a big public road, it will be a super hit for sure. ‚úå‚úå‚úå @ priyabrata ganguly.

This place appears to be small and the space inside is actually small too.
But as they say, Don't Judge a book by it's cover, this place serves good quality food with so reasonable prices.
Tried the Golden Fried Fish, it's yum yum !
The Chicken Sandwich with cheese and chicken cheese wrap was no less. 
Last of all, being a cold-coffee lover, I found their cold coffee satisfactory.

So chota packet bada dhamaka, is no joke han !! Keep going. :)

I have visited this place on saptami after long session of pandal hopping in north Kolkata.Its a small restaurant near hedua park.U have to serve water for yourself here.The ambience wasn't anything to brag about.Service was slow too.But the food was awesome.We ordered crispy chilli babycorn for starter & chicken lasagna for main course. 

Crispy chilli babycorn-The babycorns were crunchy and tossed in a delicious spicy sauce.Really enjoyed it.

Chicken lasagna- OMG! It's like a paradise in mouth kind of dish for people who love cheese.The top part was mildly crisp and u slowly break into layers of pure cheesy and creamy indulgence.The amount of chicken pieces in it was adequate too.They serve cheese and garlic toasts on sides which were a nice addition.

We were so full that we couldn't have desserts.
It's a good place to visit to have continental food in North kolkata area.

Never thought I could get to eat such great Continental fare in north kolkata, let alone Hatibagan. Oh, how wrong I was! 
The pizzas, the pastas, the 'lasanias', the au gratins, you name it, they make it. And they Make it REALLY GOOD. My personal favorite is the chicken mixed sauce pasta-  SO cheesy, with plenty of succulent bits of chicken. A must visit place. Good ambience, friendly staff, reasonable prices. Overall a great joint.

The roll counter is quite affordable.Mutton tastes delicious.Resmi Kebab is fine too.

Being a Caledonian, visit to Fatso's is a must. The sitting area of the restaurant is small but the food is quite okay for it's price. The Egg chicken Fried rice is good and so is the Chicken Alfredo Pasta and the Crispy Chilli Babycorn. The Chilli Chicken here is average and the Pizza is just a no-no because they make it very crispy and it feels like biscuit. But overall, a nice place to enjoy the break time.

This place is an absolute delight. Not much for decor, but who cares when you get to eat such GOOD food at such low rates? Visited Fatso's yesterday with a bunch of close friends, food was as I said just now, absolutely yummy, and the brownie with ice cream was just SINFUL. Continental lovers with a pocket that needs constant watching (just like mine), this is the place for you! Hog to your heart's content.

This cozy place serving continental dishes and an ideal atmosphere for "adda" is located just beside Hedua park and is a popular hangout of teenagers and people in there early twenties. The food is quite delicious especially the crepes and Peprika-mama-rosa. My personal fav dessert is Brownie Sundae with hot chocolate sauce The menu has been unfortunately cut short due to some unknown reason and many dishes are currently not available. Waiting for Fatso to return to its former self and looking forward to many cheese-i-licious encounters..

Heard a lot about this place from my Calcutta University friends and was planning since a while to visit Fatso's. Located near Hedua Park, it's a very small restaurant. The ambiance is OK, so as the behavior of the staffs.
But the food deserves superlative appreciation because of it's taste & quantity. We tried Alfredo White Sauce pasta (non veg) and Chicken Mushroom Cheese Pita Pocket. It was my first official attempt of tasting continental dishes and both of them were delicious, the amount of cheese in the Pita pocket and the thickness of the white sauce in Pasta made the dishes yummy! Very pocket friendly, a must try for all (specially for the students with low pocket money) who want to savour some alternative cuisine :)

In North Kolkata, most of the people are not used to have continental cuisine in the evening as that region has a legacy in making Chop,Kachuri and Fries with a supreme quality of taste however if they want to change their taste into continental cuisine, this place could be the best option to opt for.
I went to this place few years back and have pretty good memories with it as well.
The place is small however the lights and photos creates a soothing ambience. 
Waiters treated really well their customers which is a big advantage of this place.
I found three items over here which are hidden however they have the capability to climb up and rank between 1 to 5.
1. Golden Fried Fish - They use proper vetki to make this dish and fried it with onions. Served this with mayonese. The heaven like juicyness of the marinated fish will make you to orser another plate, that I can bet.
2. Crispy Chicken - It is very spicy however it maintains the sweet n sour part properly. Chickens come into strips, marinated by the spices. Tastes YUMMY!!
3. Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream -
Well, no description is enough to describe this dish. It is an orgasm between chocolate and vanilla which results a heavenly taste. Trust me one is not enough and if you love chocolate a lot then this thing will bring you again and again.
It is kind of a place which carries nosta@lgia of North Kolkata and one can bring their friends or loved ones to have continental dishes within a reasonable price.

'Absolutely stunning' is the only phrase that defines the food quality of this mini outlet. The initial decors were cool and was best suited for an 'adda' like atmosphere. But the decor is presently a shadow of its past. I would still advice... if you can shut your eyes and ONLY concentrate on Food, this place is one which you'll visit and revisit and will definitely keep visiting. Its pizzas beat the hotshots like Domino's and Pizza Hut. The prices are reasonable.
Special Recommendation : Go for Golden Fried Fish, Chicken Cheese Mushroom Sandwich and a Capucchino!

Amazing amazing continental food!
Golden fried fish, Chicken Lasania, Chicken Lebanese rice and even their brownie. Delicious yet cheap. Easy on pockets this place is highly recommended if you are a foodie who loves Continental. Though the sitting and ambience is below average and service is too homely to digest. But but but who cares when you can have such good food at such low price.

P.S. On my latest visit to Fatso's after a few months disappointment took me like anything. The food quality has dropped, so is the service. The Chicken Stroganoff was not properly cooked. The service was awful. Only the Chicken lolypop was okay. Pushed me to this level I had to change ta rating.

The interiors are simple, clean yet extremely soothing to the eyes. It's a pocket friendly outlet for a group of friends to chill and enjoy good food or a couple to spend peaceful, romantic time. The service is quick. Pita Pockets are a must try. Even the Chinese is good, both taste and quantity wise. Mexican wrap was satisfactory. This place definitely shows potential, being pleasant to the eyes, taste buds and pocket. Will surely go again to try other continental food.

A small, simply decorated but clean cafe offering a large variety from simple chinese to mexican, italian etc. We went at around 1pm on a summer weekday and much to our surprise, the interior was air- conditioned. 
We ordered mexican chicken cheese wrap and white sauce pasta with blue lagoon mocktail. Wrap and pasta both were good and satisfactory quantity wise. But the blue lagoon was not at all up to the mark. 
Might go back to try other items from continental menu.

A nice, cozy place to be with friends... Really we needed a place to eat and talk, (and other places do not give us much time) went to Fatso's and spent almost 2hours without any interruption over mixed fried rice, chicken manchurian, and chicken augratin. They took time to serve the food, which was good as that gave us much time to have an adda. We sat on the moras, which was like sitting in a friend's house. The food was really good, loved the augratin. Will go again for sure... and yes very very pocket friendly.

Amazing white sauce pasta. I have visited this place quite a few times and have had to order white sauce pasta every time because my girlfriend just loves it. A very small joint near hedua and a couple of steps away from Scottish church college, the place is very homely and a place you can sit and relax for hours. The food is good and won't disappoint you. The charm of this place is that they uphold the adda culture with a blend of Italian cuisine.

One place I so wish would be located in south Kolkata as well. A cheese lover's den and a pocket saviour for all the students from the nearby colleges. A small air conditioned hangout with a little of everything youngsters will love. No stuffing your bellies with the same old food anymore, from a wide variety of continental ranging from lasagnia, augratin, casserole, pasta.. To a dash of Chinese, a little mocha to chit chat over, omelets oozing cheese, and the hot chocolate brownie to top it all, for all the sweet tooths out there. Yum for taste and a big thumbs up for not burning the pockets.

If you love cheese, there's no better place you can be. I have tried Augratin, Lasagna, Alfredo pasta and Chocolate Ice-cream Brownie. The Brownie is one of the best of their preparations. You might want to save some room for it. It is a must have. And surprisingly cheap.

Though all the three were equally good, I liked the second item more. Dishes are extremely affordable and serivce is praise worthy. However, the interior decoration could have been a bit better. Anyway, I'm looking forward to more visits :)

I was recommended this place by a friend and I went there.
Pros:
1. Wide range of Menu with mouth watering names
2. Cheap items (some are costly)
3. Brownie with Ice-cream. MUST HAVE. (Although you would find it a little costly compared to other dessert outlets)
Cons:
1. Bad, bad interior decoration.
2. Bad, bad service (twice they gave us something the other table ordered for)
3. Bad, bad unhygienic glasses (c'mon, plastic?)
4. Bad, bad delivery charges.
Would I go? Only to try out the desserts!

Went there a few months ago on a friend's tantrum. The ambiance and especially the decor are epic failures. The decor is pretty unimpressive and shows lack of dedication and ideas of the interior designing team. Now lets come to the main thing, that is, the food. But alas! The food too fails to impress given its hefty price tag compared to the little quantity ( 3 scoops) that was served to us. We ordered two Brownie with chocolate and ice creams. The first one did not appear fresh and was not even properly styled. The second one was okay. The dishes were nothing special. But seriously for 90 inr, the amount served was too little compared to other dessert outlets in Kolkata. I certainly would not recommend this place for desserts.

The continental items were really good..For dessert item I have my customized choice ... Brownie with 2 scoops vanilla ice-creme. ¬†It's yammy ..

Fatso is  a small restro or rather a hangout place for people located near Hedua Swimming Pool. The place is quite easy to locate who knows the area around Scottish Church College, Hedua or Ramdulal Sarkar Street. I went to this place with some of my friends. We ordered for Pita Pocket, Chicken Chowmein, Chicken Manchurian. The service was really slow. Our food came after around 40-45 mins. But the food was really good and the place is just perfect for giving long addas with friends. So I enjoyed my visit at Fatso and might be will visit this place in near future.

Try the mint chocolate or the berry or the pineapple or the blue lagoon. As for food chicken cheese caprese is all about great taste. If u want to go authentic crispy babycorn or chicken is good. The chicken mushroom cheese pita pocket is good. The mexican wraps r great. Among the pasta try spaghetti in alfredo sauce. U can try the augratin out here. Its tasty. Have not tried the chinese. But yeah one of the best gossip Khanas which is a pocket saviour.

Being a Saturday i couldn't enjoy there non veg items so cant comment on it. Ambience is good n small party types with balloons n ribbons every where. I did also like the vintage pictures of Calcutta on the walls. In short when u r low in budget u can opt this place as its rates are reasonable

Fatso is a wonder because of the cosy feel of the menu, interiors and the pricing! If you are a student then this place is a great for a quick bite. 
It is tiny and seats only 10 odd people. The thing about their food is that none of them are authentic but they all taste nice. For me the chicken caprese is a must have at this place. Also their chicken strogonoff with herb rice is quite good as are their coffees and shakes. But stay off the pizzas and soups. 
They also have these party hats and foam to have fun with if its your b'day. The service is warm. 
Have fun at Fatso's...

Highly disappointing food quality. Though the desserts are still eatable, the sandwich was too over-priced, and disastrous in taste. I had ordered a chicken cheese sandwich, and asked to add corn as well. I was charged extra 10 bucks for the corn, and all I found was no more than two grains of it (no exaggeration). Even the sandwich on the whole was too amateurish in taste. Being a foodie, I do not think twice before spending on food, but here, I felt like I was just robbed off my money, for something that was definitely not worth it. The decor is good though, and is nice place for an adda with friends, but it lacks the primary quality of an eatery, that is, good food.

There was a time when students, only got the hold of Blossom Chicken rolls and some bites at Mushrooms. But, today with a little more pocket money, than we used to get...students in and around north Kolkata can easily afford to have some Kewl Adda along with some really tasty snacks. Fatso's is just the one for you guys. In just 200 bucks or a little more you can treat your girlfriend and her best friend!! Try the Brownie with ice cream in just rs. 90, Crispy chicken is tasty.

Tucked away near popular food-joints like Blossom's and Mushroom, Fatso's is a tiny restaurant serving snacks, Chinese and Continental. I won't say the food is exceptional, or innately delectable, but it definitely is up to the mark. The indo-chinese food that they serve you is indeed a pleasure to savor on. However, the most remarkable aspect of this food joint is the desserts it serve.. I simply love the brownie with ice cream. Moreover, the couple owning the space is also very friendly. In fact, after every food they asked us whether it was well prepared or not. :) Planning to visit this place many many times more. 3.5 stars for their cordial and warm service.

A good place to hangout with friends, Fatso offers a considerable variety in continental cuisine at reasonable prices. the wraps are good and the shakes delectable. However, the french toast is a let down while they do need to stock up on some non-lactose beverages. Even cold drinks go a long way for those who are lactose intolerant. The decoration is commendable, with the Kolkata photos inundating the walls. I love going there with my brother for a relaxing evening and reckon it is a good enough zone to enjoy with family and friends. They have wonderful music playing there throughout. They could increase the menu options a bit but the reception is warm and the people great. What more do you need to make it worth your time? Enjoy!
