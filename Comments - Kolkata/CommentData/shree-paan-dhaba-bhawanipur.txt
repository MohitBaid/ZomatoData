A Paan-shop located near Harish Parkg offers various flavoured Paans and the staffs along with the owner help to choose the best one for you I took Mango flavoured Ice Chuski Paan and Nutella Paano The first one was amazing paan with the taste of itself and a flavoure of mango falvoured ice-gola... The second one can be a perfect dessert for a sweet-lover with a twist. Outside, it is coated with nutella and inside it has the rich flavour of Gundi-Paano PeSo we got 20% discount as today it was tge shop's anniversary.

Really appreciate the fact that these guys innovated the concept of paan to a great extent. Chocolate fudge, Nutella, ice cream paan and most importantly, the fire paan is definitely worth a try!

This place located near Beninandan Street and beside Apna Dhaba in Bhawanipur. It is a very small but air-conditioned place. 

They have a variety of paan for all the paan lovers. They also have soft drinks such as Masala Cold Drinks and Soda Sikanji. We were thirsty so we ordered two Soda Sikanji and later had a regular paan. What I noticed was the innumerable flavours of paan they have on their menu. Such innovation! Will go there later to try out the different flavours.

I am not a Paan Lover, but definitely into desserts and sweets.
Last weekend me and my friends just decided to go out for Dinner and it was very late. After a satisfying dinner, you really can't just end without a dessert. Now, thats a question what Dessert.

Here starts the story. Recently I have been listening about Fire Paan, a new innovative Paan idea in Kolkata. Well, Kolkata has always been a place of innovation, specially when it comes to Food. So we decided and Ran off to Shee Paan dhaba in Bhawanipur. And after that the experience was heavenly.

My friends grabbed the Fire Paan and I was there for Chocolate one. And if asked I would definitely tell you guys should give it a shot once, if you are in Kolkata.

Amazing concept and perfect execution of the idea. The location cannot be better; one of the busiest roads of Kolkata not because of a traffic jam but due to hundreds of late night foodies who throng this place for the best eateries in the vicinity. Chewing a pan/ betel leaf is a  more of a culture rather than a type of cuisine and Kolkata is a best example to experience.
Paan Dhaba is a full air conditioned outlet which has a multitude of varieties/ flavours. Chocolate, caramel, peach Oreo, Hazelnut, Mango, Blueberry are some of them. I like the gundi or the mini paan which is a complete package in a small size. Do try the seasonal Mango and the Paan Baar.

Simply awesome. The variety was very impressive, had fire and ice paan which is the biggest attraction for me. Even tasted rose paan, will keep on trying different flavours and will ask other people to try as well.
