Went here today with a friend. The place is quite well decorated and they have ample space. We ordered Ginger Tulsi tea and grilled chicken sandwich. The order didn't take long to arrive. The bread was soft and the inside stuffing were coming out, too many onions, plus they sliced chicken sausages and made the sandwich. The food isn't worth the price being paid.

Beautiful and cozy cafe. Take a second left turn from CCD golpark (near mouchak, golpark) to reach here . quality of food is good. I liked the simplicity of the menu which suits the over all nature of cafe. Service time could have been better. Had to wait for food for long. All the best .üòä

A cafe that not only serves delicious food but also makes sure that you are allured by the beautiful garnishing skills. We had ordered #chickenpopcorn , #fishpopcorn, #cheeseomlette, #grilledeggchickensandwich, #grilledcheesechickensandwich, #kitkatshake, #pineapplepassionsundae and #bluelagoon. The interior is simple and beautiful. A must visit for all the foodies and non-foodies. I look forward to visit them once again in future.

Located at Golpark very near to the City College, this is one gem of a place! Can cater to a maximum of 15 people at a go. The interiors are beautifully done, a painting of budhha adds a certain amount of calmess to it this place!
Have had visited 2-3 times and haven't been disappointed with the food or the service. Yes, the perfect place for the college goers. A lot of food in an affordable price. 
Ordered masala tea and potato sandwich n my first visit. The masala tea was sinfully tasty and aromatic as well, as they see we eat with our eyes first, the presentation was spot on. On the second visit had veg cheese sandwich and the sandwich was stuffed with cheese and had ginger tea as well. On my third visit, had fish popcorn.. the taste was spot on as well as the presentation.
Am loving this caf√©, can't wait to drop by again!

A small cafe tucked in the lanes of golpark; small but worth visiting indeed. Visited this place yes on Christmas Eve and loved the food to every bits. Interiors are decently done with soothing lights. The best part about this place is the presentation of food; they really work hard on the presentation part.

In short "Small & Sweet" cafe. Located near South City college, easily accessible. Ambience is very neat & clean, even though it is not a big place the sitting arrangement is so well that you dont feel crowded. Roughly 17-18 people can sit at a time comfortably (Management can clarify further) so if you want an adda place for 3-4 people at one table then its fine or else have to sit in multiple tables. (Will not recommend for a 20 odd people type of party, but you can call them to find if they can arrange for such a party. I have not asked them about this so it will be wrong for me to comment)
Regarding food, there are lods of options to choose from, food quality is also very good. I am a chocolate fan and these guys did not disappoint, loved there shakes, coffee & mocktails. Quantity wise they give you your monies worth.
Regarding price, prices are affordable so good for you pocket too.
Staff are really polite & friendly so full marks on that.

Overall a nice place to visit. Will definetly love to visit again.

The food is okay. The ambience is okay.
The washroom needs to be kept cleaner. It's extremely unhygienic and one has to walk through the kitchen to get there, which is ridiculous. Also, it's a little difficult to find the cafe and the hard work didn't seem to be worth it.
I would rather go to Spanish cafe in sudder street.

It's a hidden gem near golpark, it is easy to find out this cafe, just go straight from mouchak and then turn left, although it is very small from the outside, while entering into that wow what a feeling I have the colourful world proper lighting and proper colour in the wall charming music charming charming decorated lighting just well placed and very innovative .

Coming to the staff very much responding and quick in service .

Food beleive it or not cant get this food quantity and quality by this affordable price and taste just owsome , i have taken lots of food but sorry cant take all of their picture people are sterving ... Cause it was just delicious .

Right taste right price and right ambiance just make us happy , realy waking up our mind and feels comfortable .although it is my frist post in zomato As i am cafe freaker i can bet you wont get this food by this price with ambiance any where in south calcutta. 50% cheaper than ccd and 80% better than food .

Ohhh one more thing i just forget to tell you , you can customise your mocktails if you want just askthem to do so they will egarly to do , help full.
Recomended for good foodie and ambiance seeker ..

The cafe is pretty nicely decorated and looks spacious although in reality it is very small. The walls are painted beautifully along with small trinkets placed here and there on the niches in the walls.
Coming to the food, it was nothing out of the ordinary and kind of disappointing. 
We ordered fish fingers, french fries, kit Kat shake and Oreo shake. The fish fingers was super hard and oily and had no fish inside it, it was only crust. The shakes we're watery and the only thing decent were the fries. 
But Other people have visited and said good things, so I think we went on a bad day.

Its been a Sunday rainy evening and me and my friend headed to this cafe. Its 2-3 min walking distance from Golpark bus stop just in the lane beside Kotak Mahendra bank. Its a small cafe but the decoration is really cute and decent. When we entered in the cafe the place was almost full and we got a corner seat with comfortable chair and table. We ordered the combo menu which had plane grill chicken sandwich french fries and a coke. Sandwich was very tasty and fresh Then we had a cocohino and a cafe mocha. They served very good quality coffee and quantity also better than any other branded coffee shop. We really enjoyed the food and coffee. Though there was very noise because of small place but still I loved the cafe.¬† Want to visit again... :)

The place is small, nice and cozy. We do try out places around the area and this sprung up on our route to somewhere. WE went in.

The place has 5-6 tables and seating capacity is small. But the food is simply amazing. The decor is calm and soothing and ambiance overall is pretty good.

The service is a bit slow to speak of, but I am hoping it will improve with time. 

The food is easy on the pocket and tasty.

All in all it is a really good place to hangout!!!

If you have tight budget and don't want to compromise your taste-buds the this is the place you need to visit.

Place was small and yet very clean and hygienic. Decor was very good. Seating arrangements are for max 20 people.

Last Sunday at 5 pm, place was nearly full, I took corner two seater and opted Blueberry Shake, the shake was beautiful and very good.

Then as suggested by the server I tried cheese chicken popcorn which was not good and very average.

Second dish I tried Fish Finger which was genuinely very good, taste and used fish quality was brilliant.

Last but not the least I had Chocolate Overloaded Sundae and my god that was just amazing, huge chunks of chocolate chips and 2 big scoops of Chocolate ice cream with nuts and choco sauce - AWESOME.

I will really give them a visit for burgers and sandwiches soon.

Visited this place on 1st dec 2017...

A new cafe in the south kolkata region more specifically in golpark area... This place was already full of cafes so it was always a tough job to compete with all of em and thrive in attracting crowd... but I must appreciate they have done a really great job tbh.. kudos to the owner and everyone attached to the cafe.. 

Location :- just take the lane beside mouchak sweet shop and walk street by keeping CCD on your left.. After a few steps take a left turn and u will reach ur destination quite easily.. 

Ambience :- at first it will seem some pastry or snacks shop from outside but trust me don't judge this place by its outer look... as soon as u enter u will be pleased to sit and relax for a couple of hours.. The vibrant colours.. The wall decor.. paintings... The chairs.. The show pieces.. everything was perfect.. The small place have been rightly utilised..

Food :- 1) Oreo shake with ice cream and wafer :- First of all the the ice cream and the wafer is chargeable and optional.. (30 bucks for the ice cream and another 10 for the wafer) .. you can opt for it or else have only the shake... but I wud suggest to have it with ice cream atleast...  
     It was just lipsmacking.. I am huge fan of shakes and trust me this won't let u down... It was perfectly prepared.. right amount of chocolate..and the ice cream accompanying it made it even more tastier... It was superb.. (5/5) 

2) plain chicken sandwich grilled :- two big pieces of sandwich perfectly filled with chicken and veggies and grilled to perfection.. The dish was filling and very good.. (5/5)

3) Chicken and cheese burger :- the best burger I have had in any cafe... wow.. It was real cheesy... The patty was grilled.. The taste was smoky.. really good... and to say more it was overloaded with mayo and cheese... Every bite will take you to a dream cheesyland...üòÖ

Service :- It was quite prompt... kudos to them for keeping up the good work... 

They don't charge any taxes.. so its a bit light on pocket..

A must recommended place... üëçüëçüòç Do visit..

Nice cozy place located at Golpark. You need to take the road right next to CCD/Mouchak and keep on walking straight and then take the second left to reach this place. Newly opened, it has a seating capacity of about 24 people(about 7 tables). Looks crampy from the outside but is spacious on the inside. Love the lighting(keep an eye out for the hanging lamps). Full points for the Buddha Painting too.
Now coming to the staff. Polite and courteous. Check.
Coming to the food. We had ordered french fries, chococcino, cafe mocha and a cheese chicken burger. Every single item was tasty and served within 10 mins of placing the order. Also full marks for the beer mugs and presentation of the dishes. 
This place is easy on the pocket too as items are priced at affordable rates and also there is no levy of GST. So that makes it a hit with the college goers as well. Looking forward to visiting this place again soon enough. Keep up the good work guys.

We ordered

2) CHICKEN AND CHEESE SANDWICH AND
3) ONE TUTTI FRUTTI SUNDAE

Really liked the chocochino. It came in a huge glass, and tasted quite good. 
The CHICKEN AND CHEESE SANDWICH was really filling. It was loaded with mayo, cheese and chicken and was really big and was quite satisfying..

Lastly, to satisfy our sweet tooth, we ordered the TUTTI FRUTTI. Well it was ordinary and could have been better. 
The food items are really affordable and the price is also inclusive of tax.. 

Liked the cozy cafe and i am really looking forward to try out their shakes and Sundaes.

Just had their Chicken Cheese Burger and Chicken with Cheese Sandwich...ordered via Swiggy cause don't know why but Zomato was saying that they won't deliver to my place though my house(Broad Street) is so near...so note that plzz...
Anyways the food was simply delicious and very filling too... :)

Chicken Cheese Burger --- At only 110 bucks this one's a total crave-killer...Its heavily loaded with cheese and mayo and the patty also tastes quite good...THUMBS UP üëçüëç TOTALLY RECOMMENDEDüòÉüòéüòé

Chicken with Cheese Sandwich --- It was tasty and quite big and filling too...But the only letdown was that it was cold...Yes the filling was cold and the bread was just dry...The need to heat it up for about a minute in the microwave was strongly felt...So that's not good...Just look into this...Taste wise no complaints though... :)

Overall a very pocket-friendly place for those sudden hunger pangs...CHEERS!!! üëçüëçüòéüòé

Among the many new cafes nearby Golpark Area this place one shouldn't miss out.
Located in the bylanes of Golpark area... Keep ccd on your left and walk straight... take another slight left there it is located on the left hand side of the lane.
Nice wall decor with different paintings lamp shades.. Overall great Ambience. Service was quick and staffs were cooperative.
I went there with a friend of mine and ordered
Cheese Corn and Peas grilled Sandwich and Brownie with an ice-cream.
Sandwich was big in size which had lots of Mayo in it tastes amazing... Brownie tastes great as well.

Pocket pinch is not high.

Cafes has been a daily demand and specially when it comes to Hangouts. Trending big time these cafes tend to be doing exceptionally good to bring more people. From all the odds there has been an even at Golpark as Wakeup Cafe is opened here to provide you with finger licking brunch.
Ambiance is quite small but the place is nicely decorated with hand made wall paintings and comfortable wooden chairs and tables. There you have soft music playing with a fair service.

It was a lunch and it went like this....

1. Brownie Shake : Who doesn't love brownie with ice cream and wen it comes in a form of shake then its pure bliss. This was creamy and tasty.

2. Cheese Omlet : We have tried whole lot of omlet in our daily lives but this time it was slightly different here. This time the omlet came with cheese wrap which was a giving a whole new flavour of egg and cheese. Recommend

3. Egg Grilled Sandwich : Just like above said this particular grilled sandwich had also charm of egg clubbed with the sandwich.

4. Tutty Fruity Sandae : This can never go wrong. Tutty fruity mixed with ice cream gave a perfect sooth to the tongue and ending the lunch well.

Newly opened place. Amazingly good interiors. Staffs were friendly but service could be improved.
Food was good enough - Fish Finger, Chicken Cutlet, Sandwich, Burgers.
Drinks that ordered were Virgin Mojito, Pina Colada and Brownie Shake. The Pina Colada was a little too sweet for my tastebuds.
Tutti Fruti and Chocolate Overload Sundae for desserts. I preferred the Tutti Fruti one over the Chocolate one because it was so good.

This newly opened cafe is located in the lanes of Golpark, specializes in breakfast menu and is here to offer you with freshly made finger food. I recently went with a group of friends to have brunch there. 
What we ordered :
1. Brownie Shake- Thick and creamy filled with brownie, vanilla ice-cream, choco chips and choco syrup melts in your mouth in no time. It's very filling.
2. Pinacolada - a pineapple flavoured mocktail which is thick and juicy with a typical pineapple flavour, presented very nicely. 
3. Cheese omlette and butter toast- the presentation of the cheese omlettes will catch your eyes and together with the buttery sandwiches will make a perfect breakfast.
4. Chicken cheese burger - cheesy chicken burger with a huge chicken patty and loaded with cheese slices and veggies is very tasty. 
5. Fish finger- fish fingers can never go wrong, soft and juicy fish fillets fried till golden brown together with mayo and ketchup dip urges you to have a little more.
6.  Wake up special chicken club sandwich - this one's their speciality and the presentation is top notch. They provide two sandwiches in a stick, one after the other and served with mayo and ketchup. 
7. Egg grilled sandwich - this has egg chunks and cheese and veggies and is very filling. 
8. Chicken cutlet - this is a thick piece of chicken fried till yellowish brown and is worth ordering. 
9.  Chocolate overloaded sundae - served in a bowl with a wafer stick is overloaded with chocolate and vanilla ice cream. 
10. Tutty fruity sundae - I love Tutty fruity flavour and I am glad I ordered it. 
This place is all about pretty decor, quirky walls one of which is hand-painted and a really cosy place to spend quality time with friends and family. The service is a little slow but the food will make up for it. The prices are reasonable and the quality and quantity of food is undoubtedly good. You must search for this tiny cafe in Golpark and dig in.

The cafe is located very close to golpark. The place is neat and warm, with very courteous staff. We ordered a Darjeeling Tea, A lemon tea amd chicken popcorn. All of which were excellent. They also have a good variety of shakes and coolers. But they have absolutely nothing for dessert apart from the shakes. Having a sweet tooth i was really disappointed with this as I really wanted a piece of cake to go with my tea. Nevertheless, it is a good place to visit, and i am looking forward to going there again soon.

It's a really great place to be, the food is good and the interior is fantastic!! I would recommend the Chicken Cutlet, Fish finger and the Club sandwich. For desserts, you can have the Tutti-Fruti Sundae.
The concept of jute lamps is one of a kind and the hand made painting of Buddha on one wall is amazing!!¬†

Cheers!!

Tucked in the lanes of Kankulia , this is a tiny cute cafe, with quirky walls, serving freshly made good food. Specialising in finger food. 
I happened to be here for brunch today. 
Ordered the following - 
Brownie Shake (recommended) , virgin mojito.
Butter toast and cheese omlette, grilled egg sandwich (recommended), fish fingers, chicken cutlets.
Also tried the wake up cafe special club sandwich, it was really filling. Came along with fries. Must try. 
Chicken grilled burger- big fat burger with freshness and taste overload. 
For desserts ordered the tutty fruity and chocolate overload ice cream.

The service was a tad slow and the staff need to up their game. Otherwise worth a visit.

This was built a while back, close to South City College in Golpark. The ambience is nice, with a ambient music beat on loop. We ordered hot chocolate coffee and a brownie shake along with chicken fingers, the whole cost only 360 including tax. The coffee cost 80 including tax only, being as comparable to CCD, where it is 160 minimum. A great place, with reasonable prices. A must go if you love coffee or shakes or mocktails.

Decided to visit this place after viewing its decent Zomato ratings. And it turned out to be an underrated overlooked gem of a place! The decor was comforting with soft music playing in the background. The staff was courteous and friendly. Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken and cheese Grilled sandwich, chicken fingers, Kitkat shake with vanilla ice cream and oreo shake with chocolate ice cream. The chicken fingers were decent. I loved the way they served the food. Sandwiches were extraordinary - loaded with cheese mayo and bell peppers. A must try! Both the shakes were creamy, filling and chocolaty. And all these at just INR 610. A nice experience indeed! Would surely visit again.

Had an awesome experience here with my special friend....ambience very beautiful, service and staff too good, food was awesome, got 10% student's discount, ordered cafe mocha, grilled chicken cheese sandwich and assam tea, but they served darjeeling tea instead, as it was a mistake from their side, the person who served us charged the price of assam tea,so am really impressed, but one thing to say, if u give some chips or french fries with sandwiches then it will be even better, eager to visit again soon...

Visited this place today around 4 pm and it was totally vacant that time. This newly opened small cafe is located at a lane in Golpark. You have to follow the Google map to locate the place properly. If you are coming from Golpark you have to follow the street just beside "Mouchak" and after walking a while this cafe is located at a lane in left side.
The ambiance of the place is very nice with soft background music. The decor is very beautiful. Dining space is small but well arranged. The wall paintings are amazing.
Our today's food Journey includes,
* Grilled Chicken With Cheese Sandwich
* Chicken Popcorn
The food took around 15 to 20 minutes to be served. Quite a long time wait but it absolutely compensated when we tasted the foods. The sandwich is divine with a lots of cheese and loaded with shredded Chicken. Chicken Popcorn was delicious too. 16 small pieces of popcorn was served along with Salad and two type of dips. The key factor of this place is the reasonable price. It cost only 250 RS for the foods. So definitely recommended. Go, sit and just enjoy your foods without worrying about pocket pinch. There is no added GST on the bill. The menu displayed in zomato is all inclusive.
P.S. They don't serve regular water. You have to buy mineral water bottle but that is also charged minimal cost.

This place is truly wonderful i would say.
Before I start my review, i would like to mention some points about this cafe which makes this place worth visiting:
1. Amazing Decor
2. Kind and well-behaved Staff
3. No GST!! (The first thing that i look for when i search for new eateries)
4. The Cheese Chicken Grilled Sandwich. üòçüòç
5. The seats of this place are the most comfortable ones i've seen till date.
6. Good location: Just 6 to 7 minutes walk from Gariahat. It's very easy to locate[USE GOOGLE MAP].
7. Extremely pocket-friendly. Pocket pinch: Rs.400 for Two.[That was our bill when we visited this place for the first time]

First of all let's talk about the lovely decor it has. The very moment you enter this place, the lovely wall paintings, the wall decor and the lanterns, are sure to win your heart. The ambience is perfect, with the soft music that plays in the background.
One thing i loved is the seating arrangement. The chairs are extremely comfortable, and trust me, it's hard to find a similar one in any other cafe.
The wall paintings are amazing, i would attach pictures along with my review, so that you can check for yourselves.
Next, let's move on to talk about the food.
I would list the things that i ordered when i first visited this place with my boyfriend: Cheese Chicken Grilled Sandwich, Cheese Chicken Burger, a Oreo shake, and a Blue Lagoon.
"Amazing" would be less of a word if i had to describe the sandwich. It's splendid and grilled to perfection.
Trust me, it just won my heart. I would re-visit this place only for the sandwich itself. It's so tasty and mouth-watering. The quantity is more than enough. The sandwich pieces are incredibly large and definitely larger than what are provided in other contemporary cafes. The presentation of the food is lovely as well.
The next thing that we had is a Cheese Chicken Burger. The burger was not satisfactory but it was not bad either.
The oreo shake was perfect. The blue lagoon was okayish.
This place is newly-opened and is a hidden gem.
It's worth visiting solely because of its amazing decor and ambience. The Cheese Chicken Grilled Sandwich of this place is amazing and it surely makes the place worth visiting. It's a lovely place to hangout with your friends and to spend time with your loved ones.
Do visit this place and you'll surely not regret. Happy Eating!! :)
[I'm attaching the pictures of the place as well as the food items that we had, along with this review. Do have a look. P.S.: The picture of the burger would be missing because my boyfriend was so hungry that he started eating it up before I could take a picture of it.üòÇüòÇ And Do hit a L I K E if you find my review helpful. Thank you. ^_^]

The recent boom of cafes in the Golpark - Fern Road area has brought in Wake Up Cafe, a tiny cafeteria hidden deep in the tiny lanes of Golpark. Kept no expectations about the place, and the experience turned out to be one worth talking about. Considering it is tucked deep into Kankulia Road, I'd recommend you keep Google Maps handy. (take the road beside Mouchak and head straight keeping CCD on your left)

The cafe is small but boasts of a casual, laid back ambiance lit with beautiful wall decor and hanging lamps. Although the seating space can accommodate four tables only, care has been taken to ensure that the place doesn't get cramped and clumsy.

We ordered a simple evening snack of French fries, Chicken fingers and fresh lime soda. Service is quite commendable and the quantity of the titbits were mind blowing. The two of us were almost full after gorging on the fries itself. The chicken was delicious and topped with loads of mayo. Prices were also extremely reasonable. 

Verdict - awesome!

Golpark has been witnessing a splurge of new cafes opening their doors over the last year or two..this cafe is located a minute walk away from my home so i was really looking forward to see what they offer..

Ambience - this place might not have enough space for plenty but where this place shines is that it is decked up neatly with every minute artistic details..job well done

Service - the service might seem to be a bit delayed but the staff is cordial and polite..

Food (Pet Pujo) - considering the first visit i had ordered mango smoothie and strawberry shake with icecream alongside frenchfries..well this is where they makeup even for their delayed service with the humongous quantity and excellent quality of food which can rival any upmarket cafe like ccd/mamma mia..the smoothie and shake was just aptly thick with ample quantity of nuts and copious servings of icecream in them..the fries were served with couple of dips which also tasted good..enough quantity to please any hungry soul..again hats off and hope they continue to do better..

Bill/Payment Gateways - For such delicious food the price pinch is very reasonable and this makes repeat visits lighter on the pocket..i will be definitely making more visits in the days ahead to try out the other items..for the moment they accept only cash/mobikwik wallet and they have assured me that a POS machine has been applied for and will be included in a matter of days for card payments..

Good job Guys..!!..

Review update:- Second visit this morning(8.10.17)..visited once again for a quick cuppa hot chocolate while reading the sunday times..peaceful read amidst subtle tones of music in the background on a rainy day..üëçüèª

Just want to write an honest review. When I entered the place I was really impressed by the decor. From the lights to the wall , all were aesthetically pleasing. Coming to menu , it mostly have beverages and sandwiches which is fine for a breakfast. We ordered an Oreo shake , a KitKat shake, fries and fish finger. The shakes could have been better but it wasnt very bad. The disappointment was the fish finger as it was extremely hard to even chew. I am sure the food can be better.

Such a charming place it is! I visited this place on Nabami this year. This place is located near Mouchak (Golpark). It is around 7-10 min walk from Golpark more. 

Wakeup Cafe is a newly opened caf√© with an extremely pretty interior decor. The subtle atmosphere and the good music is bound to soothe you. The caf√© can accommodate around 15-20 people. The people there are very polite and soft spoken. 

Coming to the food, we ordered two plates of Chicken and Cheese sandwiches (one plain and one grilled) , one Blue Lagoon, one hot coffee and one sundae. All the items very delicious and the stuffing inside the sandwiches was perfect. Both the quality and the quantity of the food are more than satisfactory. The prices are quite reasonable as well. Definitely a recommended place.

Located in Golpark..this place is real good. It's not too big and can cover for 15 people at most.  Absolutely perfect for always-broke-foodies on the quest for cheaper cafes with great food quality. They don't charge GST or any additional taxes and even then the food prices are cheaper compared to the other cafes in this area.  Besides, the minute one walks in , he/she is sure to be enthralled by the amazing wall decor. It is downright eye-catching. 

We ordered two Coffee Mocha and Chicken Cheese Burger. The mocha was good and the burger was really tasty and lip-smacking. 
Overall it's very pocket friendly and the service and staffs are equally good.

Plus, 10% discount if you can produce your student ID.

My friend and I ordered a plate of Egg grill sandwich which was absolutely sufficient for the two of us.
My friend also ordered a vanilla shake which he thoroughly enjoyed.
The staff was really polite and the service was nice.
