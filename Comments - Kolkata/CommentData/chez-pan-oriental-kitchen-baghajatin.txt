A newly opened Chinese delicacy in South Kolkata. It's a very lovely place and very pocket-friendly.
The staffs were helpful and ambience was very peaceful.
And Food was even better. We had ordered:-

1. Shanghai fried rice: Perfectly cooked rice with lots of ingredients in it..we took chicken fried rice ,it had lots of veggies and glass noodles too. You can try it with gravy or even dry side dish. It tastes amazing.
2. Beijing's chili chicken: Served with 6chicken pieces which were soft and crispy. Very light food with awesome taste.
3. Darshaan: Chinese Dessert with scoop of vanilla icecream and honeyed crispy noodles(flavours of your choice). Damn yummy!🤗

I must say this will be student's fav corner in few months because of not just quality of food but also the price.
Our total bill was 500. 
Reasonable enough. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.

Burmese pork is what I have ordered....I have never tasted Burmese cuisine earlier so couldn't assure if the dish was authentic or not....But yes the preparation did enrich my tastebuds.....It had a rich creamy and buttery taste with spices on a bit lighter side....and the flavour of "lemon grass" complementing it.....The meat was perfectly tender....but the quantity was on a lesser side compared to the previous pork dishes I ordered....It was a burst of delight in my mouth....

As usual the service was impressive....It was delivered much before the estimated delivery time and was delivered hot....

All South-asian restaurants start well in Calcutta but eventually gets lost....Hope you guys won't disappoint....and be there to continue your service like this....keep it up guys!!!!

Well done... It's been a long time since I have eaten such a nice Chinese Cantonese Style dish by online order. I've ordered One Pork Pan Fried Noodles through Zomato. The delivery was pretty disappointing because after addressing the way of my home they are confused about the road direction. Now Coming back to the Item it was pretty good except more pan fried flavour on it.. It could be better

This restaurant is located just opp to ekta heights baghajatin, you will find a lane just beside Allahabad bank. Ambience was ok. Service was good. Now comming to the main part i.e food. Ordered non veg lemon coriander soup, three treasure fried rice and sliced fish in chef's special sauce. All the dishes very good and the ingredients used were also fresh. Quantity provided seemed to me was little bit less. Taste wise food was good but i could not find anything special taste in their dishes. Please do visit and enjoy their food.

A definite gem hidden within the lanes of Bagha Jatin. A bit tricky to find at first but not too difficult. Once you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by a simplistic decor accompanied by music playing in the background. But dont let the simplicity fool you, as they pack a punch with their food.

We started with the Dragon Phoenix soup and Crispy Chilly babycorn. The soup was pretty good but the babycorn was simply delicious. A nice combination of spices, I must say.
For the main course we had Mixed Hakka noodles, Chez special Oyster Basil noodles and Sliced chicken in Chilly Oyster sauce. All of them were extremely good but the chez special noodles needs a special mention. The basil in the noodles added a tinge of refreshment which made me gorge the entire dish. Definitely a must try. And to top it all, none of the dishes were too oily which we usually associate with Chinese food.
The staffs were polite and prompt. And price wise this place is definitely pocket-friendly. Already planning for the next visit. 😃

Yesterday I came with my colleagues for the first time in Chez- Pan Oriental Kitchen
Location: Easy to locate, in Bhaghajotin near Allahabad bank.
Ambiance: Very cozy and homely. Very quiet and less noisy.
Service: Very good. Staffs are very well mannered. 
Food Quality: Their golden fried prawn is just awesome. Better then some of the popular Chinese restaurant. Main  course pepper fish, Kung Pao chicken, Hoisin fish, sweet and sour soup, Khao pad mix rice was really good. 
I just loved the food, never expected such authentic Chinese food in Bengali area.

One of my favourite restaurant.. Tried many dishes.. Roasted chili pork was very good.. With that we tried Pad thai noodles which was the best of all the dishes. Apart from that tried Indonesian chicken satay which was kind of different but taste was really good. Ambience is really really good.. Staff were really nice to us.. We ordered via zomato today also.. Will visit again within few days for sure..

Lovely little place, just the way I like. Located in a quite street, not much people, therefore no disturbance. Staff is good. Food is even better. It was pure luck we found this restaurant while walking down the street deciding where to spend our New Year in peace. And we did find a peaceful and cosy place to have our dinner.
Lets talk about the food. Hot and sour soup, yummy. Chicken, egg, mushroom, veggies and a flavourful and hot soup! What more do you need on a cold winter evening?
Veg fried rice, tastes good. Not oily. Hoisin Fish, another great dish. Lovely preparation. The fish was soft and well cooked. The sauce was not very spicy yet tasted very different. I hope this place maintains the quality of their dishes. If they do, then they are sure to attract many foodies! Price is affordable. Food for two costed Rs. 470 with taxes
......
Revisited chez, had veg schezwan fried rice and satin chicken. Fried rice was spicy yet not very hot on your taste buds. Satin chicken was a totally new dish for me. Tasted a bit sweet but flavourful. A good combination with the schezwan rice. 
Keep up the good work!

Ordered Beijing chilli chicken , chilli garlic pepper prawn , garlic pepper pork, schezwan fried rice etc. The service was quick and the delivery was made ahead of schedule. This is the best Chinese till date that I have tasted in town. They are a combination of authenticity and taste. They are much better than the big names in the town and cost effective. The only change that they can possibly adopt is the rice grains they use for the fried rice other wise taste is great. Will keep ordering.......

Ordered chilli chicken and fried rice. The chicken fried rice wasn't that flavourful. I've had better fried rice elsewhere at the same price. But it wasn't totally bad.
The chilli chicken was a little too salty but otherwise tasted good. However, some of the chicken pieces seemed raw.
So I'm a tad bit disappointed .

However, right after I wrote this review I got a call from the restaurant. They felt apologetic of the incident, and took the details of my experience and promised to change my poor opinion of them. 

So they parceled one plate of chili chicken to my house and I must say it tasted very very good. The right amount of salt. The chicken was succulent and well cooked not raw. I am very impressed. Hope to visit your restaurant soon for a meal !
Well done guys!

Another new chinese corner in South Kolkata. We had ordered food home. Plus points : good quality containers, delivery pretty fast and some new hint into the ordinary chinese recipes. We really liked the lemon coriander soup & the ginger honey chicken. I personally recommend these 2 along with their chicken fried rice. It was non sticky, well cooked & freshly made! However the pan fried noodle was not that great, the noodles were too deep fried. But on complaining about the same they had delivered a pan fried noodle next day for free. Though the black sauce tasted better than the white sauce but the noodles remained deep fried & extra crisp. But this gesture needs to be applauded.

Ordered dinner last night. We ordered Beijing chilli chicken, Pan fried noodles, chicken fried rice, and kung pao chicken. 
The food was delivered on time and was well packed in air tight packets. 
The food itself needs to be improved. The starter was okay. Nothing exemplary. The pan fried noodles wasn't well cooked and was the most disappointing item, although I found it to be highly recommended here. Kung Pao chicken was the only item I really enjoyed. 
I hope they put more care in the taste as much they do in delivering!

All these items were very exceptional. Chily chicken was very different in taste which is good. Although satin chicken was tasty but the gravy was little sweet. Quantity was very good and price is also reasonable.

Pan fried noodles really taste awesome and highly recommended and also thumps up goes to indonesian chicken.
But woon sen soup doesn't taste good at all a raw ginger smell was coming not at all taste good.
One thing main they should increase quantity a little bit.
Overall service is good aswell as the behaviour.
Price is okk.

Chez is a newly opened restaurant near baghajatin area offering pan asian delicacies. My friend & I randomly decided to try a new place and this place being on my wishlist so we zeroed down on this. Well initially we had difficulty in locating the place but somehow found it. The google maps also doesn't work properly to locate this. Chez is located just in the opposite lane of the bank beside Ekta Heights complex.

The dine in area is fairly spacious with dimly lit all around. The place does have AC as comfort. The kitchen is almost open which could be from the seats. The service girl certainly made our dine in a very memorable one with proper infos about the availability of menu items and also recommendations. Anyways cutting back to the chase we had the following array of items:-

1. Indonesian chicken satay - 4 pcs of garlic & herb charred satay were served along with peanut dip. The chicken was tender & were perfectly cooked. The peanut dip served was miles better than served in other places. Recommended.

2. Roasted chilli pork - To me this was the star of our menu. Chunky large pieces of juicy luscious heavenly roasted were served with chopped garlics,onions,chillies and lemongrass. The taste of lemongrass just took the dish to the next level. The quantity was also large. The dish was also very spicy so be mention it to tone it down if you are a non spicy lover. Also in my opinion this was the best chilli pork which i have tasted anywhere in the city. In the end we ended up with another plate of it. Highly Recommended.

3. Pan seared fish - 8pcs of soft flaky fried basa prepared with mushroom,onions,garlic and special sauce. The dish was comparatively mild but it was good in taste.

4. Pan fried noodles mixed - Classic good old pan fried noodles in gravy mix of vegetables,chicken,pork,prawn. You have the option to opt for boiled noodles or fried ones. We opted for the boiled version. The quantity was again huge. The noodles also complimented very well with the gravy mix. It was an absolute delight to eat. Recommended.

5. Darsaan - We wanted to try their fried ice cream but unfortunately it wasn't available. So instead we took darsaan with a twist. We were informed that wonton noodle were over, so basically we were served with plain thin honey noodles as replacement with vanilla ice cream. The darsaan was well prepared but the usage of thin noodles were over fried a bit with the presence of excess honey which resulted in the hardening of the noodles creating difficulty in breaking down the noodles. A minor flaw though.

The savoury dishes were absolutely to die for & just bowled us over with its quality and taste. Also their mocktails are currently unavailable for service. The pocket pinch was Rs 700 per head. They charge separate GST. The service was also superb. Keep up the good work

I am really excited to try the others on the menu in near future. It's been long I had something oriental in the real sense. I like oriental food in its real sense and they served it. I will be trying more of the menu soon...

On the hunt for a new eating joint , travelled with my foodie friend to Chez hearing positive things about it . A lazy Saturday evening set the backdrop for a place where my focus was on good food and an enjoyable experience , which is exactly what we received.

This being our first time into the restaurant , we ordered a range of cuisines to cater to our palette . Starters came in the form of Indonesian Chicken Satay and Roasted Chilli Pork , followed by pan fried noodles with a grave base , pan seared fish and topped off in the end with Darshan , the classical dessert of today’s times . 

The food was delightful and the pork itself was heavenly , so much so , we ended up ordering an additional plate . The place had a quiet vibe , perfect for a conversation and seemed quite pocket friendly as well . The staff was courteous and the server who took our order was extremely friendly and eager to help out . She was the definition of customer service done right and with a smile. 

The only gripe is that the mocktails has not yet started even though they were on the menu . In a way , this gives me more incentive for my next visit . 

A delightful experience , in every way .

I crave for good Chinese food whenever I visit Kolkata. Specially home delivery oprions. I loved Chez. Very neatly packed and delivered on time. We ordered traditional fried rice, pan fried noodles & chilli chicken. Preparations were simple and tasty.

Just one observation, your delivery person asks if he is required to return the change.

The newest kid on the block when it comes to Oriental cuisine. Went there yesterday and I must say I came away impressed.
FOOD: We had the Dragon Phoenix Soup which was loaded with chicken and veggies and was the perfect warm broth you need in the winters.
For main course we had shanghai rice mixed and chicken in hot basil sauce. Both the dishes complemented each other very well and were full of flavour. Special mention must go to the rice which had some pickled vegetables in it and was unlike anything I've tasted before.

AMBIENCE: Now this was a downer. The seating is not all comfortable neither is the place done up well. At best classifies as an eating house, nothing more. The furniture will remind you of kindergarten schools.

PRICE: Dirt cheap. A meal for two would cost around 600 at the most and quantity provided is decent enough as well.

Good food. One plate suffices two so good value for money. A bit on the spicier side, but the menu comprising of Chinese and Thai won't disappoint and would make it hard to choose from the array of dishes available.

Ordered food from Chez today. The packaging was brilliant as we had the food approx. 1 Hr after the food was delivered and it was still hot. We ordered:
Mixed Old Style Fried Rice.
Mixed Singapore Style Rice Noodles - I always prefer rice noodles over plain noodles and Chez didn't disappoint me.
Chilly Pork Dry - Must try. The meat was tender and juicy.
Kung Pao Chicken.
Tausi Chicken - Must try. Tried it for the 1st time and it was a winner.
Blackbeans & 3 Bellpepper Fish - Must try for fish lovers. Amazing preparation.
Traditional Chilli Chicken.
Would definitely recommend Chez for people who love Asian Cuisine. The quality and quantity of food was very good.

Ordered via swiggy. Didn't dissapoint. Burmese Pork sipyan was different and liked it the most. The starters in Basa fish and Pad kring something  chicken started was good as well. Jasmine rice was nice. Didn't like sambal udang as much as the rest. The gravy was too dilute and portions too low. Portions in rest of the item was decent but not too generous but good enough. I wish they would introduce more and more asian special items so that we get introduced to hitherto undiscovered/ not much popular cuisines and their dishes.

It has been a lovely experience every time I have ordered from this restaurant. I have ordered 4 times till now and hence have tried a varied collection of dishes from Pork to Sea Food. The Sea Food dishes are exceptionally good and especially importantly authentic to South East Asian roots. A must try for all Kolkata foodies.

I have asked for a delivery, and it was made before time. So first impression is a thumb's up.
Secondly, the package was done very neatly. Food comes in a black lided box wrapped in cellophane paper. Hence, second impression was on point too.
Third and most important, I have ordered simple veg Friedrice and schezwan Friedrice, the rice is well cooked with full of colourful vegetables. The Thai basil chicken had a lot of chicken slices and yummy gravy to team with.
Fourth, the prices are unbelievably affordable. The rates simply surprised me as the quality and quantity was amazing.

Just being in a mood of sheer experiment on a Friday night, tried out Chez Pan Oriental kitchen and boy oh boy, it turned out to be a delicious revelation.
Ordered  Poh Taek Soup and Indonesian Satay chicken. The Poh Taek soup was really authentic, assimilating Thai herbs and seafood comprising of prawn and white fish fillet. It could have been more spicy with fresh bird eye chilli, however I reckon it had been customized to appease the Indian taste bud and the result was more than satisfactory.
Indonesian Satay Chicken was a clear winner  surpassing our expectations. The chicken was tender, juicy and flavourful, the peanut butter sauce being the icing on the cake. The quantity could have been a bit more, after cherishing and becoming awed by the quality of what we had, we clearly were in a mood of ravenously devouring more.
Overall was very satiated with the food quality, the breezy service and the cordial behaviour, would look forward to try out the other dishes in the coming days.

A newly opened restaurant at Bagha Jatin with a great menu. To follow it up they have been doing some good things as can be deciphered from the lovely reviews on Zomato. So, we decided to give this place a try and ordered loads of stuff, both vegetarian and non vegetarian. The food was awesome.... No complaints regarding that aspect (certainly the most important aspect). The chef did a wonderful job.... and the entire kitchen deserves a big thumbs up. Our order consisted of -
Soup: Veg Lemon Chilli Burnt Garlic Soup
Starters: Nam Prik Pao Gai, Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish,
Mains: Chicken Hakka Style Noodles, Mixed Shanghai Fried Rice, Shitake and Butter Mushroom in Hot Basil sauce, Traditional Chilli Chicken, Sliced Chicken in Hot Basil Sauce, Vegetarian Spinach Burnt Garlic Rice.

What I would like to highlight is the efforts they put in to correct a mistake of theirs and put a smile on the faces of their customers.
While having dinner we realised that one of the dishes was missing and promptly called them to let them know. The management was extremely apologetic and wanted to send the item immediately. Being very late, I asked them to send it over the next day, which they accepted. The truth in a country like ours is that things are forgotten pretty easily and conveniently and I was actually sceptical about whether they would keep it in mind. But not in this case. I was pleasantly surprised by a call in the morning from them asking me the time I wanted to receive the remaining dish from the previous day's order. Not only did they send it over, but they also sent a complimentary bottle of ThumsUp.... a very touching gesture on their part. Such exceptional levels of service are a rarity and each one of us in our family was overwhelmed. People do make mistakes, but it is the effort they put in to correct it and not repeat the same is what assures greatness.
Frankly, I was thinking of giving them a rating of 4.0, but their service skyrocketed the rating.
I hope they keep up their good work and that complacency never sets in. Best wishes to them.

Don't usually review but this one was special. I ordered Old Style Pork Fried Rice and Beijing Chilly Chicken and have to say the food was amazing. The rice was great and the chicken was one of the most flavourful cineese dish I have ate. Didn't expect the food to be so tasteful. 
P.S. If they call to review their food that's because this is a freakin business and this is how they feed themselves. And they are doing a wonderful job while doing that. So think a bit before you bad mouth on the internet.

Ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Chilli Garlic Fish from this joint last night. The rice was well-prepared. The other dish lacked a bit with regards to the gravy - it was hot, but not as flavoursome as I would've liked. However, the fish itself was exemplary - both in texture and in taste. Overall, I was satisfied with my meal. As Chez is a new restaurant, I'm pretty sure they'd improve over time and manage to deliver that extra oomph. Would order again soon!

We had an amazing meal at Chez at last night. After a long time we got to taste some chilli roast pork which matched the standards of the best in the city, which made the evening all the more better. The dragon and phoenix soup was exquisite and something off the basic Chinese and Asian food menu. The pan seared fish gave a tangy twist to the starters and we relished it as much. In the main course we had spinach burnt garlic rice along with prawn in chef's special sauce. The rice went very well along with the side and was also lip-smacking. We had a wonderful experience and hope to come back.

Shanghai Mixed fried rice is some thing different in taste but it is good.i thought roasted chilli pork to be more dry. Chilly garlic chicken noodle was very tasty. Hoisin pork was ok but shredded chicken in oyster sauce was excellent. Chicken was fresh and tender. We all loved it

Night hunger pangs and Zomato go hand in hand! So when a similar episode occurred a few hours earlier tonight, I naturally went busy browsing through all the delicacies that could satiate my deprived soul. And what better way to comfort one's soul than a steaming bowl of Thai curry? Also having felt kind of adventurous since morning, I decided to give in to my instincts, ditch the tried and tested restaurants and opt for a completely new one. 

As they say : always trust your instincts.

 The salted shitake mushrooms that I had added as an afterthought was a winner. The black mushrooms were fresh, tossed in generous amounts of presumably olive oil and spiced with cilantro, crushed black pepper and three colored bellpeppers. The prawn red curry I ordered came with a bowl full of plain steamed rice, the perfect blank slate to compliment the very many flavors of the curry. And like all good Thai curries, they nailed the curry paste, with all the ingredients standing out and not overpowering one another.

 The bill came to around 500 bucks and left me full and happy.

Chez - A great pan oriental kitchen to satiate your cravings at reasonable prices. 
=====
Location & Intro:

It is located in Bapujinagar Road, Baghajatin, Kolkata. To be more precise, opposite Ekta Heights building tucked away in a small lane. The best way to reach is by asking for Ekta Heights.

I had visited here along with a friend of mine to try out the chinese food out here. It is quite a new joint. The ambiance of the place focuses on the chic and modern aspect. Nonetheless, We took our seats in the cute chairs here and started scrolling the a la carte. 

They have quite a lot of variety to offer. As mentioned earlier, the prices are not very high and have been kept quite reasonable as well. 
=====
What i had:

• Indonesian Satay Chicken - The chicken was quite tender and juicy. It was flavorful as well. The peanut butter as usual was complementing the dish. However, one recommendation would be to make the peanut butter more thicker. 

• Old School Chicken Shrimp Egg Fried Rice - I usually like my fried rice to be plain rice and i like tryin out the side dishes. The rice was perfect. It was light and was topped with fried garlic which was like icing on the cake. 

• Tausi Chicken - It was more of shredded chicken tossed in black bean sauce. The pieces were quite good in quantity for two. However, the soya sauce levels could have been just reduced by slight so as to avoid the sourness to the dish. Nonetheless, again, i loved the presentation. It was presented with spring onions on the top.

• Strawberry Crispy Noodles with Peanut Crumbs - This was something which i had not tried before. The dessert if you call it was light, crispy and enjoyable. 
=====
Meal for two: 350-700 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.) 
=====
Pros:

• Have quite a large variety of items to select from. (Pan Oriental Cuisine)
• Good ambiance.
• Reasonably priced.
=====
Summary: 

Presentation 4/5

Taste 4/5

Quality 4/5

Quantity 4.2/5

Ambiance 3.8/5

Hospitality 4.2/5

VFM 4/5
=====
Conclusion:

It was a great experience here. The food was quite good here and it did not make me feel heavy that much.

I have been really eager to try this restaurant since couple of weeks and finally got the chance..being located inside an alley we struggled a bit to find it.. It has a nice comfortable ambience and the staff is courteous and attentive... 
Coming to the food,  we had 
Velvet mushroom soup 
Nam prik pao gai 
General qing chicken 
Golden fried prawn 
I really loved the food except general qing chicken.. It was a bit salty for me..  Apart from that no complaints.. Pocket pinch is on the lower side so that's a plus.. 
A small suggestion -  it would be nice if they add curtains or mat to the windows and start accepting card... 🙂

ITS A NEWLY OPENED RESTAURANT IN MY LOCALITY. IT LOOKS NICELY ORGANISED FROM THE OUTSIDE, but I am not sure of the ambiance , as I got my food delivered.
I ordered for one chicken Shanghai fried rice. there preparation is authentic.. its a must try. prodigious amount of veggies and chicken(which is not the case with most of the restaurants), it tasted delicious.
satisfied my taste buds, as well my gargantuan appetite. 

hope u guys continue to serve this way!

Located in a very convenient place, right opposite to Ekta heights, this oriental kitchen offers a plethora of asian/chinese/tibetian/Burmese/Thai dishes. 
I tasted konjee crispy lamb, shredded chicken in chilli oyster sauce, pan fried noodles and golden fried prawn. 
The taste is really authentic and the ambiance is pretty interesting because you can actually experience the work in progress if you keep visiting. 
The service is pretty good and the staff are very hospital. The outlet is clean and the meat quality is excellent!

They also do delivery which is the best part. Ordered Chinese and found a perfect food to make my Sunday evening memorable. I will refer
@ them to my friends definitely. Thanks to chez and all their staff members. Golden fried prawn, mixed fried rice, chilli chicken and drumstick , all were delicious and perfect fit to taste. I will  e there in the coming weekends and will try more to explore their food hub.

On a dark and wet rainy day, I needed a simple dish of fish to have with steamed rice with butter. My first choice would always be Chili Garlic Pepper Fish. Seeing Chez new on Zomato I went ahead to try out the dish there. And they made me happy. A simple standard dish delivered on time. The fish pieces were cut properly and cooked well. The flavor and aroma was perfect as it should be. A bit deviated from the good old authentic version of the dish thats is usually available in Tangra but it had its own style. It made my lunch perfect and yes, I would like to hit this joint again with a plan for full lunch or dinner to check out some of the other items in the menu.

Found this little corner very near my house. It's a small restaurant good for family outings or small groups of friends. We were the only customers at that point, even then the service was slow, although being very courteous.
The golden fried prawns are to die for, the covering being crispy light and the prawns cooked extremely well. The crispy chilli babycorn was good, although not great. The pan fried noodles, chilli garlic fish, fried rice and shredded chicken in oyster sauce was extremely good. Darshan was also nicely made, albeit a bit too sweet. Very good experience. Pocket pinch for 5 was 2k.

Location : opp lane of Vijaya bank ATM/Tulip Hall School near central park or ekta heights (krishna Glass).
Service: helpful and friendly staff
Ambience: simple, neat and clean.
Food: they serve a good variety of pan asian dishes. I went there for lunch and since it was a saturday i had to opt for veg dishes. I tried their burnt lemon garlic soup, it comes with a strong essence of burnt garlic and and lemon.. pretty nice.
Then i went for their wheat noodles, mind you wheat noodles are not available in all places, thus i was excited to see this. It was well prepared with good amount of veggies.

Over all a good initiative. Best wishes.

Today I was in a mood to try a budget friendly new place after the money draining puja week. I had come across this name during puja but overlooked it as experimentation can be disastrous in that period. Today after debating with myself on checking the zomato rating I went to the place without any preconceived notions.  The place is comfortably spacious for a budget place , smells of new paint and furniture. Adequately air conditioned for a peaceful meal. Ordered Chicken lemon coriander soup and chicken manchow soup ....for starters ordered golden fried prawn and Beijing chilli chicken. The manchow soup was better with the right flavours lemon coriander was a tad bit over sour than the usual ones. They served fresh crispy fried noodles with manchow.  Starters were mind blowing ..Beijing Chilli chicken was the tangra chilli chicken nice firm 11 pieces tossed with chillies , onion and capsicum. ..very satisfying. Now mentioning the STAR dish GOLDEN FRIED PRAWNS. ...beautiful light crispy batter coated big fleshy prawns...6 pieces served with a sweet chilli dip for 210 buck .Quite a deal foodies indulging in seafood would get what I'm talking about...I like spicy sauces so they served a homemade red chilli sauce which was out of the world. Immediately i ordered a repeat for the prawns. Absolutely rocking. Mains we had a Mixed Pan Fried noodles with crispy noodles only which was proactively customized according to my choice as I didn't feel like having soft pan fried noodles. Really appreciate their effort at customer service. Very pocket friendly highly recommended place. .Go foodies happy exploring...Did I mention they have a fair bit of Thai , Malaysian, Indonesian 😍.

Are you hungry and want to chill out then Chez - Pan Oriental Kitchen is the perfect place for you to satisfy your tastebuds at a reasonable price. Their range of exquisite cuisines will never let you down. The ambience is nice overall. I had recently ordered Chicken sweet corn soup, Drums of Heaven, Chez special fried rice and Shredded chicken in oyster sauce for dinner. Trust me each of the item was lip smacking and way above ordinary. I will definitely recommend all of you to pay a visit ASAP. And I am planning for my next visit very soon.

Honestly what matters about a restaurant in today's world where home delivery or take away is prevalent is how good the food is and you won't be disappointed with this restaurant. This place is pretty small compared to some restaurants in the nearby areas but it packs a punch. The food Quality deserves a 5 on 5 but the quantity according to me was pretty less for the price. 

It's a 3.7 from my side. The only problem with this restaurant is space and quantity(might not be for some, I eat a lot.) Improve upon this and you'll be leaving everyone else in the dust. 

P.S- Introducing Hookah would be a good idea.

A new dining space opened near Baghajatin just opposite to Ekta Heights beside Allahabad Bank. It's a cozy space with minimal decor. Now coming to food , it's just too good for Asian food lovers. We had their special Golden Fried Prawns which is served with some unique mango chilli dip. Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish which is crispy fried chunks of fish served with tossed garlic and bell peppers.Mixed Fried Rice & Tausi Chicken cooked in black bean sauce are delicious.
Ended up with delecious desert

The price is indeed pocket friendly. A MUST Visit for Foodies. It is the next sensation in South Kolkata.

So Chez is the name, serving authentic Chinese!

Finally after too many North Indian and multi-cuisine restaurants around this area (Baghajatin), Chez is the place for Asian food; yes, that's right - Chinese, Thai to even Tibetan. 
To start off, I (being a Chinese cuisine lover) ordered Chinese and that too for home delivery. During the busy phase of Durga Puja rush, when most .. rather all of the restaurants would surely disappoint you in some way or the other ..this restaurant amazed me.. by it's quality, quantity, rates. 
I ordered chilli garlic fish, shredded chicken in chilli oyster sauce and chilli garlic mixed rice(without pork). Yup, I wanted something spicy yet tasty. It serves as the item name claims. It was tasty, spicy (as it should be) and simply satisfied my taste buds.

I will definitely recommend people to try this out and take your call. I'm sure you won't be disappointed if you really understand what you are ordering. 

Thank you Chez, I hope you keep up the quality and service. 😊

For main dish try out the mixed fried rice and we ordered chilly honey chicken which was excellent.
Overall a cosy and a nice restaurant to try out some authentic pan oriental dishes. The eatery does justice to the nomenclature for sure. 
Very impressed by the service which was really prompt.

We have been to this place yesterday on the opening day. It's a cozy small dining area with minimal interior yet comfortable. Now coming to food, we had Golden Fried Prawns (6 medium pieces of fresh prawn golden fried till perfection and served with an unusual soya and wine dip), Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish ( 6 large pieces of Basa packed with chilli garlic flavour and bell peppers and onion), Bang Bang Chicken ( This is chef special where they provide 6 medium pieces fried chicken with bone and served with mayo & home made honey chilli dip), Schezwan Fried Fice ( Veg & Mixed). The fried rice was light and packed with egg , chicken and fresh shrimps but the rice qualify could have been better along with little more schezwan flavour. We had veg hakka noodles (again at its best where the noodles are light & white and packed with vegetables). The service was a bit slow considering they just opened yesterday. But certainly it is worth trying.

A newly opened Chinese delicacy in South Kolkata. It's a very lovely place and very pocket-friendly.
The staffs were helpful and ambience was very peaceful.
And Food was even better. We had ordered:-

1. Shanghai fried rice: Perfectly cooked rice with lots of ingredients in it..we took chicken fried rice ,it had lots of veggies and glass noodles too. You can try it with gravy or even dry side dish. It tastes amazing.
2. Beijing's chili chicken: Served with 6chicken pieces which were soft and crispy. Very light food with awesome taste.
3. Darshaan: Chinese Dessert with scoop of vanilla icecream and honeyed crispy noodles(flavours of your choice). Damn yummy!🤗

I must say this will be student's fav corner in few months because of not just quality of food but also the price.
Our total bill was 500. 
Reasonable enough. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.

Burmese pork is what I have ordered....I have never tasted Burmese cuisine earlier so couldn't assure if the dish was authentic or not....But yes the preparation did enrich my tastebuds.....It had a rich creamy and buttery taste with spices on a bit lighter side....and the flavour of "lemon grass" complementing it.....The meat was perfectly tender....but the quantity was on a lesser side compared to the previous pork dishes I ordered....It was a burst of delight in my mouth....

As usual the service was impressive....It was delivered much before the estimated delivery time and was delivered hot....

All South-asian restaurants start well in Calcutta but eventually gets lost....Hope you guys won't disappoint....and be there to continue your service like this....keep it up guys!!!!

Now Coming back to the Item it was pretty good except more pan fried flavour on it.. It could be better

Ordered non veg lemon coriander soup, three treasure fried rice and sliced fish in chef's special sauce. All the dishes very good and the ingredients used were also fresh. Quantity provided seemed to me was little bit less. Taste wise food was good but i could not find anything special taste in their dishes. Please do visit and enjoy their food.

A definite gem hidden within the lanes of Bagha Jatin. A bit tricky to find at first but not too difficult. Once you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by a simplistic decor accompanied by music playing in the background. But dont let the simplicity fool you, as they pack a punch with their food.

We started with the Dragon Phoenix soup and Crispy Chilly babycorn. The soup was pretty good but the babycorn was simply delicious. A nice combination of spices, I must say.
For the main course we had Mixed Hakka noodles, Chez special Oyster Basil noodles and Sliced chicken in Chilly Oyster sauce. All of them were extremely good but the chez special noodles needs a special mention. The basil in the noodles added a tinge of refreshment which made me gorge the entire dish. Definitely a must try. And to top it all, none of the dishes were too oily which we usually associate with Chinese food.
The staffs were polite and prompt. And price wise this place is definitely pocket-friendly. Already planning for the next visit. 😃

Food Quality: Their golden fried prawn is just awesome. Better then some of the popular Chinese restaurant. Main  course pepper fish, Kung Pao chicken, Hoisin fish, sweet and sour soup, Khao pad mix rice was really good. 
I just loved the food, never expected such authentic Chinese food in Bengali area.

Lovely little place, just the way I like. Located in a quite street, not much people, therefore no disturbance. Staff is good. Food is even better. It was pure luck we found this restaurant while walking down the street deciding where to spend our New Year in peace. And we did find a peaceful and cosy place to have our dinner.
Lets talk about the food. Hot and sour soup, yummy. Chicken, egg, mushroom, veggies and a flavourful and hot soup! What more do you need on a cold winter evening?
Veg fried rice, tastes good. Not oily. Hoisin Fish, another great dish. Lovely preparation. The fish was soft and well cooked. The sauce was not very spicy yet tasted very different. I hope this place maintains the quality of their dishes. If they do, then they are sure to attract many foodies! Price is affordable. Food for two costed Rs. 470 with taxes
......
Revisited chez, had veg schezwan fried rice and satin chicken. Fried rice was spicy yet not very hot on your taste buds. Satin chicken was a totally new dish for me. Tasted a bit sweet but flavourful. A good combination with the schezwan rice. 
Keep up the good work!

Ordered Beijing chilli chicken , chilli garlic pepper prawn , garlic pepper pork, schezwan fried rice etc. The service was quick and the delivery was made ahead of schedule. This is the best Chinese till date that I have tasted in town. They are a combination of authenticity and taste. They are much better than the big names in the town and cost effective. The only change that they can possibly adopt is the rice grains they use for the fried rice other wise taste is great. Will keep ordering.......

Ordered online Chicken spinach Burnt Garlic Rice & Chicken chill garlic pepper noodles yesterday. The quantity of both the Dishes were enough to suffice two adults however the Burnt garlic like tasted like normal fried rice.. The aroma of burnt garlic was missing.
The Garlic Pepper noodles had way too much pepper for my liking.. But i will recommend it over the burnt garlic rice any day..... Food was delivered on time...

Chez-Pan Oriental Kitchen has been a pleasant surprise. Serving predominantly Chinese cuisine, this newly opened restaurant packs a punch in dine-in as well as delivery. 
Most recently I had ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and the Pepper Garlic Mixed Noodles.It was promptly delivered by 45 minutes time. Both were sumptuous and the quantity was well enough for 2 people. Much recommended folks !
This is definitely not the only time I am ordering here.

Ordered chilli chicken and fried rice. The chicken fried rice wasn't that flavourful. I've had better fried rice elsewhere at the same price. But it wasn't totally bad.
The chilli chicken was a little too salty but otherwise tasted good. However, some of the chicken pieces seemed raw.
So I'm a tad bit disappointed .

However, right after I wrote this review I got a call from the restaurant. They felt apologetic of the incident, and took the details of my experience and promised to change my poor opinion of them. 

So they parceled one plate of chili chicken to my house and I must say it tasted very very good. The right amount of salt. The chicken was succulent and well cooked not raw. I am very impressed. Hope to visit your restaurant soon for a meal !
Well done guys!

I had no idea, that there is a small Chinese paradise near baghajatin!!!! Their Chinese cuisine is just awesome. I'm a big soup fan and when I tasted there different soups I simply blew my mind off!!!! Plus the noodles, starters and main dishes do justice to the Chinese cuisine and I would definitely recommend it!!!!

Another new chinese corner in South Kolkata. We had ordered food home. Plus points : good quality containers, delivery pretty fast and some new hint into the ordinary chinese recipes. We really liked the lemon coriander soup & the ginger honey chicken. I personally recommend these 2 along with their chicken fried rice. It was non sticky, well cooked & freshly made! However the pan fried noodle was not that great, the noodles were too deep fried. But on complaining about the same they had delivered a pan fried noodle next day for free. Though the black sauce tasted better than the white sauce but the noodles remained deep fried & extra crisp. But this gesture needs to be applauded.

Ordered dinner last night. We ordered Beijing chilli chicken, Pan fried noodles, chicken fried rice, and kung pao chicken. 
The food was delivered on time and was well packed in air tight packets. 
The food itself needs to be improved. The starter was okay. Nothing exemplary. The pan fried noodles wasn't well cooked and was the most disappointing item, although I found it to be highly recommended here. Kung Pao chicken was the only item I really enjoyed. 
I hope they put more care in the taste as much they do in delivering!

All these items were very exceptional. Chily chicken was very different in taste which is good. Although satin chicken was tasty but the gravy was little sweet. Quantity was very good and price is also reasonable.

It is situated in baghajatin opposite to vijaya bank atm .
I ordered indonesian chicken,woon sen soup , pan fried noodles.
Pan fried noodles really taste awesome and highly recommended and also thumps up goes to indonesian chicken.
But woon sen soup doesn't taste good at all a raw ginger smell was coming not at all taste good.
One thing main they should increase quantity a little bit.
Overall service is good aswell as the behaviour.
Price is okk.

Chez is a newly opened restaurant near baghajatin area offering pan asian delicacies. My friend & I randomly decided to try a new place and this place being on my wishlist so we zeroed down on this. Well initially we had difficulty in locating the place but somehow found it. The google maps also doesn't work properly to locate this. Chez is located just in the opposite lane of the bank beside Ekta Heights complex.

The dine in area is fairly spacious with dimly lit all around. The place does have AC as comfort. The kitchen is almost open which could be from the seats. The service girl certainly made our dine in a very memorable one with proper infos about the availability of menu items and also recommendations. Anyways cutting back to the chase we had the following array of items:-

1. Indonesian chicken satay - 4 pcs of garlic & herb charred satay were served along with peanut dip. The chicken was tender & were perfectly cooked. The peanut dip served was miles better than served in other places. Recommended.

2. Roasted chilli pork - To me this was the star of our menu. Chunky large pieces of juicy luscious heavenly roasted were served with chopped garlics,onions,chillies and lemongrass. The taste of lemongrass just took the dish to the next level. The quantity was also large. The dish was also very spicy so be mention it to tone it down if you are a non spicy lover. Also in my opinion this was the best chilli pork which i have tasted anywhere in the city. In the end we ended up with another plate of it. Highly Recommended.

3. Pan seared fish - 8pcs of soft flaky fried basa prepared with mushroom,onions,garlic and special sauce. The dish was comparatively mild but it was good in taste.

4. Pan fried noodles mixed - Classic good old pan fried noodles in gravy mix of vegetables,chicken,pork,prawn. You have the option to opt for boiled noodles or fried ones. We opted for the boiled version. The quantity was again huge. The noodles also complimented very well with the gravy mix. It was an absolute delight to eat. Recommended.

5. Darsaan - We wanted to try their fried ice cream but unfortunately it wasn't available. So instead we took darsaan with a twist. We were informed that wonton noodle were over, so basically we were served with plain thin honey noodles as replacement with vanilla ice cream. The darsaan was well prepared but the usage of thin noodles were over fried a bit with the presence of excess honey which resulted in the hardening of the noodles creating difficulty in breaking down the noodles. A minor flaw though.

The savoury dishes were absolutely to die for & just bowled us over with its quality and taste. Also their mocktails are currently unavailable for service. The pocket pinch was Rs 700 per head. They charge separate GST. The service was also superb. Keep up the good work

I am really excited to try the others on the menu in near future. It's been long I had something oriental in the real sense. I like oriental food in its real sense and they served it.

On the hunt for a new eating joint , travelled with my foodie friend to Chez hearing positive things about it . A lazy Saturday evening set the backdrop for a place where my focus was on good food and an enjoyable experience , which is exactly what we received.

This being our first time into the restaurant , we ordered a range of cuisines to cater to our palette . Starters came in the form of Indonesian Chicken Satay and Roasted Chilli Pork , followed by pan fried noodles with a grave base , pan seared fish and topped off in the end with Darshan , the classical dessert of today’s times . 

The food was delightful and the pork itself was heavenly , so much so , we ended up ordering an additional plate . The place had a quiet vibe , perfect for a conversation and seemed quite pocket friendly as well . The staff was courteous and the server who took our order was extremely friendly and eager to help out . She was the definition of customer service done right and with a smile. 

The only gripe is that the mocktails has not yet started even though they were on the menu . In a way , this gives me more incentive for my next visit . 

A delightful experience , in every way .

The newest kid on the block when it comes to Oriental cuisine. Went there yesterday and I must say I came away impressed.
FOOD: We had the Dragon Phoenix Soup which was loaded with chicken and veggies and was the perfect warm broth you need in the winters.
For main course we had shanghai rice mixed and chicken in hot basil sauce. Both the dishes complemented each other very well and were full of flavour. Special mention must go to the rice which had some pickled vegetables in it and was unlike anything I've tasted before.

AMBIENCE: Now this was a downer. The seating is not all comfortable neither is the place done up well. At best classifies as an eating house, nothing more. The furniture will remind you of kindergarten schools.

PRICE: Dirt cheap. A meal for two would cost around 600 at the most and quantity provided is decent enough as well.

Ordered food from Chez today. The packaging was brilliant as we had the food approx. 1 Hr after the food was delivered and it was still hot. We ordered:
Mixed Old Style Fried Rice.
Mixed Singapore Style Rice Noodles - I always prefer rice noodles over plain noodles and Chez didn't disappoint me.
Chilly Pork Dry - Must try. The meat was tender and juicy.
Kung Pao Chicken.
Tausi Chicken - Must try. Tried it for the 1st time and it was a winner.
Blackbeans & 3 Bellpepper Fish - Must try for fish lovers. Amazing preparation.
Traditional Chilli Chicken.
Would definitely recommend Chez for people who love Asian Cuisine. The quality and quantity of food was very good.

Ordered via swiggy. Didn't dissapoint. Burmese Pork sipyan was different and liked it the most. The starters in Basa fish and Pad kring something  chicken started was good as well. Jasmine rice was nice. Didn't like sambal udang as much as the rest. The gravy was too dilute and portions too low. Portions in rest of the item was decent but not too generous but good enough. I wish they would introduce more and more asian special items so that we get introduced to hitherto undiscovered/ not much popular cuisines and their dishes.

I have asked for a delivery, and it was made before time. So first impression is a thumb's up.
Secondly, the package was done very neatly. Food comes in a black lided box wrapped in cellophane paper. Hence, second impression was on point too.
Third and most important, I have ordered simple veg Friedrice and schezwan Friedrice, the rice is well cooked with full of colourful vegetables. The Thai basil chicken had a lot of chicken slices and yummy gravy to team with.
Fourth, the prices are unbelievably affordable. The rates simply surprised me as the quality and quantity was amazing.

Ordered a roasted Chilli Pork from Chez and I must say, I was fairly surprised. The Chili Pork hit the taste buds just right. And the pork was juicy and succulent. The flavors were strong and the quantity was substantial enough.Will try this place again. Sudden food cravings satisfied!

Burmese fish noodle soup: this has a clear broth with with a boiled egg, noodles, and fish.. it is very delicious. Sufficient to kill your hunger. 

Meat dumplings: clear soup with the dumplings in it. It was really very simple and awesome.

Veg Hakka noodles: this was a simple preparation worth the money.

Pad thai noodles: these were good too.

Just being in a mood of sheer experiment on a Friday night, tried out Chez Pan Oriental kitchen and boy oh boy, it turned out to be a delicious revelation.
Ordered  Poh Taek Soup and Indonesian Satay chicken. The Poh Taek soup was really authentic, assimilating Thai herbs and seafood comprising of prawn and white fish fillet. It could have been more spicy with fresh bird eye chilli, however I reckon it had been customized to appease the Indian taste bud and the result was more than satisfactory.
Indonesian Satay Chicken was a clear winner  surpassing our expectations. The chicken was tender, juicy and flavourful, the peanut butter sauce being the icing on the cake. The quantity could have been a bit more, after cherishing and becoming awed by the quality of what we had, we clearly were in a mood of ravenously devouring more.
Overall was very satiated with the food quality, the breezy service and the cordial behaviour, would look forward to try out the other dishes in the coming days.

A newly opened restaurant at Bagha Jatin with a great menu. To follow it up they have been doing some good things as can be deciphered from the lovely reviews on Zomato. So, we decided to give this place a try and ordered loads of stuff, both vegetarian and non vegetarian. The food was awesome.... No complaints regarding that aspect (certainly the most important aspect). The chef did a wonderful job.... and the entire kitchen deserves a big thumbs up. Our order consisted of -
Soup: Veg Lemon Chilli Burnt Garlic Soup
Starters: Nam Prik Pao Gai, Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish,
Mains: Chicken Hakka Style Noodles, Mixed Shanghai Fried Rice, Shitake and Butter Mushroom in Hot Basil sauce, Traditional Chilli Chicken, Sliced Chicken in Hot Basil Sauce, Vegetarian Spinach Burnt Garlic Rice.

What I would like to highlight is the efforts they put in to correct a mistake of theirs and put a smile on the faces of their customers.
While having dinner we realised that one of the dishes was missing and promptly called them to let them know. The management was extremely apologetic and wanted to send the item immediately. Being very late, I asked them to send it over the next day, which they accepted. The truth in a country like ours is that things are forgotten pretty easily and conveniently and I was actually sceptical about whether they would keep it in mind. But not in this case. I was pleasantly surprised by a call in the morning from them asking me the time I wanted to receive the remaining dish from the previous day's order. Not only did they send it over, but they also sent a complimentary bottle of ThumsUp.... a very touching gesture on their part. Such exceptional levels of service are a rarity and each one of us in our family was overwhelmed. People do make mistakes, but it is the effort they put in to correct it and not repeat the same is what assures greatness.
Frankly, I was thinking of giving them a rating of 4.0, but their service skyrocketed the rating.
I hope they keep up their good work and that complacency never sets in. Best wishes to them.

Don't usually review but this one was special. I ordered Old Style Pork Fried Rice and Beijing Chilly Chicken and have to say the food was amazing. The rice was great and the chicken was one of the most flavourful cineese dish I have ate. Didn't expect the food to be so tasteful. 
P.S. If they call to review their food that's because this is a freakin business and this is how they feed themselves. And they are doing a wonderful job while doing that. So think a bit before you bad mouth on the internet.

Ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Chilli Garlic Fish from this joint last night. The rice was well-prepared. The other dish lacked a bit with regards to the gravy - it was hot, but not as flavoursome as I would've liked. However, the fish itself was exemplary - both in texture and in taste. Overall, I was satisfied with my meal. As Chez is a new restaurant, I'm pretty sure they'd improve over time and manage to deliver that extra oomph. Would order again soon!

We had an amazing meal at Chez at last night. After a long time we got to taste some chilli roast pork which matched the standards of the best in the city, which made the evening all the more better. The dragon and phoenix soup was exquisite and something off the basic Chinese and Asian food menu. The pan seared fish gave a tangy twist to the starters and we relished it as much. In the main course we had spinach burnt garlic rice along with prawn in chef's special sauce. The rice went very well along with the side and was also lip-smacking. We had a wonderful experience and hope to come back.

Shanghai Mixed fried rice is some thing different in taste but it is good.i thought roasted chilli pork to be more dry. Chilly garlic chicken noodle was very tasty. Hoisin pork was ok but shredded chicken in oyster sauce was excellent. Chicken was fresh and tender. We all loved it

Night hunger pangs and Zomato go hand in hand! So when a similar episode occurred a few hours earlier tonight, I naturally went busy browsing through all the delicacies that could satiate my deprived soul. And what better way to comfort one's soul than a steaming bowl of Thai curry? Also having felt kind of adventurous since morning, I decided to give in to my instincts, ditch the tried and tested restaurants and opt for a completely new one. 

As they say : always trust your instincts.

 The salted shitake mushrooms that I had added as an afterthought was a winner. The black mushrooms were fresh, tossed in generous amounts of presumably olive oil and spiced with cilantro, crushed black pepper and three colored bellpeppers. The prawn red curry I ordered came with a bowl full of plain steamed rice, the perfect blank slate to compliment the very many flavors of the curry. And like all good Thai curries, they nailed the curry paste, with all the ingredients standing out and not overpowering one another.

 The bill came to around 500 bucks and left me full and happy.

Chez - A great pan oriental kitchen to satiate your cravings at reasonable prices. 
=====
Location & Intro:

It is located in Bapujinagar Road, Baghajatin, Kolkata. To be more precise, opposite Ekta Heights building tucked away in a small lane. The best way to reach is by asking for Ekta Heights.

I had visited here along with a friend of mine to try out the chinese food out here. It is quite a new joint. The ambiance of the place focuses on the chic and modern aspect. Nonetheless, We took our seats in the cute chairs here and started scrolling the a la carte. 

They have quite a lot of variety to offer. As mentioned earlier, the prices are not very high and have been kept quite reasonable as well. 
=====
What i had:

• Indonesian Satay Chicken - The chicken was quite tender and juicy. It was flavorful as well. The peanut butter as usual was complementing the dish. However, one recommendation would be to make the peanut butter more thicker. 

• Old School Chicken Shrimp Egg Fried Rice - I usually like my fried rice to be plain rice and i like tryin out the side dishes. The rice was perfect. It was light and was topped with fried garlic which was like icing on the cake. 

• Tausi Chicken - It was more of shredded chicken tossed in black bean sauce. The pieces were quite good in quantity for two. However, the soya sauce levels could have been just reduced by slight so as to avoid the sourness to the dish. Nonetheless, again, i loved the presentation. It was presented with spring onions on the top.

• Strawberry Crispy Noodles with Peanut Crumbs - This was something which i had not tried before. The dessert if you call it was light, crispy and enjoyable. 
=====
Meal for two: 350-700 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.) 
=====
Pros:

• Have quite a large variety of items to select from. (Pan Oriental Cuisine)
• Good ambiance.
• Reasonably priced.
=====
Summary: 

Presentation 4/5

Taste 4/5

Quality 4/5

Quantity 4.2/5

Ambiance 3.8/5

Hospitality 4.2/5

Conclusion:

It was a great experience here. The food was quite good here and it did not make me feel heavy that much.

I have been really eager to try this restaurant since couple of weeks and finally got the chance..being located inside an alley we struggled a bit to find it.. It has a nice comfortable ambience and the staff is courteous and attentive... 
Coming to the food,  we had 
Velvet mushroom soup 
Nam prik pao gai 
General qing chicken 
Golden fried prawn 
I really loved the food except general qing chicken.. It was a bit salty for me..  Apart from that no complaints.. Pocket pinch is on the lower side so that's a plus.. 
A small suggestion -  it would be nice if they add curtains or mat to the windows and start accepting card... 🙂

I ordered for one chicken Shanghai fried rice. there preparation is authentic.. its a must try. prodigious amount of veggies and chicken(which is not the case with most of the restaurants), it tasted delicious.
satisfied my taste buds, as well my gargantuan appetite.

Located in a very convenient place, right opposite to Ekta heights, this oriental kitchen offers a plethora of asian/chinese/tibetian/Burmese/Thai dishes. 
I tasted konjee crispy lamb, shredded chicken in chilli oyster sauce, pan fried noodles and golden fried prawn. 
The taste is really authentic and the ambiance is pretty interesting because you can actually experience the work in progress if you keep visiting. 
The service is pretty good and the staff are very hospital. The outlet is clean and the meat quality is excellent!

Perfect. Nice ambience. The best part is the food. A lot of new thing. Just planned to have food with my family and friends. I was awestruck by finding such a tasty food. They also do delivery which is the best part. Ordered Chinese and found a perfect food to make my Sunday evening memorable. I will refer
@ them to my friends definitely. Thanks to chez and all their staff members. Golden fried prawn, mixed fried rice, chilli chicken and drumstick , all were delicious and perfect fit to taste. I will  e there in the coming weekends and will try more to explore their food hub.

On a dark and wet rainy day, I needed a simple dish of fish to have with steamed rice with butter. My first choice would always be Chili Garlic Pepper Fish. Seeing Chez new on Zomato I went ahead to try out the dish there. And they made me happy. A simple standard dish delivered on time. The fish pieces were cut properly and cooked well. The flavor and aroma was perfect as it should be. A bit deviated from the good old authentic version of the dish thats is usually available in Tangra but it had its own style. It made my lunch perfect and yes, I would like to hit this joint again with a plan for full lunch or dinner to check out some of the other items in the menu.

Found this little corner very near my house. It's a small restaurant good for family outings or small groups of friends. We were the only customers at that point, even then the service was slow, although being very courteous.
The golden fried prawns are to die for, the covering being crispy light and the prawns cooked extremely well. The crispy chilli babycorn was good, although not great. The pan fried noodles, chilli garlic fish, fried rice and shredded chicken in oyster sauce was extremely good. Darshan was also nicely made, albeit a bit too sweet. Very good experience. Pocket pinch for 5 was 2k.

A new kid near my house.
Location : opp lane of Vijaya bank ATM/Tulip Hall School near central park or ekta heights (krishna Glass).
Service: helpful and friendly staff
Ambience: simple, neat and clean.
Food: they serve a good variety of pan asian dishes. I went there for lunch and since it was a saturday i had to opt for veg dishes. I tried their burnt lemon garlic soup, it comes with a strong essence of burnt garlic and and lemon.. pretty nice.
Then i went for their wheat noodles, mind you wheat noodles are not available in all places, thus i was excited to see this. It was well prepared with good amount of veggies.

Over all a good initiative. Best wishes.

Today I was in a mood to try a budget friendly new place after the money draining puja week. I had come across this name during puja but overlooked it as experimentation can be disastrous in that period. Today after debating with myself on checking the zomato rating I went to the place without any preconceived notions.  The place is comfortably spacious for a budget place , smells of new paint and furniture. Adequately air conditioned for a peaceful meal. Ordered Chicken lemon coriander soup and chicken manchow soup ....for starters ordered golden fried prawn and Beijing chilli chicken. The manchow soup was better with the right flavours lemon coriander was a tad bit over sour than the usual ones. They served fresh crispy fried noodles with manchow.  Starters were mind blowing ..Beijing Chilli chicken was the tangra chilli chicken nice firm 11 pieces tossed with chillies , onion and capsicum. ..very satisfying. Now mentioning the STAR dish GOLDEN FRIED PRAWNS. ...beautiful light crispy batter coated big fleshy prawns...6 pieces served with a sweet chilli dip for 210 buck .Quite a deal foodies indulging in seafood would get what I'm talking about...I like spicy sauces so they served a homemade red chilli sauce which was out of the world. Immediately i ordered a repeat for the prawns. Absolutely rocking. Mains we had a Mixed Pan Fried noodles with crispy noodles only which was proactively customized according to my choice as I didn't feel like having soft pan fried noodles. Really appreciate their effort at customer service. Very pocket friendly highly recommended place. .Go foodies happy exploring...Did I mention they have a fair bit of Thai , Malaysian, Indonesian 😍.

Are you hungry and want to chill out then Chez - Pan Oriental Kitchen is the perfect place for you to satisfy your tastebuds at a reasonable price. Their range of exquisite cuisines will never let you down. The ambience is nice overall. I had recently ordered Chicken sweet corn soup, Drums of Heaven, Chez special fried rice and Shredded chicken in oyster sauce for dinner. Trust me each of the item was lip smacking and way above ordinary. I will definitely recommend all of you to pay a visit ASAP. And I am planning for my next visit very soon.

Honestly what matters about a restaurant in today's world where home delivery or take away is prevalent is how good the food is and you won't be disappointed with this restaurant. This place is pretty small compared to some restaurants in the nearby areas but it packs a punch. The food Quality deserves a 5 on 5 but the quantity according to me was pretty less for the price. 

It's a 3.7 from my side. The only problem with this restaurant is space and quantity(might not be for some, I eat a lot.) Improve upon this and you'll be leaving everyone else in the dust. 

P.S- Introducing Hookah would be a good idea.

A new dining space opened near Baghajatin just opposite to Ekta Heights beside Allahabad Bank. It's a cozy space with minimal decor. Now coming to food , it's just too good for Asian food lovers. We had their special Golden Fried Prawns which is served with some unique mango chilli dip. Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish which is crispy fried chunks of fish served with tossed garlic and bell peppers.Mixed Fried Rice & Tausi Chicken cooked in black bean sauce are delicious.
Ended up with delecious desert

The price is indeed pocket friendly. A MUST Visit for Foodies. It is the next sensation in South Kolkata.

So Chez is the name, serving authentic Chinese!

Finally after too many North Indian and multi-cuisine restaurants around this area (Baghajatin), Chez is the place for Asian food; yes, that's right - Chinese, Thai to even Tibetan. 
To start off, I (being a Chinese cuisine lover) ordered Chinese and that too for home delivery. During the busy phase of Durga Puja rush, when most .. rather all of the restaurants would surely disappoint you in some way or the other ..this restaurant amazed me.. by it's quality, quantity, rates. 
I ordered chilli garlic fish, shredded chicken in chilli oyster sauce and chilli garlic mixed rice(without pork). Yup, I wanted something spicy yet tasty. It serves as the item name claims. It was tasty, spicy (as it should be) and simply satisfied my taste buds.

I will definitely recommend people to try this out and take your call. I'm sure you won't be disappointed if you really understand what you are ordering. 

Thank you Chez, I hope you keep up the quality and service. 😊

The food was great and a definite value for money.Must try is the golden fried prawn served with 2 different dips made of wine and honey which is truly unique.
For main dish try out the mixed fried rice and we ordered chilly honey chicken which was excellent.
Overall a cosy and a nice restaurant to try out some authentic pan oriental dishes. The eatery does justice to the nomenclature for sure. 
Very impressed by the service which was really prompt.

We have been to this place yesterday on the opening day. It's a cozy small dining area with minimal interior yet comfortable. Now coming to food, we had Golden Fried Prawns (6 medium pieces of fresh prawn golden fried till perfection and served with an unusual soya and wine dip), Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish ( 6 large pieces of Basa packed with chilli garlic flavour and bell peppers and onion), Bang Bang Chicken ( This is chef special where they provide 6 medium pieces fried chicken with bone and served with mayo & home made honey chilli dip), Schezwan Fried Fice ( Veg & Mixed). The fried rice was light and packed with egg , chicken and fresh shrimps but the rice qualify could have been better along with little more schezwan flavour. We had veg hakka noodles (again at its best where the noodles are light & white and packed with vegetables). The service was a bit slow considering they just opened yesterday. But certainly it is worth trying.
