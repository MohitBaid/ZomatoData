This joint may be small , but the quality and quantitty of food was really nice , i ordered cheesy vada pav which was nice filled with cheese and i also ordered the veg cheese burger , it was a giant burger it took me some effort to complete that , it was also very good , filled with cheese , and sauces overall good quality and quantity , but again they need to open a sitting area

Being a localite in this area, I was surprised that how could i miss a joint like this. Cheesy vada pav here will surprise you, sandwiches are above average & pizzas are far btter than dominos. Great place.

Surprised by the fact that such a little counter can serve such quality food and that too makes home deliveries! Staff is very amiable. Dated 4th October 2015
