We had gone to Cafe o Kobita but since it was packed we were asked to be seated in Mr.Burger. 
It is small cafe yet beautifully decorated with newpaper cuttings,books which adds so much bengali feel to it. There are even a variety of board games to choose from and we played a round of ludo.
We ordered fish and French fries, cold coffee and hot chocolate.
We loved those fish cutlets along which were moist and perfectly cooked.

I have to visit again and try their burgers..üòä

This is a small restaurant near the Shyambazar metro station, occupying the ground floor, with a seating capacity of 12 people only. Yet Mr. Burger draws many customers due to the awesome continental dishes they serve.
The menu is kept conveniently small for a cute little restaurant with less crowd. They serve sandwiches, burgers, wraps, croquettes and pasta.
I loved this cozy place with plenty of Chetan Bhagat books and a ludo board on the shelf. They have a bigger restaurant 'Coffee o Kobita' under the same management, on the 1st floor, which is equally good and serves from the same kitchen.

I did not visit this place, but I ordered from here, so my review will just be about their food. I ordered a Chelo meal consisting of Parsley rice, Grilled chicken, chicken and veg nugget,poached eggs and boiled vegetables. Every thing was delicious and the quantity was generous, I'll go as far as to say that 3 plates will be enough for 4 people. The food was packed very well in aluminium foil boxes and came with a nice red bag. All in all, pretty satisfactory for the price as well.

I don't understand why this place is so averagely rated in zomato. They serve one of the best burgers in the city. The bread in the burger is so soft that it melts in your mouth. The ingredients between the breads are fresh and delicious. The prices are easy on the pocket . The staff is friendly and atmosphere is so calm and soothing ~ a stark contrast to the snarling Shyambazar traffic outside. So now you know , when you are hungry for burgers, where to head!

A small place near shyambazar metro station. 
One will love the ambience of it, for it gives a historic vibe. There are pictures of the historical times put up. Then they have small bookshelves, with a great collection of books. There's a guitar hanging on one side of the wall, too. 
The staff were nice.
The service was okay. The food wasn't good tho. We ordered a chicken silican, which was supposed to have asparagus in it. But instead, it had baby corn and mushroom, about which we weren't informed. The main head said that it was a printing mistake on the menu, but they didn't seem to pay attention to it when we placed the order. We left there, utterly disappointed. 
I did like the place, solely because of its ambience and the vibes it gave.

Had a great evening today. Food were lovely, Spcl Mr.Burger and Hot Dog. The mayonnaise with the Burger was veey good. The taste was perfect. The burger was huge,and its enough for one person to completely fill the hunger. The hog dog was also good, it was also big. Total price of Hotdog and Burger including gst was Rs.299. Price was reasonable. But one Major disadvantage of the place is lack of a Wash Basin. No way to wash your hand before or after the meal. They should understand that we eat burger with our hand,not spoons and forks. so we need to wash hand before or after the meal. Except that everything was good.

I love what they've done with the interiors. The renovation should pay off !
They've also restocked the menu and you cannot complain.
First off, wonderful place to go chilling with your college gang. They have board game, books, good music, et all.
Coming to the food, they serve good burgers. The filling is plenty. Although, I'd prefer better size because there's been an increase in prices post GST.
They've introduced a new hot dog to the menu, it's huge! For INR 125 it is perfectly satisfying for one or even two people to relish. Shakes aren't bad! And the ambience just makes up for the rest.

They have an extended outlet inside, Cafe Coffee o' Kobita, that makes up for the lack of space here.

Altogether a wonderful experience and the staff is very welcoming. Would recommend everyone to drop by for a quick bite because it's located just beside the main exit of Shyambazar Metro Station. Location couldn't have been more convenient!

This was the 1st time I had burgers from this place. I had seen the place before but never visited it. So this time it was a parcel that was brought by my parents. I had this meal as my dinner after a long train journey and I really fell in love with their burgers. I can really say that their items are original and made by heart and I felt it‚Äôs burgers tastes far better than Mc Donald‚Äôs ones. Even I have to say their fish and chips are also wonderful and they do keep the standard and quality to satisfy their customers.

Being a burger fan i was very happy seeing a burger joint on the busy street of shayam bazar across the lane of metro station.
Orderd a mr special burger and the burger came within no time. 
It consists of a fried patty along with a fried fillet of chiken breast with a slice of tomato and shredded lettuce.
The bun could be much better in terms of quality amd size.
Fried fillet was good but the patty was not juicy and full of bread breadcrumbs.
Please increase the quantity of chicken mince and season it.
As there was no sauces whole burger was dry.
Ambience is good but you should improve your fillings.

Nice place. We ordered the Mr. Burger meal which comes with either grilled or fried chicken. I tried the grilled and my friend had the fried one. The burger was not up to my expectations, maybe because i expected too much. But the thing that worth a 5 star is the French fries... One of the best fries I've ever had!! And the staff are friendly and helpful too. The one thing i hope they will improve is the ambience and space... There's hardly a space for a group of friends. But overall, it's good, not great , simply good

I am giving the 3 for the craft (the making of the food) and decorations otherwise I don't think I'll visit it twice. It can be 5 star for people who love the chicken patty to be chicken keema but I don't. The virgin mojito was my mistake, it was clearly written on the menu : (Mint) and I flat on ignored it and bought it. Don't have to remind you that lemon and mint shake will not be in my likable list if it tasted like that.

Just beside the Shyambazar metro station Gate 2. Cafe o kobita and Mr. Burger are adjacent to each other. 
It's a small Cafe with a very Bengali feeling to it. The walls are decorated with old newspaper cuttings laminated and pictures framed.
I tried their grilled chicken cheese burger. It was accompanied with a mayo, cabbage and carrot salad. I loved the burger as the chicken patty was juicy. The bun was fresh and soft. I had a good burger after a long time. 
They also keep Bengali and English newspaper on each table which I loved the most. You can read the newspaper while waiting for your food. Overall a nice food joint you can try with your friends and family if you're in North Kolkata.

During this Puja hullabaloo, my cousins and I dropped into this place to satisfy our hunger pangs after pandal hopping. Not very difficult to locate,thanks to Google maps. Luckily we found ourselves a four seated table without having to wait for long. Quickly placed an order for virgin mojito ,hot chocolate and an egg cheese sandwich. Took a little while to fetch our order but that's excusable considering the demands during festive season. The sandwich was delectable. Hot chocolate looked yummy and was good too. Virgin mojito was refreshing but could be improved in it's flavor. The place is cool. The walls covered with photo frames of vintage Kolkata ,gives it a unique ambience. The place is small but they have managed the area efficiently without making it feel clumsy.  Prices are a tad high I feel. Nevertheless, a cool place to hang out amidst the hustle bustle of Shyambazar.

Located just next to the metro station, this place is cozy and small.

Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Cheese Burgers, Chicken Cheese Croquettes, Chicken Wrap, and White Sauce Pasta. I only tasted the Croquettes and the Pasta so I'll be commenting on those. The Pasta is good. There are enough pieces of chicken in it to actually call it a chicken pasta. The sauce is slightly bland but you can add oregano and/or chili flakes to it to make it taste like you want. The croquettes were also juicy and perfectly done- neither too crispy nor too soggy.

Value for money when it comes to food. The only problem with this joint is the service here. The staff is aloof. They didn't give us water. When we asked for it, they took 10 minutes to get glasses and then served us water. They also didn't provide us with tissue papers - we had to ask for it.

With lip smacking and sinfully delicious food , this brimming cafe, slightly high on pocket , right near Shyambazar five point crossing has become my recent favourite. North kolkata has finally come up with a cafe people can add to their 'where to eat' list (not to forget about coffee o kobita , right upstairs which is equally good) .
The place is pointingly small but that's the last thing you can care about . Especially when you're about to devour yourself in a plate of classic fish and chips.
The menu doesn't take you for a ride. The choices are pretty handful but they made sure they're the best you've had. At least in North and they proved it.
I would personally like if they work more on the ambience to attract youth from every corner of the city.
P.s- the gst they charge will make you cry in a corner.
So, what we ordered : Mr.Burger special burger ( with two patties of chicken. One fried, the other grilled) , Classic fish and chips , Chocolate milkshake with vanilla ice cream.
Taste - 4.5/5
Ambience- 3/5
Value for money- 3.5/5

North Kolkata has finally got a new gem to add to its crown. In a place well known for renowned traditional eateries, this little joint could have had a tough time gaining stars, had their food not been way too delicious! Simply irresistible is what defines this tiny place. I am not a great burger fan, but this place made me fall in love with their soft yet crispy burger delicacy! And yes, they don't serve all bread... burgers here, are completely loaded! *_*
Mocktails taste just fine.
Have not tried the chello meal on the first visit so cannot comment on it.
The French Fries do not come in a great quantity, but they taste good. One thing that I found worth mentioning is that the oil used here is really good, unlike most other little junk food joints. 
A great place to hang out with a small group of friends. Very pocket friendly. Recommended.

We went there yesterday evening.. We were pretty much satisfied with there quality of food.. We ordered,
* Mr. Fried Chicken Cheese Burger
* Mr. Grilled Chicken Cheese Burger
* Chicken Pasta in Creamy White Sauce
*Burger- The taste of burger is really good. They are serving a good quantity of chicken staff, lettuce and mayonnaise in it.. And the burger is served with carrot-cabbage mayo dip and tomato sauce.. And the size of burger is very impressive..
*Pasta- Now the pasta part, the quantity of pasta is much more for one head. And the taste is so smoothy and creamy. And the quantity of chicken pieces in pasta are so generous. But the pasta is little bit over-cooked. Except that, the pasta is so finger licking..
And the ambience is quite nice.. A small pocket friendly cafe with some sitting arrangements..
Good experience...

So a really cool joint, opened just in the busy crossing of shyambazar, situated just beside the metro gate near titan.
So we went in, and the first vibe was like, wow finally a cafe in shyambazar!
Though they do not exactly resemble a cafe with books, indoor games or music, but in the hustles and bustles of the busy shyambazar street, you will find peace inside, and have some tasty burgers, which is really in short supply in this side of the town.
I ordered a burger meal which had a chicken burger, fries, and a glass of cold drink. The burger was freshly made, and the fries were perfect too, i think they should start providing a dip with the platter that will make it more attractive. The prices are a bit in the higher side,considering the quantity, but i'll surely revisit for their food.
The decoration is really well done, the walls have newspaper clippings of major historic events, and i was hooked on for the whole time on reading them :)

The time when I shifted to north kolkata the place did not have any cafes to hang out or to go and grab a bite however it is mesmerising to see the evolution taking places , more food joints cropping up witj good quality food and nice decor to offer maybe not as cool as the south cafes are . But quite a refreshment for the North Kolkata localites . So I visited this place today with my mom , though I have ordered one dish via platform before , tried their fish and chips which was mouth watering but a bit too oily . So I would recommend to drain the exces oil after frying , the crunchyness was heavenly and my mum loved it so much that she is gonna order the next week too as she is an ardent fish lover . This place accentuated my liking for fish which I did not have but lately . We packed the chello grilled chicken platter as that is finger licking good which presents chicken breasts in rich garlicy , creamy gravy , rice fried with parsley , two chops one each of chicken and stuffed vegies and accompanied by some sauted veggies which balances the platter . I like trying new and out of the box dishes hence went for these two items. , next time will some basic snacks like sandwiches , pastas, shakes , etc . This was all about food and now coming to the decor and ambience . The staff is okay - nothing to be amused with but the name of the cafe gets justified by its quirky yet bong touch and the hygiene is maintained . Its even more evident of the North Calculltan culture when Rabindra Sangeet plays in the backgroud giving more feel of the contemporary bengalis . Thats all I could jot down for today , maybe next time some more things to discuss .

This joint is situated just next shyambazar metro gate so it wasn't a hard job for us to search this place. But unfortunately we found that place is closed today due to some technical faults. 
So we decided to visit cafe coffee o kobita which is just beside it. But surprisingly we got to know that due to fuse the joint is closed and the food from Mr. burger can be served there only. Lucky us. 
Coming on to the food. We ordered fish and chips, Cappuccino and mocha. 
The Fish was very moist and soft and the perfectly fried chips were complementing it very well. 
Overall its a great place for coffee lovers and fish and chips is a must try.

Having been here often, I can personally vouch for this place. All the food is reasonably priced and would get an A w.r.t quality and quantity. Being a coffee lover, I feel the coffee here is equally good and rather cheaper compared to other outlets like CCD or so. I would recommend the fish and chips, chicken pasta in white sauce and definitely the burgers(they have a good enough meat to bun ratio).
The service is quick and courteous. And the ambience is cozy and has a friendly feel to it. It's also located conveniently, and hence, would recommend it to everyone.

Had the fried chicken burger and cold coffee..price and taste both were okay but for the price of the burger, they should serve some french fries along with it.

Heard about this place from a friend of mine so decided to try it out myself . It's a little joint located opposite to Shyambazar Metro , easy to find. Typical fast food kind of decor with retro Kolkata touch . The staffs are helpful and friendly . Fast service . Coming to the food we order Fish and chips and two kind of burger meals . The fish and chips was a real delight . The grilled burger was better than the fried one . We packed one for home and their packing was simply superb. Overall pretty decent experience , planning to visit again ..

The second best Burgers in Kolkata after Burger You in Kasba. Had Mr. Burger Special meal. It was so much better than over-rated McDonald's and KFC. And it even costs less. Its a small place though. Only about 12 people can sit I suppose. But its awesome.

Right next to shyambazar metro gate , dropped in this cute little place to grab some burgers . The cafe is smallish , divided into two small rooms with separate entrances , each with four tables . In case one wants to sit and chill for longer time , climb up the stairs to their newer set up Cafe Coffee O Kobita , wonderfully decorated two rooms in shades of yellow and grey , the menu for both the cafe is available on both floors. From Mr burger , we tried the CHICKEN CHEESE BURGER on their recommendation , it was awesome , just at Rs 125++ the best serve one can avail, soft chicken patty with cheesy goodness sandwiched between the burger breads tantalized our taste buds till the last bite. The next , CHICKEN PLATTER comprising one breast portion in cheesy brown sauce , herbed rice , small portion of Vegetable sautee , poached egg and a potato and chicken tikki was a sumptuous meal. Very reasonablely priced and quickly served both the dishes were worth the money.

The place has few seats. So a takeaway might not be a bad idea if you live nearby. The food was immaculately packed and still burning hot by the time we opened it. 
Their chicken grilled cheese burger is awesome, chicken nuggets good.  But the fish and chips rivals that of the Mitra's Kitchen. Will definitely be back for more. The service is a little slow but the food is more than worth the wait.

Mr. Burger is located at the Shyambazar " panch matha mor "... Just beside the 2nd gate of Shyambazar metro station... Some drawbacks that I have noticed are as follows :-
No supply of drinking water
Delayed service &
Non- availability of cuisine type that we wanted... 
Anyhow I would like to suggest others to go for grilled chicken cheese burger...

Always wanted to visit this place but never got the chance... So after reading every review and seeing pictures of food here on zomato I needed to check this place out ASAP so today me and my best friends paid a visit here.
PLACE- I personally liked the decor very much. Its a small place located beside shyambazar metro station so its very easy to locate. The ambience os very good... It had a touch of the old nostalgic kolkata.. ‚ù§ Despite of being small its comfortable and the staff here is also very polite and friendly. Its a great place for hanging out with friends and also for quiet and little dates. 
FOOD- Now coming to the food we first ordered Virgin Mojito and Coke as we were very thirsty and also we were waiting for a friend. They serve the mojito in mason jas which is very cool. It tasted good.
Then we ordered Mr. Burger fried chicken and cheese burger and French fries. Fries were good and moist. Burger was fair. I expected more. The chicken in it was great but the bun was slightly burnt and the burger was kind of moist. It was fair. It also came with a side of mayonnaise carrot and lettuce which was good!
Overall it was a good experience visiting that place. Would surely recommend others to visit this!

It's a small outlet just beside the shyambazar metro station. The interiors offer a sort of a vintage feeling. Coming to the food, we ordered a special cheese chicken wrap, grilled chicken burger, chicken croquettes and chocolate milkshake with ice cream. The milkshake and wrap were in my opinion the tastiest! The burger was good enough too, with a very distinct flavour of the grilled chicken. However, the croquettes were really disappointing! 

Visited the place for the second time, and tried the mr.burger special fish and chips. I'm not too fond of fish, but i absolutely loved loved loved it üòç 
Also the fried chicken burger was delicious.

This place is located right beside the Shyam Bazar Metro Station. Went here after a shoot with a whole team of hungry and tired people who also were getting late to go home.
Since it was pretty late we decided to pack the food. The ambience was okay-ish.
I ordered a grilled chicken Burger with fried egg and cheese to go. Others ordered burgers and sandwiches too. We had to wait for a pretty long time for them to make and pack our food.
Well, coming to the food :
The burger was PRETTY big. I couldn't take a picture as I was FAMISHED by the time I reached home. The packaging was quite good too. It tasted pretty good, a little on the spicier side. They also packed some coleslaw with the burger which tasted a bit too sweet. My hunger pangs were more than satiated, though.
I would recommend you to go here for a quiet date and if you do make sure you have a lot of time on your hand.
All in all, an okay-ish experience.

A burger joint in North Kolkata was badly needed for a long time. So when it opened that too beside shyambazar metro station, it became a must visit. We tried chicken burger , pasta with mixed sauce and chicken nuggets. Burger was juicy and delicious,they customised their pasta with white sauce on our request and it was worth a try. Chicken nuggets were also freshly prepared,not the readymade ones. And most importantly, the pricing also doesn't hurt the pocket. Only minus point, we had to pay in cash (card payment is always a better option).

A latest addition near the good old roads of Shyambazar metro, Mr Burger is quite promising. For a quick Saturday evening munching I checked into the place with my mother. The place is on the smaller side, though have been furnished keeping the quirk and feel of old calcutta heritage in mind. We went for the Mr Burger special grilled chicken cheese burger, which tasted real good. The patty was both juicy and delicious. Their Fish and Chips also has a great value for money and tasted satisfactory. In beverages, they might be able to do better with the Virgin Mojito, it was on an okaish level. My mother happened to like the hot cup of cappuccino she ordered. The service was warm and efficient, the prices are very reasonable. Next time you are at the five point crossing do stop by this place.

This restaurant is situated right next to the Shyambazar metro station. Its a small place which can accommodate only around 12-13 people. We went there around 1PM and were the only customers there. The staff was friendly. Now coming to the food...we had ordered  grilled chicken cheese burger, french fries and mushroom pasta in white sauce. The quantity and quality of the food was satisfactory. They tasted fine. The only complaint I have regarding the food is that a burger without fries is not a burger. Period. 
Also the place is a little cramped and you don't really get much privacy. 
Other than this there isn't anything that is dissatisfactory about this place. Its pocket friendly and if you are in the Shyambazar area you could give it a try. :)

The burger is far better than the burgers you have in KFC or McDonalds. It's quite juicy and fresh.the bun is pretty crispy and they can work on it.fries are pretty standard and coke is served with a slice of lemon.the presentation of the food is pretty good.the ambiance is enjoyable and has peppy music playing all the time.it's a pretty small place so you can go on a date or a group of maximum 4-5 people otherwise it'll be way too crowded and uncomfortable.the manager their is very friendly and asks for review on spot.
It's a pretty good restaurant for the money you pay.

visited this place a few days back. it's a small joint, with seating arrangement barely for 15 people. the decor is nice and cozy and quite eclectic- sketches of the kolkata skyline, old and new nespaper cuttings, the works. 

we ordered a white sauce pasta and the special burger. the food! what can i say, the quantity is decent, and its delicious! the burger puffs are lightly toasted, making them crispy. the chicken was amazing, juicy and fried, crispy to the T. The pineapple pieces in between add such a variety of flavour. the pasta was delicious, creamy and savourry, and just the right amount of white sauce. 

the drinks were mind blowing. served in pretty glass mason jars, they were more flavoured water thaan thick drinks. best thing ever on a hot Calcutta afternoon, so refreshing! 

Prices are quite pocket-friendly, dtaff is cordial, and the music low and soothing. will definitely go back.

Small place near the Titan showroom at Shyambajar five point.

I would have liked this place more if they had great food. But they serve OK food in prices that are about 10-15 rs higher than what they should be.

Among the positives:
1) They play good music. Or they were playing very good music when I visited.
2) The service is good. The servers are polite.
3) The pencil sketches of little Kolkata scenes adds to the ambience.
4) A burger joint next to a college campus. That should get a few people happy.
5) Exactly next door, the space they own has been turned into a caf√©. They share the same kitchen. But countering space issues by opening a burger place and a caf√©, two different attractions, is a very neat move.

Over all, this place has a promising premise but needs to up its game when it comes to the food a bit more.

Ordered pasta in red sauce which tasted good, chicken and cheese wrap was also tasty, the veg chello platter was another surprise tasted amazing with all the different items in it.... But the star was the Grilled chicken, egg and cheese Burger perfect blend of all chicken n cheese was moist if u like a lot of cheese u will surely love it.... Tried different drinks but Virgin mojito was the best... The people were really nice.... Hopefully they will have a few more options but for now with the pricing and everything... Definitely worth it...

Mr. Burger is a small caf√© near Shyambazar metro station. I tried out the vegetarian paneer and cheese burger which was okay. I actually liked the cold coffee with icecream more. It was neither too sweet nor very bitter..Just perfect for my palate. Since I'm a vegetarian, I can't say anything about the non- vegetarian items on the menu, but my friends enjoyed their special chicken burgers, so I suppose it was good. The prices are reasonable, even though the service is a little slow. The staff was friendly. :) I loved this particular wall art ( see the photograph ). We had a great time. :)

So my friend and i visited this eatery beside Shyambazar metro. The place is too small but they surely know how to create a beautiful ambience. The wallpaper looks like newspaper cuttings and there are dozens of framed pictures of vintage Kolkata, famous personalities buildings. Oh and Bob Dylan sang "blowing in the wind" in the background ! The owner has a great music taste i must say. We ordered fried chicken cheese burger and cold coffee with icecream. The burger was served along with a ketchup sachet and a small bowl of salad made of mayonnaise cucumber and carrot. The burger was really yummy. There were layers of fried chicken lettuce leaf tomato cucumber and cheese and boy ! it did tickle our tastebuds ! The cold coffee soothed our soul. Literally. It tasted heavenly. The best thing abour this place is that it is not at all overpriced. They serve  good tasty food without cutting a hole in your pocket. I am definitely going back there again. I deducted half a mark because they can improve the quality of the burger bun. Apart from that, no complaints !

This small food joint is a newly opened one and is a hidden jem. This is situated next to Shyambazar Metro Station 2 no. Gate. This is a very small place with very little seating arrangement. The decoration is done with old news paper cut outs which is very attractive and they play old English songs which makes up your mood. I tried out there Mr. Burger special Chicken Burger, Red Sauce Chicken Pasta,.White Sauce Chicken Pasta. Everything was great. The burger comes with one layer of grilled chicken,one layer of fried chicken and one layer of pineapple. Even being a hater of pineapple as oer the suggestion of the staff I loved the layer,it goes really well with the flavours. Pasta contains ample amount of chicken pieces and it's cream. I liked the place and would suggest you to visit it once.

I tried their creamy white sauce pasta and mr. burger special burger.
I was more impressed by the burger than the pasta. I found the pasta quantity is quite less in accordance to the price but the burger won my heart.
The burger had two grilled chicken patties with a piece of pineapple and veggies inside it and the burger buns were soft. It was served with a mayo dip which was delicious.
Overall the place is nice with a homely touch and service is steady.
Can't wait to try out their rest of the menu.

This cafe is located just beside shyambajar metro! Truly a hidden gems in Kolkata. ordered Grilled chicken chelow platter and one Cold coffee with ice cream. Food was awesome and as well as the beverage! Will love to visit this place again.
This cafe is very small with only 12 seating capacity which is a big negative point, ambience is good but it can be better! Waiters behaviour were well and the serving time was perfecto!
A must try!

A nice place to give your small treats in the shyambazar area. The food quantity is good..and the ambience being too small can be rated as moderate. And of course at affordable price you can enjoy yourself and satisfy your friends as well ..

Mr Burger is located just next to Shyambazar Metro gate No. 2. The place is decorated well, and the ambiance is good too. Went for a Chicken Egg Burger. The burger was tasty. BUT. Why would anyone ruin a perfectly good burger by including an omelette in it? I was expecting it to be done in a different way. And more importantly I WANT FRIES WITH MY BURGER :(

Mr.Burger is a special Burger Pasta and other snacks junction just beside the Shyambazar Metro. Food is awsome here. I tried their Pasta in white cream sauce and their Chicken burger. Both of them were excellent in taste. Specially the Burger was very good. Big chicken peice with good quality Buns.
Ambiance is beautiful. And prices are very reasonable.

Mr.Burger is located just beside Shyambazar Metro. I visited here yesterday to try out their dishes. The place is small with four table. Interior is full with photo frames having snaps of news paper from old time.
We ordered for a Mr.Grilled Chicken Cheese Burger for Rs.110. They took about 10mins to serve. The burger came and we tasted, it was excellent. The bun was good. Inside Chicken piece was big and soft. And the overall taste was awesome. They provided a Mayo dip with it.
Then we ordered Chicken Pasta in White Creamy sauce. A bowl of Pasta with lot of white cream and white sauce with it. Taste was brilliant. The only disappointing thing was the chicken pieces. Chicken pieces were hard. I hope they will take care of it from next time.
Overall service was good.
Prices are very reasonable.

A gem in the heart of Shyambazar. I had went in hoping this to be an average place but I am pleasantly surprised to experience this place. The burgers here can give McDonalds a run for their money, and I personally loved the Burger here over McDonalds. Being a Saturday , I had to have Veg and we tried out the Paneer Grilled Burger and The Paneer Wrap. 

The Burger was juicy, generous in quantity and size and was perfectly done, I am yet to have a better burger. The Paneer used was a Paneer Steak , which is a surprise as I had expected them to maybe make a patty and serve. The bun was crisp and fresh , the ice berg lettuce still retained it's crunch and the dressing was a delight.  They also served a neat coleslaw with the Burger which was actually refreshing. I loved the Burger. 

Coming to the wrap, it was more like a roll, but tasty nevertheless.The filling was generous and tasty. Full marks for food.

The decor and the ambience too are really nice . Can't wait to be back here.

This is a hidden gem at the corner of Shyambazar 5 point crossing, towards Central Avenue a few feet away from the Titan watches showroom. We visited on a Sunday evening and sadly most of the seats were empty. We had fried chicken burger, paneer burger and tea. They present the food in a lovely and unique way and it would be unfair if I didn't mention how good the music was. They played old classics- Oasis, beatles, madonna and even tracks from Sound of music that totally reminded me of my Bangalore days.

Food- 5/5
Ambience - 5/5
Staff behaviour- 5/5
Price- 4/5

I'm certainly going back soon. 
P.S.- there's another coffee shop right next to it called cafe coffee n kobita that happens to be it's sister cafe. I plan on visiting that too.

This will be a bit biased, because situated close to my college. Cramped up place with very helpful and courteous staffs. The d√©cor is nice even though the place is small. The burgers,pasta are great. Coffee were a bit turn down. But the cost and the quality doesn't provide scope for much complaints. Will definitely recommend the place. Grilled chicken burger is a must try.

Ambience is standard, an old studio converted to an eatery, with a few poetry books throw in. Ordered cold coffee with ice cream which was a slight disapointment due to addition of strawberry ice cream and watery coffee. Blue curacao was good with mint and served in mason jar. Fish chips was slightly overpriced at the quantity given, a few french fries thrown in and stalish fry. 
The burger was good but oily with a chunk of fried chicken and egg combined.
The biggest downer was the billing persons attitude. No bill was given at first. Directly amount was asked to b drawn on credit card. Only after asking amount was told and bill given after payment.
Food quality and quantity can be improved greatly as per price

After attending a event on M.M.C. we are feeling really hungry so visited here to try something quick from here. Small outlet with 6 - 7 tables to sit. Designed and decorated very beautifully. Ambience was really good and so as hospitality. service in reasonable time and presentation was really impressive. ¬†I tried there veg Pasta in White Sauce it was damn cheesy & Creamy. Finger leacking heavenly delicious in taste. Penne Pasta cooked in Cheesy and creamy white sauce with mushrooms, capsicum, etc tastes amazing. My friend tried there Grilled Fish Cheelo meal and it was decent according to him. must try place. recommended.

A good food joint in shayambazar area. There is always a demand for a coffeeshop in shayambazar locality and mr. Burger fulfill that demand. It s a good place for adda.
Now come to ambience. Its quite good and the its suits the nostalgia of north. Wallpaper and decoration is classy.
Food quality is average. The bun of burger is not toasted and the cheese is not melted only the chicken is hot. But cafe is quit expensive.
In my opinion it is one time adventure.
At the end we are still in search of a proper pocket friendly cafeteria in shayambazar locality.

Shyambazar is a place I enjoy frequenting. But very recently I noticed this outlet. Normally I don't like burgers - too filling. But today I decided to try it for a change.

As I approached the place, a small signboard caught my eye - Coffee O Kobita. You all who read my reviews know how I love cafe. So I chose this one instead. It is a very tiny little place but tastefully decorated. Bright pink chairs and stools adorn the place. Kolkata skyline is etched on the wall. On entering, I realised that it is an unit of Mr Burger and that same food is available in both of them. As I sat down, Kazi Sabyasachi's baritone voice reciting the famous poem of Kazi Nazrul Islam -"Balo Bir, Balo unnato mamo shir...." was being played. There are wooden shelves full of books of poems by famous poets. I took down one by Tasleema Nasreen.

For the food. There are two menu cards - one presumably for Mr Burger and the other for the cafe. I chose grilled chicken cheese burger to be parcelled. I took one black coffee while it was being prepared. The coffee tasted wonderful and for a change they gave sachets of brown sugar instead of white one. As I drank on, a staff handed me a khata asking me to write something there. Someone before me had written a beautiful poem. I have no such talent, so I wrote my feelings on coming here.

The food came, beautifully and hygienically parcelled in plastic bowls packed in a cloth bag, together with salads and sauces. I was highly  impressed. The only thing they forgot was packing tissue papers - (sigh!) - this being the usual point of amnesia with almost every cafe and restaurant I know.

The food was huge - but that is natural, it being a burger. But it tasted great. A bit on the spicy side, but tasty.

The staff are friendly and alert. The parking space I don't think is available on weekdays, but we were lucky as it was Sunday.

Overall, a fantastic experience.

This place might be small (the only negative), but everything else, from the ambiance to the food, the pricing to the service is spot on. It is divided into two sections. The outer one, Mr. Burger, serves the food mainly and the inner one, Coffee O Kobita, drinks and desserts. Though, as the kitchen is common, you can order from both the menus sitting in either of the two. 

Unlike small cafes the seating here is really comfortable. Proper chairs and not lots of stools and things like that. Tastefully done decor with Jim Reeves in the background at Mr. Burger and Soumitra Chatterjee's poem recitals at Coffee O Kobita. And thanks for maintaining the perfect volume (most places these days play music very loudly). 

Coming to the main thing, food, we ordered a Grilled Chicken-Fried Egg-Cheese Burger, one Grilled Fish Chello Meal and a Veg Paneer-Cheese-Mushroom Wrap. 

The Wrap was good and filling. The Burger was great with a juicy patty and the Chello meal was excellent. The fish fillet was thick and juicy and the lemon butter sauce was good. The crumb fried mashed potato with corns was great and so were the veggies. Loved the fact that they were sauteed in butter and not plain boiled. 

Among drinks the Blue Curacao was well made refreshing. The Coffee was also good (both the Cappuccino and Mocha). 

Loved the cheesecake here but unfortunately it is not available most of the times. 

This is must visit place if you are around and a great place for hangout if the group is not big.

This is new Burger joint at Shyambazar. ¬†I tried chicken grilled burger and chicken nuggets. The taste was amazingly good. ¬†The patty was very soft. I must say I have never had such tasty nuggets. Moreover the ambiance is quite unique. Nostalgic look and feeling. The staffs are very friendly.

Its a  small joint located a few metres away from the shyambazar metro station. Good place for time pass with friends. We ordered a chicken grilled sandwich,  cream filled chicken nuggets and chicken burger. Good to taste. Prices are decent according to recent standards. Not being a great lover of burgers and sandwiches I found this place  as good but not anything extraordinary. But at the same time also felt that this place holds great promises in the future.

If u want to have evening snacks by literally making waste of your time and money, you may try Mr Burger.
Foodwise it might get a '4'; ambience might fetch it a '3', but in case of customer satisfaction it deserves a '-5'. Mr Burger assures that by the time the food will arrive at your table, you will lose your appetite. A burger will take 40 mins approx and chicken pasta will take 50 mins only.........come on!!!!! By this time I can go home and cook myself.
In our case, we lost our appetite and had to parcel the food. After being disappointed by not being able to dine in, finally there was some good news. The food was not bad either.
So the bottom line is- you may try this place only if u have a lot of time.
The pinch on the pocket is on the higher side.

In case you are looking for a place to mingle with your nostalgia for old Calcutta sipping a happy mug of mojito and eating a yummy burger, this is your place!
The chelo meal is also great! Varieties of coffee can be tried with different cookies. Chicken burgers of mouth watering sizes, Sandwiches as well as poetry books are also available in their next door sister joint coffee o Kobita!

And to top it, the staff is great! And yes, the designer of the cafe is a humble honourable woman. She is sometimes there to welcome you with her humble attitude and courteous behaviour . A cafe North Kolkata has been long waiting for.
See you then guys! North finally says yes to cafe mania!!!

A newly opened small cafe near shyambazar 5point crossing. We visited this place on panchami night during pandal hopping. We were hungry and thirsty as well. This small cafe gave our poor souls some solace.
We had ordered chicken and paneer wrap, blue lagoon and a cheesecake. The blue lagoon was beautifully made and served in a mason jar. It was very refreshing. The wrap had huge amount of chicken and paneer in it and it was of such a size which is perfect for two. The cheesecake was a tiny one but tasted beautiful.
The decoration was beautiful as well and the caf√© is well lit. The staffs are really cordial.
A very nice experience.

A cute little place by Shyambazar metro. The walls had paper cutouts of various moments and potraits of netaji giving it a very north calcutta look. The manager and staff were very polite and friendly and order time was quite great. Coming to the food you must try out their fish and chips. The wrap I thought was also very good. They also have an exquisite collection of burgers sandwiches and chelo meals.
The pricing is very very reasonable and I highly recommend everyone to give this place a try!
