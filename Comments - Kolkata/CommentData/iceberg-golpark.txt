This is a small takeaway joint located just opposite to Golpark petrol pump beside the Peter England shop. Today after tution, I went there with much expectation after reading the reviews here on Zomato & ordered one of their specialities "Chicken Chatpata roll" for only 43/- bucks. The roll was delicious with huge chunks of chicken & a not-too-oily paratha covering it. Service is quite fast and the staff behaviour was more or less okay. Only a minor complaint :- the roll was too much spicy even after mentioning that during the time of ordering.

Went there many times after shopping, a roadside shop. Ordered egg chowmein, egg roll, chicken biriyani,chicken momo on different occasions. Taste is average, hygiene definitely not guaranteed. The uncle is really polite and friendly. Price is pocket-friendly, I think that is all the rush about since it is near south city college as well as of Gariahat. 
Overall, a fair experience in reasonable price...

Located just near the golpark petrol pump...this eatery is very small and no seating arrangements inside..you have to sit on wooden benches on the road.They have a variety of combo dishes..but I have heard a lot about their biriyani.And suddenly he decided to give me a treat here.So two plates of chicken biriyani it was!Served with sliced onions.The biriyani tasted decent enough.Would have given it a 4.5 but the aloo in my biriyani had some kind of insect made cavity in it .But since the biriyani tasted good.That can be overlooked.Service was prompt.Cannot comment on the hygiene though!
HappyEating!

A great budget outlet in the heart of Golpark. This pretty old out serves fast food in Chinese and Indian. They have some real cool combos to try from. The veg fried rice and chili chicken combo is the fastest selling combo.

After completing my part 3 external, I happened to drop in over here with my college mates to satisfy our hunger. Right near golpark crossing, this place offers an outdoor seating. Be it chicken rolls or eggroll both are equally good and lip smacking. However i feel utterly dissapointed at the biriyani they serve. The chicken seemed a day old. Infact it wasnt fresh. However my other friends felt ok regarding their chicken pieces. Overall, try rolls. Dont settle for biriyani. I strongly trust my taste buds and do believe that i tasted right.

I ordered through home delivery so I am going to talk about the food only.  I ordered a non-veg combo, one fish fry and a chicken pakora. 
The combo was nice, the chowmein was a little bland but the chilli chicken was flavourful. 
The fish fry was really nice and the chicken pakora was of decent size with a lot of flavour. 
A very good place for ordering in. The food is quite decent and flavourful in such a low price.

Everyday while passing golpark, I see this place. Never thought of ordering or eating at this place because honestly it doesn't look very spacious or hygienic from outside n I didn't even expect to find it in zomato but thankfully I did. One of my friends staying in park circus suggested that they've good combo meals..so we ordered from our college (thanks to swiggy for lightening fast delivery in <20 minutes). We ordered 2 veg fried rice and chili chicken combo, chicken biryani (half) n veg chow chili chicken combo. All combos were 60 bucks each...so very easy on our pockets. The food tasted good. Quantity was enough for 6 of us. What amazed me the most was that they give one full egg in that 60 bucks biriyani alongwith one big chicken piece n potato. For an egg lover like me who doesn't find egg in màny leading biriyani shop's biriyani...this is quite a surprise!!!
Thanks to team iceberg.!!! Hope to order again soon:)

This place is an example of real struggle and fight back. I've been visiting this place for the past 3-4 years and have witnessed how after a great mishap they still stood up to serve the people with quality food. Starting from a roll to combo dishes to biriyani, everything is great. No doubt in terms of quality or quantity. Pocket friendly charges and great servicing.

😃😋😙😘I'm Rating This Place Iceberg, Golpark 5.0 Because I Have Visited Them Atleast More Than 30 Times In A Calender Year. From 2016 - 2017. And On 21st August 2017 After Watching The Biggest Party Of The Summer WWE SUMMERSLAM On TEN 1 HD & TEN 1 4:30am Live From Brooklyn, NY & Repeat 6:00pm. And After My School Was Over At 3:30pm I Came To Iceberg, Golpark To Have My Dinner. I Ordered 1 Lunch Pack Combo Veg Noodles With Chilly Chicken For Rs. 60/- And Chicken Pan Fried Momo For Rs. 70/- Within Rs. 130/- I Was Full And Satisfied With Their Food And Service. The Scenario Was Awesome And The Atmosphere Was Great. Today I Targeted This Restaurant Iceberg, Golpark For My Double Century 200* Review On Zomato. This Restaurant Was In My Hitlist For A Very Very Long Time. I Didn't Had The Time To Review This Place Iceberg For A Long Time. But Today I Had The Time To Review This Place Iceberg. So Thank you Iceberg For Making My Day Very Very Memorable.👍👌✌👏

Iceberg has been around for a substantial amount of time, located in one of the busiest areas of South Kolkata - Golpark. This place is famous for their rolls, momos, fries, snack items and a variety of combos. Again the prices at which they offer the various stuff is pretty cheap too.... so a very attractive place for the younger generation especially the college goers. Overall the quality of food is reasonably good, especially the rolls and the momos are some of the items to savour. They have definite scope for improvement on all aspects e. g. a little less oil in their food stuff will definitely make things better and relatively healthier too. Good for a quick bite or a take away.

Whenever I pass through golpark, I always find a certain crowd of people near this food stall, either munching a roll or a plate of biryani. So, without thinking much, I brought home a packet of biryani. Though a little oily, I liked it. At that cheap price and maintaining the hygiene, I can't expect anything better than this. The rice grain used was fine. Also, the potato and chicken were boiled. If possible, will taste the Chinese or the rolls next time !

The kebabs everything is yummy .the bonus is the cold drink shop situated beside. You can eat your heart out and then grab a coke as well. Just that since its an open air seating arrangement do look out for the birds sitting above. 😁

I had ordered the food online so i cannot really write much. This is the very first time i tried this outlet. Very pocket friendly and tummy filling. I had just ordered Chicken Chow Full and to my surprise, this chicken chow actually had a lot of chicken chunks but it lacked taste. A very simply fried noodles with veggies but more of chicken 😀 and the price is  satisfyingly affordable.

The rating is because i feel it can do a lot better than that.

Located right at the mouth of the golpark circle, ice berg is a small eatery which serves chinese food and rolls and a really affordable rate. You can always try their combos. You can either opt for take away or tak e your time and sit down to relish some good food in midst of deafening traffic, while a small cats waits for patiently under your bench waiting for you to share your meal. Enjoy...

Iceberg is a food joint located at Golpark, there is nothing  to say regarding their deco.. I ordered online Chicken Rolls and Egg Tikia Roll. The chicken rolls were really good, the chicken inside was flavorful and soft. But least can be said about the egg tikia roll. The tikia inside was disgusting, don't know whether it was chicken or mutton or something else.. So, never go for that tikia roll...

This eatery is located close to the golpark petrol pump , and opposite Gangurams . The place looks like a take away counter , but has makeshift seating in the form of 3-4 benches outside the shop where you can sit and have the food . The rolls here taste average . The pan fried chicken Momo I tried had a soupy base , the sauce being more runny than in other Momo outlets , and had a lot of chillies in it ! The momos tasted slightly undercooked . However , the most popular item on the menu here seems to be the parantha combo , which is a filling meal that is also inexpensive! The prices here are pocket friendly , so if you're broke and need a quick bite in this area , you may consider iceberg for the variety in menu it offers.

Though i did not drop in there shop ever.. i have ordered online.. the momos especially the soup is amazing.. their combos being their forte.. be it the chicken and noodles combo or the chicken and rice combo at such a cheap price it absolutely kills it ! 
The combos come for as cheap as 50 bucks and momos too
Quantity not being an issue the chicken could be softer 
Though in a nutshell.. when you are really short of funds.. or craving for some snack.. this will fetch your purpose !

By shortlisting from a ton of cheap restaurants, we selected this place for catering meals for our freshers' greeting ceremony!
As it was kind of a low budget affair we opted for this place.
We ordered Manchurian chicken and Mixed fried rice.
Manchurian chicken was nice...soft, cooked!
But fried rice was salty ... So kind of unsatisfied  from this kind of experience.
Other than that portions are real nice.
Neat and clean place.

Went there with a friend there during the pujas....seating place is okay....the price is very reasonable keeping the taste & amount in mind....just located near the Golpark Petrol Pump....have been a fan of this place since my school days...

Have tasted the egg roll & chicken roll both a good with a pocket friendly price...

But i am a big fan of their Chilly chicken & dry chilly...i wasn't able to finish the amount of chicken give....:P & with the parathas it tastes even better...no words...:D :)

  Dry chilly-4/5....Chilly chicken-4/5...parathas-3.7/5...;)

Will visit again & try something new from the menu...

Iceberg is located at Golpark more. I have been here quita few times. This is located very near to the Nava Nalanda Higher Secondary building. It is basically a street food joint.I have had their rolls, biryanis etc. Their chicken eol is good and well prepared. I love their biryani. It is delicious. The cons of this eatery are lack of sheltered eating place and hygiene. It really becomes very hard to eat when you have to hold your umbrella as well duriua torrential downpour. Crows come and seat besude you while you are having food. Disgusting. I hope they improve this dire condition soon.

Cannot comment on the ambience. I ordered their food through Swiggy.
Food was surprisingly good.
Surprising because the food here costs quite less. So frankly I expected nothing good.
Thank goodness I was proved wrong :)

We ordered half a plate of veg noodles and half a plate of veg fried rice.
Now let me tell you something; these might cost 35 & 40 bucks but they are for more than one person.

The quantity is immensely good.

We ordered Hot Garlic Chicken. The 8 pieces were big in size. The gravy tasted really good.

The next time (also through Swiggy) I ordered the Veg Chow and Chilli Chicken combo. Two good sized chicken pieces . That too for just 50bucks!!!

I didnt like their Paratha and Chicken combo. The chicken wasn't cooked properly. The parathas; though, were nicely made!!

All in all; Thumbs up :D

Iceberg had been our college time regular food joint. It was my favorite place to try out rolls then. On my recent Kolkata visit though about giving this place a try, once again.
It is a street food joint located at Golpark area, with 4 benches placed on the pavement for people who want a eat and chat a bit. You can locate it easily as its one of the many street food joints dotted around the Golpark circle.
Coming to the food, they serve momo, roll varieties, parathas, lunch parcels, biriyani, etc. Their fried foods are on the oily side, a heads-up to the health conscientious. Momos are one my personal favorite there, and it comes along with a complimentary egg-drop type of soup (with the non-veg momo). Rolls are still tasty, and the taste didn't seem to have changed in these many years. Never tried their biriyanis, but people having it seem to be relishing it and the aroma was inviting too!
All in all a very good street food joint to be tried out when in the Gariahat area. Plus its pocket-friendly too.

It is a small food joint at Golpark. We noticed this outlet while shopping and had our lunch there today. Chilly chicken was a little bit spicy but tasty. The fried rice was okay. Basically it is a street food corner where you have to sit beside the road and have your food. Price rate was cheap. Quantity was enough. Service was a bit slow. Overall nice experience.

Moreover, its less oily,less spicy but tastes too yumm! One of my favorite.Many other combos are there as well.Even the prices of all the items are very much affordable!

Nothing cool about Iceberg, in fact the place is hot as hell. Multiple stoves operating at same time makes the place so hot that even a passerby would start sweating. This place is basically a cheap eat restaurant located a few steps from Golpark Petrol Pump. Can't even call this place a proper restaurant because it doesn't have proper seating nor home delivery. In terms of seating, there are some old school wooden benches haphazardly  laid on the pavement. I guess the best option is to opt for takeaway. It seems that the place is quite old but hardly saw any renovation in recent times.

Talking of the food, there are various items to choose from. Best would be to try their rolls first before going for main dishes. I tried the same by ordering a Chicken Kebab Roll and a Chicken Tikka Roll. Firstly I would say it's too oily. Secondly, nothing special. In fact I couldn't tell which one is what after having both the rolls.

Ordering system is a mayhem as there are too many people standing outside the place. If you place order, it will certainly take good 20-30 minutes. Pricing is really cheap as it's meant to be.

End note, there are many better alternatives if you look for.

This place is a bit shady and they have no indoor seating. Getting on to food the biryani is excellent and maybe the best around that area. The rolls are also pretty descent. But I go their every time only for their biryani. Their chilli chicken is also really good, but don't expect the Chinese one. Still they are very very tasty and go well with biryani. That's what I think.

Best rolls in town someone said... overrated, I say. Just another fast food center with its usual fare. One thing that used to pull me to this place a few years back was the chicken chatpata roll. There was a certain zing and zest to it. But I found it all missing when I went there a couple of days earlier. It's just another fast food joint for me now.. not worth a notable mention.

For the hungry people walking around Golpark or someone who has a craving for rolls, this is the place to hit. A small shop located at Golpark, Iceberg has been there for ages. When I was in school and didn't have much cash to hit a restaurant, I use to go to Ice berg for Rolls. The place has still lived up to its expectations when it comes to rolls. Went there last week and was treated to a great Egg Chicken Roll. I also tried the Fish Fry and Chicken Pakora. The Fish Fry was nice too and not much of coating and less of fish as we get elsewhere. Chicken Pakora was a disappointment though. Very little chicken was there. The other fries they have are usually fried before hand so I suggest you don't go for them if you are into hygiene. They also have a large selling menu of noodles rice and chilly chicken which is a favourite among multiple people there. Definitely a place to try rolls if you are a Roll fan. To me its the best place to have rolls around Golpark. I give it 3.5/5

This is one of the best Chinese food stall in golpark, very old and very testy. For me the best item mixed chowmin. You should try it atleast once.

located just beside peter england showroom in golpark this joint provides some good food at reasonable price..it has benches in the footpath and you have to eat ur food sitting in the benches there which should be considered by them.food wuality is ok and prices are at par with the quantity and quality barring few.during an evening walk or shopping or with a very tight budget,  this place can really be considered to fill ur stomach without hurting your pocket.

During my graduation days, I and my best friend used to have snacks from here on our way to tution in Ballygunge phari. We used to gorge on the fish fry, mutton tikia rolls, chowmein, fried rice-chili chicken combo and momos. everything was really tasty for the price we used to pay. it was so so reasonable.

Its located just a bit away from gariahat bus stop. 
Talking about the food, I ordered the chicken chowmein and egg chicken chowmein. The quantity of the food was good and the price was satisfactorary. But i guess they have a salty tooth so they make most of their food salty. But there rolls are very nice and one should definitly try it. The seats are dirty with possibility of extra sauces descending from above (crow poo).  And, if you are a germaphobe, then you better stay away from this place because they don't prepare there food clean enough.
So try ur luck ;)

a street side food joint which is quite popular among college goers and office workers; be it day or the evening, you will always see the benches atleast half full. love their chicken chatpata roll, momos are great, chciken pakoda is not that great though. even the chowmein is good though very much oily, but then at such a cheap rate dont expect so much! :)

Running low like really life on cash , try out the parantha with aloo Dum, its the best preparation of the kind at such a cheap price. The biriyani is commé-çi comme-ça. Chinese needs improvement. Mughlai is above expectation . The veg roll is good too.

This is a kind of roadside food joint but serves quality food. I have tasted their mixed fried rice and chilli chicken and they were literally awesome! And the quantity is enough to serve two hungry individuals. And the price is cheap enough. Nothing to boast about about its ambience as it is a take away food joint with just a few seats arranged outside the joint.

Excellent food. Well don't get me wrong people. I know those first two words are contradictory with the rating I gave. However I find a restaurant is not just about food, my ratings also depend on interior deco, ambience, service and all that. Zomato has only 1 scale on which you are expected to rate places like mainland china and "mashi'r dokan" alike. So that's that. Now coming on to Iceberg. I believe this place is sponsored by "Kala Hit", the mosquito/fly repellant. Because a can of those is indispensable if you really dont wanna be ravaged by those bugs. Iceberg is like an improved roadside fast food cafe, with a few benches on the footpath as it's only seating arrangement. Since the joint is near Golpark, I won't even bother going into details of the ambience cause I'm sure all Calcuttans are well acquainted with blaring car horns and driver-slang at traffic signals...and rabindrasangit! Never forget Rabindrasangit at signals! Anyway. So also watch out for dogs/cats (kitten in my case) pestering you. Oh and did I mention there are these beggar children who sit beside you imploring you to buy them pakoras? Yeah I understand it's no reason to give the restaurant a negative feedback, but then again, they could improve sitting arrangements. Now coming to the good points. Service is prompt. And again, food is just excellent. It's well cooked, VERY tasty and you wont need antacids afterwards. That goes for all the dishes served here, and I'v tried almost all of them. And it's cheap. Win win! Now since food is so good I can't recommend just one dish to try here, however I would recommend to take a friend/family member when going to this place. Someone to chat with. Trust me, that would make the experience 5 stars for this place. Or you could just order take-out :)

ICEBERG....is an amazing food joint with great location. It's light on the pocket yet no compromise with the food you get for that price.The chicken rolls, egg rolls, chilly chicken, chicken saslik rolls, chicken momos(steamed/fried) are just lipsmacking..awesome and irresistible. It is definitely a value for money joint.The best part is all your food is made fresh and as per your order to suit your taste buds (extra spicy,mild,deep fried etc.)Mr.Rajesh the owner is a very friendly and well know personality in the area, who ensures you return satisfied.
It's a must visit joint if you are in and around Gariahat Golpark...

Famous for the fast foods & Chinese for quiet a long time, frankly speaking it has run all  the way through without proper competitor. The considerable crowd still found is due to the visibility or the location & of-course the cheap price offered. Coming up to the taste & quality it lacks far behind the up -coming Food pavilion available just beside. Another ridiculous thing is the food plates lying all around the filthy pavements under the bench & plastic chairs provided to the customers to sit, to which the authority is shockingly casual. None of the food items worth mentioning, more over it is aTOTAL WASTE OF MONEY... Trust me !!!.. One can try Alibaba instead which is right beside, offering almost the same price list. In no way this "Ice Berg" would come in consideration other than a mere road -side joint.

Usually non-veg rolls are a risky business as one never knows what part or type of non veg one is being served. This is one of those place I have found to be quite good and more importantly, safe. Not tasted anything outside of their rolls and they are quite good. Beware, they are large and heavy!

I have been coming here from my very child hood and I am fond of their food. The owner is a wonderful person. Among all the things tried here the lunch pack is my favorite . It tastes wonderful and the  price is cheap! Whenever you pass ICEBERG you will definitely find huge crowd waiting that would definitely give you the feeling "this must be a good joint!! "

Situated at just the crossing of the busy Golpark junction, Iceberg is a serious business in rolls. I have been visiting this take-away joint since my school days, and they are an expert in all types of rolls. You must give a try for the shashlik roll. Though they have come up with Chinese dishes and Mughlai ones, but they are average ones.

Iceberg is not chilly at all :D

**Location = Golpark. Beside the Petrol Pump :)

**Brief = Had been tasting their rolls since my childhood as my maternal uncle's house is very nearby.

**Ambience = A small roadside roll outlet which has huge crowd during the evening. Serving hott rolls and chows to the hungry customers :D The man is a friendly guy and serves fast, taking all due considerations of your roll to be made accoridng to your choice.

**Food =
The Chicken Chatpata Roll is the best, its served quickly, hott and has adequate chicken to satisfy :P The egg chicken roll and chicken special rolls are also havoc to taste :D
The Half Fried rice and chilly chicken is a reasonable deal to have when you are sort on budget ;) The chow is also a best seller here :D

They serve fountain pepsis as well. Very much needed to satisfy your thirst after having the spicy rolls :)


**Purse CHeck = Very much Purse Friendly :)

**Overall = A great place to taste some quick rolls with friendly rates :)

Yes,it's a typical roadside stall where you get rolls n street food but you can identify the same if you stand at the Golpark more beside the petrol pump station,and amongst the many roadside stalls you can see the maximum crowd sitting there in benches. The noodles are amazing,  I've had there many times and still don't get enough of it. The chicken pakoras are passable though.

So its a typical Road Side Stand for Rolls and others.... now they have extended the menu to serve more items and chinese and indian and kebabs and all... but for me this is still a roll joint all in all cause the rolls here are pretty good...

i like place like Anamika and Iceberg cause they are not stingy while making the roll... if you have any specifications they follow it to the letter. also the guy standing in front is a cool dude with a pic with amitabh bachan and all in the front of shop... kind of interesting to see all this... 

all in all good rolls and cheap prices and decent service and timing. Location is great too as it is is right on Gol Park.

The food is cheap but tasty.
The BIriyani there is real good for a road side joint. They actually sell a lot of stuff there. The Fish Fry tastes nice as
Umm... Those were the only of their dishes I have tasted actually, there's definitely more in the list.Do stop by whenever you walk from Golpark or Gariahat, or if you were checking the books in the roadside stalls.

i like place like Anamika and Iceberg cause they are not stingy while making the roll... if you have any specifications they follow it to the letter. also the guy standing in front is a cool dude with a pic with amitabh bachan and all in the front of shop... kind of interesting to see all this... 

all in all good rolls and cheap prices and decent service and timing. Location is great too as it is is right on Gol Park.

A good road side food joint.
The food is cheap but tasty.
The BIriyani there is real good for a road side joint. They actually sell a lot of stuff there. The Fish Fry tastes nice as
Umm... Those were the only of their dishes I have tasted actually, there's definitely more in the list.Do stop by whenever you walk from Golpark or Gariahat, or if you were checking the books in the roadside stalls.

The food is good and most importantly, it is affordable. It is more like a street-food stall with wooden benches. So, if the money in your pocket is limited on a particular day, then this is the perfect place to be.

Good food. Cheap too. Ideal for treating old friends to the delicacies of the British Raj. Perfect for reminiscing.
