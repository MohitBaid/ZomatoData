This place has a childhood nostalgia attached for me. I have been eating the fish fry, fish fingers, kababs, chicken cutlets since I was a kid and its taste hasn't changed. Their mustard sauce "kasundi" is one of the best in town.

I went to Campari to have their famous rolls but unfortunately they were out of all the rolls option. So me, my mom and aunt had to settle for fish fry and fish fingers. Both of them was stuffed with hefty amount of fish fillet. It was meaty and chunky but the sad part was the fish had a very funny taste, more on the stale side. This may be cause the fish was stale or was sitting for a quite a long or the batch of fish fry. I was served was not up-to the mark as I expected the quality of the fish to be good in a fish fry. Also is it me or anybody else felt little heavy after eating a piece of a fish fry and then little weird in the stomach. This is completely my first experience of having the fish fry at Campari so I am being little skeptical in giving a good rate.

Yep....there is even some items for the vegetarians like me in this typical roll and fish fry place. My friends had the fish fry and rolls and liked it. They even have a special fish fry but that is priced higher.The paneer roll is good. I also had the Aam Panna sherbet and it was cool and satisfying.It is the place to go to for those wanting fries and rolls.

That fishfry was not special campari. Sorry. And the mutton cutlet was so stiff. The outer coating came out separately while the mutton inside was too little and stiff like rubber. You need not price that aam panna at 20rs for that little cup you provide. Really disappointed. Even that small fishfry stall beside JD park in Hajra is way better.

This place is an almost more than 15 years old since i can recollect & ordering food from here fills me with nostalgia. Dad & me always order their special fish fry which has a thick amount of pure bhetki fish with very tasty 😋 coating of of fresh masalas. The value for one dish is absolutely worth it. Their normal fish fry, mutton cutlet, chicken cutlet & fish rolls are equally tasty & fresh. This shop never has left overs. Must try for all Bangalis....

This rather small outlet is situated near Gariahat crossing close to the Singhi Park durgapujo. I've been going here for quite a long time, since my early school days. Chicken cutlet is their signature item and you have to taste it to believe. Other than that there are chicken, fish, mutton and paneer rolls. You get kebab served with paratha. I've tried their rolls and cutlet and till today a evening visit in gariahat area usually ends up with having a bite at this place. The ordering process is simple where you go upto the counter and place it and this man at the counter has been here I guess from the beginning of this outlet. On weekends and weekdays, there is good amount of crowd so you might need sometime to get your order but the delivery is quite fast.

My colleague had recommended the chicken roll, so I decided to try it out one evening. It was different in that instead of the mere 3-4 small pieces of chicken, either grilled or cooked in a curry, that is usually put inside the roll in most other snack-bars in Kolkata, the Campari roll contained chunkier pieces of chicken. Their taste was, however, a tad mild as per my palate....though some are quite fond of the Campari roll owing to this ‘healthy’ trait :P

Campari also has a catering business; I suppose this piece of info is not too well-known. It was the caterer of the same colleague’s daughter’s birthday party last year. The lunch spread was decent, and I particularly liked the chicken dish.

Had a visit during durga puja pandel hopping. They Offered kolkata fried delicacies in affordable prices. Had a chicken cutlet. Huge in size. The Pineapple slush tastes nothing but colored sweetened water, no flavour to it. I would not say that i was total happy with the food experience but considering the durga puja rush they had to make things in advance to comply. The service was prompt. Will visit again surely and would stick with the fried items only.

You have to try with Chicken Roll and Mutton Roll. The best part is the bread . It's not hard fried like other places , rather the bread is soft and with less oil . The meat is cooked and the taste of it is awesome as the gravy is cooked very tasty . 
The outlet is famous for the cutlet and fish fry . It's very tasty .

Small space having some tables for having a perfect snacks session. They have no sitting arrangements. I preferred for a takeaway. Tasted their Chicken cutlet and Fish finger. Both the item tasted good. Can give it a try if you love Bengali vaja items.

Heard so much about this place, so I had to give it a visit...and I did a few months back. Probably my order wasn't too good. I ordered just a chicken roll. They charged 50 bucks.!! I think 50 bucks is a bit overrated for what they offered given the fact that chicken roll at arsalan is 45 or in any other standard place it's 35...the roll was barely ok but nothing too special. The place is quite spacious but has no seating arrangement...n very honestly it looked a bit shabby too. The service was fast n that's the only good thing I can point out.

Yesterday while returning from work decided to visit again!! It was so crowded yet everyone was waiting patiently for their turn. The sole reason was d yummilicious food served here. Rolls... Chicken fish mutton was literally flying over the counter. And d uncle managing the billing was so at ease... Repeating the orders promptly to the cooks in kitchen. And kudos to them, well heard, cooked and properly served as per order. Human chain. 
Coming to food... I packed my fave fish roll and fish fry for home. With salad and mustard dressing Cooked as per order... The food was packed to me piping hot. My fellas at home was so happy with good food. Hot and tasty. Thou... The fillet in the roll has thinned a bit by the time. But the taste didn't. Food was awesomely finger licking. Crisp and succulent portion of stuffing. Yummm. After a long long time i had the normal fish fry. Oh it was so delicious. Had an awesome experience... Throwback to childhood days i must say.

Located in Gariahat, this place is a hidden gem for people who love having Fish Fry-s and all other types of street food. The shop opens at 4 PM in the evening and does not boast of any seating. It is quite spacious and people can stand and have their food in a comfortable manner. We had Mutton Roll, Fish Fry and Mutton Cutlet. The pieces of mutton in the Mutton Roll were juicy and delicious. The Fish Fry and Mutton Cutlet were quite large and tasted fantastic. At Rs. 60 each, both of them are worth every rupee. The service was quite prompt as well.

Had tasted their chicken cutlets and fish fry many times but not the rolls.. So, I ordered Mutton Rolls and Chicken Cutlet. Without a doubt, the best mutton roll I have ever had. The roll was small with actual BIG SUCCULENT chunks of mutton. It was really tasty. The Cutlet as usual was good. Although the price is little bit on the higher side but it can be afforded for the quality that is being served..

Knowing that I'm a huge fan of fried Bengali street food my friend took me to this place which he had been visiting since he was very small. The place is nothing special with tables all around but no seating. When we arrived at the joint there was no one but after a few minutes the place was packed! We had ordered chicken cutlet and fish fry. Both of the dishes were quite good. Even though there was such a rush the food was served to quite fast. It is quite pocket friendly and is an ideal place to grab a quick snack after shopping in Gariahat. The only negative that I had with this place is that I found a big bone in my fish. Apart from that the experience was quite good.

Now in 2017, I can still say they serve the best chicken cutlet in town. Period! You gotta try it. They also serve amazing fish rolls and fish fry. I was startled to see how they still maintained the quality of chicken cutlet. Hats off to these guys.

A good place to indulge in quick bites of popular Bengali fast food. There is arrangement to stand and eat however it's much more suitable to eat on the go. As for pricing, it wasn't too costly as such. 

So we ordered a Paneer Roll, a Chicken Roll and an Egg Mutton Roll. All the rolls were somewhat small but the paneer and chicken rolls were tasty. However the Egg Mutton Roll had very few pieces of the read meat and the meat was too chewy. The Egg Mutton Roll ultimately gave me a severe stomach upset, so disappointed with that.

Campari has been a big part in our college and school days, who can forget the delicious rolls and fish fry from here which we devoured after tutions or after a typical Gariahat shopping spree! The best thing about Campari is that their quality seems to be just as good as it was years ago! 
I love the rolls here, they are not so greasy, heavily loaded with meat and tastes wonderful. The fish kebab roll is our particular favourite. 
Next things we love are the fish fry and the fish fingers. They are quite well sized and have good proportion of fish inside. If you want them to be bigger, go for the Campari special ones, that's huge, and one Campari Special fish fry will fill your tummy for good 😊

We ended in this Roll joint after our shopping spree at Gariahat. It was shocking that they don't have simple Egg Roll on the menu. So we ordered vegetable cutlet, paneer roll and egg paneer roll. The cutlet was good. But the egg paneer roll was bland. It had absolutely no seasoning. So we were really disappointed since we had heard much about Campari and it's rolls. Pocket pinch is on the higher side.

Campari is one of those few places my mother insisted to eat from because she as a college Kid used to stop and eat here.My impression pocket friendly..serves fresh and hot and piping ,rolls are good and the fish fry is nice , its a typical fry and Kolkata fast food ,however I have to say I have had better though maybe not a such a low price point. Keep up the good work though...quality and quantity in such low prices doesn't happen.

There since Tagore I think. My first time here though. Social fish fry is fatter and more elite than his regular counterpart. Well good then, had one. What else ? Campari gives 3.0 hoots to Zomato rating. So chill, live life fish fry size.

Obviously this place is famous in south Kolkata for its rolls. 
We had one chicken roll and one egg chicken roll. The stuffings inside the rolls were generous and the pieces of chicken were succulent. The paratha was crispy and the roll was over all very tasty. It's a must try fast food joint if you're in gariahat.

Old is genuinely gold.Campari has been a joint which every shopaholic has known for years because in between your saree shopping spree here is where you have stopped to fill in with some great fish fries, fingers, and cutlets, and though I am not a huge fan of rolls, I have landed munching into a sumptuous tandoori chicken roll quite often.Their packaged sausages are great!

This place has ruled the roost amongst the eateries in the Gariahat/ Rashbehari/ Ballygunge area for as long as I can remember. Chicken Cutlet, Mutton Cutlet, Egg Chicken Roll (with pieces of lemon given separately) was my standard demand whenever my father took me to his office on dover lane during my school vacations,  on the way back. The area is now saturated with eateries and people are spoiled for choice. However, connoisseurs and old timers never look beyond Campari for a quick bite.

Campari is a small eatery located in Gariahat. There is no seating available here and you'll have to stand and eat your food. 

The famous chicken cutlets dragged me here and boy they were worth it all. Since it was just a friend and me and we were in a rush we only ordered this item, I look forward to visiting this place again to try the other food items. It has a takeaway so cannot comment much about the service and decent standard of hygiene is maintained here.

campari is a small roadside shop in Griahat where you can relish on crunchy authentic cutlets and rolls.This is a small place full of tasty snacks and always crowed.
We heard a lot about this place,even crossed it several times but never had the opportunity to visit. 
So today as we were near Gariahat we decided to eat something from here.
The place is very ordinary, with no seats. However the food is amazingly good.

We had : Special Fish fry,Chicken Cutlet and a Glass of Cold drink.

Fish fry was awesome.The fillet of the fish was very fresh and tasted nice with 'Kashundi'.
Chicken cutlet was the star.A well marinated piece of chicken lightly coated and deep fried.
usually chicken breast pieces are not that favourful.But that piece of chicken was really tender,juicy and delicious.

Service was fast and prices were very reasonable as we had to pay only 150/- rupees for all the 3 items.
This is a must try food outlet for all.
Highly Recommended..........

Campari is one of the legendary oldies of South Kolkata , one which can easily lock horns with the biggies of North Kolkata which usually boasts the most famous outlets for chops and cutlets . But, unlike any other Campari has its own signature style of bringing food to the table and by food I mean of the finest quality . There are a lot of outlets serving fries these days . It's even close to your home but if you are looking for genuine quality you can take away or eat from Campari .


° Location :- If you are coming from gariahat then take the lane which goes to Dover Lane or where the Sinhi Park puja takes place . You will find Campari in just the beginning of the lane on the left hand side .

° Ambience :- Although zomato shows just a take away , there is an option of eating there but you have to stand.  There are boards with hinges attached to the wall so you can place your plates on those boards and have your fries peacefully . Being a small and busy place that is acceptable and who cares when you have good food to gorge upon .

---------------------------------------

° Food :- Although boasting a lot of varieties of fries and rolls following are the items that can be called their signature dishes :- 


1. Fish Roll ( 4 / 5 ) :- Amazing here at campari , this is a huge cucumber shaped fry which had layers of bhetki covering a spicy mashed potato and bhetki in the inside . Although the fry doesn't boast a lot of fish the thing itself is very very tasty . Served hot this crunchy delight is easily one of the instant favourites here and you don't want to miss it .

2. Chicken cutlet ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- I believe this is the best cutlet i have ever had . The breadcrumbs cover a thick fillet of chicken inside which is yummy in taste. Nowhere in the city will give you such a huge amount of chicken in any cutlet at this price . They serve a lot of outlets daily and can give any outlets in North Kolkata a run for their money .


Other than these 2 a much favoured choice is :- 

Special fish fry .

-----------------------------------------------

° Service :- You have to pay the cash in advance and then the food will be served . The fries will be served in 5 minutes max something they really manage because of the workforce in the kitchen . 


Campari is a lovely place to grab an evening snack . Once you are in and around gariahat , this can be your best choice to have good quality food . On the top of that they have coffee and cold drink counters to help you gulp down your fries . A perfect food joint .


Following are the main points :- 

1. Legendary fried and cutlets .
2. Top location as in gariahat .
3. Excellent service time .
4. Got soft drinks and coffee too unlike many other chop / cutlet outlet .


If you are one of those foodies who have Campari in your bookmark list then it is high time to go and scratch it off the list .

Try the fish finger - Rs. 100 for 5 very meaty pieces. 

Frozen food also available. Mutton keema, pieces, liver and chicken also available. Salami too. 

Here's an example : Rs. 110 for 250 gm of tender Mutton. Great quality.

Having been in Kolkata for only six months, I decided to discover most of the popular heritage joints. Campari was lying dormant on my wish list for a long time until one evening I decided to venture out. It's located at a busy intersection and is immediately traceable. The place doesn't have chairs but have a few stand-in tables for the customers. 

The place was teeming with life when I visited it and greeted by the smiling guy behind the counter. The first thing I ordered was the fish roll - don't be mistaken by the roll, it's a much better and less oily version of the fish orley. Beneath the bread crumb batter was a thick layer of bhetki and the entire thing was stuffed with masala mashed bhetki. This should be their claim to fame. It was simply juicy and sinful. 

This was followed by the fish cutlet, no doubt good what with its thin batter and more fish. The mutton roll was so-so and quite dry and one could give it a miss easily. The chicken cutlet has a tail which is visually quite appealing but once again gastronomically nothing which stands apart. Be sure to visit this place with a friend if you don't have a voracious appetite.

Campari is a legendary place for fast food in Gariahat. There are very few people who have come shopping in this area and not tried their snacks. I love their fish fry and chicken cutlet. Their fish roll is also delicious. However, we got their chicken cutlet home a couple of days back and it seemed a little dry.

When a place opens at 4pm, and gets  swamped by 4.15 - it means something massive ! With that backdrop of hungry customers eagerly swarming in, I peacefully sipped a weird chemical flavoured artificial pineapple juice which was not bad, and then packed home a fish fry and another special cutlet. 

The fish fillet was fresh and nice for both and tasted identical, but they forgot to parcel kasundi which didn't give the missing zing. The roll from here is also very good and has been a crowd puller for years. 

They also have a very good range of frozen meat at reasonable price, which is what I am eyeing for my next visit.

In verdict : if you are in Garihat for shopping, do visit this place at least once.

Honestly, I find it tough to really judge first class Indian fast food places serving the same menu comparatively, since there are so many roll-chop-cutlet-mughlai options in Garihat, and beyond that meticulous analysis, all greasy deep fried meat with kasundi or chilli sauce combinations are heavenly on a generic basis !

We all know Kolkata is famous for its affordable, tasty and mouthwatering street food and one of such eateries that justifies this statement would be definitely campari. Located in the by lanes of gariahat(doverlane), this is one authentic street food joint which is now legendary. Whenever you are in gariahat be it for the old book stalls or clothes, maximum of kolkatan had tasted rolls at this place. Cutlets, especially fish with kasundi and chicken rolls are my personal favorite. This place restores a lot of memories whenever i visit. 😊 I leave this place with a content tummy and a happy smile on face.

Campari – The taste of Kolkata. For the authentic cutlet and the classic Kolkata roll, one just has to visit Campari. You will be a convert from day one. Situated in the shopping district of south Kolkata, it’s always part of the shopping list. While the mouth-watering cutlets served with Kasundi, (the pungent mustard sauce) and some salad is great, the rolls –fish, chicken and mutton are the true undefeatable heroes. Unlike its cousins in central Kolkata, the paratha is not over fried or flaky, it’s thin and covers the lightly cooked meat inside. The fish roll here is like an elongated chop, that melts in your mouth creating a magical experience for your taste buds. This great place has been consistent in quality for the last two decades and will always be an important destination on the Kolkata food map.

The place is famous in the gariahat area for their rolls and cutlets. The mutton cutlet is great. The fish fry and the chicken and mutton rolls are great. The food is really filling for the price. The only complaint I have is that they can provide seating arrangements instead of making the customers stand and eat, which seems like a pain to me.

Visited Campari plenty of times. It's a place to hit for quick bites and evening snacks. 
No seating arrangements. 
Service is ok. Actually its kinda self-service. You need to take the food from the counter yourself & look for a space to stand and have it. 
Whenever I come here, I prefer sticking to the chicken cutlet & fish fry. Campari has maintained their quality of food and it lives upto its name.
The chicken cutlet is really good. In case of the fish fry, you can distinctly taste the fish fillet within, unlike other snack-corners where the fish fry lacks the fish or bears the smelly fish.
My rating is entirely based on these two particular snacks mentioned above. I have no idea about the others stacked in the menu.

If you're craving for quintessential Bangali snacks, then this is the place to visit!
Had heard a lot about this joint, had even crossed it several times but never had the opportunity to visit. So today as I was roaming around near Gariahat and I started getting hunger pangs I decided to munch something from here.
The place is absolutely ordinary, with no seats. However the food is amazingly good. If you're a chop, cutlet, fish fry lover, this place will satiate you immensely. We ordered :
• Chicken cutlet - yummm. 
• Fish fry - the fillet was literally melting in my mouth. Absolutely delightful. 
All this for 100 bucks! :D The quantity and quality was very very commendable. Total value for money!
I'm surely visiting again to try out the rest of the bhaja bhuji's. :P

This quintessential food joint located at gariahat was one of the best joint visited by me in a long time. Campari gives you a feel of old Kolkata cabins where people  go for a quick bite for their evening snacks. A small little place flooded with customers of all age groups, all coming with the intention of eating the delicious fish fry,  chicken cutlets, mutton cutlets available. I liked the concept of the smart hanging tables where you can place your food and eat. The service is prompt and fast. The food... Well I loved the special fish fry a lot. O think I tasted good quality fish fry after ages.  The size of the fillet is perfect for one and the crispy layer on the outside is icing on the cake. The salad and kasundi adds to the entire taste and a foodie like me cannot be satisfied with one fish fry for sure.  I also tried the mutton cutlet and it was super tasty.  The quantity of the minced mutton was awesome and it kind of fills ones stomach for the evening. There are also mango and pineapple drinks available.  I tried the mango Pannal and it was a relishing end to my eating episode at Campari. A must visit for all fish lovers.  I packed fish fry for my mother and she too loved it.  Best part was the way the packing was done...  The fish fry was still hot and did not turn soggy as it usually happens when you pack such stuff.

A small place full of tasty snacks and always crowed. Cutlets and Rolls are too good, both in taste and size.
One must try snacks from this road side food place.
-- Oh don't forget to take the Kasundi...

Located at the bustling heart of the city, campari is a small wayside shop in gariahat where you can relish on crunchy 'tele bhajas' to authentic fine dine cutlets and rolls. The hot items on their menu are always chicken cutlet and fish roll. And don't forget... none of this tastes as good as with a big dollop of 'kashondi'. Bon appetit!

Campari is a small snacks joint near basanti devi college. They are serving quality snack from nearly late 90's.

Tried their rolls and fish fry which was famous in here. Great in taste and the service was just too fast...

Unpopular opinion, I'm aware (my father would violently disagree with my review here)- but I've never liked food from Campari. It's patrons swear by the rolls, which seem dry to me, and often overwhelm my taste buds to leave me almost nauseated. The chicken cutlet is a huge chunk of tasteless dry meat, the fish fry is pretty much the same. The kebabs are decent, I suppose, but that is it. I'm no stranger to Campari, my school was nearby, I've had many a snack here, but I could never enjoy the food, although my family members love going there.

If you are still searching for that one place which serves one of the best, if not the best rolls in the city then look no further and run to Campari. Generous amounts of meat, veggies and a heavy sprinkling if lemon and chillies make up the legendary rolls that Campari is famous for. I heard the fish fries are equally good, but I have left that for another time. The warm behaviour of the person manning the shop adds to the experience. Also, the place doesn't serve egg rolls, but that's OK I guess if you get huge egg chicken rolls instead.

Rolls and cutlets from campari have always been a sheer bliss. Can't imagine how I forgot to review this place. Today I went there at about 4 and found it to b packed with ppl inspite of the tremendous heat. And when Bengalis are there rolls can never go wrong. I had the usual egg chicken roll and chicken cutlet. The USP of campari's rolls is the paratha they use. It's incredibly fluffy and tasty with bits of chicken stuffed generously within salad. Cutlet is again a thums up. Big and filling and tasty and piping hot.:-)
The service is super fast and u can even have tea or juice from there as well. The only complaint that I have is they do not have an AC which is an absolute necessity in this sultry weather. N I do not like to have my food standing either. Apart from these issues I am in love with this place. Campari will always hold a special place in my heart.

My God... How come I never reviewed this treasure... For a south Calcutta born and bred girl, prowling gariahat all her life it is almost sacrilage!!! Much as I live to eat Kati rolls, there are 3 or 4 joints in Kolkata that truly nails the stuff .... From the thin well cooked paratha to the blanket of egg... ( yes I am a egg-mutton, egg-chicken roll fan).... To the succulent, tender pieces of Mutton and chicken..... Campari absolutely excels in the art of roll making..... And that is no mean feat... Their Cutlet and fries are great too... But nothing beats their rolls... With the just right amount to spice and chillies added to the palate of the person ordering.... I like my rolls hot... Yum yum...
I promise to add pictures of the delicious grub asap... The prospect itself makes my mouth water!!!

They make one of best tastiest, delicious snacks in the town, a great place to have a quick bite with your friends, located in the busiest street of south kolkata garia hut, a pocket friendly food center a must for the street food and fast food lover. Chicken cutlets and rolls are absolute delight over there. And they serve the food really fast, although they can increase the sitting arrangements otherwise everything is nice and great.

This place is quite famous for its rolls.
What sets this apart from other fast food places is its decor-5 small tables where you can stand and have your food.Few evenings ago I tried out their Special Chicken Roll.Served with lemons and green chillies,its tasty enough but there was really nothing special about it.
Service was quite fast inspite of so many customers.

The chicken rolls are just too good here, everytime i visit gariahat i go to this joint which has a lot to offer from fish fry to rolls. The good part about about rolls is they are not greasy, and the chicken stuffed inside is kebabs so the roll is something different than what you get in any other place

Through out our childhood n adolescence alike, we've (my spouse and I, individually and together) spent many evenings gorging on their famous rolls, cutlets n fries. So going back to this place is always a feeling of homecoming.
Anyways, last Saturday, wandering thru the streets of gariahat, we decided to go back to this evergreen eatery again. I, then remembered that I've never reviewed it or posted any pics of their food. But then, campari, the name stands out for itself.
The evening was lazy and we were hungry. We decided to have a special fish fry and a chicken cutlet.
We had to wait for a few minutes, but it was worth the wait. We were served with both of our orders. They were smoking hot and seductive in their appearance.
Slicing up a hearty piece from the fish fry, dipping it in the potent kasundi and inspite of the intimidating smoke arising from the piece of the fry, putting it right where it belongs, then chewing and doing the customary "huuu haaa" and promising urself of not repeating the same mistake again but repeating it nonetheless, well that's what a life of foodie is all about. That's what campari is all about. Lol.
But then, I thought campari, after all these years has lost their Midas touch. The coating on the fry was more than what it should be ideally. The fillet of the fish was bit thin. Overall their competitor near rashbehari, who shall remain unnamed serves better fish fry.
But the chicken cutlet was the game changer. A big chunk of meat coated with minimal batter and fried crisply was on another level. The best thing about the chicken cutlet was that it had a subtle taste of butter or cheese in it, which made it extremely delicious.
However, the showstopper in the campari menu has always been their rolls, various type of them. From my previous experience, they will rock you.

P.s. I've rated this place based on the knowledge and taste I've stored in for many years. So this review is kinda biased.
If it was unbiased I'd be rating it 3.2-3.5. They indeed have lost their touch.

Since it's near my Colg I make sure to grab a snack every time I pass through this street.I'm a huge foodie so I've decided to try each and every item that's available in the menu.
Recently tried the campari mutton roll and fish fry. Campari is famous for its delicious snacks and yep it turned to be true. The yummy (but oily) fish fry was so tasty that I could devour some more fish fries that day,on the other hand the juicy mutton roll was so tasty that you'll feel like having it again and again.
I'll keep visiting this awesome place time and again.
P.S - the only negative thing is that they only remain open at evening.So if you visit this place before 5pm chances are you might have to come back with an empty stomach.

Located at the busy streets of gariahat, this can be the best place for you to grab a quick bite while u r on a shopping spree or just passing by.
The place is neat and clean and it needs no ambience since it is a take away counter or a place to grab some quick snacks.
I have only tasted their campari spcl fish fry priced at 80 bucks.it was big, filling and very tasty..wat impressed me the most is the amount of fish used in the fillings..the fish was fresh , flaky nd nd soft nd tasted really good.
One of the best fish fry i hv had so far.
Do gv it a try! Its pocket friendly(prices on the higher sides if u compare it with neighbouring street food joints) nd u gt a neat place to enjoy ur snacks unlike in other places at gariahat where u hv to jostle with ur food on street..

Visited here several times, mainly during shopping in Gariahat adjacent areas. Located near Basanti Devi College, at the next lane  most probably, this is a small joint, yet serves very tasty fries. We had chicken / mutton cutlets, fish finger and Campari Special Mutton Roll. It was huge but didnt felt heavy. Mutton and other inputs were evenly spread.

Cutlets tasted good and a feeling of aadi bangaliyana can be found somewhere. May be its similar look and feel to Mitra cafe style, but way less small.

Recommended. Will be visiting again.

This small little joint located near Dover lane is a true hidden gem indeed. Doesn't score high on ambience or decor you need to stand at small tables to have your food or go for takeaway.However it scores a ton with each of its blockbuster dishes.Fish fry,fish roll cutlets served with karsundi (mustard) chopped onions and green chilli. Bite into them and your taste buds are guaranteed to ask for more.. Their rolls are soft not at all oily and stuffed with juicy chicken /mutton or fish and they are mouthwatering.Overall a fantastic place if you love rolls cutlets and Fries. Visit them early they run out of stock fast.

Visited the place after a long long time....nearly 8-9 years. Not much has changed. The place remains the same....the long queue of people waiting to place their order, the microphone to convey the order to the kitchen, no seats, the quality of food, the feel of that 'old' roll shop in Gariahat that I used to visit with my mother......it's all still there.
 The mutton/chicken rolls, Chicken cutlet, Fish rolls, Fish fries are cooked in the minimum amount of oil. All are excellent to taste too.
Was however a bit disappointed with the portions of each item served....although the quality is as excellent as ever, the quantity has seen a drastic reduction. Would like them to improve on that.
There is not much to say regarding the service as it is more of a self help system.
It's my belief that they serve fresh food as they are done with their stocks pretty early in the evening. So, if you are a bit late many of the items will not be available.

I am an ardent fan of Campari's snacks for about 10 years now. Be it the Roll, Cutlet or the Kebab, Campari's food will never disappoint you. The quality has remained the same for over a decade now. However as is the case with most snack joints, the ambience and service has to be discounted when you are given the best snacks at the correct location i.e. near Gariahat more.

Rolls have formed a  very important part of my Bengali existence! Thus review about Campari is always going to be biased. This small take away in gariahat area (near basanti devi college) serves  delicious, meaty  not-so-greasy  Rolls and succulent Cutlets. Their chicken cutlet and egg chicken rolls are a childhood favourite. They also serve tea and coffee. Prices are a tad bit higher than the usual roadside roll shops.  So if you are a Kolkatan who loves his roll you must not miss Campari.

I have there campari special chicken roll and chicken cutlet... taste was ok.... although I find the place was full always and the items are fresh as towards 8:00 pm most of the items get out of stock... pocket pinch was little high u think...

Has been visiting this place innumerable times since childhood,one of the reason it being located in my school area and the other being marketing at Gariahat.

Location-the lane beside Basanti devi college beside the Archies shop
The standout food here is the Fish cutlet.The chicken roll and the egg chicken roll along with muttoon rolls are also too tasty.They serve the chillies and lime by the side which enables u for a personal customization.
Although its not airconditioned,being located by the side of the road,its airy.
However here there is no sitting arrangement,there are only tall tables.
The prices are comparitively higher than that of other roll centres of Kolkata,and due to their awesome taste,it is predictable.

We had campari special chicken roll and fish fry with kasundi... The fish fry was out of the world for that price.... Definitely better than what most restaurants serve...
I am not a fan of chicken roll but this was different... Because not only is it non oily but also non-heavy...the chicken was succulent and tender...the paratha was also light...
All in all, a must visit place

One of my favorite places in kolkata to have some snacks. The location is ideal, very near gariahat crossing. They have a quite a range of foods throughout the day : puri and sabjii in the mornings till 10am and biryani from 12-4 and then they have a wide range of snacks. Though the prices at first glance may seem high, it is worth it as the food is fresh and the quality unparalleled. My personal favourites are the fish kebab and the chicken cutlet and the campari specials!

So finally, I started my Puja journey + Kolkata's food journey with this place. It is a very famous place near Hindusthan park for serving cutlets, rolls etc.

Location:

If you are at Gariahat more, then take the road which is going towards Rashbihari Avenue. Take right turn (within 200 meters from Gariahat more) which is going towards Singhi Park. You will find it on your left hand side just after the turn.

Ambiance:

It is a very small place. There is no seating arrangements, but few small tables are there to keep your plates on it and eat.

Obviously, this is not a place which you should go for its ambiance.

Rating: 2.5/5

Service:

I must say that the service was remarkably fast. It is quite obvious that during puja, the place will be full of crowd, even though they managed the crowd very well. Behavior was also polite. I was not able to find it, so called them twice, but they did not show any kind of rudeness in spite of managing humongous amount of orders coming from other end of the phone. Another remarkable point about their service is that as soon as someone finished his or her plate, without any lag of time they cleared it off so that next person could use the table.

Rating: 4.5/5

Cost:

They only accepts cash. For two it will cost you around 150 rupees. Felt that the size of the roll was very less compare to the price they were charging for it. Except that, it is a VFM place.

Rating: 3.5/5

Food:

After going through lot of review about this place at Zomato, I decided to try their famous chicken cutlet and fish roll.

Chicken cutlet was served with kasundi and few amount of salads. It contains a solid piece of chicken with a bone to hold it properly, but I felt it could have been better if the garnishing had been done properly. Rating: 3.5/5

Fish Roll: It was the first time that I tried fish roll. It was a kind of spring roll. The outlet layer was done by a fish fillet. They stuffed something inside it which was very bad in taste. I would have recommended this item if the stuffing material was good. Rating: 3/5

Rating: 3.5/5

Every South Calcuttan is thoroughly cognizant of this name, Campari !
This tiny little eatery is a hole in the wall, hence unquestionably easy to be missed by those who are less privy with Gariahat. So make no hesitation in asking for directions from local shops and fellow pedestrians.

The place is small and carries still the essence of old Calcutta. The interior, the minimalist decorations, the seating arrangements which I am afraid is really insufficient, will emanate the old styles.

However the best thing is they have retained the old flavours and dishes too, intact! So you're going to have some incredible savouries including rolls, deep-fried ones, chicken, egg and other items besides the simple salad. And the tastes? Fantastic!

Now prices are really low. But the odds are quite a few, so you can imagine that prices are not the source of headache always!

Firstly be mentally prepared to wait for your turn in a long queue. They are serving many people. Customers like us also like to pick food for home en route home. So if you think you're wasting time or rather don't have time then come here another day. Next problem is that they don't have enough seats. So you may have to stand inside with your dish or stand outside the same way.

In any case I truly think this place is something you must try. It's an old brand that's been serving generations of Calcuttans with delightful foods. So do try!

I Was strolling through gariahat market area when i came across this place and saw it was very crowded... i was excited with the thought of seeing a food joint which was new to me and the rush in that shop convinced me that the food is goin to be good.... i straight away walked inside looked into the menu which was there above the food counter, quicly scrolled and ordered for a plate of fish finger... the service was fast and the food was fresh n piping hot...the 1st bite itself brought smile to my face beacuse it yumm...before i could finish my fish finger my eyes started scrolling through the menu again..haha... i ordered for a mutton roll and this was the 1st time ever in my life that i was goin to eat mutton roll, after finishing my 1st order i dug into the roll....and the 1st bite itself made me their fan...the paratha was soft and not very oily also and the mutton wrapped inside was so soft n tender too, i simply loved it.... the preparation was perfectly done...  and it tasted superb.... next time i shall try out their other items from the menu... :)

Had heard the name from my friends & relatives. But really very good non-veg fast food cooked with care. The rolls are real soft with a different signature taste. Also the cutlets are good for a non-veg snack treat in the evening to make ur tastebuds & tummy contented. One more thing to mention is the ambience & cleanliness, giving the customer a whole new 'eating with pleasure' experience.

I am in love with the chicken cutlet of Campari. They generous amount of chicken which is soft with balanced spices.. The rolls are also very good. The mutton roll is also of very good quality. Try the tikiya roll for a different experience.  The place is tiny and always full of customers... The mustard sauce they serve is strong and aromatic.. The price is reasonable when your rate it with the quality.. I keep coming to this place whenever I am in that location and would recommend it.

It is famous for its cutlet and rolls. In fact, a Calcuttan would refer to a roll as "Camparir roll" instead of chicken roll or egg roll or anything else.
Located in a side line by Rashbehari Avenue, the shop never appears empty. It is always full.
However, it is nothing exclusive. It is just that the taste is very good.

Ordered egg chicken roll. The item was overpriced and it was very much ordinary.i didn't expect such item will come at so much high price.this food joint is running because of its good name even though items are priced high but if very much ordinary item is provided at a high price then I guess this food shop will lose customers.  Oh I forgot- it is at very good location so they will take advantage and loot blindly!!!..very very bad experience and I will never order for the same item again.

First time when I visited this place, I was in 1st standard. My last visit here was last Saturday. An association spanning over 24 years, this place has never disappointed me. Excellent chicken cutlet - one of Kolkata's best till date - solid chicken and no nonsense. Very very affordable price, surprisingly even in these inflation marked times. Other special mentions - Fish Fry, Fish Roll and Chicken Roll stuffed with kebabs.
Hope it stays the same over the coming years.

One of my favourite snacks corner. I have been coming to this joint for last 7-8 years. One of the favourite joint for school goers. 
 It is located near dover road, beside Archies. A small joint with no seating arrangements, just few small side tables are there. 
 One of the best chicken roll is served here. Mutton cutlet and chicken cutlet are good too. This time i tried a new dish that is chicken kebab. It's different from the usual ones. Some pieces of boneless chicken with onions. It tasted good. I ordered one pineapple juice too. It was less like a juice and more like a flavoured water.
  A very cheap and pocket friendly affair and it has never disappointed me. If you are late, you may get disappointed for some items being unavailable, since it is so much in demand.

Wanted to sample their famous cutlets and fish fry for a long time. Finally landed here about 2 months back.

It's a small shop where people mostly order for takeaway, but mini tables are also present for people to stand and eat there itself.

The two of us ordered a Chicken Cutlet, a Mutton Cutlet and a Fish Fry. All three items were served to us in 10 mins accompanied by salad & mustard sauce (popularly called 'rai' in Bengali).

The best of the lot was the Chicken Cutlet. It was the best I have ever had. The fish fry was okay - it had a faint 'aanshte' smell, which we tried to overlook. The Mutton Cutlet was a disaster. A major portion of the mutton inside was quite raw & 2 bites of it kept me feeling nauseated for the rest of the evening.

The extremely bad experience with the Mutton Cutlet has scared me to visit this place again. When I will be successful in the future to gather enough courage to come here again, I will give their famous rolls a try.

Campari is situated in the heart of gariahat and it is always crowded . Campari is my favourite from childhood. My friends feel jealous 'cause i live so close to this place and nearly every week i gorge on something from here. Every single item in the menu is great, special mentions to be made for fish fry and chicken roll. Rolls are different here than other roll shops as they don't use oil , it's a wrap kind of without losing the flavour of bengali rolls. Whenever a guest comes to visit we come here and pack some lipsmacking snacks from here. 
p.s. if you have a small party at your home keep campari in mind  !!

Campari had always been the saviour, and often the reason I endured long journeys to hear even longer lectures when in high school.
I used to save money to buy their rolls(they cost 40 back then, for a chicken one), and even brought back their paneer roll for maa.
Well seasoned, moist chicken tikias in a mildly sweet, flaky buttery wrap with the simplest adornment of onions, extra chili and lime, it was filling and a match made in heaven. Also their rolls taste equally good, if not better when cold, no dalda being the primary reason. I always asked for a bit of mustard sauce which made it even more delectable.
Mom's paneer rolls (on the rare times she allowed me a bite) had lovely smoky soft tikkas in it, and an absolute delight.
The service was quick and heart-warming, and with a smile.
And pocket friendly too 😊

So you've shopped to your heart's content in Gariahat and suddenly feeling hungry?  Step into this tiny joint for the absolutely fantastic fish fry and kathi rolls. Hands down this place serves great food and the tastiest fish fry in entire South Kolkata.  There's no seating arrangement and the place does not open up before 4 pm. Still the place is great when it comes to yummy food. A must visit if you haven't already been there.

Campari with soda is a delight for connoisseurs of alcoholic drinks as an aperitif.

Campari with their snacks is a delight for people shopping or moving around Gariahat.

This is an old takeaway joint where people also stand and eat,after waiting for around 15 mins.

I ordered fish fry,chicken cutlet and chicken kebab.I have only praise for all three,with the chicken cutlet being 5/5,the other two being 4.5/5.It again reiterates my theory that if you have the food right,then you have nothing to worry.The public will reward you.Long live.....

The serving time is very prompt.The outlet is a non Ac food joint also this joint don't have a proper sitting arrangement. Overall, they are awesome. Just try out over there. They are simply awesome.

One of the renowned fish Fry stalls in the Gariahat region. Tried the Chicken Roll, Fish Roll and the Fish Fry and wasn't disappointed but I have tasted better at Sankar's fry just a few blocks ahead near Rabindra (triangular park). 

The crust on the fish fry felt a little more compared to the quantity of filling but it was very tasty. The roll was very good as well.

The funny thing about this place is that I had been here a couple of times over the years but never knew its name.
So when I saw pretty decent 4.3 rating on Zomato, I thought of giving this age old high flier a try.
As soon as I reached their location, near gariahat, I recalled my memories . My word! Those memories weren't a pleasant one.
Till date I had never fallen prey to a false positive on Zomato, so I thought may be Campari (a name which I didn't bother to register before) might have brought about some changes that would be complimented by my taste buds.
So I ordered a chicken roll and a mutton cutlet. And one bite into the meat, I realised, it was the same old dryness which I dread in a meat dish. The mutton cutlet was hard on the outside as well as in the inside . No improvements here.
Chicken roll also had the same problem. The meat was too dry for my palette. So in the light of things I would never recommend having this 'holier than thou' snack at campari as you'll find far better rolls at lesser prices all over the city of joy.
The thing worth mentioning about this place is the mustard sauce which has managed to retain its charm over the years.

Take a break from shopping in gariahat and visit Campari with no second thought in mind for mouth watering cutlets and rolls. Its a tiny joint located beside the Archie's on the way to Gariahat Spencers.Fish fries ,fingers and chicken cutlet are must haves with the mustard sauce(kasundi) and salad.Recently there is a hike in their rates but still its quite reasonable.  Surely its a hidden gem as suggested by Zomato.P.S: Its a self help place with no seating. Happy Snacking!!1 :)

Banking has always been a affair I dolted upon even wgen I didnt know when to sign my name. When I was a newbee at South Point after School I used often visit the Central Bank with my grandmother. And for my patience lunch was often packed from Campari. It is hands down the best Chicken Cutlet and Fish Fry I have ever had. Recently I tried their Fish tandoori Roll and it was rich in its flavours but was not overpowering in a bad way. I also love there mutton cutlet abd campari special chicken roll.

I'm well into my 20s now , grandpa is gone but the good taste of the chicken cutlet is there . never forget to pick it up whenever in gariahat area :)

Well what can I say... Went there with a lot of expectation and alot of campaigning to my parents and next door neighbors... And after reading the reviews I thought the chicken cutlets nd the fish fry will be the perfect evening snacks to complement the onset of the monsoons.... But alas... I was disappointed... They didn't taste exceptional to me..they were very dry..  Infact I found them to be in stark contrast to Apanjan... Maybe this was like Mangal Pandey by Amir Khan... Good film but could not meet Amir's.... Campari to me was short of my expectations... But as a standalone joint it still serves good food... I will however wait for sometime to try the rolls.. They looked awesome... And then possibly improve my personal ratings...

#Review no. 2: Campari cravings were killed today evening, where i gorged on their lipsmacking Chicket Cutlets yet again. Also tried their Fish Tandoori Roll for the very first time, and was really satisfied with the thick and chunky fish tandoori pieces. The roll.had very less oil in it which made me like it a tad bit more than other places who make it. Mutton Cutlet was the last order which I made, like its Chicken counterpart, the mutton cutlet is made pretty much the same way and looks almost identical. The mutton fillet wasnt as thick as we have it in.the chicken, nevertheless it was quite good. Overall a very happy n satisfied experience as always. :)

Well this is one of the best places to have excellent quality Rolls and cutlets.
I have been going to campari since I was in junior school, and it still gives the same good quality food. 
Their mutton and chicken cutlets are superb.
You cant simply miss out on their chicken and paneer rolls. Like as they say 'Good things come in small packages', this place is an apt example of it.
Also try out the fish fingers.
All in all this is a must try for people wanting to have some quick quality snacks
!
Wish I could tag all pointers here !

Chicken Roll, Mutton Roll, Fish Roll, Fish Fry, but the best is the Roll and that too oil free. Having it from the time I was a kid. Quality hasn't dropped a bit over the years. Easy to locate, near Gariahat.

Campari is very popular and my parents love it. I personally find their rolls a bit bland but will give them plus points for being low on the oil. Their rolls are very good though and might appeal to your palate.

Their fish fry is awesome and a must try. As a person who generally avoids fish, I'd still recommend their fish fry over their chicken roll!

Furthermore, I recently saw that they also have mango and pineapple cold drinks available. Both are good and you should try their mango one.

The Sundays in my childhood times were never complete without a parcel of chicken cutlet from Campari!
I remember dad used to bring them home while coming from office in the evening. The whole family would sit in the dining table with plates arranged and my joy would know no bounce!
Dad would take the bites with green chilies along with mustard sauce and almost weep his eyes out because of the spicy affect from it!
Well, it still is the same old thing with this fast food joint. I prefer the fish fingers with tomato sauce and on in on rings.

Just try out the chicken cutlet, you will surely fall in love with it.  Breaking the cutlet, there will be thick juicy chicken and the sight is sure to flood your mouth. It really is the best cutlet i have had.
If only this place had a place to sit..
I would love to munch on their cutlet through out the day. 
A huge huge thumbs up from me!

Campari is one of the more renowned roll shops of the city serving up quality rolls,fries and cutlets since ages.Located in Gariahat beside Basanti Devi College it is extremely popular among the college goers and the shoppers and it is easy to see why.

They use a thick slab of good quality fish in their fish fry which is one of my favourites here.It is probably not as good as the one you get at Apanjan in Kalighat(which is my all time favourite) but this is the one place that runs Apanjan close and that too at almost half the price.The rolls are nice and crisp with a generous amount of filling.They serve the chillies and lime separately which enables one to customise according to personal preference.The cutlets are pretty good here too and again one of the best in town.

The interior is nice and clean and although it is not air conditioned it is thankfully rather airy.They have simple stand and eat arrangements.The prices are understandably higher than the other roll outlets in the vicinity but the superior quality is there for all to see.

Overall Campari is a wonderful place to have a tasty filling and crunchy evening snack. Enjoy! :)

Campari is a landmark in itself in Gariahat. Everyone knows where it is situated and about their mouth watering snacks. 
Just a couple of blocks before Basanti Devi College they serve some lip smacking rolls. 
I have literally grown up on their snacks. I love their chicken roll and thankfully unlike the other places they do not compromise on the quality of the chicken. Their mutton roll is an all time favourite ask the chicken egg roll is also quite nice.. If you will order a roll out here you will understand the difference between this joint and the other places where you can find different rolls that they use less spices and oil and still it tastes good! 
I love their fish fry, the crust is deep and crunchy and full on flavours . Also you can always get good quality uncooked raw meat/keema at good reasonable prices. 
It's a small shop and there's no seating arrangement as such, there's just a counter and some high rising tables where you can stand and eat your food, no air conditioning too. But the food is amazing and the restaurant has been around for ages, I would really like this place to remain here for many more years to come..

A south Calcutta special... This place had been there for ages.... It's known for its rolls, chicken cutlets and fish fries.
Interesting thing about the rolls is that the paratha used is soft compared to the hard fried ones... And they don't put chillies or lemon inside the roll... It's served separately ...
The quality of the food is really good and it's relatively inexpensive....

Gariahat .... 25 years ago ..... No Flyover, Fewer Hawkers, much less traffic and in the midst of it all a bunch of kids come to Kolkata (Mamar bari for a cpl of days of chutti). Come 4 pm we would as if on cue all simultaneously feel intense hunger pangs that would somehow only be satisfied by Campari Rolls. Soft delicious rolls were always the hallmark of Campari and my favourites have always been the Chicken and the Fish Tandoori Rolls. The shop has remained unchanged over the years and still has the microphone which is used to relay orders to the kitchen staff ( its no biggie today but some 25 odd years ago it was quite a novelty).

Campari where my cousins and I spent many an evening wolfing down rolls and although times have changed if ever I am hungry at 4 pm I am inevitably reminded of Campari :).

I took the help of Zomato to find this place. I was excited at first but the chicken rolls are not something extraordinary and I seriously think they are not 50/60 bucks. 

However the fish fries looked decent. I will say again, nothing special about the food and I feel its a bit overpriced as well. 
If you have good money then I would not advice you to spend your time here.

I was brought up at location near to Campari and I use to relish their food every second day. They are pioneer of cutlets and my favorite is chicken. Cutlets in other shops will be thick batter over inner potato mash coating and thin slice slice of meat inside. But here the proportion of meat is much more. 

Rolls over here is expensive but one has to shell out those extra bucks for those extra meat inside roll or for crunchiness of paratha. Difference is evident compared to Bedouin or similar.

P.S. Suggestion to Zomato to enlist them under "Roll With It" category.

I visited this place yesterday for the second time with my mother. Had chicken cutlet which I tasted before and fish fry for the first time. Chicken cutlet was good like my previous experience. But the fish fry to be very frank was not much impressive. I had better fish fry and that so with the same price. The price is reasonable. I would like to visit again after reading so many good reviews about their rolls and mutton items. I hope for better experience next time. I give it 2 marks for the chicken cutlet and 1 for the fish fry.

Campari is not just any roll place, it is a legend. I wonder how Zomato overlooked this beauty for its great rolls collection. I love the fish roll, the mutton cutlet and fish fry. Though the prices a just a tad bit steeper than other neighboring roll corners, the size is massive and the dishes generally contain less oil. This small eatery has maintained its reputation for serving delightful and hygienic fast food for years now and I see no signs of its popularity decreasing. A must visit after a shopping spree in Gariahat.

A totally-yummy snack outlet at Gariahat near Dover Lane. Once, during school days my mom as a gift for a good grade in a test, took me to Campari and ordered chicken roll for me. Since then I have never liked chicken roll so much in any other roll outlet. I have had cutlets and kababs here and everything tastes just perfect. Even now chicken roll and a glass of soft drinks suits me for an ideal snack in the evening while out shopping at Gariahat

This is the legendary place, a sort of landmark at Gariahat. This joint has been there for ages and if you really want to have some delicious Cutlets and Fish Fries do try them out. I am not sure how many times I have been there since my childhood, I've probably tried all the items on their menu. Recently when I was there after almost two years I had their Mutton Cutlet (which is my favorite) and Mango Panna. The food was as usual served real quick and the cutlet was quite big and piping hot, in fact it was so hot I didn't get any taste of the food in my first bite. A while later the taste and aroma captivated me and it was really an explosion of glory there in my mouth. The mutton was fresh and it was so generously stuffed in the cutlet, unlike many other places serving mutton cutlets in the city. The fruit juice is tad too watery but quenches thirst on a hot summer afternoon, also it goes well with the cutlets, fries and rolls. There is really nothing to mention about the ambiance, you will find no remarkable decor at this stand-and-eat eatery, but it's the food which will make you come back for more. Quality never gets compromised at this place and so the price you pay is quite justified. Hope they can go on and on, keep serving us these mouth-watering delicacies for generations to come. Let the legend live long!

Cheers!

I have totally ignored this place more times than i can remember after going through their prices. After all why would you pay 50 rupees for a simple chicken roll?? Its Kolkata not Delhi or Bombay!!!
But trust me. If u don't mind shelling out that extra cash, the food is totally worth it. The quality that goes hand in hand with the prices is worth a mention. 
You will find more meat and more freshness in every bite if you compare it to a traditional bedwin roll or fish fry.
Campary is not one of those restaurants that cheats its customers by hiding behind the veil of brand value. Instead it offers excellent value for money.
Do try out the fish fry and the chicken rolls. You wont regret paying that extra 30 bucks.

Campari is an old favourite of my late father. Whenever, my father visited us and went to Gariahat, getting something from this very small place is a must! Whenever it was fish fry or cutlets, it absolutely had to be brought from this particular place which was a clear instruction of my father. And always, the kasaundi of this place used to trip my senses and my head. 

I remember, eating half a fish roll, when I was small and not being able to finish that as well. After years, probably, grandmother of mine got something for us from this place. I had mutton cutlets today. Unlike, the small joints that serves very bad quality mutton which is rubber-like undercooked, the campari people, serves very well battered, cooked mutton. I was definitely whirled back to my childhood days, which lit up my face and my mood as a whole.

I just wish, my father was tasting them too with me today.

Positives: Everything. Even the salad that they give seems fresh and not two day old chopped vegetables.

Negatives: The price is slightly on a steeper side, but they provide with a good amount of food.

If you are thinking about Fish Fry or Fish Roll, you are bound to think of Campari. After Bijoligril, this is the place to go and satisfy your fish fry hunger. I love the fish roll too. Its big with generous layer of fish and tasty filling inside. Its hot and fresh and tastes heavenly with Kasundi. Be a little early cause they exhaust their fish items pretty quick. You dont want to be dreaming of that heavenly tastey fry and then be told "sesh hoye geche" at the counter. Foodie Tragedy!!
There are no chairs. Just some ply shelves that serves as tables. Waiting time is practically non-existent. 5-10 mins on an average. The rolls are very good too. The parathas are fried in minimum amount of oil and the chicken/mutton pieces are generous and mouthwateringly tasty. Should try the Campary special chicken roll. The chicken cutlet is awesome too. 
The place is kind of a gariahat landmark and the shopping trips are incomplete without a Campari snack.

Campari is food heaven for all the foodies, especially quintessential Bengalis whose Gariahat shopping spree becomes tiring with a hungry tummy. My first visit here was with my mother on one such Gariahat shopping explorations. While I was bickering about places like Kimli, Hatari to eat at, my mother, on the other hand, suggested Campari, as she spent most of her university days eating from here with her gal pals. 

Campari is a very small yet legendary joint tucked in a small lane at Gariahat. The decor or ambiance is nothing to rave about but, wait till you try out their food. That day I settled for their chicken roll and my mother tucked at a fish roll and we parceled a fish fry, which my mother proudly stated that it was their best. 

The food arrived after 10 minutes. The chicken roll was probably the best I had till date. Infact, whenever I think of chicken roll now, my mind just wanders off to this piece of food at Campari. The chicken roll was adorned with soft succulent pieces of chicken kebab marinated in mild spices with a dash of lemon. It was not too oily. The fish roll was huge in size. The fish was soft and smooth. It tasted heavenly with lemon squeezed on top. Now, lastly, their fish fry was the best I tried. Totally drool worthy. The fish was so soft that it melts right in your mouth. The salad served with it was fresh and fragnant. I had nothing to complain about the food. 

Campari sure saves the college goers with limited food budget all year round from staying hungry post college hours. :)

This was our staple snack destination in my childhood, it's commendable on how they have still maintained the same standards of taste and hygiene.
The best place for a quick bite on the go, I love Campari best for their fish fingers and chicken cutlets. I've also had their chicken roll, which is good albeit slightly too dry. All the food tastes good, service is very fast, food is always fresh and hot. They nail the trick of making the dishes just spicy enough to taste great, and not any more.

I have been savoring the foods of this joint for a long time now perhaps more than a decade. My mother used to be a regular to this outlet during her college days. I was also accompanied by mom to this place for the first time. Shopping at gariahat is a in born tradition for bengalis hence crashing into such a place like Campari serving miuth watering savories is inevitable. This place is one of the oldest in the area. It is quite of a take away joint and doesn't have any sitting arrangements, either you will have to stand and eat or rather take away. The decor doesn't induce any hype either. Its quite a simple layout with few tables for people to stand and eat. They mostly serve kathi rolls, cutlets, kababs, finger fries, etc. I have tried out almost every offerings till date and i have never been dissapointed. Their dishes are very hygenic and contains very less amount of well. The parathas of the roll are very tender and crispy and the best part unlike other fast food centers they don't use dalda to fry foods which is one of the biggest merit of this joint. So as long as Campari is there we can blindly treat our palletes with tantalizing savories without compromising with hygeine.

Campari is a very familiar name with people who is a foodie and who often shop at gariahat. I have personally been here end no of time.

Location - If you are walking toward rash behari from gariahat, Campari fall on your first right hand side lane, which leads to Dover lane as well. (Or you could just ask anybody on the roads of gariahat.)

Description - it's a very small food joint. It is mainly a takeaway joint. Very Clean. Do not expect any lavish or classy food here. It is absolutely a fast food joint. It is a self service joint.

Decor/interior - It has 6 wall tables. Where you can stand and have you food. It is not a place to sit and enjoy your food. 

Ambiance - evening time it is very much crowded. People mostly come here for a takeaway. The only rule of Campari is that it is a pre paid service either it is a takeaway or you stand and eat.

Food ordered - 
1) chicken Kabab
2) mutton Kabab
3) paratha (it is only served with a plate of Kabab)
4) chicken cutlet 
5) cold drink and 
6) pineapple juice (squash)

Food Experience - whatever I had ordered was absolutely mind blowing. So yummy. Paratha with Kabab comes with a little mixed onion and cucumber. Very soft, not spicy at all and neither very oily. Cutlet also comes with a salad and kasundi.
 
Recommendation- Cutlet, roll (chicken, mutton, egg) and kababs with paratha.

Pocket pinch- Very cheap. Now they have raised the price little but still it's quiet affordable.

Bon Appétit !!!!

Since our school days gariahat area is popular for its fast food and rolls....if you are going for shopping @ gariahat and feeling hungry and want some tit-bit ,go to campari ....It s popular for its cutlet ( chicken) and rolls ....the paratha is totally oil free and the meat inside is totally roasted; therefore all you health freak people  this is the appropriate place for you ....enjoy Kolkata roll but without oil....

A great place to stop by while shopping at gariahat or otherwise. Though they don't have a sitting arrangement & is mainly a take-away, Campari is famous for it's persistently good quality food. My all-time favourite remains the fish fry and fish roll. The cutlets are delicious too. The only sad thing is the ever-diminishing size of their food items which is glaring to those who are visiting the place for years.

Even when i am not hungry still i crave to have their cutlets, fish fry and rolls whenever i pass through it. I am in love with their fish fry and not to forget my mum is also a great fan of Campari. I have been eating here since i was small and i must say they have maintained their standard but one thing which made me sad yesterday is the size of their roll ( so small can be renamed as chicken baby roll). I can never complain about the taste or the quality of food but the size was disappointing as my hunger was not satisfied at all. Will keep on gorging on their yummy items till the joint actually closes( which i don't think will ever happen).

I was a frequent customer of this place when I was in school.. this is located in the lane beside Amrita bastralaya near dover lane..a small joint with only tables and no chairs.. you have to stand while you eat and it is a self service place. the food is the main highlight.. their rolls are amazingly tasty whether it is chicken or mutton.. I mostly had their egg mutton roll... the chicken cultet and fish roll were awesome too.. great place to snack on after a day's shopping in Gariahat

Campari has been a part of my growing up. It infact is the only joint near Gariahat from where I can have a chicken roll without thinking about getting sick. The rolls are not oily and they use some kind of tawa paratha, quick is very less on the oil. The fish tandoori roll is all time favorite and so are fish fingers and fish roll. The prices are affordable, perhaps 5-10 rupees more than the offerings at other places around Gariahat, but the quality of the food can sure demand that.

CAMPARI, for the last 5-6 years have been frequenting this place once or twice every week just to eat their fish fries and chicken rolls. But over time the place has changed not only in terms of interiors but also a lot of other things. The prices have been increased at a alarming pace but the quality has not. If asked now if I want to visit this place will defiantly think twice as the charm has been lost wit time.

This food joint is near my house,i.e in gariahat,if u r walking towards rashbehari from gariahat,it falls on the right. I often take away stuffs; if guests suddenly turn up at your place you can easily bring snacks from here,as it is tasty and they won't keep u waiting for too long to deliver.Now coming to the food,i love their chicken cutlet,fish roll and chicken roll.My personal favourite of the three would be the chicken cutlet.Hot and crispy on the outside and,soft and tender on the inside.The rolls are also good,with sufficient chicken filling.The prices are affordable.The only dissapointing thing is that there is no seating arrangements,only a few tables are there for u to stand and eat.I am more of someome who would sit back and enjoy her food.Nonetheless,I would recommend u to visit the place.This year when u are out for puja shopping in Gariahat area,do drop in here...:)

Location: In the left lane right before the gariahat crossing (when moving from Rashbehari to Gariahat). 

Was introduced to this place by my tuition mates and was briefed about this place and it's finger lickin' food! 
It's quite a small eatery at the bylane near gariahat, but is one of the most famous amongst the non-vegetarian foodies just coz' of it's rolls and quick bites to die for. 
There isn't an ambiance as such, just that there are six wall-side tables where you can place you food and eat. 
It serves absolutely delicious rolls and cutlets, specials being their Chicken Cutlet and Chicken Roll (told to me by my non-vegetarian mates). 
However, it's saddening to say that there are just two options available for the vegetarians, priced at just 30 INR each, the Paneer Roll and the Veg Cutlet are opposites when it comes to flavors, but, definitely aren't greasy as other joints. 

Paneer Roll: The roti was made out of all-purpose flour (Maida), was thick, the Paneer cubes were succulent, the roll had a hint of lime and was topped up with onion and ketchup, but, lacked flavors. Was quite bland. Atleast didn't suit my taste buds. 
-Have had better. 

Veg Cutlet: The cutlet was crisp from the outside and had soft flavourful filling inside! 
Served along with mustard sauce and finely sliced cucumber, beetroot, carrot and onions as sides. 
Just became my favorite. :) 

As a non-vegetarian foodie states, we all have atleast one favourite out here; don't worry vegetarian mates, you might end up having a favourite among the two options you have. :-P 
-Atleast I got one, and I feel all vegetarian mates might get the same as a favorite. 

Was an above average experience. 
-Would keep visiting for the vegetable cutlet.

Campari the small but legendary snacks bar off the Dover lane nicely epitomised a true foodies delight. 
The interiors are old fashioned with small suspended tables sticking out of the half mirror walls adding to the charm of the old place. 
The place is filled with aroma of Campari's delicacies when you entered.
I personally always order their chicken rolls and mutton cutlet. 
Their chicken rolls are heavenly with the soft pieces kababs marinated in spices and wrapped up in their softest tandoori parathas I've ever had,That too with hardly any oil.
The dash of lemon with bit chilis just makes it the best chicken rolls ever.

Now the most interesting dish for me were the mutton cutlet without a doubt. It was exquisitely how a typical bengali mutton cutlet look like a huge flat drum stick. Covered by thin and crispy outer coating were huge chucks of soft and chewy mutton filled with distinctly amazing flavour accompanied by mustered sauce and salad. 
Even the place is pocket friendly.. These two orders can come up with around 150...


PS
I love Campari.. :-)

This is the stuff of legends. So why am I giving Campari a lower score? In my opinion, it is overrated. It is a good place. no doubt but it is not a God-level eatery. I find their chicken rolls to be a little dry and not at par with Zeeshan or Shiraz. Their fish fries are, however, quite tasty and interesting. COming to the ambience, I again find this to be a bit small and hot. However, this is my opinion alone. Thousands swear by Campari and you can try this for yourself when you come to this area.

Favorite since childhood days. Whenever we use to go to Gariahat for shopping we always had this stop over for chicken cutlet and katirolls. Food has a unique Bengali taste and touch. Over the years they are serving quality food. Total value for money and you will enjoy if you like deep fried food.

A delightful fast food place tucked away near Gariahat junction. Try their chicken & mutton cutlets, fish fry or the rolls and you will fall in love with this joint. They have standing place only, so best to take away and delve into the delicacies at privacy of your own home. Been eating here since we were wee kids & the only thing that has  changed is the increase in price with inflation and times. The quality though remains the same and we just love the food here. Every time we visit Calcutta, this is the first place we go to eat. Highly recommended.

I have rated this 4 completely based on its food quality. It's basically a very tiny take away joint located very near to garihat more. Well,you can definitely eat there too but you will have to stand there and finish your meal as there are no seats there,only tables are available. They make the best rolls in kolkata and the chicken cutlet is simply amazing followed by their fish roll.

My cousin had introduced me to this place since I am a fan of fish fries. This place is quite small with no place of dining, though one can stand and eat on the few tables they have setup. Coming to the food I tried the basics which was fish fry, fish finger and egg chicken roll. All the items were good, even the quality of fish was good. But I personally felt the dishes could have had slightly more masala cause it tasted bland. That would have acted like a tadka to a dish.

Reviewing Campari was long overdue.

Thanks to two of my friends' sudden urge to window shop earrings in Gariahat, combined with my eternal urge towards fries and cutlets, we decided to take a pit stop at Campari. One Mutton roll, one chicken cutlet and a fish roll with Pepsi, and life was good again.

The roll came quickly, not exactly crisp, but a soft parantha filled with melt-in-your-mouth mutton pieces. The chicken cutlet was brilliant, the spices perfect. The fish roll was the star of the show though, as it often is. Take a piece of this fat baby, a light dip in Kashundi, and feel the stuffing of Betki fish and the spices explode in your mouth. Here comes the salivation.

Campari is value for money. Easy on your pocket, great, great food. Only negative point for me is the lack of seating arrangement, as I'm more of a sit back, relax n enjoy enjoy your food kinda person. But duh, who cares when you get food this good, right?

Chicket Cutlet !!! PERIOD !!!

I used to go to Bani-chakra for art classes in my childhood days, and evening snacks of Chichken cutlet here was my daily fixture.
It was 12 rs when I started eating there 20 years back, Now its 50 rs. Apart from money, nothing has changed. the taste remains same ! Thats the main thing. Service is pretty fast, and it gets over after 7pm on most days due to huge demand.

Service was always good, still it is !!!

Before I begin let me state that taste buds are very subjective indeed. You see we all have preferences of a particular dish made in different styles and there is nothing wrong with one group of people preferring the same dish a certain way while another group liking it when it is prepared in a different style. 

I had braved the crowded streets of Rashbehari Avenue to spot this tiny joint on the right hand side of the road when traveling from Gariahat towards Deshapriya Park. 

It was around 6:30 p.m. and the place was crowded. I ordered one chicken roll and one chicken cutlet on a friend's recommendation and eagerly waited for it since this friend's suggestion led to the discovery of the best biriyani to suit my taste buds in Calcutta. 

A 7 minute wait later I was handed over a brown bag containing my goodies and I immediately took a bite of the chicken roll and my spontaneous reaction was to split it out and here is why, the paraunthe was soft and lacked the flakiness that I prefer for my rolls , the chicken was bland yet had too much of turmeric and it was very chewy. Now there are many people who like their paraunthes which wraps the chicken to be soft and non oily but for me I like mine flaky from outside and soft inside. As far as the chicken is concerned it did lack flavours , I mean I want mine to be well grilled in the open fire tandoor and this was lacking all the spices and the turmeric overpowered the palate. 

I did finish my roll and was pretty disappointed and decided to get rid of that dry taste in my mouth I just had to immediately have the chicken cutlet. Disappointed yet again , well was it not value for money . Here I have to say never have I been so confused. Well it had a huge chunk of meat but then again the taste was dry and lacked all flavours. Now sure , there are many a breadcrumb coated fries in the world which does not use any kind of spice in it not even garlic or ginger) but those usually come with a delightful condiment. This one was bland and even though it had a huge chunk of chicken I wouldn't still recommend it because at the end of the day we are not lions looking for a chunk of meat , we need flavours to appease our taste buds. 

So I have to say I definitely do not recommend this place for rolls or other snacks.

In my opinion, Campari died ingloriously many years back with the death of it's proprietor. Since I was the local boy, there have been many an occasion in my childhood when I went over to Campari with my mother and aunts for a thrilling kathi roll - that then expanded to chicken cutlets and finally the chicken biryani which they started serving from the footpath just in front of their shop. I saw their rise and their decline in front of my eyes....
The kathi rolls were filling and tasty and I rated theirs as one of the best in entire Calcutta. But slowly, the kathi rolls lessened in taste, they became heavy on the stomach and finally used to lead to indigestion if I may say so. So I stopped the rolls. Their biryani, even if one called it unhygienic since they used to sell it fro the footpath during afternoons (the main shop opened only in the evening), was simply brilliant and I don't have any doubts that it was better than any of the popular Mughlai joints like Shiraz and Arsalan - it was that good. But slowly the quantity of chicken kept reducing, the oil reduced and it became dry, and it reached the stage of an average biryani - and I stopped that too.
I can't write it's obituary since Campari still retains its share of customers. However, here's to the good old times which Campari served us up time after time. It is an era gone by...

Unexpected rain today afternoon made me visit this place again :P (Just needed an excuse to go) :D


*Location - It is located at Rashbihari Avenue. A 5-6 minutes walk from Garihat more towards Rashbihari More it comes to your right.


*Brief - Decided to try their Chicken Cutlet as it had rained heavily and the weather became icy cool :P


*Decor/Ambience - Very well maintained. Though pretty small but still they have wall-tables for having the food :) Mostly people choose the take-away option.


*Things ordered - 
#Chicken Cutlet.
They have prepaid sytem. The cutlet was awesome and was served with bit salad and kasundi. It was steaming hot and tasted exclusive. The kasundi(original) complements the cutlets significantly :P
I just love visiting to taste their hot cutlets and rolls. I was feeling hungry for rolls today as well but then decided to keep it up for later. :P

*Purse Check - Very Pocket friendly. Chicken cutlet costs just Rs.50/- which is delightful :)

*Overall - Always a nice experience their with the quick service and charming people handling the shop. 
Always recommended :)

Having my college nearby makes me visit Dover lane often. Campari is just GoD of chicken rolls and kababs !!!

Campari is one of the very old fast food outlets on the Rashbehari Av. Their food has been discussed and praised over years and their rolls in specialty are simply legendary. Whether it is mutton chicken or fish, the rolls are amazing. My best vote goes to the tandoori fish roll and I haven’t found a replica of this elsewhere in the city. The Fish Fry comes a close second. The paratha in which the rolls are wrapped is somewhat special and doesn’t taste like the average rolls we get in Kolkata.  The fish fry is made with a lightly coating and not very oily or heavy on the stomach. I sure would love to go to Campari every time I am in the area. Other snack items available on the menu are also quite delectable.

Was here twice.LAst week when i visited, ordered my favourite fish fry and chicken cutlet it was good enough.
But when i visited here an year ago had found a hair in the fish fry. When complained,they made fun of it,but did not change(just a single bite was taken). The cucumber in the salads were rotten,but din complain as i don't prefer cucumber so threw it away. good ambiance just wanted to sit n eat. Who pays 75 for chicken roll? there are other shops around it which provides delicacies of similar quality at lesser prices!
DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW, I PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT.

I was out with S today, walking around Gariahat, and craving a good chicken roll. We stumbled inside Campari after a bit of a walk, and I wanted the chicken cutlet and the chicken roll. The cutlet was to be packed, and the roll was to be consumed immediately, extra chillies please.

The two items cost me 95/- and within 4-5 minutes, my order was ready. The roll was perfect - the paratha was crisp on the outside and soft inside and I loved the fact that it was not greasy at all (that's a specialty of the rolls in Campari - I have never had a greasy roll here. Ever.). Inside, there were chunks of tender chicken and a lot of chillies, a hint of lime and a bit of onions - just enough to add to the zing, but not overwhelming - perfection indeed!

The chicken cutlet was a thick fillet of chicken breast, seasoned perfectly, and deep fried. Even though it was deep fried, it was, again, not greasy at all! It came with a light salad of onions and cucumbers, and a single green chilli. I savored every bit of it and marveled at the lightness of my being, and couldn't help but give it full marks!

Campari is not an elaborate affair, certainly not for dining out with family and friends. What it offers is good food, fast services and at affordable prices, to have on the go. There is no seating arrangement. But I have never heard of one bad review of this place from anyone. It serves the best fish roll and fish fry, and the chicken roll here is to die for. A must try for all food lovers. This little stall is located at a convenient location near Gariahat, easy to locate.

This place is legendary and I can't believe I overlooked writing a review for it !!!! The fan following of this place is huge and almost every foodie I know has a favorite food item that they want to indulge in at Campari. First off the vegetarians should beware because they don't have too many options except a Paneer Roll or Vegetable Cutlet however its heavenly for all us non-vegetarian foodies.The Chicken Roll is extremely popular and most people love the soft parathas made here , the flavour of the kebab is pretty good too. However I love the Fish Fry and Chicken Cutlet both of which are yummy. Makes for a perfect evening snack and they sell like hotcakes on a cold day. Open only in the evenings make sure you reach early to avoid the disappointment of being told that your preferred dish is sold out. The best way for me to describe Campari is that its a preferred snack shop with mouth watering memories.

We just went there suddenly on a cold chilly evening. The place is nice and cozy and a great option for a fast food and roll center. U dnt have to stand on the road and have your food, and that is why I loved this place.
They have an option for instant espresso and tea which rarely any shops have in kolkata.
We ordered a chicken cutlet which was very stiff since the outer coating was a bit hard. we also had a fish cutlet which was perfect to my opinion. You won't feel uneasy after having the whole of it. :)
And since am like a superfoodie and really hungry, i had a egg chicken roll. The specialty of the roll is that they don't make it with acche paratha, and the paratha is thus really very soft and juicy. the kabab inside tastes wonderful and they give it in plenty.
for me, its an awesum place to visit whenever i go to gariahat :)

There are the never-ending budget constraints of a jobless college student, and then, there are places like Campari which save our gluttonous souls, with its amazing food at pocket friendly prices!

On a sudden rainy day, we were just in the mood for some Bengali (not traditional though) snacks and "adda" (leisurely chat) and we chose Campari over many other places to happily become their first two diners for the evening.
This small but legendary snack bar off the Dover Lane nicely epitomizes a true foodie's (I'd rather use the term BHOJONROSHIK!) delight. The getup inside is old fashioned, with small suspended tables sticking out of the half mirrored walls adding to the charm of this olden place. 
As the doors opened a few minutes before four in the evening, the tiny place was filled up with the tantalizing aroma of the freshly fried delicacies and people (mostly shoppers) started pouring in.

We settled for a Chicken Roll, a Mutton Cutlet and two cups of tea. No sooner than we'd ordered, our food arrived, making my ravenous tummy grin in contentment. The Chicken Roll was heavenly with the soft pieces of chicken kebab, marinated in mild spices and wrapped up in the softest tandoori paratha I've ever had, that too with hardly any oil. A dash of lemon 
with a bite off the green chilli just heightened its impeccable taste.
Now, the more interesting dish for me was the Mutton Cutlet without a doubt. It was exquisitely how a typical Bengali's mutton cutlet should look like (a huge, flat drumstick). Somehow, it brought back fond childhood memories of Bengali comic strips by Narayan Debnath, where an illustration of mutton cutlet had the exact same look. Looks apart, the taste was purely divine. Covered by a thin and crispy outer coating were huge chunks of soft and chewy mutton filled with  distinctly amazing flavours. It was beautifully complemented by the mustard sauce and cucumber, onion salad. 

When the above two dishes were accompanied by a cup of hot, elaichi flavoured, frothy milk tea, we had everything then, to declare it a perfect evening. Finally, that was sealed with a bill of 102 rupees only, and a polite smile from the cashier!

One small complaint; at a point of time, the stand and eat policy really becomes a pain in the leg. Adding a few stools or chairs would be of real help.
Overall, this place is a must visit for all those foodies who're still unknown to the wonders of Campari. 

P.S.: I would highly recommend the mutton cutlet if you're a lover of the red meat!

For a fast snack that is moderately priced and tastes absolutely great this is the place. The chicken cutlet has been my all time favorite. The best thing about the cutlets here is that they are stuffed fully with chicken or mutton or whatever you order. Quality wise campari is absolutely top class. I still remember those days when me and my friends used to walk for 20 minutes from school to come here. Don't expect to sit and gossip here though, because it has no seating place. There are small tables where you can keep your food and eat it while standing tall:P.

Its the taste of good old Calcutta! Chop cutlet and roll at its very best! I have been going to this place forever (actually about 25 years) and its always lived up to its standards. Nestled in a garage off Rashbehari Avenue near Gariahat crossing, this is all what Calcutta food stands for. A very limited menu of snacks items are available but they taste heavenly. There is no oiliness about the fried items. The porotas used for the rolls are delightfully soft and tasty. I suggest that one should have everything they have to offer. If I had to make a priority list it would be as follows:

1. Chicken cutlet
2. Fish tandoori roll
3. Fish roll
4. Mutton cutlet
5. Fish fry
6. Others..

Don't forget that the place is open for only a short period of time in the evening. Most of the good stuff often gets over by 8pm.

Campari is a small fast food joint located near Gariahat. The joint deals with rolls, cutlets, kebabs etc. It is mainly an attraction for non-vegetarians but veg cutlet and paneer roll are the only veg items available here. Fish and mutton items are well present apart from usual chicken stuff.

Anything you see in the menu is will be great in taste, chicken kebabs, chicken roll, mutton roll are yummy. Cutlets are the most recommended by anyone who knows of Campari. Fish items such as Tandoori Fish Roll and Fish Fry are also recommended. The store also has option of fruit juices, soft drinks and tea/coffee. The food is quite hygienic and doesn't seem to be oily. Prices may be higher than usual roadside stalls making the same stuff but the quality of food cannot be compared with them.

The place where the joint stands for decades is very small and is ever crowded. The service is however descent and crowd management is good from their side. There is no sitting arrangement however, so it is recommended to go for a takeaway rather than having food there itself.

Update: Fish Fry is not really good, tried it out lately only to find that they are very hard to chew and mostly tasteless. Normally they would give kasundi (mustard sauce) along with it however in my case, they forgot :-(

Fish tandoor roll, fish fry and chicken cutlet are my most favourite, very tasty and really good. Very small crammed place, but who cares, food is god after all. Oh, I really missed their best and worst, best is mustard which they provide as accompaniment with fries and cutlets and worst is the newly introduced homemade drinks (juices). A long time favourite.

Although recently introduced to this place, I have become simply obsessed with their Mutton Breast Cutlet. The cutlet is stuffed with a solid mutton piece, something that we rarely find today! It is perfectly fried and hot and a complete delight. In fact everytime I go anywhere near Gariahat, i make it a point to make a stopover at Campari!. It does not have a seating arrangement and there are just counter-like tables where you can stand and eat your food...but that is the special old-world charm of this place!The chicken roll, with yum kabab fillings is also highly recommended!....My only complaint.....why dint I discover this place before!!

I have been visiting this place for three decades. Been there many a times when the founder (Ashok da i guess) used to be there. I remember seeing him look into every details of the business those days when he was there. One of the first food joints of South Kolkata where a queue of customers could be seen. I remember the fish fries and rolls finishing off before 8 in the evening in those days as well. Have actually seen my elder brothers rushing from office to campari lest their favorite items would be finished. 
Visited this place some time back and found the place to be crowded yet again. Loved to see Late Ashok da's wife in the counter. Paid my respects as i bought 4 spl. chicken rolls for me and my family.  The rolls were delicious as usual. Felt great too for i just visited a "land mark " of south kolkata.
My score -5/5 ................... just for being there , Thank You.
The fact that they still run out of food by 8 pm says the rest !

One thing I keep referring to in many of my reviews is memories and same applies here..At one time when I was a kid my parents used to point out "son there will be people who just to hold on to customers with keeping the prices low, they will fail in the long run like band box, while the ones who hold on to quality will have a niche market but will never loose that market like Campari". I guess being from business backgrounds they knew it too well. During that time Campari used to charge nearly double of regular roll joint prices but the pieces, the freshness, the quality, the taste was superb....Today many roll joints have come up and many famous ones but then you must stop by before going to Gariahat or while coming back to eat food at campari...
It used to have a board of chicken on top of it. 
I went maybe a year back and even then there was no seating I do not know now...The size is still the same, you stand and eat but the rolls especially the fish roll, the cutlets and the tandoori fish rolls are superb and they are still pricey but there is the same reason for having survived it so long...No compromise on quality....
I have not had food recently but I guess you can trust Campari to provide you with the best, always....

Decent fast food at Campari
3 out of 5 

I have visited Campari many times and they haven't changed their quality and quantity over the years. For me, Campari is a place with a lot of nostalgia. Situated on Rashbehari Avenue, Campari is a little food joint with very little dine-in space that serves really tasty food. Though there is nothing catchy about its ambience and it has very little space to accommodate diners, this eating hub remains overcrowded with diners every day. By very little dine-in space, I mean a few plastic stools and chairs to sit on with no tables (hence the lower rating)!

Apart from locals, shopaholic Gariahat hoppers die to get a bite of the rolls or cutlets served here. The magic of their Spl. Chicken or Mutton Rolls will have you ordering another. Chicken pieces mixed with various spices and lemon juice to bring out a heavenly taste - if you like roadside food, you will enjoy their rolls. Moreover, their paranthas are prepared very nicely without the use of excessive oil. There is a lady at the cash counter who always smiles at you. The rates are very moderate compared to the awesome taste. Their Chicken cutlet and Fish fry are also good.  

Do visit Campari but remember to be there by 8 PM because after that they start running out of food due to high demand.

Pricing is reasonable and food is just exceptional. Chicken,fish cutlets and fries are really very delicious. There is no sitting arrangement. There we have to stand and eat food.

Nostalgia, quality and pricing would make me give this place a perfect 5. Would have been better if they could expand upon the space and the timing with time. However, whenever we think of foul cutlet, fish fry or even rolls, Campari comes to out mind first. Over the years they have maintained the quality and also the size of the items. I am confident you shall love this place for the food and the pricing, unless of course, you are very particular about ambiance.

Perfect place to serve your taste buds with delicious cutlets.The piping hot cutlets served here are surely one of the best in Calcutta.The one problem is,there is no arrangement for sitting,and keeping in mind the huge number of customers they serve at a time,its quite tough to stand and down your food.The rolls served here also draw a large number of takers,specially the ones returning after their shopping..Though there is a derth of space here,the Food quality is great.

I used to frequent Campari with my parents when I was a kid and I am talking about thirty years back. Our favorites were the chiken/mutton rolls and expresso coffee. The original owner was an old time pal of my father. I left India when it was still called Calcutta and came back after the city was "Bangla"cized.
I just happened to pass by campari @ Rashbihari avenue when a mere glance at the joint took me back three decades into the past. I couldn't help but indulge myself with my old favourites and found the roll taste exactly the same as it used to be. Just astonishing! Wish Campari a lot more appetizing years of serving original Calcatian delectables.

I have been there twice. The best road side rolls and fries are served here. If you are marketting at Gariahat or watching a movie at Priya, you should definitely try here. Better than many famous restaurants. A road side shop, yet hygienic, non-oily, affordable for all. 

If you are fond of Fish items then try Fish fry or Fish cutlet, for chicken lovers, chicken cutlet and special fish rolls. Taste at its best Campari.

For all it's erstwhile glory, the rolls of Campari have gone down drastically! Not at all worth going back in a long time, I guess...

I visit there several times just for its cutlets and especially rolls. A small outlet and it is not having any proper ambiance. There a lady keeps on billing and other staffs keep on making foods. Pricing is reasonable and food is just exceptional. Chicken,fish cutlets and fries are really very delicious. There is no sitting arrangement. There we have to stand and eat food. It is always filled with people and wrappers of rolls all around cause the roll is sold in a huge amount every day. Sometimes after shopping in gariahat and places near rashbehari Avenue I have roll here. Guys,you must visit there place to be get captivated and concentrate in the eating of rools and cutlets. It deserves 5 stars.

Whenever I think about Rolls and cutlet, the first thing that comes to my mind is Campari. A small roadside shop in Rash behari avenue , dover lane crossing. The shop does not have any sitting area , it only has some stand in counters and a order/delivery desk. Looking at it one might think of a pretty ordinary place, however the food does not. The Rolls the cutlets are extraordinary.  Apart from chicken and mutton rolls, their speciality is the fish tandoori rolls which I guess they were the first to serve.  I have grown up having the rolls and it has become a healthy part of my food chart. Its not very heavy on pocket. Definitely highly recommended.

Campari near Gariahat is a laid back, traditional "roll-cutlet" joint that Bengalis love. It's cutlets (chicken, mutton, vegetarian) are famous, and so are the rolls especially the egg-chicken rolls and the double rolls. The fruit juices are also quite nice, or you can settle for soft drinks, or tea/coffee. For as little as INR 300, you will be treated to a heavy snack (or a light dinner) for four. You can also buy semi-processed food for cooking at home. But, no credit/debit cards or food passes are accepted. It is strictly "pay in cash."

Drawbacks - if any? Yes, you have to stand and eat, and space is a constraint. Ideal time to vist Campari is between 4:30pm IST to 7:30pm IST. Yes, they have a limited stock and be it kebabs-paranthas or cutlets - the stock is limited. 

If you want to reach Campari - get down at Gariahat crossing, walk towards Triangular Park, it will be on the first left turn (landmark - Amrita Bastralaya after Standard Chartered bank), just beside an Archies Store. Bon Appetit!

i have been eating at Campari since the time i lived in Dover Lane 1986-89. those days uncle was alive. the food is simply amazing - the kolkatta rolls experience is only complete once you have eaten at Campari. the rolls are non-oily, made of delicious chunks of meat and fabulously flavoured with onion. the fish rolls and fish chops are simply out of this world. this restaurant continues a long tradition of excellence. should be a five star rating and i whole heartedly recommend it.

Thanks a lot to you, Mr.Editor for keeping my request. You at last added Campari in your esteemed site. I am eating Chicken Rolls, Chicken Cutlets and Fish Fingers since nearly 20 years back. The thing that matters ultimately is the taste and the taste of the foods available here is truly awesome, at least according to my taste buds. Not at all oily yet tasty. Crews are friendly. Hardly any change has taken place in terms with taste and quality.



----- 17 Sep, 2010 -----

I don't how this very restaurant got a single star from the editor! Anyways, if anybody wish to savour truly delicious foods, just visit Campari once and then decide. The quality is so good, clean and not at all heavy on your stomach. Yes, I agree you have to eat there standing because they made that restaurant out of a garage but the taste of the foods only matter, nothing else! I have been eating there for twenty years. I live in north Calcutta but often I try to find an excuse to visit the place! I am addicted to the brilliant taste but not biased.

One of the best place for fish fry and rolls in India.  Simply awesum. Cant call it a proper restuarant though , more of a take away. Wish could be in Kolkata to savour such food.
