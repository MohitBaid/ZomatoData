This place has been my all time favourite joint for a quick bite when hungry. Be it north-Indian or south, the food is awesome. My personal favourite is the Pav Bhaji and Cold Coffee with Ice-cream. The decor can be improved a bit.

This is located on the main road from Taratala towards New Alipore. Went to Taratala for some work, felt hungry, saw this outlet and went in. They serve only Vegetarian Food. We ordered BUTTER MASALA DOSA and CHOLA BATORA. Chola Batora was good in taste(not bad). Dosa was too good and too yummy. They are specialists in South-Indian food. They have a lot of varieties of Dosa. South-Indian food lovers should visit this place. Well behaved staff. Their coffee is also very good. Had it earlier.

This is an age old eatery known for their delicious dosas. They only serve vegetarian food. I'm not really a big fan of South Indian food but their dosas are really good. Also the paprichat they serve with chilled curd definitely helps you to beat the heat. Major drawback is the chowmein which is absolutely not up to the mark. Most of the veggies were undercooked and it's too bland to have without any side dish. The chowmein also didn't have any salt or pepper. It was odd to see that they didn't keep any salt and pepper on the tableüòÆ. I was a bit apprehensive about their sandwiches thinking I might find undercooked veggies in it too. Again the pav bhaji was okayish. 
Overall verdict : will visit again only for the dosa and paprichat.

Okay,, so this visit was seriously unplanned.. Was here today for an exam.. I found this place while searching for food and went inside after which i got to know it is a vegetarian eatery and specialist in south indian foods.. I got no affection for south Indian food thus ordered vegetarian noodles.. The cabbages and capsicums were almost uncooked.. Taste was okayish.. Okay enough to fill my hungry stomach.. Service was poor.. The AC was off and after sometime I was feeling suffocated inside.. Could not understand the language of the people there as they were all speaking in some south indian language.

Really liked the Sada dosa, Masala dosa,Cheese Sada Dosa, Cheese Masala Dosa . Apart from that Papri Chat  & Mixed Chat. Quality of the food is good & price is also reasonable. Must visit if you are a Dosa lover.

This small age old vegeterian eatery lies opposite to the New Alipore petrol pump and just a short walk from Taratala crossing. Nice place for evening snacks or a quick dinner and popular among people of all age groups. Have visited few times with family. The place is warmly lit, the layout n decor very basic and kept neat n tidy (do not try a sneak peek into their kitchen though...it's dirty n unkept). Roti-sabzi, chole-bature, pav-bhaji, idly-vada-sambar, moong-dal dosa, fresh fruit juices are some of the items that I like here. Rest is pretty much average. Price wise a bit on the higher side.

A vegetarian restaurant, famed for its dosas and North Indian snacks, this place isn't a standalone outlet in the alipur area as it gets competition from Super Snacks Bar. Still it is always crowded.

This is a popular South Indian eatery located in a busy area of New Alipore near TIME coaching center. I've been there a few times and loved their dosas and idlis. They also serve North Indian, which is a good alternative to regulars. On one of the occasions I was returning home really late on a rainy night when Krishna Snacks Bar turned out to be the saviour, serving me delightful dosa in a deserted restaurant about to close. They usually take time to present the orders on the table, but I cannot complain about the great quality of food they serve, easily making them one of the best South Indian restaurants in town.

This place can easily be located in the new alipore area opposite of Tiwari brothers.
It is one of the oldest in the area and kind of a "come-eat-go" kinda place. Nothing abt ambiance or taste of food either.

#Food: I have been there few times. They serve nearly all kinds- chinese, south indian, north indian dishes etc. You will also get snacks, juices & shakes. Its like an one place destination for anything you wanna eat. The quality of food is good & very much reliable.
But the taste is much normal & odinary. Dnt expect much of taste.

#Price: Coming to the cost, the price is high there in accordance with the taste of food or quality of items. Specially for some specific items the price is just too much.

This old eatery caught my interest when I badly craved South Indian food at home. Located just opposite the New Alipore A Block Petrol pump, this can be called the equivalent to the renowned SSB, but not quite. I ordered food at home and the manager asked the bill to be a minimum amount of 500 rupees. Okay, not too shabby there. However, there are other home delivery eateries, farther away from Krishna which do not have such demands and still provide free home delivery. The food was excellent. Fresh steamed idlis with the ever delicious coconut chutney and hot sambhar, a plate of mouth watering cheese dosa alongside a plate of spicy onion uthappam was more than enough to put my hunger at rest. The delivery man was courteous and the food came in, unspoiled and warm still. The delivery however took more than an hour and a half to arrive even though the restaurant is barely 20 minutes away from Parnasree.
The bill amounted to a total of 534 rupees however the taxes levied made it a total of 700 rupees instead. A little too much for some idlis and dosas I must say. I shall come here for a full dining experience soon to know more.

But the reason why you should visit the place, is to have a sip of their piping hot glass of masala chai. I really feel like it has magical powers to elevate you to transcendence.

Best place for Dosa and uttapam in this part of the city. As some of you may recall the fact that Drive Inn and Garden Cafe prices are sky rocketing they by day, and it has reached a point where prices are seldom justified.

Nonetheless coming to the food quality. Last week my dad packed a Dosa and my favorite Sada Vada, which was nice and crispy to have. 
I must complain about the quality of chutney they provide. It was definitely not fresh and I think it was stale too.

Other than that the food was OK.

Ordered food for home delivery. This is not the first time we eating here.. Food is good to eat not that great but yes stomach filling..
~ Dosa is good to eat crispy & length is good too.. Either it be Onion Dosa, Masala Dosa, plain dosa
~ idly - small in size not hot
~ vada - full of oil n small n thin in shape.
Sambar not hot n no taste. Chatni average..
This is for the first time that they have served such an oilly package of food delivery.. Service poor.

Located oppposite Tewari at new alipore. Ordered food a number of times from this small snacks restaurant.
1. South indian : loved the quantity and the taste. The price is also reasonable.
2. North indian : chola bhatura was on the oily side. Average.
3. Noodles : below average.
4. Paw bhaji : good
Overall it is an average restaurant providing limited options. Considering lack of restaurants in new alipore, this place serves good.

This food joint was a place where me and my college buddies used to go during our college days. Even being a 100% vegetarian snacks bar, this place serves pretty good and tasty food, and that's too at a reasonable price. The ambience is very average though, and the service staffs are a bit lethargic in their attitude, but overall, its an okay place to have some quick bites.

OK, this place has a special space in my life n memory, so I may be a tad bit biased towards it. I have taken my wife to this place for countless number of times for an evening date.
The remarkable thing about this place its location, newalipore-taratala crossing on the main road.
Next is, its simple yet charming decor and extremely courteous staff. The glassed wall gives a nice bistro type of feeling if one can grab the glass side tables.
The only downside (for carnivores like me) of it being purely vegetarian restaurant, yet the food they serve rather used to serve made up for it. Yes ,off late the taste of the food has been in decline.
My favourites were various chats, aloo paratha,pao bhaji, chole batore, south Indian vada etc. My wife used to like their dosa also.
Perfect for couples, ppl on low budget n ample time to spend together. For vegetarians there is better option with tiwari Bros n Gupta Bros being near than this one.

It used to be a great place to have South Indian and North Indian food but over the time the quality of the food has deteriorated. Still, they offer a variety of Dhosa and Uttapam which is unmatched in the locality. Besides the Dhosa, one can have the Chole Batura and Chats which are really popular among the customers.

This is a small joint and I have visited this place a couple of times for the evening snacks.

At times I find it a bit difficult to grab a seat in this place. All veg menu and from the menu list, I have tried the masala dosa, Paw Bahji, chana batura, Veg sandwich, veg chowmin and lassi.

All the items were good, however I did not like the lassi. The chana batura was too heavy and paw bhaiji is OK sort of

A very average south indian snacks bar serving over-priced dosas( compared to the quality) . Even the lassis and parathas served here are just ok-ok. Nothing special in any dish actually. The dosas are average with a decent chutney and sambhar. The place is a little over-hyped in the local area but after eating i seriously felt that there was nothing to write about actually. So to sum up, a decent place with average food.

If you want to relax outside ur house in this sultry weather , wanna talk your heart out wit ur partner and can spend 100-150 bucks , this restaurant can b one of ur options. Food here is not extraordinary bt tastes good , not highly priced Bt once ur food is over , you will feel that you must leave as their are others who are anxiously waiting for you to get up as the restaurant is not that big as it looks from outside. The service provided by the waiter is really not satisfactory. As music is not played here , talking in a low tone is the only choice if you want to stay away from the unwanted looks ur neighbours might give after listening to ur personal stuffs.

In short - If u can't afford CCD or big cafes or lounges , this restaurant can b a temporary substitute in terms of ur budget.

With such a location, this place could have been a cool hangout place..but alas! They couldn't realise their potential. With a very minimalistic decor and a very feeble ac and very untrained staffs, this place is not really a value for money. With lassi and cold coffee priced at 60, u probably would be left wondering, what have they done since u came to deserve so much of ur money. The sandwich is served with oily local chips and tastes okay. The dosas are better, be it cheese or masala or onion or ghee. They have quite a variety of it. Its a typical south Indian eatery so it wud be best if u can abstain from ordering anything on the menu dat is exactly not south Indian. Has immense scope of improvement.

It's situated in New Alipore nearby Tiwari sweets and Raymond's showroom. It's a small place around 30 seating and very very ordinary ambience. The owner should look into this and try to improve the decor. 

Now comes the food part. South Indian (Dosa & Idli ) was good but other North Indian and Chinese items were average. Not very up to the mark. Rates are also not very cheap. So if you are charging this kind of rates the quality & ambience should be more taken care of.

Its a veg dine in.Dosas are the best thing on their menu be it masala,sada,pepper ,onion etc followed by uttapam and plain vada...dahi vada is a great let down and would suggest not to have it...the curd was very thin and the chutney seemed like a sauce ...you can always try their cold coffee with chocolate...its delicious

good place for veggans...not a veg food fan at all but visited there quite a few tines with friends to spend time and escape from the scorching heat. reasonable price, portions served are good. the food are served hot as well, but the stuff behaviour-not at all good.
the dosas and chowmein are good, but the polao-please avoid if you are a little health conscious.

This restaurant is located in new alipore on the way towards taratala. They sell completely vegetarian dishes ranging from south Indian, north Indian and Chinese. It is moderately spacious and has a simple and plain interiors without any fancy decor. The sitting arrangements are taken care by 7-8 tables(approx) but it sometimes it turns out to be insufficient during the peak hours. Their south Indian menu is quite extensive offering various varieties of dosas(plain, masla,butter,cheese, ghee, rawa) idlis(butter,rawa), vadas, utthapam etc. The samber and chutneys served along the south Indian dishes are really succumbing. The north Indian department is comprised of- pav bhaji, chana batura, chaats, tikias, pulao, roti, paneer curries, daal etc; which are also quite sound in taste and quality. Chowmeins, fried rice etc are served as a part of Chinese cuisines and these are also worth praising. Other quick bites offerings like sandwiches, juices, sodas, ice creams are also available in this snacks bar. The quantity of their offerings are also sufficiently abundant and the prices are reasonable to. The only loop hole is the slack and reluctant service of the waiters, otherwise everything regarding this outlet is quite smooth and perfect. A good place to have an enjoyable veg meal in a decent pocket pinch.

A pretty old restaurant located opposite tewari sweets near taratala in new alipore. It serves south indian, north indian chaats, chinese etc but i would suggest anyone to go for the south food which is good whereas others are pretty average and could be skipped. The service is ok. I would prefer a better and more comfortable seating arrangement otherwise, the place is worth a takeaway. Prices are reasonable.

The south indian food is their best offering and i must admit, it is quite nice. The chutney and sambhar are very good. Idly, vada, dosas are all served hot and fresh and i love their taste. They have a number of fresh fruit juices to offer which is a good thing and works big time for me.  

The south indian food with their fresh fruit juice is worth the money and rest of the menu is a skip for me !!!

Krishna Snacks Bar or KSB has been a respite for college students staying in d vicinity (IHM, Marine college) for years now.... i am surprised by the steep hike in the prices. It is one of those no frills kinda place which used to be pocket friendly and served decent food.  and if you  are a regular, the service staff is extra nice, not that dey r bad to new customers. :)     ofcourse u cant compare it with a fine dine restaurant but in its own league i would rate KSB 5/5...

truly to say their batter they use is a little sour....is evident in the uttapams...so i wouldnt advice that...
paper dosa is really thin they r as good as RAJ's....
But i would really prefer you try the pav bhaji...here they r the bast they cant ever get...better than tose made in panjab.....
u really need to try it to believe it....
Dont forget t order special chatni with your south indian dishes
