Been at this place 3 times. Its situated at a place where you would not expect a Bar to be. 2-3 mins from Ajoynagar Bus Stop but in a residential area. Small but comfortable sitting arrangement and Dimly lit. Its alchohol is very cheap and thats 1 reason why people tend to visit. The food quality is not upto the mark. Another thing is this place allows you to have a smoke while having your drink. Not a bad place, you can go for its cheap alchohol and average food. Good for your pocket.

I won't refer this place to good food lovers.
Usually I go to this place as it's the cheapest bar near to me and when I'm tired after office works.
I visited here many times.
I order beer and red pepper chicken dry or fried chicken.
These two are okay.
Don't order any fish dishes. It will surely disappoint you.
Staffs are good.
I have a good rapport with the owner also.
He is a very good guy.

Pretty much pocket friendly. It is the usual place for my boys group.
U ll get everything at comparatively lesser price so don't expect a high quality food.
And you might wanna avoid this place when a girl is included.

This is a good place for casual hang out. One of my favorite place to hang out. The cost is cheaper. Ambience is good. Quality of food is good. If you want a pocket friendly place to chill, this is the perfect   place.

Went to this place with friends the place is little gloomy and lights are dim. I liked the food which we ordered with the beer. Chilli chicken tikka and bhetki fry was worth the price.

Its a bar for people who wants to enjoy their drinks at pocket friendly price
Located in a small lane in ajaynagar this place is always filled with groups as the prices are not high and you can see  students  enjoying there drinks 
Waiters are young boys who are not trained enough but still they manage to provide you good service 
They have a big menu but haven't ordered much from the food item except for few chicken and veg starters and salad which was good all the time 
They allow you to smoke inside the bar so people who like to have their smoke with their drink will find this  place ideal
An ok place for people who don't want to drink at a pub or expensive restaurant

Location - Just 1 minute walk from Ajaynagar em bypass connector
ambience - nothing to mention as such
Cost - Cheaper than many other hi-fi places
Food quality - okeyish
Smoking inside - YES

Tried egg bhurji, tengri kebab and mixed gravy noodles. Egg bhurji was ok but the tengri kebab was not grilled rather a fried chicken. The noodles was nice and in ample quantity.

Recommended for cheap boozing with friends,not recommended for family.

Sonar Sansar is nothing extraordinary if you think of its ambience. 
But why I rate this place so high is because their food is very tasty and liquor is unbelievably cheap. If you're looking for a pocket friendly food joint to spend sometime with friends, it is a must.
Another significant point. It might be a good one or bad one but to my knowledge, it is the only place where smoking is allowed indoors and one can enjoy drinks while smoking

I used to visit this place with friends while staying at garia. Their ambiance,service everything is very ordinary. But the liquors are really pocket frinedly here...and the staffs are helpful. So being a college student..we used to hang out here a lot. We never tried any food items...so I can't comment how they are. But the drinks are cheap..and that's all it mattered fr us.

Ok I didn't like it at all... the ambiance is deteriorating day by day... nothing to say about deco... food quality is very ordinary... also they don't have any idea about cocktails and mocktails... Staffs are totally untrained and clueless... 
Allover it's a very bad experience... only suitable for regular drinkers who guys dosent care about anything except liquors...
Obviously it's the pocket friendly option available in the locality...
