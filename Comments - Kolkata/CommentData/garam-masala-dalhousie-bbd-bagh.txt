Being a newbie at the heart of the city, it a good place   to quickly feed your hunger and head on to your destination. It serves good food, offers a good variety of dishes on the menu the place is neat and clean. Recommended: Food items offered in thali system needs to be improved with some special dishes, and do update the food menu shown in this zomato app.

This place is a new entry to the dalhousie office area, has ample AC seating and is low on pockets, have tried their snacks which was okies, didnt find it intresting. On another visit tried chinnese from here, fried rice is decent, non spicy but a bit greecy. Loved the crispy chillli potato that was served. Just what this area needeed a pure vegetarian place for lunch.
