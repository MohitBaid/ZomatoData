Kochuri chholar daal of this legendary place is an addiction which is very hard to resist. No other sweet shop can ever be able to make kochuri chholar daal like them . they charge Rs 12 for 2 kochuris and is an accessible eatery for quick breakfast . I have come here several times since my college days. Located opposite to bhawanipur police thana , and at a walking distance from jatin das park. If you are ever in Kolkata don't give this place a miss.

A signature place in Kolkata serving Lyangcha and Kachuri and thus a must visit for all. The place is always filled with people asking for their dishes. The Kachuri was a bit heavy in terms of evening snacks along with the Lyangcha which was adjusting itself in the plate. Overall a good old eatery which will very much meet up everyone's expectations...‚ò∫

Dont let the outer appearance of this place fool you. They serve one of the best Kachori and Dal I have ever tried. The lyangcha is heavenly. Not really a very up-to-the-mark place lookwise, but staff is nice and service ia prompt.

---------------

I have been eating their Kachuri for a long time, long before they rebuilt the interior. Although there are many people who have been a regular customer in this shop since long and much elder than me, to maintaining the taste of the food throughout the time is difficult.

People who are health conscious, possibly will not like to visit this place; but I would just like to highlight that, we have never been ill after consuming the food in this shop (Although I am not trying to prove that the food is very hygienic). Although, we might not get the kind of "service" we expect in other "restaurants", I have always found the servers handy. In case they miss you during a rush hour, if you raise your hand you will be promptly served.

There are several other places which also serve excellent Kachuri, like Sharma, besides Asutosh College, and a few shops near Deshopryio Park and yet another Kachuri shop behind the Cancer Hospital, etc.. Although their taste and styles are different.

This is a regular shop, I will be back to this place.

Since college I was a regular to this place. Even now whenever I visit KOLKATA I do not lose a chance to drop by this place and the staple favourite is kochuri and cholar dal. Sheer ecstasy to the taste buds. Located near Asutosh college these are the places that still reminds us ‚ÄúCalcutta lives on in Kolkata‚Äù

Dont judge a book by it's cover. This place is very unhygenic but dont go by the looks. The shop is just the opposite of Bhowanipore P.S. its a heritage. One of the best. Serves kachori and cholar dal. The lyancha and misti doi is a must try here. There are 2 separate sections for ladies and  bachelors which is a disadvantage and they dont allow bachelors to enter the ladies section even if the section is empty. Needs to improve a lot with its hygiene. Otherwise the food is good.

Probably the best Dal Puri and Lyangcha served in Kolkata!

One of the oldest sweet shop in Kolkata, with a rich heritage of taste flowing through its veins.
Sree Hari Mistanna Bhandar serves a huge variety of sweets but the most satisfying of the lot is the famous "Lyangcha" -¬† It is made from flour and milk powder by frying it and dipping it into sugar syrup for a long time.¬†
And coming to the snacks, the "Dal Puri" - Dalpuri is a traditional Bengali breakfast bread as well as a popular evening snack, served with the lip smacking "Cholar Dal" & chutney is the very essence of this historic sweet shop.¬†
The shop is very well spacious and accommodates more than 100 people at a time.

Items Ordered:
1 plate Dal Puri (4pieces) & 1 piece Lyangcha
Cost: Rs.34 (Including GST)

No separate tax is charged on food items.

For every "Dal Puri" & "Lyangcha" lovers, this is a must visit sweet shop to feel the rich history underneath the taste of the "Cholar Dal".

Cost for two: Rs.70 approx

"Any time is a Dal Puri time!"

Quality of food is very good and cheap in price. Comfortable ambience. Behaviour of staffs are quite good.. You can get kachoris just for 6/- per piece which is very less amount as compared to the quality and size.They have Veg curry with kachori on every friday.They also serve many kind of sweets. Among them Langcha is the best one which has different prices according to their size.last but not the least Lassi is a must thing which I always take there which is just 20/- per glass but very much tasty

Very bad quality. Better to avoid this place. There are other shops nearby where one can find far better sweets as well as kachuris. This is one of the worst places one can find in terms of food quality.

My work place is just the next building but we avoid food from this joint at any cost even we are very hungry.

This is one of the oldest and popular sweet shop located in Bhowanipur near Ashutosh college. I have been visiting here since childhood and I must say that nothing have changed much regarding their quality of sweets, servicing. Both were too good.¬† Their radhaballavi and cholar dal is very famous. I loved their gulab jamun, lyncha but my favourite was their spongy rosogolla. It was so tasty. Prices were pocket friendly. Staffs were very well behaved. Seating arrangements were nice. So if you guys have not visited here till now please come soon.

Having your college at Hazra gives you the advantage of trying out the various kinds of food available in that vicinity. One such place is Sree Hari which has been satisfying hungry stomachs and souls for more than hundred years now. Their kachori and daal along with langcha has reached a cult status and their glamour has braved the battle of time with elan. This place was our regular place for Adda in our college days and I do miss those days.

This place is popular for its Radhaballavi-Dal and Huge size Langcha.. but it also serves good misti doi, Rossogolla, and many other sweets.... if u want to taste halua and kochuri u must go to these place before 7 AM.. coz by that time its sold out..... u can give it a try if u r kochuri and misti lover.... Price is also reasonable...

Being a Jogomaya student, early morning college can put off your breakfast. But thanks to Sree Hari Mistanna Bhandar, this place is often our breakfast provider. The luchi and chholar dal are cheap and tasty. The tea may not be that helpful to wake you up, but the food is absolutely amazing. So I'm gonna rate this a 5/5.

There is something about Sri Hori that's very different - from gender segregated eating area (though hardly followed any longer), to the filled-to-maximum capacity at all times (a mix of social economic segments from very pedestrian to college going crowd) to the manual billing system of trusty waiters who let the customers eat first and then meticulously follow them to the billing counters for payment (no fancy voucher coding system).

Sri Hori is as much good bottom-of-the-pyramid business model as much it is a heritage vignette - and hence I quite ended up liking it very much.

The food was also good - the famed radhaballabi were fuffy and nice (a tiny notch below the ones at Putiram's kochuri), and the aloo torkari was also very nice. The dal was finished by a whisker, the last spoon of it got over right before my serving -  so it gives me an urgent reason to visit the place again to try out the dal radhaballobi combo. 

I parcelled home langhcha -enormous ones, for only 10 bucks each, very light and not too sugary.  After all this, I was left happy with my meal. 

In the end, I insist you visit the place once, irrespective of the whether the food blows you over or not - because places like this form an important and indispensable part of our food demography.

The beautiful taste of the food here is often eclipsed by regular passers-by who know this place by it's streetfront location, but might have never entered.

It's a ¬†crowded, no-nonsense, value-for-money place with a difference. It has people who will still serve you in plates, etc for everything rather than just any other sweet shop.

But the more crucial and important difference is limited as the menu may be to salty snack savouries (if you consider that a limitation), and different sweets, the radhapallabi- singara- kochuri ¬†retain a rustic simplistic taste that I strongly recommend trying.Apart from Apanjan near Kalighat, ¬†Mrityunjay near Lansdowne market, Putiram near College street which are all slightly different yet amongst some ¬†of the most recommended for these typical Bengali salty savoury snacks,

Used to be our favourite place during college days. Even today when I am around Hazra I try not to miss a plate of kochuri with daal and an occasional langcha. Love the perfectly balanced daal here. The langchas, though huge in size, are actually soft and tasty.

The place is not for hygiene freaks, but the inner family dining room is better (If there is atleast one lady in your group, you have the permission to enter the family room). Service is fast.

If you are around, you must visit this place for the kochuri and daal atleast.

Even today there are places in Kolkata which holds the pillar to keep its age old legacy alive, each and every moment. And one such place, located bang opposite to "Bijoli" cinema hall, is "Sree Hari Mistanna Bhandar", popular for its mouth watering sweets and snacks to the young crowd of today, and the patrons of yesteryear as well.

If you go by the appearance, it is a small cramped up old cabin type place with wooden tables and furniture, along with the kitchen heat and smoke whiffs booming inside, clearly reflecting a negative and uncomfortable vibe instantly. But if you go by not to judge a book by its cover, be patient for a while, till you take the first bite. The very next moment you will realise that all your efforts to try this place is absolutely justified , and nothing to regret about. Perhaps, that's the magic of this place!! 
And yes, don't forget to try their house special giant  "Lyangcha" which is sure to leave your taste buds coated with melodious notes.

A very nice place to try out some delicious bites, and highly recommended to all the foodies out there.

A small roadside sweetmeat shop which you mightn't notice, unless you know the place. It's located just across from the Bhawanipur police station. Kachuri with cholar daal is a must try. They are also known for their misti doi (sweet yogurt) and langcha (a circular cone shaped bengali dessert delicacy, to some extent tastes like gulabjamun )

This was a perfect place for a quick "bangali jol khabar". Their famous kochuri with cholar daal with a dash of mishti chatni and a glass of chilled lassi, will make any day a happy day.The staff was very quick in their work and the food was piping hot.Can't really comment about the ambience because, it's just an old,good, bangali misti dokan of Kolkata. But the place is clean and tidy.

Had dropped in twice of thrice many years back when I used to go to visit my friends at Ashutosh College. Not for hygiene freaks, this place used to serve some of the amazing Kochuri-Daal combo. The Daal used to exceptionally lovely, and paired well with the Kachuris. Mishti Doi happened to be the perfect desert, to end your meal. Cheap, tasty and delicious, hope to drop in here soon to revive the nostalgic memories. :-)

It was a nice experience to had a plate in Sree Hari Mistanna Bhandar. The manu was Kachuri and Chana Dal with Chatni. I think day by day they are reduced their food quality. Kachuri was not so good as well as the Chana Dal also. It's hearts braking.

One more landmark eatery in kolkata...Located just opposite to Bhawanipore Police Station...
Used to go there frequently during college days when i used to visit Asutosh College to meet friends...
Kochuris,Cholar Dal and the hot cake "Langcha" was our favourite snack...Price very reasonable...
Only drawback was the interior seating arrangements...Space was short and creepy...
Though now they have done their interiors well and given a new sober look to the shop...
They have now even started new menu which includes Lassi...
Good old memories!!!

Located opp Bijoli cinema, this place is heritage..!! Don't go by the look, and don't even take the ambience in consideration. I found a unique thing the is a seperate sitting place for ladies. As you enter , you are just taken back in time.
We ordered kochuri, cholar daal and their legendary " langcha". 
Enjoyed every bite of the savoury items.
They have successfully satisfied the carvings of generations.

I tried their jumbo-sized langcha which was just delightfully sweet and light and very tasteful, reminding me of the langchas of Shaktigar, though this tasted better to me. I also had their kochuri and dal which were tasty, savoury and constituted a welcomingly pleasing meal for a change.

This small and heritage sweet shop is located very near to my college, and so I've visited this place many a time. 

Food: 4/5. The kachuri with cholar dal and a tart chutney, lyangcha, mishti doi and lassi are the main attractions here. All the items are very tasty and worth a try. However, they fry the kachuris in lots, and so wouldn't find fresh kachuris all throughout the day. You are more likely to find them hot and fresh in the evenings. 

Staff: 4/5. They are prompt to service. However, don't expect a restaurant-like service here.

Hygiene: 1/5. If you're a hygiene freak, then you better stay away from this place. The interiors are shabby with old tables and benches, and are anything but clean. I found a cockroach walking across the wall beside me on my last visit.

I've been hogging here too hungrily and too much to be able to click pictures. Honestly! Even before I can get my camera out for a decent click, the kochuris go straight to my stomach. They're made the best here, and both the daal and the torkari are to die for. I also like the the sweet, tart and hot combination of their chutney and lonkar achar. Too many go down before I can even control myself :D 
Surprisingly the sweets are done decently too, I loved their lyangcha more than the roshogolls, which can be a bit spongy. They make a killer lassi as well, thick and salty or sweet, as you'd like it. The kulfi is the only thing I found slightly watery and off the mark. 
Yes this place is shoddy, doesn't have AC and bare bones sitting areas, rickety fans and zero ambience. If all these bothers you, feel free to take your goodies home,  reheat and relive the magic. The service is very fast, helpful and kind. 
One thing I always admired about this place is how I've had food there and my otherwise bad stomach never fell sick. No stomach flu, no ombol. Perhaps their freshness is the reason. 
Also, I logged out on my Janmashtami post fast meal here and ate almost everything off the menu; the bill was lesser than ‚Çπ149. 
Affordability: Very much!

the combination of kachuri , dal followed by a medium langchay (of Rs15) is what is the standard spec.. The warm kachuri is divine..

Ambiance is a slice of history.. there is a iron cash box in the inner room probably hundreds of year old.. the refrigerator is prehistoric. The chairs too should be of pre-independence era.¬†
its a place for serious eaters. Those who eat along with you are mostly serious and object oriented. they would sit quiet or engage in serious discussion. This outlet is a part and parcel of the essence of Kolkata.

Asutosh College, Hazra More and Shree Hari Mistanna Bhandar. I was visiting this place after almost four / five years and felt really nostalgic. Passing by is something completely different and I realized it more as I stood in front of the old sweet shop. Not much have changed here (The footpath in front of Jatin Das Park is completely covered with various stalls now. I like road side food stalls, but not to this extent. Horrible!).

Situated opposite to bhawanipur thana . It is very renowned sweet shop at  bhawanipur. I went there at least once in a week when I was a school student. They are famous for their kachori and dal. If you visit Sree Hari Mistanna bhandar do not forget to order Lassie. The only thing they require is to make the interior clean.

We hopped into this place without thinking twice when we heard its famous for lyangcha. But unfortunately this best rated sweet of the place was not available. In fact except two dry sweets, nothing else was available! 
We ordered luchi daal. It was nothing extraordinary. The luchi was rather hard to tear but the daal was good.
The only good thing about the place was probably the courteous staffs. The man who served us was very polite and well behaved.

I happened to come across this old sweet shop during my first visit to Indira Cinema to book advance tickets for a show. The crowd inside, seated on the little chairs placed along the tables, pulled us in. Fellow users at Zomato have recommended the Langcha quite often, so we asked for that. Unfortunately, it wasn't available due to the heavy demand of the festive day. Finally, we had in front of us, Kochuri & Dal, with Goja and another bhaja mishti (i always forget its name!) 

The sweets were good, although nothing out of the world. Kochuri & dal constituted the better part, with the dal getting a lot of praise from my side. W got the food in less than 15 seconds. Six out of five for the speed!

Coming to another lovely point, the behavior of the staff was exceptional. He entertained all our queries with a big smile , and was very polite. Awesome. 
Prices are standard and absolutely reasonable. You could eat to your heart's content and still need to fish out less than Rs 100 from the wallet. 

I'll visit again to try the lyangcha, and the kochuri (read : dal) , of course. :)

The only con is the hygiene and ambiance... it is of the vintage types found in Kolkata. There is also takeaway who might mind of the ambiance.

A 100 year old sweet shop in the food capital of India, Sree Hari Mistanna Bhandar is kind of like the morning habit of the Bhawanipur locals. After being there quite a number of times, my review goes as follow-
Ambiance - Don't sweat over it. It's just a century old sweet shop. Hygiene is an issue and for obvious reasons you won't be getting any luxurious seating arrangements. 
Food - now we are talking. Just go and blindly order a plate of dal-kachori. Their kachoris have a thin stuffing of sweet and salty sattu and a very homely yet yummy 'cholar dal' with a dollop of sweet chutney just makes the whole experience so awesome. 
Secondly, do order their Rosogollas..Huge cottage cheese balls in sugar syrup, very tasty but their signature dish would be their 'pashbalish lyangcha'. An elongated version of the traditional gulab jamun, this lyangcha goes upto 7-9 inch in length. The biggest in the city. 
You can also come for a cup of steamy tea which happens to be the staple for a lot of regulars. 
You have a sweet tooth? Feel free to hit this outlet. I can easily vouch you will return home satisfied. Cheers!!

My Rating of 3.5 could have been 4.5 but just because of the non hygiene of this place!
Sree Hari Mistanna Bhandar, located on the main road, bang opposite bhawanipur police station, is one of the oldest sweet shops of Kolkata. And it still exudes the old world charm - the decades old table and chairs, more than half a century old fridge, old sweet-keeping shelves and the very old shop's name signage (they have put a new one recently).
The place is always buzzing with loyal customers - be it any time of the day. And the most coveted food item here is the famous Kochuri and Chana Dal! A typical bengali style sweet tasting Dal goes excellent with the crisp and hot kachuri. Other bengali sweets are also available in abundance here but my personal favourite is the Langcha - a brown coloured sweet, cylindrical in shape, that just melts in the mouth! I wonder some people say that Shaktigarh (dist burdwan) offers the best Langcha in the country, probably they haven't tasted the Langcha of this place. I have tasted Shaktigarh's Langcha from several eateries there but none comes even close to Sree Hari Mistanna Bhandar's!
The pricing is still one of the lowest in town, probably a strong reason why it has managed to hold so many loyal customers. The only drawback of this famed eatery is the hygiene. Tables, chairs, floors, waiters... all tell the tale of poor upkeep. The eatery should concentrate on this aspect. But then it is still worth to go and have the items - maybe stand outside and eat or take a parcel. But one shouldn't miss the decades old taste

Sree Hari is an old and famous place for its traditional Bengali snacks and sweets. I have been visiting the place quite occasionally. It's located just opposite to the Bhawanipur Police station.
The place has got 2 section one is for male and another for family exclusively for female and male are required to be with a last to sit in that section of the restaurant. The place has newly been renovated with new floor and marvel walls. The sitting arrangements and the fans are still remained the same . The sitting is uncomfortable , tables have marvel tops and the place is not very hygienic. It is basically a quick bite joint. They are famous for their kachuri and cholar daal. If you not ask the waiter he will give you both the items in a single plate, it's better to take the kachuri in a separate plate so that its outer crust stay crisp. Another very famous item is the langcha. A elongated cylindrical sweet that taste much like a gulab jamun.
Food is cheap, but one of the saddest thing is I my previous visits I saw some children working there. However after renovation they are not to be seen.
I hope the restaurant is not indulging into child labour.

Food ordered:

1) Kachori with signature bong sweet cholar daal - The daal was nice. The kachori was a bit hard to chew.

====
Summary:

Food quality 3.3/5
Taste 3.2/5
Food quantity 3.3/5

Suggestions: The kachori should not be too stiff.
====
Conclusion: It is one of the oldest places and run by its name now. Would personally visit and then update a much detailed review soon.

I am a regular customer here and I visit this place once every year typically on Maha Saptamee morning just before visiting the Bakul Bagan puja pandal. I don't find sweets they serve to be extraordinary to mention; just like any standard sweet shop product in the city. Neither I have tasted any other snacks they serve. The signature dish here is Kachuri with Chholar Daal. This is probably the second best Kachuri shop in the city, Putiram being at the top. Extremely delicious, enough quantity and exceptionally pocket-friendly. However, I never liked the ambiance. Space shortage for sitting, clumsy, noisy, badly maintained, improperly cleaned interiors and sometimes utensils. Lots of flies fly around which I feel quite unhygienic. But at the end, the wonderful taste of Kachuri practically waives off all the negatives they reluctantly carry with them year after year. As a fan of this outlet, I would suggest management to improve the negatives and make this a more wonderful place to sit and eat.

This is as genuine review as I can give being an outsider and keeping my emotions aside. This place, as I came to know is the oldest sweet shop in Kolkata. No wonder all my kolkata fellows go gaga over it. I stay hardly 100 meter from this place and have been to it multiple times. Sweets and dal kachori is well know and readily available along with variety of sweets.

The only thing that lets this place down is hygiene. The only word that describes hygiene level is pathetic. The bare chested sweating staff members can scare the hell out of any cleanliness loving person. Top it up with dirty tables and unconfirmtable plastic chair, making it a horrible experience for a non-bengali person like me.

My review

Food : 4/5 for taste
Ambience:1/5
Staff:1/5
Hygiene:0/5
Value for money:5/5

Recommend :No if you care about hygiene of place like me.

The attraction , not their ambiance, or their variety of menu but only for their Kochuri and Cholar Dal(served all day long) and their Langchas(a kind of fried sweet). They are heavenly without any ounce of doubt and to mention, their taste hasn't changed over generations, literally. Must visit for all.

The 'gorom gorom kochuri and cholar daal' is a must try for everyone and then the lyangcha' and 'Pantua'. And the best part is 'that it doesn't feel heavy on your pockets too. So if you are looking for some bangaliana then this place is a must try for sure. :D

This is one shop, which you must not even bother about reading the reviews before you decide to take visit.Nahh...they don't don't a hundred variety of sweets there, they don't even sell fast food. You must visit the shop out of sheer love and nostalgia that this ancient sweet shop promises to provide.I was introduced to it by my Mum, who was probably a frequent visitor in her college days of Jogmaya Devi. She probably was introduced by her father who also had been an Asutosh student.I am neither, I am from Jadavpur University, still I do visit it often, and love to visit it whenever I feel just to eat their Kachuri and Dal...and that typical age old red sauce. Dunno how long has this been going.... The inside cabin for "Women and Men with Women only" still make me smile everytime I visit.DO NOT LEAVE THE SHOP WITHOUT HAVING THEIR LYANGCHA, AND THE DELICACY OF THE MISTI DOI!!!

This ancient old sweet shop is located just opposite "Bhawanipur police station". It has been in business for ages and is very popular in the locality for providing delicious sweets and savories in a reasonable price. It is quite a small joint, doesn't have any kind of elegant decor worth mentioning. The interiors are pretty shabby and old fashioned. They have got 4-5 benches-tables to provide for the sitting accommodation. They are acclaimed for their mouth watering "hinger kachori and chola daal" which is just succumbing and trust me you will keep craving for more every time. They offer authentic Bengali sweets like - rasgulla, pantua, sandesh, chitrakut etc which are just damn perfect and smooth in taste and the prices are reasonable too. "See Hari Mistanna Bhander" is one of its kind, which is reigning completely depending on the quality of its offerings.

My pg para's sweet shop :)
I would say their kochuris are the best ( having tried many other famous ones) in town.
I never got the famous bangali "ombol" eating at this place.  .I guess its the keeping- kochuris-in-a-jhuri strategy. Even better is their cholar dal that is served along with the kochuris . Actually that is what this place is famous for . .the DAL . .very simply cooked and I can just keep on eating it.
They also serve radhabollobis in d afternoon and evening. They fry them twice a day. .once ,early in the morning and from 4pm again. You can also get them packed as many don't like the interiors. Its not very modern or new but is clean and small.
A cup of their tea and a plate of hot kochuris is simply an awesome treat.

Now coming to their sweets. .you need to see the size of their lyangchas ! ! Super soft and super long. .they offer you three sizes . Even their roshogollas and mishti doi in a bhar are good.

The shop is always very busy but you will get a place and the food in a jiffy.
Its very easy to find too ,being located just opposite to the Bhawanipur police station.
The prices are very reasonable and you really won't care about the price for such good food.

a must visit place if you want good kachuri with chholar dal (with coconut). they prepare them in the morning, and there is demand of it as the quality is very good. make sure you reach there by 8-8:30am, otherwise, the chholar dal would be sold out after 9am. you can still get kachuri with aalu sabzi, and that is good too. the singara (samosa) is another item which you can try, specially in the winters they prepare them with fulkopi (cauliflower) in it. the third item which must be tried is lengcha (a sweet). they have 4 different sizes and each one of them tastes delicious. the biggest one is almost similarly sized like a egg roll! the place is very old and not that clean, but the food is great. parking is easy on the front of the shop in the main road itself.

Another hidden gem of Kolkata from the yester years.This was my maiden visit to this joint after all these years, all thanks to my laziness.Thanks to the Zomato foodie community for bringing it in my food scan radar :) Now coming on to the foodie experience.Truth be told it was mixed bag.The kochuri & cholar dal( 4 pieces at Rs 24/-) was average to say the least.Perhaps a bad day for me and the karigar. Sounds shocking but true.Reason is that the kochuri was not crispy at all and the cholar dal lacked the sweetness that it is famous for.I would rate the stuff at Putiram a notch higher than this joint. No complaints on the langcha though.It comes in different sizes and is priced at Rs 7,10,15 respectively. The sweetness was just perfect.Absolute bliss i must say. Did not know that they do serve tea or shall i call it chaa. It was pedestrian, nothing to write home about. 
Prompt and polite service, extremely pocket friendly prices,decent seating arrangement and yummy sweets and snacks are what one should look forward to.

One of the pocket friendly places with stories rendered by generations...This small one is just one word "Delicious". The Daal Kachoris along with sweet flavored Chana Daal(Cholar Daal) is lip smacking. The best part is the crispiness of the Kachoris which tends to be never changing irrespective what hours of the day you visit, I happened to know about the same from my cousins and more from my wife who herself is a product of Ashutosh/Jogmaya College and for students there its a place of bhoori bhoj till college ends...

The only two cons I experienced is : 1) Place is very small, needs an expansion you should consider yourself lucky enough if you manage to bag a table there. 2) They need to work upon the lengchas infact sometimes its beyond sweetest sometimes its par sweeter

Located conveniently on the main road bang opposite Bhawanipore Police Station, Sree Hari is a local institution of repute. Older than most people can remember, it's a place which has fed generations. And what hasn't changed in all this time is the extremely generous prices and the superb taste of the Kochuris and Langchas. Needless to say, it's always been a hit with college students along with other light pocketed groups. For anyone to have studied in nearby Asutosh College and not to have gone there atleast once, is a crime. :D 

Having said that, the ambiance may be a downer for many. Poorly ventilated, dingy and not the staunchest followers of hygiene, the place is unpretentious and entirely true to the type of food they serve. Though there's always a full house about, a short wait will be enough to find a seat among the two rooms that serve as the serving floor. The seating arrangement is a bit haphazard in order to cramp in as many chairs as possible. But it's all good when the plate is put down. Food is always fresh and always hot. Added bonus : As much daal as you may possibly require.

The longest langchas in the city merit a review of it's own. Suffice to say, the Langchas are a Sree Hari staple that should be sampled atleast once, if only for the sake of bragging to your friends. They come in various sizes and the longest ones can't be possibly had by a single person. *No judging here* :P Though some complain that the taste has suffered over the years, it's still better than your average mishti shop.


Chakraborty Tips : Buy the longest Langcha available. Eat it. Bask in self glory.

First thing about this shop is  Kachori and Chollar Dal and meetha/thickha chutney. Awesome when served hot ( morning 8-9am ) and ( evening 4:30-6 pm) . Second is the sweet called LANGCHA ( red in colour and cylindrical shaped ) . You need to eat it hot. Their rasogollas are real soft and spongy which in kolkata you can get in Bhim Chandra Nag and K.C Dass sweet shop. Sandesh is good. But its mostly famous Kachori nd Chollar Dal. Try Them. You would return to their shop again !!!

The most pocket friendly place I have ever been to. The Dal Kochuris, Langcha, Samosa and Tea, that cost me merely 25 bucks, make for a delicious breakfast. Looking forward to trying the Rasogullas and Lassi on my next visit to this ridiculously economical eatery.

Their kochuri-torkari and vegetable chop is what dreams are made of. I have grown up on Sree Hari's mishti and savouries- the dorbesh, a modified form of laddoo is to die for. A must-visit for all Calcuttans:)

Shree Hari Mistanna Bhandar is a place where we crave for hot kochuri and cholar dal. Even the vegetable chop is something you can try. Its true that the quality of food has definitely detoriated but its still a legacy for the people staying for a long time in Bhawanipur.

Sree Hari is a traditional sweet shop located in Bhawanipur opposite Bhawanipur Police Station. The shop has its name in the area because of its unchanged taste of sweets and some yummy kachoris for years. Yes, the shop is famous for its dal kachoris which are served all time. Having them as morning breakfast is highly recommended if you are passing by Ashutosh Mukherjee Road or a daily jogger at Jatin Das Park. The kachoris are served hot along with some chollar dal.

Apart from the unmatched taste of kachories, you also have radha ballavi, samosa, vegetable chop and other vegetarian snacks available. In the sweets section you have all kinds of traditional collection of sweets such as sandesh, rasgulla, langcha, mishti doi (sweet curd) etc.

Prices are very cheap compared to Banchharam and Balaram Mullick. Ambiance wise, the shop keeps traditional ambiance and it needs a renovation really soon. There are enough tables and chairs to accommodate the crowd however the shop is full during breakfast hour and you might need to make adjustments to have kachoris. Service is fast and hot kachoris are fried and served really fast. They also have packing facility if you are in a hurry and need to take kachoris home.

Hygienically, the shop is good. Now you might not know this but the shop does not keep any leftovers for the next day. It feeds all the leftover kachoris, dal and other snacks to the poor and beggars around. There is a huge line for that after 10:00PM. Next morning they start with fresh preparation.

All and all, Sree Hari is doing a great business and charity as well by helping feed needy people. All they need to do is renovate the place to attract more people. Service is already fine and they don't need to hire more people.

Sri Hari Mistanna Bhandar is one of the traditional shops of Kolkata that have stood since like forever. A small place which means business and nothing else. Freshly fried kachoris wid chollar dal ending with a couple of mishti dois is my perfect meal any time of the day. 

Located near Hazra crossing opposite bhawanipore police station, this is a small and congested place filled with people all the time and the staff rushing around you serving hot kachoris or radha ballavi. They have quite a variety of traditional sweets with lengha being a very popular choice, going by the other reviews. But i am not so much of a fan of its sweets though. The bengali version of the samosas served here is one of my all time favorites and would recommend to anyone who hasn't tried it yet.

Yes, there is nothing on grounds of decor or ambience or hospitality on offer here but simply, great and fresh food at extremely pocket friendly prices !!!!

When You have 50 bucks in your pocket and u want to eat Awesome ... I mean awesome ! food ... This is the place to be . Sree Hari is to South Kolkata what Puti Ram is to the College Street. IT is a small shop near Hazra Mor and I have eaten it over the years. The Chholar Dal tastes the same for the last 20 years and I  am madly in love with it . 

Everyone loves the Radhaballavi with chholar dal. In fact they open before 6 am and the radha ballavi is frying all day . They dont have a fancy display and the sweets are very old world. Not a huge fan of their sweets but the Lengcha, the chamcham and the Hari bhog take me elsewhere .  In fact i can vouch for the lengcha to be one of the best in the city . 

They also make delicious singhara . Love the sweet after taste of the stuffing with peanuts in it . Unlike most bengali sweet shop singharas this is a tad bit on the spicy side . The vegetable chop too is too die for . Even when not hot they taste delicious . 

Over all a place that I can swear by and be satiated even when I am practically broke ! 

Sree Hari is nothing but pure history !

Sree Harir Lyangcha aar Kachuri-chholar daal is one of my favorite budget meals in Bhawanipore region, and I sometimes stop by to eat piping hot, fluffy kachuri with a beautifully made chholar daal... but the best thing is probably the pillowy, soft lyangcha you get to eat afterwards. They have a number of sizes - you choose your destiny and go for it.

Sree Hari Mistanna Bhandar is THE legendary dal kochuri place situated bang opposite Bhowanipur Police Station. The place itself is a landmark and Im sure half of Calcutta is aware of its existence ! This is one sweet shop which has not even changed a single bit in the last few decades. Housed in one of the pre independence buildings in Bhowanipur, it is famous for its Dal-Kachori, the famous Langcha (which comes in various sizes) and definitely the Halwa-kachori which are available only in the early hours of the morning. Apart from that it also serves other sweets and the best part is that everything is still affordable and comparatively cheaper than other famous sweet shops around Kolkata

My favourite is the Dal-Kachori. Kachori is priced at Rs4 each and the dal is complimentary. The dal has an unique taste which makes me go back time and again. Hot piping kachoris served right at your table all day long. The langchas come in various sizes, priced from Rs 5 to Rs Rs20. All other sweets are also priced well and does not pinch your pocket at all. 

Ambiance is very basic and non air conditioned ofcourse, but Sri Hari has a charm of its own !

About a month back I got a samosa craving and I wanted to eat the Bengali singhara version so I asked my driver where I would get some good samosas not of the Haldiram, Tewari , Gupta Brothers variety though. I was surprised when he bought me here .... been driving past it for years but never had I tried it !  The singhara was actually very good and naturally I wanted to explore what else they had on offer so my driver recommended I try the langchas which are quite similar to gulab jamuns and it was yummy. Further conversation led to talk of the morning halwa kachuri which I went last week and tried .... sinfully delicious and only served very early so please don't go too late or you will miss out. Now I will go and sample the Dal and Kachori next as it has been highly recommended.  Go try this place out guys surprised to find only one previous review for it .... its not high profile and fancy but you will walk away with both your wallet and your tummy very happy :-)

Aaaahh!! "Amar parar mishtir dokan"! I must say I was not expecting to find this place in Zomato.But for me this place deserves its place in Zomato.This is not because I am biassed towards my "parar mishtir dokan" but because this is no ordinary sweets shop.
This is one of the very old sweets shop of Kolkata.Located just opposite Bhawanipur police station it is very popular among all the people of the area and rightly so.You would find this place crowded at almost all times of the day.
Known by name as "mistanna bhandar"meaning sweets shop,this place is more renowned for its "dal-kachuri".There are many places in Kolkata which serve good kachuris.But this place is unique because they serve their kachuris with cholar dal (lentil).I have been having dal kachuris from this place ever since I was born! And trust me,it is not only unique but excellent.When I was a kid,I did not like to have dal at all.I started liking dal after having cholar dal from this place.This will surely give you an idea about how good it really is.They serve the dal with a chutney which is also very tasty.You will surely like the chutney too,even more so if you have a slightly sweet tooth.Another great thing about the place is that if you have your food there itself,you are served as much dal and chutney as you want! The price is also unbelievably cheap.Even today the dal-kachuris cost Rs 4 per peice.
Among the other items on offer,they prepare "halwa-kachuri" in the early mornings which is "khasta kachuri" with "suji".It is also very very tasty.
Among the sweets,the place is renowned for its "langchas".They prepare langchas of various sizes ranging in price from Rs 5 to Rs 20.The langchas are really good.They are not as deeply fried as the famous langchas of Shaptigarh near Bardhaman but they are quite good in their own way.Apart from these you will find all other types of sweets that you would expect to find in any other sweets shop.Just about nothing will let you down but tha kachuris and the langchas are special.
The place provides seating arrangement for about 30 people in two sections,one outside and one inside.The section inside is slightly cleaner and cooler but it can be accessed only when you are a female or you have a female member with you.I dont really understand the reason for this discrimination.But the food is the same and thats whats more important! There is nothing called as ambience.There are common tables only.Hygiene and cleanliness are not the best.The staff are not the friendliest or the most well trained.For these reasons there are many who prefer the takeaway.But they dont provide the chutney with their kachuris on takeaway nor can you ask for more dal.So I personally dont prefer the takeaway.But its a reasonable option for those who are a little concerned about hygiene and service and ambience.
Another wonderful thing which is worth mentioning about the place is that quite often they distribute some of their extra food to the beggars on the streets when they close down.This is a very generous and wonderful gesture which deserves credits.
Overall,if you like to try out new places and you like your fast food,then,do give this place a try!
