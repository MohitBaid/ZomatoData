গুড় সন্দেশ,  মিষ্টি দই আর কাজু বরফি নিয়েছিলাম।  পার্ক সার্কাস এলাকায় অবস্থান।  খাবারের স্বাদ মাঝারি।  কর্মচারী দের ব্যবহার খারাপ নয়।  পরিবেশ চলনসই।

This is my preferred spot for chenna-based sweets. They don't add mava or excessive sugar. During winters, the nolen-gur flavours taste authentic. Try the Aabaar-Khabo and Rabri.

I am a hardcore dessert person.
And being a Bengali my love for sweets is just mandatory. I am not a fan of sandesh but you can never say no to a single sandesh from park sweets.
One of the prime sweet shops in Kolkata Park sweets has a history as good as Kolkata's.
If you have never had mishti doi from park sweets then you have had nothing in life. The mishti doi here is just top notch.
It has become a common element of comparison in every Bengali household. 'The curd was good but not as good as that from Park Sweets' 
Apart from mishti they have their special creation The ice cream cake which is another marvel!!

In my personal survey, I have had not able to find even one Bengali who is not fond of sweets. However, whenever I look myself into the mirror, I get only one known Bengali not really craving for sweets. Despite not liking much of sweets, I happened to taste sweets every now and then just to keep the heart of my well-wishers.

Park Sweets is located in between Park Circus Seven Point Crossing and Mullick Bazaar, being just opposite to Shakespeare Sarani. It serves different types of Bengali sweets and has a decent area for one to comfortable place orders.

The staffs out here are very courteous and treats you with utmost dignity which is a rarity in today’s world. They pack syrup sweets in a convenient way and thus one does not have any problem in carrying.

I tried different rosogollas, sandeshes as well as barfi and like all of them, while the personal favourite being Barfi.

A recommended visit.
