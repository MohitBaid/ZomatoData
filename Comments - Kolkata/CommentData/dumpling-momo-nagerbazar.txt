Too costly for quantity provided. Thukpa is the worst dish. Momo's are still eatable. But not worth 80rs per plate. Wow momo gives much better quality. They also charge for containers extra. Only thing I like in steamed momo.

Very poor taste. When they started in the beginning they used to have good taste and quality. But now both have gone south. Size has shrinked, Momo's are dry inside,the outer layer is becoming thicker and thicker and almost no chicken stuffing inside. As I can see in many reviews here, the manager behaviour has always been an issue for this outlet and the sitting arrangements, but at least when their food was good these could be side stepped. Now I will recommend to go to wow momo or even the footpath stalls outside diamond plaza, they serve better Momo's and are polite in customer behaviours!

Absolutele worst stuff behaviour in the entire dumdum area. Go to this restaurant only if there is no food left on the entire planet and this is the only place left. The manager of this counter thinks himself as perhaps the CEO of all momo companies combined together. Doesn't have sitting arrangements, serves smelly mono, not even sufficient size and when you go to complain the manager will threaten you. This is an absolute joke of a place. You guys should go to real estate business considering your attitude towards customer rather than running a food joint.

Got a voucher from nearbuy of two steam momo.  Ordered chicken steam momo,  they were quite big with a thin coating and stuffed with good amount of chicken.  The soup is clear one with not much stuff in it.  The sauce is an authentic one,  spicy and sour.  The staff are quite friendly.  The drawback is they don't have seating arrangement,  at least few chairs would make customers comfortable.

Steamed Chicken Momos- Tastes good and has ample fillings of chicken. But the sauce served alongside isn't the authentic spicy chutney. It's somewhat sweet and tastes weird.

Pan Fried Momos- Simply Amazing! üòã

The Momo Burger- It's the first and only shop I've had momo burgers in, and they were okayish. 

Special mention: The staff is really very friendly. üòä

Got delivered from this place once. Though the name of the restaurant shows that it prioritizes on momos, still...The momos were disappointing. Very.
The momo size was  good but the taste was simply BORING. The fried momos had no taste but the pan fried ones were a little better. Honestly, the roadside momo stalls opposite the DCN mall serves tastier momos.

But still they have refused to accept the deal and asked me to contact little customer care. They are sitting there only to haress the customers. Also which particular items they are offering in little deals, those items are not available at store all times. So I will suggest all customers to be aware from this unfaithful store. I will never ever recommend Dumpling Momo to anyone. Wow Momo is 100 times better than this. No next time perhaps.

Situated in the food court of Diamond Plaza mall in Nagerbazaar, it isn't a hard find at all. 
Let's move on to food 

1. Chicken Steamed Momo
The momos were served with a clear soup and a slightly spicy dip on the side. With the soup more often ignored than not, it was nice to find that Dumpling Momo has preserved the traditional way of serving it. The momos had a thin covering with just the right amount of filling inside. The soup and the sauce completed the dish.

2. Chicken-Mushroom Steamed Momo 
It is an upgradation from the usual chicken steamed momo. The addition of the mushroom to the chicken filling took this dish up a few notches. 

3. Chicken Pan Fried Momo
A pan fried Momo is a normal fried Momo with a saucy covering on it. While flavour wise, it hit the right notes, we felt that it lacked a bit of the crunch we look for in a pan fried momo. The sauce added a dimension of tanginess, spice and sweetness to the fried momo which made it special.

4. Cottage Cheese Momo
The name of this dish might be a bit deceiving and keep you from trying it. It is steamed momo packed with paneer and potatoes covered with a creamy white sauce. The sauce is similar to a pasta white sauce but it complements the momo really well. The filling of paneer and potatoes was not quite individually recognised but all over was the favourite of most.

5. Chicken MoBurg:
A MoBurg is a burger with two pieces of fried momo filled inside and a piece of fried momo on the side. It was the only real letdown at this outlet. The bread wasn't soft enough and overpowered the taste of the momos. However Mr Bhati took our critics into consideration and has promised to look into it.

6. Meifoon Noodles:
Meifoon is the Chinese name for rice noodles. Meifoon is something you find very rarely at momo outlets and here it's a speciality. The noodles were properly cooked with generous amount of chicken and egg mixed with them. It was a bit bland like it's supposed to be, but a very satisfying dish. Something for the noodle lover.

7. Mixed Thukpa:
 You might have tried out thukpa at other outlets and had not liked it much. But trust me, you will love it here. It wasnt too soupy like a thukpa tends to be but a perfect balance of noodles and veggies and the light taste it is supposed to have. Another recommendation from us. 

*You might want to take their mayo dip while having fried momos which is goes really well with it and is available at a very affordable price of Rs 6.

Dumpling Momo also serves a variety of other momos with fillings unavailable at other places, such as fish and prawn. 

Price for two: Rs 200

With a very pocket friendly diverse menu, Dumpling Momo will be the go to place for every college goer.

It is a reasonable priced small momo joint located on the 4th floor of Diamond Plaza Mall, Nagerbazar. I am a momo lover and so never miss a chance for a quick snack. They serve fresh food. All the options are good- steamed, fried and pan fried, nothing special though. They serve soup with the momo which is not thick but okay. My all time favorite is chicken cheese kothey, it is crunchy and crispy. Thukpa is okay. The staffs are well behaved and service is up to the mark.

Worst customer service ever. Never go to this place if u have a groupon or little deals voucher. Althought they provide about 20prcnt discount in them, they will treat u like ur getting the food for free. They have this one manage, i dnt knw his name, he wear spects, and has the attitude of somone not managing a food kiosk but a police station. Doesnt even have the decency to hear out the customers problems and solve them. Instead he keeps on insisting to call whoever u hv got ur deal from and ask them to redeem it. Infact most of the time he wnt b even in the kiosk fr redeeming. Today was the last time i visited this place. Make no mistake, thr momos r delicious. But sadly this diamond plaza branch has forgot tat customer satisfaction falls in a important category fr managing a resturant.

A small kiosk at diamond plaza food court, they dont have thier own sitting arrangement, but you can have your momos at the food court itself. Best thing i liked was they were very fast to serve nd even kind nd cooperative to deal with customers.

momos they serve are not bad. I have taken paneer pan fried momos, didn't liked the filling much. Overall the sauce nd fried texture was complementing it. They have given 5 pieces in one plate, i was so hungry somehow i finished it up, Even they have good variety ranging from pan fried to fried to steam momos burgers, thupkas n more, i was not so happy with my order, ddnt proceeded to the next option. It was ok, Not a bad option can try!!

Located on 4th floor of diamond plaza mall this place serves a variety of momos. I tried home delivery through Swiggy and ordered for chicken mushroom baozi which is the normal chicken steamed momo. It was OK in taste. Then the chicken cheese pan fried and chicken schezwan pan fried were also ordered. Both were decent. What was good is their packaging. Containers are nice and sturdy. They missed tissue papers which is important. What is not good and worth a mention is the sauce. Momos are tasty to the taste buds for their sauce and this place lacks here. The taste and flavour of the sauce needs to be improved. Overall an ok place.

Ordered a Non Veg Khaw Suey, a Chicken Baozi (steamed momo) and a Chicken Mushroom Kothey (pot sticker). Had ordered in though. The pricing is fine.

Food was neatly packed into plastic bowls, missed the paper napkins though.

Lets take it from the top. The Khao Suey was well presented with a sliced whole fried egg and crispy noodle bits to enhance the texture. The gravy was too coconut-ty and had a weird yellow color to it ( food coloring I presume). There were decent veggie and chicken pieces in it and suprisingly it worked. My suggestion would be to balance it off with some salt and lemon juice. Also the gravy was too heavy on coconut cream. Adding crispy fried garlic and some chilli flakes would have completed this dish texturally.

The Chicken Baozi is nothing but steamed momo. The filling for the dumpling was too salty and dry. The chutney was unseasoned, l have to say that there is nothing more unappetising than a chutney that is just hot as hell without any real taste to it.

The Chicken Mushroom Kothey is your average pot sticker dumpling. The dumplings were nicely caramelised on the outside, however the filling again fell abruptly short of impressing anyone. The filling had specks of mushroom which did not taste of anything mushroom should taste of. 

All in all, a quite forgettable way to have spent INR 360.

They have a different variety in the momos starting from the authentic steamed and fried momo to new style ones like pan fried momo etc.

Chicken cheese kothy and chicken mushroom baozi is a must try at their outlet. I really enjoyed their momos specially the different style ones they offer. 

Service is also very Swift and I like their behavior as well very polite and courteous.

I have started visiting here with Nearbuy voucher only and till now visited many times and tried varieties of momos. The steamed Baozi momo along with soup tastes great, also the Chicken Kothey and Pan Fried Chicken Cheese momo is really tastes excellent. The taste is the right amount sour and the consistency of the soup is just about right. Also tried at last but not the least is CHOCOLATE MOMO which I really liked very much. But only concern is sitting problem as it is outside of the Food Court. However this place is definitely worth a try.
                    

Now this is not at all good place for Momos. There is no good place for sitting. Also the behavior of the staffs are not good. I have purchased few deals from Little app and it is still valid for 30  days more. But still they have refused to accept the deal and asked me to contact little customer care. They are sitting there only to haress the customers. Also which particular items they are offering in little deals, those items are not available at store all times. So I will suggest all customers to be aware from this unfaithful store. I will never ever recommend Dumpling Momo to anyone. No next time perhaps.

Though the food was quite tasty, what actually sets me off is the policy and attitude of the shop and its shopkeeper. After ordering thukpa I noticed that I've been charged for container as well. So when I enquired about the same the person said roughly that shall I serve this on your hand? As this is in food court so we can't go and collect plates from from table to table hence we are charging for the container. When I argued that there are other food joint as well who are not charging anything for cutlery / crockery... He simply said that they are costly that is why they are not charging. So my question is are we supposed to carry cutlery/crockery along with us? Why the hell have you opened the business if you can't provide these to your at least seat down customer. This is very cheap practice to make money. Shame on you.

Location : Outside the Food Court, Diamond Plaza Mall.

A visit to the Diamond Plaza is always on my cards whenever I crave for some lip smacking spicy viand. And what better can satisfy this desire than a plate of hot peppery momos, and the thought always carries me to Dumpling Momo.

We ordered some Mushroom momos and Veg Cheese momos. Both of which lived upto the expectations. However their chilli sauce is the key ingredient in my opinion. It is what brings the true fiery flavour to the dishes.

Now the negative part. It is pretty obvious that the items are over priced. Another problem is that they don‚Äôt have any sort of sitting arrangement, even though it is situated inside a mall. Work on this guys as it is really uncomfortable and awkward to eat while standing, especially in a mall.

Quite a good place for having quick bites on momo! Their steamed momos are as good as the pan fried versions.. Chicken capsicum and chicken cheese are my two most favourites.. though they need to improve the quality of their momo chutney.. most of the times, it does not smell nice , most probably because of over-usage of vinegars / preservatives.. and momos do not taste good without the punch of hot chillies! I tend to avoid their soup as well, which lacks any taste or flavour.
Recently they have started keeping pulpy grape juices along with.. a good thirst quencher..

The most disappointing part of this joint is that they do not have a seating arrangement of their own. You have to carry your plates/bowls to the main food court and look for a seat.

This is a review for delivery order, so ambiance has been replaced by Delivery Time and Temperature of food. I ordered Dim Sham Baozi, Chicken Baozi, Chicken Kothey and Chicken Capsicum Pan Fried Momos. 

Service was prompt and food was hot when served. But the quality of both food and condiments was really poor. The sauce that came along was so hot that by the time I recovered with two glasses of cold milk, the food had gotten cold and stale. One lick of the sauce with a Dim Sham Baozi had me grasping for breath. The momos were not that good. I have had momos from street joints that were better. The Chicken Baozi was too salty. The Pan Fried Momos had too much sauce on them. The sauce should have come along, not already on them. That made the momos too soft. The Dim Sham Baozi was supposed to be their specialty, but it was tasteless. 

The only good points are delivery time and price. Food quality, condiments and overall value are really poor.

Quite a good place for having quick bites on momo! Their steamed momos are as good as the pan fried versions.. Chicken capsicum and chicken cheese are my two most favourites.. though they need to improve the quality of their momo chutney.. most of the times, it does not smell nice , most probably because of over-usage of vinegars / preservatives.. and momos do not taste good without the punch of hot chillies! I tend to avoid their soup as well, which lacks any taste or flavour.
Recently they have started keeping pulpy grape juices along with.. a good thirst quencher..

The most disappointing part of this joint is that they do not have a seating arrangement of their own. You have to carry your plates/bowls to the main food court and look for a seat.

Considering a small food joint in a mall Dumpling serves pretty good momos.  The steamed ones,  the pan fried ones, they all are equally good.  I try out almost all that is there in the menu. But one thing that always bothers me is that there is no sitting arrangement.  I would have considered that had it been only a "take away"  food joint.

We went to DP for a movie and were very hungry as it was noon time. So decided have something quickly. And what is better than momos. We ordered schezuan steamed momos. They were very tasty. The outer covering was thin and the filling had ample chicken. Served with sauce and soup, the momos are complete bliss. But i would like it even more if the soup would have been a bit better, it was a bit bland in taste. Another problem is that they don't have any sitting arrangement. So people ordering thukpa or multiple items, it would be hard for them to stand and eat. So I'm deducting 1. 5 for that. Else it is a very good eatery and i will surely visit there next time.

Another great place near my house serving delectable momos. Whenever i visit diamond plaza,this small food stall is a must for me to drop by. Have been there a number of times but never untracked myself from their appetizing pan fried chicken momos. Though they charge 80rs for a plate of momos containing 5 pieces only without making any sort of seating arrangements which i feel to some extent is a waste of money....still the long lasting,appeasing taste of this particular item drags me here again and again. Love their momos...would surely like to try some other items here,hope they would come up with some solutions regarding the seating arrangements.

Had their Momo's in one of my visits to Diamond Plaza Mall. The momos come with soup & 2 dips too (mayo dip & a chili garlic dip). Tried both the Chicken & Veg options, they were extremely tasty & filled to capacity unlike most of the options available in the city. Service was quick too, was also lucky to meet the courteous owners of the place.

I have been a fan of Wow Momo's, Dumpling would easily give WOW a run for their money.. :)

We ordered a plate of Chicken Pan Fried Momo in Tomato Garlic sauce. There was no seating arrangement and on top of that the momos were below average quality, like those served at most of the roadside stalls, with little amount of chicken in a heap of onions. The sauce tossed with a few dices of onion and capsicum was better than the momo fillings and it was the sauce that made the momos eatable. I was really taken aback as this place has generally favourable reviews. I would not recommend this joint unless you are truely starving.

Ordered the Pan fried Mushroom Momo alongwith a Chocolate Momo. We were tired and famished.Despite this place lacking a seating arrangement,we hoped the momo would compensate for our tired legs.Unfortunately it was not to be and I had below par experience here.
The momo was substandard and the sauce was ordinary.The chocolate momo was worse with the chocolate sauce heavily burnt and the whole snack just left me wanting for a quick sip of coke.
I wouldn't recommend this eating joint.

Not really excited to write something for this place. Was looking forward to some real good momo, though had read the reviews before visiting. Here they call the fried momo as Kothay but it is totally different.  I tried the cheese and chicken schezwan momo but hardly found any momo. I missed the momo sauce. Not happy with the momo. Just one good thing people who look for less spicy stuff would find the momo better as the sauce is less spicy

I like this place for a quick bit after shopping and movie in DCN ¬†mall- as it is known popularly. The service is quick. The momo is really soft and good. little bit high priced at around Rs. 70 per plate for a plate of chicken steamed momo (5 pc). they also give a small portion of clear soup. its yummy. The only problem is there is no place to sit. you will have to carry your plate and will have to sit in the nearby food court. If you do not mind that then this is place is really good. I personally do not like the pan fried momo but i have heard that pan fried momos are also good here.

Situated in Diamon Plaza, Dumpling is an absolute favourite. 
The steamed momo is average, nothing special. The price is decent. So no complaints there.
The pan-fried momo is something which I don't like at dumplings. We asked them to make it spicy, but what we received was not at all spicy. It was rather full of tomato sauce, and entirely dominated the dish, and for me, it was totally a disaster.
But what still makes me visit them, almost everytime I visit Diamond Plaza, is their thupka. Lovely hot steaming thupka, with nice chunky bits of chicken, and the correct amount of spice. On rainy days, or when its cold, this is an absolute bliss.
Although I do have one complaint. When they started out, they provided a good amount of soup with the thupka. But they have drastically reduced the amount now. It would be great to get back the old thupka, if possible.

Love the thukpa in this place for 100 bucks with chicken in it, it is so worth it. ¬†The momos are delicious and yum and served with interesting mouth watering dips and worth the price. ¬†The quantity ¬†totally justifies the price and has a selection of some interesting versions of momo. I usually opt for the steamed ones but the pan fried momos also taste good.
¬†There is quite a crowd in the evening and a rush and can take a while to get your order.
¬†I enjoy eating momos here when I visit the mall and also take parcels. This is quite good in terms of quantity and taste.

On the 4th floor of Diamond Plaza Mall ,Jessore Road is the Dumpling Momos situated.
They make great momos all spicy and delicious.
There you can get momos fried and steamed also thupkas ,wantons ,and even momos inside burger.
I tried out the capsicum momos which were very hot and spicy which got tears to my eyes.
The price is quite reasonable .
If you love momos and spicy food then this is your place.
But one problem is that there is no place to sit with your momos you have to stand and have and if you purchase anything from the food court then you can sit  and have 'em.

This place is really close to me n i have been there a couple of times. 
Here's my explained unbiased review

--Location--
Situated in Rodkol Diamond Plaza Mall on the 3rd floor

--Ambience--
No place to dine in so enjoy your food while standing n chatting. 

--Quality n Quantity--
I tasted almost everything on their menu but Pan Fried Chicken Momo is my favorite. I would recommend this to everyone. The quality is good for other dish also n the quantity is enough for a single person

--Pricing--
180-200 INR is enough for a couple but the price should a lil less, like pan fried chicken momo should have been around 60instead of 80, cz we have to stand while eating n in that price its not hard to find another momo place within Nagerbazar where we can sit also to enjoy our food.. 

So in Conclusion good food but no place to dine in
Definitely worth a try for everyone.

Momos are among my most favourite of dishes and I often can't resist but to have a plate full of this delightful dish whenever I come across a momo shop. I've loved this dish ever since I first had it in Darjeering during my early childhood, when it wasn't very popular in other parts of the country. Thus when I saw this place open in the mall nearest to my home, it was an obvious choice to go there and try it.I've eaten here almost everytime I've been to this mall to watch a movie.
The first thing that I like about this place is their fast service. I've never had to wait much for my order. The momos though not the best I've had are definitely quite satisfying. Though it may seem quite expensive compared to the other options available just outside the mall on the other side of the road, it's definitely worth the money due to their contrasting difference in the level of hygiene. Personally I always recommend to choose hygiene over taste as health is more important than pleasure. This place however does not provide any sort of seating arrangements which was a bit disappointing as its not easy to just stand with a plate full of hot steamed momos on your hand or a bowl of hot thukpa. Also some of the dishes like the chicken thukpa wasn't very impressive. Apart from that this is a nice place.

It reminded me of an instance when I had got the first opportunity to try Thukpas in Gangtok... These guys have just brought the same taste and flavour to the City of Joy... That perfect blend of herbs, spices and those typical red chili flakes sprinkled thereon must be admired... Kudos to Dumpling Momos‚Ä¶

went there today after watching a movie at the pvr. we ordered for a chicken mushroom panfried momo (rs.75) and a chicken thukpa (rs.95). after ordering we found out they have absolutely no seating arrangement  :(  was greatly disappointed as one could not simply place the smoking hot thukpa served in a aluminium bowl on his hands. momos are manageagble though. when asked they pointed out to a board written in a gel pen only below their menu board. one cannot see it unless pointed out because its below their menu board and falls upto a man's waist only and if other customers are standing there and ordering then i am 200% sure one cannot see it simply. they should hang their board somewhere above so that one can easily see it, according to me. our total bill was rs. 170.
anyway the panfried chicken mushroom momo was good. but the thukpa was totally gross, absolutely filthy. it does not have  a good taste, its full of red chillies, too much spicy and the same sauce they have put in the fan fried momo. for the first time i tasted a thukpa so rich and chilly in taste. basically they have just enlisted more than 35-40 items in their list showing their variety, but the quality is very bad, their all preparations taste almost the same as they put the same sauce in almost each item. my suggestion is to avoid unless one is in a hurry as they don't take much time to serve. only steamed momos are good. they serve a little amount of soup with steamed momos.
