Tawa a small food joint located in Behala , okay for snacks and small nibbles.  Have ordered the special Mughalai Paratha couple of times. ( Mughlai parathas and Rolls are edible) They have a home delivery service as well. Once did a mistake of ordering some Indian -Chineese.
Pricing cheap and food below average. Again it's you get what you pay :-) Don't expect customer service of any sort, a cranky old man sits at the small counter who suffers major mood swings. 

Will I visit again ? ---  Naaahhh Doubt It , May be will order Mughlai parathas over phone if nothing is available.

Tawa is good for casual hangouts and cheap dinners. The CHICKEN HAKKA CHOW is typical Calcutta style Chinese and I really enjoy it. ¬†The CHICKEN KABIRAJI is oily but tasty enough. What came as a surprise was the MUGHLAI PARANTHA, it was actually quite good. The best dish here however is the CHIILLI CHICKEN. It's dry spicy and tangy soft chicken pieces. It is a good place to order from and visit once in a while.

For cheap, light on the pocket Indian Chinese, Mughlai & rolls. Its the usual run of the mill small 'restaurant' and nothing special about it. When you are really hungry or you need to order out for a simple dinner at home for friends/relatives.

Food quality is okay. Prices are reasonable. Its easy to afford. Services needs to improve. Qualties could have been better. There's nothing about interior.

Basically I just love their food. Mostly its take away. The place is quite cheap for light pocketers. Speciality is definitely their Mughlai Paratha. Just go grab one for yourself.

It's not something to eat out at, but if you're kinda hungry, dont hesitate to grab a quick roll here. They don't have really good food, but what finger food they have is good, or fine.. :P

This is the first time I'm reviewing a restaurant without tasting the food. Allow me to justify my act.

We decided to have a supper here quite late at night (around 10). Don't let the fancy neon lights fool you, for, the ambience clearly spells out disappointment. Looks like a very unhygienic place. There was a dirty cleaning mop on the table, which the cleaner/waiter had no hurry to remove. Thumbs down.

I was dehydrated to the core, and gasped for water, but the management couldn't care lesser. I had to ask for water three or four times before I got a sip.

I still decided to stay put and have my meal, since it was light on my pocket. But within a few moments, I heard a cacophony of voices at the cash counter. The owner was screaming at the top of his lungs at a customer. And naturally, there was also a wailing infant (there always is). Now I don't know who was at fault, and I don't even care. But eating at such a disgusting environment was out of the question.

We picked up our bags, paid for the water bottle, and walked out, never to return.

A great food joint around the corner in your neighbourhood in Behala. Located on Bonomali Naskar Road at a walking distance from Behal Thana Crossing on Diamond Harbour Road, this food joint surprises you with the tasty food it dishes out at really pocket friendly prices.

Keeping the legacy of Kolkata Moghlai Paratha alive, they serve mouth watering Moghlai Parathas at amazing prices. The Special Paratha stuffed with Mutton Keema is a delicious snack to sink your teeth into. The aloo sabji they serve with the paratha is also tasty as an accompaniment.¬†

The Chinese section also deserves special mention as they serve a really tasty and sumptuous Chinese fare. Had their Gravy Noodles and Chilli Chicken Lot Pot which were really filling and tasty. Also you should try their Fish Fry and Kabiraji. Reminds you of the good old food joints of Kolkata. Would definitely keep going back to try out their different fares also in the Indian Section.

Small outlet with good service & serving..

it is more Like a Cabin rather than a Restaurant..
with wooden chairs and tables...

and what I really like is their Ordering and Serving procedure is very convenient and systematic . . .

they generate a handwritten token while ordering.. and the waiters call out with the coupon no. when your order is prepared (much like Dominos etc.), but the charge only after your dine completes, not at the ordering time...

and now lets come to the food...
nothing such outstanding to have a special dine-in.. ¬†
but it's good to have some food while hungry..

Fast Food Centre, rather. Food is average. Prices are low. Perfect place to get snacks. Rolls are good. Otherwise, nothing special, okayish.

It used to be an airy, open take away counter once, I don't know what made them renovate to an enclosed area now. I do not like that to start with. The food is average. Prices are low, so it's value for money. Good for quick take away as their service time is pretty fast.

A small still quite nice place visited it yesterday with my cousins after a long time. Now i was surprised to see that they had renovated and it looks good not that old and shabby any more. We were very hungry and ordered Chicken Prawn Fried Rice, Chicken Manchurian and a plate of chicken fried momo. The food was satisfactory and cheap. Maybe visiting again sometime.

Slowest restaurant in the world!!! It takes ages for even dishes like momos!!! Food quality is ok... But the serving time kills it... Go there only if you have ages to spare.

A very nice place. It's the nearest food joint from my home. With an impressive home delivery service, you just need to call them up, place the order, tell your address and sit back and relax. Food will be delivered within 45 minutes. Though they take some time if you ask for some unusual dishes but they are pretty fast with the mainstream stuffs. Recently i just returned home for my diwali vacations after an year and saw that the restaurant has been renovated. Just the next day ordered some fried momos and they were superb as usual. No complaints. Though they have increased the prices this time, great food for a takeaway and home deliveries.

This is a very old place and it is currently shut and under renovation. I am not sure as when they are going to be open but I am eagerly waiting for the same.

Of the dishes I really liked the steamed and fried momo and the rolls. The chowmin used to be a bit oily so always avoided that. Fish kobiraji was also ok.

quite surprising that this food joint..which seems to have existed since ever...and has made up to the "favourite" list of so many people..has not been reviewed yet!!!! This is a place,i have grown up with... a place which i pass by every day..pretty much near my house..and quite popular..an old name..in catering to the snacks cravings of people...

What i love the most of this age old outlet is the Mughlai .and Fish kobiraji...yeah right...that semi extinct bengali delicacy of Kobiraji..is still available from this outlet...and that too....in a delicious avatar
The mughlai is perfect..and mouthwatering...and its one of the many popular dishes from the place...
I often order from here..to cater for a semi large gathering at home...delivery is fast..and prices are reasonable compared to the quality of food served....
and I'm all the more delighted to find that the place is finally under renovation...at last..one can sit there and chomp on the goodies comfortably...which previously was a bit difficult..given the dearth of proper seating arrangement..anyhow..this place has been an all time favourite and shall continue to remain so..
