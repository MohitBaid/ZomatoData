Very very horrible food. I took smoked chicken pizza and all of my family members including me has got food poisoning. We will remember this night forever. This restaurant should be shut down immediately due to its bad ,harmful and poisonous food.

Ordered food through Swiggy from this cafe situated in the Baghajatin station road.We ordered boneless chicken pakora, mixed sauce chicken pasta and chef special chicken italian pizza..
The chicken pakora was tasty and juicy but dint like the green chutney they served. The pizza was good but would have been better if the crust was made more thin.The pasta was also nice but would love to have more sauce and less dry. Food was good and would love to visit the cafe for a nice experience.

English breakfast: this is sufficient for someone who eats less. The quality of food and taste is very good. The chicken sausages are soft and delicious. The ommlete is good too. The slices of bread should be more.

8" smoked chicken pizza: the pizza wasn't that good. It could have been better but good for a hungry tummy. Plus no oregano was provided.

This new place has become my new haunt for gorging breakfast.I typically order the English breakfast, which is quite filling quantity wise  and a great value for money, Plus I also like their pizzas,which are not wow but they surely does justice to it if you like thin crust pizza.Their eggs toast(forgot the correct term) are also quite good and healthy based on the fact that they use brown bread and the prices are also quite cheap.

Ordered through swiggy from this cafe. So Don't know about the location and ambience.
I ordered one chicken cheese and mayo sandwich and a strawberry shake. The food was well packed. The sandwich was tasty with good amount of chicken and cheese filling and perfectly grilled and served with French fries and ketchup.
The strawberry shake was also very good. Very Much Refreshing And Well flavoured.
Food quality is good. Pocket friendly Price.
Will visit next time. Highly Recommended.

Cheers!!
