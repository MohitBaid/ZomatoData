Went there just to grab a cup of coffee with a friend. Ended up spending two hours gossiping over coffee,pasta and marble cake. I liked the idea of a small sitting arrangement outside overlooking the by lanes of Deshapriya.
Also, do drop in to check out their pretty clothing line if you're in mood for some shopping.

A very impressive location, just adjacent to the legendary Priya cinema... 
BUT that's it... that is the only 'plus' of this cafe... apart from average quality beverage (I ordered a cold coffee with chocolate sauce), it pained to see the myopic behaviour of the owner/attendant... 
unfortunately, my wife had accompanied me, and given her wide exposure to diverse cultures, it pained to¬†be at the receiving end of¬†traces of discriminatory behaviour...

A small yet pretty cafe and store located right beside Deshapriya Park. Outdoor seating is beautiful. Ordered for green tea and cappuccino. Both the items were average. They provide biscuits with the beverages. That's a good thing about this place. The store is also pretty good. Washroom is clean. The doodle on the wall is the best thing about this place.

Quaint little cafe in a shop! Was quite happy to see the graffiti by Debasish Deb on the walls. Nostalgic memories from childhood magazines after all.
It‚Äôs a very small setup and limited capacity. They have seating in the small verandah as well - made a mental note to visit during winters.
Food and beverage is good and liked the sandwiches. Quite filling. 
Price wise quite okay!

A small cozy little cafe cum store near Priya Cinema and Desapriya Park. It has a good feel and vibe....when you enter. The decor speaks to you, the painting on the wall and other Knick knacks of the store add to the ambience. The food items are limited but whatever they serve ..... it's well presented and delicious. The masala omlette is served up with toasted bread and tea with biscuits. They also have some cool beverages. The boutique and cafe concept is really trending right now....being a win win for all. You visit the cafe and browse in the boutique, buy something that catches your eye. Or you visit the boutique and decide to sip a cup of coffee,tea or something cold.
Lovely place.Visit definitely recommended.

What I loved most about this place was the overall aesthetics. Yes the coffee and food was great and very reasonably priced but more than that, it was the ambience and interiors that made it different from the rest. The accompanying store, the artwork all around, the seating arrangements, the architecture, are all very intriguing and gives the whole place a special kind of vibe that you would only understand once you visit it, preferably alone to take some time off from your busy schedule or with a small group of friends. Oh and the service is fast as well.

A quaint place in the city. Lovely ambience. If you are looking for some pure "adda" this is the place for you. I went there with few of my friends. Ordered chicken nuggets, chicken fingers and cheese fingers. I loved the cheese fingers specially because nuggets and all are pretty usual.. Cheese fingers had some mashed potatoes filling which I being a potato lover loved. They served these with their home made mayo dibs which was excellent. Also, we ordered some chicken pasta in white sauce which in my opinion was standard. There were baby corns in the pasta which of course was a surprise for me, coz I always had the usual pasta. I loved it though. But the best part was the soda shikanji.. And it was the most refreshing thing in this sweltering heat. The prices are moderate. Looking forward to visit this place again. :)

It is not a profoundly exotic place. But a 'nice', cozy one, all welcome for hushed-conversations or crowded discussions!! One can spent some alone-time or gang up here!! The store is a mel√°nge of innovation! The menu might not seem very versatile, though. But a good time being spent is an assurance! üòä

Magenta is located beside Deshapriya Park, behind Priya Cinema - very accessible from the main road. It is a boutique (concept store) with a cafe attached to it. ¬†The cafe itself is small but has a homely feel to it. The art work by Debashish Deb and the elegant chandelier made out of coffee mugs gives it a very unique look.¬†

The food is yummy and the cold coffee is to die for. (I had 2 the last time I went.)¬†

The ambiance is great. I especially liked sitting in the balcony, enjoying the weather.¬†

Overall, its a great place to hang out with a couple of friends.

P.S. you also get a chance to look at and buy a wide range of handmade, organic products at the adjacent boutique.

At a distance of 10mins from kalighat metro station , will you find this cafe. Magenta just opened in May, and has a tiny cafe attached to a boutique. If you want a view of Deshapriya Park, then the balcony is a great spot {if it isn‚Äôt raining}. Tea starts at INR 45, coffee at INR 50. They have a range¬†of dishes to munch on, including sandwiches, salads, omelettes and finger food.
I personally feel they should work on their dishes a bit more but if you go by the ambience and of course the decor , it's an A+
What we ordered: cold coffee , strawberry shake , French fries , classic chicken cheese sandwich , egg mayo sandwich .
Taste: 3.5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Value for money: 3.5/5

The pastel decors of the place really gives you a very nice feel.
The seating area is very less and you cannot go here with a big group .
I said on the balcony and the view is nice from there .
It gives you a homely feeling yet somehow too much space had been allotted for the store and less for cafe .
If you are around this area and have nothing to do for some time you can visit here.

Magenta is an awesome and one of the best ambience cafe in the town... the owner is very sweet and an humble person.. the service is great and the quality of food is just awesome. You people should try the chicken nuggets and also the strawberry milk shake.. it's worth it.. their own baked pastries and cakes are also great to eat and very tasty... overall I give this cafe a 5 upon 5 and you all should try this place

Magenta is located in a quiet neighbourhood near deshapriyo park. The place is perfect for a quiet yet relaxing getaway. Also has a balcony if you want to sit in there. The hospitality of the staff was really good and she was quiet attentive. I would totally recommend this for a date or a small outing.

Went for the first time, and was amazed by every single bit of everything! The interior, the hospitality, the food! There is space in the balcony also, to enjoy the weather. The caf√© is accompanied by a boutique as well! The decor is innovative and has a unique touch of soul! The art by Debasish Deb adds extra grandeur. All the food items are homemade and are yummy! I had chicken nuggets, chicken fingers, masala tea(customise it yourself, with milk, if u want to) and cold coffee with extra chocolate! The complentary home baked piece of cake was a delight! üòç The less talked and newly opened caf√© should be a must visit place for all!

In search of a cafe near Priya cinema, me and my friend found this place on zomato...it's just beside Deshopriyo park and behind Priya cinema...It is a cafe cum boutique like (more of a concept store)..Starting from the entrance the decor will definately catch your attention for sure..the two mirrors on the staircase, the beautiful pastel pink and turquoise colored wall with matching decor, the huge illustration by famous cartoonist Debashish Deb, the big chandelier made out of glass cups everything portray uniqueness at its best..the owners and the staff were very courteous, attentive and helpful...A small cozy place with nice and calm ambience...It has also a sitting arrangement in the balcony... coming to the food, we ordered One Grilled chicken cheese sandwich (‚Çπ 120), One Hot Dog (‚Çπ 95) with Green lemon tea (‚Çπ 45) and Latte (‚Çπ 70)..The beverages were perfect and the food was quite decent ...The menu is simple and sufficient and the service was on point...The prices were reasonable with no extra additional taxes..Ohh I almost forgot, they served our beverages with a piece of homemade delicious cake which had increased the flavour to the next level.. Overall a very nice unique place (with homely feeling) to have long chat over food without any disturbances...Will definitely visit again..
