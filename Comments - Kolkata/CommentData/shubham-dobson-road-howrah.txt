I have only tasted the Chowmin. The quantity was not upto my expectation and the quality? Well, Homemade chowmin are far better than this place.

Shubham opened last year and is located opposite to Ghas Bagan near Dobson Road. The place is located in the ground floor of the building and is huge in size. The place is actually a food court with Al-carte menu option as well. The menu comprises of North Indian, South Indian and Chinese food options. The ambiance is decent and everything is in white here. What I dont like about this place is that you have to order before hand and without a receipt you dont get anything. 

We went here to try the North Indian food. We ordered the Veg Jalfrezi and the Paneer Pasanda along with different type of breads. The Veg Jalfrezi had an excellent preparation while the Paneer Pasanda was decent with rich gravy and large deep fried paneer pieces. We tried these curries with Masala Kulcha, Naan and Tandori Roti. We then ordered the Veg Palao which came in almost a minute! It was the same dish from the food counter which was prepared few hours back. They should atleast prepare fresh for all customers. 

The Verdict:
Food/Taste ‚Äì 6/10
Service/Hospitality ‚Äì 6/10
Value for Money ‚Äì 6/10
Ambiance ‚Äì 6/10
Quantity/Quality ‚Äì 6/10

Decent place and decent food!

Good place for vegetarian food quality is Average but since the place offers only veg food i didn't find it too interesting . The ambience is nice it is located on dobson road near Ghas Bagan but still is quite separate from rest of the restaurant visit this place if you are vegetarian üëç

I visited this place today and found it good.It was calm and peaceful,as there were only few people.we ordered a chinese thali and a north Indian thali.The chinese thali was good.I loved the salad kind of thing given.It was yum.The manchurian balls were properly cooked so as the rice and hakka noodles .I found the chilli paneer a bit over saucy.It tasted like tomato ketchup mixed with cornflour only.Tge north indian thali was good...The kulcha was soft and hot.The veggues were tasty and so as the rice.All in all it was a good experience.üòä

Amazing vegetarian food. They have a variety of delicacies and all of them are worth a try. Best value for money. On weekends there's huge rush therefore service delays.
