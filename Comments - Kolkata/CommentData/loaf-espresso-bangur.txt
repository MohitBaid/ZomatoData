Tiny place, but, real good tasty offerings. Also, an evening hangout place. Value for money and good people to visit. Try it, you might start coming back.

A little coffee shop located near Bangur’s market place. It was open when all the food shops in the locality were closed. A good place for hangout and grabbing a quick snack. The price was minimal.

A cup of coffee after a good movie and a deep conversation can change everything. :')

I went there just to have coffee as we wanted to talk.

We took two chocolate Cappuccino and one white sauce pasta.

Both tasted good.

Specially the coffee was fabulous.

I ordered cheese corn sandwich.
The food tasted good but not up to the mark.
But still this is a well recommended place for vegetarians.

I had gone there when they had just started. On the owner's recommendation, I tried the garlic bread and I found them to be just decent. But I was very impressed with the personal attention being given by the owner to the customers. Keep it up.

This is one amazing place in Bangur. Newly opened this place already our heart. Very light on pocket but such great hangout spot. 
They got a rustic ambience, great to visit during evening, usually crowded but you'll get a seat eventually and you'll understand why the wait is worth it. They got small tables and chairs but overall cosy! 
They make amazing coffee! 
We took one latte and one cappuccino, chilli cheese toast which tasted amazing and a Vada pav which tasted average though! 
Will visit soon!

First look at this place will create a willing to try the place. It looks like a little French cafe. The seatings are comfy and walls look nice with paintings n writings.
The staff are courteous.
The menu is a limited one at a very reasonable price. We ordered coffee latte and coffee mocha, pasta in white sauce and garlic bread. All were good especially the coffees. They also offer strong and regular options in coffees. The con I find is that, they can work on the presentation of their serving.
        All over a good experience. Would like to come back for their coffees.

A small cafe in the heart of bangur avenue where a few years back the concept of cafe was quite a novelty. This is However my first visit to loaf espresso and quite accidentally. My early birthday treat proved to be goodish. We ordered kiwi shake and butterscotch shake to start with. The first one being less sweet and the latter sweeter, I preferred the former. These were followed by Alfredo pasta, corn sandwich and brownie without walnut. Pasta was very creamy but a bit bland so we had to sprinkle oregano and chilly flakes. The sandwich tasted fine. Brownie was a really good conclusion to our gastronomical tour. All in all, a good experience.

The ambience aped the usual uptown cafes but kept it minimalistic. Though better background music will accentuate the charm of this little place and suit its decor. Service was fast and friendly. And pocket pinch was 465 in total which is cheaper than any other cafes in the posher side of the city.

A small vegeterian outlet having decent snack options is Located at Bangur area. It is just beside the Sremon guest House in the super market area.
Having cozy sitting area inside this place is having compact Menu to choose from. I really loved the decor of the Cafe looks attractive from outside and quite appealing.

Tried their sandwich and mixed sauce pasta along with some hot cappuccino coffee. All the items were decent tastewise and also the quality is moderate. Best part is they all were served fresh. Good option for on the go quick snack. They have various options in maggie as well.

Great things come in small packages is what this place can be defined as, too little but has the potential.

They bake their brownies fresh on each and every order, though I would love them served without the extra choclate sause which makes it more sweet then desired. Pizzas here are good. Come here for sandwiches and this place won't disappoint you, having tried mostly all, it won't be fair just baording about one or two.

Didn't try any beverages and coffe here as I don't generally get a seat to enjoy my coffe as its usually full, thanks to its so little space, but will surely love to try it on my coming visits.

We visited this small cafe on a Sunday evening and it was gushing with crowd which is a good thing to see for a new eatery specially in this area!
We ordered a mixed sauce pasta, paneer ytikka pizza and crunchy frappe!
Mixed sauce pasta was tasty and creamy but the quantity of red sauce was little less. 
Pizza was nice too with the perfect cheesy kick but we feel it was a little highly priced for such a small one.
Crunchy frappe was a little extra sweet which we do not appreciate much. 
The place gives a very energetic vibe and the management is pretty good, but they can surely work a little on the presentation of food.

Preety offbeat cafe for a place like bangur I would have ever expected..
But after a few months of repeated visit I Cudnt wait to share my experience that is not of a day but over mnths.

As am a lover of coffee it isn't a tough thing to understand a good fresh brewed mug of coffee and this place exactly serves it.
The best coffee I have had in this whole city "MIND IT DEY GRIND THE COFFEE BEANS RIGHT INFRNT OF U AND SERVE U THE COFFEE"
It is to die for!!!

The wide variety of food,and everything almost comes with a twist has its own unique taste that is amazing.
Starting fr their sandwiches which is so filling n good,to the fusion via pavs to the pasta to the Maggi to the pizza.

The cafe itself gives me a old school British cafe charm with modern interiors.small,cozy friendly welcoming ambience and amazing Staff

All in all I Cudnt find one reason to mark this place below 5/5.
I can vouch on this, this cafe within the upcoming months gonna b one of the most successful cafe of kolkata.
A MUST VISIT FOR ONE AND ALL. REALLY WORTHED.

The pizza was a disaster! It said it would be 10 inches. But it was only 6 inches wide. Who does that? Seriously?
The vada pav was bad. Didn't like it. The burger was messed up as well. There was hardly any cheese. The packets are the only thing that looks nice. Else, all thumbs down.
