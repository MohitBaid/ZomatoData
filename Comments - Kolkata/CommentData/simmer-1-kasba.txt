They take order over phone. But they never deliver.  If you want to call them back after 2 hrs of placing yhe order.. you will find the  number is switched off!!!! On trying to call them again in the evening to ask why the delivery was not made inspite of taking order over phone n confirminf te same.. they just keep silent n cut the phone. PATHETIC

A small and dull roadside joint that serves South Indian cuisine. Nothing really exciting about this place, just standard South Indian menu mainly comprising of Dosas. There are not many options to chose from. They do have a few chaats like Papdi Chaat and Mixed Chaat but they just taste too ordinary. Seating arrangement is a few plastic chairs on the pavement and that's it. Best to opt for a takeaway as it is really uncomfortable to eat dosas sitting there. Pricing is quite reasonable. Cleanliness is average, not the cleanest.
