Good place for quality food at affordable prices, specially combos and snacks. Students will find it pocket friendly. I had a chicken Mughlai parantha and chicken fried momo. The monos were as per standard and quite good in terms of quality and quantity. As for the Mughlai they were equally good and with a fine balance of spices, chicken and egg. So overall a pocket friendly option.

I won't even give that one star to begin with, the food quality is so poor , no taste no minimum seasoning. Horrible packaging . Do not take the risk .. not worth your money ..

Maa Trinayani is a small eatery. Have tried their Chinese combos and paratha combos and also their fried items and Mughlai Parantha as well. Honestly the food is quite ordinary nothing special about it. If you have a big list of guest visiting your place you may order it from here as it will not make a big hole in your pocket

Not so good experience. I have ordered pan fried momo. The taste was good but I found a nail in it! Yes you heard it right. I have called the owner. He sent one of his boy to enquiry and the boy himself ensure that it was a nail bit the owner was not ready to accept it. He instead was making excuses. At some extent I had an argument with him and then he offered me a free meal!
Wish I could mark in negative.

It's basically a take away joint located at Jadavpur.

No points for ambience.

Service is nice.

Tried their fish fingers & Egg Chicken roll, both were average, nothing special. 

Quantity is good with a reasonable price tag.

Aree wah! That's what I said when I gave the first bite in to the Special Chicken Mughlai that I had ordered¬†via Swiggy. I was, frankly speaking, not¬†quite confident while placing the order but it was a 'mughlai craving' attack and this was the only place offering the same.

And around for Rs.100/- this moghlai was awesome. Not at all oily, not refried types. The accompaniments were also good although the¬†quantity of the curry¬†should be increased at least by 30% or they can¬† add a customization option whereby I can order extra curry, salad etc.

And recently I was surprised to find through a mail from Swiggy, that this particular dish was the 3rd most ordered item via Swiggy in my area!!! (Ruby-Acropolis)

Will be ordering again... and again.

Thanks.

Ordered fried rice manchurian chicken and lollipop combo. Quantity is no doubt too good and sufficient in a very reasonable price. Food quality is not as expected the rice used have a obnoxious smell. Chicken manchurian also has a smoky smell. Not satisfied with the quality need to improve it a lot.

This joint is just a stone's throw away from my home. Thus keep getting from here, majorly on a take-away basis. The food is decent. I CANNOT eat spicy food. But in spite of my regular instructions of making the food non-spicy, they end being their normal spicy self. My father loves their Fried Momos and my Grandma is a fan of their Mughlai Parantha. Overall, a pocket-friendly easily accessible food joint.

Have been receiving food from them over 4 months now through Swiggy!! I really like their Paneer Shai Korma which has a buttery smooth white gravy with cashew paste and a few raisins here and there, just awesome! Had their Chicken Drumsticks all variants which are ok, Had their Noodles nothing great, I didn't like their Mughlai Paratha though, Their Chicken Kohlapuri is my another favourite! Quantity is generally decent, price to quality ratio is average.

I discovered this food joint few days back. Since then I have been ordering a variety of dishes from here at least once a week. Not to mention, I am a lazy bone some times and don't feel like cooking food at home. Most of their Chinese dishes are more or less of same taste though they have a list full of fancy names. The Chinese main course such as the fried rice or noodles are very blunt and tasteless. Craving for pan fried noodles once I ordered it and not knowing what the dish is like (because they don't have it in their menu)  they served me mixed gravy chow. 
The starters are not worth the money. Once ordered parathas but they were so over fried that it was hard to chew. But yes, their India side dishes are more or less good. 
Overlooking all these issues I ordered mixed chow yesterday. I was left stunt after opening the box. They had given me meinfoon instead of normal noodles. The veggies were not chopped properly and were undercooked. This is not all. They forgot to scramble the egg to mix in the chow. Rather it was a sort of burnt omelette placed amidst the noodles. The chow neither had any flavor nor spices. 

I would like to suggest please recheck your orders before you take them from this joint. Seriously they have started cheating their customers like this. I would never ever get back to that place.

Home deliveries are kind of my savior when I am feeling tired, hungry and dusted all at the same time, with no wish at all to step outside the house for a bite or prepare some food myself. On one such lazy evening I ordered for home delivery from Maa Trinayani restaurant with little expectation. But the food turned to be better than I hoped.

I ordered for a chicken moghlai, chicken hakka noodles and chilli chicken. The chicken moghlai was a hit amongst all. There was plenty of chicken with every bite and the moghlai paratha was fried to perfection. The noodles and the chilli chicken were decent too. Maa Trinayani offers a decent food spread at extremely pocket pleasing prices.

I must begin by saying that I'm a lazy bone and resort to home delivery more often than I'm proud of. :P This experience was no different. My cravings for chicken mughlai was satiated by Maa Trinayani Restaurant and an online ordering app.

#Location: A small take away joint at javadpur

#Highlights of my experience:
*Delivery: Delayed.
*Packaging: Satisfactory. The Ketchup, Salad, Aloo Sabzi, Mughlai Paratha all had individual wrapping. 
*Food: Loved it. The paratha was still crispy when it reached me. Since it was coming all the way to kasba from jadavpur I was amazed. The mughlai paratha was midsized; and tasted fantastic. The chicken - small chucks and the quantity was abundant. The aloo sabzi was tasteless.

Opted for a home delivery from here via swiggy. So i ordered a fried rice combo with chicken manchurian(3 pieces) and chicken lollipop(2). Fried rice was really very good. Although the chicken pieces were good but found the taste of the gravy to be quite different. Many people may like it but personally i didn't like the taste of coriander leaves in the gravy. About the chicken lollipops, it was okayish. Quantity is indeed good. Overall average experience.

I was really craving for some Chicken Curry the Indian style so decided to order it online. My first time with the restaurant and i must say i m quiet impressed.

I ordered Chicken Kasha. It was very tasty. It was like less oily and there were 4 good pieces of meat at an equally impressive price.

I would want to go and eat at this place. Totally worth the money and the quantity.

Taken home delivery from these one yesterday... its mainly a takeaway junction... existing for long period of time...these one is probably the 3rd fast food joint opened on the same place... so decided to give it a try... we ordered....
‚óè Egg chicken roll¬ª¬ª¬ª Very good one[in comparison of the others]... tasty...
‚óè Chicken mushroom roll¬ª¬ª¬ª Very bad... the mushrooms are not at all fresh...
‚óè Chilli chicken roll¬ª¬ª¬ª Again it's a flop... the chilli chicken in it barely had any taste...
Need to be mentioned that the parathas are over fried too...
‚óè Noodles and chilli chicken combo¬ª¬ª¬ª Quantity wise it's good... but the noodles was tasteless... although the chilli chicken was tasty... the chilli chicken consists of 3 pcs of small chicken...
‚óè Special muglai paratha¬ª¬ª¬ª A small muglai paratha with average stuffing and over fried... very oily... tasted average... but the weird thing was the smell of atar in it... what a shit man... means what is the reason behind that... atar in muglai paratha... the alu sabji and salad tasted good though... but then also they need huge level of improvements...
All over it's a below average experience...
Pocket pinch was friendly...

2) Fried Rice and Chicken Manchurian Combo
3) Laccha Parantha, Chilli Chicken and Chicken Lollipop Combo
4) Pan Fried Chicken
Everything was nicely prepared. Didn't like the lollipop at all. Chilli Chicken was very good. The combo consisted of 3 pieces chicken each. The pan fried chicken had 8 pieces, it had little bit more of pepper. Otherwise it was properly done. Pocket pinch: ‚Çπ485/-. The rice and chicken combo were ‚Çπ110 each and the parantha combo was ‚Çπ130.

Looks like I am opening the innings for Maa Trinayani. Ordered steamed chicken momo from here and it was really delicious. The food was delivered within 40 mins And it was hot.. The momo stuffing was full of chicken and the soup was cooked with lots of vegetables. The soup was packed in a container( though it was charged). Overall, a fine experience..
