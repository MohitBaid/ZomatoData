I went there yesterday n I found it the best place for chitchat in a cozy environment.. The food is of nice taste like that of well known bakery but too much pocket saving.. I recommend all the college students especially students of Vivekananda college to enjoy their special time n hullor

This is a home based bakery. It is not an outlet - bakery in the first place. Whatever item you ask is made to order and customised as per your requirement. Eg: Sugar free or eggless etc. Freshly baked and delivered. (If u fall within 3 km from thakurpukur police station). Yummy tasting and made with good quality ingredients and no chemicals like they use in bakeries. Must try bakery.

Delicious fresh baked goods. I recommend it to all kolkatans who want healthy deserts at economic rates. One can indulge without feeling the extra sins! Awesome breads and cheesecakes and oat chocochip cookies. I am going to order cupcakes and garlic bread again from here for my party at home with the ladies...!

I recently took Sugar cookies in kilos from Ms.Reshma at her residence. Her Majesty's Pattiserie is basically a home bakery wherein she bakes only to orders. One can see why she is such a sought after baker in Kolkata. No fancy outlet so no establishment cost, Her Majesty's Pattiserie worked out well within my budget and all the items I took from here were just yummy! Only thing I was told repeatedly by her is that I need to confirm the order in advance but it is worth the wait! My previous orders with her include Garlic Bread (her signature bake), millet sugar cookies with fondant decoration, apple tarts and braided stuffed breads. I hear from another friend that Her Majesty's eggless cholesterol free / special sugar free bakes including cakes and cupcakes are all worth every penny. I strongly recommend all Kolkatans to go ahead and try her for your dessert craving and you will be surprised at what she will bake and bring out her door to you.P.S. one had to take out the order - no dine in. Also heardÂ home delivery has been started for short distances from here.
