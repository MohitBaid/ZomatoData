I purchased a coupon from nearbuy and went to this place, just beside Kavi Nazrul metro station.

Ambience is family time... Not bad.
Food was lower average.
They served us Chilly Chicken dry which was stinking.
Then served veg sheekh kebab which was average.

I won't like to come here again.

A normal a.c restaurant, with a mediocre decoration . The environment is fine. But the behaviour of staffs is not much friendly. The bar does not have a wide variety. Maximum of the time the one which the customer wants is not present there!

Good place to hangout in groups and also solo. The food @baraf is really good. The bar provides decent drinks and also several cocktails which must be appreciated.The dishes and starters are also very delicious and quality is decent with respect to the price. The ambiance in the bar is also very clean and sound. Also, the services provided by them is decent. I had an overall good experience every time I have visited this place. 
Hope to see you soon in this lovely place. 
Keep providing this kind of awesome services and foods. 
Cheers.

This place really let me down with it's lazy and non responsive staffs and the extreme late service..though food was good but it was overly priced and not worth paying such a bill.
Had dry Chilli chkn(it was good but quantity was a bit less)for starter...and then the main course came so late..we had mixed fried rice(nothing extra ordinary and the quantity was less again),sweet and sour chkn(it was better but quantity disappointed again), tandoori roti(this was too chewy)and kaju malai chkn(this was something that lifted the mood with both it's taste and quantity)...I wouldn't prefer dis place until u have no other choice and prefer to the Indian cuisine and tandoor which seemed better

Premium location. Good food. But expensive. U can grab some cocktails. Not perfect but ok. "Chalable" O can say.
The worst part is, they take wayyyyyyyy to long time to produce the order. And its not just one time. I visited quit a few times here. The late orders are constant.You will you finish your drink before the food is served. 
As there are not much option near the area for some more cozy place, Couples and families come here to spend some evening. Not too special not too bad.

Among the restaurants of its standard,  it will be somewhere in the top of the list.  Food is amazing and so is the service. You are supposed to have a good time there with your friends or colleagues.  Since it's a bar,  it's not advisable to go with family. There is a provision for family dining in the third floor.

This place is much common to all the residents of South Kolkata,specially the metro passengers.Its located just beside Kavi Najrul Metro Station.
Nicely decorated.Entrance is by lift.On the 3rd floor is Baraf,the bar cum restaurant.And on the 2nd floor is another different restaurant.
Nice Cosy ambience,good Waiters and equally good service.Great Food.
Try the tandoori chicken and crunchy chicken pakora.A must try.
Price is reasonable.
I am satisfied.
Reccomended.

Located near garia bazar area, this is a multi storied building having more than one restaurant in it. We had a coupon in little of baraf the last metro which us on topmost floor. Coning to ambiance and decor, its moderately lit place with properly arranged tables with no such commendable decors. When we went there it was empty with only one table full, first of all they were reluctant to serve when they heard we had offers and then they made us sit and wait for long to process with the orders. We had two beers (tuborg) with chicken 65 which we got at quite a reasonable rate in little. 
The chicken 65 had stale garlic in it and chicken pieces were kind of microscopic. So even after the servers suggestion we had that kind of food, makes me give not more than 3 stars for this place. Hope they work on it soon as the area has lot of requirements for a nice bar cum restaurants.

Decent ambiance,prompt service,awesome location right next to Kabi Nazrul Metro,pocket friendly prices are the salient features of this joint.Dropped in on a weekday afternoon.The place was relatively empty.Staff promptly attended to us.Ordered the pan fried chilly fish(basa).The dish comprised of eight soft and succulent cubes of boneless fish sauteed in a tangy sauce and laden with chopped veggies.Not too spicy.Just right amount of spices to wash down our favourite poison.Also sampled the mutton bhuna.The dish comprised of tawa fried minced meat.Not that impressive as the quantity of meat was inadequate for two people.This dish was lacklustre.Prices of drinks at this watering hole are very reasonable indeed. Large peg of Smirnoff vodka is priced at Rs 180/- while a large peg of Antiquity Blue is priced at Rs 200/-.I would say not a bad bet for drinkers residing in the Southern fringes of the city.

But yes, I can keep on visiting this place for the above mentioned reason ðŸ˜‹
They had served the platter with so much care. Everything seemed to be perfect. 
They've a new joint namely " Noodle oodle" which I haven't tried it out as yet.

I used to come here several times as it was near Kavi nazrul metro. One fine Sunday I decided to go to baraf from my home and I was wearing a shorts. I was in for a rude shock when the guard said no one wearing shorts is allowed in this bar. Hello...is this necessary? I had been to many places finer than this and I did wore a shorts in those occasions but I was allowed. This is not elite bar or a gentleman club where we need to stick to a particular dress code. This is just a place where food and drinks are available. It doesn't have any elite clientele who would mind if anybody wear a short inside that bar. Refusing a regular due to such flimsy excuse just infuriated me. There will be mo management response to this I know. But seriously guys...in this age and competition u guts stick to this....no logic at all

Went for a quick dinner on the way back home. Was stupendously hungry. We regret the decision of going there. The service was horribly S-L-O-W, and we could have eaten up the furniture instead. The decor is pretty basic. The menu is cheap but taste and quality wise the food isn't standard enough.

We were a group of 7, and the place had two more tables occupied. As it was a dry day, we ended up ordering virgin mohito and ginger & rock salt cooler. The drinks were served 30 minutes after the order was placed, and we were half dead with hunger. The mohito was green in color and tasted like cough syrup. The ginger-salt drink had no trace of ginger in it. It tasted exactly like masala thump's up; at least drinkable.

For dinner we had ordered mixed gravy noodles, veg chili garlic noodles, dry chili chicken, and crispy fried potato in hot basil. After 15 minutes the waiter informed us that the potato dish was unavailable. Seriously? Potato is unavailable? We settled for a mixed veg dish.

The food appeared after half an hour more. Yes, you read that correct. We thank our stars that we were still alive to eat. Anyway, the gravy noodles was extremely underseasoned and bland. Why does a gravy chowmein have to have no taste and must be mixed with humongous quantity of ketchup to make it edible. The dry chili chicken was too dry and too basic, so was the mixed veg. The chili garlic noodles was indeed tasty.

I would have given a 1 rating. +0.5 for the chili garlic noodles.

This place is hardly 15 minutes away from my house earlier it was known as Babumoshai and now known as Bafar near Kavi Nazrul Metro Station. A bar cum restaurant but not as good as it were before. 

I went there completely drenches one Sunday evening ordered for Few bottles of Budweiser Beer served with nuts and bhujia along with sliced ginger and black salt. 

I also ordered for Dry Chilli Chicken, Cheese Chicken Kebabs and Dry Chicken Balls. 

Dry Chilli Chicken was very good in taste. 

Chicken Cheese Kebabs was average


But the Dry Chicken Balls were burnt and was awful in taste. 

The service was slow and the waiters were reluctant. 

Overall a pathetic experience.

Being very close to my house, Baraf has been my to-go place for random alcohol cravings. I frequent this place often for an evening with friends or to grab a drink or two when alone. With barely any other decent bar cum restaurant around this area, Baraf is truly a gem in terms of food, hospitality & pocket-pinch.Â 

Location & Ambience : The Last Metro has a great location right in the middle of the hustle bustle of Garia just beside the metro station. The ambience is quite good. During the day time, there's plenty of natural light and after dusk, it transforms into a drinking zone with blue ambient lights. The lighting, in my opinion, could be better. It's decently spacious with comfortable seating arrangements. There is provision for live sports screening as well. (Rating : 4/5)

Staff & Service : I went through the reviews and noticed quite a few people have complained about the hospitality and service here. I beg to differ. Not being a biassed regular, but the staff here has been cordial right from my first visit. They are friendly, prompt and can be helpful in suggesting you the best dishes according to your taste. The service becomes slow during rush hours, but hey! If you are here to grab a couple of drinks, what's the hurry? (Rating : 4/5)

Food : I've tried a lot of dishes they serve and most of them were quite good. Honestly, some are exceptionally good, while some just average. I would like to mention here that once I found a fish preparation smelly half-way into it. On pointing it out, they apologised, promptly took it away and served me another lip-smacking chicken preparation without any extra charge. I personally like their stir-fried chicken sausages, most Chinese side dishes and some kebabs. (Rating : 3.5/5)

Value for Money : Delightfully light on the pocket. With a nice ambience & decent food along with reasonably priced alcohol, its a steal. If you are around garia and looking for a place to hangout with friends over drinks and food, this is a Must Try! (Rating : 4/5)

The staffs are cordial but little lazy and less attentive to the guests. Food quality is moderate and so is the taste, it is okayish. Portions served are good. Chicken fried rice had prolific amount of chicken bits. Items served in the starters are better than the gravy items in the main course.

Visited the place on the day my college exam ended. Me & my friend visited there in our shorts ðŸ˜‚ as we had plans to grab something from FL shop but thought of giving Baraf a try! 
The beer was priced average and the dry Chilli chicken was too good combo with it. 
The service was not so good though, we had to shout out several times to get a waiter, the smoking zone outside the place was also a bad option.

A good place in Garia to booze with friends. There are no such restaurant cum bar near by . I like the food as well as the service was quite good. Most specifically what I like about this place is that they put a bit of attention on the plating and the garnish.

Had a good range of hard drinks. Food can be said to be average, not something very finger licking. Yes, one thing to be liked is the ambience of the place for sure.

Ambience is good, good food. They need to work out on serving. Like putting up spoons, forks, knife and tissue paper on the table. Customers should not be asking for it. Rest all is good.

Baraf is a re-branded version of Babumoshay. We did a take out but took much longer, possibly due to all the crews were busy decorating for the valentine's day evening rush. 
They serve Chinese and Indian cuisine of which we ordered the Indian dishes. Yakhni Pulao was awesome, it's basically a lite version of biriyani with tiny mutton chunks. It tastes unique and awesome. Sultani Pulao was good as well. It's vegetarian, with dry fruits and paneer.
Mutton and chicken main dishes were nice but nothing extra ordinary like the pulaos. 
Services and ambience was pleasent.

This has been my first visit to to this place out of a sudden whim from one of my friend. The place looked ok types. We ordered few starters to go with the drinks. Though the Chinese preparation was ok but the indian dishes were not that much impressive. Located by the side of garia metro,this place is 1st of its kind in that location but still it needs to take a lot care about the services and food.

I found this restuarant on my recent visit to Kolkata where I was desperately searching for the all time famous Bengali Restaurant 'Babumoshai'.
The food here is Delicious. We ordered Chinese and it was worth it. Besides the food, the Staff is very Humble and Friendly. They would give you a variety of options according to your taste. The ambience is lovely with the view of the Metro passing by from the window. The Name being quite justifiable indeed. The ambience is very lively though it's the City of Joy we are talking about. 
Though the deserts were not upto the mark. Chinese is great here !

Me & my friends visited this restaurants yesterday after dreadful exams. It is situated at the 3rd floor of the building and adjacent to the Kavi Nazrul station. Well they take a lottttttt time to serve. It was 3 pm and we were very hungry. We cant help to look constantly on the kitchen's door. We mainly ordered various types of noodles and chicken side dishes. Food was good, not extra ordinary but good. Also the waiters were well mannered. In my view prices are a bit high for the foods.

This was a last moment choice for a Friday night celebration. We were a group of three and ordered orange breezer  Carlsberg beer and two other types of rum and whiskey. We also had chili chicken ,fried rice,butter nun ,paneer pakoda for starters and dry chili chicken. We had. Pineapple cocktail which we were surprisingly served as a three layer cocktail. We loved the fast service and were delighted when the bartender made us the three layer cocktail. The price was very reasonable ans the bill came to a total of 2700 which was really really reasonable. We loved the ambiance and the service. Would love to spend to time at the last metro again.

Spectacular is one word that describes this bar. Located very near to Garia Metro Station, this bar is located on the 3rd floor of a building which makes it less susceptible to noise and improves the experience. Food and Beverages are quite reasonable and the ambience is lovely. Its a must visit for all people who love to enjoy a chilled drink in this sweltering heat. Cheers.....

A decent bar cum restaurant I must say, I have visited the place only once and had some beers with some butter tandoori rotis, chicken butter masala and roganjosh ie we didn't experimented much. The rotis and butter masala was as usual no frills stuff but I thought the roganjosh to be a bit bland and of unimpressive taste. I think I have tasted better roganjoshes in the heart of this city. However the points that I wanna make is not about the food. First, I must say that we were three people visiting there in a hot and sultry afternoon.

after entrance we expected the ac to be switched on upon seeing us taking a seat. That's how it happens in other places of this pricerange. But instead we had to verbally request the waiter to switch on the ac. Not expected things no. 1

we were offered with a small menu consisting of mainly starters and a drinks menu. Now me and my colleagues were dead hungry and were looking for lunch accompanied with a  drink session. So, we thought of leaving the place. That is when one of my colleagues being desperate asked to one of the waiters, "ektu ruti-tuti-o ki kichhu nei?", and the waiter then replied that, "ha achhe toh, lunch menucard achhe toh, ami bhablam apnara sudhu drink korben." Now, I must say here that the waiters do need to realize that people do lunch and drink together, and I must suggest them to leave the thinking part on the customers. Their job is to present the customers with all the available menus.Unexpected thing no 2.

now, as our lunch was completed, we concentrated on the drinks. Since there was not any smoking room we had to smoke in the corridor. Now I am not complaining about that. A very counted few even among the poshest restaurants in Kolkata has dedicated smoking rooms so not having a smoking room is not something unexpected. But every time we went outside (I am a bit of a frequent smoker), a person was keeping tab on us so that we might not flee without paying the bill.Unexpected and humiliating thing no.3

the place is well located but if it is become popular it must become far more professional. So my score for this bar cum restaurant is a meager 2.5 out of 5

wow...... great place. Really didn't actually expect such a great place in such a location. but it really exceeded my expectations. The quality of food is great, in addition to its superb ambiance and service.
The best thing about this place is its location - thats just next to Kavi Nazrul metro station. Its like a pit stop - stop over for a drink or catching up with friends..

A very decent place, though being next to the metro line, the bar cuts out that irritating sound of the trains. In short - a great place in this sort of location. :)

We were a group of 8 out to party for one of our friends birthday but we didn't want to go too far nor to any crowded place. After a long time we were all together n wanted to enjoy amongst ourselves so we thought of going to this newly renovated and re-opened restaurant and what a gala time all of us had. I would vote it as the best place in its locality. Most importantly what was nice about the place is their service. Really they need to be praised for their service. They do serve drinks and have to mention in a very decent and proper manner. We went for taquilla shots with starters quite delicious. As the place is not crowded its comfortable to sit chat drink eat n enjoy every moment. They even arranged a birthday cake for our friend which is really appreciable. The food though not extraordinary tasted good enough to let you visit the place again.Ambiance is average but best in locality. Overall a nice place with warm service that makes me promise to visit it again and would suggest all to visit if you are searching for a good place to hangout in and around GAria. Best wishes to their team and am sure they will do well with such good service.

I had been to this place a couple of weeks back, after they have renovated the place called Babumoshai. The ambiance is so-so, but what I liked is that they are trying hard to become a good and professional restaurant as their service level is extra ordinary. All the staffs are well mannered and well behaved and they do their best to suggest and service you. The food is not having any extra ordinary touch as far as the taste is concerned, but their Tandoori Pomfret is a delicacy and worth a try! I liked the point that they have collaborated some cocktails in their liquor menu as well. I do not know why Zomato says that bar is not available as there is a bar in it very much. The manager came at the last himself to ask our opinion on the overall experience so that he can improve upon the shortcomings. The menu is a bit over priced as far as the items are concerned. i wish them all the best as there is not a single  decent restaurant in the locality, Palki being the worst to look at. If they can hold on to their service level, they can go a long way. Would definitely visit again as they do not trade on your head to empty your seats!!
