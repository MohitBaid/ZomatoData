This outlet of Juicy is situated at the Food Court of Lake Mall. It has got many varieties of different kinds of shakes,beverages,lassis and juices. Pricing is reasonable and service is prompt. Overall it can be tried along with other food and stuffs when ordered at the food court.

Too expensive for ordinary fare. Nothing here to write home about. Disappointing cold coffee, lassi and juices. Nothing juicy about the place. The staff is courteous and tries to work fast but management seems to be poor.

I quite like the juice they make. They are refreshing. Though not the best but definitely good. I always order the Water Melon Juice which I love! 
The last time I had been here with my mom, I tasted the Mint Mojito and Ordered Water melon juice for mom. I loved the Mint Mojito. Service is prompt. The staff is nice too. :)

Food court of lake mall. Names of products are enticing like blue velvet and so on but the mocktails are mostly of weird taste and not well mixed. Not impressed with the service and quantity as well. Filled with ice mostly and sweet soda.
Dissapointed largely..

Worst outlet I have ever visited.

They are servingng only 5-6 items from their menu.

From those 5-6 items, I had ordered "Khas Lassi" and it was horrible with worst service.

Not feeling sorry for the review.

All the very best for future.

Cheers

Like all other food stalls in the food court,  Lake Mall this one is also tried by me and my college friends. It's a very small stall and they have a wide range of juices , shakes, mojitos. The only thing that I liked from here is the chocolate shake with ice cream, which they don't have on the menu but the guy suggested us to try that. It was amazing and better than the other stuff that I tried from this place . Watermelon juice is the absolute worst. IT costs a bomb for a small glass of plain watermelon juice. The mojitos are fairly priced and are good in taste too. :)

We ordered Oreo milkshake from this stall and chocolate fudge sundae from the Amul ice cream parlour attached to it. 
They took some time to deliver the order but the shake as well as sundae was delicious. Summer chills at lake mall should be here.

Juicy is a kiosk located at the food court of Lake Mall, which mainly sells icecreams, shakes, beverages & juices.

Ambience is cool & hygienic.

Service is bit slow.

Tried Mixed Fruit Lassi & Tutty fruity icecream. Lassi was thick, creamy and yummy. Icecream was refreshing and delectable.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

A nice place for quenching thirst.

Visited this place twice actually. I tried out their Choco Milk Shake and the Oreo Milk Shake. Both were very average to try.
On today's visit I just had a cup of Coffee here and it was really poor and priced at Rs.30 for a small paper glass. Totally waste of money.

We ordered a Kolkata blue or something like that indicating a blue lagoon and a mint flavoured drink also called "mint mojito". Coming to the flavour the blue lagoon was decently good and had a ice cream over it...but the mint flavoured drink was s disaster! It seemed to be toothpaste mixed juice! Rather a toothpaste dissolved drink!

the Yum Street being our anytime go-to option & we being big fans of JUICY it's hard to count how many times we have stopped by this stall. here's a list of what we've tasted so far.
1. Shark Bite: This is a soda based kiwi flavored mocktail which stands out amidst all those mainstream sweet ones.
2. tuty-fruity: the layers of chopped fruits, scoops of vanilla ice-cream topped with strawberry crush & chocolate syrup is a perfect dessert item
3. Pineapple Blossom: a tangy pineapple mocktail that comes with a scoop of melting vanilla ice cream
4. Mango lassi: a drink apt for mango lovers with just the right texture, authentic flavour & soothing taste.

PS:- JUICY serves all these thirst ventures without cutting a hole in the pocket. ;)

Roaming around in the Lake Mall made me tired and hungry. After having some tasty momos i was all thirsty when i looked up to this place and it was all shinchan glitters in my eyes. A Juice kiosk at the food court thats something i needed then. Ordered Masala Thumps up and Soda Sikanji at the first place until i get to know that soda is unavailable and they cant provide me the Sikanji. After getting pissed off with such a gesture from them i changed it to Rose Masala. Masala Thumps up was as it was like any other shop but Rose Masala was something new to me and it tasted refreshing and pretty good. To be mention it was made up on Raliis Rose syrup with cold water and chat masala into it which made the drink THODA HATKE.

Not too bad not too good. Just a decent place to buy mocktails or Juices to be precise. 
We were at Lake Mall and ate at the food court here and took 
Velvet Smooth  and Mint Ginger

The mint ginger was pretty good at taste and all of us loved it. It was accurately chilled and the flavours were right. You can give this a try.

The Velvet Smooth was just alright but was very high on the sweetness. I couldn't drink much of it and my friends did the honor. You can have this if you love a bit more sweetness in your drinks. :)

Located on the food court of lake mall, this is the perfect place to quench your thirst at an affordable price. I was in lake mall with a friend. The summer heat made us thirsty and this place seemed like heaven, serving almost all type of drinks. I had a pineapple juice and she tried mixed fruit lassi. I must say, both were amazing. The lassi was obviously amazing, consistent and delicious! Would be back for more.

This juice counter is one my favorite spots in lake mall. They provide well refreshing juices at very reasonable rates. 
I've tried quite a number of refreshments... Ginger on the rocks, cola float, masala thums up, virgin merry, mint mojito, velvet touch.
All were perfect except mint mojito, I didn't like its taste...
Apart from that I've tried ice creams here... Tutty fruity was too good.
This place is always recommended!

This juice shop is located on the far left corner of the lake mall food court. I donot know why they have such low ratings, i pretty much like this place. Whenever i go to lake mall I definitely have juice from this place. The juices are always fresh and made of pure fruits. I love their mango juice and watermelon juice. But i have observed that something's the guy at this store is unavailable at the spot and no one is managing the place or taking orders. Otherwise, its worth a try.

A tiresome day led us to Lake Mall where we opted for nothing more than juice or ice cream.
Opted for the Tutti Frutti ice cream. And it was a great relief. Looked brilliant. However, The Mango that they put in wasn't ripe hence tasted extremely sour which naturally did not go with the taste of the ice cream.
But keeping in mind that you get it for just Rs 70 you get lesser scope to complain. This place shall give you all the peace in summer. :)

This juice bar in the food court, Yum Street, of Lake Mall serves a wide range of juices and other non alcoholic drinks. They have fresh fruit juices, which are good and reasonably priced. They also have mocktails like mint Mojito, which somehow didn't  appeal to me.( the taste wasn't tangy enough). The have lassi also,their rose lassi was excellent, perfect  for a warm afternoon. They have other flavours in lassi also but I haven't tried any.( will do so soon). Haven't tried their soda sikhanji,masala cold drinks or coffee either. Will definitely do so in the days to come.

After shopping sessions at Lake Mall if you are looking for some joint to sit and sip some coolers then this is your place to be. This place is just a small kiosk at the Yum Street Food court in Lake Mall located at the Lake Market area. You will find one such beverage kiosk at most of the malls and food courts around the city and here this kiosk serves a wide range of shakes, coolers, juices and mocktails.

You need to get prepaid Yum Street Food court card from the cash counter and place the order. The server at the stall is pretty friendly and courteous. The plus was definitely the speed of service. My Kachha mango panna was served in a jiffy. Also the juice was served in slick looking conical glass that was just apt for this purpose.

But then we can talk more about this drink and its downsides. The quantity was bit on the lesser side compared to the price. But since it is served in a long narrow conical glass it seems the volume is good enough, which is not very true. But anyway the juices serve as nice thirst quenchers for sure. But my Kachha mango pango was almost ruined by an overdose of jaljeera powder which was there all over the place, it felt I was having a Soda Shikhanji or Masala Coke. I have had much better mango panna before in greater quantity at this price. Though the drink was rightly chilled having couple of ice cubes in it.

The ambiance is that of the Yum Street food court which is very neat and spaced out, the colorful chairs and white colored tables are quite vibrant, yet classy and refreshing. When I was placing the order I wanted to go for their Lassis, but I was told they are not available which was again a let down. I will be back again though since I spotted only this one juice parlour here at this place, but I might just go for some masala coke next time to play it even safer.

Cheers!
