I have always associated great food with Central Kolkata or the North, Park Street being an exception. South Kolkata does has its fair share of food joints,  but apart from a scattering of pubs,  cafes and bars,  I have never been too excited about any particular haunt. That changes today. I am reformed today from my misgivings. South Kolkata can now boast of food bordering heavenly. Tucked off the junction of Hazra Road and Priyanath Mullick Road,  beside Life Care pharmacy and bang opposite Bhojohori Manna,  is located my new favorite, Gobbler. Consummate of its name,  the fare is explosive. And I am talking about a dish which the Bengali gastronome adores. Some worship. The manic Kosha Mangsho. Its mayhem in its purest form. It is also a dish with the thinnest margin of error. And boy,  did they not ace it. Its spicy but that's because I requested them to,  but it's evenly textured. The mutton melts and the gravy remains as an aftertaste for long. The mixture of spices play havoc with your taste buds and it's literally a war between extreme pleasure and food lust. 
This is a new place so the news of it's existence is yet to hit a crescendo. I suggest it does soon enough. They have an impressive menu that includes Chinese and Biriyani too. Have yet to taste them. But whatever I tasted today,  will be savoured for some time. Or perhaps a long time. Until I repeat the pleasure on an infinite loop. 
So if you are at Hazra,  and hungry. You can never be far from rescue. Let Gobbler be the saviour.

Ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Noodles, and Chicken with Babycorn and Button Mushroom.
Food was quite good. Chicken Fried Rice was although average. Nice and clean atmosphere with ambient lighting. Service offered by the waiters is average as there is a lack of manpower. You might have to wait for your food a little longer than expected. Overall a strong 4/5.

A small and new joint near hazra. I went there with my friends on Navami. We ordered chicken pakora and biryani. The pakoras tasted good and the biryani, though a bit oily, was tasty. The ambience was nice with good lighting. However I wished the restaurant was bigger. The staff were good to us. The prices were also reasonable. Will be visiting again. :)
