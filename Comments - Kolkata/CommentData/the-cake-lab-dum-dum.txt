The cake lab can easily be called the paradise of chocolate lovers. They have a wide array of cakes pastries and my personal favorite is the chocolate lollipop. However it's the bit pricey considering the food.

Good place.  Well maintained. 
Cakes are tasty 
More over that white chocolate cake is pure love..  Not many shops in this area sells that though.

One of the best Cakes I've ever eaten. They take order over WhatsApp or Zomato and deliver it to you by the time you want it. They serve the best cake in the price range they offer. The quality is also too good.
