1st time I visit this place and the experience was very nice... They provide Authentic taste of punjab.! Food was delicious.. We ordered :
Murg masala : 4.5/5
Aloo dum masala: 5/5
And tawa roti- the texture of the roti is too good. 
But the service was very poor..

Hey Pind Punjabi Dhaba... I must say well done with Murgh Kadai and Amritsari kulcha, those Meethi lassi and Masala Chaash. But little upset with Amritsari Biriyani... The rice stints yuckkk.... But the masalas and the piece is good. Really when I got the parcel my kitchen filled with the heaven smell of your food. Looks awesome, but while I eat that biriyani rice thought for best but its distrubz my thoughts. Pls be carefully with your biriyani rice its smells as well as taste really bad.
But all over with ur kulcha and murgh kadai....its just paisa wasool. I really expect more with the biriyani.
Goodluck
Lol

Few days back I went to this restaurant with my friend. We ordered veg seekh kabab Dal tadka & tandoori roti. Inspite of the instruction to make the food less spicy, they made it over spicy. Lot usage of cinnamon in kabab which made that inedible & had to cancel that item. Dal was very average in taste. In regards to ambience & the place it was good but the good food is the foundation of genuine happiness.

Please work upon the taste of the food by using appropriate amount of spices in it.

Visited this place a couple of days back, the interiors are nicely done but the space is a bit cramped, though completely devoid of customers, u can even hear whatever is being discussed behind the counter & in the kitchen from your table. We had meethi lassi which disappointed with its quantity
, then we had hariyali chicken kebabs which were d only highlight of d day. The waiter was most probably new & had no idea about the availability of half d dishes but he was the only polite guy in the establishment i would say. The management was rude to say the least & had a nonchalant air, which restaurant has no lunch service at 2 in the afternoon. When the food finally arrived it was brought out all haphazardly & the quantities were really less , the egg curry was below average & the chicken butter masala, papad ,raita & cheese corn parathas were quite ordinary...the gulab jamuns were the only desserts available & they were just tiny deflated balls. Even though the food was fine on the whole i would not go back to the place on account of the tardy service & the serious attitude problems that the management had. They should really consider operating as a delivery joint seeing their quality of customer interaction.

Visited this restaurant a couple of days back. It was around 8 in the evening and the restaurant was completely empty. On our arrival there was no greetings or anything from the staff which was a little weird for me. Then after we settled in our seats, it took almost 5-6 mins for the waiter to come and hand us the menu.
Not the best way to start your dining.
The restaurant has a few things going for them. The not so lavish dhaba-ish theme is quite charming and to go with it, it is located in a very good neighborhood. They serve food on wooden plates which are quite funky and the lantern like bulb holders add to the charm and overall feel.
Coming to the food , the menus were a little funny in it's pricing. Like for example: a glass of flavored lassi costs 90 rs but half plate of tandoori chicken which has 4 big portions of chicken costs 150 bucks. How or why? I don't have the answer.
We ordered
üçó tandoori chickenüçó,
ü•ò chicken do piyanzaü•ò ,
üç™ plain parantheüç™,
and
ü•õüçìstrawberry lassi ü•õ.

Tandoori chicken was a mixed bag for me. The portions did excite me quite a bit on it's arrival, the taste too was fine untill I found out one such chicken piece was significantly undercooked. No one likes half cooked meat on their plate.
The paranthe were good and I liked them quite a bit. They were tasty.
The chicken do piyanza ü•ò was a very nice dish. Probably the best dish that was served to us. That sweetness of the gravy won me over.
The strawberry lassi was nice but I felt it had a bit too much syrup in it. A little less and it would have been perfect.
Apart from that undercooked chicken piece I had no problem with the food. Even the restaurant is very easy on your pockets. But according to me, the service needs to improve. Even if you are having a bad night, customers still expect a warm greeting on their arrival.
PS: if you are in the area and want to have some good non veg food , you can pay this restaurant a visit.

India‚Äôs diversity can surely be understood by taking one look at the diverse food that are being offered by the different regions. Among these different cuisines, some become a favorite and stay close to your heart. North Indian or Punjabi cuisine is one such Indian variety of food that the nation is currently high on. The spice, the Punjabi tadka and the attitude and their approach to life is what makes Punjabi cuisine as well as punjabis such a sought after community and food in India and in turn kolkata. As a part of team Panch Phoron we got a chance to partake in a food tasting ceremony at Pind Punjabi Dhaba. It was an invitation to taste their Durga puja special menu and let me tell you how impressed I was.
                                                                ...

Are you craving for some delicious North Indian food??
This is the place for you!!!
Team PanchPhoron were invited for a food tasting session on the occasion of their new menu launch.

The place is located at a lane beside Reliance Fresh, Bangur Lake town. A small restaurant with seating arrangement of around 14 people and having a decent ambiance unlike its name.

The dishes we were served - 
1. Chicken Tikka Hariyali - Boneless chicken pieces marinated with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, coriander & mint leaves paste & lime juice and grilled well. Tikka was soft & tasted amazing.

2. Chicken Tikka - Boneless chicken pieces marinated with yoghurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli & lemon juice and then grilled. Chicken tikka was succulent and yummy.

3. Stuffed Aloo - Peeled potatoes are scooped out & filled with potato pulp cooked with spices and mixed with cashews & raisins. It's a must have for all vegetarians.

4. Mutton Kassa - This dish was toothsome. Mutton pieces were marinated with curd, ginger-garlic paste, onion paste, Kashmiri red chilli powder and then cooked with garam masala.

5. Mutton Rogan Josh - It's a signature dish of Kashmiri cuisine. It's extremely flavourful and highly recommended. Soft & juicy mutton tasted amazing with butter naan.

6. Paneer Pasanda - Paneer or cottage cheese is sliced into triangle & stuffed with the filling made with grated paneer, raisins, finely chopped cashews, tomato,green chillies, coriander leaves & mint leaves. These sandwiches were dipped in corn starch batter & fried well & then mixed with the gravy. The colored layers of stuffing looked beautiful. A scrumptious dish and pleased my non vegetarian palates.

7. Paneer Paratha -  A tempting shallow fried bread stuffed with paneer mixed with light spices and goes well with other main course.

8. Kadai Paneer - Cubed cottage cheese is deep fried & then cooked with curd, garam masala, red pepper, coriander powder. It tastes great.

9. Mixed Vegetables - Carrots, peas, cauliflower, beans, capsicum mixed with spices & tasted great. 

10. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala - Chicken tikka kebabs are cooked with aromatic & flavourful spices. It is topped with fresh cream to enhance the taste. It tastes ambrosial.

11. Masala Kulcha - Kulcha is stuffed with potato, spices & onions & goes well with chicken & mutton recipes.

12. Kashmiri Pulao - Unlike other ones this Pulao is on the sweeter side. It is made with basmati rice, saffron & fried onions and garnished with both dry fruits & fresh fruits. Generally, cashews, pistachios, raisins,almonds & walnuts are added to it. 

13. Chicken Fried Rice - An Indo Chinese fried rice recipe using chicken. It tastes delicious with soft tender chunks of chicken. 

Don't waste time anymore!!!

Book a table & visit them to savour all these amazing recipes!!!!

The restaurant is third absolutely third clAss with idiots delivering food and extremely rude staff. I ordered food at around 2130 while these unprofessional folks rang my bell at 1215!!! Yes almost three hours while zomato showed 1hr of delivery plus kitchen make up time! 
Now starts the real deal,he got me someome else‚Äôs order and later says your food was delivered to someone else and that they have entire opened the food so ill go get it! I immediately had a word with the Restaurant guy to which he said you can complain to zomato because they have your money not us! Later he had the audacity to lie that he will get the food re delivered and the food never came!! The staff is full of rude unprofessional and stupid people.
Strongly recommended to not order food from here.

Never thought a day would come when i would miss chicken tikka biryani and thankfully when i did, pind punjabi dhaba¬†came to my rescue. i loved how fragrant the dish was which succulent pieces of chicken and a generous portion.¬†
also their chicken parathas are to die for!

Check GST, this restaurant is big fraud. They apply GST over delivery charge which is illegal. If you order please calculate the taxes. I am sure someday someone will drag this restaurant to consumer forum for taxing extra taxes.

I ordered food online from this place. I am a regular customer of Pind Punjabi Dhaba. Their food, its quantity, quality, taste, and most importantly it's price is very much satisfying.
Chicken bharta - The chicken are very finely chopped. The onions, tomato and everything present in bharta are finely cooked with right amount of spices. Again, the quantity of Bharta is very good. 3-4 people can easily consume 1 plate of chicken bharta. It is not very spicy, which makes it perfect for the people who don't easy spicy food and also for the people who prefer eating spicy food.
Chicken Amritsari Biryani - One word, WOW !!! Very satisfying, from quality to quality. The rice are very well cooked. I have seen usually that the biryani has a lot of oil , but this biryani is healthy as it doesn't have much oil. The chicken is soft, usually I find it hard in biryani, and also that the chicken is also cooked with spices not like other biryani chicken where it is just boiled with spices. Very tasty.
Chapati is very good. Doesn't have dry flour on it. Perfectly cooked. U will feel like u are eating a home cooked chapati. Not much thin and also not much thick , just perfect.
Only thing disappointed me was their chicken tikka which was very dry, which made it harder to tear and eat.
Else everything was perfect.
Definitely will be ordering again .
Thank you Pind Punjabi Dhaba

The first time i visited the place it really impressed me with its great food,cozy ambience and friendly staffs. Hence i visited again. But this time i met with disappointment. I have no complaints about the food which was great so was the server, a nice friendly guy. It was the manager or the owner ( not sure of it ) whose behaviour was utterly disturbing. It felt as if he was doing us a favour by taking our orders or talking to us and answering our queries.  Sir if you ever read this please understand that by behaving in such rude manner with your customers will eventually cost you your business. I will think twice before visiting again.

Check GST, this restaurant is big fraud. They apply GST over delivery charge which is illegal. If you order please calculate the taxes. I am sure someday someone will drag this restaurant to consumer forum for taxing extra taxes.

I ordered food online from this place. I am a regular customer of Pind Punjabi Dhaba. Their food, its quantity, quality, taste, and most importantly it's price is very much satisfying.
Chicken bharta - The chicken are very finely chopped. The onions, tomato and everything present in bharta are finely cooked with right amount of spices. Again, the quantity of Bharta is very good. 3-4 people can easily consume 1 plate of chicken bharta. It is not very spicy, which makes it perfect for the people who don't easy spicy food and also for the people who prefer eating spicy food.
Chicken Amritsari Biryani - One word, WOW !!! Very satisfying, from quality to quality. The rice are very well cooked. I have seen usually that the biryani has a lot of oil , but this biryani is healthy as it doesn't have much oil. The chicken is soft, usually I find it hard in biryani, and also that the chicken is also cooked with spices not like other biryani chicken where it is just boiled with spices. Very tasty.
Chapati is very good. Doesn't have dry flour on it. Perfectly cooked. U will feel like u are eating a home cooked chapati. Not much thin and also not much thick , just perfect.
Only thing disappointed me was their chicken tikka which was very dry, which made it harder to tear and eat.
Else everything was perfect.
Definitely will be ordering again .
Thank you Pind Punjabi Dhaba

Ordered food at 11.19. delivery time 12.19. food is still not delivered. Delivery guy saying it will take another half an hour everytime I call him. Zomato@ team not able to contact the delivery guy (another feather in the cap). Zomato now asking me contact pins Punjabi for further query.
My question is I trusted u to provide me food. Then stop blaming it on others and do your job. If you can't then bloody shut down ur business. 
And this 1 rating is only because it's necessary else would have given u in negative.

Before this restaurant served really nice dishes but recently since two months food was not at all upto the mark. We frequently order their Amitsari biryani from over there, but the last two times we ordered that, it did not have that flavour that it used to have. Proper food gone bad! They said that their cook had been changed, but atleast a different cook can provide different taste but not a bad food. I give 2.5 solely because of the good food it used to send.

Durga pujo is here.Durga puja in never complete without amazing dishes, but it the tastes and flavor of punjab, or dishes from other indian styles and you are in for a treat this year with the Puja special menu at the Pind Punjabi Dhaba. Located at Bangur near Reliance fresh. Small place but ambiance is very cozy, well decorated. The staffs are very friendly. Coming to the food we had - 

‚Ä¢ Chicken Haryali Tikka - Soft and Juicy chicken with lovely flavors and colors of green with chutney is totally irresistible.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Tikka - This dish will blow your mind, its super tasty and full of great flavors.

‚Ä¢ Stuffed Aloo - Delicious and full of Nutrients. This dish was mainly made of sweet potatos.

‚Ä¢ Mutton Kassa -  really yummy, I love these kind of dark color curries with a thin layer of oil floating on the top.

‚Ä¢ Mutton Roganjosh - Nothing beats the flavored of mustard oil in most authentic regional dishes. Signature Style.

‚Ä¢ Paneer Pasanda - Paneer pasanda is delectable and very exotic dish made with fried paneer prices. Aroma rich Creamy gravy.

‚Ä¢ Kadai Paneer - Mouthwatering, Paneer cooked in a spicy gravy made of onions, tomatoes,capsicum.

‚Ä¢ Paneer Tikka - Chunks of Paneer marinated in spices and grilled in a tandoor. Nom Nom :p

‚Ä¢ Mixed Veg - Healthy punjabi veg curry. Little bit spicy.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Tikka Butter Masala - Spiced Chicken dish. Delicious , the chicken was soft and tender.

‚Ä¢ Kashmiri Pulao - a kashmiri rice preparation with a dry fruits and cottage cheese and spicesnuts.

Aromatic, mild and sweet

‚Ä¢ Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was served in a bowl tossed with small chicken pieces,eggs and lots of veggies. A fulfilling dish, yummy 

‚Ä¢ Assorted Breads - Soft and tasty. Great with curries and rice.

Number of Chicken pieces were enough for two persons.Quantity is good. Best part is that it is very decently priced and worth your money. Good Experience. I would suggest everyone should visit here at least once. Thank you Rajdeep Bhattacharjee (Gourmets Travel Guide) ‚Äì For leading our food journey and sharing your knowledge.

There is no shortage of restaurants serving North Indian cuisine but only few actually manage to create that charm and live up to our expectations. ¬†Talking of one such places, Pind Punjabi Dhaba, is quite a familiar name and very popular for its North Indian and Mughlai cuisines preparations. Pind Punjabi Dhaba is located at 68/1, Bangur Avenue, Near Reliance Fresh, Block B, Bangur, Kolkata. The place is suitable lit, comfy seats and Ambiance¬†is very cosy and warm, While the place is properly lit up by sunlight during daytime, ¬†the dim lighting makes the place elegant at evenings & nights. I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance of this place .¬†I have been here with Team Panchphoron to attend their Durga Puja food menu launch .¬†Their¬†upcoming Durga Puja Menu food was totally up to the mark and satisfied my taste buds to the core.

When we think of North Indian foods.. first thing that came to our mind is amazing rich parathas, rice, butter chicken, tandoori and ofcourse Lassi. So with the same concept Pind Punjabi Dhaba brings to you their popular flavourful punjabi dishes.
Located at Bangur near Reliance fresh, Kolkata this restaurant is small and cozy with a quirky designed Truck. The walls and ceilings are decorated with lanterns and pictures of famous Punjabi personalities.
The staffs are very corteous and friendly. Team Panchphoron was invited for their Puja Menu launching event.
So lets jump onto the lip smacking dishes that me and my foodie friends tried over there-

‚ñ† Chicken Haryali Tikka- The chicken is mainly marinated with spinach, garlic and ginger paste to bring the green colour in it. The chicken was moist and soft. Good to taste. Served with chutney and onion.
‚ñ† Chicken Tikka- Tandoor item. Mainly yougurt, mashed nuts and other spices are used to make the chicken. The chicken was great in taste. Served with green chutney and onion rings.
‚ñ† Stuffed Aloo- The dish was mainly made of sweet potatoes. Crumbled cottage cheese, green chillies, different types of spices were used to made the stuffing. Good in taste. And presentation was beautiful as well.
‚ñ† Mutton Kassa- Rich aromatic gravy with lotsbof onion mashed in it. The mutton was tender. The gravy was itself a star. Goes well with rice and kulcha.
‚ñ† Mutton Roganjosh- Very popular Kashmiri dish. Made of yogurt and many spices. The aromatic flavours will keep you mesmerised. The mutton pieces were soft and succlucent. Gravy was great as well.
‚ñ† Paneer Pasanda- Shallow fried paneer cubes with pureed onion. The main attraction was the panner was bisected into small thin lines in which tricolured paneer was stuffed in it. Represents Indian flag. Looks very interesting. And great in taste. Served in thick sweet gravy.
‚ñ† Paneer Paratha- The paneer paratha was so yummy. Paneer stuffed parathas with perfect mixture of spices, corriander and chillies. Not so oily. Perfect for mutton roganjosh and mutton kassa.
‚ñ† Kadai Paneer- Paneer cooked in onion and tomato gravy with kadai masala and corrainder and green bell peppers in it. This paneer turned out very flavourfull and delicious.
‚ñ† Paneer Tikka- It is a popular tandoori snack. Paneer prepared with hung curd. You can feel the garlicky, garam masala's flavour in it. The paneer tikka consisted of onions, green bell peppers
‚ñ† Mixed Vegetable- Cauliflower, bell peppers and many other mixed vegetables alongwith paneer..sweet in taste topped with cream.
‚ñ† Chicken Tikka Butter Masala- This was so amazing. The chicken was soft and tender. Flavourful. The gravy was rich in taste.
‚ñ† Masala Kulcha- Masala stuffed kulcha. Great in taste. The kulcha was soft. Goes great either with vegetables or any chicken or mutton sides.
‚ñ† Kashmiri Pulao- Basically little sweet in taste. With cherry, cashew nuts, almonds, raisins on top of it. Goes great with chicken tikka masala or even with any mutton preparation.
‚ñ† Chicken Fried Rice- Flavourful fried rice with chicken, egg and vegetables in it. Not too oily. Good in taste.
‚ñ† Butter Nun- Soft crispy buttered bread. Compliments any of the side dishes very well. Will fill your stomach lavishly.

Moreover a pocket friendly restaurant with good quantity and quality. Recommended.
So keep calm and stay Punjabi at Pind Punjabi Dhaba. Happy Eating üòä

Unfortunately got a chance to find out exactly why.

Went to meet someone and have get out as early as we can.

Disgraceful food and too over attitude by the people.
Left without even completing the food.

The waiters are always pre occupied with nothing.

Complete waste.
No doubt why it stays empty.

Its taste doesnt seems like biriyani. I think the person who is making it should be welly trained. Too much spicy &chilli powder  added.I would recommend to the buyers not to order from this o@utlet , it is the worst biriyani i had ever in my full life.

It was past 10:30 pm and when all other options in the vicinity were closed, this dhaba came to our rescue. Nice decor, polite staff and quick service. With pictures of all the renowned Punjabi personalities on the roof and bamboo sticks and laterns on the wall, it quite stands up to its name. Their parathas specially the cheese paratha with the exactly right amount of cheese and crisp are a must try. In main course we had chicken dopyaza, chicken tikka masala , paneer tikka masala, veg raita and nans ( kulchas and boondi raita were unavailable) . I liked their nonveg dishes more than the veg ones. Also their lassi is quite average. Nevertheless if you are craving for some typical Punjabi dhaba food in Kolkata but want to go easy on your pocket too then this is your place guys!

It was an horrible experience. I ordered Chicken Wrap from here but what I get is Chicken mayonnaise roll,  which tastes awful. The Wrap has no crisp.

Have zero percent knowledge about this place but had ordered food for home delivery two times. We had ordered chicken parathas and chicken bharta. The chicken parathas were not upto the mark and got a bit burnt in the process of cooking. However the bharta didn't disappoint us, as it was nicely cooked, tasty and the quantity provided was more than enough. In short it's a okayish place :)

First of all the order took around 2 hours to get delivered. Restaurant never picks up calls. It was zomato guys who helped me a lot.
I have never tasted such bad murg makhani ever.
It tastes sour. I think it was rotten. 
So in my suggestion, never order food from Pond Punjabi Dhaba. Their service and food quality both are worst .... I have rated them with 1 point because there is no option to rate in negative.. If there is option i would give -10.....

Ordered food via Zomato delivery at 9 pm. Waited for 1 hour for the food to arrive. I called up the restaurant for delivery status, he said guy is on the way. I accepted. 10:30 called up again, guy lied to me that delivery guy met with accident. Need more time. Called at 11:30 to let them know that I don't need their food anymore and they should stop cheating on their customers. The guy started hurling abuses at me. "Arree nahi hua delivery toh kya karloge tum" was his response to a person whose parents were starving past 3 hours waiting for food.

If you guys are reading this boycott the restaurant.

We ordered veg Kolhapuri,Amritsari kulcha and lacha Paratha when I tasted veg Kolhapuri it was full of cinnamon powder with raw tomatoes paste , lacha Paratha was too salty and full of ajwain when complained about the same the respond was not very good they need to improve a lot on their taste and service.

Although limited non veg dishes, this place is good enough for small parties or get together. The preparations are worthly enough to complement. The only drawback I found here they left large pieces of cinnamon in the chiken bhunea masala. The other positive side of their service is they serve quite huge quantity for one plate. So a single dish can easily serve two person.

Well what can I say about this place, first time we ordered biryani online, after being disappointed by Kolkata Biryani again and again, i was preparing myself for it, but in return what we get, a delicious home cooked styled Biryani with 2 large pieces of chicken in it. It had authentic Punjabi taste which many claims here in Kolkata but few have yet delivered. After that it became a routine behavior.
Sometimes after, we visited this place in bangur. Ambience was good, but food again trumps everything. Mango lassi was to die for, chicken bhuna masala was out of this world. So finally summing up, for a north indian, is the best place to eat good food i have found in kolkata yet.

Had the worst ever experience against all the orders from Zomato with this restaurant. Ordered a combo meal and they delivered a meal of extremely lower category and even refused to refund the extra amount they charged. Sorry, Pind Punjabi but can't refer your restaurant to anyone after such an unprofessional behavior from your side.

I used Zomato delivery to order 2 Combos of Rajma Chawal from here at 10:30 PM.
Got one combo at 12:10am and the other one at 1:15am. Had 3 friends at my place for a stayover. Didn't have anything to eat. And even the food wasn't worth the wait. It was okay. But yes, it was filling.

Maybe next time if you guys send it to me faster and the full order then I might give you a better review.

Happened once again. Ordered for a rajma chawal combo. After waiting for more than an hour, receiving chole chawal.
Please tell me what is the problem? Don't have rajma? Could've informed. If your staff isn't focused, please change them. I'm not ordering from your restaurant any more. Thanks for the service :)

Have been visiting this place for long and it hasn't failed me ever in any of the categories. Food, ambience, environment and definitely the bill. 
The regional cultural designing on the walls and the desi environment is eye pleasing and a catcher. 
Staff is all happy go and will make you comfortable once you step inside.
Non-vegetarians cant afford to miss this place for chicken bharta and amritsari biryani. Vegetarians can go for spicy 'paneer' dishes. Need something to drink? Go for mango lassi.
Bill is completely wallet friendly.
Hoping to visit soon

Ordered food from here. And the experience was horrific. The management displayed the worst etiquettes possible. An experience so sour that I'll never order food from this place again. And ask fellow foodies to follow suit.

Complete solution to your Late night food cravings. I got my order delivered in just 20 min you can't beat that. My order was corn and cheese paratha it was accompanied with Amul butter and a mixed raita. Paratha was humongous and had perfect filling. It was hot and packing was good. It's highly recommended to all people who have late night food cravings.

I had a decent experience of this place. Ordered for home delivery through zomato. And service was made timely. Kebabs,paratha all were good. Chicken bharta was different. Unlike usual chivken bhartas. It was minced a lot and gravy was also spicy and masaledaar. But it was good. One can eat it thinking its not bharta but chicken masala. A special.mention...naan was soft and good. 
Overall nice

This place has been in my bucket list since many days.
Few days back I finally visited the place.
Though Bangur is quite confusing but we could easily locate it..thanks to zomato and google maps.
The place just made me happy..the interior was decorated very nicely..
now coming to the food..we ordered plain parathas and murgh makhani and sweet lime soda
The food was absolutely yum and also quite easy on pocket.
I loved the place and would like to visit it soon.!
Such dhaba feel,much wow.

Please don't think that this review is done by an enemy or a contemporary restaurant. I am very much disappointed with the food quality and this is the reason I am writing this review.
I ordered the general . Murgh tikka kabab, dal makhani, palak paneer, paratha platter and murgh tikka masala. 
The chicken pieces were rock hard. Not marinated at all. The gravy was over spicy...you'd drop dead if you even sniffed.The parathas reeked of Ajwain. Seemed like I am eating a CHURAN, instead of aloo paratha. The "palak" was stale... And disgustingly the Dal Makhani was SWEETISH.. can you imagine that? One of the worst Punjabi food I ever had. They slapped me and took a thousand rupees. Hopeless PIND DHABA. BAAPER GUSHTIR PINDI !

Ordered online at 12 am and received the food at 2:10 am whereas it is mentioned that delivery within 60 minutes. The delivery person was very rude, he couldn't come to the 7th floor, being a female i had to go to the ground floor to collect the food. Very inhuman behavior. Food quality was average, due to rudeness and late delivery i m already annoyed and then the food was also not upto the mark. I would never visit this restaurant. If the delivery person is rude then i can understand how the hotel is....

Took a leap of faith by reading online "Reviews" of users on Zomato.  To put it simply half of the reviews were simply "Misleading". Order menu were parathas, chicken Birayani, Reshmi Chicken and Veg Fried Rice. The parathas although not burnt were laced with oil or ghee and hardly outstanding. Biryani however, cooked to perfection was topped with a bowl of chillies. If I could have called it spicy I would but it was extra spicy. The same can be said of Veg Fried Rice too. Reshmi Chicken on the other hand was stale as it was "Sour", the Restaurant and others might argue its lemon or marinated in curd but its a simple give away to catch out their dirty tricks of the trade. If only half the people eating out at these joints knew about stomach ulcers and gastrointestinal problems such food cause. Verdict. Kindly stay away from over hyped word of the mouth and self proclaimed foodies or critics. My suggestion if only you want to give it a try do so.

This place is very kind to me. They serve late night food. The taste was decent and well prepared. Cost is affordable and quality is medium. Mostly panjabi dishes are good. But Biryani and other rice items are not up to the mark. Parathas and nun are found in so much variety. But main course is heavy for 1 but less for 2 peoples. All over good. 

But now they are giving rotten eggs. So unhealthy stuff is now distributed. I have tried egg pakoda, all are of rotten eggs. Disgusting.

Dear Zomato team, 
If you are looking to close down in the near future, it's restaurants like these you can count on. 
They give orders taken from across the entire town to one delivery boy, mine had 5 orders to deliver. 
Having an awesome meal 2 hours after placing the order, literally crying my way through the stone cold biryani they finally managed to deliver just 1hour from when it ws 'out for delivery'. 
The biryani's so cold, they could have taken the package out from the freezer and handed it to the delivery boy confident that it would hav defrosted on its way. 
Will be giving second thoughts to my orders now. 
God bless people who feed the hungry.

Thanks for nothing!

Located near Reliance Fresh Bangur, it is one of the best food I have had at this pricing. Ordered the Aloo paratha and took away biryani. It was great and cheap. Not only this, it was enough for meal for 2. At the price of Rs.250, it was the best deal one can get.

It is the New Year's Day and this restaurant has sworn to mistreat it's customers. Charging exorbitant rates based in the locality, the restaurant does not serve you well. There are many restaurants in the area and I seem to have made a mistake by ordering food at your place. Things go out of hand when the restaurant decides to charge you for delivering the food at your place. Do not make the mistake of ordering food at this place.

The worst place I could ever order from. Had ordered food from Zomato app at 9 pm almost and my delivery time was mentioned 10.38. but it's already 11 and the people at the restaurant are saying the food hasn't left bcoz of rush. Had guests waiting at my place and dey had to leave without eating food . Never ever gonna trust Zomato or this useless restaurant which is completely unprofessional. Wish there was a negative rating.

To start with let me clarify that this is not a paid review though it may sound like.
Well when do you fell that the price for the dish is less then what was offered, not generally na? But this place will make you say that. Located in Bangur avenue this outlet specialises in Punjabi cuisine and experiments well with parathas.

Interiors is bright and appealing, loved the truck at the entrance and posters of famous punjabis sticked to the ceiling. Service is damn slow to piss you off, even the cutlery was changed after request owing to it being dirty.

Then came the food, it was truly worth the wait. Haven't had this good North Indian/Punjabi yet. The chef made even high end restaurants to shame. First came pind lassi, which was sweet and thick as it should be, loved the presentation. Then came tandoori panner tikka, which was good as it should be.

Then came the main course which blew our mind, kali daal OMG, I can come daily to have it. Panner butter masala, panner so fresh and soft, gravy so good. Garlic naan, amritsari kulcha was also brilliant with good amount of butter.

Then came the parathas, a paratha here is a meal in itself. So much stuffing, raita, achar onions in such less money. Tried cheese paratha which has lots and lots of morzella in it, more than cheese burst pizza I can say. Tried cheese corn paratha which was also stuffed with some cheese and loads of American corn, I love American corn.

Was curious to try the gur paratha but we were full by now. The manager was happy to help to pack so much extra food we couldn't finish. Gur paratha biryani, and Strawberry lassi at the next visit for sure. Would have loved if some deserts were added to the menu to make it a complete meal.

A recommendation to people comming here. Order one thing at a time, serving is in good quantity, and paratha is a must here.

Delectable Paratha and Delicious Lassi Festival at Pind Punjabi Dhaba..!

An age old favorite being Paratha, one hardly needs an introduction to the same, as to what it is, how is it made or why it is so close to our hearts. Beckoning our senses and tickling our tastebuds, Paratha happens to be the daily snack mostly in Punjab Region, but that hardly defines the love and popularity of this dish (If I may say so)

¬†

The most common version being Aloo Paratha, much alike other food, Paratha can be customized and personalized in any way you want to. Some of the clear examples are versions like Methi, Gobi, Paneer, Cheese, Chicken, Chocolate and other versions of Paratha.

¬†

The ideal companion to a single serving of Paratha has to be a thick glass of Lassi. Made out of curd by stirring it using a particular technique, the richness and creaminess of Lassi is a perfect friend to digest the sumptuous Paratha.

¬†

Pind Punjabi Dhaba tries to bring to its patrons an array and series of such delectable paratha and delicious lassi for a limited period of time. Starting from the Bharwa MAchli Paratha to the Cheese Corn Paratha, the American Cream and Onion Paratha to the Chocolate Paratha, the list is never ending. I particularly liked the Aloo Matar Paratha with the dried Matar being very much liking to my tastebuds. They alone lifted the flavor of the Paratha to a whole new level. Shifting attention to the Cheese Corn Chicken Paratha, this was to me a Desi Version of the Pizza. The Cheese was flavorful, and along with the Corn and Cheese was appreciated by all of us.

Desi Tarka from the tawa @ Pind Punjabi Dhaba..!

Smelling non-veg food in Bangur Avenue? Weird ! Is it? Not this time. The great news is the fresh aroma from the tawa of Pind is back to mesmerize you. Presenting to you Pind Punjabi Dhaba which brings to you delicacies from North India. Pind Punjabi Dhaba is one of the most popular non vegetarian dine-in and delivery based restaurant in and around Bangur.
            

Location : The excellently located tiny joint is easily accessible from both VIP and Jessore roads. The address reads 68/1, Bangur Avenue. This is nearer to VIP Bangur. Located in the lane beside Reliance Fresh in  Block B.

Decor and Ambiance : The tiny little space has been superbly utilized. The ambiance is set against a monochrome backdrop. The quirky truck opposite to the main gate looks quite interesting and colourful. The ceiling has been decorated with one of the popular faces from Punjab. However I felt desi music would just have been an awesome combo with the desi food.

Food: The Brilliant innovative line of menu food with diverse options is all ready to amaze you.

-+
Beverages :

1. Lassi ‚Äì Talk about Punjabi food and the lassi cannot just be amiss. The chilled and refreshing sweet lassi with a rich and dense texture was simply mindblowing.

Well who would have thought of the concept of fusion Parathas coming up and that too in Kolkata!In spite of not being a staple diet for the city,there still exists some innovative minds to revolutionize parathas for the first time in the city.We were invited by the management a few days back to sample their wide range of innovative parathas and lassis. This place is located at Bangur Avenue in the alley just opposite the Reliance Fresh outlet. The eatery has got a bright orange name board on black background and really stands out due to it's hoarding.

This restaurant is open from 12pm till late midnight for take away,delivery and casual dine in as well.Also,with the oncoming of Swiggy and Zomato Order for delivery,they are sure to expand their business soon. Lassi & Parantha Festival which is currently running at their outlet, from 10th December to 24th December ‚Äò16,offers varieties of paranthas during this festival which one won‚Äôt get in their regular menu.These parathas are stuffed fusion parantahs which will make any parantha lover go crazy with joy and excitement! The variety of lassis on offer can make you forget the regular lassi!

Some of the parathas tried by me included CHEESE CORN CHICKEN PARANTHA,which was the very first Parantha I had and it had the right amount of chicken stuffing inside and topped off with corn and grated cheese which turned out to be simply perfect .Finally a non-veg paratha which I had been waiting for all my life!!!It surely will woo all chicken lovers.

Next was the ITALIAN PARANTHA(Yes you heard me right!)I mistook it for a pizza initially since it looks exactly like that due to it's presentation.Loved all the fillings, especially the filling of the Italian parantha was most innovative since I found pasta, bell peppers and bits of cheese in there and it overall tasted great.One would never expect pasta to be used as a paratha filling.

There was the ALOO MATAR PARANTHA which turned out to be my favourite. This was made with peas and mashed potatoes which did justice to the Parantha and there is no missing on this one if you are a Parantha lover .The Aloo Matar parantha was insanely good and wasn't heavy like the normal parathas that we eat.It had minimal oil.

The KABULI PARANTHA  had a potato stuffing with boiled Kabuli chana added inside.This was a little bland to taste.

Coming to lassis,I drank the PAN BAHAR LASSI which is an innovative Lassi.It had the real flavour of Rose leaves and Paan leaves with cherry . The essence was on the milder side and could have been stronger. DOODH COLA was something which I normally avoid drinking at most places but couldn't resist myself here.The Doodh Cola was amazingly refreshing with a very strong flavor of Coke mixed with milk.

This outlet,even though a bit small,should be visited atleast once by all paratha lovers(even the non-vegetarian folks have a reason now to visit this place).The service was on the slower side but with the coming days,they surely will make up for that as well.The ongoing festival won‚Äôt be running forever, so you need to hurry up and visit this place if you are a die-hard fan of parathas!

Ordered two parathas - chicken and paneer, as well as lassi - sweet and namkeen. Paratha came with pickle and raita. The paratha was a tad bit salty but over all quite nice. 

All in all, decent food, nice ambience and very pocket friendly! 

Definitely coming back.

Culinary scenes have changed drastically in the city of joy in the past couple of years and it is still evolving with every passing day. Five years back who would have dreamt of molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen ice creams, vegan meats, microbreweries or something like a fusion parantha in this city? Innovation is surely the survival mantra these days and several joints have already embraced this game plan. Few days back I was there at a new-age dhaba in the city on management invitation, and I found that my observation was again proved to be correct. This place is called ‚ÄòPind Punjabi Dhaba‚Äô and it is located at Bangur Avenue in the alley just opposite the Reliance Fresh outlet. The eatery has got a bright orange name board on black background and it is really hard to miss.

Its been quite sometime from now that i had indulged in some Aloo parantha as well as a glass full of yummy lassi ,but hang on as lately,i had surprisingly got invited for a food festival involving PARANTHA‚ÄôS AND LASSI‚ÄôS when i was indeed craving for them in some sort of a way and luckily the best part is that i got a double treat of the festival with a variety of Parantha‚Äôs and lassi‚Äôs which is not just the common ones you come across but the special ones. Sounds good isn‚Äôt it ? Well yes it does as the festival which i am talking about is organised by PIND PUNJABI DHABA which is in 68/1, Bangur Avenue, Near Reliance Fresh, Block B, Bangur, Kolkata , a very easy location to find if you are familiar with Bangur bus stop .

Honestly, when I received an invitation from the Pind Punjabi Dhaba team, I was thrilled! Going to a place this far from my neighbourhood would be an adventure on its own.

Coming to the location : It is very easy to spot this Dhaba right next to a Reliance fresh outlet on Bangur Avenue.

Now the interiors : It is a small family restaurant. The utilization of the available space to the maximum impressed me. The lighting is very bright, exudes a cheerful and positive vibe. The counter which is designed like the front of a truck really catches one's attention.

The highlight of the afternoon - The food!
I was invited to be a part of the ongoing Paratha and Lassi festival.
I'll go over the items one by one.

Parathas :
‚Ä¢ Chicken Cheese Corn Paratha - the stuffing was immense and it tasted really good. Was decorated with corn. The paratha was oozing cheese with every bite.

‚Ä¢ Bharwan Machli Paratha - the quality of fish used as the stuffing was top notch and so was the taste. Recommended.

‚Ä¢ Alu Matar Paratha - the basic quintessential alu paratha with matar in it. If you want to taste the real punjabi delicacy stick to this. Will surely not disappoint you.

‚Ä¢ Kabuli Paratha - this paratha was stuffed with mutton keema and was topped with kabuli chana. Scores high on the taste factor.

‚Ä¢ Palak Paneer Paratha - this is every palak paneer lover's delight. It actually tasted brilliant. Recommended.

‚Ä¢ Jhinga Paratha - By now, we all know what this indicates. It means shrimppppsss!! And shrimps are my favourite! So I was over excited to try this item, and this was such an exquisite paratha. With every bite, I had a mouthful of shrimps. Strongly recommended.

‚Ä¢ Kashmiri Paratha - this was a surprise for me. Have you ever heard of parathas with a fruit stuffing? No, I'm sure. So here it is, a paratha which has a stuffing of fresh fruits like grapes, pomegranates and watermelons! Quite a different item for your taste bud.

‚Ä¢ Maharaja Paratha - this was the maharaja of all parathas. This had a stuffing of dry fruits which was again a surprise for me. Cashew, raisins, almonds, pistachios were found in abundance in this paratha. There was a thick layer of jam on it. However, this paratha did not suit my taste buds.

Each of the parathas were beautifully made and the size of each of them were impressive. Definitely recommended.

Now coming to the Lassi.
‚Ä¢ Pan Bahar - this was really a game changer. Never imagined a paan flavoured lassi. Full marks for this one.
‚Ä¢ Kiwi Lassi - this was a surprise too. The kiwi flavour blended too well with the yogurt and this lassi was hands down my favourite from the afternoon. Recommended.
‚Ä¢ Doodh cola - the quintessential punjabi drink. This infusion of milk and coke can lift your spirit anytime anywhere.

For desserts we were served with fruit custard. This was another favourite of mine. It was loaded with fresh fruits like grapes, pomegranates, banana and peach. Such a delightful end to a delightful afternoon.

Talking of the service, it's not very swift. However the food items are worth the wait.
Definitely worth many visits. All my love to Team Pind Punjabi Dhaba.

Pind Punjabi Dhaba can be definitely considered as the one of the finest dhabas in North Kolkata. I'm a huge fan of their food. The newer branch near Bangur is close to my home and I finally managed a visit. 

The ambience is quite nice, with beautiful paintings and the huge truck that faces you once you enter ! The menu is quite elaborate. I chose to have deewan-e-khash and a chicken paratha. 

The deewan-e-khash is a guava based drink. It's sweet, chilled and spicy. The consistency was appreciable and the flavour of guava was amazing. 

The chicken paratha came as a platter. It came with raita, achaar, onions and chillies. The paratha was cut into four quarters with a thick, infact very thick chicken stuffing, which was really impressive. The taste was equally good. I loved this a lot. 

This was an excellent meal and I was too full to have anything more. Would recommend more ppl to visit this place, which I believe is very much underrated at this moment.

Delivery issue!!! Never trust them for home delivery. The delivery boys are useless unaware of prominent locations. Make sure you have ample time to guide them of your address and a postpaid connection as if you are in prepaid you would be out of balance ha ha.. The food turned out cold on arrival as expected as lately delivered. The aloo paratha was finely prepared was tasty must admit. Adequately filled with potato masala. The paneer butter masala was cold also the container was halfly filled, don't know whether they provide that much quantity or not???

Their Aloo paratha is a must have for me whenever I am in bangur avenue.
The paratha is huge and delicious and I specially love the chilli raita and aanchar they serve with the paratha.
The place is very reasonable though being a small restaurant the seating is not that much.

If you want to order overpriced food and wait for three hours and still get nothing to eat, please go ahead and order from this restaurant. I ordered, waited, called the restaurant, got the delivery guy's number. Already my food was more than 2 hours late when they said that they had an incident. Half an hour later the delivery boy stopped picking up my constant calls and then switched off his phone. The restaurant took my number to let me know when the delivery will occur, i received no call from them and they stopped responding. In total I must have spent 20 INR calling Zomato's phone service and getting no response. If you still order from this restaurant after reading this, you must be mentally affected. This restaurant should not exist.

If there‚Äôs one thing common between the Punjabis and the Bengalis, it is, without a doubt, their love for food. For both these peoples, love and food are synonymous. And, the all-absorbing food culture of Kolkata has always embraced Punjabi cuisine with open arms. The city has a number of North Indian restaurants, and the newest kid on the block is Pind Punjabi Dhaba, located along Bangur Avenue, an area that‚Äôs growing as a food stop.

I ordered, waited, called the restaurant, got the delivery guy's number. Already my food was more than 2 hours late when they said that they had an incident. Half an hour later the delivery boy stopped picking up my constant calls and then switched off his phone. The restaurant took my number to let me know when the delivery will occur, i received no call from them and they stopped responding. In total I must have spent 20 INR calling Zomato's phone service and getting no response. If you still order from this restaurant after reading this, you must be mentally affected. This restaurant should not exist.

If there‚Äôs one thing common between the Punjabis and the Bengalis, it is, without a doubt, their love for food. For both these peoples, love and food are synonymous. And, the all-absorbing food culture of Kolkata has always embraced Punjabi cuisine with open arms. The city has a number of North Indian restaurants, and the newest kid on the block is Pind Punjabi Dhaba, located along Bangur Avenue, an area that‚Äôs growing as a food stop.

Best Not to Order food from this place unless you are happy to wait for more than 02hrs for Delivery. Food might be decent but not worth the wait.

The quality of food(veg) is too good. The staffs are good. The ambience is cosy and sweet, a good place to visit with family. The only thing which was not so good was the service, the time gap between two starters was long(although it was wirth the wait, as they say they make it all fresh).
But at the end they complimented us with ice creams. Which was a really sweet gesture on their end.‚ò∫

I went to this restaurant when It was quite late in the evening!  To my amazement our food was nice and fresh ! We ordered paneer tikka masala ; garlic nan; masala kulcha;  daal makhni and veg biryani! Biryani was really good as it was fresh and prepared differently . They call it tawa fried biryani!  Overall a nice experience but that can improve a little in service  and presentation!

Whenever comes to lip-smacking foods like kulcha,murg masala or dal tarka,i only prefer to go for Dhabas.in our city(kolkata) there‚Äôre lots of dhabas right now.recently i was invited in Pind Punjabi Dhaba with my fellow foodie friends over a food tasting session.located in 68/1 Bangur Avenue,near Reliance fresh,Block B,Bangur,Kolkata.this joint is not very spacious,around 18 -20 seater at a time.the first thing you will notice after entering there a¬†front portion of a¬†huge truck displayed¬†which was painted with varities of color inside the restaurant.colorful brick walls which was decorated with old age lanterns.most interesting part was the ceiling various types of photo frames attached over there.coming back to the food section we started with,

‚ÄãYou might come across several places in the city serving dhaba style food, but how many of them do actually put their prime focus in bringing out innovation and maintaining the essence of proper dhaba style food? Well, I have been to various dhabas across the city and what I‚Äôve found mostly is the same style of cooking, wherein two dishes of the same genre bear an almost similar taste, which actually reflects reluctance from the side of the staff. I was almost frustrated with this when I came across Pind Punjabi Dhaba ! As the name says, the food where will taste authentic as if it is brought purely from the land of Punjab. My visit to this restaurant happened through an invitation from the owner, Pawan Jaiswal, for a food tasting session. Let‚Äôs get into details !

Nice and cozy restaurant. Behaviour of the staffs are good. Good place for having North Indian food. The decoration is more like a road side dhaba and yet well maintained. And the punjabi music just brings the feel. The tandoori chicken is delicious and Amritsari biriani is jucy and spicy. Moreover the quality of food is good and quantity is sufficient. The sweet lassi is thick and beautifully balanced. Services are a bit slow. I wish the restaurant was bigger so that they could accommodate more people.

Another one in Bangur !!

I had placed my order on phone and went to collect it 15 mintues post the told time, still  had to wait for another 10 minutes

There was no place to sit and wait, as the restaurant is damn cozy with 5-6 tables in total
(more or less like a coffee shop)

Now, lets talk about our dinner, which was a complete North-Indian vegetarian meal

A disappointing first experience, and a last one too for sure

The breads were just fine
Panner Butter Masala was tasteless and drenched in oil
Dal Makhani was pretty average too

Definitely not worth of what it charges !!

This new joint will surely get good response, or rather should definitely get one!! Warm welcome, keen on understanding the customer's need and fast service! I ordered Paneer Tikka Masala, Dal Makhni, Masala Kulchha, Garlic Naan and Veg Biryani. The food was well-presented and served hot. The Breads were soft and butter-loaded (Full-on punjabi style)!!! Coming to Veg Biryani, it wasn't Dum Biryani but Tawa-Fried which is their speciality!! Overall a Happy Experience. Recommended. :)

Been here on a saturday....
Service is slow...bt can be adjusted as this is a new place...
Food Ordered: Chicken Bharta, Daal Tarka and Tandoori Roti.

Chicken bharta was good. Daal Tarka was okayish bt the tandoor roti was awefully bad. Since, we have opted for plain tandoori roti without butter, it was absolutely crispy, as if we were having papad with Sabji. The thickness was not proper and they took too much time bringing it on to the table probably bcoz of that the Roti had gone hard.

Awfully bad place. Had ordered food from here. Got the wrong order delivered. The curries did not look pleasing or edible at all. Moreover, the staff who attended me on phone when I called them to tell them about the fault, tried to make me understand that it was as if they had done a favour by providing me with food.

While Passing through Reliance Fresh i saw a glowy signage board largely named PIND PUNJABI DHABA.I must say Their sign board is as good as their ambience.Anyway visited there and ordered Paneer butter masala and Butter Naan.And it was like wow.The staff were bit of on the lower side as in they didnt have much idea regarding the menu.I visited in the afternoon so service was quick.Have seen in previous reviews that their service is poor.But i think as because this is new to the lane so i guess they might need a bit time to settle up.End of the day food was fantabulous.So i went back with a 5 star rating.Will visit soon again and wanted to try Punjabi Tadka.Over all i was fully satisfied with the food.

I feel like giving -150 rating to this place. Did not know that a place could be as horrible as this. Why did this place open? It seems that the owners themselves eat from here because other sensible commoners do not want to get duped for life threatening spicy food. I heard that this place is nice and decided to order from here. I REGRET MY DECISION. I PITY MYSELF. The food available is quite expensive and upon that it tastes like some edible shit which is sprinkled with a huge amount of spices. I feel nauseated after eating from here. Why did I choose this place? Maybe I was out of my mind. Sorry! But this is the worst place one can have food from in this entire world. Never go to this please untill and unless you want to punish yourself for some really serious offense which you have commited. THIRD CLASS FOOD! STREET FOOD IS INFINITE TIMES BETTER. Please never go to this place. DISGRACE TO COOKING AND RESTAURANT BUSINESSE!

Ok so its a new place with good ambience and all blah blah blah... But at the end of the day if the food is not good all this things does not matter...
Yesterday I ordered one plate of tandoori  chicken from here and i must say that was yakkk!!! I don't even know why they added capsicum & tomato in tandoori chicken..
After that shit kind of food the deleivery boy who deleivered the food was asking me for the tip.... I just didn't got the point that I stay in bangur just one lane behind this restaurant why I will give you any tip for covering such a small distance and I think whether to give a tip or not depends on the customer u can't just ask them... Ya if the customer is satisfied by your service they will give you the tip happily.... 

Lastly I would suggest not to opt this place for dining...
Better try out veggie delight in bangur.
If there would be a option for 0 rating I would have preferred that...
Horrible experience

A new kid on the block, but when u walk in u r amazed with the interiors.
A typical north indian restaurant, with an average variety on food (no mocktails at all).
The biggest minus - me and my friends on entering were not at all welcomed to the restaurant.
The food i ordered (rather tried ordering) the waiter didnt seem to know much about it. It has just launched and i saw fair amount of customers in the restaurants.
Ordered - Paneer Hariyali Tikka, Paneer Butter Masala and 1 butter naan and 2 amritsari kulcha
The starters i believed were not fresh, but the main course really changed our thought
The rotis were perfect, it took them a lil time to bring our order but in the end i liked it
Lets see if we visit again or not..!!

Firstly whoever rated this place 5 and 3 I don't know if the review is a family person or a friend. 

I am the third person to give the review. 

Trust please you should shut down your place. 
Learn some management skills and also basic courtesy . 

On the 31st of July I went to this place. 
We reached there at 9:20( enough time for the restaurant to be ready for the dinner pressure). 
There are exactly 5 tables in the place. Out of which one table was empty. 
The moment we placed the order the person( supposed to be the owner/ patter of the place) said ma'am please place the order at one go we have a lot of pressure and waiting) we will take 30 mins to provide with the food. 
I wonder you have 5 tables out of which 4 are full. What pressure are you talking about ? 

Never mind. 
To speed up of the order we placed all order at one go. 
At 10:00 we asked the waiter how long will he take to give us the starter ( tandoori Aalo) which is was one item out of the 3 which is there in the menu. It was said while placing the order that the other two items in the menu would take time. If the starter which shouldn't take time took more than 45 mins ago don't know what would the other items take. 

When I asked the waiter about the starter he said he is checking and letting me know after that waiter vanished. 

After waiting for 15 mins I reach the counter as there was no one approachable. When I said how long will he take he says ma'am what was the order ( we were the only person who placed the order and waiting) others had left and one new customers had just entered who had not yet placed the order as well. 
So they don't even know what is happening in their place.  I had even added that I am coming from Bhowanipore I need to leave if you can't provide me with the food.

That confused guy made me wait at the counter for 5 mins more. 
At last I lost my patience I said forgot it we are leaving . 
The worst and shocking part of the situation is no one apologised. 
And I again went to him and mentioned that it's surprising that being in the service industry how can you not say sorry. ( in presence of the owner). Still No one apologised. 
How can you afford to annoy your customers and let them leave and not even apologies. 
That's one thumb rule of hotel management, basic courtesy and manners. 

I haven't tasted the food, still I will never walk into this place anymore. Would never recommend this place to anyone. 

The owner please note that u have opens this place in Bangur. Your 90% customers are going to be from Bangur itself. 
If u offend customers like me who stays in the same lane ( my moms place) who had a bad experience, would ask people not to go there. 

How will you run this place?? When people walk out without eating. 
You are not doing us a favour by serving food. 
A place like has many places where people can go for food. N let me tell you that area u will get many places to go n eat. 
Be thankful to us that we waited for 45 mins n not eat. 

I will make sure my friends and neighbours don't walk into your place as it's insulting go this place where they don't consider their customers as priority. 

Horrible experience it sum up. 

Everyone has loads of time.. Like 3 hours to sit n wait for them this place is apt. üëçüèª
