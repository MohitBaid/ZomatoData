Very bad food!!! Wish I could give it -1. The penne pasta tasted as if someone mixed sugar cubes with the pasta. Too sweet . Very much dissapointed.

1- Chicken in hot garlic sauce: The dish was not very spicy and it came with a perfect amount of gravy which went perfectly with the rice.   2. Chicken in schezwan gravy: This one was a little on the spicier side and the quantity was just fine.   3. Veg Schezwan Fried Rice: The rice was perfectly cooked and stir-fried with the right amount of vegetables.    In totality the meal was absolutely great and enough for four. @Urjashi bhar

Today I took home delivery from here. The food was sooo bad that I couldn't even finish . Chilli chicken was the only thing I could eat. Too spicy and chowmein was smelling like medicine . Just horrible.

A new marvelous addition in our locality. I have ordered here couple of times. Food quality and quantity is good in respect to the prices. If you want to have a taste of Chinese food in Bijoygarh, then this is a must visit.

প্রযুক্তি এগিয়েছে। এগিয়েছে আমাদের খাদ্যাভ্যাস।

রেস্তোরাঁর নামেও ও অভিনবত্ব এসেছে।

কম দামে ভাল চাইনীজ খাবার।

আপনি একা?, খাবারের সংগী পাচ্ছেন না ?। অথচ জানেন এক

প্লেট আপনি শেষ করতে পারবেন না। কারন বেশিরভাগ

চাইনীজ রেস্তরাঁয় এক প্লেটে দুই তিনজনের খাবার থাকে, যা

সাধারন একজনের পক্ষে শেষ করা সম্ভব নয় ( আমাকে বাদ

দিয়ে)। তবে এটি আপনার গন্তব্য। এক প্লেট একজনের জন্যে

সঠিক।

মিক্সড গ্রেভি নুডলস অর্ডার দিয়েছিলাম। ভাল। তবে হালকা

আঁশটে গন্ধ। চিকেন, প্রন, ডিমের পরিমান ভালই।

চিলি চিকেন ও মিক্সড নুডলস পেট ভরিয়ে দেবে।

Tweet & eat is a new eatery in bijoygarh area. This place offers decent food at low prices. Services of swiggy are available for this joint.

I availed the following items:-

1. Veg chow combo - This consists of half plate of veg chow & 3pcs of chilli chicken. The chowmein was decent with ample vegetables & was good in taste. Oil content was on the lower side. The chilli chicken had generous amount of gravy with onions & capsicums. The chilli chicken had pure chicken & not just loads of batter. Value for money combo!!

2. Chicken drumsticks - 4 pcs of juicy spicy chunky chicken drumsticks were provided. They dont have option of more than 4pcs. The drumsticks were fantastic to eat. Perfect balance of flavours with tender fresh chicken. The batter was hardly present which was a positive. Recommended!!

3. Hot & sour soup(chicken) - A bowl of spicy hot & sour soup containing generous chicken chunks,chopped vegetables. The balance of hot & sour was just about right without overpowering both the elements. The soup was thick as it how should be. Very soothing & delicious to say the least.

They have wide choices for food items at affordable prices without compromising of quality. Worth the try if you are looking for affordable snacks/dinner home delivered.

P.s. Pics have been posted separately.

This place is a stoner's paradise. Great menu that does not punch a dent in your wallet. What does a stoner loves more! Lovely combos available. The specially good ones are the crispy baby corn and and the honey glazed chicken. Occasionally, you can order the pasta which is also a deal-breaker at such a price. The owner and the staffs are quite cordial and are there to serve you, always with a smile. So , what do you want more?

And yes, you can use the in-house WiFi to surf the internet also. 

So, what are you waiting for?

An amazing place to be with your loved ones, the staff members are truly professional and love the way they deal with all their customers. Speaking of the ambience its way par. However as I was in a hurry so i couldn't enjoy the ambience and had to take away my order. We took chicken gravy noodles and trust me i kept licking the spoon. It was just absolutely delicious. A perfect chinese corner in the city finally and I will definitely come next time to this place, get into the mood of the environment, sit and enjoy my hot meal. Till then a 4.5 star is what I would like to rate this place. To all the chinese dish lovers in the city, this is place to bookmark in your list. Thank You
