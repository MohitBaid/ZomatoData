There are few experiences in life which remains unforgettable not just because if the moments you enjoyed, but, also because of the realisation that in future you need not face further disappointment. My experience with Food Carnival was that of the latter one.

Being located at a good location just beside the Jalan College, almost hugging the SBI ATM, this is a place for wasting your money (what irony) and gaining experience in life.

I happened to have roll from this place which till date had been the worst in my whole not-so-great life. It was of such pathetic taste that even the thought of the taste gives me a sick feeling. I reckon that it was a stale roll warmed up to get rid of and also earn money from it.

Though not being a street stall, it serves pathetic good worse than any road side vendor. Instead of wasting your health, taste, peace of mind and your temper there, I would recommend you to make a U turn and opt for a glass of lemonade.

A Visit to be Avoided!

Among the many food joints in college street there are few which puts a bad impression in the first place. My first experience at Food Carnival was bitter. I took their Chicken Chow as take away to have it at home. Food was worthless of a Penny. The chowmine was very low quality and much oily. Didn't like it a bit.

Me being a resident of college street it is one of the eating places i look forward to when i want to grab an evening snack...its basically a fast food centre featuring a restaurant on the second floor of the building...never really had the oppurtunity to sit down and grab a meal..so i generally go for a quick bite..but the dish that really stands out here are the mohlai dishes...mixed moghlai is probably the best moghlai u will ever have

Food Carnival holds a prime location in College Street in between all the colleges and do prepare one of the worst food you will find in College Street.
I tired their Chowmine and Chicken lolypop and both were horrible. The Chowmine tastes like some cheap footpath shops. The Ketchup they used were very low quality and the salad given on the Chowmine was similar to the one the road side shops give.
And then they charge us Rs.70 for Egg chow and Rs.90 for Chicken. Not even half worth of the money.
Not recommend at all.

We had chicken lollypop, egg chicken chowmin, hot & sour chicken. Food was better than expected. Price is reasonable. Service is good. If someone is in College Street they can try out this restaurant.

Had Chicken Roll , Chicken Steam Momo and Moghlai Parathas many times from here.
Food quality is good and tasty. Ambience is bad not much to talk about here. It's best to go for takeway or you can eat here standing.
Overall an okayish experience.
