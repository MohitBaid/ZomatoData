Tasted their non veg thali once and it tasted okaish when I was literally dying in hunger after a hectic schedule. It was quite a pocket friendly thali including good quantity of rice, 3 pieces of chicken kasha, dal, cauliflower curry and one gulab jamun. Each of the item was good, nothing extraordinary. Definitely a good option when you need a tummy filled lunch at low price.

Ordered a Chicken Thali from here for lunch from Zomato and it took about 2hrs​ to deliver me, just 2km away. By the time the food reached me it was awful in taste. Only the rice was good. Chicken was so bad that I couldn't have a piece even. Dal and sabji was average.
I don't think I will be ordering from here again. Very poor quality food. Quantity is sufficient for an adult but quality is worst.

this is the worst restaurant ever, if you want to have the food you have to order at least one day earlier, because they don't serve the food in time, and sometimes after waiting for the food they just cancels your order, and their opening hours is till 9pm,i mean seriously guys?? please update the timing.

this is the third time in a row that I have ordered the food through Zomato and got the parcel delivered delayed by more than more than one hour. So callous are the front office ladies of Alibaba that they pass on lame excuses and even hands over wrong phone numbers of delivery boys. Heights of unprofessional attitude and ill trained staff who don't know the meaning of customer service. I don't think I will ever return  to order food from these guys. Delayed delivery is the new normal for these guys. Pathetic.

Not happy with the thali at all. The flavour and spice was missing. It was bland in taste. The egg thali is better than the nonveg one. It offers a range of food that too in good quantity. But the quality and taste could have been better.

I think alibaba is offering a very competent meal at a very economic price point.I mean one cant expect lot many things in 90 rs but once you purchase this thali you wont be regretting.There are fine grain rice with glimpse of vegetables,portion of dal,portion of subzi & chicken cury (4 small pcs) & a tiny gulab jamoon. All the preparations are above average taste wise & sufficient for a quick lunch for someone with medium appetite.There are options for vegetarian & eggetarians as well.This product should do good provided correct promotion is done. Bon apetit.

Alibaba Thali sells the cheapest thalis ever. They are tasty and economical too. Best thing is that it's delivered hot and quick. Very satisfied with the taste and service.

I'd ordered for Non veg Thali which consisted of rice, dal, vegetables, chicken curry and a gulab jamun. The packing was very good with machine sealed sectioned plastic tray. The food quality was not too good but for Rs.90 you can't really bargain much these days with a full meal. Portion size was enough for one person.
