Food- quality 4.5, quantity- 5 
Service - 5
Price- 5
We had a couple of club sandwiches and the content quantity amazed us for the price very legit and rather lesser than what we have to pay for the same somewhere else. Value for money guarenteed but not cheap in terms of quality.

Good food but poor service. Ordered 4 cheese daveli from swiggy but got only one, that too without cheese the plain one. A genuine feedback from next time do check the order before giving.

Not upto the mark to my opinion.Ordered corn sandwich and cheese sandwich where corn sandwich was sweet in taste and cheese sandwich was spicy. Quantity wise good but quality lacks, the chilly sauce was so strong that it made burning feeling in my mouth. I will not revisit this place for sure.

Ordered the below items few days ago through Swiggy.

Cheese Garlic Bread
Grilled Masala Toast
Veggie Mexican Pizza
Chatpata Samosa Corn Cheese Sandwich

Nothing special about any of the above. Items were average or below average in taste. Prices were reasonable. Veggie Mexican Pizza was worst of them all.

Nothing much! Haha, I had a bottle of Cola to refresh my throat. Though enjoyed it, yet got a chance to review the place. But long ago, I had grilled cheese sandwich, which I remember, tasted fairly well.

low on cash? This place is the solution. Sandwiches that can fill your stomach at one go. Taste? Delicious. Must try! Bombay sandwich is highly recommended!

After trying the lake town outlet, tried the baguihati outlet while passing by. The food was similar. I had a white sauce pasta and a grilled potato sandwich. They were good. The sandwich came with french fries.

This is a new snacks corner in baguihati. On our way back we halted at this place, it's a small open place with few seats. We quickly navigated through the menu and ordered a cheese vada pav, a green apple krusher, a cheese dabeli, and a Maggi green chilli. The cheese vada pav was very nicely made, was hot had cheese and mayonnaise, the patty was tasty, also the green chutney provided was spicy and lip smacking. As the chutney was spicy ordered a krusher. It was very small in size though well made. Ice was missing so we had to ask for it separately. Then came the Maggi green chilli which was again well made and hot. It had cheese content as well. My partner couldn't finish it so we got it parcelled. The cheese dabeli was hot but didn't satisfy me, not tasty or worth RS 50 to be true. Overall the experience was good at Toaste Adda would visit again and again.
