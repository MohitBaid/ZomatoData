Ordered through swiggy - from salt lake - not really sure if its this branch. But anyway, coming to the food, both chicken and mutton were tasty. Pulao quantity is small but its nice. The paratha was really dry and elastic. Also they missed delivering one item which was sent separately after i lodged a complaint with swiggy. 
But food taste is definitely nice - worth a try.

Ohh..Its definitely going to give you the tastiest version of any Bengali appetiser/dish..But oh boy! If you are a foodie, and I mean a real Bengali Foodie, then do order a double for yourself, because the tiny quantity might quench your tastebud, but not please the sac inside. The fish/mutton fries/samosa no wonder the yummiest, triggered such fire inside me, that I felt like gobbling up the entire food-display smirking at me. Well, the Rs. 80 or Rs. 100 size is nothing bigger than the baby food served at any restaurant, world wide. Coming to the proper ala carte  items..thats a big LAUGH OUT LOUD.. I had guests and ordered mutton kasha and pulao separately, expecting to share each among two. But who knew what a laughter show awaited for us. The pulao, came in a tiny aluminium box, one in which onion pickle is usually served. And the mutton, only 4, tiniest boneless pieces, in a box slightly bigger than the former. Was that a joke? I probably should have ordered 2 of those for each of my guests. What a waste of appetite. The price is definitely worth the quality, buy not worth the proportion. Think twice if you are reaaaally starving.

I had placed my first order for a home delivery that comprised of Fish fries, phulkopir singara and mochar chop. The well mannered delivery person handed over the pack which did not contain the fish fries when I opened it. Immediately let them know and they sent the fries to my place. Coming to the food it was less than ordinary and in one sentence I can only say "Disappointed Much". I know places with gigantic and super tasty fish fries for 70/ rupees. So lots of improvements needed both in taste and size.

Opposite to bazaar kolkata near the ballygunge AC market you will find this small store selling peeping hot fish items at a very affordable price. Getting real hungry after a lot of shopping I ordered a bhetki batter fry. It was served in no time with mustard and chilli. Stuffed with ample amount of basa , crisp from outside and a tender layer inside , the fry tasted heavenly. Also the stuff is very well behaved. Definitely going to try their other delicacies. Just to mention they charge 12% gst. Definitely recommended. :)

A place to get all types of fried fish items, Machhli Baba also has other items like ghugni, paratha, pulao, kosha mangsho etc. All item quantities are prepared for one person. There are a couple of chairs placed outside the shop where you can sit down and have your good, but it's better to pack and take home or have it on the go. I have tried the Bhetki fish fry and the Machher Chop. The filling in both were substantial, the crumbing was thinking, and the taste was good. It wasn't too oily and packed nicely. Overall, a slightly fancier place to have your regular fish fries and fish chops!

Bengalis find it difficult to have a meal without fish in the platter. So these quirky named outlets, coming with crispy fishy snacks are just spoiling us like anything. Machli baba's offering from chops, cutlets to fish fries and fish fingers are toooo yummy. I had an interaction with one of the owners  who also happen to be our first 'topshe', a few months back. He is really very passionate to reach out to the ever growing fishy appetite of bengalis. I recommend this outlet as it is  a must visit for all.

Picked up food items quite a few times from this outlet such as Mochar Chop,Fish Chop,Chicken Cutlet,Prawn Cutlet and Phulkopir Singhara.

All items have the right amount of seasoning and fried pretty well using good oil.

Packaging is also good and prices are reasonable.

Machhli Baba Fries is a happening fixture in the Bengali food scene in Kolkata; they've introduced some Bong favorites like pomfret fry, mochar chop, kosha mangsho etc. The name alludes to the famous Machhli Baba character in Ray's film Joi Baba Felunath. 
We being personally acquainted with the owner, none other than Topshe from Sonar Kella (who also runs the Bhojohori Manna outlets), had been warmly invited to try their new offerings.
We indulged in savouring their Kolkata Bhetki Fry, Kolkata Bhetki Batter Fry, Mutton Chop and Mutton Cutlet.
The fries were delicious, prepared and stuffed with the freshest quality bekti fish, coated well with the perfectly crisp batter and bread crumbs. The chops and cutlet too were tastefully pleasant.
For quality taste, smell and feel of quintessential Bengali "fish fry" or other lovely snacks and goodies, one can check out these quirkily-named outlets.

The Diamond Cut Fish Fry is the most true representation of what authentic Bengali gastronomic delight stands for. It is reminiscent of typical Bangali Biyebarir Bhoj where people gathered in sultry evenings would endure the extreme test of temptation by soaking in the smell of bhetki pervaded everywhere. Secret lies in well-marinated superior quality fish garbed in a perfectly crisp coat. I had smuggled half a dozen of these for my friends at Bangalore and it tasted equally good even after the passing away of half a day.
For not so bright days, the paratha and aloor dam will substantially weave in its magic.
This joint is a MUST for everyone out there.

Too overpriced as per quality. The staffs don't know how to behave with customers. The prices in the counter had prices written without taxes applied. During payment the staff asked for extra payment. Upon enquiry they said GST is applicable. But on the display counter they didn't have any mention of that. When I said that the staff started arguing and behaved very badly. Not recommended at all.

We ordered for chicken cutlet and Kolkata bhetki fry. This is  the second time and unfortunately the delivery boy is never on time. Coming to taste,the Bhetki fry was good (nothing extraordinary) but the chicken cutlet was just okayish. We hardly understood the taste of chicken. We were also disappointed with the size as the prices are pretty high. Compared to other shops of similar domain, Machlibaba needs to improve the size and taste of their products. Moreover the prices given in Zomato are not the actual prices. There has been price revision which is not updated. Hence I won't suggest people to visit this food junction.

Tried out this outlet yesterday - Mutton cutlet, approximately 55 to 60% of "apparently mutton mince" and rest "fillings" - overpriced at Rs. 76 plus taxes; mutton singara - hardly any mutton but full of soya mince!!! Grossly overpriced at Rs. 40.00. The mistake was probably opting for mutton from a joint that uses fish as the brand name!!!

I had ordered for 3 bhetki fries at 7 pm and confirmed that they would be sending within 45 minutes. But to our dismay, it is 9.30 now, but the order has still not been delivered. We have contacted them over phone several times and every time they assured that the delivery boy was out and would be reaching any minute. Regret to state that such callous and unprofessional approach is uncalled for from a reputed concern as yours.

Macchli Baba Fries in Lake View Road is a new joint that serves good fried fish, egg and chicken items. Those fond of Fish and deep fried item can have some fresh stuff. Better to pack things and have it at home if you stay nearby. Good effort from our very own Topshe, Mr. Siddhartha Chatterjee.

There's only one set of chair,which was preoccupied.So it's just like a food stall.No place to sit.

I just took the bhetki fry( fish fry).
It costs rs.110, including the 18% gst.
The crust is super thin,crispy.
The slice was really thin too,but absolutely fresh and perfect in taste.
But considering rs. 110 for one thin fish fry,where its competitors are providing 2fries (not so good in quality but still) in the same cost,makes it unreasonable, especially to us college students.

It's a one of a kind fried fish joint which is slowly carving a niche of its own. Visited this place last month and it was a good experience. Had been looking forward to visiting Topshe's brain child. We had bhetki fry, prawn cutlet, chicken cutlet and fish roll. Everything was fresh and tasted great. Personal favorite was the bhetki and fish roll( which had a few Bones in it). They also serve porota,alur dom which is great. Haven't tried that yet. But looking forward to my best visit.

A very recent venture by the much famed Bhojohori Manna group. They have earlier launched a raw fish retailing chain by this name. Now here comes this. 
Few days back, while passing by, came to this place to try out some fries. Tried the Maachher Chop and Fish Fry. 
Maachher Chop - Tasted very good. Charged around 35 INR, I don't think that the fish was Bhetki. There was a fish bone in the chop which needs to be checked further. The minced fish tasted good otherwise, so was the coating and the crumb. 
Kolkata Bhetki Fry - The typical Bangali Fish Fry. Cut into diamond shapes and then fried, this item was nothing extraordinary. Okay for trying once. 
Nothing fancy, nothing exclusive. Pricing is pocket friendly. Good to grab some munchies if you're in this area the next time.

A spin off from Bhaja Hari Manna this place is destined to make a place in the hearts of the fish loving Bengalis. The menu boasts the classics from a Bengali Kitchen and provides the ideal quick bite to the thousands of people who flock in Gariahat for shopping. The place is small and moderately priced. The food is good and the service is swift. However it gets crowded at times and can make you cramped for space.
