1st of all, it's a mid budget resturent basically. Don't expect as too high! But overall of all,like normal casual dining it's value for money. I tasted biriyani. It's quiet good

The delivery guy doesn't know his way around the place and asks you to come and get the food. Food is never delivered at home if you need it. If you go and collect the food from the delivery guy, still you have to pay the delivery fee.

Never ordered food from here, but as takeaway, its really nice. The price is good, the  taste is good and service is also good. Chinese items and rolls are a speciality. Biriyani doesnt live uo to the standards

I have ordered from this place twice now. Quantity wise it was quite adequate both times. The first order was for chicken noodles and it was pretty well made. The other order was for steamed rice, tadka dal and spicy garlic chicken. The quality of rice was quite good and the tadka was very well made. The chicken gravy was very nice, however the pieces were not really good and that is the only thing which made me give them a 3.5 instead of 4. Will reorder.

Situated right beside where I stay..the Urban spoon is a big no no to anyone whose looking out to order food! The quality as well as quantity of food keeps on varying every time I order food. You never know when your luck is bad to get bad and just full of oil n gravy prepared dish!!! Price is fine for all items but they don't serve well!!

To start with location.
The location is not very good . Its in a "koona"
Food is average.. From biryani to noodles.
Sometimes staff is helpful some very arrogant.

No place to sit properly.
Overall its an average..

the home delivery staff is absolutely illmannered.he does not know the way to speak to a lady.this kind of attitude is not expected from a good restaurant like this.whenever I call for home delivery my food is never delivered.the home delievery staff tells me to come and collect the food and says he will not deliver.I am a regular customer of the restaurant since the time it is opened so at least this kind of pathetic and unacceptable behaviour we dont expect from your restsurant for us.I am writing this review because this has literally happened so many times which is horrible which has forced me to write this.

The restaurant is good and has an excellent crew. The food delivered is really good at such a low price. The people are friendly. One drawback is the size of the restaurant preventing proper sitting arrangements. But it's excellent for take aways and home delivery option. You may also want to sit and enjoy a roll or take a quick snack. The restaurant comes equipped with both Indian and Chinese food. The owner/manager is really friendly.
