It's an okay kinda restaurant. Not so great food. However I liked the tandoori fish item. It tasted good. 
Food quality is average. Service is moderate.

Food =2/5. Ambience= -5/5. Worst atmosphere. If you are building a Bar + restaurant then you must have both separated. People who are going with their family gets very uncomfortable. Food quality not so good. Dont go for Chinese dishes here. Waiter was suggesting Indian dishes so it might be like Indian dishes will be better but I have not tried. Price wise its good. Staff is also well behaved. Friends hangout can be done here, but no family get together.

What was wrong with this place? EVERYTHING! Starting from small variation of food available, to the behaviour of the staff, to the quantity of food served! We ordered 3 egg hkka noodles. When it arrived, one was in a single bowl Nd the other two in a "double pprtion bowl". The quantity was so little that even after the waiter served the food, one of my friends plate was EMPTY!! All the chicken dishes tasted the same!

It's the worst restuarant I have ever visited. Terrible food taste nd quantity. And also the behaviour of the staffs is also disgusting. One advice any one can batter prefer roadside food stalls than this restuarant. Overall horrible experience, moreover Kolkata people or outsiders nt native to here, never try here

Interiors are clean and airy, but food is of medium quality. Relatives took us to this roadside restaurant for lunch during pujas. We had crispy chicken and veg. hakka noodles which were enough to make one's stomach full. To sum up, food served here is not-so-good but okay.

Oddly enough, the food is good, the waiters are attentive (some are a bit dumb), the inside is friendly, despite being almost empty all the time. Has separate family area so even if it's a alcohol serving place, you need not worry of noisy drunk people.

Went to this place. They have renovated the interiors which is a good thing. We ordered tandoori chicken and crispy babycorn. The tandoori chicken took quite long to arrive but nevertheless it was tasty. The baby corn was nicely cooked in sauces with onions and garlic, but the coating on the babycorn was thick and not appealing. The staffs are really very well behaved. They could improve the ambience by totally separating the bar part and the restaurant part

I have had only bad experiences in this restaurant.

The first time,they had run out of biriyani after taking our order.
The second time I had hair in my dish of chicken drumsticks and the waiter argued it wasnt there when he served.

People generally go there for a drink.
I am not going to this place again.
