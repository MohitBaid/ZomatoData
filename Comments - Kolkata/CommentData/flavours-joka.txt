Another fail of Zomato, point goes to Swiggy. Ordered chicken biriyani, overall 116/- (including packaging and delivery charge), worth the money. Just when I opened the container, the room filled with the aroma which can make any well fed person famished. Looking forward to order again.

Ordered fish pulao & boneless chicken butter masala...fish pulao was so so....the fish in it was good! Boneless chicken butter masala was total disaster really...small rocks & sand was in it,, I just vomited out! Yuck! They should take care of the quality of the food & change the chef! Otherwise this joint will no more! (Ordered through zomato)

I wanted to try their unique type of roll known as Bong Roll as it was suggested by my friend but sadly it wasn't available so I went for Y2K Roll parcel. It was basically a normal chicken roll with boiled egg stuffed inside instead of omlette. The roll wasn't that great, even its uniqueness could not surprise me, instead the normal Egg Chicken roll would have been better. This place has got seating also. Looking forward to try something different next time.

Kindly post menu. Without it its hard to decide what to eat. waiting for the menu. Upload Menu with proper price listings.  I often found that the restaurant is closed.  Please mention its proper timings also

It's a special experience for me.I had a chicken cheese momo in flavours.It was awsome I never had this kind of food in other restuarants. I saw a new kind of rolls in their menu  like y2k roll ,bongs roll, millenum roll,roll e khas . I tried y2k roll it was very gud.
