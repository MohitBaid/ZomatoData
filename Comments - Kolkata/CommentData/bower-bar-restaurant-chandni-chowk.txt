Good place for drinking and munching with your friends, that's about it. Price is reasonable however service is not good, also this place needs a makeover in terms of ambience.

OLD MEMORIES HAUNT ME OF THIS PLACE.ALTHOUGH THE GRADE OF CROONERS ARE NOT LIKE LATE 90S STILL MALE SINGER LIKE HIRAK SAKARI AND FEMALE SINGER LIKE SONU IS QUITE GOOD.SERVICE AND HOSPITALITY IS STILL GOOD.FOOD QUALITY HAS GONE DOWN.OVERALL CARE BY PROP.MR SAIGAL IS VERY CORDIAL AND FRIENDLY.HOPE TO VISIT THIS PLACE VERY SOON AND REGULARLY AS I STILL RECALL THE EVENINGS OF 90S WHEN LOBO AND MISHRAJEE AND SINGERS LIKE TAPAS,JHUMA DUTTA,ASLAM AND OTHERS REIGNED.ALL THE BEST WISHES TO MR SAIGAL AND ALL THE STAFFS
