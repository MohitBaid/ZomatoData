Mamma's Bakery Point is an initiative by a Home Baker and a lovely mother who makes fantastic eggless and egg desserts :) 
We were presented a box of desserts from here which had two flavours of pastries namely- Mocha and Chocolate Truffle. The pastries were made neatly and looked pretty in its own way.

Mocha- This was very soft and light and will leave a subtle flavour of coffee on our palettes.

Truffle - This tasted like the usual dark chocolate Truffle pastry but was very light and the flavours were good .

One can definitely try out the pastries from this home Bakery and can place orders for small get-together or house/office parties .

Nabanita Datta's Mamma's Bakery Point(new town) is another feather in her cap. A successful mother, wife, home maker and now a fab Home-Baker. Her cakes are pure indulgence. She specializes in bulk or corporate orders across the city. Mini orders from salt lake, rajarhat, lake town and many parts of the city.
 
The Kesar Badam and Moccha were killer.

Kesar Badam - Subtle flavours with a hint of novelty, unlike many butterscotch cakes that I have had. It's a must try.

Moccha - I'm a coffee lover and frankly I'm partial about coffee based cakes, but if so are you then this one is surely worthy of a try.

Truffle - if you are a Chocolate person then look know more coz this is the one for you. Rich and creamy cakes that will surely win you heart.

Red Velvet : It looked alluring, dosed perfectly with a creamy white chocolate. While I'm not a fan of red velvet cakes in general, you can surely give it a try if you are a white chocolate kinda person.

All the cakes were freshly made, soft and rich in texture. I was happy with the kind of ingredients used. 

I wish Mamma's Bakery Point all the very best for the future.

Another jewel of a homemaker based out of Rajarhat. She specialises in baking and runs many a classes/workshops at her place. Nabanita Dutta is a new age mom who also runs her own entrepreneurial bakery. She operates from home, that does not stop her from making stupendous tier cakes, theme cakes, designed cakes. She takes bulk orders as well.
I was delighted to try her signature flavored pastries.

We will start with the red velvet pastry. The best of the lot. The beautiful red and white color display catches ones eye. The eye for detailing is quite evident. The red is not overpowering. Using a spongy base, the cake is excellent. The texture is smooth, and does not leave a buttery after taste. 

Mocha flavored Pastry: Strong coffee flavour bellowed in every bite. Layered with tiled dark chocolate bits, it's a sight to behold. The base was quite spongy but not watery. The cake was not overdone or underdone, just about perfect!

Truffle flavored pastry: The softest sponge cake smeared with light chocolate; sandwiched between two layers. The chocolate consistency and the thickness was just perfect. Pretty decorations using frosted cream added much to the visual appeal of the slice.

Kesar Pista flavored pastry: Rich in color, perfect sweetness. The rich saffron color added to the richness of the cake. The nuts were glazed and placed at correct intervals in the cake slice. Too much of these would have taken away the taste of the cake. 

I really liked how the thin icing was used to write the names of the cake types. Definitely recommended for parties at home, at office, at get togethers!
