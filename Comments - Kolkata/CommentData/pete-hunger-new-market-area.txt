Nothing special but good as a food stop during shopping! They've few Chinese combos at cheap price . Tried their rice and chilly chicken combo. It was veg rice which was tasty but chilli chicken lacked the taste. But you can't really expect more at 60₹!

When we have empty pockets but wanna fill our tummy and don't want to eat the tandoori roti and veg items beside indian museum we vist this place to have the chicken combo. Its bang for the buck. But the recent aam pora sharbat is like giving ur money to have colored water.. Ha ha.. And be sure to watch your back cause you don't know when a car gonna bump you up.

A very small joint in the bylanes of new market... also very pocket friendly too... zero ambience and deco... no proper seating arrangements available... I parcled one of the combo... consisting of 2 pcs of chilli chicken and sufficient quantity of veg noodles... tasted okish... service was fast... staffs are friendly too...

Small snacks outlet with 3-4 tables to sit. Serves rice, chowmin, momos and sandwiches. I ordered veg grill sandwich which was above average in taste but price was bit high. There's nothing much to say about this outlet. Serves quick bite snacks and you may try once ro strike your hunger.

A small joint located in between new empire and city mart. Situated right opposite to the scoop.

Tried their combo comprised with noodle and chilli Chicken which was not up to the mark. Service was fast though but nothing special to mention but a pocket friendly option around here.

Went for a Non-Veg Combo here. Comprised of Rice and Chilli Chicken. Tastewise it was not up to the mark, but since we  were short of money, we could not complain much. Service time was fast, but I would prefer avoiding this place.

Today i had lunch with my colleague at this place. This small joint is located at just opposite of scoop. People mostly opt for the combo meals @ 50(non veg/veg).

So we had 1 non veg combo & 1 veg combo. The non veg combo offers veg rice/chow along with 2 pcs of chilli chicken while the veg combo gives you paneer. Taste wise the combos were okayish though the quantity of rice/chow is very minimal to say the least & i mean well below the average quantity for any cheap combo roadside stalls. Could be skipped

After paying a visit to the Indian Museum from morning we decided to eat something and found combo. We took non-veg combo. It had veg fried rice / veg chowmein with chilli chicken (2 pcs.) and two kinds of sauce. Delivery time is really fast. Taste wise its not something very good or extraordinary kind of thing but its okay to the taste buds. Happy eating!

Very small joint in new market area near citi mart and also very cheap. 
Since it's a roadside joint so there is no sitting arrangement. Service is very bad and slow. 
We ordered chicken momo, served hot but it was very smelly and didn't seem to be fresh. 
Because of this we couldn't even finish it.  
It's very hygienic, we decided not to visit again. So not recommended from my end.

A small joint in the lane of inifd,new market area. No seating arrangements. You can sit on stools on the lane. Among the two serving the food, one seemed a little dumb. I had to repeat everything twice for him before the other guy came to rescue. Coming to the food, they serve only a few items. We tried the chicken tikka masala sandwich. And loved it! It came with two dips and chips. The sandwich was filling enough, not if youre starving. Tasted good. The service is a tad bit slow for the sandwiches. Momos and other items were served quick. I wanna soon try out the momos and chicken lollipop. It looked like their most saleable item as 3/4 people ordered momo and chicken lollipop. Overall not a bad place minus the hygiene! Its right on the road afterall. Cheerie!
