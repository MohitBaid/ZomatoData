If you are in Commerce profession or a student of it or work at one of the 'n' number of offices nearby, you already know this place is a bliss for you. Being one of the good places to take your regular lunch, the options start from north Indian to south Indian to chinnese.

From breakfasts after tuitions to lunching or some eve snacks, this places is the option for it being low on pocket, and the fact that it wont make you sick. No sitting arrangements but ample space to eat.

Situated on same building's ground floor where my tuition center was. Always crowded but big open space so there's no suffocation because of it. Place for quick bites and quick tea sip for students and employees. Ambience was good and so as hospitality. Quick service and normal plating. There's no menu but everything is in front of your eyes so you can order easily. I tried there all famous snacks and sweets which were discussed below -
‚óè Singara - good in taste. Spicy and true Desi taste of masala. Served with red imli chatni.
‚óè Dhokla - Idli shaped khaman Dhokla topped with dry coconut, rai and neem leaf. Very taste and perfectly maked. Served with mint coconut chatni which was very delicious. Personal favorite. Recommended.
‚óè Kachori - puri size udat Kachori which was namkeen and very tasty with aloo sabji which was tastes like cooked in home. Loved it.
‚óè Uttapam - they made masala, onion, tomato and green chilly Uttapam which was heavenly delicious in taste. Perfectly cooked namkeen, spicy and very tasty. Served with sambhar with was tastes really good and coconut chatni which tastes delicious. Totally loved it. Highly recommended.
‚óè Cheese Rolls - delicious liquid Cheese with veggies rolled in semi hard paratha very juicy and tastes tremendous.
‚óè jalebi- big in size and delicious in taste. One of the best jalebis in town. Recommended.
‚óè Gulab Jamun - Perfectly made tastes very delicious. Hot and sweet. Loved it.

This place is located at Mango Lane & remains crowded be it in the morning, afternoon or evening. The crowd is basically of students (CA & CS students mainly) & office goers.

The food quality & quantity both are good & that too within a reasonable price. You can also pack your lunch from here from a variety of options. 

I like their Club Kachori, Dhokla and some of the sweets a lot. Whenever I visit Kaka Tea, its a must to have their Tea. I feel that the sweets are a little bit overpriced given a Dalhousie area like that. 

The only issue with this place is that they hav 3-4 long tables, but there is no sitting arrangements. You need to have your food while standing there. Nonetheless this is a must visit place in the Dalhousie Area.

So my office is in Chandni, so I am kind of a regular in Kaka Tea. Be it any time if the day, Kaka Tea is always crowded. 
My favorite is lunch time. Their Masala Kulcha, Mix Veg, Paneer and daal are the best. It is at very affordable prices as well. If anyone is in the area and wants a quick bite they should walk in. 
The drawbacks of the place of that its not air conditioned, has no seating and has an open kitchen. If they just raise the hygiene and comfort factor it will be great.

This time we ordered crispy chilli babycorn, fried rice, manchurian. This Chinese dishes made in indian flavour was just delicious. I would recommend this place for a quick bite whenever possible. For 2 person pocket pinch will only be 150rs isn't it cheap with a super quality food. Must go

Located near mango lane. It has a varieties of cuisines, such as north Indian, South Indian, deserts, beverages. Staffs are helpful and polite. It is an open space. No place to seat, stand and dine is the only option. Office goers and students come to hangout. Food is hygiene and delicious. We had ordered as in delivery. We ordered for masala kulcha, butter naan, tawa roti in breads. Mix vegetable(yummy), chana masala, Aloo gobi in vegetables. As well as fried rice with papad and salad. We also ordered for gulab jamun in sweets, delicious. Food was good. Pocket pinch is low.

Almost every office-goer and student in the Chandni area can swear by this place. Kaka Tea is like the perfect lunch destination. Masala kulcha is really good with Mix Vegetable or Normal Gravy Paneer. While all subzis are really good, one thing that really stands out is the curry. One must try it is. Noodles, fried rice and Manchurian are good too. Crispy Chilli Babycorn is average. Coming to snacks, gulaab jamun and samosas are delicious. And of course, a visit to this place is incomplete without its mesmerizing chai.

Description : I have been going to this place for more than 15 years. It has changed a lot in this time. It is very famous among office goers. It is located on the ground floor of 5, Mangoe Lane. It offers varieties of foods which includes north indian main course, south indian, chinese, snacks. sweets. tea, lassi etc.

I tried its north course meal on that day. I ordered aloo gobi, chana masala, kali dal, chappati & veg polao. Its quality of food is top notch. No doubt its always crowded during lunch hours. I feel the pricing is over priced given the area. But we are ready to pay for its quality.

Overall, must try place.

Situated in mangoe lane, this place is a like a 'basa' or say dhaba. Stand and eat style to dine, and with variety of food being served during the lunch hours like baby corn, machurain, paneer sabji, mix veg etc. Kind of buffet as you can eat all you want with no limits. Just eat whatever you wish, and pay for what you ate. They even offer idly, Chinese samosa, hot gulab jamun and tea which acts as all day attraction. In the morning they serve kachodi sabji etc for breakfast. It's very popular in town with generally the crowd of students and office personnel glooming the place mostly. One of the best spot to eat near the Lal bazar area as the food they offer are hygenic and also good to taste.

This is the kind of restaurant that offers you great food at an eye popping price. The proportions and quality of food deserve a huge thumbs up. The lunch menu consists of ¬†a huge range of delicacies from Chilly babycorn to mixed vegetable to Kadhi Pakora. One can order the Indian Pulao to the semi-chinese Fried rice. The prices are super economical and the cleanliness is commendable. Even the staunchest of Non-Vegetarian people will enjoy the vegetarian spread. The tea is always piping hot and the lassi's are chilled. Look out for the Dahi Vada, which is delicious (the dahi is never over fermented as one comes across in many places).

Nice little place near my office for having breakfast/lunch/snacks. 
Food offered varied from naan to kulcha to chowmine to dhokla to what not. 
Well located in Mango Lane near B B D Bagh bus stand, this place serves excellent foor at reasonable rates with satisfactory hygiene. 
The only problem being, the nonavailability of seating arrangements or AC. But then the seating capacity would decrease and food prices go higher. 
Service is fast and good. 
Would definitely get my recommendation.

For we office goers.. This place is nothing less than a treat not only to our mouths, but to our pockets too.. Next to Mangoe Lane, this place offers the best lunch during office recess.. Note: Self serving on coupon basis is the procedure here.. From tea to main courses to sweets to drinks.. A proper lunch for office maddies.. Lol

It used to be an old dilapidated building beside 4 mangoe lane when i first visited there in mid 90s. Very soon it became a favourite joint for chai, samosa, dossa and dhokla... A quick and cheap bite during market visits. The snacks were crisp and fresh and the tea was great. After many years, srepped in the place a couple of weeks back and was pleasantly surprised to see the new building and the wide variety of snacks and sweets and some very decent meals added. Still remains an extremely pocket friendly and tasty joint today.

A small little outlet at the end of Mission Row( RN Mukerjee road) on Mangoe lane¬† serves you some grrrrreat Singaras ( Samosas) which go down well with some piping hot Assam Chai . If youre too early in office or working late and feeling 'grubby' you have some soft idlis and crispy vadas also available which are tasty and nice. The Chinese fare is typical Cal street stuff--filling but not where you go for your first date.Basically catering to the office crowd its clientel ranges from the "Burra sahibs" of¬† Firms in the area to the drivers,young execs and watchmen. its been around for donkeys years and remains ever popular in the BBD Bag area.

Kaka Tea at Mangoe Lane beside Missions Row Extension stands firm since eons ago !

It has borne footsteps of countless office goers , students and labourers alike. It is unusual to find a tea store which has grown so big !

Staple food at very low price is their USP. But , the quality is still something to talk about ‚Äì be it Dosa , Samosa , Gulab Jamun or Chowmein(40 rupees ! !) ‚Äì the food never disappoints.

They also serve veg thali ‚Äì both indian and Chinese. You have to buy plastic coins and then stand in the queue for the thali.

My favourite has always been the Cheese Sandwich and the freshly cooked Utthappam.

One of the best afternoon snack joint near Dalhousie  !

Kaka tea is To go place for office going public around Dalhousie for their lunch, snacks, tea and for any stomach related requirement. It beats all the street food available around due to good maintenance of hygiene. The place mostly have veg buffet but also provides with snacks like dhokla, samosa, sandwich n many more. The however doesn't have sitting. Tall tables are there to keep your plates but you will have to stand and eat. Best place for a quick lunch on a busy working day.

I absolutely love this Place.. It has been a savior during my b tuition days. Whether it be early morning samosas or late evening cutlets. Its always packed with people.. The quality of the food served is really nice.. And has perfect taste of street food . I never eat samosa outside. But this place has my heart for it . the tea is damn good.. Well I have had almost everything here.. U can go here for breakfast, lunch and evening snacks as well.. For lunch u get both Indian as well as Chinese. And trust me after a boring lecture or a workload at office the food really is worth cherishing.. In fact with friends its a fun place.. To have tea a long with enjoying a good rain.. So if u r there don't miss it.. Also u can have food without worrying about your pockets.. Must try..:)

Kaka Tea at Mangoe Lane was once only a garage outlet. People used to eat in the open surrounded by pigeons and old cars. The old Kaka Tea soon become famous among nearby office goers and students. The outlet then moved to a new and the current location, but you still have to stand and eat. The food at Kaka Tea has always been phenomenal. As the name suggests the outlet is less famous for it's Tea but more famous for it's food.

The best thing about Kaka Tea is the value for money the outlet offers. After this outlet, there was been a surge in these kind of roadside eateries all over Kolkata. But the original has always been the best! For all those who have eaten at the famous 5 star hotels would know that the taste of the food would still be at par at Kaka Tea. 

The outlet is very crowded during lunch hours and it may take a few minutes to even get started. Everyone has a lot of choice when it comes to food. The outlet has pre-made curries and the breads are made fresh. The taste of the curries is incredible. Due to small portions you get a choice to try more than 1 curry. For breads you need to wait in the queue. The Kulcha is my favorite. It is soft and topped with a generous spread of butter! 

The crowd never seem to diminish even during the hot summer months. People just line up for the food. If you haven't tasted Kaka Tea's food you haven't tasted anything.

The Verdict:-
Food/Taste - 9/10
Service - 6/10
Value for Money - 9/10
Ambiance - 5/10
Quantity - 8/10
Quality - 8/10

Kaka Tea is a legend in Kolkata and may the good food never ends!

One of the most popular vegetarian restaurants of this area.
Located amidst a heavily crowded lane buzzing with office goers and daily wage earners,this restaurant serves the most delicious and healthy food.
The best time to be here is for lunch so that you may enjoy the assortment of the various dishes displayed.
I have been here only once with my office colleagues and will definitely keep coming back here time and again.
This restaurant offers a lot of choices specially the customized lunch buffet where you can choose your own combinations freely.
You may have the mini kachoris and aloo gravy for a small bite.If you are planning for a lunch definitely go for the Chinese fried rice with the vegetarian Manchurian, or you may opt for the Veg Chowmein instead.
For North Indian vegetarian dishes you may have tandoori roti with paneer curry or the mixed vegetable curry.The chole curry is also very tasty over here.
Before leaving this place you should go for a sweet dish and the gulab jamun is a hot pick of this place.
Visiting this place other than lunch is also great as they serve dhoklas with the coriander leave chutney which is awesome in taste.
Have never really tasted all the sweets but I presume the jalebis will be equally good in taste.
Definitely have high hopes for this place and I sincerely hope that they will keep up with the good quality of food served here...

Kaka tea is very popular and rightly so. It's good homely food and it's cheap. I am generally not keen on eating standing up but I didn't mind as the food was very nice. They have 4-5 curries each day which they rotate and I specially liked their gatta. Wish I could have this kind at home :)
I am tempted by their samosa and snacks but there is generally no scope for them after lunch.

How should I review a place which has shares so many childhood memories. Since my earlier house was pretty close to this joint I have tried and ordered almost everything from their menu. I recently visited this joint and found it crowded as usual. There were sounds of orders echoing from all corners possible. Still they did not compromise on the food quality as well as the time taken to serve us our order which was :

Dahi Vada : Nice on flavour and tasty
Singhara : Full of spices and really heavy
Dal Makhanai : Again a great item
Mix Veg : Well prepared
Tandoori Roti : Soft and Nice

They have maintained their standard since years now and I was not at all disappointed. Price wise its cheap. A must visit place.

just beside my office, four mangoe lane...the place is very nice, just too good. the prices are very cheap. i just love their dahi-vada in this hot summers. it just chills the stomach at once. they have a huge collection of vegetarian food, beginning from south indian dishes like dosa, idli, sambar-vada, uttapam etc etc to paw-bhaji, vada-paw, various sweets. i don't a sweet tooth, so i little know about the sweets. the place serves awesome lassi and tea. they have also those puri, chowmein, fried rice and many kore preparations. its impossible to find a place to stand during the lunch hours. the place doesn't have any seating arrangement. the pricing is very cheap. and yes their food tends to get finished after the lunch hours because of the heavy sale. if you go by 3.30-4pm you can't find your favourite dish out there, but yes you can find their fresh cooked food always there.

An rag to riches story, kaka tea is also an oasis for the veggie in the city among the numerous non veg joints that dalhousie is famous for. The quality of the food is evidenced by the crowd that it attracts during lunch time inspite of having no a.c and sitting facility.You suddenly feel that you are in Jaipur or Delhi. The only reason that I give it a lower rating is because of the prices , Rs 10 for a kulhad of tea is unheard in Kolkata

Kaka Tea is one of the best place in Calcutta to have tasty food without pinching too much on the pocket. It's a very old joint at Dalhousie in the heart of Calcutta. I have been going to this place since my college days and every time food tastes awesome. Even now whenever I visit the Dalhousie area, I make it a point to have my lunch at Kaka Tea. As far as their menu is concerned, all the items are superb, some like Tea, Masala Kulcha, Punjabi Vegetables deserves special mention.

‚ÄúTasty Homely Food‚Äù

Calcuttans are known to be tremendous food lovers. You can never take Calcutta out of the heart of a Calcuttan. The food of Calcutta has a plethora of cuisines to offer and anyone who visits Calcutta is sure to fall in love with the food here. 

One such culinary destination offering a great variety of food that is second to none with immense hospitality and flavor is KAKA TEA! Located at Mangoe Lane, Dalhousie BBD Bagh, it is a place which is very easy to locate. Located in a place which has some great food joints in every lane and by-lane, this food hub is listed on the top of every office-goers and student‚Äôs list. This place has no ambience at all and you have to stand and eat ‚Äì and it is still really popular! The ambience of this place is created by the little gossip and laughter of office goers and students who take a little break from their boring schedule to relax here.

They operate for breakfast, lunch and snacks and the place is always full (yes! FULL), with dozens of people coming in to eat their lip smacking food. A cup of chai is a must have at KAKA TEA and there are always a number of people waiting for their famous chai. The samosas and kachoris they serve piping hot are amazing as are their hot gulab jamuns, which melt in your mouth in a blink of an eye. Their menu for breakfast and lunch keeps changing every day so you may get different food on every visit.

An awesome food joint to visit if you are in this extremely busy office area in Calcutta.

This is an ideal place for all veggie lovers. Though I am a sought of person who would always ask for non-veg cuisines all time but trust me this place would delight you even though they serve only veg food. A place where you would normally find office goers, CA & CS aspirants. This place remains dead packed throughout the day. They serve quality food at good prices though I won't say the prices are really cheap. The South Indian cuisine along with the rotis are my personal favorites. Samosas and cutlets are also great. The desserts specially the jamun tops my list. This place lacks any seating arrangement which is a major disadvantage.

This place earns its extra points due to the basic fact that Kaka Tea is a spot where one would get to see the typical kolkata man,stopping for a quick lunch or snack long with the compulsory chai . You would hear the the adda across the chai ka kulhad and feel the pace in the place.
Almost every businessman or employee in this busy area of dalhousie has been to this tea and snacks joint. It also serves buffet lunch everyday with the vegetables changing on a daily basis with a constant paneer and a rotating gravy with it. The usual snacks which are the idli,vada,dhokla,faafda,aaloo poodi,samosa and sweets are veryyy tasty.
The famous SSEI is in the same building and so the place is flocked by CA and CFA students on a regular basis.
Its a jewel in the area of dalhousie !

Having read some great reviews (especially by Priti Jain) about these people and for the first time, agreeing with almost everything being said , i wonder what i could add but the place is great enough to inspire me to make my attempt !!!

Kaka tea has grown leaps and bounces over the past few years. Located in dalhousie area which has some great fooding options in every lane and bye lane, yet these people have excelled to such a level that i dont know of any office in a 3 km radius that do not get their takeaways from here. I would not say whatever they offer is the best. Many items they offer have better competitors nearby but from the overall menu point of view there is no single place in Kolkata 700001 that has such extensive menu and serves hot and fresh food through such long hours with so much of cleanliness and hygiene. Having its own eating area in the ground floor, even though one has to stand and eat, is a big forte since most other places here lack this aspect.

Located in 5 mangoe lane, its owns a pretty big space where one could stand and eat. Staff are polite but always in a hurry, justifiable so. The food is pretty well packed for takeaways. The prices are higher compared to others in this part but quality, freshness, hygiene, variety pretty much justifies it. They also have their counter opposite calcutta stock exchange that presents a  small lunch buffet.

Coming to food, tea is an all time all day favorite which is very nice and is always being prepared fresh like almost all other tea makers in this part but tea here beats the others in consistency. Samosas, cutlets sell like frenzy and are pretty good. South indian food is nice. Their lunch consists of north indian, chinese menu. I am not so fond of their chinese and prefer their indian roti and sabzis. They have different dishes each day on offer and my favorite are the dal, bharwa bhindi, mix veg and their veg pulao. Whatever one might try, it would be good. The only factor is if you have gone for their best offering. 

Several great fooding options are available in the vicinity, but this place could be your best option when you aren't pre-decided about what you gonna have!!!

Located in Mangoe Lane,Dalhouise,the major office area of Kolkata,Kaka tea is very well known and popular among all the office goers.I was not much aware of the place myself.But I was attending a 3 day long session nearby and while looking for options for my meals,I came across this place.Instantly it became a hit among me and my friends.It became The place for lunch,snacks and tea for us and we had a great time.

Kaka tea operates from the morning till about early evening providing breakfast,lunch and snacks.The first time when we visited during lunch hours,we were taken aback by the variety of items on offer.Later we found out that the menu changes every day and the options remain equally diverse.During lunch you would get to choose from a rice item,a roti,a paratha or a different type of roti,like they had "missy roti" one day,chowmein and side dishes range from aloo dum,mixed veg,paneer item,baby corn,veg manchurian etc.

During breakfast or snacks they offer kachoris,samosas,dhoklas,kathis,veg or aloo chops etc.All the items we had were really tasty.The food was as close to home made food as one would find anywhere outside and yet very very tasty.Among the items I really liked were missy roti,aloo paratha,palak paneer,crispy babycorn,mixed veg,kachoris,vada and dhokla.

Apart from these,you will always get supply of good tea and a number of sweets.The tea is excellent and very rejuvenating.We mainly had tea with elaichi.Among the sweets,the gulab jamun is very good.Other sweets on offer are also pretty good.We even had their lassi.It was also quite thick and filling.

Coming to the negative aspects of the place,it has a self service system and there is no seating arrangement at all.There are number of tables arranged where one can keep the plates and have their food.Also,it is a vegeterain place only.Lastly the prices are on the higher side.For a place which does not even have seating facility the prices are quite high.But the quality of the food makes up for it quite a bit.

Another aspect about the place that I found quite appreciable is that though the place is more like a canteen but they maintain good cleanliness and hygiene.This,along with the quality of the food even more makes you feel like you are having a meal at home.
Overall kaka tea does a commendable job providing tasty homely food to hundreds of office goers and students regularly.This is a place which is surely worth recommending.

For you can take a Calcuttan out of Calcutta , but not Calcutta out of a Calcuttan..!! The food here has no comparison.
 The warmth, hospitality and the flavour- there is no second Culinary destination offering such a great variety and Im proud to have experienced many of them- KAKA tea being one ..!

This place should definitely have more than two top reviews and Im adding one to list..! 
Although this place tops the list of having no Ambience at all- but yet , how popular it is..!! Because - the Ambience is made by the little gosspis and talks people do over the cup of chai, the eager faces who are in a hurry to finish thier sumptuous food to rush back to office, the CA students who crib and complain of their tiring and boring schedule along with those bite of Samosas & Kachoris and those domestic and office helps who come with a huge sized Flask to fill tea and serve them to a dozen of people waiting for the same..!
 Yes- this is typically Kaka Tea..! 

They operate for Breakfast, Lunch and Snacks and are a fixed eating joint for thousands of people working in and around Dalhouise and Chandni Chowk..! 
Breakfast- the Sambhar Wadas, dipped as well as stand alone is something you can look forward for ..! Im sometimes amazed how the Vada can simply become so so delicious when dipped in Sambhar for an hour or so..! Its delectable . They also serve Kachori Sabzi and its good enough..! 
Lunch- A complete buffet spread..! They cook those stuffed Kulchas and Tandoori Rotis in the Kitchen behind and serve it piping hot. Sabzis keep changing on a day to day basis but the Love in the food is constant. Paneer is always on the option , however the variety and taste may differ- sometimes its Palak, sometimes Shahi, sometimes Kadhai..! Dal Tadka is again an amazing try..!
Snacks- Samosa , Chai , Kachori , Paneer Cutlet and some conversations..!!

Im strongly of the opinion that its so difficult to operate these humble eating joints..! You have people coming to you almost daily and they live on your food. Yes- its equivalent to Ghar ka Khaana to them and Ghar ka Khaana can only be one when its cooked with oodles of Love- because thats the most important ingrediant for a culinary delight..!

Kaka Tea doesnt have the most amazing Chai and Sweets in Kolkata though but then its no less either..! 

Its located so strategically! I mean- flanked by offices all around and most importantly its on the same building which has the famous SSEI , one of the most popular destination for CA and CFA students in Kolkata. Hence you'll always find a huge rush at 11 am and 6pm...and its then when the samosas and Kachoris dissapears with the blink of an eye..!

Kaka Tea- I could go on an on writing about you, but then good things should come to an end..!
Thank You- for having served good food all the time , and for never compromising on your quality standards..!!

PS- if a favourite was to be mentioned- I love the Paneer Chop with Green Chutney and a cup of Adrak waaali Chai- its heaven..!!

This place earns its extra points due to the basic fact that Kaka Tea is a spot where one would get to see the typical kolkata man,stopping for a quick lunch or snack long with the compulsory chai . You would hear the the adda across the chai ka kulhad and feel the pace in the place.
Almost every businessman or employee in this busy area of dalhousie has been to this tea and snacks joint. It also serves buffet lunch everyday with the vegetables changing on a daily basis with a constant paneer and a rotating gravy with it. The usual snacks which are the idli,vada,dhokla,faafda,aaloo poodi,samosa and sweets are veryyy tasty.
The famous SSEI is in the same building and so the place is flocked by CA and CFA students on a regular basis.
Its a jewel in the area of dalhousie !

Having read some great reviews (especially by Priti Jain) about these people and for the first time, agreeing with almost everything being said , i wonder what i could add but the place is great enough to inspire me to make my attempt !!!

Kaka tea has grown leaps and bounces over the past few years. Located in dalhousie area which has some great fooding options in every lane and bye lane, yet these people have excelled to such a level that i dont know of any office in a 3 km radius that do not get their takeaways from here. I would not say whatever they offer is the best. Many items they offer have better competitors nearby but from the overall menu point of view there is no single place in Kolkata 700001 that has such extensive menu and serves hot and fresh food through such long hours with so much of cleanliness and hygiene. Having its own eating area in the ground floor, even though one has to stand and eat, is a big forte since most other places here lack this aspect.

Located in 5 mangoe lane, its owns a pretty big space where one could stand and eat. Staff are polite but always in a hurry, justifiable so. The food is pretty well packed for takeaways. The prices are higher compared to others in this part but quality, freshness, hygiene, variety pretty much justifies it. They also have their counter opposite calcutta stock exchange that presents a  small lunch buffet.

Coming to food, tea is an all time all day favorite which is very nice and is always being prepared fresh like almost all other tea makers in this part but tea here beats the others in consistency. Samosas, cutlets sell like frenzy and are pretty good. South indian food is nice. Their lunch consists of north indian, chinese menu. I am not so fond of their chinese and prefer their indian roti and sabzis. They have different dishes each day on offer and my favorite are the dal, bharwa bhindi, mix veg and their veg pulao. Whatever one might try, it would be good. The only factor is if you have gone for their best offering. 

Several great fooding options are available in the vicinity, but this place could be your best option when you aren't pre-decided about what you gonna have!!!

Located in Mangoe Lane,Dalhouise,the major office area of Kolkata,Kaka tea is very well known and popular among all the office goers.I was not much aware of the place myself.But I was attending a 3 day long session nearby and while looking for options for my meals,I came across this place.Instantly it became a hit among me and my friends.It became The place for lunch,snacks and tea for us and we had a great time.

Kaka tea operates from the morning till about early evening providing breakfast,lunch and snacks.The first time when we visited during lunch hours,we were taken aback by the variety of items on offer.Later we found out that the menu changes every day and the options remain equally diverse.During lunch you would get to choose from a rice item,a roti,a paratha or a different type of roti,like they had "missy roti" one day,chowmein and side dishes range from aloo dum,mixed veg,paneer item,baby corn,veg manchurian etc.

During breakfast or snacks they offer kachoris,samosas,dhoklas,kathis,veg or aloo chops etc.All the items we had were really tasty.The food was as close to home made food as one would find anywhere outside and yet very very tasty.Among the items I really liked were missy roti,aloo paratha,palak paneer,crispy babycorn,mixed veg,kachoris,vada and dhokla.

Apart from these,you will always get supply of good tea and a number of sweets.The tea is excellent and very rejuvenating.We mainly had tea with elaichi.Among the sweets,the gulab jamun is very good.Other sweets on offer are also pretty good.We even had their lassi.It was also quite thick and filling.

Coming to the negative aspects of the place,it has a self service system and there is no seating arrangement at all.There are number of tables arranged where one can keep the plates and have their food.Also,it is a vegeterain place only.Lastly the prices are on the higher side.For a place which does not even have seating facility the prices are quite high.But the quality of the food makes up for it quite a bit.

Another aspect about the place that I found quite appreciable is that though the place is more like a canteen but they maintain good cleanliness and hygiene.This,along with the quality of the food even more makes you feel like you are having a meal at home.
Overall kaka tea does a commendable job providing tasty homely food to hundreds of office goers and students regularly.This is a place which is surely worth recommending.

For you can take a Calcuttan out of Calcutta , but not Calcutta out of a Calcuttan..!! The food here has no comparison.
 The warmth, hospitality and the flavour- there is no second Culinary destination offering such a great variety and Im proud to have experienced many of them- KAKA tea being one ..!

This place should definitely have more than two top reviews and Im adding one to list..! 
Although this place tops the list of having no Ambience at all- but yet , how popular it is..!! Because - the Ambience is made by the little gosspis and talks people do over the cup of chai, the eager faces who are in a hurry to finish thier sumptuous food to rush back to office, the CA students who crib and complain of their tiring and boring schedule along with those bite of Samosas & Kachoris and those domestic and office helps who come with a huge sized Flask to fill tea and serve them to a dozen of people waiting for the same..!
 Yes- this is typically Kaka Tea..! 

They operate for Breakfast, Lunch and Snacks and are a fixed eating joint for thousands of people working in and around Dalhouise and Chandni Chowk..! 
Breakfast- the Sambhar Wadas, dipped as well as stand alone is something you can look forward for ..! Im sometimes amazed how the Vada can simply become so so delicious when dipped in Sambhar for an hour or so..! Its delectable . They also serve Kachori Sabzi and its good enough..! 
Lunch- A complete buffet spread..! They cook those stuffed Kulchas and Tandoori Rotis in the Kitchen behind and serve it piping hot. Sabzis keep changing on a day to day basis but the Love in the food is constant. Paneer is always on the option , however the variety and taste may differ- sometimes its Palak, sometimes Shahi, sometimes Kadhai..! Dal Tadka is again an amazing try..!
Snacks- Samosa , Chai , Kachori , Paneer Cutlet and some conversations..!!

Im strongly of the opinion that its so difficult to operate these humble eating joints..! You have people coming to you almost daily and they live on your food. Yes- its equivalent to Ghar ka Khaana to them and Ghar ka Khaana can only be one when its cooked with oodles of Love- because thats the most important ingrediant for a culinary delight..!

I was introduced to Kaka Tea years back by a friend who has their office in Mangoe Lane. It started with the Chai and Samosas both of which are really good and fresh. I would actually prefer to go visit my friend at office so I could sample the chai and samosa ;-) . I also tried out the Masala Dosa which was surprisingly tasty and the gulab jamuns which were really good and huge to boot. They also serve a hugely popular vegetarian lunch and I  must confess that the Paneer Subzi and Roti was quite good as well. This place is hugely crowded and serves vegetarian food only but is cost - effective and has a huge following in the area.

An excellent eatery for the veg-lovers. This place is generally buzzing with office-goers and students alike for just one simple reason - good food at cheap price.

The food served is quite good and is not heavily spiced. They don't have a specific menu. But whatever is on the menu for the day is good enough to keep your taste buds wanting more.

A must have - hot gulabjamuns.  

A must try for any foodie.

It's the place to go to if you're in Dalhousie! Friendly on the pockets of students, Kaka Tea offers a wide variety of pure veg dishes. Considering the volume it serves to, seating arrangements would require a lot of changes in the setting.

Its a gem for the pure veg office people in and around Dalhousie area of Kolkata ....

Just go there around lunch time between 1 to 3 you would see even high profile people standing in queue for the food...

Such is the craze for Kaka's samosaa, gulab jamun & chai that the moment the tray full of samosaa comes in it just flies off.

PROs :: Food is quite good in taste and fresh. Gulab jamun is served steaming hot ..

Cons :: No menu for food you will have to order from the items that they prepare (they prepare diff items on diff day) ..... huge crowd fighting for space ...... food gets sold off by 3pm to max 4pm....

If you are in Commerce profession or a student of it or work at one of the 'n' number of offices nearby, you already know this place is a bliss for you. Being one of the good places to take your regular lunch, the options start from north Indian to south Indian to chinnese.

From breakfasts after tuitions to lunching or some eve snacks, this places is the option for it being low on pocket, and the fact that it wont make you sick. No sitting arrangements but ample space to eat.

Situated on same building's ground floor where my tuition center was. Always crowded but big open space so there's no suffocation because of it. Place for quick bites and quick tea sip for students and employees. Ambience was good and so as hospitality. Quick service and normal plating. There's no menu but everything is in front of your eyes so you can order easily. I tried there all famous snacks and sweets which were discussed below -
‚óè Singara - good in taste. Spicy and true Desi taste of masala. Served with red imli chatni.
‚óè Dhokla - Idli shaped khaman Dhokla topped with dry coconut, rai and neem leaf. Very taste and perfectly maked. Served with mint coconut chatni which was very delicious. Personal favorite. Recommended.
‚óè Kachori - puri size udat Kachori which was namkeen and very tasty with aloo sabji which was tastes like cooked in home. Loved it.
‚óè Uttapam - they made masala, onion, tomato and green chilly Uttapam which was heavenly delicious in taste. Perfectly cooked namkeen, spicy and very tasty. Served with sambhar with was tastes really good and coconut chatni which tastes delicious. Totally loved it. Highly recommended.
‚óè Cheese Rolls - delicious liquid Cheese with veggies rolled in semi hard paratha very juicy and tastes tremendous.
‚óè jalebi- big in size and delicious in taste. One of the best jalebis in town. Recommended.
‚óè Gulab Jamun - Perfectly made tastes very delicious. Hot and sweet. Loved it.
Reasonable price. Must try place. Personal favorite. Highly recommended to all.

This place is located at Mango Lane & remains crowded be it in the morning, afternoon or evening. The crowd is basically of students (CA & CS students mainly) & office goers.

The food quality & quantity both are good & that too within a reasonable price. You can also pack your lunch from here from a variety of options. 

I like their Club Kachori, Dhokla and some of the sweets a lot. Whenever I visit Kaka Tea, its a must to have their Tea. I feel that the sweets are a little bit overpriced given a Dalhousie area like that. 

The only issue with this place is that they hav 3-4 long tables, but there is no sitting arrangements. You need to have your food while standing there. Nonetheless this is a must visit place in the Dalhousie Area.

So my office is in Chandni, so I am kind of a regular in Kaka Tea. Be it any time if the day, Kaka Tea is always crowded. 
My favorite is lunch time. Their Masala Kulcha, Mix Veg, Paneer and daal are the best. It is at very affordable prices as well. If anyone is in the area and wants a quick bite they should walk in. 
The drawbacks of the place of that its not air conditioned, has no seating and has an open kitchen. If they just raise the hygiene and comfort factor it will be great.

We ordered for masala kulcha, butter naan, tawa roti in breads. Mix vegetable(yummy), chana masala, Aloo gobi in vegetables. As well as fried rice with papad and salad. We also ordered for gulab jamun in sweets, delicious. Food was good. Pocket pinch is low.

Masala kulcha is really good with Mix Vegetable or Normal Gravy Paneer. While all subzis are really good, one thing that really stands out is the curry. One must try it is. Noodles, fried rice and Manchurian are good too. Crispy Chilli Babycorn is average. Coming to snacks, gulaab jamun and samosas are delicious. And of course, a visit to this place is incomplete without its mesmerizing chai.

Description : I have been going to this place for more than 15 years. It has changed a lot in this time. It is very famous among office goers. It is located on the ground floor of 5, Mangoe Lane. It offers varieties of foods which includes north indian main course, south indian, chinese, snacks. sweets. tea, lassi etc.

I tried its north course meal on that day. I ordered aloo gobi, chana masala, kali dal, chappati & veg polao. Its quality of food is top notch. No doubt its always crowded during lunch hours. I feel the pricing is over priced given the area. But we are ready to pay for its quality.

Overall, must try place.

Tried peas kachoris, gulab jamun and tea. Peas kachoris have been quite satisfying. However, the gulab jamun is one of the best in the city. The tea is not upto the mark.

Overall, a good place for a quick bite

Located near mango lane. It has a varieties of cuisines, such as north Indian, South Indian, deserts, beverages. Staffs are helpful and polite. It is an open space. No place to seat, stand and dine is the only option. Office goers and students come to hangout. Food is hygiene and delicious. We had ordered as in delivery. We ordered for masala kulcha, butter naan, tawa roti in breads. Mix vegetable(yummy), chana masala, Aloo gobi in vegetables. As well as fried rice with papad and salad. We also ordered for gulab jamun in sweets, delicious. Food was good. Pocket pinch is low.

Situated in mangoe lane, this place is a like a 'basa' or say dhaba. Stand and eat style to dine, and with variety of food being served during the lunch hours like baby corn, machurain, paneer sabji, mix veg etc. Kind of buffet as you can eat all you want with no limits. Just eat whatever you wish, and pay for what you ate. They even offer idly, Chinese samosa, hot gulab jamun and tea which acts as all day attraction. In the morning they serve kachodi sabji etc for breakfast. It's very popular in town with generally the crowd of students and office personnel glooming the place mostly. One of the best spot to eat near the Lal bazar area as the food they offer are hygenic and also good to taste.

This is the kind of restaurant that offers you great food at an eye popping price. The proportions and quality of food deserve a huge thumbs up. The lunch menu consists of ¬†a huge range of delicacies from Chilly babycorn to mixed vegetable to Kadhi Pakora. One can order the Indian Pulao to the semi-chinese Fried rice. The prices are super economical and the cleanliness is commendable. Even the staunchest of Non-Vegetarian people will enjoy the vegetarian spread. The tea is always piping hot and the lassi's are chilled. Look out for the Dahi Vada, which is delicious (the dahi is never over fermented as one comes across in many places).

Nice little place near my office for having breakfast/lunch/snacks. 
Food offered varied from naan to kulcha to chowmine to dhokla to what not. 
Well located in Mango Lane near B B D Bagh bus stand, this place serves excellent foor at reasonable rates with satisfactory hygiene. 
The only problem being, the nonavailability of seating arrangements or AC. But then the seating capacity would decrease and food prices go higher. 
Service is fast and good. 
Would definitely get my recommendation.

It used to be an old dilapidated building beside 4 mangoe lane when i first visited there in mid 90s. Very soon it became a favourite joint for chai, samosa, dossa and dhokla... A quick and cheap bite during market visits. The snacks were crisp and fresh and the tea was great. After many years, srepped in the place a couple of weeks back and was pleasantly surprised to see the new building and the wide variety of snacks and sweets and some very decent meals added. Still remains an extremely pocket friendly and tasty joint today.

A small little outlet at the end of Mission Row( RN Mukerjee road) on Mangoe lane¬† serves you some grrrrreat Singaras ( Samosas) which go down well with some piping hot Assam Chai . If youre too early in office or working late and feeling 'grubby' you have some soft idlis and crispy vadas also available which are tasty and nice. The Chinese fare is typical Cal street stuff--filling but not where you go for your first date.Basically catering to the office crowd its clientel ranges from the "Burra sahibs" of¬† Firms in the area to the drivers,young execs and watchmen. its been around for donkeys years and remains ever popular in the BBD Bag area.

Kaka Tea at Mangoe Lane beside Missions Row Extension stands firm since eons ago !

It has borne footsteps of countless office goers , students and labourers alike. It is unusual to find a tea store which has grown so big !

Staple food at very low price is their USP. But , the quality is still something to talk about ‚Äì be it Dosa , Samosa , Gulab Jamun or Chowmein(40 rupees ! !) ‚Äì the food never disappoints.

They also serve veg thali ‚Äì both indian and Chinese. You have to buy plastic coins and then stand in the queue for the thali.

My favourite has always been the Cheese Sandwich and the freshly cooked Utthappam.

One of the best afternoon snack joint near Dalhousie  !

Kaka tea is To go place for office going public around Dalhousie for their lunch, snacks, tea and for any stomach related requirement. It beats all the street food available around due to good maintenance of hygiene. The place mostly have veg buffet but also provides with snacks like dhokla, samosa, sandwich n many more. The however doesn't have sitting. Tall tables are there to keep your plates but you will have to stand and eat. Best place for a quick lunch on a busy working day.

I absolutely love this Place.. It has been a savior during my b tuition days. Whether it be early morning samosas or late evening cutlets. Its always packed with people.. The quality of the food served is really nice.. And has perfect taste of street food . I never eat samosa outside. But this place has my heart for it . the tea is damn good.. Well I have had almost everything here.. U can go here for breakfast, lunch and evening snacks as well.. For lunch u get both Indian as well as Chinese. And trust me after a boring lecture or a workload at office the food really is worth cherishing.. In fact with friends its a fun place.. To have tea a long with enjoying a good rain.. So if u r there don't miss it.. Also u can have food without worrying about your pockets.. Must try..:)

Kaka Tea at Mangoe Lane was once only a garage outlet. People used to eat in the open surrounded by pigeons and old cars. The old Kaka Tea soon become famous among nearby office goers and students. The outlet then moved to a new and the current location, but you still have to stand and eat. The food at Kaka Tea has always been phenomenal. As the name suggests the outlet is less famous for it's Tea but more famous for it's food.

The best thing about Kaka Tea is the value for money the outlet offers. After this outlet, there was been a surge in these kind of roadside eateries all over Kolkata. But the original has always been the best! For all those who have eaten at the famous 5 star hotels would know that the taste of the food would still be at par at Kaka Tea. 

The outlet is very crowded during lunch hours and it may take a few minutes to even get started. Everyone has a lot of choice when it comes to food. The outlet has pre-made curries and the breads are made fresh. The taste of the curries is incredible. Due to small portions you get a choice to try more than 1 curry. For breads you need to wait in the queue. The Kulcha is my favorite. It is soft and topped with a generous spread of butter! 

The crowd never seem to diminish even during the hot summer months. People just line up for the food. If you haven't tasted Kaka Tea's food you haven't tasted anything.

The Verdict:-
Food/Taste - 9/10
Service - 6/10
Value for Money - 9/10
Ambiance - 5/10
Quantity - 8/10
Quality - 8/10

Kaka Tea is a legend in Kolkata and may the good food never ends!

One of the most popular vegetarian restaurants of this area.
Located amidst a heavily crowded lane buzzing with office goers and daily wage earners,this restaurant serves the most delicious and healthy food.
The best time to be here is for lunch so that you may enjoy the assortment of the various dishes displayed.
I have been here only once with my office colleagues and will definitely keep coming back here time and again.
This restaurant offers a lot of choices specially the customized lunch buffet where you can choose your own combinations freely.
You may have the mini kachoris and aloo gravy for a small bite.If you are planning for a lunch definitely go for the Chinese fried rice with the vegetarian Manchurian, or you may opt for the Veg Chowmein instead.
For North Indian vegetarian dishes you may have tandoori roti with paneer curry or the mixed vegetable curry.The chole curry is also very tasty over here.
Before leaving this place you should go for a sweet dish and the gulab jamun is a hot pick of this place.
Visiting this place other than lunch is also great as they serve dhoklas with the coriander leave chutney which is awesome in taste.
Have never really tasted all the sweets but I presume the jalebis will be equally good in taste.
Definitely have high hopes for this place and I sincerely hope that they will keep up with the good quality of food served here...

Kaka tea is very popular and rightly so. It's good homely food and it's cheap. I am generally not keen on eating standing up but I didn't mind as the food was very nice. They have 4-5 curries each day which they rotate and I specially liked their gatta. Wish I could have this kind at home :)
I am tempted by their samosa and snacks but there is generally no scope for them after lunch.

How should I review a place which has shares so many childhood memories. Since my earlier house was pretty close to this joint I have tried and ordered almost everything from their menu. I recently visited this joint and found it crowded as usual. There were sounds of orders echoing from all corners possible. Still they did not compromise on the food quality as well as the time taken to serve us our order which was :

Dahi Vada : Nice on flavour and tasty
Singhara : Full of spices and really heavy
Dal Makhanai : Again a great item
Mix Veg : Well prepared
Tandoori Roti : Soft and Nice

They have maintained their standard since years now and I was not at all disappointed. Price wise its cheap. A must visit place.

An rag to riches story, kaka tea is also an oasis for the veggie in the city among the numerous non veg joints that dalhousie is famous for. The quality of the food is evidenced by the crowd that it attracts during lunch time inspite of having no a.c and sitting facility.You suddenly feel that you are in Jaipur or Delhi. The only reason that I give it a lower rating is because of the prices , Rs 10 for a kulhad of tea is unheard in Kolkata

Kaka Tea is one of the best place in Calcutta to have tasty food without pinching too much on the pocket. It's a very old joint at Dalhousie in the heart of Calcutta. I have been going to this place since my college days and every time food tastes awesome. Even now whenever I visit the Dalhousie area, I make it a point to have my lunch at Kaka Tea. As far as their menu is concerned, all the items are superb, some like Tea, Masala Kulcha, Punjabi Vegetables deserves special mention.

‚ÄúTasty Homely Food‚Äù

Calcuttans are known to be tremendous food lovers. You can never take Calcutta out of the heart of a Calcuttan. The food of Calcutta has a plethora of cuisines to offer and anyone who visits Calcutta is sure to fall in love with the food here. 

One such culinary destination offering a great variety of food that is second to none with immense hospitality and flavor is KAKA TEA! Located at Mangoe Lane, Dalhousie BBD Bagh, it is a place which is very easy to locate. Located in a place which has some great food joints in every lane and by-lane, this food hub is listed on the top of every office-goers and student‚Äôs list. This place has no ambience at all and you have to stand and eat ‚Äì and it is still really popular! The ambience of this place is created by the little gossip and laughter of office goers and students who take a little break from their boring schedule to relax here.

They operate for breakfast, lunch and snacks and the place is always full (yes! FULL), with dozens of people coming in to eat their lip smacking food. A cup of chai is a must have at KAKA TEA and there are always a number of people waiting for their famous chai. The samosas and kachoris they serve piping hot are amazing as are their hot gulab jamuns, which melt in your mouth in a blink of an eye. Their menu for breakfast and lunch keeps changing every day so you may get different food on every visit.

An awesome food joint to visit if you are in this extremely busy office area in Calcutta.

This is an ideal place for all veggie lovers. Though I am a sought of person who would always ask for non-veg cuisines all time but trust me this place would delight you even though they serve only veg food. A place where you would normally find office goers, CA & CS aspirants. This place remains dead packed throughout the day. They serve quality food at good prices though I won't say the prices are really cheap. The South Indian cuisine along with the rotis are my personal favorites. Samosas and cutlets are also great. The desserts specially the jamun tops my list. This place lacks any seating arrangement which is a major disadvantage.

An rag to riches story, kaka tea is also an oasis for the veggie in the city among the numerous non veg joints that dalhousie is famous for. The quality of the food is evidenced by the crowd that it attracts during lunch time inspite of having no a.c and sitting facility.You suddenly feel that you are in Jaipur or Delhi. The only reason that I give it a lower rating is because of the prices , Rs 10 for a kulhad of tea is unheard in Kolkata

Kaka Tea is one of the best place in Calcutta to have tasty food without pinching too much on the pocket. It's a very old joint at Dalhousie in the heart of Calcutta. I have been going to this place since my college days and every time food tastes awesome. Even now whenever I visit the Dalhousie area, I make it a point to have my lunch at Kaka Tea. As far as their menu is concerned, all the items are superb, some like Tea, Masala Kulcha, Punjabi Vegetables deserves special mention.

‚ÄúTasty Homely Food‚Äù

Calcuttans are known to be tremendous food lovers. You can never take Calcutta out of the heart of a Calcuttan. The food of Calcutta has a plethora of cuisines to offer and anyone who visits Calcutta is sure to fall in love with the food here. 

One such culinary destination offering a great variety of food that is second to none with immense hospitality and flavor is KAKA TEA! Located at Mangoe Lane, Dalhousie BBD Bagh, it is a place which is very easy to locate. Located in a place which has some great food joints in every lane and by-lane, this food hub is listed on the top of every office-goers and student‚Äôs list. This place has no ambience at all and you have to stand and eat ‚Äì and it is still really popular! The ambience of this place is created by the little gossip and laughter of office goers and students who take a little break from their boring schedule to relax here.

They operate for breakfast, lunch and snacks and the place is always full (yes! FULL), with dozens of people coming in to eat their lip smacking food. A cup of chai is a must have at KAKA TEA and there are always a number of people waiting for their famous chai. The samosas and kachoris they serve piping hot are amazing as are their hot gulab jamuns, which melt in your mouth in a blink of an eye. Their menu for breakfast and lunch keeps changing every day so you may get different food on every visit.

An awesome food joint to visit if you are in this extremely busy office area in Calcutta.

This is an ideal place for all veggie lovers. Though I am a sought of person who would always ask for non-veg cuisines all time but trust me this place would delight you even though they serve only veg food. A place where you would normally find office goers, CA & CS aspirants. This place remains dead packed throughout the day. They serve quality food at good prices though I won't say the prices are really cheap. The South Indian cuisine along with the rotis are my personal favorites. Samosas and cutlets are also great. The desserts specially the jamun tops my list. This place lacks any seating arrangement which is a major disadvantage.

This place earns its extra points due to the basic fact that Kaka Tea is a spot where one would get to see the typical kolkata man,stopping for a quick lunch or snack long with the compulsory chai . You would hear the the adda across the chai ka kulhad and feel the pace in the place.
Almost every businessman or employee in this busy area of dalhousie has been to this tea and snacks joint. It also serves buffet lunch everyday with the vegetables changing on a daily basis with a constant paneer and a rotating gravy with it. The usual snacks which are the idli,vada,dhokla,faafda,aaloo poodi,samosa and sweets are veryyy tasty.
The famous SSEI is in the same building and so the place is flocked by CA and CFA students on a regular basis.
Its a jewel in the area of dalhousie !

Having read some great reviews (especially by Priti Jain) about these people and for the first time, agreeing with almost everything being said , i wonder what i could add but the place is great enough to inspire me to make my attempt !!!

Kaka tea has grown leaps and bounces over the past few years. Located in dalhousie area which has some great fooding options in every lane and bye lane, yet these people have excelled to such a level that i dont know of any office in a 3 km radius that do not get their takeaways from here. I would not say whatever they offer is the best. Many items they offer have better competitors nearby but from the overall menu point of view there is no single place in Kolkata 700001 that has such extensive menu and serves hot and fresh food through such long hours with so much of cleanliness and hygiene. Having its own eating area in the ground floor, even though one has to stand and eat, is a big forte since most other places here lack this aspect.

Located in 5 mangoe lane, its owns a pretty big space where one could stand and eat. Staff are polite but always in a hurry, justifiable so. The food is pretty well packed for takeaways. The prices are higher compared to others in this part but quality, freshness, hygiene, variety pretty much justifies it. They also have their counter opposite calcutta stock exchange that presents a  small lunch buffet.

Coming to food, tea is an all time all day favorite which is very nice and is always being prepared fresh like almost all other tea makers in this part but tea here beats the others in consistency. Samosas, cutlets sell like frenzy and are pretty good. South indian food is nice. Their lunch consists of north indian, chinese menu. I am not so fond of their chinese and prefer their indian roti and sabzis. They have different dishes each day on offer and my favorite are the dal, bharwa bhindi, mix veg and their veg pulao. Whatever one might try, it would be good. The only factor is if you have gone for their best offering. 

Several great fooding options are available in the vicinity, but this place could be your best option when you aren't pre-decided about what you gonna have!!!

Located in Mangoe Lane,Dalhouise,the major office area of Kolkata,Kaka tea is very well known and popular among all the office goers.I was not much aware of the place myself.But I was attending a 3 day long session nearby and while looking for options for my meals,I came across this place.Instantly it became a hit among me and my friends.It became The place for lunch,snacks and tea for us and we had a great time.

Kaka tea operates from the morning till about early evening providing breakfast,lunch and snacks.The first time when we visited during lunch hours,we were taken aback by the variety of items on offer.Later we found out that the menu changes every day and the options remain equally diverse.During lunch you would get to choose from a rice item,a roti,a paratha or a different type of roti,like they had "missy roti" one day,chowmein and side dishes range from aloo dum,mixed veg,paneer item,baby corn,veg manchurian etc.

During breakfast or snacks they offer kachoris,samosas,dhoklas,kathis,veg or aloo chops etc.All the items we had were really tasty.The food was as close to home made food as one would find anywhere outside and yet very very tasty.Among the items I really liked were missy roti,aloo paratha,palak paneer,crispy babycorn,mixed veg,kachoris,vada and dhokla.

Apart from these,you will always get supply of good tea and a number of sweets.The tea is excellent and very rejuvenating.We mainly had tea with elaichi.Among the sweets,the gulab jamun is very good.Other sweets on offer are also pretty good.We even had their lassi.It was also quite thick and filling.

Coming to the negative aspects of the place,it has a self service system and there is no seating arrangement at all.There are number of tables arranged where one can keep the plates and have their food.Also,it is a vegeterain place only.Lastly the prices are on the higher side.For a place which does not even have seating facility the prices are quite high.But the quality of the food makes up for it quite a bit.

Another aspect about the place that I found quite appreciable is that though the place is more like a canteen but they maintain good cleanliness and hygiene.This,along with the quality of the food even more makes you feel like you are having a meal at home.
Overall kaka tea does a commendable job providing tasty homely food to hundreds of office goers and students regularly.This is a place which is surely worth recommending.

For you can take a Calcuttan out of Calcutta , but not Calcutta out of a Calcuttan..!! The food here has no comparison.
 The warmth, hospitality and the flavour- there is no second Culinary destination offering such a great variety and Im proud to have experienced many of them- KAKA tea being one ..!

This place should definitely have more than two top reviews and Im adding one to list..! 
Although this place tops the list of having no Ambience at all- but yet , how popular it is..!! Because - the Ambience is made by the little gosspis and talks people do over the cup of chai, the eager faces who are in a hurry to finish thier sumptuous food to rush back to office, the CA students who crib and complain of their tiring and boring schedule along with those bite of Samosas & Kachoris and those domestic and office helps who come with a huge sized Flask to fill tea and serve them to a dozen of people waiting for the same..!
 Yes- this is typically Kaka Tea..! 

They operate for Breakfast, Lunch and Snacks and are a fixed eating joint for thousands of people working in and around Dalhouise and Chandni Chowk..! 
Breakfast- the Sambhar Wadas, dipped as well as stand alone is something you can look forward for ..! Im sometimes amazed how the Vada can simply become so so delicious when dipped in Sambhar for an hour or so..! Its delectable . They also serve Kachori Sabzi and its good enough..! 
Lunch- A complete buffet spread..! They cook those stuffed Kulchas and Tandoori Rotis in the Kitchen behind and serve it piping hot. Sabzis keep changing on a day to day basis but the Love in the food is constant. Paneer is always on the option , however the variety and taste may differ- sometimes its Palak, sometimes Shahi, sometimes Kadhai..! Dal Tadka is again an amazing try..!
Snacks- Samosa , Chai , Kachori , Paneer Cutlet and some conversations..!!

Im strongly of the opinion that its so difficult to operate these humble eating joints..! You have people coming to you almost daily and they live on your food. Yes- its equivalent to Ghar ka Khaana to them and Ghar ka Khaana can only be one when its cooked with oodles of Love- because thats the most important ingrediant for a culinary delight..!

Kaka Tea doesnt have the most amazing Chai and Sweets in Kolkata though but then its no less either..! 

Its located so strategically! I mean- flanked by offices all around and most importantly its on the same building which has the famous SSEI , one of the most popular destination for CA and CFA students in Kolkata. Hence you'll always find a huge rush at 11 am and 6pm...and its then when the samosas and Kachoris dissapears with the blink of an eye..!

Kaka Tea- I could go on an on writing about you, but then good things should come to an end..!
Thank You- for having served good food all the time , and for never compromising on your quality standards..!!

PS- if a favourite was to be mentioned- I love the Paneer Chop with Green Chutney and a cup of Adrak waaali Chai- its heaven..!!

Kaka Tea is located at Mangoe Lane, Dalhousie BBD Bagh and its very easy to locate as the best way to locate is ask anyone from Nearby Amber restaurant or Aliah hotel, Chandni Chowk. Most of the people who are students or are into any offices nearby have their snack time out here at kaka tea. They specially deals with hot tea, gulab jamun , samosas and even Sambhar vada. It has occupied a large space in order to fit in their regular and daily customers. The food out there is outstanding without any questions or doubts relating to the hygiene. Not just that, they have even started providing kachoris which is very delicious!

Pros and cons of this place:-

Pros

1) Located nearby office areas and caters to the office staffs and students nearby in coaching centres. 
2) Specialises in providing Purely Vegetarian food which also makes it a preferred place by the vegetarians. 
3) The Food quality and quantity both are up to the mark.
4) Service is prompt.
5) Prices are kept minimal without compromising the food quality of the product. 

Cons:- 
1) No seating area.
2) Self service facility. 
3) Nothing as such a menu. 
4) Should update more food items as has a large space. 

To conclude, Kaka tea has become a food hub serving in numerous number of people's at minimal costs making it a place for get together. :)

I was introduced to Kaka Tea years back by a friend who has their office in Mangoe Lane. It started with the Chai and Samosas both of which are really good and fresh. I would actually prefer to go visit my friend at office so I could sample the chai and samosa ;-) . I also tried out the Masala Dosa which was surprisingly tasty and the gulab jamuns which were really good and huge to boot. They also serve a hugely popular vegetarian lunch and I  must confess that the Paneer Subzi and Roti was quite good as well. This place is hugely crowded and serves vegetarian food only but is cost - effective and has a huge following in the area.

An excellent eatery for the veg-lovers. This place is generally buzzing with office-goers and students alike for just one simple reason - good food at cheap price.

The food served is quite good and is not heavily spiced. They don't have a specific menu. But whatever is on the menu for the day is good enough to keep your taste buds wanting more.

A must have - hot gulabjamuns.  

A must try for any foodie.

It's the place to go to if you're in Dalhousie! Friendly on the pockets of students, Kaka Tea offers a wide variety of pure veg dishes. Considering the volume it serves to, seating arrangements would require a lot of changes in the setting. 
Friendly staff and a filling experience, this is the easily THE food place in Dalhousie...

Its a gem for the pure veg office people in and around Dalhousie area of Kolkata ....

Just go there around lunch time between 1 to 3 you would see even high profile people standing in queue for the food...

Such is the craze for Kaka's samosaa, gulab jamun & chai that the moment the tray full of samosaa comes in it just flies off.

PROs :: Food is quite good in taste and fresh. Gulab jamun is served steaming hot ..

Cons :: No menu for food you will have to order from the items that they prepare (they prepare diff items on diff day) ..... huge crowd fighting for space ...... food gets sold off by 3pm to max 4pm....
