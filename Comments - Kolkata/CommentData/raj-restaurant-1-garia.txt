A very popular food point in Garia. Quality and taste earns no complain. There should be sitting facility too. Well a good place for rolls and snacks. I recommend trying kebab rolls.

Been here many times..... When on my way home my hungry stomach ails me I go to Raj for rolls ... Their biryani is also worth a try.... You'll get to see lots of people taking away their rolls and biryani ..... The prices are just reasonable and pocket friendly.... They also have this seating arrangements for having food .... The place is clean

This restaurant is located near Garia bus stand. They have a takeaway counter where they serve various types of rolls as well as dine in space. I have tasted the Chicken roll and Chicken biryani. Chicken roll was amazing priced at Rs.40 , Chicken biryani was okayish which was priced at Rs.135.

A pretty good place for eating. Biryani is good and others also. Fried rice is preferable food. It's very pocket friendly restaurant. But I find two problems. One there is no parking and another this is not so tidy.

Located at prime location near Garia Bus Stand. They have an A/C section which is basically there restaurant part and a take away section where they have fast food stall. Tried their chicken roll. Roll was amazing and price was reasonable too. Only Rs. 40 for a mind-blowing chicken roll.

Raj is a pretty decent place. I do takeaways mainly from here. Their Indian dishes are amazing , specially chicken reshmi butter masala. Recently though I was disappointed by their chicken chap as it was awful, it had extra oil and unnecessary amount of onion.

This food joint is just opposite to Garia bus stand. It is quite easy to locate. I have visited there many times but recently when I visited there I was really shocked, they totally changed the look of the restaurant which is a very good initiative from the management team. Because previously the ambiance was really bad to enjoy your food. Apart from that interior nothing has changed. Food taste is still OK OK type. They really need to improve in that section. We ordered a full plate tandoori chicken which was above average in taste. We also ordered a one dry chili chicken which was not that much good, very oily and also the vegetables were not cooked well. But yes you can say it is quite pocket friendly. Initially thought of giving a 3 star but due to that nice interior change adding a 0.5 .

                I've tried out Chicken roll, Chicken Biryani and Mutton Kassa. The food was decent given the price point.

FINAL VERDICT- One can give this joint a try while looking for a casual tummy filler.

Today I ordered a chicken mughlai, but the bill was payment according to double egg chicken mughlai. I thought that they will make a double egg chicken mughlai, but today they just made it with chicken and take the price of double egg chicken mughlai. 
I will never go there further, the restaurant has become a fraud.

A long queue and big handis of biryani what I noticed first about this restaurant. As an avid biryani fan I visited one day. I was late and they have almost finished their day's stock. Anyway they could manage to deliver me two packets of biryani, one egg and one mutton. With nice aroma of biryani I noticed two opposite behaviour of the restaurant people. The service persons are very nice cordial and humble. But the counter persons, may be they were the owners, were very rude and plastic in their attitude. This is a service industry as a customer I expect cordiality at a restaurant not a plastic or rude behaviour. About the biryani I must say that this bazari biryani stands nowhere in the market. They can sell it by tonnes but this not good and healthy at all. They use taste maker type chemicals and chemicals to colour I guess. Mutton piece is sticky like the protein and fat is melted chemically not by boiling only. Very disappointed. Its like commercial main stream bengali movies that sells in the market but are rubbish.

This restaurant is located on the main road itself !It attracts quite a lot of crowd especially in the evenings.Although it is famous for its biryani, but I have always had rolls from here! It has a huge variety of rolls to choose from and honestly I had expected a lot from this shop, owing to the crowd that gathers here, but to my disappointment the rolls aren't anything exceptional! The regular chicken or egg roll! The parathas are crisp and the filling is moderate or rather 'regular'! In future I would like to try their biryani!

This restaurant is located opposite to the garia bus depot and is famous in the locality for their biryani. I've tried both their mutton and chicken biryani and I've liked it. Quantity and quality both are nice. The restaurant is pocket friendly as well so that's a plus.
The problem with dining in is the fact that the restaurant lacks space. In my humble opinion it is better off as a take away counter. Service is not noteworthy.

This place is situated right beside Garia 5no bus stop.This place is good for rolls.But they need to workout a bit on their behaviour.Sometimes they behave very rudely with the customers.Overall ok place.

Raj Restaurant easily has the best location amongst eateries of all sorts in Garia. Situated right beside the Garia crossing, opposite the Bus terminus, it's not surprising to see this outlet decently crowded most of the time and the rush somewhat assures the quality one would expect. I'm oblivious to the dining area, the staff & service or the quality provided in dine-in. I've only had takeaways twice from here. 

They take a while to deliver but it is understandable as they cater to quite a many orders at once. I've tried Palak Paneer, Tandoori Roti & Biriyani from here. Roti was tender, and not at all chewy although it was packed and I had it almost an hour later. Palak paneer tasted amazing! But it was a little too oily and although I personally didn't mind it much given how lovely it tasted, some people might want to be warned. 

On another instance, having heard so much about their biriyani, I decided to try it. It was disappointing and not up to the mark. I don't know whether that's how they make it or whether it was an unfortunate one-time thing, the quality and the taste was at the best "average". ¬†

Quantity wise it's good value for money. Proportions are decent, but the mixed experiences I've had here has left me wondering if only some of their dishes are savory and worth a try!

Its one of the most famous restaurants in Garia area,located just opposite the 5 bus stand and beside the Bata showroom. 
This restaurant is mostly famous for their mohlai dishes. 
I had a lot of dishes from them in the past. 
Recently had the chicken biriyani taken away. 
The biriyani was brilliant. Although i seemed from the colour of the biriyani it to be spicy. But wasn't at all very light and flavourful. They served the biriyani with a bid sized chicken piece, an egg and a big sized potato. Although i feel that the amount of rice was a little less. Though other things compensated that. 
So overall the biriyani was very good. So i would love to visit here again and have some other dishes too...

One of the oldest food joints in Garia. I visited with one of my brothers. We ordered Hakka Egg Chicken Chow, the price was OK but the chicken pieces were hard....as if fried and kept in fridge for 1-2 days. But overall the taste not so good but quantity was good.

As per an expert review it serves best biryani in garia! Well i would say i have a doubt, did that person ever had a taste of proper biryani?
 I had biryani from this place twice, the second time seeking for a better experience. But no, the overly aromatic biryani, the dry chicken with an astringent smell in it is one of the worst biryani one can ever taste in kolkata. So this place is not for biryanis, instead you should go for rolls at this place to quench your hunger. Also, the chinese they make here is quite decent than their indian items which they offer in menu. Chicken fried rice and chili chicken which i had over here in the restaurant itself was nice and quantity was also good. Other than that you shouldn't really order anything else as it wont be sufficient for the money you spend, everything else tastes same as other food stalls in garia. So, it does not deserve more than three stars being a consistent street food producer in garia.

The outlet remains busy and crowded most of times specially at the peak hours in the evening. It is located just opposite to the 5 No. Bus Stand at the Garia More and is recommended for takeaway only. Haven't dined in here but seeing it from outside can say that the ambiance is very very ordinary. Chicken Biriyani served is not that rich, it's light but yet tasty. The portions are good. The rolls provided are really tasty and contains ample bits of chicken. Service time is also on the higher side.

Located right at the heart of Garia, right beside The BATA outlet bang opposite to 5 no. bus depot, this place is quite popular amongst people for its impressive and convenient location predominantly. It sells rolls, biriyani( which is quite good to taste and economically viable at the same time), roti, naan, north Indian side dishes. The no of rolls it sells during peak hours( evening) is crazy. The food quantity is sufficient however quality isn't upto the mark. Also I've serious concern regarding the hygiene. The service is quite prompt considering the demand. I wish it had a proper sitting air conditioned area for customers, giving them a choice to either opt for take away or to sit and enjoy the food there which is most of the times a distant thought to do in a non ac shabby seating area, considering the heat and humidity.

This place is located on the opposite foot of Garia 5 no. Bus Stand just beside BATA. Raj restaurant is popularly known for rolls and the average priced biryani. Mughlai Cuisine foods are good to taste followed by the Tandoori cuisine. When you are running short of money and want to visit a restaurant, then you must not miss to visit this place.

It's located right opposite to Garia 5 no bus stand. One would rarely miss to locate it. 

When you have shortage of money and you want average tasted food in affordable prices you are ought to visit this place. 

I went in with my friends after a hectic college day, so we decided to go in there to have some good food. 

We ordered for chicken Tikka kebabs as starters. Alas! That dish wasn't available. So we decided to have some fish fingers as it was the only dish available as starters. We ordered for Chicken Chowmein and Boneless Chicken Manchurian. 

The fish fingers tasted okay, it wasn't that delicious but we could go on with it. 

The Chowmein was at par, it was filled more with vegetables and the chicken were slightly on the lower end. Aahh, would've liked if there were less vegetables. 

The chicken Manchurian completely tasted somewhat good. But only later we found that in some pieces there were slight bones too. That completely let us down. The fact that we ordered boneless chicken and in turn ended up getting a with bone chicken Manchurian was disheartening for us. 

The waiters were average. The service took quite a lot of time and whenever we would ask the update we would get a reply that it's almost ready. 

The ambiance was dull. Nothing appealed to be attractive! 

More improvements needed in this place. You get good chicken rolls here. The food is average. So when you've shortage of money get in here and if you're lucky you might get "boneless" chicken too.

Got a takeaway of Tandoori Rotis and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala from here today and boy they were good! The rotis were huge n smokey and the chicken well marinated with a thick hot gravy. The heat in the chicken gave a nice kick to the rotis and all of these in such a dirt cheap price! This place though is strictly for takeaways, would advise against dining here.

The restaurant is right next to Garia Bata showroom and is our go-to place when we have an unplanned biriyani/kebab party. Or, in general, feeling hungry for a chicken roll once we get down from a bus at Garia. They have renovated the place and it looks much better now. You can either go for takeaway or have the food inside. Pocket pinch is on the lower side. Kebabs are pretty good. Biriyani is surprisingly good. No wonder the restaurant is always busy serving customers!

When I used to stay in Garia, this used to be the place from where we would often pack some quick rolls and kebabs.( Aminia wasn't there then) 
Their service is still quick and most of their staff are still the same. Have seen them grow from a normal mediocre food joint to a decent take away restaurant. Kudos to the team.

Good quantity and good quality of food for relatively much lower prices, that's Raj restaurant for you. I'm going here for almost two years, their quality of service haven't changed. 
The best thing about the restaurant? As everyone is saying, The Biriyani. Note that, Navratna Pulao, Mutton Kasha, Pepper chicken, these dishes are worth trying too. 
Only negative thing about this restaurant is the sitting place, it's not so much comfortable, specialy in summer. But I hope the taste of the  foods will make you overlook that fact for sure.
So, in case of casual hangouts, this is the restaurant for you.

I am giving this review based on their super tasty briyani! I think it's the best briyani around Garia area sometimes even better than Aminia.
Food - I had to mention about briyani. They also offer known chinese food and snacks like roll. I had mughlai paratha too, which was decent. I have been eating here since so many years. Not a fancy place still good. You can see their big biriyani kadai infront of the store.
Location - it is just opposite of garia bus stand, beside Bata shoe store. They had bigger space before but they now have reduced it.
They also offer dine in space inside but it's not good. It is missed usually. Low light and shady. People usually prefer to take parcel.
Price - prices are reasonable. No extra vat or tax. Price of briyani is around 110 last time. Overall reasonable. 
So go and grab their briyani blindly worth eating and let me know how was it :)

Situated right on the main road of Garia, its like any roadside dhaba style restaurant. Definitely not a place to look out for ambience, service, cleanliness..However, I am a fan of their rolls. I am regular visitor for their chicken roll. I don't bother sitting in, takeaway is the best, cause its always so crowded. It a bit different from other rolls. Chicken quantity in roll in good. The outer roti of the roll is slightly crispy. Good roadside roll option!!

I have had their rolls, biriyani and Fish fry.. All of them were good. The place is always overcrowded and I would not recommend it for a dine out. Just one of those pocket friendly roadside takeaways with a few tables.
