excellent cafe and courteous staff..and the best thing is their price which suits all ..¬†good preparation¬† of all kinds of food and beverages that they offer and realistic pricing...and a good ambience¬†one americano and one cappucino will cost u 126 in total ... not like ccd where u have to shell out double for even inferior cups....

Located just a few blocks away from Abar baithak , this place can be called a upgraded version of abar baithak itself. Has a separate smoking area. Ambience of the place is awesome and soothing. Staff is pretty Courteous. 

The food we ordered and the mocktails we had were just made to minute perfections. The whole experience was awesome. Will surely visit again.

Heard about it and made plans, but never had a chance to visit it. A sudden morning plan gave us a chance and we set foot for this food joint. The fist thing I loved about this place is its outside area. Now comes the main part, food. As we ordered a Chicken BBQ Pizza, a Chicken Club Sandwich, a Kitkat Shake and a Orange Juice - Pizza crust was very soft and tasty. Sandwich was really good with lots of cheese and mayo (cheese lover I am üòÄ). The shake was tasty too, but I loved its decor more üòã . Service was really good, people were friendly. Their ambience attracted me the most.

How to Reach: The nearest famous land mark is South City Mall. This place is located a little inside from the main street, being a little hard to find. Better option, to book a uber or ola to the destination. This place has been the heart beat among the college goers and youngster. I wondered why, before visiting the place. The place has a particular aura that will automatically lift your mood. Vibrant colour, music and cozy sitting arrangement. This place also has outdoor sitting arrangement. The interior has been wisely decorated with blue and yellow. i loved the way they used kettles as lights hanging from the ceiling. They also has a guitar and keyboard that you can play.

Though the place is a little bit small and crowded most of the time, the food is worth it. I am a fan of honey mustard chicken here. Had peri peri chicken, chicken steak, choco marvel pastry, kitkat shake, oreo shake and some of more shakes and trust me guys - every bit of food was tastey as heck. It turned out for me as a very good place to catch up with good old friends with mouth watering food....

I visited this place few days ago with a friend. It was very easy to locate. The ambience was cozy with nice Bollywood music. We ordered a Barbeque Chicken Pizza, and a KitKat shake. The pizza was served sizzling hot with lots of cheese, oozing out from the pizza. The crust of the pizza was soft yet a little crunchy, which was perfect! And the KitKat shake was absolutely mind blowing, garnished with pomegranates, KitKat and cherries.
And to top it all, the staff was courteous and service was pretty quick.

Blue mug is a lovely cafe located in the interiors of Jodhpur park. It is nicely decorated with indoor as well as outdoor seating arrangements.
Ambience is great. And staff is quite cordial.
Coming to the food. We ordered
BBQ chicken pizza : must try. It's cheesy tasty and filled with toppings
Crunchy  garlic mushroom: it's filled with cheese and paneer and is a nice appetizer. 
Virgin mojito: nothing extraordinary but tasted quite nice. 
Choco marvel pastry: the best dish. Must try. It's chocolaty with molten chocolate. And a layer of red velvet cake. 
And it's quite affordable.

I am absolutely in love with the place! The place is not very difficult to locate. I went there for my sister's birthday. We ordered:
'Chicken Steak Sizzler' which was absolutely mouth watering!
'BBQ Chicken Pizza' was very cheesy and too yummy.
'Brownie Shake' & 'Chocolate Monk are perfect shakes for all chocolate lovers!
'Blueberry Smoothie' was okay!
'Cranita Mocktail' was the best that we ordered. It was very refreshing and goes well with any dish that you order. Highly recommended.
i was really surprised with the service. They even played the birthday song for her. The manager himself came up to wish her. Ambience is good.

Small but nice decorated, also have a terrace like portion. Not a proper dinning place rather a cafeteria. We have tried crispy fried prawn and sausage chicken wings, both are excellent in taste but the another one, wrapped becon is not so good. One suggestion from my point of view that one must have some time while going to this restaurant because it takes a little more time than usual. Otherwise it's a good place of having fun with food.

So the other evening I stepped into this cafe with my mum and dad! Ordered a single shot cafe mocha for myself and they ordered 2 cups of cappuccino with a plate of french fries! 
The service was a tad slow I felt! Cause we almost had to wait for 15 mins before we got the cappuccinos and the mochas! 
However, the beverages tasted divine! 
The mocha had the perfect balance between the caffeine and the chocolate.
The french fries too tasted pretty damn delicious!
Having said that, one thing I notice at every restaurant or diner or cafe I visit is the ambience and mood.
And I've got issues with that when it comes to this cafe!
You guys should know that when you run a cafe, every element should be in sync. A restaurant should harmonize all elements, starting from interior design, ambience, food and beverages, quality of wait staff, to of course the music, which is the most important of all! 
You guys have the interiors done all serene and calm with moderately dim lights, but the music you guys play continuously is quiet the opposite. Its just continuous hard rock and EDM that I heard the whole one hour I was there! 
Also I feel that since it's a CAFE, it should cater well to ALL kinds of visitors, whether it's peer groups or couples or families. You guys could really improve the ambience and make it suitable for ALL kinds of visitors and not just the young blood which you guys currently do!
I really hope that my honest and heartfelt opinion about my visit to your place is helpful and constructive for you guys! 
Much love!

Locating this place wasn't easy at all. Coming from Park Circus side and not knowing the locality well, we had to follow Google maps. We also had to wait for fifteen twenty minutes to get a proper table. So the 4 star is only for the food. 
Since it was just two of us we ordered a Chicken Steak (main course), a lemon ice tea and a Brownie with Ice Cream. I was thoroughly impressed by the quantity and presentation of food. The Chicken Steak with herb rice and veggies tasted exquisite! The Brownie with Ice cream was infact a sizzler and loaded with walnuts and chocolate sauce. The food was delightful which makes me wanna visit again to try out other dishes from their extensive menu. 
The decor was pretty and not over the top. Ambience was cozy and staff was friendly.

A very nice place to hangout with your friends and loved ones.

Going by the ambience, this place includes both indoor and outdoor seating.

Going by the food, the quality and quantity is very nice and value for money.

Going by the service and staff, everyone was well behaved except the staff were some times delivering food of other people to different table, however, they themselves were handling the things properly.

Note: Please have some time in your hand if you want to be part of this place since its highly demanding and everytime crowded. 

Cheers!!

Everything was good, the chicken steak was not made the way a steak is made but it was really good given how it was made with an amazing sauce . The burger was also pretty good.

This is a nice place amd budget friendly. Ambienceis nice and hands down the taste is good as well . The garden area is also nice but we preferred to sit inside. Firstly we ordered cheese nachos which had a crispy tangy cheesy taste which we liked then we ordered chicken wings with some walnut sauce wchisch was the best of all and we also ordered a stake and sizzler which was moderate in case of taste overall a good experience. Must give it a try once surely you will like it.

Blue mug is situated at a distance of 15mins from kalighat metro , Also from dakshinapan if you're availing that route. 
Ambience is nothing very quirky but has a touch of youth. As soon as you enter the cafe you spot a bar counter but to your surprise that's a mocktail bar.
Blue mug let's you opt in between indoor and outdoor seating (go for the outdoor one if it's not very hot, there's a swing that adds up to the feel). 
Coming on to the food standard, I'd say it's nice. I mean nothing very out of the box but yeah definitely satisfying but you must keep in mind that the maincourse they serve has little portion and will do justice to a single stomach only. 
This cafe goes comparatively light on pocket.
What we ordered: crunchy garlic filled mushroom( the best of the lot) , fish and chips , perry perry chicken , tulip mouse. 
Taste: 3.5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Value for money: 4/5
Total billing amount: rs750

This place is one of those upstarts when it comes to Continental food, as there arent many places in South Calcutta that serve primarily this cuisine, that too this easy on the wallet. It may be worthy of all the patronage and tall words of praise it has earned; but I would rather not visit Blue Mug again.
For one thing, the music is too loud. Honestly, how hard can it be nowadays to find an eatery that will allow you to have a conversation with your companion without having to shout, or if you happen to have a sore throut (like I did), abandon the endevour altogether! Well cant really blame the place either: people, I guess, dont mind.
Still, it wouldnt harm to maintain the balance between this music blaring aimed at crowd pleasing and an earnest request from a customer when she speaks up for lowering the volume.
The staff is quite indifferent and does not put in an effort to strike a chord.
Finally, the description of the food items on the menu should be made more accurate with regards to the spice content, for instance. Otherwise people might just be expecting a non spicy take on 'Fish Cubes' and end up with fish chunks and (unnecessarily large quantities of) bell peppers tossed in an extremely hot assortment of spices üò≥. Not desirable.
Apart from this, the food items we tried werent that impressive (although these would have been able to lure me back because of the affordability, had it not been for the experiences mentioned above).

Three things come to my mind now when i think about this place. Loud, inconsiderate and ignorance.

The food is quite pocket friendly, the taste still has a long way to go, the continental dishes seem to have a touch of the Asian cuisine as well. The people are mostly not bothered about customer preferences, or even asking about preferences and seemed ignorant about the recipes. 

I guess that is what expected out of them. Since this place has an open setting where you can smoke and chat, however the insanely loud music won't let me talk or hear anything.

This place was in my bucket list from a long time ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.. So finally went there on last week..
And this place is such a great place..
# Ambience - Beautiful ambience and peaceful also.. There were two seating arrangements.. Outdoor and indoor.. It was winter so i chose indoor seating and also outdoor seating was not available.. This place os filled with people.. The guiter piano and books on one side looks really good.. Over all loved the place.. And the behavior of the stuff is also good and they helped us to choose the food..

# Food- So we ordered
@ Barbeque Pizza- Great.. Super cheesy and soft.. I loved it.. Full on topping
@ Arabiata Pasta- I am not a pasta fan but after having this i became one.. This is so tasty and cheesy.. They served it with two breads..
@ Choco Marvel pastry- Oh my god.. Super tasty.. Loved it.. Served it with hot chocolate sauce
@ Chocolate Cone- another delicious dessert.. Perfect amount of sweetness
@ Tulip mousse- I personally didn't like it it was little tangy in taste.. I am not fond of blueverry so

Next time i really wanna try their appetizers and mockta

I had heard a lot about this place from my friends and thought of giving it a try which indeed was worth it. The place was easy to be located and was well decorated. The staff was courteous and the food was tasty. We ordered a veg cheese burger,  chicken mayonnaise sandwich with an Oreo mint shake to which the bill came to 399 with tax which is very reasonable. Hence the place is a must try :)

I have been here once before and that was a good experience. The place is cosy and the food is also good providing an allover good experience. So i visited this place yesterday too. Due to a surge in business for the festivities,the staff has become reckless, incompetent to take orders correctly. I eaited for 1.5 hrs for a Chicken Steak Sizzler because they didn't even realise that they had taken the order wrongly and when i pointed it out the serving staff behaved inappropriately . May be it was a bad day for me but the kind of behavior they had on plate wasn't at all appreciative .

Visited Blue Mug with my friends. Nice small cafe and nicely decorated. We sat outside in the smoking area as no place was available inside. The outside decor is also nice and cozy. We ordered...
1. Fish and chips- The fish was fried properly and it was served with French fries and a dip.
2. BBQ chicken pizza- The pizza tasted awesome.
3. Oreo shake - It was served with cream and decorated with oreo biscuits on top of it. It was tasty.
4. Brownie shake - It was similar in taste with oreo shake except it was decorated with brownie on top.
Overall like it and the price was reasonable.

Tucked away in the by lanes of Jodhpur Park is this cafe with coloured teapots in the shades of blue, yellow and black.

We had the following:-

Starters/ Entree :

1. Chicken bbq pizza - The pizza was really good. The crust had just the right thickness, right softness and right crispness at the base. Highly recommended.

2. Cheese fondue - This entree was basically bread along with cheese dip which was unusually tasty since it was served with some herbes mixed with it. Loved it too. But costly compared to the price.

3. Fish and chips- This is the quintessential fish fry and French fries along with cheese dip. All tasted good.

4. Crispy Corn - Had corn fried in some batter which made it very crispy. The first bite would be very crunchy, and then juicy because of the moisture present in the corn.

5. Cream of Chicken Soup - good old soup to keep the cold away.

Main course :

1. Grilled fish sizzler - This was amaze. Simply amaze. The fish was well cooked. The sizzler had fries accompanied by carrots, broccoli and beans all saut√©ed.

2. Peri peri chicken - Had rice, saut√©ed vegetables again but the chicken, i felt was a little hard. I felt they could have done something with the chicken. It just wasn't cooked right. This therefore is the only dish that disappointed.

Drinks:

1. Brownie shake - This won my heart. The shake was delivered in those cool bottles where instead of a lid, they covered it with brownie and chocolate, on top of which they dressed it with cream, more brownies sliced in rectangular pieces and a cherry on the top.
YOU CANNOT LEAVE BLUE MUG WITHOUT HAVING THIS.

2. Blue lagoon
3. Fresh Lime Soda.

Desserts :

1. Blueberry Cheese Pastry - It wasn't the best cheese cake i've had but this was good considering the dirt cheap price.

So, all in all, Blue Mug Cafe was a remarkable food experience for me. And i surely will come back to this place if they promise to keep the price as low as it is now.

:)

Perfect 5 for this restaurant. This restaurant is located in Jodhpur Park near Abar Baithak. Just 5minutes from the Jodhpur Park Bus Stop. As we visited this place on 25th December for the lunch there was a qeue and we had to wait for 30 mintues to enter inside the reastaurant but there is no regret after having the foods. Cool environment, Sophisticated deciration. You can have food inside the AC room or also can seat outside which is decorated with trees. Well behaved staffs. And foods are quite reasonable. Pocket friendly. 
Now come to the Foods. We ordered Blue Lagoon and Virgin Mojito in braverage, Chicken Steak Sizzler and chicken lasagne. 
üîπBlue lagoon was too good, they put cherries and Grape inside this drink. Virjin Mojito asusal best. 
‚úîÔ∏èThe Chicken Steak Sizzler: The best sizzler I ever had. The taste was spectacular and I wish to have it again and again. This this the Most recommended dish.  üíØ
üî∏Chicken Lasagne: it came with toasted breads. Lasagne Made with pasta sheets, chicken and cheese. Little spicy. Good one. 
Best place for continental food. Even better than the steak factory. Will visit again to taste other dishes.

It was on my bucket list for a long time.
We went there on Christmas evening.
It was full of people amd we had to wait for more than half an hour and it was worth it.
We got our table at the outdoor seating.
We ordered kit kat shake, chicken bbq pizza and mexican French fries
The kit kat shake was good enough. The flavour of kit kat could be evidently found in the shake.
The pizza was the best. Though a 8-inch pizza with 4 slices the taste is way better than many pizzas at domino's. Perfect combo of cheese, spice, vegetables. It's a bit juicy and spicy.
The French fries had a bit of spices with small amount of fresh herbs sprinkled over it. The dip was awesome.
Decor, staff behavior and food quality is what makes the place so over- hyped.
It's all worth it. Though it shows 700 for two, all these rounded up to around 500. So it's quite pocket friendly..

FINALLY on last Wednesday, I visited this place, alongwith my friends.

It is located in the Jodhpur park area(can be located easily by entering the opposite lane of South City mall). 

The decor is quite pretty.It has both AC and Non-AC seating  arrangements.

We preferred the AC ones.

And, we ordered :

1. BBQ Chicken Pizza : It tasted very good; full of cheese, crunchy onions, and had a good crust.The size of the pizza was okay.

2. Brownie shake : It was heavenly. That hidden choco brownie(full of whipped cream) with shake was yummilicious. PARADISE it was!!

3. Kitkat shake : It was a bit okayish. It was just a simple milk chocolate shake decorated with kitkat and whipped cream.

Courteous staffs.

Just waiting for my 2nd visit!!

Went to have lunch at blue mug on Christmas Eve. Blue mug is situated at one of the lanes of Jodhpur Park. A little tricky to find, but Google maps is there as a saviour. It's a small cafe with an area for outdoor seating as well. 
Coming to food, we ordered bacon wrapped sausages and cottage cheese balls for starters along with a KitKat shake. 
The bacon wrapped sausages were really salty for my palate though both the components of the dish was cooked to perfection individually. 
The cottage cheese balls were spicy deep fried balls of cottage cheese served with a cool tangy tartare sauce. They were smoking hot and the sauce complemented the spicy balls well.
Next was the KitKat shake which was served in a mason jar and was huge in size. It is primarily chocolate shake with scoops of ice cream completed with a blob of whipped cream on top and pieces of KitKat. The shake was very fulfilling and decadent.

For the mains we ordered a chicken steak sizzler and a chicken lasagna.
The chicken steak sizzler was served on a sizzling plate and was accompanied with sauted vegetables. The chicken steak was a chicken breast stuffed with cottage cheese filling and completed with a sweet and spicy sauce.
Lastly, the chicken lasagna was served and it was the star of the whole lunch. Served on a bed of cheese sauce with layers of cheese on top, and then baked. The lasagna sheets were soft and the chicken filling was spicy which helped to cut through the acidity of so much cheese. Each layer of the lasagna were filled with gooey molten cheese along with gooey cheese sauce layered on top. It was served with two toasted breads. The portions presented is humongous for the lasagna and was sufficient for two people. 
We all were completely full so didn't have space for desserts.
Service was a tad slow, maybe because the staff were a little busy with Christmas decorations at that moment. But the food proved to be worth the wait. 
Total bill for three people added up to be INR1176 including GST.

Visited this cafe for Christmas brunch. Their decor is cute. We sat on the sofa swing. It was quite good. The service was pretty slow. We waited for 45 minutes. We had ordered veg club sandwich was nice and light to eat. The veg sizzler was spicy and the French fries were undercooked. We didn't like the veg sizzler. A bowl of rice would do justice to the dish. The brownie shake was awful. The salsa nachos was pathetic. The waiter served us chicken club sandwich and after eating a bite when we realised and charged him he was casual about it and laughed it off. Pathetic service.

I don't remember any restaurant on my bucket list that has been so appealing as Blue Mug. Though this cafe is a bit obscure when it comes to location, it is sure to win hearts. We opted for the outdoor seating which was pretty dainty in its look with Christmas lights adorning the make-shift trees all around.
This was my first go at Mexican cuisine and I have to say that I am sold by the flavour Blue Mug has managed to bring out.
The dishes tried were--
‚ù§Peri Peri Chicken-- If balance is what makes a dish sing, this dish sang its heart out. With two sumptuous pieces of grilled chicken served with a helping of sweetened flavoured rice, what made this dish come together was the peri peri sauce served along with it. The sauce hit the palate with a bang of hotness and spice which is enough to bring tears to your eyes if taken solo, but when combined with the sweet rice and chicken, it is enough to lift you to cloud 9.
‚ù§Honey Mustard Chicken-- My favourite dish of the day! Perfect combination of the sweetnees of honey and the strong punch of mustard is what defines this dish. The grilled chicken breast pieces were perfectly cooked which tasted beautiful with the honey mustard sauce in the background.
‚ù§Chipotle BBQ Wings Sizzler-- If there is an award for the best chicken wings in town, I would vote for the ones at Blue Mug without a doubt. The wings were tender, full of the hot and sweet tang and flavour and the meat was so perfect that it simply fell off the bones. The french fries served along was the perfect complement with the olives. Highly recommendedüòä
We ended the meal with,
‚ù§Chocolate cone-- Frankly I found nothing to rave about this dish. The cone was extremely hard and too thick which made it difficult to chew into it. The only saviour was the faithful old flavour of chocolate which was the only good thing about the dessert.
‚ù§Choco Marvel cake-- I would implore anyone reading my review to not leave this cafe without having a go at this perfection of a dessert. The oozing hot chocolate was one to go gaga over and the red velvet interspersed in between the layers was visually beautiful and tasted brilliant at the same time. Lovely way to end the meal.
The staff was good enough and there is nothing to complain about them and the pocket pinch is very reasonable. 
Overall, it was a memorable experience at Blue Mug and I would love to visit this cafe yet again.

I heard about this cafe quite a lot. It‚Äôs at Jodhpur Park, a quiet, yet happening place away from the hustle of the city. One good thing about this place is that I can just walk up from my house whenever I want. 

The first time I visited Blue Mug, I fell in love with their ambience. The overall decor is very good with both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. People working there are very well mannered and friendly. Sometimes, you might like the fact of having a friendly chat with the person who is attending you for the day. I personally do instead of following the stereotype method of ordering food. 

I am a coffee person and whenever I visit a new cafe, I first prefer having a good cup of coffee that they can offer. Blue Mug was able to impress me as I was both satisfied with the variety of coffee beans they had to offer and the way the coffee was brewed. A must visit for any coffee lovers of Kolkata. 

Now coming to the solid foods, I tried the Chicken Lollipops and I absolutely loved it. The Chicken was fresh, succulent and had the perfect combination of spices. I really loved it. 

Next on the list was the Chicken Club Sandwich. I would really appreciate the way it was made with so much love and care. Personally, I prefer homemade sandwiches rather than going out and having it. But this sandwich literally made me change my mind and think otherwise. 

Overall, this place is very nice and pocket friendly. If you love to engage yourself in long conversations over a cup of coffee and a sandwich in a quiet and tidy cafe, then this is the place you should be. Trust me, your pocket won‚Äôt suffer that much.

One of my favourite caf√©s in Kolkata, Blue Mug serves you a variety of delicacies, all under one roof. We had French fries, chicken lollipops, crispy fried prawns, KitKat shake and coke. Even after all this the bill was only 690/-. Thus it is extremely pocket friendly, the service being amazing and the food, outstanding.

A nice continental hub in the by-lanes of Jodhpur Park. Quirky and cozy with leather sofas they surprised with great tasting food. The Bacon wrapped sausages were pretty awesome. The best was the Lamb Sizzler melting in mouth. The Chicken Cordon Bleu and Chicken Lasagna were cheesy and soft. Wist we were given two more bread pieces to dip in the Lasagna. Topping off with Kitkat Shake was okayish. Overall reaally a good one.

We had been wondering for long to visit at this place and finally we succeeded to step in at Blue Mug . There was no table for two peoples so we had to sit outside . The ambience was cool and the behaviour of stuffs were also nice . We ordered BBQ chicken pizza which was very cheesy and and nice to taste. Brownie shake was creamy and one of the best shakes we had ever had and lastly we ordered cheese fonde which looks very classy with candle glowing at the bottom of the dish which keeps the cheese sauce warm. I would love to visit this place again and will  order some different stuffs ...

It's a beautiful cosy place for a warm coffee evening. The Chicken Steak sizzler is quite decent. The Kitkat shake was humongous, it was tasty but I feel it would be better if they do away with the frosting. The coffee was good, but their only problem is, they mess up the order. In our last visit , we ordered pizza, they got us sandwich. This recent visit, we asked for coffee to be served later, they got everything at the same time. Other than that, it's quite nice. The decor is quite pleasant.

I had heard nice things about this caf√© but I was disappointed. The food was average. Management and writers were not at all good. In middle of having lunch we were told by a waiter to change our seats. When in fact we were given specific options in the beginning about where to sit. The manager didn't apologize. Waiters kept asking our orders and kept confirming them to us and still gave the deserts first. Not a good experience.

Pasta

Bbq chicken burger.
The pizza was very soft and delicious.
The rest was good, not the best.
We also ordered a birthday cake. The cake was mouthwatering. It was Blackforest cake with butterscotch chips. The best of the list! 
The environment of this place is really nice.
But the service of the food was time consuming which was not expected.

The place has two types of seatings : AC seating and the outdoor Non Ac seating. The ambience of this place is good and it remains crowded even during weekdays. The staffs are well behaved and quick. Coming to the food we ordered Chicken Steak Sizzler, Chicken Club Sandwich and Kitkat Shake.

Chicken Steak Sizzler : it was really good and the taste was just perfect. The stuffing inside the chicken was done well. 

Chicken  Club Sandwich : The sandwiches were yummy.  The were soo healthy and light.  Stuffed with cheese,  chicken,  eggs, salads and mayonnaise my taste buds were just enjoying it. 

Kit Kat Shake : The bestest part.  Its was just amazing. The shake was filled with kitkat,  chocolate crunches, cream. The quantity of the shake was also very good. 

Looking forward to try the other shakes in their menu. This place is a must visit for every foodie.  The pricing of the dishes is also very reasonable. üòÄ

This place is close to the eedf near Jodhpur park. Nicely tucked away from the hustle of the city..yet easy to reach. It has a very nice ambience. Decor is pretty good. It also has outdoor seating options. Staffs are very well mannered and cordial. Now coming to food..we ordered the chicken bbq pizza,onion rings and french fries. For drinks we had kitkat shake and cranberry juice. The pizza was nice and fresh baked. The onion rings were crunchy and hot and french fries were cooked to perfection. The kitkat shake was to die for. Another bonus point is this place is super pocket friendly. I would suggest that you can grab a lite bite here at very nominal prices.

I was very much excited for Chicken lasagne as i was going to try the dish for the first time. But alas! It disappointed me. The dish was too much sour and salty; may be its for the cheese. As I'm not a cheese lover i didn't like it at all but I found it excessively salty. So lasagne experience was not good. Beside that we tried chicken lollipops. Chickens were tender and tasty as well; cooked perfectly. Brownie shake was different in taste. We had all of these at an affordable price. And Overall decoration was pretty nice. Ambience was really good. Outdoor seating was also available there. Anish Roy

Very cosy cafe at jodhpur park serving much mouth watering stuff..we tried barbecue chicken pizza which melted in the mouth along with chicken steak sizzler which also was just tenderly cooked n yum.Then we tried double shot cappuccino which was strong n blissful. We rounded off our meal with delicious friend crispy prawns ( quantity and quality was awesome) along with bruchehetos which is a type of stuffed garlic bread with peri peri. To sum up this is one cosy joint with both indoor and outdoor facilities which you won't want to miss for its sheer value for money and yummy food.

This charming cafe is located just a short walk away from the Selimpur bus stop. Tucked into the picturesque lanes of Jodhpur Park, Blue Mug cafe is perfect for a nice brunch and adda with friends.

¬†¬† AMBIENCE: As you step into the cafe, you're surrounded by warmth and the instagram worthy interiors. The cafe is lit up by quirky kettle lamps and several art pieces and paintings that provide a pop of colour. The music is soft and unintrusive and will probably have some of your favourite tracks too! Even the bottles and cutlery have a unique design which adds to the charm.

¬†¬† FOOD: Here's what we (a group of 5 people) ordered-¬†

1) BBQ Chicken Pizza - this dish came highly recommended by the reviews on Zomato, and for all the right reasons! The pizza is cheesy and the crust is soft and toasty. It's loaded with juicy succulent chicken, tangy bbq sauce, crunchy fresh veggies and lots of cheese. Just thinking of it makes me salivate :')
¬†¬† 2) Chicken Salami Pizza -¬† this one too was loaded with cheese and toppings. It was tasty in its own way, with creamy cheese and salami and the crunchy capsicum. However, by this time I had already lost my heart to the bbq chicken xD
¬†¬† 3) Chicken Lollipops - ooh this one was a favourite of two of my friends who couldn't stop raving about it. The quantity is good, and it's just crispy, saucy goodness. Really a treat for the eyes and the tastebuds.
¬†¬† 4) Brownie Shake - ah another favourite of mine :') It's a yummy thick shake with bits of brownie and cream on the top. Also, the cute jars are sealed with a thick layer of dark chocolate which is probably the best part. It is a really wholesome shake. ¬†
¬† 5) Kit-Kat Shake - same as the brownie shake but with kitkat. I loved this one too, and it has kitkats blended into the shake itself, giving it an interesting texture. ¬†

¬† SERVICE: The staff was warm and courteous, and the food was served in a reasonable amount of time. The waiters were especially attentive without being overbearing, and seamlessly refilled the tissue box and our glasses. We spent around 2 hours and weren't bothered once during the whole time.

¬†¬† POCKET PINCH: If you visit this place with a group of friends, it's very easy on the pocket. I shared a pizza and shake with my friend and tasted every dish we ordered, and all it cost me was 167 rupees (including taxes). So yeah, it's really value for money and you'll get to try a lot of the dishes.

¬†¬† FINAL THOUGHTS: I would surely recommend this place and I'll probably go back myself for the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Brownie Shake :D

So we've been planning for long to come to this place, finally we came and it was worth a try. Such a cool place with good decor, outdoor seating was also there. And the main part is food - all the dishes we ordered were soo good . Bbq chicken pizza was full of toppings and cheese and the crust was so soft. And then chicken steak dish was a perfectly balanced dish. Before going to that place, I've heard a lot about their shakes ,so we ordered one, brownie shake.. it was good,really good. Over all blue mug was really good, pocket friendly place.

I would make it simple for the readers. Depending upon the price and the quality of food and drink Blue mug provides it is the best cafe in south calcutta without any doubt. They beat CCD, coffee world anyday and any other good cafe which is specialised for coffee atleast. I have had coffee at starbucks, people like us are  eagerly anticipating for starbucks to launch here at Kolkata,  quality of the coffee starbucks provides is good, but not worth enough with the money the take in return. I would ask people to support such local cafes, suggest them, criticize them here at zomato and help them progress.

The pizza tasted like Mio Amore pizza and the shakes tasted like shit.
. Even the whipped cream wasn't tasty
Absolutely disgusted and disappointed with their service also
We also took chicken burger even the burger tasted lower quality than mio more burger.
This restaurant is a zero value for money
Please do not go here to waste your money

It's a small place but is fairly well decorated and maintained.. ordered lamb chop sizzlers from the sizzler section and grilled fish with lemon sauce from the main course section. The sizzler barely had any meat..it was mainly bone that we chewed on. And the grilled fish wasn't anything fancy either. Heard a lot about this place but couldn't meet my expectations.

I have gone to blue mug with one of my friend. I was really satisfied with the food.
The quality, the taste and everything. 
The time we went it was little overcrowded But we got a place outside, in the garden . 
We had ordered steak which i found really delicious . The blue lagoon was one of the best drinks we had ever!
Its not cheap but it is quite affordable.

This Sunday I went to Blue Mug. I was really excited since I have heard great reviews about this place. And believe me I was not let down. This place located at Jodhpur Park is a beautiful cafe offering both indoor as well as outdoor dining serving a great variety of Continental and Mediterranean food. Quite reasonably priced the cafe has a really fast service and really courteous staff. We had Salsa Nachos with ham, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Penne Arrabiata with saucage, KitKat shake and Chocolate marvel pastry. The food was yum, quantity good for 2 people‚Äã. If you ever visit this place do order from their range of yummy shakes and smoothies or else you would simply miss out on the best part of the food. Overall I really enjoyed the experience. But on the down side I believe they need to work a bit more on their decor. The indoor is a bit clumsy and the outdoor part is not cozy enough nor well put together. Otherwise I was quite pleasantly surprised by this cafe.

A rather average cafe. The much hyped Oreo Shake is okayish. The Barbecue pizza was enough to serve just one person and it was indeed delectable. What felt soothing and took away the disappointment of the shake was the ambience on the windy drizzling evening. A soft tune played and it felt like coming from a distant corner. That was beautiful.

The place is easy to find using Maps. It has a great ambience and a really pretty decor, what with the kettle shaped lamps hanging from above and the bookshelf in the corner. It has outdoor seating too, perfect for winter afternoons.
We ordered the following:
1)Chicken Apricot Wings- absolutely loved this one. The wings were soft and juicy and the sauce was the perfect amount of sweet.
2)Chicken Caeser Salad- I've had better at other places, but it was good enough.
3)Chicken Alfredo Pasta-The pasta was quite tasty and creamy, but I felt that the sauce was a bit under-seasoned.

The food is light on the pocket and the prices in the menu are inclusive of taxes. However the service is disappointingly slow and the waiters are poorly informed about the content of the dishes.

Located at the heart of the city, you should really give this place a visit for it's simple and innovation decor and nice ambience. 
You're not likely to face any difficulty in locating the place either. 
Coming to the main thing, they serve quality food which isn't overpriced at all. 
There's a separate outdoor seating area for couples that gives you privacy. 
Overall it was a good experience.

The Chicken Apricot Wings are absolutely delicious. One should also try the BBQ pizza and not to forget the Oreo Shake and the Brownie Shake. The Shakes are one of the best I have ever had.

Yet another mouth watering restaurant is here in jodhpur park..

Interior (4/5): unique concept with tea kettles and soothing indoor outdoor combination with a pleasant music.. 

Food (5/5):  I bet u won't have a single complain about it.. The shakes are soon delicious that u wud feel like to make it a showpiece . And the grilled seafood sizzlers is the best choice to have.. And also the fish and chips.. 


Service (4/5) : the persons are quite well behaved and service is really quick in compare to other few restaurants in such area but mainly they push u to take few more items Whch is a bit annoying .. Otherwise it's good..


Overall I can say that u should once try this place and u would fall in love with the ambiance and food that u will definitely visit again..

We had also ordered apricot wings and a cold beverage chocolate monk which was also very good. They also have an outdoor seating area apart from the indoor one.

We had a great time yesterday. Luckily it was not very crowded and we had enough time to choose our meal. Firstly we ordered for Oreo Shake, KitKat Shake, Orange and Mango Mojito with Bruschetta. The shakes were good and so was the Orange Mojito. Later we ordered for Chicken Corden Blue, and chicken steak sizzler for the kids. Corden blue is a must try. All round the food was quite good. The kids also got some time to play the Piano. So all in all..great family time in a heart of south Kolkata. Keep it up guys .. will surely visit again!

We wanted to sit outside but it was full so we had to sit inside
we ordered:
Barbeque chicken pizza
chicken steak sizzler
brownie shake
chocolate cone
Pizza was good and cheesy
brownie shake and chocolate cone was lip smacking..
But i did not like the chicken steak sizzler much..It was average..

Rudyard Kipling surely didn't get his inspiration from Blue mug but it the first thing that comes to my mind as I write this review
I was wanting to go to this place for many Saturday evenings, but several moons saw me not getting my desired seats out in the open,  throes of people waiting
Finally, I did manage, after a relatively small endurance, food and staff lived upto my expectations. Chicken steak, fish and chips and shakes were delectable
The decor was tasteful and a mix of fun and elegance
Blue mug is amongst the favored Cafe diner; young and firang  alike. If u are pottering around over a weekend Blue Mug is the place u should definitely check in to
Rudyard Kipling would approve!

Coming to the food we ordered a Brownie shake,an Irish coffee, a barbeque chicken pizza and a bruschetta. Both the beverages were good with the Brownie being the standout. The pizza was filling and the bruschetta had great toppings. Overall we had a lovely experience and the open seating added a positive vibe.

Located in the heart of JodhpurPark, this extremely beautiful and homely cafe has managed to capture billions of hearts including mine. With great interiors comes brilliant visual satisfaction as the kettle shaped lights and that one gauitar in the corner catches all the attention. The outdoor has a very cute swing and is the perfect place to sit yourself down with their amazing arrays of coffees and hot chocolates on a warm winter afternoon/evening. Their meals are scrumptuos, not to mention extremely diverse. And they make sure they never leave their customers hungry even if they happen to order simple homestyle fries or fish fingers. The quantity is outstanding and the price is reasonable. Their mocktails, smoothies and shakes are to die for. Sizzlers and steaks are a bit underrated here which is why everyone should try out their continental side as well. Not too fond of their desserts though and neither do they come with a wide variety/range. If you're looking for some warmth and love on your plate, this place is a must visit.

Heard a lot about this place ...so finally went !!!
A typical, well decorated cafe with great ambiance and soft music .. a perfect place fr hangout

Now coming to the menu we ordered :
1. BBQ chicken burger : wouldn't say the best burger I ever had ...but it was definitely satisfying and tasty.. expected a bit more though
2 . Chicken mayonnaise grilled sandwich : this was probably the best of the 3 items we ordered ,to my surprise . The chicken was sufficient , soft and evenly spread
3. KitKat shake : I would have definitely given more than 4 rating if this was better... excessive cream took away the soothing effect of the shake ... otherwise it was nice ...but surely had better shakes in many other places.

Overall a nice experience and would definitely visit again to try other dishes .

Simply an overwhelming place for me. When I stepped into the cafe I was literally spellbound by the interior decoration. The place is small but so attractive, the place beside the airconditioned room attracted my attention , the swing there caught my eyes .

But the cafe is not situated in an easily locatable place .

I went there on the day of Durga Ashtami 2k17.The cafe provided with some packages. I chose the package of Rs 750. The package includes a Mocktail,a dish from "Appetizer" section, a dish from Main course section , a dish from Pizza/Pasta section , a dish from shakes/smoothies/ desserts section , of your own choice.
I chose Virgin Mojito from Mocktail section ; Crispy corn from Appetizer section ; Grilled Fish Sizzler from Main Course section ; Spaghetti Pasta from Pizza/ Pasta section , Brownie with ice cream from Shakes/ smoothies/ dessert section.
The taste of Virgin Mojito was very refreshing .
Loved the Crispy corn .
Being very honest Grilled Fish Sizzler was not up to the mark , that only dish was dissapointing according to me.
The Spaghetti Pasta was served with two pieces of toasts and that satisfied my papillae .
Though I ordered Brownie with Icecream , instead I was served with Brownie shake . The service-man apologized for the inconvinience , so I happily accepted the replaced dish. 
Irony is amongst all I loved Brownie Shake the most.
With some soft music as it's uniqueness the atmosphete is really cozy.
It's worth spending money here.

#Apricot Chicken Wingsüçó
One of their best appetizersüòãüòã It makes an excellent choice for savory dish. It is not overly sweet but I think the apricot sauce based on the chicken was the main ingredient for the sweetness and tartness.
# The Shakes-Oreo shake and Brownie shake
The creamy taste of these two shakes was divine. It was quite heavy but the first sip of those crumbled Oreos and the cold shake made me feel amazing. 

#Desserts-I've tried the Blueberry Mousse and the Choco Cone. The cream of the mousse was filled with blueberries. And a cake like layer appeared in the bottom which made the cream with the cake more delicious. My god! It was so tempting.  The choco cone was filled with Choco chips and layers of cakes were added in   between those heavy cream layers.  It was served cold and choco sprinkles were added in the top. 
 #Pizza-Pizza is always delicious.  I mean everybody loves pizza because of the cheese. It's all about the cheese that makes a pizza perfect. The pizza base was not thick. It was soft and the crumbled cheese made the pizza very cheesy. Green veggies were added with chicken. Additional peppers were given too.

I'd like to start off by saying just how PATHETIC their service is. I don't know if this is because of lack of training or because their food is so cheap, that they have indecent staff as well. They are definitely under-staffed. You should go here only if you have a LOT of time on your hands because your food will take (A LOT) of time. And if you dare to question the staff as to where your food is, you will be ignored. I would have rated you guys higher, but your service is appalling. Your waiters have this attitude as though they're doing us a favour by serving us. Really disgusting behavior!! 
Somewhat, the new kid on the bloc - located in the ever-so-confusing lanes of Jodhpur Park, this cafe is definitely pocket friendly, especially if you're on as student tight budget!
Getting straight into it, my favourite dish would be the Barbecue Chipotle chicken wings. Cooked in spicy chipotle sauce, this dish is absolutely mouthwatering! Comes with (soggy) french fries, and a joke in the name of a salad (a huge lettuce leaf, basically). But I wasn't quite disappointed with that, since the six, juicy pieces of chicken really did make for a good meal. 
Next on the list was a Ceaser salad. Honestly, I've had better ones. With barely any pieces of chicken and a bit too much of Mayonnaise (thereby defeating the healthy purpose of it), this dish is not something I'd go back for.
Next was Penne chicken pasta in Alfredo sauce. No complains for this one since it was cooked really well. If you're a cheese lover, this is THE dish for you. Definitely filing! 
Coming to the BBQ chicken pizza. Now, if you're a pizza lover, I suggest you don't order pizzas here, because they are not good. The BBQ chicken pizza was overtly sweet and base was crispy, probably because it was partially burnt. NOT MY CUP OF TEA. 
Next, the apricot chicken wings. This wasn't bad, especially if you like your savoury to be on the sweet side. But I prefer the chipotle wings.
Mexican fries with nothing mexican about it. These are your regular salt seasoned fries, to top it off, it comes with the horrible soggy-ness not the crisp, you expect in french fries, so that's a big no from me.
Coming to the drinks, I had a virgin Mojito which was basically sprite and mint leaves and dull-opes of sugar. Their oreo shake was really nice tho, especially if you love all things chocolate.
Dessert - I had a sizzling brownie, which was absolutely perfect. Not too dense with just the right amount of chocolate, this dish was really great.
I would have ordered a fish dish, but they serve basa, which doesn't sit quite well with me.

Im always going to update this review because our reasons to go to blue mug never run out! 
On our latest venture we tried the ham nachos, the onion rings, the snickers shake,  the brownie shake, the chocolate monk and the pesto cream spaghetti with Chicken. 
The nachos were different baked and soft but tasted great with the ham, the onion rings were perfect and fluffy. I personally feel their shakes could be a little less heavy because it takes a lot from the meal itself. There is an entire brownie on top of the brownie shake!! Should I be complaining? The pasta was amazing and the pesto cream sauce was perfectly balanced.

But the bacon that came with the all day breakfast was very chewy and rubbery in texture didn't like it that much. Wings sizzler was good. Overall would recommend everyone to try out this Cafe üòä

I had heard great feedback about this place and oh boy! This place is a gush if fresh air to the city of joy. A quaint cafe that is adorned with a cosy outdoor seating. We decided to seat ourselves there. The staff is probably one of the most attentive I have ever come across. They will not intrude but pay minute attention to smallest of details. 
The food is extremely economical and is great in terms of quantity and quality. The taste and presentation is top notch!
We ordered the chicken Caesar salad, mixed seafood platter and the peri peri chicken. All of them were perfectly cooked, brilliant sides, fresh and balanced in terms of seasonings, flavours.
This place has a long long way to go!
Can‚Äôt wait to visit again! Cheers!

The place is cute. Me and my pals ordered Club sandwich, periperi chicken, cottage cheese sizzler. Sizzler was good. Peri Peri chicken was spicy and perfect with the tangy sauce, fresh veggies,spicy rice with the chicken. Club sandwich was a sad case though. I orederd coffee, and it needs serious improvement. Espresso should at least appear in a demitasse. 
As about decorations, there's not much 'blueness'
 inside. That's my personal put off anyway.

The dishes are aptly priced in comparison to the quality and quantity served. Love their Prawn Mediterranean Salad, selection of soups, Stuffed mushrooms amongst others. Beverages include variety of teas and other mocktails. A definite recommendation when you are light on your budget but want a nice meal.

Blue mug was in my list for a long time and I hopped here with a lot of good expectations.It would be wrong to say it didn't fulfill my satisfaction but I really had a nagging experience with its staffs.I ordered A margarita pizza,followed by chicken Steak.On the dessert part I opted for a chocolate shake and a brownie with ice cream.It was mentioned repteadly to the staffs that,first serve the pizza followed by chicken steak.We would inform them beforehand for the dessert to be prepared and served.It was a small table for two.Pizza and Chicken steak were served together.There was hardly any space to keep any extra plates or even a spoon.Again we said,and reminded them we wanted one by one and requested them to serve dessert later.While My friend and I were struggling to finish both of these dishes within no time chocolate shake was served.We requested them to refrigerate it,after keeping for exactly 5 minutes,they compelled us to have it as the shake was melting.So we had to have pizza,chicken steak and chocolate shake with a time period of some 15 minutes.The most pathetic experience was there was no space keep plates.We had to eat on the same plate.Thankfully brownie was served as adviced.Coming to the ambience, it's a pretty place with cute kettle lamps.One can just sit there with a cup of coffee and read books.Food was no doubt good.I would have rated it a 4.But for the behaviour of the staffs, it's a 3 from my side.

This place is situated in Jodhpur Park serving continental & Italian dishes & also mention worthy mocktails & shakes.

AMBIENCE - This is a small cosy place, dimly lit beautifully decorated with painted kettles & liquor bottles hanging from the ceiling. It has a mocktail bar & also an outdoor seating section.

FOOD - This place has got good recognition very quick, one of the main reasons being the lip smacking taste of every dish served here, at an affordable price. Mention worthy dishes are Chicken Bbq pizza, Soy & Honey chicken, Chicken apricot wings, oreo shake. We were served complimentary chocolate waffles with ice cream, which was tasty enough.

SERVICE - Well behaved staff, helpful in choosing dishes. This place is always crowded, so one should expect a waiting time of 15-20mins.

POCKET PINCH - Its a pocket friendly place. 500 for two.

We ordered cranberry juice and a bbq chicken pizza as it was about 6.30 and we werent really hungry for a full fledged meal. The pizza was so so nothing special. What I really liked was the politeness of the staff, the decor ,ambience and the fact that you can sit indoors and outdoors. Really awesome would definitely return and sample the rest of the menu!!

Blue Mug is just the perfect place if you want to havr some quality time with your friends with some quality food. The decor is very sober and trendy specially the lights. They have both indoor and outdoor seating facility. We were there to celebrate one of our friend's birthday and the staffs are very friendly that they even played birthday song from their own. We had Chocolate Marble Pastry at first which was delicious. For starters we had Prawn Mediterranean Salad and Chicken Apricot Wings. The wings had wonderful flavour and the salad was also perfect. Then we took Chocolate KitKat Shake and Chocolate Oreo Shake...both were droolworthy and the presentation was so great. For the main course we had Chicken Steak, Fish Steak and Chicken Lasagne. Steaks were served with Sauted vegetables and herbed rice and the lasagne was cheesy and yummy. Quantity is good and everything was great. We had a wonderful experience.

When i had been here a month back with my friends, we had ordered the non veg lasagna,chicken wings and the bbq chicken pizza. All were very good.We had also ordered the KitKat Shake and the Oreo Shake. Both looked very good but according to me they were very creamy.I had also gone there yesterday when i tried to taste the veg food served here. Veg Steak Sizzler was very tasty. I did not like the Veg burger though. The patty given there had too much mashed potato in it. Mexican French Fries were great. I had Brownie with Ice cream  for desserts which was good but quantity served seemed very less.

I just loved being there. It's located very close to Jodhpur park police station And is just the place to spend a nice evening with friends and family.
The place has both outdoor and indoor sitting arrangements beautifully decorated with kettle hanging lights..books corner... Gives a different feeling all together. The counter s decorated more like we see in posh bars with hanging glasses ..so it was very impressive.
Coming to the food..we ordered chicken steak which was yummy pizza we ordered unfortunately was a thick crust but okaish.
Pinnacolada was a bit sweet so was the virgin mojito but it was good to the taste buds
So overall a place of must visit for the yum delicacies and very well behaved ppl.
Cheers to the blueug

Ambience- First look is eye captivating. They have indoor as well as outdoor seatings. Outdoor seatings are nice and cosy with small garden plantations around. The indoor one are decorated with lights in kettles hanging from above, a piano and guitar left for anyone to play.
Price and staff- price is very reasonable and staff are quite helpful.
Food- the menu offers standard cafe items with a long tea and coffee options. We took bacon sandwiches, grilled fish sizzler, chicken peri peri and chicken honey mustard. For drinks we had earl grey, ginger tulsi, darjeeling teas and coffee with ice cream.For dessert we took the blueberry mousse.
Pros- Sandwich was pretty good, tea and coffee s were made really nice. The blueberry mousse won our hearts.
Cons- Fish was too less in amount. The chicken dishes were too dry.
Recommendation- it was an average experience, would like to drop by if I'm near this area.

This is an excellent place to hangout. I visit this place quite often,although in the evening it stays crowded most of the time. You might have to wait a bit.

This cafe is having both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. All the staffs here are very friendly. And the best part is- the ambience and the decoration.
I'm totally impressed with the "brownie shake", it's quite delicious and a must try for those who haven't visited yet.
Coming to the food section, food is all right. But i personally would suggest it could have been a bit better. Although, this place is definitely amazing. Will be visiting very soon...

The After 8 Shake is amazing here. That freshness of mint combines smoothly with the chocolate shake.
The lamb ribs tasted awesome but the amount was too less compared to the pocket pinch.
That was compensated by quality and quantity of chicken lasagne.
The service is a slow here.

Owing to its growing popularity in the social media, I gave this place a shot last week. I've already much heard about its interior designing and when I actually visited I was simply awestruck. The hanging kettles, the rice lights inside bottles and the a rack full of story books caught my fancy. One can even visit this place alone, to spend some quality me-time. The little courtyard which gives you the opportunity to dine among the greens is a unique arrangement. The caf√© is small but very nicely conceptualised. 
However, talking about the food, it was not how I expected it to be. We ordered a bbq chicken pizza, a brushetta, a blue lagoon and a cold coffee with ice cream and onion rings. The pizza bread was too hard.   The brushetta was so-so. The onion rings were good though. Not too oily. But the drinks took my breathe away. They were served in tall glasses and were filled till the brim. One single glass is enough to satisfy your thirst. They tasted superb. 
The price is moderate and the service is not too slow. The washroom and the entire caf√© is very clean.

This is a nice place to hangout with friends over a cup of Tea or Coffee. The snacks items were also great in test. We have ordered French Fries, Crispy Corn and two Cappuccino. Coffee was good and so was Crispy Corn. I will definitely suggest Crispy Corn to my friends. 
I liked the interior design and ambience of this place.

This cafe is now quite popular, and the place is almost always full, even on weekday afternoons. 
But we were not at all happy with our experience.
 
We ordered, Chicken Salami Pizza and Brownie Shake. We wanted Kitkat Shake, which was not available, so opted for Brownie Shake. 
Both of them were quite ordinary. The only thing mentionable is the beautiful way they plate, specially the brownie shake. 
The decor is nice. They have an outdoor seating too which looks good.
The service was quite disappointing, they at first gave us a wrong bill and then took several minutes to correct it. They weren't even apologetic for their callousness or slow service. 

One of the most over-hyped places. If you are someone, who only goes by looks and decorations, then you will be happy with this cafe, or else go for other options.

Having read all the positive reviews regarding this place, finally decided to check out the Blue Mug.

The cafe has a relaxing ambiance to it, with a decor of quirky kettle lamps, bottle lights, walled pictures, attractive showpiece and a stack of fiction books to delight visitors, along with soft romantic Bollywood numbers playing in the background exuding a cosy vibe. One can also sit outside and enjoy the warm sunlight filtering in through the leaves, while gorging on their chicken steak sizzler or sipping some hot coffee.

The attendants are well-behaved and courteous. Service is good and fast. Only the beverages may take some time to be prepared fresh.

I opted for the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the popular Oreo Shake for myself. The pizza was good to taste, topped with enough cheese, sauce and chunks of chicken. The shake was absolutely divine, garnished with crunchy Oreo cookies, green grapes and a big red cherry on the middle, though I didn't much like the cream used as garnish on top.
They also provided roasted coffee beans for refreshment after the meal, along with the bill in a cute monkey-shaped chai glass holder.

A combination of tasteful pizza for a diehard pizza lover like me coupled with heavenly chocolate shake indeed made my day at Blue Mug. I would say I wasn't highly impressed considering all the hype about it, but my experience here was well nigh satisfactory.

The chicken salami pizza was too good and left me craving for more. The chicken penne pasta with creamy pesto sauce was good. The ambience is particularly nice. I would definitely come back to try a sizzler. My yardstick to measure a cafe is where I would feel comfortable enough to have a Nice and quiet cup of coffee with some fries. Preferably alone but that's not the point here! Anyway you get my drift.

Blue Mug is a quaint cafe located in the depths of Just put Park. We happened to chance upon it on Halloween night, dressed up, might I add!
The place is simply beautiful with amazing decorations which include a piano, guitar, and a stacked bookcase.
There's both indoor and outdoor seating, but we sat inside to avoid the chill.
We ordered an Oreo Shake, a Brownie Shake and a Margarita, and all the drinks were delicious and refreshing!
Next we ordered Chicken Nachos, and a Barbeque Pan Pizza, and both the dishes were lipsmacking!! A friend of mine took a m Chocolate Cone for dessert, and she said it was pretty good too!
I am definitely coming back again and trying out a variety of stuff next time. And I'd surely recommend this place for a chill evening add a sessions with friends and family!

It also has outdoor seating arrangements with a hanging swing. The interior is so pretty with kettles hanging from the rooftop, guitar and photo frames stuck on the wall augmenting the beauty of the place.
We had ordered chicken steak sizzler which came along with sauteed vegetables and finely prepared crunchy fresh fries, Margarita Pizza,

This place looks and serves the best quality food available at the given price. Hands down.. The best crispy chicken I have ever had! The cappuccino was better than most of the caf√©s in the City. The chicken steak was very filling..but lacked a bit of seasoning. The service needs special mention.. Prompt and very friendly. Enjoyed a lot! Would definitely visit again.

I have visited this restaurant quite a few times by now and this has become my favourite spot for hangout in the last few months. First of all they don't have their entire menu in zomato so one may not found many special dishes listed here. Second it is best to visit in the evening and if you are not too fond of ac then grab a chair (or luckily the hanging sofa) in the open area and you can feel the ambience along with the beautiful blue decor and slow instrumental music.
The staff behaviour is excellent here, they are very friendly and helpful. You can be there till 11:30 but your last order should be within 10:30. So they will ask you repeatedly if you have any more orders at 10:30 and that is actually nice because they dont want any customer to go unhappy.
Coming to the food we have tasted Chicken club sandwich, Bbq chicken pizza, chicken apricot wings. Chicken club sandwich is just wow. They will provide 2 double decker sandwiches cut in half (1layer with veggies and cheese and another layer with chicken dipped in mayo) and it will taste too good. The bbq chicken pizza is full of toppings and perfectly cheesy. The appricot chicken wings are spicy so I never took it again but it also tastes extremely good. Once we had cappuccino and cafe latte both double shot and both tasted awesome, they made it perfectly the way we wanted it to be (still you can add any amount of sugar you want). Last comes the desert and their speciality is Choco marvel pastry which tastes beyond imagination. It will be served with hot chocolate sauce. The chocolate cone and blueberry pastry is also good among the desert. Their black forest pastry is nothing extra ordinary. I am looking forward to taste lasagne, cordon bleau and shakes. They provide bill in small tea cups. All in all you can seat as long as you want and can have a wonderful time with smokes and tasty food.

This place is totally hyped. All that cozy comfy and picture perfect decors are just the catch. The place is small with minimal sitting arrangement. If one goes with a bunch of friends it will a real problem. Now coming to the food. I actually tried a lot of dishes as I heard so much about this place. But honestly it is not that great. Great will not be thr right word. The foods LOOKS good but doesn't TASTE good. It is not that you wilk crave for more. I didnot try the smoothies. May be the smoothies are good. But the sizzlers and the infamous honey mustard chicken is not at all worth it.

About the food, it is not that much good in tastes as it is said or maybe our choice of food went wrong. Moreover most of the deserts are not available (I experienced it twice). Price is not too low as per the quality.

With a very cozy ambience , quirky kettle lights on the ceiling , and a cute outdoor area, Blue Mug attracts you the moment you walk in. 
We had the chicken steak, the peri peri chicken , bruschetta, fondue and chocolate cone. 
The chicken steak - it was very well cooked , the pieces of chicken were mashed previously and blended with spices and then shaped into cutlet sized pieces and served with a tangy yet flavourful sauce. It was served with fries and boiled vegetables , and herb rice. What I liked about the rice was that it didn‚Äôt leave a greasy feeling after eating it. 
Peri peri chicken - two chicken breasts marinated with salt and pepper were served with herbed rice , boiled vegetables , fries and peri peri sauce. The peri peri sauce was very concentrated and was spicy and had a lot of sodium in it. Had they turned it into a runny sauce or add a creamy element into it , it would‚Äôve gone with the chicken well. 
The fondue - bite sized baguette pieces were served with a cheese fondue. The fondue seemed more like white sauce with lots of cheese in it. It somehow tasted sour too. 
Bruschetta - we were expecting tomatoes, basil and onions chopped and served on a baguette slice. But they had baked it with cheese , almost making it a pizza. Nevertheless , it tasted good. 
Chocolate cone - this was a unique dessert in the sense that it had layers of chocolate mousse and cake enclosed in a chocolate cone. It was difficult to eat with spoons so we used our hands. 
Blue mug also offers a variety of drinks , coffee and milkshakes. The prices are very reasonable and they make sure you have a hearty meal.

I visited this place for five to six times or may be more than that.I am not an active member of zomato. I was on zomato for long but i did not write any reviews till now. This one is my first post and of course first one is always special. So I choose Blue Mug because this one is my favourite place to hang out with friends. I am a die hard South Kolkatan and this place is very close to my house.
Located near Jhodpur park lake ,Blue mug is one of the must go-to cafes of south Kolkata.The decor is beautiful both indoor and outdoor. Specially the outdoor part is amazing for evening dates with your special person on a rainy day.
Coming to the food it's too good. As I visited this place many times with my friends,I tried a bunch of things here.Even I already forget some of the names.I tried apricot chicken wings and chicken lollipops which are really amazing. They are just wow. I must say after checked in to this cafe,this is the first thing you should order. The BBQ chicken pizza and chicken pasta are also good. The portions are enough for two. Coming to the shakes and mocktails they are just awesome both in taste and the presentation. I tried a lot among them blueberry smoothie and mango smoothie are my favourites. Fruit sangria is the most "paisa wasul" item here. Brownie and Oreo shake is almost same and nothing different. But I am little disappointed with pink panther. I really didn't like the taste. The most pretty thing about this cafe is they changed their way of presenting the beverages after a certain time which is quite interesting. I haven't tried the hot beverages but some of my friends tasted the Irish coffee and cappuccino and they are fully satisfied.
Lastly they service and the behavior of the employees are really good. Staffs are very sweet and well behaved.
I would definitely love to visit this place again and again because I am in love with this place already.
This place is just "beautiful" both in terms of food and ambience. This is the highly recommend for fellow foodies ! üíùüíù

Of late, many cafes have made their business booming. Blue Mug is one of them. It's a decent and cozy place and they maintain their basics. Winsomely decorated. Staffs are soft spoken,well mannered.
We dropped by pretty early . Just after 15 ,mins they had opened.
Ordered Chicken Club Sandwich and Virgin Mojito.
The club sandwich was very filling. And the Virgin Mojito was refreshing. We had a nice time there.

Conclusion: A quiet place to enjoy delightful food and chat over a drink. Rs 500-600 (for two) will be enough to have some evening fillers.

My wishlist cafe for a long time was this one. Went there yesterday. The route is a bit confusing for those who are going there by bus. We took the help from Google map. Now coming to the experience.

We ordered

Chicken BBQ pizza - This was good in taste and there was adequate chicken and toppings.

Chicken lasagna - This is a must try in this cafe. The flat noodles were covered with layers and layers of cheese. It was delicious !

Peri peri chicken - This is a very average dish. I didn't like the rice flavor, nor the dip they served. The chicken was a bit chewy. I'll suggest not to try this dish.

Brownie shake - This is again a very must try shake. The brownies were aweeeesssooome ! Also the shake was superb. It was full "paisa wasool".

Mango smoothie - This is not bad in taste and again not so good. People who are really into sweet flavours should try this, otherwise not. 

The food presentation specially the Brownie shake was too good. The food quality is also good. I just feel that this caf√© is a bit overpriced compared to the quantity they serve.

The waiters were well behaved. The size of the cafe is a bit small but it was cozy. All together it was a nice experience.

Presentation of the chocolate monk was very good and it was mouth watering. Recommended for the chocolate lovers .
Nachos with cheese and chicken was worth the penny. 
But chicken corden bleau stole my heart. It was so tasty and rich. That view of oozing butter was surely a treat for the eyes. If you ever visit this place please taste this cuisine.

This place became the talk of the town lately so I planned a coffee date with one of my oldest school and college friend on a sunny saturday.the location was very hard to find  initially because we thought it was situated at jodhpur park but it was just 5 minutes walk from dhakuria bus stop at the lane beside the petrol pump.. Anyway it was crowded even at 2 pm at noon but the stuffs were very friendly and asked us politely to wait in the outside sitting area.(yes they have one !!non-ac though but it has  that french open cafe type feelingsüòä) after a short while we got our place inside and ordered 1.capucchino,2. chocolate monk,3. plate of crispy corns.
4.French fries
5.Chicken sezzler steak
The cappuccino was good in consistency,the chocolate monk was overloading with kitkat,vanila cream and chocolate frappe,(too much chocolate is never too much)the crispy corn waa actually crispy and very and went so good with the cold and hot cafe.coming to the main course we ordered french fries and chicken sezzler stock now for that I have a few things to say.a hard core steak  lover i visited many famous semi famous continental eating out places ans tried steaks.many of the them claim to proVisw best steaks in the city but most of those turned out blant,chewy not tender and sometimes I felt i am eating just another sauce Cooke's piece of meat.but that's not the case here at all.i am superbly satisfied with both the quality and quantity of the steak.it was big and full of delicious stuffings which I never found anywhere else before,the meat was juicy and tender,veggies were well cooked..The sauce was thick and overall the dish was not too spicy at all.the decor ia very welcoming,it was well lit,small kettles hanging from roof is undoubtedly very innovative idea,the washroom was covered from normal weten with a a pretty separator with a nice landscape painted on it the blue mug painted on wall the wooden rail engine just shelved above the entrance all they made my mind wander yang it surely wants us to ho back to our childhood daya where a cup of haram chai from tin kettle made our gloomy afternoons ao special.this little place doesn't need any additional recognition and shoutout it is completely proving that they are here to stay and that's for a long long time.
Food 4.5/5(french fries were a little without salt that's why) decor 4/5
Stuffs 4/5

Have been there twice and have loved the place on both the ocassions. The first time we went we had chicken steak, burger and chicken sizzler and all of the dishes were very good and left us happy. On seeing that they also serve breakfast we went there for breakfast one day. While i ordered a breakfast platter, my husband settled with a sandwich. The breakfast platter is an assortment of bacon, grilled tomato, hash brown, omlette and very filling. The oreo shake which my husband called for was good but a little too sweet for me (given the fact that i do not have a sweet tooth at all)

Recently visited this cafe for a evening snack..I would say it has a feel good ambience with soothing music playing in background.. coming to the food we ordered chilli paneer pizza and chicken lasgne. Pizza had a good amount of stuffing with a lot of cheesy effect..it tasted really good..only the crust was too thick..I prefer thin crust pizza more. On the other hand lasgne tasted awesome.. people should try this dish with prompt service. As a whole this cafe serves quality and pocket friendly dishes.

This is a great little cafe located near south city mall. The place was fully packed when we got there. After 10mins of wait time, we got to enter the place . Although we didn‚Äôt get the outside seats, but hey we are not complaining because the ambience was great inside too. They have a wide range of varieties in the menu, specially the drinks. We ordered four of them and all of them were delicious. In the starters, chicken nachos was so great that we finished it in about 5mins. We ordered four types of main course, and each one of them was great and big in quantity.
Lastly, the service was quite good and prompt and the prices are quite affordable. I would recommend this cafe to everyone.

Blue Mug is an amazing place located in Jodhpur Park,it's ambience will give you immense pleasure.Visited this place with my friends in the eve of Diwali.

In starter,we ordered Apricot Chicken Wings as suggested by one of my friend,it was amazingly tasty,lipsmacking dish,highly recommended of them.

Grilled Fish Sizzlers was enjoyable in Main Course.Chicken Steak was another recommended item of them,it was heavenly tasty and tantalizing.Peri Peri Chicken was delicious and divine.

In drinks,Virgin Mojito was a refreshing one.

Management is well behaved but service is little slow,may be due to the diwali rushes.They also accept paytm.The overall food quality was excellent.A recommended one.

This restaurant is stealing everyones soul in the city. And it deserves the reputation as well. The place is cozy and the decor is very welcoming. The food is top notch and it's price is very reasonable as well. 
For beverage I took the recommended CHOCOLATE MONK- it was served with four pieces of KitKat on top of soft cream.  It was smooth and and tasted really good. 
For starters I took the CHICKEN AND CHEESE NACHOS- this was crispy and filled with cheese and chicken so nothing can go wrong with the dish!
Coming to the main course. I took the CHICKEN CORDON BLEU- this is probably one of the most best dishes I have ever tasted. On cutting open the chicken, butter and cheese was oozing out and was an absolute delight to the eyes. It was served along with French Fries and salad. This is a highly recommended dish and absolutely necessary for whoever visits this restaurant. 
I gave a 4.5 because I think the service could have improved. 
Everyone should give a visit to this eatery because it will be worth it.

A great cafe located near jodhpur park. The corner location along with the blue light storefront makes the cafe very noticeable. It was indoor as well as outdoor seating and a cosy ambiance . Innovative lighting ideas and great staff. The food is pretty good with lots of options including sizzlers and sandwiches. There are quite a few options for mocktails and they look and taste equally well. The chocolate beverages looked heavenly( the one i had tasted great too). The place is usually crowded during weekend evenings.

I had gone to this place during the Durga Puja..we didn't get a seat inside..so we sat in the outside area which was equally beautiful..the decor and ambience were pretty good..I had wanted to try the chicken lasagne and that was my only reason to go there..but they had changed the menu to a special one for the Pujas..so we ordered a combo..which consisted of a drink (Virgin Mojito), Chipotle chicken wings sizzler, Spaghetti Alfredo, and a Black Forest pastry..the food was really good.. the pastry was not up to the mark.. but the mojito, the sizzler and the chicken wings were absolutely amazing.. I highly recommend this place..the waiters were very polite and the service was prompt..I would love to go back..

It was during Ashtami that we visited and hence the usual menu didn't apply. There were combo offers. 2 sets. One for ‚Çπ600 and other for ‚Çπ700. We chose two combos for a group of 5 people. We took 2 drinks- Oreo shake and Kitkat shake. Both were kind of similar but up to the mark. We took 2 sizzlers. Lamb and bbq chicken steak sizzler. For starters, we had crispy bbq wings which were really good. The  sizzlers where served hot and cooked just right. The main course, we had a steak which was juicy and tender. For desert we ordered the black forest cake and brownie with vanilla icecream. However the latter was not available, and we had to switch. The cake was good, but the slice was small. Overall the ambience was great. The decor very homely. The waiters were polite and the service was prompt.

A real nice cafe! The cafe culture of Kolkata has improved to a great extent since last couple of years. Blue Mug is a good example of that. Call me biased, but I have tendency to judge a cafe on how good they make first flush tea and black coffee. Well, Blue Mug serves amazing Darjeeling First Flush and a decent black coffee. They serve some nice appetisers too. A great place to spend your evening with a dear friend or two. 
P. S. Nice outdoor seating arrangements are available to make some chai-sutta memories.

Blue Mug is a praise worthy cafe located at a lane near Jodhpur Park Bazar. The interior decor is quiet soothing where the dining hall is adorned with led lights and framed pictures creating an environment ideal for chill out with a very comfy seating arrangement. 
Coming to food it's too good. The hot beverages we took included lemongrass tea which was very smooth with a delectable flavor. The Irish Coffe was ideally brewed with it's signature strong flavor.  
We intended to order Chicken Cordon bleu  but as it was unavailable so we ordered Chicken BBQ Wings Sizzler  and penne pasta with pesto sauce which were amazing. In desert section the Brownie with ice cream was toothsome while the Blueberry Mousse and Kulfi Shake stole the show. The pocket pinch was reasonable as it aptly satiates the gluttony cravings with flying colour.  Service was above the par as the service staffs were polite and very co operating. 

Overall a big thumbs up to Blue Mug and highly recommended for fellow foodies.

While shuffling through Facebook and Instagram I'd always stumbled onto posts where people have posted being in this place. 
Curiosity got the best of me and I dragged my friend down here on Oshthomi. After kicking our heels for almost 2 hours we finally managed to snag a place in the garden area. It was beautifully set up. Quaint caf√©, making use of every nook and corner with good music and lively ambiance. 
Hosts were extraordinarily helpful. The menu was cleverly set up, with combos ranging for different pockets including a four course meal. 
The barbecue pizza was gobbled up along with the apicot wings in an instant. Finally the infamous oreo shake and delicious blackberry pastry were polished off with wide grins and satisfied tummies. 
Overall, we did leave contented and planning our next visit.

One of the most overrated places in city.. This Cafe got renowned at bit too fast after its opening.. Located nearby the Jodhpur Park lake this place looks small but still has a good number holding capacity. It has both outdoor and indoor seating. Outdoor seating feels like one's own garden as it is well planted. Indoor is a bit shabby and kind of congested. Talking about food.. The food presentation is too good.. Like only by seeing the presentation, level of taste expectation increases upto greater bars.. But unfortunately your tongue won't be  completely satisfied.. I have been here twice..Tried the Margherita pizza which did not taste good at all.. The base wasn't appropriately cooked and it was no better than a home cooked pizza. Chicken lasagne was on the good side. It was filling and extremely cheesy, so cheese lovers this one's a must try. The orange mojito was undoubtedly the best one tasted till date. Pink panther was both good at presentation and taste. After 8 was a good choice for the eyes.. Served in tall glass..it looked delicious but it was good at the beginning and by the end it tasted too much chocolaty. In desert i have tried the blueberry moose.. And it was pathetic..pls don't try that.. As stated earlier.. This Resturant is overhyped.. Good for small and short get-togethers but not satisfactory. Pocket pinch is medium..but not worthy as of from my experience.

Location: near jodhpur park boys school!It is a regular cafe with regular dishes and shakes and drinks. It is a chai kettle and mug themed place.

Had been hearing a lot about this place so decided to pay a visit but the moment I enetered I was disappointed with the set up, space and decor. For me it was very regular and not innovative whereas mst cafes are innovative with their set up and decor. The space was small, with an indoor setting as well as a outdoor one(which can hardly be called so). The space was small and it was overloaded with stuff so felt clumsy inside.

The kitkat and oreo shakes were really great but the fish finger we ordered seemed to have stale fish so again a let down.

Price is standard as per the current cafe levels.

Salad was pretty okay (3/5), pizza quite good (4.5/5) and sizzler (4/5) also quite good. For dessert we had the places's famous Oreo shake (4/5) which was too ample for two people. Quantity compared to price is very good here. Good food with great staff and good ambience gives it 4/5.

Squally vivers!

What if you are in mood to gobble up everything you desire? Or what if the vault of heaven has opened the Blue to Mug it up totally? Naturally, you will seize the moment . And that's what I did. It was raining heavily with huge squalls all around. Therefore, brewed to visit some cosy place to intensify my mood even more. Thus, called a sister of mine to accompany me in this escapade. And chose Blue Mug as our dock.

Ambience and the decoration was fabulous. Though we were two, however, they greeted us with huge couch. And as I couldn't hang fire so ordered quick for one Oreo shake, and it ain't only look great, but also extraordinary in taste; one single shot cappuccino, and it tasted really real. Besides, what stole the soul was Chicken Cordon Bleu. Don't have enough lexicons to describe it, cause other than words you gotta feel it when it melts in your mouth with its extra cheese inside, outside and everywhere of it. Hope you got me now. Unbelievably lucious. It was though served with french fries and a bit vegetable salad. Nevertheless I just couldn't stop myself to express it more. 

You have to go for it guys. It's beautiful by looks, by service and lucious by food.

Thanks for reading.

Visited this nice cafe yesterday with couple of friends and I must say that it was a lovely experience. The place has an outdoor seating covered in green shade and we chose to sit there. The menu has a nice mix of Italian and continental and the price range is value for money. We ordered for a grilled fish in lemon sauce, chicken stroganoff and bbq chicken pizza for mains. For drinks, we chose to have the good old fresh lime soda. The fresh lime came in a big glass and was enough for us to have a hard time finishing it. While we enjoyed the stroganoff and grilled fish a lot, the pizza was a slight disappointment ( we expected them to serve thin crust with adequate‚Äã topping). The reception is nice and the atmosphere is cordial. I think if you chose to visit this place, try their Oreo shake too, it's splendid.

One of the best caf√©s in Kolkata if you have a craving for shakes! I ordered the brownie shake as well as the KitKat shake. If you have a tooth for chocolate,  I'd ask you to go for the brownie shake as it's tastier and got a more smooth consistency than kitkat (or even the oreo shake).
I also ordered the chicken bbq pizza. It was pretty good. So if you want to skip the shakes, you can definitely try the pizza section(although the veg section fails to impress). Also, being a dessert person, I was disappointed with the blueberry pastry. It was dry and for the price they charged, they could have made it at par with the best cakeries in the city.
The ambience gets an extra star for itself as it's very quaint and serene and a perfect place to hangout with your friends. I loved their outdoor seating space!

Had been there on a busy afternoon and looked like a fancy decor place. The dishes were reasonably priced and tasted well but nothing extra ordinary. Also, it gets little suffocating if too crowded. Service took a little time but overall I'd say, it's a good next door kind of place where one can relax and catch up with friends over a drink or two.

A beautifully decorated place with both indoor and outdoor seating is a popular choice of the young crowd. The place serves a moderately priced array of food which are decently sized. The Nachos was served with a fresh tangy salsa and the BBQ Chicken Pizza had a thin crust and its chicken topping had good flavour. However, I found that the spread of beverages they have (some of which were priced quite high) are not served in proportion to their pricing. I was disappointed on having had a tall glass of Virgin Mojito with the major part of it filled only with ice cubes -there wasn't much value for price. Looking forward to trying their sizzlers the next time

I had heard a lot about it since its existence. My bunch of friends keep visiting this place too often. 
Well i was kinda compelled to try this out.
The decor is just so good , it will make you fall in love with this place. 
Stationed at jodhpur park,jadavpur. The location is also very apt and accessible for the visitors to land up here.
Well we tried out a bunch here. 
Chicken Steak sizzler, Lamb Lasagne, Mexican French Fries, Chicken lollipop, Fish Finger, Brownie Shake.
The commendable ones here are the dessert and the lasagne. I definitely recommend these sections here. 
The rest were okay for me. Though i expected a little better with the poultry dishes it didnt kinda impress me to a great extent as much as i heard about this joint. 
I would definitely ask you to land up to this place if you have a dessert loving bunch of buddies looking to spend some good time.

The first time I came here I was stared at by the waiters for being a young girl who was there on her own. They took turns staring and chatting about me and did not serve me properly so I left. The second time, the food was extremely underwhelming. The place is full of flies, half the things on the menu are not available and the staff make you feel so uncomfortable.

This place has been on my To-Do bucket list for quite sometime. So today finally I had the chance to visit it. This place is a perfect amalgamation of the fact of good food to set the right mood with the pocket pinch being economic. Located in the heart of Jodhpur Park, this place offers both indoor and outdoor seating options.
The interiors have been done to suit the name and thus makes the place cosy.
Moving on to the food and beverage - since we weren't really hungry so not that we could try much on the list. Amongst the shakes, we had the KitKat Shake and Cold Coffee with Caramel Syrup. The latter was just about ok as the coffee was good but the topping of cream wasn't that appealing. The KitKat shake was absolutely well done. We had ordered Crispy Fried Prawns with Prawn Dip. The portion was quite good as they offered 8 pieces but the dip was that of Sweet Chilli Sauce (which I wasn't expecting. Prawn dip had given me some other idea).
Nonetheless this is a place for youngsters to hang around!!!

We went during the pujas, there was a special menu and all. We got the best seat in the house - the swing one! <3 But that's about where the specialty ended for us. We ordered a ton of things - a pizza, a pasta, an oreo shake, a brownie shake, two scoops of ice creams - one vanilla, one chocolate, etc. The food failed to impress us - though the pasta was still better of the lot. The oreo shake and the brownie shake tasted exactly the same, only the toppings were different. Also, both of them tasted like a chilled chocolate health drink, nothing more. The most shocking part is that for the first time in my life, I couldn't finish the vanilla ice cream! Vanilla is my all time favourite ice cream flavour but I cringed as soon as I had the first taste! It was powdery and tasted like anything but ice cream! The chocolate was better.However, on giving them feedback about how we were disappointed with the quality of the food, they apologised and gave us a red velvet chocolate pastry on the house which was delicious! The 0.5 of the 2.5 is for this alone.

Located near Jodhpur Park, Blue Mug is one of the must go-to cafes in Kolkata. The place presents a wonderful blend of excellent food at economic prices. The cafe offers both indoor seating in a modern, artistic and well-decorated cafe/studio setting, as well as outdoor seating, surrounded by well kept lush greenery. For music lovers, it also offers a guitar and a synthesizer which enthusiasts are allowed to play themselves (A/N: they had me in love because of the guitar). We sat inside and the ambience was simply beautiful, with artistic lights hanging from the ceiling, the tasteful interior deco, and the quirky tea-pot light over each table. The waiters were very polite and helpful, however the service has some room for improvement. We ordered Chicken Lasagna, a chipotle bbq wings sizzler and a brownie shake, with instructions to bring out the shake last. In fact, they themselves suggested for the dessert to be brought out later (and i would've definitely rated 5 stars if the serving was flawless), but after waiting quite sometime without food (enough to make me consider asking what's taking so long; and trust me, i'm patient), we were served the shake first; then after sometime, the lasagna; and even some few minutes later, the sizzler. However, what absolutely makes up for all of that was the taste! And my God was it delicious! All of it teased our tastebuds in the most wondrous ways. I recommend the Lasagna to everyone who visits, it's one of the best you'll find in Kolkata and is guaranteed to satiate the cheese monster in you. The quantity is really good for all items for that price as well. Also, if you visit three or four times, they do notice you and are extra warm with you, which is an added bonus to revisit. Overall good experience and definitely recommended for all.

Visited this place during Puja's..the ambience was very good but had to wait for a long time..the items ordered were-
Apricot chicken wings-a bit sweet ,garlicky flavour but too good in taste
Oreo shake-presentation was simply fantastic and taste was good
Black Forest cake-which had all the cherry filling in between the layers
Grilled fish- with the lemon butter sauce was awesome but the quantity of rice should be more for 1 person

After hearing a lot about the place finally me and my partner with our friends visited the place. The ambience actually justified the name. It had every essence that a cafe should have. We got ourselves a table and asked for the menu. But the thing that was disappointing us from the very beginning was the service. We decided the menu but had to wait for at least 15 minutes for someday to write the order. After ordering we waited for around 45 minutes and then the food was served one by one. The double cheese chicken sandwich tasted good but wasn't more delicious than the bacon sandwich. The bacon tasted really well. The chicken sizzler looked like a sizzler indeed with all the smoke but didn't taste well. The chicken wasn't well boiled. The double cheese pizza and pasta in white sauce were amazing. The Oreo shake and Choco marvel pastry were the best of the lot. The food was overall good but the only drawback was the service. Since the place is small maybe that's the reason for the delay in service. 
It was overall a good experience.

This review is strictly based on the drinks we had here.. as we did not try the food. Went during Durga Puja..it was crowded but managed to get a seat. It has both indoor and outdoor setting and i quite liked the ambience. Ordered virgin mojito , cafe latte, cafe mocha. Virgin mojito was very refreshing. Loved it. My friends also liked their coffee. Pricing is at par with other cafes in Kolkata.

A hidden gem of Jodhpur Park! I visited this place a couple of months back. The ambience and decor are attractive.. The kettle shaped lampshades were eye-catching. We were a group of 8 people and chose the indoor seating area as it was raining outside.
We ordered :
1. Chicken Steak Sizzler (230/-)
2. Spaghetti Pasta (Chicken with white sauce) (200/-)
3.BBQ Chicken Pizza (170/-)
4. Margarita Pizza (160/-)
5. Chocolate Cone (55/-)
We just loved the dishes.. Though my personal favourite was the Spaghetti Pasta. It was so creamy and cheesy with awesome flavour. Pizzas were also soft, fresh and tasty. The only cons I found is the location. Or else it's a nice place for hanging out.‚ù§Ô∏è

I visited this place during durga puja. Exactly located at jodhpur park. Coming to the services and ambience.
The ambience was different and beautiful, both indoor seating and outdoor seating is available here. Coming to their services now - it was equally good, they managed the crowd nicely , helped the visitors in choosing the best food.
When we visited the place thete were only combos available. 
We took the combo for 1 appetizer, 1 pizza/pasta/sizzler, 1 main course 1 dtinks and 1 desert.
Overall I loved this place and will visit again. :)

Located near jodhpur park, this place is a gem indeed.

Decor: Brightly lit and innovative lampshades. Has outdoor seating which is good for groups inclined to smoking. Also has a synthesizer. The mocktail counter is great fun to watch. 

Staff: Polite and knows what they serve. Can suggest you accordingly.

Food: This is the best part of the place. We had ordered chicken sizzler, lamb past an white sauce, chicken wings, brownie shake and all of them were lip smacking delicious. Quality and quantity top notch. The shakes provide a visual delight.

Overall: A must visit place, easy on the pocket. A huge thumbs up.

FINAL VERDICT- One may give this place a try, but I did not find it to be anything out of the ordinary.

Went there yesterday with my partner and just loved the place! The interior is so beautifully decorated, the food is also good, the staff is very courteous, they managed to give us a table early even though the place was quite crowded! We ordered a pujo special combo in which we took, cheese fish fry as appetizer, it was delicious along with the mayo dip and ample amount of French fries, then came the chicken steak sizzler which was more or less okay in taste! Lastly came the kitkat shake and chocolate cone! The shake was very beautifully presented but the kitkat bars tasted a bit stale, the shake was amazing, though, the chocolate cone was again quite delectable!

The only reason why I'm not giving it 5stars is that when the sizzler arrives, the place becomes a bit stuffy with all the smoke, so I felt quite uneasy! Would love to visit there again!

Location: Jodhpur Park

After hearing a lot about this place over the past few months we finally decided to give this place a visit.

Ambience and Deƒáor: The ambience is nice and the place is divided into two parts the inner seating which is air conditioned and the outdoor seating which is open,the deƒáor of the inner part is neat and I liked it whereas the outdoor seating is also good,the place is simple with some comfortable chairs and a swing.We decided to sit outside as the weather was not too hot.

Food and Beverages:

Oreo Shake: The oreo shake looked amazing,beautifully served.The taste of the shake was also alright but I felt the cream in it could have been better otherwise it was good

Cheese Fondue: The perfect appetizer,warm cheese served with bits of bread.The cheese was really flavourful and the bread crisp.I loved it.

Chicken Steak: The chicken steak tasted very good,the chicken was flavourful and soft.It was served with a side of rice,veggies and fries which made it quite filling.


Service: 

The service was good but a little slow but the food turned out to be good so that did not cause a huge problem and the staff are friendly and courteous.

Verdict:

The pocket pinch was moderate,the place is reasonably priced.

A good place serving good food. Recommended.

This is a beautiful cafe in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park. It remains mostly crowded. We were lucky to find a seat without much wait on my two visits to this place. I loved the ambience, both the interior as well as the outer seating. 

The menu has a good variety, and the pricing is quite cheap. The Club Sandwich was well done, and the quantity at that price is really commendable. 

The BBQ Chicken Pizza turned out be my favourite on my first visit. It was loaded with chicken, veggies and lots of cheese. However, I found the crust slightly burnt on my second visit. 

I also liked the Blueberry Pastry. The texture was good, with a proper balance of sweetness. 

Overall, a good place to visit to chill with your friends over some delicious finger food at affordable rates.

They need to work on their dishes individually. We had also ordered a lasagna, that I couldn't provide a photograph of, here. 
The lasagna was the best main course item on the menu for me. It was slightly overcooked but then it was tasty. Presentation could've been better. 8/10
KitKat shake was above average. The drink being very creamy and delightful when one starts off but ending with chocolate milk, resembling cold Bournvita in the end. Same goes for Oreo Shake. In preference, KitKat Shake had the right amount of sweetness, not too overpowering. 7/10
The chicken cheese pizza had tasty toppings but the dough reminded me of the pizza served in Mio Amore, thick, undercooked and too chewy. The toppings on the pizza were perfect though. 7/10
The chicken lollipops need to be renamed on the menu so that the customers don't get confused otherwise as they come drizzled with marination. Undercooked, but otherwise tasty. 6/10.

The ambience itself is attractive enough to lure you into the cafe. One of the most popular cafes in South Kolkata, this place is a must visit for all the foodies. If you need a place just to sit and sip coffee or read your book, just step in this cafe or set yourself up at the table outside adjacent to the cafe. 
Cottage Cheese Garlic Sizzler and Chilly Paneer Pizza were my favorites. I would also suggest to try the Cheese Fondue and Nachos.
We were charmed by the elaborate variety of Shakes, Mocktails, Juices and Desserts. I would strongly recommend to try KitKat Shake and Oreo Shake. You may like the Fruit Sangria from the Mocktails section. Enough said, even while writing this review and recollection of my experience is urging me to visit this place once again.

Chaturthi night spent well and thanks to this lovely place...

Went here last night at around 9:45pm and it was packed.. what I loved was that the outdoor area was all empty and we sat there.. a perfect place for a cozy dinner or even if u want to hangout with your gang away from any noise.. 

P.S. Ofcourse there is no AC in this zone.

Ordered normal coke.. cheese fondue and chipotle bbq chicken wings sizzler... 

Food- Absolutely fine.. 

Ambience- The best part of my whole experience..

Service and staff- Very sweet and well behaved...

I am absolutely in love with this place.. recommended out and out... go for a date guys.. and I would suggest u take that space outside! üòçüòçüòç

This place was in my list since long, because good review and picture. But it was literally disappointment . Ambience was decent and staff was good enough. 
But when it comes to food it was very sad, we ordered 4-5 main course. 
1. Pesto sauce pasta was garnished with cabbage , it was pesto sauce though. 
2. Sizzlers were without rice or noddles, you get big one tikki with very small portion of veggies. 
3 . Salad , lettuce was not fresh, it was weird in taste. 
4. Then we ordered Mexican rice, which was served with some white creamy sauce and same salad. Rice with creamy sauce.. ewww..
As the name suggest blue mug ,I ordered blueberry shake what I got in return was blueberry smoothie, which was just ok. Mock tails were just average. So in total it was dull experience.

This place isn't as good as the LBB article mentions, but it's not half bad at all. It's a small, cute restaurant hidden in the lanes of Jadavpur, and it's perfect for a quite, peaceful dinner or coffee.
The shakes are sumptuous and food is just good. Service is pretty fast. The lighting from the mugs they hang is possibly the best thing in there. Pocket friendly too. I'd recommend this place to people who want to have a casual time and good conversations.

Well, I suppose Blue Mug doesn't feature in Zomato's hidden gems but it is indeed a precious gem hidden in the the unexplored alleys of Jodhpur Park. I have tried the Fish Finger with tarter sauce, Crispy Prawn, Margarita Pizza, the Cheese Fried Fish but yet to try their sizzler which happens to be their speciality.The dishes were as luscious as it can get. Each of them will make you crave for more, and make you repent once everything on your plate is exhausted. Evident from the rating that the decor, ambience & their service makes the money in your pockets worth spending. A perfect destination for the gathering of friends. A must must visit for all the foodies. It may take little time & your effort to find it for the first time, but Blue Mug is worth it!

The place isn't hard to locate. It's walking distance from South city mall. The cafe is lightly decorated with neatly laiden plates forks and knives in front of you. They have wide range of drinks and they are delicious. I have tried Brownie shake and Oreo shake..the nice presentation of the drinks make you really happy. My stomach was half full merely having an entire drink. For starters I tried cheese fish cube,and trust me it's delicious. For main course Chicken Steak was ordered. Now that was where I was a bit disappointed. The chicken was hard,rice had no flavour,veggies were merely boiled and only the steak stuffing tasted good. Other than the final dish rest were very satisfactory. I liked the place and would definitely visit again.

The best cafe I have visited till date.  Blue mug is a sensation not only in jodhpur Park but in whole of South Kolkata. It is located on one of the bylanes of jodhpur Park, the place being known for both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. It was so hot and sultry outside and after a long tired day we opted for the indoor ones. We ordered chicken club Sandwich, French fries. Among the drinks my friend like it hot so he ordered for a cafe mocha while I was happy with strawberry shake. Cafe mocha was quite good as what my friend said and the shake was just upto the mark. 10/10  for the decoration and the presentation.  This was given in a particular long glass jar with ample  of cream cheese alongside. The service comes a little bit late as we nearly had to wait for 30 minutes to get a shake and inspite of telling them repeatedly to give us the shake the other waiters has little knowledge and gave us the food firstüôÅüôÅ. Nonetheless when it comes to so yummy and delicious food one can wait and definitely those little things can be avoided. üòÑ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä

Wish to go here sometime sooner and try out  the other menus.  The staff is also courteous and service is good.  Overall, it's pocket friendly too.

Blue mug reminded me of the phrase "Monday blues".
Yes I am extremely disappointed to say this but it's unavoidable.
The place is overhyped. Don't know why as I found nothing extraordinary here in compared to its popularity.
Decor is nice and neat with a touch of blue colour everywhere.
It also has a space outside to breathe fresh air while indulging in savouries.
Not so spacious but that's okay.
What I didn't like is the food.
Have never had such dull experience with Barbeque pizza and Chicken Lollipops.
Who serve pizzas without thin crust these days? Even if they do, it should be good at least. 
Lollipops looked amazing. Wish it tasted equally good!
Never knew even a chocolate drink could be a turn off. üòë
It looked so damn pretty but it doesn't taste good as it looks.
Sigh!
Service is quite slow although the staff was friendly and approachable.

P.S. Think twice before ordering your food.

A cute little cafe.. perfect for spending the afternoon with your loved ones. It really has become popular as even on weekdays the indoor sitting area was full,so we sat outside,which was nice n cozy too The ambience is it's plus point.
Coming to the food..we ordered Lamb chap sizzler, Chicken Bbq Burger and Kitkat shake. While the first two dishes were good..the latter was just out of the world.I could visit this place again and again only for that kitkat shake.
The service was good. Price was reasonable.
Overall a good experience. Would love to visit again. :)

A fine day to dine it was, made finer by the ambience of the blue mug. Needed to smoke, so sat outside at the open air tables. Well, technically I sat on a swing that hung beside the table üñ§.. Lasagne was Good, Mexican bowl was great, Oreo smoothie and the solid chocolate cone was even better. But the real legendary item to check out here is the blueberry smoothie. It tastes as good as it looks, trust me. A fine dine.

One of those places which a unique charm of its own. As you enter, the smell of pastries sitting inside the display refrigerator just beside the entrance draws your attention followed by the smell of coffee enchanting you and making you crave for it. 
This cafe has been open for a while now and it still has not let any of its customers down. You get to choose between sitting inside or outside. The one thing i liked most about the outside sitting was that the side facing the streets is completely covered by plants so that you get fresh air and the passers by cant spot you or the food you are having.
Coming to the food, I had ordered mexican cheese nachos and a fruit sangria. The nachos were brilliant with a spread of mexican sauce and kidney beans and cheese on top of it. The sangria had all sorts of fresh fruits in it and tasted really refreshing and different. 
Overall it was a great experience and I wont probably be able to say no to this place next time onwards.

After reading a lot of good reviews on zomato, we decided to try this place out. The ambience was great with live piano being played. On a Saturday afternoon it was bustling with young crowd. We tried out their crispy fried prawn, fish and chips and blue lagoon. Though not over the top, but they were good. Service was prompt. Also did not punch a hole in our pockets. üòä

Blue mug was on my wishlist for a long time! Finally visited this cafe today after so many recommendations but the place failed to impress me. We were greated nicely on entering but we're offered a seat rather sofa which was very uncomfortable. We ordered apricot chicken wings, chicken spaghetti pasta in red sauce and  chicken cordon blue. The wings tasted good as well as cordon blue had a nice taste with molten butter inside it. The pasta was bland and we regretted having ordered that. For beverage we took one brownie shake which was well decorated but tasted like bournvita with milk. The oreo milkshake tasted better than this. Overall an okayish experience for one time visit.

I have wanted to be here from a long time. And at last it happened. And it was amazing. We ordered a bunch of things as listed below:

Single shot expresso: A perfect shot if you ask me. Strong as it should be.

Irish coffee: This one looked unique. The bi coloured drink looked pretty cool. The coffee floating above and transparent fluid below. Taste was strong but with few sugar packets it was nice too.

Cappuccino: The classic one. Tasted classic too.

Mexican french fries: Now this dude requires mentioning. Simply sexy. The quantity of fries as well as the taste both amazed me. The crispiness was perfect to the T.

BBQ chicken pizza: The cheese and meat were in ample. And the green and red peppers complimented well too. All in all a great pizza to try.

Chicken steak: A very well cooked steak coated with a perfectly flavoured sauce. Also french fries, sauted vegetables and herb rice provides a complete meal to you.

Chicken steak sizzler: The sizzler version of the chicken steak and equivalently tasty.

Honey mustard chicken: A nice and unique mixture of flavours. The sweetness of honey and the strong flavour of mustard really makes you want more.

Peri peri chicken: One of my favourite chicken items of the day. I have never had such delicious peri peri chicken.

Oreo shake: The recommended was as recommended should be. Yummylicious! Aaah! It looked as pretty as it tasted.

Brownie shake: Something similar to the Oreo shake where the Oreos were replaced by chocolaty brownies. I personally liked the previous one better.

Masala cold drink: If you want a soft drink with a lil twist you can even try this.

Overall an amazing experience. Thank you Blue Mug for this wonderful experience.

It was a lunch out with a friend and my first visit to the place . Had HONEY MUSTARD CHICKEN for the main course , BROWNIE SHAKE for drink and BLUEBERRY MOUSSE for dessert and trust me they were delicious . We ordered one each of the mentioned items yet were full at the end . The interior decor was quite decent and the customer attendants were quite cordial and friendly . The main course was served in real quick time but for the drink and  the dessert we had to wait a bit ( the way the brownie shake  was decorated made up for the delay though :P ) .

Overall it was a pleasant experience .

Wowwwww. Outstanding taste  and service!
Decoration is soo nicely designed. Innovative and creative. It gives a very good feeling in your mind and so you can enjoy your meal. As a added mood boost there are books. Sitting available both indoor and outdoor. I opted for indoor. 
Now lets come to food. 
I have tried,
Honey mustard chicken- it was so yummm. But you have to eat it fast to get the best taste.  The French fries given with the dish was also appreciable. 
Chicken lasagne-.....probably the best pasta i have ever ate. Tooooo  cheesy and soft and amazing.  
Chicken nachos - very nice. Nachos with cheese , chicken and some onions on the top. 
Blue lagoon - nice as its regular taste. 
Chocolate cone- nice. 
CHOCO MARVEL pastry - a warm tasty pastry is just like the cherry on the top. It was like queen of desert!!
Awesome in taste.  
Total bill was 1009/- with GST. 
Waiting for the next visit. ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°

I would like to inform you that I had an interaction with one of your waiter. He was very rude, and even used slangs for me. His name was Subhajeet Dey. He works in blue mug. I never knew zomato and blue mug collaboration will give us these people. If I remember, there were other guys Prasenjeet, Sunny. I am now frustrated with the way I and my friends were treated. Awaiting your response or else I have to look for other options. I have made videos if required I will post them on Facebook Instagram and LinkedIn. Horrible service. Thanks

This place is beautiful, period. Actually, calling this charming Cafe just a beautiful place won't do it justice. What would do it justice you ask? Beautiful, snuggly, quaint, delicious, and a bunch of other adjectives. Only good adjectives, might I add.

Ordered Chicken Steak Sizzlers, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Peri Peri Chicken, and Brownie Shakes. I can go and dissect the taste and appearance of every single dish individually but that would be quite redundant here because every dish was wonderful.¬†
One sentence¬†summary for your convenience-
Chicken Steak Sizzler ---- Tender chicken, reasonably creamy.¬†
Chicken Cordon Bleu ---- Cheese extravaganza.¬†
Peri Peri Chicken --------- Smoky flavour, a little spicier than the rest dishes.¬†
Brownie shake ----------- Very rich. Very flavorful.¬†

The setting is particularly praiseworthy. The patio is adequately spacious and the swing was a¬†personal favourite for my group.

Nothing special at all about this place. A friend recommended and took me out to see what the hype was all about. Food was mediocre, the ambiance which people talk about comprise of nothing but a bunch of misfit people shouting all over the cafe. The mocktails were nice anyway which earned them 3.

This was one of the instant decisions that you take when hungry. But it turned out to be pretty dull.
After some shopping at South City, a zomato search landed us here. Location is pretty easy to reach via a rickshaw from opposite South City.
The entrance is narrow with few tables and hanging teapots modified as lights. The counter, fridge and coffee machine are all in this area along with a blue door.
However, there is broad gate which opens to the outside area which has few tables, some ferns and a swinging table.
We opted for the open area.
At first, I deducted 2 ratings simply because they did not have any of their shakes that day on account of broken machine. Totally disheartened. Should have found a replacement of the machine.
OUR ORDER
Irish Coffee - Totally different from what you drink at Starbucks. Wasn't bad in taste but not what I wanted.
Penne Pasta in Creamy Pesto Sauce - this was upto the mark. Taste was creamy and little bland which we wanted. Seasoned well and quite fresh. But quantity was not enough. Pasta came with 2 pieces of bread which was soft, unlike every other place which serves crunchy bread. A let down.
Seafood Sizzler - Again a let down. Seafood means a mix of items from the sea....not just shrimps and that is what we were served. Some skewed shrimps with french fries and fried veggies. Very little seafood and it wasn't even burning enough.
Chicken Stroganoff - Ordered based on mentioned ingredients and man...a total let down. Very less quantity and finding chicken in this item was a Sherlock story. Jeera rice with fried veggies is good but where is the chicken.
Blue Lagoon - except for the blue colour, nothing worth mentioning.

Waiters were not always available. Order was delivered in good time but food was just okayish.
Some zomato review mentioned that they should hire some food consultant, and that is totally true. They must because the menu card is too old and dirty, washed my hands after ordering. The menu lacks the required punch. Change combinations because in the Stroganoff why would you have fried veggies and then veggies in gravy....same thing. Put more chicken instead.
Definitely need a makeover in dishes.

COST BENEFIT RATIO
3.5 out of 5 since quantity is pretty less and the combination of items in one dish is not satisfactory.

One of the prettiest caf√©s in town. The decor is beautiful. Staffs are very well behaved and friendly. Food is delicious. 
We ordered Honey Mustard Chicken, Brownie Shake and Blueberry Mousse. Though they took a bit long to serve the Brownie shake, it was soo prettily crafted with patience and care that I wouldn't complain the late service after that. The Blueberry Mousse was lip-smacking. 
I would definitely love to visit again. Highly recommended.

If you are looking for a perfect cafe in a cheap rate then do head to this restaurant, the ambience, the staffs and the food, everyrhing was marvelous... loved every bit of our food. We ordered
1. Margarita pizza ( A real value for money.)
2. Veg sizzler ( People those who hates veggies will also find it tasty)
3. Chicken Cordon bleu ( Now this was pure bliss. It basically was a roll filled with chicken cooked with cheese and then dipped in chessy sauce.)
4. After 8 shake ( I haven't tasted anything like this earlier. They managed to blend the chocolate and mint flavour perfectly)
5. Oreo Shake ( Now, to be frank, by reading the previous comments I got an idea that this is the signature dish of the cafe, but it's taste was just like a normal chocolate shake, it did disappoint me a bit.)
 Nevertheless I had a good experience all together. Wish to visit this place again.

We had taken chicken apricot ,chicken lollipop and kit Kat shake.The chicken items was so juicy and the taste was just proper.The shake was also good not too sweet .

They have outdoor area too.The red coffee machine, the guitar the piano adds to the decor of the cafe.There is a separate pastry storage refrigerator and the items there looked yummy.The staff was courteous and the service was fast enough.

There are some books also on the book rack and the blue kettle with light hanging from above creates a magical aura.

I have heard a lot about this caf√© from many people. So last evening I decided to go there with my friend. It is actually located in one of small lanes in Jodhpur Park, Kolkata.¬†¬†It has both outdoor and indoor place to sit.¬† We sat in the indoor place.¬† Its a small place though beautifully decorated with small Kettles.¬† Light music was playing on which was making the atmosphere great.¬† We ordered chicken lollipop and brownie with ice cream.

Chicken lollipop was very spicy and tasty. We just loved it.

Brownie with ice cream was pure bliss, yummy.¬† 

Servicing was very good and the staffs were very swift and well behaved.¬† Prices were also affordable.¬† So our first experience there was very good.¬† Looking forward to visit there again.

It would not be absolutely correct to name this as just a coffee shop. Its the most hyped caf√® recently opened near jodhpur park. I must say, the designer of this place is really intelligent. The small place is beautifully turned into a cool caf√® with apt space management. What i liked the most is its outdoor sitting areas with coolers. Though indoor is cool too. The small bar at the entrance is very chique ( even if it looks like a bar, it sells mocktails n milkshakes).
Coming to food, there are varieties of options both for quick bites n for full meals. The sandwitches, sizzlers and pastas are my absolute favourite. The desserts are very ordinary.
Atfirst they used to have prices inclusive of taxes. But after gst, they take tax extra .
The only drawback of this place is its staff. They take quick orders but take a long time delivering it. Often they give you someone else's order which should not be the case atall.
But i love the chilled out ambience of this place a lot. Its mostly full with its customers. I have visited this place thrice and wont mind visiting it further.

A small cozy place on one of the by lanes of jodhpur park..it was not very difficult to locate..the decor was appealing..for the starters we ordered drums of heaven-the quantity was really impressive and tasted pretty good and then we ordered chicken Hawaiian pizza..taste was good..for drinks we had masala thumbs up..Then we ordered chicken stroganoff- we were bit disappointed with the quantity but had no complains regarding the taste. For dessert we had choco marvel pastry and it was so yummy..to top it all they gave us a complimentary drink bubble colada and asked for our feedback..we really had a great experience..all these for Rs.991/-..we will surely visit them again

Located in the lane just opposite to Tandoor Park in Jodhpur Park, it has a prime location..Google Map however ditched us bad and made us walk lot longer than expected.
The management and staff is very courteous and makes guests comfortable.
It was our girls evening outing. We ordered Earlgrey tea, cheese fish fry that came with fresh and crunchy fingerchips and a wonderful dip, chocolate brownie shake, blueberry smoothie and a chicken salami pizza.
The fish fry was tasty and their presentation too. The drinks were also okay. But the pizza wasn't something that we liked. It was bland and the base was way too fluffy and bready. 
They did take a verbal feedback which was something that I personally liked and we gave our honest take. We were expecting a thin crust to which the attendant informed that their dough's are hand tossed, if we mentioned then they would have made arrangements.
However the atmosphere decor and staff pleased us.  Thanks.

The cafe was in my bucket list for long, so dropped in today. It is a small cafe with both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement.
Ambience- nice, cozy and colourful.

Food - this place is famous for its mocktel but I didn't find it good enough. Specially blue lagoon (their speciality) is very disappointing.
Apricot chicken wings tastes good.
What i like the most is grilled fish with lemon butter sauce. The sauce is amazing. It comes with sauted veggies, rice and smashed potato.

Service - prompt. But the place is always crowded and take so long to get a seat.

Overall a good experience.

A word of advice for the sweet-bugs,The shakes are absolutely heavenly but very heavy....if you're up for them do save some space in your tummy during the main course.
This place is definitely an economical bet for continental food lovers.

Oh my god! I'm so in love with this place. I wanted to come here since a really long time and finally I made it here. This place is just BEAUTIFUL! Both in terms of food and ambience this place is just perfect.

Okay so the location of this cafe is pretty odd. I would suggest to take a cab from Rabindra Sarabar metro station. It'll take around 15minutes to reach.

This is a tiny cafe which is beautifully decorated. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. I actually preferred the outdoor seating because it's surrounded by trees and its very comfortable. They even have a swing outside which is pretty cool.

Coming to the food, I ordered Chicken Lasagne, Oreo Shake and Brownie Shake. The Chicken Lasagne was good actually I haven't tried it before it was my first time. But I liked it. It was very cheesy and their was good amount of chicken in it. But honestly the shakes stole the show. Both the shakes tasted absolutely amazing. It was beautifully presented and the quantity was also pretty good. But according to my taste I feel it was a bit too sweet but all in all it was good. Totally worth the money.

I have never given any restaurant a 5 star rating till now but this cafe deserves it all. Extra points for the servers. They were so polite and helpfull. And the service was pretty promt.

I will surely visit this place again and again! ‚ù§

Visited the place today for a late lunch and tried a couple of their servings.
Loved the decor, along with the outdoor seating, though we chose to sit inside because of the high humidity.
Two of the main course items were ordered - the barbecue pizza and chicken stroganoff. The pizza stuffing could have been better, but the stroganoff was absolutely perfect. Along with the two dishes, from the drinks the brownie shake was truly remarkable.
Enjoyed the service also, and they can work on their song collection.
Loved the food, gonna visit soon for more of their creations.

This cosy little place is located in Jodhpur Park. It can reached either by Rabindra Sarovar Metro or Lake Gardens railway station.
It has a seating capacity of around twenty people which includes the outdoor eating area. The decor is aesthetically pleasing with a bookshelf, a guitar, a piano and numerous pictures. We were served water from these beautiful coloured glass bottles.
Coming to the food, we ordered Oreo Shake, Brownie Shake, KitKat Shake and Cold Coffee with Ice Cream. In the main course, we ordered a Chipotle BBQ Wings Sizzler and a Mixed Sauce Veg Penne Pasta. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the shakes are worth all the money they cost. Served in glass jars with layers of cream and cherries, they are a visual as well as gustatory treat. The sizzler and pasta were also well cooked and tasty. Absolutely no complaints about the food. The service is good enough. The dishes are more or less reasonably priced. 
Worth a repeat visit.

Celebrated a friend's birthday here..well to be very frank ,out of the dishes that we ordered-we ordered chicken pizza,blue lagoon,chicken club sandwich,pink panther and cold drinks....only the chicken club sandwich was worth the money. It was delicious. But the rest..especially the pink panther named drink simply tasted like horrible strawberry ice cream that has melted.
The best thing about this place is the outdoor seating area that has been done up nicely with that swing which we pre booked a day in advance and had an awesome time. The staff here are very friendly.Loved their service.Would pay a second visit just for the chicken club sandwich and the swing.

Jodhpur park is thronged with exotic cafes and blue mug has been making it to the top for quite a while now. A little walking when you get down at Jodhpur park and a little help of google map can locate this place easily. Dropped by yesterday with my big group of college buddies and had one enjoyable evening here. Things to try from the menu are :
‚Ä¢Barbeque chicken burger- served with chips and dips. Really worth a try.
‚Ä¢Cheese brushetta - cheese lovers favourite. Light yet yummy.
‚Ä¢ Vegetable sizzlers- for the vegetarian ones. Amazing in taste. French fries,paneer gravy and fresh sauted vegetables.
‚Ä¢Chicken steak sizzlers
‚Ä¢Mixed sea food sizzlers - it was okay in comparison to others.
‚Ä¢Kitkat shake - Heaven.
‚Ä¢The star of the evening- THE OREO SHAKE. Don't leave this place without trying this amazing oreo shake. This is absolutely amazing!
The ambiance is good, music a little too loud but good choice of songs. Staff was well behaved and quick service as well. :

I have always been in love with tiny cafes in the corners of the streets with pretty little decors and aesthetically pleasing stuff. 
I've been to Blue mug thrice now and I can vouch for the fact that coffee and thoughts is the perfect little tag they can have. In all my visits, I've had a total of 11 of their dishes. From Chicken steak sizzler, BBQ chicken pizza, BBQ chicken burger, chicken lollipop in the non vegetarian menu while veg penne pasta, hash brown potato, nachos on the veg side and the virgin mojito, mango smoothie, cappuccino and brownie with ice cream. Everything is well prepared and delicious. They have prompt service and amazing behaviour from the waiting staff. 
Blue mug will always be recommended because it gives you sense of a calm when you sit there sipping your coffee while reading a book alone or gorging on yummy foodand talking with your friends.

Located at a corner of Jodhpur park, this place has been in my checklist for a long time. Finally got the chance to tick it off the checklist.
The decoration is pretty good. The outdoor seating space is much better though than the indoor AC area.
We ordered:-
1. Blue lagoon, virgin mojito, fruit sangria, pink panther for mocktails
2. Bruchetta
3. Chicken lollipop
4. Cottage cheese garlic sizzler
5. Lamb chap sizzler

The food was pretty good. So were the mocktails. I liked the presentation of the food also.

Pocket pinch was Rs 1640/-

I especially liked the chicken lollipop and pink panther.

Overall a nice experience. The only letdown point is that i think the price is slightly on the higher side...

Looking for a place where you can relax with friends and family? Blue Mug it is! The ambience is homely. And the food is quite scrumptious. We ordered Cheese fondue, Mexican pizza, brownie shake and chocolate monk. Worth every penny spent!

First let me start with cappuccino,the cup was filled with froth with very modest amount of real coffee and also the coffee itself wasn't anything great.My friend ordered a latte and again had a poor experience.
Then we ordered a bbq chicken pizza and chicken lasagna.The pizza was topped with a lot of cheese but the crust was of cheap quality bread,Also the pizza tasted a bit too sweet, something i don't like in my pizza.
And coming to the real dissapointment of the evening,the lasagna.The lasagna wasn't baked properly and what we got instead was just a raw mixture of cheese and minced chicken.It tasted really horrible and almost ruined the experience.
And if that wasn't enough the service was really terrible,we had to wait really long for our food to arrive and to top it all we received the wrong bill.
Verdict:Not recommend.
Food:1/5
Service:1.5/5
Ambience and Decor:3/5
To conclude,i am never visiting this place again.

The decor and the ambience is very good. We order barbeque chicken pizza and cheese fondue . Both of them were really good. We also ordered two smoothies a blueberry one and mango. The price estimation is really good. It did cost us 700 for two people . Overall it was a good experience.

Situated in a lonely lane .. this joint stands out with a punch. Visited a long time ago but couldn't manage to review it until today.

We visited on a weekday afternoon, but the ac section was already filled up.. later we realised some kind of shooting was going on..which created a lot of chaos..but somehow the food made up for every little complaint we had initially.

We tried the chicken stake, honey mustard chicken.. mocktails.. which were extremely gut filling and yummy.. nice decoration with quirky little kettles, bottles, etc.. would definitely suggest everyone to try this one out once.. you won't regret it.

Just a suggestion to the cafe.. Please do not arrange any shooting or event and still keep the cafe open to customers.. it creates a lot of hassle and disturbance running the event and cafe at the same time..since we did not get any proper service until the shooting unit wrapped up..!

Cool place , with a quirky decor. One will instantly fall for the ambience and the friendly behaviour of the staffs. This is my second visit to this place and I had one of the best lasagne here.
Though there is a bit of waiting time as this place is very resonably priced which attracts more of youngsters to come down with friends and spend a nice evening here, but the place is worth the wait..
So next time you wonder where to take your loved one to have a soulful time over some yummilacious dishes give this place a try
U wont be disappointed!!!
P.S. have the brownie with ice cream. You will love it.

One of the popular cafes situated in a quiet corner at Jodhpur Park, having very contemporary interiors and cool lighting effects. The food is decent and the staff are friendly . The service is slow on crowded evenings and rarely would you find a table empty on weekends. The waiting time to get a table is considerably long, since none are in a hurry to leave.

We ordered flavoured cappuccinos which were pretty good. Fish and chips were tasty. But the Chicken caudan blue had too much salt in it. Otherwise the food was wholesome. We also ordered a strawberry smoothie which had strawberry jelly in it instead of real strawberry slices, but the taste was good nevertheless.

Ambiance is better in the open air seating area. The inner AC part is too noisy and chaotic with blasting music and people chatting loudly to make themselves heard above the music volume. The outside non-ac dining area is quiet, peaceful and relaxing.

Staff was good, especially their floor manager is extremely polite and amicable.

Would want to revisit on a less crowded day someday.

This is my second visit to Blue Mug.Last day I went along with a friend and it was raining heavily outside,we reached there so early that we were the first customersüòÇ
Now coming to the food,I think Blue Mug has more varieties compared to the other cafes and the food is really really good.Their one plate of French Fries costs 80 bucks and that is so worth it,you will be getting a huge bowl heaped with the all goodness of french friesüòå‚ù§Ô∏è
Their BBQ chicken pizza is to die for,and I personally think that after Pizza Hut this is the best pizza I have ever eaten because it has everything a pizza should be-soft crust,cheese overload and beautiful flavours.
Their BBQ chicken burger is also beautifully done specially there is a chicken steak inside which is soft and juicy and makes the burger magical‚ù§Ô∏è
Now coming to deserts,Blue Mug has got a variety of deserts out of which I really liked the chocolate ones like the choco marvel pastry and the choco cone.I am looking forward to try the other ones too‚ù§Ô∏è
The ambience is beautiful,the idea of using coloured kettles as beautiful lamps is quite a commendable one.And the gorgeous colourful bottles in which they serve water are loveüòå‚ù§Ô∏è
They even have a sitting area outside the cafe which is done inside a beautiful small garden and there is a swing where customers can sit and have their meal.
You can spend a whole lot of time in this place having adda with your friends and there are even facilities for smoking in the garden area.
All in all Blue Mug is a beautiful place and worth your time and money :)

Twice I tried this cafe earlier. Twice I couldn't, due to lack of parking and sitting space. Third time I was lucky. 
Why they named it Blue Mug I forgot to ask. Anyway, excellent decoration. Ample sitting place with sofas too. There are keyboards, books and guitars to entertain yourself till the food arrives.
But I must say, the menu card is too shabby and well-thumbed. Time to print a new one.
At first I sat like a queen in a far end corner. But soon realised my mistake, for it is very near to the toilet, and felt too much disturbed by the sound of flushes. So changed the place near the door. There is ample place to sit in the open air, but looking into the sultry weather, decided to stay indoors. I ordered Americans and crispy prawn. Crispy prawn arrived earlier - delicious. I could have used another plate of the same type. Americano was warm and eased my throat  pain.
Would like to come again and try the sizzler.
Price moderate, parking - depends on the situation.

A nice little place with indoor as well as outdoor seating arrangements...Has been talk of the town for quite some time now...
Ambiance is pretty good...

Had Chicken Salami Pizza..Fresh Lime Soda and Blueberry Smoothie...

Chicken Salami Pizza-- It tasted really good...No issues with this one...:)

Fresh Lime Soda--This was also fine...No complaints..:)

Blueberry Smoothie-- This was not at all to my liking...Maybe it was not for me at all...On top of that it had corn flakes toppings which i hated the most üòÖüòÖMight appeal to somw other people's taste buds..Definitely not my kinda drink...

Overall a nice experience except the smoothie...pictures next tym for sure..:)
Need to try out their sizzlers n burgers...have heard about them a lot...:)

My first visit was on a rainy evening. The place was packed and we were asked to wait for 15 mins but they found a table and quickly asked us to come inside though other people were also waiting outside.Really grateful to them! So coming to the food we ordered french fries, BBQ chicken pizza, brownie with ice cream and crispy fried prawn. Crispy fried prawn was disappointing though. Nevertheless there are many other options to go with which are soooo good. Also high five to the staff for being prompt !

Tongue friendly as well as pocket friendly. The cafe has both indoors and outdoors sitting arrangements with cozy ambience. As it doesn't have many tables you may have to wait for getting one. But the food is definitely worth the wait. If you're going for the first time to the place I'd recommend you to try-
1. BBQ Chicken pizza
2.grilled fish sizzler
3.chicken club sandwich
4. Chocolate brownie shake
5.kitkat shake
6.choco marble cake
7.cheese fondue
Happy food! ‚ò∫

This place just came into existence a little time ago, and soon became a huge craze among all college-goers. We were no exception.

Location and Ambience:¬†
This is a big cafe situated in Jodhpur Park, amidst all the greenery. There is an indoor and an outdoor section which is beautifully decorated with small plants and all. As expected from its name, this place has the greatest lighting with bluish tinge to give you the most at-home feeling. There is a bookshelf full of great books and a keyboard you can play along.

Food:
This place is most famous for its innovative shakes and desserts. The KitKat and Oreo shakes are the most famous. I personally felt that the shakes were so full of cream that the almost lost the liquidity. There is a huge variety of food to choose from-Continental, Italian etc. The pizzas are great and the sizzlers are too tasty.

What we ordered:
1. Oreo Shake (Chocolate Shake covered with thick cream and Oreo biscuits)
2.Chicken Steak Sizzler ( Sliced Steak in gravy served with peas, mushrooms, babycorn etc veggies, in a cabbage leaf)
This was well ¬†within our budget.
We will look forward to trying more off the menu!
P.S: Don't miss the bill in a blue mug!

Service:¬†
Very Good and Friendly. They have many staff to cater to you, who are all quite friendly.

Decided to visit this place seeing it's high ratings. But sadly the experience here was not good. Ordered chicken penne pasta in arabiata sauce, Oreo shake and a blueberry smoothie.
The blueberry smoothie tasted okay,not so great. The Oreo shake was horrible. Firstly it was not cold enough nor could the flavour be understood. When we complained about the same, they added chilled water to that, worsening the taste. :(
The pasta tasted good but felt the quantity was less.
Overall it was not worth to me. :(

We were the first people to enter the cafe on a Thursday. At about 11 am they said they weren't ready to open so we came back about 30 minutes later. Finally we got in. The A.C was on and it made us feel great cause it was really humid outside. We sat down in the A.C (obviously). And since it was too early for lunch we ordered a VIRGIN MOJITO to start off. It was one of the best mojitos I've had in a while. perfectly lemony and fizzy.

Next we ordered a CHICKEN LASAGNA (since lamb lasagna was unavailable at the time) and a PENNE PASTA IN ALFREDO SAUCE. I simply loved how the pasta tasted. The aroma when it was served made me half full already! The quantity was perfect and tasted absolutely mesmerising. The Lasagna tasted great too. Only thing it was too cheesy I.e., if you were a huge FAN OF CHEESE then this dish is highly recommended for you. But the quantity was again really good and I assure you one lasagna is more than enough for two people. Both the pasta and lasagna are served WITH DELICIOUS BREAD. The bread worked perfectly to add that crunch and base to the two dishes. Loved it too much.

For dessert we had the CHOCOLATE CONE. It wasn't the greatest dessert we've had in our lives but yes it was a good one.

I simply cannot wait to come back to Blue Mug and actually try out from their shakes and smoothies menu.

P.S The staff was very courteous and helpful. Hope they keep up the great work even in the future. Also, the ambience in the cafe is quite cozy with a lovely and small area having a guitar, synthesiser and some books. Some music is always on the background. There's an option to sit indoors (Air conditioned) as well as outdoors (with swing tables and head fans but amidst nature which is also pretty cool) as per your choice. Hope to come back very soon. :-)

I heard a LOT about the place therefore heading there after some work in the area was exactly what i wanted to do. as you enter, it does look very beautiful, the decor, blue walls, everything gives a calm vibe to the place but unfortunately, it is one of the noisiest place i have ever walked into. so don't think of working from here- specially indoors. the constant whirr of their coffee machines is too much to take and plus they play loud music too.¬†
coming to food- their cappuccino was okay, the crispy cheese stuffed mushroom was quite good and could have been better without adding rosemary to it. but their pizzas are disgusting. they use store bought bread as their base which is a huge turn off and i ordered margharitta- the simplest pizza to make but it was the worst margharitta i ever tried. they add barbecue sauce, peppers and mushroom to a pizza that is supposed to have only marinara and cheese. quite disappointing i must say. they really should upgrade to a better menu or hire a food consultant asap.
                    
their staff is really polite though and service was quick although my coffee reached me after they served my pizza.

Well ambience was good.. Decoration and the music put an extra swing to the mood. And coming on the food. Virgin mojhito fine. Fish fry was actually the best one that evening with tartar dip... Chicken lollypops were good. But the blue mug sundae is a disaster. Well for those who loves swimming in chocolate preparation all the time may love it but a sundae is never a complete chocolate house. Browny thn chocolate icecream ruined the feel of a sundae. For me its a 1time visit.

Had heard a lot of praise for this place, so decided to visit on a Monday evening. We ordered the KitKat shake, blueberry shake and strawberry shake along with the BBQ pizza and Lamb penne bolognese. The presentation gave us high hopes, but alas the tastes failed to impress us. The shakes were overly sweet to the point of killing one's appetite. The bolognese sauce was so full of black pepper that we couldn't taste anything else whatsoever. The pizza was quite ordinary store bought crust one, however it was the best of the lot (merely in comparison) and tasted alright.

This place was in my bucket list since long. Place was cozy at the same time comfortable. Ambience is colourful. Pocket friendly. The place is usually stays over crowded which makes the place a little noisy at times. Staff respond too less. We had ordered for the following things:
# Veg. Pizza ( we had specifically said no mexican beans thrice, but still they served us with it)
# Onion rings  ( It had written it will be serving 6pcs, but they served more than 15)
# Garlic Bread
# Spaghetti  ( delicious)
# nachos  (yummy)
# Oreo shake
# Blue lagoon
Food quality and quantity both was good.
Service was worst. They were taking a lot of time, until the manager came and said to fasten up. 
Thank you to the Manager.

I really like the place, been there quite a few times and the ambience, specially outside, is so relaxing. The service is good, no doubt. However, the only part which made me rate blue mug a star less is that at times during the rush hour, food quality gets a little compromised. But, that can be ignored almost always and a happy pocket-friendly place it is for me and my people.

A restaurant consistently getting 4+ reviews is a tough ask, but also a testimony to their efforts to maintain the quality of service and delivery. So let's dig in.

Menu : ¬†we ordered Lamb Chap Sizzler, Honey Mustard Chicken, Grilled Fish, Apricot Chicken Wings, Fresh Lime and rounded it off with Hot brownies with ice cream.

What works: ¬†

The first thing you notice at a restaurant is how you are received and seated. The staff did a good job being polite and greeted us with a warm smile. (Sometimes it puts people off to see fake smiles.) They even offered a small candy bar to the child. The ambiance was good, clean and well appointed. Noticed a piano and guitar lying in one corner, must be for some impromptu jam session.

Apricot Chicken Wings were good soft and the sauce was done well. Grilled Fish was of decent quality, perhaps the best of the three we tried, and the white sauce blend was done nicely.The french fries were not burnt and the sides were adequate.Honey Mustard Chicken was a good portion, the rice was well cooked and the Chicken was okay too.¬†

The Lamb Chap had a nice smoky brown sauce and had a good aroma. The Chocolate Brownie with vanilla ice cream was done to near perfection. The sizzle quotient was good, with a generous topping of hot chocolate and cashews. The quality of brownie was seen in the softness and the plating was visually appealing.¬†

What could have been better :¬†

Fundamentally, when you make a lamb ribs sizzler, you would want to be careful with the size of lamb you select. The smaller it is the better. Or if it is big¬†then the portions have to be handpicked to ensure the meat is cooked well enough to be eaten with a ¬†fork and knife and that there is enough meat on both selections.

This was not the case here, the meat was a little tough to scrape off the bone and the compact plating did not help the cause either. You would need a little larger sizzler plate to give some place to maneuver lest¬†the sauce overflows on to the table mat.¬†

One more tiny thing. When you bring a sizzler you have to make sure it ¬†"sizzles" till it reaches the table. It is one of the main reasons sizzler has caught peoples fancy in India. By the time our sizzler arrived there was more of smoke and less of sizzle.

The honey mustard chicken was a little over grilled, which made the meat unevenly cooked in places. Otherwise, the taste and the sauces were good. You might want to look into the quality of cutlery, especially the forks, they need some bit sharpening or a replacement with a proper steak knife.¬†

I am not trying to nitpick here. You see, I believe, ¬†all of these small things add up to a great dining experience and not just the food alone. You remember a restaurant not just for great taste, and there are many, but also for the overall experience at the table, and there are very few.¬†

Is Blue Mug value for money? Absolutely yes.Good portions? Yes. A good place to be? It is a good place to go, and with a little bit of tweak and control, it might become the most sought after place in the food lovers list.

Not a top notch location, as one has to drive a bit after drifting off the main road from Jodhpur Park. The food is good , well cooked and served fast. 
The waiters are amiable and courteous. 
Try out suggestion: Oreo Shake, The burgers, The Sizzlers. 
Avoid the lasagna, as I feel they could've done a better job.

Well this is nice and small place with good food in a good price. We opted for the outdoor sitting since we went at evening. All those potted green plants aesthetically uplifts the setting. In one word absolutely loved it. We ordered a Chicken Club Sandwich and a Blue Lagoon and something in mocktail called chocolate monk. The taste was pretty good, even the quantity was pleasing. Locating this food joint can give you some trouble, but else the experience was nice. Will definitely try it out some other time.

Especially for the coffee..

Good place with plenty of servers to take your order. Very elaborate menu for a cafe. The all day breakfast menu is very filling. The Caesar salad can be improved. They also have an outdoor sitting where you can smoke or enjoy the weather. I have been here twice, and would love to go back again. Location is very approachable and the cafe can be easily located in Jodhpur Park. In my opinion, the best cafe to chill in that area.

Located very near Abar Baithak you can take right from there till you reach the straight lane and then walk towards right side .After walking some deal you will find this place pretty easily because of the bluish shade it spreads on the lane .

I have tried their salads , Chicken steak and different types of coffee at different times and they have never disappointed me .

                                ----------------
Pros  -

‚úìAmbience : Indeed the best part about the cafe .Has an open roof space for people who want to smoke 4/5

‚úìStaff : Gentle and kind behavior, they are pretty helpful if you have confusion with your food 3.5/5

‚úìQuality : Good quality 4/5

‚úìQuantity : Pretty good Quantity 4/5

‚úìPresentation : They do not focus too much on this but it's pretty clean 3/5

‚úìBudget : Not a very high budget cafe .You can bring around your friends here 4/5


Cons -

‚úìThe place usually stays over crowded which makes the place a little noisy at times .

‚úìThe staffs get too occupied with every table they respond too less .
                            ---------------------
Overall I will definitely suggest you to go to this place and you will fall in love with it's ambience.

One of the most budget friendly and awesome hangout places. Food is just top notch. We had ordered fish cubes,crunchy garlic filled mushroom as starters. For main course we had veg sizzler and chicken steak sizzler. Finally we ended with a brownie shake. Each and every item looked and tasted simply delicious. There's nothing more you can ask for at this price point.

Loved the place. The staff were immensely courteous.We ordered Lamb Sizzler, Bar-b-q chicken sizzler and crispy fried prawn were amazing. The kit kat shake and Blue Mug splicing sundae was superb too. Among drinks, fruit sangria and Blue lagoon are a must try. The price is also very cheap for the best sizzlers in town. Just one suggestion, it would be great if they can increase the quantity a bit to get a full 5 rating as otherwise everything else was just perfect.

Quaint little cafe located in one of the by lanes of jodhpur park. The outdoor seating area is really pretty.. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. The cheese fish fry is an absolute must have. The crunchy garlic stuffed mushroom was good though slightly on the oilier side. For mains, we had bbq chicken pizza with plenty of toppings and soft crust,lamb sphagetti with arrabiata sauce which was a little spicy but amazing and chicken steak sizzler which was pretty good as well. Desserts were the highlight though. Blueberry pastry and choco marvel pastry - delectable and heavenly. And all this came down to less than 1500. Definitely visiting again!

Near my place in Jodhpur park... Nice ambience.. Little small but well decorated. Had to wait for almost an hour in the evening maybe because of Independence day & the rush... But once inside, the food was worth it ‚ù§ 
Had virgin mojitos, one margarita pizza & cheese & cottage cheese stuffed (paneer) stuffed mushroom balls which was oh so yum! 
Will visit it soon for sure...

I went to this place with a lot of hope because of the popularity it has gained in the last few days. The ambience is good.
Coming to food, I'm really upset.
First I ordered was a bacon sandwich. I've had many kinds of sandwiches but I don't know what was that because it only contained a lettuce, a tomato and few bacon fillet. I dont know how the bacon were cooked. Because they were really horrible. I don't know if they were boiled or roasted or fried.
Then came the bbq sizzle chipotles which is basically 6 chickens wings with some frenchfries at 230rs. Real smooth. Wow amazing. It tasted average and doesn't move your tastebuds or soul.
Finally the famous oreo shake came which looked delicious. But again it failed to live up to expectation as it was servedd at a room temperature. Since when shakes and smoothies started being served at room temperature? I really don't know.
Really very upset with the food quality.
Won't really say pocket friendly considering the quantity isn't really sufficient for two.
Bad experience. Not visiting again.

Had a pretty good experience and will be visiting soon to have more !! Their grilled chicken mayo sandwich is highly recommended..(ample freshly cooked chicken cubes embedded within deep layer of mayonnaise served along with ketchup & chips).. another worth mentioning dish is chicken lollipop.. I just hope they keep maintaining their quantity as well as quality even in the future.. 
Regarding their menu in zomato , the recent price is not being updated and their sandwich page is missing :)

I've visited this place twice and came back satisfied everytime. Though located amidst residential area and one might face difficulty while visiting for the first time; the place deserves to be explored. With friendly decor, soothing music and good food; the place is a gem of cafes. Price is very reasonable for the quality and quantity that they serve. It's a must visit for every cafe lover.

This was my 2nd time visit! 1st time when I visited during the weekend evening it was too much crowded and people waiting outside to get in. So I left the place since I was in hurry. 2nd made sure to visit on a weekday i.e thu vening.

Ambiance: They have 2 section one outside more of a garden area you can say and one inside. I initially sat outside and took probably the best seat which has a seating arrangement on a swing. I loved the ambiance with dim lights and comfortable swing around. But the problem happened once a kitten came around to have bite of the fish which we ordered. It was trying to jump on to the table and did manage to bite the chicken item which the restaurant staff replaced later on and then we went inside as the kitten was not going from there. Inside the ambiance is chic with kettle hanging above your table. Loved the ambiance inside too.

Food: We ordered brownie shake and after 8 shake and no doubt its one of the best shakes I had recently. It was thick and tasted heavenly. I love the after 8 shake and would definitely recommend not to miss that since it has hint of mint flavour which doesn't make the shake too sweet to have and is something different than the regular stuff. It looked lovely too, the way it was garnished. We also ordered chessy fish fry which was served with french fries and no doubt it was equally heavenly. Next we ordered chicken lollipop which i was average i think. Initially which was given to us outside I had one bite of that and that time it was too good but the second time which was given to us it was too spicy and little gravy type. I think it was bimistake or something since 1st time it was nice.

Service: Now service is something I think they need to improve. I have no problems with their behaviour since they were courteous and gave us the swing outside knowing we were only 2. But it was good on their part to let us know that please shift to other place if we get big crowd since its place for 2. It was good on their part to let us know before hand unlike others. But the staff somehow misses the basic thing to give glass of water which they gave later on when asked and asked for apology. It was sweet of their part but need to be more attentive towards guests I feel. 

Pocket pinch wise it value for money. The price is on lower side and food quantity and quality wise is among the best you can have in any cafe in kolkata. Do Not Miss it!! Be prepared for queue outside during the weekends

They serve great food, like really great food.
But their service and ambience is not upto the mark.
Everytime we go here, we find this place over crowded.
First time we had to wait for 25 mins because a group was rehearsing their drama, the owner was pissed off too.

Have tried many dishes here.
One of the finest coffee they serve, try the espresso double shot if you are into hard coffee; arabica and irish coffee is great too.
Even their cold coffee tastes amazing.

Loved their lamb chap sizzler, veggies are perfectly saut√©ed.
Greek salad is good, so is the shrimp one.

have tried their chicken and lamb penne and spaghetti both.

Their chiken wings tastes amazing as well.

I've stopped going here because of their ambience nowadays.
Improve it.

The place doesnt give a football kick to your pocket and serves you moth watering dishes! One of the best places to hang out with your buddies or to catch up on a casual date.. There burgers are a must try!

Blue mug tucked away in the interior lanes of Jodhpur park has been in my wishlist for quite a days now.But finally I got a chance to visit it yesterday.Its beautifully decorated with cute kettles hanging from ceiling and blue lighting and photographs hanging in frames in the wall.Now coming to the food,we couldn't order much as we too full by just two dishes. The Chipotle bbq chicken wings sizzler served with french fries was really yummy with no taste lacking.It was perfect according to me.Next we ordered chicken lasagna which was filled with cheese and chicken in between pasta sheets.Its good for all the cheese lovers out there and the quantity was more than enough for two of us.So sadly we couldn't order anything more and are surely going back for drinks and desserts.

Finally thought of visiting one of the trending cafes in town, that too on independence day! Never imagined that we have to wait for around 50 mins before getting the opportunity to grab a chair!! We opted for the outdoor since it gives you an added advantage of having smoke along with. However I would be rating 5 stars to the manager who is doing an excellent job out here - really courteous to us. Now coming to the food, we ordered chicken penne pasta, cheese fish fry and KitKat shake. Each of them gonna amaze your taste buds! And even it's pocket friendly. Really enjoyed it. (Only disappointment was waiting so long, but once again couldn't really help on it). Hoping to visit soon. A good place to hang out with, and you have more reasons if you stay in south!

One of the best places to hangout with friends. I have been there several times. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. I prefer the outdoor seating. The indoor decorations are awesome and the idea to use kettle, bottles as illuminating equipments is unique. I have tried bbq chicken pizza, chicken nachos, kitkat shake, brownie shake, after 8 shake, cold coffee with hazelnut, blueberry pastry. The pizza is one of the best in that price. I tried chicken nachos for the first time, it was okayish. All the shakes are same in the taste just the flavours are changed. The shakes are creamy and chocolaty. I love the brownie shake. And the blueberry pastry was good.
Foods are value for money.

Blue mug is a fancy cafe. Just like the menu bar but just not the food over there.
The tables at the outdoor space are really tiny. Forget about two people.
There creeps a cat by the fench. Not everyone is a cat lover. Not extending further with a moderate pocket pinch this cafe is just sober.
I found abar boithok a better choice definitely which is a nearby cafe. And I have been to both of them. 
Happy fooding folks.

Today I went with my two college friends to chill out.This place is a perfect one for hanging out in evening time especially in the weekends.You might have to wait for a while as this place is always crowded.Coming to the ambience,there are two sections i.e. one ac section and another garden.We have chosen the garden to feel the rainy windy weather.We have ordered Cafe Latte -Double Shot, Apricot Chicken Songs,Brushetta, Cottage Cheese Balls.To be honest,the quality to the all items are up to the mark.I would like to revisit this place shortly.

A cozy cute cafe jst 2 mins from home on a lazy saturday afternoon is a blessing. The place is a bit overcrowded and most often you will have to wait for your turn to come. Since it was a rainy aftrnoon we prefeered to sit in the closed area. Yes, they do have an open dining area as well. The place is beautifully done with quirky interiors. Open bar section where i could actually watch them prepare drinks was a cherry on the cake. 
The food was great. 
veg stroganoff based in mushroom gravy with lots of veggies is something you will never regret ordering. Served with herb rice and lettuce salad, this dish is strongly recommended. Blueberry Smoothie was mayb one of the best drinks i have had. Chocolate monk with vanilla ice chocolate frappe and kitkat had quite an appealing presentation which was a treat to eyes.

And oh, may I add - it's so worth it! 

Extremely pretty, and such good food being served by super-friendly staff for an amazingly astonishing value for money! üíï

An excellent place for hanging out with friends. The interior is very beautiful and cosy. There is also an outside seating area with greens around. We went there on a rainy day and hoped to sit outside but seats weren't available. The lights are very creative. They have used kettles and bottles as lighting equipment. We ordered Chicken Nachos, Blueberry pastry, KitKat shake and Cold coffee with hazelnuts. The blueberry cake was the best. First time i tasted chicken nachos and it was quite good. The excellent one was the Kitkat shake. I would definitely recommend that. Its very creamy and chocolaty. But i think it might become too much for one person to finish. Altogether its one of the best places to hangout in Kolkata.

It's a very nice place to hangout with friends. We ordered Kitkat shake, Cold coffee with hazelnuts, chicken nachos and blueberry pastry. The quality was good. The quantity of the Kitkat Shake was more than enough. It will take 2 persons to finish the Kitkat shake. Nachos was average. The price generally seems a bit high but with the ambience and the quantity it's totally worth it. The staffs are very courteous. I will definitely like to visit there again.

This cafe had been in my bookmark since long and finally got a chance to visit this evening. We were three and reached there at 4.10pm, we waited for 10 mins for a table which was reasonable and luckily it wasn't raining at that particular time. The manager was very courteous and offered us a a table inside which we preferred. We ordered Apricot Chicken Wings, Chicken Lasagne, Vegetable Club Sandwich, Cappuccino and KitKat Shake. The food was really good. The wings were crisp and tasty and hot...the lasagne was soo guey and cheese and yet flavourful and the portion size was enough for two of us to share, the club sandwich was average. The shake was way too creamy but tasty and coffee was also refreshing. The rates are very pocket friendly. The staff is little casual but the manager was always on his toes to help us. One thing that I noticed is this place is very noisy so its good to go there with a bunch of friends and enjoy a gala time laughing and talking but definitely not a place for silent and soothing ambience lovers... I wish to visit this place again soon to explore more food options... Recommended!!

Three of us went for Lunch today at Blue Mug cafe. The place is in Jodhpur Park near Netaji Sweets. A bit difficult to locate if one is not familiar with the Jodhpur Park area. The ambience was ordinary. We were seated indoors. Now coming to food, We ordered Cranito, a fruit Mocktail and Blueberry Smoothie. They were delicious. We ordered Fish Cubes and Chicken Wings with Apricot for starters. They were yummy. For main course we ordered Sea food sizzler, Chicken Wings with Chipootle and Spagetti Bolognese. I loved the fish and the spagetti. Chicken Wings were spicy and left a wonderful taste in the mouth. Food overall was excellent. The only drawback is the service. I had to wait for nearly 50 minutes for my smoothie and had to inquire 3 to 4 times. They should work on that.
Overall a great place to chill with friends and have good continental food. Easy on the pocket too.

Saturday afternoon what better place to chill than a cute cafe near your place?! Blue mug is that quaint little cafe we a dream of... Small intimate place done up beautifully with seatings both within the cafe and outside. As it was a rainy afternoon we preferred sitting inside. I loved their open bar space where you can see them making the shakes in front of your eyes. They have a corner with musical instruments and books. What else does one really need!
Now coming to the food...
Chicken steak- big piece of chicken sliced up with herb rice, French fries and vegetables. Delicious and satisfying!
Veg stroganoff- lots of veggies in mushroom sauce served with lettuce salad and herb rice. Recommended strongly for vegetarians.
Blueberry shake- thick, creamy and almost perfect.
Chocolate monk - loved the presentation of this drink. The taste was quite unique and not just another chocolaty drink.

Service-5

Ambience-5
Price-5

People near Jodhpur park... Do visit Blue Mug.

First of all, do not and I repeat do NOT sit at the table in front of the door to the outdoor seating area. You'll regret it. It's the worst table in the cafe. When we tried to change the table later twice in fact, we were greeted with a flat out NO. The noise of the coffee machine and shakers was so loud we could not make ourselves heard.
Coming to the food, we ordered Cafe Mocha, Irish Coffee, Chicken Steak and Chicken Lasagna. The Irish Coffee was too sweet. The cafe Mocha was okay. The Lasagna had a liquid consistency. The only thing that brought this place a rating above one was the Chicken Steak. It was delicious.
I have no desire to visit this place again.

An extremely popular joint, Blue Mug is one of the best cafes for a casual, lazy, relaxing evening, with a really soothing ambience.The prices are reasonable and the quantity of the dishes is substantial.
Visited this place after a really long wait.Was trying for a long time. When we reached there, around 7pm,it was full.After a wait of about 10 mins, we entered.
The waiters were extremely well-mannered and quick in service. Overall, the decor was simple yet alluring, we preferred sitting outdoors.
Under the fan, with the surrounding plants adding to the charm & a slight cool breeze flowing, we ordered the following -
1)BarBQ Chicken Burger - Was decent.Nothing out of the world but tasty. (3.5/5)

2)Chicken Nachos - This one was really delicious.Though the presentation could be worked upon, the taste was splendid!! (4.5/5)

3)Peri Peri Chicken - It was well presented, looked delightful and tasted really nice.The boiled veggies added to it's glory. (4/5)

4)Brownie Shake - The presentation was simply fantastic !! Taste could be improved but all in all,an excellent shake (4/5)

Overall,a really nice experience, outdoor seating was a nice change from the regular AC rooms and will definitely give it another visit !! :D

This cafe is situated in jodhpur park. 10 minutes form abar baithak cafe. They have seating inside as well as in outside. In inside it is small and cozy area. It is decorated with hanging cattels with light in them. Well i prefer to sit outside. Outside side is smoking area with greenery and there is a swing located right at the end. Staffs are polite and nice but the service is a bit slow. Coming to the food well this place is known for good shakes, smoothies and deserts. But the main course is nothing worth the hype. Specially pizzas it was one of the worst pizza i ever had. The pizza bread was crumbly and dry and it was over roasted too. Overall nice place.

Had an awesome experience. The Location is slightly difficult to trace as you have to take different turns to get to the cafe. But the restaurant is in a serene atmosphere. The music was also cool coinciding with the atmosphere. Coming to food we ordered chicken steak sizzler .In a word it is just mesmerizing. It had chicken pieces stuffed with mixed meat. Nd the hot fumes altogether added a different property to the dish. Altogether it was a good experience.

Well, now I get it. True to its reputation, this place is one of the best to hangout in Calcutta both for its food and the quintessential Adda. From Lasagnes to Shroganoff to its Pizzas to its mouth-watering shakes and mocktails, this place has it all. A Win-Win Cafe all the way. Plus, the much talked about ambience and decor. Will come again.

Settled in a quiet corner in an otherwise busy city , this cafe is a charmer for sure. Blue mug is a relatively small cafe with two seating areas , each adequately provided with seats. On our arrival we opted for the outdoor seating and got a seat readily. However , a little later we wanted to sit inside and were moved within a few minutes. 

Coming to the food , we ordered three dishes. A brownie shake , grilled chicken mayonnaise sandwich and a choco marvel pastry. The service was good and  proper. But it's the taste that's worth the talk. The sandwich had a ample amount of filling with wafers alongside. The proportion were good.In all , a fulfilling dish. The brownie shake was one of the best I have ever had and the choco marvel pastry was too good to be true. 

Great food , great ambience and a great service :) Although personally I loved how they have transformed such a small space into such a beautiful cafe. Totally worth visiting with your friends !

A place which was trending in zomato for a long period of time finally got time to visit there.
1stly if you are confused about it's location just turn on your mobile Gps it will guide you properly. As if you just make jodhpur park boys school as your land mark you may get confused.
It is 10 mins from Abar Bhaithak cafe.
Now coming to the place.
A cute place. Nicely decorated ..with outdoor seating as well as indoor seating facility.
I took the place in the indoors  mainly due to the hot and humid weather  outside.
I liked the decor very much. The hanging  kettles with light in them looked elegant.
Now coming with to the staffs..they were polite  and nice. But the service is very slow i must say.
Now this place is quite pocket friendly...with a large food quantity and nice food quality...
The brownie shake is a must try as its decoration looks elegant.
I tried 
1. The brownie shake - i will rate it 3/5 . Mainly because of it's presentation . But the taste i didnot find too much satisfactory i must say. The taste could have been better.
2. The chicken lolipop.- i will rate 5/5. Yes great in taste. Spicy..with a sweetness in it . It contains 6 pieces . Great in taste.
3. Fish and chips - rating -5/5. Fish fry served with mayo sauce and french fries. Great in taste.
4. The chicken steak - rating 2.5/5. I personally didnt like the sauce by wich the chicken was served. It was xcess sweet..and the chicken was not properly boiled. Not upto the mark.
The dish consisted of boiled veggies with french fries , masala rice and chicken boneless pieces stuffed with keema served with sauce . And yeah the veggies served was not boiled properly. So i didnt like the dish.
5 . The blue mug special sundae- 5/5. Yeah indeed a good dessert to try for.
And my bill was around Rs 1500.
So it proves that the place is pocket friendly.
Nice place indeed..
Can be visited once or twice.

Visited this place today in between my work. It looked like a tiny cafe from outside and initially i was a bit sceptical about entering it. But as i got inside i felt WOW!
It has 2 seating areas..one closed place with ac with beautiful ambiance.. and another small place beside it for the nature lovers..surrounded by potted green plants..i was lucky enough to enjoy a meal amidst the greenery in the rains..a perfect place for a romantic date if its not the typical kolkata hot n humid weather.
Coming to the foods..i was highly disappointed at first because of the unavailability of pizzas even at the beginning of the day.
Nevertheless, we went for a Chicken steak platter and a Peri Peri Chicken..along with Chocolate monk and Mango smoothie. The platters were too delicious and hence we didnt mind missing out the pizza.
The best part of the meal was the cutely dressed up smoothies..!
I am definitely coming back to this place again.

The ambience and decor is really very pretty, especially if you can get the table with the swing outside. We ordered a total of nine dishes and beverages (not kidding üòÇ) and absolutely loved them. The service was a very good too. The pocket-friendly menu is the best part. Overall, a very pretty place.

I went to Cafe Blue Mug with my bf. There the AC room was full and so we were seated outiside. Not a problem. Some people were occupying the swing area that is there outdoors. After they left, we asked if we could shift there. They allowed us and we were comfortably settled on it and were about to place our order when a large party came and they shifted us again to a table for two outdoors. Even then we weren't ready to leave inspite of such humiliation with the sitting arrangement, which should be on first come basis. Anyway. When we finally tried placing our order, they told us that Pizzas are not available because of a dough problem or something. We lost it then. A cafe not serving Pizza to us is blasphemous. We walked out after that.
Finally we lunched at Shawarma Nation where we ate at a much reasonable rate and where we weren't treated poorly. I have no idea why that Blue mug is at all famous.
TL;DR- Don't go to Blue Mug!

Blue mug has been gathering all the fame & momentum in recent times due to the quality of food they are serving to their customers at affordable prices. The place surely doesn't try to compromise on quality & experience. Blue mug is situated inside of jodhpur park but is easily reachable using google maps. The place has a great sitting capacity & is always jam packed with youngsters. The place also scores highly in terms of ambience & decor. Very vibrant & modern,so kudos to that.

So on a sunday evening,my friends & i decided to hit this place to try their lipsmacking food. Upon reaching we had to wait for 15-20mins to get our seats,such was the rush. They have both indoor & outdoor sitting. We were given the outdoor sitting in garden like scenario. Without wasting much time,we ordered the following:-

1. Virgin mojito - Classic virgin mojito was presented in a good quantity. The balance of mint & lime was perfect, the fizz was on the lighter side but still very refreshing. This was certainly enjoyable.

2. Earl grey tea

3. Mexican french fries - A bowlful of generous crunchy mexican spiced french fries served with cheese dip. The french fries were just too good. From the quantity to the balance of flavours to the great dip. Everything was just superb. Recommended.

4. Bbq chicken pizza - 6"(4 slices) normal base pizza was served with bbq chicken strips & roasted capsicums. The taste was good but the pizza bread was not good. The pizza bread was crumbly & dry which did not go well at all.

The place is pocket friendly. The service was great amidst the crowd rush. They charge GST @ 18% but no service charges. Will be going back surely to try their continental dishes ‚úå

Located in an alley in Jodhpur Park, this place is a cozy comfortable cafe with great choice of food and shakes. Being a fan of chocolate, their chocolaty options seemed overly satisfying. We ordered for a Belgian Broth that was light yet spicy.. but what my evening was about is the lasagne.. generous portion.. didn't hold onto the chicken or cheese and was neatly cooked. Brownie points to the brownie shake. However, the long (one hour) wait outside is sort of a mood kill on a humid Sunday evening.

What you absolutely love about this place is the decoration. Other than that the food is satisfactory. They don't create disasters and you won't be disappointed. But none of the items are to die for. All in all a great place to visit. It remains crowded because of the hype, so, not a suitable place for a date.

Food : Okay-ish. People generally visit for the Shakes and Smoothies range. A cool place to chill out with your friends. A bit pricey compared to the quantity and the effort used on each item. Service is okay-ish. Don't really know why all of a sudden, the whole Kolkata youth is creating a lot of buzz regarding this place. Personally would say, this is one of those one-time visit places. Its fancy - yes, has a swing outside - yes, but a lot overhyped. One thing that should be definitely tried out is the Oreo Shake - a speciality of sorts.

This is another place that is making a lot of noise so finally dropped in today. The place was houseful and we had to wait for a good 20-25minutes. We sat outside on the swing. The shakes really are well made. The strawberry one was my favorite. The brownie shake can be made better. The fondue for 120 rs was good just that it can be made a bit thicker. The cheese fish fry suggested by #thebigfatfoodie was really good. The crispy prawns as well. The pizza however was a disappointment. Shared the feedback as well with the server and was told that next time it will be good. Prices are competitive. Overall a good Sunday spent celebrating Friendship Day with childhood friends.

It was a dreadful experience.

Thanks to a rainy weekend, there was a considerable waiting for a table, and we did wait (about 20mins) for the much hyped Blue Mug Cafe experience. First let me mention the food we tried:

1. Crispy Fried Chicken - 4‚≠êÔ∏è
[The crust was well balanced, being just the right spicy and a subtle hint of tangy. Along with the white sauce dip, the 4pcs were quite fun to eat]

2. Chicken Cordon Bleu - 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[They got it just almost perfect. The chicken could have been a tad bit more tender, just a bit. But nonetheless, a definite delight. LOVED the sauce]

3. Oreo Shake - 2‚≠êÔ∏è
[From a standalone perspective, this shake is a good 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è but that's for someone who hasn't had the perfect Oreo shake, which fortunately, I've had just twice in 7 years of my travels all over the country, and my search for one in Kolkata continues]

4. Bacon Sandwich - 0‚≠êÔ∏è
[Probably the first time I'm giving something a 0‚≠êÔ∏è. The slices of bread were actually fried! And I mean greasy fried. And the bacon was a DISASTER. Undercooked, almost not-chewable. I had to leave a quarter of the sandwich because of the disgusting taste and the almost impossible to chew bacon. It has ruined my appetite for the entire evening, and personally I believe this item should definitely be taken off the menu]

Now, let's talk about the service:

The staff is smiling and almost friendly, loved that part. But then they did what one shouldn't have...picked up the plates while even there was food on it, and we were eating it. The rush was apparent at the cafe, but this was utterly unacceptable. They did try to compensate with a plate of fries on the house, a really nice gesture, but was a damage of that magnitude in service leaves a mark. 

The service disaster and to top it off the sandwich killed any interest I had to rate this place anything above 1‚≠êÔ∏è. Definitely not returning to this place. Guess the low price has a hefty price.

This place was on my wishlist since a very long time. A cute little cafe located in Jodhpur Park. Ambience is very nice. The staffs are courteseous. Now coming to the food, we ordered cappuccino, cafe mocha, chicken cordon bleu, honey mustard chicken, bbq chicken pizza, chocolate cone, chocolate monk and blue lagoon. The main courses are yummy. We heard that this place is famous for shakes and desserts. But we are quite dissappointed. All of the desserts are ok type. Over all, it was nice experience.

This place has been the talk of the town for quite some time and they totally deserve the credit. The food, ambience and staff everything was perfect. We visited on the occasion of a friend's birthday. The staff was extremely courteous and we'll mannered. Their small gestures really make you feel welcomed here. 
Coming to the food, it was extremely delicious. Their portions are really lump some and really filling. We ordered a non veg Caesar Salad, Honey Chicken, Grilled Fish Sizzler, Chicken Sizzler, Lamb Chap Sizzler & Penne Pasta. In beverages, Kit Kat Shake which is really hard to finish even by two people and the blueberry smoothie which was beautifully garnished with dry fruits. Each and every dish was perfectly cooked and really well garnished. The chicken sizzler stole the show among them all. Also this place is known for the shakes and smoothies so without a second thought give that a shot cause that'll leave you drooling over for more. The pocket pinch is extremely reasonable.
The decor is very impressive.  There is a outdoor seating arrangement too as the smoking area which has a large swing that gives a homie feeling. Perfect ambience for an adda with your buddies along with lip-smacking food and shakes. Though going by the popularity of this place they sure should think of plans of expanding the place some more. 
Truly one of the best caf√© in South Kolkata. Also I witnessed people of every age group has been hanging out here and not just the youngsters. So do drop in to this wonderful caf√© for a fabulous time with your friends or family.

We went there on last friday after our college hours. It's a nice joint with cosy bright interior and outdoor seating arrangements. We ordered for brownie shake,chicken salami pizza,veg penne pasta with arrabiata sauce , honey mustard chicken and blueberry mousse. Brownie shake was too delicious with brownies and cream. Pizza was with loads of veggies and chicken salami and cheese. But last day's hero was the pasta dish. Too delicious with creamy arrabiata sauce,well seasoned and with loads of veggies.it was heavenly delicious. Then we had honey mustard chicken. It was unique in taste cause those tangy flavours are quite rare. Food quantity was good enough for 3 of us.Food quality is also very good. Prompt service but those people who served food weren't well mannered. Continuously they kept gawking us which was too cheap. -_-

New hangout place for teenagers and college goers. Delectable food and shakes. The swing in the outside seating area is perfect for large groups. Service is good. It's a small request, there is a little furry white cat that strolls in the outside seating area. If you don't like cats then please choose to sit inside. Being fussy and complaining towards it is really unkind when it's you who chose the roofed footpath with your food where it lives.

The food is great. Oreo, kitkat, brownie shakes are highly recommended!
Chicken lollipop, chicken steak, lasagna were of good quality and quantity.

However, the Chicken salami pizza had raw onions which was a total turn off. The pizza crust was hard and chewy.

Tips: The best time to visit this place is during weekdays. Weekends and Sundays usually have long waitings.

Arguably the best cafe in Kolkata at present in terms of food, service and ambience. Every item that we ordered tasted absolutely delicious! And most importantly, our two attendants, Bittu and Deep were very sweet, friendly and helpful. It's because of them and, of course, the excellent food, that we'd definitely visit this place again.
P.S. Their quantity of French fries is bound to bring a smile to your face. Also, do try the chicken salami pizza.

This new sensation, Blue Mug Cafe is turning out to be in every foodie's wishlist, every visitor's recommendation & I hope it keeps living up to the expectations of all :)

Ambience is soothing & carefully prepared, though we weren't allowed to sit in the ac part with a lame excuse of booked seats! Grudges!

Service is good & courteous!

Quite pocket-friendly if you know the rates of most Kolkata restaurants!

Now, coming to the main part- the FOOD. üòç
There are lot of varieties to choose from, in comparison to that offered by other cafes & most of them won't disappoint you a tiniest bit :)
We first ordered Honey Mustard Chicken & Chicken Salami Pizza. One of their staffs suggested, Bbq Chicken Pizza would be better & we replaced our order. Now, next time if I find that Chicken Salami Pizza was better, I would decrease my rating for this manipulation! üòÇ

Bbq Chicken Pizza- exquisite, deliiiiicious, heavenly! The best pizza that had entered my stomach.. üòò

Honey Mustard Chicken - Tastes great, only if you like sweet flavour. üòá

It was raining cats & dogs and we were in a hurry as well, so that wasn't the perfect mood for having a sundae or smoothie, as we planned. But we ordered simple chocolate ice-creams to be finished off quickly. Now, this was again a brilliant thing which I will definitely recommend if you are low on budget, coz it costs just Rs. 40 üòé

Complaints- Space is really constricted & plates are small. Tables should have been little bit wider.

The best cafe I have visited till now. Few of my friends had recommended this place some time back and while they were describing the place I kept wondering why are they so excited about this place. Well all of my wonders and questions were answered the moment I had visited the place. Situated in Jodhpur park, one cam easily hire an uber from the metro station and visit here.

They have seating inside as well as outside. We preferred to sit outside because 1) it was a smoking area and 2) it had an amazing decor. They had a swing located right at the end which we had occupied. Now coming to the food.

OREO SHAKE-- this piece of love was the best ever milkshake ever tried. Topped with oodles of whipped cream and choco sauce and oreo biscuits it was a delicacy one has to try. The entire shake was served in a mason jar which added a better look.

BROWNIE SHAKE-- I must admit it was more of a candy to the eye. It looked way pretty with bits and slices of brownies delicately places on whipped cream and at the topmost was placed a piece of walnut. The shake was quite refreshing.

BLUEBERRY SMOOTHIE-- this pretty pink drink was served in a champagne glass which was initially decorated with blueberry jelly above which the smoothie was poured and topped with blueberries and other dry fruits. This was equally amazing.

CHIPOTLE BBQ WINGS SIZZLER-- served in a sizzler platter with fries. The preparation gave us one hell of a foodgasm. Tasted heavenly with right mixture of spices and bbq sauce. The delicacy was as tasty as it's look promised us.

CHICKEN LASAGNE-- I am not sure I can describe exactly how it tasted as the moment I am trying to write about the dish I can see it in front of me and my hunger pangs have started to ring already. Again which foodie doesn't like cheese and mozzarella? The chicken pieces infused in the dish were well prepared and cooked before hand and we could feel them in every bite.

MEXICAN BALL-- again one more dish which was presented in a very beautiful way. Veggie tossed rice was served along with the bowl of mushroom and corn and other veggies prepared in mexican sauce. Okay one precaution if you are not into hot and spicy the food was waaaaaay too hot and spicy and it literally burned our stomach. So a bit disappointed here. The only reason I could not rate it an extra 0.5.

APRICOT CHICKEN WINGS-- okay I am already tired of describing how amazing each and every dish was here. The tender chicken wings pieces were prepared in a very tasty apricot sauce and my first expression was why does this even taste this good? The chicken was perfectly cooked while itself remaining juicy and tasty.

CHOCOLATE CONE-- the last item finally. Breaking the conventional way of presenting an ice cream in a biscuit cone this was one of a kind with the outer layer made of chocolate. The inner layer had three parts. The topmost consisted of icecream topped with chocolate sprinklers, then comes the cake layer infused with rainbow sprinklers and such other confectionery items, the last layer is plain icecream though some part of me wished it to be pure hard chocolate. Nevertheless it was one tasty dessert which one will not want to share at all.
 
Second visit consisted of the following items.

FISH FRY-- they served the fish fries along with mayo and french fries. The dish was tasty and was perfect as an appetizer. The fish filling was soft and tasty.

CHICKEN STEAK SIZZLER-- this probably has been their best main course item of the ones I have tried till date. A huge breast piece of chicken, slow cooked in flavouring ingredients and tasty sauces was served in a sizzler platter along with french fries and veggies.

KITKAT SHAKE-- when it comes to shakes and smoothies blue mug has never disappointed it's customers. This was yet another exotic looking innovative shake from their kitchen. Blended pieces of kitkat was found in every sip, topped with fresh whipping cream and choco sauce and to add the signature look to it, pieces of kitkat were placed on top of the entire arrangement. 

Coming to the overall experience here. I will recommend this place to each and every friend asking for suggestions. The staff were courteous but they lacked communication skills. The place is quite pocket friendly .The only thing that disappointed us was they took a lot of time to serve the dish and we were very hungry. But yes would love to visit them once again.

Well this a dingy outlet in Jodhpur park.The staffs asked us to take our seats outside as all the seats inside were preoccupied . As regards the outside seating, arrangements were absolutely perfect with air-coolers except for the persistent disturbance by few hornets. Landed in this predicament situation, we could not eat properly. Somehow we gobbled up our foods and hurried to leave. Therefore I wud ask the management to see that the ornamental trees  set up in the  outdoor seating are properly taken care of. Use insecticides or smoke or pesticides to avoid hornets. It simply added to our woe as we were afraid of being attacked. 
Now coming to the food,they tasted damn delicious. They were both good to see and taste. Served in proper quantity with an effing good quality ,the foods are sure to satisfy your taste buds. Price is reasonable. We ordered for tulip mousse, chocolate cone, chicken steak sizzler and blue lagoon. 
Had we not been annoyed by the presence of hornets, we could have thought of making our second visit.

I prefer sitting outdoors when I visit this outlet..the staff are friendly and courteous. As the swing was occupied we had to sit in the chairs..we ordered a pinacolada which was refreshing, but I've had better. We had the brownie shake and I loved the jar in which it came. Being not very hungry, we had the chicken steak sizzler and found it to be delicious!!! Tender chicken steak cut into pieces with a delectable sauce with fries and veggies was our showstopper that day..‚ù§. And the pocket pinch was really less! Around 600 bucks..üòäüòäüòä

Decor: Small and cozy.
Food : We had ordered 
1. Virgin Mojito- My personal favourite since it gives a cooling effect.
2. Lamb Penne Pasta ( with white sauce and bread) - It was juicy and delicious, loved it. A must have dish on the menu. But the bread could have been ginger bread instead of the normal one.
3. Bbq chicken Pizza - It has a smoky smell and the loaf is thick but super soft( last time it was hard). Highly delectable and a must have. 
4. Brownie milk shake (as suggested by Blue Mug) - A  mason jar filled with chocolate  shake, topped with brownie and cream. It seemed like "heaven on earth". A must have for the ones who love chocolate irrevocably. Im going again for this one. 
 
In a nutshell, the overall experience was good. I will go again to try the sizzler since many people were ordering it.

Although I desperately wanted to rate this restaurant as excellent but I could not .

Speaking about the food , all of the items were damn tasty and the quality deserves to be rated as excellent. We ordered Tulip mousse , Chocolate cone , Chicken steak sizzler and blue lagoon. The price range is quite reasonable here.

As regards the ambience , the place is too small and dingy inside and the outdoor seating is not well facilitated . Today we took a table for two and unfortunately had no option but outdoor seating . But , there were so many hornets due to the trees which are so poorly maintained .

Due to constant harrasment by the hornets we had to gobble up our food and leave .

Although the food was good but the place is not worth a second visit .

It's different!!!
The flavours of the different dishes have a uniqueness at this place.

We started off with

Crunchy garlic stuffed mushrooms: these are fried balls of garlicy mushroom with were crispy outside and soft within. Served with mayonnaise. It was very good.

Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce : it was a fillet of grilled bhetki. Served with creamy mashed potatoes, veggies, rice and the lemon butter sauce. It was an awesome dish. I really loved it.

Chicken lasagna: creamy cheesy and awesome. I found one of the best lasagnas in the city and at such a reasonable price!!! Full marks to it.

Oreo shake:: this was too chocolatey, too great. Could not have it less.

Coffee with ice cream:: this was yet another wonderful thing.

I need to visit here quite often.

Went there with a friend. The place seemed to be quite a hit among people. Decor and ambience okayish, we sat outside as the lounge was full. Now coming to the food.. We ordered chicken steak sizzler,  Virgini mojito, choco marvel pastry and coconut mousse. 

Chicken steak sizzler - awesome.. The right proportion and everything 

Virgin mojito - normal

Choco marvel pastry - give me a good soft chocolate pastry with some molten chocolate by the side and I am home. Loved it no wonder. 

Coconut mousse - this as told by the waiters is a new dessert they have introduced and not included in menu yet. It's served in a small daab with basically the daab malai cut and mixed with whipped cream. Didn't like it. 

Would like to try their pizza next time I visit(the table beside us ordered the pizza which looked yummy :p)

This amazing little wonderland is located close to Jodhpur Park Boys' School , and has outdoor seating , which is the choice of most of the cafe hoppers who come here. The wooden seats outside give one the feel of a typical cafe, and the interiors are equally interesting for those of you who prefer to stay indoors. The lights here are quirky , and give a DIY feel to the place . The service here is fairly slow. The food here is good , especially the shakes , which look very pretty. The cappuccino is served straight from the heart , that's painted in the middle of the cup. The brownie shake has a huge chunk of brownie goodness topped with layers of cream , and a thick shake below. The Oreo shake tastes just as amazing , with layers of cream and Oreo biscuits on top of a jar of chocolaty goodness !  The shakes come in mini glass jars. Do beware of the sweetness content of these shakes , as one whole glass might  leave the not-so-sweet-toothed a tad too sugary-mouthed. The apricot chicken wings have a mildly sweet taste . The chicken nachos taste good too , with cheese and ham or other extra toppings as per your choice. The club sandwich has four pieces of bread with chicken filling, is served with chips , and tastes average . The place is great for conversation , and the seats are comfy , so you can talk to your friend or family and have a good time too! Do aim for the outdoor seats here , if the weather if fine , and the swing is bound to be an average adda lover's chosen seat in this little heaven in the heart of South Kolkata !

The best thing about blue mug is their quantity. Some dishes are really good and some are mediocre , but overall it's high on value for money . Their taxes are usually high though. The blue lagoon was equivalent to the size of pitcher . The decor is really innovative . The only problem which I find is their waiting, specially during weekends.

Ambience is suited to fit the moods of youngsters and college students, very cheap ambience...not at all suitable if you want some quiet and calm, or elegance. 

A part of the kitchen is within the seating area...as a result, the noise of blenders, mixers and others is too overwhelming. The chairs are not suitable for comfortable sitting. The sizzlers are horrible...dry chicken. This is not good as a cafe. The shakes look nice but the taste is worse than street milk shake. Even CCD has better shakes. Only the food is attractive. This will go well with the young, unpolished generation...cheap food, nice appearances. 

Wise owl cafe, Paris cafe, Q33 are far far better as cafes, this is more of a food joint. Don't think I will visit again. 1.5 stars only for the vegetables and french fries. And the manager is very very well behaved. Even offered to serve another dish of sizzler because of my disappointment.

This place had been on my wishlist for a really really long time. So I was more than excited when a friend of mine decided to accompany me. 

The restaurant has an interior seating area as well as an exterior one. Since it was quite hot and humid we wanted to sit on the inside. But sadly it was absolutely full. On asking the manager if we could for the time being sit outside and then later be shifted to the inside once a place gets empty, he told us it wasnt possible. According to him, either we need to wait for the place to clear up, or else remain seated where we choose the first time once we order the food. This made me angry, but i decided to let it go. Luckily we did get the swing seat, so it was okay. 

Now coming to the order :

‚óá Orange Spicer - Do not go for this unless you are a fan of green tea.
‚óá Orange Blossom - LOVED it. Highly recommended.
‚óá Cheese Fondue - It was really really good. The dip as well as the bread crumbs were very fresh. 
‚óáVeg Sizzler - Okayish.
‚óáGrilled Fish Sizzler - The sauted vegetables were disappointing. The fish was alright. Nothing I would order again.

More or less, the place has an amazing chilled out ambience, but the quality and quantity of food is not worth the hype.

To start off this review, I'd want to mention a few things that stuck out and got my attention. The ambience is decent, well lit, has an outdoor and an indoor seating arrangement. (We chose to sit in the indoors air conditioned area.) There is a piano and guitar present(for budding musicians) and the place is neatly decorated and furnished. A Scorpion's fan would love the music cause i was in there for almost two hours and that's all i heard(wouldn't hurt to mix up the music a bit, plenty of low key prog rock, alt rock bands to choose from.)
Now comes the fun part, the food.
We ordered a kitkat shake and an oreo shake.
Looks delicious on the outside. Taste is decent, nothing too overwhelming. The kitkat shake had chunks of fresh cream inside it(which i don't think any shake should contain). The oreo shake on the other hand, didn't. I prefer consistency.the only  chunk of cream I prefer is the whipped cream dressing on top.
To top things off, well, i couldn't even season my nachos with black pepper as nothing would come out of the microscopic opening on the top(a picture of the dreaded shaker is added. I feel i shaked it more than what they did with the shake and still none of the staff noticed it and offered me another pepper shaker; disappointed). And they should serve the nachos with a dip on the side instead of smearing some cheese and tomatoes on the top and calling it a sasla. Steaks are supposed to be juicy, and not smothered with gravy. And the Caesar salad lacked seasoning.
In one line, 
More hype, less on the delivery.

Was eager to try out this cafe for quite sometime!
There was no problems in finding the cafe.
Inside there are two types of seating arrangements, one being the lounge outside and the other is the usual indoor. 
Decided to try the lounge. It was a good experience!

Now coming to the food. I ordered Irish Coffee and my friend ordered Oreo shake. It did take quite bit of time for the drinks to arrive. 
The Irish coffee was a first for me and being someone who thrives on black tea and espresso coffee, it was too sweet for my taste. Was quite tough for me to finish it. 
The Oreo shake on the other hand was really good! We expected it to be the usual shake with two oreos placed on top. It was nothing like it! The presentation was excellent with cream on top. Yes there were oreos in the drink, but that came much later. It tasted pretty good!
We ordered honey mustard chicken next.
It comprised of a big piece of chicken with french fries and rice. I was skeptical if it would be enough for the two of us. It turned out to be more than enough! And the chicken laced with honey and a hint of mustard tasted great! 
Finally we ordered (after much pondering) Blueberry mousse! It was pretty to look at but was okayish in taste.

Overall its a cool place to try out. Prices are more or less in the reasonable range. Considering how small the cafes are these days, its good to see Blue Mug not following suit.

Well, I paid a visit since I heard about this place more than enough of times over my stay here in Calcutta for the last three years, and it was ridiculously funny to find out how the management, staff and catering go blind on a Saturday!
If you've waited for over twenty minutes and they still let people who arrived after you, a seat, you'd never want to be here again.
Looked good, but still can't believe it that they cannot manage it on a day even they might have not expected their outlet to break houseful!

Located at the junction of Jodhpur Park and Lake Gardens,this establishment is an ideal place to meet up with friends and share a meal.
Their items are fairly priced.
They maintain quality in their sandwiches,burgers and pizzas.
Found a customer complaining about their lamb sizzler.
Their elaborate shakes are eye-catching.
The indoor seating capacity is limited and they have an outdoor area for those who smoke.
Service was satisfactory.

Went to this little amazing place on a rainy evening. The interiors seemed attractive. We chose to sit outside. The ambience was nice and comfortable. We ordered a chicken sizzler, a kitkat shake and Brownie shake. The sizzler  disappointed us a bit. It was nowhere near to what it looked like. But then the shakes were heavenly. The Brownie shake was one amazing thing I never had before. Would visit once again just for this Brownie shake :)

The balsamic Blue mug, a small but beautifully decorated cafe, surrounded with bushy trees is located in jodhpur park near abar baithak cafe and serves some beautifully decorated and extremely delicious food items which will surely implant love for this place in the minds of the visitors!!
Visited here twice and they had satiated my mind and big fat belly completely...
We had blueberry shake, kulfi shake, apricot chicken wings, bruschetta, Margherita pizza and some other items also and each of the items was absolutely lip smacking and mouth watering...
Especially the pizza had an epicurean taste which can surely satisfy the taste bud of any pizza lover...
The apricot chicken wings, mocktails and shakes are absolutely delectable as well...
The outdoor sitting arrangement is the best part of this place...
Having such delicious foods amidst of greens is absolutely an euphoric experience!!

Ordered cappuccino(satisfactory) and lemon mint tea( not so impressive,have had better at other places). 
Bt coming to the food,they were well-prepared.
1.Chicken mixed bolognese sauce pasta-was delicious but portion could have been better.
2.Choco marvel pastry-its actually marvellous with the chocolate ganache oozing out in ur mouth and melting perfectly.close to perfection üôÇ

It was a Sunday rainy afternoon and me and friend decided to spend the evening at this place. when we reached it was 6:15 pm and there was already a waiting list. The manager told us to wait about 20-25 minutes.¬† I was not willing to wait that much time but my friend insists. During this time the manager came 2 times and request to wait for the seat. He was very polite and he told us that because of the crowd they also stopped taking online bookings. At last we got a table at 6:50 pm. There were two section, indoor seating and outdoor seating and we got a table outside. The place was impressive. Personally I liked the outdoor seating arrangement because I thought indoor arrangement was little loud.Now came to food part. We ordered One Coffee one chocolate monk and one chicken salami pizza. The coffee and the mocktail¬† was up to my expectation but the Pizza was just terrible. The ambience was good and the staff were polite specially the manager. We may be try this place again only for the coffee and mocktail. They charged 18% GST.

You guys might be doing a wonderful job in dishing out food at affordable prices and pulling large crowds on a daily basis however you have forgotten to train your staff so as to treat customers with respect and most importantly to respect women. It is a common practice for waiters to talk about the visiting customers in the privacy of the kitchen and share a light laughing moment however it is ABSOLUTELY NOT ACCEPTABLE to OPENLY make your women customers feel uncomfortable by laughing aloud and pointing and gesturing openly to each other to such an extent that they are embarrassed and want to leave immediately!¬†

At the end of the day, more than the food, it is the service that makes the experience and I'm sure you know this too that for customers like us, there is no dearth of cafes in Kolkata which are inexpensive, beautiful and know how to treat their customers well :-)!

I hope you get well soon!

If you have way too much time in hand, please visit this place. According to the staff's logic here , 1/2 an hour of waiting time = 2 hours or more. So, be prepared.

If you're lucky enough to finally get a table, don't expect your wait to be worth it. The food is simple and there is absolutely nothing outstanding about it. I had a Chicken barbeque burger and it was the most ordinary burger I've ever had.

I feel it to be  a ridiculously overrated place. If you still want to go ahead and visit, good luck!

We visited this place on. Saturday afternoon. It was almost full. The place is beautifully decorated and very clean. The ambiance was a bit too loud as per our taste. We ordered cream of chicken soup, Mexican french fries and lamb sizzler. The Soup and french fries tasted yummy. The fries came with a Spicy Mayo dip. But the lamp dish was a big disappointed. The french fries served with lamb was soggy. The lamb was full of bones and there  was hardly any meat. The taste was also very average. Although it was pocket friendly, still expected the food to better.

Small but nice cafe in the heart of Jodhpur park. There are two seating arrangements. Indoor and outdoor. When we visited the place, outdoor seating was full so we had to seat inside. Though the decoration is simple and this place is not so spacious, but we liked the cafe somehow. Varieties of desserts and shakes and smoothies dragged us actually. We ordered has brown potato wuth mayonnaise dip, chicken steak sizzler. In mocktails, we ordered Chocolate monk and for desserts we ordered hot sizzling brownie with ice cream. We loved all the dishes. And the price is also not so high. So we will visit this cafe again to taste the other dishes and desserts.

Given the hype surrounding the restaurant, i was expecting to be blown away by the food but i was disappointed. The food was strictly average. In fact out of all the food that we ordered, the cheese fish fry was the only saving grace. ¬†The honey chicken was the biggest downer. The barbecue chicken burger was strictly average and ¬†the virgin mojito was fine. I found the staff to be very courteous.

LOCATION - It was a bit tedious to find out the exact location as the cafe was stucked up in an alleyway much inside jp. Went there on a weekday afternoon to find the small cafe fully filled with people . Waited for more than 30 mins before getting a table inside !

DECORATION - A cute little place dimly lit up with kettle-lights .Both outside and inside seating arrangements available , though sitting inside is more preferable as outside ones may attract flies . The music was loud .All Bengali movie songs were being played when we visited. There was a guitar and a few collection of books which I found to be unnecessary as nobody can possibly read a book there when there's so much music in the background and so many happenings going around !

SERVICE - Though some chairs were empty the staff didn't ask us to sit , they were more busy catering to other customers and meanwhile we ourselves had to ask another customer to share 2 seats to which they happily obliged , while we waited for our table.
Finally after getting a table , we saw some more tables get empty (where previously 2 people were sitting in a 4-seater table) . Since we were carrying large bags we asked them since so many 4 tables r empty now if we can shift. They first rejected our request and the manager himself came and apologised to us saying they can't give 4-seater seat to 2 people( though previously only 2 people were sitting ). Meanwhile 2 people came without any bags and whoa! they were given 4 seater table! I was surprised and confronted the staff for such partiality . Finally they apologised and gave us another empty 4seater table . Now common man, don't be so partial towards your customers !! I had reasons , I was carrying large bags n u deny me n give others who were not carrying any bags ????
The staffs need to be trained more- to be attentive towards each customer's needs and be more knowledgeable regarding their work.

FOOD - Anyways after the matter was sorted we waited for our food . The CHICKEN LOLLIPOP took ages to arrive . It was cooked well with red spicy sauce . The chicken was juicy and overall it was a good dish .
Next we ordered FISH FINGER which was served with fries and mayo . I liked this one more . It was very tasty . For our sweet cravings we had the much famous CHOCO MARVEL PASTRY and the CHOCO CONE. Choco marvel pastry was the Star of the day , served warm and melted in a bed of hot choco sauce . Choco cone wasn't that appeasing -more like an icecream and a bit of brownie encased in a hard choco crust , and felt rather flat compared to the pastry .

PRICE - They charge 18% GST and our bill was around 600 for 2. Not very pricey , not very affordable- somewhere in the middle.

Blue Mug is a cafe which has earned a lot of reputation in a very short time. A bit OVERHYPED though- found nothing extraordinary there . Favourite place of the youth . Excepting the chaos at table it was a decent experience for us . Wud like to visit there to try out other dishes. The choco marvel pastry simply won my heart- going to have it again .

Visited this place with my friends after hearing a lot of good stuffs from people.The ambience of this place was magnificent. The staffs were good. We ordered a chicken salami pizza, blueberry pastry, black forest pastry and a choco marvel pastry. The pizza was small and a bit burnt. The black forest pastry tasted okay. The choco marvel pastry tasted damn delicious. The blueberry pastry was the star among everything we ordered. It tasted heavenly‚ù§. If anyone wants to experience really great dessert one must give a try to this place. We will definitely give another visit to this place to try the shakes and the steaks.

Blue Mug Cafe located near Jodhpur park is definitely one of the best cafes in Kolkata. It has been really long that I have given a 5 star rating to a cafe but this I simply couldn't resist giving one. I have visited this place numerous times in the last couple of months. With it's soothing ambience, courteous staff, reasonable price and absolutely amazing food, this place is a must visit for everyone in the City of Joy. üòä

The sauce of the sizzler was really yum and we enjoyed it very much. Overall this place is really nice and I loved it! Would love to go back some other time and try the shakes!

Imagine rain. The petrichor. A silent neighbourhood. Some lives chasing their shadows. Imagine all of this while you sit comfortably within the confines of utopia. Partly yours. Mostly man made. Let's name that utopia Blue Mug. Cutely tucked amidst the deafening silence of the Jodhpur Park commune, this cafe breathes exuberance. It is not loud. Not at all. Not garrish. Nope.. It does not even take itself seriously. It's laid back conformity is reminiscent of the city it thrives in. All this and more before the Chicken Grill Steak arrives. The fizz and the aroma is good enough to wipe away most monsoon blues. The steak sizzler comes in five cubes, though six is what I would advice as a future improvement, and is almost sufficient for two. The saut√©ed veggies and the crisp french fry will do the rest. 
Now if that had not filled your gastronomic pang, make the fatal error by ordering the super 8 chocolate milkshake. Be warned. Death by chocolate has never been so lustful. The shake is a sin. It's hugeness is overwhelming and for those who intend to savour smoothies and milkshakes, this piece of art is a massacre. The hint of mint concocted with thick chocolate is what a perfect afterlife should feel like. Or rather taste like.
The super 8 is what I will suggest to be put on every bucket list. Feel it while the heart beats.
So the next time you roam about the green confines of Jodhpur Park, try out some ebbulence. Visit Blue Mug. 
Some moments will be worth remembering.

We heard a lot about this place, so definitely I was very psyched to be here. The ambience is really cool and happening, the decor just takes you to chill mode. The Hanging Antiquity bottles, blue light, the wall paintings and the couches are just perfect for you to sit with your friends and have a go at chilling. We ordered Penne pasta with White sauce and a veg burger first, veg lasagna was not available. Later we ordered a veg club sandwich also. Surprising to us none of the food were special, burger was cold so was the sandwich, pasta lacked salt. The food really took me by surprise, thought it would be way better. Didn't get the courage to order more. And the man taking orders was forgetting our orders again and again, the servings were super late, even after reminding him what we ordered, it took them ages.
It's perfect for college goers,not much pocket-pinching with a decent ambience, it's crowded in the evening, so if planning to go there, take time in your hand..

P.S- I again went today , just to see if their non-veg items are actually good enough , well I ordered Honey mustard chicken , chicken lasagne , chocolate brownie . Lasagne was really mouth watery , I loved how the honey mustard chicken melted in my mouth . Dessert was equally good . This time the food offered were hot . I am finally satisfied . üòÅ

Went there on a lazy evening... this place is located in one of the by lanes of Jodhpur park  ( a bit  difficult for me to find as I am so much confused with the similar looking lanes of Jodhpur park). Had to wait for around 30 minutes to get a seat. Even after 30 minutes we got an outdoor table. Coming to the food we ordered blue lagoon and fresh lime soda which was okay. Nothing extraordinary. Next came the barbeque chicken burger. Amazingly tasteful and filling. The chicken was tender and juicy, the veggies were fresh. Loved it. Would visit the place again very soon.

In our search of the best lasagne in the city, Blue Mug is at No.1 on the list right now. And we've done a fair share of research just by the way. My experience at this place was an amazing one. Beautiful decor, prompt service and AMAZING food. We had to wait for our turns to sit at the air conditioned side of the cafe , but we did have prior information about that so wasn't an issue. We had ordered for a lasagne, a chicken sizzler steak, onion rings, Darjeeling first flush since I am a tea-o-holic and virgin mojito. The tea was absolutely gorgeous and if you are a tea lover as I am, you should definitely try this. And it's served with great care too. The sizzler steak was 3.75/5. It was pretty good, but could have used more flavour from the sauces. It was served with a good amount of fries. The onion rings were delish. It says "6 pieces" in the menu but we were served with an entire basket full, pleasant surprise. Coming to the lasagne, it was a plate full of cheesy goodness. One should most definitely Try the lasagne at this place, it will be worth it, I promise. The virgin mojito was served beautifully as well. 
I loved the concept of the live drinks counter. 
I am most definitely going back for the lasagne! Love this place..

It's been long since I've given any restaurant a 5 but this one I simply couldn't resist giving one! We went there today afternoon. Though we had to walk a bit but the place was worth it! When we entered the Cafe, it was almost full barring one to two places. Well on settling down we took a lot time to take our decision on what to order though the staff there didn't rush us.!

Coming to the ambience , the room was kind of blue which made the place great for the eye keeping in mind the outside temperature! The ambience in total gave a soothing feel though a few customers were sitting in the fooding place outside the restaurant where they neatly arranged a wonderful seating area! A total 5 for the ambiance!


We settled for a blue lagoon, a penne cream chicken pasta and club chicken sandwich‚Äã which simply made our day! Not being a pasta fan, hesitantly I on the request of my bff took the item! The rest two were my choice though!
Well even if you're not a pasta fan you're deemed to fall in love with the extremely creamy pasta they provide and the huge amount of chicken with it! They even provided bread with the pasta which made it even more  interesting! The blue lagoon was simply heaven! Though heaven would be a term less for it! The only item which was less heavenly was the sandwiches though it might be for the fact that our apetite was full..rather more than full! But hey there was enough of the sandwiches accompanied by  chips  and sauce! Yum! So a complete rating of the order would be something like this:

Blue lagoon:5/5(though the numerator could be infinity too!) üòù
Pasta:5/5!
Chicken club sandwiches:4.5/5.( This figure could just be because our apetite was more than full)!

Coming to the pocket pinch this is the ultimate place for students where you order more, pay less! They have a 18% GST (9% CGST + 9%SGST) but the total bill was an astonishing amount of Rs.550! So a huge 5 on this point! I'd love to come back again to try the different dishes!

Highly recommended!

Went on sunday and faced a long queue before us..somehow managed a seat.. then ordered
Chicken steak sizzler which was amazing in taste, chicken was soft served with some french fries and boiled veggies..
My friend ordered chicken lasagne which was also very cheesy and the quantity was very good...
Then comes the main attraction brownie shake which was very chocolatey and mind blowing in taste and quite enough for 2 person...
I would recommend everyone to atleast visit the place once.

Cozy kind of place with a space for around 30peaple and has an open place to sit as well with a similar sitting capacity. We had a cappucino, masala omlette, brownie shake, choclate frappe and everything was good and value for money. Would like to go again and try different dishes pretty soon.

This was undoubtedly an exclusive Discovery for a food freak like me! Hidden amidst the small lanes o Jodhpur park Blue Mug Caf√© has an extraordinary charm with Amazing dishes. I especially like their cocktails nd beverages. The place is quite small so there are tables outside as well. Believe it or not, by the evening it was all swarming with young crowd all waiting for tables! I was quite amused by the taste o the food they serve. It's delicious guys! We had ordered a pizza, a chicken steak sizzler nd an all day English breakfast. 
Surely deserves frequent visits. üíñ

The location is a bit troublesome so rely heavily on Google maps. It is located inside the residential area of Jodhpur Park. The route we took was the lane beside Ledar Land, opposite South City mall, and walked straight for about 10mins from there.
When we stepped in, it seemed like seating might be a problem since the place was already quite packed, but after juggling once between outdoor and indoor, we were given a table indoors. The decor in both the areas were beautiful. Inside the walls have blue kettle lamps, coir lamps, and wine bottle lamps, the walls adorned with pictures, a book shelf, a piano, and guitar. There ware really soothing, mainstream Bollywood tracks playing in the background. All of them just added to the leisurely feel of the caf√©.

Coming to the food, we ordered:
Barbecue Chicken Pizza (Rs. 170 for 4 slices): I hate thin crust pizzas and the crust was really to my liking (not sure about whether it was handmade or not). The barbecue sauce is on the sweeter side, which complements the slightly fiery peppers and succulent chicken chunks well. Loved it! ‚ù§
Chicken Steak Sizzler (Rs. 230 for a steak, blanched vegetables, French fries and a mushroom jus): the chicken steak was cut up into 6 slices, so it was convenient for us to share. The French fries and vegetables were also well done. Main highlight was the sauce that was just lovely, very wintery and full of flavour. The only complaint I had is that the chicken stuffing inside the steak (seemed more like a roulade) was a tad bit overcooked, so really needed a little more of the sauce which was a little sparse so had to scrape off the platter. Would really prefer if it came with some bread but there was no option of adding it either.
Black Forest pastry (Rs 50 for a wedge, not in picture): did not like it at all. The cake seemed crumbly and not moist, despite the cherry coulis that is inside. And it was very sweet, topped with extra whipped cream. I'd advise against it. Maybe should have tried some other pastry.
Brownie Shake (Rs 180 for a mason jar): perhaps the most photogenic and delicious of all the items! The shake is topped with generous amounts of whipped cream and 4 slices of brownies, resting on a thick layer of chocolate fudge, under which was the thick, creamy shake. Perfectly sweetened, it was enough to fill your entire stomach if you're having it alone. But it's very tricky to have it without making a complete mess but the staff there was courteous enough to give us a plate where we could separate the elements to taste each of them distinctly, as well as together. And they were the perfect blend! Loved this one too, definitely having this again! ‚ù§
Pocket pinch is slightly on the higher side but the food is generous and worth every penny. Does not just satiate your hunger, but touches your soul. They added 18% GST to the bill, since we were inside the AC part, don't know if the same applies to the outdoor section.
Team Blue Mug, keep it up! Definitely highly recommended and would visit again! üåà

Food is not bad but the service is terribly slow.. We were hungry & dropped in.. Unfortunately had to wait for more than an hour for a sandwich.. That too after 50 minutes of waiting, I asked to cancel my order.. The manager requested to wait.. After another 20-25 minutes they got the sandwich.. We had to get the sandwich packed as we got late waiting for it..

I was searching out for a good cafe to chill out with a long friend of mine. I came across 'blue mug' and thought of giving it a try.

The ambience is good, with live instrumental music and some hugely loved songs in the playlist.

The decoration is very funky and will grab you on the first go.

Coming to food, we had ordered chicken penne pasta in creamy pesto sauce which tasted really good and the quantity was sufficient for two. Next we had bbq chicken pizza, which had it's crust the exact crisp. We then had chicken cordon bleu which according to zomato is one of the best things there and we werent let down with it. In drinks, we ordered chocolate monk and blueberry smoothie. Also, the cost is very pocket friendly.

The staff were quite well mannered and served us well.
The only thing is lack of space.

Otherwise the overall experience was satiating.

Blue Mug recently became a good place for hangout for the youth of Kolkata. The ambience is attractive and I do not know why the restaurant is rated poorly for the service. Service is really good. 
Coming to the food, the Brownie Shake and Sea food sizzler was awesome. The pizza could be better. However, in my opinion this place is a bit costly.

Blue Mug is a place which gives you the feeling of relaxing to good music and also satiating your cravings thanks to their menu. An excellent ambience complete with cute kettles as lampshade and a warm lighting.
Tried the Lamb Chap sizzler, though the lamb was soft and juicy but was a bit disappointed with the piece served.
Seafood Platter sizzler was really good. A platter of basa, bhetki and prawns on skewers with nicely smoked bell peppers. French fries which was really crispy added a nice touch to the sizzlers.
Icing on the cake was the Lasagna. Perfectly baked, cheesy and stuffed with chicken this is bound to give you food coma or should I say 'pasta coma'.
The quantity and quality of each dish is really impressive.
Oreo shake was a bit watery but the presentation was beautiful. Brownie shake is highly recommended, thick, chocolaty and topped with a piece of brownie it is clear winner in the shakes category.

A small cafe in the residential area Of Jodhpur Park. There's not much public transport connection. There's two sitting arrangement - Outdoor n Indoor. In both the space is very less and cramped.

When we went the place was packed. Shows how popular it has become within a very short time. We ordered Chocolate Monk , Oreo Shake, Blueberry Smoothie & Blue Mug special Sundae. They were just awesome. We couldn't have enough. The presentations were cute and the taste just great.
My favourite was the Chocolate Monk.
Would definitely recommend for it's food and would like to try out other dishes as well.

A quaint little corner around a curvy cornerrr!! That defines this cafe "Blue mug" that is actually not blue! I tried the chicken clu sandwich that turned out to be satisfactory. The margarita pizza was not bad either! What actually stood out was actually the feeling of sitting in outer area and sipping that capuccino while the breeze swayed away my stress! Note: even if the inside space is empty, get yourself seated in the open area, preferably on that "jhula"

This caf√© has been in my wish list for a long time. An awesome place among the solitary lanes of jodhpur Park. We visited there on a Monday afternoon...it's a perfect place to beat the monday blues with some delicious food. They provide a fine indoor as well as outdoor sitting with an excellent interior decor. The staffs were very friendly.
We ordered cuppachino , after 8 shake, chicken steak sizzler and a blueberry mousse. After 8 shake was too good...It was the combination of chocolate and mint .the chicken steak sizzler had a unique taste which was heavenly and the cuppachino was like normal coffee. Lastly we wanted to have a strawberry or tulip mousse but both of them was unavailable so we ordered a blueberry mousse which was quite good in taste. 
Overall the experience was quite nice and satisfying.

Kudos to the organisers of this place for getting almost overnight fame! Mark my words on it, this place has the compelling power!
Unlike other cafes, all items in this place have uniqueness in their taste and will surely make you crave for more. Ambience has the perfect charm that compliments the food more! Certainly cherished every moment and wanna try the whole menu soon...

It was a small date with my partner after a long gap so our expectation was high. But we really disappointed with their food and service too. We order one Blueberry smoothie and Mocha. The coffee was good but the Blueberry smoothie was ok type. Then our next order was cheesy fondue. This dish took 45 minutes to come on our table. After taking so much time the cheese sauce was not at all cheesy. Then we ordered grilled fish lemon butter sauce served with saute veg and  french fries. The fish was good  but the french fries was soggy.  next we ordered brownie with ice cream. We didn't felt any fragrance of warm brownie.

Thank you

Have been there month back. I'm writing late but I really want to. This place is in a great location. Easy to locate. The decor and seating arrangement is very good. There is an outdoor section and indoor. Inspite of the summer heat dont know why people choose to sit outside. We ordered chicken steak, chicken sandwichand fish fingers. The presentation of the food is also very nice. But some of the fish fingers were raw. The chicken was v good. The most sad part was the staff behaviour. The decorum they maintain. It was like a fish market. They were shouting n talking to each other. The place is open till 11...but at 10:30 only they were in a hurry to wrap up. They don't even know what's in the menu..I asked them about few items...they looked blank. They were so noisy..around 6-7 of them just moving around. And she were the only people there. My experience was totally ruined coz of this.

Nice place with a very unique theme 'blue mug'. The ambience is very cosy, with great songs playing in the background. It is beautifully decorated. Service is good. Food was good. We ordered Apricot chicken wings,Brownie shake,Chicken steak. The chicken wings size seemed very small,could have been a better size according to the price and quantity. Brownie shake looked very pleasing and craving the way it was decorated, taste was average. Chicken steak was very good with the crispy French fries,rice with herbs and a mixed taste of sour and sweet chicken with some filling inside it, and about the veggies - they could add a bit of salt atleast ( I personally think)

Located near to my house.  
BLUE MUG is not only the name of this place,  it's a theme of this place,  from the name to decoration,  it's absolutely define the name of this place with it's decoration.  

Food is awesome,  quantity is more than enough and if you want to visit this place then you should try there each and every shake and smoothie. 
They make each and every smoothie and shake awesome.

Had heard a lot about this cafe. The place has an indoor seating as well as outdoor. I found the decor simple yet cute.
Music was being played in the background. There was a keyboard,a guitar and some books kept on one side of the room.
The service was quick. The staff were good.
All the food items are available at reasonable prices although the quantity doesn't justify them.
The after 8 shake we ordered came in a tall glass. It tasted nice and fresh. Cheese fondue was good, too.
Bbq pizza was very small in size, but the taste was good. Chicken stroganoff was not good though.
The creamy cheese sauce of the fondue and the chicken item in the stroganoff dish was almost the same. Very disappointing.

The decor of the cafe is very soothing, although the cafe could do with a bit more space to accomodate its growing no.of patrons. The menu offers a variety of tempting dishes, we ordered a grilled fish sizzler and peri peri chicken along with blue lagoon and a kitkat shake. The food was very good. The only problem is that the service is very slow.

Tried out this place yesterday. Was indeed a good place to hangout with friends. Staffs were really courteous.food arrived after 15mins. Gst charged separately. Food tasted very well. Pls don't try the kitkat shake as it was nothing special. Chicken steak sizzler tasted fine. Overall a good experience. 

P.s. according to me, cafe drifter(hindusthan park) is a much better place than this . Their kitkat shake is superb.and prices are all inclusive of taxes. 
Thanks!

It's a nice place with a good ambience and crowd. The food is great too. We ordered Chicken Stroganoff, Penne Chicken Pasta in white sauce, a simple cappuccino and Oreo Shakes (must try). The staff were courteous. The only hindrance being the lack of a proper place for waiting. Overall, it was quite a good experience. Worth a second time visit.

The getup was good enough. When we arrived the place was full so we had to wait for our turn. It took 15mins and we went inside. 

Ambience - The ambience was average with mixed musical songs from both bollywood and hollywood. The walls were decorated with pics and they used kettles for hanging lights. Then there was some musical instruments like guitar and a keyboard. 

Food - The food quality was average. We had a moca coffee, blue berry smoothe, cheese fondue, and fish steak and brownie. The moca was nice and the smoothe was awesome but the fondue was not at all good. The cream sauce was not thick at all. Then came the steak which was good in looks but the taste was not at all good. The fish used was vetki which was quite facinating keeping in mind the price of the item. Then at last came the brownie on a steak plate which was again looking good but taste was quite mediocre. 

Service - It was not upto the mark but quite satisfying.

At the end it was a meeting with my favourite person after a long time so i felt good but the food couldn't put the cherry on top of the cake.

I and my friend went to this cafe yesterday, owing to the hype surrounding the restaurant for the past two three weeks, thank social media for the 'Check-In facility'. It was a Saturday afternoon, odd hour really to expect a waiting in a small cafe, but there we were waiting outside the cafe on a Saturday afternoon. Still we agreed to wait, WHY? Of course because we were hearing about it for so many days that we thought it was WORTH the WAIT. Never had we been soo MISTAKEN in our analysis of a food place. Not only was the food PLAIN BAD, but the service was LATE and the quality of the items BAD. The funny thing was that before ordering we had asked the waiter about their 'HOT FAVORITE' in the restaurant among the customers. He suggested us the chicken steak and a brownie shake. Trust me when i say, it was the worst chicken steak i have had in a REPUTED cafe and yes we couldn't finish the shake, so guess how it was. I generally don't give bad reviews for a food place, but i seriously don't understand the Huge Hype regarding this place and was very disappointed with the food after having such high expectations. Really SAD and Disappointing.

This place is one of my frequent stops in Kolkata. The food served is pretty good and the rates are a plus. But on one of my recent visits I left the place disappointed because the Oreo Shake we had ordered wasn't served after repeated requests for it. It's a shame that we got billed for the same and were bound to ask the staff to cancel it.

Okay, there are few things that I would love to mention about this place.
Keeping in mind the place is a bit small, yet pretty well decorated and doesn't feel congested. The outside arena is quite pleasant but the the construction that is presently going on on the building above it kind of spoils the exterior beauty of the cafe but then again it's temporary. Cafes with smoking area are best for people like me, but if have already taken a seat inside the cafe(non smoking area) you can't switch place so that is a bad option we are left with, so if someday wish to enjoy the AC while having their food and switch to the outside area for smoking while sitting, unfortunately would not be a good option.
Okay coming to the food, the food is pretty nice. The deserts are best to choose from but to all the pizza lovers, it's a complete NO for this place, the crust of pizza is too hard and if you want to enjoy pizza it's better dominos anyday. Try out the shakes, they are better there. The serving and the service is quite good and formal. Well that's it. Enjoy, have an experience. Blue mug lost a rate and half because of the unavailability to switch place between the smoking area and the non smoking area and also because of the unsatisfactory quality of the pizza served.
Thank you.

I was planning to visit Blue Mug since a long time and today I finally managed to go. It is located in a bylane of Jodhpur Park. It is difficult to get a table as it always crowded. We were a group of three and the order was
1. Crunchy Garlic filled Mushroom: This is recommended as it was really tasty. It is served with a dip.
2. BBQ Chicken Pizza: The topping was good but I personally found the crust to be a little hard.
3. Oreo Shake: Highly recommended
4. After 8 Shake: This one is a nice combination of chocolate, icecream and mint.
5. Blueberry Smoothie: A good one topped with cornflakes and nuts.
6. Stroganoff Chicken: This was light and simple. A good one.
7. Peri Peri Chicken: This was served with french fries along with the usual rice and veggies. I felt that the chicken could have been a little softer.
Decor: 4/5
Food: 3.5/5

I have been here on multiple occasions and have ordered in, because of its location both close to my home, university and office. When it first opened, it was extremely exciting for me as I just love caf√© hopping. 

The decor is nice, and quirky, but not so over the top that it hurts one's eyes. The playlist could really do with some serious improvement. 

Coming to the service, this place is always packed, which is absolutely fine, and customers often have to wait a while till they can be alloted a table, which is also fine. Both the seating arrangement inside and outside are beautiful and no complaints there. But the staff is not up to par. Often one table is attended by too many staff members while the others go unnoticed. The waiters are often confused about the items that you want to order and their availability. Last time I went there, we ordered a classic Margherita pizza of 12" which though was listed on the menu, apparently was yet to be launched by the restaurant. A bit of a downer that was. And the waiter made us wait for almost 20 minutes to JUST confirm if the 12" pizza was available or not. The waiters are often rude when the customers enquire how much longer they have to wait before they are served. And finally, the service is ridiculously slow and snail paced. Last time we were made to wait an entire 45 minutes before our drinks and entr√©e was served. 

The food is all right. "All right" being the key word. It's not great although their menu has quite a few options for each section. The tea and coffee selection is enviable and a delight for a hot beverage connoisseur. I've tried the Margherita pizza, that came  with bell peppers, capsicums, onions and tomatoes - which was as far a stretch from Margherita as could be. Although the manager did argue that this indeed was a Margherita pizza, it wasn't. I've had their fish fingers, and they are really nice, perfectly crunchy and crispy outside with succulent fish inside. The fish to marinade ratio is also perfect. I've tried their Americano and mocha frappe, both are good, nothing to complain about. Their chicken mayo sandwich is also quite good. Nothing extraordinary. The barbeque chicken burger, on the other hand was just not cutting it. The patty was dry, the quantity of mayo was quite frugal and the vegetables were droopy and sad. The menu card said that it would come with a side of barbecue sauce, but instead we got a sweet and sour tomato ketchup. Upon enquiry the waiters argues relentlessly that that was barbecue sauce and had the manager not swooped in, god knows how heated THAT conversation would have been. I've also tried their grilled fish, which is okay, not great. But maybe that was a bad day. But the fish was rubbery and not as flaky and soft as a grilled fish is wont to be. 

Maybe if these things were looked into, Blue Mug has every possibility of gaining further popularity and becoming one of the best caf√©s in the city.

Heard a lot about this place...finally visited it few days back. On a weekday at around 2.30pm...it was crowded..we had to wait longer as we opted for the ac seating and not the outdoor seating. Ww had to wait for about 20mins before getting a table. A small cafe but with a charm. The staffs and the manager is very well mannered. We took their recommendations and ordered drums of heaven for starters and they were perfectly made. For the main course i tried chicken steak and lobster thermidor. Chicken steak was good. Lobster thermidor was so well made that it was probably the best lobster thermidor that i ever had in kolkata, very much recommended. For the dessert I tried chocolate cone which was full of hard chocolate and chocolate mousse, this is recommended for desserts. Pocket pinch was very much affordable. Would visit again soon..like very soon.

It was a gloomy Wednesday afternoon and we wanted a place to chill out and visit a good cafe. This was our choice and we were enthralled by the quality of food and the ambience out there. The music isn't too loud, you can have conversations at a decent volume. The playlists need a little improvement. Moving onto the food , starting from the fish n chips, grilled fish sizzler to the chicken lollypop, in veg the cottage cheese balls and veg pasta was delicious. The cold coffee , sangria and the strawberry punch were beautifully decorated and tasted just as perfect. Overall it was a great and satisfying experienceüôÇ

Blue mug is a serene cafe which is situated nearby Jodhpur Park Puja..ambience is cool,Decor is nice,food is very good but the only thing which can be improved is the service which can be way better..as it's a congested cafe with full of crowd always..so crowd management service can be properly improved..otherwise it's a cool place to hangout with friends and closed ones..we ordered Ferrero rocher frappes which was great..along with chicken stroganoff which was also very good although the quantity can be improved..and lastly we had some pasta which was also great..so last but not the least it's a good suggestion for people who love to hangout with friends with some good tantalising of taste buds.

This cafe was on my list for quite some time since I checked the reviews on Zomato. So I went to this place ordered one brownie shake and one Oreo shake. It tasted horrible. It was smelly. My friend returned the Oreo shake and ordered cold coffee which was smelly as well. Really disappointed and couldn't order anything else. The decor on the other hand was really nice. But the cafe is way too overrated.

This caf√© is one of the popular hangout places in recent times,but you have to walk a bit from the bus stand to reach here.Both the interior and the exterior sitting arrangements are good! They have AC too :)
The staff's are very nice and the service is quick.
I have visited this place several times with my friends and totally love this place.
The Chicken Sandwiches , Chicken Salami Pixza,BBQ Chicken Pizza are my all time favorite :) The pizza comes with lots of cheese and Chicken and the Sandwich is worth the money.
Among the drinks, Virgin Mojito is a "must have" from the place I must say and the Brownie Shake is also yum. Blue lagoon and Fresh lime soda is also good and refreshing.
I have also tasted the French Fries and Mexican French Fries they are nice and the quantity is good.
Chipotle BBQ Wings Sizzler is another favorite dish of mine.

‚óé Cold coffee with ice cream
‚óé Oreo shake
‚óé BBQ chicken pizza
‚óé Chicken steak sizzle

Everyone liked the food, i specially liked BBQ pizza and Oreo shake.

A great cafe in the midst of serene by lanes of Jodhpur Park . The cafe has earned a lot of fame amongst the teens and the middle ageds because of ita ambience , food quality and its friendly staff . I went there for a date which was simple yet memorable . We ordered chicken stroganoff whuch i had been eyeing for a long time and my friend had chicken club sandwich . The quantity was eniugh for 2 persons to be full . Loved the creamy , juicy gravy of chicken stroganoff . Wanted to many more dishes however as we got ourselves into talking we alnost forgot about food . We sat in the outside area which was surprisingly not sultry or warm at all because of their lovely arrangements for coolers , that was an eye catcher . Over all the experience is too good and looking forward to go again this coming week as i am not able to focus on any other place rather than this cafe .

My friends and I decided to go to Blue Mug cafe after we saw the excellent reviews on zomato and certainly we were very excited for both food and ambience.
But on reaching there ,came our first disappointment as the outdoor shown in the zomato gallery is nothing as compared to the real view. The place is small with a swing at the end in one corner , rest are occupied by chairs.
Now coming to the indoor, place is too small and the ambience too is not that eye catching. Loud music and louder voices of people talking.
That probably would balanced it all if the food was good.
We ordered, non-veg pasta,(quantity was too less), bbq pizza(which was good),chicken sizzler (which looked like chicken roasted in a curry and tasted like it was dipped in some herbal oil) , Caeser salad( the most pathetic of all the items. Olives were horrible, and the salad was filled with cabbage leaves).
Only the best thing for the day was chicken lollipops.( one star is for the chicken lollipop)
Overall a very bad experience and we regret the visit.

We ordered 
*Barbeque chicken pizza
*Chicken steak sizzlers
*Brownie shake
*Snickers shake
*Choco Marvel cake
*Blueberry pastry
*Chocolate cone
Pizza was cheesy and tasty,steak sizzlers were good. Shakes look awesome but doesnt taste as good. Desserts are good,but some of the items weren't available,and they gave us blueberry pastry instead of blueberry mousse. 
The plus is the ambience and location of this place. Price is okay for the quantity. But none of the food I had was lipsmacking,something that I wanted more. Though I will visit once more,to sit outside.

A very chilled out place. More than the food and drinks which are too good as well the ambience stands apart. It is very simple yet chic. We sat in the interior section which is very well decorated and organised.  The exterior section is yet to be explored.
Now coming to food we ordered Fish Roll - it was simply delicious, the best part is when they say 'Fish' roll they mean it. The stuffing was completely made of fish and it tasted yumm.
The drinks that we had was After 8 and it was simply sinful.
I would recommend all the people to try this place at least once. Just one advice have enough time on your hand as the place is relatively small and you might need to wait to be seated!

I was curious about Blue Mug because it was a hit in my social circle on the internet.
The service was disappointing. Even as I entered, another customer was yelling at the staff about how slow they are.
I ordered the very popular Oreo shake, the Chocolate Monk, a mojito, a pizza and chicken wings.
I'm a huge fan of chocolate, and I wasn't satisfied with the Oreo shake. It wasn't chocolate-y enough for me.
The Chocolate Monk tasted far better. 
The wings were pretty decent too.
The mojito was as fine as any other mojito. The pizza was below expectations.
I wanted to order their marvel cake, another item that comes highly recommended, but we were told it's out of stock.
The ambience was ordinary. A few books and instruments in a corner. The place is a bit too cramped as well.
I've been there twice, just because it's close by. I might go back for the Chocolate Monk again and hopefully desserts. In my opinion, this place is far too overrated.
Pocket pinch was 850 for two, thanks to the 14% tax.

I have been meaning to come here for sometime now.
The decor and ambience are good. They have outdoor seating as well, which was perfect for an overcast afternoon. 
We ordered a chicken cordon bleu and Oreo and Brownie shakes.
The shakes were beautiful and tasty, although it had too much whipped cream to my liking. I liked the Brownie shake more, Oreo shake was a bit watery.

The food took forever to come. The service needs improvement. The presentation was pleasing. The taste was out of the world! I would definitely recommend the chicken cordon bleu. It is topped with a lot of molten cheese and has fries to go along. This is heaven for chicken lovers.

The service was the only disappointing part. The food took a long time to arrive. Also, the waiter mistakenly returned our balance money to the table next to us. Neither the waiter nor we realised it. The people on that table were courteous enough to tell us about it.
The food wins the heart and partly covers up for the below-average service!

First talking about blue mug i would like to say this place is really unorganised . This place is like a size of chess board soo small incontrast to its popularity. Stuffy , congested are some words which go with it's ambience..they got more number of boys who help in serving than customer coz most of the customer stand out of the caffeteria ....they run short of tables everytime .....
Well all these negative things aint negative coz all these happen because of its increase popularity and good quality food .....
We ordered many thing cant talk bout each nd every item... overall those were delicious and quite eye catching .nd tbh it really satisfied my taste bud .. .

Visited this place a few days ago with my bestie. The ambience is soothing and the dishes are perfect. We ordered a blue lagoon, a KitKat shake and a choco brownie with ice cream. The brownie was a perfect 10 on 10; each and every ingredient was in correct proportion. The hot chocolate cake simply melts in your mouth and the ice cream on top compliments it beautifully. After that the blue lagoon was totally refreshing with the taste of lime, mint leaves interwined with a cool blue touch. Loved it. The KitKat shake, though I felt was a bit excessive creamy, so can't give it a full 5. Overall I had a very good experience based on food, service and environment. I would surely recommend it to people; a perfect place to hang out with friends. ‚ò∫

I was eager to go to this place since the time it opened. It is immensely popular ‚ù§
Location : Please Use Google Maps ‚úå
First Problem I had with this place is the waiting time
I went with 2 of my friends and we had to wait for more than an hour and even after that we had to share a table.
Second Problem The Electricity went On and Off amd it was really annoying.
Finally Coming to the food,
We ordered
‚óÜ Bruschetta
‚óÜ Oreo Shake
‚óÜ BBQ Chicken Burger
‚óÜ Chicken Lasagna
Bruschetta was nice
Oreo Shake was really nice and we loved it üëå
BBQ Chicken Burger was okay
Chicken Lasagna could have been much better and we ended up wasting a lot.
Service is not up to the mark :(

Blue Mug according to me is one of the best place to hang out with friends. The place is extremely cosy with a beautiful decor. It's a great place for jamming sessions also as the place provides you with guitar and synthesiser. If you are a book lover you are going to love this place. The beverages they serve are just mind blowing. The Brownie shake tastes as good as it looks (check the pic I have posted). Well Blue Lagoon might be a very common drink but Blue Mug does it in the best way. And tea lovers has a large option. From lemon tea to coconut flavoured tea.
When I first visited the place with my bestie we tried out Apricot Chicken Wings for appetiser, which is sweet and savoury, BBQ Chicken Pizza which is far far better than Domino's and Chicken Spaghetti with Mix Bologenes Sauce which is worth a try. I would surely visit the place again coz I can't wait to try out the other delicacies... All the best to the Blue Mug team..

Located at Jodhpur Park. 5 min walking distance from Salimpur Bus Stop. Its a magnificent cafe offering both indoor & outdoor seating arrangements. Staffs are professional and well behaved. Moith watering dishes available here. We ordered Honey Chicken Platter as main course and Chocolate Cone & Tulip mousse as desserts. But that day Tulip mousse was not available. So, ordered Strawberry mousse. All of the dishes were delicious. Transaction and billing speed should be increased. This cafe has created a great hype among the youngsters and college students recently within a short interval.

This place is easy to locate, Its near to jodhpur Park. A very well decorated caf√© for sure.
I have visited here a number of times, there is a section in the cafe where musical instruments are kept and anyone can play there, Its free. 
The staffs are very humble and nice. 
Both indoor and out door sitting is available. 
But here is the thing, it's always crowded. People most of the time have to wait outside because the cafe stays full. 

So now let's come to the food section. 
I have eaten their BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA - it's a must try I must say. 
CHICKEN CLUB SANDWICH - it's cheap and tasty at the same time. They give you four pieces. I don't know what's not to like about it. 
BLACK FOREST PASTRY - it tastes as good as it looks. 
FRENCH FRIES - the quantity is worth the price. 
MASALA COLD DRINK - I did not like it much, maybe you can. 
And lastly I want to mention the most favourite item of mine, OREO SHAKE - you should definitely try this one. I mean quantity wise it's great and guess what it tastes so amazing. I usually go there for this shake. 

To add up to the good I must tell you the prices are inclusive of taxes.

Went there at around 7:15 pm. We have to wait for 10-15 minutes and then we are asked to take a shared table. We took the offer and take a big table where there was three other ladies. 
Now come to the food part. Food was good. We have ordered oreo shake and a chicken bbq pizza. Both  are good enough. We have to wait for 7-10 minutes for our orders. Quality is good.

It is situated a little interior of jodhpur park bus stop.
It is a little cafe with wide range of menu. We had Fruit mock tails, chocolate cone, chocolate smoothie, fish & chips and chicken nachos. We also had masala chai and packed 3 Pizzas for home.
The service is not very good. They don't have any co ordination within themselves. There was a lot of confusion with order of food.
The food is good, ambiance is beautiful. They have very good decorations. They prepare the drinks in-front of you. Food Presentation is also very nice. They have some musical instruments for live show maybe. There are story books on a metallic rack for readers.
We didn't have the opportunity to sit outside.

The new over-hyped place on Zomato. The pictures are really appealing and it does actually look tempting but sorry my friends, the very first bite brings you to the Level Zero. 

The Browniee shake tasted more like Boost, sorry I would rather say Horlics because even boost tastes good to me. 
The Pizza had some weird smell on each bite.
The Bruschetta might still be something that you'd like.
The place is very pocket friendly. We ordered one Cottage Cheese Pizza, Browniee Shake and Bruschetta which costed us Rs.504 inclusive of taxes. The crowd was not very attractive. 
I appreciate the presentation but they should definitely work on the taste too.

This is one of the nicest cafes in Kolkata.. It is a nice and cosy cafe in south Kolkata.. The food here is awesome specially the chicken lollypop.. The chicken lollypop is the best I have had in Kolkata.. The shakes are also very nice like the Oreo shake,brownie shake and strawberry shake.. I had chicken steak sizzler which was very nicely cooked.. The deserts are mouth watering.. The chocolate cone is a delight but the chocolate marvel cake is out of the world.. With liquid chocolate oozing out the chocolate marvel cake is one of the best deserts I have ever had.. I would recommend everyone to try out this place..

The newest place where all cool Kolkata kids are going these days! With the limited time I had this time, I wanted to try this one at least and hence we arrived dot at 11, after not getting any seat the previous evening.

They made us wait for some time till they were ready to start the day. There is an indoor and an outdoor arrangement. The outdoors look very Kolkata-ish and romantic but it was a hot say so we took indoors anyway.

They have kept various story books, a guitar and keyboard inside. This is something that every place is doing these days though but it's nice 

The service is very sweet and they prepare most of our food and coffee right in front. So you can be sure about hygiene and technique. The prices are also pretty decent and I'm sure it's just a matter of time and they will be a hotshot kolkata place to visit with your loved one. My Monday date with A was a hit :)

Visited this much hyped place on the occasion of EID! The choice of visiting was an utter disaster! Since its much over-hyped we had to wait for 15 minutes before we were seated! The decor is a big plus! The service was good as well. Now coming to food we ordered barbecue chicken pizza, barbecue chicken burger (which was served along with wafers and a ketchup) , penne pasta (chicken).The pizza tasted a bit sweet i dint know why honestly! The pasta tasted bland and the only taste you get is that of black pepper! The burger was on the okayish side though it contained a lot of tamarind sauce making its taste a bit weird! Our only savour were the deserts! We ordered chocolate cones, blueberry cheese cake, choco marvel cake! The desserts were really good as a matter of fact! As a matter if fact tgis palce didn't live up to our expectations! And we were given a complimentary waffle served with ice cream! This too was a turn off as the waffles were not soft at all!

Blue Mug is one bustling joint in the southern fringes of the city. Ambience is decent with pretty d√©cor and the crowd consists of all age groups. They've got seating arrangements inside as well as outside. Coming to food, loved the chocolate cone, the cappuccino was okay, safe to say that I've had better. Chocolate monk was nice, and the apricot wings are an absolute crowd pleaser. Virgin mojito was nice too. There was a particular pasta dish and chicken dish we had ordered, the names of which I can't recollect at the moment but they weren't that good. Pocket pinch is okay for a caf√©. And like every other review says, you've got to wait for a table to be available. It's almost always full. Have fun and happy eating!

The blue mug is on probably everyone's list either ticked or waiting to be ticked. It is one of the most popular cafes located near Jodhpur Park. It is at the corner plot and has an air conditioned sitting arrangement along with an outside sitting facility. On our visit the place had no empty tables so we had to wait for 40minutes to get seated.
The staff were quick with their service and the food was good both on the basis of quality and quantity.
We had the fish fingers which were juicy and fresh. Then came the chicken burger which was moderate but the cold coffee was great. We also ordered the Oreo shake which was a little too creamy at the end but overall it was nice. It is surely one of the best hangout places in Kolkata.

This caf√© isn't too old but it has managed to build quite a reputation in a short span. One visit to this cafe and you'll know why. Almost always crowded,you need to wait 15-20mins to get a table. This was my third visit here. Must tries would be the apricot chicken wings, the chicken in soy honey sauce, cheese fondue . Their pizzas and shakes are good too especially the oreo and kitkat shake. Pocket pinch is on the lower side. But prices have been raised recently. Still doesn't burn a hole in your pocket.

P. S. We were served waffles with chocolate ice cream as a complimentary dessert. Which tasted decent enough.

Decided to visit some other restaurant but suddenly changed the mind and visited this cafe...

Location :- Near jodhpur park school.. its quite easy to locate..

Ambience :- We had to wait for about 30mins inspite of reaching the place within 6.30.. There was a long waiting list.. still managed to get the outside sitting zone.. It was awsm.. The sitting place was dimly lit.. yet it was perfect for clicking selfies..üòé

Service :- Service was prompt..The staffs were polite and well mannered...

Food :- 1) Oreo Shake :- The best shake I have ever had... It was simply lipsmacking.. yummylicious.. The Oreo biscuits topped on it.. It was just treat to my eyes as well as heavenly for my taste buds.. (5/5)

2) Chicken Club Sandwich :- just one word.. delicious..üòç 4 pieces of sandwiches accompanied with chips.. The samdwiches had ample amount of mayonese.. and the stuffings were enough.. It filled our tummies..üòÄ enough for 2..

3) BBQ chicken sandwich :- one of the best pizza in town.. chessy.. crunchy crusted loaded with veggies and smoked chicken.. It is the perfect blend of aroma with stuffings..

It will not burn a hole in your pocket.. The prices are very much less as compared to other restaurants..

P.s :- the only problem we faced was in billing... We were billed two extra items..üòë but they later changed the bill..

A good place.. I am definitely going back for the shake..üòçüòçüòç

This place boasts of a nice decor. Located near jodhpur park the cafe is always hustling and bustling and you must wait around 15-20 mins to get a table.
Coming to the food, the bbq chicken pizza tasted sweet. I have never had a pizza which tastes sweet,so it was kinda weird. The chicken burger comes with wafers but had an overpowering taste of tamarind sauce. The chicken penne pasta in white sauce was bland. The saving grace though were the desserts. The pastries and the chocolate cone were delightful. Burn in the pocket is acceptable as well.
We were served waffles with chocolate icecream complimentary ;-)

Finally visited the most Instagramed place of Kolkata , Blue Mug. 
As soon as I entered , the place was jam packed on a Saturday evening around 4. Luckily I got a table inside for 4. The decor is very simple and intelligent but the worst part about sitting inside is the smoke. The whole place is filled with smoke of the sizzlers and there is no proper ventilation. 
So it's 3/5 for ambience. 

Coming to food and beverages. 
Fruit Punch was decent and good. 

The biggest let down was the Bacon sandwich. Being a big fan of Bacon Ham and Pork , I can understand the quality and freshness of the meat and the Bacon sandwich was not fresh. The Bacon slices were taken straight out of cold packets and placed in the sandwich. The bacon was not even grilled. Big let down. 

The BarBQ Chicken Burger was very good and tasty. Good amount meat in the Patty. 

The best was the Chicken Club Sandwich. It was big and filling. Totally worth the money. 

All in all a satisfying experience. This place is just a bit over hyped because of its low rates for the student going crowd. A definite one time visit.

It has been in my wishlist for soo long.Finally yesterday we visited this place. This is a well decorated place and ambience was nice with soothing music, lights, hanging kettle, everything was perfect. They have both indoor and outdoor seating facilities available. As it was a Sunday so we had to wait for a while before the waiter prepared our table.

We ordered mainly the starters which consisted of : 
Hash brown potatoes, Chicken Brushetta, Chicken Lollipop and Cold Coffee.

All the dishes were made with perfection.
# 6 pieces of Hash Brown potatoes were very crispy from the outside and very moist from the inside. Delicious.
# Brushetta was originally a vegetarian dish but wanted that with chicken. So the waiter added Chicken pieces to that with some extra charge. 4 pieces of garlic bread with generous amount of cheese and chicken on top. You should definitely try this.
# Chicken Lollipop was 6 large pieces of drumstick tossed in a spicy red sauce. It was very very tasty yet soo hot. 
# Cold Coffee came in a big glass. Very refreshing and soothing. 

Service was very fast and the management was attentive. Staffs were friendly, helpful and courteous.
Prices are very reasonable and they charge only 14.5%  VAT.
This is a must go place for their finger licking delicious starters.
Highly recommended...........

The most hyped and trending cafe of kolkata recently.. This place was in my wishlist from a long time. Finally paid a visit to this place with a friend of mine..! The interiors were amazingly decorated.. It has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements.. Luckily we didn't have to wait to get a place.. The service was good and welcoming..! We ordered:
‚óè BBQ chicken burger... It tasted good.. but I feel instead of a cheese slice they could have filled it with melted cheese.. It would then have tasted amazing.
‚óè Blue Lagoon. It was good.
‚óè Chicken Club Sandwich. Again I prefer they could have filled it with melted cheese instead of a cheese slice.. Otherwise it was okay.
‚óè Chicken Salami pizza.. It was the worst of all... The chicken chunks were not chunks and they tasted utterly bad.. Couldn't even have it.. Strongly recommended not to order.

It was pocket friendly.. Our bill was 600 bucks including taxes.

Its not too big a place but it has made a lot of noise, because of its food. The standard of food quality is very good compared to other cafes in general.

Blue Mug's shakes and sandwiches are great and their tea is lovely. Their chicken steak, honey mustard chicken and chicken mayonnaise sandwiches are very good and some of my favs. However their chicken mayonnaise sandwich is better than the club sandwich they serve.

Its another good place to hangout in Jodhpur Park, so do drop in and give them some love.

I found this place over rated. The food was not up to the mark. We took a stroganoff, a chicken steak and a honey mustard chicken. Everything was sweet other than the stroganoff. Who has ever though of having some sweet chicken steak?! It didn't please our taste buds. 
The decor is pretty impressive especially the outside tables. There's a swing too which makes the ambience better. 

The drinks they serve look very pretty too. Try the fruit sangria. They make it with tonic water. But they put way too much fruit than I've ever had in my entire life.

The perfect cafe ambience is the first thing I would like to mention about this place. The indoor is decorated in a very out of the box manner with kettles hanging and still lights whereas the outdoor sitting area is a cozy little place with swings. We had ordered a strawberry shake, a barbecue chicken pizza and a chicken steak. The pizza was good and so was the shake but the steak wasn't really upto the mark. I felt the food could have been better. It's a nice place to hangout without burning a hole in your pocket.

This is a nice little cafe, situated at Jodhpur Park. We had a delicious BBQ chicken pizza and a great Grilled Bhetki in lemon butter sauce. The best thing was the chocolate marvel pastry with a slice of red velvet. All of these in such affordable prices that it won't burn a hole in your pocket. Surely going back soon for more. Highly Recommended.

This was a very overdue review to be honest considering I've spent most of my hangouts with friends here since they've opened up this charming caf√© in a corner of Jodhpur Park, a little away from the main roads and the blare of horns roadside caf√©s face.
Upon entering, that is if you manage to go past the already full place (which is half of the time), there is a main sitting area with a lot of tables for the space, but surprisingly not crammed.
The outside area, or the default smoking area is my absolute favourite with a swing and tables that are better spaced. It's my go to place whenever I'm hanging out with friends, since most of us are smokers(not something to be proud of).
The smoking area also has pretty plants all around and on breezy days is an absolute pleasure to be in with loved ones.
The food and the beverages are surprisingly cheap, with an Americano aka black coffee that comes for 55/- and a very good first flush of Darjeeling Tea at an unbelievable rate.
I've almost tried everything there, from my 15-odd ventures to this place.
I recommend:
The coffee (if you want it strong however, you've got to ask for the same. They're a little apprehensive when it comes to making a really strong Americano)
The mocktails: Specially the Pina Colada and the Margarita.
Apricot Chicken wings: This is a plate of pure heaven. Onion rings, French fries: a)no one serves these two items for 60/- and 80/- a plate for each of the dishes.
b) So good. So much quantity. A plate of each is enough for 3 people.
Burgers: These are surprisingly awesome with the patty being a tad different than others.
Pizzas: 8 inch wonder discs full of cheese, so much cheese that you don't need to order extra ever.
The chocolate cone: This is pure sin shaped like a cone, and is made od chocolate and chocolate cake and more chocolate.

A lot of pictures have not been snapped due to gluttony (as always)

The staff is courteous and friendly, though they could help with more training and speed.

Overall, a lovely place to hang out or even have a date. Pocket friendly is always a plus, right?
Tip: always go with some extra time in hand, like 10 minutes because you might be in the waiting list since this place is usually bustling.

A lot of cafes have sprung open recently in Calcutta all catering to the new trend of westernized food. One such cafes sits on the aisles in and around Jodhpur Park. From outside, the cafe does not look pleasing but the farce concept sublimes once you step in.

Decor- Keeping in touch with the actual meaning of the word Cafe it is small and cosy with the dessert display counter to your right as you enter. The ceiling is adorned with hanging teapots all fixed with a bulb that provides perfect lumination thereby, setting just the right mood. It has a bookshelf with out of the box choices but, it really needs some work if it wants to cater to all genres. A piano sits tight for anyone wanting to try their hands.

Ambience- The whole place gives out a Jolly mood that is set just right by the amazing playlist that keeps humming in the background. It has both AC and non- AC arrangements. The outside shack has a swing set in stead of chairs and also a smoking zone.

Food- The food over here is the reason you will never forget about the cafe. The presentation of the food is just about right and ticks both quality and quantity boxes with delectable dishes of huge portions. Some nameworthy dishes are Chicken Penne Pasta, The Steak Sizzler, Caesar Salad and one that has to be mention Coconut Payesh.

The pasta is boiled about just right and comes with an option of three sauces- red,white and mixed. The chicken shreds beautifully intermixes with the richness of the sauce striking a perfect balance. The sizzler provides you with a big portion of stuffed chicken with sauteed vegetables and gravy. While the chicken Steak comes with a side of herb rice that has a perfect use of beautiful aromatics and a side of mashed potatoes or fries.

The Caesar salad is as classic as it can be. It also has a non alcoholic drinks menu from which the Blue Lagoon is probably the best choice. The fruit sangria though is not as good as it looks.

But the ending note of Coconut Payesh seals the deal. It is basically a coconut mousse with cubed coconuts all served in an authentic Bengali coconut shell. Out of all the desert options this is the one that will give you the foodgasm you desired.

Value for money- The friendly behaviour of the staff also leaves a mark on your experience which you just can't ignore. And the best part? This is probably the cheapest of all the new modernized food joints. The filling bowl of pasta and steak comes just for rupees 200 each (inclusive of tax).

Pocket pinch for 2 : 350-500

I am sure that this place once visited will transform to your go to food joint from your very first bite. Happy eating everyone.

Bon appetite -

Another brilliant setup in the southern heart of Kolkata.
Location: Located in one of the bylanes of jodhpur park crossing ABAR BAITHAK.

Now coming to the delicacies served,each item served here is finger licking delicious.The service is quick.The interior is very well setup,pleasant yet creative and well managed.

I would like to give a quick review of our order.
BBQ Chicken Pizza: All thumbs up for this item.The pizza bread is delicate and not hard,topped with moderate chunks of chicken tossed in bbq sauce and mayo and chesse in appropriate ratio filling your mouth with amazing tastes with a never ending craving for it.
Brownie Shake : The mixture of chocolate,brownie and ice cream melts in the mouth leaving you awestruck.
Mango Mousse: A totally different out of the box idea.The mango is sliced from the top and the seed is taken out leaving the pulp inside the fruit.The mixture of mousse is filled inside the mango topped with mango jelly.With every spoon you get the taste of the mousse and the mango which is heavenly.A must try.

I am pleased with the presentation and the humbleness of the staffs.Another hidden gem.

A quaint little caf√® tucked in the bylanes of Jodhpur, Blue Mug was on my list for a long long time. 

Starting off with the ambience and decor- the place was jam packed even on a Wednesday afternoon and it was surprising to see that there was a waiting line. They have both outdoor and indoor seating. The indoor decor is very cute too- love the blue lights. 

Coming to the food- we ordered the after 8 shake, the brownie shake, chicken lollipop and bbq chicken pizza. Loved all of it especially the pizza! 

The staff is courteous too and service was quick. Our bill came up to 790INR. It is quite easy on the pockets and great place to catch up with friends or spend time with the family.

Blue Mug, two inches away from my home, makes a subtle-but-intense cappuccino experience everytime I step into the Caf√©. Courteous staff makes one feel welcomed to have that perfect cup of Blue Mug to waive all that muggy blues out. Drinks are good, a certain favorite is the After Eight shake unless the staff goofs it up! Food too tastes good. Their Apricot Chicken wings, or Chicken Steak, or Chicken sizzler, or the Pasta, everything seems to be in place, not an indulgence but perfect to shoot your peckish tummy with. Said whatsoever, the cappuccino ( you could add caramel/ hazelnut/ vanilla/ all of them) is the best here. And, just to assure I am a coffee buff-the fresh coffee beans type, not the instant coffee one!Oh! It's time consuming in every way...you need to wait for quite a while to get that fresh aroma in you. Have a great Blue Mug shot!

This one is a must visit for friend groups and couples.  The ambiance is very soothing. Only the music is a bit loud. I was astonished to see a waiting list even on a normal Wednesday afternoon. After waiting for 15mins, we finally got our table. We ordered virgin mojito, Kitkat Shake, BBQ chicken Burger & chicken drumsticks. I was very satisfied with the quantity & quality of each item compared to the price. The drinks came within 10mins followed by the chicken items in around another 10mins.

***700th REVIEW***
Everytime I make it to another milestone on Zomato, I feel so grateful to this platform, which initially triggered to express my passion for food through pen and paper (or celluloid). This has been one hell of a journey and I would like to thank each one of my fellow foodies, followers and friends who were by my side supporting me and also those, who were not. Last time, I celebrated my 500th review with my family and special someone. This time, it was for all those bunch of people who make the miserable times of life bearable. Yes, I dedicate my 700th review to my best friends, with whom sharing lunch boxes, hogging on junky street food, exploring and dining at restaurants since school days was hell of an experience!
It was the birthday treat of a friend. We chose the most hep caf√© in town to reunite once again over chitchats, nostalgia and some really good food. Blue Mug it was!
Located inside Jodhpur Park, it‚Äôs a bit tedious to locate. But once you sort it out, you will land up in a happy happy place. The d√©cor is so beautifully done in a quirky way. The hanging kettles from the ceiling and the colourful paintings decked up the place in an unique way. There are two sections of the caf√© ‚Äì the non AC open air section with a really attractive garden swing (which never remains vacant) and the air conditioned proper restaurant section, which is obviously more conventional with all the quirked up d√©cor. Since it was a sultry evening, we chose the air conditioned section. The place faces a heavy rush almost all days all the time, so expect a waiting time of at least twenty minutes if you go in the evening.
After a short waiting time, finally we got the chance to enter. The manager was very courteous. He attended us gladly and showed us our assigned sitting arrangements. For the staffs, I would say that they need to be more professional and efficient with placement of orders and handling them.
Now comes the main thing, that is food! In one word, it was excellent. We tried quite a few items from the appetizers section and a few drinks.
Appetizers ‚Äì
Apricot Chicken Wings ‚Äì This item is the most talked dish from the Blue Mug Caf√©. Instastories and Facebook posts on this dish had caught my attention. Hence, we just couldn‚Äôt miss it. The wings sizing is perfect, apt as a finger food. I have been trying chicken wings from many joints recently. Trust me, this is undoubtedly the best one. The sauce has tangy flavour to it ‚Äì my favourite. You just cannot miss it anyway.
Crispy Fried Prawns ‚Äì Six in one portion, how can ever crispy fried prawns go wrong. The marination was done very well. The prawns were soft inside and the frying was deep outside. You know how it feels I guess. The sweet chilli dip to go with it was even better. Totally recommended!
Hash Browns ‚Äì Typically an English breakfast elementthe hash browns too, were very good. The mayo dip along with it was so comforting. Loved it!
Crunchy Garlic Filled Mushroom ‚Äì This was a very unique dish. Crunchy mushroom croquettes filled with paneer and cheese went very well with the garlic mayo dip. If you‚Äôre a veggie food hogger, this is your cup of tea. Hard core non vegetarians like us liked it as well.
Drinks ‚Äì
This place has a live mocktail counter which makes mocktails and serve them at your table right in front of your eyes. We had ‚Äì
Margarita ‚Äì This tasted very good but it is not the traditional margarita with a fizz, but a creamy version of it. Moreover the hint of lime wasn‚Äôt there but there was a orange flavour. The drink tasted pretty good but I must say that they should change the name and call it ‚ÄòTangerita‚Äô.
Yuzu Fizz ‚Äì We were overwhelmed by the Yuzu Wildflower drink at a nearby caf√© and hence we went for it. It was great but two of these drinks tasted differently ‚Äì one with excess fizz, the other one was perfect. The one made perfectly tasted nice.
Main Course ‚Äì
Grilled Bhetki in Lemon Butter Sauce ‚Äì Although we had ordered a Grilled Bhetki sizzler, they served us this dish. It was due to the mistake of order placement by their staff. The Bhetki was perfectly done and the lemon butter sauce tasted divine! Served with veggies and herbed rice, I quite liked this dish.
Dessert - 
Blue Mug Sundae - This looked brilliant. Hence we ordered it. Topped with fudgy brownies, chocolate ice creams, chocolate sticks and cherries, it created a luscious decadent thing. But the Blue Curacao at the bottom kinda spoilt the flavour. This started on a good note but the ending wasn't that smooth. 
The overall experience was good. There were a few glitches. But I think that this can be rectified if the staffs become more attentive and pro at handling the crowd. I am definitely going to come back here for some good adda sessions for the ambience it provides to their clients. Food is good, expecting it to be even better. There are no reasons for not recommending this place. Do try it out guys. Best wishes to Team Blue Mug! Happy Dining!

TREATING YOURSELF WITHOUT GETTING TOO HARD ON YOUR POCKET!

Imagine a branch with your gang in a quirky A/C indoor away from the scorching heat.. Or even a casual chat in an equally charming breezy balcony enjoying the cool shakes on a swing!
Where to? Blue Mug is the place. üòä

Don't miss the kitkat or oreo shake!üòç And the bbq chicken mushroom pizza is all that you want from a pizza!
The lamb sizzler was very disappointing though! It was full of bones, not tender at all, contained almost no meat and tasted nothing like lamb. 

Hope the chicken sizzler may be better.

Location: A 5-7mins walk straight through the lane beside Lederland, opposite of South City mall.

Ambience: 4/5
Staffs: 4/5, courteous and active(the place being always crowded)
Food: 4/5
Price: 5/5 , since no added taxes just VAT. üòú

Would surely visit there again to try the chicken steak sizzler as the aroma and fuming sound lured everyone around! üòùüòç

A little cafe tucked away in Jodhpur Park, this is the place to go now. The perfect getaway from the summer heat, the food and drinks are amazing. The only thing that can be improved is the service. We ordered the chicken wings, grilled sandwiches‚Äã and the Caesar salad. The salad was fantastic and the sandwiches were brilliant as well. The wings were not as good but well enough none the less. The kiwi mojito and the chocolate shake were both brilliant coolers.

This is one of the hidden gems of the city. Though it is located a bit inside from the main road, the place truly serves amazing food at pocket friendly prices.
The coffee we ordered had the perfect strength and just the right amount of bitterness.
The chicken steak sizzler was extremely juicy and was filled with the right amount of flavour.
Hope to visit soon.

So after hearing a lot about this place finally decided to check it out and surely the praises are well deserved. 

Starting off with the ambience, it's very buzzing like a cafe should be. The blue lights really add colorful vibes to the decor. 

We ordered a cheese fondue, oreo shake, cafe mocha, cold coffee with ice cream, French fries and on recommendation a BBQ pizza. The food and the beverages were really sumptuous. The pizza lived up to the recommendation. The pocket pinch was very economical compared to a lot of cafes in Kolkata. 

The staff were very cordial although I felt perhaps they were a touch understaffed because the orders took some time to be delivered as the restaurant was full. Also the place was a bit congested.

Heard the Buzz of it being the new cafe in town
Decided to go there to chill out with my friends. Cafe is well lit and decorated well. Interiors and the ambience give a peaceful feel. Seating comfortable. However Service was really lousy. Giving it a 3 because of the chicken sizzler which was really good. However the Bacon sandwich was total crap. Yet to try out their desserts which I really look forward to.

The ambience to start off with, is amazing. Blue lights covering the ceiling and the open area too is nice. 
We were a group of seven so they somehow arranged the bigger seating area for us. 
The food was nice even though I expected it to be better according to the hype. 
We ordered:

Honey Mustard Chicken.
Chicken Steak Sizzler.
Grilled Fish in lemon butter sauce.
Margarita Pizza.
Blue lagoon.
Yuzz fizz.
Oreo shake.

The sizzler and oreo shake totally stood out in terms of presentation and taste. 
They've started adding vat now and our bill was Rs. 1500/- AI. Happy with the service as well.

Heard a lot about this place and finally got a chance to pay a visit. The place was packed when we entered, so we chose to sit in the lawn area. It was a pleasant experience considering the weather was nice today. The food was really good. We ordered a Cheese fondue, BBQ chicken burger, Choco Marvel Pastry, two Lemon Iced Teas and one Pina Colada. The quantity was decent but I personally did not enjoy the burger that much. The staff is courteous and the service is real quick. Overall a lovely experience at a standardised price. Average pocket pinch for two would be around 800 rupees.

Apart from the food, the place looks good but again the books collection was average. 
I didn't like the music either, if you're a fan of hindi songs then you might love them.

I write reviews for every restaurant and this is the first time I am writing a NEGATIVE REVIEW
The 2star I am giving cz the food was ok ok plus my courtesy you can say. Ok..
Today I visited this place..Friday around 5pm it was crowded. We ordered blueberry shake, kulfi shake, apricot chicken wings, chicken nachos and cheese fondue..the blueberry shake are their special ones and guess what it was served in a small glass instead of the jug..it was disappointing.. When told the waiter he told mam jug khatam hogaya..I mean seriously???? The serving in the glass naturally reduces the quantity of drink in major but the price.. That's always same

Moreover we had to sit at a corner with really low height table which we did not want as it is not possible to use fork and knife at that height.The image I have attached..we asked the waiter atleast thrice to change our table whenever any one of the tables get vacant..soon one table got vacant they did not shift us then second table got vacant I told him please shift us to the other table again they did not and third time I found another table getting vacant but they did not shift us..we were there for around 30-35 mins only..after the bill arrived I called the manager and I told him the whole thing he apologized saying next time it won't happen and to my surprise the waiter told that the table which were getting vacant were already booked by others way before. I did not want to create a scene so I left.
It was a wastage of time and money for me and obviously the blueberry shake simply destroyed my mood at the first place.
WOULD NEVER VISIT THIS PLACE AGAIN AND WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE.

Located on a corner of a lane in Jodhpur Park, this cafe has been a rage amongst many, recently. Thrilled by the constant updates in my news feed and having an immense love for food, I decided to give this place a chance. And boy, was I mind blown!
Blue Mug, as the name suggests, welcomes it's customers with a cute blue mug at the entrance. The interiors of the cafe give a warm and homely feeling, with kettle-lights hanging from the ceiling and the paraphernalia in the corner, which includes an old piano, a guitar and a small shelf of books. The cafe has some space on the outside too, for it's customers, surrounded by a canopy of green trees, making it the perfect place for hangouts in winter evenings. The peaceful environment outside makes it a favorite among college students and the like.
I visited Blue Mug yesterday with a friend and was instantly hit with a smell of freshly brewing coffee. Being an ardent coffee lover myself, I decided to try it out and it was absolutely delicious. We ordered Apricot Chicken Wings as appetizers, and the tangy sweet taste of the sauce left our taste buds wanting for more. The apricot sauce was a first for me and I was delighted to try it. 
Next, we ordered Honey Mustard Chicken and Peri Peri Chicken. I must say, the plating of both these dishes was absolutely fabulous and beautiful, to have immediately captured my attention. The Honey Mustard Chicken came with a side of rice, sauteed vegetables and fries, but it was the chicken that was, hands down, the winner. Grilled to perfection, it was covered with a sauce made of honey and mustard, and tasted absolutely ravishing, with all the burst of sweet and tangy flavours. The Peri Peri Chicken too, came with a side of rice, sauteed vegetables and fries, and last but not the least, the tasty Peri Peri sauce. The sauce complemented the dish in every way and completed it, as it proved to be delicious ( with a hint of sour, salty and spicy) with the chicken.
For drinks, we ordered a Margarita, which was a beautiful blend of lime juice and pineapple juice, served in a wine glass, lending it an added air of sophistication. 
The staff was helpful and co-operative and the food was absolutely fresh, leaving us mouthwatering and eager to visit again.

It's been a while since I wrote a review.
So today I am going to review this place which has been getting all the love from the young brigade of the city recently (which was re-affirmed by the fact that it was jam packed with people waiting outside on a super hot afternoon). I visited blue mug yesterday. The place is pretty with both inside and outside sitting arrangements. It is not shabby not too fancy. I am not a fond of outdoor sitting arrangements. Still due to lack of place indoors I had to sit outside. We ordered two mocktails.
Green Apple flavoured mojito and blue lagoon.
Both of the drinks were super refreshing and the blue lagoon was the best I have ever had. However since it was too hot we decided to pay the bills and wait outside until one of the indoor places get empty. We did not want to keep the outdoor seat occupied for too long since we were not going to eat there.

Luckily within 5 minutes we got a place inside.
We ordered food. Bar b q chicken pizza and fish sizzler. The food took quite some time to arrive.
The pizza came first. It was too sweet and the crust a bit undercooked.

The fish sizzler came after half the pizza was over.
So I am a Peter cat fanatic and I know how a sizzler should taste like. To my utter disappointment the fish was overcooked and most of the skin was burnt. I was so hungry and this broke my heart.

We also packed a chocolate cone which was below average in my opinion.

Then the question comes why did I still give this place a high ranking. It is because of their SERVICE.
It should be given a 10/5. Each and every one of their staff are extremely courteous, polite and always taking care so that you feel comfortable. It was mind blowing how they managed the crowd and took care of each table. SUPERB.
Another plus point is that they make their mocktails in an open counter which really appealed to me since you get to actually see what they are putting in there.

The only suggestion for this place is to improve the food taste.

P.S. The sizzler comes with an accompaniment of fries. They are your regular Mac D fries. I asked the waiter whether it can be replaced by the herb rice that comes with the fish steak even if we have to pay extra.He said that's not possible. It would have been great if that couldbe done.

Heard alot about this cafe but was very disappointed.
Visited this cafe today with friends, decided to sit outside but the table for 4 was very small. Just 4 plates and u didnt have space for anything else.

Lets come to the food!

I read in a few reviews that the pizza here is good but seriously, u call that pizza? It felt like a crunchy bread with certain toppings! Very poor!
Lamb sizzler! Bad, the lamb wasn't soft at all with too much spices.

Chicken burger, BBQ Chicken burger, ham sandwich and scrambled eggs with toast! These were the only good things about today. All these items tasted quite good.

The dessert! Chocolate monk and Mango passion twist! Very poor! 1/5 stars for the desserts, or even .5!
The mango prep had nothing, the mixture ruined the taste. Neither did we get the taste of mango nor the fruit.
Chocolate monk! They used syrup! A drink with a little ice cream n whipped cream floating on top. U call these desserts? Needs alot of improvement.

Overall, It wasn't a good visit except for the burgers and sandwiches. And if u wanna try pizza, please visit

As is the story of all cafes in the beginning, Blue Mug is the new darling of Calcutta. 
I came across this cafe when I was trying to escape the loudness of the city. And as it turns out, I wasn't mistaken. 

Located in the cranny of quietness, the little blue cafe offers you a delectable platter of sweetness, from mouthwatering cheesecakes to ice-cream. There's always something for the customers with the spicy tastes too, namely the Chicken Steak and the Fish and Chips. 

My personal favourite however is their calming teas. A wide range of flavours to try from, any tea lover would love to spend a couple of hours in Blue Mug. 

My only complaint is the lack of stability in their prices. The prices on the menu unpredictably shoot up in strange circumstances and so you cannot really affix a certain amount on this cafe. 

Otherwise, my trysts with Blue Mug has just begun and I look forward to penning more stories and reading even more books at this beautiful cafe.

People are really hyped up about this place these days and the crowd there is humongous. Had gone to try this overly hyped cafe and trust me I did not find anything out of the box. Yes it is of course a treat to all the college going crowd, the prices are really low. We had ordered for a chicken grilled burger, cold coffee and a bbq chicken pizza. The burger was okay, the cold coffee had too much of milk in it, the bbq chicken pizza was nothing very tasty, just the normal ones you get in stores.  But of course it is a very good place for college going people, easy on pocket. 
Pocket pinch was 500 for two.

After reading all the reviews about this much hyped place decided to visit it last Sunday. Located in the bylanes of Jodhpur park, this small cafe has been decorated so well. It's provides you with both inside and outside sitting arrangement and both are done up very well. The ambience is great and so is the staffs. Very polite and helpful. The only problem it has is with the food. We ordered chocolate monk, mango twist and mango smoothie. The chocolate monk was pretty good, so was the mango smoothie. The mango twist tasted more like cough syrup. Well, we ordered another chocolate monk but it didn't taste like the previous one. Coming to the food we ordered apricot chicken which was the star.  Honey mustard chicken and pizza... Though the chicken tasted good but it wasn't soft. I had tasted better pizza than this. It wasn't that great. Finally the mango mousse was presented in an innovative way and it was good too. The main course has a room for lot of improvement. Otherwise it's a good place.

This is really a nice place to to meet up over a cup of coffee and starter. Service is pretty bad. Waiters are not attentive. Improvements needed! The interior is comfortable. They have open air searing arrangements too.
P.S. Pocket friendly and worth every penny.

Located in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park, wr decided to try out Blue mug which have been in the news feed for quite some time.With the indoor and outdoor seating facilities, it lays down a timely feel.
The seating was a bit convenient though as both high and low seating arrangements were there.Since we were a group of 7 we were alloted a low seating area, however the chairs didn't at all matched the height of table which was pretty much disturbing and inconvenient.
We had Peri Peri chicken,Chicken BbQ pizza,Chicken Stroganoff,Sphagetti pasta in Alfredo sauce and veg pasta.
The amount was okayish for a single person.Bbq chicken pizza was too good, however the Peri Peri chicken was so so, not upto the mark..with the chicken tasted a bit bland.The pastas were good with a bit of less salty.
We finished off with Chocolate cone, mango mousse and mango kulfi.
The only complaint was the Mango kulfi- it tasted like a smoothie and nothing sort of kulfi like though.
Hoping to visit again to try out the other dishes though!!
Happy dining!!

The only disappointing thing about them is their long queues. So if you wish to avoid that, I'd recommend you make prior bookings with them. We got a place after 50 mins. 

However, all that waiting was worth it because of their excellent food. Their service was a little sloppy. With them delaying in taking the orders. We could see our order was ready and was waiting to be served to us, but none of the waiters were serving. After we told them twice did we get our already ready order. 

They took a great deal time in processing the bill. Big disappointment there. 

Coming to the food, that made me overlook all their shortcomings , :

1. Cheese fondue - We order this since they were out of Cottage cheese balls. The cheese sauce was AMAZING. It was so tasty that we didn't leave even a drop of it on the plate unattended. It was not a basic cheese flavoured sauce. It had some other ingredients that made it taste so different, unique and tasty. Strongly recommended. I give it a 4/5. 
2. Cold coffee - (the order they took ages to serve in spite of it being ready) Very smooth and tasty. Has to be one of the best cold coffees I've ever had. I'd give it a 5/5. 
3. BBQ chicken pizza - Tasty, cheesy and full of solid chunks of chicken. Flavour was bang on. They serve thin crust which adds on to the positive points of the dish. I give it a 4/5 
4. Brownie with ice cream - Vanilla icecream on a slice of sizzling hot brownie with simmering chocolate sauce all over. It's a paradise for all chocolate lovers. The brownie was very tasty. Overall a fantastic desert. I give it a 5/5. 

Their quantities are moderately generous. Ambience is good but gets a little too noisy during peak hours so visit it during the day time or evenings during the weekdays for a peaceful and fulfilling experience.

Went there for a friend's birthday. The ambience is beautiful but you will always find a waiting line there so be mentally prepared. Ordered apricot chicken wings, chicken steak sizzler, veg sizzler, bbq chicken pizza ,chilly paneer pizza and KitKat shake and all this for Rs1225 only including taxes. Since the steak sizzler was recommended by alot of ppl I had high expectations but it was just fine nothing great. The portion of the wings was too less.. but the pizzas both veg and chicken were hands down the yummiest and cheesiest and are highly recommended. Also they have really good book collection too and the staff is really friendly.

My review might be an exception when u read the other reviews. But I too heard about this place from my friends n landed up with my friend only to find that there was no place. The place is VERY small. Hardly 7 tables inside. Had to wait outside in the rain for 15 minutes still didn't get a place. Obviously I don't blame anyone but just a word of caution please book a table if that is possible or always keep a plan B..

Have been on my wish list for a long time. This cafe is literally trending.
Visited three days ago, with a friend. It was a friday evening and was quite crowded.¬†
They have both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. We had to wait for 25 minutes to get an outdoor table.¬†
Coming to the food, we ordered Cheese Fondue, Apricot Chicken Wings and Ham Sandwich.
The Cheese Fondue is ultimate love. The apricot chicken wings, were the best part of the evening. The Ham Sandwich was sort of disappointing because it was overflown with capsicum and I don't like it.
The service was friendly and the decor was nice.¬†

Tucked away in one of the bylanes of Jodhpur Park, this one is a surprise.  Not in terms of service, but for taste. These guys serve the best pizzas in town esp. the chicken bbq pizza & veg paneer pizza. The fondue is super too, but the quantity is disappointing. 
But the major let down is the service. You will witness young chaps taking orders from you and running helter skelter in a sort of frenzy, so much so that they end up mixing orders. Also, their order taking looks quite chaotic coz we literally had to wait for 15 mins before a young waiter kindly agreed to take our order. Thank heavens for that !!! Loads of improvement needed in service dept.
The 4 stars are only for the food. I was infact tempted to give a full 5. However, its a - 1 for service. Hoping for the best next time ...

Blue Mug is one of the new Cafes out there that serves the best in house mocktails and quick bites in the region of Jodhpur Park.

The interior is designed in quite a Metro styled way...with hanging Kettles and abstract arts everywhere. Its quite small, but really offers a great lively ambience. Their music choice is very fresh and fun.

The food served here is mostly Italian and american. And the quality is pretty good. I had some tasty sliders here, and washed it down with a mocktail. This place is actually well known for its Blue Lagoon. Try it.

The crowd here is mostly young and casual. Though its a very good place for family outings. 
They have an outdoor seating also, which doesnt have any standing air conditioners or coolers...just normal fans...which is a bit disappointing. This outdoor seating has Swings, which is the main attraction of this cafe. The swings can be booked only if you guys are going in group.

The place is very cost effective, and wont go hard on your pocket..

One thing i liked about Blue Mug is that, the food are very well presented. This will earn Blue Mug some kudo points ;). Also the waiters are very well behaved and fast service is provided here. The staffs are very welcoming and quite fluent with their english. Again kudo points!! :D  

Food suggestion : try their sliders and the pizzas. The mocktail? Well, Blue Lagoon ofcourse..

Food : 4/5

Blue Mug is a nicely decked up food joint at Jodhpur Park, that's famous for the following:
Chicken grilled sandwich
Chicken wings
Coffee ( all types)
Ice tea (specify that you want without added sugar)
Virgin Mojitos ( specify without added sugar syrup)
Chicken steak
And other finger licking foods. 
It caters to the college crowd largely because of its affordability but if you manage to find a table, age doesn't matter, you would fall in love with Blue Mug instantly!

 We ordered brownie shake and then fish fingers . The shake just took my heart away and the fish finger just melted it . Later came chicken lollypop and sizzler.  The sizzler was a lilttle bland but the lollypop was too good.  It was not heavy on our pockets and all in all a good experience

I'll talk about my experience here in segments.

Firstly,the D√©cor isn't mind-blowing.I'd give it a 3.5/5.Frankly the decor doesn't matter much to me as long as the place is neat and the food is good.One thing I'd like to point out and forgot to mention to the management is,the table we sat at was uncomfortably lower than the sofas around it,making it slightly difficult to eat,since we had to bend down.
Coming to the food,I have very little to complain about.We had a Chicken Steak sizzler,Mixed seafood sizzler,Chicken lollipops,Virgin Mojito and A Kitkat shake.
The sizzlers are priced very reasonably,and are a full meal in themselves.The Sauce on the Chicken steak is fantastic.Even the sides of french fries and vegetables which come with the sizzlers are really done well.
The chicken lollipops were a bit too spicy(I enjoy a moderate amount of heat in my food,but it was spicy for me.A lot of people might think it's spiced right,so this is just a personal opinion).
The Virgin Mojito is the best I've ever had.Anywhere.I don't know what they do,but the flavour of the basil is perfectly infused into the lemon-soda base.The Mojitos you get at most fast food joints or cafes don't even come close to this.I would highly recommend this for Summer.
The Kitkat shake is without a doubt another winner.They're generous with the Kitkats and the cream and milk,which makes the shake really rich and thick.This is nothing like the watered down shakes you've been having at most places.The serving size is pretty good,and given how rich this is, you might need two people to finish a single serving.I Highly recommend this.
All in all,full marks for food.
Finally,the service.Service is prompt and the staff are all very polite and helpful.Full marks again.

All in all,I'd highly recommend this place.

I actually fall short of words when it comes to describe how tasty and wonderful dishes they make. Quite a pocket friendly restaurant. They make excellent pizzas. I would highly recommend BBQ pizza, Apricot Chicken wings and Snickers/blueberry shake. Moreover, they do not take VAT if you choose an outdoor seating.

It's located in the interiors of the jodhpur park locality. I wish I could give it a 5stars rating but can't really . 
Food- 4/5
Ambience- 3.5/5
Serivice-5/5
They serve good portions for a few items on the menu and a few items need an increase in portions they serve. We ordered virjin mojito(green apple flavoured), chocolate cone, cafe mocha, chicken nachos, apricot chicken wings and fish&chips. The mojito is the best one I've had so far. It is served in a tall glass and has the perfect freshness in it. The nachos are damn good in taste but then again they got really soggy. The wings were very small is size. Those were mini wings on a plate. The taste was good. Very new and interesting. The chocolate cone is a bit weird. It needs some remaking . Also care should be taken so that it's convenient to have it. Would've loved it if it had a bitter exterior. The coffee was okayish. The fish and chips started off as amazing as the first fish fillet was thick and tasty . But the second one was thin and therefore lacked taste. All over, it's a new place which has lots of rooms for improvement and at the same time has a huge potential. Would surely visit it again in future. Also, their prices are inclusive of taxes :)

We decided to try the place out , late evening .

It was quite busy when we entered , so we decided to grab a seat outside to which we were attended by our waiter who seemed friendly and gave us quick service .

Ordered Milkshakes which was average ,but had a lovely garnish and came in nice glasses .

Service could have been better when it came to the milkshakes . We ordered for two Milkshakes and we got them with 15 mins gap between one .

The food was decent , club sandwich wasn't bad .

However I did have a small incident with my food, to which my waiter handled poorly .

Value for money yes !

Ordered chicken steak and barbeque chicken burger both were good. Service was really clumsy .. ordered 2 chicken steak served one first along with the burgers n forgot about the second plate, after about 30mins when we asked how long will you take to prepare the second one, they said "should we serve now?" And took another 20mins to serve ... Had it been ready what took sooo long. They completely forgot about the second plate. Also they give special treatment to their regulars like the manager and waiters all were busy opening the door for regulars n busy arranging tables for them. When we called out to enquire about food they were least interested in attending. Also we had asked for a proper table for 4 , but were provided a low seating area n they said would provide a proper table as gets vacated, which they completely ignored later n served us their itself. ( It's not easy having bending down on a low table neither is it convenient putting the plate on your lap n trying to cut a meat into pieces). Had bookmarked this place n was so eager to try out but really disappoint

** WORST SERVICE ... DON'T GO**

Few words are coming into my mind while writing the review  : "I won't go there and would suggest everyone not to go there on Summer".

On a sunday afternoon around 2 p.m we went there. As usual the place was crowded and we were in a rush so went outside and got a table soon. The interior and exterior decoration were good . But the exterior decoration could heve been better. 

We told them to inform us whenever the table for 2 people would be available inside,they said yes but they were soooo busy attending the customers sitting inside.. We kept on waiting then gave the order. We ordered chocolate munk,mango twist, apricot chicken wings and honey mustered chicken which was served with french fries and a good quantity of rice. Apricot chicken wings was over fried not so good.

The most irritating part was if you have outdoor seating arrangement then there should be atleast one attendee who would take care of the customers. All of the staffs were busy inside. Our table was soooo full with the empty dishes, no one was there to remove our empty plates. Then we asked them for the bill for 4 times.. every time they said yes we are preparing your bill then no one was coming with the bill.. another 15 mins passed we again requested for the bill... Got the same ans and same expression. 

So the final conclusion is : 

Ambience : 1
Food : 1
Location : 1
Service : (-3)

A very cute little neighborhood cafe, which offers  reasonably priced food. The apricot chicken wings were outstanding, as was the honey mustard chicken.
However, the pizza was dry and underwhelming and the chicken steak sizzler was nothing to write home about. The oreo shake was delicious and redeemed the evening. Service was quite slow and careless. It also felt like the same dishes were not being consistent across tables. This certainly calls for improvement.

So, it was there in my wishlist for a long time ....
And finally yesterday i visited the Blue Mug Cafe ..
The ambience was romantic with some soothing music, lights, hanging kettle , all were bang on..
Coming to food ,
If you are a pizza lover
Then you should visit it .. they make one of the best chessy pizza ... :)
Mexican fries was yumm ...
The shake was the winner of the day:)
Only problem which I faced was that we were provided a seat at outdoor, as the indoor seats was not vacant .. but as it was noon, it was hot..so we told them to inform us when there will be space for two .. They said yes but they keep on providing seats for the new customer rather than informing us ..
:(

Blue Mug cafe is located at Jodhpur Park and it's easily traceable. The cafe looks nice from outside. ¬†We visited the cafe around 5:00 pm and literally had to wait for almost 2 hours to get a seat. The interior of the cafe is very well decorated and the staffs were really nice and amicable.Now, we ordered apricot chicken wings, chicken sandwich , chicken steak and fruit salaria. The best dish award goes to apricot chicken wings and it's a must try. Service could have been better.To sum up, we really had a great time in Blue Mug.

We went to blue mug to celebrate my friend's birthday. We took a cake. When she was cutting the cake they played birthday song. The manger was very polite and he warmly welcome us and apologise as we have to wait. We orderd crispy fried prawn for starters and chicken salami pizza n cafe latte. Fried prawn was yummy and the pizza was ok not anything extraordinary and same for the coffee. The place was nicely decorated and the ambience was very nice. One can also sit outside. We spent a good time there with my friend Shilpa Bhowmik

Blue Mug is a must visit cafe in 1/121, Jodhpur Park locality üôå
Interior and exterior both have been made quite nicely. At the entrance there are small tubs and trees which looks good. The moment we walked in, we found long couches with wide and long glass tables along with small stools, iron chairs and tables, a shelf containing couple of books which are free to read and play with fingers over pages, colorful bottles, a guitar in a corner - which one can use to play and sing if wants, beside this a keyboard. Lighting systems have been done nicely with teapots and chains hanging from the ceiling which makes the place impressive overall, although many small things here and there yet spacious and breathing.
An extended part under asbestos feels like balcony which has been decorated beautifully with a swing, small cushions, tables-chairs made of iron and glass, woods and this entire part is protected with green fence of trees, one can definitely enjoy fresh air while sipping over coffee or on hand licking foods, one can use as smoking zone either way. Overall inside ambiance makes the place pleasing, relaxing atmosphere, a soothing place with background musics They can though improve on the background music collection, note it down please ü§ì

Their air conditioning system works really bad, they really really need to improve on this. It's hard to eat sizzlers where air conditioner is a low-paid system.

Foods we have tried are as follows :
o Mexican Chicken Bowl : Served with rice, a bowl of shredded chicken prepared with veggies, rajma. Tested bit spicy, huu
o Honey mastered Chicken : Served with rice, french fries, a good piece of chicken, prepared in honey. I preferred if the chicken was more of soft, moist, juicy and succulent than hard and veggies but cabbage leafs were under season, wasn't fresh!
o Veg sandwiches : Served with 4 pieces of sandwiches, nicely stuffed with vegetables, tested good, it was topped with onions, potatoes chips, and sauce in a tiny bowl.
o Coconut payes : Tested somewhat of mousse which was filled with coconut pieces. It was light and fluffy.
o Chocolate cone : No other specification required.
o Chicken steak sizzler : It was unexpectedly poor in terms of test and it wasn't moist, soft or succulent in terms of quality rather hard to bite. I couldn't eat it. Thumbs down for this item.
o Chicken club sandwich : It was a delight to have. 
o BBQ chicken pizza : It tested good, test was sweet.

Service was good. Our table attendant needs to pay attention in detail of orders, needs to be trained more to provide helpful information while placing orders. Management was attentive and checked on us couple of times if the foods were okay which covers up the service overall. Apart from our table attendant staffs were friendly, helpful and courteous.
Overall a pleasant experience, relaxing atmosphere. Would absolutely like to repeat again üòÅGo, try this place today.

Note* VAT and S. TAX extra. 

Overall satisfaction ||

I went yesterday with my friends for my birthday. The ambience is nice. The shakes and mocktails are amazing. We had a crispy prawn in starters...it was amazing and very well prepared. Then we had sizzlers - chicken steak, grilled fish and seafood. Chicken steak and grilled fish were very good but didn't like the seafood much. I really loved the place and would love to visit again.

This place is perfect for a brunch with old friends
Perfect ambience perfect food the staff were very polite 
It's located near jodhpur park
A cute little cafe with a blue door and they used blue kettles for decoration.How cute!
 We ordered 2 appetisers 
 ‚Ä¢ Mexican French Fries
They gave a really nice quantity of spicy fries with tomato sauce 
 ‚Ä¢ crunchy garlic filled mushrooms 
 Six pieces of pure bliss. Loved the flavour the garlic gave to it. They served it with mayo dip
 Then we ordered 2 mocktails and one shake
 ‚Ä¢ fruit Sangria 
 I personally really liked it, mocktail with lots of fresh fruits. Perfect combination to relax with in this summer
 ‚Ä¢ choco monk
 This is a new addition to their menu
Chocolate flavour mocktail with whipped cream
 ‚Ä¢ brownie Shake
Thick chocolate shake with big chunks of brownie and generous amount of whipped cream
 Moving on to the main course
We ordered 2 chicken steak sizzlers
Thick chicken pieces in mushroom sause with fries and veggies 
The chicken was so rich and filling loved the flavour.
Cottage cheese garlic sizzler was also very nice, the quantity was enough to fill two stomachs 
We also ordered chicken stroganoff
Herbed rice with veggies and chicken gravy and salad
Which was a bit disappointing as the gravy had very small and less chicken pieces
The total bill was somewhere near 1700 and i think it's perfectly priced
Overall a very good experience 
Visiting the place soon

This has to be a part by part review as I have to visit Blue Mug again to try their main course. I had the desserts. The Mango mousse, the Blueberry mousse and Lychee Mousse, accompanied with the Choco Cone. The Blueberry mousse was my favourite out of the first three, it had the perfect consistency of a mousse and the taste of Blueberry was dominant and tasted like heaven. The Lychee Mousse was surprisingly very good with a perfect Lychee taste adding to the mousse. The mango mousse could have been a tad bit better. Well for the Choco Cone, I soiled my hand with it but it was worth it. Solid chocolate Cone with brownie inside and some chocolate cream and sprinklers, it was a chocolate lover's paradise. The cafe is very cute but it mostly jam packed as it is trending quite a lot these days. The outdoor seating looks beautiful so does the indoor kettles and rest of the decor. The music could be turned down to be a little soothing. That would make it perfect for conversations.

300th Review! :)

***Rating is based on the Starters, Service & Price***

Well a visit to Blue Mug was due since it's inception. Within a very short time this place has created a lot of buzz and we could see the efforts of the management and the staff to make the guest experience a good one!

We had a number of items but I absolutely loved the starters and will give the names of the best ones here -

Crunchy Garlic filled Mushrooms
Cottage Cheese Balls
Cheese Fondue
Cheese Fish Fry

The main course and dessert both have rooms for improvement. So no suggestions as of now.

But yes, definitely recommended for having finger licking starters!

This cool new cafe is located in Jodhpur Park. Right opposite of Tandoor Park, towards the end of the lane. There are two seating arrangements - Inner and Outdoor arrangement. We had just gone there for some beverages. My friend ordered masala tea and I got Blue Lagoon. Both of the items were good enough. The decoration is good and ambience is good as well.
Edit.20.08.17 : This time we ordered Chicken Club Sandwich, Blueberry Smoothie and Snickers Smoothie. And every item was satisfying. Worth the price. Tasty and also the portion was good.

This place was there in my bucket list for a long  time. Certainly the wait for visiting this place was worth. Went in the afternoon and it was quite crowded which shows its craze. Anyways the decor was too good with kettles,books,paintings. The weekends was different.Service was also good. The staffs were friendly too. We ordered  BarBQ pizza, Apricot Chicken,Blueberry shake and Brownie shake. Everything was too tasty and definitely worth the money.Surely many more visits here. Overall a very good experience.

One fine Sunday evening, got a chance to visit this place. The place was packed already because, weekend and too much of crowd. After waiting for around 15-20 minutes outside finally got place and we comforted ourselves in the inside seating area of the caf√© and not the outside one. This caf√© is sure very beautiful and eye catchy. Ordered chicken club sandwich, chicken burger, one Margherita pizza and two chicken salami pizza. Sandwich and burger were good but coming to the pizza, the crust was very crunchy and in Margherita pizza, excessive amount of onions and capsicum were there and it didn't taste much good to me. Salami pizza was Okay-ish. Service was although good and quick. Prices are also on the lower side. Next time hope to taste something better and new.

The cafe is beside HP gas office, Jodhpur park. We had a bit difficulty finding the place. They provide both indoor and outdoor seating. Remember to take some time in your hand before going because you have to wait for minimum an hour before you get to seat. Its always packed with people all throughout the day. But THE FOOD IS WORTH THE WAIT! 
We ordered french fries, Chicken wings, Penne pasta with carbonara sauce and BBQ chicken pizza. All these food cost us only 500/- , which is pretty cheap. The quality of the food was excellent specially the chicken wings and the pizza was loaded with cheesy. Quantity was also quite sufficient and also the price. Its a very nice place to hangout with good music. The staff are well behaved and they ask and make sure that we like the food, they take feedbacks from us. 
All together i really liked the ambience and ofcourse the food. I recommend everyone to check this place out.

Became one of my favorite. Nice cafe with very reasonable price. Had been there twice. Coffees & Mocktails were tasty. I became a fan of their crispy prawn. Apricot chicken wings is quite tasty bt amount keeps you unsated. Main course items like grilled fish & chicken steak were good but it is their appetizers which are more tastier. A very nice ambience. U can chill in a hot evening with ur friends here.

This quaint place in jodhpur park has been gaining a lot of popularity recently especially with their chique retro fusion interiors, cozy outdoor seating, and of course, cheap and tasty food. They have a good collection of hot beverages and a vareity of cuisines to offer, comfort food all of them. Music lovers can try their hand at the instruments kept in the cafe. The chicken stroganoff deserves a special mention.

Food is good and worth the price. Taste is good ..
The service is very slow though. We had cheese fondue which was very tasty...the Americano could be better. The French fries are awesome. The Chocolate monk was a huge disappointment...and a real waste of money.
Ambience needs to be lot better. The outdoor seating suits smokers..but the inside should be a little more cosy. The place being small, it's a little unorganized.
Overall, it's a nice place....very apt if you're a group of 5-6 friends hanging out.

Awesome place with awesome  food. I had to sit outside  because the inner air conditioned part was totally full. The outer part is well decorated but hot.  Food tastes good. We ordered fish finger  which was delicious. For main course we had chicken steak and black forest cake for sweet dish.  It doesn't  charge Vat and service tax right now so u pay only for the food. Happy with the service. I ll be more happy if they would  cover the outer part with glass or something and make it  air conditioned. Because  its just too hot outside.

This cafe has been trending for quite some time.
Reason: amazing food at dirt cheap prices.
It is located at the bylanes of Jodhpur Park and is not that difficult to locate if u follow Google Maps.

The ambience is cosy and nice although the seating arrangements could be better. They have outdoor seating arrangements too but will that come handy only on evenings or winter season.

Coming to the food:
1. Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce: comes with herbed rice, veggies, mashed potatoes and a bowl of lemon butter sauce. The fish was tender and flaky from inside and had a nice outer texture. It was pan seared and then grilled. Not perfect. But good enough. The lemon butter sauce was very buttery. Tasted good with a hint of lime. I wish they served two fillets but you get served only 1 piece.
2. Chicken honey mustard: Comes with herbed rice, french fries and pickled salad. The chicken was moist on the inside with nice grilled marks on top. The texture on the outside was sticky as it was well bruushed with honey and mustard. It was a good dish and the hint of sweetness from honey makes the dish very appetizing.
3. Chicken cordon blue: served with french fries and veggies. The chicken cordon blue tasted amazing. Especially the cheese sauce on top. The chicken on the inside was well wooked and the outer crust was crisp ( deep fried ).
4. Chicken steak sizzler: Served with veggies and french fries. It was brought with a lot of theatrics involving smoke and the sizzling sound all around. The chicken steak were nicely cooked chicken breast pieces which were coated in a rich brown mushroom sauce. The chicken was tender and not chewy and the brown sauce was tad bit salty but amazing.
5. Coconut kheer: it was chilled coconut mousse. Good taste. The term kheer is a misnomer here.
6. Chocolate cone: Chocolate mousse filled inside a dark chocolate cone , sprinkled with bits of chocolate.  Too much chocolatey. Chocolate lovers can savour this dish at any time of the day.

Overall a good visit! Looking to try their pizzas next time.

USP: no taxes. Really affordable. Perfect for hangout. Cosy ambience. Great food.

Blue Mug was making shor in the city for quite a few times... So it became essential to visit this place for the second time... This time I reached with my group of foodie friends... And what can you expect from this hungry hunters... Yes we just ate it all... Both the outdoor n indoor seating was very beautiful... It was a week day but still the place was fully crowded... Also their was a large crowd waiting outside... And as our food journey progressed the reason behind the popularity reveled... We tried a nos of dishes which are as follows...

‚òÖ Yuga Fizz~ Extremely refreshing... basically it was a very well made virgin mojito...

‚òÖ Red Eye~ It's a spicer drink... Presented well but I personally didn't like tomato based drinks...

‚òÖ Granita~ Mind blowing... watermelon based... A must try over here...

‚òÖ Oreo shake~ Another extremely well made n well presented drinks...

‚òÖ Cheese fondue~ Lovely one...

‚òÖ Crunchy garlic filled mushrooms~ Very good...

‚òÖ Cottage cheese balls~ Another tasty and yummy dish...

‚òÖ‚òÖ Cheesey fish fry~ A highly recommend dish... Must try over here... So cheesy and so tasty... Out of the world...

‚òÖ‚òÖ Apricot chicken wings~ Mind blowing... Awesome...

‚òÖ Crispy fried prawns~ Extremely tasty...

‚òÖ Chicken club sandwich~ Good but not nothing great...

‚òÖ Honey mustard chicken~ Awesome one...

‚òÖ Chicken steak sizzler~ Superb one...

‚òÖ Fish in lemon butter sauce sizzler~ Excellent... The quality of fish was fresh and when it came on a sizzler plate... What can you expect more... 

‚òÖ Blue Mug Special Sundae~ Very tasty n what a presentation... A must try also...

‚òÖ Black Forest pastries~ Soft n Fresh...

‚òÖ Chocolate Pastries~ It was not fresh... Otherwise it tasted good...

All in all extremely good experience with the food... But they are running short in the service... They are not enough trained to handle such a huge crowd... Also the staffs are not well trained... They need more training... They‚Äã need to understand the basics of serving... Guys serve it with a smile on your face... Enjoy your job... That's all... I'm rating them high only on ambience, decor n food...

Its a cosy place tucked away in Jodhpur park.The cafe is small so getting a table can be difficult.The staff is courteous.
I ordered the cottage cheese garlic sizzler..though the quantity was decent i feel the taste could be much better.Not very impressed with the sizzler.
For my sweet tooth i ordered the blue mug sundae and mango mousse.The blue mug sundae is heavy so u should have room in ur stomach before u order that.The mango mousse was nice and refreshing.
Its a nice place so il try some other stuff in my next visitüòä

It is located in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park and its an incredibly beautiful cafe. We had to wait for about 15 mins before we could get a seat 'cause the space is less. There's an outdoor sitting area too but it was full when we entered. The place is filled with kettle themed lights and upbeat music.

We had chicken barbeque pizza which tasted awesome. We had cheese fondue which they served with bread sticks and garlic-cheese-dip. The dip was so soothing. Everyone should try their chicken apricot wings, its something I've never had anywhere and it had a slight tinge of sweetness to it. We had flavoured cappuccinos which were pretty good. The chicken club sandwich was oh so filling. We ended with a choco marvel cake that tasted heavenly. And we parcelled a chicken burger. All these for around 850 bucks. The price is very reasonable.

I can't wait to visit again!

Thumbs Up :
Extremely pretty d√©cor and they play great music !
Good portions with good value for money.

Thumbs Down :
The staff here are occasionally unresponsive and mess up the order chart quite frequently.

Food :

Mocktails -
-> Pina Colada - Sweet sweet goodness !
-> Fizzy Lemon - A tad too lemon-y.
-> Virgin Mojito - Usual mix, pretty great.

Starters -
-> Crispy Fried Prawns - House favorite. This crispy crunchy plate of prawns was absolutely delicious !
-> Cheese Fondue - The presentation was beautiful. However, instead of the garlic cubes, we were served with bread sticks. And the Bechamel just didn't add up.
-> Chicken Lollipop - Sticky juicy pieces of sweet delicious chicken !

Mains -
-> Margarita Pizza - Beautifully made pizza with perfect flavours and bread. The cheese on top was exactly how you'd want it, SUPER CHEESY !
-> Chicken Steak - The rice was beautifully cooked and fit perfectly with the chicken.
-> Grilled Fish Sizzler - The lemon butter sauce was spot on. The fish however, I personally feel lacked flavour.
-> Chipotle BBQ wings sizzler - Nothing brilliant about it. The wings were small and lacked depth in flavour.

Desserts -
-> Coconut Payesh - Basically coconut flavoured whipped cream. Beautiful presentation though.
-> Chocolate Marble Cake - This is one of the best dessert combination I've had in a while. Looks beautiful, Tastes better !

An absolute favorite of mine, I've visited this place numerous times in the last couple of months. A cosy interior, friendly waiters, good food at reasonable price, this place is a dream come true. 
Their Oreo shake and Marvel cake are my personal favorites and I would recommend everyone to try these out. Sandwiches are filling, the burger and steak is yummy and totally worth every penny. Love going there again and again.

As a Bangali, I do tend to side with well prepared Fish Preparations when offered with the option of gorging on similar potential favourite proteins. The same thing happened, when I settled myself inside Blue Mug Cafe. 

We ordered some of the crowd favourites, which included the very tasty and smoky Apricot Chicken Wings, Crunchy garlic Fried Mushrooms, Cottage Cheese balls, extremely sinful cheese fondue and statement making crispy fried prawns.

While I loved all of that, what stood out for me was the Cheese Fish Fry. That constantly dribbling of melted cheese entices you every time you break into that perfectly crumbed and fried fish fry. Served with the sides of French Fries and Coleslaw, this is an absolute must try, regardless whether you love fish or not. This deep fried phenomenon is all set to win the crowd over and that is exactly what it has been doing.

The mains are no less impressive. The favourites have been the Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce Sizzler and the Chicken Steak Sizzler.

We gulped all of this down with a healthy serving of the oreo shake, yuzu fizz and the ganita.

The place offer not only some good pot warming food, but also a very lively ambience that welcomes people of all ages. The sitting arrangement on the pavement is extremely cute and poses as one of the main attraction of the place.

Its a nice little cozy place opened up by the lanes of Jodhpur Park. Really nice place. Nice trendy decor. Good choices made while assorting the menu. 

Coming to the food.. definitely try their mushroom balls. Heavenly. Beverages are fine. So is the food. Pasta was lil bitt let down to my liking. 
Prawn Mediterranean salad is quite well done. 

The highlight for this place is its a grt place to hangout with friends or bring in your date. It has the feel good factor in collective sense. Ome more thing to feel good about ?? Its the pocket friendly fare of this place. ! 

Bon appetit and happy adda ! !

Thursday evening went to this place. It has been trending for the right reasons. Loved the quirky interiors. The covers were laid in a compact manner. Some of my friends were already sitting inside so dint had to wait in the long que outside the cafe. 

Coming to food now. We ordered several food items along with some drinks.

*cheese fish fry
*cottage cheese balls
*crispy fried prawns
*chicken club sandwich
*fish in lemon butter sauce sizzler
*honey mustard chicken
*blue mug special sundae

All the above food items were good. Cheese fish fry is a must try. Oreo shake was awesome. Crispy fried prawns will be favourite for all prawn lovers. The dessert blue mug special sundae was a treat to the eyes and taste buds!.

Over all experience was fantastic! Would recommend all the foodies! Good job team blue mug!

Writing about this place now and recollecting the items I had is truly very difficult because most of the items I had were exceptionally good. I'm not going to delay introducing you to the varieties of food that they have in store for you by jibber-jabbering, so let's get right into it, shall we? 

Cheese Fondue: HANDS DOWN, BEST ITEM FROM THEIR APPETIZER SECTION. The melted cheese was very well seasoned and the dish was very well tied together. Do give this one a try. 

Oreo Shake: Another favorite. Rich, creamy and very delicious. If you are big on shakes, don't miss out on this one. 

Apricot Chicken Wings: Delicious, no doubt. Glazed nicely in apricot sauce, this dish would definitely get your tummy rolling. 

Cheese Fish Fry: Cheese, fish- it all comes together in one dish. A total lip smacker if you ask me. 

Crispy Fried Prawns: Very crispy, very crunchy. I personally thought it lacked a little depth of flavor. But all in all, it was a good starter. 

Chicken Club Sandwich: Comes in four pieces,with a side of chips and dip. I think this is a well-satisfactory dish and its taste does not disappoint. 

Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce: Another spot-on dish. A must-try for all fish lovers out there. 

Honey Mustard Chicken Sizzler: A great main course. Although I like my honey mustard sauce a tad bit different, theirs were not too bad either. 

Blue Mug Special Sundae: Delicious layers of surprises concealed inside a cocktail glass. This item, no doubt is a total winner!

This is a very pretty caf√© with nice outdoor as well as indoor seating. The food is a standard good fare - particularly enjoyed the Apricot Chicken Wings which  were very well made while the BBQ Chicken Pizza left much to be desired as it was neither cheesy enough nor was the crust soft enough. The Oreo Shake was a very refreshing drink. The Chicken Steak Sizzler while well made took a lot of time to arrive and the same was true for the Honey Mustard Chicken. The latter was accompanied by a particularly fragrant and flavourful rice and the veggies were also well cooked. All in all, while some of the items were really good, some others left much to be desired and the service could be slightly more prompt to improve the experience of dining at this place.

Nice place and always high on demand.
Decent decor with both indoor and outdoor sitting.
But one thing which didn't feel right was that I had made reservations way before arriving yet they couldn't allot us a seperate table for two. Instead we were made to share. While another couple who arrived much later were conveniently provided a sitting as per their choice.
Apart from this confusion in the rush hours, the place is pretty amazing.
Food was great. In addition to that there's also a huge array of tea and coffee to choose from.
The best part,easy on the pocket!

Tucked in the interiors of Jodhpur Park, this cafe has been making headlines lately because of numerous reasons. Apart from an attractive indoor seating facility comprising of sufficient tables, there's a serene outdoor arrangement designed specially for cold winter evenings and on days when the humidity is not bestowed upon the customers.¬†
This cafe has been stylishly set up and most of the dishes are reasonably priced as far as food quality and the decor is concerned. Being an ardent fan of tenderloin steak, I found its unavailability pretty hard to sink in and had to go for their chicken alternative. Thankfully, I was rewarded with a soft, succulent, juicy little dish I enjoyed every bite of. My friend absolutely enjoyed her chicken sizzler. The chicken wings we started off with were pretty delicious too. It was slightly annoying to wait for a long time to see our main courses arrive since we were haplessly hungry, the food, of course, amended the dreadful situation.¬†
Bonus points for playing songs of some of the finest bands. How often do we hear progressive rock in a cafe in Kolkata? Very pleased with my experience.

Its a nice place, though due to high demand we didn't get the chance of enjoying the AC. But the open area was good. And the foods were good, mainly the ice tea(its like amrito at hot summer noon) staffs are well behaved. overall its a good place to hangout n also for sudden plan it is a good place.

We went around 7pm, the place was filled and we had to wait around 40 mins to get in. We got seated in the outdoor which was okay .The ambience was nice. The staffs were friendly and apologized for the long wait time .We ordered one cottage cheese pizza which was served soon enough . The pizza was too good ,loaded with cheese .One of the best pizza's in town .And the price is also reasonable .Will be definitely going back .

Hearing a lot about this place,we went to check it out.
Loud music, non co-operative staff ( though there are an excess of them for such a small place, only one of them is just helped, others kept pushing each other for doing the job)
The food quality was horrible
We ordered 1.oreo shake ( too sweet and tasted like cold coffee) 2. Bbq chicken pizza ( there was hardly any chicken and lots of veggies)
3. Lamb sizzler ( quantity was toooo less and the lamb was not nice)
I really had high hopes but it is just sad that I couldn't say it was good

I'd begin by saying we entered to find out The Cafe was full in the moment, we had to wait. Around 4:30ish. So table booking is recommended. Moving on, the place is extremely lit and has pretty flashy interiors. Ambience is pretty amazing. It also has outdoor seating where we were given a place. But I'd rather recommend to not choose that in this heat. Food wise, The Apricot chicken wings are a definite suggestion. Oreo shake is heavy and tasty at the same time. My personal favourite was the Orange mojito which was really on point. Pretty damn tasty. Service and time to serve cost them a few points also a foodie with an appetite like mine was disappointed to find out that they don't serve the 12" pizzas inspite of being present in the menu... so that costs another half... Overall pretty impressive as a cafe. I do actually look forward for a second visit and try out new items in their list if they're available, that is. Peace.

Been here twice already. The first time didn't go as expected. There was a power cut due to which most of the food items weren't available. Neither were the milkshakes and smoothies. Had settled for a Blue Lagoon. I never really liked blue lagoon in my life but this particular drink was one colourful mocktail i'd seen.

Today, post a tedious mock-test, i visited again with my friends(cause serious hunger pangs). The place was packed as usual so we were asked to wait for about 15 minutes but were soon called in. We ordered a Chicken Club Sandwich and a Chocolate Cone. The sandwich was pretty amazing, just the way i like it. Served with potato chips and ketchup this sandwich would perfectly pair with a cup of coffee and a book.

The ambiance is a 10/10. The place is buzzing with people yet it is not chaotic. The staff were really courteous, rather jovial. The decorations are not overdone. I love how hygienic the cafe is. Thumbs up to that. They also serve proper meals at insanely affordable rates. Definitely going to try those out.

Blue Mug is a perfect place to hangout with friends and even family. Cozy little cafe that would suit almost everyone without costing you a lot of money.
Surely going to visit again.

Small joint..cozy..nicely decorated..now comes to the food..we ordered blueberry shake, monsoon espresso, Mexican French fries and BBQ chicken pizza. All are delicious..very soothing music was going on the back round..the bill was 450 only..so value for money...I like it everything except the waiting part.

Very average. Although it has a nice outdoor seating area, Blue Mug leaves much to be desired. Opening time is 11 AM but it's safer to reach after 12 as this is not sacrosanct. Service is slow, food unremarkable. The only thing Blue Mug has going for it is location.

Blue mug, jodhpur park
Was in my wish list since March so I ended up visiting twice in this month.. 
Experienced both indoor and outdoor seating,both were different and I liked the decor of hanging kettles ,bottles and lamp in coconut shell.. 
They have guitar, piano and books for entertainment.. 
And favorite songs were played and trust me one can't be bored.. 
 So we tried different dishes.. 
We ordered:
*Crispy fried prawns with sweet chili sauce 
*apricot chicken wings
*fish fingers with Mayo dip
*chicken lollipop 
*BBQ chicken pizza 
*chicken club sandwich 
*chicken steak sizzlers
In desserts we tried:
*choco cone 
*hot Brownie with vanilla scoop and chocolate sauce 
*blueberry cheese cake 
Beverages:
*lemonade 
*blue lagoon
*Oreo shake
*red eye
              All the  dishes are inclusive of taxes so no extra vat tax and good food at reasonable prices.. 
Don't forget to book a table üòäüòä
Love to visit again!

Thankyou Blue mug for the amazing hospitality.

We booked a table via zomato before visiting. Still after reaching the place we had to wait for around ten minutes after which we were alloted the table which had the swing. Such a cute cozy place that was!

Coming to the food, here's what we ordered:

Chicken Steak Sizzler
Chicken Cordon Bleu
Chicken Mexican Rice Bowl
Choclate cone.
The food was extremely delectable and our tummies were more than happy. :D

The service was excellent and prices are reasonable too.

I am coming back very soon. Looking forward to another perfect evening. :)

A bit inside Jodhpur Park, Blue Mug is a small place with good food and good service. In my opinion, the beverages fare better than the food. Oreo shake is quite filling. BBQ pizza is a neat, meaty pizza with a thick crust (I like thin). The Earl Grey I had here was amazing.
Service was nice. Also look out for the cute white cat. It's generally lazy and does nothing but is cute.

This adorable and very popular cafe is situated in jodhpur park.
For people travelling from salt lake area and want to avail the public transport, take the S9 and get down at the final stop and then take an auto from there.
Now coming to the cafe, it is a small yet cozy place which can seat 20+ people inside and 15+ people outside. It is always crowded and it is recommended to book a table via zomato if you donot want to wait.
The ambience is really nice and there are books and a guitar for our entertainment. Coming to the food we were a party of 6 and we ordered a penne pasta in white sauce, spagetti in white sauce, bbq chicken pizza, bbz chicken burger, fish finger, french fries, a lemonade and a couple of oreo shakes.
The food was good and quantity was satisfying. The oreo shake is amazing and a must have. The fish finger had fresh fish really good.
It was a pocket friendly lunch.
Will I visit again- Yes! Even more as my grandmoms house is right there and also cause I have fallen in love with this place.

Dropped in here finally after waiting for so long...but the wait was worth it as this now is one of my favourite hangout places in the city. 
Ambience : Perfect. The blue theme is a treat to the eyes, the paintings and wall hangings are cool and the kettle-lights hanging above the tables are innovative. 
Food : Now the purpose of my visit was FOOD . We ordered ; 

Margarita pizza - Nice pizza, not the best I have had but was satisfying. As I am not quite a fan of thin crust pizzas this was a relief. (4/5)
Veg Club Sandwich - Very filling and crispy , the veggies were loaded in there which I prefer in my sandwiches :P (4.5/5)
Cottage cheese balls - These balls tasted very good...were big in size and crunchy, only if the amount of black pepper would be less this would have been mind blowing. (4/5)
Oreo Shake - This was the show-stealer . Tasted heavenly , the cream and the crumbed oreo was a perfect blend.. (5/5)

Service : I hope the service gets better with time. We had to wait for 45 mins to get the food placed on our table. But the staff were very courteous and humble.

Must visit :)

Serves good food for reasonable price without VAT or TAX. I recommend this place to everyone but keep in mind to avoid rush hours or you will have to wait outside. The Pizza they serve is way better than the pizza giants Pizza Hut or Dominoes with reasonable price. Staffs were good. This place is good to go and sit for long hours with a pocket pinch of 500-600 for 2. Overall the experience was good if I avoid the power cut and the waiting time.

Though the cafe is new,but it surely is a crowd puller.Can't really point out anything wrong in this cafe,be it the mouth watering delicacies,the ambience with outdoor setup or the hospitality.The unique thing that caught my attention is that they will present you the most simple food in such a decorative manner.It is a treat for the eye as well.The pink panther mocktail can give tough competition by its taste and presentation.The experience was a beautiful one and will be returning soon to for a new cuppa !

Service is very poor, asked for tobasco sauce, came after i finished my food, asked for water, no body responded, so had to take it myself from the shelf..

And when I found hair on my food.. i got this.. a dish that I did not order.. and a very cold reaction from the floor staff.

Ordered white tea, which wasn't white at all..

And defective rocking chairs..

And took 30mins to just give the bill..

From drinks to the foods everything is satisfactory and the stuffs are cooperative.
We took -
Oreo Shake which was pretty good though the sweetness level was a bit high but you can definitely try out their Virgin mojito which is nice and refreshing.
One Barbecue Chicken Burger which i liked the most and¬†
one Chicken Club Sandwich with really soft tasty Mushroom Balls.
We had all of these at an affordable price as they charge no VAT.
And just like that my last sunday was perfectly sorted,planning to revisit soon.

Do not order the OREO shake. It is not as viscous as needed. Chocolate feel is also missing.
Chicken Club Sandwich and Masala cold drink is a great meal to have here.
Nice out here in the evenings.
Try out the banana and kulfi smoothies.¬†
Burger is great and served with chips.
Also, honey mustard chicken and chicken sizzler is a treat to have.
Don't order heavy. Just eat light and enjoy.¬†
It seems that advanced table booking policy has been changed and you need to be present to be allotted a table. Cheers.
Good neighborhood.

I have been real eager to visit this place for quite a long time. Finally, visited this one hell of a fine place and it really made up to its expectations. The atmosphere was so nice. The prawn vegetables and the prawn Mediterranean salad were top notch. The BBQ burger and the BBQ pizza were good too. The blue lagoon mocktail was an add on. But, the service was slow which is a negative point. Yet, this place is quite reasonable and has taken up a place in my heart .Eager to drop by sooner than later. 
Visited the place again. Had honey mustard chicken which was yummilicious , chocolate monk was quite nice and the blueberry mousse was an added pleasure. The only thing that needs upgradation is their service which is very slow and poor.

Well thanks to Zomato that I got to know about blue mug. Located a few meters away from south city is a beautifully decorated place having both indoor and outdoor. We took the outdoor table which is really beautiful with plants n swing around. 
This is what we ordered-
1. Virgin mojito - nice and refreshing.
2. Chicken salami pizza- we wanted the 12' one but they said its not available so went for 8'. Loaded with lots of cheese , sliced chicken salami and bellpepers n other veggies its was heavily in taste!
3. Chicken steak sizzler - didn't expect it toh this good! It was awesome! With the steak itself being the show stellar the gravy was good too! Accompanied by veggies and French fries.
4. Black forest cake - this was taken on their recommendations. Its taste the same like you get in normal bakery. Tasty but not as good as the rest!
Note- a bit slow in service but the main problem is the open smoking that's allowed! Others not smoking will have problem!

That apart I would love to visit this place again!

I went to Blue Mug on a Sunday evening with my friends and just love the food and the ambience. They have both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. Though the indoors looked pretty, we chose to sit outdoor because it has a swing! A swing seat with tools and chairs make it perfect for an evening hangout with friends. Too pocket friendly for a cafe serving such delicious food....

Went to this place yesterday after hearing about it. To my dissappointed, the place was really bad. Bad ambience with nothing to write about. place is all cramped up with very limited seating capacity.  The outside seating is okay with nothing out of the ordinary. we were seated at the entrance of the cafe. Food was average with virgin mojito being too salty and man, who puts boiled broccoli in pasta!!!  Dont know why people wait  to get a seat to this below par cafe. Doesn't see a bright future for it, when south city opens up in a few months. Nothing great about it. Dissappointed, after being such a hype. A very unpleasant experience.

Located in the neighbourhood of Jodhpur Park, there's been a lot of buzz about the caf√© Blue Mug. I had been looking for a chance to drop by. Finally visited it last week when my friends asked me to meet them over there. We reached the place around 6 p.m. and discovered that there are both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. We decided to opt for the outdoor one so we had to wait for 45 minutes. The caf√© impressed us the very moment we entered it. The beautifully decorated place with kettle lights, or mugs hanging from the ceiling will surely enthuse you too. The outdoor area is decorated with plants, lamps, a swing etc. You might have to wait for longer to get a seat on the swing.

We ordered for Grilled Fish Sizzler, Lamb Chap Sizzler, Chicken Steak, Chocolate Shake, Snickers Shake, Cold Coffee, and Orange Mojito. Trust me the food was so delectable and the bill was only Rs. 1410 for all these items. Each item was reasonably priced and all the prices were inclusive of tax. Even their service was so prompt! Another thing that I liked about the place is their washroom which was clean and well-maintained. Many of the popular restaurants or caf√©s often fail to maintain a clean washroom but Blue Mug surely is an exception. Lots of love and good wishes for the owner(s) and people working here. Cheers to life! Cheers to food!

Pocket pinch: Rs. 700 for 2

Went there on a Sunday evening .. literally had to wait there for more than 30 mins to get a place which ended with getting a table in the outside seating area of the cafe as they failed to give one inside the room (one with the AC) ! Now coming to the food .. its quite cheap with proper portion and they were really delicious . Really enjoyed each and every item we ordered .. service was courteous and the person who was serving us really had a nice gesture ! Would definitely recommend it to people and would like to go back again !

With both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements, the place is very nicely decorated. I liked the outdoor sitting more though. 
Coming to the food, I'd say it was good, however, not extraordinary. But what makes this place a great hangout place is the cheap price of the food and good decor.

My first visit to Blue Mug was satisfactory and I am really glad that this cafe is located at a walking distance of 5 minutes from my place. Luckily we didn't have to wait to get in since I had booked a table through Zomato. 

The ambience and decor is innovative with bulbs inside hanging kettles and pocket pinch is reasonable since they do not charge taxes yet. 

Me and mommy ordered chicken mayo sandwich, fish finger with french fries and coffee. The portions served were really good and the coffee was much better than other places. 

The only thing to complain about was the AC which was hardly cooling the corner we sat in. The outdoor seating is really nice but only for winters.

Went there around 4 pm. The place was jam packed so took the outdoor seating.
The ambience is quiet peaceful. Even the outdoor seating was covered with trees so it's quite comfortable. 
Coming to the food. 
Ordered barbeque chicken pizza and with extra cheese and bacon sandwich. 
Both were amazing. 
No complaints whatsoever. 
It's quite cheap on the pocket as they don't charge taxes.

A cute little cafe right in the middle of Jodhpur Park. Had seen the place on Zomato first and given the rave reviews I wanted to head over there during my visit to the city. It was jam packed and so we had to wait. The first thing you notice is the beautiful decor, with cute kettle lights. They have both outdoor and indoor seating or opt for the one you prefer. We sat outside. They have a large swing, so if you are lucky, you  I can find a spot on it. Sadly we couldn't, since it was jam-packed. We ordered Chicken Salami Pizza, and Mocha Velvet cake. We washed it down with Lemonade and Virgin Mojito. While the service was prompt with the drinks and the pizza, we had to wait for a while for the dessert. The food was good, although I felt that the pizza was a tad too small when compared to other cafes and the price range. The Mocha Velvet cake was yummy! The price is easy on the pocket and hence it's easy to understand why Kolkata is raving about this cute little cafe.

Blue mug is very common name gets to hear from different zoned people. According to the expectation it turned out really well. The decor of the cafe, the ambience and the thing which I loved about it is the corner cafe like in the English street.

Now if I talk about staffs over there then I would love to say that they are very much well mannered, courteous and their behaviour is homely.

The best part of these place is the food. I'm totally in love with the menu card. The food is cheap n much worthier in taste. I would love to visit this place again and again.

After seeing the buzz around this place, I decided to drop by here... The decor of the place reminded me of a quaint English cafe at the corner of the street with an arrangement of outdoor seating. The outdoor seating facility provides a homely decor of a backyard garden, while the indoors have the essence of a cozy, warm beautifully lit ambience...
Now coming to the staff, the staff were courteous but they had no idea about the beverages and the dishes they were serving so we had to repeat the orders a couple of times to explain what kind of beverage we want.. for a place whose name is blue mug, the staff should at least be well versed with the beverage menu and most of the items were not available or even it were available, the staff had no clue about it. However the staff were courteous and prompt while serving the dishes which is a plus point...
We order blue berry shake, Americano, stuffed mushroom, chicken apricot wings, chicken cordon bleu and blueberry mousse...
The blue berry shake was nice but I wished it had more blueberries in it...
The Americano was strong and the aroma of filtered coffee was really prominent. For those who do not like black coffee this is a big No No because it has no sugar and it comes in concentrated form of shots...
The apricot wings were tangy with the right amount of heat... it was lathered in sauce and made for a delicious bite...
Chicken cordon bleu tasted really good... it was cheesy and the chicken was nice and juicy...
The best dish were the garlic cheese stuffed mushroom and I would come back here again and again for this one... the earthiness of the mushroom combined with the gooeyness of the cheese will tingle your tastebuds and the aroma of the herbs and garlic makes this dish a perfect starter...
The blue berry mousse was nice and had loads of delicious blue berries inside it...
All in all this is a budget friendly place and its best for hanging out with your friends over a cuppa...

A very good place. Price is very reasonable. Chicken club sandwich and virgin mohito were superb. But dissatisfied with coconut payesh.
Only defect is LOUD sounds from kitchen mixi . We can't hear ourselves speak above the din of kitchen sounds and the music. My elderly Aunt was in discomfort due to the sound.

We had onion rings, steak, sizzler, sandwiches, the honey mustard chicken, margharita pizza, blue lagoon, lemonade, virgin mojito. The food was relatively cheap but of good quality. Would definitely recommend any one of my friends to visit at least once.

Ok, went on to spend an evening with friends..
Let's talk about the food first.. üòë
The pizza was shit!!
The sizzlers.. well by the looks of it.. kinda Peter Cat wannabe.. the chicken one was fair enough, Don't even bother to try the fish. Fish(fish fry) and chips with more than adequate amount of mayonnaise on offer (loved that part) üòä. I don't know if this means something to someone or not, but the drinking water taste really good.. it's very important for me, maybe coz the food was not upto the mark. The place has a very simple sleek nice Decor with the lights and walls but too many tables.. the service is late and disappointing so don't keep much expectations.. there's a nice place sit and enjoy your coffee and a smoke outside.. the star of the show though is the "Oreo Shake" .. wow!! Wait.. believe it or not, there are mosquitoes under every table in an air conditioned room.. the most off putting thing for me.. maybe they're newly opened, I'm sure they'll get better

This place is tucked away in the lanes of Jodhpur Park.With it's simple and innovative decor the caf√© has grabbed the attention of the youngsters.
Because our generation gives equal attention to decor as to the food.
I really liked the lamps created with colourful kettels.
The way the musical instr have been kept in one corner of the room adds to the charm of the place.

Visited on a summer afternoon so sitting out wasn't an option but would definitely go back for that.
Because the swing in the sitting area is eye catching.

Coming to the food.
We ordered:
BBQ chicken pizza which was quite good.
And,
Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce(was a tad disappointed with the flavour of the sauce)

Service was quick with friendly staff and this place is pocket friendly and a great option for hanging out with friends.
Looking forward to my next visit.

This one I should say is a hidden gem in Kolkata. The food here is very delicious. It was so nice that me and my friends were just kept on ordering until we were totally full. The service is also quite fast and good. It is really hard to find such a pocket friendly place with such delicious food and good ambiance. Only draw back is that in summer it is difficult to sit in the outdoor section that they have so it is hard to get a sit in the inside because the inside area is not so big.

This place is located in Jodhpur park near Jodhpur Boys School. We went there around 5pm and the place was nearly full. As the evening approached more and more people filled the place. Some even stood outside,waiting for their turn. The place is decorated well and has sitting arrangements made both inside and outside. As my friend suggested we ordered Chicken sizzler and Barbeque Chicken pizza.
The sizzler tasted really well. The chicken was well cooked. However the french fries that came along could have been a bit more crispy.
I have real issues with the size of the pizza. The pizza could have been bigger in size given the price of it. The ends of the pizza were somewhat burnt. However, it tasted good.
The food amount should be a bit more given the price.

This cool and cute cafe is located in Jodhpur park. The location is a bit tricky but with the help of google maps we easily found it. We entered the place in the afternoon and it was almost full inside. They have both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements but as it's a sunny summer day we preferred to sit inside the cafe. The decoration is nice with lots of mugs hanging from the ceiling. The soft bengali music played in the background soothed us. Very nice ambiance. The staffs are well mannered and cooperative.
Our today's meal includes,

* Chicken apricot wings
* Chicken steak sizzler
* BBQ Chicken Pizza
* Mango passion twist
* Chocolate shake

So first of all the sizzler was served steamy hot. As long as we tasted it, it seemed to be the best Sizzler till my food journey. The chicken steak was served with grilled vegetables and French fries. It was full of flavors and I liked it a lot. Next coming to the BBQ pizza. It was too good to taste with ample of chicken toppings and a soft crust. Apricot chicken wings also tasted yummy with the sweet and hot tangy flavor. Coming to the drinks, the mocktail mango passion twist tasted good and chocolate shake was also nice.

The foods were served very prompt and it tasted quite delicious. The prices are pocket friendly and inclusive of taxes. Overall this cafe has created a nice impression on us. Visiting again soon.

As the name spells"Blue Mug", my heart is stained with the blue hue of mirth!!! My mom and I decided to check out this buzzing cafe located in jodhpur park n hence on a scorching hot day we fixed our lunch date in this place.As soon as we entered the food joint , we were courteously  greeted by the well behaved staffs !!Initially we were seated in the extended outlet of the cafe, which let me say is  a beautiful arrangement !!! Brightly decorated with flower pots, n overhead lies once again a  blissful blue canopy to protect you from the rustic rays of sun!! One majorly interesting view was the swinging chair  in there which simply transforms your presence in happy hippie land with soul soothing music humming in air!! A lovely area for rejuvenating! At first we ordered fr some blue lagoon.....it was a refreshing glass of icy blue drink with a hint of kiwi slice!! Let me say , the drink was an absolute delight in summer! Not only does it lift up ur mood but at the same time perks up taste buds as well!! The sultry weather did not permit us to sit outside fr long so we shifed in the cafe  now! A marvellous Deƒáor!! Walls beautifully brushed in colours of blue , artistic n captivating pictures of charming Calcutta is a feather to the hat!! A peppy counter fr drinks n shake in the middle n of course a live music station equipped with guitars n keyboard fr the music admirers! The table that we were given was enoughly spacious n well cleaned!! Right frm the ceiling hanged quirky crafted tea kettles as light sources! Bravo!!now the main element of the day!-FOOD!!! LIPSMACKING!!! Is the word!!!!  Chicken club sandwiches were beautifully made , sufficient enough fr a hungry man!! To end up the sweet story was rich soft black forest cake n cuppachino !! Delicious n cozy comfort could be essenced!!! Its a real good ƒáafe in soth Kolkata to unwind yourself n relax with soft lyrics in ambience n efficient n cordial staffs , a happy vibe flowing in as much positivity  as it can!! A must revisit!!!!!
Thank you soo much Prodipto uncle!!
"Bon Appetite"!

A great place for college life adda ... The ambience and service is good. But it's a bit noisy as the coffee and smoothie machines are working just adjacent to the main area. I don't know why they did that. Continuous rumbling of machinery is irritating.
Food is just like from any other good cafe..  nothing special , a lot similarities in menu with places like chaiwala.
Try out the BBQ chicken burger and apricot chicken wings

We ordered BBQ chicken pizza, Mango Smoothie and Coconut Payesh.
Pizza crust was soggy, didn't seem like it was freshly baked.
In smoothie it hardly had any mango flavouring.
But, Yes coconut payesh was something extra ordinary.

This caf√© mainly attracts college crowd. 
The service is sometimes not prompt but the staff is definitely courteous. 
We ordered fruit sangria, after 8, and lemon iced tea. Then we ordered chicken pizza, Chicken spaghetti, chicken steak, and chicken sizzler steak. Drinks were very exciting except after 8 which was nice.The steaks were nice.
There is a separate sitting area for smokers. However, opt for the closed area during the blazing summers!

Quite popular these days, went 2times in a week.. A cool place to chill with friends.. 
FOOD ORDERED - 2 Chicken Stek Sizzler, 3 Chocolate Shake, 1 Kulfi Shake.. 
FOOD REVIEW - Chicken Sizzler was worth the price.. Loved the kulfi shake more than chocolate shake, dnt get me wrong chocolate shake was equally good.. One thing i should say foods here are worth the price.. I remember in my first visit i took chicken sandwich and it was awesome.. Btw its my 2nd visit's review.. 
FINAL VERDICT - Every food is worth the price for sure.. 
SHOULD I VISIT AGAIN? Yes for sure..

Was hearing a lot about this place since it opened at jodhpur park. Finally visited this last week. The quirky bright decor welcomes you happily and there is both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangement. There is a small piano and guitar along with a microphone on one side. I'm not sure if they host karaoke but it surely adds to the charm of the place. 
The staff were well aware about the dishes and happy to assist. We ordered : 

1. Mocktails : Virgin mojito and Lemon fizz. Both were little too high on the soda content and we had to ask them for extra sugar syrup. Though they claimed to add it, the taste didn't change much afterwards. However the drinks did soothe us in the sultry heat.

2. Cheesy fish fry : It was a crunchy fry with cheese layer in between. The piece was big and it was crispy and tasty. It was served with fries and a dip.

3. Chicken nachos : This was slightly disappointing. Instead of using plain nachos, they used flavoured ones. Hence the strong taste of the nachos itself dismissed the flavour of the dressing. Could have been better.

When we chose this cafe as our quarterly meet, we expected a nice cozy place offering splendid food to appease gastronomes like our gang. The d√©cor was okayish, with homely decor and a guitar at our expense. Waiters were friendly too. But the biggest boo came in the form of the steaks and sizzlers. The meat was rock hard and felt like leather inside our mouths. The cafe should stick to regular burgers and sandwiches and quit trying to be a jazzy food hole which it promises. Maybe the meat which they served was frozen. But how can they explain the extreme diarrhoea which most of us faced post a couple of hours? This is totally unacceptable. The saving grace were the pastries which I am pretty sure the cafe chefs have nothing to do with. Won't recommend to anyone who isn't an enemy ;-)

This quaint little pretty cafe has been in my must-visit list for a long time now since it has been talked about a lot since its inception.
And also the pictures of the food and quirky decor that others posted invoked an interest.

And I surely was not disappointed. This place is located in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park and is a great place to hang out since the ambiance is great with light music playing and most importantly,because it is super affordable.
There is seating arrangement both inside and outside as well. As one would expect, on a very hot Saturday afternoon this place was packed up inside. So we were offered a table outside. Initially disappointed because of the heat. The seating arrangement outside is so beautiful that it more than made up for the heat. Though we were shifted inside later on when a table was available.
For starters we ordered Apricot chicken wings and Chicken Spaghetti Pasta in white sauce.
The Apricot chicken wings were very well cooked in a tangy sauce. The spaghetti pasta was a delight. Very creamy and cheesy.
We ordered Blue Lagoon,Fruit Sangria and Virgin Mojito to wash all the food down. Did not like the mojito much. Blue lagoon was good. Special shout out goes out to the Fruit Sangria which is just the drink you're looking for in summer. Extremely refreshing.
For main course we ordered Chicken steak Sizzler and Lamb chap sizzler.
While the chicken steak sizzler,served with sauteed vegetables and french fries,was extremely juicy and tender and very well cooked with the sauce,the lamb chap sizzler was not up to the mark. Though tasty, the lamb was not tender at all.
We went for desserts because there was this particular dessert we had heard about a lot and could not resist the temptation. The chocolate cone. This was happiness on a plate. Though if you're full one chocolate cone can be too much for one person. Since it is laden with cake and cream stuffed inside a thick cone crust made up of chocolate. But this is a must try.
What made us even more surprised. That after having a decent satisfying full course meal all we had to pay was 1515. Just imagine!!!!
Special mention: The staff is really nice and polite. While shifting inside our plates were mistakenly disposed with uneaten pieces of chicken wings in it. Though we did not make a big deal out of it. The staff gave us a complimentary Black Forest cake. Such gestures make you want to visit a place again.

All in all. This new cafe is definitely here to stay!!!!

Suddenly there's a lot of talk in the town about this cafe. So one fine evening we went to check it out.
Location : It's very easy to locate. Waking distance from south city shopping mall.
Ambiance: Well, it's a dining room converted into a cafe. They have indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Colourful decorations can instantly cheer up the mood along with soothing music. They also have lots of books.
Food: we ordered BLUE LAGOON, PRAWN VEGETABLES & BBQ CHICKEN BURGER at first and later PRAWN SALAD & BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA.
Burger was excellent at this price. Pizza was above average. Prawn salad and vegetables were standard and blue lagoon was okeyish.
Service: service is a bit poor. Have to wait a long time for burger and pizza.
Overall excellent place for adda with mouth watering food at reasonable price. 

REVIEW UPDATE 27.05.17

Went there again. This time ordered Mixed SeaFood Sizzler, Chicken Burger, Choco Cone and Pink Panther. Mixed seafood sizzler was amazing.

It was on the occasion of my cousin's (belated) birthday treat that we decided to check out a new and hip place instead of his usual fine dining choices. So, he suggested this place. Situated in Jodhpur park, a five minutes walk from SASK hospital, this place is a cozy, urban cafe with quirky interiors. It also has an outdoor seating section, but since it was EXTREMELY hot outside, and we have been waiting for a table fors around 15 minutes, we chose to relax at the indoor section. Talking about the service first, I think it was a bit slow. Well, that can be accepted given the fact that it was a busy Saturday evening. But we had to wait for a good 7 minutes before we were provided with the menu cards.
Now, the things that we ordered:
Crispy Fried Prawns as appetizers, a Blue Lagoon mocktail, an Oreo Shake, and for the main course- Lamb Chap Sizzler and Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce. The Blue Lagoon was okay-ish. I thought that the Oreo Shake would have been amazing, given that Zomato suggests this one. It tasted more like a regular chocolate shake with a swirl of cream, chocolate sauce and crushed Oreos. I have had better Oreo Shakes before, so this was not up to my expectation. The Fried Prawns were good- deep fried, perfectly spiced with a slight tint of tanginess. The complimentary sauce was good, too. Talking about the Lamb Chap Sizzler, initially my brother was a bit skeptical about this one. He didn't want to have some mince meat so he confirmed the same from the one who was serving us. He said that it was a solid steak price of lamb. The Lamb Chap was tender enough, grilled with the usual barbeque sauce. I took the Grilled Fish which was rather a disappointment. I expected two pieces of grilled fish (as it is usually served in most of the places.), Instead got only one. It was served with a portion of herbed rice, boiled veggies and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes weren't blended well; it had solid chunks of potatoes and was quite bland. The boiled veggies were somewhat undercooked. The herbed rice was just fine. Now, the fish was also okay-ish, which felt like more shallow fried than grilled. The only star in the plate was the little helping of lemon butter sauce which added a good song of flavour to the otherwise bland dish. We finished our meal off with a Chocolate Cone. This is something new that I came across- a solid chocolate cone filled with chocolate mousse and a little bit of brownie (?) and sprinkled with chocolate rice at the opening. The cone was really hard; we had a good time breaking and eating it up.

P.S.: while me and my brother were talking, the man who brought our main course hurriedly tried to clean up our previous plates. In that hurry, he accidentally picked up my unfinished jar of Oreo Shake to clear it off the table! He even had dumped a waste tissue into the jar! I had to stop him from taking it away, but finished the rest of the shake quite reluctantly. -_-

Ambience: 4/5
Staff: 3/5
Food: 3/5
Pocket Pinch: ‚Çπ1000 for two.

I would think twice before coming back to this place and even if I do, I would choose a rather less busy day, like a week day.

Blue Mug has been a popular hangout spot among the youth of Kolkata in recent times. A lot of my friends also recommended this place to me. This new, well decorated cafe is located near Jodhpur park in the lane opposite Allahabad Bank. It is there on google maps so finding it is not a problem!

The first thing we ordered were mocktails : Fruit sangria and Mojito. The mojito was fine...nothing special. The fruit sangria was great! It tangy and sweet with mixed fruits. The presentation was also eye catching. Next we ordered the Bbq chixken pizza....it was extremely cheesy and delicious! 1 star less due to slow service. All the prices listed on the menu are inclusive of taxes! So it is very pocket friendly! ¬†Gonna visit again soon .

I think we should mark it -1. Terrible experience. Tables are dirty. Washroom was dirty. Dustbins and trash visible even at guest sights. Waitstaff is below standard. The airconditioning does not work. Water tumblers were dirty. Waiters are so busy chit chatting that they forget orders. I unfortunately landed up in this place. It is a " never ever go " tag for me.

This place is a newly opened cafe in Jodhpur park. The place is really nice and comfy. With indoor and outdoor seating, this place is a new hit. 
The staff are nice but as it is really crowded during the weekends the service is a bit slow. I went with some of my friends this weekend. We ordered the bbq chicken burger, margherita pizza, chicken steak and chocolate cone. 
Well the burger was nice with a side of chips, but we got the chicken steak burger instead of what we ordered. The steak was not something I enjoyed a lot. Pizza was nice with a good amount of cheese. Loved the chocolate cone. 
Overall this place is amazing and would love to visit again soon. And whoever still haven't been there just give it a try.

A cool and cozy cafe with pleasant ambience and nice-looking decor.
We had ordered:-
1. Chicken Barbque Pizza
2. Nachos Salsa
3. Caesar Salad
4. Chicken Club Sandwich
5. Barbque Chicken Burger
6. Oreo Shake
7. Virgin Mojito
8. Chicken Steak
9. Mango Smoothie
Trust me, we got all these food items for just Rs. 1300!
Yes, this place is pocket friendly and the quality of food is also good.
The oreo shake was too sweet and not what I had expected it to be but it is presented beautifully.
The burger was okayish and bit dry.
Try out their mango smoothie. It's a perfect summer chiller and also their Virgin Mojito.
In Chicken Steak the chicken was tender and juicy.

Overall it was a good and filling experience out there at Blue Mug.

Located near the bylanes of jodhpur Park.. Few mins walking distance from abar baithak or netaji sweets.
Nearby South City Mall as well as few mins walking distance from the Lane beside leather land shop.

Small newly opened cafe with both outdoor and indoor sitting arrangements. Crowdy during the evening time... might wait for sometime outside.

Well decorated. Pocket pinch is moderate here... They 've updated the price of the burgers whatever I' ve seen here in Zomato.

Good to go with friends.
Service isn't prompt so they must work on it. Staffs are quite cooperative though if someone is asking for something from them.

I went with 3 of my friends... We took chicken burgers and chicken drumsticks.

Burgers are Highly Recommendable here.

Chicken drumsticks were well cooked but pepper with every bite isn't a good thing to taste... at least for me.

Otherwise it's ok.

This caf√© is definitely the talk of the town now. Blue Mug is located on a lane in Jodhpur park near abar baithak. Just follow the map and you can easily reach here. 
Me and my friend went to this caf√© finally. We went during the evening and it was packed. We had to wait for sometime to grab our seats. 
It has both outdoor and indoor seating areas. The interior is very pretty and well decorated with stuffs. We preferred to seat inside only.  
The staffs were well behaved and serving time was good. 
Now coming to the food... We ordered:
Chicken club sandwich- it was good... The cheese, mayo, chicken, cucumber, lettuce and tomato made it complete. It was served with wafers and ketchup. 
Chipotle BBQ chicken wings sizzler- it tasted amazing... The chicken wings was well cooked and the flavour of the sauce was absolute yum. It was served with French fries.
Brownie- tasted good... 
I'm very much satisfied... Definitely coming back to try out the other dishes.. :)

When my friends and I reached the place, the lights were out and we had to sit outside. We were okay with all this until we had to order. No matter what we tried to order, be it pizza, nachos, sandwich or a shake, they said they couldn't serve us anything because there was no electricity. There was not more than hardly 5 items in the menu that they could serve. We being well behaved consumers didn't walk out and decided to order from the overtly few options. We ordered a veg white sauce pasta which was okay, nothing great; a chicken steak which was extremely salty, virgin mojito and blue lagoon were decent. They really need to plan out on their back up if there's no electricity or at least tell people before they enter that they can't serve 80% of the things written in the menu without electricity.

We couldn't find a table in the air conditioned section as we visited the place on a Saturday evening.But to our surprise,even in the sultry evening we really enjoyed our meal in the open air setting.There is also a swing with one table in the corner.They have really done well with such a small place as far as the ambience is concerned.We ordered a bacon sandwich which was lip smacking.The fish fingers were decent.But the real winners were the mango smoothie and the After 8 shake.The best part about Blue Mug besides the food is the staff.They are really courteous and the service is great.It was a pleasant experience and I am surely looking forward to visiting the place again.

Sitting inside the cafe right now and writing this review, while the bill comes....
Well, for starters we asked for the bill around 15ins back...
Had ordered a Snickers Shake, a Cappuccino and a Bacon Sandwich. 
The 2 rating is because of the Bacon Sandwich, nothing extraordinary, but palatable, and kinda okay for 140 bucks. 
The Snickers shake was a complete disaster. 180 bucls wasted on watery chocolate milk. Just adding whipped cream and chocolate sauce doesn't make a shake. No taste of snickers at all. Pictures attached to see lumps of whipped cream in the jar.
The cappuccino, according to my mother, who usually loves this, was just foam. 
NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN
I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE GOING GAGA OVER THIS PLACE

Blue Mug had been in my wishlist for long and once I dropped in, I couldn't stop going back!

Indoor seating can be an issue sometimes because this place mostly remains full. And outdoor seating is a problem for non-smokers because most people sitting outside are actually there constantly smoking.
This is from my experience of three times in this place.
Staffs are courteous but service is very very slow.
So we tried these following items :
‚Ä¢ Fungi Pizza - The first time I had their Fungi Pizza, I instantly fell in love. Wood fired pizza with a perfect base and I think it was the best Fungi Pizza I've ever had. The second and third times' Fungi was not like the previous day's, although they were still delicious. I found the base sauce was a little sweet on both the times. But I never got back the first day's taste.
‚Ä¢ BBQ Chicken Pizza - It was okayish.
‚Ä¢ Chicken Burger - Buns were fresh. Generous amount of ingredients. Impressive enough.
‚Ä¢ French Fries - At ‚Çπ50, no place would serve the amount of french fries Blue Mug does. However, their quality could be improved.
‚Ä¢ Stroganoff (non-veg) - Served with Herb Rice and salad. Loved it!
‚Ä¢ Blue Lagoon - Not a big fan of Blue Lagoons yet it was refreshing.
‚Ä¢ Choco Drum - The chocolate shell was good but the inside stuff was not upto the mark.

Too pocket friendly for a cafe serving such delicious food. Cost for two is hardly ‚Çπ400 which can include two dishes, one drink, one dessert.
Always coming back!

UPSATE: Due to my recent last experience I have rated it so low. I had to send back a dish twice and they still couldn't make it right. The vegetables were not properly cooked. The Veg Stroganoff was a disaster!

I know it's too small and with the ever increasing footfall, waiting can be an issue. But trust me it's worth the wait. Smokers, non smokers old and young veg or non veg this is the place to go. Had crispy fried prawns, barbeque chicken pizza, sea food sizzler fish and chips green apple mojito, blueberry mousse , strawberry mousse. i must say am thoroughly thoroughly impressed

This pretty little corner cafe is closely located to Abar baithak, another popular cafe. Being a student, I remain broke most of the times and that's precisely what pulled me towards this place. Their reasonable rates are probably their biggest advantage, apart from the taste, which brings me to the food. I've been here a couple of times and have tried various items. On an average, the quality of food is amazing, and you rarely get such good food for such prices. My recommendations would be fish finger(the best I've had in town) and bbq chicken pizza...or anything else on the menu because everything is lip-smackking. Coming to the beverages, I've tried Arabica Organic yk cappuccino, Irish cold coffee and passionfruit black tea. All of them pleased me to my delight. However, I have been highly disappointed here. Being a coffee lover, I wanted to try out the various kinds on the menu, but sadly most of them were unavailable not once but everytime I've been there. Similarly, with the pizza, which I've ordered twice, they didn't have the 12" base. Apart from this, the service, if a little more attentive would be appreciated much.
All in all, the cozy environment and the delicious food makes it a perfect adda place to go to. Oh, and the outdoor seating (though you'd have to fight for a seat) is absolutely adorable. Kudos!

Located in the quiet and posh locality of Jodhpur park this cafe can definitely be a hot favourite with students and office goers alike due to its price and variety in menu. 

The inside decor contains some 6-7 table with bright kettle shaped lamps,white walls and dark blue ceiling. Long story short ,you'll like the design. There is also arrangements for outside seating with few tables and a laid back swing. 
Since we went in the hot month of April we choose the inside seating but during the cooler seasons the outside tables will definitely be a preference.

We ordered bbq chicken pizza, chicken club sandwich,Oreo shake and chocolate shake. Pizza was not thin crust and the sides of it were over baked which gave a crunchy feeling. The toppings were given abundantly. The sandwich was good with a layers of mayo,chicken,egg,and veggies. Quite good for light breakfast. 

What disappointed me was the Oreo and chocolate shakes. They were too sweet with no variation of taste ; it's only sweet . It killed our appetite in just few gulps. 

The prices were moderate but the shakes were definitely over priced, considering the quality .

We had their APRICOT CHICKEN WINGS , CRISPY FRIED PRAWNS , CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD , HONEY MUSTARD CHICKEN and a MANGO PASTRY , apart from the dessert which had a synthetic mango compote , rest of the food was simply great , special recommendation to the crispy prawns , the best dish for sure.

This has become the city's budding food joint. I'll call it a perfect place for some chit chat and munching food. The apricot chicken wings is a new concept and a fresh introduction for chicken lovers. It's a must have if you visit here. The mango shake I had taken was very tasty and served with some crushed cornflakes on top. Again an innovative touch. The veg sandwich was very fresh consisting of fresh tomatoes, onions, cucumber, lettuce and a slice of cheese. No added taxes which makes everything all the more attractive. Overall thumbs up to this lovely place.üëç

If you are looking for a place where you can chill with your friends, then you should definitely visit this place. It is not a very big place. It is rather small but the ambience and the decor will definitely please your eyes. You get to choose whether you want to sit indoors or outdoors. The food quality was excellent. I went with my friends and ordered chicken sizzler, Mexican fries, Apricot chicken wings and virgin mojito. Each of these items tasted good. The staff were also well-mannered. My only complain is that they took a lot of time to bring the food. Even a simple mojito took some time. Other than that, I think this is a place for all youngsters and one should visit it for sure.

This place is an absolute delight! The interiors, the open space full of greens, the wall installations and graffites all around adds to the aesthetic sensibility of the place. The food is so so delicious and filling. Beautifully plated and served. Staffs are helpful and well behaved. And of course the pricing of all the items are so very pocket friendly.
Just to give an idea, we ordered one Darjeeling first flush tea, one masala chai, one chicken club sandwich and one Mexican french fries. The bill amounted to Rs. 285 only. No service tax. The food portions  were more than enough for two people. Very very satisfying both taste and price wise. All in all we had a lovely evening hi-tea time! 
A definite recommendation to all !

Blue Mug - Quite a pocket friendly cafe.
=====
Location + Intro:

Blue Mug is located in one of the bylanes of Jodhpur Park Area. I had been here with one of my friend to try the food items. I had been hearing about it a lot and hence, went on trying it.

Blue Mug is a great cafe with minimalistic decor and there are kettles hanging from the ceiling which are used for lighting purpose. There is wall art at the background and the way the glasses are hung upside down is another show to look at. Nevertheless, as the name suggests, there is a color blue in the place. As you sit down, the courteous staff comes and hands over the big a la carte where the prices of the items seems to mesmerize the mood with joy.¬†
=====
What i ordered:¬†

‚Ä¢ Vanilla Black Tea Half - It was good to taste.¬†

‚Ä¢ Masala Chai Half - Masala Chai was better than the Vanilla Black tea. #musttry.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Lollipop (6 Pcs) - I loved it. They were juicy and lipsmacking hot. The chicken was tender. ¬†#musttry

‚Ä¢ Chicken Burger - The chicken burger was nice. It had a juicy patty inside and tasted really good. #musttry

‚Ä¢ Barbq Chicken Pizza - The barbq chicken pizza's dough was a bit thick. However, the taste was not compromised at all. I totally loved it. The chicken was tender and the cheese melting in the mouth along with it takes you to the food fantasy world. Nevertheless, i loved on this one as well. #musttry
======
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Great to taste.
‚Ä¢ Pocket Friendly affair.
‚Ä¢ Courteous Staffs.
‚Ä¢ Serving speed is fast.
=====
Meal for two: 300-600 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc)
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 4.5/5
Food Quantity 4.7/5
Taste 4.5/5
Presentation 4.6/5
Hospitality 4.5/5
Ambiance 4.7/5
VFM 4.5/5
=====
Conclusion: I really had a good time here. All the dishes which i had here just costed me total 500 bucks which i think is quite cheap. Nevertheless, i will surely revisit it again.

This place is an absolute gem. Done up delightfully in blue and with a comfy outdoor seating area, my best friend and I loved it from the start. The menu did not disappoint. It has French press coffee - my favourite way to have coffee! And at a ridiculously low price! I ordered that, and she ordered a lovely passionfruit tea. For eats we took the spaghetti in creamy pesto sauce with chicken and the BBQ chicken burger. Both were ample in portion size and delicious to taste - the spaghetti sauce could have done with a hint more pesto flavour, but hey, it tasted great all the same! And the total bill was 415 rupees. If that's not fabulous value for money I don't know what is! I will say that the service could be improved a wee bit, as I had to call a server twice or thrice before he brought me some milk, but that's a minor niggle. Special bonus for the lovely blue mug I got for my coffee.
Simply can't wait to come back! :)

I had no idea about the existence of this place before one of my friends actually forced me to come here with her and I cannot really thank her enough for it.
I loved the decor and the humble approach of the people in the cafe.
We ordered 2 different kinds of sizzlers and were impressed by both. We also took hash browns for a potato-lover friend which were equally good.
Coming to the beverages, the oreo shake was Amazing with an upper-case A.
Finally, I ordered the coconut payesh which i am still not being able to forget. This one is a must try and please do go early because they run out of stock, i was lucky enought to have been able to claim the last one that evening.
Also, you may have to wait for sometime outside to get a table but, trust me it's worth it. :'D

Visited this place with my friend 2 days back and I can say that we both loved it! The Mexican French Fries were amazing and so was the Chocolate Shake. The BBQ chicken pizza was filled with cheese and tasted great too. It is quite pocket friendly. The ambience and deƒáor is nice and I am looking forward to visiting this place again and try out the other dishes.  
The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of the service. The behaviour of the staff is good but they are a bit late. If they improve this, it is a really good place to spend time with family & friends.

Today I visited the much talked about cafe. Blue mug. My one liner for this cafe would be beutiful. Simply beautiful.
Location: Jodhpur park. Near nava nalanda school.
Decor: I loved it. Cozy. The outside sitting area is also well decorated. Just because its summer, i would really liked to sit there.
Food: So i ordered mixed seafood sizzler and in drinks pink panther and virgin mojito. The sizzler resembled a kabab dish served with veggies, french fries and lemon butter sauce. It had prawn, fish and crab. I loved it . Pink panther tasted like strawberry shake with a mint flavour. But beautifully presented. I have added the pics. Virgin mojito as usual.
Food and drinks tasted great.
Overall cozy place with tasty food.
Nice place to hang around.
Adding pics from my another visit

This place remains so crowded in the evening. Once went and came back since there was no seat available indoors.. There is also sitting arrangement outside the cafe with a swing.. Anyway went there with nearbuy coupons and had a chicken burger, chicken cheese sandwich and cappuccino. The service is not good. Though we were served the burger and sandwich quick enough, we had to wait for the coffee for a further 30mins after we were done with our food. The chicken burger and sandwich were good but could be better. But the cappuccino was served cold and one of the cups had only froth and nothing else. Disappointed.

Blue mug is definitely a joint that brings together the quirkiness of a coffee shop and frills of fine dining space. Though evenings run busy, indoor and outdoor seatings can be well chosen over the day. You can select over a wide range of food and refreshing beverages (some musical strums as well)!!

The All Day Breakfast comes handy, specially for quick work breaks. Adding a few more healthy alternatives in the breakfast platter would be great! 

Portions, and presentation of food are good, flavours are authentic. Meanwhile the white dinewares add to the visual delight. Pricing is smart, flexible (in terms of portions) and doesn't burn a hole in the pocket. #BlueMug is a place to sit out, relax and set the clock a little slow...good ambience and the right company never fails!!

Went to this place yesterday with a friend . We took the long route so we had to hop from one lane to the other . Finally we reached , then the story happened to be all heavenly . From the decor, to food , to service excellent . For a long time it had been there in my food bucket list , the meat lover I m each time I opened Zomato I kept drooling the sizzlers photo . Obviously I ordered chicken steak sizzler , prawn Mediterranean salad , honey mustard‚Äã chicken with herb rice , virgin mojito and blue lagoon . All were amazing except the honey mustard  chicken , the chicken was not that soft . We were eating and enjoying all our favourite music 'adda jome khir' , just then a waiter comes and says there will be no electricity for 1 hr or so . It was totally not their fault we wanted to stay a bit longer though but we had to leave . Now that I know this hidden jem whenever I m in Ju for my classes do expect my visit üòäüòäüòä

Wonderful ambiance. Exceptional quality of Food. One of the best cafe, I have ever visited. Really disappointed to find out some people are intentionally making some mess out of it. May be they are inspired from some surrounding cafes. Never the less, amidst all the criticisms in social media in resent days, just a single review from me " Blue Mug reigns supreme."

Tucked away in the bylanes of Jodhpur park it is a small well decorated place serving an assortment of beverages and dishes. It also hosts a small area of outdoor seating space which also is the designated smoking zone. Pretty much like an average cafe which sees a good amount of footfall. It was pretty crowded given it was a weekday evening. 

The outdoor seating area is crammed for space and the low tables along with mismatched chairs made us struggle for leg space and made it highly uncomfortable to enjoy the food. Even requesting the servers to switch table didn't help much until we reminded them. 

The food is pretty decent but fails to impress. We settled for a cold coffee,  Mediterranean Prawn Salad,  Chicken Club Sandwich and finished it off with Coconut Dessert. The Prawn salad was extremely disappointing as it lacked dressing and was stashed with lettuce. The cherry tomatoes and the prawns were extremely hard to find in it overall lacked flavor.  The chicken club sandwich was decent however dry filling less edges made it go off. Finally the coconut dessert came in which also failed to impress and tasted weird.  The only plus side is the price which is pretty moderate. 

Overall not a very good experience. They have immense scope to improve in terms of service as well as food.

Heard a great deal about this place. It was my first time here and we loved it! We had French Fries, Chicken Club Sandwich (which is a winner and so good that we didn't bother to click a picture), and the Chipotle BBQ Wings. Well, to begin with they give fairly large quantities considering the price. Also to mention the good quality of the food. Didn't really like the wings as they were really spicy and so it was a big no-no for me.
Coming to the drinks, I had a Fruit Sangria, and my friends had a Pink Panther and an Oreo Shake. Now let me mention one thing. If you have a sweet tooth and if you love fruits, this Sangria is just about right for you. It's beautiful and amazing and everything good.
We also had been eyeing the dessert section for a long time until we decided to give it a try. We had the Marvel cake, Blueberry cake, Chocolate cone, and the Brownie. The Blueberry is a good try and all the others were as delicious as they looked.

Extremely over-hyped. Been here twice now, and although the first experience was decent, the second was really bad. The staff was extremely cold and indifferent and there was hair in one of the cups of tea we ordered. On showing them this, they didn't seem bothered at all and even went onto implying it might've been ours. The food otherwise is nothing extraordinary, and they attract people mostly because of the location and pricing.

Visited this cafe today which is very close to my house and was in my bucketlist for a long time now.. Blue Mug is a 5 min walk from jodhpur park bus stop and is not atall difficult to locate. The place looks beautiful from outside. The thing which i loved about this cafe was its outdoor seating. Like other cafes, whose outdoor seating arrangement is absolutely in the open giving no privacy atall, the outdoor seating of this cafe is beautifully surrounded by trees and plants giving the place a soothing environment and also some privacy..
Well, now coming to the food. We ordered
1) SNICKERS SHAKE
2) OREO SHAKE AND
3) BBQ PIZZA(8")
Well, the shakes were nothing extraordinary.. Just like regular chocolate drinks. I couldnt even differentiate between both the shakes as they tasted quite similar.. Only the oreo one had oreo chucks in it and the snickers had pieces of snickers. ( As the name says)
Now coming to the pizza. I really loved the pizza, which was very different from the pizzas we r served at dominos.. Only the base was way to crispy and as we ordered bbq CHICKEN we expected some more chicken pieces..
The place was not crowded when we visited there and the staffs are also ok. Nothing over the top..
Would recommend this cafe and i am surely visiting this cafe again..

The manager or whoever that guy is in glasses is very mean and shrewd. My friends and i stopped going there because of him. Good food can easily be countered by bad behaviour. If the manager leaves I will start going there again. He is horrible for someone who is in the hospitality business. This is just disappointing from a place as good as this.

Went here for an evening date today.
Had to wait for quite some time as the place was packed. We got an outdoor seat.
The ambience was quite nice.
My partner and I ordered a virgin mojito, an Oreo shake, a plate of onion rings and a plate of crunchy, garlic-filled mushroom. The bill came to Rs.440.
The mojito was super refreshing.
The Oreo shake was thick and chocolatey.
The onion rings were a perfect blend of soft inside and crunchy outside (though a tad bit oily)
The mushrooms had a strong aroma of cheese and a beautiful crunch.
Overall, quite satisfied. Will be back for the mojito and also plan to have the pizza next time.

Went there last sunday and gathered the following experience 
Location - 5 mins walking distance from jodpur park bus stop,  near to abar baithak 
Ambience - the place is divided in two areas,  the ac zone and the balcony.  The decoration in the ac zone is quite impressive with lights hanging in the shape of kettles. The balcony is decorated with lots of tress,  some normal sitting arrangements and a swing which adds to the beauty of the place.  We sat in the balcony. 
Foods ordered:
Oreo shake- not very impressive..  Tasted like milk with complan. Had a oreo biscuit in it. 
A Pinacolada- good,  tangy bt  very less in quantity
Fried chicken wings- too good..  It was spicy,  smoky and had all the flavours that made me go ga-ga over it. 
Chicken burger- it was googled‚Äã,  full of Chicken and other stuffs served with wafer. 
Pocket pinch- moderate,  taxes are included in the menu. 
Will definitely revisit and try their other drinks as i was impressed with their food but not with their drinks.

Decor is good.

Food prices are decent.

Quality of food/taste is very mediocre. Wouldn't recommend for food, although the quantity is enough to fill you.
Pizza was like the buffed up cousin of the ones you'd get at Bake Club or Mio Amore. It's too Indian and overuse of tomato, ketchup and lack of roasted veggies are major putoffs.
Desserts are good.

Service is prompt.

Go there if you want to fill your tummy and like to spend time with friends. Don't go if you actually like food.

Located near reliance fresh, very close to abar baithak , this is the new hype of kolkata ! The cafe is beautiful with subtle decoration. Since poila boishakh we had to wait in the queue though not for long and got ourselves comfortable in the outer sitting area . The sitting arrangement was done with perfection and the ambience was amazing. Anyday if it's not too hot I would prefer outdoor sitting area. There is a swing as well ! Now coming to food we ordered apricot chicken wings, non veg penne pasta in white sauce , pinnacolada and pink panther ! The drinks were soothing , I especially loved the flavour of pinnacolada ! Pink panther was refreshing as well. The pasta was served with 2pcs of garlic bread loaded with generous amount of cheese and chicken chunks adding great flavour ! But definitely the apricot chicken wings stole the show which compelled us to order one more ! The service was excellent even on such a busy day and we were offered two bowls of payesh based on the special offer which was liked by both of us. The best part is the prices are inclusive of tax and the joint is pretty cheap ! Had heard a lot about their chicken steak , definitely planning my next trip there ! :D

We ordered the following items using a nearbuy voucher for 4 course meal for two:
Prawn Mediterranean salad: the prawns were so nicely smoked and tasted heavenly. The dressing was average and so were the veggies. Liked the cherry tomatoes.
Apricot chicken wings: Needless to say, well smoked and nice saucy flavour.
Honey mustard chicken with rice and fries: the chicken steak with the sauce is delicious and worth a try. The rice had a nice seasoning.
Oreo shake: moderately good.
Coconut payesh: this dish won my heart.. it's a very creative dessert and so was the way they served it.

We also ordered a mushroom starter, it had paneer and cheese stuffed mushroom balls served with a Garlic mayonnaise. Any mushroom lover should try this.
Ambience: creative and the outdoor sitting is innovative and nice for evenings.  For summer afternoon indoors is preferable.
Service: scope for improvement.
Very Pocket friendly.
We visited this cafe today and on the occasion of Nobo Borsho they served complimentary payesh, about which firstly I felt was a very good gesture on the part of a continental cafe and secondly the payesh was delicious.
It's a must try cafe.

This place is certainly a hidden gem in jodhpur park. After my examination got over my friends and i went to blue mug to have food and for celebration also. The place is beautifully decorated with blue kettles and other decorative items keep it at par with the name of the cafe. When we got there it was full inside so we sat outside but later they managed to give us a seat inside. The staff were courteous. Coming to the food we ordered one oreo shake,blue lagoon,thumbs up, spaghetti pasta and bbq chicken pizza.

Oreo shake- it was good not doubt but somehow my friend and i both felt that there was taste of peanut/peanut butter which dominated the flavour of oreo shake but nevertheless it was quite good.

Blue lagoon- i liked their blue lagoon their it lacked that refreshment which blue lagoon had. But overall was really really good.

Spaghetti pasta- this was indeed quite delicious. It was served with 1pcs garlic bread. We chose arrabiata sauce so it was spicy and the pasta was cooked to perfection. Added peppercons did wonder.

Bbq Chicken pizza- one word "incredible". If you see the picture which i am attaching to it, we will get to know how much cheesy it is. We all loved it. Yummy and delicious. Definately a superhit.

By the end we were so full that we couldnt have any dessert but i will be going back to have their other items and desserts to.

Saturday evening outing with my fianc√© and her sister. To this wonderful outlet.

We already booked our table and specified that we will be seating outside in that swing area. Particularly we asked for that swing.

The outlet is small but wonderfully decorated inside out.

After visiting the place we were asked to wait for a few minutes while we already booked our table a day before and we were on time. What made us mad is that when we asked for that swing they said its unavailable but we already mentioned it we needed that. We were neither guided by zomato nor by the Cafe people that we cannot sit there if we don't bring a large group. Although after a few minutes of request they allowed us to sit.

We were seated then again we had to wait for the waiters to arrive to bring the menu card itself. I felt we were being neglected.

Menu Card had a lot of option but we decided to play safe.
We ordered
Chicken Steak
Fish and Lemon Butter sauce

Mocktails
Virgin Mojito
Orange Mojito
Sweet Lime Soda

Chicken Steak was the best thing I ever had with sauted veggies. Extremely well cooked and served beautifully. The right amount of butterrd rice along with it made my anger go away.

Fish with Lemon butter sauce was well cooked too which I didn't had. But according to Sneha it was magnificent.

The mocktails were well made too and were served in jar typed bottles I don't know what they call it but was nicely done to cool my mind.

The food and the ambience of this place is mind blowing.

Note: While booking your table please mention clearly what exact service you want from them. Example where you want to be seated insude the cafe or in the lawn. How many of youvare going etc.

Zomato and Blue Mug Cafe people please contact the person who is booking the table clear out the doubts.
Secondly, please pick up the phone.

Thank you.

P.S. Happy Eating.

So again we went there yesterday. Wad to wait for another 20 minutes or so as this place has become very popular and crowdy even on weekdays. We got to sit outside as it was full on in the inside. And in this summer heat I wasn't liking it. But it was getting late for my friend to get home if we had seated inside the Cafe we had to wait for an hour or so. Anyways, we got ourselves seated and they served us real quick with water. Then they took our order.

Orange Blossom
Oreo Shake
Lemonade
Chicken Steak Sizzler
Grilled Fish Sizzler

The service is as usual very slow and it takes a lot of time to prepare the dishes and serve it on the table.

But the food was mind-blowing.

They serve great food at cheao rates and this is making this place a popular spot for all age groups.

Ladt time I rated it 3.5 and now it will be 4 because of the food they serve.

Amazing place in Jodhpur Park area. It is like a hidden heaven. Beautiful decor, soothing ambience, very friendly and cordial staff members and awesome food! Also, a guitar and a piano simulator is present at the cafe, which, anyone can play.
Blue mug is one of the cleanest places I have seen. The interior of the shop is just beautiful. The outdoor sitting area also provides some customers the pleasure of smoking and having their food and beverage orders served to them. Amazing place.
The 0.5 I deducted from the rating is for the burnt and rock solid patty they served me in my burger the last time I went. They must have not noticed it, otherwise I know for a fact they are good people and would have replaced it instantly. Anyway, great place.. Go with friends, family and loved ones, you will most definitely enjoy your visit!

So another new cafe in Kolkata !
I heard about this cafe from many friends and finally visited yesterday.
The ambience is a complete 10/10.
The interior is just beautiful with the blue kettles hanging from the roof...the guitar...and the place is big as well.
There is an outdoor sitting arrangement too where people can smoke.The outdoor area is the best part of this cafe with a swing,lights etc.This is a perfect place to have a date.

Now coming to the food part.
We ordered a chicken salami pizza which was more or less good.Then we tried the chicken strognoff.
The quantity of rice was not enough for two people to share and it tasted more or less good as well.Apart from these we ordered a blueberry pastry and coconut payesh.
Both of them were simple mouse  which  only had thick  cream with distinctive flavors.
Thus the food is not that good.
But definitely it is pocket friendly.
And the stuffs are very nice too.

Was looking forward to visit this place after seeing their advertisement. The name sounded very interesting to me. It was a weekend and the place was full and we had to wait and thereafter even after getting seat on their request had to share our seat. We were waiting for half n hour when on requesting a lady she took our order. After 10 minutes one guy came and said whatever food we had ordered is not available. Then we had to order fresh which took more than fifteen minutes to come. We ordered their arabica coffee and one pasta. Nothing of great taste. I found the concept to be same of Mocha. The food of Mocha is far better than here. Very disappointed.

A cafe which was desperately needed in this part of the city. There is hardly any good cafe or place to hang out at Jodhpur Park so this was expected big time!!Ambiance is great and the place is quite big and has got seating arrangements out in the open as well. Food quality is excellent and the Prawn Vegetables is delicious to say the least. Seats could have been made a bit more comfortable and cosy. Yet, overall this place is a hit and is definitely here to stay.

The location is near the reliance store. Decor excellent. The outdoor area with the swings and everything adds more to it. Coming to the food. We ordered a fizzy lime mocktail which was pretty good. Fish n chips were okay. Apricot sauce chicken wings- totally smoky and the chicken wings were juicy as well. Well I am personally a cheese lover and hats down to the cheese fondue they made. Absolute bliss. All the cheese lovers should never miss this. Overall a good place to hang out and have nice food which are pocket friendly too.

Food was also gud we order the mango shake Assam tea apricot chicken wings blt sandwich and fish and chips and were not disappointed l. In fact plan to visit again to have the rest of the items in the menu. Only problem was with the pizza which was soggy hence it was not possible to lift if off the plate without it falling apart. Hence the rating oh btw and pricing was also decent

A new place got over hyped
Not much variety in the menu
Attendants are mostly clueless of their job
They have no what they are supposed to do
They take forever to place basic cappechino and sometimes they forget you and your order......Which happened with me
The attendants and the authority can't handle pressure if the place gets crowded
The basic cappechino was less than ordinary
I visited this place twice
I won't recommend this place to anyone else

I've been wanting to visit this place for quite some time, and finally made it there yesterday afternoon. The place is lovely and also has an outdoor seating area. Coming to the food, the chicken steak sizzler was very tasty. The chicken salami pizza was good too. We also ordered a mixed seafood sizzler, which should have ideally been called fish sizzler. It was not quite satisfactory. The chicken cordon bleu was delicious and loaded with cheese! The kulfi shake was ordered with high expectations but was extremely disappointing. It tasted like elaichi in crushed ice.
The overall experience was good enough though. Blue mug is worth a visit.
PS. the food is quite reasonably priced too!

Visited this place a week ago with a few of my best buddies. Started off with kulfi milk,mango smoothie and strawberry smoothie. Though they took a long time to serve the drinks, they were very refreshing. After that, ordered fish with Cheese Fish Fry, Garlic Filled Crispy Mushroom, Chicken Lollipop, Apricot Chicken Wings. This time, the food was served@am quickly. The cheese fish fry is a must for those who want to get a really cheesy experience. When you take a bite, liquid cheese comes out and fills your mouth. As I am not at all a veggie person, so cannot give much review about the mushroom, but it was crispy and tasty. Now coming to the Apricot Chicken wings, I did not get any apricot-y taste. :P The taste was more of a balance between hot & sweet. Last, but the Best, was the Chicken lollipop. This is a must have in this place. Really one of the best chicken lollipops I ever had.
Overall, other than the time for serving drinks, this place is a great combinations of good food and ambience. It is quiet pocket friendly. Outdoor seatings are there with greenery all around(great for good photos :P ).They also serve nice and hot brownies too.

Was looking for this type of place for a long time where you can just go with your friends or loved ones and relax. The open air outdoor area is what attracted me. Soothing breeze and very cool playlist made my saturday afternoon. Food is also very great there. Overall this place simply amaze me.

What a place!! Food, ambience, people, all was up to the mark! Am happy to see such a good cafe after a long time. Last time I went to a similar cafe in Bangalore. I was so satisfied because there very few cafes that  I stand out. Their food is well thought of, with their decor. I would recommend people to go there at least once and feel that there are cafes with spacious indoors rather than clumsy ones!

This new cafe have gained popularity very fast I must say! On a hot summer afternoon it was quite crowded.

They have both indoor and outdoor seating.

Decorated with blue and white lamps this cafe is so pretty.üòÄ

The outdoor seating area is so pretty. It has a swing! ‚ù§
Coming to food we ordered Apricot Chicken Wings,Bbq chicken pizza and Strawberry mousse.

Apricot Chicken Wings: It had 6 pieces. The chicken pieces were scullent and well prepared in the apricot sauce. I liked the flavour very much. Quite different from other cafes which serve bbq chicken wings. üòä

Bbq Chicken Pizza: This one was filled with cheese! üíô and topped with shredded chicken pieces,capsicum, onion and bbq sauce. Loved it too!

Strawberry Mousse: Mousse was prepared to perfection. This one was so pretty! ‚ù§

Prices are devoid of taxes and pocket friendly! Will visit again to try out the main courses! üòä

My friends dragged me there an evening. I was excited to find out what replaced Abar Baithak, and check out their continental spread.
The decor is pretty, with kettles as lamps and blue and white (tsk! tsk!) decor. We chose to laze on the sofa. It ¬†was a little noisy given the crowd. The bar counter setting of the till excited my friends a tad bit too much :P . ¬†The staff was quite courteous. ¬†Interesting choice of bottles to serve water in, I assumed it to be filtered one.¬†
¬†We ordered BBQ Chicken Burger, Cappuccino Honey Mustard Chicken, Chicken Steak Sizzlers and Chipotle BBQ Wings Sizzler.¬†
The BBQ CHICKEN BURGER was quite delicious , with the steak patty being succulent and filling. We all loved the dip served with it. I'd say a poached egg would be a good addition to it.¬†
The CAPPUCCINO ordered by my friend was pretty standard though needed a lot of sugar.¬†
The HONEY MUSTARD CHICKEN was delicious! It was the star of the dishes we ordered and I'd go back just for that. ¬†It was cooked perfectly in a honey mustard sauce. Served with flavoured rice and chips and greens. ¬†The rice and greens enhanced the flavours as they have been tossed in some sauce. The chicken was succulent sweet goodness. Full marks for this one.¬†
I'm not the kind who goes into restaurants ordering Sizzlers, I don't think everyone can make them. I'm specific and I know my sizzlers. But this time Akash Biswas¬†pursued me, and I'm glad he did. ¬†We ordered CHICKEN STEAK SIZZLER and CHIPOTLE BBQ WINGS SIZZLER. The Steak Sizzler was pretty standard, served in a mushroom sauce with greens and chips. The chicken was cooked well, and the sauce was ¬†tangy . Well done. Then came my order Chicken Wings sizzler. Spicy Chicken wings cooked in BBQ sauce and served with greens and chips. The wings were on point, and the sizzler help them keep crispy and a bit charred. The greens were marinated and cooked well. This too shall get full marks.¬†
Over all it was a fabulous experience dinning here, and I'd be coming back sometimes soon.

We ordered spaghetti with white sauce ,cheese Fondue the Fondue arrived with bread stick not with gralic bread cube which was metioned in the menu.

Ambience : nice, romantic. Both outdoor and indoor(AC) seating available. Smoking is allowed.

Food: Quality of food is up to the standards. We tried pina colada, chicken wings, baby corns, chicken sizzler and chicken steak. 
The sizzler and steak were delicious with big portions. The starters were just fine but the drink was below our expectations.

Service: very slow. From taking order to arranging seats to even giving the bill, they take long timefor everything.

Price: very pocket friendly and the prices on menu are all inclusive of tax.

Overall a nice experience. Would suggest to visit here with family or on a date.

Pretty place. Loved the quaint space and the relaxed ambiance. I had the Ginger Mint herbal infusion, the cottage cheese balls, and onion rings to go with the tea. Although it was a quick stop for a breather in the middle of a shopping spree, Blue Mug charmed me enough to want to write a review. Tea was refreshing and the cottage cheese balls were delish. The onion rings could have been less salty though. I'll be back for the food.

This one was making quite a buzz in the city, so gave a visit. It was bit different from all the other restaurants that i have visited till now. It offers an outdoor sitting as well as a Ac room. We enjoyed both. Inside, you will find a bean bag seating arrangement and we sat there. Because of that it was difficult for them to spot us and we were left unattended for few minutes and we have to call one of them for the menu cards. Apart from this, the staffs were really good and the boy who attended us was so friendly. Keep it up mate!¬†
I loved ever corner every bit of this place, be the decor or be the ambience. Prices are also pretty reasonable and the prices are inclusive of all taxes so no hidden cost.

Coming to the food we ordered :

Cappuccino (Caramel and Vanilla)

Crunchy Garlic Filled Mushroom - ¬†tasty but was bit oily.

Chicken Steak Sizzler - ¬†I had sizzler for the first time. So can't compare but felt good. :)

Honey Mustard Chicken - For me it was better than the sizzler.

Donuts - Again something that i had it here for the first time. I ate three of them and every one of them was better than the other.

Blueberry Pastry - It was perfect for a sweet tooth craving.

So, overall its just a perfect combination of everything in one.¬†
I would love to go here again and again and would recommend this to everyone out there. Do visit guys!!

I went to this cute little place a couple of days ago with two of my friends. I really liked the decor which uses blue kettles and blue bottles for lights. It has both an indoor and an outdoor seating area. The outdoor area has a cozy swing and is surrounded with greenery. The inside has a lot of blue lighting and small bulbs. It's a very comfortable space.

Coming to the food, we ordered an 8-inch barbecue chicken pizza, a chicken sizzler steak and chicken wings. (Yes, lots of chicken) Honestly, none of it was bad. The pizza was cheesy but not too cheesy. The flavor from the steak sauce just pops in your mouth and fries were crisy and well seasoned. The wings were extremely flavourful as well. Hey, I don't have anything negative to say about the food. :D

The service was amazing. üëå
The food was served quickly even though the place was loaded. The staff is extremely friendly and they make an actual effort to make sure the service goes well. I'm hoping to go back for round 2. :D

The d√©cor and the other reviews on Zomato was the reason I decided to visit this cafe today. I really liked the idea of having an outdoor seating as well as an AC room to choose from. That's the only nice thing I have to say about this place.
The quality of the food is way below standard. We ordered Spaghetti in white sauce, Cheese Fondue , Oreo shake and mango peach shake. The fondue arrived with bread sticks and not with garlic bread cubes as mentioned in the menu. The cheese in it looked like it was the pasta dressing. It was pathetic. The pasta lacked taste. 
There is no staff to look after the outdoor area. I had to wait for 15 minutes just to ask for the bill. The bill was totalled wrong. There was an item we didn't order. 
I wouldn't go back. I really was disappointed. The staff needs better training and the chef really needs to work harder.

My friend and I went here for a quick pre-dinner snack. The quaint cafe has a nice chill vibe to it. Artwork is pretty decent. It has a piano and a guitar (which my extremely talented friend ended up playing after the meal). We ordered an apricot barbecue chicken wing, a chocolate brownie and a chocolate drum. The total bill was 715 rupees which I frankly felt was way too high. It was my mistake that we forgot to check how the bill was so high since we had to rush home. In hindsight, there must have been some mistake but there is no way I can get the money back now, is there? Good food, good ambience. If only my experience wasn't marred because of this.

A newly opened cafe at Jodhpur park and since I like to explore different cafes, thought of visiting this one with my friends. The place is nicely decorated and the ambiance is cool. A good place to hang out with friends. I liked the swing in the outside sitting area very much. But they could have made some arrangements for fans there because it becomes really difficult to sit there on summer afternoon. We ordered chicken steak sizzler and bacon sandwich. The sizzler was delicious. At such a low price I doubt you can get such delicious sizzler. The sandwich could have had some sauce but it was okay. The only disappointment is with the service and staffs. They are not at all trained. The service is very poor. They even forgot to serve us the bacon sandwich after the sizzler. We had to remind them. But then I think they will work on this. Otherwise it's a nice place to be.

It's a beautiful cafe located in a peaceful area among the residential complexes of Southern Avenue. This cafe which looked better than what I saw in the pictures on Zomato, was promising enough to satisfy me to visit this at least once again in the only month I have left in Kolkata (I am not a resident of Kolkata). 

We ordered "crunchy garlic filled mushrooms" for starters, and a "chicken steak" and "honey mustard chicken" for main course, with "fruit sangria" for drinks. The mushroom starter was decent for me despite that I am not a huge fan of mushroom  dishes. However, my friend who likes mushrooms, loved it. The steak and the honey mustard chicken  were both fantastic. The steak however stole the show with its great quantity, brilliant taste and the perfection to which it was cooked. The fruit sangria was beautifully decorated and people who love sweet stuff will love it.

In the end, the service was good and I was amazed to see that the invoice didn't add any additional taxes. So the invoice total for all these stuff we had was merely 720 bucks. Pretty cheap I would say. 

Just one negative thing about this place was that it only had one of the coffees available among the over 10-12 coffee kinds mentioned in the menu. That part was disappointing. Otherwise, it was a fantastic visit which made my Sunday afternoon.

i had booked a table for two through zomato for a monday afternoon. it was hot hence we preferred ¬†to sit inside under the ac . excellent service . location is easy just follow the zomato map . ordered a chicken steak sizzler . which was served with grilled veggies and french fries. tasted okayish . you can get better sizzlers in the town . nevertheless prices are inclusive of tax and very pocket friendly. also ordered two shakes . one oreo shake and the other snickers shake . they were just awesome . i have been planing to visit the place again to try some more of their shakes and starters. it doesnt affect you pocket much .ambience is good . one more thing they provide free wifi . you just need to ask the password. ¬†do have a visit

This is a nice small place located in Jodhpur Park. Not that far from South City.

It has both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements and is a nice cosy, homely place.

We ordered Fish & Chips, BBQ Chicken Burger, Chicken drumsticks, Cappuccino and Oreo Shake.

The Fish and Chips wad nice, the usual fried fish with fries, I feel the fries could have been a bit more crispier.

The burger was good and filling with veggies and a cheese, which added to the flavor.

I had the chocolate cappuccino and it was normal, I didn't actually find any different taste.

The Oreo shake was impressive. Tasted good. 

The bill came to 852 all inclusive.

All in all...a nice and cheap place for decent food.

I had most horrible experience here. I went with my friends tonight and it was hell crowded. we were asked to wait. we waited nearly 20 mins to get in. then we got a table and ordered a pasta and a chicken stake. the staff was very unmindful and we had to ask him repeatedly for just a bottle of water. we were again kept waiting for another 25-30mins. then finally when we enquired about the food the manager told us that both our dishes were out of stock for tonight. we were shocked and left the place. they kept us waiting without even informing us anything.. what a disgusting behaviour. it was 10pm already and all the nearby places were closed. we had to come back home starving.. I strongly suggest not to visit.

The starters were very tasty so also d chicken steak sizzler but d mixed sea food sizzler contained only fish and prawn..and it was 'too Fishy'..lemonade contained more ice making it diluted..
Overall d experience is good..and d main thing is its very pocket friendly..must try for all..
And after seeing d bill d only word dat will come out from your mouth...'Matro'  (only)..

The chicken steak Sizzler was really delicious. Chicken club sandwich was filling and tasty. Apricot chicken wings were yummy. Bacon sandwich was average. Fish sizzler had a very tiny piece of fish, not worth 300rs. Cheese fondue was an absolute disaster. Service is very slow. Ambience is nice and cosy. The laid back nature and lack of training of the staff and the attitude thrown by the man sitting at the counter are the biggest drawbacks.

This place is a delight for coffee-lovers because the coffee here is really cheap. We ordered a BBQ burger was pretty decent.The chipotle BBQ sizzler tasted good,though the quantity was not very filling. The price of sizzlers are really less here and so one cannot really complain about its quantity. Mexican french fries and Hazelnut flavoured Capucchino was the first thing we had while we were floored by the decor, the cute kettle-lamps that hung above every sitting, and also the pretty outdoor sitting that called for a good photography session. Hoping to visit this place very soon again! With

Probably after an year or half I am back with my food diaries.
So let's start with the newly opened little gem at Jodhpur park where I recently went for lunch.
Its a little cafe with amazing handcrafted decor, beautiful DIY tea kettles hanging around.
They have both indoor and outdoor seating.
Both of them are pretty well, overall impressed with the ambience.
Staffs are very very humble. They got is cigarettes from a nearby shop without even asking for it. 
An amazing chilling spot which is very very cheap, yessss.
Coming to the food,
We ordered chicken wings , fruit sangria, coke, chicken steak and coconut payesh.
Chicken wings were tangy and perfectly cooked. 150  for 6 pieces? I mean how many well decorated caf√©s gives us that?
Fruit sangria was well flavoured, good to go with snacks.
Chicken steak was served with sauteed veggies, herb rice and French fries. The quantity was really good.
The major turnoff was the coconut payesh. It was a plain whipped cream with a few pieces of coconut in it. But they have some good variety of pastries to try.
They serve water in colorful water jars which is my favorite.
Blue mug is super cheap and well maintained cafe which is a perfect chilling spot anyday.
They offered us with some complimentary gift but we denied to take it as we were running late.
So cute of them right? 
One of the rare amazing cafe tbh.

Went to this small food joint today with one of my friend. Truely one of the hidden gems of kolkata. First of all this cafe is really pocket friendly and the quality of the food is worth the price! We ordered one plate of chicken mayo sandwich and a BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza was amazing far better than we had expected! The sandwiches and potato chips served in one plate was also worth appreciating. Only we were offended with the staffs a bit as they were too busy with their works and hardly had time to serve us. Otherwise a very nice place to have quality food at a very minimal price. Highly recommended!

This place is the new trend, and why wouldn't it be? 
Location - come straight inside towards jodhpur park via the lane of leather land from south city, and Baan you see a huge blue mug board. 
Ambience and seating - a cozy, light and relaxing ambience with indoor and outdoor seating. 
Decor - indoor section is groomed with kettle lamps and glass bottle lampshades. It has a keyboard and guitar for jamming and also a section of books. Variety of seats, bean bags, sofas and chairs. 
The outdoor section is a super pretty area with little plants surrounding it. A swing seat with tools and chairs make it perfect for an evening date. 
Service and staff - friendly, courteous and a satisfactory speedy service. 

FOOD - I loved it. The taste is not authentic which makes it a lil more innovative. As they say taste with a little twist never harms anyone. 
We went for a double shot cappuccino, and lemonade for quenchers, bruschetta and crispy fried prawn with garlic dip for appetizers. 
For the main course I settled for a chicken steak, and my brother went for a honey mustard chicken. 

Now, this steak is amazing. Perfect tender slices of chicken generously drizzled with a Sharp mushroom sauce. Accompanied with fries, sauteed veggies and herbed rice. Portion wise just perfect for one. 
The honey mustard chicken was cooked well. Served with rice and an olive salad. But it was dry to be eaten at a go. 

Pocket pinch- reasonable and worth it. 
Will be back again . No doubt. 
Keep hoggin!

A new place in Jodhpur Park with open seating area for that lovely summer evening, good food and good company. The food is affordable. We took the Mexican Fries which were decent. The apricot chicken wings were a class apart with a very different flavour. The barbeque chicken pizza was available only in 8inches but was loaded with cheese, caramelised onions and chicken. The bill came to only 380. Recommended for people who love adda + food in South Calcutta.

Located amidst the lanes of Jodhpur Park we found a new hang out place...After office to relax our souls me and my friends decided to settle for this Cafe bookmarked since long time on our Zomato accounts..
. An amazing place for people who are in search of good food and amazing ambience... The cafe has facilities of AC as well as Open air sitting arrangement..
We opted for Open air since the cafe was full and we wrnt ready to wait .We ordered for some titbits 
BARBEQUE CHICKEN PIZZA ... MEXICAN FRENCH FRIES.... last but not the least APRICOT CHICKEN WINGS..
To start with MEXICAN FRENCH FRIES ..it was quite ordinary and was simple french fries..
Then we gorged on BARBEQUE CHICKEN PIZZA which had 8 slices and we were quite satisfied as it was soft ...cheesy and tasty
The last but not the least APRICOT CHICKEN WINGS..this was 1 of a kind and quite new for my tastebuds ...perfect mixture of spices .. in 1 word Amazing...
A must try for people who are a fan of Open air cafes 
And i would like to come back again..

Tucked in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park ,a small restaurant with some beautiful decor has emerged which is named Blue Mug. This restaurant  opened this year in the month of January but is already seeing a good amount of footfall in this short span not only due to it's moderate price but also due to the standard and innovation of the food wjich is being found there.The desserts  take a heartwarming place in our hearts .Some of them topping the list are Coconut Payesh which is an ice -cream type of a thing served in the shells of coconut and giving us a flavour of coconut as a whole.Then there is another dessert called Tulip Mousse which is a chocolate pudding served on the shells of broken and molten chocolate.And guess what? Both these desserts are priced attractively at 45 and 55 bucks respectively taxes being included.Another must try is the Chicken Steak Sizzler where you get a whole platter of Chicken, Vegetables and French Fries which can easily be shared by two at a time .Chicken Penne Pasta gives you a soothing taste of pasta in red sauce and chicken being tossed perfectly. The restaurant also tops in it's classy and unique looks which can be well seen in the pictures given alongside.
The cafe is small and very new so at times they are out of their lip smacking desserts .
The uniqueness of the desserts and the standard is attracting a huge crowd which is a plus point.
One should always go back to Blue Mug to taste their Coconut Payesh which is not only cheap but can't leave our thoughts for a while due to it's taste and texture being blended so perfectly.
The restaurant needs to get better in their service quality which it will soon hopefully .
Blue Mug needs to be explored after having a small walk from Lords More but it would be worth it if you can  go and explore it.So hurry up and give your taste buds a new taste of tinge and variety.

The place looks really good.. I had just ordered a Oreo shake which was really tasty.. One disturbing thing which i found was that they did'nt have any facilities for fan in their outside seating area which is a big No-No during the summer season. Though the outside seating area is perfect for winter times,but a big no during the summers!!

Tucked in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park is Blue Mug, with both outdoor and indoor sitting arrangement. 
Awesome ambience and commendable staff service.
We ordered Cheese Fondue, Apricot Chicken wings, BBQ chicken pizza, Chicken sizzler, Blueberry pastry.
Lip-smacking food without burning a hole in one's pocket.
Definitely going to visit again!

P.S. Complimentary desserts for each of us! (What's not to love?)

Expected a lot but after waiting for a while got a table.
It was even later to my surprise was served the main course of the 3 course meal, den was served the starter and to the end of the course was served the soup. Pretty disappointed. Food was really average can do a lot lot better. Decor was good, adding an extra touch is the outside area.

Tucked neatly inside the bylanes of Jodhpur Park, this cafe has garnered a steady number of regulars in a short time. Having heard very good reviews, I had to drop by and so I did. After waiting for a good 20 mins, we managed to bag a table. Though the indoors looked pretty, we chose to sit outdoor.

Now the tables, a mix of high and low ones, are pretty crammed in here. We were seated at the low ones which were extremely inconvenient because the chairs didn't match it's height. So we were having to really bend down and pick up the food. When asked to be seated at a higher table when available, we were assured we will be. But when one such table did get empty, it was given to someone else. After reminding them again, the change was made. 

Coming to the food, the cold coffee was decent. The fact that the prices are very moderate, is a big plus. The Mediterranean Prawn Salad was disappointing. It was a regular salad with egg, lettuce and olives, and exactly one cherry tomato and five small prawns. Didn't find any Mediterranean flavours as such in this one. The Chicken Club Sandwiches looked great, and tasted good too. However the sides were dry and devoid of any filling at all. And that's the worst way to hurt any sandwich lover. The fact that the brown edges weren't taken off didn't help them either. Also I specifically mentioned to not put cucumber in my sandwich, but no heed was paid to it.

So the cafe looks pretty and has polite staff. But the food can be bettered. At least the things I tried were not satisfactory. And also the low tables are extremely uncomfortable. Please either change the tables or put lower chairs/stools/floor cushions with them.

The decor insisted me to visit this place. I liked the hanging kettles. There is an option of outdoor seating with dim lights. Well, I was not really satisfied with the food. The chicken club sandwich didn't have enough filling. The mojito was too sour. Even after asking them to change it, it didn't taste good.

Accidentally bumped upon this place a few days back while strolling leisurely in the locality with a friend. Pleased with the unpretentious yet appealing outdoor sitting area nestled amidst small palm plants, we decided to give it a try. The jhula over the corner of the little garden adds to the overall homely mood for a good conversation. Food was delicious. We had chicken wings, club sandwiches and a fish and chips. I ordered for a chocolate cappu@ccino but it was too sweet to my taste, though my friend had the vanilla one which she liked. They definitely have a large variety of beverages to choose from and I'm definitely coming back for trying out the mocktails. A recommended place to gossip and smoke(only in the garden) over a your favourite beverage.

Newly opened European style cafe is located at the heart of South Kolkata posh residential area , Jodhpur Park. Like you find on Europe , they have air conditioned  inside sitting as well as outside sitting arrangement. The blue neon sign looks 
nice from outside. We sat inside since it was a warm evening. Inside decor was nice and cozy. They have small collection of coffee table books, musical instruments for you to play with. Choice if food was truly continental with choice of veg and non veg. They even serve breakfast.  We started with golden fried prawn. Prawns were fresh , well fried with crust bread crumb and served with tartar sauce. It was followed with one of their signature dish Cheese fish fry. This was served with potato chips and tartear sauce. The fish fillet and cottage cheese slice was bonded with bread crumb and golden fried. We also tried their pizza. It was a chicken pizza. Unlike the other two items this was pretty ordinary. We finished with coconut souffl√©.  This was truly awesome and was served in a coconut shell. It has fresh coconut pieces a plenty and was very smooth. Must try for coconut lovers. Overall experience was very good. Very reasonably priced. Our total pocket pinch for all the above was just Rs.600, which is very reasonable.

I went to blue mug for the first time with my friend yesterday. I had heard alot about this place and whatever I had heard was true in every aspect. The food is amazing. Apricot chicken wings was delicious. Oreo shake is a must try for all the chocolate lovers. Its quite reasonable for teens like us. Beginning from the ambience to the service, everything is so great. It's a perfect place to hangout with peeps. I am really impressed with this cafe. I would surely love to visit this place again.

Location : Jodhpur Park, near Reliance fresh store.

The cafe has a outdoor space with swings and all, and an air conditioned part. Bout theme prevails throughout the cafe and usage of unique decorative items give this space a rich feel.

I just went there to grab a quick bite and ordered a plate of apricot chicken wings and chicken club sandwich.

The chicken wings were perfectly smoked and delicious.

The sandwiches were pretty filling and generously stuffed with chicken.

Pocket pinch is very low!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that I've visited Blue Mug more than 5 times at least; I'm in a better position to write a detailed review.

Food :

*The sizzlers are amazing. My favourite ones are the fish in lemon butter sauce and the lamb sizzler. The fish one is amazing.

*Cheese fish fry : OMG. This is one of the best fish fries I've ever had. The fish was so soft but the batter was perfectly crispy. And the cheese oozzing out is a sight you shouldn't miss.

*Crispy fried prawns : Amazing.

*BLT sandwich : this one was pretty good as well.

*Cheese fondue : perfect finger food.

*mocktails : almost all the mocktails are amazing.

*Desserts : The pastries are very good (sourced from Swissyum concept foods). Their special Sundae is to die for. You won't be able to finish this alone. Even two people won't be able to finish this one their own. It's that massive.

One thing yet on my to-eat list is their coocnut kheer. I've heard it's awesome.

This cafe definitely bags a recommendation from me. If you're planning to visit this in the evening, make sure you go their early as the place remains full almost all the time and you might have to wait outside for your table.

Located near Abar Baithak cafe,this place is a hidden gem.
Ambiance is awesome and one can enjoy outdoor sitting too.They also have a book shelf and a mini karaoke too.
A great menu variety in such a low price is pretty awesome isn't it?..Plz do try their desserts...its amazing.
Now comming to the menu,we ordered:

Veg Cottage Baked Pizza (8'inches): Pizza is filled with loadz of cheese,paneer,mushrooms etc...it can beat the dominos easily in terms of taste and quantity.

Crunchy Garlic Filled Mushroom: Show stopper of the day.Mushroom filled with cheese paneer and other staffs will definitely make you lick ur finger.Plz do give it a try!!

Mango Passion Twist: Its pretty much moderate...If you are not that thirsty enough..better try their food than drinks.

Blueberry Pastry: Aaaahhh!!!Amazing...all sweet lovers do taste it.Its one of the best blueberry pastry I habe tasted.

Who doesnt want to visit this place which have such a wide variety of food to offer,books and karaoke to entertain and a sweet outdoor sitting arrangement admist the lush greens to soothe one's eyes..!!Will definitely drop in their again üòä

Blue Mug is a cafe inside a narrow lane in Jodhpur Park with a significant Blue Mug logo at the entrance. It has a sitting area outside with swings and cushions and the inside of the cafe is well decorated with tea kettles and pub-like area, sitting arrangements are a little different than the usual ones. Walls have paintings and posters and beautiful lanterns hang from the ceiling. 
The ambience is followed by the presentation of the menu card which is really impressive. I ordered Apricot Chicken Wings and Chicken Club Sandwich. The Apricot Chicken Wings were crisp from outside and tender from inside. The juicy wings melt in your mouth giving that heavenly taste. The Club Sandwich is so filling and cheesy with layers of chicken salad and cheese that you would want to come back again just to have this. 
Staff service is commendable and the ambience deserves special mention. The presentation of the dishes require a little more of innovation and creative ideas. The food tastes great and I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this cafe soon. The price is also reasonable and the food is worth the amount.

The place has a quirky and positive feel to it and I definitely enjoyed sitting outdoors because the breeze was lovely in the evening and the decor is fun too. The quality and quantity of food is pretty good for the price you pay. We ordered for Chicken Mayonnaise Grilled Sandwich and Chicken Spaghetti Pasta with white sauce and extra prawns both of which tasted pretty good, a very well made Virgin Mojito and a little overpriced Oreo Shake. The service was pleasant too.
This new joint in the city is a great place to hang out in and is much better than its counterparts that have emerged around Jodhpur Park. Definitely going back!

Blue mug is a nice addition to the coffee, adda scene in Kolkata. Their ambiance makes one comfortable even when your sitting on one of their industrial metal frame chairs (they do have couches and beanbags for those that just want relax and get comfy). With outside an indoor seating you can take your pick. If there's one thing they have spot on is their prices for food, there aren't many places you can get a decent chicken burger for 80‚Çπ. Chicken wings are great and their club sandwich looks yum. Though I have to recommend going there later in the day if you want food and better service. If you're looking to chill and grab a bite then visit blue mug and grab a bite.

We planned on visiting abar baithak but since there was no place to sit there we searched for other cafe's nearby and found this! Decor is nice with beautiful photographs on the walls,kettle lamps hanging from the ceiling and also they have an acoustic guitar and a synthesizer which I think they let you play if you want to. Also,they serve water in champagne bottles! Coming to the food we ordered orange mohito,blueberry smoothie,BBQ chicken burger and ham filled sandwich. The orange mohito was very nice and refreshing! The burger was also nice and it is for just 100 buck which is pretty amazing. The sandwich was extremely filling snd tasty and totally value for money! The rates are reasonable enough and the no tax part is actually true! So will definitely visit this place again!

Been searching for a caf√© for long which will offer you a true experience of coffee and snacks and chats over tea. Boy! I am lucky.
Truly this should feature in the section of hidden gems of this city.
As we walked in a rainy cloudy day we were mesmerized. 
1. Food was extremely good and comes easy on pocket ( when you compare the price with some big shot coffee house in Kolkata offering nothing but view).
2. Portions were big and ample , we had chicken cheese sandwich, and chicken wings in apricot sauce.
3. Tea - I had apple flavored black tea which was as smooth as it can be. It is a suggestion please ask for this speciality.
4. Coffee- cappuccino arabica MS , it was just lip smacking, no more words!
5. Dessert - blueberry mousse, another yummy platter.
Staffs were very courteous and suggestive of their speciality!
Only thing I have not given it a 5 üåü star simply because there is no fan in outdoor arrangement, though it's beautiful among the leaves but gets real sweaty on cloudy days.
Otherwise it was a pleasure to visit. One more mention they have this little karaoke system and an impressive book rack! I think zomato should feature a new section for you guys "book club" bond over your favourite cup on favourite books!

Tried this place for the first time on Women's Day. The place has been done up well. I liked the outdoor seating bit especially. The swing and the Erica Palms give that added effect. The waiters were courteous and the food delicious and pocket- friendly. However, I would advise them to have some music playing to subdue the din of the revellers. Lucky to have this place in the same neighbourhood that I live in :)

Last weekend we visited this place. As Jodhpur Park residents and cafe addicted people we were naturally enthusiastic when this cafe opened up in walking distance from our home. 

But I am sorry to say that the expectations and enthusiasm had a very bitter end. 

We ordered 2 main dishes for 2 of us and 2 coffee.
They served 1 main course and when asked about the other, said the other is coming.

We kept waiting and waiting with occasional enquiry about how long will it take for the other dish to come. The answer always was, it's coming...Only some more minutes. 

After about 15-20 mins they said that that the other dish is not available. We asked, but then why did you not tell earlier ? Why did you take the order ? They asked for apologies and was sorry for their behaviour.
We still wanted to have the food and thus asked them what can be brought very quickly as it was already quite late and it was their fault. 

So as per their advice we ordered‚Äã a grilled chicken sandwich. And again strated waiting. Some people walked in after our order was taken and sat near us.

Our patience broke all boundaries when after another 15-20 minutes and continuously requesting them to please give our order some priority as it was delayed due to their neglegence, they still served the main course for the party that came after our order was taken. 

We really did not know what to say and thus just paid for all we have consumed and left without having the sandwich.

Regards,
Kaushik

When I saw Blue Mug on Zomato trending page I thought let's give it a try.

‚óèLocation wise it is very near to the Abar Baithak cafe at Jodhpur park.

‚óèThey have outside seating arrangement as well as inside. 

‚óèWe wanted to try the outside but due to rain we couldn't. So we accommodate on inside. It was packed full of people. 

‚óèWe ordered Orange Blossom and Orange mojito and from those two Orange mojito was the best.
‚óèWe ordered Fish Finger with tartar sauce which turned out to be excellent a must try. Even I thought pizza will be thin crust but when the Chicken BBQ pizza came it was like soft and tasty with lots of cheese .

‚óèPricing on the other hand was damn cheap and our bill was only ‚Çπ600.

I will surely go again and try thier main courses...

This is a newly opened cafe,located near Allahabad Bank, jodhpur park branch. We chose the outdoor seating which was really cool. They have a 'dolna' where you can sit and chill. This is a perfect place to spend time alone or chilling with your friends. You can spend 2-3 hours easily! Nobody will bother you. Now come to the food! First we ordered snickers shake and apricot chicken wings. Both of items were great. Please try those if you ever visit this place. Then after sometime, we ordered fish steak which comes with French fries and sauted vegetables. Somehow we felt that the quantity was quite less comparing to other continental cafes. Anyways, taste of the fish was very good. The most charming thing came in the end...everything was TAX INCLUSIVE!! So it costs us only Rs. 560/-!!! Great place to chill for hours and pocket friendly too!

Really nice hangout space near Jodhpur Park. Great coffee at surprisingly competitive prices. Also the Chicken BBQ Burger packs a punch. The music is carefully selected and sequenced, and that is not too common I find these days. The smoking area has a good vibe about, although a strategically placed carrom board/other board games can do wonders as far as attracting a regular crowd goes.

Infact they provided great service throughout. I ordered fish n chips (apparently it's a 'big hit' there or so I was told). I found the food to be ok-ish. The coffee was good but it got finished in the blink of an eye. To summarize - nice decor ; cheaper than it's contemporaries ; great service ; ok-ish food.

Been here the other day with a group of my friends. Wanted to sit in the inner hall. Saw that the far end sofa was occupied by only two people. But was very casually instructed by the lady owner to go sit outside. Also noticed that the customers walking in the restaurant get preferential treatment.

Perhaps they have opened the cafe only for friends and family.

Overall not a very pleasant experience. Would never recommend

Blue mug is a quiet, new cafe near to Abar Baithak Jodhpur Park. The decor is average, but they do have an outside seating arrangement. The food is insanely affordable! We had flavored cuppas, orange and strawberry shakes and mohito, with apricot chicken wings and chicken steak sizzler. Everything tasted average. Also the place doesn't serve alcohol. Overall, a mediocre place ideal when you are cash strapped in the middle of a month and there are still a few days left for the salary!üòÇ

I am a cafe hunter. Found this amazing new coffee shop located in Jodhpurpark at the end of the similar lane where Abar Baithak was situated initially. This cafe is divided into two parts: an open fenced area which is smoking friendly and the obvious air conditoned seating. By the time I stepped in, it was jam packed. I opted for the smoking zone and was asked to wait. The staffs including the owner himself were extremely efficient. They got me and my friend a chair while we waited outside the cafe, even though the wait wasn't long enough. The boys made quick arrangements for us. We odered caramel coffee and chicken mayo sandwich. The coffee was brewed to perfection with right amount of froth. The sandwich was loaded with chicken and dripping mayo. They have done a good job with their food section. They serve proper meals like steaks, sizzlers, pasta, pizza at a very reasonable rate which I'm gonna deffinitely try next time. As it was 14th Feb, there was a complimentary chocolate fudge pastry after we cleared the check. Oh! my god.... the pastry was to die for. I can see myself as a Blue Mug regular very soon.

My oh my!!! Have to confess I'm on Cloud Nine now that I've discovered this caf√© right in the heart of Jodhpur Park. A hidden gem for sure. Cosy ambience. Very well done decor. Reminds one of the cafes in Mumbai. Best space is the jhula they have put up in their outdoor seating area. Very pocket-friendly prices. One can simply chill here with friends or even alone reading a book or writing like I did. The staff are also very warm with smiles etched broad on their faces. Awesome job, guys!!!

Just visited this cafe which I saw earlier on Zomato, through which I thought the place would be amazing but I was drastically disappointed by The Blue Mug. One thing about this cafe which is good is only that it has a great decor other than that everything is just bad. I was with my friends so we ordered a large Saffron and cinnamon tea but later we asked the waiter to cancel it and get us 3 cups of it and after half hour the waiter brings us the large one and again we had to tell him that we had cancelled this way before and asked for 3 cups of it. Our appetisers came Cottage cheese balls and mushroom balls and after having it we order for 2 veg burgers and one fish and chips. While we waited for our order our tea came, we patiently had that. After a while the waiter came again and confirmed our order again and we asked how much time will it take now he said 15 mins more. We have been waiting for the said dishes already for 20 mins then he tells us to wait again for 15 mins after reconfirming it. We were totally bugged out at that moment and we asked him to cancel the order and just give us the bill. The bill came and I checked it, they charged us for 1 veg burger and that large beaker of cinnamon and saffron tea even when we didn't had it. I asked the waiter to check the bill and remove these charges as we didn't had them. So at that time he started arguing with us that the order for tea was not cancelled and it came to our table so we have to pay for that, we countered it cz we had asked him only to cancel it 20 mins back why didn't he do it. After that he went and and got the bill changed and gave us the bill in there Blue Mug Holder which should ideally have Chloromint toffees as mouth freshener, but ours just had empty wrappers. At this point we were so disappointed by this place that we didn't even bother to say anything regarding this and just paid and left. Blue mug gave me one of the worst experiences one can have in all the cafe's of Kolkata.

Hey guys. If you wanr a serious review about the place. Frankly speaking... not at all happy. Decor is nice no doubt but certains points need attention.

1. You guys must have a television or monitor with music or sports running.
2. The chairs in the outer courtyard are not so comfortable to sit on.
3. a suugestion maybe to perhaps put some puzles or cross words on the table for us to be occupied while waiting.
4. Please please please train your staff and teach them to be more friendly in their pproach.
5. coming to your beverage quality. seriously the coffe has no aroma. Either you guys do not know how to properly brew them or your water is just not right.
6. Your staff cannot suggest mocktails or either they are not aware of what can be served.

the only thing commendable is the food of the place which is reaaly good. But what is a coffee shop which has no good coffee tea and beverages to offer.

Very Disappointed .... Perhaps my first and last visit.

Went on the inauguration day of the cafe, the 28th of February, with some of my friends,unexpectedly on that day every item on the list was for free, as we ordered for tea and coffee, they served with complimentary dishes like Cookies,Patties,Veg Cheese Balls and Chili Cheese Toast, all were delicious, their outdoor seating arrangement is really great, the ambiance is also too good, and their service specially of 'Bikramaditya' impressed us a lot.....again went on the day of Saraswati Puja, the Coffee was great but got little upset with the Apricot Chicken Wings, it was not up to the mark, overall had a nice experience...

A Very Good Atmosphere With Good Service inside the Cafe
The Musical instruments attracts me more towards the cafe

But The Only Thing That Dissapointed me was when i ordered two cold coffees and chicken omlet which i would like to rate two out of five and taste of the cold coffee was very bad for which i would rate zero

Please improve your beverege quality

A bit disappointed. Please improve your service guys. Moreover your service guys really should stop hiding behind the trees in the outer courtyard. We had to call out to one guys almost three times before he answered and attended

Great ambience, Great food. A decent cup of first flush accompanied by The fish fry with tartar sauce will leave u asking for more. The biggest usp being quality @extremely reasonable rates. The outdoor seating area is airy and less cumbersome unlike other cafes. A guitar to strum, a piano to play, a swing@ outdoor seating area to keep u relaxed..
A peaceful place to hang out with friends n family.

The ambiance is great. The place is dimly lit and perfect for casual outings, there is also a guitar and an electric piano in a corner and can be played by customers only. The food is good, service is a little slow. The shakes were good, we had oreo shake, snickers shake. The white sauce pasta was better compared to the read sauce one. A little slow service. But I am sure they will catch up. Perfect place for a casual outing!

Ambience and food are such essentials for a cafe and this one sure excels in both. I loved the food and the ambience too. This place not only offers a variety of food but lets you choose if you want to spend your time on the couch, the bean bags, the chairs indoor or the chairs outdoor. So food is not the only variety they have! The taste and quality being a constant of course.

Was looking for Abar Baithak which seems to be closed, but found this brand new outlet instead. Nice food, Outdoor seating is lovely in winter with a swing, good place to hangout. And the best part, this is Caf√© in the classic European sense, no second-hand Hookah smoke.
