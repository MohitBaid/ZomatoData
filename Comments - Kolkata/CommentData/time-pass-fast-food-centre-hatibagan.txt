Time pass is a resturant of college people. It is just behind Azad hind park (hedua park). The main usp of this food joint is cheep food, good quality, and quantity of food. If you hungry and need a light snack thn surely this is your destination. 
The negative point of it is they dont have proper sitting arrangements. They just some bench on the footpath. It is mainly takeway counter. Ambience is not so good and you might think place is not at all hyginic. 
I visit this place often. And i suggest try their corn soup as starter, pan fried momo for quick bites, also you can try their noodles with gravy for quick bites or main course and mix fried rice and sezwien chicken (all of their chicken is bit hard n boneless) for main course. Half plate is enough for one people. 
Price is very pocket friendly and useful for college student.

It is one of those North Kolkata restaurant that is value for money. You mainly get Chinese, but food quality is spot on. It's a small restaurant, best if you take your meal home. Young college goers definitely should try out this eatery.

There was a time when "Time Pass" was a genuine place to pass time satisfying your stomach. Though it does not possess a seating arrangement, we could manage easily near the branch of the adjoining tree to satisfy ourselves. Also, there are few plastic chairs where you can easily make yourself seated and have your food.

The prices are reasonable and I used to have full satisfaction , once upon a time. Although, it is slightly high priced than the footpath stalls, it manages to serve high quality stuffs.

However, with passage of time, the joint got popular but the food quality got slowly reduced.

Pay a visit to form an opinion!

This place is one of the best road side Chinese I have ever tasted. I love their mono and best of all is the momo soup, usually in any momo stall you get clear soup with momo, but these guys gives you proper and wonderful chicken soup with momo, in fact I enjoy the soup better than momo. By my review u all must have guessed I am obsessed with the momo soup of these guys. You get a wide range of Chinese items and all of them are equally lip smacking, the only drawback here is you have to sit on the road side bench and eat. Small guys, great taste, tummy filling, light on your pocket. Pack and take home and have or the other option is buy your food walk into the Headua Park (Swimming Pool) sit beside the pool and enjoy ur food. You can end up having a pool side romantic dinner.

Well got the privilege to be the first reviewer of this hidden gem in the Hedua park area. Very surprised not to find a single review of this fantastic road side fast food center. Came here with ¬†a childhood friend who took me here telling me about the best food items that could be tasted. Few small ¬†benches kept for you outside and crowd keep coming that shows how much the place is popular in the locality.¬†
Looked at the menu and took as suggested my friend who is a regular customer here. Tried the Egg Hakka noodles and Chilly chicken gravy. Noodles were pretty decent in taste, they were thick and quite well mixed with the veggies. Chilly Chicken was nothing far behind. Didn't expected it to be so nice. Chicken were fresh and juicy with the thick and spicy gravy. Very satisfied with both the things i had. Price Pinch is very pocket friendly.
