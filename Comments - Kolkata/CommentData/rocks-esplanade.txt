First of all, a vegetarian bar. ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜’
Whatever i didn't order any drinks but enjoyed the food here. Specially the rajasthani thali.
The food was more than satisfying and yum.
Ambience was quite good.
Service was quite ok

This area with lined bar-cum-restaurants in the busy streets of 'office-para' was very new to me. It was raining (unusually in February) which developed an intense urge to have a peg of Rum n coke with some spicy kababs or something and we saw this 'Rocks' on our way. From outside it looks like a rocking place inside, inside there was podium for singers who would start performing from the evening (we went during lunch). And then the biggest revelation...its a veg restaurant!!! Who on earth will even imagine a BAR-cum restaurant, with the name 'ROCKS', having performance podium...serves only veg! Anyway, keeping that sad part aside we settled for a peg of rum and cheese malai kabab. They give sliced cucumber and carrot with two chutneys and chanachur mixture as complementary. The kabab was okayish. In an all, i cant give more points to this place as it failed to impress me much.

If u want a rustic flavour in a crowded place like dhormotala its the place. Rustic is nothing but the DAAL-BATI-CHURMA... don't forget to try the Gujarati dhoklas ... A best essense of rajasthani delicacy in Kolkata.
. go for it and taste the basic Rajasthani thali.. You will not believe how much awesome it is
