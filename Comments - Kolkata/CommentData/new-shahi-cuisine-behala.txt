Located beside the agomoni community hall in Parnasree. A food joint, not a place to sit and dine in. I tried their mughlai dishes, rolls, chicken side dishes and biryani. Price is reasonable. Quality of food is also average, nothing special in it. Quantity is also good compared to the price one pays for a dish.

This outlet is located just a few metres away from my place beside the Agomoni Community Hall in Parnasree. This outlet has gone through many ups and downs. It had shut down last to last year and then again from last year it has been operational. I have been their customer right since the very early stages when they hadn't even completed the entire construction. I have had their rolls,noodles and a few chicken dishes. The rolls were pretty decent and were cheaper than the usual rates. The noodles were good and the quantity served was so-so. The chilli chicken that I distinctly remember of was more of boiled chicken. It had no taste as such. Hence,they should improve their chinese food items.
P.S.: All the dogs of Parnasree region gather around this shop God knows for what good reason. Cynophobic people should avoid visiting this outlet.

Well,  I was a resident of parnashree for 18 years and on my last few months of stay I had become a regular customer of this shop.  I usually bought rolls and momos as well as kebabs sometimes.  Rolls are great.  Momos are very good too. The mughlai section is also very tasty.  Needs to improve in the chinese section though.  Overall one the best outlets in the area.

Average restaurant . I tried Chicken Momo, Chicken fried momo, chicken chow, chilli chicken. The chinese items were average. Later one day I tired fish fy and chicken moglai paratha both were below average.
The restaurant is good for evening snacks. But not more than that. The biriyani was average and the othe north indian chicken side dishes were average in taste. 
The place is pocket friendly. They dont have proper dinning place. I would recomend take away.

Took momo once from here which was tasty. Located near my place. Biryani is not that good. Chinese items are okayish. Not worth it. Needs a hell lot of improvement.

The food is not so good but the biriyani is quite nice. It is was closed for a few years and it was again open. It has been reinvented , its not so nice that has been open. Quality and quantity of food is not nice. Should improve:-((

Being the first one to review.. Forget this place for the most.. Except for some tasty chow or rice.. Rest of the dishes have been made out of purpose with tandoor chicken recycled day after day with the refrigerator so never take a risk having them.. Only picks & value for money are the rolls,chowmeen
