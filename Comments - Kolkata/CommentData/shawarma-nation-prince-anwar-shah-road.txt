If you want some Lebanese food in the town just drop by it. Enjoy food and forget everything. 

If there was more seating capacity at this place would have rated it as 5 star but still finger licking and delicious food.

Enjoy guys!!

Ordered through Swiggy.

Lebanese Taouk in Arabic Spices - Grilled flat boneless chicken marinated with Arabic spices & served with Pita bread
Shish Taouk in Arabic Spices - Grilled sauce stick chicken marinated with Lebanese spice & served with Pita bread
Arabic Chicken Biriyani - If you want to try some other flavour of biriyani than the Calcutta biriyani, this will be a welcome taste for you
Turkey Kebab - This is just to try turkey but to be frank if someone dont tell you its turkey, you wont understand. At least i didn't quite get much difference.¬†

Lemon and Mint Cooler - This was complimentary and was refreshing.

Very easily locatable place , situated at Lake Gardens Bus Stopage. A good looking one also , in spite of small sitting arrangement. I really loved the mirror thing in the sitting place.

Ambience is okayish.

We ordered Chicken Shawarma wrap , but the order-taker adviced us to take Jumbo Chicken Shawarma as the adviced dish is a bit larger and costs only Rs 20 extra. So we ordered that.

Service was not that bad. We were served with our order within around 7 minutes.

A fair bit good amount of tossed veggies like carrots, beans and stuff , french fries and many chicken pieces along with mayonaise and cheese were loaded inside soft ,white Paratha forming a roll. A white paper was wrapped around the roll. If was served with some sort of Green Chilli Chutney.
Taste was something more than just "awesome".

Overall , I liked the place and the Shawarma wrap would bring my taste buds time and again back to this place.

Hey foodies, do hit this place someday :)

Located just at the corner of the famous Lord's Bakery More, Shawarma Nations isn't that big of a eatery. Inside there are a couple of seats but the place is cramped. And the seats are not levelled properly, so you end up being either too short or too high for the person sitting opposite. Decorations are nice, and the staff were decent. Talking about food, about 8months back, I had the Oriental Chicken Salad which was good, they also served it with a couple of pita breads. The spicy symbol beside it is useless and the quantity was enough for one person. Last week had the Chicken Shawarma Wrap which was basically filled with mayo and with the green chutney, will be good for one serving but one should opt for the more expensive one with more filings. And frankly
I felt it was overpriced. It was tasty, but lacked spice and more on the meh side. Nothing extraordinary. Then came the mutton lebaneh burger. Big enough but not that huge, good for lunch, but still you'll have room left in your stomach. Veggies were good, and they served it with ketchup but somehow it wasn't that spicy and you won't feel that mutton flavours popping inside. Decent, but not great.
If you're on a run, Shawarma Nation is a good option, but you'll find better places to eat around the same area.

Place is small so it's a bit congested. Food is also not upto the mark. French fries are really good but the mayonnaise that they put in the shwarma tastes like yogurt. I am not even sure whether that's actually mayonnaise or yogurt. That taste sucks. The chicken that they make also doesn't taste upto the mark with lots of onions.

It's a small place near lord's junction. We ordered 1 chicken shawarma wrap and 1 mutton burger... I wasn't satisfied with the size of the burger compared to it's price. It's about the size of a CD rom or maybe smaller. The Shawarma wrap was just OKAY. But, if you're too hungry and you end yourself up in lord's junction it's fine that you go in or grab something from in here.

This place opened up near Lake Gardens a few years back. I visited Shawarma Nation quite a number of times and no doubt, it is the best Lebanese joint in town. The Chicken Shawarma is their speciality and that is what I prefer every time I go there.¬†

Their menu also holds a lot of other goodies which are quite good and pocket friendly. The service is okay, tends to slow up a bit during busy days. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is a fan of Lebanese food!

Delicious shawarmas at pocket friendly prices. I have tried nearly every dish im their menu. Chicken shawarma is a must try here. Cheese chicken shawarma is also a very good option. Mutton shawarma is good. A part from shawarmas, the chicken starrer dishes are equally good. The garlic dip that they put on shawarmas is a must for me whenever I order from here.

This place opened up at Lord's Crossing a few years back. Haven't had food at the place as the sitting area is small. I've had ordered food to be taken away from here a few times but it is only now that I'm reviewing this place.

Probably the second best place for Shawarmas after Ar-Han-Thai at Spencers,South City Mall.
¬†
Tried out their Chicken Shawarma Salad on my last visit.
It was filled with veggies-tomatoes,capsicum,onions, and a few slices of olives on top.
They used two sauces for their dressing- a green mint sauce and¬† orange-coloured one I wasn't sure of. The two sauces mixed up the taste of the dish a bit.
Chicken Shawarma Salad cost Rs. 180/-.
Service was okay.

Had the combo of lemon mint cooler and chicken wrap. The wrap was good with lots of fillings ; white sauce was in  perfect amount. The lemon and mint cooler was quite nice. However,  those two didn't compliment each other appropriately and hence I would suggest order them separately .
P.s prices in the menu are tax inclusive

I had ordered from Shawarma Nation via swiggy so this won't be a review related to the ambience of the place. Though the food was on an average side. The panner wrap I had ordered was mostly on the tasteless side whereas it was supposed to be spicy. 
The side dish was equally bad.

Never mind, this is one of my favorite joints when it comes to a quick bite for my hungry belly!
Their hummus is good and the pita is average.

I love eating their Jumbo chicken shawarma and chicken shawarma salad.
The best part is, the pocket pinch is average for such yum food.

The outlet small, so it is cozy in winters, but a bit too small for summers. I really hope they expand it.
If you have a tongue for Lebanese food, it is a must try.

I have ordered & been to this place quite a few times. But last day i went I got very offended with the service issue. I ordered chicken doner Kabab & asked to pack it. Seemed fine. But after coming back to when when I unwrapped the burger packet saw then have given shawarma filling inside burger buns. I think they were out of stock in terms of chicken doner Kabab meat but they could have simply told that they don't have that item . Me & my friends felt very cheated for the same. Hope they will maintain their quality & service & wont cheat consumers therefore.

Ordered the Chicken Sub and Alabama Chicken Rice through an online food delivery service. I read the reviews and I was impressed, but, oh-boy was I in for a surprise! The delivery experience was good and on time and everything was properly parcelled, there was no spillage.¬†
Coming to the food.¬†
The sub was cold, like "made a long while back and didn't bother to reheat cold". It tastes good with all the sauce and mayo and stuff, although the amount of raw onion slices could have been less. Overpowers the delicateness of the chicken. Halfway through the sub, I find a chicken feather in my mouth! Yuck! utterly disgusted! Gross negligence!¬†

The Alabama Chicken Rice smelled and tasted heavenly, but the portion was too little for an adult, especially the price they are charging for it! Another disappointment.¬†

Wish I could get a refund or something like that. Waste of money. Not a great experience.

If you're looking for a decent Lebanese food joint which is light on your pocket, this is the best you'll find in the city. I've been here so many times alone and with my friends over the years, that I've lost count. 
It is an easy to find place situated at one corner of the  Lord's junction. However if you're looking for a comfortable place to hang out then you're better off, as the place is very clumsy and not spacious at all! 
When it comes to food, however, you'll get good value for your bucks in quantity.

Last time I've been there was 6th of November and we ordered loads of snacks including chicken shawarma salad which is a must try in here, Lebanese tawook (quite good), mutton shawarma wrap (decent), emu shawarma wrap (the emu was really tough and difficult to chew)! They ran out of all their curries which is a very common problem in here. 

I've tasted their burgers too which are okay and their rice with curry servings are wholesome and not bad at all. They serve their shawarma wraps with a sort of garlic sauce which is rather sweet but goes well with something really spicy. One thing you absolutely shouldn't go for in here are the beverages, it's a horrible waste as it would either be too sweet or too tangy, I've had mango smoothie and mint cooler and was disappointed both times! 
Overall I would say it's a decent satisfactory experience every time as it can always fill up a hungry stomach inexpensively so would definitely keep coming back!

Even not going by the minimal sitting arrangement the place doesnt do the lebanese cuisine any justice. The chicken shawarma was still ok , but the mutton version lacked any taste whatsoever.

This is a small food joint at Lords' crossing. The place is very small and clumsy to be honest , there are few seats which are packed quite close to each other, even the ambience or the decor is pretty generic. The service by the staff is good, they don't delay in taking orders or attending any other matters , nothing to complain over there.
Coming to the main part, the food, it surely does check all the necessary marks of quality, quantity and taste. 
1. Shawarmas - These are big in size and taste absolutely delicious. Definitely try the Jumbo Shawarma which is my favourite.
2. Arabic Biryani - I found thus Biryani quite delicious and somewhat different. It's not something you taste everywhere though the difference is not that big either. My Biryani had boneless pieces of chicken, which is always better,  don't know if it applies for everyone.
3. Beverages - Beverages here are basic and nice, nothing over the top happening in the department. Laban's definitely my favourite out of these and it surely tastes good , definitely try it out if you want.
Overall, this place is definitely recommended just for how good the food is, in terms of ambience, it's a matter of perspective, you might like it , you might not.

These come in myriad forms like shwarma curry and meatballs..we sampled their emu shwarma wrap and the meat had a very strong character.. The taste was awesome and the accompanying pickle was nice... The best thing bout their service was that the pickle was over... They went to their kitchen and made it fresh for us.. Also post completion of the meal they asked us how the meal was... Needless to say our answer was affirmative.. Low on the pocket with multiple payment options like mobikwik and paytm as well.. This place features in the to visit quite regularly for sure :)

Ordered the Arabic Chicken Biryani, Shish Tawook and Chicken shawarma Salad.
The Arabic Chicken Biryani was yum and full of flavour. It came with sweet, minty raita.
The biryani was perfectly cooked and had a generous amount of garnish with nuts and crispy fried onions. 
The Shish Tawook was juicy and perfectly cooked and came with mint chutney. Though quantity of the Shish Tawook was suprisingly less for the price charged the taste summed up for it all.
The Chicken Shawarma Salad, my all time favourite came with pita bread. This salad is a perfect combination of freshness of the mint, the crunch and the crispness of the bell peppers and the tandoori roasted flavour of the chicken. 
My overall experience of ordering from Shawarma Nation was on the better side.
The best thing would be the cordial delivery men.
Can't wait to order again.

The nuggets were ok but the rolls had stale chicken in them. Had started munching suddenly a stale stench invaded our nostrils and we realised that the food was totally inedible. Never gonna order from here again. And request everybody to please check on the condition of the chicken before having it

It's been quite a long time since I have visited this place but fond memories have made me tread back my steps and review it here. This is a tiny place serving humble food to its customers. Lebanese joints are popping up all over Kolkata one by one. This place carved out a nich√© for itself amidst those places.

I had Chicken Shawarma Wrap and Chicken Shawarma Salad here. To be honest, the salad was tad heavier on pungency and wasn't quite pleasant for my personal palate. However, the wrap was something to keep in mind. The tender bits carved from the gyro, tucked inside the wrap with veggies and mayonnaise create a harmonious bang in the mouth.

The place do feel a bit indifferent in terms of ambience. What this calm and cozy joint lacks in the decor department is substituted with flavour!

We ordered the following:
1. Chicken Shawarma Wrap: This place is the best place for Shawarmas. The shawarma tastes really nice and is served with a bit of French fries on the top. It costs Rs 120(tax included). I have tried out their jumbo wrap as well which costs around Rs 140(tax included). It is no way jumbo :p
2. Lebaneh Chicken Burger: I would say that they make good burgers and given the price it's totally worth it. It costs Rs 110( tax included).
3. Chicken Ablama Rice Curry: This dish was being served to people in the other table and we were tempted to order this and was highly disappointed with the quantity. The taste was not extraordinary. The quantity is not even enough for one person for Rs 150( tax included). 
People should definitely try out the wraps here.

On sashti ni8, we had the opportunity to taste some lebanese food in SHAWARMANATION which is near her house, before seeing off her.. We ordered 1 jumbo chicken shawarma & grilled chicken shawarma accompanied with laban.. We didn' t find the taste of the food much delicious, it was a normal treat, but have to mention the taste of the mint-laban was outstanding, we both liked it a much.. The decor & ambience is quite normal with only 8-10 people accomodation. The price is a bit more compare to the taste..

Ordered Chicken Shawarma Wrap from this place. Service was prompt. The Shawarma was well packed and tasted pretty good.

They should start allowing customers to customize their shawarmas like 'Build your own Sub' by Subway.

The first thing that one will feel that inspite of its miniature dimensions.. the interior designing is compact with smart seating solutions. Maximum can seat upto 10 customers at once. Take away is a better choice. Coming to the food, quality and pricing equals that of the other slightly exquisite for chain joints like wow momo.! , Wall Express, Go Lebanese etc. Limited but well selected menu. Definitely a try if you're alone or with one or two others for a heavy snack or light meal when you're not willing to go to traditional restaurant.

Never, EVER order food from here online. They took an unbelievably long time ( read 1 hour ) to prepare a simple chicken shawarma wrap. And then they cancelled my order due to unavailability of delivery boys. What's the point in making your customers starve? Just let me know if you can't provide the item! Disgusted by this.

Dropped in with my friend sometime back. She had suggested this place to me and my experience here was good. You can not only choose from their menu but also make changes according to your preference. I wanted my food to be a little spicy and they worked accordingly. I had the mutton wrap there which was great. The chicken shawarma wrap was a non spicy one but enough creamy to win my heart.
The staff is well behaved and they have hand sanitizers at each table. That's not what I see at many places.
Overall it is nice for a quick bite. :)

Shawarma nation -what to say about theseüòägood food joint, in lords more. It's a small joint for shawarma lovers food quality average, we tried
‚úîChicken shawarma salad- it's a mixture of tomato cucumber cilantro chicken mayo cheese and 4olives. 2.5/5
‚úîAblama rice curry-normal rice colured in yellow, chicken curry is awsome, boneless chicken they will serve topped with barista... Quiet good. 4/5
Now the main part,  yar sitting arrangement sahi karo yar shawarma nation, if u are reading this kindly chnage ur seating arrangement atleast the green tool is too short and so clumsy make it bit high and make it comfortable... If siiting artngment is not good how can people enjoy the food. 
Overall had a good time food quality is good 
Seating arrangement is not good at all.

Shawarma Nation, loacted at Lord's crossing, is a place that offers you a variety of Lebanese dishes. I have ordered food from this restaurant several times. What I particularly like about this restaurant is the fact that they provide delicious food within an affordable range.
My favorite dishes from Shawarma Nation are crispy baby corn and Lebanese fried chicken. Tried their rice dishes a couple of times. Their biriyani tastes average unlike their mouthwatering wraps. Recently they have introduced exotic meat preparations like Turkey and Emu. I've tasted their Turkey kebab earlier and am hoping to try out other exotic meat dishes in future!

A perfect combo of well cooked spicy chicken dipped with hummus and cheese (probably), wrapped with pita bread... it was really amazing. The mango smoothie was just awesome. I will surely visit again.

If you are Chicken lover and only a lot of chicken can appease your chicken lust this is your dream destination. This outlet is a paradise for non veg lovers especially for those who love chicken. Do try the Ch Shawarma Roll, apart from being a chicken lover's treat is pocket friendly and wholesome. 1 shawarma roll will cost you 110 (approximately including taxes) which is enough for 1 person.

Shawarma Nation! Well I had huge expectations from this place but not every dish on the menu was good. Chicken Shawarma gets 5/5 from me. This is the only thing here that'll make you want to lick your fingers! Chicken Mussakhan Shawarma gets 2/5.
The Mint Cooler gets 5/5 again.
Chicken Arabic Biryani gets 3.5/5 from me.. Also,the Raita was really yummy.
Chicken Bagdadi Rice Curry gets 4/5. 
There's only one guy serving everybody here and his behaviour is really decent. This place is super pocket friendly too! Things are really cheap here.
So this is definitely a place you should visit but be careful about what you order because not every item on the menu is worth ordering.

Being a rookie at Lebanese food I had to idea what I should have expected from this joint. My friend recommended me to try the honey chicken shawarma wrap while he took the jumbo chicken wrap and boy was it good!! The wrap was full of chicken mayo and fries all of which complemented each other. Along with the wrap they serve a pudina chutney which is not only delicious but also refreshes the taste buds. It is really filling and easy on the pocket too as the place charges no vat or service tax! The service too is quick and the place is air conditioner. The only negative aspect of this place is that it's quite small and can't accommodate more than 8-10 people at a time. However it is definitely a place I would visit again!!

Best shawarma maker in the city. Hands down. There are other outlets in the city but this one always makes the perfect combination of salad, mayo, chicken. Absolutely mouth watering. Definitely try the mint cooler. Goes best with salad and the wrap. But the place is a too small. You can hangout with maximum of 10 friends inside and the place would be fully packed. It would have been pitch perfect if it were a little bigger.

I had combo of shawarma roll and mint cooler.

An authentic shawarma roll has a very thin base (wonton sheets can also be used) n you add a mixture of cream mayonnaise pepper n salt as the main sauce. 

shawarma nation had none of the above. The base was very thick and it had a very different, not very nice tasting white sauce.

It was an okay roll... but not a nice shawarma roll. I was expecting an authentic shawarma roll.

The mint cooler was nice though.

Well the list of items keeps adding up as I go there quiet often once it got established in Lords more after the one it was already there in South City. The place is a bit small, but has enough room for people to grab some grub. Some of my favourites over there which are almost common are, the Chicken Shawarma Wrap, Lebaneh Burger (either of the two is enough to make you full), the Arabic Chicken Biriyani was so damn good and its served with raita (mix of curd and crunchy vegies lyk onions, cucumbers and added pepper) and coriander chutney and also you get nice juicy pieces of chicken (probably 4 pcs). The pita with chicken shawarma salad is lip smacking good if you dont want to get into wraps, you can try the mutton shawarma wrap, but could have been better as the stuffings is not at all like the chicken wrap. Mint Cooler again a refresher if you are traveling a lot and wanna quench your thirst.
So, overall the place can be tidied a bit so as to go with the looks, the service is indeed good and the people are humble to suggest you good food items!

I have ordered takeaway from Shawarma Nation quite a few times and they never take more than 5 minutes to pack the order. Recently I used their home delivery service which is flawless. The order was delivered before the expected time and there were no extra packing charges. The price of the food items offered here are quite good. As the name goes , this place is for shawarma rolls. That's their speciality . They do have other offerings like sandwiches and burgers which I haven't tried as yet. Although I can say without a hint of doubt that this place offers one of the best shawarma rolls in the city. I often prefer to have their chicken shawarma rolls or jumbo chicken shawarma rolls over the oily parantha rolls served at most roll shops.

The chicken shawarma roll has smoked chicken slices , hummus, a few french fries and grilled vegetables wrapped in pita bread and drizzled with more hummus . The jumbo chicken shawarma roll is not bigger in size . It just has a but more filling a inside the roll. It's an absolute hit for me. Do give it a try . It's a healthier ,more filling and tastier alternative .

The order which consisted of a single item was delivered after 90 mins, whereas maximum delivery time was being shown as 45 mins. Moreover when I called up the restaurant after waiting for an hour, they said the delivery executive had long left. But when the delivery executive arrived after another 20mins he said he had left only 10mins before, so someone must have been lying.

This is a small Lebanese joint situated near Lords More. I have visited this place many times and have been satisfied with the food they provide.

AMBIENCE / DECOR - There is not much going on with the decor. They have small tables and can accommodate around 10-12 people at a time.

FOOD - I have tried their chicken shawarma wraps, chicken shawarma salad with pita, oriental salad with pita, Chicken Ablama rice, Barbeque chicken. The taste of each and every dish is on point. Quantity of dishes like Chicken Ablama rice , oriental salad could be more generous but they don't compromise with quality.

SERVICE - The service is tad bit slow but the waiters are well behaved.

POCKET PINCH- This place is easy on the pocket. You get to have tasty Lebanese food without spending much.

Ordered a Chicken Shawarma Wrap & Fried Chicken yesterday afternoon from the nearby outlet of Shawarma Nation. Delivery took around 40 minutes.

I know that shawarma wrap is very popular here, it was good, I would have liked a larger chicken to salad & mayonnaise ratio! Rating - 3.3/5

That fried chicken was delicious, it was hot & crispy.I liked it with sauce. Rating - 3.7/5

I think it is a good one for quick bites at reasonable price.

This is great Lebanese food joint, near my home. Their food is fresh and tastes freaking awesome. Ordered online from through Zomato for the first time. I must say the service was top notch. Food was delivered before expected delivery time. And the food quality was great too.
It's well worth regular visits and orders. Its a small joint, located beside Sugar n Spice at Lords More. Thumbs up to you guys.

I've had the shawarma quite a few times.
Really very good.
The meat is very tender.
Recently, I tried out their Arabian Chicken Biryani.
It was full of dry fruits.
When you're a Bangal, you get appealed by spicy food like nothing else.
Stood out on my expectations.
The meat was tender and the rice was well cooked.
Overall:4/5

Tried their Jumbo Chicken Shawarma wrap. Nothing out of the world to go gaga about. The ambience and the sitting arramgements are not exactly comfortable. The crowd is mostly boisterous with little manners and constantlh yelling over their fones. Not an overall pleasant experience,  neither with the food nor ambience. Avoidable.

Well I had heard a lot about this place and thought of trying out at this place after being a little apprehensive about the Shawarmas here. I am a big fan of Go Lebanese ¬†so trying here was a little out of my own favourite zone. However it did not really come up to my expectations. Why? No I am not being biased at all but the mayonnaise was grainy. I do not know why and the wrap was also too crumbly. If the major two important factors fall apart the main thing would not taste as good as it should taste. Here I was a little disappointed. ¬†This ismainly a take away corner ¬†with a small seating area inside ¬†but incidentally ¬†their packaging was nice. ¬†Th e filling was good. They have few more items on their menu. Convenient to locate and more or less pocket friendly. ¬†I hope next time will be ¬†a much better experience for me.

Wanted to try Lebanese food for a long time. I love wraps and mayonnaise. So i have tried chicken shawarma wraps. It was not so tasty but that was full of mayonnaise and I was too hungry. Its a take away counter basically. But there was some chairs and 2/3 tables. So you can enjoy your food there and dont need to pay any vat or tax.

The place is well made with optimal utilization of space, but the position for their air conditioning machine is not correct since most of the customers at one side of the seating area do not get the cooling air. The food was being served on time and I really liked their sense of presenting the dish. We ordered for salad and sish kebab which tasted nice and mint cool beverage was not a disappoint at all. Staff were well behaved and constantly remind you about their days highlight to order. I also liked their concept of keeping a Dettol hand sanitizer at every table. This is something important and unique I found.

Meals are pocket friendly and they have large spread of quick bites to choose from. This place serves one of the best shawarma in the city. You are bound flow in the flood of shredded chicken, the bread so soft with all the mayo ooze. You gotta definitely visit and try out the rolls even the salads.

Staffs are friendly and nice. Service is not so fast. The food is so palatable that you will end up licking your fingers.

Wanted to try Lebanese food for a long time having heard from several people about how they were absolutely in love with shawarma and how Lebanese was their favourite cuisine.But after my first experience with Lebanese food,I doubt if I would ever try it again.I tried their Chicken cheese shawarma wrap and Shish tawook.The shawarma had such excessive amounts of mayonnaise that it made me feel nauseous and I could not even finish it.The shish tawook looked delicious but I did not like its taste.Would prefer North Indian kebabs over this any day! Service was decent but felt my 200bucks gone into waste.The shawarma is seriously not recommended for people who don't like mayonnaise.

Visited this place thrice. It's located in the Lords Junction, Prince Anwar Shah road.Tried many wraps and also quick bites and burgers...

Wraps-
CHICKEN SHAWARMA WRAP:
 Although this particular item is the most popular but I found it too overrated. Firstly the mayonnaise is too heavy and dense.They should seriously reduce the amount of mayonnaise as that made it too messy and reduced the original taste. Every bite was filled with thick mayonnaise and it was seriously irritating! NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED!

CHICKEN MUSAKKAN WRAP:
This wrap was filled with chicken and veggies like tomatoes and onions mainly,dressed in a tangy dense sauce. It's very spicy and I'm sure anyone will like it. It was really yummy.

ORIENTAL CHICKEN WRAP: 
This is the best among all the wraps with the right proportion of spiciness and tanginess. You must try this one if not anything else. Anybody visiting Shawarma Nation..I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND, do have this one.Its just awesomely tasty. I never felt bored with it and liked it till the last bite, almost wanting to order another.

GRILLED CHICKEN WRAP- This was quite nice, between musakkan and oriental wrap in taste. It had tomato,capsicum and lettuce along with grilled chicken.  It's not that spicy. 

Quick Bites -
FRENCH FRIES:
They were as usual very crispy and delicious costing the least under quick bites section.

SHISH TAWOOK:
It's basically chicken kebab (lebanese style) consisting of 10 pcs served along with 8 pita bread slices. It tasted kinda just above average not THAT good. If you must try kebabs try North Indian ones. But well you can still try if you want. 

Burgers-
LEBANEH CHICKEN BURGER: I actually more than hated it. I repeat, I HATED it. The Lebanese tikki inside didn't appeal to me at all! I had to literally dunk it in sauce and have it. No wonder, I am not trying this ever again. 

Service-4/5
Price-4/5
Ambience-3.5/5 (They should seriously expand. It just consists of 5 small tables) 
I'm visiting this place again definitely for the delicious wraps!
EDIT- Now tax is charged. Menu prices,however, are inclusive of taxes.

Their Shawarma salad is absolutely amazing.Best in town in fact.Plus their pita bread is really nice and thin so it complements the shawarma well. Even when you have the wrap the pita bread isn't overwhelming. The sauces are the real hero in this dish. Also the drinks which they serve are pretty refreshing.

I had ordered food from Shawarma Nation via Swiggy and hence this review would not be dealing with the location and the ambience of the outlet. The food that I received against my order was decent and subtle. The harissa and paneer wrap that I had ordered was supposed to be spicy but it can in rather plain and a little on the tasteless side. Unfortunately the side dish ordered along with the wrap was equally unsatisfactory.

I mainly order shawarma salad and shawarma rolls...I have tried other things in their menu too viz. their burger n dumplings...but I think shawarma salad is the best n I'll definitely go again and again!!:)

I have some beautiful memories of college life attached to this little place on Lord's More. When they first opened, their service was shaky and I had to wait for long if I didn't order a shawarma. But the taste that ensued was heavenly. Some say they put in too much onion, but it's fine for me. 

My favourite dishes here are the chicken shawarma and the egg submarine. I have tried half the menu and it has always been a decent presentation. It's always good to be here.

They deserve a minimum rating of 4.5
Ratings given by Zomato to a restaurant is not the addition of ratings divided by the total number of ratings.The system therefore is confusing.Whatever Zomato says,are the sole Rules.
But nevertheless,Shawarma Nation deserves all the credits.The staffs have get used to of my tastebuds because of almost regular visits for the last 5years.They are really helpfull.
Sitting area is small though.Otherwise,no complains.
And the taste of the Chicken they prepare is just awesome.Today,tried Mutton Cheese Shawarma Wrap and Jumbo Chicken Shawarma Wrap as usual.The mutton was of Keema and its was really great.
Garlic Mayo tastes like heaven.Keep the good work going.

This gem of a restaurant is located in the Lake Gardens more which is customarily called the Lord's more. Don't get deceived by the small and unappealing appearance because the food they serve is delectable. The Lebanese food they serve has an Indian touch to it and the Indo-Lebanese fusion is simply great.
We had ordered Chicken Mussakhan Wrap and Jumbo Chicken Wrap. This was the first time I tried a shawarma wrap and I loved it. My friends told me that the shawarmas available here are a little different from the ones we get at other food joints. 

Chicken Mussakhan Wrap: This wrap was a spicy and tangy shawarma, medium in size with ample of vegetables and moderate amount of chicken pieces.

Jumbo Chicken Shawarma Wrap: This was relatively less spicy and more tangy. The wrap was huge with adequate stuffing.

The starter we had ordered was some sort of kebab that was a new introduction. It tasted great too. All the three items that we had tried are recommended by me. Do give them a try.

The only complaint one might have is the seating area is a little congested. But the food they serve makes up for that shortcoming. The chicken content in the wraps was a little less according to me. They can improve on that. A great food joint which is very pocket friendly as well. I would like to visit this place again and try their other items.

We ordered 3 items and all 3 tasted great!!
Chicken Mussakhan wrap and Jumbo Chicken shawarma wrap were both shawarma wraps but tasted a little different...while the Jumbo chicken shawarma wrap was too filling and tasted like the normal shawarma but a little more tangy,the Mussakhan wrap was a spicier tangier chatpata version of the regular shawarma!The sauce made The taste go to an entirely new level! The starter too tasted lipsmacking!!
All in all I am highly impressed with their take on shawarmas... However the quantity of chicken inside the shawarma wraps could be improved! Nevertheless it's a must try food joint!

I have lost count of the times I have dropped by in this place. The delicious shawarma wrap they provide at such an affordable rate is one of the main reasons I was a regular at this place whenever I was starving and had to economically satiate my hunger - so much so that the staff would offer me a most welcoming smile on every visit! Tucked away at the corner of Lord's More, this little Shawarma outlet provides one of the best wraps I have had around the city. The huge chunks of chicken with the right amount of mayo makes it a well-preserved wrap by all standards. However, truth be told, the other things on offer aren't as good - the Arabian Biriyani is an experimental dish, but it doesn't at all suit my taste. The refreshments they have are pretty  average too (I am not aware if they have become better now). Some of their snacks are worth a try though. The good part is that the prices are tax inclusive and the staffs are extremely polite and eager to help you out. The service is a little slow, so you can sway your head to some of the songs while you wait on your food, or watch on as your food is being prepared.

Pocket friendly. Good to go. A bit small in size but the food is not that bad. I've had jumbo chicken shawarma wrap and Leboneh Chicken burger. Both were average. Still if you ever visit this place, I would recommend you to try the chicken burger rather than ordering the shawarma wrap. Only the best part is that the prices you see are all inclusive tax.

This joint is quite an easy find. Seating can be problematic. Quantity was ample. Better service was expected. Had jumbo chicken shwarma wrap and salad. French fries were smelly to be honest. Others claimed that too. That caused minimal damages to the tastebuds. Shwarma salad was exceptionally good.
They do not accept mobile wallet. That was a disappointment.
Experience, though not outstanding or perfect, i'd like to visit again for delicious evening snacks.

Shawarma Nation - A lebanese world where you ll get shawarma lebanese styled rolls beautifully served with salads . Presentation of the plate is attractive. The chicken inside it tastes exceptional and amazing.
The drawbacks here is that : This place is a bit conjusted but good for couple or group of 2 3 friends.. 
Secondly, The shawarma roll which they serve is served cold. !
Other than the above two drawback the place is undoubtedly amazing and worth eating.

Located near Lord's More crossing... visited here last month and simply loved the Arabic Biryani...Though I have earlier tasted the Shawarma Wraps for Chicken & Mutton both...But quantity wise I found it to be less while serving the Biryani.The behavior of the staff is very warm & cordial. So when mouses are running inside your stomach & you happen to be near Prince Anwar Shah Road, this is always a better option rather than having roadside fast food. Spend 100-150 bucks & fill up your stomach in quick time.Cheers...!!!

Visited many times before but writing a review for the first time. The joint is very small compared to others places but the service and quality is crisp. Had chicken cheese shawarma wrap, chicken shawarma salaad and fish fillet wrap. The cheese filled wrap is just a delight to have. And shawarma salaad is just as classic as you can get. But i am really disappointed with fish fillet wrap. It just seemed like chichen roll wraped in pita bread. But as always i am and will be a fan of Shawarma.
They should think of expanding the place a bit as it gets congested very easily. Else its was a good experience just as before.

Shawarma!! The name was unknown to me before a month back. But now it is included in the list of my fav dishes. Yess. The shawarma roll is totally too good n damn tasty and full with chicken n maoniz and lots of vegetables. If anyone tastes it for once thn definitely he or she will b impressed by it's taste. Shawarma nation is famous only for shawarma dishes. We went there and ordered the jumbo shawarma wrap. And it was awsm and delicious. I want to visit it again to taste all the other items very soon. ‚ò∫

Prince anwar sah road....small sitting place...but if i wrote this review after my 9 th visit then i give them 3.5 or 4 rating...but now I m give them just 2....just because they serve us a under cooked chicken curry....in chicken Alabama platter... After we mention it...they give a useless excuse... That they didn't know anything... The food was prepared but their company kitchen.. Bla bla bla...not only that...they served stinky chicken chunks.. In shawarma....so please... If u have leftovers.. Throughout those crap... We are spend money for fresh food....I enclosed...

Located at the corner of Lords, this is one of the best outlet to try for lebanese food at reasonable rates., but service is very very slow. Apart from Shawarma roll, i would recommend to try out their Arabian Biriyani which is quiet healthy with less oil.

What used to be one of the favorite Shawarma joints in the town once upon a time is just another outlet serving shawarma. This place started off really well with hearty Lebanese food at affordable prices but in course of time the quality of food and taste had fallen below par unable to maintain its Constancy. Although it doesn't fail to fulfill one's hunger, so that's a plus point.
Looking forward to better services and food quality on my next visit.

Theirs is a tiny food joint located near Lord's more in Lake Gardens. My sis and I dropped in for a quick meal today(11.10.2016). The space was very small. There were people waiting outside. Luckily we got seats immediately as they only had 2seats free at the moment. We ordered Jumbo Chicken Shwarma Wrap and Pita with Oriental Chicken Salad and mineral water. Our food was served without much delay. The staffs were pretty quick and efficient. Coming to the food, the Chicken Shwarma wrap was lip-smacking. There was oodles of mayo in it with good portions of other Chicken pieces and veggies. I especially loved the tanginess of the capsicum. It went pretty well with the heaviness of the mayo. But I thought the Oriental Chicken Salad was the best. The Chicken pieces were perfectly cooked and were delicious. The salad had loads of veggies that seems to be synonymous with the Lebanese cuisine. But what impressed me the most was the orange and yellow sauces. I loved their spiciness and tanginess. It meshed pretty well with the Chicken and the veggies. The reasonable prices make it possible for one to have full stomach on a small budget. Lebanese cuisine seems to be in vogue now because of Shwarma Nation and they really live up to their name with awesome mouth-watering food.
P.S. The prices have been changed. They need to update their menu on Zomato.
P.P.S. They don't charge tax.

This outlet can be located easily,being located at Lord's more. The place is small and can accommodate few. But nevertheless the food is fresh and tasty. The quality has improved a lot.

What we ordered :
Regular chicken shawarma wrap.
Jumbo chicken shawarma wrap.
Kiwi smoothie.
Harissa Paneer burger.
Mint Cooler.

It would be best if you take-away the food or come in a small group because of the accommodation.

I have been here few months ago with a friend , ordered a jumbo chicken shawarma , chicken submarine and chicken burger. They served the food fast one by one. ¬†After looking all those food in the table i thought it was a big mistake to order 3 dishes for two people, one dish is enough for one person. It was the first time in this place, so didn't expect one dish will be enough for one. Jumbo chicken shawarma, chicken submarine were just superb. There was french fries in the jumbo shawarma. But chicken burger wasn't that much good compared to other dishes, but i wont say it was bad, it was good, but other two dishes was just freaking awesome.The inner filling was soft and there is ¬†chicken mayonnaise along with the lettuce, cucumbers, onions .¬†Seating place is available but small, but the place is nice. Overall the place and the food is awesome. Though they rise the price recently. Previous price was better but still its affordable and stop reading more reviews , just go there and eat a jumbo chicken shawarma , its a finger licking good. Attention foodies , you will need a lot of tissue if you eat in this place.

The food here is very good. I am a regular visitor to this place. The musakkhan wrap is a real treat and better than the original shawarma wrap. Today I had a new dish, Lebanese tawook. It serves 10 pieces of soft and juicy boneless grilled chicken along with pita bread. It was well-cooked and spiced up to the right level. Definitely, this dish increased my chances of visiting this place again! The only negative point is that the place is too small, with hardly 5 tables and it becomes over-crowded in the evenings.

So this ain't my first visit but nevertheless it's my first review of the eatery known as the Shawarma Nation.Situated right around the corner of Lake Gardens-->Golf Green junction,its a small place with both takeaway and Sit n' Dine capabilities.4 tables inside with overall sitting capacity of 20 if we count the chairs on the pavement outside the store.There is a television 20" approx.Surprisingly Gordon Ramsay was cooking with his family at home on the show when I walked in.I had a friend waiting inside ready to greet me.He had already ordered a wrap contain honey chicken and loads of Mayonnaise dripping out.I on the other hand intended to go for quick bites as they call it.The attendant suggested I go with Lebaneh Fried Chicken.I decided to give it a shot.Before I criticize the chicken I want you to know the wrap was more on the sweet side. So after every other table got served and after a couple of nudges,I got served too.Meanwhile two nicely dressed Asian women sat beside us enjoying burgers and mint cooler,specifics unknown, but those burgers had chicken fillings too.The relevance of their presence will be justified towards the end of my experience.Back to my plate, which now had two chicken legs of acceptable portions dipped in batter and deep fried to crisp.Now to elaborate further the crisp was specific to the wrapper that covered the chicken and not the chicken itself.When I took my first bite I was barely able to hold on to the chicken drumsticks,it was piping hot but shockingly the insides as in the flesh was rather cold. My friend also reached the same conclusion when he bit into the other piece.I was disappointed.They charged 90 rupees a piece and 160 if you go for full plate as in 2 pieces.Frankly KFC costs easy on the pocket and does the better and faster job.Now they happen to be kind enough to ask for feedback.My reply was brutally honest.My Asian neighbours found my feedback accurate and agreed to the same conclusion as far as the crux of their Burgers were concerned.So guys from the store,if you are reading this,its high time you start cooking you frozen chicken properly,watch YouTube if you don't know how,I am sure Gordon Ramsay must have a video or two on the internet about this.Take this as an opportunity of improvement and not a matter of shame.Food is holy hence do not treat it otherwise.

Located on the crossing between Prince Anwarshah road and golf green road better known as the Lord's more, this place attracts people because of its plush location. It used to be strictly takeaway earlier, now they have a seating arrangement for 10 or so. Tidy place for having a bite of their delicacies. Quality wise, their shawarma is good but what they apart from meat is so much that you tend to lose the taste of meat in your mouth. And they are getting pricier by the day. So yeah there are better places for a Shawarma craving. Come here if you happen to be here and are hungry or otherwise give it a miss.

So my experience here was okayish as I'm a vegetarian and I ordered for harissa paneer wrap and a mint cooler combo.. the mint cool was nice and refreshing but the wrap was nowhere near what real lebanese food is! It was overly sweet and tasted of tomato sauce.. I could see the staffs efforts to make It tasty but it was just like any other wrap.. albeit the staff is courteous!

"Chicken shawarma wrap", one of the famous dish in this shop. The shop is located just in Lords More. The shop is very small hardly 8-10 people can sit and mostly it is for take aways, the quality they serves is very good and the quantity is absolutely good and the price is also reasonable. A perfect place to visit with friends. I just loved this place. :) :)

The first time I had tried Lebanese food, I instantly fell in love. ¬†Heard of Shawarma Nation a lot but never tried it before. So we gave it a try.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: Very small area providing a seating for hardly 6-8 people. Plays nice music. Service was good.

FOOD: Ordered for Chicken Shawarma Wrap & Chicken Mussakhan Wrap with French Fires.
Chicken Shawarma was okay. The white creamy stuff was not evenly distributed and there wasn't enough amount of it (which being my favourite part with the Pita bread). The Chicken Mussakhan Wrap was good. The grilled chunks of chicken were soft & juicy.

Going back to try the Baba Ghanouj, Falafel, salads and the Arabian Rice Specials.

Hands down the best lebanese food joint I've ever visited. Food is just awesome. From the traditional Hummus or Babaganoush to French Fries or Chelo Kebab, everything is just lip smacking. Definitely value for money. The wraps are just heavenly. Biryani that they serve is unlike the regular ones that we have but is surely, interestingly good with a different twist. Food is wholesome and portions served are plentiful. The menu  sports an array of delicacies for a quick bite or combo meals fit for a heavy meal. The Shish Tawook ( chicken shish  kebabs grilled in Mid-Eastern style served with pita bread) is a must have. Wash it down with a refreshing glass of Lemon & Mint cooler or Laban. Absolutely heart filling. 

PROS:- Healthy food. Heavy portions. Definitely tasty. Quick Service.

CONS:- Low seating capacity. Not open before mid-day. A bit congested.

I am shawarma lover and i had to visit this place. Last monday i had visited this place during the evening time and it was almost empty . With shawarma being the sole speciality of this place i ordered shawarma chicken wrap and it tasted heavenly. The only drawback of this place is that it cannot accomodate too many people . Other than that everythng is good :-)

While coming back from South City, my cousin dropped into this outlet and packed stuff for me back home. So delighted! 

I have no idea about this outlet as I have never visited this one, though I've heard that this is more spacious that the Sarat Bose Road one. Anyway going directly to the food.

My cousin being a glutton packed 2 jumbo chicken shawarma and one regular chicken shawarma for the two of us. Needless to say, by the end of the jumbo one, we were struggling to finish the regular wrap which was divided between us. 
The best thing about the wraps - the sour cream oozing out on the top. Aah! I'm salivating already. 
There was huge amount of chicken stuffing and it tasted really really good with generous amounts of tomato and capsicum.
The regular shawarma wrap was just a tad bit smaller in size than the jumbo one. 
After this amazingly tasty and sumptuous meal, I'm afraid that I won't be able to move! :P

Pocket pinch - a meagre 333 bucks. So very glad that I could sort out my dinner with just 167 bucks! :P

Located in a convenient crossing at Lord‚Äôs More, I visited this place with a couple of friends for an evening snack. It was my first go at Lebanese food, we ordered the Chicken Shawarma Wrap and Falafel Wrap. The food was served quick and the food was good quality, juicy with a good amount of sauce & mayo. But the size of the wrap wasn‚Äôt big enough! I mean, if I am paying 100 bucks for a wrap, I expect a decent size which keeps me full for a couple of hours atleast! In the falafel wrap, the stuffings were served first and falafel was served after we had already completed half the meal, so a big minus on that front! This place is one of initial Lebanese places in the city, so it has good footfall but it can certainly increase a few chinks, say, by increasing the price to quantity ratio.

I have been ordering food from here as well as the Sarat Bose outlet quite frequently through Swiggy until yesterday, when I visited the place for a takeaway.

Though, I did not have the luxury to sit inside the small eatery. But I did notice, that it was a small place, able to fit enough around 12-15 people at once. This place offers an array of Lebanese delicacies, with most of them hitting the sweet spot with the consumers.

Needless, to say, Shawarma sells like hot cakes in here. So, I went for Honey Chicken Shawarma Wrap and Shish Tauok in Arabic Spices which is basically grilled steak chicken marinated in Arabic Spices.

Now, I loved the Honey Chicken Shawarma Wrap. The Honey element brought a completely different dimension to the Shawarma and it left my taste buds wanting for more. I have had Shawarma before, and I have found it to be filled with loads of mayo. This just had the right amount of mayo. It wasn't heavy at all. And at the end, I was left wanting for more.

Similarly, the Shish Tauok, satisfied my taste buds. Chicken was pretty well marinated and the it was soft and juicy from the get go. They serve it along with pita bread and chutney.

Earlier, I had the luxury of having Arabic Chicken Biryani. Yes, they don't serve alu with it. But it's pretty decent. They do, offer complimentary raita which is a bit sweet, to my taste.

Service was pretty swift. I did not have to wait long for my order. Definitely, a place, which I would visit once again.

The Shawarma Nation is of the best food outlets present there that serves Lebanese eatables. This place is perfect for you if you often drool for soothing your taste buds with Lebanese items. The Chicken Shawarma Wrap is stands out for me as it contains enough mayo, veggies, french fries and of course chicken. The wrap itself is huge and it will definitely please your tummy. The ambience is fair and the food served somewhat goes with the stipulated price as well. So if you are a foodie like me it is definitely the place for you to hop in.

A nice place to grab a bite on the go. There are sitting arrangements, however the sitting area is very small. The Chicken shawarma and the chicken cheese shawarma are delicious and filling. The Shish tawook is a bit different in taste however the flavour is nice. The Lebanese yogurt based drink is not available most of the times though.

The Jumbo Shawarma wrap is stuffed with veggies and succulent pieces of roasted chicken . The pita bread is soft and the wrap comes with pickled cucumber , french fries , all making the food more interesting . Paid 120 bucks and it was  worth it . This Shawarma joint totally lives up to it's reputation .

So finally a place dedicated to shawarma rolls and salads.
If you're near the lords crossing, your eyes are bound to fall on this small eatery.
The interior was clean. A little congested and could accommodate a very few people.
I ordered the classic chicken shawarma wrap from their wide variety of wraps¬† and salads. It was yum.
I'll turn in again for trying out their different wraps

Worst shawarma ever.. These people need good Lebanese cooking training very badly. The shawarma is bad..the chicken is not smoked enough and one needs to understand that a gallop of mayonnaise over the wrap doesn't do justice at all.

This is the place to be when you have a craving for lebanese and short on money. Visited multiple times with friends and always end up having jumbo shawarma wrap. It never disappoints. The rs. 15 extra mayo is another reason to visit this place. It literally melts in mouth and gives a feeling of honey. Sitting area is small but service is good. Must visit.

This outlet located bang on Lords more and quite a popular one...
They give a tough competition to the other food joints in that area...
Tried their Chicken Shawarma Wrap and Pita Chicken Shawarma salad and impressed with both of them...Both the items were worth money...
They even have a small seating arrangement inside with a capacity of 8-10 heads...
Staff were pretty good and always treat you with a smile...

This outlet can be easily located near Lord's more. We ordered the Cheese chicken shawarma wrap and the Mutton shawarma wrap. Thoroughly enjoyed the Cheese chicken shawarma wrap but the mutton shawarma wrap was a big letdown. It nearly took around 25-30 mins to serve the Mutton wrap and the  meat itself was not properly grilled. It was a huge disappointment. 

Previously I had the Jumbo chicken shawarma wrap and undoubtedly is the best dish/wrap of this restaurant. They really need to work on the service otherwise it's a very pocketfriendly food joint.

Shawarma Nation is one of the newer additions to the Lords Bakery food scene. The place serves decent fair of Lebanese items, with most of them hitting the right spot with the consumers. Without a doubt the, the shawarmas are the highest grossing item our here, yet somehow I have managed to love the shawarma salad more. The dressing is amazingly nice and lifts the salad to a whole new level. That slight hint of the honey mustard in the mayo will make you go back for more. The shawarma is decent, so is the Chicken Mussakhan Wrap. The Mint cooler that they serve as a part of the combos is quite nice and refreshing.

One of the complaints I have is regarding the service. Shawarma nation which mainly acts as a takeaway counter, with very limited seating options, really needs to incorporate the speed that a take away counter should have in its service.

Another issue is with the Lebanese fried chicken. The picture of the fried chicken on swiggy is quite different from the real deal. The one on swiggy looks like a southern fried chicken tossed in middle eastern spices, while what I was served in the eatery, looked more like a chicken marinated in spices and grilled. I have no clue if the picture on swiggy is correct and I was served something wrong, or vice versa.

This is a cramped up place where you need to share tables with strangers. So, dining in is a complete 'no'. The place makes shawarma wraps and is ideal for take aways. The rolls are wrapped with a generous amount of white mayonnaise. While a lot of people might feel very happy about this, I like my shawarma wrapped with minimal mayo. The meat lacks the taste of traditional Turkish/Greek/Arabian kebab, and this is true for all shawarma eateries in town. But I guess this is a well thought improvisation of recipe to cater the chicken roll set taste buds of Kolkatans. In my personal opinion, I do not find this place tempting enough.

I have been having shwarma cravings for the past two weeks. Finally, I had it today at this outlet of Shwarma Nation. 'Shwarma Nation' has become very popular in South Kolkata because of their delicious Lebanese food items. This outlet is their main outlet. I went there around 6 pm. They have seating arrangements which can accommodate a crowd of maximum of twelve to fifteen persons. I ordered their Jumbo chicken shwarma wrap. The food arrived within ten minutes. The pita bread was large and it was filled with roasted chicken, veggies, mayonnaise. The size was humongous. It was delicious. One Jumbo Shwarma Wrap can easily satisfy your hunger. The staff was very well-behaved. I will definitely be visiting again.

A small food joint on the Lords More of Prince Anwar Shah Road.We had ordered Chicken Shawarma which was indeed very tasty,overflowing with mayoneese but that dud not taste bad. The wrap was moderate in size.Their Jumbo wrap is the larger version of the shawarma and its better to order that.
They have a very small airconditoned sitting space inside.The service was also fast.
No taxes. TAKE away available

Shwarma Nation is the place where you will get the best shwarmas in town. Situated right at the crossing of Lord's more, I go there often whenever I am in South City Mall and want a quick bite, I walk straight upto the place.

The place is small but comfortable and you can see the kitchen through the glass which separates it. The shwarma was great; it was full of chicken, vegetables and mayonnaise, and the pita bread was also very soft. Will definitely go there again.

My go to place for Lebanese food. Simply love this joint. Have tried almost all the items on the menu, apart from veg stuff, which I'm not particularly fond of. From tawook to salad to wrap everything tastes good. And the quantity is just bonkers, everything is just XL over here, very American i must say. Only gripe is the place is rather small.
Recommended place.

Located on lords more, this joint defines BIG. Thats because their jumbo shawarma can keep you full for a day. Apart from the shawarma, they also serve lebanese speciality kebabs, also known as tawook and burgers and biryani. Keep in mind that it does get crowded at times as the place is small.

Coming to the food it is nice and crisp but their are scope of improvement as they serve Lebanese they need to be much care full about the serving temperatures and the accompaniments as the shawarma wrap is never rolled with mayo rather it is done with tahini and if you are using mayo go for a home made one!!for the non veg option
Hope to see improvements soon

Situated at a very smart location,the Lords crossing, Shawarma Nation has grabbed the attention of food lovers in South Kolkata. I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing Lebanese food before, so I would refrain from commenting on the authenticity of the cuisine and simply document my experience here.
I visited this place with a colleague for lunch. It's very small joint, can hardly fit 12-14 people, but it's very clean with modern decor. However one must never judge a book by its cover. It's extremely popular among people of all ages. We ordered Chicken shawarma, Pita with Oriental Chicken salad and Laban. The shawarma was fantastic...the bread was flavourful and soft and the chicken and vegetables marinated with the spices and Mayo were perfect. The laban was a refreshing respite on that very hot day and balanced the flavours of shawarma roll. The salad needs special mention, it was the best dish of all. The dressing was brilliant and they should bottle it up and sell it, they will make a fortune I tell you!
EXTRA MARKS FOR REASONABLE RATE!!! A great place for giving treatsüòú üòÖ. The only thing to fault is the space, but hopefully they will sort it out soon.

From the basic shawarma wrap, to the pita with shawarma chicken salad, to the lebaneh chicken/mutton burger. I have to visit this place every time I visit Kolkata, it's almost obligatory. Forget the decor and the service, the food is the only thing that matters here.

Pretty average tasting shawarma which was really disappointing for a shawarma fanatic like me considering this place had a rating 3.7 and comments like "best sharwarma in town". I had asked to make my sharwarma spicy which actually backfired at me for all i found was half split raw green chillis in every bite and hence thats what i could only taste. Even the mint cooler was not upto the mark and highly over-priced. This place really ruined my lunch date.
I would not recommend this place because even roadside side eateries serve far better tasting shawarma than than they do here.

Very strategic location and quite good food. Have tried their kebabs and shawarma rolls earlier and today I ventured out to have a chicken shawarma salad - I instructed them to avoid mayonnaise altogether and it turned out to be a good decision. Mayonnaise overpowers the subtle middle'eastern flavors and is not healthy too. Actually speaking I have not seen such rampant use of mayo in mid-east... it is probably our way of indianising and destroying the original flavors...

This was about two days back that we could not decide where to drop in after watching a movie in South city and finally ended up here. It was my first time there and I had almost no idea of what to choose. I went by my friend's choice and we ordered two varieties of chicken salad which came with pita bread... Out of this one was an oriental version. 
Well first of all the presentation of the food was wonderful and the quantity was very, very good. The food was very tasty and the best part is how the person serving came down and asked twice about how the food was. That was something very sweet. This place is going to be a regular with me now. Happy that I stay closeby!!

Ordered two combo meals, one was of chicken shawarma wrap and lemon and mint cooler while the other one was of chicken burger, one lebanneh fried chicken and lemon and mint cooler. Well the shawarma wrap was really tasty, tasty perfectly lebanese, the burger was also pretty good and the lebanneh fried chicken was the show stopper with the perfect outer coating. And the lemon and mint cooler was very refreshing.  Though the staffs were not friendly and the order came really late. Overall a nice place and a must visit for all atleast for once.

A decent Lebanese joint at Lords more. It is best suited for take aways as the seating area is small. About the food, well I was not satisfied. We got a cheese chicken shawarma, chicken shawarma, egg submarine, doner kebabs and oriental chicken salad. As per the menu cheese chicken shawarma was supposed to have shredded cheddar cheese, but we got melted cheese. The egg submarine was supposed to have poached eggs, but we had omelette. This was not at all justified. Almost every dish had excess of mayo in it, which suppressed the taste of the chicken. The buns are soft and tasty. However I found that almost all the dishes we ordered, sweetness was too much in them, which is not like Lebanese food. The chicken salad was the only thing that was perfect. Disappointed indeed!

The food here is just wow. One combo meal is enough in quantity and quality. The burgers here are great and the fried chicken really large and crispy. Affordable and good prices. The only downside is that the space of too small and sometimes people need to share tables with other groups or sit cramped up, or sit outside on the footpath in plastic chairs. All the good rating for the food and prices.

Such a Tiny place. Not fit for big groups to go and eat at. But, I guess it mostly works as a takeaway. I was really hungry and had ordered the chicken jumbo shawarma. I regretted it immediately after taking my firat bite. Less chicken and too much mayo. Makes you queasy. Same goes for the cheese shawarma. My friend had the fish shawarma and I believe the fish was not fresh coz it had a strange smell to it. I would prefer eating at Go Lebanese anyday

This place serves one of the best shawarma in the town. The food is really fresh and the test is really awesome. Although the place is small and doesn't have proper sitting arrangements. But thus is one of those few places where you forget about everything after you taste the food. If you are into Lebanese food you gotta try this place out.

But, if you are a foodie and looking for great Shawarma wrap then this is the place you need to be...
Visit once as soon as possible an do try chicken Shawarma wrap and Chicken Shawarma Salad with two sauces available with them along with mayo...
Spread the sauces over the salad and let go your dieting plans for once...

Well, for me, currently this is the best place for Shawarma in Kolkata right now. Located at Lords More, Shawarma Nation provides us with spaceous and well maintained interiors when compared to other shawarma joints. The people who serve are also well behaved. The best item - obviously the "Shawarma Wrap" is totally value for money. Its very tasty filled with Lebanese flavours. The "jumbo shawarma wrap", costs only Rs 20 more the normal one, can sometimes be too much for a single person to consume. The quality and quantity is very good as per as its price. We tried the Shish Tawook but didn't like it that much. If you wanna taste some awesome shawarmas, this has to be your destination.

I have been a great fan of your food since you opened your place. It is close to my house so I used to be a regular customer. I love you Arabian Chicken Biryani and shawarma. I went there few days back and felt certain changes need to be brought. You need to improve the quality of snacks item you serve like the nuggets. And it would be great if you can somehow expand your sitting space. It's too tiny to dine in. Otherwise your authentic Lebanese food items are great!

Heard alot from my friends regarding lebanese food so i visited this place with my dad to try out lebanese. Since Shawarma Nation was near to my house so went there. Its a very small place. Ordered chickhen wrap(small version). Well it was okhayish,not that good though. Atleast it was not my cup of tea. Still the quality and quantity of the food was good. The ingredients they used was complementing each other. People who loves lebanese can try this place.

Unique in itself as they are one of the very few outlets serving Lebanese and Arabic food exclusively. It is easy to locate and getting to this place is very convenient if one is using public transportation. If you have your own vehicle, parking will be a problem here.
Not many people can be seated, so if you have a big group that can be an issue. No wash basin but they try to make up for it by providing hand sanitizers.
Coming to the food....decent shawarma wraps...enjoyable to say the least. The Hummus that they make is quite good. Biriyani is good too. You can try the Ablama rice curry. We ordered the Mutton Ablama rice curry and it turned out to be pretty good. The coolers are pretty cool. Service is very prompt and good.All in all it's a nice place to enjoy a light meal with friends or even if you are alone.

Love coming back for one and only jumbo Shawarma. The taste doesn't get off my tongue. Only other joint after Go Lebanese, that can create the same essence, taste, flavor and looks, the place is very clean and the way serve gives it a premium feel, though i haven't tried much of the items they offer but i am a big fan if this joint. They have seating arrangement but you need to squeeze yourself in as they limited capacity, it can hardly accommodate 10-12 people. Hope they expand it soon. Recently they have joined the biriyani revolution and customized it their way.

I love the dishes they offer. Normally we order wrap on Lebanese food. But people must try "sheek tawook", "lebanese tawook" and all Arabian dishes like Biriyani in Lebanese style. "Jumbo chicken shawarma wrap" is best among the dishes they offer, with extra maionese,yumm.... Only thing that irritates, is place. It's so small that, its practically congested. Services of them are good.

They probably make the best shawarma roll and salad in the city. Their paneer wrap is tasty as well. Been there twice, liked their food a lot. The other shawarma joints don't put sufficient mayonnaise and makes the chicken dry; not with them, they make the shawarma items very juicy. Love it that way. Only issue is this place is quite small.

From where do I start,  I won't say that it was a horrible experience but I will say that it's a place  I won't be visiting soon. I ordered 3 items as were in thee and managed to finish none as they were not appetizing enough. The joint is too small and can get pretty uncomfortable if there are a dozen of people. I won't be going into details about the items I ordered as I have already said it all and the prices I don't even remember but they do not matter if the food isn't that good.

Went here yesterday and had a good experience. We had to wait for 10 mins as the outlet was full.
Location- lord's more, quite easy to locate
Ambience- a small outlet with basic sitting arrangement. Was clean.
Food- there were 4 of us and we decided to settle on shawarma wrap. We ordered 3 jumbo and 1 medium wrap. The jumbo wraps were really big and they consisted of good amount of chicken and other filling. The pita bread was soft. Green chutney was provided along with it. Though the white sauce in the wrap was less and after we finished half of the wrap, it became a little dry.
Pocket pinch- was pocket friendly.
I will definitely visit here again and try their other items :)

This place had been on my list for quite some time, along with a couple of other shwarma joints, and I got to tick it off today, as we went in for a light 'shwarma dinner' in between our bouts of Pujo adda. This is a small snug eatery situated at Lord's crossing. The space inside is divided into the kitchen and the seating area, and you can see what's going on in the kitchen right from your seat. Not much interior to boast about - not enough room for that. The sole extravagance is the HD TV tuned to a food channel.

I ordered the jumbo chicken shawarma wrap and a glass of Laban, which seemed to be a close cousin of lassi from the description. The chicken wrap was lip-smacking, saucy, and absolutely filling - a very well prepared wrap by all standards. The drink, however, was mundane and disappointing. It hardly had any flavor and needs a lot of improvement.¬†

Final verdict - a pretty decent shawarma house, and quite comfortable too if you manage to get a seat inside.

Being a musician I have to say that they were playing exceptionally good music which made my mood! I've ordered Chicken cheese shawarma wrap and French fries. It took just 4-5 minutes and served fresh.  Great French fries also.  it's too much cozy but the pricing and overall good quality is really nice.  definitely a good pocket friendly joint, loved it!

Well staying in the Middle East any non vegetarian knows and loves their shawarma. I visited this place after reading the reviews and would rate this place as average. Starting with the wrapping of the shawarma, it's chaotic everything's falling down and gets super messy. I wouldn't have minded that if the shawarma atleast tasted good. The garlic sauce that they make is some garlic flavored mostly sweet mayo and I love the garlic sauce so expecting it to be good told the guy to put some extra and suffered! The chicken was good veggies they put were fresh but the sauce was a turnoff and spoilt the whole shawarma for me. Taste is just average so 2.5/5. I would prefer the shawarma in the spencer food section, south city mall better and tastier anyday.

This pocket friendly eatery offers a wide spread of Lebanese cuisine from Chicken Shawarma Salad, which happens to be the most popular dish this place offers to Shawarma Wraps, Egg Submarines, Falafel wraps to Lebanese style Biriyani.

This isn't your place if you want to sit and dine. For a grab-and-go, though, it's perfect. The chicken shawarma wrap is their best offering, and if adventurous try the falafel and doner kebab.

I have been to this place twice and I have certainly liked the food that they serve here.¬†

On two different occasions, I tried the chicken shawarma salad with pita bread, the oriental chicken salad with pita, cheese chicken shawarma wrap and lemon mint cooler.¬†

Both salads were good, though i liken the chicken shawarma salad better. What made me sad was the very little choice of salads that they offer, given that I just love variety of salads.¬†

The wrap was really good and cheeeesy! Makes me hungry every time I think of it :P¬†

As to the place, its a small one located at the Lord's crossing on Prince Anwar Shah road. Can sit about 10-12 persons at a time. The service is quick too and the people are really polite.¬†

Guys, please do add more salad options!

Small place in Lord's crossing! It can accommodate about 8-10 people at a time! Lebanese food is gradually getting more famous in Kolkata , as it is healthy and tasty as well! I tried the Chicken Shawarma Wrap. It was filling, tasty and well made.No complaints whatsoever! They also serve Kebabs and Oil free Biriyani! Have to try those items next! Anyway long story short. Good food. Cheap price! What more can you ask for?

Me and my roommate were hungry like anything and wanted to order something from nearby foodjoints. It was then I stumbled upon this place on Zomato. We had Lebanese tawook and jumbo chicken shawarma wrap. And I must say they were delicious. And the best part is they don't burn a hole in your pocket. For the love of food, its definitely worth a try.. :)

One of my favourite food joint of my locality. Located at Lord's Bakery More near South City. It is a small tiny place, well decorated with sitting arrangement for 10-15 people. The AC is pretty chilled. Service and food quality is good and price is average. I have been there many a times, whenever I got to that area and feel like having Lebanese food. My favourite pick from there is "Chicken Mussakhan Wrap". Their menu also consist of other good items as well. Delivery after giving order is also pretty fast. Over all a good eating experience.

The first think that will attract your notice is the theme of this restaurant. The varieties and quality of food is very good here. The ambiance and cleanliness is ok. The price is also reasonable to some extent. The staffs are well decplined and of good behaviour. Overall a good place for casual hangout. The onlt thing is that, its little cozy as the floor space is on a bit lesser side.

Shawarma Nation, known for it's best Lebanese cuisines, located near Prince Anwar Shah Road, 5 minutes walk from South City! 

Ordered 2 combos, one with Chicken shawarma wrap, with refreshing mint and lemon cooling juice and the other was chicken mussakhan wrap with another refreshing mint and lemon cooling juice. Even ordered some quick bites like sheesh tawook which is grilled saute steak chicken marinated in lebanese spices, served with khaboos (pita bread)

Everything was at reasonable prices. Ambience was amazing. 
Loved it!!

This small restaurant is located right at the Lords crossing besides the Sugar and Spice shop.It has decent seating arrangements and serves great Shawarma rolls which are an absolute delight for the taste buds. The other items are also decent enough. However, the only drawback is that it doesnt have any kind of soft drinks/mocktail etc on the menu. Apart from this this place genuinely calls for occassional visits if you happen to be near it and is quite pocket friendly.

Even though the menu contains a moderate number of items but some of them are not available. We ordered there paneer shawarma roll, chicken shawarma salad & arabian chicken biriyani. The quality & taste is quite good & the biriyani tasted different but awsome. One should surely try this place in that locality.

On a rainy afternoon, while returning home ¬†hopped on to this place to have some Lebanese.. Ordered a Jumbo Shawarma Roll. ¬†Well the taste was like, Ma-Ma-Mia!! For the very first time I tried Lebanese!! It was great!! ¬†Good stuffing, & it was really a jumbo One! So It actually satisfied my intense hunger.
I wanted to try something more, but it was not available!! Got a little disappointed, but never mind, will try some other day. ¬†
Good food. So thumbs up to this place!

It's a nice Lebanese joint with an attractive menu at a very good location. Very few tables and a crippled seating arrangement like most Lebanese restaurants, but the quality of food is pretty good.
We ordered jumbo Chicken Shawarma wraps and a Chicken Shish Tawook to wrap up the lunch and leave the place with a smile. Decent hospitality as well. Another visit is imminent.

One year ago I would have given 4 out of 5. When they opened, their shawarma rolls were flavourful, with sane amount of dressing, savoury and non spicy. I really don't know why but it's a tendency with ALL "Lebanese " food joints in Cal ( they r as Lebanese as Kolkata Chinese are authentically Chinese) - after a year the original taste of dishes disappears. Biryani becomes  oily, loaded with masala and potatoes ( wtf? Who said Lebanese eat biryani - one, and with huge tasteless starchy blobs - two??). And rolls all go the same road - turning into an ill-heated flat bread, filled with dry morsels of meat , shredded chewy cabbage and Tons of Sweet Mayo. I think probably this kind of mayonnaise is sold in bulk cheap as dirt, and once they pull the crowd, owners decide anything will go down those hungry throats. 
The was the story with Go Lebanese, Royal Lenanese and now Shawarma Nation. Dear owner of SN!! Shawarma roll, having like 5 tablespoons of low quality mayo on top is very, very unappetising. It's pike some, forgive me my brutal honesty. So much so, out of two rolls we threw out 1.5. And we were hungry. 
Chicken shish tawook is just ok but quantity is less. Hummus - ok, nothing to write home about, I make better at home, but not bad either.
Verdict - I swear by shawarma joint in South City Spencers food court. They seem to be the only one in Cal who makes a decent shawarma. ( God, please don't let them find out about the cheap sweet mayonnaise )

Shawarma nation was one of the first Lebanese food joints at Lord's more. Initially, their menu did catch my eye. I love Lebanese food. But I hate Lebanese food that drip oil, especially when they claim to be "almost oil free". So I don't quite fancy Shawarma nation anymore. They put loads of mayonnaise on top of the shawarma roll, so when one reaches the bottom of the roll, they are left with only dry chewy pieces of chicken. I think instead of loading the shawarma with the mayo, it'd be better if they pre-mixed the filling with the sauce and then place it on the pita. And I also do have issues with mayonnaise on shawarma. As far as I know, shawarmas should be served with tahini sauce or hummus. Tahini being made of sesame seeds and hummus of chickpeas. The sauce which shawarma nation uses on its shawarmas tastes neither like tahini nor like hummus and resembles a garlicky blend of mayonnaise. However, their home delivery service is good. Seating arrangement is tiny but clean and cosy.

Heavy downpour while coming back from my work and intense hunger brought me here. It is at lords more, lake gardens. A very small Lebanese junction with hardly 4 tables and 10-12 seats, with a large mirror on one wall and abstract wall paper on another. Another side having kitchen separated by glass door. It is very congested though well air conditioned. 
  I ordered chicken Lebanese tawook and lemon and mint cooler. I asked them to serve the drink first. After 5-6 minutes they served it. It was truly awesome and refreshing. Though a bit sour, the smell of the mint just tickled my taste buds and i got more hungry. After 15 minutes they served the dish. Chicken pieces surrounded by pita breads with green chutni. The chicken pieces were boneless, soft and perfectly cooked with the spices. The pita bread was thin, soft and fresh. Green mint chutni was a bit hot. 
  Price is reasonable and pocket friendly. Service is good.

Shawarma Nation is a small outlet on Lords Bakery Road. We started off with the Lemon Mint Cooler - it was terrible.

Next, Shawarma Wrap- Decent but it's pretty sweet unlike what it should have been. The quantity was fulfilling but the taste was very ordinary.

Ultimately, Lebanese Tawook Chicken- it was good and saved our lunch from becoming a misery. The chicken was marinated beautifully and the spices were absolutely apt.

Verdict : Not one of the better Lebanese outlets out there.

I have visited this place a no.of times in the last 12 months. Good prices and good food. They are open till late in the night. Worth a visit, regularly.

The ambience of this joint is very soothing & the service is also very good!
But what matters the most is the food, which is the biggest plus point of them!
Both the items are superb in taste (& quite large in size) & whenever you look at them, you will feel hungry! Also, the pocket pinch is pretty low.. So,I recommend everyone to visit the Shawarma Nation! :-)

A small lebanese place located at the heart of Lord's Bakery signal for a long time. I have been here more than once, but finally got the chance to give a review. A very pocket friendly place to have a quick snack when you are nearby and in need of food. Their specialities are Shawarma Wrap, Shawarma Salads and  Lebanese Tawook. I have also tried the Lebanese Burger which is filling and tasty. All of them come with pita bread and sauces and veggies and are excellent in taste. The seats inside are limited to you have to be lucky to get a place, and service could be a bit faster. A definite visit to this place for people who like lebanese food. Overall, 3.5/5.

I had a very annoying experience with this place today. They are supposed to open at 12 noon. So my friend and I turned up at about 12.30pm for a bite and they were still not properly opened. The people didn't seem to want to serve us at all. They were taking their time, operating at their own leisurely pace. Kept us waiting for almost 20 minutes after saying they will be properly opened within 10 mins. When I wanted to order, they refused to take my order. This is gross and unprofessional behaviour from a place that has become popular. Last year, when I went there it was a nice place. I am sad to say it has deteriorated and how do I know how the food was? I didn't even get to eat.

The best of the lot is the shawarma sandwich.

Without any delay we ordered a jumbo chicken shawarma and my friend ordered an egg submarine. Chicken shawarma was big huge amount of mayo and chicken filling. But the taste was unidirectional, i prefer to have pickels in it. the green chutney they serve also could be better, felt a little bland to taste. My friend seemed too like his egg submarine. With a little pickle this can be the best shawarma in town. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Needless to mention this place is quite Pocket Friendly. Great value of money. :) ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ================= ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Brought a takeaway of Shawarma roll from here. Had a lot of expectations from this place. Its quantity was huge. lots of chicken inside, but due to the high temperature all the mayo inside got leaked and spoilt the texture of the pita bread. i was barely able to hold it as a roll. Poor me! cudnt enjoy it very well. Hope to visit this place again very soon.

My first Lebanese love affair started on this place. Needless to say...I frequent this place almost every week. The jumbo shawarma wrap, salad and doner burger happens to be my staple. The place has got a very college canteen kind of a feel. The price does not burn a hole in my purse, and food tastes lovely.
P.S. I am totally in love with the mayo kind of sauce..I often order an extra bowl along with my wrap or salad.

this is a small joint at the Lord's bakery more. have been to place only once. the ambiance is nothing much to speak or write about, they have serious space constraints and so it would be generally unwise to visit the joint with a large group. the shawarma was okayish, nothing exceptional. i tried the lebanese fried chicken and was not much contented with what they had to offer. anyway, to those of you food adventurers do give this place a try if you have got a lebanese fetish :P

Located at a very convenient location at Lord's mor, Shawarma nation serves delightful Lebanese cuisine.¬†For those foodies who are tired of eating shawarmas of the size of a samosa, they serve a filling, mouth tingling Jumbo Shawarma.Eating here might be an issue even though there is seating facility the place is quite small and clogged even though the ambience is just fine with the local radio station tuned on to the speakers.¬†Chicken Musakkan and Chicken Shawarma Salad and Shish Tawook are a must try items on the menu.¬†You'll leave happy and your pockets a little less heavy.

Worst Lebanese food in whole kolkata. If you really want to try Lebanese, go to royal Lebanese or go Lebanese. Dining space is too short. Shawarma rolls are the worst.

Small joint dishing out authentic Lebanese food...shawarma wrap and salad...is comparable to most of the Lebanese joints. ..what sets them apart are.....lebaneh chick burger....doner kabab...tuna fish shwarma....tastes heavenly and very authentic. ...the tuna fish shwarma is a very well attempted twist and the result is sumptuous awesome shwarma wraop with a difference. ..doner kebab is comparable to doner king of thailand...overall great food at affordable price

Shawarma nation at Lord‚Äôs mor is a very small joint which serves an array of authentic Lebanese food. I have been there only twice, once for the Shawarma wrap which was good and again for the Arabic Biryani which did not really go down well with me.

Food : 3/5

Service: 3.5/5

Ambience: 2/5

Lebanese Food Lovers looking for the best chicken swarama salad or looking to grab your wrap and indulge into the deep taste of mayonese and the other ingredients.... Or want to grab some tuna fish shawarma inside a good price range that keeps your stomach full and also serves your taste buds... Don't look any further.. just drop into this outlet of Shawarma ¬†Nation located at Lake gardens.. Lords Modh... The food is delecious and the quantity is enough for a single person... Just that there isnt much place to sit and have it and they need to check the behavior of their staffs... If we take aside these minute faults, then undoubtedly you are in the right place :)

There food is good to taste but the swarma roll contains lots of mayonnaise which tasted too cheesy for a roll to be , tawook Is an awesome dish , Arabian biriyani is too rich for its taste and costs are reasonable and wont bore a hole in your pocket .

Let's suppose you are in a situation where you don't have a lot of cash, you're ravenous, it's bloody hot outside and you happen to be near the South City area (in that order of importance), make sure to drop by at Shawarma Nation. It's a tiny, air- conditioned joint, with enough seating arrangement for about 12 people located right in the Lords crossing.
The chicken shawarma salad and the jumbo shawarma roll are must haves. If you're in the mood for experimentation try out the Arabic biryani or the chicken Shish Tawook. Be warned that the biryani tastes nothing like the Hyderabadi or Awadhi biryani. The rice is yellow with finely sliced, fried potatoes in it and it's served with a tasty raita. The Shish Tawook is a platter of chicken kebabs with that typical Lebanese taste. They are very generous with their quantity and amount of meat. Hopefully that will not change any time soon.

Never did I think I'll be this disappointed by Shawarma Nation. We were looking for an air-conditioned eatery when this place popped in our mind. We had already been there before and hence didn't think twice before going again. But such a wrong decision it was. We ordered Citizen's Shawarma Platter which was supposed to have five different dishes. We were served a veg salad,two chicken nuggets, four pita breads,hummus,mayonnaise and few shredded grilled chicken pieces. They count mayonnaise as a "dish". The nuggets tasted like veg nuggets without any trace of chicken!

Our second order was a Lebanon Key Burger which was another disappointment. The small chicken patty was hidden beneath the thick layer of salads and mayonnaise!

The staffs are indecent and not cooperative. They completely ignored our instruction of not putting tomatoes in the burger. 

A very slow service too.

Never going back again.

Paid a visit to Shawarma Nation for a post-exam urge for their pocket-friendly Lebanese food.

‚òÖ LOCATION : Lord's More.

‚òÖ AMBIANCE : It is a small place with a seating capacity of 8-9 people. They have a brilliant AC and numerous fans inside.

‚òÖ FOOD + SERVICE : The shawarma rolls and Chicken Sheesh Tawook are decent. But the Shawarma Platter was a complete waste of money and time. The attendant had described it as a platter consisting of 5 preparations including chicken nuggets and grilled chicken. And this was what we were served - Hummus (disliked), Pita bread, Mayonnaise (that, being one of the 5 preparations on the platter!), Chicken nuggets which tasted like veg nuggets, a veg salad of carrot, tomato, capsicum and onion, and some Grilled chicken sprinkled with onion.
Added to this, we had ordered a Lebanon Kebab Burger. We had been kept waiting for more than 35 minutes, during which our hunger (and frustration due to the disappointing shawarma platter) had already began soaring. The excuse they gave was "We don't keep the burgers here, so the other guy has gone to get it from the kitchen. Why else would we make you wait?"
On the same visit, we had requested them to skip out the tomatoes in the burger. Even that was ignored.
> Service was a MASSIVE turn off.

‚òÖ PRICES : The prices are on a slightly lower side with respect to its competitors in the line of Lebanese food. They don't charge taxes [as on 11th May '15] .

The slow service and disheartening food are repulsive. Not making any plans to visit them anytime soon.

Tiny Lebanese joint at the Lords crossing... On a Saturday evening, I dropped by along with a friend...They serves toothsome lebanese dishes ... We had ordered Jumbo shawarma wrap... it was filled with tender pieces of chicken and tasty mayonese ...salads were fresh...and most interestingly , it costs 95 bucks only...so recommended when your taste buds are craving for a non-spicy but scrummy snacks break.

It has been a long time since i wanted to review this place down and my 2nd visit here yesterday gave me an opportunity to do so.

This is a small lebanese food corner as is noticed prominently from the name. They expertise in shawarma salads and wraps. We were around the area when suddenly hunger struck us and we decided to drop in here. This place offers excellent and wholesome food at very reasonable price and also has got really comforting atmosphere.

The place is very small in area and has got the capacity to accommodate only 10-14 people at a time. However,it remains almost empty during afternoon so dropping in during those hours seems to be more convincing. The place isn't very warming when it comes to decor and won't please your eyes but the taste of their food would anyway do the trick of pleasing your taste buds. An air conditioner plays the role of a life saviour during the extremely humid weather...though the constant interruption of people opening and closing the kitchen door doesn't quite let the air cool down the room. A fan placed at the corner helps circulate the air and you can have your food at some really comforting ambience.

We ordered their speciality...the chicken shawarma salad and 1 lemon and mint cooler. The shawarma salad as expected was very nicely marinated with condiments and contained huge chunks of chicken and was rich in mayonnaise. Though the 8 pita breads were really small as compared to other lebanese outlets. But the way they have marinated and designed the whole item was something to be applauded. The lemon and mint cooler was served in a normal plastic glass but the taste was way ahead of my expectation. With a mint leaf on top,it was well mixed with some ice,lemon and other things(which i couldn't make out what:-P) and was a perfect cooler during this scorching summer heat.

Overall a really nice experience. A deduction of 1 point is justified due to the constant opening and closing of kitchen door which paves way for the kitchen smoke to enter. Otherwise a lovely place to grab a quick bite and leave satisfactorily:-)

Overdose of mayo in the jumbo shawarma wrap. but it was worth having. excellent value for money. One jumbo made my stomach full. Looking forward to visit again. but i sincerely wonder whether a lebanese prefers his/her shawarma in this manner :p. a total thumbs up for the location. but sadly no cards are accepted, which must change.

One rainy kolkata evening, I ran into this place. Located quietly on Lords more (near south city mall.. around 500 meters) on prince anwar shah road, it could not have hoped for a better location.
Location & accessibility--5/5
Coming to the ambiance, its a small place, seating around 8-10 people inside. But its pretty neat and clean. Nothing great about the overall ambiance.
Ambiance--3/5
Now the all important stuff. Food. Their Shawarma Salad with Pita bread and Chicken Lebanese Tawook is out of the world. Awesome. They have got the taste and flavor bang on. However, the Lebanese fried chicken was a letdown though.¬†
Food--4.5/5
Service is moderately fast. Took some time to prepare the food, but seeing its such a small joint, its fine. Specially considering the quality, its trifling. We were two people, so they placed two forks on each plate, a very thoughtful small addition that caught my eyes. The person who took order was very friendly and helped explain the dishes.¬†
Service--5/5
Cost-- The best value for money and quality. wins hands down. -- 5/5

Overall, its an excellent place to visit. I plan to visit again soon to check out the veg dishes !!

This is a gem of a place. Initially when I moved to Kolkata from pune, I was missing a decent shawarma place. And what I was searching all over the city, was right there near my house, at the Lord's Crossing and a stone throw away from South City Mall. This is a small place with around five tables. The white-green interior gives you a refreshing look. The menu was a two sided laminated leaflet focused only on Lebanese and Arabian food. We ordered the shawarma salad. The service was prompt. It was brilliant. As good as the ones I had at Pune's best Lebanese joints. The quantity was sufficient. The pita bread was soft and most important, the garlic sauce was in the right proportion. Hats off!! Going to visit it again and again.

They have truly impressed me. Had a bad review for this place earlier. But in the recent past few days: shawarma wraps from the place, the chicken submarine, the salad, the jumbo shawarma and so many things. These people truly know how to innovate. They have gone deep into the Lebanese fast food. With various sauces and different ways of grilling the chicken they have formed so many dishes which are totally thrilling.

I recommend everyone to try this place for a great Lebanese fast dish.

On a scorching hot afternoon like a shade of cool adobe visited Shawarma Nation at the Lord's crossing close to South City.¬†

In coolers ordered for Laban and Lemon Mint Cooler. Both the drink were thirst quenchers. Laban was curd based but will recommend Lemon Mint Cooler due to its refreshing taste.¬†

In starters the obvious pick was most discussed Shawarma Wrap which was stuffed with chicken pieces and garlic dip and wrapped around with soft pita bread. One of the best shawarma rolls in town. 

In main course we ordered Chicken Ablama Rice Curry and Chicken Lebanese Tawook. Rice curry was light and taste was mild not rich or spicy. However the winner of the day was Chicken Lebanese Tawook. What an amazing taste of caramelized onion and other spices!! Goes perfectly with pita bread. But one must order an extra garlic dip to dip pita bread pieces wrapping chicken cubes to enrich the taste of this unique dish. Just melts inside mouth.

Service was prompt but slightly disappointed with two things. Unavailability of tahini dip and lack of ice or chilled water to make the drinks cooler which is must during summer. Though they managed cold water finally on showing our disappointment. Parking can be done inside adjoining alley. Bill was INR 405 only inclusive all. Only accepts cash. The final verdict the best Lebanese junction in the metro.

One of those places which totally destroys your mood. Located at the very busy 'Lords More', this place caught my attention quite a few times and hence finally decided to try their shawarma. Totally disappointed with that they served. First of all the shawarma was not at all filling. The amount of chicken they put is absolutely not acceptable after charging an high amount. The Mayo tasted different. The onions dipped in vinegar was not fresh. Overall a horrible experience and i feel i have been cheated. I would recommend everyone to skip this place as there are good lebanese joints nearby.

This small place is within 5 minutes walking distance of South City Mall. I prefer eating here to eating in the Food Court at the Mall.
There is hardly place for 10-12 people which might lead you to think it's not too popular. But it becomes jam-packed often. Service is very fast and the food is very good. It's cheap and the Jumbo Chicken Shawarma is really "Jumbo". A must visit place in South Kolkata.

A great place to fill you're tummy on the go.
Ordering 4 jumbo shawarma rolls and a Chicken Shish tawook, I really expected a long wait.
On the contrary we got it in nearly 10 minutes and that too the placed was packed with customers.
The shawarma tastes really good and the flavors of the tawook are awesome.
Be it inside or on the footpath, the prices remain the same..¬†
There's nothing except napkins so if your hands get messy, tough luck!!!
The¬†staffs¬†are quick efficient and warm.
Prices are reasonable 100 for the jumbo shawarma and 160 for the tawook (included of all taxes), it really doesn't pinch your pocket, rather it fills your stomach.
To sum up a really good fast food joint that doesn't make you go broke

Location: Adjacent to Dosa Corner; Near Cheeni Kum Restaurant, Lords Crossing.

This Lebanese joint was visited while returning from tuition post-lunch hours after a bitter experience at the South Indian eatery (Dosa Corner) adjacent to this place. I had skipped lunch and was super hungry thus, dropped by to order something filling for myself.
About the AMBIANCE, the green-white interiors look pretty soothing. They have seating arrangements (plastic chairs and stools) on the pathway as well as a proper seating arrangement (tables and cushioned seats) adjacent to their open kitchen counter. A glass window in the partition of the kitchen and dine-in enabled worried customers to keep an eye on their order. :P
A plus: They have hand sanitizer kept on each table. Impressive.
A negative: Lacks a hand wash.

About the FOOD, their menu is pretty widespread catering to Lebanese/Arabic cuisine. Had wished for a Paneer Shawarma Wrap (which was unavailable) so after a bit of contemplation called for a Falafel Wrap along with an add-on of Garlic Dip (wished for Tahini Dip but, was unavailable) and Arabic Pickle.

- Falafel Wrap [INR 90]
The pita was soft and warm with a filling of perfect mayo level, crisp and flavorful falafel and fresh veggies. Tasted good.
Was served along with coriander chutney. Could be substituted by coriander-chilli chutney/pickled green chillies.
No pickled onions on the side, missed it. However, raw onion was provided on request.

- Garlic Dip [INR 15]
Had a spot on garlic flavor, not too much & not too less. Mustard sauce drizzled along the side, mix it in the dip and it tastes good.

- Arabic Pickle (Lebanese Pickle) [INR 15]
Also know as Mukhalal is nothing but, pickled vegetables (carrot, beet, cucumber & jalape√±o chillies). This pickle is also put inside a shawarma at many joints.
The pickle is supposed to be a sweet and sour accompaniment to any Lebanese dish, but, here it wasn't so. The Pickle just had carrots and jalape√±o chillies; lacked the sweetness part. Disappointed.

The STAFF was friendly, polite and had a fair knowledge of the menu. The SERVICE however was found to be slow.
PRICES were pretty reasonable as well as nearly at par with other joints catering to the same cuisine.

Overall was an above-average experience.
- Yet to try the remaining fare, comments due.
- Suggestion: Make sure all your products on offer are available and that the authenticity of the products are maintained. :)

The food is simple horrible. Though the cost of each item is comparatively pocket friendly, quantity and taste wise it is simple a waste of time and money. I went with a friend nd had a chicken shawarma which had lesser amount of chicken than a chicken chop. But it was good as it contained fresh salad with meonies. Now the shawarma platter is absolutely rubbish. These two dishes have left a very poor impression of this place on me.

It is very recently that kolkata has been having an affair with lebanese food. This one Particular joint had been the venue for many hangouts and today while writing this review I'm kinda surprised that I haven't done this one. Previously all my visits have been with friends and all we ate were shawarmas which is after go lebanese my favourite. It is absolutely yummy and too much of a portion, especially the 100/- rupee jumbo one.
But today my parents and I were a very hungry trio and after gulping down the jumbos we actually ordered a lebanese chelo kebab plate. Its actually a really interesting dish with a typical biriyani colored portion of rice, a water poach and a big piece of solidified mutton keema dipped in an absolutely sinful tomato flavored curry. Although we could hardly move we scraped the plate clean.
Very good food indeed.
Located at one of the most popular crossings of the city, the place isn't hard to find in Lords more.
Don't let the small outlet fool you, what awaits inside is a pleasant surprise. There is also the option of a hand sanitizer which I was impressed with, being the neat freak that I am. You can actually see the food being cooked which is a fun bonus! The staff is courteous and smiling.
They could improve on the Outlet always but overall a good one for a good fill.
P.s I hope the vivid description does the trick. I was too hungry to click a pic first and then eat. I attacked the plate. Maybe next time! :p

First and foremost I would like to say kudos to this place for allowing smooth ordering and also for courteous staff. Now coming to the food -- they do pretty good job. We tried Chicken Jumbo Shawarma Wrap, Chicken Lebanese Tawook and Hummus. The food was pretty satisfactory. They even offer prompt delivery services.

Best place,when you are hungry enough to eat a horse but on a shoe string budget.The chicken shish tawook was a let down and do NOT order the shawarma salad(couldn't find any chicken in mine).The shawarma wrap is insanely delicious,service is great.Small place but overall thumbs up.

Located at lords more, this small outlet specializes in Lebanese wraps. Their shawarma and musakkan wraps are delicious. 
However the other items on the platter fail to impress. Couldn't get half of the items in the menu. The ablama curry wasn't good. The drinks are average.

Thumb's up for the shawarma wrap. It was good both quality and quantity wise. We didn't feel anything extraordinary about the Arabic Chicken Biriyani. It was pretty average both in quantity and taste. Though we absolutely loved the raita served with it. 
A few items from the menu were not available at that time. I am not sure if they are still offering the mini wrap or completely discontinued that one. The sitting arrangement was decent and air conditioned. 

In short, good experience. Might go back to try the other items from the menu.

This tiny eatery serves good shawarma wraps.The wrap is soft,the meat abundant and tender,the sauce pleasing to the palate.The Laban drink and the mint cooler are quite refreshing.However the Ab lama rice curry was a letdown.The gravy was tasteless and ill seasoned.
Another let down is they cannot serve everything on the menu card.We had been disappointed when we could not get any Baba Ghanouj or potato wedges.
A pocket friendly place though.I loved the happy lime green walls.Worth a visit.

In the very recent past, Lebanese cuisines made its way into the city of joy and in a very short period of time it gained enormous popularity. Hence along with the Lebanese craving a lot of Lebanese joints opened up in almost every nook and corner of the city. But this particular joint "Shawara Nation" was one of the first Lebanese joints opening up in Kolkata and it gained instant recognition as one of the best and sought after outlets. Located in the renowned landmark i.e.- lord's more, and perhaps only one of its kind having a well laid air conditioned sitting accomodation. It offers a wide variety of Lebanese delicacies ranging from- the acclaimed shawarma wrap, tawooks, Arabian rice, Lebanese burgers etc; each and every dish which I have tried at this joint has a distinctive blend of Lebanese flavor punched with Indian spices in a perfect ratio to favor the indian pallet and so far it has worked out pretty well for them. The staffs are very friendly and courteous and helps you to grasp the unfamiliar Lebanese names of the offered dishes in a very simplified way to help you make an informed choice. The prices are also on the reasonable side. Overall one of the best Lebanese joints in town as I said before and a perfect place to justify your Lebanese craves.

I have been to this place quite a few times now, and have tried a number of items from their menu. The Jumbo Shwarma Wrap is tasty, though Ar-Han-Thai in South City makes better. But to be fair, shwarmas here are cheaper. The mayonnaise is slightly on the sweeter side, which I personally liked, but a lot of my friends didn't. I have also tried the Shish Tawook, which was not value for money. The quantity is really less as compared to the price, and it did not taste anything out of this world. What I really love is the Ablama Rice Curry. They described it as 'kind of like an Arabic Biriyani'. It's a perfect mix of Indian and Lebenese spices and pretty light on the stomach. The Chicken pieces were soft and delectable. On our latest visit, me and a friend tried the Mutton Chelo Kebab and the Citizen's Shwarma Platter. Both were, sadly, disappointing. The Chelo Kebab was terrible. There was a mutton kebab on a stick, which did not taste anything like a kebab. The mutton was way overcooked and chewy. It had no flavour at all. The rice (the Ablama rice, I'm guessing) tasted nothing out of the ordinary. The pita breads in the Shwarma Platter were hard. Even the mayonnaise on the side tasted weird. The chicken pieces were the only saving grace of the dish.
Service is pretty good and fast. The waiters are polite and knowledgble about the food.

This is a very cozy place just amidst many eateries at lake garden. I ordered a doner kabab burger, which was enough to satisfy my hunger. It tasted pretty decent. The ambiance and decor is very fresh, but not very spacious. So if you have s big group, you might wanna rethink. The cost is okayish, not towards the extremes.

One of my fav places for lebanese food,located at the Lords Bakery crossing, a small joint with a seating capacity of max 10,it surely makes up for the space constraint with its epicsome food and good service but yes guys please improve the quality of music.Coming to food we ordered I Chicken Lebanese Tawook ,1 burger, 1 garlic dip and Arabic pickles.

The burger was well made and the stuffing had ample quantity which will surely suffice one,a noticeable fact was even though the bun was lightly baked it wasn't crumbling or breaking off which is a good indication of its quality.

The Lebanese tawook is served with pita breads which goes well with the garlic dip. The sauteing was extremely well done as the spices were very much ingrained in the chicken and it simply sinful once you dig into it,relishing every single bite topped up with the pita breads with a spread of the garlic dip. 

Service wise the staff inform and help you out to the hilt in your choice

Coming to the pricing its very much moderately priced and justified as per the food served both in regard to quality and quantity.

My little sister has a all-month -lebanese phase going on and keeps running off to Shawarma nation to get her food packed and drags me along.
Me being a 'Go Lebanese' loyalist did not want to ¬†go anywhere else but I did . .luckily.
This place offers a lot of options in food and that is a good thing.
The shawarma wrap comes in 3 sizes which is another thing I liked(you can choose according to your degree of hunger :)) and the prices are most reasonable . The shawarma salad is good though I felt that the filling coud be a biiit less liquidy and less sweet too( again only a bit).
What I absolutely loved was their Arabic biriyani. .different in taste and nicely made. Do try it people.
I should also mention that both their service and home delivery is very quick (you could try it since the actual place is quite tiny).
Want to try a lot more . Going back soon.

I am in love with almost all the items that they prepare. 
Chicken Arabic Biriyani, Lebanese sheesh touk, chicken shawarma, shawarma salad, sub-sandwiches, are the items I have tried and liked all of them. 
The staffs are very polite and are always ready to serve. 
I have been to this place quite a number of times, and would continue to do so in the future too... :)

THE BIRIYANI WAS STALE ., AS IF IT WAS MADE LONG AGO, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TASTELESS , HEAVILY LOADED WITH KEORA AND GULAB WATER SPRINKLE. THE CHICKEN WAS SOUR . IT WAS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION SHOULD TAKE THESE KIND OF RESTAURANT TO TASK AND PENALIZE THEM FOR PROVIDING STALE FILTHY FOOD.

Apart from the quantity of food they serve and the crispy babycorn which is eternally soggy and never crispy, the rest are just fine and the smoothie is good. do try if you are looking for just a cozy, comfy meal and dont want to go out too far but stay clear from ordering the babycorn

Located at a very convenient place, easy to locate by hungry people who are looking out for good food within minutes. The food is really good here. The seating arrangement is a little small but 8 to 10 people can be entertained. The food you will have here might leave you craving for more. Shwarma rolls and other delicacies offered here are quite a treat. Even the chutney served by the side is quite a delight. But the only thing that has me puzzled is the little amount of veges they provide by the side. They aren't that bad but the quantity is too little to enjoy. This is one place you will enjoy. If ever in the locality, do treat yourself.

The Shawarma is great. The food is light yet filling. The quantity is good too. This place may be small but it is cosy. Besides, if you don't find space inside, there is always space outside, in the chairs. I would say eating in the street is worth it when the food is good. Another favourite haunt of mine.

Situated at Lords more, the bright decor is easy to spot. I recently went there after a year and was fairly happy to see that they have added more variety to their menu. Our order was a Lebanese Tawook , Shawarma salad, mango smoothie and pineapple smoothie . 

The tawook was soft and delicious. Same goes for the salad. Mango smoothie was good while pineapple tasted like cough syrup. 

Nevertheless if you want to eat Lebanese  , this place is a must try. :) 

Happy eating !

Something about this place appeals to my inner foodie and I would have given this place a higher rating but then I thought I should review this place just like any other place. So based on the fact that they serve the food in disposable thermocol plates I decided to cut back my initial 4.5 star rating. Also, sometimes their service takes a bit long especially if you order their yummy tawook! So i toned it down a bit! :P But really, there is nothing to complain about! Everything is easy on the pocket (perfect for those birthday treats!) And their shawarma wraps, salads and burgers really do extinguish your hunger! the mayo is a bit of a put off for some people as they use it in an extreme manner but as a foodie i LOVE it! One of my all time favorites! Go and check it out for yourself!

I visited this place few months back with three friends of mine after a hopeless window shopping trip to South City mall. As four hungry souls entered this place, we were pretty surprised to find a sitting arrangement, however small, with each table lined with a hand sanitizer. The staff is friendly and prompt with suggestions. The service is quick. Now, coming to the food, their shawarma wrap is just 80 bucks with no extra tax charges which is comparably cheaper than other lebanese joints mushroomed in every nook and corner of the city. We settled for two shawarma wraps , two jumbo shawarma wrap and a lebaneh chicken burger.¬†

The shawarma wrap is pretty filling. It was overflowing with their delicious mayo, which tasted out of the world. There was a generous amount of chicken pieces which were soft and succulent with perfectly balanced spices and veggies. The jumbo shawarma wrap was the same , but as the name suggests, just larger in size.¬†
The lebaneh burger surprised us even more. It was huge in size and each and every bite just melts in your mouth. The chicken cutlet used inside was huge and tasty with just the right amount of lebanese touch.¬†

As we left, our hungry soul was fully satisfied not just with the food but also with the prices. I have to try out their other lebanese delicacies next time I visit.

I usually fulfill my shawarma cravings from "Go Lebanese" and I am pretty much loyal to the place cause I somehow believe that no lebanese joint can make shawarma as delicious as them...and its only on a friend's suggestion that shawarma nation makes better shawarma than go lebanese, and seeing the rave reviews on zomato, that I visited this place today. Well it just goes on to show that how well placed my belief is, cause,in short,the shawarma wrap of this place SUCKS big time!
The original recommendation of this place also included that this place has a well air conditioned dine in place, but when I went in today with three of my friends, the 1st thing I noticed was that the AC wasn't on (on account of winter season, am sure) and that was making the insides of the eating area quite warm and overwhelming. This is on account of the fact that the kitchen area on the side does not have an air tight separation from the eating area. The owner and staff should have taken this into account and kept the AC on, even if on mild cooling settings. Next is the ambience about which I dont have much to complain cause for a small food joint,this place does well enough on ambience and though the eating area is quite small, the seating arrangement gives a kind of a cozy feel. Me and my friends ordered a jumbo shawarma wrap apiece and a chicken doner kebab. The orders came quick enough, within an odd 5-7mins. 1st came the doner kebab and a nibble from it kindled my spirits that this was going to be a worthwhile foodtrip, but the very next moment a taste of the green chutney provided on the side made me doubt my previous feeling of elation cause the chutney just was not decent enough. Next came the jumbo shawarma wrap and apparently it lived up to its name cause it was bigger than any shawarma wrap I have ever had but that had a catch which I was to find out later. Full marks for presentation though cause the thing looks good when put in front of you. A little taste of the white sauce before actually digging into the wrap made me realise that the white sauce was quite bland and the green chutney provided on the side was the same one provided with the doner kebab and hence I didn't have any high hopes from it. We shared the doner kebab before digging into our large wraps. The doner kebab tasted good and since I dont have a reference frame to compare it with, I can't really rate it but it tasted well enough to me. Next,on taking a bite from my wrap did I realise just how bad it was. The chicken shawarma wasn't really tasty and the bland white sauce mentioned before didn't help either. But the thing I realised is, it keeps getting worse cause as I proceeded towards the end of the wrap, chicken pieces kept getting scarce and I was just getting a mouthful of veggies with every bite and not all of these veggies complement the taste of a shawarma wrap neither. I now realised the catch of the jumboness of this "jumbo" shawarma wrap and that is "less chicken and a veggie dump". In fact I have had shawarma salads with less veggies in them. Even one my friends agreed with me that she'd had better shawarma wraps elsewhere. On my way back home I saw a caption on a random poster in the metro which said,"large and lost" and realised how apt a description it was for the "jumbo" shawarma wrap of shawarma nation, large in size and lost on the taste! I am giving 0.5 rating more for the doner kebab which I felt was decent enough, else I would have given just a 2 for the great disappointment of a shawarma wrap this place treated me with. Needless to say, am never going back to this place! NEVER EVER!

A small air conditioning eatery which serves tasteful lebanese cuisine. The place is clean and hygienic with each table provided with a hand sanitizer. The price is cheap and the servings are sufficient. The chicken oriental salad and chicken shawarma salad are my favourites. The lebaneh chicken burger is yet another favourite. From the main course chicken tawook is good. This place has a drawback that after 8 pm most of its items are out of stock. .....

With a lot of Lebanese joints springing up here and there in the city, this place manages to hold its ground. Service is fast and they have a small, cozy yet uncomfortable seating arrangement. Staff are friendly and decent.
About the food, the shawarma salad and roll are decent and does real number on your rate buds. What I love more though is the Chicken Submarine and the Chicken Burger, which are out of this world, in terms of taste, quantity and price. And it being near my home is also an added advantage.

Right at Lords More, this is a small place but packs great treasures.¬†
Oh Man, it has been so many times I have eaten here already over last few months. An auto ride from Jadavpur University in the evening occasionally, I come here to have the BEST Lebanese Food in the city. No, I am not exaggerating. After having tried the Lebanese Go,Royals and Junction, this is undoubtedly the best.
This is good food as well as cheap. For rs 100, you get a small sized Shawarma Roll elsewhere, but here you get a Jumbo Shawarma Roll, which is very bigger and yummier too.
I strongly recommend the Chicken Ablama Rice Curry and Arabian Biriyani. Very authentic Lebanese cuisine and you get a different taste to your buds which are usually used to Bengali food.
The Doner Kebab i strongly suggest while the Lebanese Burger is a so-so.
The people there are very helpful and give wonderful suggestions when asked. The place maybe a bit small but it comfortable inside with good air and music flowing around.¬†
A must visit to all. Passionately Recommended.
If only it had branches elsewhere :)

my father wanted to try lebanese food and having tasted go lebanese and turkus already i decided to go for shawarma nation this time. located at lake gardens crossing on prince anwar shah road, i thought instead of visiting, lets try if they deliver to my place, jadavpur. hence, called them up and they told it would be free home delivery - nice :)

i ordered 2 jumbo chicken shawarmas along with a full chicken lebanese tawook kebab. ordering process was smooth. i provided my address and they recognized instantly having delivered at the same location before. i ordered at 9:25pm and the food was delivered hot at 10:05pm. this was good for a busy saturday night.

coming to the jumbo shawarma first, as it's name suggests, it's really huge! stuffed with decent amount of chicken and mayonese, it's a delight for food lovers. the pita bread was soft and the veggie fillings all tasted fresh. chicken lebanese tawook was smoky and tangy, grilled perfectly well. a full portion had 11-13 pieces and it was great.

the brief encounter was promising, hence. would love to visit the restaurant next and try out the other items soon.

it's only a 1 min walk down the stairs to the joint and it's probably the best labanese joint.. i visited about 70 to 80 times and every time i go here this place provides me with yummilecious food..the cost is quite low and you can enjoy the true¬† flavours of laban...the texture loaded swarma to pasty and rich hummus...from tender kebabs to grilled tawook....from drinks to even the shakes are a1 ...love it

Location :- Its near Lords more. Easy to locate .

Ambience:- Probably the only Lebanese joint with proper seating area. Though small but enough spacious for 10ppl to seat comfortably.

Food:- They have lot of variety on there on their menu and one can have a full course meal here. The main usb of the food is their meyonese sauce which is damn tasty and all the frying is done in olive oil. Chicken is well marinated and tasty. Pita breads r thin and served hot.

Pocket pinch :- 250 for two

Conclusion :- Probably the best Lebanese joint in south kolkata and the proper seating area adds to their credit.

Visited this place just yesterday. It's cute and small sitting pretty right at Lord's crossing. My friend and I went inside and ordered two chicken shawrmas which were served pretty quickly. The shawrma was shredded chicken, fresh veggies and a creamy mayonnaise wrapped inside pita bread. It was rich, yummylicious and fulfilling in every bite. I just couldn't get enough of it. A special mention goes to the mayo, it's one of the tastiest mayonnaise I have ever tasted. Definitely going back for more!!

Shawarma nation is just a surprise which lake gardens holds for you.

Location: The location is so prominent that it can hardly get unnoticed unless you are high !. It is located right opposite to lords bakery more..beside manmohan sweets.

Food: I tried just a shawarma and I would officially refer to it as 'the out of the world moment'. The shawarma is a lebanese delicacy and SN did a complete justice to it.The chicken was tender with properly sauted onions and salads.Hummus is THE most important part of a shawarma as it gives a certain level of texture and makes it juicy and hummus at SN was blended to perfection with a pinch of sugar providing a different context to the entire preparation.They provide green chutney which I tastes good but not required in my opinion

Price : The price is moderate ...I would appreciate if the price was under Rs eighty..

Suggestion : This is a niche fast food joint in lake gardens .It would be great if the sitting place was bigger.

My recent food crush LEBANESE. As usual shawarma my fev. We visited this place 3days ago. Small cozy place. Liked the name. Ordered lebaneh chicken burger and citizen's shawarma platter. Burger was like really wow bettr than macD in my opinion. May b i liked it this much because of my recent crush on Lebanese. Any ways platter comes with lots of things like baba ghannouj ,Chicken nuggets, Humus, pita bread, chicken chunks, xtra meyo, salad...platter was kinda awesome u can test most of the items in a single ordered dish. Food was good. The only thing that left a negative mark was that as we were the only customer at that time. They refused to turn on the ac. Kinda rude. But as a Lebanese food fan a big thumbsup.

First of all I am editing this review for the second time, generally I don't do this but this time I can't resist myself. What I want to say is when I visited there for the first time I tried shawarma salad, and no doubt it tasted good. After that whenever I visited there I ate that particular dish. After that I shifted to arabic chicken biryani, and yes it is good. But sorry to say recently the shawarma salad doesn't tastes like before. They give some kind of orange coloured sauce which is not at all good. I don't know what happened to them suddenly. I used to love this shop for a quick snack but now I hardly go there. My friends even don't encourage me to go there. Don't know what to say. Hope I will get back the old shawarma nation.

Shawarma Nation is a small good shop.......few days ago I went there with my friend & I surprised that there is no food available in their menu card.......everything they say not available, so we ultimately decided to leave the shop but change our mind and order a lebanah fried chicken. Really its change our mind into happiness simply awesome. They serve it with sauce which transform the food into a superior quality.

SAVED OUR DAY !! Finally got time to share my feedback :)

We first discovered this small Food Joint just at Lake Gardens Crossing during the Durga Puja' 13.¬†

We were pretty hungry and wished to try something delicious for our dinner considering the fact that it should be pocket friendly.¬†

So, we looked for Chowman ( 2 Hrs Waiting Required ), Mom I Am ( Closed - Renovation ) and many other restaurants but couldn't wait due to long queue.

After all we found this "LEBANESE Heaven". Guys, this is the best 'Lebanese Food Joint' in Kolkata.

We ordered:

* Crispy Chilli Babycorn @60 ( then ) - 'Best in the town'
* Mussakan @100 - 'Lord of Shawarma'
* Chicken Lebanese Tawook @150 - ' God's it was utter delicious'
* Lebaneh Fried Chicken @140 - ' This was a bit crispy and salty to an extent. '
* Tahini Dip @15 - A full bowl of Mayonnaise ( din't imagine that paying 15 rupees only you can have lot of Mayonnaise unlike POOR

Its a cute little place. Seating is limited though. one thing that i found to be nice was that they keep small bottles of hand sanitiser on each of their tables. Pretty thoughtful actually. Service is reasonably prompt. The menu is well spaced out. I liked the wraps more than the burgers. For some reason the lebaneh chicken burger ¬†I tried just wasn't as good as the other items I tried. The citizen's shawarma platter was great stuff. The food is pretty good and seems healthy enough with good taste. And its really decent pricing. Shouldn't be a problem to grab a bite while in the vicinity. The only weird thing is that they don't seem to have any wash basin for the patrons. Its actually tiny on space. But the food is really great. So people, give it a try. You wont regret it.

Nice shawarma joint right on the Lords Bakery crossing. I ordered for the chicken salad which comes with pita bread. The salad was a nice, tasty and juicy mix of shredded chicken, vegetables and mayo. I took a pineapple smoothie along with that.
Pros- good food, quick service, not too costly
Cons- the sitting place is a bit too cramped for space.
Overall a good food joint everyone should try out atleast once.

Despite swearing off Lebanese food due to the steady decline of quality in the popular Shawarma joints, I still ventured into this restaurant with fingers crossed. I ordered the Jumbo Shawarma Wrap.

To be honest, the sauce looked a little curdled to me at first. But when I tasted it, it was fine and had a perfectly smooth and silky texture. Plus one, for that. The chicken is not like the big cubes or slices I have had in other places, it is almost crumbled. But I liked it nonetheless. There were big slices of onion in the wrap, which I didn't like at all. Next time I'll be sure to ask them to avoid them. They had plenty of veggies in the wrap. The cabbage was julienned finely and I liked the addition of what I thought was shreds of lettuce, but I could be wrong. The size of the Shawarma was pretty big; its much bigger than the skimpy roll Royal Lebanese serves these days.

The place is slightly cramped, but not uncomfortable and it is pretty tidy. It can seat about 7-8 people.¬†

Overall, a good Shawarma joint.

Though I am yet to taste their Shawarma, still I quite liked the foods those I ordered. The Chicken Shish Tawook and Chicken Lebanese Tawook were quite good - the typical flavor of Mediterranean cuisines were prominent, much to my likings... Kebabs, slightly different than what we are used to in having. Their Arabic Biryani is also quite recommendable (Hyderabadi Biryani) - light, not that oily with generous chicken pieces and not so spicy either as is typical with Hyderabadi Biryanis. Overall, a good experience...

Despite its name, shawarmas at Shawarma Nation disappointed me to a great extent. The bread was raw and the sauces were extremely sour, as though they were expired. My first visit to this place marked it as my last visit too because the quality of food served was below standard and when requested for either an extra spoon or a tissue, the attitude with which it was received was extremely poor.

I started to be a fan of lebanese food after I tasted the same at a famous lebanese restaurant at Bangaluru where I loved grilled chicken,  alfaham chicken and chicken Shawarma. 
In kolkata I was a bit disappointed trying lebanese food in some places as I went with high expectations.  
Location : Shawarma nation is located at a very nice and decent location of prince anwar shah road within 500mtrs of south city mall.
Ambience : a bit crampy and conjested if one decided to sit and have food.
Food and price: food is good not great! Shawarma wrap is nice, can be done better. Grilled chicken is different from what I had earlier.  But I liked it as it was boneless.  Price is quiet reasonable.  Wont burn holes in pocket. 
Serving : service is quick and people have knowledge of what they serve.

Overall experience is good, as my partner tasted lebanese for the first time and he is now in absolute love for lebanese food!

Passed this restaurant many times on our way to south city, until one day we decided to visit it. The inside is small, but cozy; probably fit for around 10-12 people. We ordered two chicken shawarmas first, along with one smoothie and a lemon-mint cooler. Shawarmas were big, and very filling. However, just one downside, the garlic sauce was not mixed very evenly, so at some places it tasted kind of like a chicken roll. The smoothie was good, however, the lemon-mint cooler had too much mint in it and wasn't very cold, so that tasted a bit weird. For main course we ordered one chicken oriental salad along with a mutton chello kebab. The salad was served with pita bread. But at this point, the meal turned out to be too much for two people. So we finished up just the salad, and left the mutton chello kebab almost untouched. It tasted more like an ordinary mutton curry and rice dish anyway. The pocket pinch was very reasonable, around 500 for two. There is a lot of room for improvement there, also a few desserts will be more than welcome, but it's a good place to visit if you know what to order. In short, will be visiting again.

I am a huge fan of Lebanese cuisine and often i crave for the same. When i came across this joint i instantly decided to try it out. Me and my friends ordered chicken shawarma wrap and chicken shawarma salad. I would like to say here that the joint is a pocket friendly one and the quantity they serve is satisfactory but taste wise i have had better be it the wrap or the salad. The salad was not at all up to the mark when compared with the other salads that i have had but the wrap was better than the salad. I personally would like a bit more sauce in the shawarma wrap because otherwise it made the wrap quite dry and it was becoming difficult to swallow it at the end. Hence, if am nearby this place i could visit this to try out the other items but may be not these two.

Situated in a very convenient place. A must visit place.

The heart of the shawarma is the meat, seasoned and stacked on a vertical spit where it slowly rotates, roasting and self-basting for hours until tender and juicy. All sorts of other goodies, including pickled vegetables, tahini, hummus, tomatoes, cucumber, cabbage, and even French fries are added to the stuffing with the meat.
Would highly recomment this place to all lebanese and shawarma lovers.

Great place for Lebanese Food n one of those few Lebanese outlet in Kolkata where they keep track of cleanliness, hygiene along with quality of food.
Date of Visit 25th August 2014

--LOCATION--
Very Close to South City Mall,found this place while returning from South City to Rabindra Sarobar metro station..This place is a bit small n hard to find but Good Guy Zomato provides the call number, So call them up..

--AMBIENCE--
Its more of a snack corner with 3tables all placed closely to each other, but the walls are beautifully painted n it was clear they do a lot to keep those tables n walls clean, hand sanitizers were placed on each table.Check out my uploaded photos on zomato to get a clear idea..

--ORDERED--
1* Chicken Shawarma Salad - 120inr
1* Chicken Lebanese Tawook - 150inr

--QUALITY N QUANTITY--
Now comes to quality, well they are Delicious,was perfectly cooked n was great, first time i tasted tawook n i was not disappointed, they tasted too good, n that Lebanese tawook is still stuck on my taste buds, those wete just awesome n speaking of Quantity
Shawarma Salad was enough to fill a man's appetite n so does Tawook

--PRICING--
The pricing was moderate, they dont apply extra Tax on the items n was reasonable for items they were providing..

--BEHAVIOR OF THE STAFF--
The place might be small but the staff were loaded, might be they get huge orders, i dont know but the behavior was nice n cooperative..

The only negative thing about this place is probably the size of the place otherwise its perfect in everything.

So in conclusion i loved this place, probably the best Lebanese outlet in Kolkata n i cant wait for the next visit..

Shawarma Nation is a small eatery located on Lords more crossing. It has 4 or 5 small tables & i did find it congested. I went there at around 2 pm and all the tables were full. I had to wait for 15 mins to get a seat. Now coming to the food. I got better than what i had expected. I ordered Chicken shawarma salad and man was that yum ! The arabic bread was so soft and it just melted in my mouth. The quantity was great. The shawarma was full of chicken chunks, veggies & mayonnaise. The food was healthy & tasted great. The staff was polite. I also noticed that the kitchen was clean but i would surely suggest that the cook should wear cap and gloves so that hygiene is maintained. Overall i am satisfied with their food and service. Taking everything into consideration i am rating SHAWARMA NATION 3.5

This is one of those food joints which you would blink and miss. It's at Lords crossing, diagonally opposite the Monginis store. The interior is really small and can hardly seat 6-7 people at a time. However,  I liked the bright green color on the walls. One more thing I liked is that they have hand sanitizers on each table. That's kind of a nice touch and realky helps fight all kinds of germs and infection. 
I ordered for a large chicken shawarma and a lemon cooler (I dnt remember the exact name). The cooler was really refreshing on a hot summer day. It packed the punch and the zest of citrus fruits that is much required in this hot weather. The shawarma was nice, had quite a lot of veggies and sweet mayo. However, I always think that a tahini paste would go much better with a shawarma than the mint dip which all shawarma joints serve. Infact, I found the shawarma to be better than that of Royal Lebanese at Gariahat. I how to try the other items on the menu, especially the  kebabs.

Visited Shawarma Nation when I was really hungry. I went in was very happy to see they have AC and cosy sitting areas. The place was neat and clean and ordered 1 Shawarma Salad and 1 Wrap for a friend. The place seemed pretty popular as they were floating crowd in and out and hardly 1 place or two was empty for the entire period of our stay. I looked around and became more happy to find their declaration on menus that Shawarma in 96% Fat Free and that they cook their food in Olive Oil. We didn't have to wait much as it is an up and running joint. We were served the Wrap and the salad. The quantity was a lot and the taste was good. My salad was served with a Pita bread that made it very filling. The wrap was moist and tasty too. We were very happy after the food and two of us talked less and ate more, now that says a lot about any food. The price of the salad was 120 and wrap was 95 inclusive of taxes. So, after a shopping at south city, shawarma nation can be a good place for a quick and filling bite for all!!

From our way back to home from South City, we decided to have a bite from this lebanese joint.  
When we entered into this joint, I noticed that this place is bit claustrophobic but, we managed to have our seats. 
We had chicken swarma wrap ( three) and chicken murg biriyani (two). Chicken swarma wrap was good and had sufficient mayonnaise and chicken filling inside. Chicken murgh biriyani was also good in terms of both quality and quantity.  It has been served with Raita. 
As a whole, it is nice to have a bite over there as it is not so expensive.  I like to mention the fact that they don't accept cards which really put me off as it was raining outside and I had to visit ATM.

Finally, a shawarma joint near my home! Well, I'm crazy about this Lebanese wrap and before the existence of this place, the only source of good shawarma for me was the food court inside Spencer's at South City. But thanks to Shawarma Nation, now I can have it delivered at home whenever I want! So, I'm happy, happy, happy!
The Shawarma has enormous amount of filling which makes it quite fulfilling and the taste is Y-U-M. Apart from this, the eatery has a lot of variety in Lebanese food. Their Chicken Musakkan is also worth trying out. And the prices are quite reasonable as well. So, if Shawarma is your thing, then do give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed.

Situated at Lord's crossing this small place is like "chota packet bara dhamaka". Shawarma nation sells Lebenese food.....yummy Lebenese food.
I tried: Chicken Arabic Biryani, Chicken Lebenese Tawook, Chicken Shawarma and Chicken Shish Tawook. 
The Arabic biryani is a treat and for those figure conscious individuals it's 95% or 96% fat free. What makes is more amazing is the raita they offer with it.
The shawarma wrap is made of a very soft bread so gives you that melt - in - the - mouth experience. 
The Tawook were wonderful especially for a KFC exploited tongue.
Try it

Located at the Lords crossing this joint is just 6 months old and as it has opened up in a conservative and small set up..hence notany ppl can spot it in the first go. Its got eat in,take away and delivery options. Food is very very good with Arabic and Lebanese delights...likes of Doner Kabab,Mussakan, Babaganoush, and of course shawarma is there of course...Very reasonable...very tasty...its got some Arabian coolers as well like the lime and mint cooler ...overall its a very nice joint fr a quick snack or grab...

have been here many times, it's a very tiny food joint. the interior space is painted green-yellow & closely fitted. they serve some simply awesome Lebanese savories in quite low price (despite providing with ac comfort). but the place is too small to accommodate many & i have seen people to take food home mostly. the chicken lebanese roll & the shawarma wraps are most popular, but i have also tried the hummus & tawooks - the chicken lebanese & sish tawook  & also the mussakkan. but what i loved really was the chicken doner kebab & tawooks ( though they are a bit too dry, but then that brings in the perfect lebanese flavor). as always i personally prefer the shawarma salad to the wraps (they are usual here). i have had a bitter sweet experience here - while ordering for the falafel,i wanted the dumbling & definitely not the wrap, but i was served one with the wrap. either the staffs were ignorant or they ran short. otherwise they are friendly. but day by day i find many such items unavailable at the store & also the stuffs are too less informed to guide you with the cuisines. last time i tasted the lebanese biryani & it was a disappointment! so i have chosen to stick to the usual hummus & shawarma salads hereafter.

Enjoyed my food here, food is great also very affordable. Take away and home delivery also available. Though the place is small, but the food is good. Service is not good. I had alabama biriyani here. My friend had something else. The waiters had a busy time seeing their phones. Instead of listening to us. It was very irritating when i had to call for someone several times to get a glass of water.

Extremely easy to locate. Situated right at the Lords crossing, this tiny place is a delight to begin with. It serves Lebanese food. The shawarma wrap and salad both are the most popular and most frequently ordered dish. Food comes at a decent price and the food quality is good. However the most striking thing going in it's favor is the level of hygiene they maintain. They have hand sanitizers placed on every table. :) Definitely a pocket friendly and student friendly place :)

This place just made me fall in love with lebanese delicacies . On a number of visits I have tried their sawarma wrap, falafal wrap, falafal dumpling, Hummus, Chicken Shish Tawook, Chicken Lebanese Tawook. And mostly I have loved them all. The food is fresh, you can see them preparing in the super neat kitchen.  Another add-on is all their preps are cooked in olive oil, now thats healthy. Eating out with an health benefit sounds good isnt it?
Their wraps are seriously great and a mixed salad they complementarity give with all the starters is equally awesome. The tawooks were perfectly grilled and tasted great. I am not very fond of the falafal, because I found it a bit too oily. Otherwise I have no complaints exceot their limited seating space, I really wish it had been enough to hold at least 20 people at a time.

I have no idea of the "Non-Vegetarian" items the Lake-Gardens/Lords-Area outlet has. I have had Egg-Submarine and Veg Falafel a few times (being in the States I know how popular the latter and Sam's Falafel are as 'alternative' (and Vegan) street-foods esp in NYC). Here they use Garlic paste instead of Hummus; Falafel balls are not the same quality; Veg fillings are hardly any with cheap lettuce/cabbage and JUST ZERO quantities of tomatoes and any other veg. Last time I bought, the roll was small and even came loose before I could have, a complete mess. The main guy who sits at the counter (slightly dark, and a bit on the shorter side, don't know his name) is a decent chap but the rest are opportunistic c-graders who are just there to do minimal to no work the moment there is no manager to mind them and monitor what they do.

I had a shawarma-crazy phase about an year ago and my partner has been taking me to different Lebanese joints over time.We have visited Shawarma Nation first when it had just opened its doors, offering a fat-free food option which tasted different.We have been trying their various items and found the mussakkan very guilt-free appetizing.Recently, they have come up with some newer items and we decided to try them out last evening.We wanted a tuna shawarma, was actually thrilled at the concept,but unfortunately it is no longer available. So we settled with a chicken shawarma salad and a harissa wrap.The salad was very regular- chicken,cabbage,onion,tomato,capsicum in a mayo dressing - tasted like any regular salads we have,nothing Lebanese except that it was served with pita bread. The harissa wrap was more like a roll in a pita bread : it tasted nice, spicier with the chicken sauteed over the heat and some mint chutney on the pita; a cross between kathi roll and a chicken shawarma in my  opinion but tasted good.Among the drinks, i have had lebnah sometime back and it tasted cool and refreshing and ofcourse yogurty. 
Shawarma Nation had emerged as a very promising venture.Prices are at par with the other Lebanese places and they attempt to offer a wider selection than just the shawarma wrap or salad.If you are bored with the mayo-laden shawarmas, visiting this place is a good option as taste-wise chances of disappointment is slim.

"Big things come in small packages"- for shawarma nation. A small, shop situated at the heart of Lords more which provides tasty Lebanese at very reasonable prices. Quantity is more than what they charge. But the quality varies. At times the chicken is fresh and at times it is not.

I friend of mine took me to this place yesterday. To be honest, I had my doubts at first but as soon as I entered I was greeted with a lovely green and white interior. They say green is good for the eyes and stimulates a good appetite. Anyhow, next up was the food. We ordered the Shawarma Wrap after going through the menu. Unfortunately I wasn't carrying enough cash so that was the only thing I could try(otherwise I probably would have ordered a smoothie too).

Coming back to the food. I was satisfied with the wrap, which is more of what I can say for the mayonnaise though. I just loved how perfect the mayonnaise felt. Unfortunately the texture of the sauce was a bit on the watery side which I wish they'd improve on eventually. All in all, I'd love to visit this place soon with a fuller wallet and a not so full stomach. I'll probably re-rate this place after I try a few more of their offerings.
--------
Okay, this was my second trip to the place and I was satisfied with the service. This time round I ordered a Lebanese Chicken Burger along with a mango smoothie. The burger was pretty good but lacked enough mayonnaise in it or maybe I just love mayonnaise a bit too much. In any case, just a bit more mayonnaise would have been great. Coming to the smoothie, I was kind of dissatisfied with the whole smoothie experience. Firstly I was on the go and needed to take it away instead of having it there so what they did was put it in a round plastic bowl like thingie which was not at all convenient. I mean I had to literally drink it out of a bowl with a straw. Coming to taste of it, well, wasn't really the best I had in my life. Could have been a lot better and also a plastic glass would have been appreciated instead of a bowl for which I was charged an extra 10 bucks.

Service is fast, but yes space is a bit congested though can't complain as its a food joint. 

Just one suggestion is Card Payment facility can be started.

But otherwise...no no complain :)

Wanted to try the items on the menu so walked in today into this outlet. Food is moderately priced.  We ordered for a Shawarma Salad and a Chicken Doner Kabab. The salad was ok but nothing great. I have had better tasting stuff in bangalore for cheaper prices. The Chicken Doner Kabab looked like Chicken Shawarma Salad in a bun. It tasted a bit too sweet for my taste. That's ok but the fact that it was served in a stale bread was something which was unacceptable. Moreover I even found a piece of uncooked chicken in it. 

All in all this was most probably my first and last visit to this place.

Tightly squeezed into a corner at Lord's Crossing (beside Cheeni Kum) this small yet funky eatery is a thumbs up for ever hungry Calcuttans who want for a quick sip & bite. Offering a decent picks between lebanese chicken sandwich to shawarma roll to a glasss of chilled lemonade, this place offers offers everything to start an hour long adda with friends relaxing in coolness (thanks its air conditioned).  I tried Jumbo Shawarma Roll with which one gets a lemonade absolutely free!! And then I tried Chicken Submarine & Chicken Lebasese sandwich which all tastes great!! Only if the place could have been much spacious I would have given it more...the tight space often proves to be frustating for those who are waiting outside wanting desperately to get in. But all in all its an awesome place with yummy rolls & wraps & some cool sips. What more can you ask for??!! So don't wait & visit it asap!!

‚ÄúIf more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.‚Äù 
Simple, compact and focused solely on the endeavor of serving food without being distracted by other things. Being a vegan, I am ignorant of the pleasures of the palette of Lebanese cuisine, yet Shawarma Nation does not fail us grass eaters. Their paneer+biryani is a dish worth killing for and the chief steward is an amiable man who goes out of his way to offer the best advice in regards to food. 
So. Why is SN an outpost for Lebanese cuisine?
-Because the food is delicious.
-Because the food that is served is way better than the price that it is sold for.
-Because the concept of utility is taken very seriously. It may be a small place, but it does not lack in any sphere for an eatery.
-Because the menu offers a large variety of choices.

Shawarma Nation! Been wanting to come here for a while, and finally have with A, who's a major Lebanese food addict! The ambience is nice and bright and pretty clean too - impressive for a small restaurant! Quite soon after we ordered, a most DELICIOUS smell wafted out to us from the kitchen. The waiter appeared with a free lemon iced tea (in return for the review I was penning). Our Non-veg platter followed almost immediately afterwards. Oh. My. God. I think I just got converted to the Lebanese food cult. The chicken, the bread, the hummus are sheer perfection. Even A, the connoisseur, pronounced it to be exquisite! That's the first thing he said! And I could write a poem about the chicken shish tawook that followed. The garlic dip, hummus and soft Arabic bread were spot on. Honestly, I would never have thought that this little outlet would dish up such fantastic delicacies! 
Shawarma Nation, you need to expand. Big-time. Lebanese cuisine is making its presence felt in Kolkata and we need way more eateries like this - great food at low prices. Ten stars!!

When you have so many Lebanese options to choose from,why this place?
-Coz the food here is 96% fat free
-Coz you may get some in store offer running
-Coz the prices are competitive and the quality is quite good when you consume it as a health food
-Coz they have a smart space utilization where you get to have your meal in an ac room with hand sanitizers on every table to compensate for the lack of basin.
-Coz it's close to south city
-and finally coz they have a good variety of dishes on the menu,so you get a good idea about the cuisine and enjoy every bite!

Went there after hearing a lot of hypes from some of my friends.But it failed to live up to that expectation. Shawarmas which were supposed to be the main attraction was a let down.  The pita breads tasted a bit dry,Chicken fillings tasted a bit overcooked but they served a fruity kinda dip alongside which was a surprise hit and helped us to clean the plates with its tangy twist. But then we ordered the Lebanese Tawooks and they were so good that we almost forgot the shawarma debacle..
Other than that, the ACs were not working the day we visited which they said that it broke down that day only. Overall, A descent experience,not that good and I would suggest that if u want to have only Shawarma then Go to Royal Lebanese which makes  superior Shawarmas.

This place is small but easy to find and a good one for a quick bite.It has opened some time ago and has a pretty decent footfall  due to its location.The shawarma wrap here tastes nice,and the sauces they serve with it has a very good tangy taste that you are bound to love with your wrap.The arabic chicken biryani they serve is a bit different in taste as I felt,and also tastes good.The crispy baby corn also, is a good one on the menu.Overall the experience in my visits to this place has so far been nice.
The people serving food are ready to help.But the space crunch is a let down.And specially if you get the seats near the door,you might be sitting right in front of the music speakers which is bound to disturb you after sometime..
Note:If you visit this place you might find a note on the wall saying-Rate us on zomato within 15minutes of placing your order and win a complimentary ice tea!!!!!
I don't know if it works,as I didn't try it :P

_______________________________________________________________________________________

So,went back here again for a couple of times. But now,they are lagging a bit I felt. I had their Jumbo Chicken shawarma wrap which as expected,was loaded with more chicken,but lagged the mayo which was quite less in amount. Otherwise the taste was okay. I also tried their grilled Lebanese Chicken Tawook which was great both in amount (10 pieces) and taste. Overall satisfactory.
But now they do not serve regular water anymore.So one must make sure that he/she is ready to buy local mineral water they serve or carry their own. Happy Eating :)

It's simply a blessing to have Shawarma Nation located nearby. What they put in front you is brilliant and the fact that you can actually watch them prepare your meal is a treat in itself. The shawarma, chicken salad are yummily delicious, makes you wanna go back and try all of their preparations. The only thing not-so-worth-it is the space. It can only accommodate 6/7 people. :( foodwise 4/5 but .5 deducted because of the space factor. Waiting to see more Shawarma nation outlets in the city.

I made a wishlist of eating placs to visit after returning to Kolkata and this was one of them.. Located conviniently near Lords More( Lake Gardens) this place is not difficult to locate especially for ppl who r regular to South City Mall. Yes, I admit that I was not in Kolkata for quite some time and havent tried other Lebanese joints that have come up. So cant provide a comparative review.. Bt yes.. I loved it! After entering into the place we found there were hardly any place to sit.. Yes its a very small joint..But dont judge by that.. They will serve excellnt food!That too with a smile always.. We ordered Shwarma salad,Chicken Lebanese tawook and Lebanese fried chicken. Chicken Shwarma salad was something which I loved absolutely, Lebanese chickn ws aromatic , crisp and perfectly done, Chicken Lebanese  Tawook was average.. May b I am too used to taste of Kebabs in Moghlai joints and compared to that. The food was light on stomach and suitable especially in this hot weather.. For all ppl undergoin a diet and cravin to have some good food, there s good news, they claim that their food is 96% fat free! Another thing I would like to mention is though  being a small joint, they have kept hygiene a priorty.. I loved the concept of keeping small containers of hand sanitizers on table.Also like their food, the bill was not heavy atall! Definitely would visit again and try rice items.

Was there yesterday afternoon. 
Location : right beside the Lords crossing, easy to find. Dining area little small but clean. 
Ideal for to go (take away) or quick bites. We took the second option.
Ordered Chkn Shwarma Wrap (my default in any Mediterranean resto ), and Chkn Lebanese Tawook (as suggested by the waiter, opposing my original order of Shish Tawook).
Order was taken and delivered quickly. Very prompt service.
Chkn shwarma was good, but I had better here in Kolkata only. Not sure if the 'fat free' hummus was the culprit!
However the Lebanese Tawook wasn't upto the mark. It was kind of too dry. I have seen many praises for this dish in Zomato, so not sure whether I was unfortunate to receive a bad preparation, or thats the standard.
Might give it another try with other items if I go to that locality in future. But for now, Go Lebanese outlets seemed to be a bit better option to me.

This little cozy place round the corner at lords crossing produces one of the tastiest lebanese dishes I had had so far. The shawarma salad and the roll is outstanding here. I had also ordered the lebanese tawook which turned out to be equally awesome. And what's even better? They claim that their food is 96% fat free :-)

Located at a cosy corner of Lord's crossing, this place gives the option of healthy and tasty food. The menu has some great options in both veg and non veg. Its a great place to hang out with friends and have a gala chat over amazing food and drinks on a saturday evening. The decor is minimal and the service is prompt, which adds to the great experience.

Looking forward to come here a few more times in the future. Cheers!!

Such a competitive Lebanese joint that a nearby eatery serving similar Lebanese items got shut down before i could even review that. Coming to this nice shawarma outlet located in lords crossing & meant for the health freaks(96% fat free),you'll get a quick service and you can always wait at their tiny dine in area even for a take away.
Ambience 8/10
A very small yet neat and well maintained dine -in section with small tables and sofa. Absence of a wash basin is well compensated by the hand sanitizers.
Food Presentation 7/10
For dine in,you'll be served in plates and in a similar manner as other Lebanese places. For take away,you'll be charged for containers.
Food Quality 9/10
The shawarma wrap tasted a bit different from the ones i taste in the other outlets but it is good,and considering it's a low calorie one,it's excellent! The oriental salad has a creamy yellow mayo with chicken chunks and lots of salad veggies,which was good though i expected more chicken. The mussakkan is a new dish which is a must try for everyone.
Food Quantity 8/10
The oriental salad was slightly less in amount than the amount of salad served at other places. The wraps are of adequate size.
Cost Effectiveness 8/10
This outlet provides you with health food at comparable rates to other Lebanese joints,so that way it is reasonably priced.
Overall 40/50

Ambiance - Small indoor area. Cramped seating but outside its very nice.
Food - Portions are very good. The chicken shawarma was very filling, fresh and garlicy ! Price is very reasonable at Rs80.00. Its oil free and loaded with fresh flavour. I ordered the Fattoosh salad (Veg) which was rather disappointing as it did not have any salad leaves like lettuce as it should. Instead it was like a home made salad topped off which pieces of bread. Spicy Chicken Fried - Two drumsticks is really value for money at 150.00. Served hot, it was good. No carbonated drinks served. Better try and Ice Tea or Laban.  I do recommend this place for the Shawarma and Falafal packets (Veg).

SECRET BEHIND SO MANY REVIEWS!!
There is a matter like if you give your review on Zomato then after 15mins they will give you a free cold lemon tea(when you are present there).. LOL.. Even i also tried it.. Now coming to the food I would like to say that we ordered chicken nuggets & chicken shwarma.. Nuggets were awful.. That sour flavour of nuggets was the worst part.. I don't know if it was the part of the recipe or day-old food may be.. But the shwarma was really tasty.. Garnishing was okay.. The place is small but clean.. I liked their idea about the hand sanitizer on every table..

Okay, I had reviewed this place earlier and had rated it quite low as I was not impresed by the quality as well as service. But I decided to revisit the place yesterday and was surprised!! Not only have the service improved (the boys were very sweet and answered my queries with a pleasant smile, loved that!!) the spread has been extended and quality was loads better!! N Im not sure but they might have slashed the prices too. I loved the Shawarma Wrap, generous and garlicky. The chicken lebanese twook was very well flavoured and the portion was very good. The Lebneh Chicken burger was juicy and big!! Overall, I'm really glad I went back coz clearly my first imppression stands corrected!!



----- 16 Dec, 2013 -----

The place popped up at Lord's Crossing and drew me in coz of their funky pop of green. The place is clean and quirky. The menu is interesting going more middle eastern that just lebaneese. My reaction to the staff is mixed. Although they were nuce and accomodating, the girl at the till could do with a smile. It looked like she is chained to the counter against her will and we are torturing her with our demands!!!
The food is okay. Not good. The portions are small. The shawarma had moderate amount of chicken. The tahini sauce is way too thin and does not have much flavour. The chicken nuggets were minimal. And they do not serve any dipping sauce with them. The shish tawook was a bit burnt so I did not enjoy it. And they do not serve hummus with the kebabs which is a miss in my books. The shawarma salad athough was of good portion, the dressing was too runny.
This place is a miss in my book.

Shawarma nation located in Lord's Mor is a brilliant place to hang out with your friends, The staff are extremely helpful and are ready to give suggestions. The food is brilliant  and is a must visit.The location of Shawarma Nation is very convenient. However it is very small, it would be advisable to add a few more covers as it tends to get very crowded. Certainly a must go for people who love Lebanese food . 
Must try:
Shawarma- The best in Kolkata
Shish Taouk
Falafal

Even their Humus is better than the average Hummus available in Kolkata

"You should go and try shawarma"..That was what my friend had told.....I finally decided to go and give it a try with my fellow college mates and that too at SHAWARMA NATION.

Firstly, when i entered ,the thing that hooked me was the ambiance, soft music playing in the background, never did i feel such cozy at any eating outlet....i again say...NEVER!!!.......We sat there and were shouting as if it was our own classroom......and yes we did finish their hand hand sanitizer....hehe!!!

Secondly, the hospitality they showed us,the demeanor they possessed, i could only envision if all the all our restaurants were like SHAWARMA NATION, everybody would have skipped their dinner at home to just be there to enjoy.

Thirdly, we ordered CHICKEN SHAWARMA SALAD....the food was just awesome (to the power infinity). My taste buds were struck by an unknown powerful flavour and i could not resist myself and went on  eating and eating, i tried many times to take from my friends' plates but they did not let me as they were too busy with their own shawarma. The bread was soft and I ate so much. Seriouly, it has been listed in my FAVOURITE FOOD list.

And Lastly, the best thing, we were served refreshing drinks, that too FREE, which shows the generosity of SHAWARMA NATION that no other can ever match.MR. SHAWARMA NATION (sorry i did not get your name) drew us into some interesting talks with ended with laughters.

To Sum It up........SHAWARMA NATION has defined the words Customer Interaction,Hospitality,Lebanese cuisine.All I can say is that you should probably just go once and i know for sure you will be hooked to it. I will be going there again and again to try all the food they have. Even If i do not have cash to buy one SHAWARMA i will probably go and with a smile just to say "HELLO" .

Legend has it that egg rolls were invented in this city as a "Go-as-you-eat" food. Lebanon, a distant middle-east country can easily relate to the streets of Kolkata through it's Shawarma Wraps in that category.

I have been wishing to eat this particular Lebanese delicacy for a long time now and finally my wish was fulfilled. And this little joint just beside the South City Towers did not fail to amaze me.

The first thing you notice as you walk in this joint is it's small. But unlike any other small roadside eateries, it's well neat and clean and cozy. The ambiance sets your mood perfectly for the chat you want to have with your companion/s.

The Chicken Shawarma Wrap we were served was great, to say the least. And it's decent quantity made our journey to this place worthwhile.

The crust that wrapped the whole thing was fluffy and evenly cooked. No portion of it was over- or under-cooked. Inside was a mixture of chicken pieces and other vegetables and spices- all covered nicely with a great deal of mayonnaise.

What made the dish so awesome were those perfect little chicken pieces- they were juicy,tender and nicely cooked. They were absolutely delicious.

Even better, the whole dish was neither oily, nor heavy on the spices at all.

The waiters were friendly and so was the bill to the pocket. All of it for such low price was simply unbelievable.

Had so much fun eating out and trying a new dish after a long time. THUMBS UP.

I just had the shawarma pocket and the Lebaneh Chicken Burger.
The burger was the best!
The chicken tasted amazing, the bread was light, the burger mayo and hummus and veggies are great for such less price. Would definitely suggest it.
The pocket is also very good and there is good quantity, too.
Value for money.

I can't honestly say I am a great lover of Lebanese Cuisine but I love my Shawarma's ... I was quite happy when Shawarma Nation opened up so close to my parents house and I decided to try the Shawarma .... pretty decent in terms of flavor and quantity but I would still rate a couple of other establishments higher in terms of the taste. Pricing is decent enough and service is polite. A small no frills place and in terms of variety a good addition to all the eateries around Lords Bakery Crossing.

This is a small place at Lords crossing, now with indoor seating and a good home delivery service as well as take away. They have a short menu but serve starters, snacks and main courses.
I quite like their shawarmas which are just the right size for a snack. The Lebaneh fried chicken is my favourite, chicken legs with a crispy crust, served with a spicy dip, I would rather have this than the KFC fried chicken. I have also tried the Falafel dumplings which very quite crisp and very delectable. The hummus is also nice. Among the main course options I have tried their Arabic biriyani, which is quite good but not really satisfying if you are looking for a biriyani. The chello kebab and Ablama curries were also nice, although the curries tasted almost the same. All the food tastes excellent and you can make out that they use good fresh ingredients and good quality cooking oil (extra virgin olive oil as they claim). 
Sitting and eating at the restaurant can be a bit difficult as the sitting area is quite cramped with infernal bollywood and tollywood songs blasting on a radio. Better to sit outside on the road and enjoy your shawarma. The prices are also very reasonable. Dinner for two people with starters and main course will cost around Rs 500. The portions might be a bit small if you are a big eater.

Let me assure you it was worth paying a visit here...its damn cheap n really lip smacking food ...so I got a good destination where I can hang out :)

We ordered for Arabic Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Shish Tawook and Falafel (veg) with Tahini Dip served with Arabic Bread (as mentioned in the Menu). Commenting strictly on the quality, quantity and the taste of food, I will rate it Very Good. However, the person in the counter lacks training and does not believe in communicating with the customer. 
Here is why:-  He failed to take the complete order and got confused with the quantity we asked for. While serving the Falafel (Veg) they served with Garlic Dip instead of Tahini Dip and WITHOUT the Arabic Bread. On our enquiry we were told that they have discontinued serving Tahini and Arabic Bread. After a bit of argument they served the Arabic bread but could not serve the Tahini Dip.  We were told that the menu is getting revamped and hence the miscommunication. I found this to be extremely unprofessional and uncourteous as they should have clearly struck out portions and modify before handing over the menu rather than leaving it to our discovery. The way of dealing with a customer left a very bad taste.  I guess this is a small-eatery-syndrome.

Two months back I'd visited this place; one of the many newly opened Lebanese food stops in town. This one is quite easy to spot, being located at one corner of the Lords crossing and the colourful interiors with the prominent nameplate make it hard to miss.
It's a small eatery with the capacity to seat around 10 people and there is an active takeaway section next to it. The first thing which caught our eyes once we were inside, were the bottles of hand sanitizer kept on the yellow square tables (hope they can continue this practice!) and the bright wall paint on one side.
Even though we were in the Nation of Shawarmas, we refrained from ordering them and decided to go for the Chicken Shish Tawook and an Arabic Chicken Biryani instead. Their service was pretty decent and the quantity of food quite good. Coming to the taste, the biryani was definitely different from what I've had in other Lebanese restaurants. It had a well balanced spice quotient with small pieces of chicken in it and accompanied with the tastiest yogurt dip I've ever had. The shish tawook had nicely marinated, tender cubes of chicken. I loved the juiciness of the chicken which was accentuated by the subtle spicy flavour and some minty yogurt dip.

Overall, this place is nice for a quick bite at reasonable prices. I'd like to try out their shawarma wrap sometime soon.

This is a small eatery near Lord's Crossing. Just a few minutes walk from South city. We decided to check it out seeing the good ratings on Zomato. We ordered Tuna fish Shawarma. But since it was not available, we had to do with Chicken Shawarma Pockets. Chicken bits were definitely less but taste was awesome given the affordable price tag of just 50 bucks (no VAT). I would like to point out they tasted better without the coriander cum chilly sauce they served with. Delivery was really fast. Definitely a place to check out.

------- 22 march 2014--------

This is my second review for this awesome little eatery. Since we had a 20% discount coupon we got from a previous take away order, we ordered a lot of stuff this time- A chicken shawarma salad to start with, then chicken doner kabab,  chicken submarine, lebanese fried chicken and finally chicken mussakkan. Each and every item was delicious except the Chicken Mussakkan, which they took a long time to prepare. The mayonnaise was mixed with some sweet syrup in Chicken Mussakkan, which sort of bombed the whole preparation. Though chicken bits were generous and delicious, the sweet  cough syrup like taste ruined it. Also, the lettuce they used did not appear fresh to me.

Today evening while getting back home from work, I decided to stop by this place given the extremely good reviews all over zomato. The first thing that one cannot miss is the quirky get up of Shawarma Nation, very unlike most takeaway joints of Lebanese food that have sprung around the city. It has a decent seating area which makes it all the more pleasant and a relief for its busy location. Secondly, it is clean, visibly clean and thus won my heart even before I brushed through the menu. The menu catering to the usual shawarmas and falafel, I asked the staff to suggest me something different. Their instant reply was Arabic chicken biryani, lebaneh fried chicken and tawook. I strictly stuck to their suggestions and packed full portions of all the three. While they were making the tawook, I simply stood there getting intoxicated by the smell every second. Getting my packet ready for takeaway, I wanted to race  against time to reach home and unpack the delectables.
 
When I finally did get down to eat, the smell got even more appetising - so fresh, so spicy, so Lebanese. The fried chicken (a full portion comprises two pieces) is simple but the marination used is extremely tasty. A concoction of spices made the chicken indulgent, all the more with the green and red chutney by the side. The tawook is accompanied by pita bread. The pita was okay, not super soft but decent. It could have been better but the tawook is wow. Gorging on it was unstoppable  until I realised I got to leave some for others. :P Probably the most special takeaway from Shawarma Nation has been the Arabic biryani. After having the same in Hyderabad and falling for it left, right and centre, I got super excited when the staff suggested this and looked forward to tasting it eagerly. The biryani is almost as good as the ones I had in Hyderabad. A little heavy on spices and curry but light on oil, I have really taken to Arabic biryani unlike what I expected. The boneless pieces of chicken given here make it easier to have it too with the raita. Yet given the prices quoted, I expected a few more pieces of chicken may be. Otherwise, the taste and quality of products available are absolutely top notch and healthy. I can safely state without any doubt that I like this Lebanese joint over others for the variety on the menu.

Small eatery which is very popular and makes delicious shawarma wraps.
This is bear the Lords Crossing and will definitely catch your eye if you know the name right ;)

Cramped seating and small place with barely two proper tables.
Staff is very amiable and greets you well. Menu is limited but yes the food is tasty.
We were four people and had ordered four shawarma wraps.
The quantity is less :(
It kept me craving for more.

The wraps are really good with proper stuffing. Unlike other outlets. 
Coming back for more of varieties. Had limited time so could not try many things but yes the shawarma here is definitely worth. Give it a try.
And prices are really affordable :)

Cheers!

Well, lebanese cuisine has suddenly become a hot favourite in Calcutta. And among a handful of good lebanese food joint, one is this place.. Well what I liked are,
1> Food is really good. Shawarma, musakkan, Salad, Biryani, Nuggets.. All are good in their part. Real lebanese taste. The dips are awesome. I have tried all of them, and they taste brilliant.
2> Price is quite reasonable, provided the quality and ambience they are providing.
3> I love the whole deco and the idea of keeping it simple. Hand sanitizers instead of wash basin, small disposable water bottles, plates and evrythng..
I can't really think of anything that i did'nt like...
Keep up with this... :)
My perk: Its only 5minutes by auto from my home....!!!!

I have been to this place two times. And both time they have disappointed me in certain aspects and impressed me in certain aspects.

Disappointments:
Food quantity was less.
The Shawarma had a distinct taste of a white sauce (not mayonnaise) which suppressed the other flavors. 
Falafal had the same problem.

Impressed by:
Service is very prompt and friendly
Though sitting space is not big, it is comfortable and the background music kind of adds to the mood.

Apart from the sauce disaster food here is good and very much edible.

It's a small food joint located just at the Lord's More crossing. We ordered for an home delivery from there. Though the food was great the home delivery service was pathetic. I had to wait for around an hour for the food to get delivered right across the street, as my place is one of the landmarks of this area and literally two minutes away from the restaurant. I had to call and explain the location nearly 10-15 times, yet the delivery boy couldn't understand. That said, the food nearly made up for it. The biriyani was great and their shawarmas are good too. I hope they take  this as a suggestion and improve on their service.

SHAWARMA NATION !!! 

Been here on two food visits:
1. Falafel
2. Shawarma
...................................
SERVICE :  Prompt and Polite
FOOD : Now here is the question regarding the actual Lebanese cuisine when it comes to tingling the tongue. 
a) falafel : one dominant taste of coriander seeds. 
b) one dominant taste of the white sauce which many people take it as mayonnaise which isn't mayonnaise.
..................................
EXPERIENCE : a 3.0 says it all.
PERSONAL SIGHT : I would want the taste to be enhanced instead of dominating the whole dish by just one spice or spread.

Having read a lot of "Good" Reviews about this joint, we finally decided to try it out a couple of days back. The result was disastrous and the reliance on User Reviews on Zomato shaken for the first time since Zomato became a household name for restaurant reviews. We visited with a lot of expectation and returned almost wishing we had not been there. We had asked for Baba Ghannouj and were informed it was not available. I asked for a bottle of water and was informed they don't have Paneer (may be the lady mistook Paani for Paneer). And the list of unavailability goes on. Finally, just because it doesn't look good leaving the restaurant without having something there once seated, we ordered for a plate of Chicken Nuggets and a Shish Tawook and I'm sorry to say that neither of them was worth any mentioning. Finally, having paid the bill and coming out of the glass door, we could heave a sigh of relief. 

Personal Recommendation - Please visit this joint only if there's no other option.If you want to try authentic Lebanese cuisine, then this is definitely NOT the right place.

It was a great luncheon with my friend.From the time we stepped foot inside, we were made comfortable.The ambiance was perky and genuinely helpful. The music was soothing.The quality of food was very good,specially the chicken "whose name I cannot pronounce." What really made me write this review was the behaviour of the staff.They were very welcoming and made us feel very comfortable.The biriyani was a bit flat on the palette ,but I can overlook that as the as the worthy opponent ,the salad, just took my breath away.
Kudos, keep up the good work. You've got yourself a regular now.

Shawarma Nation - "A place having blend of lebanese food and indian spices"

Located near the lords restaurant which comes in the main crossing when you head from Tollygunge/New Alipore towards south city. It is a small place occupied with a LARGE number of staffs. As i was passing by for a short drive, i discovered this place. However, as i had my car there wasn't as such any parking place. But, somehow i was successful in parking in the nearby small lane. 

This place is a little on the cramped side and seats aren't much comfortable. As soon as i entered this place, i was welcomed by their staff. As we wanted to try the authentic arabic biriyani, it was very kind of their staffs to provide us with a little sample to get on the order. 

Food: 

I had ordered:- 

1) Shawarma - it was different and turned out to be good but quantity was less. 
2) Musakkan - It was better than Shawarma. 
3) Chicken biriyani - It had boneless pieces of chicken. It was a blend of indian and lebanese cuisine, spices were mixed in such a way in order to get our tastebuds in the mood. 
4) Shish Tawook - It had a little pudina taste and was not at all in comparison to the actual lebanese food. Even the quantity was too low in respect of prices charged. 

Service: 

1) Service was prompt.
2) Staffs were polite. However, few staffs did not wear their uniform and it was really grateful of the management or the person in charge to strictly order them to wear their uniform immediately. 
3) I had even ordered for smoothies but it was unavailable. 

Overall, NOT A GREAT EXPERIENCE but SATISFACTORY. :)

When I had passed this place a few days back I was very tempted to see what the fare was like. The place is very easy to spot. If you are driving down prince anwar shah road, its right next to the popular lords restaurant . 

The quirky sign board and the open and neat and clean kitchen visible from the road is a big plus for this outlet and the yellow and green interiors are very inviting . Although the place is small i found it very sweet. They use disposables for the service and I have no qualms about it. 

I tried calling them but they said that i should come down and place the order and that it will take only 10 mins> on coming I met the person who took my order, Abhijeet. He as very prompt as I had told him  that I was in a  hurry and in 10 mins my order was ready as promised  and he was very warm and welcoming . 

My Order : 

Chicken Shawarma : I have always been a shawarma fan and this one had nice chunky capsicum and tomato which was adding a burst of freshness to the whole thing and it was not loaded with oodles of mayonnaise which is a big plus . although i feel it could have a little more filling. 

Falafel Wrap : falafels usually, the ones i have eaten around the city, have one common problem, that they are very dry but ones i had here were soft and moist . Simply loved it . The generous onions and tangy dressing were complimenting it really well . 

Oriental chicken Salad : Lots of veggies generous dressing and perfectly grilled chicken liked it a lot . I liked the fact that the veggies were really crunchy even 90 mins post packing . The pieces of chicken were juicy and delicious . 

Over all, I loved the place. I am glad kolkata is now home to many such small little eateries mushrooming and adding a freshness to the food scene . KUDOS !

nice ambiance to have a wonderful time to spend with your special one, the concept is really different which we can relate to Lebanese. Prices are reasonable with no extra TAX which is appreciable. The service is very friendly however the complain is they really serve bit late. Overall it was a new experience after the regular Chinese and the other regular flavors. I am planning for a next visit very soon and this time i m gonna try the BIRIYANI with the pinch of Arabic twist.

Have had more of their menu over the past month - here are some of the other dishes that i rate highly:

Chicken Nuggets - very different from any nuggets you'll find elsewhere in the city. Possibly the healthiest ones too. Less fat and grease and no batter. 

Lebanese Tawook - I confused this with the Shish Tawook a couple of times..the Lebanese Tawook is some seriously succulent  grilled chicken. Go for the full plate!

Their biryani has an interesting twist. Don't expect lucknow style biryani..this is a whole different take. Not bad either. 

In order to make th food slightly less healthy and tastier - go for extra portions of their garlic sauce! 

Keep up the good work!



----- 03 Sep, 2013 -----

I've never been to Lebanon so i don't know what authentic lebanese tastes like but i've had the cuisine in 5, maybe 6 other countries. The Shwama Nation shwarma rolls are tasty as is their hummus but of the 4 things i've tried so far (musaakan, hummus, shwarma and babaganoush) the babaganoush is definitely one of the best in the city! Will try some of the other menu options and post again. An extra plus point is that they are usually open a little later than most places.

FOOD=4.0. It is a relative ranking when you compare it with the other labenese joints... The oily food (falafel wrap/shawarma roll) ,unlike the labenese joints, made me unhappy. However, their Arabic Biryani turned out to be supa good..

Though I have perceived this place to be a quick service outlet at a first glance, but surprisingly they have small sitting space that can accommodate 8-10 ppl.  The inside space & walls are decorated with soothing green shade. The sitting area is clean and loaded with A/C. The surprise element is the small sanitizer bottle that you find on your table :)); which i think is an innovative way to avoid the basin @ small space and also provide an option to the customers to clean their hands....

The servers are polite & friendly; when I complained about the extra oil in the food they politely offered an exchange :). A 5.0 for their service. The prices are equivalent to the competitor next door and other famous lebanese outlets.

The sudden wave of lebanese food in kolkata over the last 2 years has taken fast food concept for us to a different dimension. Having said that i still remember my first shawarma some good 10 yrs back at arhan thai...nd nw it brings me to this place called SHAWARMA NATION.... 
It is and that i hope for it to always remain an authentic lebanese nd arabic food concept NATION in its own...the staff is humble nd place os cozy in a corner of a busy crossing...
To talk about the food..
its mouth watering....the good part of their menu is less number of items., which only help the cheff to focus on all the items with utmost delegence md passion...
u have to try their 
Biryani....yes absolutely delicious....best part no bones...nd /NO AALU...
tawook
their salad
veg falafal....blew my mind away...a must try....
nd the Shawarma ofcourse...

A piece of Arab and Lebanon in Kolkata. My mouth bud tasted few items on 14.10.2013. They have very small variety items unlike a regular restaurant. Perhaps that is the reason, they have concentrated to few dishes to make it remarkable. Only main course items being Chicken Biriyani in Arabic style where four pieces of Boneless Chicken served and that too of pretty large pieces. Not too spicy, they use few uncommon herbs in their kebabs and Biriyani. Accomplishment is not up to the mark like salads (too sour) and chutney/dip. But overall a good experience.

i ordered mussakkan wrap and lebanese tawoop for take away. i heated both in the oven after coming home and both still tasted awesome.
the mussakkan was so delicious i even licked the oil from my plate. and the tawoop has got some serious flavorsome spices in it, cause you can still feel a sensation in your tongue long after you have finished eating.
their smoked chicken are not red but a little darker compared to other Lebanese places probably because of the spices and it really does make a difference.

Oriental chicken salad, Shawarma and Mussakan are what we ordered one evening after waiting 20 minutes on the pavement for a table at this tiny joint. Laban we ordered as a drink, which the staff said was not available and the next thing you see it being served on the table beside you. Well........
Food was good, service was decently fast and it was pocket friendly. Biryani also was not available at 7 in the evening.

They say they import their spices from middle east to bring about the authenticity of Shawarma. Read many reviews of Shawarma Nation. This Shawarma fever is catching up the whole city. And myself, like many others, am a big fan of it too.
Very recently did I start having them, and then I got hooked to them. The unique combination of the ingredients is fantastic. The ingredients are readily available in our market too, so you do not need to work very hard and gather fancy veggies to try and cook it up at home. Loved the Shawarmas here, and will visit again in the near future, after I complete visiting ALL the shawarma serving eateries in the city.

The quality is good, no doubt, but the quantity isn't enough (at least for a guy).... in the main course, they have Shish/Lebanese Tawook... the full plate would cost you 140/150 respectively...  but if you are a guy, and hungry, then this is certainly not enough. The biriyani deserves a try....

Well , i had been really eager to try out this joint. So when i finally had my order delivered a review seemed the next progressive stage.
First off, we ordered shawarma and chicken biriyani.
The order got delivered in about 40 minutes time which was exactly as the person on the phone had said, albeit i stay 100 meters away(thanks for the heads up though)

Shawarma: very average. Felt more like something from monginis or sugar and spice. Overpriced and Under-Flavored.

Biriyani; very good actually. Its like a hyderabadi biriyani, of which i am an avid fan. Full plate serves one. Don't be misguided by what some-other people might say( unless you have a measly appetite ). The chicken was plentiful, flavorful and boneless. So definitely try that , although for 150 rupees, its a tad overpriced.

I had been longing to try out some good food for a long time.. and was pretty happy with what shawarma nation had to offer. The falafel  is just amazing.. It contains everything in the right proportions to give it that gooeey wow feeling in your mouth.. which is contrary to some other newly opened lebanese joints in the city.. Adding to that, I had ordered a lemon and mint cooler, which was quite refreshing even without soda. The add on was it was delicious and healthy. The staff is extremely extremely cordial. I was surprised when I was offered a palate of humus for free. .I would probably give it an extra point for that.  The place though quite small is not stuffy, and is well air conditioned. However, it is best advised to not visit it at the peak hours. Hoping they will continue to maintain this standard,1 :)

Serves awesome biriyani, it's a huge hit. Top it off with the lemon mint cooler and you have a sumptuous meal at a throwaway price. I am packing up their biriyani almost everyday and I just can't get enough of them. Awesome!! P.S. it's really not a place for Lebanese cuisine connoisseur but if you're looking for a quick sumptuous meal for cheap, SN marks the spot!!

I went to this lebanese joint on a weekday at around 2130 hours.
The staff was extremely warm and courteous. 
Food i ordered ( vegetarian )

1. Hummus and Pita Bread
2. Falafel wraps - 
3. Extra bread
4. garlic dip
5 lemon and mint cooler

The hummus was fresh and had that perfect flavour you would want . It wasnt too oily and was perfectly thick.
Pita bread, though a bit thick, was served fresh unlike other lebanese joints.
I had requested that the falafel be served without any mayonaisse and that I wanted Hummus instead.
The falafel was yumm!!! So well prepared that I actually ended up eating another one . With Hummus , they also put a hint of mint mayo  ( though without my consent ), and that made the falafel taste like heaven. The preparation though a little unconventional was definitely very good. The portion size though wasnt as great as other lebanese joints.
The garlic dip was perfect , nothing to complain about.
The surpirse was the mint and lemon cooler- it was superb, very fresh, had crushed mint leaves and they added ice on request ( something I didnt expect from such a small outlet )

Though a little cramped up the place is aesthetically corrrect and much hygeinic than other such outlets.

Overall a good experience. Happy about the fact that they would deliver within 4kms radium on orders above Rs.400/-

It's a big turnoff when the pictures in the 'Photo' section of a listed restaurant doesn't even remotely match with the ones I'm served. Yeah I know it has to be all decked up when Zomato team is taking the pics, but keeping the presentation same will only increase your repeat customers, guys! I didn't at least expect the thermocol plates!

The location is fantastic. Lake Gardens crossing... 5-minute walk from South City mall... nothing could have been better! Being the first of its kind in my locality, I was super excited. I grew up in this place and I was aware that the area where the restaurant has been built is quite small. However, you can make good things out of small places; and Shawarma Nation did justice. Other customers might complain that it's all cramped up, but I'm immensely satisfied with what they were able to do with the seating arrangement. And kudos to whoever introduced the idea of the hand sanitizer. Now that's something bringing new to the table.

The food is tasty of course. Nothing stupendous when compared to the other Lebanese joints in the city, but yes, it tastes different (in a good way). Avoid the weekend peak hours if you want to enjoy the food quietly. And I must mention this, I've been to a lot of newly-opened restaurants but hardly seen the staff members so friendly AND attentive. A bit pricey... but it'll be all OK if the restaurant keeps on improving itself. All the best to Shawarma Nation... would love to rate it over 4 next time.

some days ago one of my friends told me you know " there is another lebanese restaurant in the city, near lords crossing , people go crazy about  this place, probably they finally found a proper place to eat lebanese food. " 

so after some days we went there. just a 5 mins walk from south city , it is a tiny food joint which provides both outdoor and fast eating place inside it. nothing much to talk about its decor as it is tiny but surely you can sit there with comfort.  waiters are friendly. 

Now comes the food. we ordered Sish tawook, chicken biriyani and Lebanese tawook and lemon and mint cooler. we ordered lemon and mint cooler coz we anticipated that they serve us Lebanese food  like Go Lebanese and Royal lebanese and we had a premonition that Lebanese food is very dry and contains no oil . But surprise :)   when food was served on the table it was yummy and contains exact proportion of oil, salt, spice. 

Biriyani was tasted ok and it was more like hydrabadi biriyani and quantity of half plate was more than sufficient. Sish tawook was fabulous and if i am not wrong they cooked it with butter and oil both. a smell of butter was there. It ws tender, juicy and spicy(not so much though ). Lebanese tawook was also fabulous. but the quantity  may upset you. only a grilled chicken fillet was there . served with salad dipped in vinigar.  Other people sitting besides us having falafal and mussakan. I asked them how they are and they told it is different and very good than any other lebanese food joint in kolkata. Lemon mint cooler was average .

I am yet to try the mussakan, falafal in this place. I will recommend other people to try  sish tawook  and lebanese tawook in this place.

Pocket pinch is Rs230-250 for two. so i must say that this is very pocket friendly fast eating place and it is really good. try it .
So overall i rate this place 4 out  5. and surely i will visit this place soon.

I do not personally approve of this place. There are many places who claim they serve 'authentic Lebanese food' and there are many who actually fall for it. Honestly, i don't think even people from Lebanon would recognize the Shawarma wrap. I did not like it. The pita bread was very ill made. It was thick and hence didn't appeal to the system. It wasn't as tasty as a Go Leb Shawarma wrap though this was costlier. I'd rather go to the other 'authentic Lebanese' counters for this. In this competition, i think they need to bring up the standards, not go by it or in this case, under.  I think this can be given a pass unless you succumb to peer pressure. 
Can be avoided.
Cheers!

Shawarma Nation is the newest kid on block, but o boy! hits a sixer each time with its yummy, yummier, yummiest dishes! It's a small cozy restaurant, more like an eatery, which can accommodate not more than 15 people at a time, but who cares! The food is really worth waiting for. I tried their Lebanese Tawook. It's a sort of chicken steak and comes with a green chutney and pickled salad. To tell the truth, I wasn't really impressed at the sight of it, but it tasted so nice. The chicken was so soft and tender, along with the chutney and, not to forget, the yum pickled salad. It's a MUST try item on the list.
Next item which I had ordered was the oriental Salad. It took nearly 30 mins to be made which made me quite irritated, but again, it looked so nice! and tasted ever better. All of 110 bucks, it had fresh lettuce, jalapenos and capsicum along with chicken  slices. For me, it's a must try. My sister, who HATES salads, vouched ordering it every time she visits this place! In short, it's a total winner! 
Their kiwi smoothie is commendable too. 
This place is so easy on the pocket, much because their prices are inclusive of all taxes. It's a place worth visiting again n again. I'm soon going to back for their shawarma wraps, falafel and baba ghanaoj (according to a friend of mine, that's the best thing SN serves)!

I tried the Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Shawarma. I found both the items to be relatively much better than whats currently available in Kolkata. The Chicken Shawarma is not loaded with "false" taratur sauce like other brands - what a relief. The sauce has been added to the Shawarma to complement its taste and not to give you a mouth full of confusion like other brands. The Chicken Shawarma has french fries - a common characteristic of Shawarmas available in rest of the world.  I loved the taste of the pita - unique!  

The Chicken Biriyani is a decent replica of what you get in the Gulf countries. Very spicy to cater to the Indian taste bud. The biriyani has a hint of Malayali Biriyani. For those of you who have not travelled to the Gulf countries, there are loads of Malayali (Kerala) cooks in those countries. So they have played a part in the evolution of food taste. 

Hygiene is good compared to other brands.

You guys have done a good job. And you have created a new benchmark for Lebanese outlets in Kolkata. Shawarma Nation is a must try.

It is hands down the best Lebanese joint in the city. It is not overly priced with amazing quality of the food you get. Lets put it this way, you'll be full but you'd feel guilty leaving a crumb on your plate. IT'S THAT GOOD!!

I have given them a rating of 5... cos i believe they truly deserve it and much much more. the food is simply amazing. not only does it appeal to your taste buds, it also takes care of your biological system as they provide quality food. cherry on top is the staff who have a pleasing personality and a broad welcoming smile. i have tried almost all the food that they offer and can't really pick up one particular dish as my favorite as all of them are unique and wonderful in their own special way. love the shish tawook, lebanese tawook, shawarma, musakkan,everything basically.

you guys simply rock... keep up the amazing work....

One must visit this place to taste authentic Lebanese/Mediterranean Cuisine,it sure is a Nation full of good and sumptuous Lebanese food for both veggies & non-veggies along with some great smoothies & Laban(Lebanese Drink).

With only a week of its opening it already has its patrons !! I'm a gr8 fan of Shawarma Nation !!! A sheer work of brilliance as far as the style,concept & interiors are concerned ! An air-conditioned & pleasant place to sit & njoy ur food with family,friends or even alone !

Food served by them is cooked with so much cleanliness & hygiene, its healthy- 96% fat free & cooked in Virgin Olive Oil only ! ( So very Appreciated ) Not many people must be aware but Lebanese Food is considered to be one of the Most Healthiest Food of the World . At Shawarma, the Shish Tawook is to die for, Mussakkan & Shawarma tastes brilliant ! Never had a better Falafel yet ! But yes u need to have tasted authentic Lebanese food to praise the authentic taste that Shawarma Nation has put into the food that they are serving & if u haven't had a taste of authentic lebanesee yet then go grab yourself a meal at their outlet ! Great Job done Chef !! 
 
 I am yet to try the Biryani,Hummus,Baba Ghannouj,Shish Paneer ,Nuggets etc etc hmmmmmmm sounds yummy itself ! The best part about this place is that u can sit & eat in the fresh & brightly done up place Or stand/sit out & eat while enjoying the true Kolkata Or take away your food Or ask for a doorstep delivery--tringgg tringgg  :) Man they have so much to Offer ;) they do it all with a smile !! Thank you Shawarma Nation guys for coming up in our city & serving us with so much love & passion ! Keep up the gr8 work & do come up with more & more outlets across the country !  And yea I must say this ,just loved the concept of providing hand sanitizers instead of just those dry tissues ! Appreciate it !

Shawarma Nation is the newest kid on the Lebanese food block. Located very strategically at the Lords crossing near the South City Mall, this place might attract a lot of people, especially on weekends.
I had been super psyched about the place ever since they put up their board. After checking their array on Zomato, a friend and I went ahead on 4th August (Sunday) to taste their Shawarma.
I comfortably entered and saw the owners greeting a Government official and they paid no attention to us whatsoever (though they eyed us). I assumed that the store had not yet opened so I came out and tried to place my order from their service window. I asked for 2 Shawarmas. To my shock, they DID NOT HAVE Shawarma!! On a Sunday!! On their opening weekend!! Now with a name like 'Shawarma Nation' you would expect the availability of the Shawarma atleast. Anyways, I tried the Mussakkan. It took a long time even though we were the only people who placed the order. While waiting I observed that only one worker was wearing a protective headgear in order to prevent hair falling into the food. Also, their workers seemed to be all doing 'something' without actually accomplishing anything.
The Mussakkan tasted fine. Nothing extraordinary. Nothing that we haven't tasted before.
We had to sit on the benches opposite the eatery and were victims of severe honking of the cars as the Lords crossing, being as busy as it is, has traffic issues, more so with the (illegally) parked SUV of the Government official seated inside.
All in all, my visits to this place will not be as frequent as I had hoped it would be.
But I still have to try their Shawarma...
Till then, my Mission shall remain Incomplete...
