The sandwiches were not available , hence opted for the chicken shawarma rolls. Fairly priced was filling and tasteful. Served with onions and a bit of hummus its a perfect on the go snack. Would like to taste the salad sometime.

Located right opposite the landmark DIAMOND PLAZA. Small quaint place with small sitting arrangement outside. Mostly serves as a take away counter. 
When we reached there, we already noticed some heated arguments and badmouthing between the management & one of the cooks. That visibly gave us some bad impression about this place. 

Not judging negatively, we moved ahead and ordered chicken shawarma with coke and fries. Chicken was in generous amount, but for some reason the wrap tasted way too bland and out of place. Still, the overall wrap was nice. Rest of the stuffs were okay too. 

Staff behavior was nice,as well.
Pocket friendly? Neh. Not really. They could work more on the quality and quantity of the shawarna wraps.

Located just opposite Diamond Plaza, this place serves the so called Shawarma which tastes nothing like one. There is not enough mayo/chicken in it.
Although it is made on order, it does nothing to save the bad taste.
And quite pricey too.

Rs. 100/- for a chicken shawarma.

I tried the basic Chicken Shwarma Wrap and being the only outlet in a wide locality, serving shwarmas, it is pretty good. The service was quick and the staff polite. It is a take out place so no seating arrangements. The roll was well stuffed and flavoursome served with mayonnaise and a green chutney. I would visit again.

Firstly, the authentic shawrma taste is missing. 
I ordered a combo, it was served in a really good boxing, as I said the taste is missing.
Secondly, they charged 18% GST, which a restaurant having AC can charge, restaurant without AC have to charge GST at 12%.

This is a small takeaway counter. I have been there quite a few times and the taste wise I would say they are not really very consistent. Sometimes its great but so far most times it has be kind of "so so". I prefer the simple chicken shwarma than the other options with cheese. This not some place I can strongly recommend but you can try if you just to pick up something on the go.

Ordered a cheesy chicken shawarma.

Shawarma's are supposed to have juicy and moist chicken this didn't have that. It was on the drier side. 
The cheese wasn't really there, would've loved a bit more of that since it is was a "Cheesy chicken shawarma" 

The food wasn't bad, it was good.
It just isn't shawarma.

Shawa Rama is a new inclusion around the Diamond plaza small area. Its Located right opposite of the mall. A small food joint surprisingly serving  quality Lebanese delicacies.  

Opted for their combo consisting of Chicken Shawarma, French Fried and a Can of soft drinks price at INR 140. 
The accompaniment of the hummas sauce impressed me at the first go itself which is not expected from small joints like this. The shawarma wrap was filled with juicy chicken filling and satisfied my hungry soul. Not the best one but a decent place to try Shawarma I would say.

Shawa rama is the only Lebanese food joint in this locality. Located just opposite diamond plaza, this is a small counter with just take-away option available. Average waiting time is 30-40mins. 
We ordered chicken shawarma combo which contains chicken shawarma wrap,  hummus,  French fries and 330ml of 7up/pepsi,  all of which costs 140bucks. The wrap tasted good with proper stuffing of chicken and fresh veggies,  however I have had better tasting shawarma wraps than this before. I guess it's the taste of white sauce that makes the difference. The French fries were extremely oily ,  and hummus could have been better. We also ordered Caesar salad with fried chicken. This one tasted really good, though I wonder why a strict Lebanese counter would sell Mexican food.  Food packaging is neat.  Overall I would say,  it's a good value for money.  Having opened just before the festive season, with the pocket pinch within budget, this food joint should be an instant hit if they maintain their current food standards.

First time trying Lebanese and that to here.
The location of the place is very easy to locate just opposite Diamond Plaza. It's a tiny joint which enables you to sit outside as they have arranged some chairs. The place looks nice.

Coming to the food we ordered Special Chicken Shawarama wrap, Chickern Shwarana Wrap and a coke. First of all there was no difference in taste between the two wraps. Both the wraps tasted the same. Actually we wanted to opt for the Shawarama Sandwich but we couldn't because it was over so the man behind the counter suggested us to try the Special Wrap and we did. The cost of the Special Wrap was slightly more than the normal one but as I said they taste exactly the same. But the good part is that both the wraps tasted good. It was stuffed with good amount of chicken in it and it was very much tummy filling. 

But I still feel that they should improve the quantity of the food.

Trying Lebanese for the first time. Ordered for a Mezze Platter and a Paneer Shawarma combo. The platter had Pita, Falafel, Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Labneh and Tabbouleh. The combo came with a Paneer Shawarma Wrap, Fries, Hummus and Pepsi. The platter came for 100 bucks while the combo pinched 120 rupees. The shawarma wrap was good, the fries were great. The pita bread was okayish, so was the labneh. The falafel was okayish too I would say. The Baba Ganoush and the tabbouleh was a disaster. I just hope they won't taste that bad in general. Really wouldn't recommend this one to anybody. I hope Lebanese food tastes better than what I experienced here. Hummus was missing from the order. Had to complain regarding that. Also they didn't have Pepsi and so they replaced it with Mountain Dew.

Shawa Rama being the latest Lebanese point opposite Diamond Plaza Mall is having its share of crowd these days but honestly it would be hard for them to keep it coming. I tasted their Chicken Shawarma Wrap Special priced at 150, tasted below ordinary, the chicken being tasteless and such less amount of hummus in it even after charging extra 50 which supposedly was for extra mayo. My sister had their Chicken Shawarma Seekh kebab and even that wasn't up to the mark having the same taste as the shredded chicken under the pita bread. The service was fast enough. But all in all Shawa Rama wasn't good enough that you would crave for a wrap next time you are passing by the place.

In Indian context, they prepared well but if you have been to outside India like in Europe , then not as great taste as outside. We tried chicken sandwich and lamb shawarma. The shop space is small and just 4 chairs kept in front of the shop. They prepared and served quickly with some little sauce.

My taste for lebanese food started of with shawarma nation is lords kolkata and now its seems to be mouthwatering here in Shawa Rama . A great place for awesome lebanese food .

My advice would be to try the  chicken shawarma wrap. the ingredients itself makes you move your tongue with an ecstatic feeling . The creamy garlic sauce ,spiced potato and lettuce ..ahh just too good.
Then ofcourse one should definitely put their bets own Hummus nashib with pita bread. The taste of mediterranean spices is an unique experience one should never miss .
So guys go out there and grab a piece of good lebanese food

This is the special chicken shawarma roll. I had this today. It was the worst shawarma i have ever had. I had many shawarma. It has a raw pita bread , chicken very little amount. The main thing about shawarma is its super tasty mayonnaise. It little amount of of mayo which had no taste. It had cheese slices in it which made it awfull. It had lots of Julian of cabbage. Most of the roll was filled with cabbage. I had the worst food. And the price of the rolls are more than a normal shawarma found in kolkata. I would recommend not to have shawarma from here if u truly love shawarma.

First visit to this place. Very easy to locate, just opposite of Diamond plaza. Its a very small joint, you need to sit outside, they just placed few chairs. However coming to food, we decided not to go with the conventional shawarma wraps. We ordered lebanesse kebabs and ceaser salad with fried chicken. Kebabs were served with vinegar dipped salad and a mayo dip. It was succulent very good blend of spices. The pieces were very small though not thick too. Talking about the fried chicken it tasted very nice and salad had good balance of mayonnaise and everything else. Yet again very small pieces. I would say food is very good but service is not up to the mark. And value for money is not good too. Small proportions are not Acceptable.

This newly opened Lebanese food joint is situated opposite Diamond Plaza Mall. In recent times many a restaurants and small food joint has opened in this area and this is the newest addition. Because of so much competition, all of these restaurants need to be at their A game if they are to survive. Shawa Rama has done just that.

It's not some lavish restaurant that will impress you with it's diversity in menu. It serves about 10-11 items but boy do they make them tasty. I've already visited this place a few times , and I keep coming back because of the taste of their food as well as the proportions. I loved their chicken shawarma wrap as well as lamb shawarma wraps. Their combos are also very pocket friendly and tasty. 

Although they don't have a proper seating area yet there are about six chairs that are placed in front of the store in case you want to have your food there. 

Service is very good. :)

The quality and quantity is sufficient for one. The pricing is also reasonable. I would really like to try the other dishes on the menu. A must try place for everyone.

I have tasted Lebanese food in a lot of joint's but this was a down. Ordered chicken shawarma wrap and and humuus nashib with pita bread. Shawarma wrap was of bald taste. It felt so dry. Overly stuffed with onion's. also the wrap was very thick. Comparatively, the humuus nashib was better. I would not give it a second try. The person who took the order was courteous though.

Easy to locate being situated opposite to diamond plaza beside wow momo. Went there to eat shwarama. Taste of food is not so good. I've eaten much better shwarama. Though prices are cheap. Serive is also pretty fast.

A new food stall opposite of diamond plaza mall and they serve Lebanese food. Tried their chicken shawa rama combo, it comes with a chicken wrap, french fries and coke. They provide yummy and fresh food.

tried the joint, after initial hesitation but it turned out exceptionally well. i ordered a chicken combo, the rate seems fine and the taste is quite good too. will recommend to others, hope they make the sitting arrangements a little better, and manage the orders a bit faster.
