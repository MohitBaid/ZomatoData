The was once a great place to visit , but over time the place has turned to ruins. The ambience is not at all pleasant, with torn carpets and overall an unappealing environment. The people are very nice though, they are friendly and helpful and competent in their work.
Coming to Food, it tastes quite good, everything is well cooked, in good quantity and quality. I've been visiting this place for years and taste is something I never had to complain about. Coming to pricing, it's not cheap, though it's not overly expensive either. Considering what you get, I'd say it's acceptable though the ambience might make you feel otherwise.
I won't go to categorizing the food , I've had both Indian and Chinese and they taste good. You should definitely try the Zero Oil Fish Tikka which tastes delicious.
Overall , there are many issues coming to look and feel but I've always found the main part i.e. the food, enjoyable.
Must tries - Zero Oil Fish Tikka, Chicken Malai Kabab, Hyderabadi Biryani, Tutti Frutti.

Food is horribleest! 
Mutton was like stone. Extra salt in every dish.
Jeera rice was pathetic.
They gave us rating cards at the end. Everyone agreed on negative.
Should shut down

Well, have been there at Ginger yesterday (on 2017 Choturthi). First impression is why the place is empty? Well... I am not 100% sure. The decor is nice, doesn't scream for attention. Decent you can say. Now about the food, its pretty average. The menu card contains Indian, Chinese and Continental cuisine. I've tried the continental so can't give any insight but havr tried Chinese and Indian. I would say the go for Indian cuisine its better in taste. Chinese dishes are little over seasoned and not to die for I must say. Alchohol is not cheap and they don't have all those mentioned in the Bar Menu. So when you order they do mention what they have so that you can order accordingly. I tried chicken and it was a abit tough(to be very honest), so they do use frozen stuff(but that's what most restaurants do here. So...).
Last but not the least the service. They do have a good service. The waiters are nice and responsive. It was overall a pretty average experience but can't really call it bad. The problems mentioned above are pretty common in most restaurants in Kolkata so if you wanna spend a nice peaceful time you can enjoy here without much disturbances caused by overpopulated places.

A pretty decent place with average food and service. It is too expensive when compared to what they offer. The food is unnecessarily over priced, the Chinese food is quite okay though.
The only plus is that they provide the facility of candle light dinners and when you have a Groupon, it will be somewhat of a satisfying experience.

It's a nice bar located just near the hazra more. This is a nice and very peaceful bar which doesn't hurt the pocket much. The ambience is very good specially after 6 p.m when they put on the candle light. The food quality is also good. Even the staffs are pretty helpful. The only drawback was, they didn't have enough drinking items available during the visit.

I was here with my family on some event. It was long ago and I remember having a Groupon deal. It was a fairly discounted deal and that's what led us to this place. I was not aware of the shadiness of the place until I first walked into the restaurant. The place was pin drop silent and had just a table filled. Rest were all vacant. We had a bad feeling about it but we could not do anything since we had already bought the deal. The service was not at all good. Food was the worst part. The waiters had literally no idea and always went and talked with the manager about little things we would ask for. The only thing that was upto the mark was the cocktail. The reason behind it mght be that they had nothing to do that would ruin the taste of it. They just served it right from the bottle. Overall had a bad experience and would never suggest anyone to visit this place.

Worst food I have ever had in my life. 10 years back when I first visited this place it was one of a kind Chinese restaurant which had everything going right for itself. On my second and hopefully last visit the difference was startling. Dal was days old stale, was obviously reheated and served. Paneer was stinking, fermented and I couldn't gulp one bite down my throat.
Never visiting again.

Nit at all recomended. the ambience ia okay types. horrible music. The most important thibg, they wont let you what you wanna have. I mean, an almost empty bar throughout, they don't have any of the low-mid range drinks what we asked for. Ladtly we had to settle down with pints of Hennikken beer. the only pro is tgat the space is big. Did not try any food as we went to drink primarily. Bottomline, way TOO OVERPRICED as per the service.

So finally i am reviewing about this place i visited 1 year ago. The restaurant is near hazra more precisely just a few steps from kalighat. It was a good looking restaurant with a very sophisticated ambience. With the sophistication the price of their food were sophisticated too! Very high price With less quantity food. Food quality and taste was good. But It will burn your pocket and won't satisfy your tummy too. I don't know much about it now.

Well I visited this place two years ago and here I am to write the review, cause I was too disgusted with the resturant. Well the food is too pricey in terms of the quality and the quantity of the food. Visited the 1st floor restaurant with a friend of mine and it was almost empty except for an older couple. We ordered Chinese and the quality of the food as well as the quantity was much to our dismay. The noodles were undercooked. The side dishes tasted bland.
However the restaurant is well kept otherwise but nothing extraordinary. The staff were in different and cold in their behaviour.
The overall idea of the restaurant is bad and extremely dissapointing. Not recommended.

If you are looking for a nice place to settle down with family and have a pleasant meal, be warned, this is definitely not the place for you. 

I had visited Ginger a long, long time ago, most precisely, in its initial Days. The food was good then. I really do not know, what went wrong. The food now, is no where as close to tasting decent as the prices on the menu would  promise. The quality of the food or the establishment does not meet the standards of what is expected. 

Really disappointed with the service as well. Though our waiter was courteous, he was hardly ever to be found when needed. To top it all, the other waiters behaved as if they could not see or hear us, even though we waved and called for a certain change and another addition to the order.

Very unpleasant experience, both with the food and the service. Never to return for sure.

Been to this place lately, just the moment i stepped in realised it was biggest mistake of my life. Only thing good was hookah. They made a drink and said they were serving cosmopolitan, it was some weird drink served in highball glass, the garnish ( piece of lime) was stale. The food we ordered dry chili chicken and schezwan chicken was equally bad with bitter and rotten onions. On a weekday evening it was totally empty. The staff were having their own gala time, watching tv! Pathetic experience.

Located bang opposite the jatin das metro station,  Ginger offers reasonable refreshment option. We thought of checking this place out the other day when a colleague of ours is decided to treat is it was few of the best options available in the vicinity.  We were a group of 4 people and it was a Thursday evening when we entered the restaurant.  It was partially occupied and the vibe was kinda good. They have an island bar located at the centre from where they dispense beverage orders.  Menu comprises of all popular indian amd Chinese delicacy.  
The ambience is minimalistic. And nothing worth noticing.  There were lots of scope for proper upkeep, cleanliness and overall look and feel of the place.
It wasn't a typical dinner time so we decided just to keep ordering starters and drinks. Prices were reasonable which was expected.  For drinks we ordered scotch, red bull and beers.  It was served within the time and repeats were asked promptly.  
For starters our pick was chilli fish, drums of heaven and chilli chicken.  Food wasn't that great and tased average.
They also have a Dj which they said wasn't available that day. 
A average restaurant with just the average food and drinks.  Dont go with lots of expectations.

Overtly priced, may be due to the location, but when compared to the quality served, you'll feel disappointed. There are far better restaurants which have come up in the same or lower price range in the city. I have tried the Murgh Biryani here, such a waste of time and money.

I can't understand why people give so many negative reviews about this place - yes I condemn their attitude to a rape victim, they did not allow her to enter - barring that specific historic incident - this is a beautiful place as far as the quality of food, range of drinks, ambience etc are concerned.

Incredible to begin with, the restaurant should be an easy go-to restaurant for lovers in the first place. The ambience is so comfy. The people host the dinners so well. It promises a good candle-light dinner experience. The food beginning with the starters are very well-prepared
If you are willing, you may try the Virgin Mary and fish laiden starters. The chicken items were also really nicely made. Most of all that won our regards was their service. They were very amicable and assisting, adding to the pleasurable experience that my family and relations gathered from them. That was the best take away.

They are the worst! Simply! They simply serve you rotten food and try to convince you that it isn't. I had my own experience when I ordered a dish called something like spicy honey fish, which was rotten and tasted like hell and when I asked the waiter to taste it himself ,which he did and shamefully tried to convince me that it was not at all rotten and cut to scene two he was spitting it out in the dust bin near to the kitchen door, and their behavior was equally as bad too. They didn't even apologise for their mistake. They hardly seem to care about user reviews too. Zomato should provide a negative scale as well to rate these people because they surely don't deserve to get 1.

I wish there was minus rating to give....Located at the heart of Hazra crossing, location wise its fab....This place is shady and disgusting to say the least... CROWD is utter cheap and filthy to say the least.....Management and staff are horrible ,they will treat you like filth but the true fact is their property is totally sad. This is place has a real bad past, starting from a shootout that took place like 4-5 years back to Suzztte Jordan denied entry, you cannot expect any decent crowd to go in, let alone stay back.SIMPLY AVOID THIS PLACE,I MADE A BLUNDER OF GOING FOR 5 MIN AS MY FRIEND WHOSE A DJ  PROMISED THAT THE PLACE HAS CHANGED, BUT IT WAS A BLUNDER I MADE, KIND REQUEST TO ALL,JUST TO TOTALLY AVOID THIS PLACE.

Yesterday I have visited this Hotel. It is really pathetic. 
1. Food Quality was Awful. We ordered Crispy Chilli Baby-corn, it was hard like stone.
2. Rude Behaviour by the staffs.
3. No one served water.
4. Very Noisy Place.
IT IS REALLY A SHAME FOR TATA GROUP THAT BEING A PRESTIGIOUS BRAND THEY ARE NOT LOOKING AFTER THEIR PATHETIC OUTLETS. 
I WOULD REQUEST TO ALL OF YOU NOT TO VISIT. EVEN THE STREET FOOD QUALITY IS BETTER THAN THEM.

A very shady place that draws very cheap crowd. Had been with a friend who had promised me of a great party scene here and was amused to see him disappointed. The place used to run till early morning but not sure if it still remains open throughout the night. In any case, its better to sleep at home than wasting your night here.

I think it should be the most happening place in kolkata. They got a perfect ambience of a night club. From outside I didn't expect it could be like this.
Anyhow perfect bar lights, nice bartop with red light. I always prefer to seat at bar counter. Staff are friendly and courteous. 
I can compare this place with dubai night club. 
The best thing about this place is they allow smoking. So I was too delighted for it. 
House Dj was playing cool track though no body was on dance floor and lessor light was doing its mind blowing job to make me high.
This is the 1st time I drunk in a pub that much throughout India. 

I ordered a fungi risotto which was nice though was to dry and the rice didn't seem like risotto rice. Anyhow the taste was good, chef didn't shower it with loads of cream and cheese. 

To be honest with you guys, I really wanted to  drink till late night. I wasn't able to find anyplace at zomato. My friend told me try out this place. Worth of trying it. Though I got the number through zomato and ring them to know the timing ,was delighted with their answer till 12.30. Ultimately What ended up quite late.
You guys made my day.
Defo will be back with more people for your 999 promotion( unlimited drinks from 8 pm till 12am) and happy hour but one get one.

I really wish there was an option of rating a place ZERO, but unfortunately, Zomato.com prefers to be genial to even the most horrid places.

If you haven't read the other reviews, you'd be unaware of the fact that this sad excuse for a restaurant's manager denied the late Suzette Jordan entry simply because she was the victim of a rape.

I request all of you to please, oh please, never enter their premises because not only is their food horrible (this is an unbiased statement), but the manager has the audacity to discriminate against his customers.This place is a contributing factor to the oppression of women and victims of sexual violence in the city.No idea why they're still in business, but you as a consumer can help to change that by boycotting.

Day before yesterday I was going through hazra road and it was around 1pm. As it was the lunch time I was looking for a resturant. I found one named "Ginger". Restaurant was on the first floor. Ground floor they have a nightclub. The ambiance was not good. I found myself to be the only customer. Later on 2 people came to the resturant. 

The plates they gave had dust on it.. The place was smelling weird as they sprayed rose fragnance in the area. Its a bar cum resturant. The prices of the food items and the drinks were a bit more than reasinable and price of most of the food items were same or more than the price of those in park street resturants. 

I odered for a chicken cantonese noodles and a glass of fresh lime soda. 

The food came. The taste was ok. Nothig great. The staffs are not professional. I just finished a portion of the noodles and to my surprice I found a "COCKROACH" in the noodles. I called the guy. He wanted to give me a replacement as if it was just a piece of hair that was found in the food. I stood up and was going out and the guy was asking for the price of the soda which I didnot had. I didnot paid anything. They gave me a feedback sheet abd told to write against the head cook. I told him that I have nothing to do with your head cook. But I can imagine the condition of their kitchen from which the both the food and the fried/boiled cockroaches are coming. This is not expected. They are charging more than many good resturants. I WAS LUCKY TO FIND THE COCKROACH. Many might have had it thinking it to be some vegetable or mushroom.

No one called me from the resturant even to apologize for the incident. 

I was checking their review on Zomato and then I came to know that this resturant has already been famous(in negetive sense) for not allowing a park street rape victim to enter and have food in the resturant. It shows how cheap these people are. This resturant should be closed immediately. Please never try this resturant. Share this with everyone... Strict action should been taken against them....

When it comes to eating a full meal to satisfy the appetite, nothing but Ginger situated in SP mukherjee Road, Kalighat comes to my mind. The restaurant’s menu full with mouth watering delicacies is simply hard to resist. Just after little browsing through the menu, it was easy to order Jal Jeera to start with. The restaurant’s whopping list of kebabs was simply gorgeous. Though it takes little time to select, but I ordered Murgh Hariali kebab as it sounds great. And the taste of the dish is awesome as it is a perfect amalgamation of hang curd, cashew paste, cardamom, white pepper and other masalas going in marinated chicken pieces. Pulao aap ki pasand teaming up with tandoori whole bhetki and crab masala was something to drool over. As Bengalis can’t do without fish, I ordered ajwaini fish tikka, a lovely dish marinated in yogurt and spices, boiled in tandoor. Lastly for mu mitha I had hot gulab jamun and strawberry ice cream.

Now in the light of the fact that they refused entry to someone for being a rape survivor I believe we need to boycott this unsafe place with such rude & discriminating staff & management.

I've been to Ginger. It's nothing great. The service was only so so. Granted, it was a busy night. But if it's so busy, say you're full, don't act like you can deal with the crowd and then ignore your customers.
Then I read about Suzette Jordan's Ginger" experience.  - www(dot)mic.com/articles/98850/rape-victim-allegedly-denied-entrance-to-restaurant-for-being-rape-victim 

Denying someone entry to your club because they were at the receiving end of rape and violence? Are you serious? The ignorance, moral lowliness and disgusting behaviour on display here is incomprehensible. A lady, who has been violated in the worst possible way, is "paying" even more for something that she was not at fault for by being denied entry to places based on that?

Unfortunately, there isn't a jail for the type of scum that manages that restaurant and made that decision but in my own way, this is a shout out to people who want to know what type of place this is. Their music, food, location etc might work for you. But there are enough and more restaurants in a large city like Kolkata for people to go to, instead of hanging out at this one.

Sexist and despicable establishment. Rude waiters. This is a mediocre, needlessly expensive eatery that I nevertheless used to visit because it was close to my social circles during my college life.

In reference to refusal of service to Suzette Jordan, let me remind you that The Civil Rights Act of 1964 explicitly prohibits restaurants from refusing service to patrons on the basis of race, color, religion, or natural origin. In addition, most courts will not allow restaurants to refuse service to patrons based on extremely arbitrary conditions. I hope a lawyer would come forward pro bono and help Ms. Jordan sue the shit out of you.

A great example of sexism and discrimination hiding in plain sight. I demand that this restaurant and its manager issue an immediate and unconditional apology to Ms. Jordan, barring which there will be a boycott of this establishment.

I hope sincerely you close down in a month.

Where do I start ? Its notorious for being  seedy  and a place to avoid with family on the weekends or late in the evening. The food is ok at best and the service is horrendous. I remember having gone there for a working lunch with my office colleague and asking for rice noodle. The waiter promptly replied that rice and noodle were not mixed together and there is no such dish. exasperating. So if u cant go for the food and cant for the service and you are not sure if you will be turned out and abused for being brave and standing up for your self why go at all .

Candle light from 7PM there live music (violin and guitar) from Thomas Siromani was something which attracted me to this place. Food quality was another plus point.

I think this the best resturant cum bar at Hazra more...The location is great just beside Jatin das park metro station...Every wednesday a kind of musical night attracts many people here...Firstly I must say don't drink here much but eat...Fish ajawani tikka is a great dish followed by a mutton raan...Ambience is nice and waiters and staffs are good ar their job...Service is little bit slow but It's not a concern by me...Well enough to hang with friends but not a family place...Price is much high not a pocket friendly joint I must say...If you want to spend a quality evening visit specifically on Wednesdays because of the Rockomania Night shows...

Not worth spending the evening here. No proper dance floor, ambience is too dark and gloomy, and most of all, food quality not good enough. The space is too small to occupy heavy crowd. No value for money. They also have the facility of hookah, which indeed is not so special. There are lots of places around kalighat to cherish qualitative food than Ginger. But if you are lazy to travel long, then this is the right place because it is just near the metro station. And one more thimg, they only sell pint beer. No large bottles available. So next time you visit Ginger, carry your own pites if you are not high enough.;).

Dont expect too much from this place. The waiters only have an alibi for watever shortcomings this place have. They will always say sorry. The food was average, not so good, barring a fish starter. But the main disappointment is that I found a cockroach hovering near our table which was disgusting. Even after complaining they didnt acknowledge it unless when forced to do so.If the condition in the main area is this just think what will be the condition inside the kitchen !!!

it is situated near Jatin Das metro. Last year on Ashatami,Durga Puja we 11 friends had visited this restaurant. though it was crowded in other places at that time of night(10.00pm) but Ginger was surprisingly almost empty. the inner decor was cool and there was mild lights and soothing music but the waiters were not good at service,in fact they become rude after seeing our big group. Any ways I ordered , Murgh Hariyali kebab,Murgh Biriyani,Handi Ghost. The dishes were both  so-so and delicious but very much expensive compare to others restaurants.

This was my dad's discovery and what a discovery it was! We took our extended family for dinner when I had got admission to Jadavpur University and everyoen was satisfied. We had ordered Chinese food and what was most remarkable was that the fish was great. THe chicken was obviously awesome but this is one of the few places which sers good fish. The noodles were also very nice. 

Coming to ambience, it is dark, cool and comfortable. Good to take friends, colleagues or dates. Great Great discovery, father!

I have been to this place long back. The ambience was good, but I found the taste not so great while the price tag being on the higher side. The quantity was not that sufficient as well. This, I would not recommend to any one. However the area near Hazra more has very less options for sitting and dining. If you cannot find any other options and want to have food somewhere near Hazra more, then best of luck :)

The experience was as smooth as the melody of the Violin played in Ginger. We ( Me n my Better HAlf) went for a candle lit dinner on Wednesday eve, without any prior advance booking.... but the Ambience is Perfect for a Romantic Couple, n One will get lost into the Lip Smacking Food that was served with simplicity and the flavour and texture of the Mutton Biriyani, the Rahara Gosht. n the melt in the mouth Chicken Tilori Kabab.......... well It is just d ryt PLace to Go, If one is looking for Great Food at Affordable Prices, # Cosy # Romantic ambience ......... A must mention is the Service, which is quite poor in many Gala Restaurants....
though we didn't try the CHinese MEnu...
We started our course with some hard drinks.............which added to the atmosphere
I am looking forward to visit it once more....

#Just one suggestion on my behalf is that the number of Candles should be increased.... to large sized ones ..

Went yesterday evening with family to my favorite joint for dinner and found that Ginger today is no where it was once upon a time. The Food & Ambience has lost its touch and with cracked serving utensils and small cockroaches roaming freely ….. Ginger must seriously rethink its game plan… for now Hideous is the best word to describe and 2 is the score between a scale of 1 to 5 or even 10 !!! so sorry.

Today I went to Ginger Restaurant with my friend. The interiors are good and the ambiance is quite nice. We ordered ‘Chicken Tikka Kabab’ and ‘Jafrani Paneer Tikka’ as appetizers along with mocktail ‘Madam X’.  Then we ordered ‘Chicken Wonton Soup’ which was perfectly done with a deliciously sweet and spicy taste. For the main course, we went for the north Indian section and ordered ‘Plain Basmati Rice’, ‘Butter Nun’, ‘Ginger Special Dal Curry’, ‘Chicken Butter Masala’, ‘Mix Veg with baby corn’ and ‘Green Salad’. In the dessert we settle for Ice Cream. The ice cream taste very average. The place will give you an unnecessary pocket pinch and there is nothing special to attract my appetite.

Well, recently went to Ginger Restaurant with my partner. The first impressions were good. We were greeted properly, the staff was very polite. Infact they obliged to us everytime we asked them anything genourously.
Coming to the food, the starters were pretty good, Crispy Chilly BabyCorn and Pan Fried Chicken were really good, the mocktail they served was also good (sorry forgot the name).
As for the main course , the Indian dishes like Daal Tadka and butter naan were lip smacking, perfectly cooked, perfect mixture of spices too. The Chinese dishes were not as good but a bit above average only, although the Fried Rice was very average.
Ambience of the place was decent. Nothing to complain about.
One last thing, we went there after buying a coupon from groupon.com and the deal turned out to be AWESOME, because of which i'm not in the position to compare the prices.
What i liked the most was the hospitality of the waiters....
Keep up the work people...
(EDIT- We all know about the unfortunate incident that took place few days back. Others may make that incident as a base for giving the place ONE STAR but it doesnt change my opinion. A stupid act or cheap atitude of a particular manager shouldnt be the reason to insult the place or its food. If anyone deserves punishment it is the Manager and not the Restaurant as of course the manager is not the owner and is mere staff. If you disagree with my opinion good, no need to read it)

one of the worst places in kolkata. extremely expensive due god knows what reason. we went there with a groupon voucher. we were sitted at the lounge due to some renovations going on in the restaurant. a shabby place which instantly decreases ur appetite. coming to the food, although there was supposed to be a set menu, we were almost given no choice. the waiter served us a combination of chinese starters and indian main course and dessert. the crispy chilli baby corn was good. in the main course i liked the pulao. but i simply couldn't make out what the mixed veg consisted of. the gulab jamun was tasty. all in all, a very average affair. not recommended at all

I stumbled upon Ginger by accident and entered, impressed by the outer look of the vicinity. The interiors are good and the ambiance are best for a nice romantic evening or dinner actually : softly lit mildly rose hued corners and dimmed lights.The attendants were polite although limited in number considering the bigger seating capacity. The kitchen was a bit noisy in a funny way but i guess it was an off-hour for lunch with less people.

Ordered chicken wontons as appetizers which were perfectly done with a deliciously sweet and spicy sauce.The Handi Ghosht was yummy with a smoky, addictive caramelized onion favored gravy with perfectly cooked lamb. The Hari Mirch Chicken was juicy with equally tasty gravy which wasnt that greasy in reality. The pudina naan was perfectly done and went well with the meat based items. The rice was soft and hot, just how rice should be. 

Overall, it was a nice meal experience and the bill came to approximately about 1100 rupees (without alcohol) with good quantity of food - may seem overpriced to some but recommended nonetheless. I am not really sure why the ratings are so poor but i enjoyed the experience. I will recommend the restaurant, especially during non-peak hours for the Indian food at-least, particularly for couples.

Creepy- That's the first word that comes to my mind when Ginger is mentioned.  The place really creeps me out. The dim lighting and the family unfriendly ambiance are a put off as well. Add that to the overpriced yet extremely oily and medics food, Ginger is not worth a second visit.

this is an average restaurant located at hazra.ambience and service was ok,but their wasnot anything extraordinary in their menu.price are slightly on the higher side.they serve both chinese and indian and i tasted some of the items from both cuisines.
chicken sweet corn soup was ok,veg spring roll in starters was very oily,in the maincourse mixed haka  noodles,garlic chicken,butter naan and subz palak were all ok types.deserts included very average vanilla ice cream scoop and gulab jamun.the ice cream wasnot of good quality and  probably from a local cheap company.
unfortunately,i didnt find anything to draw me back there again.

I've been to this place thrice now. 
When I recently went there after years & because I didn't really have any other choice, I was pleasantly surprised. They renovated the restaurant and the food quality has gone up. 
Ordered tandoori aalu, Chinese salad for the starters which were really good. 

For the main course, we went for the North Indian section. 
I don't remember the dishes we ordered, but yeah, there was a baby corn sabzi we had ordered & the baby corn was absolutely undercooked. 
We complained about it when the manager asked how the food was, and he was ready to replace it ( I honestly didn't expect this from them given my previous impression). 

The most special thing about this restaurant (specially for the couples) is that there's a small section which you can pre book for anniversaries or birthdays .. they decorate beautifully and then goes a romantic candle light dinner ( Picture added).

Well, to be honest I am a regular here and have switched down from the top restaurant to the lounge ground floor. The place is good to catch up with your friends or chill out the evening. The staff interaction is gradually increasing in a positive manner, may be because of the regular visits I have here.

I am not a foodie but most of my colleagues who have been here liked the chicken items. The sitting area is much comfortable and you can even request a song to be played if its rolling out fresh and high.

Special thanks to the oldest person working here - I call him "chacha" and he is a wonderful person to talk to. The restaurant is quite good but I love the lounge ground floor. You have to come here to check it for yourself. I am not overwhelmed by the service but being an old timer sure makes me like it more.

Ginger used to be a family favorite and I loved their Dahi Kebabs and Ajwaini Fish Tikka accompanied with Veg Biriyani and could go all the way to Kalighat to taste these delicacies during a day off or whatever. Sadly the quality of food as well as the service and ambiance has deteriorated drastically these days. Ginger is also attracting shady crowd nowadays so THINK TWICE before visiting especially with family and children. A rude shock awaited us on the Christmas eve as we were seated besides a couple who seemed oblivious to their surroundings and were engaged in a heavy duty make-out session. The servers are a bunch of confused lot over here and have no sense of courtesy or whatever. I swore not to go back there again after that particular episode.

This used to be my favorite place and I would visit it very often...  but not any more.

Over the last few months the place seems to be going down on a very fast pace. The food goes down a notch or two every time I visit it. The service is not warm and friendly any more. Most of the old staff have left and replaced by new boys who do not know even basics of service.

Would really think twice before I go back to Ginger.

The decor and ambience is very good,the service is slow.
The food quality (esp the appetizers viz. Lat Me Kai ) is good but not at par with the prices.
The place is striving to be something completely unsuitable to its location.
If it wishes to keep itself reputed and profitable in the long run,the administration should do a bit of market research and undergo a overhaul.

One of the worst restaurant have ever visited in kolkata. Customer Care service is chip. But they cost a lott for the foods.. At the same time please do not expect the same customer care from this place. "Customer is always right" .. They do not follor this rule.. rather the rule they follow is like " We are always right.. You need to obey that.. And we re not entitled to give you an explanation".. Have visited this place at least 25 times.. But I think there won't be a 26th time in this list...

Perhaps the days of good service at Ginger are over.  There is marked difference in the service provided by them....downward trend.  They rang up today on the birthday of one of my family member and told to collect the gift.  After the dinner, manager took about 45 minutes to come and pleaded ignorance about everything.  Great service indeed!

Ginger is perhaps providing the best service amongst the Kolkata restaurants.  Ambience and food is excellent. Their cutlery is also very good. A very pleasurable and value for money visit to Ginger.
