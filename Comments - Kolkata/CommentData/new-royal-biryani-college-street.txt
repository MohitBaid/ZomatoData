Tried the mutton biryani since they've mentioned it as their "speciality". The biryani was dry with one medium piece of mutton. 

Also trued their chicken chaap. Very spicy and oily. Not worth to try unless you really like spicy food!

Service is fast and there's lot of crowd. There's nothing to expect from the ambience.

Don't expect a decor or ambiance. Hoped for quality but then don't expect that too. Quantity you can expect. The taste was not that good since it lacked the smell of biryani. That's the very essence of Biryani and they don't pay attention to that. Weird!

Mixed experience. Recently.
Biriyani is really good to eat...They add the aroma of Ghee , and the sticky taste of Ghee remains faintly in your mouth for some time . Mutton biryani is specially good. Chicken biriyani is not that good. The 'alu' of biriyani is often not soft enough to be palatable.
Very inexpensive. Now you can sit in 1st floor to eat. But hygiene is probably questionable.
Staffs are quite good.
If you want biriyani at low cost, yes you can eat here... Mutton biryani tastes good. I won't really suggest to try other foods here. With

Tried chicken biriyani and mutton chaap here. We took a parcel of dinner. After opening the parcel we found the biriyani and chaap both were too oily and spicy. Chicken was still average but we had to fight with the mutton to tear  it. Complete waste of money.

New Royal Biryani is where people of College Street first started getting biriyani at a low price of Rs.70. This was the first of its kind Biryani seller in College Street. Their Biryani is average, much oily and with a hard piece of Chicken. Just due to unavailability of compition this place used to do a good business.
Now their Chicken Biryani cost Rs.80 and I think there are better options for Rs.70-80 then Royal.
Still this place was biriyani spot for months.

Once upon a time, I was regular visitor to this place and thus saw this outlet opening. While, it opened with loud hue and cry - the management, staff and the hygiene took a back seat. The food is seen to be prepared in unhygienic way possible and so is the little sitting area. On visiting this place, the hungry person will be reluctant to have anything (like, ME).
However, I had a heated debate on how even the aroma of a food can decide its taste and hence this debacle made us visit and try one plate of biryani. As expected, the food was not good and even my friend smiled and could not finish it.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Of course NOT.

Qs) Why have I rated them 1.5 stars?
Ans) 0.5 stars were added for the hospitality of the staff.

I have seen New Royal Biryani from the very first day when this shop opened up. They used to prepare really good biryani and the Chicken Biryani was priced at Rs.70 that time.
But slowly i have noticed the quality going down. And is now priced Rs.80. The Biryani is bit heavy and contains too much oil. This rice quality is fine although, but the Chicken pieces are hard.
Still this place produce one of the best biryani in this region. And is very popular among the students here.

The biriyani here is authentic bengali biriyani although keeping in mind that there quality has gone down. I have memories of durga puja when at night along with friends it used to be the adda location. Although the dine in is worst you can always take away and have at home, which is what i always did.

Located near Gunjan Chinese Restaurant. Not Hygienic at all . Only Takeaway no option of Dine-In . Food extremely oily . Ordered Chicken Biryani & Chicken Chap was okayish but had no taste Chicken piece was very hard to chew. Overall a very bad experience. Go for this place if you have no other option.

Undoubtedly one of the best biriyani that I have tasted. Not much oily n spicy with a quite good quantity of rice n a super chicken/mutton piece along with a piece of potato. Price is highly pocket friendly. One of the best to have food from.
