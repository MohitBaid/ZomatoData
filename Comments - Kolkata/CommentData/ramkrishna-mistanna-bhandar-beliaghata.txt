Well, with the likes of Surendranath, BMRM, Ghosh brothers, Nabin Chandra, Chittaranjan â€¦â€¦.. etc, we the Kolkatans often tend to ignore other sweet meat outlets â€“ who serve almost the same quality and taste at similar prices â€“ but do not enjoy similar rapport!

Yes, I am talking about the Ramkrishna Mishthanna bhandar, conveniently based nearby the Divine Nursing home at Beliaghata!

Every sweet meat you have ever heard of is available at this shop â€“ you name it, you get it! Their variety and availability is definitely better than the established big guns of Kolkata named above!

It will be pretty unfair to pin point a few of their long list of sweets meats as their best â€“ as all are better than one another! We definitely cannot under estimate the softness of their Sandesh, especially in the winters!

Expect some radha ballavi as well as samosa etc for your snack cravings and yes, do visit ASAP to tickle your sweet tooth!

This is one of the legendary sweet shop in beliaghata.. 
They have 1 or 2 more branches nearby.. I love all the items they serve. Special mention for frozen mishti doi, samosas, khasta kachori and variety of sweetsðŸ˜ƒ

Located opposite trikon park,this sweet shop is very popular. They have huge varities of sweets and namkins. I personally love their singara with chatni... The sweets are also good. Also the shop is very clean and hyginic.
