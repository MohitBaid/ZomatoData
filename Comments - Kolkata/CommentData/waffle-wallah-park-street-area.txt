OK waffles are love! You can't deny it! Be it dessert or Savoury it will make you fall in love for it. Located besides flurys and Spencer this small place is always crowded! And it has a reason for it! Had chocolate fudge waffle in my last visit! It was just mind blowing üòò

This tiny place at the heart of the city serving awesome waffles should be immediately bookmarked by all!

We had ordered -
Savory waffle - Pizza Topping wala with Chicken
Sweet waffle - Strawberry wala waffle

Both tasted delicious. The topping was quite generous. The .5 deduction in rating is only for the price that we felt could be lesser considering the tiny sizes of the waffles.

Service is decent.

Absolutely recomnended!

Dropped by on Christmas Eve after seeing this little joint of Waffles in Park Street. I love waffles so couldn't give it a miss. Tried Death by Chocolate and Nutella and Nuts wala. Both were pretty good. They had a good amount of crunch and lots of toppings. Service was swift inspite of people coming and going :-)

This is a very small joint opened in the heart of the city. The location of this place gives it a plus point. I tried the fruity bliss waffles. The fruits tasted delicious but the quality of the waffles could be better. This is a one time visit for people who don't like the taste of waffles. But if you are a fan, you'll definitely visit again to try their other items like the ones which aren't sweet.

Waffle Wallah! The name itself says something different. Their idea of combination of waffle with veg/non-veg stuff is wonderful. Waffles with pizza is very good idea and they also have many options in chocolate sections and beverages. Ambience is very cool and something creative.. Excited to visit again..

A small joint located next to Spencer's it is well decorated but there's very little space so I would recommend a take away rather than sit and eat there.

Serving different flavors of waffles, I personally liked the Ice Cream and Fudge, and Oreo and Chocolate flavor, but others are also good. The waffle is served in a an open box with one opening but this kind of serving is not the best way to serve a waffle and not convenient if you want to eat with a fork. Even though the flavors are good, the waffle is harder than it should be and difficult to cut through with the fragile plastic fork that they give you. Also, the flavor/toppings are slightly lacking in amount I would say.

This place has created quite a hype and thus I checked it out on 25th December when it was full of customers. We were lucky to get a place to sit quute fast because the place is not that big. We tried the Death by Chocolate and Chicken Keema waffle. I fell in love with both of them. They were very good and prefect in every sense of the term. Will be visiting again and again. üòç

I had chocolate oreo waffle and red velvet waffle which was awesome to taste. The waffles are freshly made as per the orders given and they are perfectly complemented with the cream. The red velvet waffle was the newest item in their menu and it was too awesome with crumbles of red velvet cake as toppings. There options of pizza waffles and others which seemed tasty. Thus, you could find waffles for your tasty tongue as a main course item as well as a dessert. The only issue is the lack of seating arrangement inside the shop; it would be really great if the space could be increased so that people can enjoy the tasty waffles in the store itself.

Went to this cute little place for breakfast. Since it was early and no other place was open, we decided to go here. And am glad we did. 
1. I ordered the all day breakfast egg & waffle and opted for the fried egg. Waffle with cheese topping and a fried egg with chicken sausages on the side. The waffle was crispy, and the combination tasted really good. Thumbs up!
2. My friend ordered the fruit bliss. The presentation of the dish was just so pretty. Waffle topped with cream and fruits. A delicious and healthy meal. 

I had just one complaint about this place, that is the cutlery. The waffle was served with plastic fork and spoons. That was a bit inconvenient, and let's face it, not environment friendly! They can keep this option for takeaway, but I think for people eating in the restaurant they should serve with proper cutlery. 
Also I personally felt the beverages were a little on the expensive side. 

Other than this, a very good experience. The decor was really cute. And I loved the idea of so many variations on waffles. Will definitely visit again to try out other toppings.

Gist : A small sized place with good crispy thin crust pizza, overpriced with respect to quantity but quality is great. They have their own wallet system based on mobile number which gives around 5% cashback which can be redeemed in next order.

I visited this place on 07-01-18 at 11.20AM. Easy to locate. Place has seating option of 15 (4*2 + 2*1 + 1*5). Decor and ambience is great. No toilet or washbasin is there. (In my opinion, a hand sanitizer could be provided atleast). Staffs are prompt and cordial, they also help to choose items. Ordered 1 Large Chicken Keema Wala Waffle and 1 small Ice Cream and Fudge Waffle. They prepare waffle, but still quickly. Chicken Keema was too oily for me, tasted good though. Ice cream and Choco fudge waffle tasted great. It was my first time to eat waffle like this. But they do not have drinking water or neither they ask. (In my opinion, a jug of water can be kept at the tables atleast.) Other sad part is the price, it is costing almost INR 390 (with tax) with respect to the quantity. (For a foodie like me, an unlimited buffet can cost 600-700 where I can eat as much I can, So instead of going here 2 times I can visit a buffet place once.) Great experience overall. But if prices are not slashed by 30%, I am unable to repeat such great experience again.

It's a newly opened place just beside the new Spencer's in Park Street. Where once the famous Music world was located. And also not to forget Au Bon Pain was there in place of Spencer's.
The place holds a sitting of not more than 10-12 seats. It specialises in waffles. Veg and Non veg both. Also have range of dessert waffles in the menu.
We ordered one Hot chocolate and one Death by Chocolate waffle.
The Hot chocolate was quite plain and simple and it is not a place to have hot chocolate.
The waffle tasted good.

The ambience is beautiful, but there's a bit of problem in sitting arrangements. Need to expand the space. Otherwise the service was good and most importantly the waffles. We took one ice cream and choco fudge and one Nutella and nuts. It was perfectly crispy and delicious. Will go there more often.

Though I am a bit sad as this has been made at the place of Au Bon Pain which used to be one of my favorite places. Alright so Waffle Wallah offers various kinds of waffles having both options- Salty and Sweet. All the waffles are tasty,unique and good in size. We had Waffle with Pizza Topping, Fruity bliss, Ice cream and chocolate fudge,choco sauce and praline and Death By Chocolate. Each one of them was droolworthy. I cannot specify a particular to have. Price is reasonable and service is quick. In love with this place.

Heard a lot about the place before going, only to realise it's overhyped. 

Tried two of their sweet waffles:
Chocolate sauce and praline (with Vanilla ice cream add-on)
Fruity bliss (with Nutella add-on)

The waffles were quite average and difficult to eat with the plastic knives and forks provided. The ice cream had already melted over the waffle before it was served to us. The Nutella in the other one was practically absent.

Located between Peter cat and Spencer's, it carries the flavor of the 'Music world' which was once there. It's a small place which seats not more than 10-15 people. Didn't quite expect to manage seats for 3 on Christmas, since most people opted for a take away.

We ordered pizza topping wala with chicken, Peri Peri chicken wala, death by chocolate, red velvet and Oreo and chocolate. We ordered the small portions for all. Death by chocolate is what I literally choose as the best, both on and off the eatery üòâ

The price was reasonable for a fancy, yellow decor overlooking the starry street.

This was my first time having waffles and I was completely happy with my order. I ordered DEATH BY CHOCOLATE. It had a topping of dark chocolate sauce, crumbled brownie pieces and white choco chips. The waffles were crunchy and the topping was rich and sticky,loved it!

Finally visited this place and what better day than 31st December of last year in Park Street! 
The place seems to be in high demand all the time. Not very spacious. So during festive seasons, like yesterday, fetching a seat was an issue. They played pop songs all the time creating a young chirpy ambiance. The waffles- 
‚Ä¢ Paneer tandoori waffle - it was cheesy, spicy, and very delicious. The waffles are tender,fresh and they prepared it very nicely. 
‚Ä¢Ice cream and choco fudge waffle - Mama mia! What a beauty it was! The chocolates penetrating the waffles,the vanilla ice cream scoop on top. Truly a delight. 
‚Ä¢Hot chocolate - overpriced undoubtedly. Have had tastier ones at cheaper prices. 
‚Ä¢Cold coffee- that was good indeed.  

Hope to hop in again some other time to try other waffles.

This is located just beside the Spencer's in park street. The place is a bit small so sometimes you may have to wait for sometime to get in. We went on a Saturday evening so had to wait.
What we ordered : 1 Chicken keema waffle and 1 ice cream and choco fudge waffle. Both were really good specially the ice cream one. If you get the side seats beside the window then you can also see the busy road and chat away your time. The prices are not tax included and they took about 15 minutes to serve the food. Would like to come here again.

A hole in the wall joint at the corner of where our beloved Music World used to be (RIP), The Waffle Wallah is clean and quick. We had the Death by Chocolate waffle and it was crispy perfect and delicious. Would definitely visit again.

This is located just beside the Spencer's in park street. The place is a bit small so sometimes you may have to wait for sometime to get in. We went on a Saturday evening so had to wait.
What we ordered : 1 Chicken keema waffle and 1 ice cream and choco fudge waffle. Both were really good specially the ice cream one. If you get the side seats beside the window then you can also see the busy road and chat away your time. The prices are not tax included and they took about 15 minutes to serve the food. Would like to come here again.

Visited on 25th Dec on the occasion of Christmas day.As the place is very small it was heavily crowded. But the staffs were very dedicated and food was awesome. We tried "Nuttela Banana" and "Death by Chocolate" which I will definitely recommend you to try. Good start for Waffle Wallah. Hope they keep their good quality in future also üëç .

May be introduction of authentic Belgian waffles would help them score the perfect 5. Nevertheless I was satisfied with both my visits. Never thought chicken keema waffles would be a thing but I must say it did not taste a wee bit weird. On the other hand I really liked the combination. I am huge fan of the sweet ones..although I have realised that ice-cream on my waffle is not something i would try again but the Fruity Bliss is a sure item on my next visit. Kolkata really lacked a dedicated waffle parlour and now thanks to Waffle walla, we have one! üòä

Waffles are the trendy things in town. Fresh and crispy. This place has two outlets, one in Park Street Area and the other in the food court of Quest Mall, Ballygunge. The decor was attractive with bright yellow walls, bar stools on one side and pretty lamps hanging from the ceiling. Service was good enough. They mainly serve waffles, which comes in two sizes (small/large), along with some beverages. We ordered -
1) Peri-peri chicken waffle with mushroom and spinach - Waffle was crispy with a lot of toppings of mushroom and chicken. Tasted good. (Rating - 4.0)
2) Ice-cream and choco fudge waffle - The combo of crispy, hot and cold in your mouth is heaven. It was bathed in a generous amount of chocolate sauce which went great with the fresh waffles. (Rating - 4.5)
3) Nutella and nuts waffle - This is the best of what we had. Nutella and waffles are a match made in heaven. Every bite with make you go "yummmmm". A must must try! (Rating - 5.0)
To summarize, the waffles are worth trying. But, the portion of the small waffles could be better, it's just enough for one. Price is very reasonable. Going back to try the rest of the menu. Happy eating. :)

A small place with big menu! It is a perfect place for dessert! I had ordered a Nutella and banana waffle and a red velvet waffle! They looked luscious and tasted even better! The first one was very creamy and perfectly sweet and was love at first bite. The latter tasted exactly you are having a red velvet cake! The staff was very polite and service was quick! It is near flurys and easy to locate, and a nice view of Park Street from inside! I would love to visit soon to try the fruit waffle! Happy eating!

The best waffles I've had in Kolkata! The death by chocolate waffle is a treat for all the chocolate lovers and a must try. Choco praline waffle is one of my favorites too because it's a mix of whip cream and chocolate.
Oreo, red velvet and Choco fudge are simples but they taste good too.
They also serve savory waffles like pizza waffles and Peri Peri mushroom waffles which are a must try.
This place serves the best and the tastiest waffles in Kolkata and should be a must to visit.

When you mention European breakfast and street food, I think Waffle. These Belgain beauties have become popular all over the world now and rightly so and it was only a matter of time till the city of joy would start getting dedicated Waffle joints. Waffle Wallah has come to Kolkata now and set up shop in two of the most happening places in the city. The Park Street outlet is located right next to Spencers where Au Bon Pain used to be. 
Bright yellow interiors, catchy phrases on the walls and pretty lights hanging overhead, this place is aesthetic. It is a small outlet and seats about 15 people with the seats right next to the big glass window being the best as you can watch the hustle and bustle of Park Street while munching on some delicious waffles. 
Lets talk about the food here now. Here's what we ordered- 

->Breakfast Egg&Waffle(Akuri with Sausages)- Oh what a delight! I could have this for breakfast every day. Crispy waffles with eggs and sausages make the best breakfast ever!

->Peri Peri Mushroom, Spinach with Chicken- Spicy Peri Peri chicken with chicken, spinach and cheese. Already sounds delicious. The toppings being plentiful on this one made it a delight as you get a lot of the flavors with each bite. Definitely recommended. 

->Fruity Bliss- Couldn't have been more aptly named. Bliss was what having this was. Freshly whipped cream, honey and the freshness and tang from the various fruits and berries on top made this an absolute delight. Definitely my favorite waffle that I have tasted here yet. 

-> Death by Chocolate- This was loaded with dark chocolate, brownie dust and white chocolate chips. This is definitely for the hardcore sweet lovers. I'd suggest adding ice cream to this while ordering as it will help balance out the intense sweetness from this waffle as well as help you wash it down more easily. 

They also serve beverages and we washed them down with Cappuccino, Cafe Latte and Cafe Mocha. All the beverages were served hot and were a great complement to the waffles. 

So drop by any time you are in the vicinity of Park Street and you will certainly leave with a smile. 

Pro Tip: A large serving is actually quite large and people just looking for a small snack should for the small serving. A filling meal for two will be within INR 400/- 

Thank you Waffle Wallah for your service. Do plan to drop in soon.

Waffles are currently one of the most loved food items the millennial has witnessed. Kolkata has been host to quite a few joints that are dedicated to this scrumptious Belgian beauty. One of them is Waffle Wallah at Park Street. Located conveniently where ABP Cafe was housed, this one is a tiny 10 seater which dishes up lipsmacking waffles within minutes.

I personally wasn't a fan of savoury waffles till I came here. 

Ambience : A very eye catchy and pretty little joint. Mostly bright yellow interiors and whacky lights, this place is an instant hit. Also the glass window view is something you must not miss. Try grabbing a  seat right next to the window to lazily munch of waffles and look at the hustle and bustle of the iconic Park Street!

Without further ado, here's what we ordered -

‚Ä¢ Breakfast Egg & Waffle (akuri with sausages) - By far my favourite waffle here. I can have this for breakfast almost everyday. Amazing akuri with sausages on the side. A must try!

‚Ä¢ Peri Peri Mushroom, Spinach with Chicken - This savoury waffle was equally amazing. Loved the kick from the peri peri sauce and the savoury notes from the mushroom, spinach and chicken. Do not give this a miss.

‚Ä¢ Fruity Bliss - this is basically waffle drizzled with honey and a good helping of whipped cream. Garnished with fruits on top. This was absolutely refreshing and very different. 

‚Ä¢ Death by Chocolate - Chocolate waffle loaded with brownies, rich chocolate fudge and choco chips. This is slightly on the drier side but we had coffee along with it to wash this down.

We also ordered Cafe Latte, Cappuccino and Cafe Mocha. The coffee was pretty standard.

Tip : Blow the horn near the counter if you like their food. It's all good spirits in here.

A meal here would set you back by INR 400/- for two.

A little small place but a nice place with quirky interior and friendly staff. 

I asked them which one should I order (I wanted some color for the picture) and they suggested "Fruity Bliss with Ice cream". 
When I took the first bite it felt like heavenüòçüíó
My friend took "Mera Wala Waffle-Sweet Wala"

Also it's not hard to locate the place. It's just opposite to McDonald's, Parkstreet. 

And the price is also relatively okay. Fruity Bliss with Ice cream costed me Rs. 158.

** Location = Stephen Court, Park Street, just beside the spencers.

**Brief = Paid a visit recently to try out the intriguing waffles and initially I was skeptical but they turned out to be real good.

** Ambiance/Decor = They lack space, around 15-17 people can sit but the place was really cramped up during my visit owing to the Christmas Festival, nevertheless the staffs were courteous and were trying their best to handle the crowd. Full marks to them. Service is quick as well.

** Things tried = I ordered two waffles - Ice cream and choco fudge(small) and Oreo and Chocolate(small) with add on ice cream.
Waffles are actually a dish prepared from dough/batter and then given shapes and sizes as desired.
I loved both the waffles, as the name says the oreo and chocolate had oreo biscuits as the toppings.

** Recommended = Oreo and Chocolate waffle(small).

** Purse Check = The bill was Rs.326/-(AI), I would say Rs.300-350/- would be good enough to taste some quirky waffles.¬†

**Overall = They have a huge variety and definitely would drop by for more. Cheers.

A not so difficult to locate joint serving the favorite European street food, Waffles.

Bright colors, cute decors and great waffles is how I would define the place.

Coming to the food. The waffles come in quite surprising flavors.

Among all the amazing waffles they offer this particular dessert waffle is my favorite.

Named the fruity bliss and available in a regular and large size is this beautiful waffle with loads of fresh exotic fruits, freshly whipped cream and Honey!

The breakfast waffle with eggs, akuri or massala omelette served with sausages is quite a stunner among the savory waffles along side the peri peri waffles.

The waffles come in two sizes a regular and a large. Honestly I find the regular one pretty fulfilling for one.

A tiny outlet located just beside Spencer's, Park Street. The interior is nicely decorated with seating arrangements for 15-17 people. This was the first time I had waffle. I ordered Death by Chocolate with Ice cream and the name truly justifies. The perfect combination of hot waffle and ice cream was too good. Will definitely be coming back here to try out other waffles. Service was pretty quick.

To satisfy our Xmas night cravings, we decided to try out Waffle Wallah right across the street from our hotel. The shop was small but colorfully decorated & crowded with people. We gave our order and had to wait for a while to get the seat but once our order came, the wait was worth it! Death by chocolate & Nutella with nuts satisfies the sugaholics while the chicken keema & the peri peri waffle is quite filling & yummyyyy!!! Great going guys üëçüëçüëç

While it's great that they do savoury waffles, the sweet Death by Chocolate waffle we had was average. Chewy waffle, dry toppings of mixed choco chips. The plus was that it wasn't over-sweet. This may fly otherwise but I think they are quite a few better options for waffles in the city these days.

Not very difficult to locate. It is just where Au Bon Pain used to be, adjacent to Spencer's food mart.
Small joint with very limited seating. There's usually a queue at busy hours.
We tried the -
Peri peri mushroom and spinach (non veg) waffle: Tasted pretty good.
All day breakfast waffle with fried egg: The waffle was hot and crisp, but I wasn't happy with the fried egg. The yolk was scattered and dry.
Fruity Bliss: A beautiful looking waffle perfect for Instagram photos, but not as much for your tastebuds. The waffle was hot and topped with fresh fruits - it tasted pretty much like warm soggy fruits! Not recommended.

Overall, decent experience. Price is a little on the higher side.

The restaurant is very small and so it was very congested. The interior was good.
Now coming to the waffle, I ordered ice cream and chocolate fudge waffle.
It tasted more like crunchy cornflakes with ice cream and chocolate sauce. Nothing extraordinary. It costs Rs 126 with tax.

We ordered a (large) ice-cream chocolate fudge waffle. The ice cream on the top was really yummy.

But, I loved the savoury ones more‚ù£. It was really soft and had a good amount of toppings on itüëçüèª. Do try out this place. I'm sure you'll love their waffles tooüíØ.

Great location nd funky ambience but the waffles were a bit disappointing. After shelling out 400 bucks for a large Nutella waffle with two scoops of ice cream u atleast expect that the waffles should be filled with a lot of Nutella . However they gave a minimum amount of Nutella sufficient to for u to know that it's Nutella . Besides I tried the pizza waffle, which innovative nd tastes like a Dominos pizza but I'll suggest to eat a normal pizza that a waffle one coz the waffle one gets doggy soon...

This place sells really scrummy waffles!!!Their savoury and sweet waffles can be eaten as a snack as well as a substantial meal!!!
We ordered- 
Pizza topping waffle veg
Peri peri mushroom and spinach with chicken 
Tandoori paneer
Fruity bliss 
Death by chocolate 
The waffles were mildly crispy from outside and soft from inside and were loaded generously with delicious toppings!!!

This waffle parlour has lovely decor ..cool filament bulb lights hanging from the ceiling,a glass window overlooking the Park Street and has a classic yellow french door !!!
The only downside of this joint is the fact that it's too small..it can't accommodate more than 16 people..so it gets really difficult to eat leisurely and spend some time with your pals after you're done eating since people wait outside to get seated!!!

A new waffle place in park street. A funky and colourful place , where are made to realize that waffle are not only sweet but can the salty and spicy as well.
This place is located beside spencer and flurys. This a small place  2 to 3 tables so place get crowded quite easily. The mirror and the street side window is a great concept and a favourite of mostly kids and youngsters.
The menu is small but serves a variety of waffle chicken , vegetables and also sweet.
I tried their chicken keema walla waffle which was spicy and delicious. 
Pizza topping walla with chicken was another non veg item which was way better than a small pizza. The toppings were colourful and tasted really good...this became one of my favourites as well. 
Lastly their  death by chocolate is a part of their sweet category was really good and the hot melted chocolate just made a perfect ending .
The total experience was good with grooving playlist and a colourful ambience is a perfect place to hangout with friends and catch up with old friends especially on a winter evening.

Located in the heart of the city, the Park Street area right next to the newly opened Spencer's, is this cosy little waffle place. With a visit during the Christmas week amidst a beautifully lit Park street, places like these warm your heart! 

Here's what we ordered:

1) Peri Peri chicken, Spinach and Mushroom waffle- At the outset, i was disappointed with the taste of it, especially after reading many good reviews about it. Gradually, it didn't taste all that bad. Maybe it's the spiced mayonnaise or maybe it's an acquired taste. Doesn't matter as long as your tummy's happy! 

2) Pizza topping chicken waffle- This one was delish! Or maybe it's cause pizzas and pizza related is forever love! 

3) Death by chocolate waffle with ice cream- This brought our visit to a happy ending albeit with too sweet an aftertaste. It is delicious though but leaves you with a feeling of sweetness overloaded. 

Overall, like i said earlier, very cosy a place. Do drop in with friends or all by yourself (keeping in mind the limited seating)!

Here the ambiance is great as its warm and funky.
The mirrors and the street view,the pop colors and grooving music.
Unlike other places here we get waffles which are spicy also the sweet ones are there.
They tastes yummy and you will feel like having another one.
They give a lot of toppings and makes it more delicious.
The service is fast and the price is affordable.
Its a good place to go and eat and enjoy.
The space is a bit small to fit in many people at a time.
Must try the pizza toppings ,death by chocolate and chicken keema.

Delicious!!!! That's the one word that pops into my mind when I think of waffle walla.... Well the memory is still very fresh as I just went there yesterday! My friend and I found ourselves parked on one of the high stools over looking the park street- free school Street crossing... And what a view that was... With the imposing colonial building looking over us and as the evening proceeded Santa Clause started twinkling from his Street side pedestal!!! It is a small eatery fellas.... So if you want to stay inside in this cold winter.... Grab your seats early... Else... Feel free to sit on the steps of what was once Music world! 
Now to the business at hand.... The waffles were to die for.... I ordered the Peri peri mushroom, cheese and chicken and she ordered the banana Nutella with generous helping of whipped cream.... And both were mouth wateringly delicious!!!! The coffee was adequate, nothing to write home about, nevertheless worthy of a small mention.
The only downer was the third waffle that we gluttons ordered.... The death by chocolate... It was a little dry... With crumbled brownie, chocolate chips ( white and dark) and a drizzle of chocolate sauce and a solid ice cream on top... it didn't have  the succulence of the previous waffles... But did love upto its name... They promised us chocolate... And chocolate was there in abundance... I only wished there was whipped cream instead of the hard ice cream.... It would have made the waffle.... May be a few chopped walnuts.... But I shall return there soon... For in my opinion few things top waffles, in Park Street, during Christmas

Delicious!!!! That's the one word that pops into my mind when I think of waffle walla.... Well the memory is still very fresh as I just went there yesterday! My friend and I found ourselves parked on one of the high stools over looking the park street- free school Street crossing... And what a view that was... With the imposing colonial building looking over us and as the evening proceeded Santa Clause started twinkling from his Street side pedestal!!! It is a small eatery fellas.... So if you want to stay inside in this cold winter.... Grab your seats early... Else... Feel free to sit on the steps of what was once Music world! 
Now to the business at hand.... The waffles were to die for.... I ordered the Peri peri mushroom, cheese and chicken and she ordered the banana Nutella with generous helping of whipped cream.... And both were mouth wateringly delicious!!!! The coffee was adequate, nothing to write home about, nevertheless worthy of a small mention.
The only downer was the third waffle that we gluttons ordered.... The death by chocolate... It was a little dry... With crumbled brownie, chocolate chips ( white and dark) and a drizzle of chocolate sauce and a solid ice cream on top... it didn't have  the succulence of the previous waffles... But did love upto its name... They promised us chocolate... And chocolate was there in abundance... I only wished there was whipped cream instead of the hard ice cream.... It would have made the waffle.... May be a few chopped walnuts.... But I shall return there soon... For in my opinion few things top waffles, in Park Street, during Christmas

It is a small outlet near spencers in Park Street. Having our dinner elsewhere we came to this place for a post-meal snack. We tried the chicken keema walla and pizza topping walla with chicken waffles and they were quite good, especially the first one. I will say that the place is a bit expensive, but no complaints about the food.

Located just beside Flurys and Spencer's,Waffle Wallah is a cute outlet. I visited the it on 8th December'17. I constantly heard about this place from many of my friends and I saw posts regarding it on Instagram/Facebook and the reviews on Zomato were mouth watering. And mostly everyone appreciated "DEATH BY CHOCOLATE" and honestly speaking I couldn't wait to taste it.

Yes,its a self service cafe. There is a horn kind of a thing attached to the wall for the customers to press it if they found the Waffles good.
Location of the outlet is perfect!‚ù§
The interiors are really very comforting. The place is small and cosy. It is not suitable for accommodating a large crowd which is actually and good thing.
People walk in ask for a parcel and leave usually as I saw that day when I there for almost an hour.
The crowd was pretty much decent.
The staffs were friendly and quite helpful.
Service was prompt within 5 to 10 mins.
I was quite pleased with the location and interiors and arrangements of the cafe,but the waffle wasn't up to the mark.
I've tried waffles at many other place but the waffle out here were very dry and it became like rubber within 5 mins of serving.
Just because of the rubber like taste we had to get our 1 waffle packed and we walked out a bit disappointed.
Maybe it was that day that the waffle wasn't made up to the mark. But my friends who visited before me told that the Waffles of Waffle Wallah are really soft and spongy and taste the same even after 20 mins of getting it packed.
I would appreciate if the quality of the product is once reviewed.

A small outlet near Spencer in park street. 
The ambience of the place is calm and nice. The songs they played just goes with the mood.
Staff was good but service was very very slow. We waited for like 20-25 minutes. 
But the food was worth it, tho the quantity was a little disappointing. 
I had ordered a death by chocolate waffle, with ice cream and a spinach mushroom with peri peri chicken waffle. Both were undoubtedly very tasty.
A must try for waffle lovers.

Though the waffles are pretty hard provided , either make them belgium soft or provide a knife to have it with üòÇüòÇ. Anyways good experience. The staffs were courteous.

Being located in the city's favourite corner that previously housed iconic names like Music World and Au Bon Pain, Waffle Wallah already carries on its shoulders the tremendous burden of living up to the expectations of people frequenting Park Street. The dazzlingly "lit" space instantly attracts a lot of attention. The quirky honking horn style lights and bright decor is totally instagrammable and hence draws the youth in large numbers. The seating capacity is inadequate though, max of 15 people can be seated at once and there's hardly any additional space to stand and eat. However, I feel people are willing to risk all for the love of waffles, come hell or high water. Coming to the food, we ordered the cheapest options from both sweet n salty, being on a perennial shoe string budget. Chipotle n Cheese in salty and Honey n Maple Syrup is sweet. After a preparation time of 10 mins we finally were served our guilty pleasures with admirably generous amounts of topping. The salty waffle was bomb, an unbelievably delicious explosion of taste. Fresh spicy chipotle and cheese that had a lovely burnt flavour. Luuurved it! The sweet waffle was kinda meh though, a bit greasy all over. Nothing out of the world or anything. Service was great, no complains therein. Prices are very reasonable and only a miniscule taxation. I'll love to go back for the thrill of salty waffles n some horribly nice pictures while sitting n watching the city go by from the loveliest corner of Kolkata.

Cosy place,  although it gets crowded more often than not.  Good decor, I like how they've managed to fit in the aesthetics without it looking all cramped up. 

The waffle is soft,  I miss the crunch to it.  Flavors are good.  
Salty waffles wasn't my cup of tea! Mentally restricted to the idea of it being a sweet dish.  

Worth a visit,  though!

I am a sincere waffle lover and when I got to know the joint has finally opened in Park Street, I was in cloud 9 because it meant to grab a waffle during college breaks.
However to a bit disappointment they are slow in service and the waffle we ordered was completely blended in cream and gave less waffle taste. The place is also small and cannot accommodate more than 6-7 people.

A very small cutesy place located near Flury's.
They have very limited seating arrangements.
The service is fast enough. The decor is pretty.
What we ordered:
1- Ice cream and choco fudge Wala(big) - Rs220. Tasted damn good but I think they should provide better spoons and knives because it gets very messy trying to eat the waffle using the plastic spoons and all.
2- Death by chocolate (big)- Rs270
Tasted sweeter than the ice cream and choco fudge.
3- pizza toppingwala with chicken (big)-140
Best one. It has generous toppings and good quantity of cheese! Loved this one. Went for a second one too!
Definitely coming back for more!

Visited this place sometime back. Well, it is a small outlet, with few tables and chairs and a brightly painted interior. The interior is cozy and beautiful, and the view from the glass window is amazing as well, and why not, after all, it is at the very place where Au Bon Pain used to exist.

I had one large 'Ice Cream and Choco Fudge Waffle'. The waffle was good, kind of crispy and they gave two vanilla scoop ice creams with chocolate syrup on top of it. I found the waffles a bit overpriced.¬†

Since I was already full that day, couldn't taste the other "salty wala" waffles. Hope to try those the next time.

Small. Check.

So in short this place has a thumbs up from me. Located right next to Peter Cat this waffle place has newly opened its doors in Kolkata. And it‚Äôs completely won my heart. The decor is nice and charming. The place is quite literally tiny with just three tables and some bar stools but that‚Äôs the charm of this place to some extent. I have tried the peri peri chicken waffle, chocolate and praline waffle and death by chocolate one. They‚Äôre simple delicious. The peri peri chicken one had chicken cheese and mayonnaise and was simply finger licking good. I had asked for a generous amount of whipped cream on the praline one and the staff obliged to my request with a smile. However, it lacked the praline flavour completely. But nonetheless the waffles were beautifully cooked and I‚Äôd love to go back to taste some more.

Kolkata is flooded with lots of waffle store this year.. but this one a little different in taste and decor both..This place has a sitting arrangement for 10-15 people and serves you with a variety of sweet,specially savory waffles too..
I tried the non- veg wala large waffle which serves two person..It costed me Rs.220/- (including taxes), which is little expensive as per the quantity...

Waffles are the new 'it' thing in Kolkata and this place is one such popular place serving tasty treats. Located near Flurys, Park street, (where au bon pain was located formerly), this a small place offering a street view(the busy Park street crossing).
 I had the much hyped 'death by chocolate waffle'(small one).  The waffle was soft and generously topped with white and dark chocolate, justifying the name quite well. Absolutely droolworthy!!

The ambience was quaint and the lighting and decorations were charming.We ordered a large Chocolate Fudge and ice cream waffle from the sweet section and From the savoury section, we ordered a Pizza Toppings with Chicken, which basically consists of Mozzarella Cheese and capsicum and onions and tomatoes. They looked good but the quantity was too small for the price they were charging. And they were not crunchy enough, the waffle bearing the ice cream had gotten pretty soggy rather quickly. But the presentation was nice , so they have that going for them .
Overall , I might visit the place another time to taste the other varieties , but they need to either lower down the price or increase the quantity .

Amazing waffles both in savoury and sweet. We ordered for a Peri Peri mushroom and spinach waffle and a fruity bliss and both were too good. But since I like waffles sweet better I enjoyed fruity bliss more although both were extremely good. It's a small place in park street where au bon pain was located, next to flurys. Worth every penny I would say.

So this is the trending new waffle restaurant in town right now. I dropped in with a friend last week. It didn't disappoint :D It's actually a really tiny outlet. There's both sweet and salty waffles on offer. I had the pizza toppings Walla waffle followed by a Death by Chocolate. The first was really tasty and cheesy. The latter was perfect, though a little more chocolate would have been great. My friend had a basic egg waffle followed by a banana honey waffle topped with icecream. I'm definitely going back for more.

A small shop serving chocolate and other waffles,with cool decor and cosy seating arrangements,a perfect selfie zone but some how the combination of crunchy waffles and chocolate or Nutella didn't go Dt well and wasn't something to end up saying "yummy" or "a must try".Maybe,jus a one time visit is fine.Below are the pictures of 
‚Ä¢Oreo and chocolate
‚Ä¢ Nutella and nuts Wala wt vanilla ice cream.

Visited this restaurant tonight, which is located beside spencer (erstwhile au bon pain). Though its a small place it looks like a cafe in london üòú. Ordered pizza topping wala chicken (small), a cup of americano, a cup of cappuccino and atlast a death by chocolate(small) waffle. They took 10 minutes to get it ready. Taste wise, the savoury waffle was awesome with mozzarella, capsicum,tomato and chicken. Death by chocolate was also good with brownie, layered with chocolate sauce and white chocolate chips. Now coming to the coffees, they were unexpectedly served in large paper glasses instead of cups. Both tasted average even after mixing 3 sachets of brown sugar. Wish to try their hot chocolate the next time i visit.

This place has opened in the iconic music world area of park street in place of au bon pain.
Ambience- though almost 1/6th of au bon pain's total surface area, it makes up for it with its fun decor and good vibes.
Order- pizza topping wala waffle (large) and nutella and nuts wala waffle (small).
Food- this was my first brush with a savoury waffle and i must say I quite liked it. It was cheesy, saucy and though a waffle base is entirely different from a pizza dough but taste wise it did remind me of a pizza!
However what actually stole my heart was the nutella and nut waffle. It had a really generous serving of nutella over a soft fresh warm waffle with some whipped cream and nuts. Loved it!
Pocket pinch- 460 with tax.
Overall- definitely worth a try especially for the nutella waffles!

Death by Chocolate was truly a sinful treat.

This small place in Park Street is bliss. Introducing salty waffle to the city waffle wallah serves a variety of waffles one cannot imagine. I was here with my sister and we ordered for peri peri chicken waffle, mushroom spinach and chicken waffle, chocolate overload waffle and butter waffle with whipped cream and banana. All the items were worth tasting. I personally liked the salty waffles more. 
Coming to service, the attendants are so well behaved and courteous. Had a lovely experience.

Just one minor improvement needs to be done that is to increase the seating capacity.

The love for waffles is eternal and when a joint which specializes in making some irresistible waffles you have to visit it . 

This new outlet at Park Street just beside Flury's may be small but has the right feels to it . Amazing decor with quirky quotes on the yellow walls . Has a couple of tables and 4-5 high stools to enjoy your waffle with a glimpse of ' The Park Street ' . 

We didn't opt for the ' salty wala waffles ' , so ' sweet wala ' it was . Ordered a " Death By Chocolate " first and it was mind blowing to say the least . White chocolate chips on a bed of hot sizzling mashed brownies topped with Chocolate sauce made for a amazing waffle . 
Next we ordered a Honey Nd Butter Waffle . This was unexpectedly good . I would like you to try this one in particular when you are there . 

Service : It's self service like all McD , KFC , Naturals outlets . But ya , they prepared the waffles real quick . 

Pocket Pinch : 300 for 2 . 

RECOMMENDED :)

Its a very cutely decorated little parlour. I personally found the decor to b very cool. Brightly coloured. The ceilings resembles the waffle shapes. 
Coming to food it serves both salty and sweet waffles... 
We ordered:
1. Pizza topping wala with chicken - It had well cooked chicken and dried cheese and a little spicy sauce which altogether tasted delicious.
        The waffles were warm and crunchy           
        enough.
2. Ice cream and choco fudge- It had an ice cream cube on the crunchy warm waffles filled with chocolate sauce... 
The taste of both were absolutely delicious... 
Worth the price... 
A worth try also a must visit... will surely visit again... 
(And also not to forget its a very good place for pic addicts coz the bright yellow background and beautiful lights will surely fetch u great pictures... it‚Äôs surely a photogenic place...üòâ)

Located just beside Flury's  Park Street , this waffle wallah outlet opened just 2 weeks back and I am quite happy this city is becoming a place for Waffle Lovers.The interior is very prettily decorated and the ceilings resemble waffle shaped. Being in the centre of Park Street , it is very easy to locate 

WHAT I ORDERED :

1.PERI PERI MUSHROOM & SPINACH : Trust me I closed my eyes the entire time I was eating .It is so good, it will play with your taste buds. The mushroom and the spinach topping is just out of the world.Amazing.Must Try 

2.NUTELLA  & NUTS WALA : If you are an ardent nutella lover and also a waffle lover,then this blend is amazing .The waffle is totally covered in Nutella and nuts are a topping .Crispy and perfect dessert .Do try .

3.APPLE & ORANGE JUICE : Served in glass bottles ,which are sealed , and made of fresh apple and orange juice concentrate,it was quite refreshing .

The service is quite fast ,the decor is amazing ,the waffles are like they just came out of heaven , a place you would visit ,once you have already visited.

The seating area is small, but that won‚Äôt matter once you start digging into the waffles. We had Ice cream waffles with hot chocolate sauce. It was heavenly. Though it was quite sweet, it was something we usually don‚Äôt get in most of the other waffle stores of the city.

Firstly, Waffle Wallah welcome to Kolkata..
Located just beside flurys in park street, is this cutely decorated waffle parlor selling both salty and sweet waffles.
The interior of this parlor is very cute and the best part about this cafe is its park street viewing high rise seats.
I really liked the cute ceiling of the cafe which resembles a waffle
Now, coming to the waffles we ordered
1) DEATH BY CHOCOLATE
2) CHOCO SAUCE AND PRALINE ONE in small varient.
Death by chocolate contains chocolate cookies, chocolate sauce, choco chips and all the goodness of chocolate. The waffle was perfectly made and was very soft.
Though, the death by chocolate is mostly raved, but for me choco praline was the show stopper.
Fresh cream, with chocolate sauce, choco sauce and praline balls were a treat to the mouth. It was very tasty.
The small varient was sufficient for both of us.
The staff members were welcoming and courteous. And there is also a horn on the side of the billing counter which u can press if u r impressed with the service. Overall, loved the place and the food.
Highly recommended ü§ó

This is a small shop at Park street for very small hungers. You have to choose your treat from a very thin range of menu. Staff behaviour is good but they seem to need more training on their style of work. Have a seat at the window side... You might enjoy your waffle a bit more.

It‚Äôs a new place in town and is really good. They have a variety of waffles from salty to sweet. And guess what, you get all eggless waffles here which is the best part for a vegetarian. I ordered a Fruity Bliss and one Ice-cream & Fudge which was satisfying enough. Do visit to have a new waffle experience. And it‚Äôs amazing how they‚Äôve set themselves up in a small corner fully utilising the space, which is also pretty! 

Overall - Will visit again.

Located at the prime location where the Music World was,this little shop offers you Waffles full of happiness!
I went with my friend and we ordered Death by Chocolate and Fruity Delight- both small. I rejected having ice-cream on my chocolate waffle because I was suffering from cold. Damn.
Nonetheless Death By Chocolate is loaaaaaaded with chocolate! The warm crunchy waffle is filled with chocolate sauce, warm brownie and chocolate chips-both white and dark.
Fruity Delight is quite delightful indeed. It was loaded with fresh cream,whipped cream,cherries,blueberries,pomegranates and white chocolate chips. Its a wonderful combination of sweet and sour.
Next time I visit I will try the salty waffles.
The space isnt much. Its really cramped with the the waffle making counter taking up most of it. The decor is quirky. Bulbs are hung from horns! The glass jars are a lovely addition.

We finally visited this place last day (located beside the Spencers where formerly Au Bon Pain was situated) and we ordered savoury waffles only.
We took:
‚ô°Chicken Keema Wala waffle: The keema pieces were cooked well and the spices catered to my tastebuds. As for the cheese, it was that typical dried up cheese usually found in any random food outlet. There was a layer of sauce on the underside of the keema filling and it added to the taste.
‚ô°Tandoori Paneer Waffle: The paneer pieces were  having a really strong Tandoori flavour, moreover the sauce used was a kebab mint flavoured chutney. It was quite impressive.
Commenting on the waffles separately, the waffles were crispy when eaten hot. Probably the savoury waffles have a bread like texture, I can't be sure if that is supposed to be so.
The space utilization and decoration is logical and appreciable. It has a bright look, which is a plus point for me. Since, it's mostly self service, I can only say we had a smooth ordering and billing process.

Went (obviously) with

Surely one of the best places to have waffles from in Kolkata, but saying that it is expensive according to the amount served. But the waffles are nice and crispy from outside and soft from inside, as like by all.

An extremely small joint,located just beside the newly opened Spencer's, at Park Street.
The decor is not overworked yet with the help of the lighting,the place seems pretty lively, with a classic feel to it.The capacity is too less, max.10-12 people at a time. Special mentions for the "waffle ceiling" and the "horn-blowing" idea !!
We just ordered 1 variety of waffle - "Death by Chocolate" (with added ice-cream).Now, it's something really amazing by the look of it, as well as it's overwhelming taste.The vanilla ice-cream, with the super-delicious chocolate gels well with the decently hard waffle,making it one of the best things I've had at Park Street till date !! The fillings including choco + white chips add to it's delight !! 1 waffle is enough for 2 people.
Yet I would say that charging Rs.224(inclusive of taxes) for just a waffle is asking for way too much !!

It's a wonderful place, with really appealing ambience,definitely worth a try.But yes, they just HAVE to bring down their prices a bit.
Overall, give it a try.You'll come out really happy.And definitely, the place itself would make you visit it again !! Will definitely try their salty waffles next time and update this review !! :D

A rather new concept in the city, waffle wallah does due justice to the idea behind it. 
They have a huge array of flavours for the size of the joint, and the staff do enough justice to make your experience worth the visit. 
You're always welcomes with a smile and you have the option of blowing the horn if you're happy. 
The joint is aptly decked and the interiors are extremely well done. 
Around park Street with a limited budget and a hungry stomach, Waffle Wallah is a healthy and tempting option we have.

The space is too small. It cannot accommodate more than 10 people. So going with a group is not possible. Though the food tasted good but the quantity served was too less.

Discovered this place in Park Street while I was there for newly opening Spencer's beside it and I was super excited. Zomatofied for menu and  reviews what made me surprised was salted waffles, till then I didn't know that these even existed. Came here very this Saturday with my friend.
Small but very Impressive ambience, short and crisp menu display. 
We ordered Nutella & Nuts wala sweet waffle with ice cream and Pizza toppings wala salted waffles along with orange juice.
Being a die heart chocolate I will be little baised for Nutella waffles, it was super delicious crispy outside and soft inside full of nuts. Coming to pizza wala waffle, it was good and tasted as its name though I felt it could have been better if pizza sauce was a little less because it was a bit over tangy for us.

Orange Juice was our take away, and this was only the WORST part. It didn't work for us AT ALL, we literally threw that away just after one sip each. I don't know what went wrong and this the ONLY reason my rating is not 5/5.

Staff were smiling all through and were polite. We didn't have to wait much for our order.
I was also intrigued by "eat and honk" ritual.
All in all it was a great experience (except for the juice, obviously), would love to visit soon.

Had my first waffle here. Did not like it. Basic honey and butter flavour. Quality and texture of the waffle was good, some how the total combination did not go well. Will try the salty waffle later maybe.

It's just ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ and more. I am talking about the sweet waffles, we had 4 kind today, ice cream and choco fudge, choco sauce and praline, fruity bliss and  death by chocolate. And all of them were just tooo good... People with sweet teeth like like me, can die here in peace. I myself got the fruity bliss one, ya it do not looking appealing like chocolates... but yes BLISS!!! it isüòç. They add white choco chips in the waffles, waffles are crunchy, has taste of their own, also I don't know what or where but they had added something either in cream or waffles don't know, but it gave it a nice crunch and with that fruity flavour, it has my total heart. However, placed is crouched up, and there is not much place to move around. An pocket pinch is also good. And they have their pretty "waffle wala" ceiling‚ù£. However,  I will say go for small size for sweet waffles, add ice cream to it. And you are set!!!

The place is very nicely decorated, being in the landmark area it can be easily spotted. The decor is cozy and innovative. Coming to the food, they have both savoury and sweet waffles. The waffles are nice, bit hard to eat but is tasty. 
The pictures below has the death by chocolate waffle and banana nutella waffle.
