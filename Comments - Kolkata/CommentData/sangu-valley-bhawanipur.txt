This place used to be my most favourite cheap eatery during my broke college days. I love their cutlets, their mixed noodles, fried rice and kabiraji. However I don't like their chicken side dishes as somehow I do not like they way they cook it. Overall, a great place for college goers.

Average. Neither ambience nor cleanliness is up to the mark. The wash basin is situated beside some kind of unhygenic place and the smell is disgusting. The restaurant is like a long tunnel with cabins. The price is quite cheap. Didn't like the chowmin, nor the boneless chicken. The fried rice was good. The thing is that it is a very old resto and need to improve and make it modern. Looks like it is far behind other restaurants. The non-cabin seats are a very bad and less spacey, also the place is very dirty. You will not feel like sitting after 5-10 mins. Not recommended. Better spend some more bucks and visit a better restaurant.

Tasted mixed chowmine from Sangu Valley, and decided to have office lunch once again.
This time we ordered fish fry, mixed fired rice , chicken Manchurian boneless.
The fish fry was very street food style. The fish was almost missing. For that consider the price it's only RS 35 , even though the fish was hardly visible the taste was somewhat ok. The mixed fried rice was loaded wait boiled chicken , fried egg, and small prawns. The fried rice was good, had the smokey wok flavour. The chicken Manchurian was very mediocre. The boneless chicken had thick cornflour coating, however the dish was tasty and the chicken was soft.
In all good place to have moderately good Chinese in tight budget..

Came to this place yesterday with my sister. This place was long due as it's one of those old cabin restaurants of Kolkata nurturing the memories of our parents' young age dates.
Ambience is very basic, like the ones of the same category restaurants. Cleanliness is hardly there. Water served in glasses contained mud remains as well. Adjusting all of these, we sat down and tried a few things -
1. Fish Fry - Tasted very basic. Moderate amount of fish, served with a papad, salad and kasundi. Not recommended, price is okayish. 
2. Mutton Afghani - The gravy mutton cutlet. This tastes better. The gravy was too spicy and oily topped with green peas and synthetic cherries. 
Overall experience was okayish. If you're on a spree to explore the cabin restaurants of Kolkata, then Sangu Valley should be on your list. Otherwise, I would ask you to avoid it because there is nothing about the ambience, even food is not out of the world as well. Happy Dining! :)

NEVER. EVER. EAT. HERE. Seriously. Only try this place if you have a death wish, or are trying to bunk exams on pretext of food poisoning. Absolutely no sense of hygiene. The food tasted stale. By the way, we ordered special fried rice, and chilli chicken. Absolutely tasteless food, with no seasoning at all. The tables are so unclean that it makes you wanna puke. This might have been a gem in the olden days, but it's prudent to admit that this is a place to avoid if you really care for your health.

This place is one of the oldest restaurant in Bhawanipur currently runned my the 3rd generation most probably. I have tired the Mughlai Paratha (its made of only egg No mutton keema) (which is okay for the price they charge) & Chicken Chow. I haven't tried the chicken side dished as i dint like the colour - quality. Chowmein was testy but very oily Mughlai Paratha was also nice & well fried. 
Overall its a okay place. Pocket friendly. The place needs complete renovations and also innovation.

Location : Bhawanipur, a few meters walk from Bijoli cinema hall.

Being more than 70 years old, this eatery sure classifies as one of the heritage eating houses of Kolkata.

Went there with few of my friends and tried a few items.

Fish kabiraji : Served with a papad, the Kabiraji was quite tasty, although a tad too oily. 

The veg chowmein and veg rice was pretty decent.

The chili chicken and veg Manchurian was very average!

Pocket pinch is extremely less.

I had a disappointing experience here.Came here with a friend to try the chicken sweet corn soup and chilli pork.The man serving us said that chilli pork wasn't available.So we had the soup,fish fry and mutton cutlet.Soup was good.But nothing extraordinary to come back for again.
Both the fries were disasters.Ya the price tag next to them is less.. I don't judge them for making the filling entirely with mutton and fish minces.But atleast add some flavours to them! If I were made to taste these fries blindfolded I wouldn't have been able to differentiate them.It was completely tasteless.Only positives about these plate if fries were the papads served alongside them and kasundi which packed a good pungency that awakens your senses.
Not going to come back here again.

We have lots of cafes around Kolkata which has been doing very well from some time. ¬†But there are lot of cafes and old restaurants which are doing extremely well and very well known for very very long time. Just like that this very place at Bhawanipur is serving people for the last 70 Years. A old looking place and the ambiance takes you to 1970s where we use to have the ¬†wooden seats and the interiors have a dancing lady made on the wall. You also have the private sitting area for the couples as well.¬†
Came up here and tried some the Chinese and Mughlai dishes in form of¬†

Fish Kabiraji : Not the best i will say, may be not as good as Mitra Cafe but they make some decent kabiraji. Though i was unhappy with the size.

Veg Fried Rice : It was a simple looking fried rice. Decent taste with nothing so special looks. It could have been much better. Enough for one person only.

Chilli Chicken : It was spicy and tasty. The pieces were decent enough and were juicy and meaty. Good for two.

Veg Noodles : Nice looking veg noodles on the place with good taste was going well with the veg manchurian.

Veg Manchurian : This was the Fulgobhi veg manchurian. I liked the taste.

The overall experience was a mixed one. Its a very old place so can't expect much of them. Still it was a nice evening here.

Sangu fried rice is one of the best in Kolkata... try the schezwan variety for any noodles and rice dishes... the chicken pieces are a little bulky so I might opt for the with bone chicken dishes next time which I will surely order.... they use the chilli beautifully.... it's always advisable to ask them to use a little less oil...

Visited this restro depending on the suggestion of one of my friend. This small indian and Chinese restro is situated near the Purno more opposite the shree krishna sweets shop. From outside it seems to be a ordinary restro so does from inside. It has seats in two forms. Some of them are kept together while they also have cabin type arrangements. 
Now coming to the ambience and interiors, there is nothing special to mention. 
Although the seating area is clean but the kitchen part isn't that clean. 
We had ordered several dishes including parathas, chicken chap, mutton curry, mutton cutlet and moglai paratha. 
Now coming to the details of the dishes-

Paratha- they were good and hot amd crunchy 

Mutton curry- it contains two pieces of mutton along with a egg piece. Which tasted good. 


Chicken chap- it was a fantastic dish having perfect amount of everything 

Mutton cutlet - it was also very nice. What i liked about it that it comes with a piece of fried papad. 

Moglai paratha- i think this was a little let down. All the items were fantastic excluding this. It was little tasteless also the aalo curry they served tasted more like the curry served with kachori rather than the one served along with the moglai. 

Overall food tasted good but the restro may feel a little unhygienic for somebody ...

A lot of emotions dominating me while writing the review for this particular restaurant. I used to visit this particular joint with my dadu (grandfather) during my childhood and hence so many memories associated with everything that they have to offer. I have witnessed a lot of changes for Sanguvalley including all those years when it was closed due to high losses. After so long i was around the Bhowanipur area for some personal work and hence i made it a point to visit this restaurant and try out their Gravy Chowmein which used to be my favourite during my nursery days. Some of the changes i noticed is that they are now particular about the hygeine part as the floors and the tables were cleaned to perfection. The Gravy Chowmein was not like what they used to serve before but still it was very tasty and to my delight they have put ample amount of Chicken and Prawn in the dish. I wish i could have tried some more items but sadly i had my lunch few hours back and was full after the chowmein. 

My request to all the foodies would be keep visiting these vintage outlets as they were the ones who used to serve us when these fancy malls and fine dining eateries were not available. They gave us the opportunity to experience various delicacies which were not cooked in our household and the ones we love dearly. They are struggling to keep their doors open due to competition from the fancy restaurants.

North indian cuisine was above average in taste but Chinese was delicious. I also had a kulfi in the end which was very tasty. Well on an average taste was good. Price was in budget on comparison with the quality and quantity. Must visit place for Chinese and kulfi. Recommended to all.

I have always heard from my parents that if you want to have decent Chinese food at Bhawanipore that too at a reasonable price then you must try out this awesome place! Situated just beside purna cinema hall,its a small cosy restaurant offering delicious Chinese food items. I went on there Christmas Eve with my gang of friends, it was quite crowded, hence we could only order four items - chicken chowmein,mixed chowmein,chicken Manchurian and Cantonese chicken.
Quantity wise sufficient,taste wise it was average but the Cantonese chicken was seriously good.
The staff was really cordial and service was quite fast on a busy day like Christmas.

This is one of the oldest restaurants in the area. I first heard about it from my grandma who used to visit this place at her age with her sister in law after Uttam Kumar movies.
For me, it's the take away joint on the way back from work on no cook Fridays. The place offers good food at a cheap rate. The quantity is fair and enough for me nd my dad. My decor view is related to the cash register but surely this place still has that old world feeling which is refreshing for us Chilis generation.
Overall, value for money place for localites

Sangu Valley is one of the most visited food corners in the vicinity of Asutosh college. I've visited this place plenty of times and liked it very much. The place is gloomy and consists of private cabins. There are main room sitting arrangements too. The arrangements remind of bygone era. 
Speaking about food, they come in good quality and quantity as well. The price is reasonable and friendly to a student's pocket. 
Even though the brighter days of this place have become a part of history, the antiquated food corner stands straight with it's unaltered service towards its visitors. :-)

On Chaturthi midday, a group of five very hungry people (4 guys and me) searching for somewhere to eat and in a major pocket pinch, decided to step in here and eat.
The decor is very, very old but moderately clean, with sitting booths remniscent of a bygone era.
Two of my friends ordered the chicken biryani, and we ordered mixed fried rice and chili chicken.
The servers were old, but did their work very efficiently and were accomodating and kind. They adjusted seating for us when we insisted we'd all eat together. 
Our food came in fast, with water in not-so-clean glasses. Hygiene does seem to be an issue here.
My rice was done well, lots of proteins in it, piping hot and ENORMOUS quantity. 
Chili Chicken had the familiar gloopy gravy, nothing too badly done, but chicken was a bit sparse in those meagre pieces.
The biriyani had lots of starch, egg and meat with potatoes. The rice was mildly fragrant, the spices not too assertive, the meat just on the verge of getting overcooked.
Prices are very, very cheap. Three plates of fried rice, two of Chicken Biryani and one of Chili Chicken costed us just INR 540, no taxes added.
And thankfully, none of us got stomach bugs too!
Puja tips: This place suffices on basics, so do not experiment (no soups, no weird sounding dishes in either cuisine). Stick to the very basic dishes and you'll be satisfied enough, both in terms of price and quantity/quality!

DEATH OF A FRIEND
____________________________________________
I have visited this place countless times. Never experimented with anything else other than the pork/pork & chic. Soup, pork fried rice, chilly/sweet & sour pork. Considering their standard and quantity, they served pork at the CHEAPEST price in all of Kolkata.

Went there today after a long time to satisfy my pork craving with a pocket crunch. Was taken aback by a massive shock as the waiter informed that they have stopped serving pork indefinitely. He gave the reason of the swine flu that hit the city last year. I was heartbroken and compelled to have Chic. Clear soup and mixed gravy chow. They were decent in taste,sufficient in quantity and as usual very economic in price.

Being an ardent fan of the pork (that was)served here i proclaim Sangu Valley dead, for me.

Almost a historical place. Located just beside purna cinema bhawanipore. This place still has the flavour of a very old Kolkata cafe with a very interesting small interior. Fries, cutlets are really good. They also have chinese food which is also really enjoyable. The prices are really reasonable with sufficient quantity.

What more do you want if you get Chilli Pork for Rs.80?
A plate of fried rice is enough for two people. I am in love with the standard Sweet and sour Pork and Chilli Pork. A really cheap restaurant with foods of proper standard and satisfying amount.

One of the oldest restaurant in kolkata, it is located beside purna cinema hall, bhawanipur & can be easily spotted even though it is not so noticeable. The place serves a great number of chinese items & the quality & quantity of food is satisfactory. It is very much pocket friendly & I happen to like the ambiance.

I did not even know this place was still open. It was a decent eatery when I was young, but has deteriorated a lot since. I was very embarrassed when I took my friends there, and we found the food like nothing what I told them.

Went there yesterday with my college friends and have to say that we were totally disappointed.  Waiter who took our orders was impolite and dumb.  Keeping it safe I  ordered noodle soup.  And others ordered chili chicken and paratha.  Noodle soup quantity was disappointing.. A small bowl of tasteless soup and dry noodles and shredded chicken pieces., and few vegetables .. After being disappointed with that noodles I tried out a bit  of paratha which was very oily...  And chili chicken was not that good..  There are lot of restaurants who provide quality food with good prices..Sangu Valley isn't one of them.

In your locality you sometimes look for reasonably priced decent place to hang out with friends and family... This is it. Try mughlai paratha here. Worth it.

Located just beside purna cinema hall in Bhawanipur, "Sangu Valley" is one of the oldest restaurants in the area and nearby vicinity. This restaurant has a shabby decor, sticking to the vintage interiors which reminds you of the bygone era. The floor space is big enough and the sitting arrangements are divided into main room sitting and private cabins. I used to visit this restaurant often as a child. They serve both north Indian and Chinese cuisines. The quantity of their offerings are more than sufficiently abundant and the prices are more than reasonable. Maybe the golden days of this restaurant is a part of history but still it will be a special one for us, who rejoyced the genuine hospitality of this place for ages. The quality and deliciousness of their cuisines served are still unaltered and uncompromised. They still can compete with any restaurant when it comes to quality.

This one's one of the oldest restaurants of kolkata. Heard that it was one of the famous restaurant of early times providing delicious mouth watering foods. But now I didnt find the food tasty enough. I ordered for biriyani and what I got was normal half boiled rice with colors not properly mixed. There was no smell of the biriyani.Rest of the food was of ok type neither bad nor good.
If you have a very tight budget then go for it.

This was our place to visit for treats and birthdays. It is good if you consider the prices and the quantity, they work in tandem! The place is very dimly lit which is a turn off, the curtained cabins are smelly and not well maintained, even though the cabin visit was long back. The staff is old school, gets the job done. Try out the Chinese at this place it is of good quality and is VFM. If you are looking for a romantic date on a low budget, there are better places to go than this one!

With a very tight budget that I used to have during my college days, yet a large appetite, Sangu Valley was one of those places that could fulfill my culinary desire parallely being gentle on my pocket. Super budget restaurant serving old Kolkata style chinese and Indian food. It is not about ambience, not about hospitality. It is about budget and quantity, preserving an average quality.

one of the oldest restaurant in kolkata. Just beside purna cinema in bhawanipore you will find this restaurant. you will definitely not get a awesome interiors but food is great to have. Most important is that it has cabin system still now. So couples go for some extra advantage. 
Must Try:
Moghlai Paratha with kasha mangsho
Dry Chilli Chicken
Mixed Fried rice
Cutlet
and Fish Fry...

Rest of the menu is also good as per individual.

This place was my lunch date for a few weeks, when I was engaged in a project. 

When your stomach honks for food, one choice can save you, yes Biryani, what else could be? So we got a heap of Biryani for our hungry stomach, and we were not expecting more, but you know when you expect least, you get most. So that miracle happened to us. The Biryani was supremely savory and aromatic. The amount was pretty handsome to consume. It was way more than for stomach strength. And one day we stopped by for afternoon snacks, and we had Moghlai, yes we were surprised again. The Mughlai was good, moist and tasty too. 

But about the service I have not experienced any special, but their rude behavior did not win me. They are prompt with their service plate, but hospitality fails me horribly. But as long as it stays, pocket friendly it is good to go.

Sangu Valley offers you no decor, no pretension but a lot to eat. The trick here is to know what to order. They make commendable Mughlai Paranthas that is served with a tasty alur dom strongly flavored with ginger. 
Their Fish Fries, Fish Munias, both Chicken and Fish Kabirajis I love. Once I remember walking down Jagu babur Bajar with this friend of mine, leaving us starved to the core. We hopped in here ordering a plate of Chicken Noodles, 2 plates of chilli chicken,  and 2 fish fries . Service was prompt, real low on budget and extremely filling  quantity they serve. 

However, the fish fries have reduced in size off late, which is quite disappointing for me. The place is clean and you can sit and chat for long without any hassle provided you have something on your table to munch on. You can also try out the Chicken Omlettes and Mutton chops, pretty decent, I tell you!

Situated beside Purna cinema in Bhawanipur,this is a very old restaurant which will give you the feel of dining in Kolkata in the years gone by.The place has a few cabins as well as the normal seating arrangement.There is no air conditioning facility.The ambience is not good to say the least.At present,the interior is dirty and shabby.
Coming to the food,it serves Indian fast food and Chinese dishes.The quality of the food is decent though quite oily.The amount is also good.The very cheap rates of the food is one of the main reasons why people still visit this place.
Quite a decent place in the past,this place like most other places of its kind has had a steady decline.Overall this is a place one can try when you are very hungry and you are really concerned about the pocket pinch.

Sangu Valley is just another name which is there only to talk of bygone eras and famous people who visited it...Once a good name for the fish frys, the kabirajis, and the pakoras...It is a name you will probably hear from your parents, uncles and grandparents. It is next to the long closed down Purna Cinema near bhawanipore...On the main road, close to a few colleges and schools in south it now only caters to the people who are very low on budget and mainly youngsters..I would go here only if I have to little to spend and need something to eat desperately...The only time it is full is during the pujas...The fry's pakoras and stuff have degraded and what remains is just dismantled memories....
I have tried chinese here once the chowmein had so much oil I felt sick literally to finish it...The service is also slow but hats off to the tip by Subhayan Chakroborty but I do not think even if I was in a mood to spend some time with someone I would not go there as the ambiance would destroy it...No ac and fed by a huge stand fan I think it is just "fine" where you only tell yourself "am paying very low so I will take whatever I get" or "I am too hungry to care what I eat".

This small place beside Purna Cinema at Bhawanipore was once famous for its Kabirajis. Now, long past its prime its just a rundown joint with average service, average food quality and no ambience. Try the Kabirajis and cutlets ( if they are available )  and please stick to small meals. The Mughlai is one thing they still do good here, so go for it. The staff are always late and the place is not as clean as one expects. The primary clientale comprises college students from nearby since the prices are still way below what other restaurants charge.

But everything changes if you're a couple and want to enjoy a dining experience in the naughty confines of a cabin *wink* :) . The place has 4 cabins at the back which MAY just make you like this restaurant. Its not sleazy and quite cosy.

Chakraborty Tip : Try to go for the last cabin on the left.

Its an really old restaurant located beside Purna Cinema. Here, the ambience is poor but food quality is tasty but oily. Prices are moderate and i love their Fish Fries and Chicken Tandoori. Quantity is suitable for 3 people apparently. Service is too slow.I mostly take away from there and the rolls are also good. I would rate 3.0 for Sanguvalley.

The only memory with this place is the hot piping Kabiraji's we used to have with family, decades back. The food doesn't contain that taste & quality anymore. The place now welcomes you with its shady ambiance & poor service.

The place is dying day by day, literally. Now, there are no reasons left why a diner should visit this place.

The place is OK to go to during college days when you have almost empty pockets, hungry stomach and oodles of  time to kill.
Not very decked up, doesn't have a good ambiance or great service.The food here is too oily.
If you don't mind the oil, the Mutton Afghani and Kabiraji Cutlets may seem decent enough.
