The eatery provides good food in a pocket friendly budget. Being a local I can attest to the fact that getting good fast food in Baksara area is a real trouble. Anshuprio provides a welcome break. I ordered egg-chicken fried rice, veg fried rice, chilli chicken, schezwan chicken, manchurian chicken to celebrate mother's day and give my mom a holiday from all the cooking stuff! The food was home delivered in correct time with perfect temperature and intact freshness. The quantity supplied in each pack was more than enough to feed a hungry mouth. The food was also very very tasty. I would definitely order from this eatery again and recommend it to my friends and family!

I often visited here by weekend. This place is very near to my home. With a low budget you can easily visit this restaurant. Generally Chinese dishes are popular here. Specially every type of Momo are very delicious from this restro. Chicken Bar_B_Q & Fish Fry are also very popular. High road lovers from Kolkata can check once this restaurant anytime.

The chinese is quite delicious here ,especially the gravy chow and also the bar-b-que chicken. The ambience is a plus point added.

A very good food joint located just before baksarah Jana gate crossing on kona expressway. The things which I used take from here is bar-b-q chicken, chicken drumstick, fish fry, dry chilli chicken, moglai paratha, fried rice, momo etc etc. The quality is very good for each item. I found this joint a total value for money. The must try items over here are: 
Bar-b-q chicken
Fish fry
Chicken drumstick
