My review pertains to my last order today evening comprising of noodles, babycorn and rolls. Despite having mentioned in the order to not add chillies, the food was unbearably hot to consume and had to be disposed off.

I have been ordering regularly from this place for the last few months and never had any reason for any disappointment. Not sure what went wrong with the quality today...

Nice take away counter. Cheap and good Chinese food....


I would say if you want to order Chinese food starter or main course it's a good choice at a rate that even college students can afford
