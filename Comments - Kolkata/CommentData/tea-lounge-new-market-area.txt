Valentine’s Day creates a great opportunity for people to come out in droves. Valentine’s Day is just around the corner and many couples look forward to celebrating the day in each other’s company by wooing each other and showering one another with gifts.Whether you are looking for a quiet evening together or want to let your hair down with so much choices and you may end up spending more than what you had planned for. Being centrally located with easy access to local shopping market and you will have to keep some buffer time. You have many tourist attractions close to the hotel like Victoria memorial, museum, Birla planetarium to make this day even more special for the two of you. This is a very good place to stay in heart of Kolkata if you are coming from outstation.  So this season Peerless Inn is definitely in to host you couples with love !

Winter in this part of the world surely brings in loads of joy for several reasons. Christmas and its celebrations are a part of it, and when we speak about Christmas it can’t go without having some soul pleasing plum cake with our loved ones beating the chill in the air! Cake Mixing ceremonies are held just prior to this festive season at various premises spread across the city which somewhat triggers this season of festivities and joy. And at Peerless Inn also it is believed that cake mixing is the best way to kick off the winter season! Cake mixing involves a good number of participants in the mixing activity since it is believed the more number of people involved in mixing these ingredients; more the abundance of resources will be there in the coming year. Every year at Peerless Inn they have celebrities enjoying the cake mixing, but this year they decided to think a bit different and to invite senior citizens from old age homes and a big group of cheerful school kids. It was really awesome to watch all the elderly people rolling up their sleeves to get involved in this mixing activity.

Ironic!!

First review and the rating is not that great basis my experience.

Coffee ordered from the Tea Lounge. It is a cosy little place near the reception at the lobby. Manned by a single staff the service can be a bit slow.

Mind you, if you are not staying as a guest or even if are one, they can ask you to settle the bill directly and not attach to your room. 

Coffees being brewed are not extraordinaire but expect to have in-house biscuits served with it.

The only time you might feel like having a tea / coffee is incase the checking is taking enormous time.
