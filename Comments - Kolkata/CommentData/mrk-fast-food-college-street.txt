I am a daily customer of this place. I go there almost every evening for Chowmine. And I must say they do prepare a good one at a very cheap rate. The Egg Chicken Chow at Rs.50 is one of the best dish they prepare. And the quantity is enough to be the evening snacks of two people.
They also master in making good Rolls at a cheap rate.
They only provide a bench to their customers to seat. Most of the people go for taking home delivery. But you can of course seat and have your food there. I am staying at College Street for last four years and I must say this is the best place at the cheapest rate for daily going.
And I shall also keep visiting the place till I am here.

Tried their roll once. A small fast food joint near the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The paratha was undercooked and so was the chicken. Never visited here again.

And MRK - another Fast Food Corner in College Street area serving dishes which are sure to please your taste buds. I opted to try out some noodles and something of chicken. The veg noodles - very well prepared, it was really good in taste, and most importantly the noodles were really less oily - for a moment I was wondering if they made it without using any oil. Now, lets come to the Chicken Manchurian. Two words - brilliantly made! So well prepared - undoubtedly lip-smacking. The rich gravy, the chunks of chicken, the flavor of the spices and herbs used were superb! A big Thumbs-up for MRK! Fast food lovers make a visit to this place!

Small Fast Food Joint Near Kolkata Municipal Corporation . Dine-In not available only takeaway . Chicken Roll , Chicken Moghlai , Chicken Lollypop are awesome . The other food items are okayish. In terms of hygiene really bad indeed.

This street side eatery greets on your way to Sealdah from College Street. Its a small place with takeaway option. Its a fast food joint so all i have ever tried there is the rolls and the momos. The roll is good enough and the momos are better than most other similar shops nearby. A value for money shop for fast bites.

Food over here is worth the money.
And I can proudly say this for I live close by.
The chilli chicken they make can give a strong competition to alot out there.
They are fast and fresh hence no stomach issue is supposed to arise.
For all those passersby, spending money at this hub will be worth the pleasure of your taste buds!  
Happy eating! :)

It's a normal roadside fast food center in Central Kolkata. Obviously dine-out is not available. Quality of food is better comparing other fast food centers in the same region. Prices are also reasonable.

Average eating outlet. The rolls are good and the outlet is nice for a person on his way to Sealdah from College Street or back. Service is okay.
