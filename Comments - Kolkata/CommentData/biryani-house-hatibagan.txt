Tried here many a times, since my college days, always got lured by the smell of Biryani! Its tasty and simple. Not too oily and spicy at all. Other side dishes are average. Its dinning arrangement is not so good, I prefer take away mainly.

Biriyani house, as the name suggests prepares a good enough Biriyani. I have tried few chicken side dishes as well, they could be better. But the biriyani is worth having in this price range

May be the place doesn't have a decent dining ,neither a polished interior nor it has a.c , but the biriyani tastes like heaven. But the taste changes sometimes but it's above avarage. I used to have biriyani before the xams started as I believed tht it would gave me a kick start in studying and I loved the taste here so I used to have it from here

Biriyani House is one of the old name in the city serving Mughlai cuisine for quite sometime.
I have never dined in here always took Biriyani was a part of take away. They prepare light , tasty and standard Biriyani everytime I have taken from here. Service is quite fast too.

Name is biryani house and serve very tasty, lite and pure mughlai biryani. They also serve other mughlai cuisines like kabab, chicken, rools etc. They were also very tasty. Just opposite of ChaCha's but still manage to make customers because of good taste and affordable price. I tried their veg roll it was spicy was tastes really good.

This biryani outlet was once very famous, specifically for their tasty flavor some biryani. Sadly, the last time I packed biryani from this place wasn't a good experience. The rice quality is poor, potato sizes are small and meat wasn't up to the mark.

Cheap and best. Been there many times.   The place is neat and clean. The food is really good. Firni is my favourite dessert there. They don't charge additional tax.
