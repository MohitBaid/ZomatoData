Located near colony bazar's medicine mart.It is a takeaway outlet.The kababs of this place are very good.Chicken roll is nice too.Mutton Tikia roll isn't good and biryani is not upto the mark.You can go to this place for kababs mainly.

Got a great joint in this part of Kolkata , grilled  chicken with butter and cream and dry both are delicious and not to forget the pyaare kabaabs with mint sauce , rolls are equally good to those I had in Nizam's .Have been here few times and I would say quality and hygiene and service has improved .
Best part is its really good quality at affordable pocket pinch .üëç

If you want to have mishandled , unclean and unhygenic food this is the place !

Average food , over priced , Dirty surroundings . They cut and prepare everything on the roadside with flies and dust all around . I have seen it as i live next doors .Pls avoid this place.

This place opens and shuts at will.
Not sure if they even have a food license

So it was a sunny day after winter had its last spell on us few days ago and we were pretty hungry and tired roaming in picnic garden area ,so we decided to locate some eating points and after a long hunt we discovered this place called Nawab Sahab after colony bazaar stoppage which is a take away place for BIRYANIS AS WELL AS ROLLS AND MUGHAL SIDE DISHES.

MY ORDER -
1 chicken biryani with salad & raita

MY EXPERIENCE & VERDICT -
As mentioned it's a take away point so not much is there to feel ambiance wise however a decent looking roll counter and biryani handis placed outside is there so as soon as I got my Biryani packaged from this place I went home and had observed the nicely packaged aluminium food pack filled with wholesome rice, aloo and a nice Chicken piece which was delicious from the top till the bottom ,the rice was grainy and nicely cooked with enriched flavour just right , then coming to the aloo it was soft and tasty , not forgetting the main thing which is the chicken piece inside which was big and nicely cooked and soft in every bite I had , well then there was complimentary raita & salad given along with the biryani which was also prepared nice and fresh going good along with the whole meal .
As a result I would definetly like to say that this place really does a great job in those lazy days when u would prefer a take away in and around the area .
Finally to conclude I would like to even add on that I just paid 70 rupees for my food which is a very economical value in today's times .

Favorites are double egg roll and double chicken roll. They used grill chicken in the roll. Service are very fast. In the tandoori item chicken leg solo, leg, breast, Afghani leg & breast, reshmi and tikka  kabab with butter is awesome with freshly made pudhina dip and onion. With kabab and tandori item lachaa paratha is a great option. Must tried. Very reasonable price so highly recommended for everyone.

I suggested this restaurant to Zomato and the resto is on the list within 24 hours! 
Bad things about this shop is that they don't have everything ready to cook like kebabs.
Been here twice.

For the roast menu, you are not leaving this shop until you stand for at least 30mins. The crowd isn't that high.

Generally I take the Rs 60 Leg pc. It tastes delicious both Dry and the dipped ones. They make sure the chicken is well cooked and ask you how you want it. Getting the big piece cut into 4 pieces is compulsory, they won't cook it as a whole as I requested but it was rejected.

Wanted kebabs but they said it would take them an hour more.
Don't buy their rolls, you won't be satisfied with their quantity, its really small as I've seen other customers buying. The dipped pieces with lachcha paratha tastes really good and is worth a try. The 3/5 scored is for the taste, 2 points is lost to slow service,and lack of skill. They could have cooked all the chicken beforehand, and keep them under low heat to keep them fresh. They can serve the full piece on request but they can't cook it that way,most restaurants do! And they are running a tandoor outlet!
