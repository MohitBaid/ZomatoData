First time i visited Aliah hotel, after hearding a lot of about this food joint finally me & my sister wanted to try it out too..., they are famous for their all mughlai dishes. So, we ordered chicken spl biryani,  chicken chaap, and salad. Trust me food is just too awesome  chicken spl biryani is enough for two peoples,  and chaap is great blend of spices. They prepare everything very fresh nicely and soft its so yummy...  Will see you soon Aliah again... Overall awesome experience....

biriyani at rs195  ,served with an egg+ potato+ chicken/ mutton is very very ordinary ...
it's not even average... just fair
the chicken chap is also very ordinary 
the ambience is nice
service is quick.. 
prices are competitive 
menu is small, not much variety

Truely speaking, I was heading for Suruchi that day but the closed shutters of the restaurant somehow sent me to this restaurant. I along with my cousins were more than sad, but our hungry stomach were longing for food. So we decided better something than nothing. We were quite happy with the aroma of biryani coming from the kitchen, while we made oursleves comfortable in the not so stylish ambience. We ordered Chicken Biryani, Naan and Chicken Bharta. When the food arrived we were not that satisfied as the quantity was really less and the prices were hiked. But the food tasted good so we quitely finished up. In a nut shell, this place is an one time visit.

After a long time i visited this restaurant with my brother. We opted for the ground floor. We ordered chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, chicken korma and mutton chap. The order was so quick. The amount of the biriyani was less. But the food was tasty and the meats were so tender. The behaviour of the staffs was also nice.

After hearing about this place a lot visited this place with some of my friends.We took our seats at the ground floor.Decoration is average.We ordered mutton biriyani and chicken bharta.They served instantly.Ahh!!!that biriyani is heavenly I must say.It's true that I have not tasted biriyani much from popular joints.I have had best biriyani here till date.Biriyani had alo but no egg,mutton was so tender.I did'nt figure out when I finished my plate.My heart was wanting more.Chicken bharta was also good,chicken pieces were well cooked.Biriyani was priced at 185 and bharta was 200 and had to pay 5% gst.A must visit!!!

Heard a lot about this place from my childhood. But I never felt the urge to visit here. So a few days back, I went out with my dad when me recommended this place. Since beggars (I had no money that day) can't be choosers so I reluctantly agreed to give this place a try!

Though one of the reputed Biriyani joint of Kolkata but I found the Biriyani served at New Aliyah Hotel quite average and here are few points that I considered while testing the Biriyani there:

Quality of Rice:¬†I found the quality of rice average; it was more of Pulao rice but not typical Biriyani Rice.

Qualityof the meat:¬†Meat was good and the size was moderate however not much juicy and this is applicable to both Mutton and Chicken Biriyani.

Egg was as usual. Hard boiled. The size of the potato taking the maximum place in the plate.

Serving time:¬†This is one of the best things we found there in New Aliah Restaurant; they took really less time to serve the food.

Now coming to the rest of the items. It was a mixed bag. Chicken kasha was a show stealer. Soft like hell and melt in the mouth. Quite unexpectedly good!

Along with Mutton Kosha we took tandoori roti. As tandoori rotis were nothing out of the ordinary, Mutton Kosha was pretty stiff (though I liked the gravy). It required quite an exercise of our teeth (gave my dad a hard time)! :P

Now no Mughlai cuisine is complete without a batch of firni. This sweet wholesome dish is always my favourite and Aliah's one satisfied my tastebuds too!

All in all, an average restaurant which is quite hyped and has almost reached a legendary status! But trust me, there's nothing legendary about it! Though you can give it a try if you happen to be in New Market area.

I have been to this place almost more than 50 times. Have tried out arsalan and aminia also but dont know why this place gives me a separate feeling and charm. One of the best kolkata awadhi style biriyanis with less oil,sumptuous meat piece that literally melts away in ur mouth ,fantabulous aroma, mild flavour enough to take ur conscious mind to the traditional royal kitchens of the lucknowi nawabs¬† and perfect blend of spices is what u can get here. Apart from that their mutton chanp(my god just too good),qorma and keema are too good.¬† If someone asks me where he can have a good mughlai dinner, i would just blindly suggest this place for them any day . Sufficient quantity enough to satiate ur hunger, nice quality and good quick service with decent ambience. Aliah is truly a gem of kolkata. But all the above things which i mentioned here are for their mutton dishes only. i have seen people trying out their chicken dishes also but cant comment on that as i myself never tasted that. Had their chicken kababs and chicken chanp once or twice though and it was fantastic too. No complaints. In my opinion it stands at par with aminia and arsalan if not better

Visited this place for twice many ago though.Located in the prime area of Esplanade just beside the Paradise Cinema.
Restaurant has a decent interior and comfortable seating arrangement.
Service is promt.
Tried their reshmi kababs & biryani.
Kabab was decent enough but nothing special to mention.
Biryani was less spicey & good.
You can give it a try..

Had tried out this restaurant with a colleague of mine. We had ordered the chicken bharta and butter naan. Both tasted really good. The bharta was not very oily and had the right amount of spices. The naan was fluffy and soft. The overall ambience is nothing great, but if you are in the area and want mughlai food, this should be your go to restaurant.

Located just near the bentick street and income tax building crossing near esplanade, this place is a gem!  Situated just near the busy office area, I went there to fulfill a quick biriyani craving, and the craving was fulfilled by them nicely! Only tasted the chicken special biriyani, the quantity was good, and the taste was different than other places, but in a good way, it wasnt much oily and had a unique light taste. The service is quick, waiters were courteous and overall nice ambience and decor. Must visit if tou are in the place and looking for some mughlai dish. Also the murgh musallam is famous over here.

Aliah is not a restaurant for me but a part of life. My father's workplace was in the vicinity and I've been eating there forever. It was the first place I tasted Biriyani at and that love story still continues. 
Some of the staff have been there for a long time and are very courteous and knowledgeable about the food they are serving. The location is great and so is the ambience on the ground floor. But if you're looking for an air conditioner and a little more comfort, try the first floor seating area.
The food obviously is one of the best in Kolkata and according to me it makes the bestest biriyani and the taste hasn't changed over the years I've been coming here. Try it with the mutton stew, that's another dish to die for.

Went in to try their biryani but unfortunately was a bit  disappointed. Ordered a chicken biryani and a reshmi kebab. Coming to their biryani, it seriously lacked moisture and due to it's dryness it was difficult for the platter. In terms of flavour it was decent but not very good. As per me, their biryani is below par when compared to the other well known biryani places in Kolkata. The reshmi kebab was decent in taste and about average. Fortunately it wasn't dry and was tasty enough.

Located beside Paradise Cinema hall in bentinck street this one is an old mughal cuisine restaurants in the City of Joy. The best part of their biriyani is, it is so less oily and the quantity is also enough for a hungry stomach. Visited couple of times, the only drawback i found is the piece of mutton, which was not soft enough. The ambience is really good and the service was top notch.

New Aliah Hotel & Caterer is located in Bentinck Street just beside the outlet of Kanha. The restaurant consists of two parts, the part in 1st floor being the AC one and the part in ground floor being the Non-AC one. The ground floor remains quite populated and busy. We had Chicken Biriyani and Mutton Stew as they were suggested by most fellow Zomato reviewers. Both the biriyani and stew were good and tasty, however the quantity was much less in comparison to the price charged. Also, I felt the Zomato average cost of 400 for 2 may suffice for those having their food in the ground floor but it would not suffice if you wish to have it in the AC section as GST would be added to the total price. Everything considered, we left the place with mixed emotions.

Terrible service and food. Being a tourist in Kolkata and experiencing this place was a disaster. Made me think very low of bengalis. The raita was full of green chillies and sugar. It was a explosion of spice and sweet if thats possible. You really have to control yourself not to puke the same instant after a spoonful. We also ordered a chicken biryani, which was only rice. There was a small chicken piece somewhere buried in the mountain of rice. Needleaa to say it was tasteless. All the spices were used in the raita. Last we ordered a mutton korma boping to add some flavour to the biryani. This was the worst mistake. Uncooked and unsalted. Made us feel like zoo animals.

We all get tired after those long hours of shopping and needs  some lip smacking food to satisfy our hunger isn't??? So when you r heading for your shopping in the New Market area look out for New Aliah Hotel located in Dharmatala. Their speciality is definitely the Biriyani but tandoori clroti and mutton chap is no less. So if you r someone who likes to experiment with food then you can try this out or any other menu from the list. And along with that the firni is a must. The firni is so delicious that it will melt your heart. 
The average cost for two is 500

The dharmatala , esplanade , new market area used to be the ultimate biryani destination some years ago . This locality used to produce the best biryani ages before the big guns like Arsalan and Aminia spread their wings . Biryani from dharmatala is not only just a dish but a piece of nostalgia for me . It's the biryani that i had when I was a child and have not yet forgotten the taste , the aroma of it . The biryani here is a lot less richer than the park circus outlets or any other outlets available in some different part of the city . But gradually , the biryani from dharmatala has lost its consistency . The rice has become more bland , some not served hot enough and therefore a bigger percentage of  people are more inclined to visit the park circus area for a decent plate of Biryani .

New Aliah is one of the very few outlets that are said to still maintain the old standards . The first time I tried the aliah biryani was way back in 2008 . We were a large group of friends who had just watched " The Dark Knight " and we were looking to taste some fine mughlai delicacy . We choose aliah that day and the biryani simply bowled us over. That day is still very close to.me because of the movie , the company and especially the fine quality dharmatala biryani . 

Fast forward to 2017 , and once again i was part of a group although this time a bit smaller . We were 3 friends who after visiting the Indian Museum decided to go to Aliah for Biryani . This time though i was a little apprehensive because i have tried almost all the restaurants in dharmatala in the recent times and very few of them could serve the biryani that will recreate that old nostalgia in me . So with a curious appetite and a hungry tummy we walked in .


¬∞ Location :-  This legendary joint is located in Bentinck street at Esplanade . You must reach the kc das sweet shop which is at the heart of esplanade . Then you have to follow that side of the road that goes towards Chandni .You just have to walk past the Paradise cinema Hall on your left and thereafter you will come across aliah hotel .

¬∞ Ambience & Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- So the famed restaurant has 2 floors ..The ground floor is a non AC section for those preferring and the upper floor has an AC part where you will mostly go for a dining session . We tried the AC section and it was hospitable and good enough for a casual dine . The cutlery was okayish and nothing much to talk about the decor . The service though was top notch . Food was served within 7 minutes which was simply remarkable .


¬∞ FOOD :- Many people say that Aliah still delivers one of the best biryani of our city and their dish is very close to the vintage dharmatala biryani that I was talking about . So, I had a lot of expectations from their plate of Biryani . And this is what I have to say :- 

1. Mutton Biryani ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Oh I wish I could give it the perfect rating but alas , they blew it up in the most important part , the piece of mutton . Everything else was just perfect . Whether the rice which has the right quantity , served stealing hot with the almost perfect aroma. The potato was cooked perfectly soaking up all the flavors . One could just have the potato separately as a dish since it was so flavorful . But the piece of mutton was a disaster . There was not a enough meat in it and more importantly it was not tender by any means . Had a hard time breaking the meat with the knife and that was something that really turned me off . So , the biryani from Aliah almost came close to being a classic Kolkata biryani . My suggestion would be to ask them to ensure that the mutton piece is solid and tender while ordering the Biryani . Or maybe go for the mutton special biryani which I will try next time . But still all my good memories are associated to the single plate of normal mutton Biryani which used to be perfect many years ago .


2. Raita ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Yes I did order a raita separately and i was so happy that i did . It was the best raita that I have ever had . The raita was an explosion of curd and unlike other ones it's not completely sour . It was a little sweetened to which was perfect for my liking . The raita enhanced the biryani experience to a whole new level , each time cancelling out it's taste . So the next time you have a spoon of biryani after raita , it's like having your Biryani again for the first time . I loved that . Very highly recommended from my side .


3. Murgh Musallam ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- A famed dish from this restaurant and rightly so . Normally in other restaurants this dish is costlier and will take a lot of time to serve . But remarkaby they take only a little less than 10 minutes . The price is cheaper probably because they use smaller chicken . But the dish is a classic . The masala is rich but not to the point that you will feel really heavy . Absolutely perfect to go with your biryani and a must have from here . Don't miss out on the musallam .


¬∞ VERDICT:- This is a legendary restaurant serving age old mughlai cuisine for years and it is hard to not speak about them . I believe if you are still nostalgic about the dharmatala , then the aliah biryani is going to give you back some memories . If only they can get the mutton right it will fully be a classic . A very good place for your mughlai cravings and certainly a legend .

One of the best place in Kolkata for mughlai lovers.
Cost is not very much as per the quality of the food. Staff behaviour is also decent.

Apart from their Biriani, one must try the Murg Masallam which is their speciality.

Highly recommended. Pay a visit. Your money will not be wasted. The foods actually worth it.

Definitely the best mughlai food we've had in Kolkata. We had ordered a portion of Chicken Reshmi Kabab, 2 portions of Chicken Chaap, 2 Butter nans, 1 Rumali Roti, 1 mutton biryani, 1 chicken biryani and 3 portions of Firni to end our meal.
The Reshmi Kabab was good, but a bit stiff.
Apart from that, the other items were simply superb. The nan was the softest we've had in the city, the chicken chaap was perfectly prepared and it was a treat to feast on the gravy with the nan and the rumali. And what to say about the biryani!!! The so called biryani giants like Arsalan, Zeeshan, Sheeraz don't even come within a mile in comparison. I can assure you that if you have the biryani here, you would definitely stop going to the aforementioned biryani joints.
A definite recommendation to all my foodie friends.

After totally drenched in rain we were searching for a restaurant which is famous for biryani. So we decided to try Aliah this time. The ambiance of the restaurant is superb. We ordered special chicken biryani, chicken chaap, rumali roti and firni... The taste was good but there was nothing special or unique which we expected out of all the dishes.. I personally dint like the Firni because of the taste of jaggery in it... Even I felt the gravy in the chicken kassa was very less... Though overall the service was good and we had a tummy full lunch .

And for a suggestion change your average cost for 2 people ... As it can never be just 400 for two.

Worst food,horrible biriyani and more worst side dishes. We were 8 of Family members and really unfortunate that by mistake visited this hotel yesterday night. Food is pathetic,  biriyani they are charging Rs 226 and rice quality is below a 70Rs local Hazi type biriyani outlets. Side dishes like we took Rogan Juice, Mutton Keema,Mutton chap -all so taste less and served in very very small quantity and that also with such a nasty way. Total waste of money and our dinner. Avoid this 3rd grade pathetic place.

Overpriced and overhyped! I placed a take away order for 5mutton biryani and 3 chicken chap. 
The biryani was so mediocre in taste and worst of it all were the mutton pieces which were pretty small. The chap was also not worth it. Overall heavily disappointed!

Well today went with my friends ordered one mutton biriyani and two firnis..
1.The biriyani was good nothing extraordinary
2.The firni tasted somewhat like a bengali sondesh..it tasted very different from other places firni..very sweet but liked it..
The service was very very fast within 1 min they served us..
Behaviour of staff was average not good..
This place is a little overpriced though there is nothing much extraordinary about it..

Ah! This place :). 
This is one of the oldest and best mughlai restaurants in Kolkata. This is the restaurant where I first ate Biriyani and since then the taste is same. 
They have maintained the taste of their dishes. 
Biriyani, chap, rezala and firni is a must try here.

If there are still some old restaurants are left in the town that are still in heart of a Biriyani lover, then New Aliah is one of the popular name on that list. Been there few days ago with my foodie friend Oishik, who told me about this restaurant for many times. So lets come and explore this place.

Positive Point ‚Äì

1.	Location ‚Äì Situated at the Bentick St, near to Paradise Cinema Hall. So not a hard thing to find it.

2.	Food ‚Äì A restaurant is defined by the food it served and Aliah didn‚Äôt left any point about questioning about their food. Murg Masallam is their most hit item there, so don‚Äôt forget to try it when you come to this restaurant.

3.	Service & management ‚Äì Stuffs are really helpful, well-mannered and guide you the proper dish, acc. to your tastes. Serving time is pretty fast.

Negative Point ‚Äì

Didn‚Äôt find any negative point except the variation of food. Though Aliah is proper Mughlai Cuisine restaurant, still I think they should introduced more item(My personal thought, so can ignore it).

We ordered ‚Äì 

1.	Mutton Special Biriyani ‚Äì After some discussing with the stuffs, what to take between Roti or Biriyani, we ordered this one. Two pieces big mutton pieces were there with two pieces of Aloo and one boiled egg. The rice was perfectly cooked with nice amount of spices. Not much oily in nature but tastes really good. Quantity wise it is okey for one person only. Overall good.

2.	Murg Masallam ‚Äì This is something for which Aliah is really famous for. Probably the only restaurant in the town, that serves a full Murg Masallam in just 10 minutes when the other restaurant takes at least 1-1.5hrs to serve it. A full sized chicken served with lip smacking gravy and one boiled egg. It was cooked in Dalda but tastewise it was too awesome. So forget about the health consciousness and I recommended it to all.

With two food mentioned above it cost only 750 INR, which is very decent pricing. They don‚Äôt add any kinda VAT or service taxes, which is really a blessing for nowadays. So in conclusion, I will say New Aliah is one of the great budget restaurant, which can fill your Biriyani craving anytime. So come to this restaurant and don‚Äôt forget to order the Murg Masallam. Overall a good dining experiences.

Being located at Esplanade it is a crowd puller restaurant. I had tried their delicacies several times as my office is located nearby. The paratha is little bit sweet which actually increases the power of taste buds and one paratha is big enough for a person. Mutton chap is good but I generally appreciate items with more gravy. Mutton biryani is very tasty and the kebabs too. The firni is simply lip smacking. I want to have it more and more. The price are not very high. Ambience is also good.

I am having biriyani here since childhood. Needless to say the biriyani is best here. Its an authentic place and uses the best of quality. Amazing staff. Mutton biriyani is amazing . It melts in mouth. The mutton chaap is delicious. Best chaap I ever had. The firni is also amazing. It's ideal for a family dine out. Needless to say highly recommended and will come always.

Not really for fancy food but if your interested in getting delivered economical food at your doorstep - it's one of those places.

Personally, i have had food delivered from here.

Food is good. Well cooked. Not too spicy. Good old North Indian cuisine. Biriyani and the kebabs are my usual pick.

This restaurant was one of my most favourite since childhood. Their mutton strew, tandoori chicken and biriyani used to be outstanding. I used to proudly refer my friends, relatives and who ever visited Kolkata, to visit this restaurant.
But day by day there are degradation in their quality, quantity and hospitality. The excessive arrogance of their staffs is ruining their reputation.
When the last time we visited there the food was not so good and surprisingly we were asked to leave immediately right after we finished our food though there were no other customer in the resturant. It was very much unexpected.
Still the firni is the rockstar. But I fear in future I won't be able to say that as well.
Such a regret.

The quality of food is almost same as Aminia. He ambience inside the restuarant is very good because the place have cabins covered by curtains in which besides eating guys can maintain privacy and it's best for the couples. Besides biryani and kebebs the murg musallam is excellent.

I was there on 9th may, ordered as starter Chicken Tandoori.. much better,then mutton Biriyani,Chiken Rezala,Butter Nun.. Biriyani was so delicious. But Chicken rezala could have been much better.. amount of sugar is more than other restaurant i went and gravy was light and so watery.. allthough the atmosphere was brilliant. Like Mughal Castle.

When you want to have a simple Tandoori Roti and and good quality goat meat you can go there. The idea is to go there and have the items there only when it is served hot the food is really yummy and and the mutton item is really nice. Ambience is not that good it's looks like a normal hotel

I was surprised that no onions and lemons were served with biryani and when requested was told that this is how we serve it. Of course, the manager was kind enough to intervene

After attending a brainstorming meeting our boss took me and three of my colleagues for  lunch..
Heard a lot about the biriyani of this restaurant we thought of giving it a try.
Its was 4 p.m and we were dead hungry so instead of ordering starters we straight away ordered main course
We ordered Mutton Special Biriyani and a Chicken Special Biriyani and chicken tikka masala as a side.
After few minutes our order arrived and we were quite surprised by the quantity ...It was huge...
Our mutton biriyani had 2 big peices of mutton 2 peices of aloo and and an egg
The chicken biriyani dat was shared by my colleagues had 2 big peices of chicken ..2 peices of aloo and an egg.
The chicken tikka was propeely cooked.. perfect.. and chicken peices were tender soft...
Overall experience was quite good...

New Aliah is situated beside the Paradise Cinema, and Income Tax building at Dharmatalla. They specialize in traditional Mughlai cuisine, with a limited menu, that comprises mostly of Biryani, Naan, Paratha, Rezala, Chanp, etc.
The interiors are shabby and they don't really care about decoration and show-off. The waiters are really courteous, and food is tasty and classy, comes with a minimum pocket pinch!
I tried:
‚óΩMurgh Musallam (1 whole chicken cooked in an awesome gravy, cut into 4 pieces and 1 egg, probably the only restaurant to serve this dish instantly, without prior notice)
‚óΩButter Naan (really soft)
Overall, it felt great, and I will revisit.

A Romantic Afternoon. Me and Biriyani and our Endless Love. 
So today after receiving some huge recommendations visited this place and scratched it off from my "would be visiting" list. Ordered 2 plate Chicken Biriyani (for me and my buddy.. Obviously wont be having 2 plates alone) with Chicken Rezala. Within 2mins it was served, and My Gawd it was so yummy. So light and not huge on spices, appropriate salt and pepper. With a price of rs180 per plate, the amount of the biriyani was huge (another reason I love the North and Central Kolkata). After completing the main course, we jumped for the dessert - Firni, honestly one of the best Firni's I've ever had. 
Decorum is normal like any other North Kolkata restaurants and Kakus who are serving or taking orders are too polite and friendly. 
This place is hugely recommended for Biriyani lovers.

Well this a place that serves you the best biriyani in town. The biriyani simply melts in your mouth and the aroma is excellent. The other side dishes like rezala and chaap are equally good. The ambience is pretty decent if you choose to go inside the AC restaurant. I give 5 stars to this place.

Foods descent and pretty well made. Tandoori roti here is one of the best. Items to go for would be mutton rezala. Chicken liver. Chicken chap and murk musslam. If you tip the waiter well even after ST you made get a better piece of meat in the biriyani. It's like a crime if you don't tip though. Overall good food ok ambience fast service and poor waiters

I Opted for the delivery option. The food came in a jiffy. Much to my delight the food was warm. I ordered for a mutton biryani and chicken chaap. The biryani was one of the best what i have had over the years in kolkata. The mutton piece was tender and succulent with the potato being soft. The rice had the aroma of all the distinct ingedients put in. The Chicken chaanp was very delicious too. The food here satisfied my hunger pangs!! 
Must try restaurant for all! Keep it up team ALIAH.üëå

Was looking to have lunch with 3 of my friends

Decided to go for Aliah as we are in Dalhousee & I love this 86yrs old establishment for the awesome awadhi food they serve..

Decided we will not order Biriyani this time.we
Ordered 1 Chicken Varta, wondering what eles to order with roti,finally randomly ordered Mutton Chanp
And 6 rotis

Chicken varta was OK...
But the moment I taste the Chap it was like burst of flavours in my mouth.. Mutton was perfectly cooked, tender, perfectly flavoured and that awesome grave leaves u crave for more.As a result I end up ordering another one... But it worth every penny.

Take my words guys I have tasted Mutton Chap of many Restuarent but Aliah's chap was THE BEST.
and the best part is pocket friendly.(not comparing with Royal's mutton chap)

So Guys if you visit Aliah, dishes u must try
1.Mutton Chap
2.Murg Mussalam
3.Biriyani

Located near the paradise cinema this place serves one of the best biryani.  Its delicious and mouth watering.  We ordered chicken biryani chicken, reshmi kebab, salad and cold drinks.  One best thing about this place is cold drinks are reasonably priced. Most places charge three times the market price. But this place charges reasonable . Very happy and satisfied.  Coat for 2 will cost 500 around and you wont be disappointed with it. üëç

After seeing the reviews in zomato,went to try the biryani of this place.Believe me or not it was quite mediocre.Nothing special.What disappointed me the most is the quality of the food.The biryani was drenched in dalda which no other restaurant of this repute uses these days.Also the quality of the rice was not at all up to the mark,unlike Arsalan and Alibaba.The thing which earned this place a review of 2.5/5, is the chicken rezala and plain naan,which were much better than the biryani.Also the Murgh Musallam,which is mentioned under the 'special' category,tasted like plain chicken chap stuffed with dalda and an egg.It simply misfits a price tag of Rs 420.Overall a one time visit-eligible place.

Location: 3 mins walking from Paradise cinema hall towards bentick street.This place serves mouth watering Biriyani which is never too rich nor too greasy and the quantity is decent enough. The chicken and mutton side dishes are good enough.Perhaps they prepare one of the best halims in the city. Firni is also worth trying.

I went for a quick lunch with my dad. We ordered 1 chicken kasha, 3 naan and a paneer butter masala. The non veg item was fab but the veg item was not up to the mark. The total bill was ‚Çπ420. So it's an affordable, good place to have a quick lunch.

I have to say I was impressed with the food quality and service. I ordered some butter naans along with chicken reshmi Kebab. The quality was really good. The naan was soft, and definitely well made. The reshmi Kebab was also pretty well made, tasted very good. The service was also commendable, keep up the good work.

Started visiting the place on the recommendation of a friend and surely people working in and around Esplanade,Chandni or even Dalhousie area can't give it a miss. This place serves mouth watering Biriyani which is never too rich nor too greasy and the quantity is decent enough. The chicken and mutton side dishes are good enough. The succulent pieces of Chicken Tandoori are sure to impress any gourmand. Keeping all these items in mind, the show stealer is the Halim that they prepare specially during the Ramzan. Perhaps they prepare one of the best halims in the city. The well cooked, juicy delicacy when taken hot with roti will surely give an utmost satisfaction to your taste buds. This place has an A.C section at the 1st floor, recommended for dining in during the summers. 
Overall a big thumbs up to this legendary place..

i have been craving for the Aliah biriyani and stew for long.... guess i last ate there about 10 yrs ago... but could get enough time to visit the place until today.... and the starved soul since morning in quest of adhaar card was dissapointed..... ordered mutton biriyani and tandoori chicken..... wat came was an extremely dry,  flat biriyani with an equally poor piece of meat..... the tandoori chicken though was better in comparison was still dry.... the best part was the complimentary pudina chatni and salad.... i will definitely visit again though for the tempting stew and tandoori roti.... hopefully it will not take another 10yrs....

Aliah is the one of best place to go in Esplanade area. Situated at Bentinck, near Paradise cinema hall. Not heavy at pockets but really good at dishes and service. Aliah is close to my office so I visit the Restaurant frequently. Not only good for chicken preparations but also for mutton preparations. the menu is really hot and yummy! "¬†No one can eat just once"!¬†Chicken biryani is really the mouthwatering one. chicken chap, chicken bharta chicken razala are also on the top of the list of the tastier items. One can also enjoy the mutton razala and mutton biryani which has really made people surely visit the place twice. Now, it is quite clear that the food is at its best. But don't worry for the price. They pay an equally respect to your pockets. The rates are reasonable and no compromise with the quality. Please don't think¬†that the quality is cheap.¬†The most interesting thing is that, even when the Restaurant is full, you will get a fast service. You get your plate ready infront of you within 5 minutes after you place the order. Everytime you eat, you have it hot. The best thing is that they behave really well with their customers. My request is to visit Aliah once and I promise you will surely have a good time having your favourite dish.

It was Pujo, Saptami, out with mom and dad and he suggested that we try this place for lunch since he always rated it high.

Location: 3 mins walking from Paradise cinema hall towards bentick street.

Stepped in.....felt like those classic good old mughlai restaurant, some of which we see in bollywood movies. Elegant maroon sofas and marble top tables, wow....the affair was just starting.....

Ordered chicken rezala, mutton chaap, parath and chicken and mutton biryani.....

Parathas were soft and melting, biryani was one of its kind, great taste, perfect texture, not too oily not too spicy.

Mutton chaap was terrific as per my dad and the chicken rezala was bang on!

This place serves fast and that too with the help of courteous staff.

Clean too!

Must try for all the Mughlai or biryani lovers.

Only glitch might be the parking!

I have been to the restaurant once and tasted mutton biryani and chicken chaap.The chaap wasnt something extraordinary but the biryani was quite a revelation. The Biryani was light and probably the lightest I had in Kolkata. The flavour was really good and flavour of cinnamon,cloves and nutmeg were quite prominent. Tasted little different from normal biryanis available in the city but its surely worth a try

The place is great when it comes to biriyani and other chicken and mutton dishes. It is at a location which is easily accessible from chandni or esplanade metro. The rotis and breads need some improvement, according to me. Some of the staff are extremly rude.  Nobody likes rude behaviour with delicious food.

This joint is very near to my office and had been visiting there for past decade. In fact I think i like their the most in whole of Kolkata. Light yet rich on taste. They have an AC section as well on the first floor.

located at the heart of kolkata cbd,central business district,on bentinck street,near esplanade,this is one of famed mughlai restaurant in the metro but not among big five ¬†of royal,saabirs,aarsalan,aminia and shiraz.still there are many aliah fans including me.one fact has to be remembered,if you want exclusive class ambience,you have to move to five star in house restaurants of big hotels like the lalit great eastern nearby on waterloo street.be prepared to face a lot of chaos and distractions while eating.but if food is your priority and you know the cacophony of the city,you wont dislike the place.food is above average and gives you the experience of kolkata style mughlai dishes,different from lucknow,hyderabad and delhi.you get all the standard items,chicken,mutton and egg biryani,haleem,rezala,korma,paratha and the like.if you are a mughlai addict like me,you cant resist visiting the place as i do,every time i am in the city.

DID NOT like the biryani here, nothing about it was good, specially the mutton. Firstly there was very little meat in the piece I got and whatever meat was there it just didn't taste good. I previously only had Haleem from here and had really liked it but this biryani experience has left me with a bitter memory of this place.

They serve the worst biryani. Extremely over priced as compared to some famous restaurants. The quality of rice and mutton was very bad, especially the piece of mutton, it was all bone no meat. I think they only serve bones in the name of mutton. Had a worst experience eating over there.

Nice ambience & location. Food was also fair. Specious & very quick delivery is it's USP. We had Mutton Biriyani & Mutton Quorma there. Just a small feed-back, piece of Mutton was pretty small & was not juicy enough, a bit of dry. For Quorma also this feed-back goes same. As per price it deserves a bigger piece.

The place has become historical in all terms. The age and taste.
Suggested by my friend I went there with him.
We ordered for a Mutton Biryani and Chicken Kassa to accompany with.
The 'historical' term comes into play now as I don't find anything exceptional which food lovers used to recommend back-in-the-days. Although it was good. The ambience is pleasing & takes you back to the 'historical' timeline with uniform in whites. The furniture and everything else in the environment is lovable.
Price is right for the pocket. Worth trying.

Most people would go gaga for their biryani. Yes, it is an excellent biryani indeed. But the best part happens to be the firni. Just beyond comparison. This is best firni I ever had. Simple, sober and quality-concious would be the words to describe this place.

The restaurant is located at the heart of town but it charges for AC in extra. Also entering at the closing time, the waiters were reluctant with the gates closed behind us as we left. 
The food was good. In starters we had Chicken Reshmi Kabab and Chicken Tikka Kabab. The Tikka being particularly delicious. In main course we had Chicken Biryani and in side-dish we had Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. The Biryani was particularly fine and the overall experience was good, with the ambience on the lines of Nawabs.

Located near Paradise cinema, this is a typical Mughlai restaurant serving finger licking Biriyani. They have got two floors, one AC and the other is non-AC. Sides like kebab items, mutton korma, chanp etc. are equally tasty. Recommended for those who're just craving for tasty Biriyani. In dessert, Firni is also worth trying. Most importantly, they don't put Meetha attar in Biriyani.

Aliah needs no introduction ...its an institution in itself..still remember when as a kid, we used to stay right across and I must have had innumerable meals here...The most amazing thing of this place is the consistency that they have maintained over the years...My   first proper meal here must have been about 35 years back...and have been visiting this place over the years...The food quality and taste remains the same same...uber good...Their chicken chaanp is to die for...and their firni is the best you get in town...another surprising aspect is that some vegetarian friends I know have even recommended their veg fare...specially their paneer butter masala...
If you haven't as yet, go treat yourself to a fantastic meal at Aliah..and I bet you won't regret..

Just walk for 3 minutes from Paradise Cinema hall and you will find this place.We went there for a quick lunch and ordered Tandoori Chicken and Special Mutton Biryani. They have AC and non-AC seating arrangement. We went for the AC section. Food was served quickly as the service was fast. Chicken tandoori was soft, juicy and perfectly grilled. But, the Biryani was dry and the Mutton pieces were needed to be cooked more. Overall it was a decent experience.........

Biryani is the best part of this restaurant. Their Biryani is too good. Rice is soft, not much oil and tastes fine and it also comes in good quantity. Also tried their Chicken Rizala which was also good. Prices are bit costly, Biryani for Rs.170 seems a big price. Still the quality is fine so, the price doesn't bother much.

A legendary restaurant, when it comes to Biryani. Remember picking some packets while returning from Digha to have for dinner. The rice was soft and succulent. The mutton portions simply melted in the mouth. The potato just elevated us to another level of foodgasm. Hoping to drop in sometime to try the other delicacies.

There are two options. If you wanna save some money and have no problem eating in a chaotic place, go to the ground floor. Otherwise go upstairs. Upstairs the ambiance is really good with a feel of the Mughals.
So what do you do in a Mughal restaurant?
Well, you order biriyani without peeping into the menu. They cook one of the finest less oily biriyani in the city. And the tandoori items are also fabulous. Parathas are good too.
Price is more or less reasonable.

I don't know why they stopped serving mutton biriyani. So unexpected.

I came here for lunch during a coaching class with another classmate.We sat in the air-conditioned area upstairs which had a classy decor.The servers were helpful and well mannered.They suggested us the mutton qorma in gravy dish to go alongside the breads we ordered namely butter naan and kulcha naan.These combination tasted very good.The naan was soft and buttery.Kulcha naan was the best of the lot.It was stuffed with minced paneer,chilli and few other spices.It was so good that I had much of it on its own.It went well with the mild mutton gravy which had 2 pieces of soft mutton falling off the bone with a aloo and a boiled egg.It started well first.Food was served fast and our glasses were filled with water when it was empty.Servers even welcomed criticism regarding the food.So no complaints about the service.

We also decided to share a special biriyani since new aliah hotel & caterer's biriyani has been featured as one of the best in Kolkata in many places.It also had a boiled egg and aloo along with 2 soft mutton pieces.But it stops there only.Biriyani was the worst I ever had.The rice was red in appearance(don't know why)..just too much overpowered with spices and keorar jol.This was the first time I wasted a plate of biriyani..I usually complete even okayish biriyani but this was just too bad.We each just had few spoonful and that was it.Almost the entire thing was wasted.I didn't even have the appetite for dessert.Hence we skipped the firni and walked out off the place paying the bill.

Not worth repeating since there are much better restaurants serving Mughlai cuisine in that area.

Went to their Outlet yesterday after 11 long years..Since it is one of the oldest outlet.. I always had a target to check out their special items.. It has a Non AC Dinein Hall and also an AC Dinein Hall.. Ordered Mutton Biryani and their Famous Mutton Stew with Salad and Firni as the Side Dish.. The Biryani tasted Amazing and Awesome.. Just perfectly cooked and the Mutton was very tender and good quality.. Aloo even was fantastic.. What disappointed me was the Stew.. I though that it's their Famous Food from them and so thought of giving a taste hoping to be different apart from Chaaps and Rezalas.. The Mutton needed to be much more tender and the gravy was not welcomed by me due to extreme oil and spices. !! Though the Biryani was Awesome but still expect their rest of the Menu items which are famous will be good.. Staffs were quite oversmart and impatient though the Cashier was good..!! Overall it's quite good to have a visit out there and check out yourselves..!!

One of our favourite places for Biryani. The 1st floor AC section is more comfortable and have¬† a better menu. Like the oil free special paratha is not available downstairs. I like the chaanp too. The kebabs are decent. During Ramzan they serve one of the best mutton haleem in Calcutta, except for Thursdays when they make Chicken Haleem.

Ordered chicken biryani, Reshmi kebab, chicken bharta. Tandoori roti, laccha paratha, chicken rezala and salad. This time also I liked all foods, though influence of vat and service tax may reduce couple of more customers they actually deserve.

Terrible biriyani, equally worse kheema. Only the firni was the inly saving grace. 
Waiters thought that the 6% service charge being levied is taken by the govt. as per what management told them, so apart from terrible food, the management seems to be peddling lies to its own staff as well. 

Visit only if seats are unavailable everywhere else within a 10km radius.

Hearing a friend rave about the mutton kasa of this place, I decided to give it a try. It is a very popular restaurant in the Chandni Chowk Area. I was taken aback to know just 8 years back, the mutton kasa used to cost just 75 bucks and now it costs 152!! (The menu given here in the website is not updated). Now, let's talk about the place. Its just a few minutes walk from the chandni metro. The place is huge and if you can manage to go before 2pm, you will find lots of space to make yourself comfortable. The food arrived within minutes of ordering. We ordered a plate of mutton kasa and two tandoori roti. The roti was just marvellous in size as well as taste. Now, lets get to the kasa. To me, it looked overpriced. There was just four niether tiny nor medium pieces of mutton with loads of gravy and even more oil. But it made up with its awesome taste. Now! I can't stop raving either. Give them a try. I am sure you will love it.

The service is really quick even on Christmas. The food was amazing. The kebab was just mouth watering. They even give an egg in the biryani which is like a bonus!
Anyway it's a fantastic restaurant with delicious food and beautiful ambience.

Please visit this place to get the taste of great mughlai cuisine. I just love the taste of biriyani here. The balance of flavor and fragrance is an intrinsic part of the food served here. It has been more than 20 years I am visiting this place. Their Mutton Stew is a specialty.¬†
Location - Beside Paradise movie hall or income tax building Esplanade 
Food - Mughlai khaana
Pocket pinch - ‚Çπ600.00 for two.
Speciality - Chicken Biriyani, Mutton stew, Chicken Bharta, Murgh Musallam and Firni.
Seating - The restro is divided into two floors. The ground floor is non-a/c whereas the 1st floor is a/c. You get delicacies like chicken tikka butter masala, reshmi butter masala and some specialities in the 1st floor section. ¬†I do not know the reason for such differentiation.
My verdict - Please visit this place, I guarantee you won't be turned down.

This is one of the oldest restaurants in the city ! This was once a stalwart of biriyani but now I guess it has lost that status.¬† I have been here quite a few times over the years. 

So earlier today I had decided to have my lunch over here, visited here with my mom during the lunch hours.¬† Asked for the mutton biriyani, they said the mutton biriyani wasn't ready so we went for the chicken biriyani instead.

The dishes arrived within a couple of minutes which was definitely a good thing. Now lets come to the food, the biriyani had no scent, only colours. Chicken was under cooked. The rice was totally dry (Though good for the health conscious people, but not for the foodies like me)

Will not visit here again !

A very popular eatery among the office goers during lunch hours. So after office,i decided to have my lunch here.

They both have a.c & non a.c section. No separate taxes are charged in the non a.c section!! The place was hustling & bustling during lunch hours with people taking takeaways for haleems. So after going through the menu,i quickly ordered the following:-

1. Tandoori roti- Big & a bit thick in size. The rotis werent overly done & was about right. 2 rotis should be enough to satiate a person's hunger.

2. Chicken chap- 1 piece of chap served with creamy & non- rich gravy. The chicken was amazing in taste & was cooked to perfection. The chicken was falling off the bone. The chap was surpisingly low on oil as well which was a bonus. Recommended dish!

3. Firni- 'Magical' the only word which came to my mouth once i took the first spoonful of the firni. This was pure bliss.

The pocket pinch was on the lower side & a person's whole meal woull cost around 230-250 approx. A special mention goes to their lightning fast service since i got my food in 2mins after my order. Another thing which i should mention is that they have recently hiked their prices,so dont go by the menu on zomato. Will surely visit again to try their biriyani & kebabs üëå

The chicken biryani was not that good, chicken piece was not up to the mark.  It had a strong scent and spicy to taste. Quantity was very less compared to what was served earlier. 
Chicken chaap was ok but very oily and was hard. 
Firni which was ordered was very tight and was slightly burnt. 
The only good thing which was there during the meal was the tandoori roti which was very soft and really nice. 
Overall the experience was a great shock and a disappointment to me.

Well all I can say about this place is that even after years abroad my Uncle visits this place first thing after landing instead of coming home!!!!
It's an old favorite of our with the best firni in town.
Things to try here is the chicken biryani with mutton chaap. The mutton stew is a delicacy. Also one can go for the Murg Mussallam and not to forget their tea

My dad once brought Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Bharta and Firni. Not very good food I must say. Fair enough to have it once for giving a trial. That's it.

New Aliah was once the heart throb of Kolkata's foodie but to my surprise it is not the same anymore.
I used to visit there most of the time during 2005-2007 as my work place was very near to this place,  so I visited there few days ago with my husband who is equally a Biriyani lover almost after 10 years and found the food to be most ordinary!
Mutton Biriyani was the main attraction that used to drag me there... But now it's tasteless and dry, mutton was too hard to chew and was under cooked.
Chicken kabab was roasted too much in the tandoor that it had lost all its juiciness and was hard and dry.
Mutton chanp had the same story of under cooked flesh, you need lion's teeth to tear it... The chanp was too oily as well.
Green salad at least had some fresh cucumber and onions...
Firni was not too good but you can have it without struggling much...
I am really disappointed, if they offer me a free meal I won't go there again...

Note: no ideas about other dishes, I can only talk about what I have ordered...

Located at the heart of office para just few walks away from Paradise Cinema hall at Chadni chow area.. The New Aliah Hotel & Carterer is one the famous and old place for biriyani lovers.
It is also consider the top five biriyani destination by zomato in kolkata.
As I'm a biriyani lover... I was rather excited about finally visiting this place .

But my visit was very disappointing.. the staffs are very unfriendly.. after calling for assistance they don't even bother to attend.
The price is moderately fine..The place has two section and the upper section is air-conditioned with a mediocre decor and interior.
Coming to the food at my first visit I ordered mutton biryani,chicken hariyali kabab and firni.
I somehow didn't find it mouth watering.. the biryani was dry less spicy even the quantity was less and so was the kabab dry and chewy.
The place is too much hyped..it was an disappointing experience .

The ambiance is really praise worthy, went there for friend's Birthday party, ordered a lot of things. Biriyani, nan, chicken bharta, mutton kasha, chicken kebabs, firni & cold drink. Coming to the food - Biriyani, nan, kebabs are average, the mutton kasha is something outstanding, i didnt liked the bharta at all. Firni was good, staffs are well behaved & calm, we did so much chaos there :P they tolerated everything :D A big thanks to them.

From the list of around 17 restaurants/ joints famous for Kolkata Biriyani, I have opted for New Aliah Hotel located in Bentinck Street to start my dream Food Walk; Kolkata Biriyani Walk with Debjani. ¬† This place has a special place in my mind; I have visited New Aliah Hotel on a very special day of my life. Years back when I tried Aliah for the first time in my life the day was special given that was for the first time I went for a Movie with my parents and family (Bombay it was). Probably this was the reason I wanted to revisit the place and to start my Biriyani Walk.

This is the 2nd time been here today i.e. 30/04/16.
Air conditioned... The interior is ok. 
But washroom stinks, n not that clean.

The food is good.. Especially firni.
The other cuisines are ok.. But too oily to be healthy..
I consider that good Indian cuisines sacrifices a bit of health, but this is something out of limit.
Had.. Mutton Tikia.... Chap.. Keema.. N all were flooded with oil.

Needless to say it's the best Biryani joint around Chadni Chowk area. The Biryani is heavenly (mutton and chicken). The service is swift. Its the best place to grab a bite inbetween work. The ambience is decent, also doesn't really matter when you need to get a quick lunch. However, its not really a place for strict vegetarians. They do not serve any food without onion in it. So dear vegetarians, don't step into this place only to get disappointed. I come here more quite often, they also give a special 10% discount for regulars. That's a big up! All in all you will definitely love coming back to this place for more Biryani. :)

I went there today for lunch. I had heard that Biriyani is good here. I ordered one mutton biriyani and salad. Biriyani was very good. Mutton piece was very soft. One good point of this restaurant is, they serve every order very quickly. They took less than 5 minutes to serve us. For large groups also they were taking very less time.

Went for a late afternoon Lunch this time.
Had their biryani before, this time kept to the tandoori roti & sides.
Items tried:

Tandoori Roti: really well made, soft & fluffy.

Chicken Rezzala: Chicken piece was disappointing, I mean really, it could do with a little more flesh to it. But the Rezzala Gravy was more than great. Loads of butter & fantastic taste, who needed a chicken piece?

Firni: Didn't know they made such fantastic firni. In fact the best firni I had. Not the whitish dollops of dalda-ish thing most restaurants serve. This had been cooked to perfection. Will definitely go back for this.

Overall, a light on the pocket lunch. Pleasantly surprised by the Firni.Will visit again.
Till then,
happy eating.
Cheers

Was about to stay back in office and hence called in for parcel. 
Ordered mutton biryani and paneer butter masala. 
Biryani as usual was plain rice with one piece of mutton and it was without bone and one piece potatoes. Rice was well cooked wit aroma. But somehow I don't know why people of Kolkata call it biryani. I new it would be plain and dry hence asked for gravy of paneer as well. 
Paneer butter masala was way too oily with wholesome Chunks of paneer and translucent onions quarters. Taste was more on the sweeter side. 
Overall food was OK OK.

This one was on my wishlist for quite a long time. Specially whenever name of biryani came up, someone was sure to swear that this belongs in the same league as Arsalan,Aminia etc. Even Zomato has this under 'Brilliant Biryani' collection. Now it was high time that I paid a visit.

Located near the now closed Orient Cinema, this one was quite easy to locate. They have non-ac seating in the ground floor, air conditioned seating in the first floor. Accommodation is spacious, ambience isn't as attractive. Although the marble top wood tables & antique looking chairs manage to keep the nostalgia of bygone era alive I'm pretty sure a bit of planned lighting won't hurt the look.
Anyway the staff were attentive and we got a seat right away.
The menu is a standard fare for a mughlai restaurant. However I would have liked some more gravy items to go with the breads. The following are what we ordered.

1. Chicken Peshawari:
Pieces were soft, but i found the chicken to have inadequate marinade on it. as a result could not enjoy the starter fully.

2. Plain Naan & Chicken Tikka Butter Masala
I really liked the naan. They were really soft, & not overly burnt at places. Also the sprinkled white sesame seed were generous in amount.
Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, although tasting great, was served at best warm. Seemed as if they prepare their common items beforehand & warm it before serving.

3. Butter Naan & Palak Paneer:
Standard taste. Quite loved both. Again the Palak Paneer gravy seemed to be prepared in advance.

4. Chicken Biryani & Mutton Biryani:
Quite good. Not too much oily, at least the plates were not soaking wet from oil after we finished. Chicken & mutton pieces decent. The potato was a bit hard at the center, & the eggs were disappointingly small in size. However considering the price it was nothing to complaint about.

After all these we were quite full & could not try the firni. Next time I visit, surely will do. Overall the experience was a satisfying one, nothing outstanding though. However the service was far better than that of other restaurants in the vicinity. If not for the biryani one can surely pay a visit for a lunch if they are nearby. I'm sure the food at its price range won't disappoint.
Till then
Happy eating
Cheers.

Sorry to Inform about a experience tonight i have ordered 1 plate chicken biriyani and 1 plate mutton biriyani the manager said there is no chicken biriyani available right now the time of order around 10.45 pm at night however i have ordered two plates of mutton biriyani the bill was rs.310  i have taken two plates of biriyani from esplanade and reached home to behala and when the time comes to have that guys trust me there was a big potato rice quantity was good taste was not bad but i was shocked there was only 2 fresh bone in the two packets without flesh of mutton.the reason for my post is to understand at night if you go to a reputed restaurant thinking that you will get good quality and quantity of foods but when you come back and have a experience that this mutton biriyani plate can be treated just as a potato biriyani and at night there is no other option to get a side dish for that potato biriyani what reaction should a customer have???

Anywz i can understand there may be huge quantity of rice and potato left thatswhy they take order like this but for sure cheating customers like i have its not going to work out.

I would suggest the management for the reputed concern to look into this matter hope my suggetions will surely help you all to give a good service to every customers.

Dont forget Customers are the ultimate boss!!!!!!

The mutton stew and paratha or naan from this place ¬†is the true path to divinity .. The taste is out of the world.. Pieces are tender and aromatic.. I love it.. Even biryani is very good.. Thei place still has the old set of waiters who understand the need of a kolkata citizen. Even biryani is very good. I never explored more cuisines as I continue to order more and more mutton Stew every time I visit this place but can't get fulfilled and come back again..

Biryani is their speciality. i also love their  garlic kulcha ..keema masala.. liver curry. those are mouthwatering. but if u are a health

If good Mughlai cuisine is something you love, you cant miss hitting this place at least once. Love their Biryani. The Rezala is good too along with their Tandoori Roti. But the last time I visited (last Sunday), Rezala was not there. So the waiter suggested me to go for Mutton Stew. I was a bit confused at first but decided to trust the waiter and I was surprised really. The Stew was just too good. Amazing blend of spices and really soft mutton which melts in your mouth. Loved it. We did also order Firni which was pretty good as well. Overall whenever I visit this joint, I come out satisfied.

Winter mornings and I was enroute to Chitto da's, but the smell of biryani enticed me and I plonked myself down in the Non AC section with the bestie. 
Service was warm, very quick, almost fatherly, suggesting dishes, even bringing my masala coke specially made for me from outside when I asked them to. 
I chose Chicken Biryani with the Chicken Quorma.
Biryani was hands down better than most of the greats like Aminia or Shiraz and Arsalan, on par with my beloved India's biryani in terms of the balance of flavours and lightness. Chicken in the biryani was tender and melt in the mouth, absolutely beautiful. 
The Quorma was the show stealer, yes, with a beautiful poppy seed-cashew y-oniony gravy which was light yet elegant enough to befit your homemade Chicken curry. Tender, fall off the bone chicken here as well, totally a winner.
My masala coke was generous, had a good kick of spices and lots of fresh lime juice and pulp.
Bill came to ‚Çπ320, no taxes added.
They also have an upper floor which is really well decorated; perfect for a family celebration or a date.
I can't really describe how good, warm and effective the service is, as good as their Biryani, if not better and it is indeed something that'll make me come back over and again.

Food was cool too except for the Chicken Biryani which was oily and the chicken piece was too hard to chew and swallow. Chicken Tandoori was awesome in taste and was totally worth it, Chicken Bharta was tasty too tandoori roti was soft and tender. Overall a cool experience and luckily the waiter got an extra tip from me which is rare.

Mitton Biriyani is my definition of life, and a visit to the city without gorging on a decent plate of life would be incomplete. 

We went to the upper floor, and were the only people there at 7 30 in the evening. The biriyani was top notch, and the mutton was tender. We had the mutton stew as well, and it was spot on.

Overall, the food was good, and was very affordable.

Biryani is Love. Biryani is Happiness. This is what i learned from this place. They make some seriously awesome dum biryani which you can't afford to miss. The best in kolkata. This place was even featured in Discovery Channel for it's very own Biryanis.
Other delicacies are also heart whelming. Their mutton tikiya and mutton rezala are pure bliss when coupled with the fine Tandoori roti that they serve. 
Service is lightning fast unsurprisingly, obviously because this place has to have such speeds in order to compete. Price is what it should be. Not high, not low. Just the right amount of money you give that you shoukd give.

A warm, heartwarming lunch is all we wanted on this cold winter noon. So we decided to get some Biryani. We walked into this restuarant and ordered a plate of Chicken Biryani and Chicken Korma. The Biryani was warm and its spicy aroma made my mouth water. A spoonful of it and I was in Biryani heaven! It was light enough also. You can have this on your cheat days without a worry. As for the korma,the chicken leg was juicy,soft and perfectly cooked.But what I recommend everyone to try is its soup. Its mindblowing! Its yum heaven!
P.S- Chicken Rezala and Tandoori Roti is must try thingy on the menu here.
P.P.S- My friend ordered a masala coke whuch they actually brought in just for her from outside and it was great!
P.P.P.S- The waiters are REALY nice people here

I only used their take away service so I can't really say much about the service or ambience of the place. What you will love about this place is the taste of their biriyani and chaap. Biriyani is very tasty,less oily and the meat is very well cooked and its very different. The wow factor for me is the Mutton chaap. It's one of the best you'll find in Kolkata hands down. Mutton is full of flavour and is so well cooked it'll just melt in your mouth. A must try! Portions are great and price is very reasonable.

Given a 4 as the ambience is not that great. However the food and service outstanding. We had ordered a chicken biryani which we found closer to the ones we get in Dubai and a chicken chap which looked dark black and oily but tasted yummy. The roti along with it was closer to the afghani rotis so nearer to the actual stuff. Only issue I had was the biryani had a potato which I know is common for this part of the world and there was no raita or curd along with the biryani. We had to order salad separately. We also tried the phirni which was ok. All this along with a big bottle of bisleri costed just 400 and was enough for a couple and a child

On a visit to Kolkata, was done with one meeting in CBD and decided to hop into Aliah - a very old legendary restaurant famous for Chicken chaap with Khameeri roti.
They have maintained the same high level of taste and we ordered for Mutton Biryani,Mutton Chaap,Chicken Korma with roti.
The biriyani was very tasty - a typical Kolkata with Potato in it,the chaap and korma were equally good and mildly spiced. The finish was the BEST and that was Phirni, It was simply awesome and you want more and more.
Hygiene aspect needs a lot of improvement and one point is deducted for this reason.

situated near paradise cinema hall in esplanade. have been here uncountable times. ^_^
staff is good and efficient. ambiance is just about average. for some of the dishes the quantity they give is not much though. coming to the main dish, their biryani is just damn good in all aspects. must try their mutton kassa with warm tandoori rotis, and chicken biryani with chicken reshmi kabab. ^_^

This would be my shortest review. It was only courtesy Saifuzzama Khan A.K.A Saif bhai that I was privileged enough to try the #Firni, the famous Firni of Aliah (That too almost 2 years back). And it was yum! Awesome. Loved it. Gonna try Biriyani of Aliah someday someway for sure!
I will also not forget the #Faluda (the famous Faluda just backside of Tipu Sultaan Maszid) that I have on day at Esplanade, credit goes to once again Saif bhai.

Ahh! Once again a underrated place... Aliah prepares one of the best biriyani in the town. This place was a single floor restaurant with no AC but it has taken over the place above the single floor which is a AC one,  very nice ambience with a old school charm which mixes well with the mughlai cuisine, very courteous staff and quick food service. 
Coming to the food part... try out the biriyani (That's the only reason you are there!! )  and other Tandoori items are regular ones with  no special mentioning. 

Worth the visit,  i must say!

This is far better restaurant than aminia in all aspect.... Situated near paradise cinema hall....it is not crouded as the aminia BT serves the quality food...two section lower non vat section and upper super deluxe section.... Biriyani smells nice...I have to try it...to day I went there with my maternal uncle..... Nothing to say about its ambience ,waiter behavior etc etc...people go there only for food ..just like the royal Indian hotel....we opted for the non a.c ,non vat section.... We ordered two chicken chanps and three butter nuns....comming to the chicken chanp... It may be the best chanp I have ever consumed yet....the 400 -500 kg weighing chickens leg pieces are to soft ,tender and juicy...and its awsm spicy .just made with perfection...and about the nun....yes it really has the flavour and taste of butter... And the nun is very soft... According to me..... Best nan royal Indian hotel best chanp new aliah hotel....upcoming days I will surely try their biriyani and tandoor Items.....thank you....

One of my all time favorite restaurant is this.  Whenever I go here I feel very nostalgic.  Cos I atleast went here for more than 300 times in my life.  The Mutton chanp,  Mutton stew,  Rashmi Kebaab and a must mention about Murgh Masallam.  If u go in the afternoon u also get the tea which is outstanding from all other tea joints.  Their tandoori roti is the best in Kolkata.  Though I am not a biryani lover but I must mention about this too.  U should visit this as it is one of the oldest restaurant in Kolkata.

Aliah, in my sincere opinion, is at par with Aminia. Forget the age-old, famous restaurants here in Kolkata like Shiraz and Zeeshan, which run solely on fame and not on food merit; if you want good Biryani, try out these restaurants.

Aliah serves up some delicious biryani, and their chaap is incredible as well. Their Biryani feels oil free, and their chaap melts away in your mouth. They also serve great quantities! The best part of having spent evenings gobbling away Aliah goodies is that I never seem to get bored of it. 

In case you're thinking of take-aways, their packaging is very good. I am yet to find spillage of any sort and they pack their food HOT. Definitely a winner in my book.

Torn where to get Biryani from?
Pick Aliah. :)

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

One of those places where you can eat your heart out. The Non AC section at the ground floor gives you a feel of those busy clogged 'hotels' of Kolkata unlike the contemporary restaurants. Lightning quick service. The menu is short hence no suggestions as such. But the Lachha Paratha is indeed amazing, and the Mutton Tikia with that. Biriyani, well certainly not the best I've had but is quite decent. Try out, not disappointing.

My first tryst with biriyani began with this particular joint where Dad would take mum and me for puja shopping at new market and post shopping sumptuous lunch . There were small cabins for privacy and we would always pick one of those and order plates of biriyani and mutton chaap and firni. The mutton chaap and the roti tasted mind blowing. There was something about the rich gravy , must be the taste and the flavour which are still reminiscent in my mind. Biriyani was light with tender chicken pieces which wouldnt make you bloat. Thats the kind I like. I havent been to this place for a long time. In my bucket list for sometime soon.

Movie in paradise remains incomplete without eating in aliah! It serves some of the most scrumptious mughlai dishes, available in town. The ambience is modest with an AC and another non AC section. Charge is moderate. The staffs are well behaved and quite fast. Do try their mutton biryani and murgh musallam which comes with an egg! Highly recommended- mughlai lovers just can't miss this one.

Believe me, This is the one & only restaurant in whole Kolkata where you can get Full Murg Mosallam in just 10 min where others take more than 1-2 hours to provide the same. Yes you got it right, its their speciality too. The lovely part about the restaurant is you can choose between AC or Non AC couch, & in both the prices of dishes are very reasonable. Well decor, clean & hygienic, well maintained, well behavior stuffs they have it all compared to the price & standard of the restaurant. Coming to the food, They really hold their specialty tag in Murg Mosallam. This tastes dam good, filled up with appropriate spices, buttery soft chicken, juicy, gravy tastes so good, even comes with an egg too. You must needed to taste this if you are a real foodie. Take this with tandoori roti or parata & you will get a new taste of chicken that you haven't tasted before. The quantity is more than enough for a single person, even with a big hungry stomach. You will definitely not regret after trying this.

Conclusion : There are few people who always compare this with Sabir Restaurant present on the same area, But after you taste their foods & fast service, you will forget all those other restaurants & you will be forced by your toung & stomach to go over there for the second time.

New Aliah, it is a mid budget restro. The place is very big and decorated. The ambition is very nice there. We visit there in a normal weekday, the biryani here is good. But chicken bharta is not good at all. Actually I dislike the taste, I should have order chicken kadai. Still, I can say overall this outlet is good enough.

I am a frequent visitor to this place as it is very near to my office. There are two floors. Ground one is non AC and the 1st is AC. But of course you are not in Alliah for ambience any any way. Now here comes the food. My personal favourite is Tangri Kebabs. But I also like their Lacha Paratha and Mutton Tikia. Apart from these The Biriyani is very good and at par with the Arsalan and Aminia. Mutton Champ is also pretty good one may try for sure.

This place is surely a best dine out place if you are a mughlai food lover.. This restaurant is located in Bentick Street near Paradise Cinema..

The interior of this restaurant is good but can be much better as compare to Arsalan and Shiraz...

No fancy stuff, just eat your food, pay the bill and vacate the place..that's it. On a regular day in office when I was running hungry to and fro, I visited this place just for their biriyani. This is one of the most famous biriyani eateries in Kolkata. I had chicken biriyani, chicken bharta, one soft drinks. Biriyani was flavourful, quantity was more than enough, rice grains were long, potato was soft and moist, meat piece was also tender and moist, it met my expectations. I indulged myself into gluttony..and never looked here or there. There is nothing to say about the ambiance as there is no such thing, may be the upper floor with ac accomodation would give you a better experience. The service was fast and as informal as it can get. I also never expected anything else, this is not your fine dinning restaurant. So, make it fast and leave the place with a burp...I did so. My ratings on food - 4, on ambiance - 2.5, and on service - 3.2. Overall ratings - 3.3

They thinks they will just put some mutton pieces and call it haleem. But foodies like me have tried awesome haleem in Bangalore. It is just not available in Kolkata. Did not get one till now.

The reviews I read about this restaurant warms the cockles of my heart.To a true Calcuttan,the food hub was and will always be Chowringhee,also called Esplanade.There was Amber,the now defunct Song Hay,Dacres Lane which is the khau gall I of Kolkata et all.
One star shining bright always has been the Aliah.The Shiraz mould,serving tea,as well as biryani.
Personally speaking I like the biryani but not so much the chaap.But that way,I only like the chaap from Shiraz.Today after the rave reviews I decided to pack some mutton Haleem for home.
But ladies and gentlemen,those of you by now familiar with my knack to identify a particular eatery with some very special dishes,the 'piece de resistance 'of Aliah is the Murg Mussallam.One of the perhaps two places doing the same in Kolkata and displayed mouth-wateringly in the glass showcase at the entry,it is a signature dish,too good to be true.A full chicken,marinated in secret masala,drenched in oily gravy like all mughlai dishes,can easily be shared over the fat rotis.
I worshipped the special chilli pork and schewan prawn of Song Hay in this very lane.One of my saddest days was when they closed shop.I just wish new Aliah and the Murg Mussallam just live on......forever!!!!!!!

Haleem special edition : Hunt for the best haleem in town indeed ends here .though some of the fellow foodies might say that aminia serves the best haleem in town but hallem in alia equally leaves a mark in you ! I went to try their haleem .Just to discuss .Haleem is a arabic dish which contains lentils,meat,spices all toeghther sorted into a thick paste. The beauty of this dish is that it is cooked for a very long time and good haleem takes around 6 to eight hours in order to get the right amount of consistency and taste.

Hallem@alia is specially made over the night and sweet aroma can be smelt from thr moment you enter bentick street. I ordered for a plate of hallem ( a mind you it was my first time trying out haleem ) and nan .i instantaneously got the food and boy ! It was soooooo yummy ! The entire journey from dipping the roti into a well balanced haleem to melting it in the mouthis unexplainable. The added mutton chunks which you get occasionally while eating improves the overall experience.

I would suggest you all to must try this haleem from alia before the season ends .

Enough said ! Hogg on !

All are top class considering the prices. My favourite dish of this place has always been Mutton Keema, its The Best Mutton Keema in Kolkata.

It's a wonder how didn't even I knew this dish exists 1 year back!!!!  That's why Ramadan is special for me... 

Even without Halim, this food joint has plenty more to offer foodies like us. One can try Biriyani, Chaps & various Kabab's from their menu! 

I've heard about this place a year back & since then I'm a huge fan of their Halim & Biriyani. Well, one can say this is not the best place to have Biriyani in Kolkata. But, this is definitely the place you want to visit during the Ramadan. 

Go there & enjoy!

Came here on first day of Ramzan 2015 for Haleem. Ordered Mutton haleem. Ate it for the first time. Great dish. Wasn't very rich. The gravy was amazing.
Their prompt service is also commendable.
Costing is reasonable. We were 4 friends, ordered tandoori and rumali roti with 2plates mutton haleem and 1plate chicken bhurta and 1plate salad. And a cold drinkn each. Bill was 800 with tax. Which is pretty cool.
Walking distance from Esplanade metro. Easily locatable.
Ambience is bit antique-ish.
Would recommend others to visit this place.

The best biryani in calcutta can be had here. Be sure to have it in the non av section so you will be served hot straight from the dum. I personally enjoy the potato more than the meat. The flavour of the biryani is absolutely breath taking.

I think it has now become a ritual of my family to visit this place every time we come to Kolkata.
I have been coming to this restaurant since I was a kid and even my father has been coming to this mouth watering place since he was a kid.To tell very honestly I am not really a very big Non -Veg fan.
But yes I shout to the whole world that I love Chicken biryani of this restaurant.
Just one word WOW.
The chicken is so well cooked and soft.And the biryani and its aaloo perfectly cooked with so less oil yet so delicious,that even after using a spoon to eat one is bound to lick fingers.
It recently opened up an A.C section also(which too I visited)
But I don't know why I find the Non AC area better,maybe of its authenticity.
And yes the staff is very helpful.
So I will suggest this restaurant to all Mughlai fans. Especially try its Chicken Biryani.
Trust me you will feel drawn towards this place once you visit it .

New Aliah is actually an unsung hero amongst the leading Mughlai players of kolkata..Older than most of the famed joints like Arsalan or Zeeshan, this restuarant has actually played a pivotal role along with Aminia and Royal to establish the brand of Biriyani in the Kolkata food scene..It is located just opposite to Amber off the Bentinck Street and is a legendary yet under rated name today among the foodies..Their Mutton Chaap is a personal favourite and used to be one of the best at a point of time..It is still their usp alongwith its decent,tastefull Biriyani.. not much hyped,nice assortment of flavours and a special mention to the generous chunck of meat served..This place is usually crowded during the office hours and even in the dinner time mainly because of the pocket friendly delectable spreads..Do try their various Kebab items as well..Service is fast and efficient as expected and food is still quite good and way better than several other mughlai joints..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 4.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 2.5/5

Starting with,according to me,this food outlet lives quite up to its reputation.Mughlai items are really cooked quite good with the Chicken and Mutton Chanp garnering my most applaud.Chicken Liver which I tried was also a nice item.The only con which I feel is te price tag which seems a bit(but not much) overpriced considering the price tags compared to other famous mughlai hotel like Royal Indian Hotel,Sabir's etc.But all in one a good recommendation for me.

If you want to have biryani but lighter version of it you can definitely go for it located on the main road near paradise hall is a small resturant where foid is served love from the hands of elderly people yes indeed the service staff is of aged people but they are full of energy and zest.  The food is good but in the lunch time its a really crowded place but for biryani so good it will be crowded. Basically it has mughlai cusine biryanis and chaps but for vegetarian also they have quite a few options. Not very expensive but definitely serves food to delight your taste buds...so whenever in esplanade and feeling like having biryani this place will be a good bet

Highly Recommended!New Aliah Hotel in Bentinck Street, near paradise cinema hall is famous for traditional Mughlai dishes from Lucknow like Murg Musallam, Biriyani and Chicken Chapp. It's one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. I have been dining out there again and again for last 6-7 years. Now there's an ac upper floor apart from the non-ac ground floor. The interior on the upper floor is good, service is not bad. Now comming to the food, i love almost everything they serve but my personal favourite are Mutton stew n Tadoori roti n the Firni. I would Highly recommend this place!

Aliah is probably not as celebrated as other popular biryani joints of the city but it's light, fragrant biryani is better than many. It is one of the oldest Biryani joints in the city and their biryani recipe has been guarded for generations. The biryani comes with a perfectly flavoured piece of ¬†potato (when it comes to Kolkata biryani, except Royal, the taste of the biryani lies in its alu) and I don't think you need any kind of gravy to go with it. They also serve strong, milky (but not overwhelmingly sweet) tea with nan. A quirky but satisfying snack combo.

A complacent dinner after a perfect IPL win of KKR at Eden gardens. The place is always crowded be it ac or non-ac. We ordered a nothing new chicken bharta and chicken chap with tandoori roti. Firni was tasty in the dessert. Place is nearer to esplanade thereby helping a quick and budgetary food experience.

New Aliah restaurant and caterer located beside Paradise cinema hall at Bentick street Esplanade is one of the landmark places for Biryani and North Indian cuisine in Kolkata.

After a long hiatus I had visited this place a few days back for a quick lunch.They have a simple no nonsense non ac section and a little more elaborate ac section also.I ordered a chicken biryani which arrived swiftly and was quite lovely too.I was impressed by the aromatic biryani and the long grained rice.It was one of those biryanis which one can easily have alone without any side dish.The quality of the chicken piece and the quantity was decent too.I also got for myself a firni which looked and tasted a lot more earthier than the ones you get elsewhere.But it was a bit too sweet for my liking.This place also serves up decent rolls and it also makes one of the best murg masallams in the city in my opinion.

The prices have gone up a bit over the years but are still more or less reasonable.Overall this heritage place is one of the better and safer options for the good old biryani.

ALIAH is one of the oldest and used to be an iconic spot for biriyani lovers. They held the ground quite beautifully with great biriyanis and kebabs to date. The best part about Esplanade is places like this one in every corner. Their kebabs are so tender that it just melts in your mouth and the menu is full of delicious options. One visit is never enough for a place like this.

Some might find the ambiance unhygienic but, I never gave heed to that. The service is quite nice and people are always in a hurry for pouring orders. The tables are arranged as 70s era and they do have an AC space on the 1st floor. It's a no miss place for a foodie.

Most famous for its biryani and kababs or tikka.
Food is really food.
Ac sitting arrangements is there but limited seats.
Now most importantly though i agree food is really good but no ambience no proper attendents but still it charges a lot of money for its dishes.
Its a small place though can be tried for its great tasting biryani or kababs.

A few days ago we packed some food from Aliah. 
The ambience of this place is mediocre with unfriendly staff. We were not given the bill even after asking for it repeatedly. So, in all the ambience and the others things were a turn off for me. 

Anyway, now moving to the food. We parcelled the following things ;

1)Chicken biryani and Mutton Biryani (Rs.145 each plate) 3.1/5 : The rice was long grained, fragrant and flavourful. The meat pieces were however medium in size along with a potato in each plate. The potato had no flavour or aroma at all. It was just like a coloured boiled potato.

2) Chicken Chaap (Rs.127/plate) 2/5 : The piece of the chicken was again medium in size. The chaap was full of dalda! Well, I know chaap is supposed to be oily but the dalda was almost set like a thick custard making it impossible for us to eat it. It was forming a kind of layer of sticky oil in our mouth.

3) Mutton chaap (3.5/5) (Rs.127/plate) : Surprisingly the mutton chaap was less oily (or should I say, less dalda-y). The chaap was pretty tasty but with a very little portion of mutton in it..

The saving grace of our dinner was the mutton chaap only! Really dissapointed with the food.

Not really recommend.

Location: Situated next to Paradise Cinema Hall, on main road- easy to locate.

‚ÄúNew Aliah Hotel & Caterer‚Äù or just ‚ÄòAliah‚Äô is a well known restaurant to biriyani loving Kolkatans, which needs no introduction. It is a two storied restaurant, the ground floor has ordinary ambiance with ordinary looking marble topped tables and wooden chairs with minimal decor but the first floor is well arranged, decor is good, air conditioned and tidy, if you are visiting the place with family do opt for 1st floor.

I visited the place around 9 pm with 2 friends on a Sunday and chose to settle at ground floor, the place was not that crowded, not what we expected...only 3-4 tables were occupied, thank god!! coz at times it gets very boring to wait in queues. The staffs were friendly and quite good in service. Coming to food, our order was:

-	Mutton Biriyani: Good. Flavourful...it had one medium sized mutton piece and a potato, good quality long grain rice and the portion size is generous for one.

-	Mutton rezala: the mutton was cooked to perfection and tasted superb, goes well with roti or naan but the portion was less and too oily.

-	Mutton kasha: disappointing...too oily, mutton was very stiff and the gravy tasted bland. 

-	Tandoori roti: served hot and soft.

-	Firni: the best part of the meal...simply brilliant. Creamy with optimal sweetness.

Our total bill came around 900/- bucks...quite reasonable actually!!! Overall a good restaurant to have biriyani but really isn't the best restaurant in Kolkata.

New aliah on bentick street is one of the finest places for Biryani in Kolkata.
The place is very old but it's nicely maintained. The ground floor section is a no hassle no hangout section. Finish your food and leave as the rush is insane.
The food at this place has always been good. I've never had a meal and not been satisfied.
My normal order is a portion of their simply amazing mutton stew along with crisp khamiri roti. This is followed by chicken Biryani and chicken chaap.
Even though I'm more of a chicken guy, the mutton stew they offer is the best dish out here. The meat is really tender and succulent and the gravy is scrumptious.
But what is good Biryani without a good ending. The phirni over here is the best phirni in Kolkata. Does help that they give a huge portion of it.
Mind you this place isn't exactly pocket friendly as a meal for 2 here costs around ‚Çπ800.

Truly, I suggested the restaurant to my friends just depending on the RATING of Zomato. And, moreover a pocket friendly joint...we had ordered Butter Nan (soft, thick with whipps of butter), Chicken Jhal Frezi (Julien of capsicum and tomato merged with cheese and chicken, though could have been better), Chicken Rhesmi Butter Masala (awesome kebabs with mouthwatering gravy), Chicken Biriyani (something like the exact mixture, neither too rich nor less...tasted pretty good) and finally Firni (superb...must try...).

Located in central Kolkata,this joint is next to Paradise cinema,on the main road.Its got a ground and a first floor, upper one for families.Had gone with friends few days back.Initially we sat at the gr floor,and ordered Mutton kebab,which was dipped in oil,medium spicy,and amazing!we were ravenous and had it in minutes.A friend told us to go upstairs, which is a different world altogether.Lovely woodwork with upholstery, and comfy sofas to sit.We ordered the special mutton biryani, and raita, as they do not give any complimentary gravy/raita.We quickly ate the Biryani, which is low in oil,less spicy,and the mutton along with typical Kolkata style of egg and potato was delicious. We ordered one more!A friend wanted to have tea,which he said turned out to be pretty bad.Desserts we ordered Phirni,which came frozen,apparently just out of the freezer.Was ok to eat,but had become quite chewy due to cold.All this in about 1200 bucks, and a hearty meal.Has to be one of the best Biryani joints in Kolkata.

One can imagine why office-goers in and around Esplanade absolutely crave for this place. This probably has one of the best Mutton Biriyanis in this part of the city. It was unbelievably good - the mutton was tender, the rice was cooked very well, light and flavoured perfectly. The salad they give with a little Mughlai dressing on top is quite the side-treat.¬†And of course, their Firni. As good as any.If you're a connoisseur and are around Central Kolkata, do catch a hold of this place. You'll come out wanting more.

If in Kolkata and your office happens to be nearby, a visit to Aliah is a must. Boy oh boy I was bowled over by the aroma that was being generated from quite a distance as I was approaching the place!! It also brought back those childhood memories which I have in this city.

This time I made up my mind to stick to the Mutton Biryani only and not try my hand with the other delicacies. Sometimes the richness of the food takes your stomach for a toss.

The Mutton biryani had the same old Kolkata mughlai food feeling with the mutton being tenderly cooked and topping it with the boiled aloo!! The biryani rice was also the best basmati which does not give you the feeling of being overboard with the food. It overall leaves a satisfying effect which leaves you wanting for more. To top it all, the price is less than a 150/-!!

If you happen to be in Kolkata and near the Esplanade area, just go ahead and give this place a try. I am sure the food will not dissatisfy you and you will come back for more.

Just do it!!

An age old eatery that does everything right. well almost everything. This is my go to place for the lightest Biriyani in town, without compromising a least bit on taste. Definitely worth a visit - be it for a lunch quickie or a dine out with friends or family. With the recently opened up AC 1st floor, there's ample seating. But for that authentic age old charm, i would recommend the ground floor.
Biriyani is definitely the highlight . Light, less oily, but excellent aromatic rice (read Bengali style-with a potato) is best enjoyed with Keema Curry or Mutton Stew (not for the light -hearted) Parathas and chaanp too keep ur apetite going. And to finish it off, they make the best FIRNI in town. Period.Do drop by.¬†
PS: With the recent hike in prices, and quantity by the plate diminishing , some may find a reason to complain.

It is one of those restaurants which has stood the test of time. It can easily be part of legendary segment of restaurants in kolkata. This hotel has many loyal followers and you will find very few kolkatians not aware of this place. The place is vintage and crammed for place which is its ground floor however at the top things are opposite. You have large well decorated a.c place on the first floor. The place expertise in non-veg and I think it's menu has seen little change over decades. I found the food little above average but nothing that will sweep you off your feet. Its one of the most value for money place to visit around ganesh chandara avenue and esplanade.

When it comes to authentic biriyani, few places come close to match up the taste at Alia. Place has been quenching my hunger for a quick biriyani bite since I moved to kolkata in 2012.
Very close to my office, ok prices, quick & courteous service. What more can you ask for.
Our staple diet when at this place is Chicken/Mutton biriyani with mutton stew. The rest of the dishes are good as well.
Presentation-wise the ranking would go much lower but the taste of food makes yoy forget everything.
Highly recommended if your office is anywhere in/around Dalhousie.

Legends of Mughlai food. Have been here a lot (and I mean it). I had biryani here when I was a 6 yr old kid and I had it when I was 26. I had been here when it was not a AC restaurant and it had the old style cabins. Well over the ages the taste has remained the same (quantity reduced a bit, the aroma mellowed down the price went up; but trust me still I won't complain about the taste coz it has survived decades). Even today when I write this review, I am really missing the flavors. Good food, quick service and value for money.

Personal favorite: ¬†Mutton biryani, chicken chap, keema masala, kebabs, firni

**I had biryani picked up from this place on my birthdays when I was a kid.. Trust me it was that good.. hope to see this place stick around so that I can bring my kid here like my dad brought me

Nice place, Nice interiors of the AC restaurant.Had chicken Biriyani, Mutton chaap and firni!The chicken biriyani was quite decent..
Less oily, the chicken piece was well cooked and it came along with an egg.The mutton Chaap was in my opinion a tad too spicy! Otherwise would have been a good dish..
The chicken chaap is better as i've heard
As for the firni.. One word- MARVELOUS!!
One of the best firnis in town.. it is one of the prime reasons i am rating this Restaurant a 4 of 5! :)

Biriyani, not that good. Firni was very good. Comparing to other restaurants Aliah is on the higher side at price rates. Side dishes were somehow okay.

I trusted zomato on this and m really wondering how the hell this got some good reviews. My home made food are better than this. The staff are helpful though. Decor is alright. But we don't go to restaurant to see the decor or how the waiters are. I would never recommend this as per food is concerned.

A legendary place where you can get authentic mughlai food that is the one liner you would always hear about this place.
We made our decision to have the experience.
Location-Taking a left turn from K.C.Das,a few minutes walk is sufficient to find the resturant on your left side.

Decor & Staff behaviour- We straightway went to the AC section ,it was a good atmosphere ,the staff were not rude but wasn't attentive much.

Now its time to talk about food...

Tikka kabab-- It was really deliciously cooked and the spices was perfect.

Chicken Biriyani-- It was less oily,less spicy and yet very good.The biriyani here comes with a piece of egg.

Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala-- I just loved the gravy.

Firni-- It was the best firni i ate for a long time.It had a hard texture and different taste.


Overall , we were extremely delighted to have the experience and would surely come back again.

For a biriyani lover like me, this place is a paradise. The taste is ever delicious, ever consistent. The biriyani and the chap is to die for. The chap goes well with the naan. The biriyani is light on the stomach and easy to digest. Have eaten from here for years and will continue doing so!

BIRIANY is it ! can there be a better place for a wholesome chicken biriany? 
My votes to them for serving the best biriany in the city, have tried the contenders like arsalan, shriraz, mezban, aminia, india hotel (khiderpur), oudh 18**,  and others. No where in the town does one get a this delicate aroma with very balanced oil/ghee content coupled up with tastebud tantalizing spices. Believe me this biriany increases one's appetite! 
other preparations are also good. Aliah Rocks!

This is one of the oldest restaurant in Kolkata when it comes to moghlai food including biryani and kababs. I have a special connection with this joint because i feel that this place sells the best firni in Kolkata. I am a big big fan of their firni and i can consume 2-3 firni cups in a go. The best part is they serve the firnis in earthen containers and it has a earthy flavour of its own. The firni has been consistent in taste and quality over decades and you will never be able to complain or find flaws with the firni (atleast i could never). Being an old restaurant Aliah has all the expertise of serving mouth watering kababs and their biryani is fantastic!!! The interior has been renovated which is good in a way. The waiters have been there for years and knows how to serve you best. The other items like naan and chicken chaap are equally good and tasty.

it's a very old and traditional Muslim resto in central kolkata, bt hasn't acclaimed much popularity till date !! we got to know abt them from Times Now's show "the Big Foodie". as per their review Aliah serves the best biriyani in the city, so we had to taste it. we decided to pay them a visit on a ramzaan eve, we ordered Mutton arabi haleem, murg mussallam, rumali rotis, special mutton biriyani and Firni. i cant say we had the best preparations in kolkata, but yes the haleem was less spicy and high on taste, totally different from wat we usually find at arsalan and shiraz outlets. same for the biriyani, it was less on oil, the mutton was tender and smelled heavenly. at the end of the day, we were very pleased. totally VFM.. highly recommended

I recently visited the place with my friends to check out the HALEEM during the ramzan season. It was my first experience of haleem and we came here because we had heard it serves one of the best haleems in town and also because we had not tried out this place before. Located near Esplanade, it is a huge restaurant situated at a corner on the main road. It has 2 floors, the first floor being air-conditioned. We chose to settle at that only.
The service was quite fast . The ambience is also good, you can see a lot of mirrors all around !

Sadly, we were disappointed with the ¬†food. The haleem ¬†was only full of daal and daal. We could find only few tiny pieces of mutton in the sea of daal. The muttons moreover were fully bony and had very less meat. The firni also tasted very different. It was more of sandesh than firni. Not at all expected from a huge mughlai restaurant like this.
The rating of 2.5 I've given is only because of the spacious and airy place and for two other dishes which we liked. That was the mutton kasha, which was really good and spicy. Another was the chicken biriyani. The piece of chicken was wholesome and the biriyani was equally good as other mughlai restaurants. Ya, the kulchas were also quite tasty, a lot of masala in them.

Overall, you wouldn't be missing out much if you dont visit this place. But still, what's the harm in trying, is what I always say ! :-)

Another very old restaurant in the heart of the city. Another biryani den for biryani lovers. This is one of the most under estimated restaurants in Kolkata. Believe me or not Aliah still serves one of the best biryani in Kolkata. Those who have not been there must visit once. I can promise you will not be disappointed by the quality of biryani. Though little short on space and ambience. Service is quick but if you look at the face of the waiters, you will not enjoy your food. Serves one of the best Firni too. Kebabs needs improvement.

After some shopping at New Market we have decided to visit this restaurant just beside Paradise Cinema and it is much more nearer to Chandni Chowk Metro Station than Esplanade. We went for the AC restaurant on the 1st floor as the the ground floor was full. The interior decoration was pretty and the environment was soothing ,the tables were arranged well and the waiters were very much attentive and helpful though the food was not that good like the other said things. We ordered,

Mutton Special Biriyani: The rice part was good but the meat was smelly and over-rated in Zomato.

Chicken Tandoor(Half) : It was overcooked.

Reshmi Butter Chicken Masala: This one was really good,tasty but not delicious.
¬†Hence lesson learnt ,never go for any experiment ,if you are in New Market go to Aminia/Nizam for Biriyani :)

Visited this "Beauty of Bentinck" last weekend for lunch. I visited it first time since this place started their 1st floor ac facility n found it very pleasant- it adds a new dimension to this eatery. The quality of food remains as it is n ordered - chckn tandoori, chckn reshmi kebab, mutton biryani, chckn chanp, n firni.
If I mention any one of the above it wud b injustice to rest. N truly all are mouth watering.  The kebab was tender n we took barely few minutes to hv it. Next was the tandoori n blv me theose legs were hot, smooth, n tasty. Once we r done wid strtrs biryani n chanp were waiting for us - the biryani was awesome (srvd with an egg) n chanp was succulent. Lastly we had firni - the texture was a bit pale but the taste was superb. Thats the end of our lunch n I hope to visit the place soon.
Had 2 mutton haleem as parcel - the haleem was good but I found it slightly spicey.
P.S: egg in the biryani is served only at the 1st floor ac facility.

I was introduced to Aliah only two years back and I regret having missed so many years of such delicious food. Leave all inhibitions behind once you are inside this small free seating restaurant. You may choose to sit in the AC section, but we prefer to mingle. Don't think twice about ordering anything in twos and then asking for some more, because I assure you will.
Don't mind eating with your fingers, digging into the delicious mutton and scooping the fabulous biryani. Just don't think about anything. Just EAT.
We always order our standard fare- chicken or mutton biryani, chicken stew, mutton korma, firni, firni and more firni. Writing this had made me hungry which stands for the brilliant experience at Aliah. 
Plus point, the host, usually an old uncle loves to feed and if he sees you as an enthusiastic customer, he will hover around you and ask you for helpings. Up selling. Promotion be as it may, it is helpful not be judged and eat till you pass out.

Well it's old and it's gold. When I ordered food it took incredibly long for them to serve on a not so crowded restaurant. But once the food came in I realised that it was worth the wait. From kebabs,tandoori, Biriyani, rezala,rotis and firni everything was just what the doctor ordered for a lovely Sunday lunch. Percfet pricing and the ambiance which mostly consisted the great smell of tandoor was just right. Legends will be legends.

This fine eatery is on bentinck street,adjacent to paradise cinema hall and ayakar bhavan.its always a better idea to take the detour upstairs and opt for the ac dining room,as its quite cozy up there.the interior,although nothing too ornate,is quite charming with glazed brick walls,and small little chandeliers. We went recently on poila boishakh and found it not so thronged at  5.neways we had an apetite for mutton biryani,chicken hariyali and garlic nun and we wordered so.the meal was served in 15 mins. The biryani was less oily than in most,and they give an egg with it.i must say the piece of mutton that accompanied was inimical to a hearty satisfaction,but they might have run out of the good ones by 5.no sweat,the rice was good. They make the Garlic nun quite crisp and with the distinct garlicky flavour and its good too.reshmi chicken is also nicely done,the gravy being a must try,but again comes out in an almost deplorable proportion,only 4 small pieces.neways the place really impressed with its sound cooking and affable serving,and I recommend it highly

Ever since a leading newspaper rated it as the best biryani place in Kolkata, I wanted to try it. Although I would not go as far as saying it serves the best biryani in town, but it definitely is among my favorites now! The biryani was authentic (Kolkata style, less spicy, adequately fragrant and perfectly cooked), and so was the mutton rezalla.

It might not be the best place to dine-in (I had mine parceled), but the place has retained its old-world charm in spite of all the changes in and around the locality. Highly recommended.

After a session of much awaited summer shopping from New Market, we came to this less visited part of Esplanade in search of The New Aliah restaurant, this Monday. The place is tucked away at a corner of a bending lane along Bentinck Street and a minute‚Äôs walk from the Tipu Sultan Mosque. It is a clean and simple, old fashioned restaurant with two floors. We settled in the non-AC section (ground floor) with the narrow marble top tables, benches and an ample number of ceiling fans above us (thank God for that!).
As it was 4 in the evening, a hearty lunch was a faraway thought. We ordered for half a plate of Chicken Tandoori and a plate of Mutton Biryani. Within 7 minutes, the food arrived making us realize how famished we were. There were two pieces of extremely hot and nicely charred chicken. The overpowering smoky flavor was finely balanced with some chat masala sprinkled on top, perfectly blended dhania and curd dip and a salad of chopped onions. Sadly, one of the pieces was a bit too chewy while the other one was soft and succulent. The biryani had a considerate amount of rice but had one tiny piece each of boiled potato and mutton (and no egg). Even though it lacked the aroma of the kerwa water, it tasted very good with the light spices. Anyhow, I was missing the usual long and thin strands of rice that go into the making of the typical Kolkata biryani.
The servers were extremely polite and always at our disposal. Even the bill was pocket friendly and they didn't charge any extra VAT in the non-AC section. 
Next time I‚Äôm definitely having their firni!

Even though I have been living in Kolkata only since the past 10 years, my association with this restaurant goes dates back to when I was in the 1st standard. I remember coming from Guwahati and I would cry out to my uncle to take me to this place. That was in 1995. After that I am coming to this restaurant in 2013 and quite a few times since 2013. I don't remember much from those days, but it is still a good biryani joint for me. My order would always be simple: a chicken biryani. a chicken chaap and a chicken rezala. All I can remember, apart from the taste which is still the same, is they have taken out the egg from the biryani. Since then many popular shops have opened up, but it still holds a special place for me.

Came here for a quick meal the other day. Our order was simple - a full plate of Biryani (a double), a chicken chaap, and two thums ups. We decided on splitting the biryani since it was pretty big and the waiter suggested it as well. There were two pieces of chicken in the Biryani, and two pieces of potato, along with one egg. Here I have a little question - since there's two pieces of chicken, and two potatoes, shouldn't there be two eggs too? (I mean, logically....). 

The biryani was a delectable mess of spicy, fluffy rice, soft potatoes, and nicely done chicken. The chaap served along with it was very spicy, and counterbalanced the Biryani nicely. We got a piece from the chicken breast, and we found it slightly stringy but still very good. The thums ups were chilled and helped get everything down pretty well.

New Aliah is a place I generally go back to from time to time. its not very posh, but it does make one of the best biryanis I have had in Kolkata. The biryani is light, moist, and very tasty, and comes with a soft potato and a perfectly hard-cooked egg, and soft mutton, with a texture that is not absolutely soft or very tough - just right. During Ramadan, they make mutton and chicken haleem which is tasty, although not the best in the town. I love the chaap, which is drier than most other places, and the meat is slightly drier, but also very addictive, going best with rumali rotis. The service is quick, brisk and friendly, and the decor is nice, especially in the AC section.

A surprising mughlai experience at ALIAH HOTEL!
========================================================================
Brief:

I had planned to visit with my brother to the top restaurant they have opened. I was very surprised to see that they have worked so greatly on the ambience. The ac was soothing. The place was neat and clean. The staffs were much more courteous and it was definitely giving a restaurant feeling. When it comes to biriyani, Aliah is one of my very old favorite. The best part about the biriyani is the tender aloo and the 'essence' of saffron and other masalas which always gives an appropriate touch to the nose. The chicken also has appropriate amount of masalas. The best part is the biriyani does not have a lot of oil.
========================================================================
Food:

Ordered:

1) Chicken Biriyani - As it is a restaurant, the prices were definitely more. The biriyani costed 144 bucks. However, what was surprising to see that they had added egg as an add on for the biriyani. It was surprising for a second because i have never seen Aliah using egg. From the chicken to the potato, all were pretty well cooked. The biriyani out here can not be missed at any COST. One must try it.

2) Firni - This is my favorite out here. The orange colour firni having a little sweet flavour is mouth melting. Served cold to me and was very much enjoyable.

If you are looking for two unique and definitely favorite items, these are the signatures. I was very happy and satisfied with the food.
========================================================================
Service:

The staffs were courteous. As we were carrying our bags, it was very kind of the staffs to take our bags and help us get more space on the table. Much surprised this time.
========================================================================
Summary:

Food presentation 4/5
Food quality 4.5/5
Service 5/5
Hygiene 5/5
VFM 5/5
Taste 5.5/5 ( The biriyani and the firni here my god. If you have not tried this, you have missed something in life. Seriously. A very unique preparation of Firni)
========================================================================
Pros:

1) Crowded everytime.
2) Essence of the biriyani on the streets catches the people's mind.
3) Prompt service
4) Courteous staffs
5) Value for money - Pretty reasonable
6) Unique preparation of Firni. You won't get it anywhere.
7) Biriyani is prepared on less oil. Probably, everyone was searching for less oil. This is the place.
8) Opening a restaurant that too a lovely one is an add on.
9) Ambience of the above restaurant is good. However, below is for fast eaters. It's very okay types.

Cons:-
1) Very rarely the Biriyani gets served Cold. I have probably had so much out here. It's one of my favorite Biriyani joint.
========================================================================
Conclusion:

If you haven't tried this, you have missed something in life. That's all i can say. :) Mughlai at it's best. Very happy to see zomato out here and they are getting updated with the club solitaire system.

Location: Aliah is situated near the amber hotel or basically between Esplanade and Chandni chowk metro station. Opposite to kanha.

Serves: Aliah is a very old restaurant and previously it never had the first floor AC section which they built recently. They best part about Aliah is the biriyani they serve at lighting fast speed. The chicken and mutton biriyani is at its best at Aliah. It has a very less oil content and one gets the essence of biriyani just from outside the hotel. They serve kababs also personally never tried but it feels ok they take time to prepare.
Even after accommodating so many people, it is always full and a very busy hotel. People give huge parcels for its speciality biriyani. The mughlai rizala and roti is pretty good. But as all mughlai dishes are oily, same goes with Aliah

Pros: 1) One of the best biriyani prepared with less oil and perfect essence with no added flavours.
2) the orange firni they prepare I haven't had in my life anywhere. And it's one of the most tastiest dishes.
3) chicken rizala and mutton champ and roti are pretty ok
4) cheap and very reasonable

Cons:1) proper hygiene is not maintained at the ground floor.

After a session of much awaited summer shopping from New Market, we came to this less visited part of Esplanade in search of The New Aliah restaurant, this Monday. The place is tucked away at a corner of a bending lane along Bentinck Street and a minute‚Äôs walk from the Tipu Sultan Mosque. It is a clean and simple, old fashioned restaurant with two floors. We settled in the non-AC section (ground floor) with the narrow marble top tables, benches and an ample number of ceiling fans above us (thank God for that!).
As it was 4 in the evening, a hearty lunch was a faraway thought. We ordered for half a plate of Chicken Tandoori and a plate of Mutton Biryani. Within 7 minutes, the food arrived making us realize how famished we were. There were two pieces of extremely hot and nicely charred chicken. The overpowering smoky flavor was finely balanced with some chat masala sprinkled on top, perfectly blended dhania and curd dip and a salad of chopped onions. Sadly, one of the pieces was a bit too chewy while the other one was soft and succulent. The biryani had a considerate amount of rice but had one tiny piece each of boiled potato and mutton (and no egg). Even though it lacked the aroma of the kerwa water, it tasted very good with the light spices. Anyhow, I was missing the usual long and thin strands of rice that go into the making of the typical Kolkata biryani.
The servers were extremely polite and always at our disposal. Even the bill was pocket friendly and they didn't charge any extra VAT in the non-AC section. 
Next time I‚Äôm definitely having their firni!

Even though I have been living in Kolkata only since the past 10 years, my association with this restaurant goes dates back to when I was in the 1st standard. I remember coming from Guwahati and I would cry out to my uncle to take me to this place. That was in 1995. After that I am coming to this restaurant in 2013 and quite a few times since 2013. I don't remember much from those days, but it is still a good biryani joint for me. My order would always be simple: a chicken biryani. a chicken chaap and a chicken rezala. All I can remember, apart from the taste which is still the same, is they have taken out the egg from the biryani. Since then many popular shops have opened up, but it still holds a special place for me.

Came here for a quick meal the other day. Our order was simple - a full plate of Biryani (a double), a chicken chaap, and two thums ups. We decided on splitting the biryani since it was pretty big and the waiter suggested it as well. There were two pieces of chicken in the Biryani, and two pieces of potato, along with one egg. Here I have a little question - since there's two pieces of chicken, and two potatoes, shouldn't there be two eggs too? (I mean, logically....). 

The biryani was a delectable mess of spicy, fluffy rice, soft potatoes, and nicely done chicken. The chaap served along with it was very spicy, and counterbalanced the Biryani nicely. We got a piece from the chicken breast, and we found it slightly stringy but still very good. The thums ups were chilled and helped get everything down pretty well.

New Aliah is a place I generally go back to from time to time. its not very posh, but it does make one of the best biryanis I have had in Kolkata. The biryani is light, moist, and very tasty, and comes with a soft potato and a perfectly hard-cooked egg, and soft mutton, with a texture that is not absolutely soft or very tough - just right. During Ramadan, they make mutton and chicken haleem which is tasty, although not the best in the town. I love the chaap, which is drier than most other places, and the meat is slightly drier, but also very addictive, going best with rumali rotis. The service is quick, brisk and friendly, and the decor is nice, especially in the AC section.

A surprising mughlai experience at ALIAH HOTEL!
========================================================================
Brief:

I had planned to visit with my brother to the top restaurant they have opened. I was very surprised to see that they have worked so greatly on the ambience. The ac was soothing. The place was neat and clean. The staffs were much more courteous and it was definitely giving a restaurant feeling. When it comes to biriyani, Aliah is one of my very old favorite. The best part about the biriyani is the tender aloo and the 'essence' of saffron and other masalas which always gives an appropriate touch to the nose. The chicken also has appropriate amount of masalas. The best part is the biriyani does not have a lot of oil.
========================================================================
Food:

Ordered:

1) Chicken Biriyani - As it is a restaurant, the prices were definitely more. The biriyani costed 144 bucks. However, what was surprising to see that they had added egg as an add on for the biriyani. It was surprising for a second because i have never seen Aliah using egg. From the chicken to the potato, all were pretty well cooked. The biriyani out here can not be missed at any COST. One must try it.

2) Firni - This is my favorite out here. The orange colour firni having a little sweet flavour is mouth melting. Served cold to me and was very much enjoyable.

If you are looking for two unique and definitely favorite items, these are the signatures. I was very happy and satisfied with the food.
========================================================================
Service:

The staffs were courteous. As we were carrying our bags, it was very kind of the staffs to take our bags and help us get more space on the table. Much surprised this time.
========================================================================
Summary:

Food presentation 4/5
Food quality 4.5/5
Service 5/5
Hygiene 5/5
VFM 5/5
Taste 5.5/5 ( The biriyani and the firni here my god. If you have not tried this, you have missed something in life. Seriously. A very unique preparation of Firni)
========================================================================
Pros:

1) Crowded everytime.
2) Essence of the biriyani on the streets catches the people's mind.
3) Prompt service
4) Courteous staffs
5) Value for money - Pretty reasonable
6) Unique preparation of Firni. You won't get it anywhere.
7) Biriyani is prepared on less oil. Probably, everyone was searching for less oil. This is the place.
8) Opening a restaurant that too a lovely one is an add on.
9) Ambience of the above restaurant is good. However, below is for fast eaters. It's very okay types.

Cons:-
1) Very rarely the Biriyani gets served Cold. I have probably had so much out here. It's one of my favorite Biriyani joint.
========================================================================
Conclusion:

If you haven't tried this, you have missed something in life. That's all i can say. :) Mughlai at it's best. Very happy to see zomato out here and they are getting updated with the club solitaire system.

Location: Aliah is situated near the amber hotel or basically between Esplanade and Chandni chowk metro station. Opposite to kanha.

Serves: Aliah is a very old restaurant and previously it never had the first floor AC section which they built recently. They best part about Aliah is the biriyani they serve at lighting fast speed. The chicken and mutton biriyani is at its best at Aliah. It has a very less oil content and one gets the essence of biriyani just from outside the hotel. They serve kababs also personally never tried but it feels ok they take time to prepare.
Even after accommodating so many people, it is always full and a very busy hotel. People give huge parcels for its speciality biriyani. The mughlai rizala and roti is pretty good. But as all mughlai dishes are oily, same goes with Aliah

Pros: 1) One of the best biriyani prepared with less oil and perfect essence with no added flavours.
2) the orange firni they prepare I haven't had in my life anywhere. And it's one of the most tastiest dishes.
3) chicken rizala and mutton champ and roti are pretty ok
4) cheap and very reasonable

Cons:1) proper hygiene is not maintained at the ground floor.

Visited the place after a long time. This time opted for the take-away service. I had ordered for the following:
1.Mutton Biriyani- pretty decent with extra long grains of basmati rice that had just the right amount of flavour,spices and oil.The dish had managed to strike a right balance of all three parameters.The piece of mutton was also soft and well-boiled.So far so good.
2.Chicken Bharta- No brainer dish which contained shredded pieces of chicken in a thick yellowish gravy.A  tiny slice of boiled egg on top of the gravy made for a nice presentation. But i found the taste to be quite mediocre.Using liberal amounts of dhania leaf  in the curry perhaps ruined the taste of the dish.
3.Mutton Korma- And old favourite of mine and one of the few dishes the joint is famous for.The gravy was flavorsome not too spicy or oily.The pieces of mutton-two small ones at that were soft and succulent.Decent enough.
Other recommended dishes are the murgh musallam-it takes some amount of time to prepare though-perhaps advance order should do the trick,the staple tandoori chicken and mutton tikia.
If one wishes to have Mughlai food in the Central Business District(CBD) part of Kolkata then this should be one's go to option apart from Alibaba at Dalhousie area.I would say that this joint is kind of under rated as compared to other high profile Mughlai joints in the Park Circus area.



----- 18 May, 2013 -----

This joint is one of those typical heritage Mughlai joints of Kolkata.Meant for people who love their food and not too particular about ambiance,hygiene,waiter behaviour and diet conscious.The menu is limited but the dishes are pretty decent and tasty.Their biriyani is very good and unique in taste.It would not be fair to compare the biriyani to say Arsalan or Alibaba for that matter. This joint is one of the rare places that serve Mutton tikia(minced meat chops in thick gravy for the uninitiated) and does a pretty decent job at it.Other recommended items are chicken bharta and the ever yummy mutton rezala( stew for the westernised lot).They have two sections-one non-ac and the other AC.Families should opt for the AC section on the first floor.It is less chaotic and cleaner, though prices are higher.Their take-away service has a separate section and is efficient.Waiters are a rude and arrogant lot.Would rate it 3.5 solely for the food and nothing else.

People can have their Arsalans, they can have their Shirazs and certainly their Aminias.

But if you can rise above the rhetoric around these places, Aliah near Chowringhee could well win your biryani-craving heart with its version. May be I missed out the best phases of the places mentioned earlier, as I sampled their food all in the last 10 years and not before. But they have been no match for what you get at Aliah. And, this has been a love affair for over a decade. 

No matter what else is, this is always on my list when I visit home. The fragrant, light biryani apart (none of the other three's comes even close), there is haleem during Ramadan, their chaanp and stew are lip-smacking. You could also wipe your plate clean with fluffy rotis as well.

Albeit, the gravy dishes will have noticeable oil, but then Mughlai curries will have that no matter what, even Kareem's has oil slicks. But the biryani is the the litmus test, and Kolkata's best is to be found in Aliah.

Personally I think they serve the best biryani in town‚Ä¶a tad more expensive than its competitors but worth it in my opinion‚Ä¶.

Though review is based on my last visit it also encompasses my general opinon of the place since I have been a regular for more than 2 decades‚Ä¶

Visited on a Thursday so the mutton menu was limited‚Ä¶Opted for a  chicken biryani,mutton kassa and a Tandoori Roti‚Ä¶

The tandoori roti was soft and fluffy..‚Ä¶the mutton kassa was very flavourful,spiced just right‚Ä¶the mutton was really tender and did not taste gamey at all‚Ä¶.and then the chicken biryani‚Ä¶still amazing after all these years‚Ä¶reminded me why I keep coming back after all these years‚Ä¶

Though I did not have it this time,the murgh mussalam is definitely another must have‚Ä¶

Food:9/10
 Service: 6/10
 Decor and ambience: 3/10

Aliah is rather an old joint - however I started frequenting this place more (during lunch hours) from the time that I took up work nearby. It is an unpretentious place - maybe they could have refurbished and renovated the place but well, they chose not to do so.
In the Dalhousie area, I rate Aliah as the second best place to have biryani after Only Alibaba. I have also tried out their Chanp, Tikka and the Naans ‚Äì they are fine. If you are in the Central business district and looking for cost effective Mughlai options, Aliah is the place that you must visit.

I came to know of this place only recently and I wondered after tasting the Biriyani, Why didn't I come across them earlier? After a few visits though,I have realised good things happen in their own time. 
I absolutely love the Mutton Biriyani over here, soft mutton pieces,the spices evenly distributed, the rice is perfect : neither dry nor oily..its beautiful. I combine it with the chap generally.the meat pieces might be hard sometimes but the gravy is delightfully thick coarsy consistency-not creamy,but rich- goes well with the paratha and rumali roti too.
I have a craving for sweet after a sumptuous meal, and tried the firni the first time I was here.This is the only thing I disliked, it was more like thick payesh.
The downstairs section has no decor or ambience to speak off ; the service is prompt,It is amusing to see the kind of mixed crowd it attracts. A must go for the biriyani.

I have never been to the outlet but always enjoyed packing from this restaurant...

The place is pretty close to paradise cinema.. I always opt for the biryanis of the hangout as I feel its the best in kolkata..
My order in the recent visit consisted of  chiken kasha n chicken biryani.. 
The biryani was great it did nt taste of Dalda  which many of the other restaurants add into the biryani... The taste was just amazing and better than arsalan,aminia n nizams... its exceptionally good.. Biryani was not bland had a bit of spices which I relish .. I really did not require anything with the biryani as it had adequate amount of moisture to it... Though Chicken Kasha was an added advantage to go with the biryani.. IN short i had a tasteful dinner... The place has never disappointed me..

Aliah is located in the heart of the markets and offices of Dalhousie, Chandni Chowk and Bentinck Street. The most outstanding dish that they serve is the "Murgh Musallam" and one has to preorder it and wait a while before being served. The restaurant is pretty much in the mould of Aminia and serves very good Biriyani and Chaanp. You will also get a mean Mutton Tikiya- juicy, tasty and spicy which goes very well with Tandoori Rotis. You can get the roti a little "kadak" to get the real taste of the tikiya exploding in the mouth. The Murgh Musallam needs a lot of attention and care while eating and it is best to go there in a mid-size group of 5/6 people to have a full spread and enjoy.

Aliah has long established them as a famous food joint specially in the Esplanade and Chandni area. The area in which it has been serving for so long is a buzzing place in the city. You have to serve good exotic food to the office goers and to the businessmen who never compromises on quality. 
The first thing which comes to my mind when Aliah is talked about is the chap. Both the mutton and the chicken chap are equally brilliant when had with Indian bread. Though I prefer more the mutton to the chicken as I am more inclined to the red meat. Haleem which is prepared during the Ramdaan time is also delicious though there are joints which serves better. The biriyani here is quite light and thus it is not my personal favorite. Kebabs are decent. The competitive advantage which Aliah has is they have real swift waiters. The ambiance in the non AC section is not great as you would find a lot of buzz as it remains crowded throughout the day.

Been there done that.

This particular joint is known for its biryani and chaap. Both of which are exuding great fragrance and pulling up a huge crowd every single day. Aliah is in close quarters to the office para and hence a large number of the crowd are office goers eatng their sumptuous mean at tad affordable price. They keep in mind that because people eat here at almost a regular basis , the prices need to be affordable and thats the mantra for their huge popularity.

I love their chicken biryani and chicken chaap.
Yes, very rich indeed, the chaap is mesmerizing. But yes, a hajmola after the meal please! :D

The biryani is light and tasted really good. One thing which I really miss is the egg in the biryani :(

The sections dowstairs dsnt have an ac but yes do climb upstairs if you nee dto beat the heat.
At a tad affordable price, Aliah gives you the best!

Happy eating guys
Cheers! :)

It was an old time favorite for many, before the era of Arsalans, Zeeshans and Shiraz located right in the heart of the office-para. I went there many times with my father when I was in school. ‚ÄòNew Aliah‚Äô is located between Esplanade and Chandni Chowk metro, near Paradise cinema hall. I went there yesterday with my friend (Dipak). As usual we ordered Mutton Biryani & Mutton Keema they serve the typical oily yellow colored rice which goes by the name of Biryani. It tastes OK but there is nothing special to write home about. The side dish was even worse. In mutton biryani I found less mutton and more bone. The quantity was very less compared to any restaurant. Also do not expect a good ambiance, service or hospitality. In short, those who know what real Biryani should taste and smell like should look elsewhere. Banarasi Pan from the opposite Pan stall taste far better than the Biryani.

Haleem Walk 12/07/2015 [Revised Rating 2.5 to 3.5]

After enjoying food at Royal Indian Hotel, we again walked almost 20 mins to reach ‚ÄòNew Aliah‚Äô is located between Esplanade and Chandni Chowk metro, near Paradise cinema hall. There we enjoyed their Arbi Haleem and Tandoori roti.

Their Arbi Haleem boasts beautifully fragrant runny gravy that gives you a hug on the inside. The haleem here was not scrumptious like the previous one but a bit dense and spicy which haleem‚Äôs natural quality is.

After an afternoon full appetite, we took a taxi from esplanade and within 15 minute reached ‚ÄòYauatcha‚Äô (Quest Mall) for drinks and desserts also spent some time for digestion after a heavy lunch day out.

Food Tips - one important tip for all haleem lovers in Kolkata that this dish available only after 2 - 2:30 PM, so if you planning your haleem walk, planned it in late afternoon only.

My grand parents lived in the area so we have been frequenting this establishment for years now. Honestly my earliest memory is the Halim that they make during Ramzan and it was parceled and got home regularly and its a flavor that remains and lingers on my taste buds. Those of you who have not sampled it put it on your list for sure. Their biryani is pretty good as well .... rice perfectly cooked , the potato well done (I dislike a very hard potato in my biryani) and the mutton properly cooked. The chicken chaap and mutton chaap both are good when paired with the roti . They make a pretty yummy Tandoori Chicken ...  perfectly prepared ... moist and tender inside and smoky and a bit charred outside .... just perfect. Prices are decent and the AC section upstairs is suitable for family groups.

Its a place where all kinds of ppl visit, from families to office groups (during office hours).
Its having an A/C floor now (the original ground floor part is still not air-conditioned though) n possesses all the charms of an 'conventional mughlai restaurant' belonging to CBD (central business district) area, Kolkata.
Food is up to the mark and price is the cheapest comparing to any real mughlai restaurant in the city.
I used to visit frequently during maah lunch breaks from work.

chicken biryani and chicken rizala  is the only thing you will like it. mutton chap and roti are pretty ok..a pocket friendly, yet tasty, with less quantity , During Ramazan, they serve some of the best Haleem, situated at the central Kolkata right in the Bentinck street. One of the oldest mughlai restaurant in Kolkata.

Very goos mutton stew and quorma, biryani and other moglai dishes are okay too. But, their speciality is Halim, wonderful, rich spicy yet fine. A superb experience. Their biryani is also very much hyped, though I did not find them in the first three in Kolkata. But, altogether, this place is nice in terms of food quality, not in terms of service or ambience, though service and ambience are not too bad, rather above average.

New Aliah is located between Esplanade and Chandni Chowk metro. Basically famous for its Mughalai cuisine, again a place not very recommended for the vegetarians. The restaurant is very old and have been serving the people of Kolkata for long. 

Food: I had Paneer Butter Masala on recommendation of one of my friends as it is one of their specialities. The quantity was very less compared to any restaurant and it was very oily. In bread, I had Butter Nan and Laccha Paratha. I dont know why they call it butter nan because you wont find any butter and it was too thick. Overall the experience in terms of food was not quite good.

Ambiance:  is good, nothing extra ordinary.

Service: was really poor. The waiter behaved rudely and seriously it spoils your mood.

Pricing was reasonable.

Overall a BAD experience. Not going to visit again.

Location : Business hub of the city. Right in the middle of the hundreds of offices in and around the area. Beside a very popular cinema hall 4/5
Transport : Could not be any better. Metro a 2 minute walk away. A plethora of buses at your disposal. Busy street which remains chaotic throughout the day. 4.5/5
Food : The legacy of the hotel precedes it. In operation for many decades, this restaurant has served millions of people over the years. The specialty of this place is its biryani and firni, which in my opinion is the best in the city. The biryani is one of the lightest and hence, does not cause too many side effects. The firni, currently priced at Rs 35 may be a bit on the costlier side, but it is definitely worth it. The biryani is pretty decent and people visiting should try out the Mutton Stew. Be warned, it is not a stew, rather it is served with quite a heavy gravy but it is delightfully tasty. 4/5
Ambiance : Choked during office lunch hours, a peaceful meal here is out of the question. The air conditioned restaurant may provide respite during summers, yet it is always filled with people moving around in a small space. 2.5/5
Service : Leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe they do not have the patience to treat college students well, or they may be busy serving office workers hoping for a good tip.  3/5

Was an old time favorite for many, before the era of Arsalans, Zeeshans and Shiraz, located right in the heart of the office-para.
Large glass windows with a view of the old grand structures of the locality. 
Ambiance is fine.
But the food is average. 

The waiter was partially rude, and partially stupid enough not to understand simple instructions like " I want a glass of water. "
We had to write our order, elaborately on the white napkins, and even after all this he made a mistake, and we were forced to take a dish that we DID NOT order. And, surprisingly, it was him who was complaining after all this. 

MUTTON BIRYANI:  Not great value for money because of the midget sized quantity. 
CHICKEN CHAAP: Tasted fine, with generous pieces of meat.
LACHHA PARATHA:  Thick and heavy with well spread butter.
FIRNI: Not bad.

You can get better Mughlai dishes at the Arsalans and Zeeshans. But still worth a try,  for old times' sake.

I went there with my office colleagues, we choose the AC section and we were not surprised to find it almost full even on weekday and at around 3:30pm. its too crowded and chaotic as its one of the oldest and famous place. we ordered chicken and mutton and also murgh musallam. 
biryani was light and tasty, no excessive oil or anything but the chicken didn't have enough meat , it looked all bone and no meat. mutton was disappointing as well. 
The main reason we went there coz one of my colleague wanted to have murgh musallam. And the less we talk about it , the better it is.
firstly It didn't look like musallam neither it tasted Like that. it was more like  chicken butter Masala.
lastly firni which was OK, nothing great about it.
I might go there in future but not willingly.

Was always reluctant in visiting this place as i found it quite noisy and sometimes dirty, but couldn't fight the urge and the aroma of their biryani when passing from there so went Upstairs. Well, the Family section has just been made upstairs and the job done is good. The ambiance upstairs is a lot better than what you find at the section below.

Coming to the food, Aliah has a very limited variety as compared to other Mughal Restaurants but the taste and the quality of the food will not let you down.
Starting with the Biryani, their biryani is something one cannot resist and trust me friends it's just too delicious. Right amount of spices and the perfect taste.
Next i ordered, one of my favorite on the menu, Chicken Kassa, which again was as per my liking.

One thing i did not like and would like all my friend to know is that some Delicacies are not available on daily basis and are available only once a week. For Example I was told that Chicken kassa was available only on Thursdays, which I found quite strange.

Coming to the pricing, I would like to admit that given the quality and taste, the price is in fact on the lower side.

So Finally i would like to rate it 3.5. It could have been a 4.5 had there been a bit more variety.

I just love New Aliah, I ahve been eating there for the last decade or so and been more or less targeting 'Mutton Stew' with Roti.Its been my staple there . And you bet , New Aliah never fails me .I am  fan  of their  'Mutton Stew'  and can bet on the fact that no one can cook mutton better than them .
New Aliah also serves the other regular Mughalaia fare such as Biryani/firni/tikia etc.But its the 'Mutton Stew' that just takes the steam out of the rest.Long live .
Ambience is that of a classical Mughalaai restauarnt of Kolkata . table , old hands as waiters. Polite and helpful if u are the same to them . An the location of being just in the middle of the CBD make this place v accessible too.

We opted aliah for a lunch at one of the afternoons in my college life. We were three and since our pockets were not that heavy, we entered into aliah and found it realy reasonble, you could call it cheap as well. We ordered chicken bharta and rumali roti. Yes the ambiance is noisy and the tables are not that clean but it is a good option when your wallet is not healthier. They serve good food with quality and taste.

Hey Guys!

This was the restaurant where I was introduced to real 'Biryani' by my dad 20yrs back when my age was in single digits.

I am rating this place just because of the food.

If you want to try 'Biryani' but not just any Pulao or Masala Rice be there! Trust me!

All you need to order when you occupy the seats is "Biryani", then you can opt for Chaps, Stews or rezallas to suit your taste.

I am telling you if you haven't tried them out yet, you have no right to judge on a 'Biryani'.

Its kinda old fashioned food joint, so please do not expect the staff to be posh and address you as 'Bonjour' !!

Hope you would thank me while stepping out from there!

I just cannot (or rather don't want to) compare Arsalan and Aliah! If I am born out of Biryanis then they are my 'Parents'.

Wish they were at Delhi! Would have flushed out Karims. 
I just miss them! Slruuuuppppp!

I am very much addicted to biriyani from my childhood days,,i have gone through various resto like aminia,royal,zeeshan,arsalan,shiraz but last year after having biriyani from aliah --i can surely termed it as the best biriyani resto in kolkata --there is absolutely no doubt that aliah is the best as of now if it comes to biriyani @ kolkata...Biriyani & kababs are the speciality dishes@ aliah. U may find that the ambiance & the atmostphr of aliah is not that much attractive but the preparation of biriyani is mouthwatering & awsome. If it comes to biriyani & kababs i will give it 5out of 5 but for the ambiance & atmosphere i am giving it 4.5

aliah's biriyani is lighter than its counterparts from shiraz or aminia. also, the quantity is no doubt good. also, try their chicken chap. check out their haleem which they serve during the ramzaan period. i didn't like their kabab. but definitely go for their mutton tikia.

The ambience is really good if you choose the family dining.

With cosy seats and large enough space the mood is really soothing.

Now coming to the main part FOOD

I heard their biriyani was comparable to arsalan, but being an arsalan regular i feel New Aliah's biriyani is quite low on biriyani. The chicken piece along with it was not upto the mark. But although i would say their firni was quite good and Special mention is the mutton qorma(It felt home).

Finally a small story:
Being engrossed in conversation i left my Biriyani cold. The waiter who served upon us came forward and requested to heat up the biriyani once again.
This act earned him my respect and thus i would give him and the restuarant a +1 rating.

Kolkatans are known to be an argumentative lot. They debate about a lot of things, and one thing which riles them more often than not, is Biryani. People have a lot of favourites in Kolkata, whether its the Arsalan addicts, the Shiraz gourmets or the swear-by-Zeeshan's. And just like the others, New Aliah sure has its own dedicated clientele, who swear by the biryani and chaap here.

Situated in the office-para, Bentinck Street, New Aliah Hotel & Caterer is very very popular around Central Kolkata. Their biryani may not get the same hype as an Arsalan, but trust me, its as good as any of its competitors. They've been around for quite a while, and somehow know exactly the kind of food which'll appeal to its clientele. They might use a little bit of dalda, but most people love it!

During Ramazan, they serve some of the best Haleem in the city. So do check out the place once during that period.

If you want to taste the real mutton chaap... this is the place. Although the Dalda sometimes irritate you still the taste is way to better than Shiraz or Arsalan.

When i heard about this place from a friend i had no idea that their biriyani and chaap will make me lick my fingers. Had no expectation at the time of ordering but  to my surprise the food turned out to be excellent. Their biryani has the perfect balance of spices and is not oily. Quality of rice is also good .Mutton chaps are succulent and spicy yet  very tasty.Dont know about the ambience as we got the food delivered.Giving it 4 stars only for their lip smacking chaap and biriyani.

Rating purely on the basis if food and nothing else, my family genuinely enjoys their Biriyani, Chaanp and Parathas on Eid. Since we get them delivered I have no idea of the ambiance and decor and service of the restaurant. The food however is delicious. The meat portions are generous and juicy, the rice used in the Biriyani is A grade and the overall prep is not greasy at all yet finely balanced, and the parathas are soft and flaky.
Give it a shot guys who genuinely love good food and not the external showbaazis.
