On a friday afternoon with no mood to cook logged into swiggy and ordered from this new place bhook pitaara . The ALOO PARATHA IS EUPHORIA.  Awesome fillings and thick Punjabi style parathas ... anyday better than paratgewali gali and total value for money. also ordered their poori sabji yesterday and the pooris were huge and light 6 OF THEM. With a load full of aloo sabji. cant wait to try more of their food!!

Amazing food they deliver. Very nicely packed and looks good. Ordered Aloo Parathe and Cheese Parathe and they were simply delicious. Delivery time was also short.
