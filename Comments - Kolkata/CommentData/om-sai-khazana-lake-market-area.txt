The food here is just bad. I had ordered for home delivery months back and food was on time. Nothing from this place tasted good or even mediocre. The prices were cheap(one of my primarily reasons for order). If you avoid this place you are not losing out

I had been eating here for a long time mostly because my grandmother trusts them and orders from here.

I just had their food two days back, told them how bad it was, I thought they would heed it.

I ordered again tonight. I wouldn't call it food. There was potato in my Chinese Lemon Chicken, the Handi Chicken had a cornflower coating and the chicken in the fried rice was as hard as cardboard. So please, never order from here.

Don't even bother to walk in to this place if you are looking for good food. I was once a fan of this restaurant... Let me remind you ..once upon a time it was a great place for Chinese cuisine at reasonable price.
Now... The chicken mushroom soup- it was ok tastewise.they got the right consistency..but on the high salt side
The chilli chicken- the salt and sugar was not properly dissolved and you could feel it in your mouth... The chicken was not even fresh.
The chicken fried rice- It was edible and tasty ..but needed a bit more salt.
So what was once a really nice place with clean,warm decor and good food is now only decor with no good food. Heavily disappointed with this place.

This restaurant is located very close to the Lake Market.Its a very small place with a seating capacity of around 15 people. Seats are not very comfortable with only chairs and no sofas. However, considering the size and appearance of the place the food here is much better than expectations. The chicken sweet corn soup ordered was absolutely delicious and was loaded with small pieces of chicken...the starter order along with it.. the chiken keema ball slightly disappointed specially after the delicious soup. Overall, a very pocket friendly place with good value for money experience and decent food.

with the change of ownership,what once used to be bustling food jointÂ  has now become a nightmare. previously they used to serve good food at pretty reasonable price but now the food has degraded immensely both in terms of quantity and quality. what was previously enough for two now hardly is sufficient for a single person also. definitely a place to be avoided.

Ohhh please.. I will prefer to die without food than visiting this place for a second time. On my friend's insist i decided to give this place a try but believe me, this is one of the ( no..!! Wait.. The most ) third class place i have ever visited. I really donot want to rate it even 1 but i cant help it as this is the ultimate genorisity i can do to this place. We ordered pan fried momo, chili chicken, fish manchurian and fried rice and guess what!! All tasted the same. There wasn't a bit difference in any taste. I was shocked at the extent of their bad cooking. The fish was not fresh and the chicken hard. And added to that i felt a stomach ache the very next day. So please, even if u r hungry dont try this place. U will be experiencing the worst

The eatery was small, and the food quantity is also not sufficient for it's price. The service is also not upto date. We have Chinese cuisine of chowmien, fried rice chilli fish and manchurian chicken. They bring the dishes one after another with a gap of time and outstandingly they forgot to served the fried rice. It is good for home delivery but not as a restaurant.

One of the most third class restros I ever went...I went with one of my friends before a month and we ordered crispy chicken as starter . ...n u won't believe they served us "crispy" chicken in a greavy form....n it tested yaak qnd full of red chilli pest....our eyes were wet..... ....our first bite were our last too....we canceled the main course order and paid for that dirty starter and left.....so I won't recommend anyone to go there ...even if you r on a tight budget it shouldn't be ur choice. ...its better to go for street food even. ...

I liked the taste and pricing of this restaurant. One should really try the chrispy chicken. The fish finger also has a different taste. I am a frequent visitor of this place. We have arranged a gettogether at there place also. They have provided us the entire 1stfloor for the occation.
