A much awaited visit. It's a restaurant outlet under the hotel itself. No issue regarding the interior and ambience. Quite peaceful and spacious. The only thing that hampers it's Beauty is the placing of the water filter which need to be shifted. Tried north indian here and this comes under affordable option. Quality is average , may be they are not that much good on this  cuisine type. Overall a place under affordable price.

All- fresco is really good. The continental is really good. The decor is mind boggling. We visit this place at least once in every month. Highly recommended
