The food is awesome here specially the kababs. The tangri kabab is my all time favourite here. Trust me its better than lot of other renowned outlets. I have also tasted few other items and found them equally good. Price is not that high and I bet we food lovers would love to pay a little more for quality. Keep up the good work Tasty Bites...!!!

Great food comes at reasonable price. They are on the positive side as far as hygiene is considered. Steamed Momo, Pan friend Momo are hits . The quantity of stuffing and taste gives tough fight to other reknowned brands. Their fried rice too comes in great quantity as well as taste. Tried tandoori roti and. Chicken bharta lately and must say they are as good as any dhaba.Prompt service and great hospitality.

Being a foodie, I love to try food. I have first tasted tangri kebab in my friend's place. The taste was awesome. I have tried almost all kebabs. Just fantastic. The size is bigger than any other food corners. The price is cheap too. The other items are also very tasty and good in quantity. I have become addicted to tasty bites' food. Maintain this quality and quantity.

This place is located exactly at Bakultala Bus Stand, Kasba and its a take away counter. It has been a hidden gem for me once I have tasted their food. It serves delicious rolls and different kinds of kebabs. Chicken Tandoori is a must try.

I would recommend people to try Chicken Tikka Butter Masala along with Butter Naan. Its simply heaven. I have rated this food joint just because of its lip smacking food quality. People can also their Chinese cuisine's and varieties of Momo's.

My suggestions for this food joint would be to take their effort to serve good food to people for a longer period.

The little new addition to the ever increasing fast food centres in Kasba. The prices are a tad lower than feast and so is the quality. But the quantity is nice. The chinese combo is more than enough for one. Looking forward to try the biriyani. Did try the momo recently, it was divine.

This outlet is located close to my place and since I had read great reviews especially about thier Momo I wanted to try it out.

I want there yesterday and wanted to try Momo and Chicken Moghlai.However,their Roll and Moghlai were not functional.

So,I packed a plate of Steamed Chicken Momo to try out at home.

There were 6 pieces of momo along with Soup and Sauce.Firstly,the Soup was packed in a normal poly bag which was a big turn off from a hygeine perspective.However,the momos had a nice and well balanced amount of Chicken filling.There was a nice bite and crunch of the onions but I felt it could have been a little softer.But the soup was tasteless with only a few shreds of vegetables and the sauce was not spicy.Infact,it was on the sweeter side which I didn't appreciate at all.The pricing is attractive at INR 60.

I will be drawing few comparisons over here , I consider myself as a Momo Lover ever since I first tasted one long long ago. Since then I had one favourite place for momos , the West Bengal Sikkim border , RongPo , the momo they make at the shops at the border are straight from heaven , but trust me , and mark my words when I first placed a bite on the chicken momo from " The Tasty Bites " , that heavenly feeling rushed back in. Amazing food , reasonable price l. Though till now I Only had the momo , would love to explore other options as well on my next visit.

I went there for the first time today, and have chicken Momo at first... Till yesterday tebatean delight, Rabindra sadan was favourite...for Momo's but trust me the taste of the tasty bites Momo... Is far better than any other outlets Momo by far. Be it by quantity, be it by hygiene be it by taste... It's awesome...

Then I have taken a tengry kabab... now I know that the taste will be excellent so I became a bit sceptical about the cooking... In most of the restaurants they don't cook the tengry properly and reddish fluid kind of thing seen while eating the upper portion of the tengry... But here  though there is fair amount of rush in the shop but  the cooking is perfectly ok... And it tastes heavenly with pudina chutney...

As I was full and  not so much selfish, so decided to pack chicken reshmi kabab for my better half... (Though I have consumed most of it)... Even after odd 1.5 hours... The kababs are tenderly soft and it is actually melted in our taste buds...My wife is not at all believing that it is from a take away counter's kabab at such a low price...

In my next visit :: :: ::
Stick chicken... Meyones chicken roll is in my list... Whenever I am visiting THE TASTY BITES....

On enquiring I found out that the owners takes a specific kind of coal which helps to cook kabab in better way. They use branded companies meyones and cheese for cooking and they use same companies oil which I use in my home.... Thank you for the hygiene and quality..

Sorry as I am unable to post any pic as I was so busy enjoying the food I forgot to take one. I will do it on my next visit

SUGGESTIONS TO THE OWNER ::::::::::::::
1. Please open an outlet in BEHALA so that I can order more frequently.
2. Have some dine in place so that we can enjoy your warm hospitality.
3. Please don't compromise on quality and quantity when your take away becomes more popular.

Thank you..

Located in Bakultal,this new shop is a tough fight for the renowned momo shops and especially if you are a momo lover this place is a must visit. They serve momos with double the stuffing that you expect and the soup contains small cubes of Chicken too,there you get a lot of CHICKEN in your plate of CHICKEN Momo (steamed) just @55/- And the chutney is also very fresh and tasty unlike the more water and less chutney ones.
Have visited this place twice and have tried the pan fried momo and steamed momo. Will be surely visiting again and if you are a Momo Lover just do not miss the chance of visiting this place I tell you as you will be at the loosing end :) would have been more better if they would have arranged for proper seats.
Surely visiting this place again.

Use coupon code: SFOODS and get Rs 75 off on your next Zomato online order(card/online payment)

Have paid 2 visits and not too tough to locate since it's in my locality. Near Bakultala bus stand, where a eatery named 'Hanglas' was located, happy that this shop opened.

*Update*Chicken Handi(6/10): Rs 260 for 10 pieces. Small boneless chicken pieces. Gravy is very light and tastes just above average.

*a week  older*
Egg Roll(5/10): On my last visit(last week), it was Rs 20, and was just okay in taste and quality. Quantity should fill you well. May be the very next day, the price went up to Rs 30, which isn't the right price for what they're serving.

Chicken Fried Rice(7/10): Expected a bit more chunks of chicken. Quantity is very good, tastes really good. This can be enough for 2 if you got starters and sides. The aroma in the rice is bud-soothing.

Chicken Biryani(8/10): This stuff is brilliant and is pretty close to the quality of good restaurant at just Rs 90(or 100 don't remember). The aromatic rice is delicious and the piece of chicken is well cooked and tender. A must try for foodies.

Chilli Chicken(7/10): 8 pcs for Rs 130. Tastes just above decent, pieces are sized average and has quite an amount of batter to make it look big.

Chicken Tandoori(6/10): 2 pieces for 140. Considering the amount of chicken and the taste, it's just an average item. I guess they used a chicken who had been dieting before getting cooked.

The Quality is very good as they have promised! The Oil they used for every Cooking is Safola Gold refine Oil..which is atleast good for health than other FastFood Corners uses! Though they does not have any Sitting Arrangement rather than some Chairs placed outside bt they do have HomeDelivery...and Overall I would like to Rate 9.5/10.. üëç

My 4th visit and every time I was amazed by this place. No matter what we ordered, they did great justice to their name and served really tasty food. But their Biriyani, Rolls, Stick Chicken deserves special mention. Probably the best rolls I've had in the city.
Very friendly & well behaved people, & it was great to see that they give so much importance to the quality of food, specially when I found out that they only use white oil (which too of a premium brand)
In short, Great Taste -- Quality Food -- Friendly People

I took pan fried chicken, chicken biryani  and a chicken roll. Pan fried chicken was delicious. It was worth the price. 8pcs chicken for 150 was worth it. Biryani however was average. Chicken  Roll  was also good. So worth trying.
