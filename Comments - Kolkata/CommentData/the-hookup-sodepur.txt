This is the first of its kind cafe in Sodpur and nearby suburbs ,which serves continental delicacies .Run by a bunch of young entrepreneurs,this place has nicely lit decor and ambience..apt to hang out with your friends.I had pasta,baked fish and fries which I would rate at par with any Kolkata cafe.Hope this trend catches up with young folks in and around suburbs.

PORK in Sodepur üòç The most exciting news for a pork lover. Obviously you can guess I will surely visit that place and it was this place 'The Hookup'. As soon as I entered,the ambience felt perfect. The seating arrangement was cozy and comfortable. There was music playing in the background and everything felt as it should be. The we ordered the obvious but very special dish 'Chilly Pork' (150/-). The wait time was ok, once the dish was served,it looked yummy. And it tasted yummy too. The dish was awesome in terms of taste, aroma, the meat perfectly cooked,the amount and the price, everything was perfect.
Next we ordered 'Calaamari'. But it was not available and the boy said,'Madam we just opened 2months back, so it will be available slowly.' Then we asked for 'Prawn Chips' and the same reply. Then we ordered Corn cheese balls (120RS), after sometime he came and asked me to take corn cheese finger instead,it was ok,I asked the price, he said same. Again after sometime he came and said he will make Nuggets instead but didn't mention price so we thought it will be same.But during billing we saw it was 130/-. It is ok, but he should mention the price when he is changing the order from his end. So finally we had our "Corn cheese nuggets". It was tasty, the size could have been little more bigger but it was worth the price.
Overall the primary reason behind going to a place to eat is to eat delicious food and they met that expectation. Also in terms of ambience,it was awesome. Just few things they can improve,
1. Communication
You should not say that you guys opened new, customer will order dishes from the menu. If you can't make that now, don't keep it in the menu, add it when you are capable enough to provide it.
Mention the Price of the dish if you change it from your end to keep transparency with the customer.
2. Be more prompt
The guy took long time to add and write just 2 items while billing and.also the way of taking was too unprofessional.
3. Start taking card payments
This generation normally pays with cards, so if you don't accept cards and also don't have change for just 500/- then it's gonna be trouble for people to pay you chillers like paying for bus/auto.

Overall you guys are doing great in terms of food,just improve more. Greet customers with a smile. It's a good place. I definitely recommend this, especially in an area where there are no restaurants that serves porküòâ

Sodepur lacks of good hangout places this is surely a good invention to it.Me and my boyfriend went there yesterday.We tried non veg club sandwich which was too good,chicken momo surely can compete with other reknowned places and nooddles a small dissapointment for the noodles.Nyce decor and Will visit again.

31 st evening it was when i called up the cafe and asked whether they are packed or not. The guy ovee the phone said it was not full.
We reached there within 30 mins and they have a very beautiful interior which is noticable.
I really liked their sitting arrangement with a big tv screen playing some rocks..
Then ordered very light food as we had a heavy lunch.
We ordered coffee latte which was amazingly strong yet sweet
Oreo shake so yummy so thick.. They made it infront of me which i liked..
Finally some chilli pork.
It came in a organic plate and it was so delicious..
Overall they are doing a great job. Its a perfect place for "lets talk over a coffee"

Poor professionalism ; we ordered pork and they ended up serving few strips of pork and loads of French fries to cover up the pork shortage ; and they didn't even inform us about this issue and we were bluffed and paid ‚Çπ150 for few strips of pork !!

The best place to hang out in our area. it's very close to Amravati more. Staffs are so well behaved and helpful. Now come to the food we ordered 
non-veg chicken pizza - far better than domino's 
cold coffee with ice cream - it's a good regular cold coffee with ice cream
chicken Momo- the Momo is good, but I must say that the soup served with the memo is too good. it's not regular clear soup the other served
 crispy chicken- spicy and crispy üòç if you love spice, then it's a must try
 last but not the least the fruit salad with ice cream. trust me that's the best fresh fruit ice cream I ever had.they serve lots of fruit including strawberry apple and kiwi with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it's soooo yum.thank you team hookup for serving us Good quality and quantity foods with such a reasonable price

This little cafe in sodepur is the new thing in our locality. Food is good and so is the ambience. We ordered chicken salad and crispy chilli baby corn,both were beyond expectations.
The neat and clean decor with the warm atmosphere were the cherry above the cake.
Great place to hang out with friends.

Though the order was delivered late, but the food was just above all expectations. I ordered greek salad, cheese corn balls and chilli garlic corn toast. It was a perfect blend of continental with indian herbs and spices. Delicious i must say. A mucu needed food joint for sodepur.

Newly open small restaura beside Hb town bazar,Sodepur. Totally upset with the food quality what they serving. As compare to locality and taste wise its expensive. Not so much option for foodies. It's like road started and suddenly end in a second. I know it's a good message to everyone as I am totally freaky about the healthy food not oily noodles very bad and taste was worst. None of the food came with decent platting need to work a lot, guys it's my advise it's high time for you guys need to maintain the food quality, portion, hygiene and pricing proper staffing common etiquette.
Many more restaurant in your local area maintaining their standard and all points which I have mentioned.

WAmazing Ambiance- Specifically the wooden block...makes you feel you are in a different place... And the Lounge- Great music with funky Ambiance.. give you party feel...
Food - Very short and sweet Menu and best Hand pick dishes from Chinese and Italian cuisine... At a reasonable price.. with taste not less than top restaurant in Kolkata...They too have a great Coffee,drinks and desert Menu
One word "Awesome"" - Probably the best place in Sodepur... To hang out! Please don't forget they also have Pool table and Arcade games for entertainment... Will definitely suggest to check it out.. I am sure you will love it.. üòäüòä‚ù§

Amazing place.... Didn't expected it to be that great... Keeping in mind other places in Sodepur! The wooden Ambience looks great Along with the Lounge they have...They have a great Menu with Italian,Chinese and coffee in their Menu.. The staff is friendly...We ordered Cappuccino (Which was great in taste) Grilled Chicken Steak Spaghetti,Pasta and Mix Noodles... Delicious is what I will like to describe...But the show stopper was The Fruit salad with Ice-Cream.. I believe it's a Haven in Sodepur.. where there is no place to hangout with Friends and family... You can Also book the place for birthday parties... A hidden Gem Indeed!
