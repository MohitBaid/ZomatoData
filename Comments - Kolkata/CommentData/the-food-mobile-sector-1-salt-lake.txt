The Food Mobile delivers a lot of happiness and satisfaction.Had ordered chicken butter masala and chicken bharta. Have to mention their Prompt delivery and courteous staffs. I wasn’t expecting such a quick delivery from you guys. Keep it up as well as the packaging was superb. Much better than the leaky oily mess. 
Well Done

They didn't even delivered the food, it's very unprofessional. People are depending on you guys to have the food delivered but instead you guys didn't even bother to give a call informing that you can't deliver it.
