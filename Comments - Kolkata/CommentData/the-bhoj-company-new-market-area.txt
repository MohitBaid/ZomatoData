Awesome food and elegant decor. I went there two times recently, we had rice, katla kalia and mutton curry the fast time, they were just delicious. The second time we ordered kachki macher chochchori, kochu pata diye chingri macher bhapa, mutton kosha and rice as usual, we didnt have time to take any pictures because we were eating the food like ravenous fools. The mutton kosha is heaven as well as the kachki mach. We also had malai kulfi, we had to order another dish of kulfi because it's was just fantabulous. Loved it. Will go there again and again.

We planned for a family outing and asked the day before if they could provide a table for seven people. The manager confirmed. Once we arrived on the day, they made big eyes when we asked for an additional chair to seat a family member at the head of the table. The starter was ok, but the main course was served with flaws. The rice was cold and some of the fish we've ordered was half raw. To our surprise, the waiter just shrug his shoulders after having pointed out the problem with the half cooked fish. So we paid up and left with a mixed feeling. It appears that this place is over run by tourists from Bangladesh and that the staff cannot concentrate on delivering good quality. We certainly would not go back there again. There are much better places to spend an evening out.

Went there with a friend who was visiting Kolkata for the first time and and we wanted to have Bengali cuisine. And we bumped into this place. Surprisingly even though it is in New market area It had nice  ambience. We ordered kochu pata chingri bhapa, pabda mach er jhol. Both were tasty. And the service was very good. The waiter was very nice and recommended us those dishes.

This restaurant is located in Mirza Ghalib Street opposite to Fire Brigade HeadQuarters. Do visit this place if you want to taste authentic Bengali food in pocket friendly rates.
This is my first time visit to this restaurant and we ordered Bengali Pulao, Jumbo Chingri Malaikari(Jumbo Prawn Curry) and Chicken Curry. Bengali Pulao was good in taste but the Jumbo Prawn curry could have been a little spicier.

One sleeps well when they eat well and that happens when you visit wonderful eating places that specializes in excellent food. I have been eating a lot of different cuisines lately that have been very impressive on it’s own way but what makes me always go back to these places or recommend it to all is for it’s unique nature the place puts out each and every time with it’s entire hospitality that one diner always looks up too. Few months ago i had posted my experience of visiting The Bhoj Company in Dalhousie and now i am back again to share a little inside stuff about it’s parent branch which is considered a legendary place in the New Market area more precisely addressed at 30, Mirza Ghalib Street, Opposite Fire Brigade Head Quarters, Kolkata, West Bengal 700016. This place is very famous and has a good record of preference by tourists living nearby as well as for the local crowd too. The Bhoj Company has established itself a great name with authentic dishes prepared in Dhakai and Bengali cuisine style over years now and they continue to do so with perfection which definitely is their charm factor.

I’m a Bangali girl, always fussing over the food I eat. At least once a day, I dislike one of my several meals through the day. At least once a day, my parents hear me saying, “Just because I don’t complain about my food, you don’t even try to cook me something nice.” So, every day, they try to cook something new. But, it’s majorly Bengali or North Indian food; in any case, if they fail at continental or Asian, they’ll hear e complaining again. So, when I go out to eat, I prefer not to eat these cuisines. But, recently, I received an invitation to The Bhoj Company, a Bengali restaurant, and words cannot be enough to describe how happy I am about keeping it!

This place is located behind the Sreeleathers shop in New Market !

The restaurant is actually a small one but the ambience is pretty good and the place has a nice feel about it ! Its mostly crowded, or so we found when we went there for a Saturday lunch !

We ordered Bengali Pulao, Dehradun Rice, Chicken kosha, mutton kosha and salad !

Both the side dishes were pretty good and quantity and price were decent !

A homely restaurant with all kinds of Bengali meals available at a moderate price !

Recommend if you are looking to have lunch after a day's shopping !

N.B. : Carry cash, not all items on the menu are covered by online payment !

I have a certain soft corner for Dhakai cuisine; don’t know why, maybe because my roots belong to that place. My grandfather migrated from Bangladesh during the partition leaving everything behind and came to settle in Calcutta amidst all the cacophony and turmoil of that period. A lot has changed since then. But for me, two things won’t ever change – the immense respect for my grandparents for the struggle which they had to face for survival and yes, of course my love for Dhakai cuisine and food which originates in Bangladesh. But in my city, there are very few places who serve Dhakai cuisine and actually out of those only a couple pleases my taste buds. But if I talk about that one restaurant which serves the best and most authentic Bangladeshi food then it has to be The Bhoj Company, not an iota of doubt about that. It was first opened up in the Free School street area and then it had recently opened up another branch in the Dalhousie office para. Today we will primarily discuss about their first branch in the city which happens to be small yet an elegant outlet, pretty tactfully built and frequented by the Bangladeshis, Europeans staying up in the Sudder Street area and the loyal local patrons.

The Bhoj Company is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata offering bengali/dhakai cuisine. This branch is near Freeschool Street, New Market (close to the fire brigade headquarters)

Being a bangali, I personally am not very fond of eating Bengali food at restaurants. However, this massive spread at The Bhoj Company was an amazing experience to say the least.

They truly focus on their food, while the interiors are basic and has muted lighting which I feel is just perfect and goes with the ambiance. 

They are all about their food and it literally shows on the plate. Come down to TBC for just the food alone and you will return back with a huge grin on your face and a small potbelly.

Coming to the food, we were served the following :

Kachki macher chorchori
Mocha chingri
Chitol macher kalia
Chitol macher muitha - my absolute favourite here.
Aar macher aloo begun bori diye jhol
Pabda macher dhone patar jhal
Chingri malai curry
Bhetki Paturi -the 'shorshe' in here will bring tears to your eyes, Order away!
Dhakai Morog Pulao - a MUST try.
Bhuna Khichuri - loved this with the muitha.
Shorshe Ilish - goes without saying, handsown amazing.
Kochu Pata Chingri Bhapa.

To end the gastronomic meal, we were offered Mishti Doi and that quite literally put me into food coma!

I would like to thank

Service - 5 / 5
Value for money - 5 / 5

I just happened to come by this place while on my quest to find a good Bengali cuisine restaurant. The place delivers good food and has no frills of any fancy decor or seating arrangements. They have their basics right in sticking to the real game-changer : Food. 

I have visited the restaurant twice so far. Orders so far:
Bengali thali - a good portion size for one person
Ileesh Maach - no words, just amazing 
Baigun bhaaja - crisp and taste on point 
Dal - simple flavours 

A good meal!

Worst food.. We ordered rice, chicken curry and prawn malai curry and the food was worst. Rice is a below standard one sticky sticky one and chicken is more than worse it was all full of bones and no chicken meat at all when we told this to the manager he told our major customers are from Bangladesh and we cook rice according to their tasty n damn sure even Bangladeshi people would not like sticky n bad quality rice... Each piece of rice seemed to be like fluffed rice (muri) n the rice was cold as well.. I would recommend not even Bangladeshi people to go to the restaurant.. Its over priced and not worth what you are paying but yes prawn malai curry was good

Quality and quantity of the rice, and mutton were good.. The mutton kasha was awesome.. But, for the chicken, the pieces were small and the taste was not that good, but, it can be eaten well.. The kulfi was good.. Bt, the malai kulfi was better than the pesta kulfi.. The price is reasonable, so it's a must to visit this place again..

Àre you looking for great bengali food with reasonable price? Then definitely this is the place for you. The restaurant is located in the same lane of Indian silk house new market. The restaurant is bit small with cute interior and is always crowded with people as its a very famous one. The food the serve there is just mouth watering and delicious and the most important part is their price, it's too reasonable.
Their kochu pata chingri bhapa and kasa maangso is a must try. Must visit here.

First of all I must mention that staffs are extremely unprofessional. They don't care about customers. We reached there for lunch and after calling so many time one staff came and took order. So no question of hospitality.. I decided to give them not more than 1. But it was food that changed my mind. We ordered rice, mug dal, kochupata chingri vapa, sorse ilish, vetki paturi, doi begun, kulfi and misti doi.
Sorse ilish tasted normal and size of ilish was good. I personally didn't like the excessive mustard flavour and oil of kochupata chingri vapa. Vetki paturi was fine but doi begun was show stealer...loved it.

Before you go through the review first get assured that you love the bangali food or not. If you are not a fond of bengali food it's not place for you. Okay now coming to review bhoj company is the ultimate place for a classic bengali lunch in new market area.
From starter to the main course and then to dessert everything is more than perfect. They used to serve those dishes are equally superb in both taste and quantity. One of those dish named "kochu pata" chingri just made my day.if you are foody those side dishes will complell you for ordering extra. Though the place is a bit short the ambience is good enough with good sitting arrangement and a classic decoration and some pleasant lights. As of service it's promt and clear but the Waiters are not that much courteous. They won't make your hungry stomach for waiting longer. Inspite of everything bhoj company is a must visiting recommended place from me.

This bengali restaurant is situated on sudder street,new market area serving bengali food at very low prices but with a drawback of no parking area over there.
The ambience is quite simple with soft Bengali songs playing. We went there little late so the place was crowded and we had to wait with limited options available. So we couldn't have what we actually wanted but we ordered Rice,Masoor dal, jhoori aloo bhaja,chicken kosha with salad.
The portion of everything was fine except for the rice means 1portion of rice is insufficient for 2person.
service was very slow and unsatisfactory. Otherwise everything was good in quality n taste. Can visit next time to taste their fish items.

Talking about food - Food is good not great but they do have a large menu to choose from. What was great was their authentic FISH FRY.  It was just too delicious and one of the best I ever had. Thus concluding that this place is a must visit for all the True Blue Bengali Food Lovers out there. 
Do try this place!!!

Visited this restaurant today to satisfy taste buds with Bengali cuisine.
Coming to food I tasted mutton kasha ,vetki paturi,kochu pata chingri bhapa along with Dehradun rice.chingri bhapa tasted absolutely delicious.you can smell the essence of mustard oil in it.Vetki paturi was a little bit bitter in taste due to excessive mustard paste in it.But vetki piece was really nice.Only mutton kasha was utter disappointment.It tasted pathetic.
Now coming to staffs they are not at all attentive but well behaved.
Although an affordable Bengali restaurant who serves good food.

At the further end of sudder street , this is a restaurant serving Bengali dishes at rather low prices.
We were too late and hence had few.... Rather very few options to choose from.
Anyway.... Just went ahead with rice,mooger daal, paabda jhaal , mochar torkari and chicken curry!
Very regular , very ordinary! 
I liked the décor , very clean and ample light!
But then again the service was pathetically slow because of the crowd!
It almost felt like a glorified 'bhater hotel' 
Good for those homesick trying to find solace in 'maach bhaat'

Love for Bengali food dragged me to this place.

Food- Basic items like Bengali tadka, fish fry & begun bhaja was not in the menu which was disappointing.

Kosha Chicken: Red coloured gravy made my mouth water instantly & it tasted good. 4 pieces of chicken were sufficient for 2 people.

Bhetki Paturi: Soft fish coated with mustard masala on the outside steamed & wrapped in a plantain leaf. This had an authentic Bengali flavour.

Masoor dal & jhuri bhaja: The portion size of dal was extremely small & jhuri bhaja was served in a generous quantity. Nothing great about these dishes although.

Bhog kichuri: This is the worst kind that I have ever had. It was more of a pulao with too much of oil presence. Nothing like kichuri & was extremely dry. It was a spoiler!

Gud(jaggery) rosugullas: Extremely soft & tasty. Must try.

Mishti doi: It tasted a little tangy & it lacked the peculiar Bengali taste. Disappointed.

Ambience: It was a small restaurant with minimal interiors. Nothing too fancy. However, it is suitable for family crowd to come over.

Hospitality: The staff was courteous & paid heed to all our orders & dishes were timely brought to our tables.

Overall experience: If food isn't great, its rarely worth paying a second visit to any such place. The authentic dishes are missing & need to be incorporated.

The Bhoj Company is the best place for authentic Bengali foods.  They serves proper Bengali homestyle food& also very well decorated .We went there to celebrate my fiance's birthday.  So we ordered plain rice ( 8 plates) , dal (2 bowls) , jhurjhure aloo bhaja , kochupata chingri , bhetki paturi ( total 7 pieces) , 1plate chitol macher jhal , 1plate chingri malaikari , 1 sorse ilish , 2 plates mutton curry & 2 plates chicken curry , 2 plates kulfi.  Our total bill was around 3500 which is very pocket friendly.  But 1 bowl rice is not sufficient for 2 person.  Foods Servings are not sufficient.  Staffs are very inattentive.

Haven't technically been to the restaurant but we ordered food from there.. for a non Bengali living in Bengal who can't speak Bengali I seem to love Bengali food a little too much..Hhahha confusing!  The food is good and reasonable. Many Bengali people rarely eat Bengali food at restaurants because they can make the same food at home. But since I have no point of reference as such, I really liked the food..simple dal, rice, aloo bhaja, Paturi maach are my favorite.. Oh and one prawn dish with a sag (don't know the name;)) over all it was a good meal on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I love zomato delivery for that!

Amazing place for good authentic Bengali food. It really blends all the uniqueness of Bengali cuisine with a nice touch of presentation and affordability. 

I ordered a bowl of plain rice, Sorse Ilish, Doi Begun, Moong Dal, Jhuri Alu Bhaja, Prawn Malai Curry, and Misti Doi. (I wasn't alone. Don't assume that I eat a lot.) I really loved the Ilish preparation.  It had a very distinct mustard taste that you don't generally get in other dishes. The Prawn was great as well, but due to my complete inexperience at eating prawn, I might have messed up a little. Also liked the Doi Begun. But the winner, undoubtedly, was the Misti Doi. I have not had better Misti Doi in Calcutta ( But then again, I haven't tasted Misti Doi everywhere). 

The ambience is quite nice and the place despite of being on a busy street remains relatively peaceful. And of course, the place is not expensive.

I had a fish curry and plain rice. Reviews said authentic Bengali and it seemed like it. The taste of the mustard oil could be felt. It was a way too oily though for my liking, but that's true for Bengali food all over. The service was decent. I spotted some black spots in my rice but the waiter said it's normal. I have never seen this before and wonder how it can be normal. Keep an eye out for the same.

Parking space crunch owing to New Market Area will turn you off but the menu will surely turn you on! 

Though a limited offering & spread but definitely worth a visit with family on a Sunday afternoon to gorge on some authentic Dhakai delicacies! 
 
This weekend, try something different. 

Accompany someone to this company!

This restaurant is famous for Dhakai Bengali cuisine and as soon as I came across to know about it I couldn't check myself to pay a visit there on 31st Dec. I went to their New Market outlet, just opposite to Fire Brigade Head Qr. The platter was royal. The price is slightly on the higher side. But believe me, you must try out few of their specialties like Bhetki Paturi, Kochu Pata Chingri Bhapa, Shorshe Ilish, Chingri Malai Curry, Pabda Macher Jhàl, Kasha Mangsho or Dhakai Murg Pulao. The Bhoj Company strikes the right chord of the food loving Bengalis by bringing in traditional Bengali non veg dishes back on the table once more. Following their success, they are coming out with their second outlet in January only at Stephen House, opposite to BBD Bagh Bus stand.

Pretty average place, majorly catering to tourists owing to its location. However, the quality of service and food options/availability are a major let down.
Had visited the place on 28th December with family for lunch and 4 of our first 5 choices of dishes were not available. We in turn requested to know what was available and had to make do with the same. Food was good. Decor could have been maintained a bit better. 
Food: 3.5/5

I had visited this place last week for lunch and I was utterly disappointed. They had actually served us someone's half eaten plate of salad. When complained the manager kept on arguing. Only when we said that we will write this on Zomato their behaviour changed. 
And as far as food quality is concerned its very average with very minimal choices. The interior is cosy but doesn't have any Bengali touch to it.  I don't think locales visit this place as we could see only Bangladeshi tourists. 
If you wanna eat good Bengali food in the New Market area try Kasturi. Their menu offers far more choices in the same price range with much better quality food. Even Randhuni, which is cheaper than The Bhoj Company is also way better.

Some people really enjoy fancy restaurants. The white tablecloths. The multi-course menu. The waiters with slicked back hair and difficult-to-place foreign accents. I am not one of those people and "The Bhoj Company " is certainly not for them. I usually end up dropping some piece of food on white tablecloths. I love great restaurants, but the pomp and circumstance of old-school Fine Dining has always made me feel like I'm a passenger on the Titanic or something.

And thats why, I love Bhoj Company. In many ways, Bhoj Company is quite a run-of-the-mill restaurant, no white tablecloths, no overhanging dimly-lit bulbs, a menu devoid of any complicated dishes whose names you might not always recognize, dishes that come out in expensive cutlery sets. And servers talk to you like a normal human, yeah! 

Most importantly, the food is exceptional without offensive(Loot-Liya) charges. Everything we've eaten here has been executed just right, and dishes feel like ever-so-slightly modernized versions of traditional OPAAR BANGLA cooking. We tasted Lau Ghonto with the Macher Maatha, mocha chingri was awesome and the mutton kosha also tasted fine. 

A meal at Bhoj Company registers a few ticks above what it reflects from the outside, but definitely below your Peter Cats of the world. There aren't many places on that level - think of it as a newer, more downtown-y stand in for something like Bhojohori Manna. On our last visit, we sat across a corner table, and saw an Afro-Rastafarian couple appreciate the food at the reception on our way out. Make of all of that what you will.

By the way, I did drop some "Mutton kosha gravy" on the white-tablecloth-less table. Didn't even feel bad about it!

After sitting for 30 min an waiter came and pussing for taking one particular dish. So as we are hungry we ordered for it. The food was very cold. It would be better if they told us they were closed. Another thing is that they did not searve regular water. It's a govt rule to put reguler water along with packaged water. I don't know how the still doing that. Big disappointment.

The restaurant was more pleasant than my expectaion in terms of ambience,food,taste,cost. I must say this is one of the best bengali restaurants in Kolkata. Will surely visit again and again.

If you are looking for pretty decent Bengali food @ affordable price, thn The Bhoj Company is your one stop destination. Being a Bong, this restaurant was in my wish list for couple of months and one day I find myself lucky to visit this restaurant.

Location of the restaurant is very easy. Located at Free School Street. If you don't know the place then simply just locate the Raymond's Showroom at New Market. Take the lane besides it, go straight and then then you will find a street. Take a left turn and walk couple of steps and you will find it at your right side.

The ambience of the restaurant is pretty good, soft Bengali songs was playing in background and decoration is also attractive. Stuffs are all helpful enough to choose the right dish and the service is quick also.

When we reached the restaurant it was almost 4:15pm. We first ordered Bengali Polao, Mutton Curry, Prawn Malai Curry(Half), Vetki Paturi and Lassi(Sweet). We thought it will be sufficient for two persons but it was not. So we again ordered Plain Rice and Pabda Much er Jhaal. There many dishes are there which is my personal favorite like Sorshe Ilish, Kochupata Chingri Bhapa but when we want to order it was unavailable at that moment. So a little disappointment.

Bangali Polao – Not like typical Polao. Fried in less oil with tejpata md daruchini. Little amount of cashew and kismis are there. But a good fragrance was coming out.. Quantity of one bowl of Polao was not sufficient for two persons. Overall ok okay type...

Vetki Paturi – It is one if my fav item so was very much curious. But the dish failed to satisfy my needs. Size of the Paturi was good but the flavour was not as I expected. A deep raw flavour of mustard seeds are there. So in one word, the price if the item don't justify its taste.

Prawn Malaikari (Half) – One piece of good sized prawn  was there with spicy greavy. The prawn was well cooked and juicy from inside. It tastes good but if you see the price tag of this item them M sure you will think that the dish is over priced.

Mutton Curry – 3 pieces mid sized mutton were served in a rich spicy curry. Too much bones were there rather than meat. But it tastes good and the curry was really finger licking.
Lassi – We take the sweet varient of it and it tastes really good.

Plain Rice – Comes in a bowl. Well steamed rice  but the quantity is not sufficient for two persons.

Pabda Much er jhaal – Pabda is my all time favorite fish, so ordered this one. Big sized fish with yummy curry was served in a big plate. The fish was well cooked and juicy from inside.  Very much recommended from me.

In conclusion, I must say that The Bhoj Company is one of the good restaurant that serves authentic Bengali cuisine. But lack of availability of some popular item may b a reason for disappointment and I personally think that price of some items are really overpriced. But apart from this, the quality of each item is good and when it comes to billing after dining, they don't add any kinda vat or service tax which suggest that, price of every items that are shown in menu card are inclusive of all taxes, which is good when you are fixed on budget. Overall a good dining experience.

Located at the end of sudder Street , this place is mainly meant for the out of town guests. Been here quite a few times. Ambience is good. Food is above average but the thing that stands out is the Value for Money when you compare it to other Bengali cuisine restaurants. A 5/5 on that. Overall pocket friendly fulfilling experience.

I was looking for a good bengali restaurant in new market (esplanade) area and then I came to know about this one from my friend Akash and visited there with my mom. The restaurant was more pleasant than my expectaion in terms of ambience,food,taste,cost. I must say this is one of the best bengali restaurants in Kolkata. Will surely visit again and again.

If you are looking for pretty decent Bengali food @ affordable price, thn The Bhoj Company is your one stop destination. Being a Bong, this restaurant was in my wish list for couple of months and one day I find myself lucky to visit this restaurant.

Location of the restaurant is very easy. Located at Free School Street. If you don't know the place then simply just locate the Raymond's Showroom at New Market. Take the lane besides it, go straight and then then you will find a street. Take a left turn and walk couple of steps and you will find it at your right side.

The ambience of the restaurant is pretty good, soft Bengali songs was playing in background and decoration is also attractive. Stuffs are all helpful enough to choose the right dish and the service is quick also.

When we reached the restaurant it was almost 4:15pm. We first ordered Bengali Polao, Mutton Curry, Prawn Malai Curry(Half), Vetki Paturi and Lassi(Sweet). We thought it will be sufficient for two persons but it was not. So we again ordered Plain Rice and Pabda Much er Jhaal. There many dishes are there which is my personal favorite like Sorshe Ilish, Kochupata Chingri Bhapa but when we want to order it was unavailable at that moment. So a little disappointment.

Bangali Polao – Not like typical Polao. Fried in less oil with tejpata md daruchini. Little amount of cashew and kismis are there. But a good fragrance was coming out.. Quantity of one bowl of Polao was not sufficient for two persons. Overall ok okay type...

Vetki Paturi – It is one if my fav item so was very much curious. But the dish failed to satisfy my needs. Size of the Paturi was good but the flavour was not as I expected. A deep raw flavour of mustard seeds are there. So in one word, the price if the item don't justify its taste.

Prawn Malaikari (Half) – One piece of good sized prawn  was there with spicy greavy. The prawn was well cooked and juicy from inside. It tastes good but if you see the price tag of this item them M sure you will think that the dish is over priced.

Mutton Curry – 3 pieces mid sized mutton were served in a rich spicy curry. Too much bones were there rather than meat. But it tastes good and the curry was really finger licking.
Lassi – We take the sweet varient of it and it tastes really good.

Plain Rice – Comes in a bowl. Well steamed rice  but the quantity is not sufficient for two persons.

Pabda Much er jhaal – Pabda is my all time favorite fish, so ordered this one. Big sized fish with yummy curry was served in a big plate. The fish was well cooked and juicy from inside.  Very much recommended from me.

In conclusion, I must say that The Bhoj Company is one of the good restaurant that serves authentic Bengali cuisine. But lack of availability of some popular item may b a reason for disappointment and I personally think that price of some items are really overpriced. But apart from this, the quality of each item is good and when it comes to billing after dining, they don't add any kinda vat or service tax which suggest that, price of every items that are shown in menu card are inclusive of all taxes, which is good when you are fixed on budget. Overall a good dining experience.

Located at the end of sudder Street , this place is mainly meant for the out of town guests. Been here quite a few times. Ambience is good. Food is above average but the thing that stands out is the Value for Money when you compare it to other Bengali cuisine restaurants. A 5/5 on that. Overall pocket friendly fulfilling experience.

Easy to locate.  Just take the lane beside Indian museum. Pocket friendly restaurant with average quality of food.  Ambience is average. But their hospitality is not good.  They don't serve food,  you have to do it by yourself.  Waiters are not professional.  So don't go with high expectation.  If you want pocket friendly food then this is the place.  And they don't charge tax.

Good Bengali food with pocket friendly budget..
Two of us went for lunch.. Ordered rice,moong dal,aalu jhuri bhaja,jhinge aalu posto and chicken kasha.
Food was good but chicken kasha was low on salt .

Now comes to drawback sides..Waiter's don't even serve the food ,you have to serve it by yourself ( neither they were professional)
Ambience and interior was OK, nothing much rather then their Bengali retro songs.

We were astonished to discover this restaurant in there.We went for shopping last Saturday and after visiting Sree Leathers, it was lunch time.We were lookig for another restaurant but the peddlers told us to come here and we are happy that we listened.The restaurant is big with two enclosures having Bengal decor with a modern touch.The cleanliness and hygeine caught my attention.
The menu card is simple and many items were not available, the server was a good person who constantly during the ordering process.My daughter wanted Biriyani but had to go with MOROG POLAO.We ordered MIXED VEG MACHHER MATHA DIYE, KOCHU PATA CHINGRI BHORTA, LOITTA BHORTA which was so yummy that we repeated the order,PRAWN MALAIKARI & MUTTON KASA. For desrts it was KULFI which was awesome .They themselves have a sweet outlet with mishti of their own .The sweet finale made our memories sweeter in this restaurant.

With bengali cuisine restaurant springing up here and there, this one is another added to the race. Among typical bengali dishes we chose to have rice, moong dal, alu bhaja, alu posto and chicken curry. The vegetarian dishes were good as expected but the chicken dish was not upto the point. If anyone goes with lots of expectations then the experience can be a bit disappointing but nonetheless the food and the overall quality of the place is noteworthy. The prices are pocket-friendly along with friendly staff. But I think the quality of the food can be improved so that they can be at par with the best in business. Good for enjoying a nice, homely and cozy meal with friends and family.

Prices affordable , food average , hospitality zero , ambience and decorwise on the better side : thats all i inferred from my experience today at the bhoj company.
Three of us went for lunch today , and had rice, murgh polao ,moong dal , jhuri aloo bhaja , kochupata chingri bhapa, mutton curry , mutton kasha , aamer chatni and kulfi.
The food was mostly on the average side with almost everything low on salt (thankfully not oversalty!) Except the kochupata chingri which stood out.
Now coming to the negetives , the waiters are not really bothered much if you really need water or anything after putting the orders on table , not even do they ask for serving , in case you need something just loudly ask for it. The service is here is what we expect in 'bhaater hotel' ; not a restaurant stuff.
Next , we initially ordered dehradun rice , the man taking down the order firmly said , the sides like dal and mutton will be a bad combination with dehradun rice ( we didn't get why) and so he asked us to take "murgh pulao" which is the speciality . And one plain rice .
Murgh pulao was normal polao ( which was really a nice one) with a side plate of some rezala like thin gravy and two pieces of slender chicken bones and a boiled egg. Didnot understand the pricing 180 rupees for murgh pulao where the normal pulao is not even half the price!
Next we placed one plate of kochupata chingri bhapa for sharing between three . What came was not even enough for two , so ordered for a second helping which surprisingly had enough to be shared by four. So the quantity varies.
On the first set we wanted mutton kasha , but the waiter suggeated curry saying kasha comes dry without gravy. In between the meal , when we ordered kasha mutton , it came with plenty if rich and delicious gravy.
So i don't understand the reason behind misguiding us.
The kulfi was sad. I would suggest them to top it up with some faluda and syrup and improve the mix overall.
Many items from the menu wasnot available including mocha and mandatory vegetable side dishes. Though featuring dhakai cuisine , didnot find any special name listed in the menu , and keeping some common bengali options like sukto and postor bora won't be a bad option i guess.

If you want to taste "ghar ka khana" at a pocket friendly restaurant then The Bhoj Company is ready to serve. This place is located at new market area. We ordered vat, moong dal, jhuri alu vaja, loitta bhapa,mutton curry, prawn malaikari an misti doi. Loitta bhapa was cold. We asked them to change this one. They just warm it up for 2 mins and gave us.That dish was taken out from the refrigerator and served.  Prawn and mutton was amazing that will satisfy your taste buds.

The Bhoj Company is one of my favourite restaurant nowadays to eat home style bengali/bangladeshi food. I ordered dehradun rice, one moong dal, one masoor dal, two jhuri bhaja and one korola bhaja. It was not oily, it was not heavy, if you miss eating home style food you can reach to them, simple and delicious food. But the only issue is that they deliver late, never on time and whatever food item you order apart from Rice everything else is half plate which is not indicated in the menu, so if you need full plate of sabzi you need to order twice. Another drawback is that if you order 2 plates or rice or anything identical in more then one plate they will pack in one box rather then doing two or more separate packaging, so always inform them regarding separate packaging if you need.

I had visited this place when we had cravings for good bengali food. We were at Gariahat, so from there we hopped into a taxi and reached this place. Very near to the fire brigade in New Market, this is a restaurant which is super crowded. 
We ordered a lot of items and the bill came down to Rs 1150 for 2.
Started of with bhetki paturi as a starter. :P Soft piece of bhetki fillet coated with mustard paste and steamed to perfection!
Then came steaming hot rice with moong dal and jhuri Alu bhaja. This is always divine and comfort food for all bengalis and I am no exception to it.
The owner suggested to order dudh kochu with chingri, i was a bit hesitant but boy I was mistaken.Amazing dish. Must try for everyone.

Being bengalis we dont usually prefer bengali restaurants because we feel that ' ma- er haater ranna' is much better.but trust me here you will completely have the' barir khabarer taste' in each and every item you have.have visited this place many times.this used to be small place before with only one room but now they have expanded it to a 70 seater restaurant.quality and quantity wise all dishes are impressive.over here you wont be dissapointed with any of their dishes.their kochu pata chingri bhapa and bhetki maacher paturi are highly recommended.inspite of having many big names like kasturi,bhojohari manna as competitors it has made a name for itself in its own way.if you want to have satisfactory bengali food at a reasonable price then definitely this is the go-to place for you.

Their home delivery service kept us starving for 4 hours! Had ordered a small meal at 12.15pm on a Sunday afternoon, expecting a minor delay due to rush. At. 1.15pm i follow up with zomato, was given the status that the restaurant had already started the delivery and should be on their way. From this time till 4.30pm, kept on following up, everytime i was told that it's on the way, apologizing for the delay. Zomato had changed the status to delivered at 2.15pm,stating the system automatically changes the status,  assuming the order is delivered!! I personally called up the restaurant to find out the delivery boy's details, who i was able to connect but was told that he's just 10 mins away! For 1 1/2 hours i was kept on waiting for the order to receive stating he's very near. Finally at 4.30pm he came, well beyond our normal lunch hours. Didn't even bother to park his bike and come to my doorstep for the delivery. I had to walk up and before i could say anything he gave a frustrating look stating, its the restaurants fault for the delay.  Cold tasteless food after waiting for 4 hours! Very bad service by the restaurant, The Bhoj company.

I am surprised that a lot of reviews have very good and so on, and yet they have rated this place as 3.5, even after saying good food, good ambience, good price...
Anyway, I was invited there for lunch on Sunday with a family and I was pleasantly surprised. A small place, it has 2 entrances, I believe both serve the same food. We had kochu-pata chingri, shukto, dal, mutton curry and aar machher jhal. The service was quick - I believe the food is all prepared, and it was tasty. I really liked it. My favourite was of course the kochu-pata chingri.
I can't say anything about the price since I was taken there for lunch, but I will be back with my family soon!

Bhoj Company is the first name that appears in my mind whenever I wanna have some rich bengali cuisine. All dishes are soo good, and as it is bengali, its finger licking good. The best part is you u carry a thousand bucks you can easily afford a sufficient full meal for 3 people.
If you are here then don't forget to try their doi begun, kochu-chingri vapa, semai and kulfi.

**That was my previous review bassed on atleast a year ago visit to the place. I have rated 4.5 back then.
But recently I visited the place and gathered a whole new experience. They have expanded restaurant area, they have increased their prises, which was not an issue though; and then comes the food, I have never experienced this much decrease of quality ever; I felt some one just took money form me, went to a road side 'vater hotel' and sarved me in an ac restaurant. Simply a horrible experience that was, this place was actually my most favorite bengali restaurant, and now I have decided to not walk into the place ever again and thats my suggest to you too.

It was sort of an emergency for us. Hostel mess wasn't preparing food. The Bhoj Company turned to be the messiah for both of us (my roomie). And when it comes to 'Bhuri-Bhoj', our 'Bhuri's always 'maange more'. A grand dinner was planned and we went on ordering Plain Rice, Salad, Masoor Dal, Alu Bhendi Bhaja, Jhurjhure Alu Bhaja, Kachupata Chingri Bhapa, Pabda Maacher Jhal & Chicken Curry. The price was pretty much on a lesser side. So we didn't expect awesome delicacies to be delivered to our doorstep. But to our utter surprise, the delivery was made within 30 minutes. Thanks to the delivery boy Mr. Tanveer for that. But the bigger surprise was that the food reminded us of mom-cooked food. It felt like home. No extra spices. Everything was simple. But we kept on licking our fingers till the very end. To be specially mentioned, the chicken curry was made of 'deshi murgi' which has become a rarity now. Amount was moderate. So....... if u feel the 'chuha' running within ur stomach n u don't have 'lakshmi' in ur pocket, blindly go for "The Bhoj Company". I'm sure they'll bring a smile on ur face.

If you want to have a proper taste of 'Opar bangla' food at an affordable price, this is surely the right place for you.

Pretty great ambience. Serves very fast. Waiters are cooperative, will walk you through the menu, help you choose what to order how much to order and in many other ways.

The problem being is that this place is always crowded, you may have to wait for a while if you decide to visit on holidays or in some special occassions.

And I would again mention that this place is one of the most pocket-friendly place. You may even keep wondering how come I eat so many dishes at this expanse!

A must visit for all foodies.
Live long Bhoj Company!

Visited on last sunday for lunch. I must say food was awesome but the service was very poor. Although we had a prebooking there but they were unable to arrange a single table for 10 people. Although we people were divided into two groups they served food in one pot or bowel for us and it was upto ourselves to divide. Also behavior of some of the staff is rude.

Oh It was my bad luck that day that I entered in bhoj company..
It took a lot of time to find it.. situated near simpark mall..
Went there..
we asked them for basanti pulao at first .. they told yes and what they served was white one which i don't like.. quantity of pulao was more for 1 and less for 2.. My mood started to spoil.. We ordered bhuna khichdi which was okay.. now come to the disaster side dishes.. chicken kosha... 4 pices of bone ..  just rediculous.. Then the mutton curry.. they told it contained 3 pieces but they served 2 and dont ask me for the size of the mutton pieces..  quantity of chicken and mutton were soo less that I cnt tell u how was the taste!! 

Totaly horrible experience.. I vl never visit this place again.. 

and yes they don't charge extra tax.. but it soesnot matter . because both the quality and quantity are soo poor..

Ordered dinner from this place today.. All for myself!! I kept it simple with bhaat, begun bharta and chicken curry.. Quantity of rice was enormous.. And that of other dishes were perfect for a single person.. The bharta was very tasty and reminded me of my homemade one! :D and the chicken curry( "mangsher JHOL" in common words!) was very light yet full of flavours.. Just the way I wanted!! So if you want some authentic good quality Bengali food, this is one great option.. And yes, it'll go easy on your pockets too!

Situated near fairlawns just take the lane by Indian museum ....now come to decor.... Well decorated ...really one of the best looking Bengali restaurants....
Behavior of the staffs are friendly...
Ambience good...

We ordered Bengali pulau ,veg vuna kichuri,chicken kasa and mutton curry....

Bengali pulao is one of the worst pulao I have ever had.just a ghee rice with hard cashew nuts...
Bhuna kichuri was good..

Chicken kasa -4 pieces of chicken bones .very less chicken on the bones... Total wastage of money...

Mutton curry...they said 3 pcs but gave 2 pieces.... Not so good...
Services is very prompt.....
No vat...price is inclusive of all taxes...

As new to the city and inexperienced to the bengali cuisine, clearly told to the waiter amresh who happily guided me with the menu and helped me order Pabda Mache Jhal, Kachu pata chingri bhapa along with rice.
Pabda jhal was good and I tasted the strong flavour of mustard in prawns, quite a unique combination which I experienced it for the first time. Post which I ordered Gulab Jamun and it too was delicious and juicy to the core. 
Surely return back to try Vetki paturi as suggested by the waiter.
Entire Dining experience was good.

So if you are a first time visitor in Kolkata and are dying to eat authentic Bengali food, this is undoubtedly the place for you to be. Not a great ambiance and not too fancy but the food, you must taste it to believe it. It all has bengali dish names but the prawns gravy, the dal, the aloo palak sabzi...all amazing. Just ask  the waiter for the beat sellers and you will not go home disappointed.

Went with a few friends who are visiting us after a long time. The objective was a typical bangali lunch. Heard about this place from a few friends and thought of checking it out. We ordered rice, dal, jhuri alu bhaja, posto and aarh maachh, prawn malai curry and panthaar jhol. 

Quite average food and pretty cringy portions. Not really impressed as the prices seem high in terms of quality of food and the entire service. I think the place is a bit over hyped.

Now let's come to the food..
quality & quantity are good, taste also good but nothing special ..I liked the "Kachu Pata Chingri" & "Lote Varta"..
but the "Mutton Vuna Khichuri" disappointed us.. the Khichuri was not cooked with mutton in it.. they served Mutton Jhol in a different Container (bati)..

Also need to mention.. I found the price are a bit high for some items.. 

Overall.. if you're a food lover & like to try new restaurants.. you should try once, you'll like it.. but won't carry any special memory with you..

The Bhoj Company . I had been there for almost 3-4 times. The main thing of this exclusively bengali restaurant is the nice decor and the Ambience.  The food quality is too impressive. Specially the item Prawn Malaikari, Jhinge Alu posto, Sorshe Ilish and Vetki Paturi are mouth watering. The price is reasonable.  In a holiday its very difficult to find a table for ur family, coz ever table u will find occupied. One of the finest bengali cuisine in Kolkata in reasonable price

Don't you love it when you have a comforting meal, and you see the bill and wonder - so that's it, really? That was my exact feeling after my lunch experience in The Bhoj company. 

I had not heard about this restaurant earlier, based on the nearest Bengali restaurant with good rating-results on Zomato, we got here for a quick lunch. 

The waiter helped us with the order. We ordered a bowl of rice with jhinga aloo poshto (fried potato cubes, snake guard tossed in poppy seeds curry), Jhuri aloo bhaja (finely chopped potato fries) and mishti doi. 

The rice was well cooked, the fries were crispy and perfect with minimal flavour, aloo poshto was flavourful, mishtidoi was as good as anywhere in Kolkata, nothing to complain about. It was one comforting meal with mild spices, with homely feel. 

The restaurant is compact, comfortable and well-maintained, with neat cutleries. The service was prompt, the portions of the sabji/ curry may seem less when compared to what we are used to in the Bangalore restaurants, but works just fine against the pricing. 

The total bill for a meal for two added to less than Rs.200. Woah! I was delighted. For those in Kolkata looking for hygienic Bengali dining experience in the New Market Area, with value for money (VFM) option, this is one restaurant to definitely consider. 

0.5 extra for the VFM :)

We took plain rice with valo ghee,plain moong dal, begun bharta, pache meshali veg torkari (mixed veg), sorshe dhone pata pabda jhal and vetki paturi. Ambience was good...6 on 10 though I went in the rush hour. So i found service was slight delayed. But all ok. Price is pocket friendly n must go for especially BHETO BANGALI as me.

Despite my personal aversion to 'authentic' Bengali restaurants that have been fetishizing culture in high priced food and silly decorations for so long, I have to say, I really enjoyed the bhoj company. Unlike the most in its category, it can boast of a sensibly priced menu... the decoration is in harmony to create a mood rather than bangalifying every piece. It is a loud place than one imagines from the photos, but the food is delicious and rather fresh without much splendour of spice and khunti and the waiters are very mannered with wonderfully quick service.

Bhor company is undoubtedly One of the best Bengali restaurant in the city. The decor is so very 'bengalish' with paintings and wall hangings belonging to Bengal. Located at the heart of the city this place is at a stone's throw from New Market Area. 
The menu is authentic and has all kinds of Bengal and Bengali food items in it. The staff is courteous and the service is prompt. If you want to treat anyone with Bengali food you can get them here. A nice cozy place to have a good time with family and friends.

A friend and I were travelling from Dakshineshwar to New Market area by bus. We had no idea the journey would take close to 2 hours. It was 2.30pm and both of us were extremely hungry. Finally got off at new market but we were unable to locate this place and no one knew where this restaurant was located. So we walked for another hour until we finally got to Sudder Street and found this place. 

Ambiance: Its a nice cozy place with room for about 30 people. Loved the cane (rice cleaning) light decor on the walls. 

Food: We ordered Plain Rice, Masoor Dal, Korola Bhaja, Jhinga Alu Posto and Jhuri Alu Bhaja. The rice and dal were heaven. Very simple yet so tasty. We had no idea what bhaja meant (thought it meant bhaji..so side dish). And they turned out to be yummy fried items. The korola bhaja especially was really tasty. The Jhinga alu posto was the only item which was mediocre mainly cause it was sweet. But the rest of the items were simply delicious. I would have liked to eat some baingan ka bharta, but they did not have that. 

Cost & Service: Pricing is very nominal. And service was extremely good. All the items ordered were suggested by the person attending to our table. 

Overall: I would love to go back to this place for their simple tasty food! :)

Rarely do restaurants get Ilish right. This one came very close to it. Ilish must be super fresh, lightly seasoned with mustard and lightly cooked so that the delicate flesh remains soft, moist and full of flavor.

These are tough asks in most moderately priced, low margin restaurants. But yesterday's Bhoj company Ilish was pitched perfectly. A lovely steak from the middle of a 2 kg Ilish was hidden in the bright gold and brown of a mustard seed paste. Over that, stayed a layer of translucently warm mustard oil disturbed only by a solitary green chilli. 

Beyond the Ilish, I had barely time to observe the other dishes. But I detected only goodness, no egregious errors. The meal ended with a nowhere but in Calcutta, non spongy, crumbly and lightly sweetened perfect Roshogolla.

On a regular weekday at 2.30,this place is bustling with seated and eager to get seated customers.it's more like an open season,people stand behind and breathe heavily on your back while you are dining,hoping that you would get up an leave any moment.But If you are the lucky one with the seat,you will find this place quite amicable.The decor,while minimalist,has vibrant hues and reeks of bengali rural art.The seats are cushioned or wooden,and the staff are all draped in white and black.My friend J has a meager appetite,but D has rather an all devouring persona,so he went around ordering from every section of the menu-Basmati rice,jhuri bhaja,munger daal,kachu diye chingri,mutton curry,bhuna khichuri,bhetki paturi and kajori macher jhol.The place was pretty packed,and the waiters spread thin,but the food arrived without much delay.Out of the those items,the bhuna khichuri and kachu diye chingri really stood out.There isn't much point describing the food.The benaglis know exactly what to expect,and the rest,I presume, wouldn't get a hang of the style,not the first time anyway.It's all very polarisingly bengali you see.For dessert we ordered mishti doi and bombay kulfi.

Sitting there,I gathered that this place is a regular destination for Bangladeshi frequent flyers.They get off the Shyamoli volvo at marquis steet or free school street and make a leeway to either kasturi or bhoj company.The clientele decides the service,so the waiters here are more interactive and affable.They will suggest you items,describe them in details,and entertain your suggestions regarding the food,or at least consult with the chef to make it possible.

Another good thing is that they have no taxes above the printed menu.The price must be inclusive,or they just exempt you from the extra pinch.So in my opinion,Bhoj company certainly deserves its place among kolkata's signature bengali joints.Yeah,sure they give a handwritten bill,and they don't have the facilities for card payment,but that's hardly a major inconvenience,or at least not enough to make it a part of the narrative for the wrong reasons.

Decor wise the restaurant is not so good. There was a clear shortage of space, though that has been managed cleaverly. Staff quality was good. They were helpful. We had ordered polau, aar macher jhol, chingri malaikary, fruit chutney & kulfi. Aar machh was good. Polau is not up too the mark. They can simply call it ghee bhat. The flavour of malaikari is missing. The chutney was good and kulfi was nice.The overall food quality was standered. At least one visit is recommend.

The ambience was nice and subtle .....staff guys are quite welcoming .....
#theFood....mhmm since I ordered a fish curry ,a mutton dish which turned out to be so...so.. Not that great taste ....
The most disappointing thing is the quantity , the mutton was served in a small ...a very small bowl with negligible amount of gravy ..as if it was only to taste ....talking of gravy which neither had the aroma nor the texture .
Tastes like home...2.5 stars 
You @bhojCompany really got to work on your quantity thing ..

With an  easy to find location, easy on the eye decor and easy on the pockets price, this place as the name suggests is quite ideal to indulge in a 'bhoj'. 
On the flip side, the place is quite small, so even on a working day at 3 in the evening we had to wait for a good 15-20 minutes to get a seat.
The walls were decorated with various traditional Bengali items ranging from the erstwhile 'dheki' to terracotta toys, which felt quite apt.

We ordered polau (white, not the traditional yellow.....was light and nice), mutton kasha (slightly spicy for my liking, but the pieces were juicy, tender and well cooked), betki mach er paturi (no complains really, as it should be....may be they should quirk up the dishes just to avoid the monotony) . 
In the end we ordered kulfi, which was quite different from the ones we usually have. And by different I mean in a good way. And all of this came at a meagre 495 bucks (we also had a cold drink and a bottle of mineral water, so there you go). 
In a nutshell the food made me happy, the price made me go wow.

This place is a little gem located near the hustle and bustle of New Market. It has a nice decor with white all around. Well made for such a small place. The pricing is amazing even after considering the small food portions served. The food is just perfect. Its as if you have been invited into a typical Bengali household for a lunch or dinner. Ghar ka khana at its best. Only thing that I was missing was service standards. Otherwise, this place is worth regular visits.

But if I will say the ambiance then it's very tight and the same time they have to strongly look in to the cleanness of the servicing area and the wash room areas. If I have to rate them in food then it will 3.9 but if I taken in to consideration the hygiene and cleanness  then I will rate them 3.00. I enjoyed my food.

Really impressive! Truly a budget friendly place. Situated at the end of Sudder street, just in front of the Fire brigade. Going there for lunch by car is a bit of a hassle as the only lane open is the Free school street entry from SN Banerjee road going towards Park Street.
Ordered for Dehradun rice but the waiter insisted that the normal rice was good enough. Moong dal with maacher muro was not available so settled for dal with mochar ghonto which was really good.
Kochu chingri was average. Kasturi has set the benchmark for this dish very high.
Chicken curry was very simple and tasty.
Paayesh was brilliant and so was the Matribhog which is similar to gulab jamun but with a flattened shape and less of sugar syrup.
The only thing that bothers is that the place gets crowded and due to lack of waiting place, many times people stand right next to your table just like low budget marriage parties.
Else totally worth the money!

This place is definitely in league with 6 ballygaunge place, bhojohari manna and sholoana bangali when it comes to authentic bengali cuisine. This restaurant is located right upon sudder street and was very easy to find. The decor is village themed with terracota dolls and beautiful paintings that had village art designs. We had plain rice with mooger dal and jhuri aloo bhaja along with aloo bharta. Then we ordered chicken curry and chingri macher malaikari. The food was light yet very tasty. We finished off with some delicious chutney and khirer chomchom. Only after we finished the meal, we realised how much we had stuffed ourselves with. Kudos to their prompt service. Also we were given generous quantities of each item and our pocket pinch was Rs. 545 for two( cheap enough). However the only downside was that this place tends to get very crowded in the afternoons and we had to share our table with two strangers. Otherwise a great place to try out cheap yet sumptuous bengali food. :)

After so many days we decided to hav some bengali food... and so TBC... its in the sudder street... decor was done by terracotta dolls and paintings of jamini roy... decor and ambience is apt to the cuisine... we had plain rice, dal, juri alu vaja, alu varta, chicken curry and chinri macher malaikari and at last chatni... food was delicious... price was reasonable(545/-) but, we had to share a table with other two .. i didnt like that, a restaurant can not provide privacy to u when u r with anyone and they did not have biriyani that day.... apart from these falacies, service was extremely prompt. .. so along with going to bhajohari manna or 6th ballyguange place you can definately try this place for bengali food...

When it comes to authentic Bengali cuisine, TBC certainly is not the best but would like to comment that they serve decent preparations. The ambiance is quite delightful and cozy and the service seemed prompt to me. It's reasonably priced too and would be a good option for people looking for well priced decent Bengali food in the area.

My friend had come down from Pune and wanted to shop for stuff from New Market. Shopping over, he wanted to have a Bengali meal, especially fish and I could only rely on Zomato to find a Bengali place closeby. Offcourse, it had to be economical. Thankfully, Zomato showed this Bengali restaurant . It's rather close to New Market, the right turn from the Indian Museum.
The board on the door mentions Dhaka style of cooking, so I was expecting something different from our traditional Bengali fare. However, the menu has most of the normal Bengali items. I felt there are very few items on the veg menu, especially, omission of dhokar dalna and chanar dalna at a Bengali restaurant seems odd. 
We ordered for normal steamed rice, tak dal, Alu bhaja, jhinge Alu posto, pabda jhal and chicken curry. The alu posto was a bit on the gravy side and not kind of fried like my mother makes at home, nonetheless it was good. The pabda jhal had a huge portion of the pabda fish and mustard curry with coriander leaves. The fish tasted good, but the preparation, I felt, lacked the wow factor. It was good no doubt, but not extra ordinary. The chicken curry was a standard affair, like the one most Bengali households would have on Sunday. We finished our meal with pista kulfi. 
The pocket pinch is the best part, it's very affordable; for two of us, the bill was just INR 540. I would recommend this place if you are close to New Market and want decent Bengali food.

Starting from the decor which was soothing and simple with some terracotta handmade toys.. Cool ambience.. Coming to the food we ordered Bengali pulao,plain basmati rice,chicken curry,salad & chutni.. Rice preparation was good that Bengali pulao was tossed in butter with some cashews and raisins.. Chicken curry tasted lite no heavy masalas no oily.. Chutni- tomatoes, dates,raisins & cashews.. Chutni was thick... I felt like eating at my home.. Healthy food and pocket friendly... Our bill was only rs.340/-.. I must say staffs are friendly.. Do visit...

This is one of my recent discoveries from a walking trip. Down the mysterious alley called sudder stet, that has a storyline beaming from each of the monumentous buildings lies Bhoj Company in a welcoming light. It almost looked out of place. It was clean, bright and well arranged. The interiors were warm, artful, and minimally yet tastefully arranged. This is a Bangal food joint. The prices are cheap. The food is good. They crowd is a mix of touring hippies, visiting Bangladeshi families or some shady dealers perhaps. I would recommend is place as a one time eat, or if you are n a group. Single women may choose to be there with caution, as some middle aged men were curiously watching. Otherwise the service and staff are nice and prompt.

My husband and I went to this place by chance as we were visiting the Indian Museum for some work and it was raining and we were looking for a place to eat. The place seems to be a popular eatery for Bangladeshi vistors staying in nearby hotels in the area. For me, a Bengali, the place seemed like just somwhere to eat and for my husband, a non-Bengali, it was a novelty. The lau ghonto, kochu saak chingri bhapa, dal and jhiri jhiri alu bhaja, chitol machher kofta and a mixed fruit chatni were excellent. My husband was impressed with the subtlty and nuance of bengali home food even though he gets to eat them at home and I was impressed with little known dishes like kochu saak die chingri machh being put on the table with such elan. It was a delightfully fulfilling lunch on a rainy afternoon.

After hearing many times from friends that it is a nice place to have lunch. I finally had the time to visit the place today. First of all the place was over crowded ,I understand that it was 1st of Jan, However the space of the restaurant was not big enough.The decor dint catch my eyes unlike 6 ballygunge place. Coming to the food.Most of the items were not there with them.We constantly had to change dishes as most of them was unavailable.

We had:-

Rice
Normal Daal
Alu bhaaja
Salad
Kochu posto baata with chingri
Chicken curry
Mutton Curry
Chitol maacher peti
Prawn malaikari
Chatnee
Papad
rasgulla
Kulfi
we were 6 people with a total bill of Rs 2415 (after adjusting as they charged some dishes extra)
There was nothing like wow about the food.It was more than normal. My mom can cook better than this. The only thing I liked was the kochu baata and Chitol maacher peti. All other dishes were not good. The waiters were very busy all the time chit chatting with each and other so we had to call them by raising our voices every time. Baiyaa ye do bhaiya woh do....

Over all I dint like the experience. Bhajahari Manna is far better till now as I am yet to dine in Aheli......

Visited the place with a friend for lunch on Thursday around 2pm.. Half the food on the menu was not available, plates and glasses were not clean. The quality of food we could get to order were OK... I found a piece of hair in one of my chicken dishes while mixing it with the polao, after complaining the waiter took away my plate and gave a new one but did not bother to change the chicken. One elderly lady was evicted from her table and made to sit with us as a group of 4 had just walked in. We had to serve by ourselves, even the water had to be poured by us and we did so for the elderly lady also as no waiter was around to do so. The water stream at the basin was extremely thin too. It was really poor management. I repeat that the food was not as bad as the service, it was quite OK. I think it is a better Take Away than a Sit In.

Ambience was good. food was not as expected. Sorshe ilish was bland, mutton biriyani was oily and even prawn malai curry was spicy. service needs attention. we asked some food to be packed  and we left after clearing the bill and we forgot to take the package and even they did not cared about the delivery. Once is good enough.

Went to the bhoj company couple of days ago. It will take time to locate the restaurant as the area is huge. When we came to this restaurant it was almost 4pm then so most of their items were existing only on the menu card. We ordered plain rice, mung dal, jhuri alu vaja, alu jinge posto and chicken curry. Without any hesitation I can say that all of their dishes were beautifully prepared..

The Bhoj Company is a great place to go enjoy the local bengali cuisine at very pocket friendly prices served in a pleasing neat ambiance. Go with an appetite so you can do full justice .... Order Steamed Rice , Moong Dal , Jhuri Alu Bhaja ,  Sorse Ilish (when in season) , Chingri Malai Curry , Bhekti Paturi ,  Mutton Kosha , Papad and Chutney and go ahead and have an awesome meal. And yes please invite a friend along because chances are you can't eat all that by yourself. Good tasty food at affordable prices make for a splendid meal overall. The only thing I could find fault with is that some pieces of mutton were better cooked than the others. If your picky about your mutton then stick to the chicken and fish dishes which were very good.

had visited this place a while back with the family. Decent food and great ambiance makes this one of the best places serving bengali fare. The kosha mutton gravy is something worth trying out if you visit the place. the service is a little slackened. the chingri malaikari was ok, nothing phenomenal. The Laita macch preparation was good. Going to visit soon however, to give it another try- for the mutton kasha alone.

Visited this place today to try traditional bengoli dishes for lunch. 
Has a good ambiance and decor. Extremely fine for a family dine-out.
Ordered chicken curry, bengoli pulao and he suggested me mocha ghonto (sorry if I spell it wrong :-D).
They served in minutes, didn't even had to wait. Food too was perfect, especially that bengoli sabji :-D
Price is quite reasonable as well.
Service too was smooth, overall had a delightful experience. :-)

As reviewed by times of India. And me Personally will say that if u r missing ur own Bengali traditional food then Bhoj Is the place u shud be. Well reapiring jobs has Made the Restaurant a bit Older than it was few months ago.... Ambience is quite Good. Nd for Breakfast I love this place. Its Not Much Crowdy place . Sweet nd Small Place to get the enlightenment of pure Bengali taste. I tried the Rice Dal nd Mocha Chingri with Doi Begun Nd Bhetki Paturi. All were tasty nd Good as Homemade....... I will prefer for a foodie who is interested in Bengali Taste. But The Service has downgraded for sum unknown reasons....... I have been here for several times. But last tym I found the service got quite awkward..... And now a days some stuff u wont get after 0130 Pm. Ull get an answer that Sir Let me check. Nd that bugger is gonna cum Back with a Reply sir im sorry that item is finished. So u gotta be careful to reach before that timee..... Enjoyed The Food anyways....

A new addition to the list of restaurants on Free School street offering Bengali delicacies, the restaurant has worked harder on its ambience. Although, extremely small, the decor is good and striking. The food and service is at par if not better than the other bengali restaurants nearby. The dishes I would recommend will be Bhetki Paturi and Pulao.
Overall the best option available on Free School street for Bengali cuisine.

PROS: Ambiance | Bengali food | Pricing
CONS: Need more visits to find out...

Before beginning I would thank all the previous reviews, the very reason why I visited this place. My uncle & cousin were in town and I wished to give them a beautiful Bengali Food experience without burning a hole in my pocket.

The restaurant is moderate in size and very beautifully designed. I was happy to find my uncle & cousin impressed by its ambiance [Made for family dining]. As my cousin avoided Non-Veg on Saturdays, so we had the following veg items:

1. Rice - The quality was too good. I was really impressed. The quantity was enough.

2. Moong Dal - Just like MOM made it.

3. Doi Begun - This was unique for me as I never have tried this before. Brinjal and tomato cut into small cubes and fried and served with yogurt on top. Amazing on taste.

4. Jhinga Alu Posto - Quantity was good. On the taste factor really good.

5. Chatni - They served us pineapple chatni and it was superb. Must try.

Finally came the bill and believe me friends I was never ever this HAPPY paying the bill. Unbelievable pricing.

I recommend this restaurant to people looking for family / Bengali-food dining. No chance you would regret this. For its location ask anyone for WB Fire Service Head Quarters while in Dharmatala[Esplanade].

Superrrrrrrr place and awesome food.the ambiance gives you a complete feel of bengals Culture.located at Sudder Street.the Restaurant is sure to lure your taste buds with great bengali cuisine and that too at very affordable price.never imagined that the myth that six Balygunj Place or Bhajohori Mannan offers you the best Bengali food can be disapproved by the Bhoj Company.we ordered rice,dal,aluvaja,jhingeposto,doibegun,anaraser chatni and papar and to our surprise the bill was just 240!!!

Today afternoon went to bhoj company with family, its situated at the junction of mirza galib strt and sudder strt, very easy to locate, interior is very classy,there are lots of tables, many of them were occupied by bangladeshi people and foreigners.. waiters were helpful, we didnot order much, only ordered mutton bhuna khichuri and vetki paturi.. food arrived within 10 mins, bhuna khichuri is an item very new to me so liked it very much, amount was more than enough, mutton was really tender & juicy and paturi was great.. had a very good time there..price is pocket friendly also..

Absolutely home-type food, really tasty. Decent ambience, good service. And really, really light on the pocket. Around 800 rupees for four.

I've been there several times. It is located at New Market area. 

Ambience is very pleasant and staffs are polite. Food quality is also very good. Pure Bengali Cuisine is available there. Chicken Chaanp is a good one. Also Mocha Chingri is nice. Chingri Malai Curry is great to taste. Parshe Maach diye dhone patar jhal is a must try and one of my favourites there. 

Please visit there if you are a bengali food lover and i would rate 4.0 for BHOJ COMPANY.

The decor is pleasing to the eyes,the ambience excellent and the staff friendly.coming to the main part...food.this place is great for simple bengali cuisine..dehradun rice,macher matha die moong dal,begun bhorta/kanch kolla bhorta,chicken kosha and chutney: a sumptuous meal.I dont intend to offend the oh calcutta fans,but if you want bengali food visit prince/bhoj company/aaheli.I have tried almost whole of the menu,and found each dish tasty; some a bit better than the others but none that would leave you dissatisfied.Try the shorse ilish or bhetki paturi and you will be reminded of the familiar aroma of your mom's cooking..Dont miss the mango chutney..The bhuna khichuri is excellent and paired with mutton oh-so-delicious..This place is a must visit for all who want to try bengali food or the lazy bengalis or the bengali cooking illiterate.
