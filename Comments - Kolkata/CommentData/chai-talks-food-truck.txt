I ordered online from this eatery and my order was chicken tikka sandwich, paneer tikka sandwich and some brownie.. I placed my order at 11 a.m. however according to Zomato I was supposed to get my order by 11:45 but I was yet to receive my order past 12:30 when I had no choice but to cancel my order. My only request is that if  you cannot deliver the food within stipulated time at least let us know while taking the order. Hope I would get a speedy delivery feom Chai Talks in future.
