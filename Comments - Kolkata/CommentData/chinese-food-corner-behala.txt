This small eatery is Behala is not the place to be if you are looking for a sophisticated place with great and spacious ambience. Nor is it the place if you want to try out authentic Chinese. But if you are in the mood for some Bengali Chinese, have no qualms and visit this place pronto. You can always rely on takeout if you want the taste and not the view. It is definitely recommended in the Bengali Chinese criterion and i find it a cut above its peers with all the shrimps, eggs, chicken portions in its every dish. One dish is enough for two. The taste will satisfy your hungry bengali soul and will definitely make you want to visit again. They also home deliver in nearby areas.

This is place is really pocket friendly for people like me. The thing I ordered is veg fried rice, Manchurian chicken and chilli chicken. The quantity is superb. That one plate rice is enough for two people. The taste of the food is quite good.

The oldest Chinese restaurant in Behala, it brings back a lot of memories from my childhood. The food is over the top. Although it has sitting arrangements, I'd advise one a take away. 0.5 deducted for sitting arrangement and the price which I find a tad bit high. But given the quality and quantity, it's a cut above its peers. Also, they should reopen the rooftop dining area overlooking the entire stretch of DH Road. Every Indo Chinese foid enthusiast should give this a try. This CFC won't harm you and the environment.

Like all good things, authentic Chinese restaurants are also shutting down in Kolkata. What's left of it, is more of an Indianized version of Chinese! While some barely scrap in the lines of "good", others make their own signature "fusion". Chinese Food Corner (previously, Joy Guru Chinese) falls on the latter part. A place with minimum ambiance and no-frills professional services - yet people flock there in groups just for the great food with honest price. Camouflaged by the biggies in Behala, this hidden gem is the oldest Chinese eatery in this area. Though seating area is available, still take-out is always the preferred option.

If you're new to this place, you'll be handed a long menu card. But, trust me, you do not need to read the whole of it. Just close your eyes and order their house specialty - Mixed Fried Rice and a chicken side dish as par your forte! I would recommend Schezwan Chicken. It's my all time favourite. However, yesterday we tried Chicken Manchurian. It tasted delicious too! Their noodles spread is also decent. One can also try their fish items, quite surprisingly, it tastes good. And all these you get at a throw away price!

The portion size is pretty much to satisfy two hungry souls. Mixed Fried Rice had ample quantities of chicken, egg and prawns. Chicken Manchurian was prepared well. The pieces were juicy and the coating was made perfectly. Needless to say, I would visit here a million times. Frankly, I don't remember how many times I already did!

A conveniently squeezed in place near Ashoka cinema hall, this place is frequented by my friend and often recommended. I tried some of their dishes before too but this is the first time since they've changed the name.

We opted for take-out as usual, when considering this place. The preparations were Mixed Fried Rice and Manchurian Chicken.

The most important thing to consider here is the value-for-money aspect. There was ample quantity of rice, enough to fill two moderately hungry bellies. The morsels of fried eggs, shrimps and chicken accompanied every spoonful and complemented the subtle hot and sour taste of the typical Calcutta version of the Manchurian Chicken. There were about 8 pieces of mildly coated juicy chicken pieces, something the budget restaurants seldom do correctly. 

Today wasn't a day of relishing in sophistication or dipping our toes in culinary adventures. It was a day of rustic and hearty meal, served on plastic home plates, laid out on newspapers and accompanied by cold drinks! This place is highly recommended to anyone in the vicinity eyeing decent Calcuttan-Chinese cuisine in a limited budget, since it has the clarity of vision about who their customers are and what they want from this place...

This place is situated opposite to the manton super market. It's a very small claustrophobic eating place. People who are looking for some tasty food at cheap price are highly recommended. Has conditioning and also provides rooftop seating. Highly recommended for takeaways. Quantity of noodles and rice are huge.  One full plate can be easily consumed by 2 people. This place actually deserves 1.5 stars because this doesn't have any sort of ambience or any sort of proper decor. But their dishes are pretty tasty. You'll definitely enjoy your food. Staffs are very polite too.

Chinese as this place is popularly known as, is a heaven in a hidden alley. The place may be very small the food and its quality has no match compared to it's price. The owner personally takes care that there is no compromise on the quantity and quality of the food. The chicken pakoras are the best in town , juicy and delicious to the core. The place overall is a thumps up for any person who wants to eat good Chinese food.!!! Love this place 🍜
