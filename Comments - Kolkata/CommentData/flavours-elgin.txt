I have been here just once, but I must say, my cravings have increased to be bon ponsien here. The owner is good and the staff too. Prices are not too high compared to the area.
Of course there is no sitting arrangement here, except for the rooftop, however, the place is always on.
I had the Jain Sandwich, and I must say it is awesomeness.
My fiancee had chaat and afair she is an oldie here.

One of the oldest and best vegetarian joint located on the left side of Sarat Bose Road, near minto park while coming from Elgin that maintains its quality standards and prices are reasonable too.

Flavours is one of the oldest street food places in the vicinity. Basically they have picked their name from the restaurant flavours which does not do business much!
On offer are good juices, shakes, cold coffee in the drinks menu.
They have recently started keeping different and unique flavoured kulfis too!
One of my favorite orders here is the veg momo which is tasty. The chat items are good here too! Love the batata with soda!

Prices are decent. The sandwiches are well made too.

We order/ take away food from here quite often. The food quality of this place is always inconsistent. The only thing regularly decent are the momo dumplings. Even the sauce alongside it is always changing in taste. They also charge for packaging. The package however is very flimsy.

The only thing I eat here is the Batata Sev Puri . It's amazing. No other place has the same or better taste.

Value for money 5/5

Service 5/5
Real quick.

Great place to enjoy vegetarian snacks with good ambience. The food somehow has always remained so so for me although some of my friends like it. The fruit juices are fine though almost like Krishna juice opposite nic nak bhawanipur

A small joint that has just the perfect indian fast food. The service is good and so is the taste. The papri chaat and bhel are nice and the place is clean & hygienic.

A small and shabby looking place just beside a fine dine restaurant. Flavours basically is a food joint that deals in all kinds of street food like chaats, pav bhaji, tikka, momo and more.

They have make some good chaats like aloo chaat, chola tikka chat, paapdi chaat and samosa chaat. Chaats taste really good and it is really impressive. They also make puchkas which I would not recommend because of hygienic issues. Pav Bhaji is also not recommended as it is not that tasty. Momos are however good, they give you 6pc of veg momos along with some nice and spicy chilli sauce.

The staff is super slow and quite rude. When I asked the guy about my pav bhaji being delayed, he rudely replied "Should I give you the bhaji uncooked?". It took more than 20 minutes for them to make one plate pav bhaji whereas customers ordering chaats were swiftly given their orders. Their packing is quite loose as well, they charge extra for packing but it is really not worth to pack your food from them. Now since there is no seating available, one has to stand on the pavement and eat.

Have eaten from this small *gap in the wall* kind of place a few times. A quick lunch if you can call it that.

They do the chola tikka quite well. Not gourmet but tasty enough and the price is very reasonable. Their lassi (albeit with Amul packaged dahi) is fair and reasonable too at Rs 20. I have tried the orange shake too... fairly decent (for better stuff head across to the Juicy Fresh store just around the corner on Elgin Road) I tried the Raj Kachori once and wasnt terribly thrilled with it, but it was palatable. Avoid the momos!!!

Most people stand on the pavement and eat. They have a small enclosure in the passage (at the back) which has a table or two, most of the space taken up by their stuff. But once can sit and eat.

They are friendly and service of course quick. Cleanliness I wouldn't bet on.

I once ended a meal with a super London Dairy Caramel Bar which they have at the entrance to the main restaurant. Yummy!
