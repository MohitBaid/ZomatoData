Situated nearby phoolbagan crossing . . I tried some if their sweets which was standard and good in taste. Best part is they have kept the outlet very neat and clean and the items are quite fresh too.

Much needed quality sweet shop in this area.

One of my favorite place in the city to have some sweets. Located phoolbagan in kakurgachi area. Serves varieties of sweets and other savories. Very popular sweet shop among the locals. Tried chocolate sandesh, jol bhora and gulab jamun. A real treat for your taste buds. A sweet experience. Price is reasonable as per quality they offer.

 They serve lots of types of items along with Snacks. They also serve very good quality sugar free sweets. Located just beside Phoolbagan Cakes store !

কাজ এর সুত্রে একবার ফুলবাগান যাওয়া আর এখনে খাওয়া । বসার জায়গা কম তবে খাবার এর মান ভালই । রসগোল্লা আর জল সন্দেশ ভালই চলবে । পেট ভরানোর জন্য আদর্শ ।

A popular sweet shop at Phoolbagan, this place serves a good array of sweets and other savories. The shop is extremely well maintained but has only limited sitting options. Tried a couple of sweets here and a Chat, which was pretty good. The service was quick and the staffs were very humble. Recommended!

This food joint is situated in phoolbagan. I visited this place one evening for snacks. I ordered raj kachori chat which was good in taste and quantity. The staff members were very cooperative. The sitting area is very small and is empty most of the time as people take parcel. They have many types of sweets and snacks which are quite different from any regular sweet shop.

Situated nearby phoolbagan crossing, its quite a new well and brightly decorated sweet shop serving a myriad rannge of sweets and savouries.
Their mentionworthy preparation was the mango doi. Falling short of adjective to describe it. Must must try!
The other sweets were good too. The price was little bit on the higher side.
Don't miss out the aam doi as you drop in.

While passing by decided to try some sweets. They turned out not that good. Nothing extraordinary or special about taste. Just enough to whet one's craving for sweetmeats on a sudden whim.
