I don't know how people give this joint so much marks, I didn't find anything to give them 5/5, I ordered Bombay and Veggies grilled sandwiches and aalu tikki cheese burgers, the sandwiches are good and properly grilled but the cheese burger was average except the fact that they gave a nice amount of cheese. What struck me was the fact they charge Rs. 5/- per dish as packing, I thought may be the pack it with foils and tissues etc. to save the sandwiches from getting soggy but to my surprise I saw they just pack the food in normal paper boxes (which are available in sweet shops too)and hot sandwiches and burgers sweat and becomes soggy... Why charge so much then it means if I order 2 items I have to pay Rs. 10/-, or 15/- for 3 and so on.. Why should I pay Rs. 5/- just for a Rs. 1/- paper box, why are the cheating the customers like this I don't know this is quite a serious issue open your eyes friends before giving them 5/5.
They have adjusted the profit amount with the food I hope then why they are doing such cheap things... I wish not to order from this place again. 
Adding the snap shot....

If you go for ambience its not a place as good as to accommodate more than 10 people hardly but if you go with the taste its next to awesome be it chinese or a yummy vada pav. You can choose it for a home delivery or a birthday party. Taste it once!

The food is really good. Service is good too the only fact that pulls me from giving this place a 5star is that they lack seating or else their food is worth the price. I have had most of their items but my favourite is the Schezwan Pan Fried Momo. P.S.- It's the best food stop in the area. They won't disappoint you. Their packing is good too unlike the others in the area.

It is located in our locality and one among the many which have mushroomed up in this run-up of eateries all around. When it opened it made good food but then when their cooks left the ones could not create the same magic. They make good Burger and sandwiches. Chinese noodles and all they used to make good but not anymore.

Still a good place when you are on run and want to grab a quick bite. Reasonable too. It can be tried. It is run by young people who really want to make a good turnover. Whatever be it for this locality they are good enough and always have good customers lined up.

Can be tried once. Personally I like the Veg Cheese Burger very much.
