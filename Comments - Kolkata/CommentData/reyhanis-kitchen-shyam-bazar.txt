A newly opened food joint near shyambazar. In Opposite lane of The park school. Nothing to say much about the decor. Food is pretty average. But the service is nice. Overall an average experience, not that satisfactory. Decent for a pocket friendly meal.  But must say Chicken kolkata wala is really nice.

Rolls aren't probably the best things to eat from this newly opened eatery trying to promote itself as a budget restaurant. But we had the egg mutton kathi roll from this place. The mutton nuggets were not properly done and were hard and chewy with disproportionately large amount of fats. 
Expected better from a newly opened restaurant don't to gain some promotion.

Value for money kind of place. If you ignore the lavish interiors what you want and top notch services of inside of you mind then this place can make a mark on your mind. Although I took food as a parcel but what I said is what I have seen. The foods are of desi style so desi food lovers can go ahead

Yesterday ordered 10 plates of Chicken fried rice for a prgm, the food taste was not good. There was nothing like the fried rice taste as it was smelling full of biriyani smell..... Food was not upto the mark...
Ordered for the first time Will think 2nd time before ordering. It seems like they have mixed biriyani flavours with the Fried Rice....

I have ordered a mutton roll last evening i.e on 23.11.17, it was quite good, price is only Rs 50/,staff were quite friendly. Its near my residence so placing a home delivery order will be convinient for me . Lets see the coming days when I will be trying other items

I placed online order from this restaurant and their Chicken Reyhani Special is just simply awesome. Taste is perfect, quantity more than adequate and the price is reasonable for the food provided. Looking forward to more foodie experience from here!
