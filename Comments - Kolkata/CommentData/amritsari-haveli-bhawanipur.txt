This newly opened restaurant I had lots of hopes on but to my utter dismay it’s is the worst .
I got butter chicken as it was explained by the owner present there as the best dish available taste wise but I got it it was only gravy and no chicken at all .
You are charging 200 for this pathetic food it’s very very disappointing..I hope the owner knows the meaning of respecting the customers taste coz at the end of the day without the customers the place wil hold no value

The food was very good . The preparation of the food was excellent. The malai chap , chole kulche , puchka and the lassi was fantastic . 
That is why I am giving this rating.
