This is a very small place for food lovers and I first went there to taste their signature dish which is the Chicken Lasagna .The other dishes might be average in taste but the Chicken Lasagna takes the cake with it's mind blowing taste and looks .It's a must try at this place and you should visit this place for their Lasagna.We also tried Mixed Friedrice and the amount was quite good .

This place gets an average rating in all three aspects - food, ambience and service.
Good adda joint for a group of friends over a cup of coffee or snacks, but if you are looking for a proper restaurant that would satisfy your gastronomic desires, then this might not be the right place for you!
Nevertheless, there is nothing that I found exceptionally bad or good that is worthy of mention.
'Average' be the right word for everything in here. :)
