Too bad as the taste as well as quality
Chilli chicken is sweet with lots of oil
Chicken pieces are pretty hard barely had any capcicum or onion in gravy
Rice has smell of smoke
Barely edible
Sorry to say but worst experience
I do not recommend this outlet to try

What do you do when a food joint opens up nearby?

You tryout the food, yesterday was no other day when I first placed order from this newly opened place.(Sadly I haven't taken pics from yesterday as I wasn't expecting the food to be this good)

Being situated in Parnasree is a big challenge as there are other well renowned restaurants but "Made in China" has surely made it's point.

The food was heartily cooked and tasty. It's quite similar to your home cooked healthy meals.

I honestly can't wait to try other dishes, a big cheers to the chef and  owner who personally brought the food over.

All the best for your upcoming food ventures.

Ordered Chicken in barbecue sauce and combo meal 2. Honestly, I was taken aback by the quality of food at such an affordable price. The quantity was huge and the food was really flavourful and the fried rice was very well seasoned... Definitely a hidden gem...everyone living in the area...should give this restaurant a try. The person who took and delivered my order was really polite and courteous as well. Henceforth,  definitely gonna order from them often.

Indian meals are very good, especially fish and chicken meals. Price is also reasonable. Their behavior is also nice. Overall, we are very satisfied.

This hidden outlet in parnasree is there to give you a bang for your bucks with its awesome Chinese collection. Quality, quantity all are good, it has got that authentic Chinese flavor to its foods! Had this outlet been on the main street it could have got its much deserved exposure

With an awesome collection of Chinese and Indian food, this restaurant is a takeaway joint hidden in the streets of Parnasree. Do try their rice and chicken, tasty and affordable!
