Avoid this place.... it serves stale, unhygienic food. A total waste of money and more precious time.... Had been there there for their buffet and was totally shattered with the experience....

Only Starters were good else the Main course was just pathetic. Roti, Dal, Rice and all. They should add some good menu to their main course section (Buffet).

Looks pretty high end, but is actually not. I had been there with my vegy friends so we ordered all veg dishes and this amazing mixed dal - panchmola. Though I would say it's a bit hidden and probably their common customers are those who stay in the hotel. But I would definitely suggest this place, give it a try, you'll be surprised :)

It's inside the Larica Inn, beside Pipal Tree. Had Buffet Dinner here. Everything was served on the table and they didn't have a regular spread. Quality of food was decent and so was the hospitality. Lots of options were there at the starters. The food prepared tasted nice too, the mutton was succulent and tender.

I have purchased a lunch buffet deal from nearbuy.But they provide only some menu from their menu card with 1 portion per dish also that no of dishes are limited.1 deserts only per person .1 cold drink,1 soup,1 main course per person.1 starter per person,They just make people fools.It is not a buffet, it is just a optional four course lunch.
I m giving 2.5 star jst bcz of taste of the foods.Otherwise I will give 1 star.For 599 it is just not worth it.

This place is wonderful must admit, the décor is beautiful and good ambience. The interiors are very nice. Well hopped in for lunch. Had a fruit punch for drinks. We had chicken manchow soup which was very nicely made, with ample amount of chicken. It was really tasty. For starters we had reshmi kebab which was cooked well very juicy And soft. We had Kimchi salad followed by main course which comprised of Chinese. We had Chicken fried rice , which was filled with chicken pieces, and good quantity. Also we had mixed fried noodles. For dessert we had chocolate ice cream. This place is good to have a quite time with your partner. And the food quality and quantity adds up, also it's pocket friendly. Must visit again and again.

One of the most disappointing places in the city,they have on of the best places to make a good eating joint. But they failed. The nearby deals look good but the actual food is not. Do a buffet around 600 with good food and it will lit up. But the options are too less , doesn't feel lyk a buffet at all

I visited the restaurant last week for a buffet dinner which was on the menu but to my disappointment when I reached there they told me that the buffet menu was not available. I had a buffet dinner coupon but I was served Ala carte dinner menu which was not up-to the mark. The restaurant was empty on a weekend night which was also a shocking factor looking at the location in which it was situated. The behaviors of the staffs were good.

Frankly was a bit surprised after seeing the low ratings on Zomato. Had been there last week on a Sunday. The food was good and the staff cordial. The thing which stole the show was the amazing view of the Rajarhat main road through the glass. It's definitely a must try for the overall package and will go there again. 
P.S. Price is reasonable . Pocket Pinch 600-800 for 2

I'm supposed to give negative marking but due to unavailability I have 1. Dear friends I requested to you please ignore this hotel/restaurant. Don't go here even they provide free room/dining service. I've very bad experienced with this hotel/restaurant. Management team is cheater. They knows only one thing that is money. I suggested that mark this hotel as blacklisted. So, be careful friends.

The popular hotel chain Larica came up with a new place in town located at Rajarhat and Coriander is the restaurant of this property.

##Location:
Located at the Chinar park area Noapara to be specific beside the petrol pump.

##Experience:
Once you enter this place you would have your expectations high as the ambiance and decor is quite nice but they fail to impress me with their food department. I was here for a office get together and had a quick meal on my way back home. Honestly the food was extremely ordinary compare to the look and feel of the place and didn't quite match up to my expectations. Adding extra points for the service and decor specially the glass view beside the table was scenically beautiful but the food is just barely average nothing special to mention specifically. Needs work around.

Situated at the heart of Chinar Park, held very high hopes for this restaurant.. But we were thoroughly disappointed.
The staff tried to cajole us for the buffet but we were not so hungry and so opted for regular meal. 
The staff suggested starters and soups which were already present in the buffet spread. As it was already prepared the items arrived very quickly.
For the main course we wanted fish item but they had chicken available. When we question ed them they said 'You should have called for a reservation earlier'  , though the restaurant was half empty. We got the fish item after many rounds of discussion. Had to wait a long time for the main course.

1. Health & Hygiene: Very Very Poor. Full of flies.

2. Seating Arrangement: Bad. Height of the Sofas and the Tables are not proportionate.

3. Timeliness: Pathetic. Foods were supposed to be ready by 12 PM, but in reality it was delayed by an hour. Among us there was Vegetarian person, who got his Starters even 15 later then us. Although the replenishment time was very good.

4. Food Menu: As per the Lunch Buffet they are supposed to provide the following items:

2 Mocktails / Welcome Drinks 
2 Soups (1 Veg & 1 Non-Veg)
4 Salads (2 Veg & 2 Non-Veg)
6 Starters (3 Veg & 3 Non-Veg)
3 Veg Main Courses
3 Non-Veg Main Courses (Chicken / Fish / Mutton / Prawn)
1 Indian Bread
1 Dal
2 Rice
4 Desserts

But in reality out of 3 Veg  Starters only 2 were served and out of 4 Desserts only 1 was available.

a. Mocktails / Welcome Drinks: Good. 

b. Soups: Very Good.

c. Non Veg Starters: Good. Out of the 3 Non Veg Starters Fish Fry was very good, Chicken Kabab was somewhat okay but Chicken 65 was worst (probably it was cooked a day before). 

d. Veg Starter: Poor. Out of the 3 Veg Starters only 2 were served. One of the paneer items was very bad (probably it was cooked a few days ago). 

d. Salads: Good. 1 Non Veg, 2 Veg and 1 Fruit.

e. Non Veg Main Courses: Average: Chicken was not so good, Katla Fish was okay but the taste of the Mutton curry was horrible.

f. Veg Main Courses: Good.

g. Indian Bread, Rice: Good.

h. Desserts:  Average. Out of 4 Desserts only 1 was available. Sweet curd was very good, but that was the only sweet dish they had.

Decided to give my wife her birthday treat here. Ambience is good. Situated inside a nice hotel, the dining ambience is quite apt for parties and little get togethers. 
There were 3 starters served, which were good, but not something really special like you find in Barbeque Nation. Chicken 65, normal kabab and fish fry formed the platter.
Found the main course to be quite better than most other buffet places. With plain rice, veg paneer, mix veg to fried rice, baby corn masala, chilli chicken , fish curry, butter nan and mutton rogan josh - it was quite a delicious combination between veg and non-veg. Deserts were disappointing with only ice-cream and gulab jamuns - this is something which was below expectations.
However, for a sumptuous main course experience, you can keep this in your wish-list.

It is inside Larica Inn. 
Starters were good. Chicken crispy chilly, Reshmi Kabab and Chicken 65 were good to taste. Reshmi kabab specially was delicious and the best food item of the buffet. There was nothing worth mentioning in the main course. Mutton Rogan Josh was good to taste. Beside that nothing everything else was ok. There was not much to choose in the desserts section. Only mishti doi and rosogolla was available. Service was not upto the mark. Staff members were busy in the event at the banquet and hence were not attentive to the guests in the restaurant.  Overall it was ok.

The service was very pathetic. We have to call out for several times for repetition of the starters as it was served on the table. But garlic chicken and crispy baby corn was good and can't say about chicken tandoori as it was served only once. Some items was good in main course like the mutton and the butter nun. But here also servicing was very slow. The desert was almost nothing only gulapjamun and another sweet. Recommend everyone not to go unless you have nowhere to go.

pathetic service..worst experience ever in my life.Went there with six school buddies..It started well but then their service fell apart.even after requesting multiple times none of the starters were repeated.some of us didn't even get to taste the chicken kebab.they kept on saying that it will be a bit late but the dishes never arrived even in the 3 hours we stayed there. Most of the main course dishes were not refilled. Everyone in the restaurant were shouting but the management didn't even show the courtesy of replying to them.Food is the last thing I would like to write after this experience. Ice got finished after some time and most of the mocktails served were hot. Sandesh(which got finished after some time) and gulabjamun were the only available deserts. Really If you want to screw someone then only recommend them this restaurant.

First things first, Larica Inn is distinctly far for people like me living at the southern end. Although, it was easy to find as it's close to City Center New Town. The premise looked lavish from the outside. You could tell it was going to be an expensive meal just by the front of the hotel.

The Restaurant is on the first floor, with really elegant decor. Service is exceptional. It was actually weird for getting such good service that made us feel a little overwhelmed. The entire staff and the manager were attending to our needs. I think it isn't exaggeration if I say they made us feel special :)

Food however, had a slight uniqueness. I found their chef's way of cooking to be different. I loved the fried rice. Coriander had a lunch buffet prepared and I gave their rice a try. It was perfectly done. The thing that stood out the most for me was butter naan. So soft at the crust and crisp at the center.

Food was fresh. I was doubtful at first as I and my mom were the only people there at that moment. Food quality was above average. They served us two kinds of welcome drinks. One soft drink and a mock tail. We were served two starters, tandoori aalu that needed more flavors and fish salt-pepper which was the best of all.

I have nothing to complain as such. For improvements, i would have liked if there were more Indian main courses, the fish gravy needed some work and dessert should not simply be limited to Rasgullas. I think the service, butter naan, fried rice and the enormous options we were given stood out over any of Coriander's drawbacks. If you can get hold of Groupon/nearbuy coupons then this newly established restaurant is a must try. They served us too much for too little :)
