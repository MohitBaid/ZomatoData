I had ordered for home delivery via their sub brand - Delhi Chaat. The delivery was fast and the person speaking on the phone was courteous enough to let us cancel and edit our order. Ultimately we had ordered for veg burger, aloo tikki chaat, mixed sauce pasta and Schezwan noodles.
Food wise the burger and noodles were OK. The quantity was sufficient and pricing was very reasonable. But the pasta and aloo tikki chaat were sub par. We were not able to even finish the latter, and had to dispose it. The pasta made me realize that their oil is of a low quality, and it really brings down the quality of the dish. We actually got sick after having the pasta, and I would not recommend it to anyone. The saving grace is the burger and the noodles. The only short coming in the burger was the presence of kishmish. I suggest you ask them to remove the same during preparation.
Ultimately, the outlet needs to improve the materials it uses to reach its full potential.

The Street Food scene in Kolkata has never ceased to spring surprises.. Imagine a small kiosk that sells Indian Street food like Chaat / Aloo Tikki and Dahi Vada for 16 years, decides to move with the times, and adds Pizza / Pasta / Noodles and Sandwiches to their repertoire. Meet Dilip. Through his little Kiosk at the corner of Rowdon Street and Auckland Square (next to Kookie Jar), he has brought some interesting world cuisine to the streets of Kolkata. Pocket Pinch.. Rs 90/- for the Pizza, Rs 70/- for the Penne and Rs 50/- for the Malaysian Noodles.. NOTE : Pizza base was quite hard.. as per Dilip, that's how most of his customers like it.

Great food. You can get anything you want and it all tastes good. Must go if vegetarian food is the thing you want. Ambiance is not that great but considering food quality it was great

This has been a favorite as far as chaats are concerned. Specially the Aloo Tiki Chaat here is a hit with my family and guests coming over. The chola bhatura is yummy too.

A lot of people coming over call in advance to say this is what they want to eat.

Recently these people have started serving
Chinese and Italian dishes. When I saw this I found it very difficult to associate a Chaat shop with pasta alio Olio, Pizza Formaggi, Malaysian noodles and Vegetable Pot Rice.

On the insistence of the shop owner I tried the

Penne in Arrabiata Sauce
Malaysian Noodles
Veg pot rice
Vegetable Manchurian.

And I gave to say, they are doing a great job with the Indo - Chinese food.
The pasta was really good I must say.

The prices are really low. The food is worth a try and gaining popularity.

Om Shree Hari on Zomato .. No way!!! But to be very honest they deserve it to be. I have been enjoying their chats with soda shikanji or masala thumps up for years. The aloo tikki chat is probably the best and most importantly very fresh indeed. Superb experience everytime :) Chat lovers must try them out.

This is a small roadside shop without any seating arrangement adjacent to kookie jar on rawdon street. But don't go by the looks. It serves one of the best aloo tikki chaat in Kolkata! It used to be the favourite break time place during college days and is very moderately priced. It also serves good chola bhatura.

The best aaloo tikki chaat you can get in Kolkata. The crunch of the aaloo, the texture of cabbage and the blend of all the chutneysÂ n dahi makes it a perfect dish. If you are a chaat fan, then you must visit this place.

The place is located in the adjacent lane to that of kookie jar in rawdon street. The place though does not have any seating area is pretty neat and hygienic. I have mostly parceled chole bhature from here which they prepare at that moment and take around 10 mins to give us our parcel. The chole bhature I feel is their USP which is good and tasty and spicy. I have also tried the 
Aloo tikki chaat which I did not quite like as the curd had become sour in taste spoiling the entire taste of the chaat. Price wise its reasonable. Overall a nice place to enjoy some cheap and tasty chole bhature.

I had no idea that Om Shree Hari was listed on Zomato. I have visited them for years and enjoyed many a Lime Soda Shikhanji and Masala Thumbs Up here. The Aloo Tikki  Chat , Papri Chaat and the Mixed Chaat are all pretty good and I indulge myself on occasion when I am in the area. The Choola Bhatura I tried only once ... was just average and the bhatura was too oily. Prices are decent and food is freshly prepared.

Right around the corner from Cakes / Kookie Jar is the small roadside stall that does chaats. Various Tikki chaats, Chola Bhaturas and their ilk share space with the very popular chai, Masala Thums Up and the like.

Their tikkis are different from most others. They have a elasticky aloo mix which they make into a ball. Hardly any spice inside. This is fried in ghee. They call this Banarasi style. It is served with either as a dahi chaat, a chola chaat or a mix.  The place is quite clean, and does not give one the feeling of many similar places.

Worth a try.

Reasonably priced. Only issue is standing on the road and eating with the traffic around. Also the edge of the road is often used as by people to relieve themselves!!!
