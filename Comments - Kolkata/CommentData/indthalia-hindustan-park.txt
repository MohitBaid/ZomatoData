I happened to visit the place during the Durga Puja with my friends for lunch. The food was decent enough. The service was not bad either. The ambience of the restaurant was good. I would want to revisit the place with the same set of friends again.

Situated in the lane that is bang opposite of Basanti Devi college at gariahat, indthalia has a variety of things to offer. It's a cafe cum multi cuisine restaurant. Out of the 3 branches in calcutta, I've been to the southern Avenue one n this one so far. And I like this branch better. Given it's much more spacious and the staff are extremely courteous and polite n prompt.
I took my friends here on the occassion of my birthday. They were sweet enough to wish me and played birthday songs whilst I cut the cake.
Later on we ordered, chicken tikka masala , panner pasinda and butter naan. The preparation was good. Fresh and hot. My friends even admitted enjoying the meal. Later that week my parents n I again visited this place n this time we tried some fish fingers for starters. Had really good fish fingers after a long time. Really happy with my new discovery. Indthalia is a must go if you happen to stroll through gariahat. The prices aren't extravagant either.

This restaurant is located in Hindustan Park. There are two other  Indthalia branches spread over South Kolkata. It happened to be my friend's birthday treat here. The interiors of this place are pretty spacious and well decorated. The location is convenient as well. The staff is courteous and well behaved. They played birthday song for my friend and also wished her. After the cake cutting, we placed an order for Paneer Pasinda , Chicken tikka masala and Naan. They provided us with complementary salad too. The Naan was soft and fresh. I probably tried Paneer Pasinda for the first time and it was indeed well prepared, sweet and creamy, melted in mouth. Quantity is ample and service was quick.

Location : Easy to find, near basanti devi college, Hindusthan park. Parking is up to luck as the locality is always crowded.
Food : Fish tikka masala - 6 pieces of fish
Fresh lime soda - We took 3 glasses
Kadai chicken - 6-7 pieces of chicken
Butter naan - We took 4 pieces
Food is not up to the mark. The quantity was good but not the quality.
Service : Good
Value for money : No, as it's a bit expensive considering the quality of the food ! Total bill was Rs 1316.

Fish tikka and cracker fish are sure to bring water in mouth of the fish loving bangalis out there.  I also suggest the Chinese food items out there especially the chicken ones. 
I hope you'll have a great experience there.. :)

Conveniently placed at the opposite of Basanti Devi College and beside the age-old Panjabi store Kimbadanti, Indthalia, off Rashbehari Avenue, has been around for quite some time.
Ordered Spanish Paella and Grilled Fish on a recent visit with a dear friend celebrating her shopping spree.
The Grilled Basa was expected to be coated in lemon butter sauce, as the person serving us had confirmed so. However, by the time it reached us, it had been wrapped up in ultraspicy barbeque sauce; not appealing to our taste. The dish also contained boiled veggies, toasted bread slices and a scorched tomato.
The Paella is a Spanish Polao with meat chunks and sausages, the spices adding up to impart a rich texture. It tasted nothing close to extraordinary as the meat chunks were no longer tender and the sausage bits overcooked. The adjoining raita complemented this taste though.
I used to frequent this place previously for my favourite pasta salad. However, I know not if the standards have been still kept high.
Thereafter, I must state that the black coffee at Indthalia is still a refreshing draw. Thankfully they have failed to alter it any further.

I went there with my cousin and her friend; we were quite taken in by the ‘pop’ decor inside...complete with themed posters and wall-hangings. We decided to order Fried Fish with Tartar Sauce and French Fries. The fish was fresh and tasty, and the French Fries were the best that I have had....much better than those served at MNC fast-food chains.

Actually no plan to be here, was on the way of pandle hopping. A bit tired, so thought of be refueling, and we were at the Hindustan Park sarbojonin at that time. Yes, so we decided to be here.

Location:
___________

It's near the Hindustan Park.

Decoration:
______________

There is nothing much about it. It was okay time, okay place to be hang around, nothing special.

Food & Beverages:
____________________

✓ Fish Fingers: it was 8 pieces in a plate, severe with dip and salad. Taste not good at all, the fish coated with some coating and then fried. Did not like it.

✓ Prawn Salt and Papper : this was pretty good. Prawn coated it a thin layer tossed with veggies. Good one.

✓ Fresh Lime : it was good. Okay enough to make us refreshed a bit. We took it 3.

✓ cold coffee: it was more choclate shake I felt. But it was nice , not as a cold coffee but as a choclate shake.

All that cost 1314. Yes price I felt I bit higher compare to the taste of it.

Yes, as I mentioned need improvement in some sections a bit for sure.

● Good food but not in quality.
● Sitting Arrangement: chairs are not comfy.
● Staff Behaviour: Very good and friendly.
● Located in a very proper place.

I ordered :

Paella: Being in Europe for a pretty long time, I can surely say that Paella doesn't tastes like this at all(Too bright with spices).Moreover I have tasted this very same dish in your golper outlet, trust me it is far better in quality and quantity too.

Chicken Burgundy: Not satisfied.

Indthalia Frappe: used to be a little more thick. Due to consistency of the liquidity, it tastes more watery kind of. This one I have tasted in the golpark outlet of Indthalia, and my vote goes to them.

Irish Coffee: Good one. Perfectly composed!

This is a pretty place where I had visited previously for chinese food.
But now they have continental food as well.
We dropped in here fir breakfast.
We had a cappuccino,Strawberry splash and Chicken Imvolentine.
The coffee tasted very nice.
The mocktail was good too.
And we fell in love with the steak.
Chicken imvolentine had two pieces of chicken stuffed with ham and egg cooked in cheese garlic sauce.It came with chilli garlic toasts and boiled veggies.Mashed potato was added on request.
The steak tasted heavenly.
Well,according to previous experiences Chinese food here is good too.

You'll get the best fish fry here( quite costly though). But trust me you'll love every bite of it 😍
Cold coffee/shakes are great as well!
They've many outlets in the city but acc.to me, Hindustan Park is the best(both decor and taste wise).

I want to start with the positives first as that is the shortest part.  
1. The atmosphere and ambience. 
Now let us get to the negatives. 
My wife and me have different tastes so I went for the Chinese and she for the Indian.
I wanted something spicy to go with my noodles and I was suggested the hot garlic sauce with my vegetables, but it turned out to be anything but spicy. 
Let us get to the Indian. The paneer in the Paneer Tikka Masala  was burnt. The filling in the Masala Kulcha was burnt and tasting funny. 
This is the last time I am ever visiting the place.

Visited this place today first time. Ambience is good, not very huge but simple. Food is good, per the price quantity was substantial. Staff was courteous and friendly. For 2, i ordered 1 fried rice, 1 hakka noodles, 1 chicken in oyster sauce, 1 mandarin fish, 1 cold coffee billed. Oyster sauce chicken is definitely worth trying. Food is worth spending money. The only reason i gave them a 3 star is that they charge you for boxes if you pack your unfinished left over food, they charged me 16/- for 2 boxes for packing my food.. I mean, cumon...a customer spends over a 1000 buks on a meal and rather then wasting the left overs, getting it packed to be reused, and you guys charge 8/- per box for packing the left over food. How illogical is that!!! This gave me a bad impression on top of my overall good experience.

Chicken tandoori : okayish type
Pan fried fish : okayish type
Main courses::::::::
Mixed rice: didn't taste good
Mixed noodles: very ordinary
Chicken manchurian: okay type

I don't know why but this particular outlet is not up to the Mark comparing with their other outlet. I rated 3.0 only because of their kebabs..........

I visited during pujo on saptami, it is very costly, food quality was not bad. But seriously compared to food and service it is too costly. The most dissatisfaction was they don't have separate washrooms for gents and ladies. Washroom door was not getting locked 😠😠😠

A nice place. It's very very cheap. To be this this is the best description.
Now 1st comes the ambience, the pace is very well decorated with enough sitting place unlike the other branch  in Southern Avenue. Now comes the quality of the food. Unlike the Southern Avenue branch whose quality recently became a disaster this branch gave superb quality of food. The lazania was just mouth watering. And yes the barbeque chicken after the lazania was just superb. Even the ice was very well garnished. Lastly was the price. It's superb cheap we ordered 6 items for 6 people and the bill came only 1.5k and yes I was like what becoz the quality was way high for the item compared to the price.
To conclude a nice place can be easily gone with friends anyday you want to visit.
Now a tip for the management, please have a look in the Southern Avenue branch cause the last time I visited the place and ordered Chicken Mayo salad, the full dish was under cooked with a very bad smell. Guyz please look in this matter.

Went there today with my family and ordered for a plate of fish fingers with tartar sauce as a starter. The fish was fresh and was good quality bhetki (something that I am very very particular about) It tasted good, but I like my fries crispy on the outside, which they weren't. But they were tasteful nonetheless.
For the main course, we ordered for butter naan, paneer kulcha and butter chicken. The food was pretty good.
Our total amount was around 700 for 3 people.
The staff were polite and helpful. 
Pretty view from the hotel.
Would love to go back

Quality of food, service above average. Nothing special but it is a nice place if you in a shopping mood at Gariahat and feeling hungry and feeling too lazy to go to Hatari.

I have been to this place innumerable times since my school days. This place is located adjacent to the kimbadanti lane in Gariahat.My brother loves their lasagne. You order any food they will not disappoint you.  Be it cheese chilly toast or pan fried chilly fish. The ambience too is quite good. The only con of this place is that the service takes too long . So the management should really look into it.

Indthalia was quite the rage when it first opened its doors to the ever hungry crowd of Kolkata. The brimming popularity, soon lead to the launch of multiple other outlets of the restaurant in promising locations in South Kolkata, the one at Hindustan Park being one. 

Food: 

Compared to the other outlets, I found the food at Hindustan Park not up to the mark. The flavours are just about fine and in no way above average. “Average” is a kind word. The Chinese served at the place is comparatively better than the Indian, which I had tried before, on a visit during the Durga Pujas. 

We ordered Chicken gravy noodles, which were exceptionally bland, the dry chilli chicken was good, and the crispy chilli baby corn was okay-ish. The best part of the meal were the fresh lime sodas (sweet and salty, as ordered), which we ordered two for each person, by the end of the meal.

Service:

The staff knows very little about what is on offer and what ingredients make any certain dish. This was especially a problem, since I was with people who have certain restrictions to follow. Once you beckon the attendants for placing your order, you will find people pushing each other, one encouraging the other to take the order. Two words for the service- “Late” & “Confused”.

Location:

The only thing working for the place is the location. It is in the road, bang opposite to Basanti Debi College, connecting Hindustan Park to Purnadas Road and Vivekananda Park. The guests visiting are either college students, or hungry and tired Gariahat shoppers.

Ambiance : not great. Simple table & chairs. Everything is very dark, god knows why.

Staff: very confused.

Food and drinks : 
Mixed noodles : nothing great.
Chilly chicken : was nice but came in small portion.
Sweetcorn soup : this was nice.

OKAY so me and my friends were roaming here and there in gariahat and finally end up having lunch at this place. The ambience was quite great and peaceful. There were many couples and families too. So basically it was a friendly environment. We had ordered crispy chilly babycorn ( one of my favourite veg dish ). It was okayish,not too great. Something was missing ,I dont clearly remember what ! Then we ordered noodles and garlic chicken. Noodles were really great and tasty. Garlic chicken was yummy too. The quantity is pretty good. So overall it was a nice experience. :)

P.S.  I would have given it a 4.0 if the babycorn tasted great too.

Our second visit to this place in 3 months and i must say that they have managed to maintain the quality of their food here unlike the Dhakuria branch.

We had ordered for 2 portions of Fish N Chips and 1 full Tandoori Chicken. The Fish N Chips was simply awesome and delicious. The size was pretty decent and the Bekti they used was of top quality. Accompanied with a decent portion of French Fries and Tartare Sauce, the dish made our visit memorable. The Tandoori Chicken was pretty decent, though I personally felt that it was a tad low on seasoning and a bit stiff. Otherwise we had a satisfying experience.

P.S. - A note for the management - ifbthe food is good, there's no issue saying so, but if a customer is saying the food is not good, pls refrain from arguing with the customer and do the needful to improve. Thank you.

Okay this outlet of Indthalia is located in Hindustan Park. This is a small and easy restaurant with neatly orchestrated and comfy furniture.

We had ordered a bread item and a continental item. Well I must say they did taste good. Although I liked the continental more. The dishes available here incorporate different kinds of cuisines. You will require revisiting the place a couple of times to try some of those out-of-the-way items.

The prices are a bit high here although it does make some really interesting dishes that you are unlikely to come across in other places. The place is good to catch up with your friends or to enjoy a small brunch with your family.

One of the few authentic Chinese restaurants of Kolkata. Used to be a regular once, because of its close proximity to my school. What I personally love is their juicy paranthas and spicy tikka masala! Also try their Cantonese noodles and my all time favorite hot garlic chicken!

Staffs are well behaved. Ambience is peppy with soft music playing in the background. They also keep various magazines which you can go through while waiting for the delicacies to come. Price is reasonable and the quantity is impressive.

Its been long since I have had a decent Chinese cuisine anywhere and hence my 4.0 rating. Tucked in the by-lanes beside Kimbadanti and located bang opposite to Basanti Devi College, this restaurant seems to be frequented by many people.

We were a group of 7. As soon as we entered yesterday(12/09/2015) evening, we found the place fully placed. We were about to make our way to the 1st floor, when someone let us knew that the concerned floor was closed. We were immediately disappointed with the attitude. On a weekend, at 6 pm in the evening, would you really keep a portion of your restaurant closed and limit your customers?

Nevermind, the wait wasn't longer and we were seated within 5 minutes. We ordered for Sweet and Sour Corn Soup (Chicken) and divided it among

 the rest of us. The quantity was more than sufficient and the quality was decent as well. The broth was light and succulent. However, the pieces of chicken seemed rather less for me.

Next, we ordered for Chef's Special Fried Rice (Mixed), One portion of Szechuan Chicken and portion of Oyster Chicken. Two of us ordered for one Chicken Sandwich and one Veg Sandwich. While the soup were served to us in no time, the fried rice and chicken side dishes seemed to take eternity. Considering or assuming the fact that restaurant prepares everything afresh and hence takes up the time is indeed commendable but at the same time such long delay can kill all the joy and fun.

The sandwiches had arrived in the meantime and they were served with plain potato chips and a bowl of ketchup for both of the sandwiches.  The sandwiches looked pretty much the same to me and there was no way to distinguish between both of them. The other thing which caught my eye was the only single small bowl of ketchup served for two plates of sandwiches. The chips too had got a bit dumpy and hence did not taste crunchy. Serving a small pack of chips available for 5 rupees would perhaps be better.

After a long wait, the fried rice and the chicken dishes finally appeared on our table. The quantity of the rice was sufficient and two bowl of fried rice would be sufficient to satisfy the appetite of 3 hungry tummies.  The bowl of rice was topped with a large half boiled egg to beautify the decoration. We were served graciously by the waiters and being the hungry monsters we were, we immediately dived onto our food. The rice grains were light and did not contain hint of much oil. They were beautifully fragrant and tossed with ingredients.

The szechuan chicken complimented the fried rice beautifully. The chicken pieces however seemed to be made up of a bit excessive batter. Even though it tasted good but the proportion of the actual chicken to the batter could be increased. The oyster chicken was good as well but did not stand up to szechuan chicken. This could be because, they mostly tasted similar and there was nothing specific to distinguish between them both. There have been reviews earlier for this restaurant where bloggers have complained against the uncanny similarities between most of the Chinese dishes. Am not sure why the trend is repeated. This could really hamper their popularity quotient in the future.

We ended our meal with Iced Lemon Tea and Fresh Lime Soda Sweet. I was told that the Iced tea did not have exactly the light consistency it used to have. It was more like a 3 layered cake with varying flavors throughout. First the Lemon, then the tea and then the iced water. The soda on the other hand was refreshing but still lacked the consistent structure. It needed to be stirred around a bit more to get the sugary water and lemon intermix with one another.

I had ordered for a Chicken Diana for parcel and the total bill came to Rs. 2412/- (If I remember correctly) and Rs. 360/-(For the parcel). In the end, it was a hearty meal which we enjoyed throughout not considering the little deficiencies here and there. I tried the Chicken Diana back at home and it was a huge slice of Chicken with a beautiful batter and covered lightly with brown sauce. It was accompanied with light vegetables and two large slices of toasted butter bread. I wouldn't say the dish resembled 100% continental touch but it was somewhat a mixture between the Chinese country and Continental Country.

If I could sum it up, the restaurant has a lot of places for improvement. The menu is wide and exhaustive and the chef definitely tries to do justification to all of them. The prices could be cut down by 20-30% percent and the response time could be improved upon. Would definitely suggest to others to give this a visit, but choose your pick carefully. :-)

This place is locate in Hindustan park just beside Kimbadanti stores and opp to Krystal chopstick. I love their coffee and variety of starters both Chinese and Continental. They are simply yum. Very well located for the Gariahat shoppers. Service is quite fast and prices are reasonable too. A good place to hang out.

I went there for the first time in the company of two of my friends in the month of June this year. Sadly, I did not notice the decor so wouldn't comment on it. We went there mainly for discussion, but I was worried that we may not find any place there, for whenever I passed by this joint, it seemed perpetually crowded and people standing outside in queue for their turns. But thank God, that day we were lucky and went in. The maitre de table was a well- mannered guy who took down our haphazard orders, French fries and cold coffee with ice cream. He warned us that we should have French fries first otherwise after taking cold coffee " you would not like to have anything else". And he was right. We rapidly finished off the French fries in between ourselves and when the cold coffee arrived, I was transported to heaven. It was so delicious I cannot describe it. I fell in love with it.
The discussion that went in between ourselves was not a happy one, but after taking this cold coffee, I was ready to forgive and forget everything.

We went in to have dinner after shopping in Gariahat. It was our first time visit in any Indthalia outlet. The decor was simple yet pleasant. There not much people and we were wondering how the food would be. We decided to have Hyderabad Mutton Handi with Kulcha and my kids had Rogan Josh with butter nun. The food was excellent and tasty. The quantity was enough. It was true value for money meal. The service was bit slow. The staff came to apologise for the delay. Their behaviour was really nice. Would like to visit again and try other items.

Always dined at the Southern Avenue one, so it was a surprise for me when somebody said there's one more Indthalia at Hindustan Park. The decor and the ambiance is pretty nice though we went in pretty late in the future evening. As always, we had to try there Bacon in Cream Cheese and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. We also tried the Lasagna in Ham Olive, well for that I do have to say that as much as I like Olives I was never really a big fan of them and the lasagna was like literally full of it. Now coming to the service, all the attendants were very friendly & helpful but the waiting time on the food can be improved. Overall a very satisfactory experience and I would love to visit this place again.

Visited this place on Ashtami last year when we couldn't get seats anywhere else. Service was good, food was good too. Price is reasonable. But my friend had a really unfortunate experience when his jeans got ruined because of some chewing gum stuck at the table. So, not really a pleasurable experience. Staff was not really that bothered when we complained.

We were 3 person. We were not that hungry. But had to do dinner. Indthalia was the nearest place and we wanted to try this place.  We ordered fish crackers and coffee and then we ordered a indthalia special chow.
Coffee was great. I ordered black coffee with fish crackers. Fish crackers was served with onion rings. They were good.
The indthalia chow was also good. Hakka chow. Loved it also.. It was around 600/-. Didn't have much here to give points and review. Still gave 3.5...

I have got very nice feedback about the lasagne Indthalia prepare, with high spirits I have visited the  Hindustan Club outlet and alas they sadly said that today lasagne is not there in the menu and instead they suggested me that I should try "tetrazzini". I followed their advice and I was not deceived, it really taste nice. But there was a party going on in the upstairs which was so noisy that I could not relish the meal properly. However I will look forward to visit again and try their Lasagne

TiAs my father fell sick, first few days i was eating in The Hospital Canteen - Rozzana. Later a taxi Driver took me to a place in Gariahat, Oh, i never believed that a taxi Driver will suggest a Excellent Place. He said, in past, he Dropped many people to this place, who all are fond of Delicious Foods, and thee Great thing of this place is, They are Serving World Cuisine.
Later, while placing order, I find Mr Bapi Saha is suggesting Great mouth watering Dishes.
When The food came, before that only they was serving Mouth watering Sizzlers & pastas to the Next Table.
Then I found a couple along with their Parents was served great Indian Delights.
Some people found eating Chinese and Thai foods, i was Expecting Pupak Punkari, which was not in menu as they Do not Serve Crabs.
In the mean time my food was served, and we do not remember when all the Items was Over, we was simply licking our fingers. then came the Coffee. Simple Cappuccino was sprinkled With Cinnamon Powder.

My parents was thankful To Indthalia for the Great Treat with mouth watering Food And Coffee made By manual la Cimbali Machine, and finished by well trained Experts to Excellence with a Great ambience.

Yes, I got The Right Place to Eat, at last, in Kolkata. Excellent Service by the Staff.

The Hindustan Park outlet of Indthalia is located at a convenient junction.
It was a spur of the moment decision to try it out, once my mom saw the signboard.

The ambience was nice.

The menu is extensive and provides variety. We decided to order Mushroom pepper and salt as appetizer and followed it up with Mixed Hakka Noodles & Shanghai's Chicken in the main course.

The service is prompt and the servers are extremely courteous. They are also able to answer any questions we might have about the menu.

The quantity is more than sufficient for the price. While one starter is enough for two persons, two portions of main course are good enough for three hungry people.

The mushrooms were well cooked and the seasoning was perfect. The mixed Hakka noodles came with egg, chicken and prawn in them. Although it was hard to single out the shrimps, it made for a good meal. I was pretty impressed with the Shanghai Chicken. They definitely make one of the better Shanghai chickens in the city.

Neither me or my mom had much of an appetite today, so we went for the simpler dishes. But I definitely plan to go back to try out the continental spread on offer.

We unexpectedly ended up at this restaurant and did not find the decor very heartwarming. The insides are minimalistic with simple tables and chairs. Initially we were the only people there and was totally having second thoughts about our choice of restaurant.
However, the food drove away any uneasy feelings. We had ordered lamb chops and a Chinese platter. Quantity was more than sufficient. The taste was delicious. I was more than happy with the lamb chops at that price. There were six big pieces along with mashed potatoes, peas and sauteed veggies. As the afternoon got older, more people started visiting. It's a reasonably priced place for continental food, though better Chinese is available elsewhere.
Don't let the interior decor put you off.

Before I say anything at all I must mention that I have been an Indthalia loyalist until yesterday. I have been coming here for ages and think the world of their food.

So, yesterday, I arrived here at around 6pm for some coffee with a friend (also female). The waiter assigned to us asked if we'd like some snacks and we said no. He grimaced at that but we didn't fuss over it. He might have been having a bad day for all we knew. So, just about 15-20 minutes pass, and we think of ordering another cup of coffee/tea when we hear the staff discussing how 'these two women' (us) have come here for a chat and 'they' won't order anything substantial to eat. This was done quite loudly and was intended for our ears. They were standing not even 20cm away from us when having this ludicrous, rude discussion. 

So much for the loyalty! 
We left immediately and vowed never to return.
 (P.S. I have been there many times with my fiance and have noticed nothing but courtesy on their behalf. Does this isolated incident have something to do with us being women? I don't know. Either way, it was very humiliating and nauseating.)

The food, almost all the that I have tried out tasted moderate but they took a long time to serve, though my visit not recent. It was several months back and I hope they are serving faster these days!

Chinese salad, mixed hakka noodles, chicken club sandwich, blue lagoon , dhania chicken all r my favourites from indthalia. Price is not too high. The waiters r well mannered.

I had to accompany one of my friends, there. I wasn't eating, but from a little share from her. And I must admit, the share itself, kept me having more and more.I don't usually have Fish at restaurants, but the Chilly Fish here was something really tasty, the Hakka Noodles was good as well. The Tootie Frooty was good, but I had had better.The place is good. Easily accessible, prime location and it is not one of those dark places. The Music was nice...old Kumar Sanu melodies ;-)

I came here with my mom on Sunday. I really insisted we try out this place since I've tried the other outlets and really liked it. 
But this one was such a disappointment!! 
We ordered chicken sausage in bbq sauce , veg spring rolls and coffee. 
It took over an hour for them to serve coffee which made no sense at all. Cus coffee in coffee machine takes like 5 mins! 
~chicken sausage in bbq sauce had a bad presentation. They didn't serve the salad they usually do with it, cus I've had it in other outlets. 
Chicken sausage was a bit too salty for my taste. 
~veg spring roll, this was a complete NO! NO! 
They served cold spring rolls, on request they did change it. But nevertheless it was a disappointment. 
Overall, it really makes me sad how the service has gone down and also the quality of food. 
Paying 450 for this food? I will think twice.

i go to this place sometimes when i am at gariahat shopping.the location is good and convenient .this place is moderately low priced.the coffee or other beverages are satisfactory because of its low prices.the sandwich is good and so are some of the other appetizers. in the crispy chicken the chicken is sometimes hard.the quality of food or beverages are not that high but satisfactory and is well compensated due to the prices.
       this place provides a good cafe experience within a reasonable price range.

Its quite a big restaurant ,spread over two floors in the lane just opposite to the Basanti Devi college.
They serve a huge range of food items.The ambience is nice. .mild lights . .not very crowded . .u can sit and chat in peace in here.
Their service is not very quick but alright. The amount they serve is quite enough for two people and the pocket pinch is not much . But all their Chinese chicken dishes taste the same ( my chilli garlic chicken and the schezwan chicken tasted the same ,really! !). But I would suggest their pan fried fish.
You can go there with friends and have a good chat and food that's decent enough

To some extent the food was "eat-able", considering the fact that it's food. Never seen such chaotic place with utterly poor service. Also lacked in "Calculation Sense".

Visited the restaurant for the 2nd time today to try out the European cuisine and was really impressed! Ordered Grilled Lamb Chops, Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce and Seafood Sizzler. The lamb chops were simply the best of the lot, even better than what I use to have in The Steak Factory. It tasted authentic with generous helpings of garlic toasts as accompaniments. The Grilled Fish however, was not that brilliant as the fish was a bit fibrous contrary to the tender, buttery and melt-in-the-mouth versions I have sampled so far. The sizzlers were also really good. A satisfying lunch altogether :-)

Been to this outlet a number of times and I love what they serve, albeit the recommendation for the Southern Avenue one ranks higher. On various occasions, I have tried the Chinese and Italian preparation here, and it has been worth the buck every time. I love their spaghetti Tetrazzini and other pasta items. The Chinese preparations are very good too. They serve quality food at affordable prices. If you are in vicinity, make sure you visit. The mock tails they serve are good too. A must try out seriously.

Wow! I was amazed! I mean, how can someone cook so horribly? Rissoto, do they even know what it is? What a waste of money and apetite! Would have been better if I had spent 20Rs on chicken sandwhich from any street canteens :/ Totally pissed me off! One horribe cook! :/ definately shouldnt cook italian! :/

I ended up at this place without having an option...!! We were reluctant as the ambience was a total let down! We called for a lemon iced tea which they can't go wrong with along with a chicken lat me Kai... Which was okayish as the chicken was hard! Then finally we concluded our order with a fish orly... Which was just edible! Would not visit again... Very mediocre!

This is a multi-cuisine restaurant , seen it many times but never entered into this but today decided to call them up for home delivery, free delivery range is 3 km.. They took lots of time to deliver, though my house is about 1.5 km away from the restaurant.. I ordered all chinese items, mixed fried rice which was very ordinary and tasteless, hot garlic prawns- this was a red gravy with very sweet taste, quite strange but the prawn pieces were big and juicy so no complaints, mandarin fish- its a white gravy with small chunks of chicken in the gravy, also very strange and sechuan chicken- this was as usual red and spicy.. all the fish prawn & chicken items contained 8 big pieces, no complaints on the quantity but all the items were neither authentic nor indianised also, probably their own recipe..Cost of all the items were around rs-1400, a bit on the higher side considering the quality of food..I can't comment on the ambiance or the service but home delivery was bit delayed, took 90 mins to deliver and the food is decent, not extraordinary, have to order indian and continental items in near future to comment on them also but chinese is good for once or twice only, certainly not for frequent order..

Wonderful restaurant with wonderful service. Food quality is nice. Average delay time. Price has hiked recently but still it's pocket friendly. I am having food here since last couple of years. Side by lake is wonderful dating places. 
Chicken ham sandwich, indthalia frappe, glass noodles (singapore style) are some recommended food.

Indthalia is a multi-cuisine restaurant and also a cafe, so recently ended up here for a couple of coffees n some snack alongside. The  location is top notch , in front of Krystal Chopstick but they do not seem that aggressive to be making much of it. The place is big, seats are very comfortable and well spaced. The decor is pretty dull and average, infact could be much better given the space. The staff lack mannerisms but were polite and prompt.

Coming to the orders, ordered couple of frappes and a veg kebab platter. The frappes were made pretty well, exactly as we had requested. Further the coffee beans used had nice aroma that made it more worthy. The kebab platter had 10 huge pieces of kebab for just 150 bucks. They were well marinated and grilled. The total bill came to around 400 bucks and was just great for that price.

Overall looks like the place has some great food on offer at very pocket friendly prices but does not quite provide a great ambiance and thus lacking on the experience front. Yet would definitely be back to try out other items on the menu.

ICY Blue, Chilled mocha along with pan fried fish was our order from indthalia hindustan park. Ambiance wise its an okayish place as there is nothing extraordinary in the decor.Service wise itss decent as the waiters attended us in a prompt manner. The drinks reached us in about 10 mins. Whereas the fish was completed in about 18-20 mins. Icy blue was below average, Chilled mocha was better than icy blue. The pan fried fish was decent on taste though they could have improved the quantity of the dish. Overall a pretty average place.

Indthalia,for the past 2 years has been my gang's 'Central Perk'. I have visited this place time and again , not sure for what reason ... but we have been there for a good number of times.

I will begin my review with the coffee section.Cappuccino and Cafe Latte live upto normal standards.The one hot coffee to try out here will be the Mochachino.  It is yummylicious with the tint of chocolate syrup and lookswise awesome tooo !!!! Another must try in this section is the Frappe Indthalia which is my personal favourite .It has a coffee base with layers of vanilla ice cream.

Next would be the toasts.Well,I am a bit disappointed here.I tried the chilli cheese toast out here and its way below standard.Its just a plain toast baked with cheese with no hint of chilli flakes.

Next would be the Chinese platter.Chinese in Indthalia is just NORMAL.Nothing Great or Xtra-ordinary.Lat ma kai chicken is a must try here and so is the Chicken sticks.Rest of the items in the menu are just NORMAL.The Indian platter is also a decent one and their Masala kulcha and Kadhai chicken is a must have.

Now,finally I will talk about their Continental dishes .Though this is not a place to hunt for Continental pleasure ,my friends decided to give it a try.We ordered Chicken Diana ,Chicken Strogonoff and Chinese Sizzler.Well....never ever order chinese sizzler here.The reasons are not worth being said. Well ..as for CHICKEN DIANA...I loved it. I have had fish diana before...but not the chicken version of it.Its steak style chicken tossed in brown sauce and served with saute vegetables and garlic toast....AND it tastes heaven !!!!! Chicken Strogonoff was also good if not great , With butter rice and chicken cooked with cheese and mushrooms !!! 

The place is neat and service is a bit slow and soothing music plays on the player !!!Most people go there and have Chinese...but I will suggest them to try the continental ones too!!! They will rank better!!!! 
So,I would give them a 3.5 !!! But they have a lot of Potential to do better !!!!

Indthalia is a good place to have snacks after shopping from Gariahat (I generally do this). The coffee was amazing! Sandwich was tasty too and the crispy chicken was liked by my brother but I didn't like it that much as compared to the sandwich and coffee.

Indthalia is one of those places that has failed to impress me despite the fact that I have tried it a number of times. The menu offers Chinese , Continental and Indian though I have only sampled the Chinese and Continental Menu.  The cheese chilly toast or ham cheese toast is the only decent thing on the menu that has consistently tasted nice.  The slow service and  taste of even basic dishes are a real disappointment .  The batter of the fish orly was extremely oily and the chicken tetrazini was just plain bland. The chinese food had the same problem the chicken spring roll was way too oily and the chilly chicken was not good ... noodles were just ok. I request the management to look into these issues as I feel with a bit of effort this place can really be turned around. Staff needs to be trained and kitchen needs to be properly supervised with the management having regular tastings to make sure the food is upto the mark.

This place has SUCH potentials. And I do mean it - SUCH potentials in capitals. There are certain things on the menu which I love - they make a very nice crispy chicken stick, which remains me and my best friend's favorite nibbles when we hit this joint. Compared to the rest of the expensive coffee shops, this one also has a very reasonably priced range of coffee and they make a super sweet chocolate shake and their sandwiches are pretty good. So why give them 3.5??? Well, the sole reason is service. I came here a month back and although the place was empty the guys took 10 minutes to come to us and take our orders, even though they saw us clearly uncomfortably sitting on our chairs and looking for them to come to us. The food came in within a reasonable period of time - about 12-15 minutes, and was piping hot, so no complaints there. The chicken pakora was made of small pieces of chicken held together in a batter which tasted really nice. The chicken stick was also very well made and the chicken breast pieces were juicy. The shakes were very tasty and heavy, but the service really was very slow, and the servers were busy chatting with each other rather than give us some attention and that turned us off big time.

The dishes which I tried their were Sea Food Soup, Paella, Chicken Tetrazini, Lasagne and some Risotto. Now the Soup was not that great while Paella was awesome. I have no idea about how exactly original paella tastes but this one for sure has stolen my heart. Quantity was also very good. However the tetrazini was ok type but again Lasgne was again good. These are the positives of this restaurant.

However the decor and cleanliness of the restaurant was horrible. Even the table is also not properly cleaned. But as far as having Paella is concerned, so one can avail their take away service and try that..

Not upto the mark really - went with my wife and asked for Masala Tea & strong Cold Coffee. For a joint that calls itself a Coffee Shop cum Multicuisine Restaurant what we got was pathetic. The Masala Tea was tea bag tea without milk - a total first for me and if what we got was strong coffee I am sure the normal coffee could compete with watered down chocolate shake. We had also ordered dry Chilli Chicken and Fish Fingers. The chicken was definitely over coated with something and overfried. The only saving grace was the Fish Finger - it was ok and come in a huge quantity - never had 10 - 12 pieces in a plate before. Our first time at Indthalia and also our last time.

The place suffers from pretty bad maintenance,awefully late service and lack of appropriate cutlery for the dishes.The food however is not very bad,though not authentic continental it tastes good enough.Nothing is particularly worth recommendation,though i would advice you not to order the tea.Visit the place if you mean to while away your time only,and improperly cooked dishes or inept service do not bother you.Its disappointing how they cannot use the excellent location more to their profit.

The food is pretty good considering the prices(the revised ones are a bit high though) and the Continental section is pretty good....The quality of the Chinese section has reduced drastically.....Never tried Indian here...This was like our usual hangout place and I took many of my friends here...Slowly and sadly things have changed the place needs a paint job to say the least....The waiters do not even know how to lay down and arrange cutlery...Recently on my last visit on 25th of November 2012, I found a spoon still having some dal makhani stuck to it which had not been cleaned next to my plate...Complained and they apologized.
Had it not been for the slow service, low maintenance and such bad organising this could have had a huge hit in Kolkata....
