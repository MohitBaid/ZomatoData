A lot of my friends lately in this amazing winter weather have been going to this place often and this time I ended up here with them on Christmas Eve evening. I have to start saying this first that this place serves -the best sangria ever. The starters- chilly baby corn , paneer tikka, chicken tikka all were good. Mushroom moti tikka was the ultimate. Service is really good too even though it was extremely crowded. I would love to go back again and have a great time

A perfect combination of a five star ambience, decor and location with terrible service and food. None of the food is upto the mark of its value. A complete mismatch to the rating of the hotel.

The food and the place was good. But the service was too bad. After entering the restaurants we were unattended for 15 minutes. We had to repeatedly ask the waiters for cleaning the table. Even after asking for the menu card it was not provided to us. We had to take it from some other table.  We ordered for Virgin Mojito but mint leaves were not available. After finishing the food we repeatedly asked for the Bill but they were not responding. Finally I had to got up and approach the counter for a bill. There were people but they were not managed efficiently and effectively. Overall it was a bad experience. Since it was a Sunday so it was told to us that there were shortage of staffs. But even when some of tables were vacant but the people were not attending the customers properly.

This rating is only based on the ambience and the drinks. We didn't try any food. This place is perfect for a cool night. It's pretty and cosy. Maybe we got lucky, but service was good too. If you're tired of loud music and "raging", this is the place for you! I loved it.

Ambience, look and feel of the place is good. However, the service in terms of TAT is quite poor. Hope the owners will look into it to make this worth the time spent.

Restaurateurs in Kolkata are opting for Roof deck far above the bustling street. One can just admire the drama, the party mood and food. Almost like a movie set on ones lavish terrace. Deck 88 is one such lavish well manicured green lawn, gives the vibes of garden party. The chic furniture is designed to light up the party mood.. So diners who really want to gaze out can try Deck 88. 
Leme start the Gupshup:

Here’s what we ordered:

Saunted Mushrooms: The mushrooms were saunted in olive oil, garlic, herbs n salt to taste. So it lacked salt & had very less use of garlic. Basically twas very bland.

Kebab Platter: Kebab Platter comprises of aloo tikka, Paneer tikka, hara bhara seekh kebab & veggies kebab. Each one had unique taste & twas good. 

Caribbean style Cottage cheese Mushroom : This dish was stupendously fabulous. Slurping while writing about it. Delicious & Highly recommended!

Last but not the least, The Service & Pocket Pinch: This deck is pricey & lavish! There’s dearth of staff & it takes a lot of time to place the order & get the order in required time. 
My Verdict: Amazing Deck & worth a try!

The name is very appropriate. It takes exactly 88 minutes for them to either get your order, or to be reminded that they completely forgot about it. Well, it just didn't happen once, but twice to us during the same visit! Please only go there if you have a lot of time to waste and a great deal of patience.

This is located in Astor Hotel. It is a rooftop restaurant. And I have big thing for rooftops so this was one place where I wanted to visit. But sadly it the experience did not turn out well. The menu which they offer is not that interesting. Also the ambience was a little off. No music. Very silent. I did not get a chance to try the food out. As the vibe was not appealing and thus we had left the place. The view is good though. 
I would definitely give it another try considering that day as a bad one.

Great service, food and drinks! Not your oh so cool checklist trending place in Calcutta, but just apt if you wish to have some meaningful conversations at the comfort of nice patio decor surrounding and good prompt service! So glad to find Calcutta coming up with more substantial places than just hookah lounges with loud music serving drinks to under 25s..
Hope it sustains through the chaotic mess Calcutta has become
And yes of course good food..the taste reminds me of the nostalgic weekend dinner I used to have here at the hotel restaurant downstairs, growing up back in the 90s with my family...Glad to see that the establishment has tried to revamp itself with a good outcome and not lost its charm!

Bottom line : it's a great new find for the people of Calcutta, however do ensure it's one nice pleasant day else the whole experience goes down the drain! Food is great, so is the service and the drinks!

Taste: everything ordered was surprisingly above a lounge standard ! 

Sight: it's a beautiful little deck for which you go through a flight of steps, however it's kinda small and sweet so needs prior planning on holiday hours and days

I ordered some food and it didn't come for an hour. When I asked about it they made an excuse saying it got burnt so they had to make a new one and the new one would be out in 2 minutes. After 10 minutes it didn't come so I asked them to cancel it and then it came after we had already payed.

Every middle-class Bangali person has a thing for our roofs – at least those who grew up in the 90’s, in a house and not a flat do. There are little gardens there. We take evening strolls on the roofs. We put chairs there for ourselves and our guests. Our memories of spending nights on the roof with our family, watching the stars and falling gently into the world of sleep, are still vivid and precious. As a child, my favourite evening activity was to ride the swing installed for me there, or walk my baby brother in a stroller. I’d watch the clouds, and try to figure out the constellations. Sometimes, as the breeze played with my hair, I liked to imagine myself on the deck of a gigantic ship, sailing towards the mountains of clouds. I figure the temperature and humidity of Kolkata has a huge part to play in the roof-love of our lives.

My nack of trying new places brought me to this small Cosy place right in the heart of the city near theater road. Located inside once renowned Astor hotel. I and my friend visited the place at around 10pm on a weekday just to chill and enjoy a sheesha. We were the only one in the Cafe, which honestly took us by surprise, but soon realised the reason behind it. Was pretty satisfied with almost everything till we called for the cheque. When almost 90% of the cafes all around kolkata doesn't charge you more than ₹350-450 average for a sheesha this place charged me ₹ 845 just for a sheesha. Undoubtedly the most expensive place for a sheesha, we were shocked seeing the bill. They charged me ₹ 150 for a coal change which is complimentary in almost 95% of the cafes and then they charge you 35% as vat. I don't even know if charging 35% vat is even legal when all cafes charge 14.5% as vat. 
So next time when you plan to enjoy a sheesha in an open air place rather choose places like OTT, Zucca or what's in the name which is 10 times superior in terms of ambience and costs you 50% lesser.

A favourite new place to chill! 

We ordered a couple of beers under the perfect weather, followed by watermelon Martini.  
Their Flavoured Iced Tea makes the perfect thirst quencher too. FYI they serve lots and lots of chakna.

For starters, we ordered their Tandoori Chicken Tikka Keri Chaat. This is a true accompaniment to go with your drinks.  We didn't order much food as we were in a hurry, but the fish sliders served with wedges were sumptuous and had a good portion size.

Overall, had a lovely evening with light music, perfect ambience and pleasing service. 

Drop by after work for a few drinks, or plan for a date night! 

Wish they had pizza on their menu though!

Food is average. Very less variety, so it takes you a hell lot of time to decide what to have. The alcohol is slightly overpriced as they only serve pint beers and 1 pint of Carlsberg light costed 200+.
It does not have any air-conditioned seating, only outdoor seating area. So it is basically pretty hot in there. 
All in all was an average place, as it goes down on the expectations

Upon visiting kolkata on work , tried this new roof top cafe at The Astor on Shakespeare Road and I must say the entire experience was amazing. Tried a few items and highly recommended 
Grilled Parmesan chicken and Mutton Taco ...
Well stocked Bar adds up to the heritage charm ...
I got hooked on Vodka Sour 😊
A chilled out place you wish to visit again and again ....

Walking into this place is a great feeling, because the decor and feel is great.
The food is also good, and old Astor fact. Always had great kababs.

But frank facts, they need to work a bit on the price factor. It's high.

What irked me, and does often, is that they didn't have any beer apart from corona.
Not that price was my only factor against that, but also because i simply wanted a basic beer. And a price more reasonable.
And a draft in this ambience would've been amazing.

New outlet in town located inside a well known Hotel in Kolkata - The Astor
Its an Open Air restaurant and looks really good with good music and fantastic ambiance. 
List of Cocktails and Mocktails served over here are impressive. Tried 5-6 different types of mocktail. Martini was nicely made. Food was also good specially the burgers. Astor is famous for kebabs and Deck 88 didn't dissapoint me at all. 
A must try place.

The ambiance is just amazing, good music, amazing decor, and lovely cocktails 

We ordered classic mojito and Long Island both of which were amazing. 

If someone is a fan of masala chips of csc , you must order one here. You will forget csc

We ordered a tandoori platttet which was amazing, just that it was not warm as I would have liked 

For mains we ordered Thai curry which was also good

Overall brilliant food, good cocktails and amazing decor. To top it all not expensive at all.

We ordered Greek meat balls and beers.. the food was not that great still the rest covered up for everything.. it was indeed a very nice place to just sit and chill and have a nice chat.. definitely going to recommend it to others..
The server informed us that this place had just opened last month , wish they continue to be warm and appealing..

Terrible behavior of attending waiter and even Manger as they simply denied to serve even chilly with food and drinks ordered citing management rules.. Cancelled the order and we went down to the good old Astor bar below to enjoy our evening..

Wonder if this is indeed going to ever be a 365 days place, mainly because humid summers in Calcutta and erratic monsoon will eat up 7 months of the calendar year, that gives the place at the most 5 months to run full house if so. 

At the outset, the backdrop of Astor hotel gives it a rich ambience. The deck up is truly good and gives a feeling of novelty in an otherwise dull city. The most attractive part is live DJ all evening with an open to air Bar and lots of seating. Though the menu is not very comprehensive but it doesn't necessarily have to be. Portions not as small though. Would recommend the platter. 

Hospitality was good, ought to be to match up with its parent - the boutique Hotel Astor. Alcohol is priced slightly steep and that can keep many people away as there are places around the city where you get cheaper alcohol. You don't always have people arriving who don't care for the right column in the menu. 

All in all, it's a beautiful setup to be in. Cheers!
