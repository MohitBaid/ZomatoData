Was in picnic garden area for some work of mine ,and it was 3 pm in the noon . So i was hungry and wanted to try out Biryani only and not any other options available in the area. I checked out a few places but as it was the festival of EID ,all shops were shut because of celebrations at home however one place i came across was this small eating point called ARMAN BIRYANI  which had a small amount of people picking up food and also eating from inside with a few tables available there. I had asked for what was its speciality Biryani over here and the response came Chicken/Mutton . I got a nice aroma as the handi was opened for parcelling other people's orders and i saw the biryani to be yellow and white mix colour . The Chicken pieces were big enough and were looking very yummy ,as well as the Potato pieces were decent enough. I asked the person inside to pack  a few plates and without any delay he did that . 
After reaching my place i opened the packet and toppled in on my plate to start feasting on it. On taste i can say its good enough nothing great though but definitely for 65 rupees is worth the price as you get a wholesome filling on Chicken biryani . The Chicken piece was tender and nicely cooked along with that the Potato also was soft and well enriched with taste and not much oily or greasy overall . 
A eatable experience is what you get here so in 65 rupees your hunger can dissapear right here when you dont find any other option then these biryani places become a saviour .

Well, 1-2 years back they had totally degraded in quality and thus, I stopped buying from them, switching to Javed Biriyani which opened up near Kustia more, and served way better quality and quantity. Would not rate the shop more than 2/5 back then, but recently, Javed Biriyani was closed(for that day) and thus, I decided to buy from here, on my Special one's advise. Javed still serves better than Arman. 

Arman served dry saltless,tasteless rice, less in quantity. Now, they have improved. 
ORDERS:
3 Egg-Chicken Biryani (Rs70x3)
1 Chicken Biriyani (rs 60), because they had only 3 eggs left. It was past 9:10 pm.

Well cooked rice and the chicken was well cooked and tender as well but dry, your throat will dry up if you don't get a leg piece. The rice had the aroma of Biriyani and it just melts on your taste buds, if you are lucky to get the best at your time.  The egg was smaller than what we have at home, don't know why, but I've found this thing is most restaurants and outlets and the egg was a bit dry types, the white cover was somewhat like cardboard, but the rest was good.

This place is the nearest Biryani station from my living space. It held the brick to its foundation nearly one and half years ago, now it is flourishing its wings with time. It's walking distance from my place, but who is not familiar with this area, can notice this while passing the road. There did not install any dine in option yet, and I don’t know about the future. 

It is very compact and shabby place where you can see them cooking at first hours. But I must confess whenever I pass the course; my nostrils are excited by Biryani air particles. I did not know about this place, but my father bought me a packet while I noticed their name, and after a while I detected their outlet. And I eat that Chicken Biryani every now and then. 

I must mention this, as not very resourceful or noted in food business they are doing a quality job. You will not dig up any grease cuddling with your rice, or your fingers are drowning with fatty oil unlike the famed Biryani joints. The rice is very light and aromatic too. The chicken is well processed in spices and tender. I think they are serving worth food in terms of money. And they possess a ‘Handi’ of Biryani, they are fast with service too.
