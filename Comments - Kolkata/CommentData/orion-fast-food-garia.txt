Pocket friendly eatery in the area. Being very close to this place, i have been there several times, and everytime I had different experience ranging from amazing to terrible. Ordering from this place is like a gamble, sometime u might be amazed by the delicacies whereas next time u might be left extremely disappointed...but worth taking risk....so hope for the best bt be ready for the worst.. :-)

Sound food at a cheap rate and also the reception is also good. Best place for a sudden planned dine out with friends. I refer this restaurant to everyone around garia & narendrapur.

Stick to the snacks over here. The Biriyani could kill you !!This was the nearest food outlet to my apartment at a time and have had the chance to sample the offerings once in a while. Take my word for it.

Plain bad. Ordered chicken roll, chicken moghlai and chow. Well, the chicken roll had 3-4 specks of chicken, few threads of onion and it was so thin that the paratha was rolled over itself. It was cold and just a whole lot of half cooked maida. Absolutely the same experience with the moghlai paratha with an alu sabji which had panch phoron (?!). The chow was sweet! (?!). Everything kinda went into the dustbin and we were a group of foodies who gobble up everything. The order came an hour after we called and we stay about 400-500mtrs away. Not ordering again. :(

Pocket friendly place serving good food. Have tried many items but found Laccha Paratha and Roasted Chicken the best. Stuck to Tried and Tested items for dinner....Its all well that ends well...

Had a Chicken Egg Roll. The base was so sweet that we had to leave it half finished. Also have my doubts on the hygiene standards followed by them.

As it's close to my house I have visited this place many times. You can judge it as a snacks bar. At first the quality of food was awful but by time they improved themselves a lot. Now you can have a roll or a chow from it. It doesn't test that bad. Here you can get icecream too.

Simple affair and a neighbourhood outlet . Some.of the Chinese dishes are above average I would reckon. A handu outlet if you are staying at kamalgazi to npur stretch. If u ever come visit this place will definitely walk in .

Being close to my home, I have visited this place a number of times. The service is very slow even for fast food items. Chicken Manchurian and chilli chicken is worth trying. The paneer items are not good at all. The usp of this place is low cost. Visit this place if pocket pinch is an issue.
