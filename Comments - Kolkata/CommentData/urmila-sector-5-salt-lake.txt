Located in sector v, salt lake near the building of RS Software this place serves both indian and Chinese items....

Area is good enough so that almost 80 people can seat easily....

Visited the place last Friday with my colleagues for lunch...

We ordered 5 plates of mixed fried rice, 3 plates of chilly chicken and one fish thali....

Mixed fried rice : Quantity is enough for one person and quality is good...price 144/plate

Chilly chicken : 4 piece per plate is really surprising for us....not so good....boneless 144 and withbone 120 per plate....

Fish thali : It contains rice, daal, 2 types of sabji, fish curry and pickle...good in 120....

The thing that disappointed us most was there service....we had wait for a long time after placing the order....once they gives us other ones food accidentally...after 5 minutes they took the food from our table and serve it to its original owner....they were always confused with the orders and management skills is poor....

No extra gst chargeable.....

Not recommended....

Had gone to Rotary Netralay for eye check up ,so this place was just near by. Me and my Husband were a bit hungry but it was passed lunch time so we ordered two club sandwich , a chicken 65 and a sweet corn soup. None of the food was good, taste was below ordinary. The sandwich was so hard that upper gum in the mouth got swollen( in bengali i.e. tagra chule gelo) . Bad experience. Don't want to go back.

We took paneer butter masala, paneer dopyaza, tadka and veg Kolhapuri yesterday. We were the last customers of the day. We ate it just after 30 mins and found out that food delivered was stale. All those who ate had an upset stomach. So will never eat from this outlet again.

Simple restaurant with good food and polite staff. The food quality is good and is great for your pocket too. We ordered fried rice and chilli garlic chowmein. The chowmein was very oily and tasted so so.
Fried rice was good with lots of veggies to go along with. To drain all the stuff we had jaljeera, which was a thirst quencher in the end.

Urmila is a decent joint for office goers. Only good thing about them is they make thali items daily that does not upset your tummy. They make veg, fish and chicken thali. Thali contains two types of veg items, one fry, dal, chutney and the fish or chicken item. Taste wise its ok type not to be gaga about. 
Apart from the thali item they do serve Chinese, north indian and continental but I don't liked it. 
For your daily meal i mean thali items  you can trust them

Based on a Sunday visit to one restaurant in the same locality, I feared the worst here too. To my surprise, we were greeted in an empty restaurant the same way we would have been greeted on a normal working day. The proprietar sitting on the counter was courteous, also our server was warm and friendly. The decor is simple with Lord Ganesha's beautiful statue in the middle of the room. Amazing fish satisfied our craving for Kolkata delicacy. Must visit for some yummy dishes and delightful service.

We went there yesterday i.e. on Sunday. We had some examination there. So after giving the examination, we were hungry and decided to go there. The worst decision we made.
The price is a bit higher but the quality and the quality is very poor. We had Tandoor Roti with Butter, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Egg Chowmein and Egg Chicken Fried Rice. The tandoori roti was ok, but the chicken tikka butter masala was 3rd class. They used the chicken pieces of kebabs. And the gravy was soo less that we ran out of gravy before finishing 6 tandoori rotis. So never ever think of ordering this.
Now coming to the Egg Chowmein. It was more or less ok. But we had to search for the egg. Now you can imagine it.
The egg chicken fries rice was again worse. Paying Rs.70 for egg chowmein is far better than paying Rs. 100 for this. The quantity was less and quality wasn't that good enough. 
So yes, our money was gone and we were still hungry.

So I won't recommend you to go there and have anything what we had. Instead try the biriyani. I saw that the quantity is better, still don't have any idea about the quality.

This perhaps is one of the oldest restaurant in Sector v area and I remember visiting this outlet with a friend years ago. We were waiting for another friend to join us and thus ordered a coffee and a cold drink. What makes this place different from other restaurants is there are waitresses who serve food here. Located beside the Hridayalaya hospital this place is filled with people throughout the day. They serve thalis at a decent rate making it easier for patients and their families to satiate their hunger within the hospital premises. 
Years later I went to this outlet again with my husband and we tried a chicken thali. It was quite filling but the taste was nothing great. I cannot say that it is a great place for foodies to try out. An average place that serves all kinds of food at a reasonable rate. If you are in the office area and want to go out for lunch here please ensure you reach early to grab a seat and also to avail the items mentioned in the menu.

This is a place well apt for the office goers bored of daily home lunch and craving for something from the restaurant. Located in sector 5 with numerous high profile restaurants, this place always draws people with its variety menu and homely environment. The seating and ambience is quite general with normal service. The USP of the place is it's costing. Quality food at a very reasonable price is what drags people to this outlet. Worth a place for a hungry stomach bored of official duties.

Have been reading mixed reviews about this place, which happens to be 5 minutes walk from my office. So thought of trying out their Chinese food one afternoon. The prices seem quite reasonable, but quality not good at all. Indian style chinese preparations. The Mixed fried rice had just about okay quantity, and the chicken pieces in the rice were extremely hard and had flour coating on them. Understood they were frozen, and not fresh. Garlic fish was not great either. It's like mediocre food at moderate prices.

A very busy restaurant during day time. A lot of seats available but hardly any free, which tells you this is a popular eating joint. All women staff. Hardly any decoration inside. The restaurant space is L shaped. On one length, the airconditioning is done properly and the other half is too hot, as it has only one airconditioner. Lighting is a problem. Need to install more lights. Service is an issue. Takes a lot of time to serve food. It's an one-time try restaurant.

Coming to the food,they do have a lot of varieties to their menu.

We ordered : Tangree kebab, Masala papad, Plain rice, Fish kalia, Egg Curry and Mutton curry.

Quality of food was very good and also the place was very clean.
Prices were on the cheaper side and the staffs were very courteous..

This eatery is situated within the Rotary Narayana Hospital campus in Sector 5. There is nothing very fancy about this place. But a good option to have hygienic lunch or breakfast during office hours at reasonable price. There are innumerable items mentioned on the menu cards but all are not equally tasty.
Alu paratha with raita is a must try item. It is available only for breakfast. During lunch time various types of kulchas are available. Mutton and Chicken side dishes are delicious and go well with Kulcha or Pulao. Chinese items should be avoided by people like me who are extremely taste sensitive otherwise its edible. Veg and non veg thalis are available but the rice is little inferior in quality. Inspite of all its pros and cons the place happens to be extremely popular in the area and its very difficult to get a table during peak hours.

Well, we all know of Urmila Matondkar – the 90’s beauty who had stolen quite a heart too many – but atleast not mine. But, today, I found another Urmila which did manage to impress me a lot – but this one’s a restaurant which is conveniently situated at a stone’s throw distance from my office, near R S Software building.

Area of the restaurant is huge – may be 50 + can be accommodated in it – the place being divided into 2 sections – with 2 entrance/ exit gates. Some minimal décor can be seen at the entrances. I started with a cream of tomato, which was served in 10-12 minutes, but was more of a tomato “ketchup” soup – all I could taste in it was sauce. Some mildly fried crotons were floating atop along with cream. Thereafter, I opted for their Veg Thali – 1 of the most economical in pan Sector 5 – priced at mere 60 bucks – and indeed a show stopper! It was served in a minute or two, consisting pickles, fried papadum, aloo patal, dal fry, rice and aloo kumra. I ordered a roasted papad as extra. Food was nice – both from the quality and quantity perspective – they allowing 1 extra serve of both – dal as well as rice. Nice to see that rice quality was fine – although thali is meagrely priced. Both the mains as well as daal were fine, subject to the fact that patal used was overripe. Pickles went very nice with rice mixed with daal and sabji!

Service is nice – but very sloppy as the attendant spilled water while serving as well as rice while refilling – definitely need to be more careful. Ambience is below average – and you get the feeling of sitting inside a Government eatery. Nevertheless, this place enjoys a nice share in the Sector 5 lunch market – cleanly evidenced by the countless customers.

The place is very decently decorated and fuss free... Coming to the food.. They do have a lot of varieties and since we were very, very hungry.. One of us ordered a simple chicken chow n two of us took non veg American chopsuyes...well chow was very good given the price but chopsuey could have been better... The prices are quite low... A not so bad go to place for sure!!!

Because of its name I could not think it would be a restaurant, yesterday thought to try it. 
Location : near RS software building lane
Ambiance : average, restaurant was quite dark
No proper AC
Service : all waiters were ladies, we reached just before peak hours so for us service is quick. 
Food : we ordered veg thali, one fish item, prawn sahi masala, choco maniya and tooth fruity ice cream. 
Quantity wise okay, I would say one dish can be share by two easily except thali. 
Quality is also good, don't expect anything special, good for basic food only. 
Price : they have revised their prices on all items(10/20/30), it's not updated in zomato. But anyway after this revision too price is very cheap and pocket friendly, they don't add service tax and vat. I think they have already included it in each item. 
We were three people and our total bill was 610 only. 
So recommended for basic food only :)

There is nothing fancy about this place. But if you are looking for a simple, unpretentious restaurant which serves good food at very reasonable prices, then this is the place for you. No matter what you order from the menu, be it soups, sandwiches, noodles, butter naan or roll, you are not likely to be disappointed. One problem with this place is that food quality can vary a lot from day to day. Still, in my opinion this is the best value for money restaurant in Sector V.

I went to this place last thursday at around 1 pm in the afternoon. The name really rose suspicions about the ambience of the hotel but it is a homely clean hotel where you can have good lunch.It is quite close to my office next to the rotary hospital. We made a good decision to arrive @ 1pm else from 1:30 pm - 2:30pm the place gets really crowded. All the waiters were girls .. felt very nice seeing that. Me and my senior didi ordered one plate Tangri Kabab which had 2 orange Tangri Kababs size was quite decent and taste quite nice. Then we ordered chicken egg fried rice with chilly chicken. For girls I would say one plate is enough for two. The fried rice turned out to be good but the chilly chicken still needs lot of improvement. Its not that spicy a little runny in consistency. But the 4 chicken pieces were nice and big not much cornflour coated. Next we had a sweet lime soda 1/2. But the ice cream was damn cheap. For Rs 60 we had a tall glass full of Tutty Fruity ice-cream with strawberry chocolate and vanilla ice-cream topped with strawberry sauce decent number of raisins and some cashews. I really liked the place for a quick lunch. Total time taken was only half an hour. Amount is good. Don't expect mind-blowing taste but it is decent. They have everything in menu and very cheap.Our Total bill was only 380. Next time I plan to try indian dishes.

P.S - They give lunch delivery but the manager requested it should be done before 12 o'clock. You can also have your home made lunch here along with some dishes that you ordered there. I saw lots of people doing that.

I went there today around 6 pm with a friend. There were only 5 customers except us. But they came to us after 15 minutes to take the order. But courtesy of staffs was good.

Now come to the decor. Some balloons of our flag's colour were hanging from ceiling as today is Independence Day. Lightening was pretty good. But Floor, table and glass were not properly clean. Menu book was also dirty.
For Decor: 3/5
After waiting more 15 minutes the order came to us. The quantity of food was huge. But taste and presentation were not good enough. And some foods were a little bit salty.

Maa Urmila is the eating area connected with the Rotary Hospital in sector 5. It is an ac restaurant open for all. The place is clean and big with many tables. The food here is very cheap and tasty. The staff are helpful. We had chicken 65,mixed gravy chowmein,mixed fried rice,chicken schwezwan and choco mania. The pocket pinch was only 440 bucks. They serve food in very good portions. But,the only drawback about their food is the chicken is very stiff. Anyway, I would like to visit this eatery to have their indian cuisine next time. :)

Food : Decent fare - both in non-veg and veg. Especially for vegetarians, some items are really good - the bengali mixed-veg, paneer do piazza and Channa Masala. Since it is a co-operative run alongside the canteen of Rotary Hospital, the food is served fresh.
Service - One of the few places in Kolkata to have waitresses. The staff is courteous and mostly get your orders quickly.
Ambiance - Drab, but then it is expected from a place which is an extension of a hospital's canteen. The name is also a dampener when suggesting to friends.

Pros - Good food at Reasonable prices, Great location (close to RS software), can ask to modify the dishes according to special needs
Cons - Avoid chinese since they put too much ketchup, Breakfast gets over really fast, Huge crowd at lunch time.

PS- was my regular haunt when I lived in Salt Lake.
Edit- they've recently upgraded their menu (read: raised prices) However we had 2 veggies, 5 Roti's, 2 lime sodas and still got away with 270 bucks. 
            

PPS - They have changed the name from "Maa Urmila" to "Urmila" now. So, earlier rant about name doesn't apply any more.

As we had breakfast ,lunch, evening snacks and dinner all there for 5-6 days  It was unbeliveble that the food quality was very good ,rates were very reasonable and the service was just gr8.The staff were giving the feeling as they were serving own family. Always with a smile on their face even in very odd hours. As we all had veg meal  bhindi masala, nan, dal  ,tandoori ,rice  veg jhal frezi evrythng was good . Masala papad, tea and vegetable pakora were just awesome.Very much impressed with the staff. Hats off.

This place is very close to my office and thus one day we all decided to try out the food here, We ordered a total bengali meal, rice, daal, maach er kalia, aloo bhaja and the food was very good. The fish kaalia was really very good. However, on a second visit to this place, we had ordered a lot of various things, i actually dont even remember the names and the experience was not really a good one. So as a thumb rule i have decided that the place is really good for basic cuisines but its a risk to experiment here.

I was introduced not to the restaurant, but to its food a year & a half back when my workplace used to be at Merlin Infinite. I ain't much of a tiffin person so used to just carry homemade lunch on four out of six working days. My seniors as well as colleagues had told me about the quality this place serves and thus, on the other two days, I used to send the office staff to get parcels from here (Maa Urmila) or Rang De Basanti Dhaba (earlier Azad Hind Dhaba). I have always been a lover of Dal and Paneer, so used to stick to these two only along with breads (on shuffle mode :p). 

- Dal Tadka: Had a thicker consistency and was delicious. 
- Dal Makhani: Always used to come with a dollop of butter on top. Tasted great.
- Paneer Butter Masala: Used to have a slightly high dose of turmeric in it. But, decent in taste.
- Butter Naan: Soft and fluffy. 
- Masala Kulcha: Flavorful filling with a slight brush of butter on top. 
- Tandoori Roti: Since, used to be a parcel, lacked the crispness, but, never was it chewy.

The staff used to take around twenty minutes to return back with the parcel, so just a deduction that the service speed at the restaurant would be decent.

Yummy food, tummy good! :)

Apart from slightly overpriced menu this is a good place to have a decent regular meal in case if you are in lower Sector-5 area. The thalis sucks bdway, don't even bother.

Some friends were going gaga about this place and we thought of exploring this place in today's lunch! I was a little apprehensive, because of the name of the restaurant.. but today's visit completely changed my view! 

The restaurant was full when we entered at around 1.30 pm.. and were seated in the only table available, luckily a 6-seater one! The menu consists both of Indian and 'Chineesse'(those funny spelling mistakes!!).. We ordered for Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Nun, Masala kulcha, Chicken Kasha, Chicken Punjabi, Plain Rice, Dal Fry, Mutton Kasha, Masala papad and Mixed Fried Rice.

The kabab was served by 5minutes.. decent 6 pieces.. served with onion and cucumber.. also with a green chutney.. Chicken pieces were soft.. the chutney over-smelt of mint, but tasted good.. Next came the masala papad.. And I absolutely adored this dish! Masala papad fried and served with salad all over.. looked like small pizzas! With the right balance of spices , it tasted great!

The main course arrived.. The Chicken Kasha tasted good.. not very spicy, but the authentic bengali chicken kasha.. went very well with nun and kulcha. Chicken punjabi was even better.. as the chicken pieces were tandoori chicken.. and the gravy contained loads of capsicum which gave it a peppery flavour which we all loved! The mutton kasha was equally good.. The Dal fry was just a plate of boiled dal, with very less amount of tadka but went well with plain rice. The Mixed Fried Rice tasted okay.. but the amount of chicken, prawn, egg was just commendable! 

We oredred for a Tutty Fruity to end our awesome meal! 3 big scoops with fruits, raisins and strawberry sauce.. too good for a roadside joint..!

All these in just 870/-! We were super satisfied! Highly recommended!

Amazing place!! Looks normal but if you want to have good food then this is surely the place meant for you!! They provide rich thalis at a very affordable amount of money!! The place is simply awesome!! So awesome that if you are visiting the hotel at lunch hours then you might have to wait a while to get a seat but trust me the wait is totally worth it!!

This place is DA BOMB. First off, this is the Rotary Narayana Hospital's internal canteen that they're running as a full fledged restaurant. It's absolutely the best place if you're looking for healthy, filling lunch options in this part of Sector 5, and an absolute godsend if you're a sandwich-and-soup lunch person like me. And it's not like any of their offerings are bland and sawdusty, it's tasty, filling, good stuff. I'd been falling quite sick living off average Sector 5 lunch options, so I'm overjoyed at having discovered Maa Urmila and their amazing food.

I just hopped into this place just to have ice cream and to my surprise this place offered certainly a good amount of satisfaction for me as I ordered two ice creams in a bowl full of three scoops each with a lot of dry fruits chipped,wafers and chocolate sauce along with it all for just Rs - 60 each.
My verdict -
Seriously for 60 bucks where you will get a bowl full of ice cream or rather dessert type in a restaurant ?? Its awesome

Food quality is good at reasonable price. 
We mainly ordered Tandoor roti, chicken kadai, Egg chowmin, Veg fried rice and chili chicken. The taste of chicken kadai is mush good and quantity is sufficient for each one. All items are prepared with less spice and good for taste. 
I recommend.

A perfect place to have lunch if your office is near this place in sector 5. Very delicious food with very very affordable price. Chinese is average but Indian food is much better than expected. 

They do have quick service even though they serve a large number of customers at once. Tandoori roti and veg koftas are my favorite here.

Warning (on my experience):
Do not try crispy babycorn here, they made it hard rock by over cooking.

Do not expect AC to be very effective.

If u have your office near by then do drop by and try this outlet. Not very costly and some place which can be visited regulary. Not a posh restaurant with fantastic ambience but i do love the food. Service could be faster. The chinese is good and decent so is the indian. Also has options for veg and non veg thali which you can try if u want basic food. Serves good indian as well so non veg and veg both are good. Strongly recommend

The restaurant is quite good, if you visit here in the noon you won't find a empty table as it will packed with office people. The food is good, try the kebabs here.

this is Friday lunch destination from office. Do not expect it to be some posh restaurant in sector five but the place albeit all the chaos and noise serves delectable platter at affordable range. From thalis to kebabs, from jeera rice to Chinese, you wish and they serve.If you visit them in summers do not forget to treat yourself with thanda nimbu paani and banana splits.
We mainly order Chicken reshmi butter masala with roti and jeera rice with kebabs and tikkis, but you can also try out their Chinese platter that comes in huge quantity, quite commendable for two people.

Happy stomach, happy me :)

In search of veg thali with less quantity and price, reached Ma Urmila well in dinner time but surprised to see empty restaurant. Set up was like middle range dining places-transparent glass dining table with transparent glass plates for food was something first time seen in restaurant. 
Our orders were limited by limited options available at the time. Not many options for veg starters, no chaas (buttermilk) led to order of veg cream soup with masala papad followed by dal butter fry and veg kadai with butter nan (heavy thick) again no option of regular chapati. 
Taste of veg dishes was good and portions also reasonable to full stomach. No need to order rice. Prepared with less spice was good for taste. 
Economic, clean food experience left satisfied visit.

What a chef! What a place to eat!

I am amazed by the taste of food at this place. I must say that the Chef is a star. The restaurant should retain the chef by any means.

Loved the behavior of he staffs. They are way better than many renowned restaurants around city. The ambiance of this restaurant is totally Bengali which  i personally love because now all the restaurants are running behind western or Chinese style, it has got bored.

The food quality i.e the oil used is superb.

I had breakfast for 4 times, lunch for 7 times, dinner twice at this place. The Thalis are awesome, Chicken tandoori, tandoori roti are also must haves. The size of the roti surprised me.

In the end i want to mention that with all the possible qualities maintained, the price is very very reasonable, i wouldn't mind paying 50% extra for this quality and tasty food any where. But they are happy with the price which also surprises me a lot.

Thanks to the Management of this restaurant for offering us so great food. You guys rock.

Given the location I would really recommend visits to this place.It is clean and airconditioned and a welcome relief to the office crowds on workdays.Food is quite good.The kebabs definitely deserve mention.Chinese is also ok though we find the preparations to have bit higher quantities of salt.They however accept to reduce it if mentioned while placing the order.Chicken side dishes however fail to get differentiated since Garlic chicken tastes similar to Sweet and Sour chicken.But given the price,options,availability and service I would gladly overlook that :-)
For desserts choco mania is nice though I would've preferred to leave out kesar pista from the scoops.Tutty fruity is also deemed to be a speciality but it lacks fresh fruits.But at 80 rs I wouldnt still mind it.

went to sector 5 for some work and found out this place. seemed quite new. the most surprising thing we saw here was the waitresses were dressed up like the IT sector employees with id cards :-P its an average eatery and the price is way cheaper than the other joints out here. we had kebab,tandoori roti,chicken tikka butter masala and cold drinks.one can have a quick bite over here if you are visiting the area for some work.
