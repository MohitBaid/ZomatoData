Lot of improvement needed in almost every aspect. Only positive thing here is the view from the top. Nothing apart from the view is worth a word. You just cannot afford to have that kind of attitude just bcoz of the view ...Quality Food & Prompt Service is the primary thing that a customer looks for and Ozora miserably fails in both. It seems that the management till date is thoroughly confused about the policy matters since the service staffs & manager comes up with different answers everytime on a same issue. Staffs have no idea about the availability of items mentioned in the menu. They go to the manager....manager in turn goes to the kitchen...and by the time the manager returns the service guy is taking order at other table.....its full on mess !!
A must avoid place unless u want to spoil your day

This place is only good for view and the location of the restaurant.
Food and service both sucks to the core.
Too expensive and least worth spending.
Waiter behaviour sucks and as well as we make better hokkah at home than what they serves.lol

Well i went there with my three friends, one girl who is my good friend and two male friends, initially had to face some idiots at the front desk, they said stags are not allowed, but i called up earlier before reaching there, and i was not informed regarding the same, so after reaching there, they were saying this stupid indian things that Stags are not allowed..now this was not not acceptable by me..I wish to live a single life, so...where on earth, we have such laws or any such article in the book of our Constitution..Just because my other two friends who didnt come with a girl,the front desk girl from north east i believe was being hardheaded about this. I tried to explain them that it is not about entering here, i dont care anways but it is just i wasted my time coming all the way here and i have a guest from a foreign country, he must be feeling bad about this and it doesn't look right..But she was rigid to her decision. Now at 8:40pm, from where on earth i am going to get girls for my friends, one of my friend is single , even i am single , it is just a girl who is just my friend came to meet me and my other friend who is 53yrs old, Thai National, still single...Now what?
But i believe the floor manager who came to talk to me as i was very upset as i wasted my time..But he heard what i had to say , remained calm and understood the situation and after a little bit of arguments, the manager or the supervisor made it smooth and easy for us from there on and i was thankful to him for not being an obnoxious person , he said some private party was going on at the terrace, however almost all the seats were reserved but the manager managed the table for us and he definitely understood my situation, so no complaints, as he managed the whole situation easily. But this is what we had to face being stags..I understand some clubs, lounge has different rules but atleast the staff should inform that on call, if someone calls for some enquiry and is coming and already asking about the events for the tonight and so.. Driving in Kolkata is already a mess and now after reaching somewhere u get to hear, bro u cant enter, get a gf first, i am just saying....No Way...I value my time...
Anyways nevermind, afterwards the experience was really good.
The place has really nice ambience and good sober crowds. Winter season is the best to enjoy the rooftop open terrace party. We were total 4 people, charged 1000 Rupees per head to enter. We had almost everything,ate like apes and drank like there is no tommorow. Bill came to 21,595 Rupees that includes Alcohol. Just one little information to the management and to the front desk receptionist that in Kolkata or in India, not everyone has a gf and it is not necessary to have a gf in my life, one can remain single and enter as stags and spend more than bunch of couples can do..Who knows..Right? So be good and be soft on stags too..I am not rating you down as i believe some training to the ladies who were at the counter can help and make this a better place.  Food was excellent and made me happy and so do all the male staff whose behavior were really nice  and polite..Overall i am Happy with the Rest of the Service so do my friends..So no further Complaints or anything..It is just my feedback..

View of Kolkata frm 20th floor.... That is the USP of the place... Very nice ambience specially the open terrace really is great(cover charge of Rs1000 per head needed).... So 5 star on that front.. Few very place in Kolkata to beat that(only can think of Blue & beyond in esplanade) 
Now coming to the food... That is where don't expect much.... Wont say the food is bad but it is average specially given the price they charge...have been twice in the place but I dont remember name of any dish.... Also my friends ordered LIT and othr cocktail.... Those r also not vry good and tasted more like mocktail.... 
But overall if u want njoy with ur friends in a nice place u can definitely visit the place

The food and drink is upto the mark, the ambience in the open air space is worth mentioning. What needs to be improved is by training the staff. The staff are not courteous especially the ladies at the desk. If someone can ignore the impolite behaviour of the staff there then one can consider the place.

only thing that's great about this place is the ambiance. the open rooftop of Acropolis was really something. but evrything else was trash. especially the music. and the price.. well.. excessively overpriced, even taking into the fact that bar is at the 20th floor of a renowned mall with a awesome view. overall, if u have deep pocket u can check out the place once or twice just for the view.

Overall good experience with exceptional service!

One of the other restaurants trying to build a reputation for itself in the Kasba area is Ozora on the top of Acropolis Mall. This is one high end restaurant for your important food over business meet, family dinners, parties and expensive date nights that'd never go wrong, added to which is the prospect of rooftop dining in one of the tallest buildings in the area.

Yes, the place serves hookah and alcohol and seats around 60 inside and 60 outside (may be more, definitely not less). Upon entering the Acropolis Mall it might be a bit tricky to find your way up, there're different elevators to reach the 20th floor from different levels. What I may suggest if you're bringing a personal vehicle, is you could park your car in the basement and use the elevator that takes you directly to the 20th floor right away. It's always safer to make a pre booking and reservation, although we didn't. The seating inside has wooden chairs and tables or you may seat yourself on the sofa with your gang. There's the entrance, the reception and a mini bar on one side and the other side opens out to the rooftop. False ceiling, large glass windows and decorative lighting gives the restaurant a classy feel. The rooftop is decorated with a wooden flooring, indoor plants and white chairs and tables. The balcony overlooks a mesmerizing view of the southern part of Kolkata city which looks even better at night with the sparkling glow of city lights.

We entered the restaurant pretty late at night at around 10pm when most of the customers inside were almost done with their dinner, so we seated ourselves comfortably. There was quite a nightlife vibe with the DJ playing dance music. It was pretty chilly outside on the rooftop on a winter evening but there still were a lot of customers till midnight. I liked the fashioning of tall glasses in which they served water. A waitress handed over a tabloid for us to decide on the menu.

I must say we took quite some time to summarise the order to the waitress, but she served relatively quickly considering it was almost midnight and there were only two or three waiters waiting on the rest of the customers. We started off with Sweet Corn Chicken soup, on a suggestion because the sea food options weren't available. This was followed by appetisers: Chicken Olivetti and Grilled Fish with Caper Butter Sauce. Both the dishes were served on small rectangular plates. They were neatly organised considering colours and patterns on the plate, but, in my opinion, the portions for the price wasn't reasonable. The Grilled Fish was very well cooked and was soft to bite. It tasted even better with the yellow lemon caper sauce topped on it. Chicken Olivetti was stuffed pieces of chicken served with minced slices of beet and olives on the side. There were five pieces on the plate and the dish was really well prepared and served.

We ordered mocktails and Red Bull as we waited for the main course to arrive. Fresh Lime Soda was just perfect and Willy Orageio was a pleasant surprise. The latter was a nice spicy mix of oranges, apples and cranberries served in a 200 ml glass with ice cubes, it was moderately sweet. The main course arrived in about 20 minutes or so. We ordered platters: Chicken Gorgonzola and again upon suggestions, the much acclaimed Scottish Salmon. Chicken Gorgonzola was a reasonable piece of sliced chicken breast served with white pasta sauce, mashed potatoes and veggies. The chicken was nice and tender. It tasted better with pasta sauce and mashed potatoes. I could hint a taste of spinach, delicious cheese, black pepper and olive oil. The veggies weren't sliced into smaller pieces which made it difficult to slice it up on the plate. Overall it was a remarkable gustatory experience.

From Italy we flew right into the heart of Scotland when we ordered the Scottish Salmon. By a clear look of it we figured out why it was one of the most expensive dishes on the menu. It was an explicitly designed Salmon Steak served with boiled potato, beet and beans, and charred lime and a charred salmon fin on top. On the side of the plate was yellow pasta sauce. Decoratively they had put a slice of beet in between two circular slices of boiled potatoes and a bean on top. The Salmon Steak was peach and orange in colour and looked surreal on the dish. Upon slicing it up I realised how tender it is and it felt juicy and delicious to taste with a hint of lemon juice once I took a bite of it, an absolute culinary perfection. It was just adequately cooked, and didn't feel raw at all. It wasn't over cooked either, tasting so different and better with sauce and salad. There is not a Salmon of doubt that this is one of the most heavenly dishes I have tried, and is totally worth the price and patience.

Here I must mention, that the place has an exquisite looking menu with Indian, Oriental, Pizzas, Breads, Sandwiches, Risottos and many more options to chose from. From my personal experience, it clearly hasn't left a room for complaint against the menu, ambience or service. With several alcoholic options, hookah and a vibrant nightlife, this place has a lot of reasons to return time and again. The price is steep with the initial cover charge but the experience is worth it as there is something for everyone's taste and liking, which is very favorable for large groups.

Adieu!

The moment you enter, the ambience feeds on you. Even in October it felt cold, 20 floors above the hustle bustle of the city this is a place to visit and it should definitely be on your list but not for the food. Food is average. The ambience will blow your mind but the food will not take you back but if hookah and snacks is what you care most about than nothing beats this place.

We ordered to salty mango mocktail followed by chilli paneer and veg fried rice along with two scoops of Choco vanilla ice cream. I would like to mention that the quality of the food is worst.

A pathetic experience over there. It's okk when you open a restaurant on the 20th floor. But it doesn't mean you can charge anything. The rooftop is the only reason for the experiment. Each and every item is overpriced. A simple hookah costs 1000 Rs. A pint of beer starts from 350/- even if it's kingfisher. Coming to the music... Literally they played pathetic musics which makes you feel depressed as well as frustrated. The staffs are so fast...that they only took 20 mins to come up with the bill. Thanks to you and the management.

I was amazed to see such a huge open space converted into a resto bar and that too of this quality in Kolkata. Really well done,almost has the looks of the roof top bars I've been to in London or Singapore. So the standards of the place is really good. The view is excellent and on breezy evenings it is a perfect spot

What we Ordered:

-Dal Makhni Tartlets : I don't like fusion food at all. Dal Makhni is for naan and should not be messed around with

-Pan Tossed Mushrooms: it's what the name suggests and it was decent

-Jiaozi Chicken : perfectly crisped up and spiced. Really liked this. Went excellent with the cold beer and the breezy winter evening.

The service was good overall although the crowd seemed a little underwhelming. The music playing was great so kudos to the DJ on the console

Really bad bad service, we were sitting in the restaurant where only one steward was there to serve us , we literally had to call the steward and place the order. After 40 mins of placing the order when we asked about the food they said there was a ticketing problem and the food wasn’t ordered to the  kitchen. After all the harassment when we got the food there was no one to serve us water. The management really need to look into the service seriously as we had asked two to three people for the order but everyone seemed to be confused with serving water and even taking order.The steward asked us  to make place on the table to serve food as he was carrying food for two tables, it seemed like he was obliging us by atleast serving us the food which even came after 1 hour.
The food was good though but it really spoiled our night. This kind of service make a bad name for the place like this.
A big thumbs down as we were really disappointed.

✓Chicken tikka meat ball tart
✓Sound of sea(fish fry)
✓Mishti doi cheesecake(was perfect one)
Service was good. But prices are bit high. This place is a must visit place apart from their food the ambiance is mind blowing.

The prices are in the higher side but considering the ambience and the food quality I did not mind paying.

Today I visited this much hyped restaurant located on the 20th floor of Acropolis mall. To enjoy the outdoor seating and view they charge a cover charge of 1000 per head. It is redeemable by ordering food but not refundable. We ordered G-string and mojito. Both were refreshing. We ordered Grilled fish in caper butter sauce and Moroccan chicken and mixed Hakka noodles. We also ordered jalapeño poppers but the waiter suggest a mushroom dish to try instead and it was very bad. Very bad suggestion I must say. The grilled fish was  melt in your mouth delicious. Moroccan chicken was okayish. The quantity of Hakka noodles was on the lower side and the flavours wasn't that great.. was okayish as well. The view however is amazing and the weather got really chilly adding to the atmosphere along with the music playing in the background. The service was slow at the beginning. They took a lot of time to serve the starters but after that it was fine. Overall a nice experience mainly owing to the amazing outdoor ambience of the place. The food can definitely do with some improvements.

Can't explain in words how great the view from the 20 floor is! We ordered a number of dishes republic of chicken, new age makhani, pork toichin and tianjin lamb. Pork was good. The one thing I disliked is the extremely loud noise. It was so breezy up above it would have been really great if it were calmer. It was like an open air club but i guess many people like it. We couldnt hear ourselves talking. I can go that place again for the view. <3 the other thing which was weird is the we had to give entry fee of 1000 which was later included in the total bill of food and alcohol. I found it meaningless. We ordered 4 main course and 5 beers. The bill was 4500. :o

For that perfect date... Complete with wine and choice of differently made food from all around the world... With the best view of EM Bypass from the 20th floor of Acropolis... Minus points for order delivery time...

This sky lounge bar is located on the 20th floor of Acropolis Mall. Its entrance is from the mall parking sides and has nothing to with the mall entrance. It takes a certain amount of cover charge which can be reedeemed while placing the order.

The ambience is simply awesome and a perfect place for a romantic date. Sitting arrangements are made for both indoor and outdoor. Food quality is good but the quantity is less. Hookahs are available. Prices of the of the food and the drinks are on the higher side.

Try to visit this place once during the evening as it gives an open view of the entire city clearly and can make you awestruck.

Ambience Ambience Ambience ! This should be enough to bring you to this joint. 
Perched on 20 floor of acropolis with a view to kill for.
Cocktails were good we had long island ice tea, mohito, daiquiri and cosmo and i am happy to say that all were good.

Surprisingly the starters were also top class which was a bit surprise since their food was getting lambasted on zomato.

Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable!

Defi going back !

Currently one of the best dine outs in Kolkata... Situated on the 20th floor of Acropolis with a jawdropping view of Kolkata's skyline and enthralling ambience and scrumptious platter to make your night....it is a must try for all food lovers..... It offers you a multi cuisine dining and being true to all its cuisines presents you the best of it.... It has both an open outdoor sitting area (strictly maintained for adults) and indoor dining space..... The place starts serving at 4pm which continues till midnight.... Live Music by Djs will surely groove you into a peppy mood and is one of the main highlights of the place... Simply naming some as best would be an injustice to the other dishes... However desserts here are a must!! Cost for 2 would be 2k approximately... But the supreme food quality is worth to be paid for.

Spectacular ambience & great view of the City of Kolkata. Service is exceptional & great music too. Enjoyed the drinks & pizzas with nice hookah. Pricing is slightly on the higher side but totally worth the visit.

Let's make one thing very clear, this place is not satisfactory! Not at all! Unless you are going for a date! The entire city view will surely melt her heart but alas the rest is all very disappointing!

Well let me start why: 'The service' were beyond horrible! They took 1 hour to...

Ozora made our day! I was looking for a nice rooftop cafe for a romantic meal. We went to Whatsup Cafe first at southern avenue and was majorly disappointed. Next stop was Ozora and it just made up for everything.

The view was breathtaking. The ambience , amazing. The food was lip smacking and pretty different too. What I loved the most was the service. There was no rush, no up-selling. Very polite and friendly people. I loved the privacy and the romantic ambience. It's great for friends too. I have recommended this place to so many people in person, on FB and in food groups of FB too lol. Just that the risotto the service person recommended was nice but with an Indian touch whereas we had stated that we wanted Conti. Other than that everything was great. Planning to visit again.

Unfortunately we went on a rainy day and weren't able to enjoy the 20th floor view. We ordered Valentino pizza and a beer. They charged service taxes separately, don't know why(they will inform you while entering) . I found nothing out of the box in that sense. Only thing is that you order over the tab.

The worst place I have ever visited.. Me and my friend went last night . At the reception they said for outside sitting INR 1000 per person for only entry free.We decided to seat inside . We ordered drinks but they said they did not have the stock.
We ordered starters but they did not have that also.
They have the stocks which cost more than 1200 bucks which is pathetic. The behaviour of the staffs where the worst..I would recommend not to visit the place.

Been on a Durga Pujo night to the rooftop option... ambience and music good, a wee bit on the louder side, however considering the Pujo mood , one enjoys ....Lighting could be improved at each table, as we could barely see what we were served..
Speaking of the Food... Indian items like Kadhai chicken were a let down...however the dish Republic of Chicken was a saving grace ! Mango mocktail was also good!
Creme brûlée is a thumbs up! 

Pls work on ur Indian dishes !

The place has an amazing view but they will charge you a cover of RS 1000 to sit outside in the open. Foods are with fancy name and garnishing but not really very tasty. Same is with the cocktails. The bar is pricey and not at all well stocked. It's so poorly stocked that they dont even have beers like Heineken. The ambience of the place is the only plus point. The staff is average, they dropped our servings even before arriving our table and blamed it on the heavy wind which is quite normal at the height of 20th floor. Subsequently, they didn't even bother to replenish. And they still charge a mandatory service charge of 10% which is against Govt and consumer forum order.  Potion of food is also not very good. Overall the place is unjustifiably pricy.

This should be at level -20

We always wanted to go to this place. As soon as we were entering they told us to pay a cover of a grand per head to sit outside. We told them that we really didn’t want to drink or eat much so there’s no point of taking the cover. They insisted that we have to pay and only then we shall be allowed. We said we’ll sit inside. Asked if we could go out and just check it out. They said only one person. We still went in and sat down to order. We weren’t that hungry and we decided to order a few drinks. When they said the drink I asked for was not in stock I told my folks let’s leave. Instantly the waiter was like Sir we do have it available. I was like okay. Get that. A bunch of other cocktails were ordered too and they didn’t deserve another round. But half their menu wasn’t available. We asked the manager what’s the point of paying a grand a person if you don’t have half the things on the menu, he replied “You give us the money, we’ll let you sit out”. We finished up quickly and left. 

PS: Don’t go. The staff is unreasonable and dumb. Didn’t try the food. But don’t want to either.

I visit kolkata very less these days as I stay in Bangalore aka pub capital of India. But I must say kolkata has come up with quite a few good places recently, one of them is Ozora. They have an open lounge area on the 20th floor which is the main attraction. Good music, good ambience and good food, what extra do u need! Perfect for dinner dates or hanging out with friends. Little expensive though, but a must visit !

Thanks to ozora for giving us four friends such a fabulous experience on the 20th floor and the fact that we could capture the whole of kolkata during durga puja is just worth the money we spent. We went there during a dry day and hence instead of 1000rs cover charge(for the rooftop charge which was not charged due to dry day) we had to just pay for the food we had. As for the food, it was just equally good as the view. Their pizza definitely gets a bonus from me. We had ordered 4 mocktails which were highly pleasant for the eve ( the kiwi one, one spicy one, one mango mist and another one which had the nutty nomenclature), one kasha pizza ( this one deserves a bonus from me), one nam prik pla which was okay, the penne and white sauce pasta which also was lovely and another moo shu chicken(basically a fried rice served with a chicken side dish). Considering my not so obsession with italian cheesy dishes, their dishes really gave a surprising twist to my taste buds. It was expensive but worth it. Total bill amount was 3600 for 4 people.  So lots of thumbs up from me, OZORA. Deducting .5 because of the overpriced hookah and that is rs 1000. But go for the view and food.

Woooooooooooh!!! Still in the hangover of Ozora..yeah..no doubt the best place in Kolkata to hangout.I went there around 7:30.
The place welcomes with a bright moonlight,awesome ambience and foot tapping songs.
The view of the city..Amar Sohor from 20th floor is just mind boggling. Yea..the price is too high.but I recommend every one to visit atleast once there.
As liquor was not allowed due to dry day, so we could not have that.
Rest the shisha was too overpriced.Rs 763 is too high for a normal mint flavour.
In food we took Mozambique Chicken,Chicken tikka meat ball and KOLKATA ON THE RUN.
Why I wrote the last item,you will get once you taste it.
A 5* to OZORA

It was saptami during durga puja eve and we skipped pandal hopping due to slight rain. Every year in saptami we used to visit acropolis mall, this year also we did the same thing, but the place changed. We gang of 6 people went to Ozora. Either you have to take a direct lift from parking to 20th floor otherwise you have to go to 5th floor and change the lift to 20th floor. The entry will charge you 1000 bucks per person. The speciality of Ozora was ambiance, simply breathtaking. A roof top view, good music, enchanting decor, heart winning food, what else you need to enjoy the perfect puja day. The hospitality was very good but very expensive, it will burn a hole in your pocket. A must visit place who wants a romantic date, chilling with friends or a calm dining with loved ones.

Visited this place thrice in the past 1 month.

The most striking thing is the visual the terrace offers, the landscape of Kolkata as seen before touchdown. This is truly stunning! This is really what makes the moolah worth it.

Everything else does its bit. The hookah is good,the cocktails are good too. I quite liked the red wine sangria on offer, the LIT and few other cocktails are upto the mark.

Good starters, esp the daab Chingari , the Behari chicken kebab. I liked the pizza they make here.

Some of the attendants are excellent, while a few others seem indifferent. The service is not bad, no not at all, but that is the area where there is opportunity of improvement.

Again, full marks to this place for the view it affords of my favourite place on earth, everything else pales before it.

The rooftop ambience and the music is to die for.A bit on the expensive side but the view of the entire city from above the twenth floor of ozora totally makes up for it.Very romantic ambience.Food,mocktails all are nice.We ordered frencj fries(asked for extra chat masala to make it spicy coz it tasted bland bt it was crispy although),kasha chicken pizza which was so soft and good,tandoori prawns served in sizzler base,fish reshmi kabab which was super-soft,chicken nuggets which came with a mint flavoured mayonise that was just awesome and a vanilla mint flavoured hookah which was strong enough to get u a high feeling..In mocktails we took mango mist,cucumber cooler,gandhoraj basil mojito and cocktails of green apple margarita,kaffir lime martini and green apple martini..For the rooftop sittng they have a cover charge of rupess one thousand per head.

Ambience : 4/5 
The open rooftop comes with a great view of the city. Great for sunsets and nights. The DJ plays a decent playlist. 

Service : 4/5 
Courteous staff and friendly bartenders.

Food : 3/5
Underwhelming. Tried Chicken stuffed chillies, Meat balls, Chicken Mozambique, Chilly Fish and a few more. Nothing really great, at least in the starters. Below par.

Drinks : 2.5/5
Very limited options available. The menu is pretty elaborate but they didn't have most of things in stock.

Cost : 2/5
A little on the higher side. Would have been alright if the food was good and if the bar was stocked. 


Likelihood to visit again : Not really. The view and ambience is the only good thing about this place. Won't be coming back for the food for sure.

I usually do not give such a high rating to any place, but Ozora is exceptional. This place is atop 20 floors on the Acropolis main building. The view is simply breathtaking. The place charges a cover of 1000 per pax which is redeemable. Also they charge a service charge of 10%. Even then the prices are quite okay. The food here is amazing- Must try "Kolkata on the Run" and "Shah Suri Kebab".

Decor, service, staff, food, drinks - all top class. And that view from roof - wow! A five-star place. I am a regular visitor of Acropolis mall, but never knew it has a hidden treasure on the 20th floor. 

We were 4 people. We had a vodka martini, long island, orange crush and some beers in the drinks. And ordered some fish, chicken and lamb starters with the drink. And not to forget the mutton kasha pizza - a true fusion.

Only one caution: This place is little difficult to locate. You have to take elevators from the other side of the mall. Or, if you are inside the mall, take the elevator to 5th floor and then locate the lifts which take you to the 20th floor. 

We will come back again!

Great place. At the top of the Acropolis Mall with awesome view and awesome ambience.
But its no the only thing which makes places best. You have to be good on food part also. Food was not at per nor in terms of quality neither in terms of quantity keeping in mind the value.
Staffs was good and service also good. But should improve the food in part.

Only for the view and ambience it's not a value for money place.

Yes once in a festive season ok.

The first thing about Ozora is the ambience. The restaurant is located on the top floor of Acropolis and view from the top is nothing short of breathtaking. The restaurant is divided into two sections..one part is the rooftop and the other a more conventional section. Since I visited with my kid the rooftop was out of bounds for me. Still the interior was also very nice and cosy. Food is also great and service very prompt and courteous. Just go for it..you will yearn for more.

This place was in my bucket list for a long time.  Finally i made a visit to this place on chaturthi. 
It is located at Acropolis  mall on the 20th floor. 
A cover charge of 1000 bucks is needed per person if you choose to seat at the roof top.  It is not applicable for the dinning hall seating arrangements. 
After you will pay the cover charge you will be provided with coupons of Rs 1000 bucks, which you will provide while billing,  that the total amount is redeemed in the final bill. But this amount is not refundable.  The prices of the food items are quite high so the thought of getting minimum bill less than Rs 2000 doesnot arrise. 
The behaviour of the staffs were great and the ambience was heaven. 
Getting the total view of the city Kolkata from 20th floor was really awsome.  The cool breeze blowing by with the view and great music just compliments each other.  The ambience is awsome.  One must vist the place,  and i promise you will not regret. 
Now coming to the food.. 
Food and drinks are costly.
1)Heineken beer 330 ml  costs Rs  285 
2)Orange Blast-A nice mocktail of oranges. Great in taste costs - Rs 220
3)Dry chilli chicken - Great in taste,  Quantity was good,  but overly priced.  It costs Rs 425
4)Behari Murgh Chandi Tikka - The flavours are too good,  nice in taste,  soft,  it comes in 6 pieces,  served with salad and chutney.  It costs Rs 375
5)Cigar di singhi - It is a desert item,  with rabdi,  it was unique in taste,  served wd a sweet sauce,  it costs Rs 340
6) Misti doi besan laddoo cheese cake - one must try this dessert,  this is awsome and totally unique in its context.  It was served differently by the chef.  It has both flavours of besan ki laddoo and misti doi.  It is a must try.  It costs Rs 310.
Over all these prices of the items they will incur service taxes of 10%. and 18% Gst (9% Cgst and 9% Sgst)  .
So in short,  the price and billing of this place is high,  but i would add,  the ambience  of this place worth the price. 
The food quality and quantity is good. 
And yeah please try misti doi besan laddoo cheese cake for sure. 
Overall i spent a nice Chaturthi evening here.

Apart from this everything is ordinarily done. Food is not that great and nothing exciting in menu nor much variety too choose from. Still u must be there to soak in that top of the world feeling u always needed.

Came here for the first time after seeing reviews, sat outside . you will enjoy the view but their service sucks real bad. The waiters are roaming around but have no real courtesy. they dont even ask about serving the food. just kept it on the table. asked for water got it like 10 minutes later that also after asking 2 times. I was about to take my whole company for lunch here but after seeing their poor service i decided not to because it will be a waste of money. food was okay but not so good either. so I wont be coming here for 2nd time until they improve.

Went for a team outing yesterday...since it was Friday evening, we started early and reached around 5 pm. You have to ask around to get to the restaurant once you get into Acropolis mall....
Starting with the best part...10/10 for ambience...the view from their rooftop is breathtaking and it is ideal for memorable dates. Since we went in evening we could experience the sky slowly moving from sunset hues to night stars...the music and the in sync light bulbs were icing on the cake
Coming to service, they clearly told that there is Rs 1000 cover charge which is non refundable but redeemable and 10% service charge on bill will be applicable as well. The staff is courteous, however serving time is longer which you might not mind if you have time to enjoy the ambience around
Last but not the least, the food. Well we ordered a lot of dishes and drinks since we spent around 3-4 hours. In veg starters, Naan sense and Abbati were ok-ok but Paneer Rubiyay Sumeri is a must have. My colleagues will recommend Prawns for the non-veg people. We also tried Pazo Pazo pizza and it was great to taste..best part being the thin crust..Main course stole the show with Rissotto (dal makkhani paneer) and Crossing the spinach line as suggested by the staff. Mocktails were good as well. We ordered Nutty Fruity, Kiwi Frappe and Orange Blast..
Overall, the price is definitely going to hit your pocket hard..so go to enjoy a full evening with time and money in hand..It's must-go when you are in City of Joy!!

Located on the 20th floor of Acropolis mall, ozora welcomes one with a great view of the city of Joy. The breezy weather, the rooftop restaurant and the night view of the city just makes you addicted to this restaurant (although the rooftop section has cover charges of 1000/- per person but its totally worth it) 

The place has a dance floor and as the night gets darker, the bar is lit up in red and the music beats loudly making u groove on ur seats. 

The food is good(honestly could be better) would recommend pizza and aglio olio pasta. 

The staff are welcoming and courteous and service is quick. 

Overall a nice place to go out to especially if you wanna see the whole view of the city and also some of the prominent landmarks of Kolkata!!

So me and my husband go to Ozora after hearing much about it from our  friends. They have a fancy tablet which has an extensive bar menu... but guess what, only 10 percent of the items mentioned in the menu is available... but thats not the part that spoiled my evening... the sheer fact that they dont want to sell the spirits that they dont want to sell although its available was something that made my evening turn from sour to bitter. One server says something is unavailable and then the manager comes and says we do have these available, I can get it for u...that too when we have paid the cheque and he was getting our feedback... I am not a person who likes giving negetive feedback but my experience at Ozora was so disappointing that I was compelled to give a review so that no one else's evening gets spoilt. Only 2 scotch and 2 beers available from such a fancy menu is beyond acceptable at a place like this.BTW the 2.5 is for the view and nothing else.

Firstly the ambience loved it..it's just perfect when you see Kolkata shining from such a height..but unfortunately that was not followed by some good food. Hugely disappointed with the food. Far below the expectation specially when you are taking a cover charge of Rs 1000 /head.

First of all...Hell yeah...That's the experience you get when you finally reach the open air place of ozora.....A well placed sitting arrangements with bar in the middle and lights surrounding the area...The view are simply awesome.... Ambience is typically rooftop can be improved though.....
As to the service...They are damn slow.. I went on a weekday not that crown bt still took them 45 minutes for a French fries....
Food is awesome bt prices are on upper side...If you haven't been there just go at least one...Good experience

Best ambience in kolkata.. amazing view of the city of joy. Service okay but not great. The main problem is with food. Pathetic taste. You have to pay 1000 rs per person for entry in outside and u can redeem that with food. But we couldn't able to eat that much. They will not give u refund so u have to eat.. 😂 so after had mocktails and few appetizer(which was not up to the mark) we ordered desert. Misti doi cheesecake was good but dont u dare to try their icecream. It was so pathetic. Overall its nice place to hang out because of its ambience.

Ozora is the next party destination for all out there.Located on the 20th floor of the Acropolis mall, the sprawling space welcomes you with so much grandeur.The lounge is divided in to two sections ,the inside more formal dining space and the rooftop with a view of the whole city😍.For the rooftop section there is a cover charge of 1000 per person..for me it was totally worth the view and the ambience.As the night grew darker ,the bar lit up in red,the breezy weather and the pumping beats get you addicted to Ozora. The drinks were quite amazing Saikat being the man behind them.Coming to our orders

1.long island iced tea
2.cosmopolitan
3.kaffir lime mojito
4.classic mojito
5.a special from the bar man himself

For food

1.Abatti--crispy fried mushrooms with cheese filling
2.Nam prik pla--Sliced roasted fish with chilli 
3.chicken mozambique-chicken croquettes filled with cheese chilli n herbs
4. spaghetti is white sauce with chicken and veggies

The drinks were well made with the kaffir lime n d classic mojito being my favourite.Having heard a lot of negative feedback for the food i was a bit sceptic at first but having a bit into the juicy mushrooms ...my doubts vanished into thin air.Though the quantity was little but every bite packed with flavours.The sliced roasted fish was quite spicy and tangy ...a nice change from the mushrooms.While the fish and the mushrooms were a hit at the table ,the chicken croquettes were quite bland.Next came the white sauce spaghetti with chicken and veggies---the sauce is to die for...definite recommendations for this one.Paired with my kaffir lime mojito this pasta and the view could make me sit here for hours .Staring at the skyline far with building rooftops the city looks gorgeous from Ozora.The staff is extremely attentive and always keeping a look at the table.If you want to enjoy your weekend with a loved one or party hard with friends Ozora is ur destination.Kudos team Ozora for putting up such an amazing place

Located on the 20th floor of acropolis mall. It has rooftop open terrace sorta seating. If you want to sit outside you have to pay a 1000 bucks cover charge per person. Also they will tell you as soon as you enter that they charge 10% service charge. Which is fine. The view is amazing and the best amongst all restaurants/ clubs/ pubs in Kolkata. It gives you a 360 view of the city. Coming to the menu. It's quite elaborate. The food is good. Liquor and food is on a higher side, but it's worth every penny coz of the ambience that you get. Only downside is the crowd. I guess it will improve over time. All in all a great place to go with friends or your spouse. I will certainly return.

This exquisite rooftop restaurant is an experience! At the 20th floor,  the ambience is one of a kind. There are options of sitting indoors but then why visit if you don't get the open air experience with an aerial view of the city! 
At the entrance, a cover charge of Rs 1000 per person had to be paid which was 'redeemable but not refundable'. 
The staff was courteous but nothing extraordinarily mention worthy. The food was similar to a fine dining experience given the  quantity they served. The music could have been more appropriate.
As a visitor, the experience was good and perhaps I'll visit again but they are overpriced and except for the fact that they have a beautiful ambience, there is definitely room for improvement. 
Probably because of it being on the 20th floor,  it is tough to get mobile connectivity and Ozora does not provide Wi-Fi making it a little less customer friendly.

Though the ambience of this place is great,it's very unfortunate what me and my friends faced here yesterday.The girl at the reception totally misguided us.The coupons of 1000 bucks they give you is redeemable and not refundable.She just forgot to mention that it has to be redeemed on the same very day of your visit.instead she clearly stated of redeeming the coupons the next time I visit.this lack of efficiency on her part cost me extra 4000bucks.i will never visit this place again n will ask the management to atleast take a step to refund the amount or just simply replace your staff.highly disappointed.

One of the finest place I have visited in Kolkata. Obviously the mesmerizing view from the top is the USP of the place. You get see the entire City of Joy shining under the moonlight. Perfect place for a romantic date or for someone who is passionate about clicking pictures (like me!). 

The place has both indoor as well as outdoor sitting option. However for outdoor sitting there is a Cover Charge of Rs 1000 per person which is fully redeemable and non-refundable. The place offers good variety of both veg & non-veg items along with drinks & sheesha (hookah). The pricing of the items have also been done in a manner that one can recover the entire cover charge of Rs 1000 per person.
 

Amazing view + Delicious food + quick service = Perfect evening!

Pros - Breathtaking view from the top, peaceful environment, tasty food, good service.

Cons - Cover charges per head is a bit too high to redeem in case you do not order hookah / drinks.

It's been a while that I had visited this place but couldn't write down the review for the '10 reviews per month' limit on Zomato. 
Ozora is creating much hustle at the moment for its spectacular position at the top of 20th floor. Opens at 4pm and that's the best time to visit this restaurant. You take a drink and some food and see how beautifully the sun sets amidst the lap of the concrete structures. 
It was a date night - a very special date night. We started at 4 in the evening and continued to dine till 9 at night. It's not that we had lots of food because it was amazing but it felt good to be there and spend time.
Coming to Ozora as a restaurant, I must say that service is very average. Nobody comes to fill the glasses and there's a very humiliating sense of ignorance in the attitude of the staffs. I just didn't like it. 
Next is food. We had the following items - 
Deep Sea Calamari 
Chicken Mozambique 
Deconstructed Daab Chingri 
Kolkata on the Run.
Liked the Chicken Mozambique dish. Rest were good, but nothing extraordinary to fascinate about.  
For drinks, we had taken two of them. The names I cannot recall right at this moment. But they were okayish. I like mocktails with a spicy twist. In my drink, the punch of Chilli came as a hit on the brain. It lacked subtlety and I hated it. 
There was Mishti Doi Besan Laddoo Cheesecake as suggested by the staffs at Ozora. From the beginning, all of the food items weren't great but they weren't that disheartening to pull your mood down. This dessert, oh goodness, was so freaking bad! It was so sweet that I got a very bad nausea. Never ever, ever ever try this dessert at Ozora! 
The reason for giving Ozora a 3.5 is their ambience which is presently offered by no other restaurant in the city. Else for the food and service, the place is very average. Pocket pinch is also pretty high. They charge you 1000 bucks per person as cover charge during weekends to sit outside (everyone comes here for that reason only!), which is redeemable but not refundable. That's the catch. If you want to sit outside, you have to eat worth the cover charge paid, else you will be on the losing side.
If they wish to retain in the long run, they have to keep up high and improve quite a lot on the basic things. Else with time, the place is going to fall apart. This is what I think about one of the romantic restaurants of the city, 'perfect for a date' location of the town. 
May come back for the ambience again, but definitely not the food! Happy Dining! :)

This place is over priced  The ambience is the main thing where paying such a hefty amount is worth it. Foods are extremely costly and quantity is also not that huge. Taste is not bad as such. If u have to visit Ozara go for the open roof and order snaks and hookah. The view of Kolkata from 20th floor is just mind blowing.....it gives a glimpse of how beautiful the city of joy looks.

"ozora or being under the blue sky". An experience of the twilight raising the curtain of stars. In the silence of dark, on the roof top along with luxury of having mocktails, that's how you enjoy the view of series of headlight gradually heading home, that's too with numbers favourite melodies. It couldnot have been better without bites of murgh pizza and barthas. You will never feel like returning home but time passed so fast even faster than thoughts..One of the best place in kolkata i hv ever been.

You can never regret going to this place. You want to party, go there. You are sad, go there. It can never be wrong. The winds on the 20th floor are heavenly. On a rain-soaked night it is as amazing as it gets. The lights around and the city sprawling around soothes you. The menu is quirky. The eccentric names would confuse your mind and taste buds. But the food is served beautifully. And the taste will melt your heart. The drinks are good as well. The presence of good friends made the experience all the more memorable.

Visited this place on a Saturday. Located on the 20th floor of acropolis mall. It was not that much crowded. The recieptionists were good but there is room for improvement in respect of their communication. 
There are two segments of the place - the rooftop section and the normal in house section. 
For the rooftoop, you need to pay 1000 rs. Per person as a coverage charge which is REEDEMABLE but not refundable. It gets deducted from the bill amount. The view is beautiful from here. There is live dj in this section. The choice of music is also good, although a bit loud. 
In the in house section there is no such charge required.the staffs are really courteous. For 2 people it charged about Rs. 2800. We ordered two pint beer each, gaelic cheese bread and wok tossed chicken. The food quality is good but yes a bit overpriced.
Overall the experience was good and a nice place to hangout.

the only thing good about this place is the roof top ambience. other than that nothing was up to the mark. starting from the direction or the path leading to the restaurant; from 4th floor of Acropolis Mall to reach Ozora. the staff & services are 'okay'. the lamp in our table too was a defective one. it was non-functional. despite spending quite a long time there the staff did nothing to fix it. the food was not too good compared to the price. moreover, they charge some extra taxes out of nowhere.

not much recommended one.

The place need to work on their menu. We went there after dinner for cold coffee ans some finger foods. The place didnt have cold coffee on their menu and it was mid summer. However we settle down on one mocktail, 1 chocolate and one pista ice cream. The order came quite late, the ice was just regular one. Mocktail was just ok. The choco moose was extraordinary.

Most points are for ambience and location food is not the best thing that the resturant can offer.

The Restaurant is on the 20th Floor of Acropolis Mall. The view of the city from there is breathtaking. The view is what will attract any person to this place and definitely the ambience of the place with the music. You have to pay the cover charge of Rs 1000 per person which is redeemable on food and drinks.  Coming to food,it was tasty. There were variety of food items. Beverages were also too good. Hookah is available too. You should definitely visit the place.

Wow what a spectacular sight of kolkata. Right at the 20th floor in Acropolis kasba the restaurant is situated. Kolkata needs more of these high rise roof top restaurants. 

As I entered it was informed to me that the place has a cover charge of 1 grand and considering the place it was just fine. Moreover being an LIIT lover 1 grand was worth it. 

The place is just out of the world considering kolkata. It's on the 20th floor with a beautiful sight of literally the entire kolkata. The music and the decor is just great. It's an huge place considering a roof top restaurant. The bar situated right in the middle has its own charm. Perfect place for a private party or a romantic dinner. But WAIT GUYS. WE WON'T CONSUME THE AMBIANCE. 

NOW HERE COMES THE MAIN PART. 

As I have mentioned that I'm a LIIT (coctail) lover and when I tasted it ....... it was just lime, sugar syrup and coke. Where was the ALCOHOL ?? On asking for a stronger drink I was given the same glass with more sugar syrup. 

Taking the waiters suggestion went for this chef special fried crispy chicken. It was Horrible. Horrible. The coating had a bad odour and the chicken fiber was very bad. 

Since it had a cover charge and I had gone with a friend we had to consume the rest of the amount. Taking no further chance ordered for a taquila and left.  

But my thirst for some good food and coctail still was lingering.  
Hence went to Hopipolla and was very satisfied.  

Over all a beautiful place. Out of the world ambiance for an evening. Very cool music.  Kolkata looks great from the top. BUT that's it. Horrible food. Coctail are equivalent to moctails.

Location - 20th floor of Acropolis Mall, Kasba.
I heard a lot about this place nd did visit the place recently. You have to pay the cover charge of Rs 1000/head which is redeemable.
Ambience : 4/5
Food : (Good to Taste but Quantity is Less) 3/5
Pricing : (Overpriced) 2.5/5
Decor : 3.5/5
But can try the place atleast once.

The ambience of the place is worth all the stars. Try visiting the place at night and you get see the City of Joy filled with flickering lights. The staff was very friendly and food was good too. But yes, the price is... Oops. It's worth it though.

If you prefer ambience over food, Ozora is certainly your call. Tad over-pricing for horribly cooked, distasteful food is a big disappointment. There is no cover charge. The drinks were only good. We ordered Virgin Mojito, Republic of Chicken, Rissotto and a strawberry-flavoured drink. The staff were NOT that courteous. Will NEVER recommend this place.

Great place to be with friends. The only strange thing which I found was, they are charging 10% extra as service charge over your 18%gst. 

Management has no explanation about this 10% extra charge.

Meal for two would cost around 2500

This was the first time !!!! I went there, but lemme tell 
I dnt know abt FOOD hw it was bcz didn't get the opportunity to go inside 
Ambience was truely amazing as seen from outside 
Management - PATHETIC N VERY UNPROFESSINAL - 
I was told over the gate , sir we have seat for 04 people and since u r 2 people can't give-  I agreed to her point !! I asked what are the hotel policy 
They said first come first serve ? Then why was I denied giving seat - then all of a sudden they told me sir it is reserved - A LIE 
I called ozora from the ground floor n asked for reservation they simply said !! 
SIR on Saturday we don't reserve the seat 
2 diff ppl with diff answers 
It's a humble request to the management if u are within a framework of ur policy !! FIRST COME FIRST SERVE !!! atleast don't lie 
N don't give bogus reason afterwards that it was reserved for members 
SIMPLY PATHETIC 
BUT FOR SURE I LL VISIT AGAIN N RATE U WITH FULL BELEIF N FAITH UR FOOD N EVERYTHING 
THANK YOU

Heard a lot about Ozora and its breathtaking ambience and view, so finally visited it few days back. There is a cover charge of Rs.1000 which is fully redeemable on food and drinks. The ambience was the main attraction. The view of kolkata from the 28th floor was amazing. Now coming to the food, it was my friend's b'day so they gave a small piece of brownie with candles which was complimentary. We tried 'Nam Prik Pla' which was was a fish oriental starter, tasted amazing and very much recommended. Then we ordered 'Republic of Chicken' and 'New age chicken Makhani'. Well frankly the Republic of chicken was not upto the mark, the chicken was very hard to chew upon and tasted nothing amazing. The new age chicken makhani was good, it was well made but again the chicken was really hard. These three items costed us Rs.2000. Oriental items are more recommended than continental ones.

A Mindblowing place!
I visited this place on Valentines Day with my date..
The best part of this place is the view that you get from the 20th floor of acropolis mall!
Pocket pinch is a bit high but it is worth it..
You will hardly get a place like this in Kolkata!
If u r a romantic lover then this is the correct place for you to visit with your partner..
Food is above average..
Ambience is good..
Soft music is being played in the background..
There is a cover charge, most of the time, if u want to sit and enjoy the view of the 20th floor.
But if you are sitting inside then a-la-carte will be suffised..

Overall:
Ambience: 4.5
Food: 4
Crowd: 4
Service: 4
Pocket Pinch: 4.5

The best place to visit with you date in this city.
YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER PLACE THAN THIS!

Well to begin with the direction or the entrance to a 20th stored building is very confusing, secondly they will charge you 10% service charge up and above your bill.. now lets talk about the food.. very limited options to choose, quantity is horrible and to top it the taste.. simply yucks.. the last and most important part the charges n prices of dishes are god damn expensive.. total wastage of time n money.. no value for money.. its a big no from me for ozora.. i donot recommend it to anyone..

The feeling of being closest to the skies grasps you as soon as you walk in from the doors towards the sky lounge. The spectacular view and the lighting makes it a perfect hangout with friends and family. It has a live DJ and view of more than a 180° around the open terrace. The place is presently running on temp bar license for Friday to Sunday. So it's better to call first to check before planning a party. On other days the whole place is open of all as restaurant only. Serves both Indian and Continental and they offer limited but good dessert options. Food was average however hospitality was fantastic. Smiling and polite staff. A must go.. especially when weather is great and to sip wine while enjoying the view. ☺️

But I can't understand why they have charged 10% service charge.they have charged vat,swach varat tax and krisi kalyan tax; these are ok. But service charge??? I think we people are not bound to pay service charge. I think it's illegal. Story is not over yet...

The Skybar was not available that day but the indoor was also really good.The service was fast.We had American Fried Reshmi,Biriyani,Chicken Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken and a Chicken Stake.The food was sufficient   for four of us,and it was delicious at the same time..That day,Hawaian Lava was not available,so we did not have dessert. Will surely go  again soon to try out the skybar.

This is by far the coolest skybar experience in Kolkata. 20 stories high on the rooftop of Acropolis mall with amazing music and great food and Beautiful view of Kolkata city. 
Very courteous staff !! 
Pricing is high but the view and rooftop experience makes it's all worth it. 

Only con is that if it rains, the skybar gets closed.. everyone gets shifted to the inside restaurant.

Nice environment and the banquets lead to the infinity pool complete with a wave machine which is a unique feature at Ozora.
It is the perfect area to host close get together which is one of its kind.Great panoramic view of the city.The staffs there were also very polite and caring. We went there without any prior booking, but still they arranged for places for us. The Service and Ambience bowled me over at Ozora. At 20 Floors Up in the sky, 
this is easily the tallest restaurant available in Kolkata presently, and it makes for amazing viewing.

There was a Cover charge if you are sitting outside. We ordered a behari chicken tikka which was good like really good but the lamb chops were undercooked though the platting was good. The spaghetti had the perfect sauce and cooked perfectly.

Coming to the staff, they were really attentive, inquisitive and courteous. Loved the food 😍 We ordered 4 dishes.. all of which were cooked well. Though there can be some improvement in the quantity for the price. And some more variations in the cuisines as well. Other than that, it was a pleasant dinner overall.

Probably the highest rooftop restro in the city of joy; the overall interior and music and the view is just WOW😍 But when it comes to food qulity and variety it's really not worthy. When I visited the place the coffee machine was not working so that was quite unacceptable  and yes things are bit overpriced. But for the ambience it's worthy of three stars.☺

Being situated on the 20th floor, the best part about this place is the outdoor seatings. The view of the city from there is breathtaking. Best is during the evening or preferably during the night. Food is just average. We had jamaican jerk pizza, which was good, cosmopolitan was average, kiwi frappe which was ice based, again an average drink, reshmi kebab, average again, and some mustard based prawns, a decent dish. There is one server particularly who needs to learn how to behave specially with customers, others were pretty decent with servicing. So ya, the entire rating here was for the ambiance.

Saturday date night at ozora- got a table quickly as we reached early. Ordered a chicken Reshma kabab, chilli paneer pizza, a Bloody Mary and teen  pan shisha. With the first drag the shisha started choking and there was no flavour at all. Called the shisha guy and he did nothing but changed the pipe which hardly made any difference. Coming to food, Reshma kabab was delicious but the pizza was just average. Now the drink was not doing what it had to do ordered another Bloody Mary but still did not do what it was supposed to. They have a cover charge of 1000 per person and out total pocket pinch for all of the above was 3K. I would not recommend this place for alcoholic or shisha. For food and service, yes, may be.

Once at Ozora...

If you search for this fine dining at the main Acropolis Mall, you will probably be fooled... It is in the annex building of the main Mall... What drew me here was the lure to get a panoramic view of my City of Joy from the 20th floor and the temptation of some really sumptuous food. However the price for the former was a bit exorbitant... They are charging an extra 1K per person as coverage charge - for opting to enjoy the rooftop area of the restaurant.
Now coming to food - they offer chic tab menus that include fusion food in the name of theoretical jargons as post modern progressive cuisine or deconstructed dishes... The menu namer has definitely put in some of his intellect in setting up the menu just as the interior designer must have used his aesthetic sense.... The remaining role lies with the chef as to do justice to all these accompaniments ... We ordered chicken mozambiqui as starter, republic chicken and new age makhani for main course and Mishti D0i- Cheese Cake-Besan Laddu as dessert. The chef played safe. The dishes tasted fine. The names will set high expectations that the dishes fulfil only partly, but they nevertheless console and pacify and lull the tastebuds with a delicious flavour. The dessert definitely sto0d out with a stunt presentation where the assisting chef herself brought it, crumbled a rose and poured some liquid smoke to create a sound and fury within a gastronomic explosion! The overall experience was definitely fine, the place is recommendable.

Went to Ozora on a hit and muggy evening. Was blown away by the outdoor though it was fairly uncomfortable. Was very happy to find two familiar faces from Smoke Hose Deli, who made our visit very comfortable. Thanks a lot Surajit. The disappointment came at the drinks menu where most of the stuff was not available. Some of us ended up drinking Indian beer at an exorbitant price. Others had to be content with whatever cocktail that was available. Some of the food was decent but nothing outstanding. I will go back only if the menu is done justice to. Can't just bank on location and ambience to run a place.

Been there 4-5 times before. That time never charged cover price. But recently when we went for a get together with friends they charged 1000 per people as cover charges, which is ofcourse redeemable against food. But simply this system is useless. Since with 5 of us we might not order food for 5000. Also, their food is not that great and also costly according to the quantity. The good part is the atmosphere. But again spending 1000 bucks per person to feel the ambience is useless. I visited this place often. So now I have to rethink. May be my visit frequency will change due to this cover charge. Will look for some other options.

Also would request Zomato to change the approx cost section, since now it's 1000 for one.

Would surely not recommended this.

Too ordinary for the price. You get a tab as menu card .

Correction: This place is now permitted to serve alcohol. As they have just recieved their lisences, hence the options on alcoholic beverages is very limited.
Godd food and service. But what stands out is the superb ambience and the view of Kolkata city from 20th floor along with the cool breeze even on a peak summer evening. The view is what will attract any person to this place. Try out this place, and do try out their roof top open air lounge. Visit this place in small groups or a big one, its great.

This restaurant is located in the 20th Floor of Acropolis Mall having both open air and closed roof top facility. Actually the entrance of this one is at the backside of Acropolis Mall and its different than that of the shopping mall. I think I have said the most significant and their USP and no further review is required if you want to have a view of Kolkata from the 20th Floor while hanging out with your friend/s. So until and unless you have visited at least once this much review should be sufficient for you to decide.

They have started serving Alcohol so they now have a Cover Charge of 1000/- bucks per individual entry which can be redeemed against your orders for that evening / night.

So once cover charges are paid, a beautiful (had to use that adjective) lady ushered us in. Obviously we opted for the open air section.

The open air section is dark and there is a separate section with sofas for club members. Otherwise there are long chairs at the edges and in the middle there are normal tables and chairs. 

The bar section is in the middle and the music was also good. Overall a good ambience (again view of Kolkata from 20th floor ;) )

Now coming to the food...we ordered mainly starters 

Jiaozi Chicken - Crispy chicken sliced pieces in black pepper sauce. This is was quite good in taste and if you like your dish spicy go for it.

Nam Prik Pla - This is a fish dish and very spicy (which is exactly what i wanted ). Roasted sliced fish in wild pepper sauce.

You get a wide range of drinks for your choice too..

Overall a very nice experience and looking forward to visit again.

Worst Worst Worst Food! The Ambience is good but if you're going to have to food there then be ready to waste your money. Trust me, the food is absolutely rubbish. 

P.S: if you want to enjoy some food, then only order Papad and Chutney. That's what you can enjoy. All other food are just rubbish!

Located on the 20th floor of Acropolis Mall, it definitely is one of the best rooftop places in Kolkata. The view is simply mindblowing. So is the food. The daab chingri was lip smacking delicious. The Chef recommended the in-house pasta which was again really delicious. And the dessert, the cigar shaped gajar ka halwa was out of this world. Would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place for sure

Great place to chill out ! The view from the outdoor section was  just charismatic , But we were surprised by the cover charges that was taken,only when you book a table in outdoor section, which you can adjust with the bill but its non refundable at all ! They had limited stocks for drinks, due to their temporary license so we had to compromise a bit ,But the  Service was good.So overall it was a good experience .
*Cover Charge was Rs 1000 per person :(

Being new in this city I don't have much ideas about good restaurants. My friend took me to this place. Amazing ambience. You get to see kolkata from the top since its situated in the 20th floor, open air. The food is also nice and delicious. We had ordered pink pasta and a pizza. Both were cooked to perfection. The staff is also sincere and courteous. The only thing for which I took ur 0.5 rating is for the alcohol which is not being served. I hope you guys will sort it out soon.

Very Good ambience in the Open Air Restaurant...
But the decor is not that good in the covered Area.

Good Food

But the biggest surprise is service is not only slow but very very poor.

In two hours, he gave repeat order after 20 minutes and that too after  three reminders...This happened every time... Once he bought cold drink instead of water.... Ice was not there. What not in two hours.... The waiter was constantly talking to his colleague instead of concentrating on the job...

Thinking of an perfect evening, whats come to my mind is Ozora. Spending an evening at a height of 328ft with finger licking food, shisha and classy beverages is something which we all love to. The perfect skybar for Kolkata, with a view to die for. Excellent ambience, great hospitality. Miss it at your won risk folks.

Lovely view , good food , though a little pricey. Ozora is the kind of place you go for the feel of it. The food is also good, but the interiors and the view will take your breath away. Places like this are much needed in kolkata so kudos to the team.

The downside is that they hadn't really started off in full flow so no music was playing . Hope they get through those issues soon. 

The biggest downside however is the parking. This is the reason I haven't rated this place as 5. When you are going to place as fancy as this , ur a lil dressed up and the women are further decked up; in this scenario its fairly maddening to find parking and the required lift and is quite capable of sparking a fight between u n ur better half. Also it's a fairly unimpressive entry to such a nice place.

Ps: stay open for lunch if possible, I'm sure you will find takers in that part of the city

At this place one would definitely feel to be At the Top of the World!!Situated on the 20th Floor of the Acropolis Mall this place has probably the best ambiance among all the rooftop cafes in the city. With our beloved City being visible for miles around and gleaming among those bright lights this place offers a spectacle to behold! Coming to the food, quality is excellent, specially the Daab Chingri which is absolutely fantastic.All the others items were also good enough. Pricing is very much reasonable taking into account the grandeur of the place. Overall a must visit place and a place the city can definitely be proud of!!

Food Taste was ok but not a value for money. Limited food choice. For Ambience they get full marks. Indoor area is spacious and outdoor area is beautiful and perfect for date. Didn't liked reception service but order delivery boys were prompt. Ideal for 2-4 people group. Not a perfect choice for family. If you can avoid going with kid, you might enjoy more.

Ozora the rooftop lounge is an undertaking of the Merlin group, this group is associated with luxury and has targeted the elite class of the market. Owing to the parent companies policy, this place lives up to the glory. 
Presently alcohol is not served due to government regulations but soon they are hitting back with the sauve led bar. The interiors of this place is chique, classy while the skybar gives you a great view of the city of joy, killer combination. 
The food and beverage menu is very much adequate and simple, while the prices are pretty average for any upscale restaurant.
The cons would be 10% service charges with all other sort of taxes! I ordered a sheesha, gondho basil mojito which costed me a fortune. The mocktail served was Missing the fizz at first after the feedback they changed it and was delighted in the second attempt. 
Food I'm yet to try, so keeping the section reserved for future edits.
Service was great, helpful servers with good body language and a very pleasant host! As we went on a Friday night, expected a bit of crowd but it was almost vacant. I find this place beautiful and worthy of time, I would totally pay the cover charges for such a killing ambiance and view differing with the most of the reviews here on Zomato. 
Surely returning back, a suggestion would be keeping offers on food and beverage would help attracting more vibrant crowd!

Ozora one of those places which was in my wishlist for a long period of time. But my experience at this place was not how I thought it would be. 
First, lets talk about the good things. The beautiful decor, the roof top ambience, the out of the world view from the place.
Well, u must be thinking where is the food in the list, but the sad part is it was dissapointing.
I ordered a mocktail, a Chicken White Sauce Pasta and a Chicken Pizza.
I didnt like any of them, none of the above was according to the standard and was over prieced.
So if you wanna have a great time without considering food as your primary need you can try this place.
This place needs to improve on its quality of food to compete with several other food hubs in the town.

I agree with the fact that the view is indeed breathtaking and "breeze personified". The decor is eclectic with its ample ambient lighting. The place is ideal for a romantic evening out with your partner. A word to all the girlfriends, if visiting this place, then do tie your hair or hold down your short dress, for the breeze will surely give you an unsuspecting Marilyn Monroe experience!!  However, I must add, even though Ozora doesn't serve alcohol (not yet), it is expensive!! We weren't informed about the cover charges for outdoor seating. We ordered for one shisha, three mocktails and four food items which included two chicken varieties and two fish varieties. It was nothing exceptional in terms of taste and presentation. Our bill came to a whooping 6 grand + taxes which is definitely costly when compared to the likes of What's Up Cafe (Southern Avenue), Smoke Shack (Hindustan Park), Afraa (City Centre) and Over The Top (Park Street). Over all it was a feel good experience. The staff were cordial and pleasant to interact with. A request to team Ozora, please append the price of each item on your menu bar. It will help in giving us a rough cost estimate before venturing your joint. I rate it a "4" solely for the feel good factor I have experienced.

The most unfriendly staff I've ever come across and I've come across many an unfriendly batch. They treat guests as intruders and take pride in making it evident that they don't care about guests. They won't keep a table reserved even if you call way in advance so do visit at the risk of wasting your evening.

Since this place doesn't serve alcohol yet I think it should atleast increase the variety of its mocktails. The day we went, we had only three options to choose from. 
Overall a must-go for anybody who wants to enjoy some nice food with an amazing view of the city!

The roof top area is amazing. You can see beautiful Kolkata from 20th floor and the view is too good with cool breeze. For this ambience i can give 5/5. But when it comes to food it is not up to that mark. Starter was good but i personally didn't like the main course. But if you want to feel that you are on the top of Kolkata then this is the best place ever. Go and enjoy the roof top ambience.

So I was there yesterday and yes it's a magical place for all the view from that 20th floor. The city looks absolutely stunning from the place.  So for the atmosphere it's 5/5 from me.  
The issue for me would be that the hookah is served only in the open space which actually is meaningless to me and thus I did not order one. Hookah should be started even inside.  The items that I had there were all OK for me nothing great about it.  
Recommended for a a off visit that's it and more for all the couples out there, it makes more sense for couples to explore this place.

Pathetic experience in terms of food and drinks. Otherwise the ambience is good but ultimately we go there to eat FOOD not AIR!
NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!

Ozora is an amazing place when u a looking for a view. Located on the 20th floor of Acropolis mall, you can see the dazzling skyline in front of you which in an experience in itself. But that is all there is. As an resturant it is average, the food is ordinary but on the expensive side which is expected given the view they are offering. We ordered chicken Mozambique which are basically nuggets u get in the markets. Chilli that got fired which is fancy name for stuffed chilli pakora was better. We tried a couple of varieties of burgers which were also fine,nothing worth remembering. The bigggest shock was the sheesha which is not mentioned in the menu but suggested by the servers. We ordered the vanilla flavoured one and it cost us 800 bucks !!! way pricier than any food items. And no, they dont serve liquor. If i ever revisit the place it will be only for the view.

The place has a great view and ends about there. Food is grossly overpriced, I ordered a pulled pork burger which a) did not have pulled pork, just pork pieces b) tasted like sour pickles on cabbage c) came with dry, tasteless fries and d) cost an arm and both legs. There was no alcohol, the mocktails very average. We also ordered a lamb risotto which basically came as three measly frozen lamb balls quickly flash fried and dumped in risotto so salty that we couldn't finish it even though it cost 550 bucks. There is also gaudy blinking lights - the place is aspirational and supremely overrated.

A restaurant which literally makes you feel on top of the world. Excellent ambiance, cordial behavior of the staffs and you can see Kolkata all at a glance. But the main turn off is that the open area of the restaurant is not lighted properly. You can not see what actually you are eating. If the place is visited during the falling dusk with your partner you can have some real romantic moment.

Our menu for the day was Mushroom Chai soup, Behari Murgh Chandi Tikka, Murgh Khusk Purdah and Nan-e-Bukhara. Regarding the food I would like to say there are many other places in Kolkata to savour your taste buds. Behari Murgh Chandi Tikka was filled with cheese and mayonnaise which I didn't enjoy at all.

The points are only and solely for the roof top view and ambiance. Since they are not serving alcohol, they should make efforts to escalate their mocktail menu. They had only 2 mocktails to offer. Sheesha was not bad.  Will visit agin after and if they start serving alcohol and review again.

Ozora is one of it's kind sky lounge in the main building of Acropolis next to Siemens office and Gitanjali Statium in Kasba. 

Ambience:
The outdoor ambience is what this place is and will be known for. Atop the 21st floor one can see the skyline of Kolkata. They have a indoor seating and a big outdoor seating. There is a touch of luxury throughout the establishment. This is where all the score comes from. There is a general liking to sit in the open air among their customers and so the queue to occupy a seat in the outdoor area can be quite long at times. The menu is accessed through a Tablet device. Otherwise the waiters will have to bring a torch along with a paper menu card because the lights are dimmed. The music is good and much to my personal liking did not have to face the Bollywood and Punjabi masalas. In Kolkata the ambience is unique and that gives the administration the courage to charge a cover. Here USP comes at a price. The indoor ambience will have lot of competition even in Kolkata.

Food and Beverages:
The quality of the food is bad to be short. There is nothing special no matter what is your pick in the Tablet menu card. I personally would not go to Ozora for food until they have improved significantly. Most of the drinks I picked were not in their menu.

Price:
The price is high. Also, they will recover a cover charge of Rs 1000.00 per person. This charge is redeemable against the final bill but not refundable. So in order to cover up one might have to indulge in a bit more of drinks or much on the oh-so-poor food. This is a major put off. However, the pricing is such that one need not stress much. The price is as high as the roof is. This cover charge serves a couple of purpose. 1) Ensure that the chef continues to learn cooking and still be billed 2) A minimum billing is ensured to enjoy the ambience.

Service charge:
There is a reception desk where you will be greeted on arrival. You will be made to cough up Rs 1000.00 per person cover charge here. Also they will inform you that you will be charged 10% Service Charge (on the overall invoice amount). You must agree if you want to get in. After that please do not expect a 5 star hospitality. It will still remain our good ol' Oly types.

Overall:
The outdoor ambience is such that it is worth a visit or two. But if in such an ambience a large chaotic group is around then all the money goes down the 21 floors and then the gutters. The food quality, menu spread, price, cover charges, service charges  weighs heavily on the other side so that I will not be a loyalist. But for a special occasion Ozora will definitely be a place I would strongly consider if I get a good seat in the outdoor on a nice weather.

Ozora... Top of the town.. well this is surely a place to visit... Mainly bcoz of the feeling that u r at the TOP.. whole Kolkata looks so beautiful.. cool breeze soothing ambience..
.
Service is good.. management people are very humble.. n concious about the reputation which is very impressive..
.
Food is I would say not bad... But yes the special gesture which Mohona one of the management people showed and things which she suggested really helped us to rate food quotient high... We ordered some sea food salad which was not good then taking mohona's suggestion we ordered Scissor Salad.. which was AWESOME...
.
It was my fiancee birthday that day n wanted to make it special for him which eventually happened... Thanks to OZORA.. a complete place to enjoy ur special day..

Located on the 25th floor, ambience is perfect for any occasion. A roof top place with all arrangements of music, booze, ambience and FOOD I must say its just wow. We ordered Biryani and it is worth the money.
Though the prices are on little high but it worth the ambience.

The ambience of Ozora is simply amazing. It has two seating arrangements. One indoors and one outdoors. The view of the city from the rooftop is mesmerizing.  The staff are courteous and extremely polite. The food simply makes you want to eat more and more. The names of the food are such that one is easily interested and curious as to what shall be served unto him. The food needless to say is extremely delicious. The concept of a skybar is something that makes Ozora unique. It is a lovely place not only to enjoy a yummy meal with your family and friends, but also provides an opportunity to enjoy a few precious moments with your loved ones. A visit to Ozora is definitely recommend.

Situated on the 20th floor, the place is beautifully decorated and the wonderful weather made it an amazing experience when I visited this Sunday. It was very crowded and the open area was full, so we opted to stand for sometime at the bar counter rather than waiting at the reception desk. The staff was courteous and helped us a lot in getting a table,  albeit with two chairs for the three of us, but soon they made arrangements for a third chair. We had ordered a Chicken Kasha Pizza, which was good and a Fish tandoori kebab (don't remember the exact name as it was complicated) which was very tasty. There was some confusion over the order as the waiter somehow heard we had ordered a veg pizza and it led to a small exchange of words. But to their credit, the issue was promptly handled by the lady in charge and we were even offered a complimentary mocktail, which is supposed to be their speciality. It was a mix of mango and strawberry and was really good. The evening got better when they offered us one of the empty sofa seats, which otherwise is reserved for club members. 

The overall experience was very good. Would definitely recommend a visit with family or your special one. And yeah, given the location and ambience,  it's not that expensive either. :)

The high rating is because of the location, ambience, electrifying atmosphere and decor. This pub is located on the 20th floor. The view is amazing. The decor is elegant. The staff is courteous. I would recommend everyone to sit outdoors and enjoy the food with a beautiful weather.  We ordered Korean lotus stems which was amazing. It had the right amount of crispiness and spice. The tandoori aloo was ordinary, nothing great. We ordered a dish called "crossing the spinach line" which was extremely flavourful and its a must try. Spring onion rice was also good. Steak or no steak is a dish which contains vegetable balls with sphagetti. The vegetable balls were tasteless but the sphagetti was nice. Fresh lime soda was referring. You can try the soups they have. 💕 Looking forward for another visit.

Ozoro has two dining areas- indoors and outdoors. The decor in both areas is  eye pleasing and very romantic. We chose to sit outside. Being on the 20th floor, it's very windy, which is very enjoyable till the food arrives. All the light elements of the dish started flying. Also though they had well laid tables indoors the same was lacking outdoors. Even if dining on the terrace is ment to be casual, for the same prices I expect a proper laid table. The waiters were polite and trying their best to serve us but their lack of experience was apparent. They served us the mains along with the starters. 
Coming to the food, we had the mushroom chai and the republic of ginseng for soup. Both were sensational, especially the mushroom chai. A must have. For the starters we tried the Korean lotus stems and the tandoori aaloo. The Korean lotus stems were good but the tandoori aaloo was nothing special. For the mains we had the "Crossing the spinach line" which is am excellent dish and a must have. We had a 9 vegetable in a gravy and butter and spring onion rice. This dish was a nice dish. And lastly we had the "steak or no steak" which was vegetables balls on a bed of aglio alio spaghetti. The balls lacked flavour and one can totally give this dish a miss. 
Lastly, my suggestion would be to take starters outside and enjoy the ambience and take rest of the courses inside to enjoy the food. Also, it will be convenient for the ladies to tie their hair up.

Admittedly one of the best rooftop restaurant of the city. Only negative point is " NON AVAILABILITY OF LIQUOR. A LOVELY EVENING AT OZORA. I love the ambiance.All their staffs are nice and well behaved.  Quality of food is lovely. would love to visit again but only after they get their liquor licence.

Amazing place with an even more amazing view of the city below from 20th Floor. We visited on a Friday evening & it was quite windy. The ladies were having a difficult time with their hair. We were not charged any cover charges as was mentioned in the other reviews on this forum. We went click click with our mobile cameras. No drinks are served yet as they have not received their bar license - so we were told. We tried mocktails like Mango Mist, Kiwi Crush & Nutty Apple. As starters we took Wok Tossed Pepper Chicken & Jiaozi Chicken. Taste of food was good but not awesome. However the USP of Ozora is their place & customer care. The ladies at the entrance were very courteous & guided us to our desired seating zone explaining the things. Had a gala time. Will repeat for sure....

This restaurant has great roof top ambiance . To enjoy the roof top, one needs to pay 1000 bucks per head which is non refundable but reimbursable. That means if three people visit and decide to sit outside then minimum they have to cough off is 3000+taxes. But then , the price of the food item here is such that you will surely end up ordering food/drink that adds up to this amount. Service is good . Coming to food , there is not much variety and taste is also just average. There is some food items that were listed on menu but were not available. One can visit this place to enjoy the city view with drinks and cool breeze ( kolkata's weather permitting).

This new place on the block is amazing...mainly for the view of the Kolkata skyline...
The rooftop setting makes it perfect for a romantic evening watching the sun set

There are a few pointers if u wana visit this place
1)It doesn't have liquor license so do with the mocktails.
2)The staff claimed that as they wrre not serving alcohol no cover charges are required.So just pay a la carte.
3)I visited this place in the "Board exam season" so no music was as allowed outdoors.That was a shame considering the ambiance.
4)The food is nice and reasonably priced.I especially likes the starter Naan Sense...it was yummm..mocktails are good too
5)The deserts were a huge let down...there were limited choices of only 5 6 items on the menu out of which 3 were not available...I would really want them to work on that section cause u do remember a place if u leave content and happy..and deserts make u feel that way


Overall a nice place..worth a visit for sure😊

Ok, so last I went here after a friend of mine recommened it. I was blown away(quite literally!!) by the rooftop deck & the 360° view of of kolkata that comes with it. Once you step into the deck there are hardly any words that describes the feeling!! Lovely atmosphere no doubt but the food is quite overpriced. But nontheless a place i recommend.

A place to visit to feel the breeze and the view of city kolkata. Situated on the 20th floor of acropolis presents a glorious panorama of the city.. The food is too good and we were taken care by staff moloy who was too benevolent as he provided me a complimentary desert at the end.. As a whole if u want to spend great time with ur loved ones in a soothing environment visit this place.

Heard a lot about it and finally  we were there in 20th floor of Acropolis building.One cannot of course reach the place from inside the mall.There is a side entry to the building .
We were only interested in the sky deck and the lady at the reception informed that they are not serving alcohol due to license issues.Well that's a big turn off as  Zomato clearly mentions that "serves alcohol",so this fact needs to be updated.

Well coming to the ambiance its one of a kind with a open skyline of the city and low light arrangements its just perfect.
But the same cannot be said about the food.The food served is pathetic and over priced.

I will only go back for the ambiance .

P.S. :two non veg starters and 4 glasses of lime soda costs 1700/-

Loved the view from the top..Apt place for a romantic dinner or date, if it's the place only that matters. The food we ordered on the other hand was below average. To be precise everything we ordered was extremely salty, even our fresh lime sodas. To be honest when we complained about it we were offered a complimentary dessert as compensation . But the salty food had really disturbed our tastebuds . I am rating this place only for the awesome view and ambience. Oh yes this place is extremely expensive but a good place of you are an ambience loving person only.

The only positive thing about this place is the location and ambience. You get a spectacular view of the city from the top of 21 floors. The breeze is awesome and the DJ is a delight. Next, the drinks menu is decent, though the waiters are often clueless as to the contents of the menu. Food is barely average. I would go ahead and recommend the Kolkata on the run and de-constructed daab chingri. But the Pizzas are a strict no. There is a cosy and well done members' area...but unfortunately they are not accessible to non-members despite a cover charge. And they take their coupons a bit too seriously. You can land up in trouble if you lose the chit. They are too reluctant to adjust the cover charge with the final bill if you lose the chits. And ridiculous it might sound, neither the money receipt, nor the coupon numbers help. So count your coupons meticulously if you don't want to lose your money or waste your time reasoning with the manager.

So, finally visited the place. The place was in buzz these months. Amazing ambience. The view of Calcutta was brilliant. The décor and service is also very good. Coming to food, starters are below average. No doubt main course is very good. But the price of breads (nan, kulcha, etc) being Rs. 240 per piece is not worthy. How can the price of curry, tandoor and breads be equal? Too costly.
Keeping its expensiveness aside, overall it was a place to be visited. If price is not a factor, only then you should visit the place.

The ambience is amazing, but food was a total disappointment. The quality & taste is not upto the mark. To top it off when we walked into the restaurant we were immediately served a welcome menu which we thought was complimentary, but when we checked the bill we found that we were actually billed for it. Hence we landed by paying for something which we didnt order for.
We would not visit the place again coz value for money is not there.

The view is just spectacular, specially after sunset. Add to it a breezy weather and that just makes it perfect for a quiet deep conversation with someone. Only thing lacking was soulful music, which on being asked was told that due to exam time they didn't have license to play. Food-
Babycorn- Very ordinary and the helping was really small. 
Nan-sense - Naan chopped in circles, topped with cheese and paneer. Really liked it, was something different. 
The service is really good, just that too many waiters kept on asking every once in a while if we liked the food and if we needed something else. Would like to enjoy a private conversation without being interrupted every 5 minutes on my next visit.

By far the best Al- Fresco bar in the city simply because it's 20 stories high, where the wind  blows a gayle all evening. Food and mocktails are pretty decent. This place should become one of the most premium niche party places in the city soon, provided the service remains consistent.

Ozora has been the talk of town since last few months. Going by the USPs I decided to visit the place to dine in on my birthday.
Initially it was bit difficult to find out this place. Very few ppl could give us the info to reach there.
Anyhow the place was a dazzling display of beautiful decor lights. That's for the indoor seating area.
We wanted to get the rooftop view hence we preferred the outdoor seating area.
It was definitely charming BUT the place was too dark to savour one's platter.
The service manager was very attentive and she made sure that each of the customers were attended :)
Liked it!
Service was prompt too.
The concept of menu tab was interesting!
Well, coming to the food I would say it was quite good. Nothing extraordinary of course!
Warm sesame crusted chicken salad was something that I didn't like.
But the main course was brilliant. Fish tossed in nam prika sauce along with spicy pepper flavoured rice made our tummy happy happy. The quality and quantity was too good!
This dish is highly recommended 👍
The place would have been more soothing if made brighter with lights and accompanied with some music :)
Overall had a nice experience!

We were a little hesitant going there coz of the mixed feedback on zomato which was quite contrary to the feedback (amazing) we had got from our friends. Finally we decided to go and it was just awesome. Food was lip smacking and the service too was brilliant. View was very nice and the cool breeze was the icing.

Located at the top floor of Acropolis Mall. Wonderful place. They have got both indoor & outdoor seating (roof top). Well decorated. The view in the evening is awesome. 
Sad part is that they still dont serve alcohol. Yet to come. 
If there with a special person then one would really enjoy the charm out there. But way to reach from the mall is bit confusing.

I felt to reach the cafe is a lil difficult because it feels like a real puzzle to enter and exit from it i mean there should be more sign boards for the directions in the mall.
The food and drinks (mocktails) felt a lil less on the quantity wise...
There was no issue on the quality but still for the pricing what they offer it feels scanty..
This was our groups thought!
Because 750 for 3 Mocktails 
And just a starter for 600 seemed very much overpriced to me!
But loved the location and ambience of the place!
And the service was also good

Located on the 21st floor of the Acropolis Mall at Kasba.

This is perhaps one of the most well decorated and classy places you can visit in Kolkata.

A brilliant view from the top, some awesome sofas, chairs and tables set out on the terrace as well as inside to add to the charm of the place. Awesome lights, good flooring, an uber romantic terrace and this is all good I can speak about this restaurant.

If you wanna sit outside on the terrace, there is a concept of cover charge or security deposit which makes no sense as other restaurants don't have this rule. I had ordered a fresh lime soda which was just about Okay and my friends recommended me for a prawn dish which I donot know why they did recommend, a bland dish with no taste and no good quantity as well.

A very expensive place and it does not justify that either.

Visit this place only if you want a good view of the entire city and a great ambiance becuase thats all you can ever get here!

Wow!!! It's just one of those places u fall in love with the moment u enter! Though quite on the expensive side, the view and ambience is quite worth it.
We had the dal makhani tarts which were nice and different. Their pasta was just mind blowing, rest of the food I thought was just about average. But u go here for the ambience more than anything else. One of a kind in kolkata!

Now seriously, Zomato should come up with some negative rating system. I am generally not too critical but places like Ozora need some serious bashing.

It was a Sunday evening. They ask for cover charges which is absolutely fine. Once we entered the rooftop we found many couches were unoccupied but we weren't allowed to sit there as those were "reserved for members only". We had to stand next to the bar counter. When we requested the staff to let us sit on the unoccupied couches and promised to leave once/if the members arrive, they refused. When we asked them to arrange a table for 4, they asked us to help ourselves!!! Finally after 20 minutes, we managed to get a table for 4 and the dishes and plates were still not removed. We requested a number of waiters to clean the table but nobody paid attention. They just refused to attend and at times just nodded and then left. We waited for 30 minutes, yes, that's right...even after 30 minutes, the table was unattended and nobody came to take the order. We left the place and checked in to Asia Kitchen.

Now, the thing that should be noted. We were there for about 55 minutes. And guess what, all the couches reserved for members were still lying empty when we were leaving!

Absolutely not recommended. Waste of money and time. Management and Service? Total disaster.

A very bad experience on the night of 5th March 2017 (Sunday) at 11.30 pm.
Me my wife and my cousin had gone there to spend some good quality time, but I guess it was wastage of time and money both.
The service and the staff both was very bad and too top it all the MANAGER some Mr.Orgo. was drunk and was dancing and I guess he was not in his senses because he  did not know what he was saying.
Really a very bad experience.
I don't think visiting that place again is worth for me.

only let down is they charge 10% service charge which you can't deny if you want an entry in the skybar cum dining area. Argued the logic behind it but did not get a convincing answer. Although as per law i have the right to reject the service charge

Our night out was marred by the unreasonable staff at Ozora. There were six of us and we were issued coupons on entry against a cover charge of ₹6000 (₹1000/head). We didn't notice then that we were given five coupons instead of six. Later while settling bill, they asked for ₹1000 more, for the missing coupon. We explained that we have already paid ₹6000 and there is no way we are going to pay ₹1000 extra for a missing piece of paper. The staff refused to see logic and were being unreasonable. They wanted us to pay ₹1000 extra! We had a pointless argument for an hour. At last we had enough and were contemplating calling the police or our advocate friend, for being harassed over a petty reason. Finally they agreed with us and we left. Our night was well ruined by then.

It is otherwise a happening place with good atmosphere. At the 20th floor terrace the strong wind hits you hard and the music is groovy and  the lights are scintillating. The food is not much to write about. The daab chingri was okay. Potato wedges weren't upto the mark while the pizza was a disappointment - with an overdose of salt in the lamb and no oregano, chili flakes or olive oil on the side until we asked for the same. Another fish item we ordered turned out to be good though.

An evening spoilt because of inhospitable & cheap behavior of staff..the manager Argo was completely drunk and doing sleazy dance with his friends.. speaking rudely with the client as if they r serving for free... The bar tender and waiters were all in his support .. long island served without alcohol.. they have beers of the brand u want but they refuse and many more.. when asked to waive off the service charge as we were unhappy with d service, they didn't even bother d same... extremely disappointed..

First of all, Ozora should have a tag line to go with their name ---> and thats got to be "ONLY FOR MEMBERS". 
Visited Ozora for the first time on a Sunday evening to have a good time with friends but it turned out to be our biggest mistake. 
This place is pathetic when it comes to customer service. If you're not a member, you'll be treated like someone who has gone for free food and drinks. 
75 percent of their seats are already reserved for their MEMBERS and then they even have the audacity to give you a place to sit with a condition that you'll have to vacate the table as soon as their members arrive. 
Horrible hookah and even worse is the staff behaviour. We called them in 5 times to check on the hookah but they were least bothered to even listen to us. 
When we finally got frustrated enough to decide to leave the place, the manager ( or whoever he was ) cared a little to try to cater to us but the damage had already been done. 
Finally for all the people who plan to go to this place, a small suggestion - Make sure you are a member !

Finally my wife and I tried out the much talked about first sky bar of Kolkata...Ozora. As already expected, the view from the 20h floor was breathtaking. However, we couldn't get a table at the sky bar and had to go with the regular dinning option. It being na Saturday night, no tables were available in the open area, though we had the option to stand and dine (without a table though). We had ordered Republic of Chicken and Gremolata Crusted Spring Lamb Chops. The food tasted great, and the quantity wasn't something that one would mind. Not sure why the rating is 3.5 on Zomato. The place surely deserves a 4.5 at least. Loved the overall experience. Plan to visit the place soon, but on a weeknight so that we can get a table at the sky bar. Cheers!!

Their motto in life to organise private parties. If you are invited for a partt, certainly you will have a good time. But don't even think of spending your special day at Ozora, because

1. They always have a private booking at the terrace

2. If there's no private booking then their owner's friend is partying there anyway and you can't join them
@
3. They don't take reservations (may be they do selectively, never taken mine)

4. They don't serve alcohol on Mondays and Thursdays (very Sanskari)

So think more than twice before you go there and return disheartened

Rooftop lounge is something Kolkata deserved. And Oita stepped up. Located on the 20th floor of the building next to Acropolis Mall, the experience starts right from the moment you step out of the elevator. The decor is magnificent right from this place. They have indoor seating as well but who will like to sit in when they can sit out and see their city as the sun sets in and the illuminations hit the city. A different experience. Tables have candles that are lighted once the dark sets in. The music is well picked . The service is also good. Food quantity is average but taste wise it's good. It scores mainly due to its location and ambience. We ordered Chicken Mozambique and it was just the way we had imagined. The bar menu is also good but the only thing is they do not serve booze on Mondays and Thursdays so check the day before you hit ozora.

A couple dressed in Casuals look at each other as the elevator bell dings at the 20th floor. They enter the reception area holding hands and asks for a table in the outdoor area.

The reception lady : As per our club policy we are charging 10% service charge on the food bill.

The foodie : (wtf) but ma'am, that should at my discretion right. Whtever, please take us to our table.

As the trio walk past the beautiful and posh decorated @wooden Interiors, the music was filling up their senses. The passageway led them to the most exotic rooftop in town.

The foodie :(wtf) this is awesome, insanely cool. This has gotta be a 5* rating. Forget bout the service charge. I m already super duper excited.

The digital menu card was so well thought of that the couple took a good 15 mins to decide on the choices. In a matter of 10 mins the Asian green lamb burger, the Khameeri roti and the dumbukth daal were served.

The foodie :(wtf) I really wanted to give this place a 5*. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes. Maybe Indian and burgers are not their specialty. Maybe continental next time....... Maybe.......

Although the ambiance was great.
But it is very expensive and the quality of the food and service was not so good.
We visited on 19/02/2017 around 9 pm, we have to wait for more than 30 minutes after we ordered the food.
Even for a glass of water I have to approach the waiter twice and even after that We have to wait for another 5-10 Minutes.
The service was very poor.
The billing was done wrong.
I was provided with a Bill of another visitor.
On top of that the service people never apologized for the inconvenience.
More over it was not a good experience.
Need to improve the service a lot.

Ozora, for me, is definitely a must visit, at least once. A spectacular view, with wind blowing in your face and the sunset giving you company will leave you astounded. I can go on and on about the beauty of this restaurant because it IS actually something like that. Coming to the food, we ordered Jamaican Jerk, the Behari Murg Chandi Tikka, and the Murg Khushk Purdah with Naan. The food was tasty and spicy. If you're not a fan of too spicy food, I'll suggest to miss the Jamaican Jerk. The staff were very helpful and polite. Overall, we left the place contented and happy, but that's mostly because of the view.

The only skylounge in Kolkata, and what a place to be. Ozora is on the 20th floor of Acropolis mall and it is simply outstanding. Ambience is perfect and so is the view from the top. The skydeck is the place you would want to be whatever occasion it be. 
The black marble floor to the lights on the ceiling and obviously the view outside <3
Coming to the food, I had ordered north indian food which was not as great as compared to the ambience but good. Dal makhni tart was good which to me was a new thing on the cards and worth a try. 
Overall a great experience and many more visits to follow for sure.

A place that has around 500 love birds shimmying away to great music on Valentines' day is definitely a great place to be. My pick to celebrate this day was Ozora and I couldn't have thought of a better destination. I have been to a number of sky bars in Mumbai and Bangkok and Kolkata is privileged to have a place that makes you feel on 'top' of the world literally! Located on the 20th floor at the adjacent building of Acropolis, Ozora is a great place to hang out with family, friends or spend a romantic evening with your partner. We experienced some great music , the food-ordered the  Paneer rubaiyat sumheri, Behari murg tikka and Kasha Chicken pizza. A day with too many guests, the food was served hot and quick. It also tasted great! The bar is to look out for and nothing beats the view! Looking forward to going there for seeing the sunset. Special mention of the seasoned manager Sourav and his team for being the real pillars to this place. Kolkata enjoy your skyline with your martini right here, right now!

Came here for the 2nd time this Valentine's, hoping to change my view about the first experience. But but but, The hospitality is worse. They had a valet service too, Great, but when you have stopped accepting guests. You should inform them at the valet itself. Then bringing them up and send them back again. On asking about this downstairs, the person downstairs on the walky asks the person upstairs, who replies, "we are not accepting guests, but let people come up". Why? Just to charge them a mearge sum of 130 rs. Bring some Class to the place, please.

" OZORA "
-----------------
Not a place which kolkata needs but a place kolkata actually deserves.

A beautiful evening beckons when I entered the spectacular place Ozora, the sunset at 6 p.m followed by illuminated view of Kolkata's yellow lights.
An experience so ethereal that is difficult to express.
Everything is so chic and yet so casual.
The Ambience is their plus point with some fantastic music playing in the background.

Ozora has two different dining areas the fine dine area's interior is too posh, the black flooring with the wooden impression walls gives the perfect variation of class and style but I choose the rooftop sky deck area.
As rooftop is always my preferred area for relaxing.
The first glance of the sky lounge was WOW ,the place screams of luxury the arial view of the city from the 20th floor of acropolise mall is the best you can have.
The sky lounge can accommodate 400 people.
Feeling the wind and enjoying the skyline was the favourite part of that perfect evening.

Coming to the food -The food was was amazing the presentation was particularly outstanding. Though its an underrated places in Zomato ( I don't know why ) but I would obviously recommend people to check out this amazing sky lounge or else it'll be a loss as its the best I've seen so far in kolkata.

Good luck to the management of Ozora for doing a such a fantastic job haven't found any of their service lack.

PS- " the ultimate sky bar in town " I had a gala time.. Cheers 🍻

Had one of the worst experiences. Tried visiting this place thrice. On the first day they were having a private party on the deck, on the second day they were not serving alcohol and on the third day I called before hand and the lady at the reception told me that they were not taking reservations which is fine as it was a Saturday but also added that 'reservations were only for owners and their family' however we went in the evening, half of the deck was hosting a private party and while we were paying the cover charge and entering we were informed that there was no place to sit and we would have to stand by the bar. Well ozora is not that big a place or that big a sensation that I will spend a Saturday evening standing by the bar!!! Basically what I realised from the Behavior of the staff and the rest is that until and unless your surname is an 'Agarwal' or a 'Mohta' so as the owners the treatment would be really horrible and one will probably never be respected there! I personally would never recommend this place to anyone!

As i entered the elevator alone and pressed the button to the 20th floor, a certain Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey popped in my head, er, thanks to the latest Fifty Shades Darker trailer. I quipped to myself as I had no one special to share that evening with on this gorgeous deck! Yet as I walked towards the Skydeck, my level of anticipation grew with every step. strong gust of wind welcomed my tresses and I stood for a moment in awe at the sunset. The sky was pink and the moon had surfaced on the other side, waiting in the shadows for its turn to take over. The Calcutta skyline (yes, Kasba surprised me!) looked breathtaking despite the partial cover of smog. They charge 1000 each as cover charge which is fully redeemable. Don't know bout food as i was not hungry but if u talk bout drinks , they need to improve there cocktail's taste, blend and proportions a bit. Ordered for martini , screwdriver ,and bloody merry which was not as good as I expected. But i was there not for food or drinks honestly was there for the view . That bloody suppose to be more spicy rather then sweet. But next time i will visit this place for food , for sure. Am giving stars as per ambiance and staff .

The ambiance is definitely the USP of this restaurant. Atop Acropolis mall which is the highest building by a long shot in the immediate vicinity, this restaurant is amazing if you want a rooftop experience. The food is not outstanding, but pretty good. They have some innovative dishes as well and lots of choices in their menu. The service of the waiters still has room for improvement, but their behaviour is excellent. Knowing Kolkata's weather, this place is best visited in the evening. 

And they gave us a complimentary dessert. Brownie points for that!

Now bout food yes i enjoyed that as well paneer tikka was super awesome thank you SUVENJIT for being such a good guide through out the night ..... to b very true dis is what i was looking for in Kolkata such a grt partying place ...... Service was good equally i found all the staffs helpful ...... Yes! now comes the real part ... i know it takes time to establish, for a new nd huge place like ozora to be fully functional that's fine with us till the time you r making our party awesome ..... As i said earlier in my every reviews taste, flavour, choices are such things which is bound to differ from one person to another ... so please try this place nd share ur experience with everybody

We arrived at 9:30PM on the Friday evening and there were no deck seats available. However, Mr Saurav, really went out of his way to put together a couple of bar stools and a table. This five star goes out to him.

As far as the food goes, the quality and quantity were good. The taste was not out of the world but it leaves you content. The LIIT was well made with just the right mix of alcohol!

As far as negatives go - it's pricey (but you should expect that) and it's chilly due to the breeze (the food gets cold within minutes)!

Overall - definitely a good place to visit! A must visit!

Horrible food horrible service horrible staff if had an option of 0 would have given that. Wonder how long can they run with such attitude. crowd was sad, sad music. They can't serve naan without butter you have to take as in the menu that's the most absurd thing I have ever heard. Can only serve naan and tandoori they can't serve a kulcha even if a five year old kid is asking for it. Only thing is the deck's ambience . But no one can take the crassness they have.

Fantastic as the view might be, the staff clearly does not respect the guests. After charging a cover of 3000 and letting us in they don't give us a place to sit even though there were 5 tables that were not occupied and without any sign that they were occupied. One goes to an expensive place like ozora for the experience which they are clearly incapable of providing.

I visited this place last week after a tiresome day at office.Ozora is located in the 20th floor in Acropolis mall. U can have a view of the city of joy from 20th floor which is just amazing.The ambience and the music is just the perfect thing after a hectic day.The service of the staff were very prompt but food is not that great.I would have rated this place a perfect 5 but due to the food quality I rated this 4.5. It's a newly opened and one of the best rooftop restaurant/bar in Kolkata.There a cover charge which is again fully redeemable . Although food is a bit overpriced,it's a must visit for the ambiance and for the view that it offers of Kolkata.

There are major areas that will need improvement, like clear policies on entry charges (cover of 1000 per person on all days except Mondays and Thursdays because they get currently have provisional liquor licence that has to be renewed daily), seating allowances in certain parts of the establishment and general customer care aspects that create first impressions.  The ambiance is obviously unique and it will only get more dramatic as more construction projects litter the EM bypass region.  The food is good and innovative.  All the three times I went there the food was good.  Service was prompt on the part of the servers, bartenders and chefs; unfortunately, like in almost all restaurants in Kolkata, service staff did not have a working knowledge of the products they were selling.  That's essential, along with courtesy rather than pretense from front-of-the-house staff.  This is my neighborhood's newest addition; I want it to do well.  So while it's alright to have a certain snobbery about being the coolest place in Kolkata, humility and being friendly will take your business further.  Most importantly, both the daal makhani tarts and the meatball tarts are pretty good (have it with the salad); the jerk chicken pizza is pretty good and so is their thin crust; quesadillas were great and so were the kabobs.  And Margaritas ALWAYS have salt rims, whether flavored or not!  Finally, I'd recommend the general manager to engage with patrons to see how the establishment is doing.  Your place has great potential; make the best of it.

The only 20th Storied Sky Bar of Kolkata. Lovely ambience and classic view. A must visit in the winters. Was confused about visiting this place because of the low rating on Zomato. But the place is very good, food is good too. Music was very good. Though drinks are pricey. A must visit. Pizza, paneer tikka, crispy lotus stem, quesadilla. Surely this place can't be done in 2000 with drinks for 2 people. 1000 rupees is the cover charge per person. The private party section with a pool is awesome.

It's a must place to visit. The ambience is pretty good because of its lighting and music. Place is big enough with a separate area to give parties. Food was of good quality with generous staff.
Beer and cheese soup is a must try. Even the white sauce penne pasta was deliciously creamy. 
Doesn't have much of mocktails yet. If people don't wanna have hard drinks, it hardly has many options. It might be difficult to find the entrance at once but being on the 20th floor, gives an amazing view and breeze.

Had been there on Saturday with family. The ambience is very good especially the open environment. This place is meant to enjoy the open area whereas the dining area is OK as other fine dining restaurants. The service is not good. The drinks were good but on the expensive sides. For starters we ordered paneer tikka, dal makhani tarts and corn kernels. The tikka was not at all good but the tarts were good. For the main course we tried dal makhani , mixed vegetables and variety of Indian breads , Thai rice with green curry etc. The Thai was good but Indian was just OK.  Liked the place but only if u enjoy the outside area otherwise just OK.

Had celebrated my sister's first anniversary here..the occasion went on to be a memory of lifetime with such beautiful moments added by the Ozora staff..the food was delicious hot and tantalizing!
With really quirky presentations they made so many small and beautiful moments to make the day so very special..they made a heart shaped pizza with happy anniversary written with tomatoes..then there was rose flavored gulab jamun cheesecake with beautiful decorations with anniversary message on it..even desserts were designed creatively with happy anniversary written all over..it was as if they were the ones who were more excited about the occasion! Really appreciable service!
Special thanks to Sourabh who had taken all care to make things so perfect for the evening!
Another mention would be of the staff member John who had been there to make sure all things were correctly placed and rendered amazing hospitality!

Loved loved loved the ambience. Huge place. The 20th floor gives you a clear view of the city of joy. The entrance to the 20th floor beaut is very confusing. Had to enter the restaurant twice from the service kitchen. Yeah. Embarrassing. 

On the flipside the food is a bit of a downer. Especially the Indian cuisine. It is nothing out of the ordinary and the biryani not so great at all. Im yet to try out their continental menu which I will for sure because I wouldn't mind going all the up there for a beautiful evening again.

Worst pub I have visited till date..The only thing which I loved was the ambience which was really great..Apart from that the food was worst..and the service was unimaginable for a place like that..The waiters were clueless about the menu. And top of that 1000 per head as cover charge for that pathetic food and drinks.  After having such a bad experience I decided to pay only 150 as Service charge instead of 400 imposed by them (FYI: Service Charge is not mandatory for a customer to pay..The customer if he/she wishes can pay partly or nothing at all as service charge)..But the Manager instead of listening to me kind of ordered me in a threatening tone to pay the whole Service Charge.. I told him that this was the last time for me at their pathetic place..So I kind of request to all the party loving people..please dont waste your time at such a place

So for starters It's one of those cool places is Calcutta quite comparable to the roof top lounge in cities like singapore etc. but I guess they have a long way to match up to them in terms of service. 

Staff is not trained and not at all to the standards of a place like this.. they definitely need to deploy better staff to match the ambience.

The food was good.. but the servers did not even know the names of the dishes they got to the table leaving us perplexed in the dimly lit environment hoping that we were not eating any thing non vegetarian 

The drinks where below average.. after asking it to be changed couple of times still wasn't as expected..

Giving the benefit of doubt as it's a new place it's going to improve with time..and hopefully we can find sheesha also there pretty soon..

Before I go any further let me caveat this review by mentioning that I visited it as part of a lunch party and hence the service review would be more related to a banquet type experience.

That said first things first. The view and the ambience is phenomenal. For those who have been to Mumbai/Bangkok it reminds you of the rooftop lounges in those cities. This is a place I would visit with family and friends merely to enjoy the view and relax. The banquet area was next to their pool which I guess would be an awesome place to hold summer parties.

Now to the food review. We had various dishes names of which I would not be able to provide as the setting was a banquet style. For starters we had crispy lotus stems, arancini balls, mushrooms and a indian take on tarts with the outer shell being made from a roomali roti and filled with awesome kaali daal. The starters were all great with another notable mention being the arancini which were some of the best in the city and quite authentic in taste. 

For mains we had two veg. dishes -  a mixed veg, a paneer and kaali daal. There were two non-veg dishes as well in a chicken dish and a prawn dish. The non-veg dishes from what I understand (I did no eat them) were  excellent especially the prawn. The veg dishes were good but nothing that would especially stand out.

Being overfull I did not try the dessert but heard it was quite nice as well.

Service was good but a little slow. I assume the fact that it was a specially booked lunch may have affected the service a bit.

I expect that once the initial teething problems are over this will be one of my favourite places to visit.

Kolkata's new terrace lounge , the place is in the Acropolis mall 20 th floor, has a great view of the city but sadly enough the food quality is really bad and needs a great improvement .

I went with friends and we had the Punjabi fries ,Khao Pod tod (Chilli babycorn) which was not good and the oil used to make it was tasting burnt. And alse ordered the house special Loaded burger De constructed Bunny Chow , sadly enough the food was not good at all and the alcohol prices were very high compared to other lounges.

The management needs to improve the food quality for sure.

Well, finally Kolkata has its own sky lounge and the ambience surely lives upto the expectation. The feel of the winter chill at this 20th floor outlet was definitely worth experiencing. However, having said that I wasn't really wowed by the food or the service. Even though they give u a tab for a menu with fancy names for the dishes, it doesn't really hit the mark. Another problem is even though half d place was vacant, the staff said to sit in d sofa section on the terrace one requires permission from d management- reallyyyy!!! 
The place definitely has the potential, however it looks like an uphill task at d moment!!

The level of excitement we had for visiting this place went to vain after we experienced this place.No doubt that they have the best of space and interiors but the lack in quality of food and service just shadowed our overall elation.They behest Rs1000 per person as cover charges which can be adjusted against bill amount.

Service-This is the worst service i have ever experienced.We ordered for a sheesha at the beginning but we got it almost at the end.Even after our persistent request for getting it earlier they were not listening to us.The food service was also quite slow.For serving us a paneer tikka they almost took 35-40 minutes.They really need to make a drastic improvement in this section.

Ambiance-One will completely fall in love with the place and the skyline view from the 20th floor.The whole place is divided into two section and also has a pool side area.The interiors of the indoor will just make you fall in love with this place.They can accomodate almost 150+ people at a time and along with all this,the lighting at evening time is also an eyepleasing sight.

Food-Firstly most of the dishes were unavailable in the menu(Specially the desserts) and some which were available were also quite average in taste.We had-

1:Paneer Rubiyat Summeri
2:Punjabi masala glazed fries
3:Smoked Marwari Papdi pizza
4:Dal Makhani Tarts
5:Mix sauce pasta

Among them only "Paneer Rubiyat Summeri" was quite good while others were just below average dishes.

The only pros about this place is its ambience. Otherwise, the service is poor, untrained staffs, and the worst thing about this place is coverage charge. They charge you 1000 bucks per head as coverage charge, which is absolutely not refundable. They won't even mention it clearly. I don't think i'll ever visit this place again.

I along with my friends finally decided to begin the new year at this place. And boy, was i blown away! One will definitely fall in love with the ambience and the spectacular view of the entire city that too from the 20th floor. I surely did. Now, this is the only pro for this place.

Coming to the cons. 1. Highly inexperienced waiters and management. They themselves are clueless about the menu, drinks etc.
2. Food- pretty much average.
3. Price- The cover charge of 1000 per person is a lot, especially if you are going to this place with a big group.
4. Service- Really slow man!

So, apart from the ambience and view, this place was pretty much disappointing!

Ozora has a wonderful ambience, with the entire Kolkata visible.. They have a 1k cover charge redeemable with the bill amount. We ordered punjabi masala fries, baby corn and pazo pazo pizza.. All 3 turned out to be good! Among the drinks, we called for virgin Mojito and blue lagoon.. both were really disappointing and tasted like cold water with sugar syrup.. they need to work on the mocktails.. apart from this slight glitch, everything was very delightful and worth the money! I plan to visit again..:)

We 8 people went to Ozora on 31st December. Reached there around 8 PM, that place was too crowded. Once we sitted we got JD with unlimited Veg and non veg starter according to choice, Option for food specially drinks was good, no limitation to have Jack daniel, black label, chivas, craggenmore, or any other. We became happy with that place, service was excellent, but the most important thing is it's ambience, we can see the whole city while we are taking food form the 20th flore of Accropolice mall. Above all we like that place too, will come back soon, like to reffer to friends. Probably it is the best restaurant under the open sky.

Ambience is amazing. A full view of the skyline from 20 floors high of the Acropolis building. They will charge 1000 rupees entry fees which is redeemable with the bill amount. There is a vast variety in the food menu. We ordered the cheesy French fries with the gravy, two kinds of chicken starters and one fish. Names were too fancy to be remembered but taste was ok, although quantity could be better. Drinks are also available, of the standard kind. The only negatives are that it's too dark on the table, so you cannot see your food properly. Also, the taxes charged were too high. But that's not the restaurant's fault. But, be prepared to shell out anyway. For 6 of us, two rounds of cocktails and 4 starters came to 1350 rupees per head.

The feel and ambiance of the place is amazing.And the view from the 20th floor is superb.
However , when it comes to food the place fails to impress. I, along with my cousins had been there on 31st December at around 5 and we ordered a coffee, choco lava cake and a few drinks.They didn't have the choco lava cake or the coffee and they informed us about it a good 15 mins later.We thought of leaving the place but as soon as we got up the waiter had already brought our drinks.

Anyway, a request to the management would be - sure your ambiance is amazing but please add some value to the dishes and drinks you are serving.

The party on opening day was awesome. 

This place is a hot shot contender for the top slot.

The indoor dinning arena is normal but the outside one is ravishing.

Lighting is classy

I visited this place on Christmas and was spellbound by the ambience.
The place is really nice and the open lounge gives a great view and also the lighting is great.
Owing to the fact that it has just opened this place is being well managed by the opening team.
The staff are very courteous.
The place is great.
Coming to food, we went there for desserts but unfortunately many of the items of the dessert in the menu was not available so we had to settle ourself with drinks.
The place is definitely a worth visit for the view.

Best place for a perfect romantic dinner. Awesome place. I have experienced something like this for the first time, ever. The sky lounge is the most happening place ever. The service is good. The arrangement and environment is awesome. The beauty lies at its height. The view of Kolkata from 20th floor is so mesmerizing. You have to visit this place to feel the magic that they have created. The food is awesome. The candel light dinner concept is very romantic. The music in the background is the cerry on top. I would recommend this place. It's a must go with your love.

Loved the place lovely ambience superb hookah(try with vodka base)  best lit the only problem was with service but it's understandable as it's new and too rush so they need time to settle and can't even say no to people even when there is no table as it's new... It deserve 5/5 but gave 4 only because of service even the DJ was so cool ..

Just not happy. We were kept waiting for sometime and told at the end that they do not have any table while we saw some people entering there in our presence. Maybe they might have booked table earlier but if that was the scene then they should've informed us as soon as we stepped in that they don't have any table. Pretty disappointing !

The newest addition to Kolkata one of the most amazing places I have visited in a long time. It doesn't make you feel that you are in Kolkata the set up is such that you feel like you are not in India.
Amazing view, mouthwatering food and an outstanding ambience. Definitely on someones to do list.
Kudos to the team.

Firstly, the management was not prepared to even handle a small crowd on its beginning. We went around 9, ordered nachos, and after one hour, they said it was not available. 
We can still.ignore this, but after coming home and analysing the bill, noticed that they have charged VAT and service tax irrespective of the fact that they have applied for VAT and service tax number. The taxes charged are close to 50% of the bill amount!
Can the management please resolve this for me?

There is so much to say about this place
But just cant frame it
I would simply say - kolkata is getting new heights !
Ozora - the place is all about its view
The spectacular view just got me into a different level.
Food was amazing - had ordered dal makhani tarts which was indeed a good call
Hookah was pretty good compared to rooftop lounges.

Kolkata needed a place like this and yes they are the one.... visited last Sunday.
The view was awesome.
As it is in 20th floor you can get the whole city view with the touch of lovely weather. 
Food was finger licking.
Staff was very courteous, though we had wait for our table but the wait was worth . 
Overall cheers to the management and keep going....

Visited them on 19/12/16, the place is ideal for hangout or hookah or as a lounge , but when it comes to food/dining it it pretty bad.IF you go with the intention of just dining there then kindly think twice(we went to dine obviously).otherwise great place nice ambience and great view of the city, reminds me of places like BKK, KL,Spore.

In love with this place. Though I dint get a table but standing next to the bar and enjoying the weather and view was a lovely experience. This place has that charm, their prices are nominal and one can enjoy good drinks and great food. The only drawback is why do they ask to take cover charge, like comeon people have their obvious reasons to get into this place and spend accordingly. Please see to this if you can. The lights are the attraction. I enjoyed my time.

I visited Ozora on the day it opened that's Friday 16th. Upon entering we were asked to pay cover charges of Rs1000 each. We were 8 of us so we paid Rs8000. However, another group entered as we were making the payment and they were not asked to pay. ( I'm assuming they had come upon recommendation) anyway that's not the problem. We reached around 9 pm and till 11 o'clock we were not served even half of our order. Moreover, our soup arrived cold in a large serving dish instead of a warm soup bowl or something. The manager came and assured our orders will be served soon. We waited for another half hour but hardly anything was served. We asked the waiter to bring our bill as it was sheer time waste. Since our cover charge amounted to rs 8000 and barely anything was served from our order, they told us they can't refund the money. They would neither bring us our order nor refund the money. Yeah that's the guys!! We didn't want any chaos and considering they've just opened we were liberal and told them to get anything they have ready. At last we had drinks to make up for the amount because food they either didn't have or there was nobody to serve. I would have rather just gone there for 10 mins, enjoyed the ambience and come back with good reviews than such a horrible experience. It's a nice windy place with good music and seating but a good service would have enhanced my experience.

I visited Ozora on Sunday and I must say that I was blown away seeing the place.I have visited places like AER/Asilo in Mumbai and Sky Bar/Sirroco in Bangkok but this place has the best feel and ambience.I am not a hookah person but was tempted to try once I saw it. Its a must try.. the food and cocktails were mind blowing. The service was a tad slow which is understandable given the new place.. spoke to the manager and they are working really hard to sort out the initial hiccups.I am sure they will sort out the service issues given their experience in this industry.Overall I would sum up by giving 10 on 5  given an option. As someone said it correctly for this place that its a gift to "City of Joy" !!

So finally the much awaited sky lounge has opened its door for kolkatan's.
The ambience is something which is the highlight of this place.Situated at the 20th floor of the acropolis mall which enables one to see the cityscape in most spectacular way possible. The wall of light which was  synchronised with the music stole the show for me.
The management has planned the layout of the covers in a very strategic way. Couple seating is the best of the lot.
Coming to the food now it is on the expensive side but worth it.
The interiors is another aspect where this place scores highly.
The only thing which bothered me was the service. It was too sluggish and literally was a drag.
Conclusion : keeping in mind this place is pretty new and the operations do take time to settle down henceforth brisk service can definitely enhance the guest experience.

Coming to the ambiance. 5/5 for ambiance. The deck area is just awesome. Being on 20th floor is gives a tremendous 360 view of Kolkata. The plcae worth visiting but they should work on there services to give the customers a pleasant experience.

You'll love the weather for the the fact that its December and it is situated at the 20th level!

Visited the Ozora Sky bar today, 18th of December 2016, Sunday. We had originally planned on having lunch but on arrival we were informed that it wouldn't open before 4:30 pm. We sort of grabbed something to eat at the food court of the Acropolis Mall and reached Ozora about 4:40 pm. There is a cover charge of a 1000 rupees per person for being allowed entry into the sky bar in exchange for which they issue coupons of the same value which can be redeemed during billing. The sky bar is on the 20th floor of the Acropolis Mall overlooking the whole of Kolkata. It's a beautiful bird's eye view from the side that has bar stool type seating - the seating is mostly for 2 here. The other side of the sky bar has sofa seating which is more private. The bar stool seats have a wonderful view of the building front with multicoloured lights which have a synchronised pattern of lighting up with the music. The music is mostly electronica or trance - I don't really know which, but I personally liked it a lot, although if you want to Shazam it, you wouldn't be able to as there is absolutely no net connection whatsoever. The signal for the phone is also very poor and you would have to search around for a spot on the rooftop to complete your call. It was almost sunset at this time - however since it was a very foggy day, there was no appearance by the sun while we were there and therefore we could not witness the much talked about sunset which had been mentioned in a leading newspaper a few days back. 

A waiter soon arrived to take our orders and we ordered for A Smoked Martini, a Peach and Apricot Margarita and a Whisky (Black Dog). Along with the drinks, we asked for some food preferably chicken but were told by the waiter that's this will take over 30 minutes to prepare. On being asked whether a mutton dish could be served faster, he confirmed this and so we ordered for a plate of Mutton Boti Kabab. About 10 minutes later the waiter reappeared with some bad news. He said there was no smoke for the smoked Martini (!!) and of course there was no Black Dog! On being asked for options he seemed at a loss and we called for a senior bartender who managed to change the orders to a Jalapeno Martini and a JD. 

Twilight fell as we waited for our drinks to arrive and we were still enjoying the ambience. The drinks arrived after a wait of about 25 minutes but I was surprised to find my Martini glass to be hardly half full. Also, it was not spicy as expected but rather sweet with hardly a hint of alcohol in it and no Olive.   Our food arrived in another 20 minutes but on trying to portion it, we found it to be very hard to cut through and difficult to chew. We summoned the waiter and informed him about the problem.  He agreed to take the dish back and returned another 10 minutes later to let us know that the chef had tasted the meat and pronounced it to be perfectly cooked (excuse me??!!) This made me lose my cool somewhat and I demanded to see the chef eat it in my presence. This was obviously an uncomfortable situation for the waiter who then involved the manager, Mr Pratyush.

Pratyush offered to solve the situation by discussing our opinion with the chef and in another 10 minutes (this was becoming a habit) returned to where we were seated to let us know that this was the way they cooked their meat (or in other words – “You lowbrow hags, we have done you a great favour by agreeing to serve you”) but “since it was not to your liking, we are offering you another dish which the Chef would specially prepare for you – just give us 10 minutes”. We did not have any other option. So we decided to wait it out.

Meanwhile the bartender returned to ask for feedback and I requested for a repeat of my drink but preferably in a standard quantity. This seemed to upset him and he tried to impress upon me about how martinis were generally made that way (unspoken - how dare I challenge the Martini Guru?) to which I very politely objected, saying I had had many martinis in many places all over Kolkata (and completely forgetting to mention Bangalore, Delhi, London, Rome etc.) and I did not share his vision. This resulted in my 2nd glass of Jalapeno Martini being well laced with vodka and Jalapeno juice and missing any of the sugar syrup of the previous one. The sacrosanct olive was still nowhere in sight!

About 30 minutes later and after having enquired with Pratyush twice and receiving a somewhat irritated response of the Chef having to “labour at making the meat tender enough for our taste buds”, we received a plate of 4 pieces of processed mutton kebabs (NOW HOLD YOUR BREATH) of the kind you get in any food mart or grocery shop (which you need to Grill or reheat at home before you can eat the same). We were completely stunned to say the least and had not at all expected such a bummer!! For all we know, it was probably procured from the nearby roll shop or the food court outlet at the other end of the Mall and served up with the fancy wavy sauce designs and cilantro florets!! Definitely tasted that way.

At the end I would like to mention that we are 3 middle aged women, 2 Entrepreneurs and a COO of an established hospital who were exploring a new outlet in town, hoping to return soon. We were disappointed with the high handed attitude of the staff and the lack of any attention to the customers’ needs. To the future patrons of Ozora Sky bar – DO DEMAND TO BE SERVED WITH RESPECT. 

TO OZORA STAFF – A) UNDERSTAND THE DICTUM ‘THE CUSTOMER IS KING’ (or in our case, Queens) B) DO NOT SERVE SINEWY DIFFICULT TO CHEW MEAT - SUCH IS ONLY FIT FOR THE FLINTSTONES (Maybe your Chef is one), C) DO NOT TRY TO PASS OFF PACKAGED SEMI COOKED MEAT AS GOURMET CUISINE (Do not underestimate the palate of the common Kolkatan), AND D) DON’T SKIMP SO MUCH ON THE ALCOHOL THAT EVEN WOMEN CAN SENSE THE DEFICIT.

I hope you will take the feedback to heart and turn the place around into the delight that it can become.

It doesn't feel that anybody at the place had any hotelier experience. The basic courtesy to serve a customer was lost. The ambience ,that is , only the view was great. Apart from that the music as well as the service was the worst ever. They took 1 hour after taking our order to inform us that they wouldn't be able to serve us the food. Basically , the place wasn't ready to be opened just as yet.

I visited this place tonight.I entered at 9:10 PM with my family.They provided us a table at 10:20 PM.That too after approaching the restaurant manager and  various waiters multiple times.We ordered the food.At 11:30 we got annoyed since the food had not yet come.At 11:45 they returned our money back and we left the place around 11:50.I wasted my 3 hours and didn't get any food.If the people aren't ready to manage the rush and can't provide proper service why open a restaurant?And yes the manager cannot be more ignorant than he was today.He doesn't even know where we are sitting.The guy is busy serving drinks to people.Dude you have waiters for that!Try to manage your customers better.The hype created about this restaurant is just too much.This was one of my worst experiences.And i'm not writing it because I have time for this useless review.It's because the time we left the restaurant.We had no other option but to go home empty stomach.Huge round of applause to the restaurant and everyone associated with it.Thank you.

Very unprofessional behaviour even before the start. Had called up and confirmed today's opening but when we reached there they said it won't be opening today the plan has changed. when we have things going viral on internet, such a reaction is not acceptable and also they could have called up and informed that the plan has changed. Was very unprofessional of them.

The rating is entirely for the ambience ❤
This 20th floor roof top cafe has better ambience than any other cafe in the town.
We ordered Aglio Olio Pepperoncino Pizza, Penne Arrabiata Pasta, Orange creme brulee dessert, Mango merry mocktail and Kingfisher ultra beers.
Penne Arrabiata Pasta is a red sauce pasta with chilli flakes and tossed with Penne - delicious. Recommended.
Other dishes were below average. Half of their dishes and drinks were not available. The Orange Creme brulee dessert is totally a waste of money.
Even the staffs do not have proper information about the content and availability of food. They'd take the order and return after 10 minutes to inform that dishes aren't available.
The entry into the cafe is a bit confusing. You need to go the Acropolis basement B1 and take an office lift to the 20th floor.
We chose to sit in the outdoor sitting arena. We had to pay Rs. 1000 per person cover charge which was redeemable - later adjusted with the billing amount.
Overall, I would recommend Ozora highly for the ambience. The chilly winter breeze, the music in the background and the view from the 20th floor together create heaven of an atmosphere! 😍

Lot of improvement needed in almost every aspect. Only positive thing here is the view from the top. Nothing apart from the view is worth a word. You just cannot afford to have that kind of attitude just bcoz of the view ...Quality Food & Prompt Service is the primary thing that a customer looks for and Ozora miserably fails in both. It seems that the management till date is thoroughly confused about the policy matters since the service staffs & manager comes up with different answers everytime on a same issue. Staffs have no idea about the availability of items mentioned in the menu. They go to the manager....manager in turn goes to the kitchen...and by the time the manager returns the service guy is taking order at other table.....its full on mess !!

Well i went there with my three friends, one girl who is my good friend and two male friends, initially had to face some idiots at the front desk, they said stags are not allowed, but i called up earlier before reaching there, and i was not informed regarding the same, so after reaching there, they were saying this stupid indian thing, that Stags are not allowed..now this was not not acceptable by me at that time..I wish to live a single life, so...where on earth, we have such laws or any such article in the book of our Constitution..Just because my other two friends who didnt come with a girl,the front desk girl from north east i believe was being hardheaded about this. I tried to explain them that it is not about entering here, i dont care anways but it is just i wasted my time coming all the way here and i have a guest from a foreign country, he must be feeling bad about this and it doesn't look right..But she was rigid to her decision. Now at 8:40pm, from where on earth i am going to get girls for my friends, one of my friend is single , even i am single , it is just a girl who is just my friend came to meet me and my other friend who is 53yrs old, Thai National, still single...Now what?
But i believe the floor manager who came to talk to me as i was very upset as i wasted my time..But he heard what i had to say , remained calm and understood the situation and after a little bit of arguments, the manager or the supervisor made it smooth and easy for us from there on and i was thankful to him for not being an obnoxious person , he said some private party was going on at the terrace, however almost all the seats were reserved but the manager managed the table for us and he definitely understood my situation, so no complaints, as he managed the whole situation easily. But this is what we had to face being stags..I understand some clubs, lounge has different rules but atleast the staff should inform that on call, if someone calls for some enquiry and is coming and already asking about the events for the tonight and so.. Driving in Kolkata is already a mess and now after reaching somewhere u get to hear, bro u cant enter, get a gf first, i am just saying....No Way...I value my time...
Anyways nevermind, afterwards the experience was really good.
The place has really nice ambience and good sober crowds. Winter season is the best to enjoy the rooftop open terrace party. We were total 4 people, charged 1000 Rupees per head to enter. We had almost everything,ate like apes and drank like there is no tommorow. Bill came to 21,595 Rupees that includes Alcohol. Just one little information to the management and to the front desk receptionist that in Kolkata or in India, not everyone has a gf and it is not necessary to have a gf in my life, one can remain single and enter as stags and spend more than bunch of couples can do..Who knows..Right? So be good and be soft on stags too..I am not rating you down as i believe some training to the ladies who were at the counter can help and make this a better place. Food was excellent and made me happy and so do all the male staff whose behavior were really nice and polite..Overall i am Happy and so my friends with the Rest of the Serviced been provided..So no further Complaints or anything..It is just my feedback..if it might help you at all..Though not expecting anything..

View of Kolkata frm 20th floor.... That is the USP of the place... Very nice ambience specially the open terrace really is great(cover charge of Rs1000 per head needed).... So 5 star on that front..  very few place in Kolkata to beat that(only can think of Blue & beyond in esplanade & Whatsup near Golpark to an extent maybe )
Now coming to the food... That is where don't expect much.... Wont say the food is bad but it is average specially given the price they charge...have been twice in the place but I dont remember name of any dish.... Also my friends ordered LIT and othr cocktail.... Those r also not vry good and tasted more like mocktail....
But overall if u want njoy with ur friends in a nice place u can definitely visit the place

The food and drink is upto the mark, the ambience in the open air space is worth mentioning. What needs to be improved is by training the staff. The staff are not courteous especially the ladies at the desk. If someone can ignore the impolite behaviour of the staff there then one can consider the place.

only thing that's great about this place is the ambiance. the open rooftop of Acropolis was really something. but evrything else was trash. especially the music. and the price.. well.. excessively overpriced, even taking into the fact that bar is at the 20th floor of a renowned mall with a awesome view. overall, if u have deep pocket u can check out the place once or twice just for the view.

My experience with Ozora was simply incredible.As we arrived,we were greeted by smiling faces and were guided towards our table.The view was breath taking.We ordered spaghetti frutti di mare which was really good and among starters,we ordered mustard grilled prawn which we felt was a bit on a higher side.
Overall good experience with exceptional service!

View of Kolkata frm 20th floor.... That is the USP of the place... Very nice ambience specially the open terrace really is great(cover charge of Rs1000 per head needed).... So 5 star on that front..  very few place in Kolkata to beat that(only can think of Blue & beyond in esplanade & Whatsup near Golpark to an extent maybe )
Now coming to the food... That is where don't expect much.... Wont say the food is bad but it is average specially given the price they charge...have been twice in the place but I dont remember name of any dish.... Also my friends ordered LIT and othr cocktail.... Those r also not vry good and tasted more like mocktail....
But overall if u want njoy with ur friends in a nice place u can definitely visit the place

The food and drink is upto the mark, the ambience in the open air space is worth mentioning. What needs to be improved is by training the staff. The staff are not courteous especially the ladies at the desk. If someone can ignore the impolite behaviour of the staff there then one can consider the place.

One of the other restaurants trying to build a reputation for itself in the Kasba area is Ozora on the top of Acropolis Mall. This is one high end restaurant for your important food over business meet, family dinners, parties and expensive date nights that'd never go wrong, added to which is the prospect of rooftop dining in one of the tallest buildings in the area.

Yes, the place serves hookah and alcohol and seats around 60 inside and 60 outside (may be more, definitely not less). Upon entering the Acropolis Mall it might be a bit tricky to find your way up, there're different elevators to reach the 20th floor from different levels. What I may suggest if you're bringing a personal vehicle, is you could park your car in the basement and use the elevator that takes you directly to the 20th floor right away. It's always safer to make a pre booking and reservation, although we didn't. The seating inside has wooden chairs and tables or you may seat yourself on the sofa with your gang. There's the entrance, the reception and a mini bar on one side and the other side opens out to the rooftop. False ceiling, large glass windows and decorative lighting gives the restaurant a classy feel. The rooftop is decorated with a wooden flooring, indoor plants and white chairs and tables. The balcony overlooks a mesmerizing view of the southern part of Kolkata city which looks even better at night with the sparkling glow of city lights.

We entered the restaurant pretty late at night at around 10pm when most of the customers inside were almost done with their dinner, so we seated ourselves comfortably. There was quite a nightlife vibe with the DJ playing dance music. It was pretty chilly outside on the rooftop on a winter evening but there still were a lot of customers till midnight. I liked the fashioning of tall glasses in which they served water. A waitress handed over a tabloid for us to decide on the menu.

I must say we took quite some time to summarise the order to the waitress, but she served relatively quickly considering it was almost midnight and there were only two or three waiters waiting on the rest of the customers. We started off with Sweet Corn Chicken soup, on a suggestion because the sea food options weren't available. This was followed by appetisers: Chicken Olivetti and Grilled Fish with Caper Butter Sauce. Both the dishes were served on small rectangular plates. They were neatly organised considering colours and patterns on the plate, but, in my opinion, the portions for the price wasn't reasonable. The Grilled Fish was very well cooked and was soft to bite. It tasted even better with the yellow lemon caper sauce topped on it. Chicken Olivetti was stuffed pieces of chicken served with minced slices of beet and olives on the side. There were five pieces on the plate and the dish was really well prepared and served.

We ordered mocktails and Red Bull as we waited for the main course to arrive. Fresh Lime Soda was just perfect and Willy Orageio was a pleasant surprise. The latter was a nice spicy mix of oranges, apples and cranberries served in a 200 ml glass with ice cubes, it was moderately sweet. The main course arrived in about 20 minutes or so. We ordered platters: Chicken Gorgonzola and again upon suggestions, the much acclaimed Scottish Salmon. Chicken Gorgonzola was a reasonable piece of sliced chicken breast served with white pasta sauce, mashed potatoes and veggies. The chicken was nice and tender. It tasted better with pasta sauce and mashed potatoes. I could hint a taste of spinach, delicious cheese, black pepper and olive oil. The veggies weren't sliced into smaller pieces which made it difficult to slice it up on the plate. Overall it was a remarkable gustatory experience.

From Italy we flew right into the heart of Scotland when we ordered the Scottish Salmon. By a clear look of it we figured out why it was one of the most expensive dishes on the menu. It was an explicitly designed Salmon Steak served with boiled potato, beet and beans, and charred lime and a charred salmon fin on top. On the side of the plate was yellow pasta sauce. Decoratively they had put a slice of beet in between two circular slices of boiled potatoes and a bean on top. The Salmon Steak was peach and orange in colour and looked surreal on the dish. Upon slicing it up I realised how tender it is and it felt juicy and delicious to taste with a hint of lemon juice once I took a bite of it, an absolute culinary perfection. It was just adequately cooked, and didn't feel raw at all. It wasn't over cooked either, tasting so different and better with sauce and salad. There is not a Salmon of doubt that this is one of the most heavenly dishes I have tried, and is totally worth the price and patience.

Here I must mention, that the place has an exquisite looking menu with Indian, Oriental, Pizzas, Breads, Sandwiches, Risottos and many more options to chose from. From my personal experience, it clearly hasn't left a room for complaint against the menu, ambience or service. With several alcoholic options, hookah and a vibrant nightlife, this place has a lot of reasons to return time and again. The price is steep with the initial cover charge but the experience is worth it as there is something for everyone's taste and liking, which is very favorable for large groups.

Adieu!

The moment you enter, the ambience feeds on you. Even in October it felt cold, 20 floors above the hustle bustle of the city this is a place to visit and it should definitely be on your list but not for the food. Food is average. The ambience will blow your mind but the food will not take you back but if hookah and snacks is what you care most about than nothing beats this place.

A pathetic experience over there. It's okk when you open a restaurant on the 20th floor. But it doesn't mean you can charge anything. The rooftop is the only reason for the experiment. Each and every item is overpriced. A simple hookah costs 1000 Rs. A pint of beer starts from 350/- even if it's kingfisher. Coming to the music... Literally they played pathetic musics which makes you feel depressed as well as frustrated. The staffs are so fast...that they only took 20 mins to come up with the bill. Thanks to you and the management.

I was amazed to see such a huge open space converted into a resto bar and that too of this quality in Kolkata. Really well done,almost has the looks of the roof top bars I've been to in London or Singapore. So the standards of the place is really good. The view is excellent and on breezy evenings it is a perfect spot

What we Ordered:

-Dal Makhni Tartlets : I don't like fusion food at all. Dal Makhni is for naan and should not be messed around with

-Pan Tossed Mushrooms: it's what the name suggests and it was decent

-Jiaozi Chicken : perfectly crisped up and spiced. Really liked this. Went excellent with the cold beer and the breezy winter evening.

The service was good overall although the crowd seemed a little underwhelming. The music playing was great so kudos to the DJ on the console

Really bad bad service, we were sitting in the restaurant where only one steward was there to serve us , we literally had to call the steward and place the order. After 40 mins of placing the order when we asked about the food they said there was a ticketing problem and the food wasn’t ordered to the  kitchen. After all the harassment when we got the food there was no one to serve us water. The management really need to look into the service seriously as we had asked two to three people for the order but everyone seemed to be confused with serving water and even taking order.The steward asked us  to make place on the table to serve food as he was carrying food for two tables, it seemed like he was obliging us by atleast serving us the food which even came after 1 hour.
The food was good though but it really spoiled our night. This kind of service make a bad name for the place like this.
A big thumbs down as we were really disappointed.

✓Chicken tikka meat ball tart
✓Sound of sea(fish fry)
✓Mishti doi cheesecake(was perfect one)

This place has an amazing view and some delicious food. Located at the 20th floor of Accropolis mall this place is not easy to find. ONly one lift from downstairs goes there. So we had to do quite ups and downs to reach. But it was completely worth. The stuffs were really good and friendly. The prices are in the higher side but considering the ambience and the food quality I did not mind paying.

Apart from the ambience, when it comes to food quality and staff service, both are equally appreciable even though we had to wait for half n hour to get the seat in the lounge..but the wait is worth it.💝

Today I visited this much hyped restaurant located on the 20th floor of Acropolis mall. To enjoy the outdoor seating and view they charge a cover charge of 1000 per head. It is redeemable by ordering food but not refundable. We ordered G-string and mojito. Both were refreshing. We ordered Grilled fish in caper butter sauce and Moroccan chicken and mixed Hakka noodles. We also ordered jalapeño poppers but the waiter suggest a mushroom dish to try instead and it was very bad. Very bad suggestion I must say. The grilled fish was  melt in your mouth delicious. Moroccan chicken was okayish. The quantity of Hakka noodles was on the lower side and the flavours wasn't that great.. was okayish as well. The view however is amazing and the weather got really chilly adding to the atmosphere along with the music playing in the background. The service was slow at the beginning. They took a lot of time to serve the starters but after that it was fine. Overall a nice experience mainly owing to the amazing outdoor ambience of the place. The food can definitely do with some improvements.

The view is breathtakingly beautiful as you see the sunset and the city lights lit up gradaually with some perfect music in background.
Haha,the view was so good that couldn't refrain myself from being poetic & all.
I will highly recommend their outfoor section to the lovely couples for a memorable datenight.
You need a cover charge of 1k per head to sit outside and this is redeemable.

Now,coming to the food,it was a good experience dining here.

Can't explain in words how great the view from the 20 floor is! We ordered a number of dishes republic of chicken, new age makhani, pork toichin and tianjin lamb. Pork was good. The one thing I disliked is the extremely loud noise. It was so breezy up above it would have been really great if it were calmer. It was like an open air club but i guess many people like it. We couldnt hear ourselves talking. I can go that place again for the view. <3 the other thing which was weird is the we had to give entry fee of 1000 which was later included in the total bill of food and alcohol. I found it meaningless. We ordered 4 main course and 5 beers. The bill was 4500. :o

This sky lounge bar is located on the 20th floor of Acropolis Mall. Its entrance is from the mall parking sides and has nothing to with the mall entrance. It takes a certain amount of cover charge which can be reedeemed while placing the order.

The ambience is simply awesome and a perfect place for a romantic date. Sitting arrangements are made for both indoor and outdoor. Food quality is good but the quantity is less. Hookahs are available. Prices of the of the food and the drinks are on the higher side.

Try to visit this place once during the evening as it gives an open view of the entire city clearly and can make you awestruck.

Cocktails were good we had long island ice tea, mohito, daiquiri and cosmo and i am happy to say that all were good.

Surprisingly the starters were also top class which was a bit surprise since their food was getting lambasted on zomato.

Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable!

Currently one of the best dine outs in Kolkata... Situated on the 20th floor of Acropolis with a jawdropping view of Kolkata's skyline and enthralling ambience and scrumptious platter to make your night....it is a must try for all food lovers..... It offers you a multi cuisine dining and being true to all its cuisines presents you the best of it.... It has both an open outdoor sitting area (strictly maintained for adults) and indoor dining space..... The place starts serving at 4pm which continues till midnight.... Live Music by Djs will surely groove you into a peppy mood and is one of the main highlights of the place... Simply naming some as best would be an injustice to the other dishes... However desserts here are a must!! Cost for 2 would be 2k approximately... But the supreme food quality is worth to be paid for.

Ozora made our day! I was looking for a nice rooftop cafe for a romantic meal. We went to Whatsup Cafe first at southern avenue and was majorly disappointed. Next stop was Ozora and it just made up for everything.

The view was breathtaking. The ambience , amazing. The food was lip smacking and pretty different too. What I loved the most was the service. There was no rush, no up-selling. Very polite and friendly people. I loved the privacy and the romantic ambience. It's great for friends too. I have recommended this place to so many people in person, on FB and in food groups of FB too lol. Just that the risotto the service person recommended was nice but with an Indian touch whereas we had stated that we wanted Conti. Other than that everything was great. Planning to visit again.

Unfortunately we went on a rainy day and weren't able to enjoy the 20th floor view. We ordered Valentino pizza and a beer. They charged service taxes separately, don't know why(they will inform you while entering) . I found nothing out of the box in that sense. Only thing is that you order over the tab.

We ordered starters but they did not have that also.
They have the stocks which cost more than 1200 bucks which is pathetic. The behaviour of the staffs where the worst..I would recommend not to visit the place.

Speaking of the Food... Indian items like Kadhai chicken were a let down...however the dish Republic of Chicken was a saving grace ! Mango mocktail was also good!
Creme brûlée is a thumbs up!

I'll give it a 4 star because i really like the open area (read sky-deck).. I don't drink much and so I ordered very limited as I was alone and so no point of discussing it either..  But will definitely give it a try later someday. :)

It is a great party place. The view from the rooftop is breath-taking. Wonderful ambiance. Service is good. But coming to food, its not upto the mark. Underwhelming and overpriced.

The place has an amazing view but they will charge you a cover of RS 1000 to sit outside in the open. Foods are with fancy name and garnishing but not really very tasty. Same is with the cocktails. The bar is pricey and not at all well stocked. It's so poorly stocked that they dont even have beers like Heineken. The ambience of the place is the only plus point. The staff is average, they dropped our servings even before arriving our table and blamed it on the heavy wind which is quite normal at the height of 20th floor. Subsequently, they didn't even bother to replenish. And they still charge a mandatory service charge of 10% which is against Govt and consumer forum order.  Potion of food is also not very good. Overall the place is unjustifiably pricy.

This should be at level -20

We always wanted to go to this place. As soon as we were entering they told us to pay a cover of a grand per head to sit outside. We told them that we really didn’t want to drink or eat much so there’s no point of taking the cover. They insisted that we have to pay and only then we shall be allowed. We said we’ll sit inside. Asked if we could go out and just check it out. They said only one person. We still went in and sat down to order. We weren’t that hungry and we decided to order a few drinks. When they said the drink I asked for was not in stock I told my folks let’s leave. Instantly the waiter was like Sir we do have it available. I was like okay. Get that. A bunch of other cocktails were ordered too and they didn’t deserve another round. But half their menu wasn’t available. We asked the manager what’s the point of paying a grand a person if you don’t have half the things on the menu, he replied “You give us the money, we’ll let you sit out”. We finished up quickly and left. 

PS: Don’t go. The staff is unreasonable and dumb. Didn’t try the food. But don’t want to either.

Needless to say this place is talk of the town because of its height..In kolkata if you search for rooftop resturants u wont get much options whereas this resturant is in 20th floor..the view is amazing...Fortunately the day we went the weather was very good...So the ambience is great and the food is also good in taste and also in presentation..The choice of music is also good..The price is on higher side..2 mocktails..2 non veg starters and one sheesha costs 2700 bucks..Overall I loved the experience..And would love to visit again..

I visit kolkata very less these days as I stay in Bangalore aka pub capital of India. But I must say kolkata has come up with quite a few good places recently, one of them is Ozora. They have an open lounge area on the 20th floor which is the main attraction. Good music, good ambience and good food, what extra do u need! Perfect for dinner dates or hanging out with friends. Little expensive though, but a must visit !

Thanks to ozora for giving us four friends such a fabulous experience on the 20th floor and the fact that we could capture the whole of kolkata during durga puja is just worth the money we spent. We went there during a dry day and hence instead of 1000rs cover charge(for the rooftop charge which was not charged due to dry day) we had to just pay for the food we had. As for the food, it was just equally good as the view. Their pizza definitely gets a bonus from me. We had ordered 4 mocktails which were highly pleasant for the eve ( the kiwi one, one spicy one, one mango mist and another one which had the nutty nomenclature), one kasha pizza ( this one deserves a bonus from me), one nam prik pla which was okay, the penne and white sauce pasta which also was lovely and another moo shu chicken(basically a fried rice served with a chicken side dish). Considering my not so obsession with italian cheesy dishes, their dishes really gave a surprising twist to my taste buds. It was expensive but worth it. Total bill amount was 3600 for 4 people.  So lots of thumbs up from me, OZORA. Deducting .5 because of the overpriced hookah and that is rs 1000. But go for the view and food.

Woooooooooooh!!! Still in the hangover of Ozora..yeah..no doubt the best place in Kolkata to hangout.I went there around 7:30.
The place welcomes with a bright moonlight,awesome ambience and foot tapping songs.
The view of the city..Amar Sohor from 20th floor is just mind boggling. Yea..the price is too high.but I recommend every one to visit atleast once there.
As liquor was not allowed due to dry day, so we could not have that.
Rest the shisha was too overpriced.Rs 763 is too high for a normal mint flavour.
In food we took Mozambique Chicken,Chicken tikka meat ball and KOLKATA ON THE RUN.
Why I wrote the last item,you will get once you taste it.
A 5* to OZORA

It was saptami during durga puja eve and we skipped pandal hopping due to slight rain. Every year in saptami we used to visit acropolis mall, this year also we did the same thing, but the place changed. We gang of 6 people went to Ozora. Either you have to take a direct lift from parking to 20th floor otherwise you have to go to 5th floor and change the lift to 20th floor. The entry will charge you 1000 bucks per person. The speciality of Ozora was ambiance, simply breathtaking. A roof top view, good music, enchanting decor, heart winning food, what else you need to enjoy the perfect puja day. The hospitality was very good but very expensive, it will burn a hole in your pocket. A must visit place who wants a romantic date, chilling with friends or a calm dining with loved ones.

Visited this place thrice in the past 1 month.

The most striking thing is the visual the terrace offers, the landscape of Kolkata as seen before touchdown. This is truly stunning! This is really what makes the moolah worth it.

Everything else does its bit. The hookah is good,the cocktails are good too. I quite liked the red wine sangria on offer, the LIT and few other cocktails are upto the mark.

Good starters, esp the daab Chingari , the Behari chicken kebab. I liked the pizza they make here.

Some of the attendants are excellent, while a few others seem indifferent. The service is not bad, no not at all, but that is the area where there is opportunity of improvement.

Again, full marks to this place for the view it affords of my favourite place on earth, everything else pales before it.

The rooftop ambience and the music is to die for.A bit on the expensive side but the view of the entire city from above the twenth floor of ozora totally makes up for it.Very romantic ambience.Food,mocktails all are nice.We ordered frencj fries(asked for extra chat masala to make it spicy coz it tasted bland bt it was crispy although),kasha chicken pizza which was so soft and good,tandoori prawns served in sizzler base,fish reshmi kabab which was super-soft,chicken nuggets which came with a mint flavoured mayonise that was just awesome and a vanilla mint flavoured hookah which was strong enough to get u a high feeling..In mocktails we took mango mist,cucumber cooler,gandhoraj basil mojito and cocktails of green apple margarita,kaffir lime martini and green apple martini..For the rooftop sittng they have a cover charge of rupess one thousand per head.

Ambience : 4/5 
The open rooftop comes with a great view of the city. Great for sunsets and nights. The DJ plays a decent playlist. 

Service : 4/5 
Courteous staff and friendly bartenders.

Food : 3/5
Underwhelming. Tried Chicken stuffed chillies, Meat balls, Chicken Mozambique, Chilly Fish and a few more. Nothing really great, at least in the starters. Below par.

Drinks : 2.5/5
Very limited options available. The menu is pretty elaborate but they didn't have most of things in stock.

Cost : 2/5
A little on the higher side. Would have been alright if the food was good and if the bar was stocked. 


Likelihood to visit again : Not really. The view and ambience is the only good thing about this place. Won't be coming back for the food for sure.

I usually do not give such a high rating to any place, but Ozora is exceptional. This place is atop 20 floors on the Acropolis main building. The view is simply breathtaking. The place charges a cover of 1000 per pax which is redeemable. Also they charge a service charge of 10%. Even then the prices are quite okay. The food here is amazing- Must try "Kolkata on the Run" and "Shah Suri Kebab".

Decor, service, staff, food, drinks - all top class. And that view from roof - wow! A five-star place. I am a regular visitor of Acropolis mall, but never knew it has a hidden treasure on the 20th floor. 

We were 4 people. We had a vodka martini, long island, orange crush and some beers in the drinks. And ordered some fish, chicken and lamb starters with the drink. And not to forget the mutton kasha pizza - a true fusion.

Only one caution: This place is little difficult to locate. You have to take elevators from the other side of the mall. Or, if you are inside the mall, take the elevator to 5th floor and then locate the lifts which take you to the 20th floor. 

We will come back again!

Great place. At the top of the Acropolis Mall with awesome view and awesome ambience.
But its no the only thing which makes places best. You have to be good on food part also. Food was not at per nor in terms of quality neither in terms of quantity keeping in mind the value.
Staffs was good and service also good. But should improve the food in part.

Only for the view and ambience it's not a value for money place.

Yes once in a festive season ok.

The first thing about Ozora is the ambience. The restaurant is located on the top floor of Acropolis and view from the top is nothing short of breathtaking. The restaurant is divided into two sections..one part is the rooftop and the other a more conventional section. Since I visited with my kid the rooftop was out of bounds for me. Still the interior was also very nice and cosy. Food is also great and service very prompt and courteous. Just go for it..you will yearn for more.

This place was in my bucket list for a long time.  Finally i made a visit to this place on chaturthi. 
It is located at Acropolis  mall on the 20th floor. 
A cover charge of 1000 bucks is needed per person if you choose to seat at the roof top.  It is not applicable for the dinning hall seating arrangements. 
After you will pay the cover charge you will be provided with coupons of Rs 1000 bucks, which you will provide while billing,  that the total amount is redeemed in the final bill. But this amount is not refundable.  The prices of the food items are quite high so the thought of getting minimum bill less than Rs 2000 doesnot arrise. 
The behaviour of the staffs were great and the ambience was heaven. 
Getting the total view of the city Kolkata from 20th floor was really awsome.  The cool breeze blowing by with the view and great music just compliments each other.  The ambience is awsome.  One must vist the place,  and i promise you will not regret. 
Now coming to the food.. 
Food and drinks are costly.
1)Heineken beer 330 ml  costs Rs  285 
2)Orange Blast-A nice mocktail of oranges. Great in taste costs - Rs 220
3)Dry chilli chicken - Great in taste,  Quantity was good,  but overly priced.  It costs Rs 425
4)Behari Murgh Chandi Tikka - The flavours are too good,  nice in taste,  soft,  it comes in 6 pieces,  served with salad and chutney.  It costs Rs 375
5)Cigar di singhi - It is a desert item,  with rabdi,  it was unique in taste,  served wd a sweet sauce,  it costs Rs 340
6) Misti doi besan laddoo cheese cake - one must try this dessert,  this is awsome and totally unique in its context.  It was served differently by the chef.  It has both flavours of besan ki laddoo and misti doi.  It is a must try.  It costs Rs 310.
Over all these prices of the items they will incur service taxes of 10%. and 18% Gst (9% Cgst and 9% Sgst)  .
So in short,  the price and billing of this place is high,  but i would add,  the ambience  of this place worth the price. 
The food quality and quantity is good. 
And yeah please try misti doi besan laddoo cheese cake for sure. 
Overall i spent a nice Chaturthi evening here.

The best rooftop place in Kolkata u can visit.. period. Awesome ambience and set-up. Just the place is too good to be true. Really magnificent must visit once. Apart from this everything is ordinarily done. Food is not that great and nothing exciting in menu nor much variety too choose from. Still u must be there to soak in that top of the world feeling u always needed.

Came here for the first time after seeing reviews, sat outside . you will enjoy the view but their service sucks real bad. The waiters are roaming around but have no real courtesy. they dont even ask about serving the food. just kept it on the table. asked for water got it like 10 minutes later that also after asking 2 times. I was about to take my whole company for lunch here but after seeing their poor service i decided not to because it will be a waste of money. food was okay but not so good either. so I wont be coming here for 2nd time until they improve.

Went for a team outing yesterday...since it was Friday evening, we started early and reached around 5 pm. You have to ask around to get to the restaurant once you get into Acropolis mall....
Starting with the best part...10/10 for ambience...the view from their rooftop is breathtaking and it is ideal for memorable dates. Since we went in evening we could experience the sky slowly moving from sunset hues to night stars...the music and the in sync light bulbs were icing on the cake
Coming to service, they clearly told that there is Rs 1000 cover charge which is non refundable but redeemable and 10% service charge on bill will be applicable as well. The staff is courteous, however serving time is longer which you might not mind if you have time to enjoy the ambience around
Last but not the least, the food. Well we ordered a lot of dishes and drinks since we spent around 3-4 hours. In veg starters, Naan sense and Abbati were ok-ok but Paneer Rubiyay Sumeri is a must have. My colleagues will recommend Prawns for the non-veg people. We also tried Pazo Pazo pizza and it was great to taste..best part being the thin crust..Main course stole the show with Rissotto (dal makkhani paneer) and Crossing the spinach line as suggested by the staff. Mocktails were good as well. We ordered Nutty Fruity, Kiwi Frappe and Orange Blast..
Overall, the price is definitely going to hit your pocket hard..so go to enjoy a full evening with time and money in hand..It's must-go when you are in City of Joy!!

Located on the 20th floor of Acropolis mall, ozora welcomes one with a great view of the city of Joy. The breezy weather, the rooftop restaurant and the night view of the city just makes you addicted to this restaurant (although the rooftop section has cover charges of 1000/- per person but its totally worth it) 

The place has a dance floor and as the night gets darker, the bar is lit up in red and the music beats loudly making u groove on ur seats. 

The food is good(honestly could be better) would recommend pizza and aglio olio pasta. 

The staff are welcoming and courteous and service is quick. 

Overall a nice place to go out to especially if you wanna see the whole view of the city and also some of the prominent landmarks of Kolkata!!

So me and my husband go to Ozora after hearing much about it from our  friends. They have a fancy tablet which has an extensive bar menu... but guess what, only 10 percent of the items mentioned in the menu is available... but thats not the part that spoiled my evening... the sheer fact that they dont want to sell the spirits that they dont want to sell although its available was something that made my evening turn from sour to bitter. One server says something is unavailable and then the manager comes and says we do have these available, I can get it for u...that too when we have paid the cheque and he was getting our feedback... I am not a person who likes giving negetive feedback but my experience at Ozora was so disappointing that I was compelled to give a review so that no one else's evening gets spoilt. Only 2 scotch and 2 beers available from such a fancy menu is beyond acceptable at a place like this.BTW the 2.5 is for the view and nothing else.

Firstly the ambience loved it..it's just perfect when you see Kolkata shining from such a height..but unfortunately that was not followed by some good food. Hugely disappointed with the food. Far below the expectation specially when you are taking a cover charge of Rs 1000 /head.

As to the service...They are damn slow.. I went on a weekday not that crown bt still took them 45 minutes for a French fries....
Food is awesome bt prices are on upper side...If you haven't been there just go at least one...Good experience

Best ambience in kolkata.. amazing view of the city of joy. Service okay but not great. The main problem is with food. Pathetic taste. You have to pay 1000 rs per person for entry in outside and u can redeem that with food. But we couldn't able to eat that much. They will not give u refund so u have to eat.. 😂 so after had mocktails and few appetizer(which was not up to the mark) we ordered desert. Misti doi cheesecake was good but dont u dare to try their icecream. It was so pathetic. Overall its nice place to hang out because of its ambience.

Ozora is the next party destination for all out there.Located on the 20th floor of the Acropolis mall, the sprawling space welcomes you with so much grandeur.The lounge is divided in to two sections ,the inside more formal dining space and the rooftop with a view of the whole city😍.For the rooftop section there is a cover charge of 1000 per person..for me it was totally worth the view and the ambience.As the night grew darker ,the bar lit up in red,the breezy weather and the pumping beats get you addicted to Ozora. The drinks were quite amazing Saikat being the man behind them.Coming to our orders

1.long island iced tea
2.cosmopolitan
3.kaffir lime mojito
4.classic mojito
5.a special from the bar man himself

For food

1.Abatti--crispy fried mushrooms with cheese filling
2.Nam prik pla--Sliced roasted fish with chilli 
3.chicken mozambique-chicken croquettes filled with cheese chilli n herbs
4. spaghetti is white sauce with chicken and veggies

The drinks were well made with the kaffir lime n d classic mojito being my favourite.Having heard a lot of negative feedback for the food i was a bit sceptic at first but having a bit into the juicy mushrooms ...my doubts vanished into thin air.Though the quantity was little but every bite packed with flavours.The sliced roasted fish was quite spicy and tangy ...a nice change from the mushrooms.While the fish and the mushrooms were a hit at the table ,the chicken croquettes were quite bland.Next came the white sauce spaghetti with chicken and veggies---the sauce is to die for...definite recommendations for this one.Paired with my kaffir lime mojito this pasta and the view could make me sit here for hours .Staring at the skyline far with building rooftops the city looks gorgeous from Ozora.The staff is extremely attentive and always keeping a look at the table.If you want to enjoy your weekend with a loved one or party hard with friends Ozora is ur destination.Kudos team Ozora for putting up such an amazing place

Located on the 20th floor of acropolis mall. It has rooftop open terrace sorta seating. If you want to sit outside you have to pay a 1000 bucks cover charge per person. Also they will tell you as soon as you enter that they charge 10% service charge. Which is fine. The view is amazing and the best amongst all restaurants/ clubs/ pubs in Kolkata. It gives you a 360 view of the city. Coming to the menu. It's quite elaborate. The food is good. Liquor and food is on a higher side, but it's worth every penny coz of the ambience that you get. Only downside is the crowd. I guess it will improve over time. All in all a great place to go with friends or your spouse. I will certainly return.

This exquisite rooftop restaurant is an experience! At the 20th floor,  the ambience is one of a kind. There are options of sitting indoors but then why visit if you don't get the open air experience with an aerial view of the city! 
At the entrance, a cover charge of Rs 1000 per person had to be paid which was 'redeemable but not refundable'. 
The staff was courteous but nothing extraordinarily mention worthy. The food was similar to a fine dining experience given the  quantity they served. The music could have been more appropriate.
As a visitor, the experience was good and perhaps I'll visit again but they are overpriced and except for the fact that they have a beautiful ambience, there is definitely room for improvement. 
Probably because of it being on the 20th floor,  it is tough to get mobile connectivity and Ozora does not provide Wi-Fi making it a little less customer friendly.

Though the ambience of this place is great,it's very unfortunate what me and my friends faced here yesterday.The girl at the reception totally misguided us.The coupons of 1000 bucks they give you is redeemable and not refundable.She just forgot to mention that it has to be redeemed on the same very day of your visit.instead she clearly stated of redeeming the coupons the next time I visit.this lack of efficiency on her part cost me extra 4000bucks.i will never visit this place again n will ask the management to atleast take a step to refund the amount or just simply replace your staff.highly disappointed.

Ambience! Ambience! Ambience! This place is undoubtedly the best rooftop place in Cal. Their drinks are great. We had Cosmo pitcher and Mohito pitcher which was nice with sufficient quantity of alcohol. Next is food, which was kinda average for me.

One of the finest place I have visited in Kolkata. Obviously the mesmerizing view from the top is the USP of the place. You get see the entire City of Joy shining under the moonlight. Perfect place for a romantic date or for someone who is passionate about clicking pictures (like me!). 

The place has both indoor as well as outdoor sitting option. However for outdoor sitting there is a Cover Charge of Rs 1000 per person which is fully redeemable and non-refundable. The place offers good variety of both veg & non-veg items along with drinks & sheesha (hookah). The pricing of the items have also been done in a manner that one can recover the entire cover charge of Rs 1000 per person.
 

Amazing view + Delicious food + quick service = Perfect evening!

Pros - Breathtaking view from the top, peaceful environment, tasty food, good service.

Cons - Cover charges per head is a bit too high to redeem in case you do not order hookah / drinks.

Happening place the lounge has good dim light excellent music.As it was a party invite so can't write much about it on personal level.cool arrangements only down side was the sitting arrangements in the dance area.you need sofas yaar. food was basically Indian and Italian the pesto pasta was very good creamy and tasteful . sun-dried tomatoes risotto was good too and obviously Indian food is always good at these joints.before I forget the starters which had mini pizzas.falafal makhani tart were worth a try.though not aware of the cost but next time you want to throw a party try it.happy eating

It's been a while that I had visited this place but couldn't write down the review for the '10 reviews per month' limit on Zomato. 
Ozora is creating much hustle at the moment for its spectacular position at the top of 20th floor. Opens at 4pm and that's the best time to visit this restaurant. You take a drink and some food and see how beautifully the sun sets amidst the lap of the concrete structures. 
It was a date night - a very special date night. We started at 4 in the evening and continued to dine till 9 at night. It's not that we had lots of food because it was amazing but it felt good to be there and spend time.
Coming to Ozora as a restaurant, I must say that service is very average. Nobody comes to fill the glasses and there's a very humiliating sense of ignorance in the attitude of the staffs. I just didn't like it. 
Next is food. We had the following items - 
Deep Sea Calamari 
Chicken Mozambique 
Deconstructed Daab Chingri 
Kolkata on the Run.
Liked the Chicken Mozambique dish. Rest were good, but nothing extraordinary to fascinate about.  
For drinks, we had taken two of them. The names I cannot recall right at this moment. But they were okayish. I like mocktails with a spicy twist. In my drink, the punch of Chilli came as a hit on the brain. It lacked subtlety and I hated it. 
There was Mishti Doi Besan Laddoo Cheesecake as suggested by the staffs at Ozora. From the beginning, all of the food items weren't great but they weren't that disheartening to pull your mood down. This dessert, oh goodness, was so freaking bad! It was so sweet that I got a very bad nausea. Never ever, ever ever try this dessert at Ozora! 
The reason for giving Ozora a 3.5 is their ambience which is presently offered by no other restaurant in the city. Else for the food and service, the place is very average. Pocket pinch is also pretty high. They charge you 1000 bucks per person as cover charge during weekends to sit outside (everyone comes here for that reason only!), which is redeemable but not refundable. That's the catch. If you want to sit outside, you have to eat worth the cover charge paid, else you will be on the losing side.
If they wish to retain in the long run, they have to keep up high and improve quite a lot on the basic things. Else with time, the place is going to fall apart. This is what I think about one of the romantic restaurants of the city, 'perfect for a date' location of the town. 
May come back for the ambience again, but definitely not the food! Happy Dining! :)

This place is over priced  The ambience is the main thing where paying such a hefty amount is worth it. Foods are extremely costly and quantity is also not that huge. Taste is not bad as such. If u have to visit Ozara go for the open roof and order snaks and hookah. The view of Kolkata from 20th floor is just mind blowing.....it gives a glimpse of how beautiful the city of joy looks.

"ozora or being under the blue sky". An experience of the twilight raising the curtain of stars. In the silence of dark, on the roof top along with luxury of having mocktails, that's how you enjoy the view of series of headlight gradually heading home, that's too with numbers favourite melodies. It couldnot have been better without bites of murgh pizza and barthas. You will never feel like returning home but time passed so fast even faster than thoughts..One of the best place in kolkata i hv ever been.

You can never regret going to this place. You want to party, go there. You are sad, go there. It can never be wrong. The winds on the 20th floor are heavenly. On a rain-soaked night it is as amazing as it gets. The lights around and the city sprawling around soothes you. The menu is quirky. The eccentric names would confuse your mind and taste buds. But the food is served beautifully. And the taste will melt your heart. The drinks are good as well. The presence of good friends made the experience all the more memorable.

Ozora is located on the 20th Floor of the Acropolis. Had an amazing time over here. We sat over at the terrace area where the wind was pretty good. We ordered for the starters which were pretty excellent. A special mention to their virgin mary which was perfect. Took the fruit rasna flavour in hookah. Pretty mild and well done.

Visited this place on a Saturday. Located on the 20th floor of acropolis mall. It was not that much crowded. The recieptionists were good but there is room for improvement in respect of their communication. 
There are two segments of the place - the rooftop section and the normal in house section. 
For the rooftoop, you need to pay 1000 rs. Per person as a coverage charge which is REEDEMABLE but not refundable. It gets deducted from the bill amount. The view is beautiful from here. There is live dj in this section. The choice of music is also good, although a bit loud. 
In the in house section there is no such charge required.the staffs are really courteous. For 2 people it charged about Rs. 2800. We ordered two pint beer each, gaelic cheese bread and wok tossed chicken. The food quality is good but yes a bit overpriced.
Overall the experience was good and a nice place to hangout.

​ Ozora provides a breath taking view of South Kolkata from its 20th floor rooftop. The interiors are glitzy and well decorated. But the food is not so awesome, considering the high price.

the only thing good about this place is the roof top ambience. other than that nothing was up to the mark. starting from the direction or the path leading to the restaurant; from 4th floor of Acropolis Mall to reach Ozora. the staff & services are 'okay'. the lamp in our table too was a defective one. it was non-functional. despite spending quite a long time there the staff did nothing to fix it. the food was not too good compared to the price. moreover, they charge some extra taxes out of nowhere.

not much recommended one.

The place need to work on their menu. We went there after dinner for cold coffee ans some finger foods. The place didnt have cold coffee on their menu and it was mid summer. However we settle down on one mocktail, 1 chocolate and one pista ice cream. The order came quite late, the ice was just regular one. Mocktail was just ok. The choco moose was extraordinary.

Most points are for ambience and location food is not the best thing that the resturant can offer.

The Restaurant is on the 20th Floor of Acropolis Mall. The view of the city from there is breathtaking. The view is what will attract any person to this place and definitely the ambience of the place with the music. You have to pay the cover charge of Rs 1000 per person which is redeemable on food and drinks.  Coming to food,it was tasty. There were variety of food items. Beverages were also too good. Hookah is available too. You should definitely visit the place.

Wow what a spectacular sight of kolkata. Right at the 20th floor in Acropolis kasba the restaurant is situated. Kolkata needs more of these high rise roof top restaurants. 

As I entered it was informed to me that the place has a cover charge of 1 grand and considering the place it was just fine. Moreover being an LIIT lover 1 grand was worth it. 

The place is just out of the world considering kolkata. It's on the 20th floor with a beautiful sight of literally the entire kolkata. The music and the decor is just great. It's an huge place considering a roof top restaurant. The bar situated right in the middle has its own charm. Perfect place for a private party or a romantic dinner. But WAIT GUYS. WE WON'T CONSUME THE AMBIANCE. 

NOW HERE COMES THE MAIN PART. 

As I have mentioned that I'm a LIIT (coctail) lover and when I tasted it ....... it was just lime, sugar syrup and coke. Where was the ALCOHOL ?? On asking for a stronger drink I was given the same glass with more sugar syrup. 

Taking the waiters suggestion went for this chef special fried crispy chicken. It was Horrible. Horrible. The coating had a bad odour and the chicken fiber was very bad. 

Since it had a cover charge and I had gone with a friend we had to consume the rest of the amount. Taking no further chance ordered for a taquila and left.  

But my thirst for some good food and coctail still was lingering.  
Hence went to Hopipolla and was very satisfied.  

Over all a beautiful place. Out of the world ambiance for an evening. Very cool music.  Kolkata looks great from the top. BUT that's it. Horrible food. Coctail are equivalent to moctails.

If you prefer ambience over food, Ozora is certainly your call. Tad over-pricing for horribly cooked, distasteful food is a big disappointment. There is no cover charge. The drinks were only good. We ordered Virgin Mojito, Republic of Chicken, Rissotto and a strawberry-flavoured drink. The staff were NOT that courteous. Will NEVER recommend this place.

I was told over the gate , sir we have seat for 04 people and since u r 2 people can't give-  I agreed to her point !! I asked what are the hotel policy 
They said first come first serve ? Then why was I denied giving seat - then all of a sudden they told me sir it is reserved - A LIE 
I called ozora from the ground floor n asked for reservation they simply said !! 
SIR on Saturday we don't reserve the seat 
2 diff ppl with diff answers 
It's a humble request to the management if u are within a framework of ur policy !! FIRST COME FIRST SERVE !!! atleast don't lie 
N don't give bogus reason afterwards that it was reserved for members 
SIMPLY PATHETIC 
BUT FOR SURE I LL VISIT AGAIN N RATE U WITH FULL BELEIF N FAITH UR FOOD N EVERYTHING

Heard a lot about Ozora and its breathtaking ambience and view, so finally visited it few days back. There is a cover charge of Rs.1000 which is fully redeemable on food and drinks. The ambience was the main attraction. The view of kolkata from the 28th floor was amazing. Now coming to the food, it was my friend's b'day so they gave a small piece of brownie with candles which was complimentary. We tried 'Nam Prik Pla' which was was a fish oriental starter, tasted amazing and very much recommended. Then we ordered 'Republic of Chicken' and 'New age chicken Makhani'. Well frankly the Republic of chicken was not upto the mark, the chicken was very hard to chew upon and tasted nothing amazing. The new age chicken makhani was good, it was well made but again the chicken was really hard. These three items costed us Rs.2000. Oriental items are more recommended than continental ones.

The best part of this place is the view that you get from the 20th floor of acropolis mall!

You will hardly get a place like this in Kolkata!
If u r a romantic lover then this is the correct place for you to visit with your partner..
Food is above average..
Ambience is good..
Soft music is being played in the background..
There is a cover charge, most of the time, if u want to sit and enjoy the view of the 20th floor.
But if you are sitting inside then a-la-carte will be suffised..

Overall:
Ambience: 4.5
Food: 4
Crowd: 4
Service: 4
Pocket Pinch: 4.5

The best place to visit with you date in this city.
YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER PLACE THAN THIS!

Well to begin with the direction or the entrance to a 20th stored building is very confusing, secondly they will charge you 10% service charge up and above your bill.. now lets talk about the food.. very limited options to choose, quantity is horrible and to top it the taste.. simply yucks.. the last and most important part the charges n prices of dishes are god damn expensive.. total wastage of time n money.. no value for money.. its a big no from me for ozora.. i donot recommend it to anyone..

The feeling of being closest to the skies grasps you as soon as you walk in from the doors towards the sky lounge. The spectacular view and the lighting makes it a perfect hangout with friends and family. It has a live DJ and view of more than a 180° around the open terrace. The place is presently running on temp bar license for Friday to Sunday. So it's better to call first to check before planning a party. On other days the whole place is open of all as restaurant only. Serves both Indian and Continental and they offer limited but good dessert options. Food was average however hospitality was fantastic. Smiling and polite staff. A must go.. especially when weather is great and to sip wine while enjoying the view. ☺️

But I can't understand why they have charged 10% service charge.they have charged vat,swach varat tax and krisi kalyan tax; these are ok. But service charge??? I think we people are not bound to pay service charge. I think it's illegal. Story is not over yet...

Starting from service to the food,everything was brilliant. Loved the food. The Skybar was not available that day but the indoor was also really good.The service was fast.We had American Fried Reshmi,Biriyani,Chicken Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken and a Chicken Stake.The food was sufficient   for four of us,and it was delicious at the same time..That day,Hawaian Lava was not available,so we did not have dessert. Will surely go  again soon to try out the skybar.

This is by far the coolest skybar experience in Kolkata. 20 stories high on the rooftop of Acropolis mall with amazing music and great food and Beautiful view of Kolkata city. 
Very courteous staff !! 
Pricing is high but the view and rooftop experience makes it's all worth it. 

Only con is that if it rains, the skybar gets closed.. everyone gets shifted to the inside restaurant.

Nice environment and the banquets lead to the infinity pool complete with a wave machine which is a unique feature at Ozora.
It is the perfect area to host close get together which is one of its kind.Great panoramic view of the city.The staffs there were also very polite and caring. We went there without any prior booking, but still they arranged for places for us. The Service and Ambience bowled me over at Ozora. At 20 Floors Up in the sky, 
this is easily the tallest restaurant available in Kolkata presently, and it makes for amazing viewing.

The ambience was great and the view at the outdoor seating was to die for. I went with my friends. It was a perfect evening of food, music and the amazing ambience.. There was a Cover charge if you are sitting outside. We ordered a behari chicken tikka which was good like really good but the lamb chops were undercooked though the platting was good. The spaghetti had the perfect sauce and cooked perfectly.

Coming to the staff, they were really attentive, inquisitive and courteous. Loved the food 😍 We ordered 4 dishes.. all of which were cooked well. Though there can be some improvement in the quantity for the price. And some more variations in the cuisines as well. Other than that, it was a pleasant dinner overall.

Probably the highest rooftop restro in the city of joy; the overall interior and music and the view is just WOW😍 But when it comes to food qulity and variety it's really not worthy. When I visited the place the coffee machine was not working so that was quite unacceptable  and yes things are bit overpriced. But for the ambience it's worthy of three stars.☺

Being situated on the 20th floor, the best part about this place is the outdoor seatings. The view of the city from there is breathtaking. Best is during the evening or preferably during the night. Food is just average. We had jamaican jerk pizza, which was good, cosmopolitan was average, kiwi frappe which was ice based, again an average drink, reshmi kebab, average again, and some mustard based prawns, a decent dish. There is one server particularly who needs to learn how to behave specially with customers, others were pretty decent with servicing. So ya, the entire rating here was for the ambiance.

Saturday date night at ozora- got a table quickly as we reached early. Ordered a chicken Reshma kabab, chilli paneer pizza, a Bloody Mary and teen  pan shisha. With the first drag the shisha started choking and there was no flavour at all. Called the shisha guy and he did nothing but changed the pipe which hardly made any difference. Coming to food, Reshma kabab was delicious but the pizza was just average. Now the drink was not doing what it had to do ordered another Bloody Mary but still did not do what it was supposed to. They have a cover charge of 1000 per person and out total pocket pinch for all of the above was 3K. I would not recommend this place for alcoholic or shisha. For food and service, yes, may be.

Once at Ozora...

If you search for this fine dining at the main Acropolis Mall, you will probably be fooled... It is in the annex building of the main Mall... What drew me here was the lure to get a panoramic view of my City of Joy from the 20th floor and the temptation of some really sumptuous food. However the price for the former was a bit exorbitant... They are charging an extra 1K per person as coverage charge - for opting to enjoy the rooftop area of the restaurant.
Now coming to food - they offer chic tab menus that include fusion food in the name of theoretical jargons as post modern progressive cuisine or deconstructed dishes... The menu namer has definitely put in some of his intellect in setting up the menu just as the interior designer must have used his aesthetic sense.... The remaining role lies with the chef as to do justice to all these accompaniments ... We ordered chicken mozambiqui as starter, republic chicken and new age makhani for main course and Mishti D0i- Cheese Cake-Besan Laddu as dessert. The chef played safe. The dishes tasted fine. The names will set high expectations that the dishes fulfil only partly, but they nevertheless console and pacify and lull the tastebuds with a delicious flavour. The dessert definitely sto0d out with a stunt presentation where the assisting chef herself brought it, crumbled a rose and poured some liquid smoke to create a sound and fury within a gastronomic explosion! The overall experience was definitely fine, the place is recommendable.

Went to Ozora on a hit and muggy evening. Was blown away by the outdoor though it was fairly uncomfortable. Was very happy to find two familiar faces from Smoke Hose Deli, who made our visit very comfortable. Thanks a lot Surajit. The disappointment came at the drinks menu where most of the stuff was not available. Some of us ended up drinking Indian beer at an exorbitant price. Others had to be content with whatever cocktail that was available. Some of the food was decent but nothing outstanding. I will go back only if the menu is done justice to. Can't just bank on location and ambience to run a place.

Been there 4-5 times before. That time never charged cover price. But recently when we went for a get together with friends they charged 1000 per people as cover charges, which is ofcourse redeemable against food. But simply this system is useless. Since with 5 of us we might not order food for 5000. Also, their food is not that great and also costly according to the quantity. The good part is the atmosphere. But again spending 1000 bucks per person to feel the ambience is useless. I visited this place often. So now I have to rethink. May be my visit frequency will change due to this cover charge. Will look for some other options.

Also would request Zomato to change the approx cost section, since now it's 1000 for one.

Would surely not recommended this.

Too ordinary for the price. You get a tab as menu card . Its a roof top restaurant and you need to pay cover up bill of Rs 1000 for availing the roof top and not to mention the price is already very high for the food. The view of the skyline from the roof top is really good but its not worth visiting twice.

Correction: This place is now permitted to serve alcohol. As they have just recieved their lisences, hence the options on alcoholic beverages is very limited.
Godd food and service. But what stands out is the superb ambience and the view of Kolkata city from 20th floor along with the cool breeze even on a peak summer evening. The view is what will attract any person to this place. Try out this place, and do try out their roof top open air lounge. Visit this place in small groups or a big one, its great.

This restaurant is located in the 20th Floor of Acropolis Mall having both open air and closed roof top facility. Actually the entrance of this one is at the backside of Acropolis Mall and its different than that of the shopping mall. I think I have said the most significant and their USP and no further review is required if you want to have a view of Kolkata from the 20th Floor while hanging out with your friend/s. So until and unless you have visited at least once this much review should be sufficient for you to decide.

They have started serving Alcohol so they now have a Cover Charge of 1000/- bucks per individual entry which can be redeemed against your orders for that evening / night.

So once cover charges are paid, a beautiful (had to use that adjective) lady ushered us in. Obviously we opted for the open air section.

The open air section is dark and there is a separate section with sofas for club members. Otherwise there are long chairs at the edges and in the middle there are normal tables and chairs. 

The bar section is in the middle and the music was also good. Overall a good ambience (again view of Kolkata from 20th floor ;) )

Now coming to the food...we ordered mainly starters 

Jiaozi Chicken - Crispy chicken sliced pieces in black pepper sauce. This is was quite good in taste and if you like your dish spicy go for it.

Nam Prik Pla - This is a fish dish and very spicy (which is exactly what i wanted ). Roasted sliced fish in wild pepper sauce.

You get a wide range of drinks for your choice too..

Overall a very nice experience and looking forward to visit again.

Located on the 20th floor of Acropolis Mall, it definitely is one of the best rooftop places in Kolkata. The view is simply mindblowing. So is the food. The daab chingri was lip smacking delicious. The Chef recommended the in-house pasta which was again really delicious. And the dessert, the cigar shaped gajar ka halwa was out of this world. Would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place for sure

The view from the outdoor section was  just charismatic , But we were surprised by the cover charges that was taken,only when you book a table in outdoor section, which you can adjust with the bill but its non refundable at all ! They had limited stocks for drinks, due to their temporary license so we had to compromise a bit ,But the  Service was good.So overall it was a good experience .
*Cover Charge was Rs 1000 per person :(

Being new in this city I don't have much ideas about good restaurants. My friend took me to this place. Amazing ambience. You get to see kolkata from the top since its situated in the 20th floor, open air. The food is also nice and delicious. We had ordered pink pasta and a pizza. Both were cooked to perfection. The staff is also sincere and courteous. The only thing for which I took ur 0.5 rating is for the alcohol which is not being served. I hope you guys will sort it out soon.

Good Food

But the biggest surprise is service is not only slow but very very poor.

In two hours, he gave repeat order after 20 minutes and that too after  three reminders...This happened every time... Once he bought cold drink instead of water.... Ice was not there. What not in two hours.... The waiter was constantly talking to his colleague instead of concentrating on the job...

Lovely view , good food , though a little pricey. Ozora is the kind of place you go for the feel of it. The food is also good, but the interiors and the view will take your breath away. Places like this are much needed in kolkata so kudos to the team.

The downside is that they hadn't really started off in full flow so no music was playing . Hope they get through those issues soon. 

The biggest downside however is the parking. This is the reason I haven't rated this place as 5. When you are going to place as fancy as this , ur a lil dressed up and the women are further decked up; in this scenario its fairly maddening to find parking and the required lift and is quite capable of sparking a fight between u n ur better half. Also it's a fairly unimpressive entry to such a nice place.

Ps: stay open for lunch if possible, I'm sure you will find takers in that part of the city

At this place one would definitely feel to be At the Top of the World!!Situated on the 20th Floor of the Acropolis Mall this place has probably the best ambiance among all the rooftop cafes in the city. With our beloved City being visible for miles around and gleaming among those bright lights this place offers a spectacle to behold! Coming to the food, quality is excellent, specially the Daab Chingri which is absolutely fantastic.All the others items were also good enough. Pricing is very much reasonable taking into account the grandeur of the place. Overall a must visit place and a place the city can definitely be proud of!!

Ozora the rooftop lounge is an undertaking of the Merlin group, this group is associated with luxury and has targeted the elite class of the market. Owing to the parent companies policy, this place lives up to the glory. 
Presently alcohol is not served due to government regulations but soon they are hitting back with the sauve led bar. The interiors of this place is chique, classy while the skybar gives you a great view of the city of joy, killer combination. 
The food and beverage menu is very much adequate and simple, while the prices are pretty average for any upscale restaurant.
The cons would be 10% service charges with all other sort of taxes! I ordered a sheesha, gondho basil mojito which costed me a fortune. The mocktail served was Missing the fizz at first after the feedback they changed it and was delighted in the second attempt. 
Food I'm yet to try, so keeping the section reserved for future edits.
Service was great, helpful servers with good body language and a very pleasant host! As we went on a Friday night, expected a bit of crowd but it was almost vacant. I find this place beautiful and worthy of time, I would totally pay the cover charges for such a killing ambiance and view differing with the most of the reviews here on Zomato. 
Surely returning back, a suggestion would be keeping offers on food and beverage would help attracting more vibrant crowd!

Looking forward to visit again.

Ozora the rooftop lounge is an undertaking of the Merlin group, this group is associated with luxury and has targeted the elite class of the market. Owing to the parent companies policy, this place lives up to the glory. 
Presently alcohol is not served due to government regulations but soon they are hitting back with the sauve led bar. The interiors of this place is chique, classy while the skybar gives you a great view of the city of joy, killer combination. 
The food and beverage menu is very much adequate and simple, while the prices are pretty average for any upscale restaurant.
The cons would be 10% service charges with all other sort of taxes! I ordered a sheesha, gondho basil mojito which costed me a fortune. The mocktail served was Missing the fizz at first after the feedback they changed it and was delighted in the second attempt. 
Food I'm yet to try, so keeping the section reserved for future edits.
Service was great, helpful servers with good body language and a very pleasant host! As we went on a Friday night, expected a bit of crowd but it was almost vacant. I find this place beautiful and worthy of time, I would totally pay the cover charges for such a killing ambiance and view differing with the most of the reviews here on Zomato. 
Surely returning back, a suggestion would be keeping offers on food and beverage would help attracting more vibrant crowd!

Ozora one of those places which was in my wishlist for a long period of time. But my experience at this place was not how I thought it would be. 
First, lets talk about the good things. The beautiful decor, the roof top ambience, the out of the world view from the place.
Well, u must be thinking where is the food in the list, but the sad part is it was dissapointing.
I ordered a mocktail, a Chicken White Sauce Pasta and a Chicken Pizza.
I didnt like any of them, none of the above was according to the standard and was over prieced.
So if you wanna have a great time without considering food as your primary need you can try this place.
This place needs to improve on its quality of food to compete with several other food hubs in the town.

I agree with the fact that the view is indeed breathtaking and "breeze personified". The decor is eclectic with its ample ambient lighting. The place is ideal for a romantic evening out with your partner. A word to all the girlfriends, if visiting this place, then do tie your hair or hold down your short dress, for the breeze will surely give you an unsuspecting Marilyn Monroe experience!!  However, I must add, even though Ozora doesn't serve alcohol (not yet), it is expensive!! We weren't informed about the cover charges for outdoor seating. We ordered for one shisha, three mocktails and four food items which included two chicken varieties and two fish varieties. It was nothing exceptional in terms of taste and presentation. Our bill came to a whooping 6 grand + taxes which is definitely costly when compared to the likes of What's Up Cafe (Southern Avenue), Smoke Shack (Hindustan Park), Afraa (City Centre) and Over The Top (Park Street). Over all it was a feel good experience. The staff were cordial and pleasant to interact with. A request to team Ozora, please append the price of each item on your menu bar. It will help in giving us a rough cost estimate before venturing your joint. I rate it a "4" solely for the feel good factor I have experienced.

The most unfriendly staff I've ever come across and I've come across many an unfriendly batch. They treat guests as intruders and take pride in making it evident that they don't care about guests. They won't keep a table reserved even if you call way in advance so do visit at the risk of wasting your evening.

This place will entice u more with the view it offers than the food it serves. The food is nice n different but nothin I would like to go back there for. Rather I would love to go back to get another birds view of Kolkata from there...n it's truly amazing! 
Since this place doesn't serve alcohol yet I think it should atleast increase the variety of its mocktails. The day we went, we had only three options to choose from. 
Overall a must-go for anybody who wants to enjoy some nice food with an amazing view of the city!

The roof top area is amazing. You can see beautiful Kolkata from 20th floor and the view is too good with cool breeze. For this ambience i can give 5/5. But when it comes to food it is not up to that mark. Starter was good but i personally didn't like the main course. But if you want to feel that you are on the top of Kolkata then this is the best place ever. Go and enjoy the roof top ambience.

So I was there yesterday and yes it's a magical place for all the view from that 20th floor. The city looks absolutely stunning from the place.  So for the atmosphere it's 5/5 from me.  
The issue for me would be that the hookah is served only in the open space which actually is meaningless to me and thus I did not order one. Hookah should be started even inside.  The items that I had there were all OK for me nothing great about it.  
Recommended for a a off visit that's it and more for all the couples out there, it makes more sense for couples to explore this place.

I tried this place on 29.04.2017 the food was served raw i had orderd grilled chicken with veggies, the vegetables were served raw and the quantity of chicken was poor 4 lil tiny pieces, The quantity is not even  enough for a single person , Though its quite expensive but m not complaining about the pricing here but atleast provide enough quantity And Serve COOKED FOOD NOT RAW! Pathetic experience in terms of food and drinks. Otherwise the ambience is good but ultimately we go there to eat FOOD not AIR!
NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!

Ozora is an amazing place when u a looking for a view. Located on the 20th floor of Acropolis mall, you can see the dazzling skyline in front of you which in an experience in itself. But that is all there is. As an resturant it is average, the food is ordinary but on the expensive side which is expected given the view they are offering. We ordered chicken Mozambique which are basically nuggets u get in the markets. Chilli that got fired which is fancy name for stuffed chilli pakora was better. We tried a couple of varieties of burgers which were also fine,nothing worth remembering. The bigggest shock was the sheesha which is not mentioned in the menu but suggested by the servers. We ordered the vanilla flavoured one and it cost us 800 bucks !!! way pricier than any food items. And no, they dont serve liquor. If i ever revisit the place it will be only for the view.

The place has a great view and ends about there. Food is grossly overpriced, I ordered a pulled pork burger which a) did not have pulled pork, just pork pieces b) tasted like sour pickles on cabbage c) came with dry, tasteless fries and d) cost an arm and both legs. There was no alcohol, the mocktails very average. We also ordered a lamb risotto which basically came as three measly frozen lamb balls quickly flash fried and dumped in risotto so salty that we couldn't finish it even though it cost 550 bucks. There is also gaudy blinking lights - the place is aspirational and supremely overrated.

A restaurant which literally makes you feel on top of the world. Excellent ambiance, cordial behavior of the staffs and you can see Kolkata all at a glance. But the main turn off is that the open area of the restaurant is not lighted properly. You can not see what actually you are eating. If the place is visited during the falling dusk with your partner you can have some real romantic moment.

Our menu for the day was Mushroom Chai soup, Behari Murgh Chandi Tikka, Murgh Khusk Purdah and Nan-e-Bukhara. Regarding the food I would like to say there are many other places in Kolkata to savour your taste buds. Behari Murgh Chandi Tikka was filled with cheese and mayonnaise which I didn't enjoy at all.

Zomato allowed me to find this exquisite place on the 20th floor of Acropolis mall. The experience was wonderful, more than the food its the ambience that gives this place its meaning. I went there yesterday and it was such a mid week stress buster. The amazing lighting, all sides open seating area and the superb view lifts up the mood instantly! The food is bit over priced but all in all the place is beautiful & impressive.

The points are only and solely for the roof top view and ambiance. Since they are not serving alcohol, they should make efforts to escalate their mocktail menu. They had only 2 mocktails to offer. Sheesha was not bad.  Will visit agin after and if they start serving alcohol and review again.

Ozora is one of it's kind sky lounge in the main building of Acropolis next to Siemens office and Gitanjali Statium in Kasba. 

Ambience:
The outdoor ambience is what this place is and will be known for. Atop the 21st floor one can see the skyline of Kolkata. They have a indoor seating and a big outdoor seating. There is a touch of luxury throughout the establishment. This is where all the score comes from. There is a general liking to sit in the open air among their customers and so the queue to occupy a seat in the outdoor area can be quite long at times. The menu is accessed through a Tablet device. Otherwise the waiters will have to bring a torch along with a paper menu card because the lights are dimmed. The music is good and much to my personal liking did not have to face the Bollywood and Punjabi masalas. In Kolkata the ambience is unique and that gives the administration the courage to charge a cover. Here USP comes at a price. The indoor ambience will have lot of competition even in Kolkata.

Food and Beverages:
The quality of the food is bad to be short. There is nothing special no matter what is your pick in the Tablet menu card. I personally would not go to Ozora for food until they have improved significantly. Most of the drinks I picked were not in their menu.

Price:
The price is high. Also, they will recover a cover charge of Rs 1000.00 per person. This charge is redeemable against the final bill but not refundable. So in order to cover up one might have to indulge in a bit more of drinks or much on the oh-so-poor food. This is a major put off. However, the pricing is such that one need not stress much. The price is as high as the roof is. This cover charge serves a couple of purpose. 1) Ensure that the chef continues to learn cooking and still be billed 2) A minimum billing is ensured to enjoy the ambience.

Service charge:
There is a reception desk where you will be greeted on arrival. You will be made to cough up Rs 1000.00 per person cover charge here. Also they will inform you that you will be charged 10% Service Charge (on the overall invoice amount). You must agree if you want to get in. After that please do not expect a 5 star hospitality. It will still remain our good ol' Oly types.

Overall:
The outdoor ambience is such that it is worth a visit or two. But if in such an ambience a large chaotic group is around then all the money goes down the 21 floors and then the gutters. The food quality, menu spread, price, cover charges, service charges  weighs heavily on the other side so that I will not be a loyalist. But for a special occasion Ozora will definitely be a place I would strongly consider if I get a good seat in the outdoor on a nice weather.

Ozora... Top of the town.. well this is surely a place to visit... Mainly bcoz of the feeling that u r at the TOP.. whole Kolkata looks so beautiful.. cool breeze soothing ambience..
.
Service is good.. management people are very humble.. n concious about the reputation which is very impressive..
.
Food is I would say not bad... But yes the special gesture which Mohona one of the management people showed and things which she suggested really helped us to rate food quotient high... We ordered some sea food salad which was not good then taking mohona's suggestion we ordered Scissor Salad.. which was AWESOME...
.
It was my fiancee birthday that day n wanted to make it special for him which eventually happened... Thanks to OZORA.. a complete place to enjoy ur special day..

Located on the 25th floor, ambience is perfect for any occasion. A roof top place with all arrangements of music, booze, ambience and FOOD I must say its just wow. We ordered Biryani and it is worth the money.
Though the prices are on little high but it worth the ambience.

The ambience of Ozora is simply amazing. It has two seating arrangements. One indoors and one outdoors. The view of the city from the rooftop is mesmerizing.  The staff are courteous and extremely polite. The food simply makes you want to eat more and more. The names of the food are such that one is easily interested and curious as to what shall be served unto him. The food needless to say is extremely delicious. The concept of a skybar is something that makes Ozora unique. It is a lovely place not only to enjoy a yummy meal with your family and friends, but also provides an opportunity to enjoy a few precious moments with your loved ones. A visit to Ozora is definitely recommend.

Situated on the 20th floor, the place is beautifully decorated and the wonderful weather made it an amazing experience when I visited this Sunday. It was very crowded and the open area was full, so we opted to stand for sometime at the bar counter rather than waiting at the reception desk. The staff was courteous and helped us a lot in getting a table,  albeit with two chairs for the three of us, but soon they made arrangements for a third chair. We had ordered a Chicken Kasha Pizza, which was good and a Fish tandoori kebab (don't remember the exact name as it was complicated) which was very tasty. There was some confusion over the order as the waiter somehow heard we had ordered a veg pizza and it led to a small exchange of words. But to their credit, the issue was promptly handled by the lady in charge and we were even offered a complimentary mocktail, which is supposed to be their speciality. It was a mix of mango and strawberry and was really good. The evening got better when they offered us one of the empty sofa seats, which otherwise is reserved for club members. 

The overall experience was very good. Would definitely recommend a visit with family or your special one. And yeah, given the location and ambience,  it's not that expensive either. :)

The high rating is because of the location, ambience, electrifying atmosphere and decor. This pub is located on the 20th floor. The view is amazing. The decor is elegant. The staff is courteous. I would recommend everyone to sit outdoors and enjoy the food with a beautiful weather.  We ordered Korean lotus stems which was amazing. It had the right amount of crispiness and spice. The tandoori aloo was ordinary, nothing great. We ordered a dish called "crossing the spinach line" which was extremely flavourful and its a must try. Spring onion rice was also good. Steak or no steak is a dish which contains vegetable balls with sphagetti. The vegetable balls were tasteless but the sphagetti was nice. Fresh lime soda was referring. You can try the soups they have. 💕 Looking forward for another visit.

Ozoro has two dining areas- indoors and outdoors. The decor in both areas is  eye pleasing and very romantic. We chose to sit outside. Being on the 20th floor, it's very windy, which is very enjoyable till the food arrives. All the light elements of the dish started flying. Also though they had well laid tables indoors the same was lacking outdoors. Even if dining on the terrace is ment to be casual, for the same prices I expect a proper laid table. The waiters were polite and trying their best to serve us but their lack of experience was apparent. They served us the mains along with the starters. 
Coming to the food, we had the mushroom chai and the republic of ginseng for soup. Both were sensational, especially the mushroom chai. A must have. For the starters we tried the Korean lotus stems and the tandoori aaloo. The Korean lotus stems were good but the tandoori aaloo was nothing special. For the mains we had the "Crossing the spinach line" which is am excellent dish and a must have. We had a 9 vegetable in a gravy and butter and spring onion rice. This dish was a nice dish. And lastly we had the "steak or no steak" which was vegetables balls on a bed of aglio alio spaghetti. The balls lacked flavour and one can totally give this dish a miss. 
Lastly, my suggestion would be to take starters outside and enjoy the ambience and take rest of the courses inside to enjoy the food. Also, it will be convenient for the ladies to tie their hair up.

Amazing place with an even more amazing view of the city below from 20th Floor. We visited on a Friday evening & it was quite windy. The ladies were having a difficult time with their hair. We were not charged any cover charges as was mentioned in the other reviews on this forum. We went click click with our mobile cameras. No drinks are served yet as they have not received their bar license - so we were told. We tried mocktails like Mango Mist, Kiwi Crush & Nutty Apple. As starters we took Wok Tossed Pepper Chicken & Jiaozi Chicken. Taste of food was good but not awesome. However the USP of Ozora is their place & customer care. The ladies at the entrance were very courteous & guided us to our desired seating zone explaining the things. Had a gala time. Will repeat for sure....

This restaurant has great roof top ambiance . To enjoy the roof top, one needs to pay 1000 bucks per head which is non refundable but reimbursable. That means if three people visit and decide to sit outside then minimum they have to cough off is 3000+taxes. But then , the price of the food item here is such that you will surely end up ordering food/drink that adds up to this amount. Service is good . Coming to food , there is not much variety and taste is also just average. There is some food items that were listed on menu but were not available. One can visit this place to enjoy the city view with drinks and cool breeze ( kolkata's weather permitting).

This new place on the block is amazing...mainly for the view of the Kolkata skyline...
The rooftop setting makes it perfect for a romantic evening watching the sun set

There are a few pointers if u wana visit this place
1)It doesn't have liquor license so do with the mocktails.
2)The staff claimed that as they wrre not serving alcohol no cover charges are required.So just pay a la carte.
3)I visited this place in the "Board exam season" so no music was as allowed outdoors.That was a shame considering the ambiance.
4)The food is nice and reasonably priced.I especially likes the starter Naan Sense...it was yummm..mocktails are good too
5)The deserts were a huge let down...there were limited choices of only 5 6 items on the menu out of which 3 were not available...I would really want them to work on that section cause u do remember a place if u leave content and happy..and deserts make u feel that way


Overall a nice place..worth a visit for sure😊

Ok, so last I went here after a friend of mine recommened it. I was blown away(quite literally!!) by the rooftop deck & the 360° view of of kolkata that comes with it. Once you step into the deck there are hardly any words that describes the feeling!! Lovely atmosphere no doubt but the food is quite overpriced. But nontheless a place i recommend.

A place to visit to feel the breeze and the view of city kolkata. Situated on the 20th floor of acropolis presents a glorious panorama of the city.. The food is too good and we were taken care by staff moloy who was too benevolent as he provided me a complimentary desert at the end.. As a whole if u want to spend great time with ur loved ones in a soothing environment visit this place.

Heard a lot about it and finally  we were there in 20th floor of Acropolis building.One cannot of course reach the place from inside the mall.There is a side entry to the building .
We were only interested in the sky deck and the lady at the reception informed that they are not serving alcohol due to license issues.Well that's a big turn off as  Zomato clearly mentions that "serves alcohol",so this fact needs to be updated.

Well coming to the ambiance its one of a kind with a open skyline of the city and low light arrangements its just perfect.
But the same cannot be said about the food.The food served is pathetic and over priced.

I will only go back for the ambiance .

P.S. :two non veg starters and 4 glasses of lime soda costs 1700/-

Loved the view from the top..Apt place for a romantic dinner or date, if it's the place only that matters. The food we ordered on the other hand was below average. To be precise everything we ordered was extremely salty, even our fresh lime sodas. To be honest when we complained about it we were offered a complimentary dessert as compensation . But the salty food had really disturbed our tastebuds . I am rating this place only for the awesome view and ambience. Oh yes this place is extremely expensive but a good place of you are an ambience loving person only.

The only positive thing about this place is the location and ambience. You get a spectacular view of the city from the top of 21 floors. The breeze is awesome and the DJ is a delight. Next, the drinks menu is decent, though the waiters are often clueless as to the contents of the menu. Food is barely average. I would go ahead and recommend the Kolkata on the run and de-constructed daab chingri. But the Pizzas are a strict no. There is a cosy and well done members' area...but unfortunately they are not accessible to non-members despite a cover charge. And they take their coupons a bit too seriously. You can land up in trouble if you lose the chit. They are too reluctant to adjust the cover charge with the final bill if you lose the chits. And ridiculous it might sound, neither the money receipt, nor the coupon numbers help. So count your coupons meticulously if you don't want to lose your money or waste your time reasoning with the manager.

So, finally visited the place. The place was in buzz these months. Amazing ambience. The view of Calcutta was brilliant. The décor and service is also very good. Coming to food, starters are below average. No doubt main course is very good. But the price of breads (nan, kulcha, etc) being Rs. 240 per piece is not worthy. How can the price of curry, tandoor and breads be equal? Too costly.
Keeping its expensiveness aside, overall it was a place to be visited. If price is not a factor, only then you should visit the place.

The ambience is amazing, but food was a total disappointment. The quality & taste is not upto the mark. To top it off when we walked into the restaurant we were immediately served a welcome menu which we thought was complimentary, but when we checked the bill we found that we were actually billed for it. Hence we landed by paying for something which we didnt order for.
We would not visit the place again coz value for money is not there.

The view is just spectacular, specially after sunset. Add to it a breezy weather and that just makes it perfect for a quiet deep conversation with someone. Only thing lacking was soulful music, which on being asked was told that due to exam time they didn't have license to play. Food-
Babycorn- Very ordinary and the helping was really small. 
Nan-sense - Naan chopped in circles, topped with cheese and paneer. Really liked it, was something different. 
The service is really good, just that too many waiters kept on asking every once in a while if we liked the food and if we needed something else. Would like to enjoy a private conversation without being interrupted every 5 minutes on my next visit.

By far the best Al- Fresco bar in the city simply because it's 20 stories high, where the wind  blows a gayle all evening. Food and mocktails are pretty decent. This place should become one of the most premium niche party places in the city soon, provided the service remains consistent.

Ozora has been the talk of town since last few months. Going by the USPs I decided to visit the place to dine in on my birthday.
Initially it was bit difficult to find out this place. Very few ppl could give us the info to reach there.
Anyhow the place was a dazzling display of beautiful decor lights. That's for the indoor seating area.
We wanted to get the rooftop view hence we preferred the outdoor seating area.
It was definitely charming BUT the place was too dark to savour one's platter.
The service manager was very attentive and she made sure that each of the customers were attended :)
Liked it!
Service was prompt too.
The concept of menu tab was interesting!
Well, coming to the food I would say it was quite good. Nothing extraordinary of course!
Warm sesame crusted chicken salad was something that I didn't like.
But the main course was brilliant. Fish tossed in nam prika sauce along with spicy pepper flavoured rice made our tummy happy happy. The quality and quantity was too good!
This dish is highly recommended 👍
The place would have been more soothing if made brighter with lights and accompanied with some music :)
Overall had a nice experience!

Sad part is that they still dont serve alcohol. Yet to come. 
If there with a special person then one would really enjoy the charm out there. But way to reach from the mall is bit confusing.

I felt to reach the cafe is a lil difficult because it feels like a real puzzle to enter and exit from it i mean there should be more sign boards for the directions in the mall.
The food and drinks (mocktails) felt a lil less on the quantity wise...
There was no issue on the quality but still for the pricing what they offer it feels scanty..
This was our groups thought!
Because 750 for 3 Mocktails 
And just a starter for 600 seemed very much overpriced to me!
But loved the location and ambience of the place!
And the service was also good

Located on the 21st floor of the Acropolis Mall at Kasba.

This is perhaps one of the most well decorated and classy places you can visit in Kolkata.

A brilliant view from the top, some awesome sofas, chairs and tables set out on the terrace as well as inside to add to the charm of the place. Awesome lights, good flooring, an uber romantic terrace and this is all good I can speak about this restaurant.

If you wanna sit outside on the terrace, there is a concept of cover charge or security deposit which makes no sense as other restaurants don't have this rule. I had ordered a fresh lime soda which was just about Okay and my friends recommended me for a prawn dish which I donot know why they did recommend, a bland dish with no taste and no good quantity as well.

A very expensive place and it does not justify that either.

Visit this place only if you want a good view of the entire city and a great ambiance becuase thats all you can ever get here!

Now seriously, Zomato should come up with some negative rating system. I am generally not too critical but places like Ozora need some serious bashing.

It was a Sunday evening. They ask for cover charges which is absolutely fine. Once we entered the rooftop we found many couches were unoccupied but we weren't allowed to sit there as those were "reserved for members only". We had to stand next to the bar counter. When we requested the staff to let us sit on the unoccupied couches and promised to leave once/if the members arrive, they refused. When we asked them to arrange a table for 4, they asked us to help ourselves!!! Finally after 20 minutes, we managed to get a table for 4 and the dishes and plates were still not removed. We requested a number of waiters to clean the table but nobody paid attention. They just refused to attend and at times just nodded and then left. We waited for 30 minutes, yes, that's right...even after 30 minutes, the table was unattended and nobody came to take the order. We left the place and checked in to Asia Kitchen.

Now, the thing that should be noted. We were there for about 55 minutes. And guess what, all the couches reserved for members were still lying empty when we were leaving!

Absolutely not recommended. Waste of money and time. Management and Service? Total disaster.

A very bad experience on the night of 5th March 2017 (Sunday) at 11.30 pm.
Me my wife and my cousin had gone there to spend some good quality time, but I guess it was wastage of time and money both.
The service and the staff both was very bad and too top it all the MANAGER some Mr.Orgo. was drunk and was dancing and I guess he was not in his senses because he  did not know what he was saying.
Really a very bad experience.
I don't think visiting that place again is worth for me.

Our night out was marred by the unreasonable staff at Ozora. There were six of us and we were issued coupons on entry against a cover charge of ₹6000 (₹1000/head). We didn't notice then that we were given five coupons instead of six. Later while settling bill, they asked for ₹1000 more, for the missing coupon. We explained that we have already paid ₹6000 and there is no way we are going to pay ₹1000 extra for a missing piece of paper. The staff refused to see logic and were being unreasonable. They wanted us to pay ₹1000 extra! We had a pointless argument for an hour. At last we had enough and were contemplating calling the police or our advocate friend, for being harassed over a petty reason. Finally they agreed with us and we left. Our night was well ruined by then.

It is otherwise a happening place with good atmosphere. At the 20th floor terrace the strong wind hits you hard and the music is groovy and  the lights are scintillating. The food is not much to write about. The daab chingri was okay. Potato wedges weren't upto the mark while the pizza was a disappointment - with an overdose of salt in the lamb and no oregano, chili flakes or olive oil on the side until we asked for the same. Another fish item we ordered turned out to be good though.

First of all, Ozora should have a tag line to go with their name ---> and thats got to be "ONLY FOR MEMBERS". 
Visited Ozora for the first time on a Sunday evening to have a good time with friends but it turned out to be our biggest mistake. 
This place is pathetic when it comes to customer service. If you're not a member, you'll be treated like someone who has gone for free food and drinks. 
75 percent of their seats are already reserved for their MEMBERS and then they even have the audacity to give you a place to sit with a condition that you'll have to vacate the table as soon as their members arrive. 
Horrible hookah and even worse is the staff behaviour. We called them in 5 times to check on the hookah but they were least bothered to even listen to us. 
When we finally got frustrated enough to decide to leave the place, the manager ( or whoever he was ) cared a little to try to cater to us but the damage had already been done. 
Finally for all the people who plan to go to this place, a small suggestion - Make sure you are a member !

Finally my wife and I tried out the much talked about first sky bar of Kolkata...Ozora. As already expected, the view from the 20h floor was breathtaking. However, we couldn't get a table at the sky bar and had to go with the regular dinning option. It being na Saturday night, no tables were available in the open area, though we had the option to stand and dine (without a table though). We had ordered Republic of Chicken and Gremolata Crusted Spring Lamb Chops. The food tasted great, and the quantity wasn't something that one would mind. Not sure why the rating is 3.5 on Zomato. The place surely deserves a 4.5 at least. Loved the overall experience. Plan to visit the place soon, but on a weeknight so that we can get a table at the sky bar. Cheers!!

Their motto in life to organise private parties. If you are invited for a partt, certainly you will have a good time. But don't even think of spending your special day at Ozora, because

1. They always have a private booking at the terrace

2. If there's no private booking then their owner's friend is partying there anyway and you can't join them
@
3. They don't take reservations (may be they do selectively, never taken mine)

4. They don't serve alcohol on Mondays and Thursdays (very Sanskari)

So think more than twice before you go there and return disheartened

Rooftop lounge is something Kolkata deserved. And Oita stepped up. Located on the 20th floor of the building next to Acropolis Mall, the experience starts right from the moment you step out of the elevator. The decor is magnificent right from this place. They have indoor seating as well but who will like to sit in when they can sit out and see their city as the sun sets in and the illuminations hit the city. A different experience. Tables have candles that are lighted once the dark sets in. The music is well picked . The service is also good. Food quantity is average but taste wise it's good. It scores mainly due to its location and ambience. We ordered Chicken Mozambique and it was just the way we had imagined. The bar menu is also good but the only thing is they do not serve booze on Mondays and Thursdays so check the day before you hit ozora.

A couple dressed in Casuals look at each other as the elevator bell dings at the 20th floor. They enter the reception area holding hands and asks for a table in the outdoor area.

The reception lady : As per our club policy we are charging 10% service charge on the food bill.

The foodie : (wtf) but ma'am, that should at my discretion right. Whtever, please take us to our table.

As the trio walk past the beautiful and posh decorated @wooden Interiors, the music was filling up their senses. The passageway led them to the most exotic rooftop in town.

The foodie :(wtf) this is awesome, insanely cool. This has gotta be a 5* rating. Forget bout the service charge. I m already super duper excited.

The digital menu card was so well thought of that the couple took a good 15 mins to decide on the choices. In a matter of 10 mins the Asian green lamb burger, the Khameeri roti and the dumbukth daal were served.

The foodie :(wtf) I really wanted to give this place a 5*. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes. Maybe Indian and burgers are not their specialty. Maybe continental next time....... Maybe.......

Although the ambiance was great.
But it is very expensive and the quality of the food and service was not so good.
We visited on 19/02/2017 around 9 pm, we have to wait for more than 30 minutes after we ordered the food.
Even for a glass of water I have to approach the waiter twice and even after that We have to wait for another 5-10 Minutes.
The service was very poor.
The billing was done wrong.
I was provided with a Bill of another visitor.
On top of that the service people never apologized for the inconvenience.
More over it was not a good experience.
Need to improve the service a lot.

Ozora, for me, is definitely a must visit, at least once. A spectacular view, with wind blowing in your face and the sunset giving you company will leave you astounded. I can go on and on about the beauty of this restaurant because it IS actually something like that. Coming to the food, we ordered Jamaican Jerk, the Behari Murg Chandi Tikka, and the Murg Khushk Purdah with Naan. The food was tasty and spicy. If you're not a fan of too spicy food, I'll suggest to miss the Jamaican Jerk. The staff were very helpful and polite. Overall, we left the place contented and happy, but that's mostly because of the view.

The only skylounge in Kolkata, and what a place to be. Ozora is on the 20th floor of Acropolis mall and it is simply outstanding. Ambience is perfect and so is the view from the top. The skydeck is the place you would want to be whatever occasion it be. 
The black marble floor to the lights on the ceiling and obviously the view outside <3
Coming to the food, I had ordered north indian food which was not as great as compared to the ambience but good. Dal makhni tart was good which to me was a new thing on the cards and worth a try. 
Overall a great experience and many more visits to follow for sure.

A place that has around 500 love birds shimmying away to great music on Valentines' day is definitely a great place to be. My pick to celebrate this day was Ozora and I couldn't have thought of a better destination. I have been to a number of sky bars in Mumbai and Bangkok and Kolkata is privileged to have a place that makes you feel on 'top' of the world literally! Located on the 20th floor at the adjacent building of Acropolis, Ozora is a great place to hang out with family, friends or spend a romantic evening with your partner. We experienced some great music , the food-ordered the  Paneer rubaiyat sumheri, Behari murg tikka and Kasha Chicken pizza. A day with too many guests, the food was served hot and quick. It also tasted great! The bar is to look out for and nothing beats the view! Looking forward to going there for seeing the sunset. Special mention of the seasoned manager Sourav and his team for being the real pillars to this place. Kolkata enjoy your skyline with your martini right here, right now!

Came here for the 2nd time this Valentine's, hoping to change my view about the first experience. But but but, The hospitality is worse. They had a valet service too, Great, but when you have stopped accepting guests. You should inform them at the valet itself. Then bringing them up and send them back again. On asking about this downstairs, the person downstairs on the walky asks the person upstairs, who replies, "we are not accepting guests, but let people come up". Why? Just to charge them a mearge sum of 130 rs. Bring some Class to the place, please.

" OZORA "
-----------------
Not a place which kolkata needs but a place kolkata actually deserves.

A beautiful evening beckons when I entered the spectacular place Ozora, the sunset at 6 p.m followed by illuminated view of Kolkata's yellow lights.
An experience so ethereal that is difficult to express.
Everything is so chic and yet so casual.
The Ambience is their plus point with some fantastic music playing in the background.

Ozora has two different dining areas the fine dine area's interior is too posh, the black flooring with the wooden impression walls gives the perfect variation of class and style but I choose the rooftop sky deck area.
As rooftop is always my preferred area for relaxing.
The first glance of the sky lounge was WOW ,the place screams of luxury the arial view of the city from the 20th floor of acropolise mall is the best you can have.
The sky lounge can accommodate 400 people.
Feeling the wind and enjoying the skyline was the favourite part of that perfect evening.

Coming to the food -The food was was amazing the presentation was particularly outstanding. Though its an underrated places in Zomato ( I don't know why ) but I would obviously recommend people to check out this amazing sky lounge or else it'll be a loss as its the best I've seen so far in kolkata.

Good luck to the management of Ozora for doing a such a fantastic job haven't found any of their service lack.

PS- " the ultimate sky bar in town " I had a gala time.. Cheers 🍻

Had one of the worst experiences. Tried visiting this place thrice. On the first day they were having a private party on the deck, on the second day they were not serving alcohol and on the third day I called before hand and the lady at the reception told me that they were not taking reservations which is fine as it was a Saturday but also added that 'reservations were only for owners and their family' however we went in the evening, half of the deck was hosting a private party and while we were paying the cover charge and entering we were informed that there was no place to sit and we would have to stand by the bar. Well ozora is not that big a place or that big a sensation that I will spend a Saturday evening standing by the bar!!! Basically what I realised from the Behavior of the staff and the rest is that until and unless your surname is an 'Agarwal' or a 'Mohta' so as the owners the treatment would be really horrible and one will probably never be respected there! I personally would never recommend this place to anyone!

As i entered the elevator alone and pressed the button to the 20th floor, a certain Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey popped in my head, er, thanks to the latest Fifty Shades Darker trailer. I quipped to myself as I had no one special to share that evening with on this gorgeous deck! Yet as I walked towards the Skydeck, my level of anticipation grew with every step. strong gust of wind welcomed my tresses and I stood for a moment in awe at the sunset. The sky was pink and the moon had surfaced on the other side, waiting in the shadows for its turn to take over. The Calcutta skyline (yes, Kasba surprised me!) looked breathtaking despite the partial cover of smog. They charge 1000 each as cover charge which is fully redeemable. Don't know bout food as i was not hungry but if u talk bout drinks , they need to improve there cocktail's taste, blend and proportions a bit. Ordered for martini , screwdriver ,and bloody merry which was not as good as I expected. But i was there not for food or drinks honestly was there for the view . That bloody suppose to be more spicy rather then sweet. But next time i will visit this place for food , for sure. Am giving stars as per ambiance and staff .

The ambiance is definitely the USP of this restaurant. Atop Acropolis mall which is the highest building by a long shot in the immediate vicinity, this restaurant is amazing if you want a rooftop experience. The food is not outstanding, but pretty good. They have some innovative dishes as well and lots of choices in their menu. The service of the waiters still has room for improvement, but their behaviour is excellent. Knowing Kolkata's weather, this place is best visited in the evening. 

And they gave us a complimentary dessert. Brownie points for that!

Let me start with ambiance ..astonishing, astounding, surprising, bewildering, stupefying, perplexing these words are very less of what i actually mean to say nd i bet this is the only place of its class in Kolkata ... Now bout food yes i enjoyed that as well paneer tikka was super awesome thank you SUVENJIT for being such a good guide through out the night ..... to b very true dis is what i was looking for in Kolkata such a grt partying place ...... Service was good equally i found all the staffs helpful ...... Yes! now comes the real part ... i know it takes time to establish, for a new nd huge place like ozora to be fully functional that's fine with us till the time you r making our party awesome ..... As i said earlier in my every reviews taste, flavour, choices are such things which is bound to differ from one person to another ... so please try this place nd share ur experience with everybody

We arrived at 9:30PM on the Friday evening and there were no deck seats available. However, Mr Saurav, really went out of his way to put together a couple of bar stools and a table. This five star goes out to him.

As far as the food goes, the quality and quantity were good. The taste was not out of the world but it leaves you content. The LIIT was well made with just the right mix of alcohol!

As far as negatives go - it's pricey (but you should expect that) and it's chilly due to the breeze (the food gets cold within minutes)!

Overall - definitely a good place to visit! A must visit!

They can't serve naan without butter you have to take as in the menu that's the most absurd thing I have ever heard. Can only serve naan and tandoori they can't serve a kulcha even if a five year old kid is asking for it. Only thing is the deck's ambience . But no one can take the crassness they have.

Fantastic as the view might be, the staff clearly does not respect the guests. After charging a cover of 3000 and letting us in they don't give us a place to sit even though there were 5 tables that were not occupied and without any sign that they were occupied. One goes to an expensive place like ozora for the experience which they are clearly incapable of providing.

I visited this place last week after a tiresome day at office.Ozora is located in the 20th floor in Acropolis mall. U can have a view of the city of joy from 20th floor which is just amazing.The ambience and the music is just the perfect thing after a hectic day.The service of the staff were very prompt but food is not that great.I would have rated this place a perfect 5 but due to the food quality I rated this 4.5. It's a newly opened and one of the best rooftop restaurant/bar in Kolkata.There a cover charge which is again fully redeemable . Although food is a bit overpriced,it's a must visit for the ambiance and for the view that it offers of Kolkata.

There are major areas that will need improvement, like clear policies on entry charges (cover of 1000 per person on all days except Mondays and Thursdays because they get currently have provisional liquor licence that has to be renewed daily), seating allowances in certain parts of the establishment and general customer care aspects that create first impressions.  The ambiance is obviously unique and it will only get more dramatic as more construction projects litter the EM bypass region.  The food is good and innovative.  All the three times I went there the food was good.  Service was prompt on the part of the servers, bartenders and chefs; unfortunately, like in almost all restaurants in Kolkata, service staff did not have a working knowledge of the products they were selling.  That's essential, along with courtesy rather than pretense from front-of-the-house staff.  This is my neighborhood's newest addition; I want it to do well.  So while it's alright to have a certain snobbery about being the coolest place in Kolkata, humility and being friendly will take your business further.  Most importantly, both the daal makhani tarts and the meatball tarts are pretty good (have it with the salad); the jerk chicken pizza is pretty good and so is their thin crust; quesadillas were great and so were the kabobs.  And Margaritas ALWAYS have salt rims, whether flavored or not!  Finally, I'd recommend the general manager to engage with patrons to see how the establishment is doing.  Your place has great potential; make the best of it.

The only 20th Storied Sky Bar of Kolkata. Lovely ambience and classic view. A must visit in the winters. Was confused about visiting this place because of the low rating on Zomato. But the place is very good, food is good too. Music was very good. Though drinks are pricey. A must visit. Pizza, paneer tikka, crispy lotus stem, quesadilla. Surely this place can't be done in 2000 with drinks for 2 people. 1000 rupees is the cover charge per person. The private party section with a pool is awesome.

It's a must place to visit. The ambience is pretty good because of its lighting and music. Place is big enough with a separate area to give parties. Food was of good quality with generous staff.
Beer and cheese soup is a must try. Even the white sauce penne pasta was deliciously creamy. 
Doesn't have much of mocktails yet. If people don't wanna have hard drinks, it hardly has many options. It might be difficult to find the entrance at once but being on the 20th floor, gives an amazing view and breeze.

Had been there on Saturday with family. The ambience is very good especially the open environment. This place is meant to enjoy the open area whereas the dining area is OK as other fine dining restaurants. The service is not good. The drinks were good but on the expensive sides. For starters we ordered paneer tikka, dal makhani tarts and corn kernels. The tikka was not at all good but the tarts were good. For the main course we tried dal makhani , mixed vegetables and variety of Indian breads , Thai rice with green curry etc. The Thai was good but Indian was just OK.  Liked the place but only if u enjoy the outside area otherwise just OK.

With really quirky presentations they made so many small and beautiful moments to make the day so very special..they made a heart shaped pizza with happy anniversary written with tomatoes..then there was rose flavored gulab jamun cheesecake with beautiful decorations with anniversary message on it..even desserts were designed creatively with happy anniversary written all over..it was as if they were the ones who were more excited about the occasion! Really appreciable service!
Special thanks to Sourabh who had taken all care to make things so perfect for the evening!
Another mention would be of the staff member John who had been there to make sure all things were correctly placed and rendered amazing hospitality!

Loved loved loved the ambience. Huge place. The 20th floor gives you a clear view of the city of joy. The entrance to the 20th floor beaut is very confusing. Had to enter the restaurant twice from the service kitchen. Yeah. Embarrassing. 

On the flipside the food is a bit of a downer. Especially the Indian cuisine. It is nothing out of the ordinary and the biryani not so great at all. Im yet to try out their continental menu which I will for sure because I wouldn't mind going all the up there for a beautiful evening again.

Worst pub I have visited till date..The only thing which I loved was the ambience which was really great..Apart from that the food was worst..and the service was unimaginable for a place like that..The waiters were clueless about the menu. And top of that 1000 per head as cover charge for that pathetic food and drinks.  After having such a bad experience I decided to pay only 150 as Service charge instead of 400 imposed by them (FYI: Service Charge is not mandatory for a customer to pay..The customer if he/she wishes can pay partly or nothing at all as service charge)..But the Manager instead of listening to me kind of ordered me in a threatening tone to pay the whole Service Charge.. I told him that this was the last time for me at their pathetic place..So I kind of request to all the party loving people..please dont waste your time at such a place

So for starters It's one of those cool places is Calcutta quite comparable to the roof top lounge in cities like singapore etc. but I guess they have a long way to match up to them in terms of service. 

Staff is not trained and not at all to the standards of a place like this.. they definitely need to deploy better staff to match the ambience.

The food was good.. but the servers did not even know the names of the dishes they got to the table leaving us perplexed in the dimly lit environment hoping that we were not eating any thing non vegetarian 

The drinks where below average.. after asking it to be changed couple of times still wasn't as expected..

Giving the benefit of doubt as it's a new place it's going to improve with time..and hopefully we can find sheesha also there pretty soon..

Before I go any further let me caveat this review by mentioning that I visited it as part of a lunch party and hence the service review would be more related to a banquet type experience.

That said first things first. The view and the ambience is phenomenal. For those who have been to Mumbai/Bangkok it reminds you of the rooftop lounges in those cities. This is a place I would visit with family and friends merely to enjoy the view and relax. The banquet area was next to their pool which I guess would be an awesome place to hold summer parties.

Now to the food review. We had various dishes names of which I would not be able to provide as the setting was a banquet style. For starters we had crispy lotus stems, arancini balls, mushrooms and a indian take on tarts with the outer shell being made from a roomali roti and filled with awesome kaali daal. The starters were all great with another notable mention being the arancini which were some of the best in the city and quite authentic in taste. 

For mains we had two veg. dishes -  a mixed veg, a paneer and kaali daal. There were two non-veg dishes as well in a chicken dish and a prawn dish. The non-veg dishes from what I understand (I did no eat them) were  excellent especially the prawn. The veg dishes were good but nothing that would especially stand out.

Being overfull I did not try the dessert but heard it was quite nice as well.

Service was good but a little slow. I assume the fact that it was a specially booked lunch may have affected the service a bit.

I expect that once the initial teething problems are over this will be one of my favourite places to visit.

Kolkata's new terrace lounge , the place is in the Acropolis mall 20 th floor, has a great view of the city but sadly enough the food quality is really bad and needs a great improvement .

I went with friends and we had the Punjabi fries ,Khao Pod tod (Chilli babycorn) which was not good and the oil used to make it was tasting burnt. And alse ordered the house special Loaded burger De constructed Bunny Chow , sadly enough the food was not good at all and the alcohol prices were very high compared to other lounges.

The management needs to improve the food quality for sure.

Well, finally Kolkata has its own sky lounge and the ambience surely lives upto the expectation. The feel of the winter chill at this 20th floor outlet was definitely worth experiencing. However, having said that I wasn't really wowed by the food or the service. Even though they give u a tab for a menu with fancy names for the dishes, it doesn't really hit the mark. Another problem is even though half d place was vacant, the staff said to sit in d sofa section on the terrace one requires permission from d management- reallyyyy!!! 
The place definitely has the potential, however it looks like an uphill task at d moment!!

The level of excitement we had for visiting this place went to vain after we experienced this place.No doubt that they have the best of space and interiors but the lack in quality of food and service just shadowed our overall elation.They behest Rs1000 per person as cover charges which can be adjusted against bill amount.

Service-This is the worst service i have ever experienced.We ordered for a sheesha at the beginning but we got it almost at the end.Even after our persistent request for getting it earlier they were not listening to us.The food service was also quite slow.For serving us a paneer tikka they almost took 35-40 minutes.They really need to make a drastic improvement in this section.

Ambiance-One will completely fall in love with the place and the skyline view from the 20th floor.The whole place is divided into two section and also has a pool side area.The interiors of the indoor will just make you fall in love with this place.They can accomodate almost 150+ people at a time and along with all this,the lighting at evening time is also an eyepleasing sight.

Food-Firstly most of the dishes were unavailable in the menu(Specially the desserts) and some which were available were also quite average in taste.We had-

1:Paneer Rubiyat Summeri
2:Punjabi masala glazed fries
3:Smoked Marwari Papdi pizza
4:Dal Makhani Tarts
5:Mix sauce pasta

Among them only "Paneer Rubiyat Summeri" was quite good while others were just below average dishes.

Food-2/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Service-1.5/5

This place really need to play a catchup in order to improve itself in food and service aspect.

Well, finally Kolkata has its own sky lounge and the ambience surely lives upto the expectation. The feel of the winter chill at this 20th floor outlet was definitely worth experiencing. However, having said that I wasn't really wowed by the food or the service. Even though they give u a tab for a menu with fancy names for the dishes, it doesn't really hit the mark. Another problem is even though half d place was vacant, the staff said to sit in d sofa section on the terrace one requires permission from d management- reallyyyy!!! 
The place definitely has the potential, however it looks like an uphill task at d moment!!

A good place... but it seems no one had noticed that they are charging taxes without any Registration No. I don't know whether anyone asked for registration number or not but when i m asking them they are not providing..infact they are not responding to calls now.....i think this is illegal on their part and they are collecting form us huge amount as taxes for which they are not authorised.....this is a serious issue and i want all of u to take a step for it

The only pros about this place is its ambience. Otherwise, the service is poor, untrained staffs, and the worst thing about this place is coverage charge. They charge you 1000 bucks per head as coverage charge, which is absolutely not refundable. They won't even mention it clearly. I don't think i'll ever visit this place again.

I along with my friends finally decided to begin the new year at this place. And boy, was i blown away! One will definitely fall in love with the ambience and the spectacular view of the entire city that too from the 20th floor. I surely did. Now, this is the only pro for this place.

Coming to the cons. 1. Highly inexperienced waiters and management. They themselves are clueless about the menu, drinks etc.
2. Food- pretty much average.
3. Price- The cover charge of 1000 per person is a lot, especially if you are going to this place with a big group.
4. Service- Really slow man!

So, apart from the ambience and view, this place was pretty much disappointing!

Ozora has a wonderful ambience, with the entire Kolkata visible.. They have a 1k cover charge redeemable with the bill amount. We ordered punjabi masala fries, baby corn and pazo pazo pizza.. All 3 turned out to be good! Among the drinks, we called for virgin Mojito and blue lagoon.. both were really disappointing and tasted like cold water with sugar syrup.. they need to work on the mocktails.. apart from this slight glitch, everything was very delightful and worth the money! I plan to visit again..:)

We 8 people went to Ozora on 31st December. Reached there around 8 PM, that place was too crowded. Once we sitted we got JD with unlimited Veg and non veg starter according to choice, Option for food specially drinks was good, no limitation to have Jack daniel, black label, chivas, craggenmore, or any other. We became happy with that place, service was excellent, but the most important thing is it's ambience, we can see the whole city while we are taking food form the 20th flore of Accropolice mall. Above all we like that place too, will come back soon, like to reffer to friends. Probably it is the best restaurant under the open sky.

Ambience is amazing. A full view of the skyline from 20 floors high of the Acropolis building. They will charge 1000 rupees entry fees which is redeemable with the bill amount. There is a vast variety in the food menu. We ordered the cheesy French fries with the gravy, two kinds of chicken starters and one fish. Names were too fancy to be remembered but taste was ok, although quantity could be better. Drinks are also available, of the standard kind. The only negatives are that it's too dark on the table, so you cannot see your food properly. Also, the taxes charged were too high. But that's not the restaurant's fault. But, be prepared to shell out anyway. For 6 of us, two rounds of cocktails and 4 starters came to 1350 rupees per head.

The feel and ambiance of the place is amazing.And the view from the 20th floor is superb.
However , when it comes to food the place fails to impress. I, along with my cousins had been there on 31st December at around 5 and we ordered a coffee, choco lava cake and a few drinks.They didn't have the choco lava cake or the coffee and they informed us about it a good 15 mins later.We thought of leaving the place but as soon as we got up the waiter had already brought our drinks.

Anyway, a request to the management would be - sure your ambiance is amazing but please add some value to the dishes and drinks you are serving.

The party on opening day was awesome. 

This place is a hot shot contender for the top slot.

The indoor dinning arena is normal but the outside one is ravishing.

20th floor   like las vegas .

Lighting is classy

I visited this place on Christmas and was spellbound by the ambience.
The place is really nice and the open lounge gives a great view and also the lighting is great.
Owing to the fact that it has just opened this place is being well managed by the opening team.
The staff are very courteous.
The place is great.
Coming to food, we went there for desserts but unfortunately many of the items of the dessert in the menu was not available so we had to settle ourself with drinks.
The place is definitely a worth visit for the view.

The place is cool nicely done ,nice view of the city ,if you looking forward  to have dinner its not the right place , i had gone there with a couple of friends,we ordered a shisha which was terrible,the worst one i have ever had in kolkata,the price that they are asking for such a terrible shisha is 1000 .which is just shit ,complaining every 2 min for the shisha,the starters we ordered  was one veg and one non veg ,which was not that great or wow . According  to the place and price...If you are looking forward for a great evening..its not worth it .. to go to a place just for the view..is not worth ..i would say if you wana throw your  money ,this is the place ...

The arrangement and environment is awesome. The beauty lies at its height. The view of Kolkata from 20th floor is so mesmerizing. You have to visit this place to feel the magic that they have created. The food is awesome. The candel light dinner concept is very romantic. The music in the background is the cerry on top. I would recommend this place. It's a must go with your love.

Just not happy. We were kept waiting for sometime and told at the end that they do not have any table while we saw some people entering there in our presence. Maybe they might have booked table earlier but if that was the scene then they should've informed us as soon as we stepped in that they don't have any table. Pretty disappointing !

Firstly, the management was not prepared to even handle a small crowd on its beginning. We went around 9, ordered nachos, and after one hour, they said it was not available. 
We can still.ignore this, but after coming home and analysing the bill, noticed that they have charged VAT and service tax irrespective of the fact that they have applied for VAT and service tax number. The taxes charged are close to 50% of the bill amount!
Can the management please resolve this for me?

In love with this place. Though I dint get a table but standing next to the bar and enjoying the weather and view was a lovely experience. This place has that charm, their prices are nominal and one can enjoy good drinks and great food. The only drawback is why do they ask to take cover charge, like comeon people have their obvious reasons to get into this place and spend accordingly. Please see to this if you can. The lights are the attraction. I enjoyed my time.

I visited Ozora on the day it opened that's Friday 16th. Upon entering we were asked to pay cover charges of Rs1000 each. We were 8 of us so we paid Rs8000. However, another group entered as we were making the payment and they were not asked to pay. ( I'm assuming they had come upon recommendation) anyway that's not the problem. We reached around 9 pm and till 11 o'clock we were not served even half of our order. Moreover, our soup arrived cold in a large serving dish instead of a warm soup bowl or something. The manager came and assured our orders will be served soon. We waited for another half hour but hardly anything was served. We asked the waiter to bring our bill as it was sheer time waste. Since our cover charge amounted to rs 8000 and barely anything was served from our order, they told us they can't refund the money. They would neither bring us our order nor refund the money. Yeah that's the guys!! We didn't want any chaos and considering they've just opened we were liberal and told them to get anything they have ready. At last we had drinks to make up for the amount because food they either didn't have or there was nobody to serve. I would have rather just gone there for 10 mins, enjoyed the ambience and come back with good reviews than such a horrible experience. It's a nice windy place with good music and seating but a good service would have enhanced my experience.

I visited Ozora on Sunday and I must say that I was blown away seeing the place.I have visited places like AER/Asilo in Mumbai and Sky Bar/Sirroco in Bangkok but this place has the best feel and ambience.I am not a hookah person but was tempted to try once I saw it. Its a must try.. the food and cocktails were mind blowing. The service was a tad slow which is understandable given the new place.. spoke to the manager and they are working really hard to sort out the initial hiccups.I am sure they will sort out the service issues given their experience in this industry.Overall I would sum up by giving 10 on 5  given an option. As someone said it correctly for this place that its a gift to "City of Joy" !!

So finally the much awaited sky lounge has opened its door for kolkatan's.
The ambience is something which is the highlight of this place.Situated at the 20th floor of the acropolis mall which enables one to see the cityscape in most spectacular way possible. The wall of light which was  synchronised with the music stole the show for me.
The management has planned the layout of the covers in a very strategic way. Couple seating is the best of the lot.
Coming to the food now it is on the expensive side but worth it.
The interiors is another aspect where this place scores highly.
The only thing which bothered me was the service. It was too sluggish and literally was a drag.
Conclusion : keeping in mind this place is pretty new and the operations do take time to settle down henceforth brisk service can definitely enhance the guest experience.

Visited the Ozora Sky bar today, 18th of December 2016, Sunday. We had originally planned on having lunch but on arrival we were informed that it wouldn't open before 4:30 pm. We sort of grabbed something to eat at the food court of the Acropolis Mall and reached Ozora about 4:40 pm. There is a cover charge of a 1000 rupees per person for being allowed entry into the sky bar in exchange for which they issue coupons of the same value which can be redeemed during billing. The sky bar is on the 20th floor of the Acropolis Mall overlooking the whole of Kolkata. It's a beautiful bird's eye view from the side that has bar stool type seating - the seating is mostly for 2 here. The other side of the sky bar has sofa seating which is more private. The bar stool seats have a wonderful view of the building front with multicoloured lights which have a synchronised pattern of lighting up with the music. The music is mostly electronica or trance - I don't really know which, but I personally liked it a lot, although if you want to Shazam it, you wouldn't be able to as there is absolutely no net connection whatsoever. The signal for the phone is also very poor and you would have to search around for a spot on the rooftop to complete your call. It was almost sunset at this time - however since it was a very foggy day, there was no appearance by the sun while we were there and therefore we could not witness the much talked about sunset which had been mentioned in a leading newspaper a few days back. 

A waiter soon arrived to take our orders and we ordered for A Smoked Martini, a Peach and Apricot Margarita and a Whisky (Black Dog). Along with the drinks, we asked for some food preferably chicken but were told by the waiter that's this will take over 30 minutes to prepare. On being asked whether a mutton dish could be served faster, he confirmed this and so we ordered for a plate of Mutton Boti Kabab. About 10 minutes later the waiter reappeared with some bad news. He said there was no smoke for the smoked Martini (!!) and of course there was no Black Dog! On being asked for options he seemed at a loss and we called for a senior bartender who managed to change the orders to a Jalapeno Martini and a JD. 

Twilight fell as we waited for our drinks to arrive and we were still enjoying the ambience. The drinks arrived after a wait of about 25 minutes but I was surprised to find my Martini glass to be hardly half full. Also, it was not spicy as expected but rather sweet with hardly a hint of alcohol in it and no Olive.   Our food arrived in another 20 minutes but on trying to portion it, we found it to be very hard to cut through and difficult to chew. We summoned the waiter and informed him about the problem.  He agreed to take the dish back and returned another 10 minutes later to let us know that the chef had tasted the meat and pronounced it to be perfectly cooked (excuse me??!!) This made me lose my cool somewhat and I demanded to see the chef eat it in my presence. This was obviously an uncomfortable situation for the waiter who then involved the manager, Mr Pratyush.

Pratyush offered to solve the situation by discussing our opinion with the chef and in another 10 minutes (this was becoming a habit) returned to where we were seated to let us know that this was the way they cooked their meat (or in other words – “You lowbrow hags, we have done you a great favour by agreeing to serve you”) but “since it was not to your liking, we are offering you another dish which the Chef would specially prepare for you – just give us 10 minutes”. We did not have any other option. So we decided to wait it out.

Meanwhile the bartender returned to ask for feedback and I requested for a repeat of my drink but preferably in a standard quantity. This seemed to upset him and he tried to impress upon me about how martinis were generally made that way (unspoken - how dare I challenge the Martini Guru?) to which I very politely objected, saying I had had many martinis in many places all over Kolkata (and completely forgetting to mention Bangalore, Delhi, London, Rome etc.) and I did not share his vision. This resulted in my 2nd glass of Jalapeno Martini being well laced with vodka and Jalapeno juice and missing any of the sugar syrup of the previous one. The sacrosanct olive was still nowhere in sight!

About 30 minutes later and after having enquired with Pratyush twice and receiving a somewhat irritated response of the Chef having to “labour at making the meat tender enough for our taste buds”, we received a plate of 4 pieces of processed mutton kebabs (NOW HOLD YOUR BREATH) of the kind you get in any food mart or grocery shop (which you need to Grill or reheat at home before you can eat the same). We were completely stunned to say the least and had not at all expected such a bummer!! For all we know, it was probably procured from the nearby roll shop or the food court outlet at the other end of the Mall and served up with the fancy wavy sauce designs and cilantro florets!! Definitely tasted that way.

At the end I would like to mention that we are 3 middle aged women, 2 Entrepreneurs and a COO of an established hospital who were exploring a new outlet in town, hoping to return soon. We were disappointed with the high handed attitude of the staff and the lack of any attention to the customers’ needs. To the future patrons of Ozora Sky bar – DO DEMAND TO BE SERVED WITH RESPECT. 

TO OZORA STAFF – A) UNDERSTAND THE DICTUM ‘THE CUSTOMER IS KING’ (or in our case, Queens) B) DO NOT SERVE SINEWY DIFFICULT TO CHEW MEAT - SUCH IS ONLY FIT FOR THE FLINTSTONES (Maybe your Chef is one), C) DO NOT TRY TO PASS OFF PACKAGED SEMI COOKED MEAT AS GOURMET CUISINE (Do not underestimate the palate of the common Kolkatan), AND D) DON’T SKIMP SO MUCH ON THE ALCOHOL THAT EVEN WOMEN CAN SENSE THE DEFICIT.

I hope you will take the feedback to heart and turn the place around into the delight that it can become.

It doesn't feel that anybody at the place had any hotelier experience. The basic courtesy to serve a customer was lost. The ambience ,that is , only the view was great. Apart from that the music as well as the service was the worst ever. They took 1 hour after taking our order to inform us that they wouldn't be able to serve us the food. Basically , the place wasn't ready to be opened just as yet.

I visited this place tonight.I entered at 9:10 PM with my family.They provided us a table at 10:20 PM.That too after approaching the restaurant manager and  various waiters multiple times.We ordered the food.At 11:30 we got annoyed since the food had not yet come.At 11:45 they returned our money back and we left the place around 11:50.I wasted my 3 hours and didn't get any food.If the people aren't ready to manage the rush and can't provide proper service why open a restaurant?And yes the manager cannot be more ignorant than he was today.He doesn't even know where we are sitting.The guy is busy serving drinks to people.Dude you have waiters for that!Try to manage your customers better.The hype created about this restaurant is just too much.This was one of my worst experiences.And i'm not writing it because I have time for this useless review.It's because the time we left the restaurant.We had no other option but to go home empty stomach.Huge round of applause to the restaurant and everyone associated with it.Thank you.

Very unprofessional behaviour even before the start. Had called up and confirmed today's opening but when we reached there they said it won't be opening today the plan has changed. when we have things going viral on internet, such a reaction is not acceptable and also they could have called up and informed that the plan has changed. Was very unprofessional of them.
