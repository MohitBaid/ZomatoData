This shop is a  god send, the shop to rush to whenever sudden guests turn up. This outlet has been a saviour on many an occasion providing the snacks to serve guests. It is a very small outlet but it stocks quite a variety of snacks ranging from the packaged ones like bhujia,chanachur,chips,dalmoth ,gathia etc. As well as hot snacks like samosa,kachori, dhokla etc. Their pyaj khasta kachori is just awesome, with the right blend of spices. I simply love this and have had this innumerable times. Tastes best when had hot. ( best time to get it is in the evening when it's just been fried). Other times you get the oven heated one,doesn't taste as good!! They also stock a variety of sweets I ke ladoos,pedas,barfis etc.but I feel that their quality is not so good. The snack items are good. I've been to this shop a zillion times but suddenly realised that I hadn't penned a review for it, so decided to correct this and hence this review now.
