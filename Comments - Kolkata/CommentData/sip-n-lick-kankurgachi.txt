Well, this one is a pretty small health bar based nearby the Vodafone customer care centre at Kankurgachi and is run by a sweet Bong couple! They offer quite a few juices, hot and cold beverages and desserts! I am a huge fan of their pineapple juice, and visited them recently – only to realize that now they offer quite a few items!

A majority items off the menu weren’t available, especially, my favourite pineapple juice – and I had no option, but to settle for a modest watermelon juice! However, the same was pretty tasty. Quantity served is pretty decent as well!

Unfortunately, the same caused me severe acidity some time later – for which, may be they can’t be blamed!

Prices are pretty reasonable, but variety and availability has severely declined as compared to the yesteryears! Place is pretty small and some seating arrangements have been provided just outside – where you can sit and enjoy your beverage! A special thanks to the lady for her hospitality, she is very pretty and very sweet!

Nice small joint, offers good and fresh items. Good place to give adda. It is run by a couple who are sweet and friendly. Service is prompt. We went for English Happy Meal and Mix English Omelette
, both the items were extremely tasty and of good quality. Overall a good experience.

A small and a cute place. This evening I went for some shopping to Pantaloons, and on my way back discovered this small eatery. Its a joint on the main road itself, just a few metres walk away from Kankurgachi Pantaloons, so very easily locatable. 
Although its a small eatery, but their menu does have a number of options of snacks, sandwiches, drinks, juices, smoothies and icecreams, which I liked about the place.
It has an open kitchen, that is the customers can see their food and drinks getting prepared. The decor is simple, well-lit, with seven eight chairs kept for people to sit.
What I ordered - 
1. English Meal - this meal platter had two bread toasts, chicken saucages and an egg poach served with ketchup. All the items were good in taste, fresh, and healthy!
2. Iced Tea - they serve an instant made iced tea which was quite okay.
3. Special IceCream Scoop - This was a single scoop of chocolate icecream which they served with some chocolate sauce and choco chips toppings. 
I liked the food, the behaviour of the owner was cery good and friendly. The prices are very affordable. Best for quickie bites sessions on the go!!

Possibly one of the cutest shops I've come across. Sip N Lick combines decent, inexpensive good with friendly staff to bring you a very refreshing experience.

Their food is good -- their drinks however leave a bit to be desired. Nevertheless, because they manage to deliver so much in such little time, they deserve a proper mention. They're just a snack shop though, perfect for breakfast and your evening's hankering. Definitely going to come back here multiple times, and soon.

Lovely joint.
Lovely staff.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

On a late evening me and my friend planned to visit this place.
Small shack.. With all slim chairs.. Simple sittings.. And an elaborate menu which is almost rare in this area..
Well i ordered chicken salami sandwiches and my friend ordered something calld salasage sandwich.
She made us good sandwiches within minutes
Well the sandwiches were okish.. Nothing different.. And they could do it some chips as well .. 
The point of adding extra cheese to my sandwich was pointless as it didn't cause much difference.. Though they were filling.
I noticed a variety of ice creams there which I will try... And will review my rating..
