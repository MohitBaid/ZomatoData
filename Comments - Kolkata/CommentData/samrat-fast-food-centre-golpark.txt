Perfect for a quick snack, however I'll suggest that you do not take something which you cannot eat while you're on the go because the sitting area is nasty and filled with cockroaches around, well you can't ask better coz it is a street side stall but I have seen better. Not that their food is hygienic too but it does taste good.

Near golpark petrol pump, this good corner is a reasonable hub for chinese and mughlai dishes. Quality of the food is quite good and the quantity is also sufficient.

This place is a small food joint.  Located at golpark. 
We ordered 
‚ùá Half plate chicken biryani ( it's contains 1 piece aloo,  1 piece of chicken , 1 piece of boiled egg and onion salad) biryani very light and fluffy . Also less oily. 

We choose lunch pack combo 
‚ùá veg rice and chicken curry :- the fired rice was good in taste.  The chicken curry also very good but a little bit spicy.  
Otherwise it's was a very good combo at just rupess 60. Quality and quantity of the food was great. Definitely recommend for one time visit.

Had rolls from this place quite a couple of times when our pocket pinch was low. This place is over-shadowed by the Alibaba's roll centre just beside it. Their rolls are good enough considering the low price.

This one is located at Golpark.
Tried their chicken biriyani 3 years ago. Biriyani was average, like the other street biriyani centers in kolkata. Only thing is that one can atleast nullify the hunger with their rolls or fried rice, chilli chicken at low cost.

Gosh! Must say that this place is a hidden gem in the area. I have tried their rolls, mughlais and momos and none of them have ever disappointed me. Everything is so well done here at Samrat. The place is running so fast, that you will hardly get anything post 8 in the evening. The food is something I can vouch for. Definitely recommended. Happy Dining! :)

Porota with chili chicken, or porota with alur dom, or biryani with salad - name it, and Samrat will let you have it. This little fast food joint with barely any sitting space has won my heart every time I have been here. Although the biryani is not of a "high" quality, as popular notions go, it was good enough for my taste buds. Their option of a half plate biryani is simply perfect if you want to try out any other item. Loved the place every time I was here.

Located beside Alibaba at Golpark, had tried Roll once. The sitting option is almost minimal, with a few benches to cater to your convenience. The Paratha was tad-bit oily, spoiling the fun. Saw many people dropping by and asking for the Chili Chicken. Would like to drop in again in the near future to try some of their popular items. However, as far as Roll goes, I would still prefer Alibaba over this one.

Dropped in to this outlet for a quick bite with chicken roll and some fish fingers for a late evening snacks.
Located at the Golpark crossing beside the petrol pump this place is a take away joint with sitting arrangements with bench and tools on the footpath. 
All the items tastes good with average quality and oily too. Average experience.

I have had their rolls as well as their chilli chicken-fried rice combo. I like their Rolls a lot. Even their combos are good too and handsome in portions. It is located at the Golpark crossing beside the Petrol Pump. There is no such seating area. People mostly seat on the benches that has been laid on the footpath

Location near golpark petrol pump beside alibaba.. outdoor sitting inside a lane where people would stare at you food.. I have tried several foods from here like paratha with alu dum which is good and tummy feeling. Chowmein is also good..they serve good food which is absolutely fantastic for college goers..

One can easily spot this fast food centre on the left while heading towards Gariahat from Golpark. I have been to this place after my classes at RKM. I didn't have enough time to sit and eat lots of items from here so whenever I visited I grabbed on rolls. Needless to say they make things at a storming speed. Need not wait for too long carrying a yelling tummy. There are a few benches on the front for people who prefer to sit and savour their dishes. I found the rolls to be tasty enough and were large enough in terms of size. There were others popular fast food centers aside but somehow I preferred this one. Keep eating!

Food is not that good...though a good spot to filly your tummy with light snack...Eggroll is good along with chili chicken....went last yr in the pujas...the shop was heavily crowded & for improper seating place less amount price is very high for chowmein & fried rice...

Won't recommend at all...go for having a light snack ...don't expect too much
