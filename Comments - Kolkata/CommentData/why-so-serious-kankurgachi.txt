Basically it's a hookah parlour... And the environment is not discreet as a restaurant usually be. If you wanna hook up with your friends and have a loud hangout then it's a pocket friendly place you have to be. Another major issue - Items they mentioned not available. So, my 1 point goes to the food quality and other point goes to the superhero setup. Just think thrice before selecting this restaurant!

This place resembles it's name .. it's basically fr uplifting ur serious mood.. If u want silence then this place isn't for u but if u want to hear gud Hindi or Punjabi based songs with good amount of bass then it's definitely fr u :) .. gud as a hookah parlour fr having just hookah .. didn't have food so can't comment on that but their collection of tracks is pretty awesome

If you are looking for  only Hookah then this is the place.
Ambience  and people around there is weird.
Food  sucks!
Hookah is very good. 
Ambience is so so.

It's supposedly a super hero cafe, but the only thing the cafe showcase is the avengers( mostly the movie) apart from the movie posters there's a bit superhero merchandise lying around here Nd there. But that's all there is. The ambience set up is very cosy but that ruins with loud item numbers . We ordered shakes Nd sandwiches... Food was good specially the shakes..

Went there wid my frnds grp to celebrate one of my frnd's bday...located in the same lane of cafe 360 and aqua java..   

 I personally liked their seating arrangements..couches,sofas are comfortable.they also have a bed type seating arrangement for a big group  . Ambience is good..   food is ok..hookah is not so good.. bt the prices are comparatively lower.. on an average can visit this place wid frnds

Nothing about this place was good. Worst cafe ever visited. The food was horrible. The baby corn was too hard. Hookah was also a let down. People hardly do visit this cafe. I would advise nobody to visit the cafe. Its a waste of time and money.!!

I personally think that this place can do so much better... the food is super sweet, which is a big let down.. nobody wants to eat sugary pasta!! The lime soda and the mojito were refreshing.. 
The management needs to make sure that the place is clean.. very very unclean! üòë

Themed on Avengers, this Cafe has different sections on Hulk, Captain America, Batman etc. The interior is also based on the same with various wall hangings, cushions etc with pictures of the said characters. Ambience is quite decent. The staff was also quite courteous and friendly. Coming to the menu, it offers a wide variety of Finger Food, Chinese, Italian etc. Price is quite on the lower side as compared to caf√©s of the similar kind. As for food, we had ordered Garlic Bread, Corn Cheese Balls, Chinese Mix Sauce Pasta, Pink Lady and a Fresh Lime Soda. The Garlic Bread and the Corn Cheese Balls were pretty good. But the Pasta was a big turn off!!! It was extremely sweet which is quite shocking for a pasta. Only if it weren't so sweet, it wouldn't be bad at all as there were generous amount of toppings in it like olives, corns, various veggies and so on. But just the sweetness messed up the whole thing. 
Overall a nice place to catch up with your friends over some yummy delicasies. The best part is it's really Pocket Friendly!! :)

This outlet is located near Kankurgachi Pantaloons.

The ambience is Oh-so-good. Plays such great music. The decor is perfect. Seating arrangements are so cosy and comfortable. 

Tried Brain Freezer Hookah with Ice Base, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Cheese Maggi, Cold Drink & Chocolate Shake.

*Hookah was properly done. 
*Babycorn was good to the taste buds. *Whereas, Cheese Maggi lacked in cheese. And both of them lacked in Quantity, as well. Disappointing enough ! *Cold Drink had more of Ice cubes than the drink itself. 
*However, Chocolate Shake was great to make you forget about those extra cubes of ice. :P

Service is quick & efficient. Staffs are courteous.

Overall, a nice outlet to chill with your mates. Only thing lacked is the quantity of food. Cheers ! :)
