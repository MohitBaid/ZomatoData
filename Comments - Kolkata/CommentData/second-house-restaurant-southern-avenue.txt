Very fruitful experience. The management and the staff are excellent in behaviour, and you would definitely like the food here even though being a non-vegetarian!
Plus they served you alcohol at very cheap rates indeed. Happy hours is the best time to visit.

I have loved this place right from the first time i had been there.. great good..great ambience..great hospitality.. infact we also host our family get togethers in their banquets twice a year.. location wise its connected good.. probably now there s nothing left on their menu card which i havnt tried or havnt liked.. best of everything.. and they always try to improvise on the feedback received on their food.. as the name suggests.. it is truely a home away from home.. Second House :):)

Nice place. Great ambience. Fast serving. Reasonable rates.Tax free booze. Remarkable offers. Excellent experience. Not much crowded,the bar cum restaurant offers best atmosphere for pub lovers and vegetarian foodies. The service men are extremely well behaved and cheerful. The restaurant also has a hookah parlour for smoke lovers. As a whole it is the best place in South Kolkata for quality boozing at a comparative low price along with a safe and happy ambience.

Located at the heart of Southern Avenue , this vegetarian  bar cum restuarant is the place to be if you want to have good vegetarian food . This restuarant specializes in Chinese and continental . 

What I Ordered -

1. ALOO DO PYAZA : This item , filled with aloo and vegetables was very good, a must try.

2.AMERICAN CORN PEPPER SALT : If you are American sweet corner lover and also lover pepper, try out this dish .

3.BLACKDAL TADKA : This dish tasted amazing. Dig it with nan , tandoori roti ,etc 

4.GARLIC PANEER : I am a big time paneer lover ,so this dish was quite good according to me 

5.GREEN SALAD : Freshly cut salad , served with some pepper and salt . 

6.HONEY CHILLI MUSHROOM : If you are mushroom lover and also love honey, this dish is perfect for you . A bit spicy , but worth it 

7.MALAI KOFTA : It was okayish , nothing fancy .

8.MASALA KULCHA : I had it with black dal tadka and the combination was very good

9.PANEER TIKKA MASALA :  Freshly cut paneer pieces , with gravy , perfect to have it with tandoori roti , naan , etc

10.PANEER TIKKA : This is the dry paneer tikka, grilled paneer tastes amazing 

11.PASTA WITH WHITE SAUCE : I have always been a lover of pasta , and try out the pasta here, it was too much tasty 

12.RAJASTHANI NAAN : I had this with Paneer tikka Masala , it was worth it 

13.TANDOORI ALOO : This is one of the star item of this place, the aloo is grilled to perfection and its stuffed , do not miss out on this 

14. VEG HAKKA NOODLES : The quality of the noodles was quite good and the vegetables was very fresh 

15.VEG PULAO : Had this item with malai kofta, the combination was very good 

Second House is a good place to order from, but it is not good because the loud music creates an issue and disturbance if you are with your family members.

Second House restaurant's food is really very delicious. The way they serve the North Indian delicacies in a very casual and simple, but delicious manner is itself very appreciable. Moreover, the presentation of the food is also really very appetizing, along with the aroma of the dish. I always prefer to order from Second House my lunch or dinner, whenever I want. Mind it, I don't like to dine in at the restaurant, because of the bar they have constructed and also because of the loud music that they play. I always travel with my family and hence, I would not like to visit such a place. But, since the food is extraordinarily delicious, we regularly keep ordering from their. I would like to conclude by saying that Second House is a good place to order from, but, it's the worst place to visit due to the bar and the loud music for family people.

Crispy chilly babycorn and paneer tikka was really good. Its reasonable too. If this place served non veg food, it would have been one of the best in the area.

This place is located in a small lane near rashbehari avenue. The interiors have changed completely, they have introduced blue and red lights and given it a look of a lounge.  The introduction of alcohol might bring in new customers but it may also lead to loss of old loyalists which were basically families looking for a simple vegetarian restaurant. The staff remains the same and hence the taste of food has not changed a bit, though the quality is questionable. Service is tardy .
Coming to the food
Try the hyderabadi Biryani, the raita served with it is something you wouldn't get enough of. Also go for masala kulcha and the hyderabadi handi veg . Try the yellow tarka dal. try the Hakka noodles and the pasta. Unfortunately they have removed the mushroom masala.

Would not recommend crispy chilli babycorn, paneer tikka .
The quantity served is less in proportion to the price paid.

Being a veggie, its slightly difficult to find a restaurant in a city known for having a plethora of non veg delicacies. One of them stands out particularly and that has to be the Second House.

Now, they have changed the look but the taste of the food remains the same. Perfect for a family dinner. Paneer tikka was not that good. But the other items that we ordered were proper. The best part of the food here is that it is not that heavy. This place is not even that expensive.
Decent food at decent prices.

On this Sunday, 04-10-2015, to my great pleasure I found again outsiders are allowed to avail Veggy delicious B'Fast like before. 1st. Floor Rstnt. Is under renovation , they have shifted to a very nice place ( Hall) very comfortable to dine. 
       It was a Buffet Spread , Luchi & Aloo curry & Upma was delicious. Less oily & less Spicy , not like those traditional Red chilly & oil dripping type, but very tasty & healthy . It took me by surprise. However , food was very good , I enjoyed the food lot better than in those early days. Ambience was simple and elegant. Service was very good. Now, I'll be a regular besides the delicious lunch Pack( Rs. 100.00+) in Home Delivery to Netaji Nagar. Thanks Lucnch House, keep it up.

Visited 2nd House yesterday for dinner. This was a second visit after a year and hoped much would have changed. But to my surprise it seemed to have gone down south.

Since the restaurant area is under construction, the banquet area has been made into the restaurant. Limited tables. Very far from the kitchen so most of the food became luke warm when it was being served.

Service - Extremely poor and very slow.

Ordered fresh lime soda sweet & salt mix, the drink didn't have fizz and the drink was so sweet , felt as though the person preparing was taking some kind of revenge or had no idea at all what to prepare.

Rotis and kulchas served cold.

Extreme use of green chillis making food very spicy for those who don't eat spicy food.

To the management, please review and improve on all use inputs and feed back to increase footfall.

I went there with my family one Sunday evening. The restaurant is not spacious and the all-veg restaurant is the newest in this area, hence, we went there. The restaurant serves all veg delicacies. There are men hanging around near the kitchen, supposedly the cooks and the management, but none of them seem to work remotely towards customer satisfaction. The restaurant might seem understaffed as only one person seemed to be working and taking orders and serving too. This is the case of a Sunday evening, and I dread to imagine how the restaurant would be managing even more guests in the upcoming Puja days!

The place is wonderful and well decorate. Simple veg of all types.
Ordered noodles, so those were also very tasty.
But a little bit problem is the food serving is a little bit poor. Otherwise its a lovely place ( except toilet.. Really that was so much irritating in this type of restaurant )

The restaurant is located a little off from the Rashbehari main road ,you could take a right from the first lane before Lake Mall to get there.

The place looks old so do not expect to get dazzled by the sheer looks of it. It looks like one of those recently altered guest houses or homes into a dining place.

I ordered hara bhara kebab and crispy chilly baby corn along with hot and sour soup for starters. The kebab was extremely dry and did not turn up my appetite for the main course as I wanted. The CCBC and H&S soup were ok to taste.

For the main course I had navratan pulao and paneer do pyaza, both of which failed to satisfy the last shred of hope I had left hanging.

All in all ,I am not happy with 2nd house and I am positive my first house has a much better sense of cuisine instead.

Food is awesome. Ambience is good. Located opposite lane of tollygunge p.s. Rashbehari, Given 3.5 rating cause they really need to improve in getting the order as fast as to the table. They take too much time in preparing the food. Else value for money.

Just the place for vegetarians. They're not into ambience but the food is good and tasty though on the "oilier" side. Wish they would be careful on the oil. 
They also seem to have one gravy for all vegetable dishes.

If you are looking for a pure vegetarian joint for taking your entire family (including the ones who don't step into places that serve non-veg), this is a decent option. Indian items are definitely lip smacking, though the Chinese ones are not bad either and is Indianized. The service is quick and the waiters helpful and guide you well on the food. Ambience is above average, but don't let that deceive you because the food is surely excellent. 

The tandoori paneer and aloo are charred perfectly with a smokey flavour. For those who love a bit of grease the Rajasthani aloo dum gets the best rating. Mushroom masala is the second favourite dish out here. Do try the yellow dal, which is again fragrant and light on the palette to counter the heavier dishes. 

Not much for desserts but you can go for the old school tutty fruity if you really have a sweet craving. On the whole, good value for money.

The paneer tikka ordered was a very bland and the lime soda sweet was not at all sweet and served in a very small glass.. the butter naam ordered was very hard.. It was a bad experience.. Price wasnt that costly

Location: Rashbehari Avenue.

Happened to come across this place during one of my evening strolls. 
It's a restaurant on the first floor of the Second House hotel. 
Planned to give this place a visit... 
... And ended up here for lunch. 

Without much ado, we straight away proceeded to the main course. 
Ordered Dal Makhani, Masala Kulcha and a cold coffee with icecream. 

-The Dal Makhani seemed more of a homely preparation with adequate quantity of kidney beans in it. 
Tasted good. Hasn't come upto the level it should be serving for the price it charges.  

-The Masala Kulcha tasted good, yet again with a filling which felt as if prepared by a Commis Chef. 

-The cold coffee was average. 

Th service was quite laid back and the staff while taking down the order, had to keep rushing to the kitchen to enquire about the availability of the dish which was being ordered implying about they being ill-informed.  
Turn off. 

Prices are pocket friendly which felt as a pinch considering the food that was served.  

Average experience.

Chanced upon this while hunting for a cab near Kalighat metro station, and thought of going inside for a quick bite. 
Ordered two safe bets - crispy baby-corn and a macaroni salad. But it turned out that they weren't as safe as I had thought them to be. The crispy baby corn was good, just a tad bit too salty for my palate, though my friend found the seasoning to be perfectly alright. 
Then came the salad. The very look of it was a turn-off for me. It was macaroni doused in a green chutney with chunks of diced cucumber in every bite. I understand its okay to Indianize dishes, but for me it ruined the salad. It was definitely not what i was looking for. And in my opinion, its best not to tamper with such universal combinations, and if you have to, please mention that in the menu. Because I was looking for a heart-warming mayo-filled white salad and was definitely shocked and disappointed with the mac being accompanied by green chutney and an overwhelming amount of diced cucumbers.

Recent Visit: 

They have renovated the restaurant and made changes to the menu after getting a bar licence.  So what was once  a nice, no frills family restaurant has now become a kind of a  lounge cum restaurant. Its distastefully done, too wannabe. Its become so dark with excessive use of red and blue lights that you cannot even make out what is there on your plate.  The food quality is more or less the same but lot of the popular items are no longer there on the menu. 

This was a very popular place for lots of gujaratis ,marwaris and even bengalis who preferred pure veg food but  with  the changes made i doubt if things will remain the same. Me and my family were regulars here, but were really disappointed by the changes made.  Serving Alcohol will certainly make them lose family crowd .  Do not feel like visiting again. All good things must come to an end i guess. Time to look for other options.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                This place is pretty popular as a marriage guest house where the entire family can shift and stay and conduct various functions as well.This is one of those places where you would not expect much from the food or service and you might be pleasantly surprised. I have been here twice and once ordered take away once and i am really happy with their food. This is a great place for vegetarians and is frequently flocked by gujaratis, marwaris and jains. 

Location: This restaurant is situated inside their  guest house sharing the same name. A much more simple way to reach this Place would be to take a left in the lane right before southern avenue & rash behari intersection. 

Decor:  It looks like a very nondescript restaurant and there is not much to impress. But the place is neat and clean, spacious. The seating is comfortable. 

Items worth trying:

tom yam soup
tandoori alu
crispy chilli babycorn
chilly mushroom

main course: 

Rajasthani aloo dum
paneer tikka masala- ( must try)
mushroom masala -  ( do )
Malai Kofta- a tad too sweet but still worth trying.
Yellow dal tadka- Really memorable, very well cooked. 

Their breads are well baked too. garlic naan and masala kulcha are very good. 

Pocket pinch: 450/500 per head.

Conclusion: All main course items were exceptionally good with each and every dish having its own distinct gravy (unlike most restaurants where they have standard gravies and simply toss vegetables into it). On the whole a very very satisfying experience each time. Prices i agree are on the higher side with vat, service tax and service charge. But taxes are uniform everywhere and most of us do tip 5% of the bill, then why mind the service charge? They do not compromise on their food quality. An excellent option for people who do not eat at places that serve non veg.

First of all thanks to Zomato for providing me a gift voucher of this restaurant.
Well coming to the restaurant, ambiance and location are good, however I felt staffs are bit less cooperative.
To be very honest, I was never fond of just veg food but still liked this place except the fact that food is overpriced.
We had Crisp chilly baby corn, the taste was good but the chilly mushroom was equally bad--salted and deeply fried and had no taste at all.
The bread basket contained laccha parantha,tandoori roti,naan and masala kulcha--it was really average and if we compare the size of breads compared to price they charge you might be bit disheartened.
Again coming to the side dishes, for people who like shahi preparations, please try the Kashmiri alurdam, bit sweet but the taste was marvelous. And one more item we had Matar paneer--it was again just an average preparation.
Probably for vegetarian people this place will be good one for trying out but be aware of the price--really expensive and on top that they will take service charge and service tax separately in addition to Vat.
I would have given just 3 but just for the Kashmiri Alurdam I would like to give slight more than that.
Definitely would try out rice and dal items and few other preparations , when visited for the next time.

Have heard about second house a couple of times from my relatives but didn't had the opportunity to visit it till last saturday i.e 10th May, 2014. The food was great and icing on the cake was that this is a pure veg restaurant. The only drawback was slow service considering the fact we were the only people present in the restaurant and it took a close to 20 mins for the 1st food item to be served, however the great food helped us to forget this shortcoming.

Next day we ordered for home delivery and noted difference in the items ordered and items delivered and management was prompt enough to correct it and deliver what was ordered. This is really appreciable considering that not only delivery person has to come twice but they also replaced the order within short span of time. 

I would recommend second house for its great food and hospitality.

This joint is suitable for morning breakfast .They serve different varieties in breakfast .Main item change every day . It is buffet style in morning . Those who prefer English type breakfast,this is the perfect for them .They served  Toast with jam , corn flakes , fruits , juices, cakes , sweets  and a regular Indian Snacks item like PAUVA , CLUB KACHORI with vegetables , UPMA , Alu PARATHA  with Curd   .

Since they raise their breakfast ( it is still cheaper ) lots of people previously come regularly avoid due to the reason mentioned.But . I with my other family members still likes this joint .

To begin with, a thank note to the owner to the restaurant for opening a pure veg restaurant which are too less options for my family (they only dine at pure veg restaurants).... Since it was our huge family get together (30 of us) on 29.09.2013, we got reservations for lunch (Btw till the time we left, we were the only group sitting out there).. Now the review

Located on the first lane coming from Rashbehari towards Southern Avenue(first left to be taken from the lane where there is Elite Optical in the corner), place is close by to Funjabi Tadka, place was easily to find since it was my first visit to the place.

Decor: Nothing to crave about... It wouldn't even term is ordinary / normal but it has nothing in the decor.... Just plain colored walls and nothing else..... Cutlery was also very not proper (they didn't had spoon on the table unless u ask for it)...

Food: Nothing great in taste... We directly ordered main course (Indian)... We ordered Methi Matar Malai, Malai Kofta, Paneer Tikka Masala, Dal Makhani, Peas Pulao, Butter Roti, Naan, Lacha Partha, Papad, Salad (All items mentioned above are Jain)... We divided our group into Jain and Non Jain

Malai Kofta was heavenly too sweet and i did not like it, Methi Matar Masala was average, Tikka was missing from Paneer Tikka Masala, Dal Makhani was bland, Butter Roti was served without butter (every after telling them with butter, they did not serve us), Naan was soft and Paratha was crisp but nicely cooked... The only good thing above all the items were Peas Pulao which was better than above mentioned items... 

Service: Confused, slow and poor service.. They served Dum Aloo to us stating it Jain when complaining about the confusion, they did not even bother to apologize for the goof up... Anyways slow service and they had no idea on the menu and service was very poor...

On exit, they offer 20% discount coupons (in case one wanna visit it again, their marketing strategy).. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone...
