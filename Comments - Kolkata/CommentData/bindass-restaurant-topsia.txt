Visited there after office on my way back to home. Chicken was finished so I have to opt for the Tikia Roll instead. No qualms about the paratha but the minced meat tasted bitter and felt like more of a leftover from other dishes.
Disappointed!! ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”

An average option for quick bite around the topsia area. They also have some decent offerings in the meal menu like rice dal etc. But I tried a chicken roll from here which was very basic and quite oily too. Nothing extraordinary to mention here.

Great food...@ a very reasonable rate!  Small but neat and clean ambience. Fast service and friendly staff...!
3.5 stars just because they don't have a separate kitchen... The kitchen is within the sitting area.
