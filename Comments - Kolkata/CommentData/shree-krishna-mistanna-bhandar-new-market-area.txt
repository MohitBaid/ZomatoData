located just opposite Regal cinema on S.N Banerjee Road.Visited this place with friends last day for breakfast.We have tried hing kachauri.Kachauris are excellent in taste with those red chutnees and aloos.Sweets are also lipsmacking.''Langccha'' is just mouthwatring.A great place for morning snacks in pocket friendly range.

Hospitality was nice.Â  Best kachori n rasgulla in esplanade area, cheap as hell .  I love the aachar they serve with the kochuri and yes! You cannot overlook the picture of AB Senior hanging on the wall! ðŸ™‚

Shree Krishna Mistanna Bhander is a sweet shop located at Esplanade , opposite of Regal cinema.

Ambience is nice , service was quick.

They sell a wide variety of sweets & snacks.

Tried their famous Kachori served with aloo torkari, red chutney and green chilli pickle is just mind blowing. A must try. Their lassi is good too.

Pocket pinch is ok.

Once upon a time, I was lingering around Esplanade waiting for someone. Instead of acting like a wayward, I felt it legitimate enough to go inside this place and try some stuffs.
I did start with a cup of tea, which did not taste any good. However, I further ordered kachori just to buy some time and make myself little used to the area and surroundings.
While, the serving was somewhat "okay", the willingness to serve customers did lack a great deal.
The set up was small, the sitting arrangement not very clumsy and thus you won't be in too trouble sitting there. The cleanliness lacked way much and hygiene is a big question mark.

Visited here for a quick bite in the afternoon. Sweets and bengoli snacks outlet. Proper sitting arrangement. Ambience was okay. Hospitality was nice. Friendly and helpful staff. quick service and presentation was nice. Price was bit high maybe because Amitabh bachchan visited here once. In this visit I tried their most famous hing kachori which was presented very well and good in taste nothing hi-fi.

Their Kochuri is one of the worst that I had ever tried. Went there once while I went to buy a Lens for my camera. I excepted this place to serve atleast average food. But unfortunately things were worst. The Samosa they make is another worst thing you will find. Totally disappointing.!!

I am dissapointed with the review This got! I understand that it is not so hygenic but c'mon! You cannot just ignore the kochuri they make. The best Kochuri I have eaten in kolkata is from this shop! I love the aachar they serve with the kochuri and yes! You cannot overlook the picture of AB Senior hanging on the wall! ðŸ™‚ 
Try their Dahi Vada too. It tastes good.

This place is famous for original hing kachori. There are so many varieties of sweets. Every item is just awesome in taste and of course in you small budget. If you want to full your tummy in small budget, this is the best place for you.
I have thought that I would give rating 5. But I have given 4 because of sitting arrangement.

This place opposite Regal cinema is famous for the Kachori. They serve other items like lassi, sweets etc. too, but most people visit this place only for the kachoris.

As far as ambiance and hygiene is concerned, both are non existent. The seating arrangement is sharing and in rush hours you need to wait beside a table to ensure a seat. Service is fast but not great.

But I forget everything when I enjoy the kachoris here. Served along with potato curry (with skin), chutney and chilli pickle, they are a must try here. Specially the chilly pickle. The one thing that makes all the difference. 

In all, visit this place only if you are a kachori fanatic who loves chillis.

Located bang on SN Banerjee road, you could miss it if you are not frequent in that area. My husband is so i got to eat here. I loved the kochuris.. fluffy and khasta. Very nicely made. The alur torkari and chatni served along were tasty too. Pricing is reasonable. The place is always crowded.

A not so decent Bangali mishti place at the heart of Esplanade. I was once forced to come and eat here with a friend. Had the singara and ledikeni. Didn't like any of them. The singara was too spicy and hot. And I think the ledikeni was rotten. Bad experience.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: At the S.N Banerjee road near the Elite cinema actually opp of Regal Cinema. This is the place where you see people getting in than any God's temple. Always crowded with people and the food keep coming in.Â 

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: Ambiance is small. few table which are all common sitting. Basically all the people who are locals are always dined in. You wont find any better class of people dinning in here. Lots of staff here who are so busy that you need to call them if you need something. Place is quite dirty and small to walk even.

FOOD: We ordered the kachori which all were having there. Kachori was too too ordinary and taste was not at all good. Don't know how the people over there loves it so much. The Alur sobzi was even poor. Its better i have kachori of any street food. Thou the size of the kachori was good and seems made well. Later i added Gulab Jamun to which was very pale thou taste was good. Finally after the disastrous kachori we had made minds to eat the Faluda aka Kulfi. Kulfi was thou a bit satisfatory to me.

KACHORI : 3/10

GULAB JAMUN: 6/10

KULFI: 7/10

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of the food was poor and quantity was ok. Price of that kachori is too expensive for this taste. Rs. 28/- per plate with only 4 kachori!!!!! It deserve only only Rs.10/- according to me. Don't know if it was my worst experience here or i had a bad day here.....

CONCLUSION: ONLY ONE WORD FOR THIS PLACE. IMPROVEMENT REQUIRED.

NOTE: The review is based on my personal visit and Experience to this place.

Unforgettable hinger kachuri with alur tarkari and their spiced green chilliesâ€¦ umpteen times from breakfast to late evening snacks for agesâ€¦ never failed.. this institution is an epitome by itself.. and seamlessly handles haggards like us â€¦ pray it continue to serve us till we existâ€¦ with these institutions can we relentlessly link our times in calcutta...every meal is worth a memory..

Just located opposite of Regal cinema on SN Banerjee Rd. Its is really great place for quick bites. I had hing kachori and gulab jamun. Kachori was served with potato curry, mixed chilli, chatni. Mixed chilli enhanced the experience of eating. Kachori was crispy and hot. Gulab jamun was also hot and tasty. Great place for eating at pocket friendly price.

Amazing food and great taste follows an unforgettable experience at Shree Krishna. This place brings out the true essence of Calcutta and a Bengali to be precise! Extremely pocket friendly and the hing kachoris leave a lingering taste on your taste buds. A must try for all

Shree krishna is located just opposite of regal cinema,a few minutes walk from esplanade big bazar. A busy & populated place throughout with hungry souls of all ages.

I visited this place today evening after my training class to have some samosas costing 6 per piece. The samosas were served fresh with generous amount of stuffing & a sweet chutney was provided as well which complimented with the samosas very well. You can get other thnings as well like lassi,sweets,puri-sabzi,kulfi etc.

So if you are looking for some light snacks to cool down your growling tummy then it's a place you can pay a visit.
